<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 06 [LOC PARIS  ] 003919 SIPDIS SIPDIS FOR THE SECRETARY FROM THE AMBASSADOR NSC FOR [ORG NSA  ] HADLEY DEPT ALSO FOR EUR , [ORG NEA  ] , [ORG SA  ] , AND [PER AF E.O.  ] 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 09/17/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/FR_0.html'>FR</a> <a href='/tag/EUN_0.html'>EUN</a> <a href='/tag/NATO_0.html'>NATO</a> <a href='/tag/UNO_0.html'>UNO</a> <a href='/tag/UNMIK_0.html'>UNMIK</a> <a href='/tag/YI_0.html'>YI</a> <a href='/tag/RS_0.html'>RS</a> <a href='/tag/IR_0.html'>IR</a> <a href='/tag/IS_0.html'>IS</a> <a href='/tag/LE_0.html'>LE</a> KPAL SUBJECT: FM KOUCHNER'S SEPT. 19-21 VISIT TO [LOC WASHINGTON  ] Classified By: Ambassador [PER Craig Stapleton  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B & D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] who arrives in [LOC Washington  ] Sept. 19 remains both an extremely popular [MISC French  ] politician and one of the few of President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's ministers who has retained a margin of independent authority . 
[PER Kouchner  ] , the most prominent of the Socialists who accepted positions in the [PER Sarkozy  ] government , continues to lead the polls as [LOC France  ] 's most popular political figure . 
( With a 69% favorable rating , he is well ahead of other ministers -- and even of [PER Sarkozy  ] himself , who comes in at 64% ) . 
At a time when other ministers have receded so deeply into [PER Sarkozy  ] 's shadow as to become invisible , [PER Kouchner  ] remains very much in charge on a number of issues -- [LOC Darfur  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and [LOC Kosovo  ] , for example . 
While other Ministers are routinely contradicted by the President ( including the Prime Minister , whom [PER Sarkozy  ] has referred to publicly as his " collaborator , " a fancy term in [MISC French  ] for staffer ) , [PER Kouchner  ] 's voice is strong and authoritative . 
That said , and despite the good personal rapport with [PER Sarkozy  ] , who admires him as a man of conviction and concrete accomplishment , [PER Kouchner  ] will not have an easy time managing his portfolio in the era of a hyperactive President who wants to be seen as in charge of everything . 
[PER Kouchner  ] 's one stumble since assuming office -- when his briefing to Parliament on the Government 's engagement of [LOC Libya  ] over the [MISC Bulgarian  ] medics demonstrated near-perfect ignorance of the facts -- is not necessarily his last . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] appear to be fashioning a coherent foreign policy -- based on a realistic view of what [LOC France  ] brings to the table , a less ideological approach to issues , greater pragmatism in achieving objectives , and less aversion to working closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] The byword for [LOC France  ] 's re-positioning vis-a-vis the [LOC U.S.  ] will continue to be " convergence , not alignment . 
" APPARENT MIND-MELD WITH [PER SARKOZY  ] ON FUNDAMENTALS: THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP , [LOC IRAN  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) When [PER Kouchner  ] agreed to become [PER Sarkozy  ] 's foreign minister , he knew he was signing up to work for a President who would favor more substantial transatlantic engagement and greater day-to-day cooperation -- including on the security dimension . 
It is an orientation he shares . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's will clearly be the decisive voice on how far [LOC France  ] is willing to go on a " reform of [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC France  ] 's relationship with it , " as he put it in his major foreign policy speech of August 27 . 
But we judge that [PER Kouchner  ] will not be the one applying the brakes , despite the Gaullist reflexes of many of the [ORG Quai  ] 's old hands . 
[PER Kouchner  ] , like [PER Sarkozy  ] , is ready to break the mold where he is convinced it serves [LOC France  ] 's interests as a medium-sized power that should maximize the twin advantages of a leading position in the [ORG EU  ] and a close , cooperative relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] Both feel fully empowered to engineer change at the beginning of their respective terms , at a time when the opposition is weak , and the blowback from daring initiatives such as [PER Kouchner  ] 's visit to [LOC Iraq  ] has been minimal . 
While [PER Sarkozy  ] has very definitely set the direction and tone on [LOC Iran  ] policy , and the [LOC Elysee  ] is managing the outreach to [LOC Tehran  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] is clearly comfortable with the hardening of the [MISC French  ] line: Three weeks after [PER Sarkozy  ] publicly warned about the " catastrophic choice between an [MISC Iranian  ] bomb and a bombing of [LOC Iran  ] ( terming only the first of these " unacceptable " ) , [PER Kouchner  ] publicly observed on Sunday that given [LOC Iran  ] 's behavior , " we must prepare for the worst , in other words , war , " and called for [ORG EU  ] sanctions against [LOC Tehran  ] . 
THREE [PER KOUCHNER  ] ISSUES: [LOC LEBANON  ] , [LOC IRAQ  ] AND [LOC KOSOVO  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Even in comparison with the peripatetic [PER Sarkozy  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] has been no slouch . 
Since assuming office in on May 19 , he has made 19 visits abroad . 
He has personally associated himself with , and publicly taken the lead on , three issues in particular: [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Arriving in [LOC Washington  ] , he will be coming off his fourth visit to the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Active across the clutch of [LOC Middle East  ] issues , he has taken headline-grabbing initiatives on [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
In both cases , he has sought to keep a distance from the [LOC U.S.  ] , while working to achieve shared objectives . 
On [LOC Lebanon  ] , his efforts to facilitate dialogue across the entire political spectrum have brought him close to [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Chirac-era  ] red lines , and a more risk-averse [LOC PARIS  ] 00003919 002 OF 006 reading of what is politically possible in [LOC Beirut  ] has led him to different tactical conclusions . 
However , remaining in synch with the [LOC U.S.  ] remains a guiding principle of his [LOC Lebanon  ] policy . 
Visiting [LOC Iraq  ] , he announced [LOC France  ] 's return as an independent actor , not as reinforcement for the [LOC U.S.  ] Declaring that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" has lost the war , " on the one hand , he re-engages [LOC France  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] on the other , calling for greater [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] involvement in support of political reconciliation and institutional reconstruction that would permit gradual [LOC U.S.  ] military disengagement . 
On [LOC Kosovo  ] , the pattern has been similar . 
A distinct voice and tactical differences with the [LOC U.S.  ] -- insisting on the need for the appearance of a credible negotiating process , including consideration of options other than independence -- are offset by a bottom-line requirement to work closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] to achieve a common strategic objective . 
KEY POLICY ISSUES: WHERE THE [MISC FRENCH  ] ARE COMING FROM --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We expect that , time permitting , [PER Kouchner  ] would want to address the range of [LOC Middle East  ] issues , [LOC Darfur  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , and [ORG NATO  ] . 
Herein follows a snapshot of where the [MISC French  ] are on these and other possible subjects of discussion , and where differences over policy or analysis lie . 
Among [PER Kouchner  ] 's top priorities since taking office are [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace , and [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Lebanon: [PER Kouchner  ] surprised many by his quick plunge into [MISC Lebanese  ] politics , organizing a national reconciliation process designed to secure agreement on a new president and a new national government consistent with [MISC UNSCRs  ] that preserve [LOC Lebanon  ] 's sovereignty and limit [MISC Syrian  ] ( and [MISC Iranian  ] ) influence . 
Our partnership with [LOC France  ] over [LOC Lebanon  ] remains a top priority for the [MISC French  ] , but we have divergent views on the stakes involved ( the [MISC French  ] fear a return to civil war more than a rolling back of gains made over the past two years to limit [MISC Syrian  ] interference ) and on tactics ( the [MISC French  ] prefer to press the [MISC Lebanese  ] to seek a candidate of " convergence " and are reluctant to give the lead to the March 14 majority ) . 
[PER Kouchner  ] in particular is wedded to a process that accords parliamentary speaker [PER Nabih Berri  ] a prominent role in reaching a solution , partly due to longstanding ties between the two men . 
He does not seem nave about [PER Berri  ] , but has been prepared to accord him a key role that we do not think is deserved . 
In his last visit to [LOC Beirut  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] challenged [PER Berri  ] to enter into dialogue with March 14 without preconditions . 
A frank discussion of the limits of our continued partnership is needed as well as our different views of the stakes and tactics to employ . 
The [MISC French  ] concede that the presidential election process will play out until late November , which argues for [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Paris  ] to stay in close and constant contact as the various [MISC Lebanese  ] factions seek to play us off against the other. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] Peace: [PER Kouchner  ] 's just-concluded visit to [LOC Israel  ] , the [LOC West Bank  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] gave him a chance to discuss our efforts at achieving progress on the [MISC Israeli/Palestinian  ] negotiations and probe for a potential [MISC French  ] role in our planned regional meeting in November . 
He will press for us to step up our efforts to ensure that [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] are ready to present evidence of a concrete accord with tangible results rather than another declaration of principles . 
In addition to asking what role interested parties like [LOC France  ] and the Quartet can play in the regional meeting ( about whose details the [MISC French  ] are impatiently waiting ) , [PER Kouchner  ] has publicly discussed a possible role for [LOC Syria  ] in such a gathering . 
This seems to be an outgrowth of [MISC French  ] policy on [LOC Lebanon  ] , which includes offering [LOC Damascus  ] a possible place at any regional meeting we would organize on [LOC Middle East  ] peace , as well as a reopening of a bilateral dialogue with [LOC Paris  ] in exchange for good behavior on [LOC Lebanon  ] during the [MISC Lebanese  ] presidential election period . 
[PER Kouchner  ] , who has publicly suggested an eventual visit to [LOC Damascus  ] is possible if [LOC Syria  ] behaves , will meet his [MISC Syrian  ] counterpart in [LOC New York  ] and probably hopes to have a clear message to deliver about possible [MISC Syrian  ] participation in the November meeting ( which [PER Kouchner  ] wants to back a week to accommodate the [MISC Lebanese  ] presidential election ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Iraq: [PER Kouchner  ] 's trip to [LOC Iraq  ] confirmed his reputation for the dramatic . 
While its paternity is uncertain , it was clearly something that [PER Kouchner  ] wanted to do and believed in -- and one which [PER Sarkozy  ] wholeheartedly [LOC PARIS  ] 00003919 003 OF 006 supported . 
Nevertheless , [LOC France  ] has dramatically " turned the page " in its relationship with [LOC Baghdad  ] , and [PER Kouchner  ] has made good on his intention to spur the [ORG EU  ] to play a more prominent role in [MISC Iraqi  ] reconstruction as part of what he hopes will be a strong multilateral effort with the [ORG UN  ] in the lead . 
The [MISC French  ] are still developing ideas , however , about what they might do bilaterally . 
[PER Kouchner  ] is deeply pessimistic about the [MISC Iraqi  ] internal political situation but has not repeated his readiness to host a reconciliation process similar to the one he launched for [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Although he has repeatedly criticized [LOC U.S.  ] military intervention to overthrow [PER Saddam Hussein  ] ( whom he nevertheless said deserved to be overthrown ) and subsequent policy ( he most recently said the [LOC U.S.  ] has already been defeated in [LOC Iraq  ] ) , [PER Kouchner  ] believes a continued [LOC U.S.  ] troop presence is vital to prevent the stark humanitarian situation becoming an all-out civil war . 
He advocates a phased withdrawal but only one accompanied by a rebuilt [MISC Iraqi  ] army and police force. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Iran: The Presidency has taken the lead on [MISC French  ] policy regarding [LOC Iran  ] , but [PER Kouchner  ] has recently and most bluntly warned that the confrontation over [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program could lead to military action ( " war , " in his words , which have left some of his handlers fretting ) . 
He and others in the [MISC French  ] government repeatedly stress that pressing ahead with ongoing diplomatic efforts ( including a possible third round of [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions ) must be exhausted before any potentially " catastrophic " resort to force . 
Before seeing you , he will have met with [MISC Russian  ] counterparts to explain [LOC France  ] 's tough line , including [LOC Paris  ] , urging of other [ORG EU  ] members to impose sanctions outside the [ORG UNSC  ] if necessary . 
Indeed , [LOC France  ] 's public hard line seems to be causing others in the [ORG EU  ] to rethink their reluctance to undertake such sanctions . 
[PER Kouchner  ] 's ministry was involved in quiet [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to open a new channel to [LOC France  ] in the nave hope of splitting [LOC France  ] from the [ORG P-5  ] 1 . 
He might raise an idea floated by one of his subordinates of a senior-level [MISC U.S./French  ] channel that might include the [LOC UK  ] to discuss possible [LOC U.S.  ] military action. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Europe/European Security  ] issues: Strengthening [MISC European  ] security is an important [PER Sarkozy  ] priority . 
He consistently claims that a strong [ORG European Security  ] and [ORG Defense Policy  ] ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) is " complementary " rather than " competitive " with [ORG NATO  ] . 
In his first major foreign policy speech on August 27 , [PER Sarkozy  ] urged [ORG EU  ] nations to accept a larger share of defense spending to overcome the shortage of [ORG EU  ] defense capabilities and cope with global security threats . 
He highlighted the imbalance in spending between [ORG EU  ] nations , stating " we cannot carry on with four countries paying for security for all the rest . 
" [ORG European Defense Agency  ] figures indicate that [LOC Britain  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and [LOC Germany  ] account for 75% of [ORG EU  ] defense expenditures ; of these four , only [LOC Britain  ] and [LOC France  ] meet the [ORG NATO  ] benchmark of 2% of GDP ( NOTE: The latest [MISC French  ] figures on defense spending vary between 1.96 and 2.42% , depending on whether the gendarmerie , a force to guarantee civil order , is included ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/NF ) NATO/France: In one of his first acts as President , [PER Sarkozy  ] launched a defense white paper commission to review [LOC France  ] , s defense and security priorities ; one component of the report ( expected in March 2008 ) is a review of [LOC France  ] , s relationship with [ORG NATO  ] . 
The defense white paper could set the stage for a re-integration into the [ORG NATO  ] military command . 
The public debate over a deeper [MISC French  ] role in the [ORG Alliance  ] was launched this month when Defense Minister [PER Morin  ] gave a speech to defense sector experts in which he openly questioned customary [MISC French  ] reticence about [ORG NATO  ] . 
At the same time , our interlocutors have uniformly cautioned against raising expectations and warned that we should not expect to see any major policy shifts in the immediate future ( likely not until the defense white paper is well under way ) . 
Many ( including , significantly , Prime Minister [ORG Fillon  ] ) remain concerned that abrupt moves toward [ORG NATO  ] could be controversial domestically , and argue that , at a minimum , [ORG ESDP  ] needs to be strengthened in parallel. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) NATO/Afghanistan: [LOC France  ] has approximately 1,000 military personnel based in [LOC Kabul  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( with additional personnel deployed in surrounding regions such as [LOC Tajikistan  ] and the [LOC Indian Ocean  ] ) . 
The [ORG GOF  ] will beef up its training support to the [ORG Afghanistan National Army  ] through deployment of 150 additional trainers for Operational [LOC PARIS  ] 00003919 004 OF 006 [ORG Mentoring  ] and Liaison teams ( OMLTs ) by the end of this year . 
For air support , the [MISC French  ] have moved three [MISC French  ] Mirage planes from [LOC Dushanbe  ] to [LOC Kandahar  ] this month , with an additional three scheduled to transfer in October . 
The September 10 [MISC French-German  ] summit reaffirmed plans by the two countries to support the [MISC German-led  ] [ORG EU  ] police training mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , although bureaucratic delays , lack of funding and a change of personnel has delayed deployment of this mission . 
On July 30 , [ORG SACEUR  ] sent a letter officially requesting six medium lift helicopters to provide rotary-wing support in ISAF ( to replace the [LOC U.S.  ] helicopters which are scheduled to depart early 2008 ) . 
This request is still under consideration by the [ORG GOF.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG NATO/Georgia:  ] The [ORG GOF  ] is ready to give a positive signal to [LOC Georgia  ] at the [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Bucharest  ] ( April 2-4 , 2008 ) , but it prefers that [ORG NATO  ] offer " something less than membership . 
" [LOC France  ] is opposed to a [LOC Georgia  ] Membership [ORG Action Plan  ] ( [ORG MAP  ] ) for several reasons , including: concern over creating additional tensions with [LOC Russia  ] , a desire to define the territorial limits of [ORG NATO  ] and worries over [LOC Georgia  ] , s internal problems with separatist regions . 
The [ORG GOF  ] notes that [ORG NATO  ] membership should not create new lines of division and that territorial conflicts should be resolved prior to membership ( i.e . 
[ORG NATO  ] required that [LOC Hungary  ] sign a border treaty with [LOC Romania  ] prior to becoming a member ) ; [LOC Georgia  ] does not meet these criteria . 
Therefore , the [ORG GOF  ] does not support the [ORG USG  ] proposal to have the [LOC NAC  ] visit [LOC Georgia  ] at the same time as the Secretary General , s visit at the beginning of October . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is considering whether [ORG NATO  ] could define with [LOC Georgia  ] a different kind of status and a different approach to security in their area , possibly combined with incentives including abolishing visa requirements with the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is convinced that [LOC Germany  ] , no less than [LOC France  ] , opposes [ORG NATO  ] membership for [LOC Georgia.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) France-EU: President [PER Sarkozy  ] was instrumental in re-activating the moribund political reform process in the [ORG European Union  ] with the June negotiation for a shortened " reform treaty " that will simplify some of the [ORG EU  ] , s operating procedures , while side-stepping efforts towards deepened political integration that doomed the [ORG EU  ] constitution in 2005 . 
This " reform treaty " must be approved by the other [ORG EU  ] members and could go through ratification over the course of 2008 . 
The [MISC French  ] will also take over the rotating [ORG EU  ] presidency from July-December 2008 and they plan to focus on immigration , energy , the environment and [MISC European  ] defense during their term . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] remains firmly opposed to [ORG EU  ] enlargement to include [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Nevertheless , he has agreed to allow negotiations to open on 30 of 35 chapters , all those compatible with both membership and association . 
He conditioned his position on [ORG EU  ] support for a " [MISC Committee of Wise Men  ] " to reflect " without taboos " on the broader questions about the [MISC European  ] future: i.e. what is the [MISC European  ] identity , what should the [ORG EU  ] , s borders be , how to handle common issues , and how deep can political integration go . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] also promotes the formation of a looser " [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] " to coordinate policies and relations with the broad spectrum of countries of the [MISC Mediterranean  ] basin . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's tactical softening on [LOC Turkey  ] surely sits well with [PER Kouchner  ] who personally favors [LOC Turkey  ] 's joining the [ORG EU  ] , something he has told us directly , and about which he has agreed to disagree with his [ORG President.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [MISC France-Germany: Thus  ] far , President [PER Sarkozy  ] appears to be keeping to the tradition of meeting regularly every couple of months with the [MISC German  ] Chancellor . 
While the summit meeting in July with [PER Merkel  ] was reportedly more tense with disagreements over [ORG EADS  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] , s blunt criticism to [MISC German  ] [PER FinMin Steinbruck  ] over [ORG EU  ] monetary policy , our interlocutors reported that the two leaders reached general agreement on major issues at the most recent September 10 meeting . 
The [MISC French  ] public supports a strong [MISC French-German  ] relationship and expects the two leaders to work together closely . 
This was reinforced when both leaders were heavily involved in reaching agreement on the shortened [ORG EU  ] " reform treaty " in June , activating hopes of a reinvigorated " [MISC Franco-German  ] " engine to lead the [ORG EU  ] . 
In what the [MISC French  ] saw as a major achievement of their Sept. 10 meeting , [PER Merkel  ] signed on to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's proposal to convene a " [MISC Committee of Wise Men  ] " to reflect on the [ORG EU  ] , s future . 
[PER Merkel  ] requested , and [PER Sarkozy  ] agreed , that presentation of the report should be delayed until December 2009 , so that it would not be presented during the 2008 [MISC French  ] presidency as a " [MISC French  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00003919 005 OF 006 vision , " and it would coincide with timing for the next [MISC European  ] commission . 
Managing the relationship with [LOC Russia  ] remains important for both [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] , with the [ORG GOF  ] acknowledging that [LOC Germany  ] faces a more acute challenge due to its closer proximity and greater energy dependence on [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Missile Defense: The [ORG GOF  ] was very interested in the latest round of [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] talks on missile defense in [LOC Paris  ] on September 10 , including progress on negotiations with [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] ( [LOC NOTE:  ] The next round of experts meetings is tentatively planned for early October prior to the meetings of Foreign and [ORG Defense Ministers  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] ) . 
The [ORG GOF  ] also agrees that many of [LOC Russia  ] , s objections to the planned system are politically driven , reflecting an outdated [MISC Russian  ] view in which it sees itself as increasingly encircled by [MISC NATO.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [MISC CFE:  ] At a recent meeting with [ORG Quad European Political Directors  ] , the [MISC French  ] expressed support for the [ORG CFE  ] regime and for moving forward towards ratification of the adapted [ORG CFE  ] reaty . 
This included support for the current [ORG USG  ] " parallel actions " plan and the [LOC U.S.  ] proposal to turn [MISC Russian  ] forces in [LOC Moldova  ] and [LOC Transnistria  ] into an international force with a [MISC Russian  ] component , as long as the requirement of eliminating ammunition was maintained . 
However , the [ORG GOF  ] is pessimistic that such efforts would succeed in keeping [LOC Russia  ] in the [ORG CFE  ] . 
[ORG French Political Director  ] [PER Gerard Araud  ] recently informed us that he had been told in [LOC Moscow  ] that the " decision is already taken " to suspend [LOC Russia  ] 's observation of [ORG CFE  ] and he added that [LOC Kislyak  ] had told him that no flank limits on [LOC Russia  ] were acceptable because it was " humiliating " that they should have such limits on their own territory . 
The [ORG GOF  ] supports the upcoming [ORG CFE Seminar  ] in [LOC Berlin  ] in early October as a chance to give the allies a chance to unify their positions and demonstrate solidarity for the [LOC U.S.  ] parallel actions plan. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Kosovo: [PER Kouchner  ] is working actively to build consensus within the [ORG EU  ] on recognition of an independent [LOC Kosovo  ] after the December 10 Troika deadline . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is reportedly optimistic about the possibility for consensus on recognition , but less so about the prospects for consensus on the legal basis for an [MISC ESDP  ] mission in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Since a new [ORG UNSCR  ] would provide an agreed basis , [LOC France  ] is still pursuing that possibility . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] is on the agenda for [PER Kouchner  ] , s meetings with [MISC Russian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] on September 17-18 , though we have been advised [PER Kouchner  ] will seek to gauge [MISC Russian  ] flexibility , not make new proposals. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Russia: [PER Kouchner  ] will have discussed a full range of topics with [MISC Russian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] in their meetings in [LOC Moscow  ] September 17-18 . 
Generally , the [ORG GOF  ] advocates an approach towards [LOC Russia  ] that falls between " complacency and confrontation . 
" While [ORG Chirac  ] 's insistence that the primacy of he [MISC Paris-Moscow  ] relationship ( in his multipolar world ) was inconsistant with even private criticism of [MISC Russian  ] behavior , either [PER Sarkozy  ] nor [PER Kouchner  ] have refrained from publicly pointing to official [MISC Russian  ] " brutality " ( [PER Sarkozy  ] 's choice of words ) . 
That said , [PER Kouchner  ] 's foreign ministry continues to remind us that [LOC France  ] and the rest of [LOC Europe  ] are a lot closer to [LOC Russia  ] than we are , and that it holds an important energy card that many [MISC Europeans  ] will ignore at their peril . 
In other words , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Europe  ] will have to continue to carefully manage [LOC Russia  ] . 
They will seek , in particular , to avoid aggravating [LOC Moscow  ] before the Dec. 10 [LOC Kosovo  ] Troika deadline . 
[LOC France  ] recognizes that [MISC Russian  ] resistance to [LOC MD  ] is politically-driven . 
While welcoming the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" parallel actions " proposal on [ORG CFE  ] , the [ORG GOF  ] views prospects for keeping [LOC Russia  ] in [ORG CFE  ] as poor , and is focused on ensuring Allied unity . 
[LOC France  ] agrees that [ORG NATO  ] should send a positive signal to [LOC Georgia  ] at the [LOC Bucharest  ] summit ; however , [LOC France  ] is looking for options other than extending the [ORG MAP  ] , due to [LOC Russia  ] , s sensitivities but also [LOC France  ] , s uncertainty about entering into an [ORG Article V  ] commitment to [LOC Georgia.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [LOC Africa  ] - [ORG Darfur:  ] The [PER Sarkozy  ] government and [PER Kouchner  ] in particular , have taken a strong interest in [MISC African  ] issues from the moment they took office . 
One of [PER Kouchner  ] 's first acts was to call for and then host the June 25 ministerial meeting on [LOC Darfur  ] . 
[LOC France  ] 's efforts have played a positive role in energizing international action . 
A follow-up meeting on [LOC Darfur  ] , to be hosted jointly by the [ORG UN PARIS  ] 00003919 006 OF 006 and [ORG AU  ] , is to take place on September 21 on the margins of the [ORG UNGA  ] , to be followed by a heads-of-state meeting of the [ORG UN Security Council  ] on September 25 , to address [LOC Africa  ] more generally . 
The latter will be chaired by President [PER Sarkozy  ] ( [LOC France  ] being the [ORG UNSC  ] President in September ) . 
The [MISC French  ] have firmly supported the deployment of the hybrid [MISC UN-AU  ] force in [LOC Darfur  ] ( [LOC UNAMID  ] ) . <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [LOC Africa  ] - [MISC Chad:  ] The [MISC French  ] have also developed a plan to place a peacekeeping mission in [LOC Chad  ] and the [LOC Central African Republic  ] , which they see as sharing many of [LOC Darfur  ] 's problems that would protect refugee and IDPs . 
The mission would have a [MISC French-led  ] [ORG EU  ] military component and a [ORG UN  ] civpol element . 
The [MISC French  ] would like the [ORG UN Security Council  ] to adopt a resolution approving such a mission ( which is a legal necessity before the [ORG EU  ] can go forward ) prior to the September 25 heads-of-state [ORG UNSC  ] meeting , with initial deployment to follow shortly thereafter . 
One stumbling block has been the issue of [ORG UN  ] funding for [MISC Chadian  ] gendarmes who would serve with the mission . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] have been working to resolve this funding issue , which largely centers on [ORG UN  ] financing rules. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] , s vision for [MISC Africa:  ] In a broader sense , President [PER Sarkozy  ] has signaled his own vision of [LOC Africa  ] , notably in a speech he gave in [LOC Dakar  ] , [LOC Senegal  ] , shortly after taking office . 
The speech was both praised and criticized in [LOC France  ] and in [LOC Africa  ] -- on the one hand , it was quite frank in advising [MISC Africans  ] that they would have to take more responsibility for their own situations and to avoid attributing all of their problems to colonialism . 
On the other hand , some observers found [PER Sarkozy  ] 's tone condescending and paternalistic , i.e. , a vestige of the very colonial attitude that he was suggesting that [MISC Africans  ] needed to put behind them . 
On balance , however , the speech , perhaps intentionally provocative , signaled [LOC France  ] 's continuing strong interest in [LOC Africa  ] but also a hope that [LOC Africa  ] and its [MISC European  ] partners could do business on a more pragmatic and less emotionally-charged basis than has been the case during much of the post-colonial period. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( S ) Colombia: In June of this year , the [MISC French  ] pushed [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] to release 200 [ORG FARC  ] prisoners in an effort to move negotiations for the release of [ORG FARC  ] hostages , namely [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] , forward . 
While this prisoner release has not resulted in negotiations by the [ORG FARC  ] , the [MISC French  ] are now backing [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , s offer to negotiate a hostage deal between the [MISC Colombian  ] government and [ORG FARC  ] guerrillas . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] has spoken by phone to [PER Chavez  ] twice over the past few weeks and [PER Chavez  ] will most likely visit [LOC France  ] in the coming months . 
That said , the [MISC French  ] want to show they are doing everything they can to liberate [PER Betancourt  ] while publicly downplaying to the extent possible a role for [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] remains a major media personality in [LOC France  ] and the [ORG GOF  ] is under a great deal of political pressure to show the government " will leave no stone unturned . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] is likely aware that without a gesture from the [ORG FARC  ] , the [MISC Colombians  ] are unlikely to make any further concessions including prisoner releases . 
[PER Kouchner  ] recently met with [MISC Colombian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Araujo  ] , and [PER Sarkozy  ] will meet with [MISC Colombian  ] president [PER Uribe  ] on the margins of the [ORG UNGA  ] on September 25 . 
[PER Betancourt  ] is reportedly high on the bilateral agenda .
