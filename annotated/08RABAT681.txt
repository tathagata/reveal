Some [MISC Moroccan/Spanish  ] experts claim that the King strategically selected [LOC Oujda  ] as the venue of his meeting with [PER Zapatero  ] because the King wanted the [MISC Spanish  ] president to speak out in favor of re-opening the nearby border with [LOC Algeria  ] , 9 miles away . 
During the visit ; however , [PER Zapatero  ] did not make any official comments related to the [MISC Algerian/ Moroccan  ] border dispute .

( [ORG U  ] ) Neither [PER El Fassi  ] nor [PER Zapatero  ] publicly broached the subject of [LOC Ceuta  ] or [LOC Melilla  ] , two enclaves under [MISC Spanish  ] rule for more than five hundred years .

[ORG COMMENT  ] 9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Spanish/Moroccan  ] relationship remains strong and positive . 
The absence of public discussion by the King or the hotly nationalist [PER El Fassi  ] of the [MISC Spanish  ] enclaves is a sign of the strength of the relationship . 
[LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Spain  ] have transcended the enclaves issue to concentrate on their rapidly growing economic ties , managing immigration ( including keeping Sub [MISC Saharans  ] out of [LOC Spain  ] ) and their vital shared interest in counterterrorism cooperation. ***************************************** Visit Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] 's Classified Website ; http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/rabat ***************************************** Riley</pre></code>
