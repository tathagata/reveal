PARKER/PETTIT  ] E-MAIL 1/4/07 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
STATE 203879 [ORG Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Alice  ] [PER G. Wells  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b and d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us January 12 that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was aware of seven [MISC North Korean  ] asylum seekers in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had passed this information during a January 10 meeting with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The seven are laborers who had been working in a timber camp in the [MISC Russian  ] [LOC Far East  ] , according to [PER Chun  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has scheduled interviews for them January 18 . 
They are currently in [LOC Moscow  ] , and they are being cared for by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who has previously facilitated contacts between [ORG UNHCR  ] and other [MISC North Korean  ] asylum seekers . 
Thus far , [ORG UNHCR  ] has not approached the [MISC Russian  ] government about this group and does not believe they are in imminent danger. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had specifically asked [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] whether resettlement to the [LOC United States  ] was an option . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] responded to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the chief concern was the safety of the asylum seekers and their rapid departure from [LOC Russia  ] , which had made [LOC South Korea  ] the best alternative in the past , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
We emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] was willing to accept [ORG UNHCR  ] referrals of [LOC North Koreans  ] and that this should be presented as an option . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed to do so. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT: Based on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] involvement , we believe this is the group in ref A . 
The [ORG GOR  ] has always indicated that it would consider the possibility of facilitating resettlement to the [LOC U.S.  ] if a specific case arose , and as long as it was handled quietly . 
If the [LOC North Koreans  ] are declared refugees and seek resettlement in the [LOC U.S.  ] , this would be the first time we would be able to raise specific cases with the [ORG GOR  ] . 
We will follow up with [ORG UNHCR  ] to ensure that [LOC U.S.  ] resettlement is presented as an option , as noted in ref [PER B. Further  ] details will be reported as they develop . 
END COMMENT .
