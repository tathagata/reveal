( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The [MISC French  ] judge investigating events concerning the 1994 [MISC Rwandan  ] genocide has dismissed the first [MISC Rwandan  ] official questioned in the case . 
[PER Rose Kabuye  ] was granted freedom of movement when the judge on September 25 lifted the international arrest warrant that was used to compel her testimony . 
She has reportedly agreed to cooperate with the investigation and may be subject to recall by the judge . 
In an effort to determine if there is a case to pursue , the judge in principle should interview the other eight [MISC Rwandans  ] subject to the original arrest warrant , although this may take place in [LOC Rwanda  ] . 
One MFA contact views this development as a positive step towards resolving the case and for improving broken [MISC French-Rwandan  ] relations , although resolving the cases involving the other eight is likely to take time . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Charlotte Montel  ] ( AF-advisor in FM [ORG Kouchner  ] 's cabinet ) on September 30 provided an update in the [PER Rose Kabuye  ] case , calling recent developments an important step in the complex legal matter involving nine senior [MISC Rwandans  ] , which arose when then-terrorism judge [ORG Bruguiere  ] in November 2006 issued his report on the events of 1994 that led to the [MISC Rwandan  ] genocide . 
[ORG Bruguiere  ] 's report contained warrants against the nine and also recommended prosecution of [LOC Rwanda  ] 's President [PER Kagame  ] for their alleged involvement in the airplane shoot-down deaths of the [MISC Rwandan  ] and [MISC Burundian  ] presidents that sparked the genocide . 
The legal case in [LOC France  ] was initiated in response to a complaint by the family of the plane 's [MISC French  ] pilot . 
[ORG Bruguiere  ] 's report caused [LOC Rwanda  ] to sever relations with [LOC France  ] , which remain severed . 
[PER Kabuye  ] was arrested in [LOC Germany  ] earlier this year pursuant to the [MISC French  ] warrant and has been questioned several times by the investigating judge ( " juge d'instruction " ) , who nonetheless granted her liberal travel privileges provided she comply with court orders , which she has done. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Montel  ] said that on September 25 , the investigating judge informed [PER Kabuye  ] that he was finished questioning her and that she was free to go , subject to the court 's recall for further testimony . 
[PER Montel  ] said that [PER Kabuye  ] agreed to cooperate with the judge 's investigation . 
[PER Montel  ] explained that the warrants [ORG Bruguiere  ] had issued were in effect arrest warrants that would allow the investigating judge to question the nine [MISC Rwandans  ] pursuant to the judge 's inquiry into the 1994 events . 
The warrants were not indictments but more in the nature of subpoenas for detailed depositions . 
One reason [LOC Rwanda  ] reacted so strongly to the warrants was the fact that the [MISC French  ] investigating judge , if he had wanted , could have gone to [LOC Rwanda  ] and asked to interview the nine , rather than making them the objects of international arrest warrants . 
4 ( C ) [PER Montel  ] said that the September 25 ruling was an important step because in releasing [PER Kabuye  ] ( subject to her cooperation and possible further testimony ) , the judge was implicitly not moving towards indicting her . 
Also , in response to the judge 's ruling , [PER Kabuye  ] 's lawyers offered motions that further investigations be carried out in [LOC Rwanda  ] , which [PER Montel  ] thought likely . 
[PER Montel  ] cautioned , however , that while this development in [PER Kabuye  ] 's case was positive and could ease [MISC France-Rwanda  ] tensions , there were still eight others whose cases needed resolution . 
[PER Montel  ] said that [PER Kabuye  ] all along firmly denied that she had deliberately allowed herself to be arrested , as a test case , " as had been reported by [MISC French  ] daily [ORG Le Monde  ] and other observers . 
[PER Montel  ] conceded that several GOF officials had quietly suggested to the [MISC Rwandans  ] that one of the nine agree to be arrested , which would allow the [MISC Rwandans  ] to see what kind of case the [MISC French  ] had against the nine . 
She repeated , however , that [PER Kabuye  ] consistently maintained that she never intended to be arrested in [LOC Germany  ] to test [LOC France  ] 's case against her and her compatriots. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Montel  ] was notably upbeat in providing her analysis of developments in the [PER Kabuye  ] case . 
We expect , however , that the rest of the case , involving the other eight , could require considerable time to resolve and that , consequently , there will likely be no change in the status of relations , unless [LOC Rwanda  ] were to alter its position , which does not appear likely . 
[PER Montel  ] did mention that the current investigative judge could , on his own motion , annul [ORG Bruguiere  ] 's warrants and carry out the investigation in [LOC PARIS  ] 00001349 002 OF 002 another manner , which might perhaps be the best course in terms of improving relations . 
However , given the vaunted independence of the [MISC French  ] judiciary , we are not confident that the judge will choose that course of action . 
END COMMENT .
