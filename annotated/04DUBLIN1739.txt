( S ) [ORG DCM  ] met with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] issues surrounding [LOC U.S.  ] use of [PER Shannon  ] airport . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that while there always has been an element of [MISC Irish  ] society that objects to the [LOC U.S.  ] military’s use of [PER Shannon  ] , the government feels increasingly under pressure . 
On a weekly basis , members of parliament question the ministers . 
While most of the criticism and pressure come from the opposition , the president of the [ORG Senate  ] , from the [MISC PM’s  ] own party , also has entered the fray periodically . 
[MISC Parliamentarians  ] draw on allegations from journalists , activists’ web sites and tail spotters to suggest the [ORG USG  ] has used [PER Shannon  ] for nefarious purposes . 
Particularly difficult have been questions in the last two weeks about a [ORG Gulfstream  ] jet that allegedly has been used to transport prisoners and allegedly had its tail number changed . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cited this allegation as both politically and legally difficult for the [ORG GOI  ] . 
The political problem is that the government’s defense of [PER Shannon  ] rests heavily on friendship with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC Irish  ] government saying it relies on the “good faith” of the [ORG USG  ] . 
He said the allegations that the tail number has been changed raise suspicions and caused confusion within the [ORG GOI  ] , along with the hope that there is a “benign” explanation about why the tail number was changed . 
He cautioned that if it were ever to be discovered that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not good on its word or had transported prisoners through [PER Shannon  ] in the context of the war on terrorism , there would be enormous political pressure on the government . 
As for the legal issue , he said that were a plane to include [PER Shannon  ] in an itinerary that also included transporting prisoners , [ORG GOI  ] lawyers might be forced to conclude that the [ORG GOI  ] itself was in violation of torture conventions . 
His colleague cited breaking press reports of [ORG ICRC  ] comments about [PER Guantanamo  ] as adding fuel to the fire. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) The [ORG DCM  ] told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the [ORG USG  ] would be in no position to respond to the detailed questions asked about particular planes , such as the [ORG Gulfstream  ] jet , but stood by its commitment to abide by [MISC Irish  ] law , consult with the [MISC Irish  ] and avoid actions that would bring embarrassment to the [MISC Irish  ] government . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that there is no/no change pending to [MISC Irish  ] policy allowing [LOC U.S.  ] use of [PER Shannon  ] , but reiterated that some ministers feel they are going out on a limb defending [LOC U.S.  ] use of [PER Shannon  ] and that the [ORG GOI  ] is counting on the fact that the word of the [ORG USG  ] is good and that the [LOC U.S.  ] has not and will not transfer prisoners through [PER Shannon  ] or engage in any other activity that would place the government in legal or political difficulty . 
He said that the government consistently says the same thing and that this must not be shown later “to have holes in it.” He also said it is critical that no “blue water” be found between statements that [MISC Irish  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] officials make . 
He said activists dissect statements and take any divergence as a sign that something is amiss . 
He said the recent assurances from the [ORG USG  ] that prisoners had not been transferred through [PER Shannon  ] was helpful , as is , in general terms , the [ORG UNSCR  ] resolution asking members to support [LOC Iraq  ] .
