( C ) Summary: The opposition [ORG Popular Party 's Economic Spokesperson  ] in Parliament [PER Miguel Arias Canete  ] predicted 2005 would be a good year for [LOC Spain  ] , but that beginning in 2006 [LOC Spain  ] 's economy would sour and imperil [LOC Spain  ] 's Socialist government . 
He declared strong respect for Minister of Economy and Finance [PER Pedro Solbes  ] and the economic team , but noted that [PER Solbes  ] faces strong challenges in shepherding [LOC Spain  ] 's budget and economy in a cabinet of more radical political heavyweights . 
[PER Arias Canete  ] expressed sympathy with respect to our biotech position , noting that he was a strong proponent of biotechnology during his previous position as Minister of Agriculture . 
He offered assistance with biotech issues with [MISC Spanish  ] deputies in the [MISC European  ] Parliament . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Economic Outlook  ] ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Arias Canete  ] characterized [LOC Spain  ] 's 2005 economic outlook as solid . 
He stated that the fiscal environment of stable spending growth and balanced budget was a gift to the Socialists ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) from the previous [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) government . 
However , he noted [LOC Spain  ] 's inflation rate of about 1.3 percent higher than the [ORG EU  ] average as an area of concern . 
He also noted that since [LOC Spain  ] was an [ORG EU  ] member and [ORG EU  ] monetary policy was predicated on the sluggish [MISC German  ] economy , [LOC Spain  ] would not be able to use monetary policy to curb its inflation . 
Cheap interest rates have contributed to the steep rise in [MISC Spanish  ] housing prices in the past few years. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [ORG PP  ] economic projections , although the outlook for 2005 is " solid " , [LOC Spain  ] 's economy will slow significantly in 2006 . 
[PER Arias Canete  ] believes a recession is probable and that the [ORG PSOE  ] government will be forced to call early elections due to the resulting economic stress . 
Minister [PER Solbes  ] and the [ORG Economic Team  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Arias Canete  ] offered high praise for [ORG PSOE  ] Minister of Economy and Finance [PER Pedro Solbes  ] . 
He noted [MISC Solbes'  ] personal professional stature as a guardian of the [ORG European Monetary Union  ] treaties in [LOC Brussels  ] and for bringing [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] to court for breaking budget deficit rules . 
[PER Arias Canete  ] believes [PER Solbes  ] , with his [ORG EU  ] experience , is truly committed to ensuring budgetary stability during his tenure. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) He was less certain , however , whether Minister [PER Solbes  ] would be able to maintain the support of President [PER Zapatero  ] and keep future efforts at increasing spending in line with his budgetary standards . 
According to [PER Arias Canete  ] 's sources , [PER Solbes  ] is regularly opposed by the President 's economic policy advisor [PER Miguel Sebastian  ] . 
[PER Sebastian  ] regularly announces new economic policy changes without [MISC Solbes'  ] comment . 
[PER Solbes  ] also faces challenges in [PER Zapatero  ] 's Cabinet . 
In the [MISC Spanish  ] system , there are multiple cabinet levels . 
The first meeting each week the Secretary of State 's meeting ( note: equivalent to [ORG Deputies' Committee  ] ) . 
According to [PER Arias Canete  ] , [PER Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez  ] , the Secretary of State for Economy and Budget is often SIPDIS outmaneuvered by [ORG Economic Advisor  ] [PER Miguel Sebastian  ] at these meetings . 
Minister [PER Solbes  ] is then forced to try to overcome the decision of the Secretaries of State in the Council of Ministers . 
[PER Arias Canete  ] is not sure [PER Solbes  ] will continue to prevail in these battles , or that he will want to keep fighting if the economy sours. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Regarding rumors that [PER Solbes  ] might not finish his entire term , [PER Arias Canete  ] noted that [PER Solbes  ] is a man of his word and that he is likely to keep his promise and serve throughout this government . 
However , if in future budgets the government pushes spending to a deficit level beyond 3 percent , breaking the [MISC EMU  ] standards , Mr. [PER Solbes  ] might consider resignation . 
[PER Arias Canete  ] noted ( somewhat jokingly ) that he would do everything he could to push [PER Solbes  ] out of office , because any [ORG PSOE  ] replacement would be a much easier political target for the [ORG PP  ] . 
[ORG Economic Reform  ] on Hold ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Arias Canete  ] mentioned several areas where economic reform was necessary , but is convinced that the Socialist government is unable or unwilling to carry through . 
The key area for reform is the labor market . 
[PER Arias Canete  ] argued that the link between inflation and wages in [LOC Spain  ] without any correlation to productivity needs to be broken . 
He also mentioned the need to improve competition in the marketplace , especially in telecoms and energy . 
Though the economic team may well support many of these changes , [PER Arias Canete  ] does not believe they will get much traction in the current government . 
He noted that most of the [ORG PSOE  ] ministers are far more left-wing in their economic philosophy than the economic team and that President [PER Zapatero  ] is not a strong leader , but a compromiser unwilling to push a policy unpopular in his own party . 
Biotech ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Arias Canete  ] sympathized with the [LOC U.S.  ] position on biotech issues . 
He mentioned that he approved several seed varieties during his tenure as Minister of Agriculture . 
He also noted that he is being taken to court along with the succeeding [ORG PP  ] Minister of Agriculture for approving biotech strains that could allegedly threaten the environment . 
[PER Arias Canete  ] believes that biotech crops are very important for [LOC Spain  ] , noting that new strains of cotton are greatly desired by farmers in the south . 
He asked us to inform him of any biotech legislation of importance that passes through the [MISC European  ] Parliament . 
He is willing to assist us by lobbying [ORG PP  ] members in the [MISC European  ] Parliament . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Arias Canete  ] is clearly interested in maintaining close ties with the [LOC United States  ] . 
He is a well-informed , articulate spokesperson for [ORG PP  ] policies . 
He provided us with a number of concise , cogent [ORG PP  ] position papers on economic issues . 
They show this group is serious , and views itself as only temporarily in opposition .
