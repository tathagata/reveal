( C ) During a friendly discussion November 19 , [MISC PolCouns  ] delivered points reftel to [PER Pereira Pinto  ] regarding our continuing dialogue with [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[PER Pinto  ] was grateful for the information and expressed continued interest in finding ways to cooperate after the [MISC Bolivian  ] elections . 
[PER Pinto  ] described the current [ORG Brazil-Bolivia  ] relationship as frustratingly difficult to manage , noting [LOC Bolivia  ] has no ambassador in [LOC Brasilia  ] , that [MISC Brazilian  ] offers of assistance have gone unanswered , and that where [LOC Bolivia  ] has agreed to training or consultations , it has sent unqualified candidates or low-level officials with no authority to make decisions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC PolCouns  ] asked whether press reports of three recent intercepts by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] ( [ORG BRAF  ] ) of drug aircraft coming from [LOC Bolivia  ] into [LOC Brazil  ] signaled greater intelligence sharing . 
[PER Pinto  ] said that he did not believe so , but acknowledged that information sharing between the [ORG BRAF  ] , federal police , and [ORG MRE  ] was not good , and that there was no systematic effort to collect statistics on what was coming across the border. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Pinto  ] 's principal preoccupation with [LOC Bolivia  ] stemmed from a [MISC Brazilian  ] federal deputy 's effort to block the donation of four helicopters to Bolivia--Brazil 's sole response to a request by [LOC Bolivia  ] for assistance after [ORG DEA  ] was expelled . 
The problem arose out of concern that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government was forcing [MISC Brazilians  ] resident in [LOC Bolivia  ] to leave the country . 
According to [PER Pinto  ] , although [LOC Bolivia  ] had two years ago required the few hundred [MISC Brazilians  ] to move out of a fifty-kilometer band along the border , they had been offered resettlement within [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] 's " roving consulate " ( a van that offers consular services to the dispersed [MISC Brazlian  ] population in the border area ) has recently found that , with the situation deteriorating , most [MISC Brazlians  ] now prefer to return to [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: Although we find that [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats posted abroad are often much more amenable to working with the [LOC United States  ] than their counterparts in [LOC Brasilia  ] , in this case , it appears that there is broad and high-level interest in working with the [ORG USG  ] . 
Even the normally prickly head of the [ORG MRE  ] transnational crimes department has conceded a need to work together on this issue . 
Nonetheless , we will need to proceed carefully on the law enforcement side to avoid activating [MISC Brazilian  ] sensitivities over sovereignty and any appearance of a less than fully equal partnership . 
End comment. - - - ARGENTINA: FOR A TROUBLESOME NEIGHBOR , MORE ATTENTION - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) With [MISC Argentine  ] President [PER Kirchner  ] having visited that morning , [PER Pinto  ] told [MISC PolCouns  ] that the visit had been important to " reduce tensions . 
" But the [MISC Argentines  ] did not understand that [LOC Brazil  ] could not overlook in an election year trade barriers that might not otherwise have been a significant issue . 
[PER Pinto  ] did not have kind words for the [ORG GOA  ] , describing [PER Kirchner  ] 's government as " authoritarian without any of the tools of authoritarianism . 
" He noted that , whereas [MISC Brazilian  ] polling showed [MISC Argentine  ] media and academic opinion had become much more positive with regard to [LOC Brazil  ] over the past year , government opinion--for which , he said , [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001360 002 OF 002 read the Foreign Ministry--was still overwhelmingly negative . 
Suffering from problems of its own making , he said , the [ORG GOA  ] was seeking to blame [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) For [PER Pinto  ] , the most notable development of the [MISC Lula-Kirchner  ] meeting had been the agreement to meet even more frequently--every 90 days , with a commission of the [MISC Brazilian  ] ministers of foreign affairs , trade ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) , and finance , and the [MISC Argentine  ] ministers of foreign affairs , economy , industry meeting every 45 days . 
Comment: The strategy bears a remarkable resemblance to [PER Lula  ] 's approach with [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] , with whom he also holds quarterly meetings . 
As the potential for conflict with neighbors rises , [PER Lula  ] sees personal , presidential-level contact , combined with more frequent ministerial-level contacts , as the best way to reduce tensions and minimize conflicts , particularly where resolution of the problems might not be possible at lower levels or in the short term . 
End comment. - - - PARAGUAY: BUSINESS AS USUAL - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Asked about how [LOC Brazil  ] saw the recent replacement of military chiefs in [LOC Paraguay  ] , [PER Pinto  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] did not see any cause for concern . 
Because the [MISC Paraguayan  ] Minister of Defense is not the most senior official in the chain of command , he said , it frequently creates rivalries that need to be managed . 
For [PER Pinto  ] , the issue of most concern continues to be the handling of thousands of so-called " Braziguayos , " [MISC Brazilians  ] who have settled , often illegally , in [LOC Paraguay  ] and whose status and rights are a constant irritant in relations .
