THE HAGUE 271 B. THE HAGUE 264 C. THE HAGUE 543 Classified By: POLECON Counselor [PER Andrew C. Mann  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The [LOC Netherlands  ] Minister of [ORG Defense ( MOD  ] ) has expressed concern over the [ORG JSF  ] second engine ( [MISC F-136  ] ) being omitted from the [LOC U.S.  ] 2010 [ORG Defense Budget  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] industry has high-value contracts supporting the development of the [MISC F-136  ] engine . 
The [ORG MOD  ] has struggled to retain the necessary support for the [ORG JSF  ] program in what has become a politically charged battle . 
Cancelling the [MISC F-136  ] program could scuttle [MISC Dutch  ] participation in [ORG JSF  ] and raise doubts about [MISC American  ] defense partnerships as we ask the [MISC Dutch  ] to stay the course with us in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
Background: ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The concept of having two competing engines for the [ORG JSF  ] dates back to the “Great Engine War , ” when [ORG Congress  ] funded the development of a second engine in 1979 for the [ORG Air Force’s  ] fighter aircraft . 
The [ORG Air Force  ] and [ORG Congress  ] cite the competition as a huge success , yielding both cost savings and a better product . 
This “standard” of competition drove a two engine solution ( [MISC F-135  ] and [MISC F-136  ] ) for the [ORG JSF  ] program . 
Participating countries in the [ORG JSF Program  ] are allowed to choose the [MISC F-135  ] , [MISC F-136  ] , or both when they issue their procurement request per the [ORG JSF  ] Production , Sustainment , and [ORG Follow-on Development  ] MOU . 
The [ORG GONL  ] believes based on the MOU they have an engine choice , and are currently in a study with [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Italy  ] to compare both engines before a placing their orders to the [ORG JSF Program  ] . 
[ORG Dutch Industry Support  ] on the [MISC F-136:  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) Two companies in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are responsible for the co-design and production of critical components on the [MISC F-136  ] . 
( [LOC Netherlands  ] industry is not participating in the development of the [MISC F-135  ] , but is seeking maintenance contracts with [ORG Pratt & Whitney  ] , the manufacturer . 
) The [MISC F-136  ] contractors ( General Electric/Rolls-Royce ) list potential [MISC F-136  ] business with the [LOC Netherlands  ] -- across the life of the program -- at over one billion dollars . 
[MISC Dutch  ] labor unions and local governments are currently applying pressure to the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , which has the pivotal vote to keep the [ORG JSF  ] alive in the [LOC Netherlands  ] by approving the purchase of the second test jet . 
The [ORG MOD  ] is currently working with [ORG Parliament  ] to obtain approval for the purchase the second test aircraft by December 2009 . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] has ensured both the [MISC F-135  ] and [MISC F-136  ] have been equally represented during this process . 
End Note . 
) Comment / Risk of Cancelling [ORG JSF  ] in the [LOC Netherlands:  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG COMMENT:  ] The [ORG JSF  ] debate in the [LOC Netherlands  ] remains politically charged , with the [ORG Parliament  ] nearly scuttling [MISC Dutch  ] participation in [ORG JSF  ] ( reftels A , B ) . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] is using the successes of the [ORG JSF  ] in [MISC Dutch  ] industry as an argument to keep the [ORG JSF  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are aware that the [LOC U.S.  ] defense budget has excluded the [MISC F-136  ] every year since 2006 , but to date [ORG Congress  ] has overturned that decision and maintained support for the [MISC F-136  ] . 
However , if the second engine does not survive the budget process , significant [LOC U.S.  ] effort will be required to keep the [MISC Dutch  ] as a partner in the program . 
Opponents of the [ORG JSF  ] , including the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( in the three-party governing coalition ) , would likely argue the [LOC U.S.  ] had changed the terms of the Qwould likely argue the [LOC U.S.  ] had changed the terms of the agreement upon which [MISC Dutch  ] participation was based and we are unreliable . 
Prospects for winning continued [MISC Dutch  ] support of the [ORG JSF  ] are dim without continuation of the [MISC F-136  ] program ( the two engine option ) . 
Furthermore , we are engaged in an delicate effort to keep the [MISC Dutch  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 . 
The [ORG Labor Party  ] has the pivotal role on this issue as well . 
When we are asking the [ORG Dutch Cabinet  ] and [ORG Parliament  ] to make a difficult decision to stay with us as partners in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , being perceived as an unreliable partner on [ORG JSF  ] could prove to be a large hurdle to overcome .
