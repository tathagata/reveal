01/11/06 [LOC PARIS  ] POINTS [LOC PARIS  ] 00002069 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR [PER JOSIAH ROSENBLATT  ] , FOR REAS ONS 1.4 B/D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: [PER Jean-Francois Ricard  ] , terrorism investigating judge for 12 years and deputy to renowned investigating judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] , is being promoted and transferred to the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] to work as chief magistrate for military penal affairs . 
Speculation abounds that [PER Ricard  ] is being groomed to replace [PER Bruguiere  ] , who is nearing the mandatory [MISC French  ] civil service retirement age of 65 . 
In a March 28 meeting with poloff , [PER Ricard  ] discussed a range of C/T issues , including the " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] " investigation , the [PER Christian Ganczarski  ] case and the conclusion of the ex-GTMO detainees investigation . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- --- CHANGES AMONG THE TERRORISM INVESTIGATING JUDGES --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ricard  ] described his new position at the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] as advisor on military jurisprudence and informal advisor on C/T matters to [ORG Defense  ] Minister [PER Alliot-Marie  ] , with the title of " magistrate general . 
" He also plans on continuing in an informal advisory role with the terrorism section of the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor 's office . 
[PER Ricard  ] said it was possible he would return in two to three years to take [PER Bruguiere  ] 's position . 
Leaving for a higher-level position , as is the case for his new job at the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , is a prerequisite to being eligible for [PER Bruguiere  ] 's job. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) When asked whether his replacement would be one of the recently hired terrorism investigating judges , [PER Ricard  ] said no . 
His replacement would likely be someone more senior who already has the confidence of the DST , RG and [ORG DGSE  ] intelligence agencies . 
[PER Ricard  ] explained that the specificity of a veteran terrorism judge like himself or [PER Bruguiere  ] is that they are shown all manner of raw intelligence , even that which can never be included in judicial investigations . 
Being trusted by the intelligence agencies with this type of information is a slow process , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
As an example , he said it was only after five years as a terrorism investigating judge that the intelligence agencies allowed him to see the full scope of raw intelligence . 
Of all the terrorism investigating judges in the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor 's office , only he and [PER Bruguiere  ] are given this latitude , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
Relationships within the [MISC French  ] intelligence and C/T world evolve slowly. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ricard  ] confirmed that [PER Bruguiere  ] was seeking a position in a future [ORG Sarkozy  ] administration , either as Minister of Interior or deputy Minister of Interior . 
Traditionally , such positions are given to elected officials ( with the notable exception of current PM [MISC Villepin  ] ) , and therefore [PER Bruguiere  ] will likely run as a UMP candidate for deputy in the third district of [LOC Lot-et-Garonne  ] ( southwest [LOC France  ] ) in the June 2007 legislative elections ( ref B ) . ------------------- " JIHADISTS TO [LOC IRAQ  ] " ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ricard  ] said the open-ended dossier on " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] " continued to dominate the workload of the terrorism investigating judges . 
Within the dossier are four separate investigations , and interest among [MISC French  ] [ORG Islamic  ] radicals in fighting " jihad " in [LOC Iraq  ] continues . 
Recently , [PER Ricard  ] said he had questioned a suspect in one of the investigations who had converted to [MISC Islam  ] in prison , and upon his release , was focused on leaving for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Iraq  ] has begun to overshadow the [MISC Israel-Palestinian  ] conflict as the obsession for many [MISC Muslim  ] prisoners , said [ORG Ricard.  ] ----------------- EX-GTMO DETAINEES ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ricard  ] confirmed that the investigation of the six ex-GTMO detainees was finished , and the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor will likely charge all of them with " terrorism conspiracy . 
" Although the maximum prison term is ten years , [PER Ricard  ] did not believe that any of the six would be given the maximum . 
The investigating judges had successfully kept the [LOC Guantanamo  ] issue out of the actual case files , but it would be impossible for the judges issuing the sentences not to take [LOC PARIS  ] 00002069 002.2 OF 002 into account the detainees' previous imprisonment at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
He considered only two of the detainees - [PER Khaled Ben Mustafa  ] and [PER Redouane Khalid  ] - to be serious threats . 
[PER Ricard  ] added that he and [PER Bruguiere  ] had fought to keep [PER Ben Mustafa  ] and [PER Khalid  ] imprisoned , but the length of their pretrial detention , coupled with their detention at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , had swayed the " liberty and detention " judge to release them on bail . 
The trial of the six ex-GTMO detainees should begin in mid-May , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
Only one detainee , [PER Brahim Yadel  ] , is still in prison. ----------------------------------------- THE INVESTIGATION OF [PER CHRISTIAN GANCZARSKI  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC German  ] convert [PER Christian Ganczarski  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] national [PER Karim Mehdi  ] were arrested in 2003 and since then have been in [MISC French  ] custody under suspicion of having ties with al-Qaeda . 
Their investigation continues , but [PER Ricard  ] said he is convinced that [PER Ganczarski  ] was aware of the planning for the 9/11 attacks . 
He mentioned a video he had seen showing [PER Osama bin Laden  ] lecturing , [PER Ganczarski  ] listening to bin [PER Laden  ] in the front row and [PER Mohammed Atta  ] , one of the 9/11 hijackers , right behind him . 
[PER Ganczarski  ] refuses to talk at all , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
" In another time , he would 've been an SS general , " [PER Ricard  ] added. ----------------------- [LOC TUNISIA  ] , [ORG GICM  ] AND [LOC LIBYA  ] ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In other updates , [PER Ricard  ] said intelligence-sharing relationships recently had become strained between [LOC Tunisia  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
The strain originated on the [MISC Tunisian  ] side , said [PER Ricard  ] , and he assumed that it was due to political calculations . 
( Comment: Since a FM [MISC Douste-Blazy  ] visit to [LOC Tunis  ] last fall , the [ORG GOF  ] has become more outspoken on human rights in [LOC Tunisia  ] , though still much less so than the [LOC U.S.  ] End comment . 
) Regarding the [MISC Moroccan  ] terrorist group [ORG GICM  ] , [PER Ricard  ] said investigations into a [ORG GICM  ] cell discovered in 2005 were wrapping up , and he expected those arrested to go to trial in September . 
Finally , the [ORG GOF  ] had picked up some signs that small terrorist groups made up of individuals from [LOC North Africa  ] are quietly using [LOC Libya  ] as a training base , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
He speculated that the [MISC Libyan  ] intelligence services are generally aware of this and working to disrupt them , but said it would likely be difficult to do so given that the groups are very small. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [LOC Tripoli  ] minimize considered .
