( C ) Summary: This message provides initial embassy thinking on how to deal with President-Elect [PER Zapatero  ] in the lead up to his government 's formation and the early stages of his administration . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has no experience in administration or foreign affairs . 
He is likely to be a difficult but manageable interlocutor and carries with him the [MISC Spanish  ] Left 's skepticism of [LOC U.S.  ] motives . 
Opposition to the war in [LOC Iraq  ] is central to [PER Zapatero  ] , s appeal to voters . 
Nonetheless a [ORG UNSCR  ] that gave the [ORG UN  ] a leading role in the [LOC Iraq  ] mission could allow [PER Zapatero  ] to save face and agree to maintain [MISC Spanish  ] forces in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Some things to bear in mind --It is important to recall that [PER Zapatero  ] , who is 43 , has no experience whatsoever in government administration . 
He has served as a member of the Parliament since he was 26. --The [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) was shocked that they won the elections and [PER Zapatero  ] and his people are scrambling to figure out what to do . 
He also made a number of campaign statements that might have come out differently had he thought he had a real chance of becoming president of the government of [LOC Spain.  ] --As leader of [LOC Spain  ] , [PER Zapatero  ] will be able to draw on some experienced [ORG PSOE  ] party operatives and experienced diplomats and economists such as [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] and [PER Miguel Sebastian  ] . 
But he will also have to make certain he does not provoke the image that he is replaying the corrupt government of [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] , the [ORG PSOE President of Spain  ] from 1982-1996 . 
So his team likely will include a mix of experienced people and newer and less experienced hands . 
The learning curve will be steep . 
[PER Zapatero  ] and his team will have a certain settling in period once the reality of government sets in. --We have already seen some 'wiggle room' in public statements on certain issues , including possibly on the pull out of [MISC Spanish  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] , s possible foreign minister , [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] indicated in the March 18 [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] that a [ORG UN  ] resolution prior to June 30 could provide the context in which [MISC Spanish  ] troops could remain . 
If by May we are beginning to negotiate a resolution and if [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] are on board , [PER Zapatero  ] might agree to leave the troops in [LOC Iraq.  ] --Zapatero will have to work to dispel the image that he won because he will appease terrorists ( or that he was elected by [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] ) . 
He will almost certainly hear from his [MISC European  ] colleagues on this issue . 
He will have to calibrate his decisions to avoid the impression that terrorists can influence his foreign policy moves. --Though terrorism and foreign policy are now front and center for [PER Zapatero  ] , many [MISC Spaniards  ] believe his main challenge will be handling the increasingly vocal nationalist tendencies in [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [MISC Basque  ] region , which could threaten the [MISC Spanish  ] constitutional order . 
[PER Zapatero  ] does not have the gravitas nor the credibility to deal with these issues effectively , many fear . 
It is not in the [LOC U.S.  ] interest to see instability in the [MISC Spanish  ] national system. --Under [PER Zapatero  ] , [LOC Spain  ] will continue to face a terrorist threat , both from [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and from [ORG ETA  ] . 
This is our most significant common challenge , on which we should seek to build a firm relationship. --On macro-economic issues , we can expect sound policies . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] initiated many of the reforms which laid the basis for [LOC Spain  ] , s current economic success , and [PER Zapatero  ] himself has credited the success of [LOC Aznar  ] , s economic policies in the past . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has already endorsed PP Minister of [ORG Economy Rato  ] to head the [ORG IMF  ] . 
There are continued grounds for cooperation in this area. --The [ORG USG  ] has worked well with previous socialist governments . 
Under [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] , [LOC Spain  ] reaffirmed its membership in [ORG NATO  ] , despite the Socialists , previous opposition to [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
We negotiated a renewal of our bilateral defense agreements . 
There is a positive history with [ORG PSOE  ] on which to build. --We will have to accept that there are some issues on which we will disagree with the [PER Zapatero  ] government . 
[PER Zapatero  ] , s political philosophy , and that of his closest associates , is grounded in the [MISC European  ] Left , s reflexive skepticism about [LOC U.S.  ] motives at best , and anti-Americanism at worst. --We have long-term interests in [LOC Spain  ] that transcend governments in power . 
[LOC Spain  ] is a [ORG NATO  ] ally , a strong and growing economic force in the [ORG EU  ] with shared common historical and linguistic links with the [ORG Americas  ] . 
Knowledge of and ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] , however , remain quite thin . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has little understanding of the [LOC U.S.  ] --Spanish democracy is still rather immature - less than 30 years old . 
The high voter turnout last week was a victory for democracy in [LOC Spain  ] . 
We should avoid castigating [MISC Spanish  ] voters and allow them to come to their own conclusions about the government that they have elected , albeit under extraordinary circumstances. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Our overall approach --We believe it is in [LOC U.S.  ] interest , both for relations with [LOC Spain  ] and more broadly in [LOC Europe  ] and in the [LOC Iraq  ] Coalition that we allow [PER Zapatero  ] some time before we come to conclusions about steps he will take , including on [LOC Iraq.  ] --The public line the [LOC White House  ] and the [ORG Department have  ] thus far taken , for example in the [LOC White House  ] and [ORG Department briefings of March  ] 16 , is working and we can already see it resonating through opinion pieces in [MISC Spanish  ] media . 
This will help us avoid an unhelpful U.S.-vs- [PER Zapatero  ] image that may be difficult to dispel later on when some rapprochement might be possible or needed by us or [LOC Spain  ] for other reasons. --Rather , we should emphasize our long-term interests in and alliance with [LOC Spain  ] , our good relations with the previous [ORG PSOE  ] government , our shared interest combating terrorism , the strength of our economic relations and our shared interest in repairing strained transatlantic relations ( the theme here is that [PER Zapatero  ] need not choose between [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC United States  ] ) . --We should allow other [MISC European  ] leaders to express their concerns to [PER Zapatero  ] about the appearance of giving in to terrorism . 
The views of [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] carry particular weight with [PER Zapatero  ] . 
We should offer our support and advice in the effort against terrorism , and should continue to do so at the highest levels. --We should also emphasize that transatlantic relations and close ties with [LOC Europe  ] are not either/or propositions . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] strongly supports [MISC European  ] integration and enlargement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) It will be important that the [ORG USG  ] seek to engage [PER Zapatero  ] and his new team at senior levels as soon as possible , and continue practical areas of [LOC U.S.  ] - [MISC Spanish  ] cooperation that are outside of the difficult issues such as [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Some suggested practical steps: --Secretary Powell connect with probable [ORG PSOE  ] Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] as soon as possible. --Presidential letter to [PER Zapatero  ] as soon as he is invested ( probably in late April ) ; second congratulatory phone call as soon as he is in office. --Offer high-level intelligence briefing to [PER Zapatero  ] on counter-terrorism and other key world issues. --Suggest that [PER Zapatero  ] would be welcome in [LOC Washington  ] as soon as he is able to visit. --Engage at high levels on counter-terrorism cooperation , with a visit by Secretary Ridge to meet with his counterpart ( under new ministry name of [ORG Ministry of Security  ] ) once the new government is invested , and follow up at other levels immediately. --Suggest regular high-level and working-level consultations with new MFA on key issues - [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Latin America  ] , [ORG UN Security Council  ] issues , human rights , common threats and challenges . 
Public diplomacy outreach the primacy and breadth of the [LOC U.S.  ] - [ORG EU  ] relationship will also be important. --Defense issues: [LOC Spain  ] reaffirmed its membership in [ORG NATO  ] under [ORG PSOE  ] government . 
We should continue our good level of defense dialogue , contacts , and cooperation , including in the [LOC Balkans  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; dialogue on [LOC Iraq  ] if we get a new [ORG UN  ] resolution . 
Continue " business as usual " with military-military contacts. --Terrorism Finance: The events of March 11 represent an opportunity to persuade [LOC Spain  ] to take a greater leadership role on these issues in the [ORG EU  ] and elsewhere , particularly in terms of assistance . 
[LOC Spain  ] had proposed hosting a terrorism finance conference early this year . 
We should convey our willingness to support such a conference should the government wish to do so . 
We should also continue our willingness to consider [LOC Spain  ] for standing membership in the [LOC CTAG.  ] --Iraq [MISC Contracts:  ] The [MISC Spanish  ] private sector continues to show interest in and frustration with the contracting process . 
We believe [MISC Spanish  ] companies have a lot to offer . 
We recommend going ahead with tentative plans to have the [LOC CPA  ] , s [ORG Program Management Office  ] ( [ORG PMO  ] ) brief on subcontracting ( sponsored by a private sector entity ) in late April as currently planned . 
It will demonstrate the possible benefits of cooperation. --Trade Issues: We recommend signaling to the new trade team a willingness to consult on the [LOC Doha Round  ] and progress in the [LOC FTAA  ] - a likely area of continued interest for the new government. --Housing: [PER Zapatero  ] has already signaled that housing will be a key issue for his government and has already said he will create a housing ministry . 
Based on the [ORG U.S.-Spain Housing  ] forums which took place under former [ORG HUD  ] Secretary [PER Martinez  ] , leadership with the [ORG Ministry of Public Works  ] ( where housing currently stands ) suggest a dialogue with [ORG HUD  ] as soon as this ministry is established , building on ties already created , many of which at the working level will remain. --R&D/S&T/Productivity: There is a wide scope for increased [MISC R&D  ] cooperation given that the [ORG PSOE  ] platform included a pledge to significantly increase the amount of [MISC R&D  ] spending . 
Along the same lines , improving worker productivity is another key [ORG PSOE  ] pledge . 
As a leader in this area , [LOC U.S.  ] may be able to share experiences with the new government. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Possible [ORG PSOE  ] response --Zapatero likely will prove an inexperienced partner . 
There are a number of issues on which he will clearly differ from [PER Aznar  ] , but there are areas on which we can build on long-term cooperative efforts . 
What will change --From the [ORG PSOE  ] side , we can expect some initial reservations about our engagement overtures . 
But as the reality of government sets in , [PER Zapatero  ] and his team may welcome a matter of fact approach from us focused on practical steps in areas on which we can agree. --Zapatero , s [MISC European  ] focus will be a key element of his foreign policy . 
He has made it clear he intends to follow the lines of [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] on most issues . 
He has already said that he will drop [PER Aznar  ] , s insistence in the [ORG EU  ] constitution debate on maintaining the [LOC Nice  ] treaty voting formulas . 
Again , though , as [PER Zapatero  ] realizes he is governing one of [LOC Europe  ] , s fastest growing economies , he will quickly find that on some issues [LOC Spain  ] will want to have a voice that is separate from those of [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] . 
But as our relationship with [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] evolves , we may find areas of opportunity with [LOC Spain  ] under [ORG PSOE  ] as well .
