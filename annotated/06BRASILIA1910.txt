( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Charge and [MISC PolCouns  ] delivered ref A demarche to senior GOB officials , stressing [ORG USG  ] concerns about the 14 July 2006 decision by [LOC Brazil  ] 's national refugee commission ( [ORG CONARE  ] ) to grant refugee status to suspected [ORG FARC  ] terrorist [PER Francisco Antonio Cadena Collazos  ] ( refs B and D ) , despite an outstanding extradition request for [PER Cadena  ] from [LOC Colombia  ] 's government ( [ORG GOC  ] ) and [LOC Brazil  ] 's obligation to deny safe haven to terrorist under [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] 1373 . 
Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Antonio  ] de [PER Aguiar Patriota  ] and other senior [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) officials said the decision by [ORG CONARE  ] had been complex and laborious , with " humanitarian " factors weighing heavily . 
They indicated [ORG CONARE  ] , with strong encouragement from the [ORG UNHCR  ] representative , had not regarded [PER Cadena  ] as a " terrorist " but as a refugee from an " internal armed conflict , " which they claim is the approach that consistently has been taken by [ORG CONARE  ] to more than 300 other [MISC Colombians  ] settled in [LOC Brazil  ] as refugees . 
Luiz [PER Paulo Barreto  ] , [ORG CONARE  ] 's president and the second-ranking official in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Justice Ministry  ] , told [MISC PolCouns  ] that the committee had deliberated for nearly a year ( vice the 30 days typical in other refugee cases ) , had considered the [ORG GOC  ] legal case against [PER Cadena  ] as weak , saw the timing of the 2005 extradition request for [PER Cadena  ] ( who has lived in [LOC Brazil  ] since 1992 ) as driven by election politics in [LOC Colombia  ] , and had researched [PER Cadena  ] 's history in vain for any indication that he was a [ORG FARC  ] military commander instead of the ideological commissar , priest and political representative he claims to be . 
Despite credible reporting to the contrary , [PER Barreto  ] denied there had been political pressure on [ORG CONARE  ] to grant refugee protection to [PER Cadena  ] , and said he would be prepared to revoke [PER Cadena  ] 's refugee status " in a minute " if ( 1 ) [PER Cadena  ] is caught in a lie in his petition , ( 2 ) does not fulfill the conditions of his status , ( 3 ) the [ORG GOC  ] appeals to [ORG CONARE  ] with compelling additional information . 
[PER Barreto  ] also said he would be willing to personally receive and assume responsibility for protecting any [ORG USG  ] intelligence information regarding [PER Cadena  ] that has a bearing on his refugee claim and his history with the [ORG FARC  ] in [LOC Colombia  ] .

[ORG Foreign Ministry  ] Demarches ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG DCM  ] ( serving as Charge at the time ) made ref A demarche to Ambassador [PER Antonio de Aguiar Patriota  ] , [ORG MRE  ] Under Secretary for Political Affairs , on 4 September . 
[ORG DCM  ] SIPDIS stressed that the [ORG CONARE  ] decision appeared at odds with [MISC Brazilian  ] commitments under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1371 . 
[PER Patriota  ] did not appear to be very familiar with the details of the [PER Cadena  ] decision , but indicated he had discussed it with Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] and others . 
He said that , according to the [ORG MRE  ] representative in [ORG CONARE  ] , the [ORG UNHCR  ] representative in [ORG CONARE  ] had pressed hard to grant refugee status , in what had been an extensive and " impassioned " process in the commission . 
He noted that some of the key considerations were " humanitarian " -- i.e. , that [PER Cadena  ] has lived in [LOC Brazil  ] peacefully for over 15 years and has a [MISC Brazilian  ] wife and child. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC PolCouns  ] followed up with a second demarche on 5 September to the [ORG MRE  ] 's Assistant Secretary for [ORG International Organizations  ] , Ambassador [PER Maria Luiza Veotti  ] . 
[PER Veotti  ] was joined by [PER Marcus Fagundes  ] , Chief of the [ORG OAS Division  ] and an alternate representative for the ministry on the [ORG CONARE  ] board . 
[MISC PolCouns  ] emphasized that the [ORG USG  ] had no intent to interfere in [MISC Brazilian  ] legal processes , but noted USG dismay with the [PER Cadena  ] decision and questioned how the [ORG GOB  ] could square this decision in view of its obligations under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1371. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Veotti  ] emphasized that [ORG CONARE  ] classified [PER Cadena  ] as a refugee , and is not a beneficiary of political asylum . 
Refugee status is granted solely and independently by [ORG CONARE  ] , [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001910 002.2 OF 003 which includes [ORG GOB  ] representatives from the justice and foreign ministries , as well as [ORG UNHCR  ] and civil society and faith-based [ORG NGOs  ] . 
Political asylum is a national process , in which the [ORG GOB  ] would be directly involved , but [PER Cadena  ] 's request was for refugee status , and was sent to [ORG CONARE  ] . 
As a refugee in [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Veotti  ] affirmed that [PER Cadena  ] cannot be extradited , and the judiciary 's role at this stage is essentially passive , she said . 
If refugee status is revoked for any reason by [ORG CONARE  ] , extradition can again be contemplated by the courts . 
[PER Veotti  ] reiterated [PER Patriota  ] 's description of the [ORG CONARE  ] deliberation as a laborious one in which humanitarian issues emerged as paramount . 
She said it was important to note that [ORG CONARE  ] " never defined or characterized [PER Cadena  ] as a terrorist , " but rather as a [MISC Colombian  ] " involved or affected by the internal armed conflict in his country , and who feared death , harm or persecution , in accordance with the 1951 [ORG UN  ] definition on which [ORG CONARE  ] bases its proceedings . 
" This is the same context in which [ORG CONARE  ] has approached other [MISC Colombian  ] refugee seekers in [LOC Brazil  ] , she added . 
[MISC PolCouns  ] noted that he would be seeing the president of the [ORG CONARE  ] board that adjudicated [PER Cadena  ] 's appeal , and [PER Veotti  ] urged poloff to seek more detailed clarifications in that meeting . 
[ORG CONARE  ] President ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Justice Ministry  ] Executive Secretary ( Deputy Minister-equivalent ) Luiz [PER Paulo Barreto  ] met with [MISC PolCouns  ] on 6 September to receive ref a demarche and discuss the [PER Cadena  ] issue . 
[PER Barreto  ] , in addition to being the senior career legal officer at the ministry , is the President of [ORG CONARE  ] and chairs its deliberations . 
[PER Barreto  ] is a long-time and cooperative contact of the Embassy on a range of law enforcement and counter-terrorism issues . 
Requesting confidentiality on our part , and breaking the official SIPDIS silence that normally surrounds [ORG CONARE  ] decisions on refugees , he outlined the factors weighing in [ORG CONARE  ] 's handling of [PER Cadena  ] 's refugee appeal: -- [PER Barreto  ] said the committee regarded the [ORG GOC  ] allegation and extradition request against [PER Cadena  ] as legally specious . 
Noting that the crime alleged had been committed in 1991 , and that the extradition request to [LOC Brazil  ] had been lodged only in 2005 , [PER Barreto  ] claimed the case appeared to hinge entirely on the testimony of one recently-revealed witness , who [MISC Brazilian  ] sources indicate has had his sentence reduced in [LOC Colombia  ] and received financial compensation in exchange for accusing [PER Cadena  ] . 
[ORG CONARE  ] interviewed [PER Cadena  ] extensively , and he denied the murder allegations and claimed that he was in [LOC Venezuela  ] on the date of the 1991 attack on the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG National Police  ] base in which the murders occurred . 
[PER Barreto  ] acknowledged that [PER Cadena  ] had no one to corroborate his denials . 
-- [PER Barreto  ] said [ORG CONARE  ] viewed the [ORG GOC  ] 's interest and timing in pursuing [PER Cadena  ] 's extradition as being driven by domestic political factors in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER Barreto  ] said that [PER Cadena  ] had resided in [LOC Brazil  ] since 1992 , but that during that time he had returned on occasion to [LOC Colombia  ] , in some cases with the consent of the [ORG GOC  ] . 
[PER Barreto  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] had official information , supported by [PER Cadena  ] 's own testimony , that [PER Cadena  ] has occasionally served in a negotiator role between the [ORG GOC  ] and [ORG FARC  ] , most recently in 2000 . 
[ORG CONARE  ] questioned why previous [ORG GOC  ] administrations had seemed to regard [PER Cadena  ] as innocuous or even tacitly supported his role as a dialogue facilitator , allowing him to enter and leave [MISC Colombian  ] territory , but the [ORG Uribe  ] government -- in an election year -- had suddenly sought extradition . 
[PER Barreto  ] claimed that the [ORG GOC  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] Embassy 's interventions with [ORG CONARE  ] regarding the case had virtually ceased when [ORG Uribe  ] was re-elected . 
( Comment: That is a specious argument given the fact that refugee status was granted to [PER Cadena  ] less than 2 months after [ORG Uribe  ] 's re-election . 
End comment . 
) -- [PER Barreto  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] , including its intelligence service and military , had assisted [ORG CONARE  ] over several months in " exhaustively researching " [PER Cadena  ] 's history in [LOC Colombia  ] with the [ORG FARC  ] , and had found no information that supported [ORG GOC  ] allegations that [PER Cadena  ] was a [ORG FARC  ] field commander capable of [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001910 003.2 OF 003 leading an attack on a military base . 
[PER Cadena  ] claims to have been a political commissar , teacher , and priest for [ORG FARC  ] in [LOC Colombia  ] , and later an informal representative for the group in [LOC Brazil  ] , but not a combatant , much less a commander . 
[PER Barreto  ] claimed the information developed by [ORG CONARE  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] could not disprove that position ( he noted the only picture the [ORG GOB  ] had obtained of [PER Cadena  ] in [ORG FARC  ] uniform is 30 years old and shows him holding a bible in one hand and a gun in the other ) . 
-- [PER Barreto  ] noted that there are 350 [MISC Colombians  ] living in refugee status in [LOC Brazil  ] , re-settled after successfully convincing [ORG CONARE  ] that they faced threats related to the country 's internal conflict if they returned . 
Some have been resettled at [ORG GOC  ] requests , others have applied for refugee status on their own , and they come from the ranks of the [MISC Colombian  ] security forces , paramilitaries and guerrillas , as well as ordinary citizens . 
These include , [PER Barreto  ] said by way of a contrasting example to [PER Cadena  ] , two former [MISC Colombian  ] army soldiers who killed [ORG FARC  ] commanders during a fire fight , but who could not be guaranteed safety from reprisals by the [ORG GOC  ] once they demobilized . 
Noting that [ORG CONARE  ] took nine months to consider the [PER Cadena  ] case - versus the one month timeframe for most refugee decisions - [PER Barreto  ] said the committee had painstakingly weighed all the information . 
But in the end , he claimed [PER Cadena  ] had made a convincing case to [ORG CONARE  ] that he faced a well-founded fear of death at the hands of paramilitary elements should he return to [LOC Colombia  ] , which overshadowed the [ORG GOC  ] allegation and extradition request , which appeared questionable on several points to [ORG CONARE  ] , as noted above. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In response to a direct question from [MISC PolCouns  ] , [PER Barreto  ] indicated that [ORG CONARE  ] had not suffered political pressure from any source in evaluating the case . 
He added that [PER Cadena  ] 's status in [LOC Brazil  ] is contingent on his fulfilling his obligations as a refugee ( i.e. , no further political activism on [MISC Brazilian  ] soil , rupture of his ties to [ORG FARC  ] ) , and that if [ORG CONARE  ] were to be presented with compelling evidence that [PER Cadena  ] had lied in any aspect of his petition , [PER Barreto  ] would recommend to the committee " in a minute " that his status be revoked and the legal path opened for extradition . 
[PER Barreto  ] indicated [ORG CONARE  ] is open to further appeals and new information from the [ORG GOC  ] about the case . 
He also invited the [ORG USG  ] to provide any relevant information it might have regarding [PER Cadena  ] directly to [PER Barreto  ] , undertaking to personally assume responsibility for appropriate security and handling of the information should it involve intelligence sources and methods. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) Comment . 
The [ORG GOB  ] officials demarched , especially [PER Barreto  ] , provided a cogent explanation for the [PER Cadena  ] decision , although from our perspective not a particularly credible one . 
They evidenced understanding for the points in our demarche , were frank and not defensive in their reactions , and had ready answers that seemed to reflect an exhaustive deliberative process conducted within the expected [ORG UNHCR  ] parameters . 
None of that changes our view , per previous sensitive reporting , that the [ORG CONARE  ] decision was driven largely by heavy pressure from the very top of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , and that the [ORG GOB  ] members of [ORG CONARE  ] ultimately yielded to that pressure ( we think the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG NGO  ] members were likely disposed in that direction in any event ) . 
That said , if the [ORG GOC  ] is prepared to fight this , it needs to develop the strongest , most detailed possible legal case against [PER Cadena  ] on the specific charges relating to his alleged command of the attack on the [MISC CNP  ] base in 1991 and the two deaths that resulted . 
Coupling that with any further information or intelligence that the [ORG GOC  ] or [ORG USG  ] assets can develop on [PER Cadena  ] 's history in [ORG FARC  ] military actions would also be useful .
