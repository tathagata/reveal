( C ) Summary . 
The Ambassador called on FM [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] on December 22 to review the progress made in [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations over the last six months and to identify areas that remained problematic . 
He said the [MISC Spanish  ] ship/plane sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] had undermined progress in other areas , particularly given the mixed messages we received from the [MISC Spanish  ] government in the runup to the conclusion of the deal . 
[PER Moratinos  ] acknowledged the damage inflicted by the episode , but insisted that he remained in charge of [LOC Spain  ] 's foreign relations and wanted to find areas to work more closely with the [ORG USG  ] , particularly in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He complained that the [ORG USG  ] seemed to hold [LOC Spain  ] to a different standard than other [ORG EU  ] countries and allowed disagreements on some issues to overshadow [MISC Spanish  ] contributions on others , such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [ORG BMENA  ] . 
He expressed disappointment that Secretary Rice had been unable to attend the [MISC Euro Mediterranean Summit  ] in November and noted the strong interest of Vice President [PER Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega  ] in visiting the [LOC U.S.  ] in the near future . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that bilateral relations had improved substantially over the last six months , and there would have been even more progress had it not been for [LOC Spain  ] 's sale of ships and planes to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He assured [PER Moratinos  ] that the [ORG USG  ] knew that the [MISC Spanish  ] MFA had made a good faith effort to derail the weapons deal , but had been outflanked by [PER MOD Jose Bono  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] acknowledged the basic facts of the issue and said that both he and Deputy FM [PER Bernardino Leon  ] had believed they had successfully turned off the aircraft component of the sale at the time they approached the Ambassador . 
However , [PER MOD Bono  ] did eventually win the internal debate and proceed with the sale. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said it had been disconcerting for the [ORG USG  ] to have such differing messages from the [MISC Spanish  ] government regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
The Ambassador underscored his need to be certain that his primarily [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutor ( whom he understood to be [PER Moratinos  ] ) could speak for the government on the most critical and sensitive issues . 
Otherwise , the [ORG Embassy  ] 's credibility in [LOC Washington  ] would be eroded , to the detriment of all . 
[PER Moratinos  ] insisted that he spoke for the government on foreign affairs and , press reports to the contrary , had the full confidence of President [PER Zapatero  ] ( [ORG COMMENT:  ] [MISC Spanish  ] media reported rumors that [PER Zapatero  ] had been displeased with the limited attendance and impact of the [MISC Euro Mediterranean Summit  ] in [LOC Barcelona  ] in November and was considering replacing [PER Moratinos  ] . 
Some in the diplomatic corps have also speculated on no [MISC Moratinos'  ] eventual replacement , but we have reason to place much stock in this latest version . 
END COMMENT ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Continuing on [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said that there was much the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Spain  ] could still do together despite friction over the sales , and that such cooperation fell squarely within the purview of the MFA . 
He said the [MISC Spanish  ] government was concerned about the continuing anti-democratic drift of the [ORG Chavez  ] government and understands that organizations such as the [ORG NGO  ] " [ORG Sumate  ] " need outside support . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] would continue to monitor democratic conditions in [LOC Venezuela  ] and lend its support whenever possible to steer events in a positive direction. //SPANISH ANGST OVER BILATERAL " VISUALS " // <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Adopting a more severe tone and saying he was delivering a message as Foreign Minister , [PER Moratinos  ] complained that the [ORG USG  ] treated [LOC Spain  ] differently than other [ORG EU  ] countries , for example " singling out " [LOC Spain  ] on weapons sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] when other [MISC European  ] countries were undertaking similar sales with no impact on their bilateral relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] He wondered when the [ORG USG  ] 's goalposts for improved relations with [LOC Spain  ] would remain constant . 
" We do so much with you on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and [ORG BMENA  ] , yet one misstep and we're back starting over , " he lamented. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] asked whether it would be reasonable to expect improved visuals in the bilateral relationship . 
The Ambassador noted that Secretary Rice did not have a visit to [PER Madrid  ] on her agenda and would probably not visit in the first part of 2006 . 
The Ambassador said that if we had seen greater progress on issues such as [LOC Venezuela  ] , we may have been able to envision higher-level contacts , but at this point such meetings seem doubtful . 
He noted that comments such as those made December 18 by President [PER Zapatero  ] taunting the [ORG Popular Party  ] for its close relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] were not helpful and undermined those who said that the [MISC Spanish  ] government had moved away from using anti-Americanism for domestic political gain. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Returning to [LOC Latin America  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] reiterated [LOC Spain  ] 's readiness to work with the [ORG USG  ] on issues of mutual concern . 
He said democracy promotion and dealing with populist leaders such as [PER Evo Morales  ] posed a serious challenge to all of us . 
The Ambassador agreed , noting that we had congratulated [PER Morales  ] on his victory and hoped that he would govern democratically . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] could work with the [ORG USG  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] ( he did not elaborate ) . 
He noted Deputy FM [PER Leon  ] 's good meetings with [ORG USG  ] counterparts during his recent visit to [LOC Washington  ] and said he looked forward to furthering our joint agenda during the upcoming visit of [ORG WHA A/S  ] [PER Tom Shannon.  ] //SPANISH VP WANTS TO VISIT U.S.// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] resurfaced the idea of having Vice President [PER Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega  ] visit the [LOC U.S.  ] soon ( [ORG REF  ] B ) , saying he believed it was important for both our leaderships to understand where our common interests lie . 
He said the Vice President is very interested in making this visit and hoped the [ORG Embassy  ] could work with the [MISC Spanish  ] government to support the visit and arrange a strong agenda . 
[PER Moratinos  ] reiterated his disappointment that Secretary Rice had been unable to attend the [MISC Euro Mediterranean Summit  ] , noting that he had worked hard to get the invitation for her despite [LOC UK  ] resistance to the idea .
