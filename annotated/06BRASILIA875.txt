( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] has a close relationship with [LOC Cuba  ] and the [ORG GoB  ] does not publicly criticize the [MISC Castro  ] regime 's human rights policies . 
President [PER Lula  ] implied criticism of the state of democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] during an April 2005 interview in which he told the press that " [LOC Brazil  ] can help build a democratic process in [LOC Cuba  ] " and that " we have much to do for democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" Neither [PER Lula  ] nor other senior figures in the [ORG GoB  ] , however , have repeated such criticisms during the last six months . 
The [ORG Lula Administration  ] argues that engagement , rather than isolation , is more likely to change [LOC Cuba  ] 's behavior ; it further states it has been critical of the [MISC Castro  ] regime 's actions behind the scenes . 
The [ORG GoB  ] , however , has a general aversion to meddling in the internal affairs of other countries and routinely opposes " single country " resolutions at the [ORG United Nations  ] , including those aimed at [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] media and [ORG NGOs  ] are much less hesitant to criticize the [MISC Castro  ] regime pointedly and some have taken the [PER Lula  ] administration to task for its close relationship with [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In 2005 [MISC Brazilian  ] media published allegations that [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) , some key members of which sought refuge in [LOC Cuba  ] from persecution during [LOC Brazil  ] 's military dictatorship , allegedly received from the [MISC Cuban  ] government a campaign contribution during the 2002 presidential elections . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] cash contribution was variously reported to have ranged from [MISC US$1.4  ] to [MISC US$3  ] million , depending on the source . 
At that time the media interviewed several self-described witnesses to parts of the transaction , but although the case has received occasional media mention since then , no evidence substantiating the claims emerged during the last six months. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We know of no high level [ORG GoB  ] diplomatic visits to [LOC Cuba  ] during the last six months . 
[MISC Cuban  ] Vice Minister for Higher Education [PER Eduardo Cruz Gonzales  ] reportedly visited [LOC Brasilia  ] on April 28 and met with the [MISC Brazilian  ] education minister . 
[PER Cruz  ] 's visit reportedly included promotion of a scientific exchange program with [MISC Brazilian  ] academic institutions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the trade front , [LOC Brazil  ] supports a trade agreement between [LOC Cuba  ] and the [MISC Mercosul  ] customs union , of which [LOC Brazil  ] is the largest member . 
The [ORG GoB  ] does not expect [LOC Cuba  ] to become a full member of [MISC Mercosul  ] . 
According to [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] contacts , the conclusion of the [LOC Cuba  ] agreement is a priority for 2006 . 
Work to consolidate existing trade agreements between [LOC Cuba  ] and the individual [MISC Mercosul  ] members is already complete , paving the way for discussions on how to expand them into a full-fledged , goods-only , free-trade agreement with the bloc. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Bilateral [MISC Brazilian  ] trade with [LOC Cuba  ] grew to [MISC US$  ] 284 million in 2005 , up from [MISC US$177.2  ] million in 2004 . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] 2005 exports of [MISC US$245.5  ] million to [LOC Cuba  ] were led by exports of auto parts , soybean oil , soybeans , chicken parts , powdered milk , ethyl alcohol and coffee . 
2005 imports from [LOC Cuba  ] of [LOC US$38.9  ] million were dominated by nickel , medical products , [LOC Portland  ] cement , aluminum scrap for recycling , insecticides , cigars and vaccines . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Development Bank  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) provides trade finance lines to [MISC Brazilian  ] companies , including those trading with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Over the period 2001-2003 , the most recent data available , [ORG BNDES  ] provided [MISC US$52.3  ] million in export credits to finance the export of automobiles and buses to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Local accounts suggest that potential [ORG BNDES  ] export credits for [LOC Cuba  ] are under-utilized. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post is unaware of significant new [MISC Brazilian  ] investments in [LOC Cuba  ] over the last six months . 
The most recent data [ORG Central Bank  ] data available , for 2004 , shows that [MISC Brazilian  ] companies held investments valued at [MISC US$19  ] million in [LOC Cuba  ] .
