( U ) During a March 10 courtesy call by Consul General , [PER Claudio Cardinal Hummes  ] spoke at length of the successes and failures of the [PER Lula  ] government ; shared his views on the competition between [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Mayor [PER Serra  ] and Governor [PER Alckmin  ] for the presidential nomination of the [ORG Brazilian Social Democracy Party  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) ; and stressed that contrary to popular belief , the [MISC Catholic  ] Church as an institution does not oppose the [ORG Free Trade Area  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG FTAA  ] ) and in fact sees such agreements as necessary , but believes that any agreement must be thoroughly discussed and equitable for all parties . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------- [ORG LULA GOVERNMENT: ACCOMPLISHMENTS  ] , BUT DISAPPOINTMENT TOO --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Consul General ( [ORG CG  ] ) , accompanied by [PER Poloff  ] , paid a courtesy call March 10 on Dom [PER Claudio Cardinal Hummes  ] , Archbishop of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and leader of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
When queried on his views on the current political scene , [PER Hummes  ] said [PER Lula  ] 's government has been an important milestone for [MISC Brazil:  ] a democratic government led by a worker , with major accomplishments to its credit such as macro-economic stability , improvement of [LOC Brazil  ] 's international image , and payment of the country 's foreign debt . 
Obviously , not all has been so positive . 
The Cardinal knew [PER Lula  ] from the time when both were working in their respective fields in the [ORG ABC  ] ( [PER Santo Andre  ] , [ORG Sao Bernardo  ] dos [PER Campos  ] , [LOC Sao Caetano  ] do Sul ) industrial suburbs south of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] during the time of the military dictatorship ( see ref A for complete biographic information ) , and he knew [PER Lula  ] wanted to do more on the social front to improve conditions for workers and the poor . 
He knew for a fact [PER Lula  ] was disappointed not to have created more jobs . 
" [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] " ( which involves conditional transfer payments to the poor ) was a good program ; it was true , as critics had pointed out , that it didn't lift people out of poverty , but it was effective as an emergency measure for the very needy . 
The fundamental problem , [PER Hummes  ] said , was that [LOC Brazil  ] hadn't grown enough . 
High interest rates and high taxes had prevented it from keeping pace with other emerging economies like [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC Mexico  ] . 
If this could be changed , [LOC Brazil  ] would be ready to move forward. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Then there was the corruption scandal . 
[PER Lula  ] didn't deserve this , said [PER Hummes  ] . 
This was not to say that he really hadn't known anything of what was going on , as he claimed . 
But [PER Lula  ] had been badly served by people around him with their own agendas , especially former Chief of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] . 
That agenda was to maintain the [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG Partido  ] dos Trabalhadores - [ORG PT  ] ) in power , an objective that required a great deal of money . 
To [PER Dirceu  ] , the ends justified the means . 
[PER Dirceu  ] , who is a very rational , astute political operator , wanted to be [PER Lula  ] 's successor , and he used the powers of government , including the more than 20,000 jobs to be filled by presidential appointees ( " unjustified in a democracy , " [PER Hummes  ] said ) to that end . 
Ironically , [PER Dirceu  ] 's activities were eventually exposed by [PER Roberto Jefferson  ] , ( a federal deputy in a government-allied party who was implicated in corruption and then began to implicate others , and was himself eventually expelled from [ORG Congress  ] ) , " who was himself not a hero of ethics . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hummes  ] was not certain [PER Lula  ] would even stand for re-election . 
" There 's probably a 70 percent chance he will . 
He personally opposes re-election and always has . 
He thinks it would be much better to have a longer term , five or six years , but only one term . 
I also think this would be much better for our democracy . 
" [PER Hummes  ] also opined that holding elections every two years -- federal and state elections alternative with municipal - was too disruptive and made it difficult for the government to accomplish anything. ---- [ORG PSDB  ] ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CG  ] noted that [PER Lula  ] 's recent resurgence in opinion polls posed a serious challenge for the opposition [ORG PSDB  ] . 
Cardinal [PER Hummes  ] agreed , pointing out that there are many similarities between the [ORG PT  ] and the [ORG PSDB  ] . 
" [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] ( [ORG FHC  ] ) brought the [ORG PSDB  ] closer to the [ORG PT  ] in many ways . 
And then [PER Lula  ] , when he came to power , adopted some [ORG PSDB  ] policies . 
They have to be in conflict with each other for you to be able to see the differences . 
" The party had too many good candidates , [PER Hummes  ] said , an abundance of talent that dates back to its founding . 
In 2002 , the party had trouble deciding on [PER Jose Serra  ] as its nominee ; finally , [ORG FHC  ] had to step in and designate him . 
The Cardinal knows both [ORG PSDB  ] presidential pre-candidates and talks regularly with both . 
In his view , the problem with a [PER Serra  ] candidacy is that if he runs and loses , the [ORG PSDB  ] will have lost the [MISC Mayorship of  ] [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , its great window on national politics . 
[PER Alckmin  ] , though not as well known outside [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , could be a great national surprise . 
[PER Hummes  ] opined that [PER Alckmin  ] could give [PER Lula  ] a better run for his money in the impoverished northeast , since [PER Alckmin  ] would appeal more that [PER Serra  ] to the lower classes . 
Even if he should lose to [PER Lula  ] , the [ORG PSDB  ] would then still hold the [MISC Mayorship of  ] [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
Thus , the rational decision would be for [PER Alckmin  ] , but the Cardinal recognized that politics isn't always rational . 
He noted also that [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] had wanted to run this time , but decided not to because he was a sure bet to be re-elected as Governor of [ORG Minas  ] but was less certain he could beat [ORG Lula.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a second term , [PER Hummes  ] predicted , [PER Lula  ] would be more moderate than [PER Serra  ] would if elected . 
[PER Lula  ] was not much of an adventurer and wouldn't take risks , the way great leaders and governments do . 
[PER Serra  ] is by temperament much bolder , and has always opposed the conventional " neo-liberal " macro-economic policy implemented first by [ORG FHC  ] and subsequently by [ORG Lula.  ] -------------------------- [ORG CHURCH  ] DOES NOT OPPOSE [ORG FTAA  ] --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CG  ] raised the issue of the [ORG Free Trade Area  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG FTAA  ] ) , noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] remains interested in negotiating an agreement even though the [PER Lula  ] government is still less than enthusiastic , and inquired into the [ORG Church  ] 's position . 
The Cardinal replied that there is no institutional opposition on the [ORG Church  ] 's part to this type of agreement . 
The world is clearly becoming more integrated , and nations can no longer afford to isolate themselves or stand on nationalism . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , for example , is a strong supporter of [LOC Mercosul  ] , but the community is very fragile , due in large part to [MISC Argentine  ] economic problems . 
The [ORG FTAA  ] must overcome traditional beliefs that it is another vehicle for the [LOC U.S.  ] to exploit [MISC Latin American  ] poverty . 
Many in the region are unable to believe that a just agreement can be reached . 
Nevertheless , though it won't be easy , it is necessary for the parties to keep trying . 
[PER Hummes  ] expressed the view that President [PER Lula  ] is trying to help overcome the " old thinking " wherein others , especially the [LOC United States  ] , were blamed for [LOC Brazil  ] 's problems . 
The [ORG Church  ] as an institution , he reiterated , has not opposed [ORG FTAA  ] and would not do so . 
Individual [MISC Brazilian  ] bishops or groups of bishops might have , or [ORG NGOs  ] affiliated with the [ORG Church  ] . 
Perhaps a study group presented recommendations to the [ORG National Conference of Bishops of Brazil  ] ( [ORG CNBB  ] ) opposing [ORG FTAA  ] , and these might have been published and characterized as an official [ORG Church  ] position . 
But the [ORG CNBB  ] itself had never adopted a resolution against [ORG FTAA  ] , and the [ORG Church  ] does not oppose free trade agreements in general or the [ORG FTAA  ] in particular . 
The [ORG Church  ] , he said in conclusion , does consider it important that any negotiated agreement be fully aired and discussed publicly , and be fair to all the parties . 
[ORG CG  ] replied that the USG is aware that all such agreements must be acceptable to both ( or all ) sides , because otherwise they will not be sustainable. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over the past six months , numerous [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors from both the government and the private sector have advised us that the [ORG Church  ] 's opposition to an [ORG FTAA  ] agreement was an important factor in the negative public opinion that in turn influenced the GoB 's reluctance to move forward with negotiations . 
Ref C reported that in July 2002 [ORG CNBB  ] was spearheading a [ORG National Campaign Against  ] the [ORG FTAA  ] , which , among other things , published a " scurrilous , error-filled 42-page pamphlet attacking the proposal and vilifying the 'imperialist' [LOC United States  ] . 
" Post is not in a position to determine , so long after the fact , whether the campaign and pamphlet were the work of the [ORG CNBB  ] itself or of some of its more radical members . 
In September 2002 , the [MISC Social Pastorate of  ] the Catholic [ORG Church  ] co-sponsored ( along with the [MISC Movimento  ] dos [PER Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra  ] ( MST ) , the [ORG PT  ] , and some 30 other [ORG NGOs  ] ) an unofficial anti-FTAA referendum . 
If the Cardinal 's characterization of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Church  ] 's official position is accurate - and we do not doubt his word or his knowledge of [ORG Church  ] affairs - then that official position has long since been drowned out in the public mind by the vocal , negative views on [ORG FTAA  ] of some priests , bishops , and influential lay people . 
That said , the fact that the [ORG Church  ] does not in fact oppose an agreement may prove useful in the months ahead . 
More generally , [PER Hummes  ] 's insights into the current [MISC Brazilian  ] political scene are well-informed and lucid , and it is clear he is following the situation closely and is in contact with all the major players .
