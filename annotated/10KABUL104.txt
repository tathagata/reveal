( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) At President [PER Karzai  ] , s direction , the [MISC Afghan  ] Office of the [ORG National Security Council  ] ( [ORG ONSC  ] ) has taken on the task of interagency coordination of reintegration planning , forming an [ORG Interagency Policy Working Group  ] ( [ORG IPWG  ] ) which produced a draft &National Reconciliation Policy and Reintegration of Armed Opposition Groups8 . 
The draft ) essentially a statement of reintegration principles which crosses no [LOC U.S.  ] redlines ) recommends an appointed cabinet-level lead , a single office to oversee all reintegration/reconciliation efforts and a peace &jirga8 ( grand council ) to sanction an implementation plan for [PER Karzai  ] , s approval . 
Deputy [ORG National Security Advisor Shaida Abdali  ] presented the draft paper to deputy ministers January 9 . 
Previously , [ORG Presidential Advisor Masoom Stanekzai  ] , the once and possibly future [ORG GIRoA  ] lead on reintegration , on January 5 produced a concept paper derived from the draft [ORG ONSC  ] principles paper , which fills in broad implementation details . 
( Note: as of January 10 , it appears [ORG Stanekzai  ] may gain a ministerial post unrelated to reintegration . 
) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) [ORG GIRoA  ] will present [ORG Stanekzai  ] , s reintegration concept paper to the international community at the January 13 Joint Coordination and [ORG Monitoring Board  ] ( [ORG JCMB  ] ) security sub-committee meeting and for endorsement at the full [ORG JCMB  ] meeting on January 20 . 
We expect that participants will acknowledge the paper at the January 28 [ORG London Foreign Ministerial  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
While this process indicates [MISC Afghan  ] movement on and commitment to developing a reintegration policy , none of these documents has yet been officially adopted and [ORG GIRoA  ] has yet to designate a clear reintegration lead . 
In a January 6 meeting , Deputy Ambassador [PER Ricciardone  ] and [ORG ISAF Reintegration Advisor  ] [PER Graeme Lamb  ] reiterated to [ORG Stanekzai  ] that [ORG GIRoA  ] should outline its integration strategy to the [MISC Afghan  ] public prior to [LOC London  ] , so that the international community can be seen as responding to an [MISC Afghan  ] initiative ( including with promises of financial support ) rather than driving it . 
President [PER Karzai  ] told [PER CODEL McCain  ] and Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] on January 6 that he would announce a reintegration policy framework prior to [LOC London  ] . 
END SUMMARY Progress on Papers , But Not a Complete Policy --------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) At President [PER Karzai  ] , s direction , the Office of the [ORG National Security Council  ] ( [ORG ONSC  ] ) has taken on the task of interagency coordination of reintegration planning , forming an [ORG Interagency Policy Working Group  ] ( [ORG IPWG  ] ) which produced a draft &National Reconciliation Policy and Reintegration of Armed Oppositions8 ( sic ) . 
The draft ) essentially a statement of reintegration principles which crosses no [LOC U.S.  ] redlines ) recommends an appointed cabinet-level lead , a single office to oversee all reintegration/reconciliation efforts and a peace jirga ( grand council ) to sanction an implementation plan for [PER Karzai  ] , s approval . 
The [ORG ONSC  ] paper is a statement of principles with an accompanying assessment of prospects for reintegration , s success and a list of reasons why past efforts have failed . 
It emphasizes the need for [MISC Afghan  ] leadership over programs resourced by [ORG ISAF  ] . 
It leaves the door open to insurgents joining the security forces , though it specifies that [ORG GIRoA  ] will not create autonomous militias. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) [ORG Presidential Advisor Masoom Stanekzai  ] , the once and possibly future designated [ORG GIRoA  ] lead on reintegration , on January 5 produced a concept paper derived from the draft [ORG ONSC  ] principles paper , which fills in broad implementation details . 
( Note: as of January 10 , it appears [ORG Stanekzai  ] may gain a ministerial post unrelated to reintegration , throwing into question the identity of the next reintegration lead . 
) [ORG Stanekzai  ] , s paper builds on the [ORG ONSC  ] paper , laying out basic criteria for communities , inclusion in a reintegration program by which they would receive development support . 
( Participating communities would accept the return of reintegrees and supervise their progress . 
) It stresses the need for education and vocational training for ex-fighters and their economic reintegration within their communities . 
It cites , without elaboration , &links8 to &public protection force initiatives8 , and the [ORG National Solidarity Program  ] ( a [ORG GIRoA  ] initiative which provides grants to communities to fund development projects selected by locally elected development councils ) , which is one possible source of development support for this program . 
The paper also lays out general timelines and roles for [ORG GIRoA  ] and the international community to follow . 
It distinguishes between different tiers of insurgents and argues , again [LOC KABUL  ] 00000104 002 OF 003 without elaborating , that different packages and approaches will be necessary for each . 
Both papers recommend that [ORG GIRoA  ] establish a single office with a cabinet-equivalent lead with full authority for reintegration and reconciliation efforts under the direct supervision of the President . 
[ORG ISAF’s Force Reintegration Cell  ] ( [ORG F-RIC  ] ) recommended to the [ORG ONSC  ] that this lead be staffed by a full-time organization supported by [ORG ISAF  ] , the [ORG UN  ] and the international community . 
[ORG GIRoA  ] will also create an [MISC Afghan  ] and international supervisory commission for financial oversight . 
( Note: we are emailing both [ORG ONSC  ] and [ORG Stanekzai  ] papers to [LOC SCA/A  ] and [ORG S/SRAP  ] . 
) TIMELINES... ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) [ORG ONSC  ] officials told us on January 4 ( and [ORG Stanekzai  ] confirmed to us January 6 ) that they will present [ORG Stanekzai  ] , s paper for discussion at the January 13 [ORG JCMB  ] security sub-committee meeting and for endorsement at the full [ORG JCMB  ] meeting on January 20 . 
President [PER Karzai  ] also told Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] and [PER CODEL McCain  ] on January 6 that he would announce a reintegration policy framework prior to the [ORG London Conference  ] . 
[ORG ONSC  ] expects to develop more detailed implementation plans and see a [ORG Presidential  ] decision on a reintegration lead after the [LOC London  ] conference. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) [ORG GIRoA  ] may convene a peace jirga to discuss and ratify the implementation plans , although probably not until May . 
[ORG GIRoA  ] would seek donor pledges at the [LOC Kabul  ] conference , which will likely be held in April or May . 
Both drafts state that the reintegration program will run for four to five years . 
The [ORG Stanekzai  ] paper notes that tactical reintegration will precede higher-level &political engagement8 ( reconciliation ) , and an evaluation phase where [ORG GIRoA  ] will assess its progress. ...AND REDLINES --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/Rel [LOC UK  ] ) Both documents respect [LOC U.S.  ] &red lines8 on insurgent reintegration ( insurgents must lay down arms and renounce violence , reject al [PER Qaeda  ] , and abide by the [MISC Afghan  ] Constitution ) but there are some passages that we will suggest [ORG ONSC  ] amend prior to release . 
Both drafts , but especially [ORG Stanekzai  ] , s , seem so focused on reconciling insurgents that they ignore the rights of victims , and largely ignore the issue of perverse incentives . 
A vague reference to “amnesty” for former insurgents in the [ORG Stanekzai  ] paper is confusing . 
( The [ORG ONSC  ] paper states that criminals are not eligible for benefits and insurgents not immune from prosecution for violations of human rights . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( /Rel [LOC UK  ] ) On January 6 Deputy Ambassador [PER Ricciardone  ] and [ORG ISAF Reintegration Advisor  ] [PER Graeme Lamb  ] called on [ORG Stanekzai  ] at his request for a stock-taking session . 
Key takeaways: --All reiterated the importance of ensuring that the international community sticks to its collectively stated intention of supporting an [MISC Afghan-led  ] reintegration process. --Stanekzai detailed ongoing [ORG GIRoA  ] discussions over how best to structure a trust fund for handling funds earmarked for reintegration programs . 
D/AMB noted that the [ORG USG  ] would not wish to work its contributions via [ORG UNDP  ] , one scenario under consideration . 
( Note: on January 9 [LOC UK  ] emboffs shared with us a proposal for a &dual window8 method , through which donors could choose to have their contributions handled either by [ORG UNDP  ] or a commercial bank . 
We expect this to be a topic for discussion among SRAPs at [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] . 
) --D/AMB took the opportunity to update [ORG Stanekzai  ] on the internal [ORG USG  ] processes related to the release of [ORG CERP  ] and [ORG USAID  ] funding for reintegration , including the requirement that the Secretary certify that [ORG GIRoA  ] had a workable plan and that the Department had consulted with [ORG GIRoA  ] on it . 
[ORG Stanekzai  ] evinced confidence that the ongoing , extensive [ORG GIRoA  ] interagency discussions would result in broad acceptance of the plan , with the looming [LOC London  ] conference serving a &forcing function8 to get interested ministries to move beyond &personality issues8 to commit. --D/AMB and [PER LtGen  ] ( ret’d ) [PER Graeme Lamb  ] recommended that the [PER Karzai  ] administration publicly outline its reintegration strategy prior to the [LOC London  ] conference , which would then serve as a venue for the international community to offer concrete support . 
[ORG Stanekzai  ] agreed and said that he had discussed this two days earlier with President [PER Karzai  ] , who planned to make such an announcement in [LOC Kabul.  ] --Stanekzai cautioned that reintegration of potentially tens of thousands of &foot soldiers8 would be a long-term proposition ) a five year-plan . 
Much work needed to carried [LOC KABUL  ] 00000104 003 OF 003 out , including development of a communications strategy , engagement with clerical leaders , and a plan for engagement with the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG Stanekzai  ] was eager to apply lessons learned from reintegration experience in other countries , such as [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Thailand  ] , and the [LOC Philippines.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) COMMENT: [ORG ONSC  ] is delivering the long-awaited &Afghan lead8 on reintegration , though on timelines that some international supporters will find frustrating . 
We believe that the time [ORG GIRoA  ] puts into building interagency coordination and consensus before moving out on reintegration is time well spent , particularly given the ongoing cabinet rebuilding effort . 
We will work with [ORG GIRoA  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] to encourage some fine-tuning of the papers ( e.g. deleting gratuitous swipes at [LOC Pakistani ISI  ] support for insurgents and purported [ORG ISAF  ] insensitivity to civilian casualties ) . 
Whether or not [ORG Stanekzai  ] ) a talented individual and open interlocutor ) remains the lead official on reintegration , we are pleased to see reintegration planning becoming institutionalized across ministry/agency lines . 
Coupled with [ORG ONSC  ] , s engagement on banning ammonium nitrate ( septel ) , its emergent lead on reintegration signals a welcome evolution of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s interagency process. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [PER S/Rel UK  ] ) The idea of a peace jirga to ratify [ORG GIRoA  ] reintegration planning , if well handled , can be a good source of political support . 
Credible reintegration efforts require buy-in from non-Pashtuns who might otherwise be suspicious of a [MISC Pashtun-only  ] &separate peace.8 Considering the scale of development money being earmarked for reintegration support , we are cognizant of the danger of creating perverse incentives , short-changing individuals and communities that have not fed the insurgency , and the potential for a lack of coordination with other governance and development initiatives targeting the same areas . 
Moreover , as a post-jirga plan could look considerably different than the [ORG GIRoA  ] plan that is submitted to it , we should appropriately caveat our release of funds should a post-jirga plan cross [LOC U.S.  ] redlines .
