THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 718 Classified By: Pol Deputy [PER Eric G. Falls  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY: All  ] evidence suggests the [MISC Dutch  ] will not/not retain a significant number of troops in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , and the coalition government could fall over this issue . 
Pushing the government to collapse on this matter is not in our interest . 
Accepting [MISC Dutch  ] compromise proposals is to our advantage . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC DUTCH  ] LEAVING [LOC URUZGAN  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador pressed Development Minister [PER Bert Koenders  ] ( [ORG Labor Party  ] ) to retain a [MISC Dutch  ] military contribution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in a meeting December 4 . 
[PER Koenders  ] observed that the pressure after the President , s speech is logical . 
He gave no insights that have not been in his recent , public statements . 
[PER Koenders  ] repeated that there will be no [MISC Dutch  ] troops in [LOC Uruzgan  ] after 2010 and flatly stated the [MISC Dutch  ] would also not lead the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
However , he did acknowledge that it is important for the [LOC Netherlands  ] to continue to do its part for [ORG NATO  ] and said there were " " discussions " " within the cabinet on committing [MISC Dutch  ] troops elsewhere in southern [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) D/PM / Finance Minister / [ORG Labor Party  ] leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] recently declined a requested meeting with Ambassador [PER Levin  ] to discuss [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He referred the Ambassador instead to [PER Koenders  ] , [PER Bos  ] 's primary adviser on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In all public statements during the past several months , and repeated publicly as recently as two days ago , just after President [PER Obama  ] 's speech , [PER Bos  ] has consistently stated the [MISC Dutch  ] will leave [LOC Uruzgan  ] in 2010. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Even Ministers that support continued involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] at the most aggressive level have been clear about this basic point . 
FM Verhagen stated " " the [LOC U.S.  ] knows that we will hand over the lead in [LOC Uruzgan  ] " " in 2010. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG Labor Party  ] has left no room for their own maneuvering on pulling everyone out of [LOC Uruzgan  ] except for a few ( 12 ) development personnel . 
We expect the [ORG Labor Party  ] could well bring down the government rather than extend the [LOC Uruzgan  ] mission . 
The [ORG Labor Party  ] 's " " bread and butter " " is the economy , but the party is looking for an out to rally their rank and file . 
The [ORG Labor Party  ] 's poll numbers have been low for months , suggesting a steep loss of seats in a near-term election . 
Accompanying this poor performance has been criticism of [PER Bos  ] 's leadership and his willingness to flip flop . 
We expect that rather than reverse course again and support a robust [LOC Uruzgan  ] mission , [PER Bos  ] would opt to pull out of the coalition and campaign on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End Comment . 
GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE NOT IN OUR INTEREST --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A collapse of the government hurts our chances for [MISC Dutch  ] contributions and would delay any prospective [MISC Dutch  ] contributions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A collapse hurts our chances for significant [MISC Dutch  ] military contributions . 
If [ORG Labor  ] pulls the plug on the governing coalition at this time , it would likely make [LOC Afghanistan  ] one of the central campaign issues . 
[MISC Dutch  ] public support for the mission continues at a low level ( 33% as of October 30 ) , suggesting that advocates for a deployment will lose seats in parliament . 
On the other hand , [PER Geert Wilders'  ] Qlose seats in parliament . 
On the other hand , [PER Geert Wilders'  ] far-right , isolationist [ORG Freedom Party  ] stands to gain significant seats in parliament . 
In turn , a new governing coalition will likely be forced to include more parties to reach a majority . 
It 's likely the coalition could shift to the left and include parties who are likely to oppose deployment after the elections' " " referendum on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" " <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A collapse of the government will delay additional [MISC Dutch  ] contributions . 
New elections and the formation of a new government will take 5-10 months , possibly longer due to [PER Wilders'  ] popularity and the corresponding difficulty in forming a new government . 
Until the new government is THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000731 002 OF 002 formed , the caretaker government would not be able to approve a new military mission . 
Considering that [MISC Dutch  ] troops are scheduled to depart this summer , as well as the planning required for an extension , withdrawal from [LOC Uruzgan  ] will proceed as scheduled and a new deployment could easily be delayed until 2011 . 
ACCEPTING [MISC DUTCH  ] PROPOSALS IS TO OUR ADVANTAGE --------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The new [MISC Dutch  ] proposal -- maintaining a civilian [ORG PRT  ] with protection by another ally , plus troops elsewhere in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- is better than waiting for a new coalition government that might not give us anything more , and could well give us less . 
Embassy counsels patience , deference and openness with [MISC Dutch  ] government 's efforts to sustain their [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment . 
PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's consistent support for the [LOC Afghanistan  ] mission and his success in leading his party to four consecutive wins in national elections give us confidence . 
We recommend deferring to the advice of [PER Balkenende  ] 's [ORG National Security Adviser  ] on not publicly pressuring the [MISC Dutch  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] .
