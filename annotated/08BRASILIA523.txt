( [ORG S  ] ) Chairman [PER Fortes  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] he is deeply concerned about reports of [LOC FARC-like  ] terrorist activity in a remote area of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He cited a recent article in the March 26 , 2008 , edition of [LOC IstoE  ] magazine that reported on the activities of a far left peasant movement called the [ORG Poor Peasants League  ] ( [ORG Liga  ] dos [PER Camponeses Pobres  ] , " [ORG LCP  ] " ) , with unknown , possibly foreign , funding , and in some ways similar to the [ORG FARC  ] . 
According to [LOC IstoE  ] , the [ORG LCP  ] holds territory in [LOC Rondonia  ] state , which borders the [MISC Bolivian  ] departments of [LOC Pando  ] and [LOC Beni  ] . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] said he felt certain there was foreign , possibly even [ORG FARC  ] , involvement in the [ORG LCP  ] , and guerilla training in [LOC Brazil  ] was a very serious matter . 
He speculated that the [ORG LCP  ] could be using [MISC Russian  ] or [MISC Iranian  ] " technology . 
" ( [ORG Note: IstoE  ] reported that [ORG LCP  ] guerrillas are armed with handguns , grenades , and automatic weapons , including the [MISC American-made AR-15  ] , the [MISC Russian-made  ] [MISC AK-47  ] , and the [ORG FAL  ] , originally of [MISC Belgian  ] manufacture but also manufactured in [LOC Brazil  ] for its military use , all of which are readily available on black markets in the region .

( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Fortes  ] also shared with Ambassador information he stressed was very sensitive and should be strictly protected . 
He said that the [ORG Senate Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry  ] into [ORG Non-Governmental Organizations  ] learned that an [ORG NGO  ] in [LOC Teresina  ] , [LOC Piaui  ] , supported by a [MISC Trotskyite  ] faction of the [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) had received substantial foreign funding channeled through a foreign international relations institution . 
This [ORG NGO  ] , which he named as [ORG CEPAC  ] , at one time had about 15 foreigners working for it for four to six months , he said . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] said these foreigners were either terrorists or they had participated in foreign movements . 
He pointed out that [LOC Teresina  ] is a city with no history of urban disturbances , and therefore there should have been no reason to base foreign agents based there . 
He also said that in the period 2001-2002 an [MISC Italian  ] terrorist was in [LOC Teresina  ] , but was discovered , arrested , and removed from [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( [ORG Note: The PT  ] faction is probably the [MISC Socialist Democracy  ] faction . 
[ORG CEPAC  ] is the [ORG Piaui Cultural Action Center  ] , or [LOC Centro Piauiense de Acao Cultural  ] , a [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG NGO  ] closely linked to the [ORG PT  ] . 
In early March 2008 , during the [ORG Senate  ] investigation of [ORG NGOs  ] , [ORG CEPAC  ] came under scrutiny by opposition politicians for receiving large federal grants through the [ORG Agrarian Development Ministry  ] . 
The governor of [LOC Piaui  ] , [PER Wellington Dias  ] , belongs to the [ORG PT  ] . 
[PER Fortes  ] is qualified to speak on conditions in [LOC Teresina:  ] he was its mayor from 1989 to 1992 . 
The [MISC Italian  ] he mentioned might be [PER Cesare Battisti  ] , who was arrested in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] on March [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000523 002 OF 002 18 , 2007 , but is still in [LOC Brazil  ] pending extradition to [LOC Italy  ] .

( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to the turmoil in [LOC Bolivia  ] , Chairman [PER Fortes  ] noted that on the positive side , there is disenchantment in [LOC Bolivia  ] with the [MISC Bolivarian  ] idea . 
He said he had met earlier in the week of March 24 with the new [MISC Bolivian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] , the president of the [MISC Bolivian  ] [ORG Senate  ] , and the Chairman of the [MISC Bolivian  ] [ORG Senate  ] 's [ORG Foreign Relations Committee  ] . 
Implying that [LOC Bolivia  ] wishes to repair its relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] after its [MISC Bolivarian  ] romance , Chairman [PER Fortes  ] said the [MISC Bolivian  ] Ambassador apologized to him for some disagreements between presidents [PER Lula  ] and [PER Morales  ] a couple of years ago and agreed with [PER Fortes  ] that the two countries need to continue their tradition of friendly relations . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] also said that it is worrisome that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] is able to exert pressure on [PER Evo Morales  ] " because he financed him . 
" He added that the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] in " very serious , " with disturbances and people in the streets. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Captured [ORG FARC  ] Documents Threw [PER Chavez  ] Off Balance - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Fortes  ] said he had spoken with a person who was present at the [ORG Rio Group  ] meeting in [PER Santo Domingo  ] , [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , who reported that President [PER Chavez  ] had been thrown off balance by the discovery of compromising information on a laptop computer seized after the recent [MISC Colombian  ] attack on [ORG FARC  ] forces and , as a result , behaved in a comparatively subdued manner. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] is one of a few [MISC Brazilian  ] legislators who have spoken to us of their concerns about [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] meddling in the region , threats to stability , and other national security issues . 
[PER Fortes  ] , more than many , is paying attention to what he considers to be emerging threats inside and outside of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
His concerns about the [ORG LCP  ] and [ORG CEPAC  ] seem valid , based on the information he has at hand , but we do not have enough information to evaluate the information 's accuracy and the possible seriousness of the situations .
