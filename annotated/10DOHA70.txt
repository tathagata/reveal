LeBaron  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . -------------- ( C ) KEY POINTS -------------- -- The [ORG Amir  ] of [LOC Qatar  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] in his February 14 meeting with Senator [PER John Kerry  ] ( [ORG D-MA  ] ) to do everything in its power to find a lasting solution to the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said the best way to begin is by moving first on the [MISC Syrian  ] track . 
-- In [LOC Qatar  ] 's view , now is the time to reach out to [LOC Damascus  ] . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] Government can help [MISC Arab  ] extremists make tough choices , but only if the [LOC U.S.  ] , whose involvement is essential , demonstrates to [LOC Syria  ] early on a willingness to address the return of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] and supports [LOC Turkey  ] 's mediation efforts between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
-- According to the [ORG Amir  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] will accept the 1967 border with [LOC Israel  ] , but will not say it publicly so as to lose popular [MISC Palestinian  ] support . 
-- The [MISC Egyptians'  ] goal , according to the [ORG Amir  ] , is to stay in the game and maintain their relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , which is built around brokering regional peace , for as long as possible . 
-- The [ORG Amir  ] recommended that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] establish a small bilateral committee to discuss how to advance regional peace . 
[LOC Qatar  ] can help move [ORG Hamas  ] , because [LOC Qatar  ] does not " play in their internal politics . 
" That does not mean [LOC Qatar  ] shares [ORG Hamas'  ] ideology , stressed the [ORG Amir  ] . 
-- On [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG Amir  ] said President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] is strong because he is uncorrupted . 
The [ORG Amir  ] also advised the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue ts efforts to open a dialogue with the [MISC Iranian  ] ladership . 
End Key [LOC Points.  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Joh Kerry  ] ( [ORG D-MA  ] ) , the Chairman of the [ORG Senate Foreig Relations Committee  ] ( [ORG SFRC  ] ) , joined by Ambassador , P/E Chief , and [ORG SFRC  ] staff member Dr. [PER Jonah Blank  ] met February 14 with the [ORG Amir  ] of [LOC Qatar  ] , [LOC Hamad  ] bn [PER Khalifa Al Thani  ] . 
The meeting took place at [LOC Waba Palace  ] , the residence of the [ORG Amir  ] , and the [ORG Amir  ] began the meeting by pointing out that the comfortable chairs on which the [LOC U.S.  ] party was seated were made in [LOC Syria.  ] ------------------------------ IMPORTANCE OF THE [MISC SYRIAN  ] TRACK ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) This opening led Senator [PER Kerry  ] to remark that he had held great discussions with [LOC Syria  ] 's President , [PER Bashar Al-Asad  ] , when he met him in [LOC Damascus  ] some months ago . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said President [PER Asad  ] is committed to " big change , " but [MISC Lebanese  ] Prime Minister [PER Hariri  ] 's death and complications resulting from [LOC Syria  ] 's alleged involvement in it had brought about " complications " for [PER Asad  ] . 
The [ORG Amir  ] added that " [PER Bashar  ] is still young and can grow . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] said he took away from his visit to [LOC Damascus  ] that [PER Asad  ] wants change . 
The [ORG Amir  ] added that the [MISC Syrian  ] President also wants peace with [LOC Israel  ] and that the arrival of a [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador in [LOC Damascus  ] would help in this regard . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] said he had wanted a [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador in [LOC Syria  ] a year ago , but agreed that the naming of an Ambassador is a positive development. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] cautioned that the [MISC Syrians  ] will not accept everything the [LOC U.S.  ] proposes , stressing that the [MISC Israeli  ] occupation of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] continues and that the return of this land to [LOC Syria  ] is paramount for [LOC Damascus  ] . 
The [ORG Amir  ] observed that the " [MISC Syrians  ] have lost confidence in the [LOC U.S.  ] and that the [MISC Israelis  ] now have the upper hand in the region because of the support of the [LOC United States  ] . 
" The [MISC Israeli  ] leaders need to represent the people of [LOC Israel  ] , who themselves do not trust [MISC Arabs  ] . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said this is understandable and " we can't blame them " because the [MISC Israelis  ] have been " under threat " for a long time. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) What has changed , continued the [ORG Amir  ] , is that [MISC Arabs  ] " for sure " now want two states -- [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] . 
When you consider that many in the region perceive that [ORG Hizballah  ] drove [LOC Israel  ] out of [LOC Lebanon  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] kicked them ( at least initially ) out " of the small piece of land called [LOC Gaza  ] , " it is actually surprising that the [MISC Israelis  ] still want peace . 
The region , however , is still " far away " from peace , concluded the [ORG Amir.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] responded that in his long experience with the region , it was not unusual for people to take positions adverse to their own interests . 
[PER Yasser Arafat  ] went from living as a terrorist in [LOC Tunisia  ] to signing an agreement with [LOC Israel  ] on the [LOC White House  ] lawn . 
The transformation of [PER Arafat  ] is an example of how actors in the region need to take risks if we are to move forward in advancing regional peace . 
Turning the conversation back to [LOC Syria  ] , Chairman [PER Kerry  ] pointed out that [LOC Syria  ] 's facilitation of arms to [ORG Hizballah  ] and its turning a blind eye to missile upgrades in [LOC Lebanon  ] do not represent risk-taking in the promotion of peace. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] pointed out that any progress toward regional peace had come about due to [MISC American  ] involvement . 
He implied that it would take [LOC U.S.  ] intervention on the [MISC Syrian-Israeli  ] track to address these issues and asked Senator [PER Kerry  ] what he would have [LOC Damascus  ] do. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Chairman responded that President [PER Asad  ] needs to make a bolder move and take risks . 
He observed that if the [MISC Syrian  ] President wants peace and economic development for his country , he needs to be more statesman-like , which would in turn help [MISC Israeli  ] Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] engage him. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] agreed with Senator [PER Kerry  ] 's assessment of [PER Asad  ] 's aims and said he is ready for peace , but asked if the [MISC Israelis  ] are ready . 
Would [LOC Israel  ] accept to resume [LOC Turkey  ] 's mediation between [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Israel  ] ? 
Would the [LOC U.S.  ] play a role in advancing the [LOC Syria  ] track ? <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) If we can get [PER Abu Mazen  ] back to the negotiating table , we can engage on border issues -- including [LOC Israel  ] 's borders with [LOC Syria  ] , advised [ORG Senator Kerry  ] . 
[PER Abu Mazen  ] right now is not strong enough , though , to make necessary compromises with [LOC Israel  ] because the [MISC Palestinian  ] people have wanted him to stick to his guns on a settlement freeze and the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] . 
The Chairman added that [PER Netanyahu  ] also needs to compromise and work the return of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] into a formula for peace. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to work the [LOC Golan Heights  ] issue first . 
He stressed that [MISC Syrians  ] are very different from [MISC Iranians  ] in " mentality , " and said the [MISC Syrians  ] turned to [LOC Iran  ] for support only because they had nowhere else to go . 
Now is the time , the [ORG Amir  ] told [ORG Senator Kerry  ] , to reach out to [LOC Damascus.  ] ------------------------- PARAMETERS FOR DISCUSSION ------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] is prepared to play a strong role in bringing about peace in the region . 
President [PER Obama  ] , said the Chairman , understands that he personally must engage and do so strongly . 
The [ORG Senator  ] told the [ORG Amir  ] that in his speech to the [LOC U.S.-Islamic Forum  ] the previous evening , the [ORG Senator  ] had focused on former President [PER Clinton  ] 's parameters for peace and the 2002 [ORG Arab League  ] peace initiative . 
Now , said the [ORG Senator  ] , is the time to put those back on the table and resume talking , with the [LOC U.S.  ] acting as a legitimate agent of peace . 
Chairman [PER Kerry  ] told the [ORG Amir  ] he is convinced that we can see great progress in the coming year by moving swiftly from proximity talks , to direct talks between the parties and ending with final status discussions. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) To be successful , continued [ORG Senator Kerry  ] , we must begin by agreeing at the outset the amount of land each side ( [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] ) will obtain in the end and use that understanding to draw the borders . 
If both sides make good compromises , we can address the settlement issues in the context of giving something up so that the borders , when drawn , contain the agreed-upon amounts of land for both sides . 
The [ORG Amir  ] agreed with the [ORG Senator  ] 's assessment and complimented President [PER Obama  ] for being the first [LOC U.S.  ] President to take on the [LOC Middle East  ] conflict in the first year of his term. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Continuing the presentation of his ideas on the parameters of peace between [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [ORG Senator Kerry  ] noted that one of the biggest problems for [LOC Israel  ] is the potential return of 5-6 million [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees . 
The parties broached the return issue in discussions at [LOC Taba  ] and agreed that the right of [MISC Palestinian  ] return would be subject to later negotiation , pointed out the Chairman . 
If we can proceed from that point on the right of return , the [ORG Senator  ] believes there is an " artful way " to frame the negotiations on borders , land swaps , and [LOC Jerusalem  ] as a shared capital. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Any negotiation has its limits , added [ORG Senator Kerry  ] , and we know for the [MISC Palestinians  ] that control of [LOC Al-Aqsa  ] mosque and the establishment of some kind of capital for the [MISC Palestinians  ] in [LOC East Jerusalem  ] are not negotiable . 
For the [MISC Israelis  ] , the [ORG Senator  ] continued , [LOC Israel  ] 's character as a [MISC Jewish  ] state is not open for negotiation . 
The non-militarization of an eventual [MISC Palestinian  ] state and its borders can nonetheless be resolved through negotiation. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] underscored that [PER Abu Mazen  ] needs [MISC Arab  ] support to make the above happen . 
[ORG Hamas  ] " for sure , " he said , will accept the 1967 border but will not say it publicly so as to lose popular [MISC Palestinian  ] support. --------------------------- DEALING WITH THE EXTREMISTS --------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] told the [ORG Amir  ] he knew [LOC Qatar  ] could help the [LOC U.S.  ] but asked how we deal with those who advocate violence . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said the short answer is to work the [MISC Syrian  ] track , which means pushing for [LOC Israel  ] 's return of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] to [LOC Syria  ] . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said return of the [LOC Golan  ] is important not just to [LOC Syria  ] but also to [ORG Hizballah  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] must bear in mind that [PER Misha'al  ] , a leader of [ORG Hamas  ] based in [LOC Damascus  ] , has drawn the conclusion that the [LOC Oslo  ] accords were bad for [PER Arafat  ] . 
He lost the support of his own people and died living under [MISC Israeli  ] siege . 
The [MISC Syrians  ] can help [PER Misha'al  ] and others make tough choices , but only if the [LOC U.S.  ] demonstrates to [LOC Syria  ] early on a willingness to address the [LOC Golan  ] . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] would accept a legitimate discussion of the [LOC Golan Heights.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) What is more , said the [ORG Amir  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] needs to support [LOC Turkey  ] 's mediation between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
It is important that the [LOC U.S.  ] encourage [LOC Israel  ] to understand that that resolving the status of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] is very important to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] asked the [ORG Amir  ] if [ORG Hamas  ] is under pressure given the circumstances in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The [ORG Amir  ] answered by saying that [ORG Hamas  ] needs [MISC Iranian  ] support . 
He added that the biggest misconception in the region is that the [MISC Syrians  ] , who host [ORG Hamas  ] leaders in [LOC Damascus  ] , go to [LOC Iran  ] because they like the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
This is wrong . 
[LOC Syria  ] goes to those who will not shun them. ------------- ROLE OF [LOC EGYPT  ] ------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Returning to the pressure [ORG Hamas  ] is facing , Senator [PER Kerry  ] observed that economic development in the [LOC West Bank  ] is taking place , but not in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation that would make possible developmental assistance in [LOC Gaza  ] has not happened . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] have not delivered , said Senator [PER Kerry.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] said the [MISC Egyptians'  ] goal is to stay in the game and maintain their relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , which is built around brokering [LOC Middle East  ] peace , for as long as possible . 
According to the [ORG Amir  ] , [PER Fatah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] agreed on a memorandum of understanding , but the [MISC Egyptians  ] wanted it changed . 
The [ORG Amir  ] remarked that he has a feeling he knows which capital ( [LOC Cairo  ] ) is the source of reports that [LOC Gaza  ] is under pressure . 
He said the economic pressure in [LOC Gaza  ] on families is not what it was . 
He offered as an example that [LOC Qatar  ] Charity recently offered a family in [LOC Gaza  ] 500 USD , but the family declined the gift saying its members had enough to get by and suggested another family that was in more dire need of assistance . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said the notion that a family would turn down money is new. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] told Senator [PER Kerry  ] that everyone knows " [LOC Egypt  ] has a problem with the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
Okay , we understand . 
But [LOC Egypt  ] should not expect the world to take external actions that would help it internally . 
" <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) Asked his advice for President [PER Obama  ] , the [ORG Amir  ] recommended the establishment of a small [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] committee to discuss how to proceed . 
[LOC Qatar  ] is close to [ORG Hamas  ] , emphasized the [ORG Amir  ] , because " we don't play in their internal politics . 
" That does not mean we share their ideology or do not disagree with them . 
" I can remember many arguments with them ( [ORG Hamas  ] ) on the 1967 border with [LOC Israel  ] . 
" The [ORG Amir  ] noted that he had mediated with [ORG Hamas  ] previously at the [LOC U.S.  ] request , namely when he urged [ORG Hamas  ] at the previous [ORG Administration  ] 's request to participate in [MISC Palestinian  ] elections. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) Returning to the leadership of [ORG Hamas  ] , Senator [PER Kerry  ] asked the [ORG Amir  ] for his insights into how the leadership , with leaders sitting in both [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , makes decisions . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said the impression that [PER Misha'al  ] sits in [LOC Damascus  ] and others take orders from him is wrong . 
Several key players within [ORG Hamas  ] are involved in decisions . 
They have differences over policy , but " the bottom line is that they all want the [MISC Palestinians  ] to take their rights from [LOC Israel  ] . 
" ---- [LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] observed that the international community is moving toward imposing additional economic sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Understanding and respecting that [LOC Qatar  ] needs to balance its relationships with regional powers , including [LOC Iran  ] , the Chairman asked the [ORG Amir  ] for his perspective on where we are going on [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] answered by affirming that his first obligation is to defend the interests of [LOC Qatar  ] . 
Due to the natural gas field [LOC Iran  ] shares with [LOC Qatar  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] will not " provoke a fight " with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He added that in the history of the two countries , " [LOC Iran  ] has not bothered us . 
" That said , the [ORG Amir  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] is an important country in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He faulted the [LOC U.S.  ] for " making the mistake of speaking up for protesters " after the disputed [MISC Iranian  ] presidential elections. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) The [MISC Iranian  ] regime is strong , continued the [ORG Amir  ] , because President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] is uncorrupted . 
" That is the secret to his success . 
" [PER Khatami  ] is also not corrupted , but as a reformer he is in a weak position . 
[PER Rafsanjani  ] , on the other hand , is corrupt. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] lamented that every communication the current [ORG Administration  ] has attempted to the Government of [LOC Iran  ] has gone back channel and been met with no response . 
There have been non-U.S. initiatives , too . 
Again , no success . 
The Chairman observed that the [MISC Iranians  ] are scared to talk . 
The [ORG Supreme Ayatollah  ] had met with [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] , but seems not inclined to meet with other political leaders . 
Our instinct is that we need to find a way to talk to him. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) Your instinct is right , replied the [ORG Amir  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] needs to talk directly with senior [MISC Iranian  ] officials . 
The [ORG Amir  ] then asked , " What if I talk to the [MISC Iranian  ] President . 
What would you have me say ? 
" <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] responded , " The [LOC U.S.  ] seeks serious discussion and sought to create a new foundation for a relationship based on [LOC Iran  ] 's non-confrontational compliance with [ORG IAEA  ] requirements and other mutual interests . 
" Those interests include dealing with drug-running , the [ORG Taliban  ] , and illicit trade . 
The Chairman told the [ORG Amir  ] he feared that [LOC Iran  ] still thinks it is dealing with the 1953 [LOC America  ] that tried to overthrow the [MISC Iranian  ] government. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] responded that you cannot blame them for having that attitude , and Senator [PER Kerry  ] agreed , adding that the [LOC U.S.  ] has a very different posture in the post-Cold War world of today . 
[LOC Iran  ] has ambitions ; I know this from other regional leaders , said the [ORG Senator  ] . 
These are the first words that come out of their mouths. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] wants to be a " big power , " agreed the [ORG Amir  ] , but what sort ? 
He reminded Senator [PER Kerry  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] should not forget that [MISC Iranians  ] are [MISC Persian  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] needs to approach them in that framework. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" would love to have that dialogue . 
" The [LOC U.S.  ] respects [MISC Iranian  ] civilization -- talent , art , culture , etc . 
It is crazy to continue on this collision course . 
The region needs schools and jobs , emphasized the Chairman , not another war . 
The [ORG Amir  ] agreed that " demographics are a big worry . 
" Not just for the countries in the region but for the [LOC U.S.  ] too. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( C ) Many scientific and technological transformations are underway , noted the Senator , " but [LOC Iran  ] misinterprets the road to being a great power and the degree to which the international community is concerned about [LOC Iran  ] 's acquisition of nuclear weapons . 
" We are at a " fork in the road , " and [LOC Iran  ] must choose between confrontation or building partnerships . 
If the latter , we can open up new opportunities for cooperation in the sciences , technology , education , robotics , energy and other ongoing transformations. <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( C ) Going back to the speech he had delivered in [LOC Doha  ] the previous evening , Senator [PER Kerry  ] told the [ORG Amir  ] that 17 former [LOC U.S.  ] Secretaries of State and [LOC Defense  ] had come out in favor of eliminating nuclear weapons . 
Every stop closer to realizing that goal is a sign of progress , but " no one believes [MISC Iranian  ] nukes get us closer to that goal . 
" <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] reported that leaders of regional [MISC Arab  ] countries tell me they want nuclear weapons if the [MISC Iranians  ] have them . 
The [ORG Amir  ] responded that he did not believe they were serious , but are saying this to put additional pressure on [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
( C ) The Chairman noted that the disputed [MISC Iranian  ] presidential elections may have derailed [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to have serious dialogue with [LOC Tehran  ] . 
The [ORG Amir  ] agreed , offering that the [MISC Israelis  ] are also using [LOC Iran  ] 's quest for nuclear weapons as a diversion from settling matters with the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
The historical backdrop of [MISC Arab-Persian  ] relations does not help , the [ORG Amir  ] added. -------------- FINAL THOUGHTS -------------- <a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] advised the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue trying to open a dialogue with the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership . 
He also told Senator [PER Kerry  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] needs to tell the [MISC Israelis  ] they are causing the [LOC U.S.  ] to lose the hearts and minds of [MISC Muslims  ] . 
There was a time , such as during the [MISC Suez Canal  ] crisis , when the [MISC Arabs  ] loved the [MISC Americans  ] and disliked the [MISC British  ] and [MISC French  ] , he said. <a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] asked the [ORG Amir  ] how the [LOC U.S.  ] goes about changing its reputation . 
The [ORG Amir  ] said first and foremost the [LOC U.S.  ] must do everything in its power to find a lasting solution to the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict , and the best way to begin is by moving first on the [MISC Syrian  ] track. <a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40 . 
( C ) The Chairman of the [ORG SFRC  ] said he expects a genuine effort by the President this year on an agreement and expressed his hope that [MISC Iranian  ] issues would not complicate matters . 
The [ORG Amir  ] agreed , adding that [LOC China  ] likes the distraction for the [LOC U.S.  ] as its forces fight in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par41' href='#par41'>¶</a>41 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] concurred , noting that [LOC China  ] is lending the [LOC U.S.  ] money and expanding its influence at [LOC U.S.  ] expense . 
He added that he ran against President [PER George W. Bush  ] saying the war with [LOC Iraq  ] was the wrong war in the wrong place and time. <a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42 . 
( C ) The [ORG Amir  ] closed the meeting by offering that based on 30 years of experience with the [MISC Iranians  ] , they will give you 100 words . 
Trust only one of the 100. <a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43 . 
( U ) CODEL [PER Kerry  ] has cleared this message .
