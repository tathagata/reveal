( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary: Six  ] leading members of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( [ORG LIFG  ] ) imprisoned in [LOC Libya  ] recently issued a 417-page document renouncing the use of violence and establishing a new " code " for jihad . 
The group includes [ORG LIFG  ] 's " founding fathers , " individuals with ties to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] in the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Maghreb  ] 's ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) senior leadership , including the elder brother of [PER Abu Yahya  ] al-Libi , a leading [ORG AQIM  ] figure . 
The recantation claims to represent a clearer understanding of the " ethics " of [MISC Islamic  ] shari'a law and jihad and specifically refutes the [ORG LIFG  ] 's decades-long jihad against [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi . 
The document is the result of a two-year initiative led by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi through his [ORG Qadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , and supported by [LOC Libya  ] 's internal and external security services . 
As a result of the initiative , more than 200 jihadists ( approximately half of the imprisoned LIGF members ) have been released from prison , with more releases expected soon . 
The initiative has been highlighted by local and international media as a potential model in counter-radicalization and touted by the [MISC Libyan  ] government as a " revolutionary new method to combat terrorism and the influence of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] in the region . 
" While [LOC Libya  ] 's terrorist rehabilitation program has drawn skepticism from some quarters , who view the recantation as coerced and politically motivated , the work is reportedly being reviewed by foreign governments and has received praise as a positive GOL contribution to regional counterterrorism efforts . 
While the initiative is significant for [LOC Libya  ] 's internal politics -- simultaneously shoring up regime stability and [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's credentials -- its long-term effects as a counter-radicalization effort remain to be seen . 
End summary . 
[PER SAIF  ] AL-ISLAM AND [MISC LIBYAN  ] SECURITY FORCES FACILITATE CODE , RELEASE OF [ORG LIFG  ] 2 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) In late September , six leading members of the [ORG Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  ] , being held in the [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison , issued a document outlining a revised interpretation of their jihadist ideology -- one which renounces violence and claims to adhere to a more sound [MISC Islamic  ] theology than that of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and other jihadist organizations . 
The authors represent the group 's historic senior leadership , including Abd al-Hakim [PER Balhaj  ] ( aka , [MISC Abu  ] Abd [LOC Allah  ] al-Sadiq , Emir of the [ORG LIFG  ] ) , [LOC Abu al-Munder  ] al-Saidi ( Jurisprudence Official of the LIFG/most senior shari'a authority ) , Abd al-Wahab al-Qayed ( the elder brother of [PER Abu Yahya  ] al-Libi , a leading [ORG AQIM  ] figure ) , [PER Khalid  ] al-Sharif , Miftah al-Duwdi , and [PER Mustafa Qanaifid  ] . 
In the 417-page , Arabic-language document , entitled " [ORG Revisionist Studies  ] of the Concepts of Jihad , Verification , and Judgment of People , " the authors point to ignorance and a misinterpretation of [MISC Islamic  ] jurisprudence as the basis for their formerly violent expression of [MISC Islamic  ] jihad . 
The authors state that " The lack of religious knowledge , whether it was a result of an absence of 'ulama' ( religious scholars ) or the neglect of people in receiving it and attaining it , or due to the absence of its sources , is the biggest cause of errors and religious violations . 
" They credit a deep evaluation of their lives' experiences , coupled with a closer study of shari'a law for their ideological reform . 
3 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) The study is characterized as an attempt to recant former [ORG LIFG  ] doctrine and to establish a new " code " for jihad for the benefit of the modern [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
In the text , the authors directly challenge [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , addressing the recantation to " anyone who we might have once had organizational or brotherly ties with . 
" The document gives detailed interpretations of the " ethics and morals to jihad , " which include the rejection of violence as a means to change political situations in [MISC Muslim  ] majority countries whose leader is a [MISC Muslim  ] and condemns " the killing of women , children , the elderly , monks/priests , wage earners , messengers , merchants and the like . 
" It claims that " The reduction of jihad to fighting with the sword is an error and shortcoming . 
" 4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The revised [ORG LIFG  ] ideology is the result of a two-year initiative , led by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi in his capacity as [ORG QDF  ] chairman and brokered on behalf of the [MISC Libyan  ] government . 
According to press reports and [MISC Libyan  ] officials , [PER Saif  ] worked closely with the [MISC UK-based  ] former [ORG LIFG  ] leader , [PER Noman Benotman  ] , on the effort to work on a revised ideology with the [ORG LIFG  ] in exchange for amnesty . 
[ORG QDF  ] 's lead negotiator , [PER Salah Abdelsalam Salah  ] , director of the [ORG QDF  ] 's [ORG Human Rights Committee  ] , ( who also heads [MISC Saif  ] al-Islam 's [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] , ref A ) , said that he had met with al-Sadiq " 4-5 " times in 2007 , before reconciliation [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000955 002.2 OF 003 discussions began in earnest . 
At that time , al-Sadiq seemed " ready to reconcile " and had indicated that his cohort shared his serious desire to break with their violent past . 
5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Salah  ] detailed the two-year negotiation in a meeting with Pol/Econ Chief , sharing several handwritten letters from al-Sadiq to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , requesting assistance . 
After the initial communication , a series of meetings began , along two tracks: the first involving imprisoned [ORG LIFG  ] leadership conversing with their members ; the second involving [ORG LIFG  ] leadership , the [ORG QDF  ] , leading [MISC Islamic  ] scholars , and prison officials ( from [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Internal Security Organization  ] ) . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG External Security Organization  ] reportedly took on a supporting role , coordinating a " reconciliation and rehabilitation " movement among [MISC Libyan  ] opposition figures ( including [ORG LIFG  ] members and others ) living abroad . 
The meetings continued over the course of two years , and al-Sadiq wrote letters to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam throughout that period with updates on the [ORG LIFG  ] position . 
In a letter dated January 16 , 2009 , al-Sadiq informed [PER Saif  ] of the [ORG LIFG  ] 's intention to draft the recantation work by August 1 , 2009 , to announce revisions to its jihadist ideology and to reconcile with the [MISC Libyan  ] regime . 
On February 23 , 2009 , al-Sadiq issued a press statement on behalf of the [ORG LIFG  ] leaders in prison , announcing the continuation of a reconciliation dialogue with the [ORG QDF  ] and GOL . 
[PER Salah  ] refused to comment on international press reports that [PER Saif  ] faced challenges from old guard regime officials who reportedly did not want to pardon the prisoners . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As reported in ref B , [ORG QDF  ] 's Executive Director told us in August that the [ORG QDF  ] had facilitated consultations between [ORG LIFG  ] leadership and leading [MISC Islamic  ] scholars , such as Qatar-based [MISC Egyptian  ] cleric [PER Yusuf al-Qardawi  ] and Sheikh [PER Ali Asalabi  ] . 
In response to an early-2009 letter from al-Sadiq to [PER Saif  ] requesting by title a list of more than 10 books on [MISC Islamic  ] jurisprudence , the [ORG QDF  ] provided reading and reference materials for the [ORG LIFG  ] to study in prison . 
On August 1 , al-Sadiq informed [PER Saif  ] that the revisionist study was complete and submitted it for review . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On August 23 , to mark the beginning of [PER Ramadan  ] and the [MISC Libyan  ] leader 's 40th anniversary in power , [ORG LIFG  ] leadership issued another press statement , this time apologizing to [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi for their past acts of violence against him . 
The first of two rounds of prison releases took place shortly after the statement was published , with 91 [ORG LIFG  ] prisoners pardoned and released . 
A second amnesty was announced in mid-October , with another 43 [ORG LIFG  ] members reportedly being released . 
According to [PER Salah  ] , these releases constitute approximately half of the imprisoned [ORG LIFG  ] members , all of whom were imprisoned at [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison . 
( [PER Saif  ] al-Islam has publicly stated his intention to demolish the facility , infamous for a 1996 uprising that left 1200 prisoners dead , after the last prisoners have been released . 
) [PER Salah  ] reported that another round of amnesties would take place in the coming weeks , with [PER Saif  ] 's ultimate goal being 100-percent prisoner release . 
In a separate effort , [PER Salah  ] said that the [ORG GOL  ] has released some 62 members of other " jihadist groups " from [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison based on their recantations of violent jihad . 
8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to [PER Salah  ] , the revisionist study represented the dissolution of the [ORG LIFG  ] organization in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Upon release , each former [ORG LIFG  ] member becomes a " regular " citizen and is allowed to " do what regular [MISC Libyans  ] do , " including unrestricted movement and the freedom to travel abroad . 
[PER Salah  ] vehemently denied the assertion among some analysts that the [ORG LIFG  ] leaders reconciled due to lucrative incentive packages offered by the [ORG GOL  ] . 
He claimed that the only benefits given to former [ORG LIFG  ] prisoners upon release were " job training and employment assistance , financial support for medical care , if needed , and living expenses until the prisoners are able to find jobs . 
" Some press reports indicate that as a condition of the pardon , former militants are required to pledge not to participate in [MISC Libyan  ] politics , although they are able to speak in mosques . 
[ Comment: Even if they wanted to participate in politics , how they would do so is unclear , given that political parties are outlawed in [LOC Libya  ] . 
End comment . 
] 9 . 
( SBU ) [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's involvement in the reconciliation effort has received widespread local and international media attention -- state-run print media has published excerpts of the text and praised [PER Saif  ] for his work , and [ORG CNN  ] recently broadcast a feature report on the efforts . 
The [ORG CNN  ] report praises the initiative , describing [PER Saif  ] 's motivation as not only ending the [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000955 003.2 OF 003 violent movement against the regime but also combating [ORG Al Qaeda  ] 's " growing influence in the region . 
" [ORG CNN  ] further claimed that , " In essence the new code for jihad is exactly what the [LOC West  ] has been waiting for: a credible challenge from within jihadist ranks to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] 's ideology . 
" International think-tanks such as the [ORG Quilliam Foundation  ] and [ORG Jihadica  ] have analyzed the efforts and the [ORG LIFG  ] document , with the latter calling it a " very sweeping repudiation not just of [MISC Salafi  ] jihadism but of all forms of revolutionary [MISC Islamism  ] in general . 
" 10 . 
( C ) Some observers believe the [MISC Libyan  ] counter-radicalization experiment could be used as a model across the region and state that it differs from similar efforts , such as those in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , and [LOC Egypt  ] in its methods and target audience . 
The September 17 edition of the [MISC US-based  ] " [ORG Terrorism Monitor  ] " credited the initiative 's success to the " full institutional participation of the [ORG LIFG  ] and its leadership , " in the reform project . 
By contrast , the [MISC Saudi Arabian  ] and [MISC Yemeni  ] models , for example , relied on " the conversion of militant individuals who may remain drawn ( willingly or otherwise ) to their former organizations . 
" In [LOC Egypt  ] , the work of the [MISC Egyptian  ] [MISC Islamic Jihad  ] , while renouncing violence , maintained a fairly extreme ideology , propounded primarily by a single leader of the organization . 
11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Libyan  ] government proudly explained the efforts to reconcile with [ORG LIFG  ] members during a September 6 meeting with [ORG NEA A/S Feltman  ] . 
During the meeting , Director of Military Intelligence and [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi confidante , [PER Abdullah  ] al-Sanussi , described the effort as a " revolutionary new method to combat terrorism and the influence of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] in the region , " and presented a pre-published copy of the recantation study . 
[LOC UK  ] diplomats have told us that the [MISC Libyans  ] have also given them a copy of the work , which they are translating in full and analyzing as a possible model for counter-radicalization efforts . 
Other diplomats have praised the program as a positive [ORG GOL  ] contribution to regional counterterrorism efforts . 
12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Amidst the positive international attention currently focused on [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's [ORG LIFG  ] counter-radicalization program , some observers have expressed skepticism to emboffs about the project . 
One [MISC Western  ] diplomat confided his personal view that the efforts were purely political and that even the [MISC Islamic  ] scholars involved in the effort , such as [PER Yusuf al-Qardawi  ] , had political agendas . 
A number of private [MISC Libyan  ] citizens agreed with the opinions expressed on some foreign-based blogs , that [LOC Libya  ] 's security organizations forced the [ORG LIFG  ] leaders to write the recantation and that some [ORG LIFG  ] members -- imprisoned in [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison for decades -- were simply motivated by the prospect of pardon and the hope of reuniting with their families . 
COMMENT 13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While local and international opinions are still being formulated on the initiative , the [ORG LIFG  ] 's renouncement of violent jihad and extremist ideology , and the document 's direct challenge to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , represents a significant achievement for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam in particular and the [MISC Libyan  ] government as a whole . 
The primary motivation for [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's backing of the initiative was undoubtedly regime security , and for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam , it may also have been political , designed to shore up his credentials both at home and abroad . 
We suspect that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government may well have contributed significant resources in the form of " financial assistance " to help ensure that the newly released fighters maintain their end of the bargain . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's immediate payoff on this investment is significant: the elimination of one of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's most staunch opposition groups and a high-profile public relations coup in [LOC Libya  ] 's ongoing quest to position itself as a leader in the [MISC Islamic  ] world . 
However , the long-term effects of the initiative , particularly with respect to the ideology of jihad and global counter-radicalization efforts , remains to be seen .
