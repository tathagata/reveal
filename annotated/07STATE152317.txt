( S ) URGENT ACTION REQUEST: IN SEPTEMBER DURING THEIR MEETING AT THE [ORG APEC  ] SUMMIT IN [LOC SYDNEY AUSTRALIA  ] , PRESIDENT BUSH DISCUSSED WITH [MISC CHINESE  ] PRESIDENT HU STRONG CONCERNS RELATING TO THE ONGOING TRANSSHIPMENT VIA [LOC BEIJING  ] OF KEY BALLISTIC MISSILE PARTS FROM [LOC NORTH KOREA  ] TO IRAN'S MISSILE PROGRAM . 
PRESIDENT BUSH PLEDGED TO RESPOND TO PRESIDENT HU'S REQUESTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION . 
EMBASSY SHOULD ON NOVEMBER 3 AT THE MOST EFFECTIVE LEVEL POSSIBLE , DELIVER THE NON-PAPER IN [ORG PARA  ] 8 WHICH RELATES TO SPECIFIC , TIME- SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT AN IMMINENT TRANSSHIPMENT . 
IN [LOC ADDITION  ] , AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY POST SHOULD DELIVER THE NON-PAPER IN [ORG PARA  ] 9 TO MFA AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE , PREFERABLY BY THE AMBASSADOR SINCE THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENTIAL-LEVEL DISCUSSIONS. ---------- OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/REL CHINA  ] ) Post should: -- ( This point for November 3 Delivery ) Request [LOC China  ] to stop an imminent shipment to [LOC Iran  ] 's ballistic missile program . 
This is the same cargo that the Ambassador shared about on October 25 ( ref E ) . 
It is now scheduled to leave [LOC Beijing  ] airport on November 4. -- ( This point for November 3 Delivery ) Note the importance of this demarche since it relates to a topic discussed by Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Hu  ] in [LOC Sydney  ] . 
Embassy should further note that the Embassy will be seeking an appointment at the highest level possible to convey a more extensive presentation on this topic of ballistic missile parts from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran.  ] --Remind [MISC Chinese  ] officials that President [PER Bush  ] has been personally engaged on the issue of the transshipment of ballistic missile parts between [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] via [LOC Beijing  ] and that he raised this issue with President [PER Hu  ] at the [ORG APEC  ] Summit . 
-- Seek information on the steps [LOC China  ] has taken since the [ORG APEC  ] discussion to address this issue and impress on them the necessity for [LOC China  ] to take immediate strong action . 
-- Stress that the credibility of [ORG UN Security Council  ] actions must be maintained by vigorous implementation by [ORG UN  ] Member [MISC States of UNSC  ] resolutions calling for [MISC Chapter VII  ] sanctions , particularly 1718 , 1737 , and 1747. --Indicate that the [LOC U.S.  ] believes that the proliferation of missile technology between [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] will increase and that these two countries will attempt to conduct these transfers through [MISC Chinese  ] territory. --Emphasize the need to inspect cargo and personal goods on regularly scheduled flights transiting [LOC Beijing  ] from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] in order to detect and deter these shipments. --Explain to [MISC Chinese  ] officials that the [LOC U.S.  ] carefully reviews the intelligence material that we have on shipments before we share it , and we ask that [MISC Chinese  ] authorities respect this and act on our information accordingly and appropriately. --Indicate that the [LOC United States  ] believes that we can work together cooperatively and effectively on these issues. --Express our willingness to continue to share as much information as possible to assist [LOC China  ] 's efforts to uphold these [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions. --------------------------------------------- ------------- [ORG Background: Ballistic Missile Parts Shipped via Beijing Between  ] [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/Rel China  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] have continued their longstanding cooperation on ballistic missile technology , via air- shipments of ballistic-missile related items . 
We assess that some of these shipments consist of ballistic missile jet vanes that frequently transit [LOC Beijing  ] on regularly scheduled flights on [ORG Air Koryo  ] and [ORG Iran Air  ] . 
We believe that the [ORG Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group  ] ( [ORG SBIG  ] ) is the probable end user for these parts . 
[ORG SBIG  ] is listed in the annex to [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 and these jet vanes are controlled under [MISC Item  ] 10.A.2 of the [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime and Item  ] 6 of [LOC China  ] 's missile- related export control regulations . 
Moreover , UNSCRs 1718 and 1737 prohibit the transfer to or from [LOC North Korea  ] or [LOC Iran  ] , respectively , of jet vanes and any other item listed in [MISC UNSC  ] document S/2006/815 . 
These shipments therefore represent violations of UNSCRs 1718 and <a id='par1737' href='#par1737'>¶</a>1737. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/Rel China  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] has raised this issue with [LOC China  ] at the highest levels several times in the last few months . 
In May 2007 , the [LOC United States  ] informed [LOC China  ] of imminent shipments on three separate occasions ( Refs A , B and C ) . 
Though [MISC Chinese  ] officials informed Embassy [LOC Beijing  ] that [LOC China  ] 's investigations have found no evidence of these transfers , it appears that these shipments did occur and are continuing to transit via [LOC Beijing  ] . 
In addition this issue was raised by ISN PDAS [PER Patricia McNerney  ] during bilateral nonproliferation talks in August 2007 ( Ref D ) . 
The Deputy Secretary also raised this issue with Executive Vice Foreign Minister ( [ORG EVFM  ] ) [PER Dai Bingguo  ] via during a telephone conversation in August . 
Finally , in September 2007 , President [PER Bush  ] discussed this issue with [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu  ] at the [ORG APEC  ] summit in [LOC Sydney  ] . 
The two leaders agreed that the [ORG USG  ] would provide the [ORG PRC  ] with further information on these transfers. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/Rel China  ] ) On October 25 the [LOC U.S.  ] provided [ORG PRC  ] officials with detailed information , including the airway bill and flight number , of another imminent shipment of military related goods from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] via [LOC Beijing  ] . 
This shipment was also assessed as destined for [LOC Iran  ] 's solid propellant missile development organization , the [ORG Shahid Bagheri Industries Group  ] ( [ORG SBIG  ] ) . 
We now have information that the goods will be shipped on November 4 and insist on a substantive response from [LOC China  ] to this information. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/Rel China  ] ) Our information indicates that at least 10 air shipments of jet vanes have transited [LOC Beijing  ] thus far and that these shipments will not only continue but will also grow in volume . 
We have encouraged the [MISC Chinese  ] to undertake frequent inspections of cargo on [ORG Air Koryo  ] or [ORG Iran Air  ] flights transiting [LOC Beijing  ] from [LOC North Korea  ] to both deter and detect these shipments. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/Rel China  ] ) The Department is seeking both immediate action on this new information and a strategic approach with regards to this critical issue . 
We assess that the best way to prevent these shipments in the future is for [MISC Chinese  ] authorities to take action , such as those identified in para 9 , that will make the [LOC Beijing  ] airport a less hospitable transfer point. --------------------------------------------- -------- NON-PAPER ON URGENT MATTER TO BE DELIVERED NOVEMBER 3 --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/Rel China  ] ) [PER Begin  ] points: -- Last week we raised with you information regarding [ORG North Korean  ] plans to send a shipment , probably for [LOC Iran  ] 's ballistic missile program , to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We believe the cargo is intended for [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group  ] ( [ORG SBIG  ] ) , which is responsible for [LOC Iran  ] 's solid-propellant ballistic missile program . 
You had requested additional information . 
-- We now have reason to believe that the items above will be shipped to [LOC Iran  ] via scheduled [ORG Iran Air  ] flight on November 4. --If these goods are missile-related , [LOC North Korea  ] is prohibited under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1718 from exporting missile-related items and [ORG UN  ] Member States are prohibited from importing those items . 
In addition , [LOC North Korea  ] would potentially be precluded under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 from transferring these items to [LOC Iran  ] if they are among the missile-related components included in S/2006/815 or if [LOC North Korea  ] or [LOC China  ] determines that they would contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems . 
Moreover , [ORG SBIG  ] is designated in [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1737 and , as such , is subject to the mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution . 
With these concerns in mind we are asking that [MISC Chinese  ] authorities investigate this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to [LOC Iran.  ] ------------------------------------------ BEGIN NON-PAPER FOR DELIVERY BY AMBASSADOR ------------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/REL CHINA  ] ) [PER Begin Points:  ] --Over the past several months we have raised with [MISC Chinese  ] officials the problem of ballistic missile-related transfers between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] being transshipped through [LOC China  ] . 
President [PER Bush  ] raised [LOC U.S.  ] concerns on this matter with President [PER Hu  ] during the [ORG APEC  ] summit in [LOC Sydney  ] , demonstrating the importance of the issue to the [LOC United States  ] . 
In response to President [PER Hu  ] 's request for additional details , we are providing you further information regarding these activities . 
Specifically , we are urgently providing information regarding an imminent shipment of serious concern . 
-- [LOC North Korea  ] is prohibited under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1718 from exporting missile- related items and [ORG UN  ] Member States are prohibited from importing those items . 
In addition , [LOC North Korea  ] would potentially be precluded under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 from transferring these items to [LOC Iran  ] if they are among the missile-related components included in S/2006/815 or if [LOC North Korea  ] or [LOC China  ] determines that they would contribute to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems . 
Moreover , [ORG SBIG  ] is designated in [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1737 and , as such , is subject to the mandatory asset freeze called for in the resolution . 
With these concerns in mind we are insisting that [MISC Chinese  ] authorities urgently investigate this shipment and prohibit it from proceeding to [LOC Iran.  ] --We are very concerned that [ORG North Korean  ] shipments of jet vanes occur on regularly scheduled commercial air flights transiting through [LOC Beijing  ] . 
We believe this has been the case on about 10 flights. --These items are likely intended for [LOC Iran  ] 's solid propellant missile development organization , the [ORG Shahid Bagheri Industries Group  ] ( [ORG SBIG  ] ) . --These cargo shipments probably include front companies. --We have identified a large number of shipments beginning late last year of what are probably ballistic missile-related items that have transited [LOC Beijing  ] , and we would like to share further information on these shipments. --14 December 2006: A delegation from [ORG SBIG  ] returned from [LOC Pyongyang  ] probably via [LOC Beijing  ] and transported what we assess to be jet vanes for a solid propellant medium range ballistic missile ( [ORG MRBM  ] ) under development in [LOC Iran.  ] --On or about 15 January 2007: [LOC North Korea  ] delivered what were probably jet vanes for [LOC Iran  ] 's developmental solid propellant [ORG MRBM  ] to [ORG SBIG  ] via [LOC Beijing  ] on board regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or around 23 January 2007: [LOC North Korea  ] delivered what were probably jet vanes for [LOC Iran  ] 's developmental solid propellant [ORG MRBM  ] to [ORG SBIG  ] via [LOC Beijing  ] on board regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or about 16 May 2007: An air shipment composed of four what were probably jet vanes from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [LOC Beijing  ] via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or about 24 May 2007: An air shipment composed of five what were probably jet vanes from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [LOC Beijing  ] via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or about 6 June 2007: An air shipment composed of four what were probably jet vanes from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [ORG Beijing  ] via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights . 
-- On or about 12 June 2007: An air shipment composed of five what were probably jet vanes from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [ORG Beijing  ] via regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or about 14 June 2007: An air shipment composed of three what were probably jet vanes from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [LOC Beijing  ] via regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or about 14 July 2007: An air shipment composed of ten what were probably jet vanes from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [ORG Beijing via  ] regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or about 26 July 2007: An air shipment possibly composed of an unknown number of jet vanes from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [LOC Beijing  ] via regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights. --On or about 22 August: An air shipment possibly composed of one jet vane from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran  ] for [ORG SBIG  ] was scheduled to depart [LOC North Korea  ] and transit [LOC Beijing  ] via regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights. --We believe that the number of jet vanes sent to [LOC Iran  ] will increase dramatically in the future. --To date we believe that about 40 probable jet vanes have been sent from [LOC North Korea  ] to [LOC Iran.  ] --The contract for these components called for a total number of 500 and we assess that shipments of these may increase to a rate of 100- 160 per month. --In addition , our information indicates that a second order of 1,500 components - possibly additional jet vanes - was agreed to in December of last year . 
-- We believe that this trade will continue to utilize regularly- scheduled commercial passenger flights. --As we have discussed on several occasions , [LOC Iran  ] also has been seeking probable tungsten-copper alloy plates from [LOC China  ] 's [ORG Dalian Sunny Industries  ] , also known as [ORG LIMMT  ] . 
[ORG Dalian Sunny Industries  ] shipped part of an order for this material in September . 
These plates are suitable for [MISC Iranian  ] domestic production of jet vanes or as an insulator for ballistic missile components . 
[LOC Iran  ] could be seeking these plates in case [LOC North Korea  ] is unable to provide the quantity or quality of jet vanes required. --We urge you to prevent such shipments via whatever action you deem appropriate , including frequent inspection of [ORG Iran Air  ] and [ORG Air Koryo  ] flights . 
The use of regularly-scheduled commercial passenger flights indicates that frequent regular inspections of [ORG Iran Air  ] flights and [ORG Air Koryo  ] flights are in order and would help deter these shipments in the future. --We will continue to provide you with relevant information to help end this proliferation. ------------------------------ Reporting Requirement and [ORG POC  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
