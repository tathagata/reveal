( U ) Participants: [LOC UNITED STATES Ambassador William R. Brownfield Senator  ] [PER Harry Reid  ] , Majority Leader , D-NV Senator [PER Thad Cochran  ] , R-MS Senator [PER Jeff Bingaman  ] , D-NM Senator [PER Byron Dorgan  ] , D-ND Senator [PER Mike Crapo  ] , R-ID Senator [PER Robert Menendez  ] , D-NJ Senator [PER Kent Conrad  ] , D-ND [PER Mike Castellano Anna Gallagher Marcel Lettre Federico De Jesus Serena Hoy Col.

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked by Senator [PER Menendez  ] if the time had arrived to shift [LOC U.S.  ] assistance from traditional [ORG Plan Colombia  ] programs towards alternative development and justice-sector projects , [PER Uribe  ] said that [LOC Colombia  ] had done much under [ORG Plan Colombia  ] , but more remains to accomplish . 
The [ORG GOC  ] controlled only fifty percent of its territory in 2000 , but now maintains a presence in every municipality . 
Spraying and manual eradication programs supported by the [LOC U.S.  ] would destroy over 200,000 hectares of coca in 2007 . 
[PER Uribe  ] said to maintain security and continue the fight against narco-trafficking , the [LOC U.S.  ] must continue its vital support. --------------------------------------------- ------- [ORG GOC  ] INVESTING IN JUSTICE AND ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Uribe  ] said his government had committed to justice programs and alternative development . 
He explained how the [ORG GOC  ] had passed important judicial reforms and almost doubled the budget for the justice system over the past four years . 
He noted that [LOC Colombia  ] began producing biofuel , and expanded coffee production by over one million bags over the last five years . 
[PER Uribe  ] reminded the [MISC Senators  ] of the difficulty of alternative development in a country with over 50 percent jungle terrain ( 578,000 square kilometers ) . 
He explained that the [ORG GOC  ] 's [MISC Forest Families  ] program works to secure the jungle by employing rural families to patrol and report illicit activity. ------------------------------- EXTRADITIONS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] explained that after he met with families of hostages held by the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) and spoke with [MISC French  ] officials about the release of [MISC French-Colombian  ] hostage [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] , he dropped his original position that he would not discuss a humanitarian exchange with the [ORG FARC  ] unless it coincided with a broader peace process . 
Despite pressure from [PER Chavez  ] and others , he had insisted that any humanitarian exchange include the three [MISC American  ] hostages . 
In contrast , the [ORG GOC  ] would not support the inclusion of extradited [ORG FARC  ] members in the [LOC U.S.  ] He explained that [LOC Colombia  ] had extradited over 650 criminals to the [LOC U.S.  ] to date , a level of cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] justice unprecedented anywhere else in the world . 
" For us , extradition is a policy that is non-negotiable , " he stated. --------------------------------------- [ORG TPA  ] WILL BRING INVESTMENT , SHOW SUPPORT --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senator [PER Crapo  ] asked for [PER Uribe  ] 's views on the [ORG TPA  ] and labor unionists' concerns . 
The President said the [ORG TPA  ] was economically important for his country , because it would help [LOC Colombia  ] attract foreign investment . 
He said the [ORG TPA  ] would probably not have a large immediate impact in increasing [MISC Colombian  ] exports to the [LOC U.S.  ] , but with increased foreign investment , their export sectors could develop to be more competitive in [LOC U.S.  ] markets . 
[PER Uribe  ] said the [ORG TPA  ] was also important for political reasons , since it would show [LOC U.S.  ] support for its best ally in the region . 
" I don't know how I could explain to my nation and the international community why the best friend of the [LOC U.S.  ] was not granted a [ORG TPA  ] , " he said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] said his government had made great efforts at improving the situation of labor unionists . 
In the past , 256 unionists were killed in a single year . 
In 2007 , 30 unionists had been killed to date , and investigations and prosecutions were underway . 
Since 2002 , the [ORG Prosecutor General 's Office  ] has prosecuted 56 cases of labor violence , sending 118 people to prison . 
In the majority of cases , [PER Uribe  ] said , the killer was not linked to the unionists' employers , but rather to terrorist groups that suspected the union members were helping rival gangs . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has protected over 6,000 people in 2007 , at a cost of nearly USD 40 million , including over 1200 unionists . 
[PER Uribe  ] said there were many private sector unions that disagreed with the large labor confederations' criticism of the [ORG TPA  ] . 
He held regular lunches with the large labor confederations to discuss labor issues , but noted that they would never accept the [ORG TPA  ] due to their ideological opposition to free trade and the [LOC United States.  ] ------------------------------------ URIBE: [PER CHAVEZ  ] POSES THREAT TO [LOC REGION  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked by Senator [PER Conrad  ] to comment on President [PER Chavez  ] , [PER Uribe  ] said he prefers to be prudent in statements about the leader of this significant trading partner . 
He had authorized opposition Senator [PER Piedad Cordoba  ] and [PER Chavez  ] to facilitate talks with the [ORG FARC  ] on a humanitarian accord after the families of the hostages implored him to do so . 
He recognized this was taking a great political risk , but saw [PER Chavez  ] as perhaps the only person respected enough by the [ORG FARC  ] 's leaders to reach an agreement to release the hostages. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] then reviewed the events that led him to suspend [PER Cordoba  ] 's and [ORG Chavez'  ] roles as facilitators . 
He said that in an October 12 meeting , [PER Chavez  ] told him that he wanted to meet with [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Marulanda  ] in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] told him this could only be done if the [ORG FARC  ] released an initial group of hostages , with a commitment to release the rest later . 
The meeting would also have to be conducted at a specific demilitarized point , not a general zone as proposed by [PER Chavez  ] . 
To [PER Uribe  ] 's surprise , [PER Chavez  ] publicly announced in [LOC Paris  ] that [PER Uribe  ] had given him approval to meet with [PER Marulanda  ] in [LOC Colombia  ] without mentioning any of the conditions set in their prior meeting . 
[PER Uribe  ] saw this as a violation of trust which put in question [ORG Chavez'  ] reliability as a facilitator. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] said the final factor that caused him to terminate [ORG Chavez'  ] mandate as a negotiator was [ORG Chavez'  ] call to [MISC Colombian  ] Army Commander [PER Montoya  ] , despite [PER Uribe  ] 's earlier specific instructions not to contact his military officials . 
[PER Uribe  ] stressed several times that this was " a violation of our institutional hierarchy , " explaining he had a duty to defend democratic values . 
[PER Uribe  ] said [PER Chavez  ] was trying to create a " personal empire , " and had expansionist plans in the region for his model of " new socialism . 
" [ORG Chavez'  ] model violated democratic values such as freedom of the press , local elections , and independence of the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
He likened the threat [PER Chavez  ] poses to [MISC Latin America  ] to that posed by [PER Hitler  ] in [LOC Europe.  ] ----------------------------------------- [PER URIBE  ] SEEKS SUPPORT FROM OTHER PRESIDENTS ----------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] mentioned he would see [PER Chavez  ] in [LOC Ecuador  ] on November 29 at President [PER Rafael Correa  ] 's inauguration ceremony of the new constitutional assembly . 
He said it would be a difficult trip , but a necessary one and he would not leave the stage exclusively to [PER Chavez  ] . 
In recent weeks , [PER Uribe  ] saw positive movements by [PER Correa  ] away from [MISC Chavez-type  ] radicalism , and he was not sure which way the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] leader would lean . 
[PER Uribe  ] said he also called several other [MISC Latin American  ] presidents to seek their support . 
[PER Uribe  ] said: " I do not want to leave political space for [PER Chavez  ] alone . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) This cable has been cleared by Senator [PER Reid  ] .
