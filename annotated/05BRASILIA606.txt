End Summary . 
Federalization Request Submitted to [ORG STJ  ] --------------------------------------- 2 ) ( U ) On March 4 , [LOC Brazil  ] 's Prosecutor General [PER Claudio Fonteles  ] submitted a formal request to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] to federalize the [PER Stang  ] murder case , i.e. take it over from [LOC Para  ] state authorities . 
( Note: Two months ago , the [ORG GOB  ] passed a law that allows the [ORG Federal Prosecutor  ] to take over major human rights cases from states . 
) After analyzing state documents on the investigation , [PER Fonteles  ] concluded that state authorities were negligent in protecting potential victims , reducing violence in the region , and prosecuting the case . 
[PER Fonteles  ] further stated that [LOC Para  ] state police have not been impartial and federalization is necessary to insure that the [ORG GOB  ] honors international human rights agreements . 
The [ORG STJ  ] has not yet released a ruling . 
3 ) ( U ) The [ORG Association of Brazilian Judges  ] ( [ORG AMB  ] ) released a press statement to express their " full disagreement " with [MISC Fonteles'  ] request because the [ORG AMB  ] asserted that the state police " efficiently responded to the demands of the case and followed the necessary steps to investigate and punish those responsible . 
" The group pointed out that homicide prosecutions are a state-level responsibility in [LOC Brazil  ] , and federalizing the case would be in conflict with [MISC Brazilian  ] judicial norms . 
[ORG Stang/Bastos Meeting  ] -------------------- 4 ) ( C ) On March 3 , [PER David Stang  ] , brother of murdered [LOC U.S.  ] citizen nun [PER Dorothy Stang  ] , met with Justice Minister [PER Marcio Bastos  ] to press for federalizing his sister 's murder case . 
[PER Stang  ] has been critical of state authorities for failing to protect his sister and believes that corruption and collusion with lumber and land interests in the state 's judiciary would jeopardize chances for a fair and effective trial in [LOC Para  ] state . 
Our contacts at [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] reported that [PER Bastos  ] expressed his confidence in the state judge in charge of the murder case but said that [ORG GOB  ] authorities would consider federalization when investigations have concluded . 
5 ) ( C ) On March 7 , [PER Stang  ] spoke to the [ORG Mission Consul General  ] about his meeting with [PER Bastos  ] and said that the meeting " went well . 
" [PER Stang  ] said he is convinced that [PER Bastos  ] wants justice , knows [LOC Para  ] is corrupt , and believes the federal government should handle the case . 
[PER Stang  ] also told the [ORG CG  ] that [PER Bastos  ] is " a very compassionate man ( who ) very much wants to federalize . . . but ( faces ) a complicated situation . 
" [PER Stang  ] noted that he was pleased to learn that [PER Fonteles  ] submitted a federalization request to the [ORG STJ  ] . 
Comment: -------- 6 ) ( C ) It appears that [PER Bastos  ] is open to federalizing the case but may be unable to admit this publicly due to diverging opinions within [LOC Brazil  ] 's judicial system ( per paragraph 3 ) . 
Despite the progress that the [LOC Para  ] state police and judicial system have made in investigating the [PER Stang  ] murder and the [ORG AMB  ] 's stance against federalization , post continues to believe that the case should be federalized to ensure successful investigation and prosecution .
