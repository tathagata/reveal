( C ) SUMMARY: On January 16 , [PER Joseph Wood  ] , Deputy Assistant to the Vice President for [ORG National Security Affairs  ] , met with [PER Philippe Errera  ] , strategic affairs adviser to FM [PER Kouchner  ] , and [PER Francois Richier  ] , strategic affairs adviser to President [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
[PER Errera  ] and [PER Richier  ] provided their views on [ORG NATO  ] , [ORG ESDP  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , the [LOC Iran  ] NIE , and President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's own guiding principles . 
Both advisers emphasized that [MISC French  ] reintegration into [ORG NATO  ] needs thorough consideration and is unlikely to take place before 2009 . 
They shared their concerns about recent signals from [LOC Russia  ] and described the " disastrous " consequences of the [LOC Iran  ] NIE on international efforts . 
Finally , they shared their perspectives on the principles that underlie President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's dynamic administration , including [LOC France  ] 's desire to be influential on the world scene while maintaining close relations with its allies . 
END SUMMARY. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ORG NATO  ] Reintegration -- Not Before 2009 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Both [PER Richier  ] and [PER Errera  ] noted that President [PER Sarkozy  ] has publicly accepted the principle of [MISC French  ] reintegration into [ORG NATO  ] . 
Furthermore , according to [PER Richier  ] , he is the first elected president in [LOC France  ] to go on the record as supportive of [ORG NATO  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should not underestimate the attitude shifts that have made reintegration politically feasible today . 
At the same time , both interlocutors stressed that the [ORG GOF  ] will not " rush " into a final decision on reintegration into the military command structure . 
[PER Richier  ] observed that the 2009 [ORG NATO  ] summit would be a reasonable timeframe for the announcement of a final decision , noting the need for a thorough evaluation of the implications of the decision . 
He added that [LOC France  ] 's defense white paper will include a vision for [MISC French  ] and collective security , but that the exercise will conclude no sooner than the end of April 2008. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Errera  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] prefers the term " normalization " to " reintegration , " in part to underscore for domestic political reasons that the [ORG NATO  ] of today is not the [ORG NATO  ] of previous eras . 
[PER Errera  ] said that President [PER Sarkozy  ] wants to work for a " new " [ORG NATO  ] , and that [LOC France  ] needs to be on the inside to work for reform . 
He stressed that use of the correct terminology should help frame the public dialogue that is certain to ensue in [LOC France  ] , despite the lack of public outcry responding to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's initial expressions of interest . 
[PER Richier  ] noted that there is much ignorance in [LOC France  ] today about what [ORG NATO  ] does ; for example , many think ISAF is under [ORG UN  ] auspices . 
[PER Errera  ] pointed out that the defense white paper commission , which is conducting a broad review of defense and security policy , includes people who are skeptical of [MISC NATO.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Errera  ] characterized this moment as " awkward , " given that formal discussions about the form of [MISC French  ] reintegration have not yet started . 
He noted that political commitment and practical considerations had to be developed simultaneously and incrementally , adding that the [ORG Joint Chiefs  ] must have a sense for where in [ORG NATO  ] [MISC French  ] officers would be posted , for example , before a decision is made . 
Most importantly , he said that [LOC France  ] ( including [PER Sarkozy  ] 's diplomatic adviser [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] ) wants to avoid the same mistakes that were made in the 1990s when reintegration was last on the table . 
To avoid repeating those mistakes , [PER Errera  ] said smaller , practical questions should not be permitted to become pressure points that could block a political decision . 
[PER Richier  ] said that it would be a mistake to set firm goals today on what had to be achieved before a political decision could be made , and that the overall direction is more important than the specifics . 
He acknowledged that there is suspicion in [LOC Europe  ] regarding [LOC France  ] 's motivations , and suspicion in [LOC France  ] regarding [ORG NATO  ] , that will need to be overcome . 
He pointed to President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's scheduled February 1 meeting with [ORG NATO  ] SYG [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] as one important step to alleviate some concerns. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Errera  ] said that generally , newer members of [ORG NATO  ] will view [MISC French  ] reintegration positively , reducing their current suspicion of [LOC France  ] for its non-normalized [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
On the other hand , newer members of [ORG NATO  ] use [ORG NATO  ] jobs to reward their top leadership , and [MISC French  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00000114 002 OF 004 reintegration would put a tight squeeze on command structures and high-level posts . 
High-level positions are also an issue with [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC U.K.  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ORG NATO  ] and [MISC ESDP: Inseparably  ] Linked - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Errera  ] stated that during [LOC France  ] 's upcoming [ORG EU Presidency  ] , President [PER Sarkozy  ] will push hard to strengthen [ORG European Security and Defense Policy  ] ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) , while working for a revitalized [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Richier  ] called this a transatlantic effort to strengthen [MISC European  ] security , while noting that billing it as an " alternative " to [ORG NATO  ] would be both politically and financially absurd . 
[PER Errera  ] observed that substantive progress on [ORG ESDP  ] will be very difficult , partly due to [MISC British  ] concerns . 
[PER Richier  ] expressed hope that [MISC European  ] defense budgets could increase , noting that the gap vis--vis the [LOC U.S.  ] is growing , but added that if budgets cannot be increased in the short term , efficiency must be increased. - - - - - - - - - [ORG NATO  ] Enlargement - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG Adriatic  ] 3: [PER Errera  ] said that [LOC France  ] is comfortable in principle with each of the [ORG Adriatic  ] 3 candidates . 
In particular , [LOC France  ] has " no problems " with [MISC Croatian  ] membership . 
However , [PER Errera  ] said [LOC Albania  ] seems to be taking acceptance for granted , and needs to make more of an effort to " clean up " corruption issues . 
Regarding [LOC Macedonia  ] , [PER Errera  ] said the [ORG GOM  ] underestimates the seriousness of the name issue for [LOC Greece  ] and that the [LOC U.S.  ] should not make the same mistake . 
[LOC France  ] will not pressure [LOC Greece  ] on this issue . 
Furthermore , if [LOC Athens  ] were to give in on the name issue , the [MISC Greek  ] government could fall , thus bringing in a new government which would be responsible for -- and presumably hostile to -- the [ORG NATO  ] enlargement ratification progress. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Georgia  ] and [PER Ukraine: Errera  ] said that the [ORG GOF  ] does not want a public dispute with the [LOC U.S.  ] on these issues before [LOC Bucharest  ] , adding that [MISC European  ] allies are hedging because [LOC Washington  ] is not sending clear signals . 
[PER Errera  ] expects that new [MISC Ukrainian  ] PM [PER Tymoshenko  ] will come out soon publicly in favor of [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Ukraine  ] , a step for which [LOC France  ] will " not have a great appetite . 
" [PER Errera  ] said [ORG MAP  ] is not just one more step in closer relations , but a serious decision in light of [ORG Article  ] 5 commitments . 
Regarding [LOC Georgia  ] , he said [PER Saakashvili  ] " pulled off the election somehow " but still not under ideal circumstances , and that [ORG NATO  ] may not be ready for [ORG Article  ] 5 guarantees to [LOC Georgia  ] either . 
That said , the [ORG GOF  ] has systematically made clear to [LOC Russia  ] that there is no [MISC Russian  ] redline or veto regarding [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
In response , [PER Wood  ] noted that [LOC France  ] 's hesitation regarding [ORG Article  ] 5 commitments implies a de facto " sphere of influence , " because [LOC Russia  ] is the only possible menace to [LOC Ukraine  ] or [LOC Georgia.  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ORG Russia: Negative Trends  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Richier  ] characterized the current [MISC Russian  ] regime as revisionist , saying that [PER Putin  ] made much-needed improvements to [MISC Russian  ] infrastructure but has gone too far in seeking to restore [LOC Russia  ] 's grandeur at the expense of international cooperation and development . 
Among the [MISC Russian  ] population , many are culturally and economically oriented towards the [LOC West  ] , but remain politically tied to [PER Putin  ] . 
According to [PER Errera  ] , [MISC Russian  ] judgment on important issues is worsening . 
In the past , [LOC Russia  ] has been difficult to work with , but has ultimately made the right decisions -- until recently . 
As an example , in President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's private meeting in [LOC Moscow  ] with President [PER Putin  ] , [PER Putin  ] was very hardline on [LOC Iran  ] ( notwithstanding [LOC Russia  ] 's exports of fuel for [LOC Bushehr  ] ) , but that in the subsequent press conference , [PER Putin  ] distanced himself on this issue , to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's surprise and chagrin . 
[PER Errera  ] said that in the past , [LOC Russia  ] did not mind hurting [LOC Iran  ] as long as [LOC Russia  ] was not hurt as well ; now [LOC Russia  ] seems not to want to hurt the [MISC Iranians.  ] - - - - - - - - - Energy Dependence - - - - - - - - - [LOC PARIS  ] 00000114 003 OF 004 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Both interlocutors noted that [LOC France  ] 's use of nuclear energy makes it less dependent than some other [MISC European  ] countries on [MISC Russian  ] oil and gas . 
That said , [PER Richier  ] expressed concern that [LOC Russia  ] is " grabbing " gas infrastructure and supply at a time of military buildup and strong rhetoric . 
He said that it will be difficult for [LOC Europe  ] to agree on a common energy policy , as there is currently no consensus , nor any great ideas , on how to solve the problem . 
[PER Richier  ] described [MISC Russian  ] policies as motivated to obtain short-term profit for individuals , rather than to build long-term , worldwide power . 
[PER Errera  ] observed that dependence on [LOC Russia  ] for energy is better than dependence on [LOC Iran  ] , which is the only other real option . 
He said that [PER Sarkozy  ] had made overtures to [LOC Algeria  ] on gas before and during his visit to [LOC Algiers  ] , but that [LOC France  ] was " stiffed . 
" Nor is there any sense that there will be progress with [LOC Algeria  ] on gas in the near term . 
[PER Errera  ] said that while [LOC France  ] seeks a commercial relationship , [LOC Algeria  ] views energy cooperation as complicated by history and tinged with a sense of nationalism. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - NIE: " The [ORG Best Christmas Gift Ahmadinejad Could Have Imagined  ] " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Both interlocutors called the [ORG NIE  ] a " disaster " that has " substantially jeopardized " progress on [LOC Iran  ] in the short term and will have lasting consequences , including eliminating [LOC France  ] 's ability to build consensus in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[MISC French  ] views are unchanged , but many others have been affected , and the [ORG NIE  ] destroyed not just the momentum of the international community but also what little leverage [LOC France  ] and the international community had on less radical [MISC Iranian  ] elements . 
[PER Errera  ] noted that the timing of the release of the [ORG NIE  ] was especially bad , with [ORG EU Political Directors  ] having been poised for a new [ORG UNSC  ] resolution just before the [ORG NIE  ] release . 
He said at the [ORG IISS Manama Dialogue  ] in December , speculation was rampant about why the current [LOC U.S.  ] administration did not better manage the report 's fallout by postponing its release or changing the characterization of [LOC Iran  ] 's enrichment activities as exclusively civil. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Both interlocutors said quick passage of a new [ORG UNSC  ] resolution , although likely to be a weak , is key . 
[PER Richier  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] has no incentive to negotiate and that the international community 's most effective mechanism has been creating a financially difficult operating environment for [LOC Iran  ] . 
If the perception declines in the financial community that investment in [LOC Iran  ] is dangerous , this will change . 
[PER Errera  ] noted the [ORG EU  ] might be able to go farther than the [ORG Security Council  ] will , perhaps with [LOC Gulf  ] countries and/or the [ORG G7  ] , to pressure [LOC Iran  ] on continued uranium enrichment by raising the price for doing so. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Errera  ] also said that an intelligence team from the [MISC French  ] [ORG DGSE  ] traveled to the [LOC U.S.  ] recently to meet with their [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts regarding the [ORG NIE  ] , and was disappointed that the information shared was " even less " than has been reported in the press . 
This reception did not help the perception shared by some in the [ORG GOF  ] that [LOC France  ] has not been treated as a full partner by the [LOC U.S.  ] , despite working side-by-side and fielding criticism following the [ORG NIE  ] release. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [PER Sarkozy  ] 's Governing Philosophy - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Errera  ] said that two clear priorities underlie [PER Sarkozy  ] 's administration . 
The first is realigning [MISC French  ] presence with [MISC French  ] objectives , and reestablishing [MISC French  ] influence where it had been diminished ( for example , within the [ORG EU  ] , by giving momentum to the simplified [ORG EU  ] treaty ) . 
[PER Errera  ] said [LOC France  ] will maintain its influence in [LOC Africa  ] but seeks to rebalance its overseas investments , for example by creating a military base in the [LOC UAE  ] . 
[PER Errera  ] said that [LOC France  ] cannot say [LOC Iran  ] is a key threat without investing more in the [LOC Gulf  ] and that the [MISC Iranians  ] will " get the message . 
" He noted that the new base in the [LOC UAE  ] will be the first [MISC French  ] military installation not in a former colony . 
Secondly , [PER Errera  ] said that [PER Sarkozy  ] believes in the concept of " the [LOC West  ] , " making him the first non-Gaullist [MISC French  ] president not to consider [LOC France  ] an exclusively independent actor . 
This [LOC PARIS  ] 00000114 004 OF 004 identification provides [PER Sarkozy  ] a clear course for steering [MISC French  ] policy even on difficult questions like dealing with [MISC Libyan  ] President [PER Qadhafi.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Richier  ] suggested that [PER Sarkozy  ] 's core conviction is that [LOC France  ] must be pulled into the 21st century . 
He said [PER Sarkozy  ] likes to use the metaphor of a person who exercises for the first time in a while -- many muscles may be sore afterwards , but the exercise has done them good . 
[PER Richier  ] said he sees new energy in [MISC French  ] diplomacy , focused on bringing diversity and reconciliation to the global stage . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] wishes to encourage countries to accept the diversity ( ethnic , religious , etc . 
) within their own societies , as tolerance for others is key to democracy . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] also recognizes a need for reconciliation and believes the effort to correct the course of a " bad guy " is worthwhile ( COMMENT: In public [PER Sarkozy  ] has defended his outreach to [PER Qadhafi  ] and [PER Hugo Chavez  ] along these lines . 
) According to [PER Richier  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] believes the short-term costs of talking to rogue actors by using carrots and helping them move forward are less than the long-term costs of inaction . 
However , he also recognizes the importance of not creating gaps between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] in reaching out to " bad guys , " marking a departure from previous [MISC French  ] governments . 
Finally , [PER Richier  ] noted that " relations with [MISC Islam  ] " and climate change were two immediate priorities of President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's that would nevertheless remain on the [MISC French  ] agenda .
