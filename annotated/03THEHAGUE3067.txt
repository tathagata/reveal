( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] Political Director [PER Hugo Siblesz  ] told [PER Amb Sobel  ] on December 15 that the failure of the [ORG EU Council  ] to agree on a constitution this weekend means that the [ORG Inter-Governmental Council  ] ( [ORG IGC  ] ) likely will continue through the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency . 
He said the wounds are too raw for a solution to be easily found during the [MISC Irish  ] presidency in the first semester of 2004 . 
POL Counselor asked about the [MISC Dutch  ] position on a two-speed [LOC Europe  ] , noting that the [LOC Benelux  ] countries were among those cited as possible participants and yet the [MISC Dutch  ] historically do not want to choose sides among the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Siblesz  ] said that a two-speed [LOC Europe  ] would pose a major dilemma for the [MISC Dutch  ] government . 
He said that even were the [MISC Dutch  ] eventually to join such a movement , they would not do so until after their presidency . 
[PER Siblesz  ] also said that [MISC Italian  ] PM [PER Berlusconi  ] 's method of trying to resolve [ORG IGC  ] problems through bilateral discussions was a mistake because it deprived him of the peer pressure that would have come out of group sessions . 
Privately , other officials said it was clear that [PER Chirac  ] was not going to compromise under any circumstance . 
[PER Siblesz  ] said [PER Chirac  ] was trying to claw back from [LOC Nice.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Subsequently , POL Counselor spoke with [PER Peter de Gooijer  ] , Office Director for [ORG EU  ] affairs and a man very close to FM Bot . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] consider it very important not to jump to the conclusion that the failure in [LOC Brussels  ] last weekend automatically opens the possibility of a two-speed [LOC Europe  ] . 
Rather , [PER de Gooijer  ] said they should let the dust settle and tempers ease , then talk to the [MISC Irish  ] about how to further the process during the [MISC Irish  ] presidency . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] said that even if the [MISC Dutch  ] must assume the [ORG IGC  ] , they would be under no obligation to set a deadline for the end of their presidency . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] already have a full agenda they do not want to derail: setting the principles for the budget debate and advancing [LOC Tampere  ] .
