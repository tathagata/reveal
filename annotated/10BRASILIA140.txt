( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
At the [ORG Copenhagen Conference  ] of the Parties to the [ORG UN Framework Convention  ] on [ORG Climate Change  ] ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) , the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) announced the mitigation actions it plans to take to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 36.1 percent to 38.9 percent by 2020 compared with " business as usual . 
" Now , the [ORG GOB  ] has gained [ORG Congressional  ] support for its climate change policy , which has been incorporated into domestic legislation . 
For good measure , the [ORG Congress  ] has approved a separate law creating a [ORG National Climate Change Fund  ] . 
This fund will support mitigation and adaptation projects and will rely principally on a to-be-determined portion of future oil and gas revenues . 
END SUMMARY . 
THE NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY LAW <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the [LOC Bali  ] conference in December 2008 , the [ORG GOB  ] released its first [ORG National Climate Change Plan  ] . 
The plan consists of a detailed listing of a host of current and planned measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sectors: forests , agriculture , energy , transportation , etc . 
( [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) Most notably , the [ORG Plan  ] included a goal of sharply cutting the rate of deforestation in the [LOC Amazon  ] by nearly 70 percent by 2017 . 
The [ORG Plan  ] came out of extensive work by an interministerial group , and it obtained the approval of President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] . 
The [ORG Plan  ] provided the basis for the ambitious position that the [ORG GOB  ] took at [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
As a next step , the [ORG GOB  ] sought [ORG Congressional  ] endorsement of its climate change goals and efforts . 
Accordingly , the [ORG Congress  ] passed legislation ( Law 12.187/2009 ) , which President [PER Lula  ] signed on December 29 , 2009 , that reflects the position the [ORG GOB  ] presented at [LOC Copenhagen  ] , which was later inscribed into the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] . 
( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG National Policy on Climate Change Law  ] is a short piece of legislation - just six pages - that sets forth the general principles [LOC Brazil  ] will follow . 
Highlights of that legislation include: - Adopting mitigation actions ( which the [ORG GOB  ] will determine ) to reach a voluntary national goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 36.1 percent to 38.9 percent compared with projected emissions by 2020 . 
( Art . 
12 ) - Requiring that climate change reduction efforts be compatible with sustainable development and economic and social interests . 
( Art . 
4 and Art . 
5 ) - Designating the principal instruments for implementation , most importantly: the [ORG National Climate Change Plan  ] ( which empowers the [ORG GOB  ] authority to establish individual mitigation activities ) ; the [ORG National Climate Change Fund  ] ( discussed below ) ; [LOC Brazil  ] 's submission to the [ORG UNFCCC Conference  ] of the Parties ; and fiscal measures . 
( Art . 
6 ) - Authorizing the [ORG Executive Branch  ] to establish sectoral plans for mitigation and adaptation with the objective of creating a low carbon economy . 
( Art . 
11 ) - Creating the [MISC Brazilian  ] Market for Emissions Reductions ( [ORG MBRE  ] ) to provide for trading in avoided emissions certificates. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] intends to unveil in March a revised [ORG National Climate Change Plan  ] . 
There are at least two significant changes expected to be made to the 2008 [ORG Plan  ] . 
First , the [ORG GOB  ] intends to reduce the rate of deforestation in the [LOC Amazon  ] by 80 percent by 2020 . 
This is a bit more ambitious than the 2008 [ORG Plan  ] , which called for a reduction of about 70 percent by 2017 . 
Second , the revised [ORG Plan  ] will likely contain a goal to reduce the rate of deforestation in the [MISC Brazilian  ] savannah region ( the [LOC Cerrado  ] ) by 40 percent by 2020 . 
This was the next largest mitigation measure announced at [LOC Copenhagen  ] after reducing the rate of [LOC Amazon  ] deforestation . 
THE NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND LAW <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Besides obtaining congressional support for its climate change policy , the [ORG GOB  ] sought to establish a new domestic climate change financing mechanism . 
Consequently , the [ORG Congress  ] enacted a law ( No. 12.114 , dated December 9 , 2009 ) that creates the [ORG National Climate Change Fund  ] with the purpose of supporting " projects or studies and financing of undertakings that aimed at mitigating climate change and adapting to the effects of climate change . 
" The legislation calls for the [ORG Environment Ministry  ] to set up a [ORG Steering Committee  ] , which includes six federal government representatives and five representatives from non-governmental sector. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Fund  ] will provide financial support for mitigation actions , adaptation measures , education and training , payment for environmental services related to contributing to carbon stocks , reducing deforestation and recuperating of degraded forest areas . 
The [ORG National Development Bank  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) will administer the [ORG Fund  ] . 
This is the same bank that administers the [ORG Amazon Fund  ] , which has received pledges of over a [MISC US$1  ] billion from [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Germany  ] for conserving the [LOC Amazon  ] forest . 
( [ORG REFTEL  ] C ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The principal source of funding for the [ORG National Climate Change Fund  ] is meant to be from a special participation in oil royalties under the [ORG National Energy Policy Law  ] ( No. 9.478 of August 6 , 1997 ) . 
That law is amended to provide ( [ORG Article  ] 50 ) that in case of high earnings from oil or gas the President may decree a special participation , which will be shared between the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] and this new [ORG Fund  ] . 
( COMMENT . 
Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] has spoken of the [ORG Fund  ] potentially receiving billions of dollars from the exploitation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's vast offshore oil and gas reserves . 
However , it is likely to take many years before those revenues come on line , and then the President will have to decide whether and how much of a special participation to give the [ORG Fund  ] . 
END COMMENT . 
) The [ORG Fund  ] may also receive budget contributions and international and national donations. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG COMMENT:  ] The [ORG GOB  ] has obtained congressional approval for its climate change policy , including the overall voluntary target of reducing emissions by 36.1 to 38.9 percent by 2020 . 
Further , it has obtained a broad mandate to develop individual domestic measures to achieve the overall goal . 
The legislation creating a [ORG National Climate Change Fund  ] is a positive step forward , though it leaves the contentious issue of funding unresolved . 
With these two pieces of legislation , the [ORG GOB  ] will go to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] COP-16 in [LOC Mexico  ] with the backing of [ORG Congress  ] for the ambitious position it laid out in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
END COMMENT .
