( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary: At  ] an August 19 congress , the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] - the minority member in [LOC Iceland  ] 's ruling conservative coalition alongside PM [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] ) , replaced former PM [PER Asgrimsson  ] as party chair with Minister of Industry and [ORG Commerce Jon  ] [PER Sigurdsson  ] . 
Party rank and file and most media shrugged off [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's farewell speech slamming the [ORG USG  ] over the impending closure of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] , instead focusing on whether [PER Sigurdsson  ] 's charisma will suffice to reverse the party 's decline under [PER Asgrimsson  ] . 
We believe [PER Sigurdsson  ] will be open to cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on modernizing security ties and strengthening trade , but should he fail to reverse the [ORG PP  ] 's slide by the May 2007 national elections , [PER Haarde  ] may be forced to seek another coalition partner - one more to the left and less open than the [MISC Progressives  ] to close bilateral security ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] End summary. ------------------------------------------- Halldor Bows Out - But Not Quite Gracefully ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) held a party congress 18-19 August to elect new leadership after the [MISC Progressives'  ] embarrassing performance in nationwide municipal elections this May ( Ref A ) . 
On 5 June , [ORG PP  ] Chairman Halldor [PER Asgrimsson  ] announced his resignation as Prime Minister and his plans to resign from his party seat upon election of new party leadership in August ( Ref B ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Asgrimsson  ] used his farewell speech at the congress to take a parting shot at the [LOC U.S.  ] , describing the decision to withdraw [LOC U.S.  ] troops as " a breach of confidence . 
" [PER Asgrimsson  ] said his former [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) colleagues in the coalition had been most guilty of having " blind faith " in the [LOC U.S.  ] Local press coverage of the speech was mostly matter-of-fact ; only opposition-leaning newspaper [ORG Frettabladid  ] fronted [ORG Asgrimmson  ] 's criticism of the [LOC U.S.  ] Rather , most coverage - and [ORG PP  ] rank-and-file attendees polled by Poloff - portrayed the speech as a less than distinguished final act to [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's long political career. --------------------------------------------- ---- A New Hand at the [LOC Helm  ] , but How [MISC Much Will Change  ] ? --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the leadership elections 19 August , Minister of Industry and [ORG Commerce Jon  ] [PER Sigurdsson  ] easily won the race for [ORG PP  ] Chair over Minister of Health [PER Siv Fridleifsdottir  ] , who as party secretary through the May elections had shared the blame for the [ORG PP  ] 's poor showing . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] , an economist and [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor before entering politics , pledged to build unity within the party while respecting the work of his predecessor [PER Asgrimsson  ] . 
Minister of Agriculture [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] retained his post as Vice Chair in an apparent show of support for the party 's defense of agricultural subsidies - a policy which the increasingly urbanized population does not hold so dear. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Public discussion was divided on whether [PER Sigurdsson  ] can reverse the party 's decline . 
Morgunbladid , which generally reflects the views of PM [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG IP  ] , editorialized that [PER Sigurdsson  ] 's election gave the [ORG PP  ] a great chance to get back on its feet . 
Conversely , [ORG Frettabladid  ] opined that [PER Sigurdsson  ] 's platform breaks no new ground , and that retaining the same Vice Chair will only solidify the party 's stagnation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recent statements - including to Ambassador last month ( ref C ) - [PER Sigurdsson  ] has given little indication that he would attempt to change his party 's focus . 
Newly-elected [ORG PP  ] Secretary [PER Saeunn Stefansdottir  ] confirmed to Poloff after the congress that she anticipates little change in the party 's platform , but expects that the " atmosphere within the party will be much different , " in terms of generating enthusiasm among the party faithful . 
The first post-congress opinion poll on 23 August registered little change in [ORG PP  ] 's support. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is too soon to say whether [PER Sigurdsson  ] 's charisma will suffice to win back voters who have abandoned the party . 
The [ORG PP  ] suffers from an image as " the party of elderly farmers " at a time when [LOC Iceland  ] 's shifting demographics have eroded the [ORG Progressives'  ] traditional base . 
The [ORG PP  ] has thus far failed to give urban conservative voters a reason to choose it over the [ORG Independence Party  ] , which is seen as more confident and forward-looking. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We believe that [PER Sigurdsson  ] will be open to close cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on security and trade . 
In the short term , [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's departure should help the pragmatic [PER Haarde  ] 's effort to work with us on refocusing bilateral security cooperation from a [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000312 002.2 OF 002 [MISC Cold War  ] paradigm toward emerging threats such as terrorism . 
Yet if [PER Sigurdsson  ] is unable to reverse the [ORG PP  ] 's slide , the May 2007 national elections - which [ORG Independence  ] is likely to dominate but without winning a clear majority - may leave [PER Haarde  ] no choice but to partner with the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] or even the [ORG Left-Green Party  ] . 
Such a coalition would likely be less enthusiastic about close bilateral security ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] , looking more toward [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG EU  ] for support. van Voorst</pre></code>
