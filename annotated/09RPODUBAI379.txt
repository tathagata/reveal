REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: On September 11 Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] gave the main [MISC Tehran Friday Prayer  ] sermon . 
In his comments [PER Khamenei  ] sought to characterize his treatment of opposition in line with the practices of both the first [PER Shia Imam Ali  ] and also with that of his predecessor [PER Ayatollah Khomeini  ] . 
He said while criticism within the framework of the existing political system was acceptable , those fundamentally opposing the system and seeking to harm the nation 's security will be dealt with decisively . 
In keeping with previous warnings about the " soft overthrow " of the existing order , he cautioned against dissolution from within , saying that the only way to prevent this was to remain true to religion , revolutionary principles , and to [PER Khomeini  ] 's teachings . 
The recent Presidential election with its massive turnout proved to the world that " regardless of whom the people voted for " they still believed in the system . 
Referring to [LOC Iran  ] 's position on the international stage , [PER Khamenei  ] said [LOC Iran  ] took pride in standing against the oppressive nature of its enemies and that [LOC Iran  ] wouldn't be cowed into relinquishing its rights , " nuclear or non-nuclear . 
" He called for a large turnout on the September 18 Qods Day march in support of the [MISC Palestinian  ] people , although warning that this event should not be used to " sow dissension , " an implied reference to the fact that " [ORG Green Path  ] " oppositionists are reportedly seeking a massive turn-out on this day as a show of strength. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMMARY ( CONT ) : Although Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] 's tone was consistently mild , [MISC Iranian  ] press and IRPO contacts have interpreted this speech as a clear warning to the " [ORG Green Path  ] " oppositionist leaders to cease and desist , an interpretation reinforced by the contemporaneous release of a Judiciary panel report stating that [PER Mehdi Karrubi  ] 's allegations of prisoner abuse were both baseless and also politically motivated , and the forwarding of this case to judicial authorities for possible prosecution ( reftel ) . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) On September 11 , Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] gave both [MISC Tehran Friday Prayer  ] Sermons ( normally there are two , the first covering ostensibly religious topics , the second focusing more on issues of the day ) . 
As the date fell on the anniversary of the martyrdom of [LOC Imam Ali  ] , the first [PER Shia Imam  ] , the topic of his first sermon was the government of [LOC Imam Ali  ] . 
Although putatively non-political in nature , [PER Khamenei  ] used this sermon to set the stage for themes to which he would refer back in his second , political , sermon . 
He pointed out the moral nature of [LOC Imam  ] [PER Ali  ] 's government , adding that " when religion is separated from politics , politics becomes immoral and secular . 
" In an implicit comparison with current times , he also stressed that [LOC Imam Ali  ] consistently preferred to be lenient in dealing with those who opposed him , until and unless there was a threat to the system , at which point he would act decisively . 
TYPES OF CONFLICT <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In the start of his second , political speech , Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] said he wished to address his remarks to those in [LOC Iran  ] 's political sphere . 
Dissension had been a feature of the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] since its founding . 
These conflicts have had different causes , to include theoretical differences of opinion , conflicts of interest and clashing personalities . 
Referring implicitly to his comments on the management style of [LOC Imam Ali  ] , [PER Khamenei  ] said that [PER Khomeini  ] 's normal method for dealing with dissension and conflict was to use moderation and leniency . 
In an implicit reference to [ORG Mir  ] [PER Hossein Mousavi  ] and [PER Mehdi Karrubi  ] , each of whom has referred back to his own revolutionary credentials , [PER Khamenei  ] said that at times [PER Khomeini  ] had to deal with conflicts even with those who had solid revolutionary backgrounds , at the level of the Prime Minister ( i.e . 
[PER Mousavi  ] himself ) , President ( [PER Khamenei  ] himself ) and even at levels above the President ( a reference to [PER Khomeini  ] 's dismissal of Supreme Leader-designate [PER Ayatollah Montazeri  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Khamenei  ] said the system didn't seek to stifle those who " think differently " ( note: 'd igar andishan , " a term used to refer to the intellectual current associated , inter alia , with the [MISC Khatami-ist  ] 'Second of [MISC Khordad'  ] movement ) . 
It was good for [LOC Iran  ] 's officials to have critics point out weaknesses if those [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000379 002.2 OF 003 doing so act within and accept the basic principles of the system , and the government will not move against such criticism. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) However , again drawing the link to [LOC Imam Ali  ] , [PER Khamenei  ] said that during [PER Khomeini  ] 's time if there were danger of infiltration of " harmful principles " into the system , and if this conflict were in some way a threat to core principles , [PER Khomeini  ] would then " act decisively . 
" The regime , much like any human being , had to defend itself against such an attack . 
Linking his actions to those of [LOC Imam Ali  ] and [PER Khomeini  ] , [PER Khamenei  ] said that today also the regime will act if it senses that someone is acting against its principles and security . 
AVOIDING CORRUPTION FROM WITHIN <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) In keeping with recent dominant public warnings about " soft overthrow " and " soft wars , " [PER Khamenei  ] turned to the theme of corruption from within , both at an individual and societal level . 
At an individual level , deviation from principles and susceptibility to corruption were to be avoided at all costs , as small slips and mistakes could lead to larger ones in a slow and gradual process . 
The cure for such threats is self-awareness , piety and the ongoing moral policing of friends and family . 
If such impiety is happening to a government official the problem is worse , as it affects society. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) At a societal and governmental level , deviation from principles and susceptibility to corruption can happen in much the same manner . 
The decay comes from within , and although on the outside the society can still appear like an " [LOC Islamic Republic  ] , " on the inside it could suffer degradation and decay . 
In this regard , societal dynamics can either be positive or negative . 
Positive dynamics means moving ever closer towards justice and religion , which improves social , political and economic conditions and also improves society 's abilities to stand up to one 's enemies . 
But a society with negative dynamics will have growing class and social differences and worsening political and economic conditions . 
Instead of using freedom for growth , such a decaying society will abuse freedom to pursue corruption , sin and dissension . 
Such negative dynamics also cause the society to " feel weak and retreat " in the face of one 's enemy , unilateral disarmament and relinquishing one 's rights , nuclear and non-nuclear , which is another sign of societal decline . 
ELECTION <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] said the June 12 Presidential election with its massive turnout was a glorious triumph for the [MISC Islamic  ] Revolution . 
The turnout demonstrated to the world that the [MISC Iranian  ] people believed in their system of government now more than ever , " regardless of who voted for whom . 
After the election , the enemy sought to create disturbances in order to diminish [LOC Iran  ] 's achievement and weaken the peoples' confidence in the system , but to no effect . 
There will be similarly large turnout in future elections , [PER Khamenei  ] predicted , showing the ongoing support of the people . 
IRAN'S ENEMIES <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] said all governments have enemies , but what is important to note is the nature of one 's friends and enemies . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's friends are [MISC Muslim  ] nations and peoples throughout the world , and the oppressed of the world . 
Its enemies are the thieves and oppressors of the world , and [LOC Iran  ] should not be scared to be the enemies of the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC U.K.  ] It was important for [LOC Iran  ] to show strength in the face of such enemies . 
[LOC DUBAI  ] 00000379 003.2 OF 003 [MISC QODS  ] DAY <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] said that many on the global stage have tried to bury the issue of [LOC Palestine  ] , but [LOC Iran  ] has prevented that , a fact which has upset " the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC Zionists  ] . 
" He called for a massive turnout of support on the September 18 Qods Day Rally in [LOC Tehran  ] , and cautioned all that no one should use this event to sow dissension , an implicit reference to " [MISC Green Path  ] " opposition plans to use this authorized march as a show of its own strength. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT: Although  ] his tone was mild , [LOC Iran  ] oppositionist press in addition to IRPO interlocutors with ties to the " [MISC Green Path  ] " opposition have said that , in the words of one source , " [PER Khameni  ] 's speech was being viewed ominously in [LOC Iran  ] , " especially when viewed in conjunction with the contemporaneous release of a Judiciary panel report stating that [PER Mehdi Karrubi  ] 's allegations of prisoner abuse were both baseless and also politically motivated , and forwarding the case to judicial authorities for possible prosecution ( reftel ) . 
According to one executive branch official , [PER Khamenei  ] 's speech has made " the specter of the arrest of [PER Karrubi  ] - and possibly even [PER Mousavi  ] at a later stage " all the more probable. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) COMMENT ( CONT ) : Contrary to [PER Khamenei  ] 's assertions and as evidenced by recent comments by IRGC Commander [PER Jaafari  ] , the regime 's interpretation of legitimate dissent has constricted dramatically , with [MISC Jaffari  ] equating " soft overthrow " with those seeking to change [LOC Iran  ] 's behavior in any way . 
Certainly , [PER Khamenei  ] seems to be trying to regain the high ground he forfeited by descending so openly into the political fray , as shown by his attempts to draw comparisons among himself , [PER Khomeini  ] , and [LOC Imam Ali  ] . 
Separately , the Supreme Leader 's formulation of " relinquishing ones rights , nuclear or non-nuclear " as a sign of societal dissolution and immorality indicates that [LOC Iran  ] will continue to adhere to its hard public line in advance of any future negotiations . 
Finally , it is also worth noting that Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] made no endorsement , either explicit or implicit , of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , saying only that the recent Presidential election was good due to the turnout , " regardless of who voted for whom . 
" END COMMENT .
