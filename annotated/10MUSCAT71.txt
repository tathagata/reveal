( C ) Summary: A recent [ORG New York Time  ] 's ( [MISC NYT  ] ) article describing [MISC Patriot  ] missile deployment to countries in the [LOC Gulf  ] in order to counter [LOC Iran  ] , assuage [LOC Israel  ] , and reassure our [LOC Gulf  ] partners has been disquieting to the [MISC Omani  ] Government . 
There has never been an official [ORG USG  ] offer of [ORG Patriots  ] to [LOC Oman  ] , due in large part to the [ORG GoO  ] 's rejection of any undertaking that might include or would imply the presence of [MISC Patriot  ] missiles here . 
[LOC Oman  ] 's close partnership with the [ORG USG  ] , particularly through the [ORG Base Access Agreement  ] ( [ORG BAA  ] ) , is contingent on maintaining an extremely low profile and continuing the Sultanate 's foreign policy objective of carefully balancing public perception of its relationships with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
Press of this sort , however unintended , makes it extremely difficult for [LOC Oman  ] to maintain that balance . 
End Summary . 
Press Articles on [LOC Missile Defense  ] in the [LOC Gulf  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) A [MISC NYT  ] article appeared on January 30 titled " [LOC U.S.  ] Speeding Up Missile Defenses in [LOC Persian Gulf  ] , " which quoted General [PER Petraeus  ] as saying that [MISC Patriot  ] missile batteries would be located in four gulf countries , and noted that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] already has [ORG Patriots  ] . 
An unnamed military official named the countries as [LOC Qatar  ] , the [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Bahrain  ] and [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
The version of this article syndicated by the [MISC NYT  ] news service includes the sentence " [LOC Oman  ] , which has always been sensitive about perceptions that it is doing [LOC U.S.  ] bidding , has also been approached , but there is no deployment of [ORG Patriots  ] there , according to [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
" ( Note: That sentence does not/not appear in the version currently available via the [MISC NYT  ] website , and it is unclear to post if it appeared in the print edition on January 31 ; the syndicated version of the article is otherwise not substantially different from the [MISC NYT  ] original . 
End Note ) . 
The item was picked up by regional press on January 31 , quoting the [MISC NYT  ] article and specifically noting that " [LOC Oman  ] has declined the offer . 
" On February 2 , the private [MISC English  ] daily " [ORG Times of Oman  ] " carried a front page article titled " Missile [MISC Shield:  ] [LOC Oman  ] denies receiving any offer from [LOC US  ] . 
" In it , [PER Sayyid Badr  ] al [PER Busaidi  ] , Secretary General of the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , is quoted as saying , " the Sultanate 's position on such matters is firm and that it does not ... enter into alliances or axis ( sic ) against any state . 
" He stressed that [LOC Oman  ] " does not allow its territory to be used to carry out any military operations against any country in the region . 
" [LOC Oman  ] is not Interested ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Embassy has no record of a formal offer of [MISC Patriot  ] missiles made to [LOC Oman  ] by the [ORG USG  ] . 
However , a number of discussions have occurred in which [ORG USG  ] intent was to gauge [MISC Omani  ] interest in collective missile defense capability . 
[LOC Oman  ] has consistently shown a lack of interest and has politely declined to engage in substantive discussions on " shared early warning " systems , " integrated air defense , " or " collective defense . 
" ( Note: This is likely due to its assessment that [LOC Iran  ] does not pose an imminent threat , its desire to not needlessly antagonize [LOC Iran  ] , and its distrust of fellow [ORG GCC  ] members , making it unwilling to share data within that group . 
End Note . 
) Further , in official correspondence , the [ORG Ministry of Defence  ] ( [ORG MoD  ] ) rejected an offer for a " Missile and [ORG Air Defence Working Group  ] " on February 6 , 2009 ; rejected further offers for an " [ORG Air and Missile Defense Shared Early Warning  ] ( [ORG SEW  ] ) System " on March 30 , 2009 , citing [LOC Oman  ] 's " unwillingness to commit itself to a [ORG SEW  ] " ; and on July 22 , 2009 again rejected any participation in the " [ORG Air Defense Missiles Advanced Warning  ] System " project . 
Direct [MISC Omani  ] Reaction ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Omani Royal Office  ] made contact with the Embassy on February 2 to express strong concern about the article and its repercussions , as that office had just received a pointed inquiry from the [PER Sultan  ] on this matter . 
In a follow-up discussion embassy officer provided the history of discussions on the issue , of which the [ORG Royal Office  ] was previously unaware , due to what was described as a " lack of lateral coordination within the [ORG GoO  ] . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] The strength of [LOC Oman  ] 's immediate reaction , and the level at which it transpired , is reflective of the tremendous seriousness with which this matter is viewed by the [ORG GoO  ] . 
It is likely that one of the goals of [PER Badr  ] 's media statement was to protect the [MISC U.S./Omani  ] relationship , as any belief that the [LOC U.S.  ] would attempt to utilize [MISC Omani  ] territory in this way could potentially cause a public backlash that would jeopardize other aspects of our relationship . 
The deployment of [ORG Patriots  ] to [LOC Oman  ] , especially with the goal of countering the [LOC Iran  ] threat , would run completely counter to [LOC Oman  ] 's publicly-stated foreign-policy objectives . 
Although they do not find the threat imminent , [LOC Iran  ] is [LOC Oman  ] 's number one strategic threat ; however , the [ORG GoO  ] fundamentally believes the threat can be mitigated through careful management of the relationship . 
Therefore , the [ORG GoO  ] works very deliberately to create a public perception of balance in its relationships with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Oman  ] 's security strategy of keeping a low public profile in general has been threatened by the attention brought by the [MISC NYT  ] article , and the [ORG GoO  ] is working to manage the message for the public .
