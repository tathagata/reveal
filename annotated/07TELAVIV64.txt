Jones  ] , [ORG Reason  ] 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Madam Secretary , internal tensions among [MISC GOI  ] leaders have intensified since your last visit and have reached the point that there appears to be little coordination or even dialogue among the key decision makers . 
Therefore , we will need to be sensitive to perceptions that we are favoring one faction over another . 
The divisions at the top here are part of an increasingly gloomy public mood , with a new corruption allegations making headlines virtually daily , and a growing sense of political failure despite [LOC Israel  ] 's strong economy and a sustained success rate in thwarting suicide attacks . 
Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] 's approval ratings were only 23 percent in the latest poll , and [MISC Israeli  ] interlocutors across the political spectrum are speaking openly of a crisis of public confidence in the country 's leadership at a time when [MISC Israelis  ] feel an urgent need for strong leadership to face the threats from [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
OPTIMISM ERODING ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The year 2007 has started off badly for [MISC Israelis  ] . 
The good feeling generated by PM [PER Olmert  ] 's long-delayed December 23 summit meeting with [PER Abu Mazen  ] quickly dissipated under the weight of reports of a new settlement in the [LOC Jordan Valley  ] ( now suspended by [PER Peretz  ] ) , continued [MISC Qassam  ] rocket attacks on [LOC Sderot  ] and neighboring kibbutzim , foot-dragging on both sides in implementing the transfer of tax revenues , lack of progress on the release of Cpl. [PER Gilad Shalit  ] , and the unpleasant atmospherics of the January 4 Olmert-Mubarak summit , which was overshadowed by a botched [ORG IDF  ] daylight raid in the center of [LOC Ramallah  ] in which four [MISC Palestinians  ] were killed. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC Ramallah  ] operation , which was authorized by the [ORG IDF  ] 's [LOC West Bank  ] commander without informing the Minister of Defense , served as a stark reminder of the lack of coordination between [LOC Israel  ] 's military and its civilian leadership . 
When it comes to [LOC Israel  ] 's strategy for dealing with [MISC Palestinians  ] , it increasingly seems that military is military , civilian is civilian and never the twain shall meet ! 
Despite [PER Olmert  ] 's belated embrace of [PER Abu Mazen  ] as a peace partner , there is growing concern that moderate [MISC Arab  ] willingness to maintain the embargo on [ORG Hamas  ] may be eroding , and that [PER Fatah  ] may fail to muster the popular support it will need to depose [ORG Hamas  ] , whether at the ballot box or in the streets . 
Meanwhile , the upcoming release of the results of the [ORG Winograd Commission  ] 's investigation of the [LOC Lebanon  ] war hangs like a sword of Damocles over the heads of [PER Olmert  ] , Defense Minister [PER Peretz  ] , and [ORG IDF  ] Chief of General [PER Staff Halutz  ] . 
[PER Peretz  ] and [PER Halutz  ] have both publicly stated that they will resign if the [ORG Commission  ] holds them responsible for serious errors in the conduct of the war , but [PER Olmert  ] has refrained from public comments . 
[PER Olmert  ] is also awaiting the results of several separate investigations involving corruption allegations , any one of which could further damage him severely , if not force his resignation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) While [MISC Israeli  ] anxiety over a possible dramatic shift of [LOC U.S.  ] policy as a result of the [ORG Iraq Study Group  ] 's report has been allayed by statements by you and the President , there continues to be deep uneasiness here that the [MISC Baker-Hamilton  ] recommendations reflect the shape of things to come in [LOC U.S.  ] policy . 
[MISC Israelis  ] recognize that [LOC U.S.  ] public support for the [LOC Iraq  ] war is eroding and are following with interest the President 's upcoming articulation of the revamped policy , but they are deeply concerned that [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] issues not become linked in [MISC American  ] minds to creating a more propitious regional environment for whatever steps we decide to take to address the deteriorating situation in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program continues to cause great anxiety in [LOC Israel  ] . 
Given their history , [MISC Israelis  ] across the political spectrum take very seriously [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's threats to wipe [LOC Israel  ] off the map . 
[PER Olmert  ] has been quite clear in his public comments that [LOC Israel  ] cannot tolerate a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] , a position stated even more emphatically by opposition leader [PER Netanyahu  ] , who compares today 's [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC Nazi Germany  ] in 1938 . 
Despite the worst-case assessments of [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence , however , there is a range of views about what action [LOC Israel  ] should take . 
The [ORG MFA  ] and some of the think tank [LOC Iran  ] experts appear increasingly inclined to state that military action must be a last resort and are taking a new interests in other forms of pressure , including but not limited to sanctions , that could force [LOC Iran  ] to abandon its military nuclear program . 
The [ORG IDF  ] , however , srikes us as more inclined than ever to look toward a military strike , whether launched by [LOC Israel  ] or by us , as the only way to destroy or even delay [LOC Iran  ] 's plans . 
Thoughtful [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00000064 002 OF 003 [MISC Israeli  ] analysts point out that even if a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] did not immediately launch a strike on the [MISC Israeli  ] heartland , the very fact that [LOC Iran  ] possesses nuclear weapons would completely transform the [LOC Middle East  ] strategic environment in ways that would make [LOC Israel  ] 's long-term survival as a democratic [MISC Jewish  ] state increasingly problematic . 
That concern is most intensively reflected in open talk by those who say they do not want their children and grandchildren growing up in an [LOC Israel  ] threatened by a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER LIVNI  ] RISING ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) FM [PER Tzipi Livni  ] is frustrated by [PER Olmert  ] 's continued refusal to coordinate closely , and -- perhaps with an eye on polls showing her popularity at over double the level of the Prime Minister -- suggested to a [ORG Ha'aretz  ] interviewer in late December that she would challenge [PER Olmert  ] for the prime ministership if he continued not to give her his full backing . 
In the same interview , [PER Livni  ] provided an outline of her thinking , but not a detailed plan , on the way ahead with the [MISC Arabs  ] , including negotiating an interim agreement with the [MISC Palestinians  ] in which the separation barrier would serve as the border , and refusing to engage with [LOC Syria  ] unless [PER Asad  ] takes steps to end support for terrorism and distances himself from [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Livni  ] 's policy adviser has confirmed to us that she has engaged in her own discrete discussions with [MISC Palestinians  ] , but very much in an exploratory mode . 
[PER Livni  ] told [PER Senators Kerry  ] and [PER Dodd  ] that she doubted that a final status agreement could be reached with [PER Abu Mazen  ] , and therefore the emphasis should be on reforming [PER Fatah  ] so that it could beat [ORG Hamas  ] at the polls . 
[ORG MFA  ] officials tell us that [PER Livni  ] is also focused on the need to keep [ORG Hamas  ] isolated . 
She and her senior staff have repeatedly expressed concern that some [ORG EU  ] member-states are wobbly on this point . 
Meanwhile , [PER Livni  ] is keenly aware that unlike [PER Olmert  ] , she has little to fear from the [ORG Winograd Commission  ] report ( nor is she tainted by the corruption allegations that dog [PER Olmert  ] ) . 
Her incipient bid to take [PER Olmert  ] 's place could become more serious once the report 's preliminary conclusions are released next month . 
SHIFTING VIEWS ON [LOC SYRIA  ] ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [PER Olmert  ] and [PER Livni  ] agree that negotiations with [LOC Syria  ] would be a trap that [LOC Damascus  ] would use to end the international pressure on it and to gain a freer hand in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
While they see public relations downsides to dismissing [MISC Syrian  ] peace overtures out of hand , they continue to insist that no negotiations will be possible until [LOC Syria  ] reduces its support for terrorism and/or takes direct steps to secure the release of [MISC Israeli  ] prisoners held by [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[PER Olmert  ] and [PER Livni  ] are supported in that view by [ORG Mossad  ] chief [ORG Dagan  ] , who takes a dim view of [MISC Syrian  ] intentions . 
A significant part of the security establishment , however , appears to be reaching the conclusion that it is in [LOC Israel  ] 's interest to test [PER Asad  ] 's intentions -- possibly through the use of a back channel contact -- and to seek to wean him away from [LOC Tehran  ] . 
They are joined in that view by Defense Minister [PER Peretz  ] , much of the [ORG Labor Party  ] and the [MISC Israeli  ] left , who argue that [LOC Israel  ] cannot afford to refuse to at least explore [PER Asad  ] 's offer to negotiate , often comparing that stance to [PER Golda Meir  ] 's much-criticized decision to spurn [PER Sadat  ] 's offer to negotiate , which then led to the 1973 Yom [ORG Kippur War  ] . 
Press reports January 5 stated that the defense establishment had recommended to [PER Olmert  ] that he open an exploratory channel to [LOC Damascus  ] in two months , a timeline reportedly linked to the completion of reviews of [LOC U.S.  ] policy toward [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , as well as to clearer indications of [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's intentions and capabilities vis a vis [ORG Hamas  ] . 
PERETZ-OLMERT TENSIONS ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to leaks from a recent [ORG Labor Party  ] leadership meeting , [PER Amir Peretz  ] said that he feels completely disconnected from [PER Olmert  ] . 
Ever since [PER Peretz'  ] telephone conversation with [PER Abu Mazen  ] which infuriated [PER Olmert  ] , the two reportedly barely speak to each other . 
Television news reports on January 4 trumpeted rumors that [PER Olmert  ] had decided to remove [PER Peretz  ] as Defense Minister and replace him with former Prime Minister [PER Ehud Barak  ] , who has already announced plans to challenge [PER Peretz  ] for the [ORG Labor Party  ] 's leadership in late May primaries . 
Even though the Prime Minister 's Office almost immediately denied the reports , there is little doubt here that someone in the [ORG PMO  ] was behind them . 
While much of the [ORG Labor Party  ] feels that [PER Peretz  ] has been a failure , both as Defense Minister and as [ORG Party Secretary General  ] , and [PER Peretz'  ] popularity with the general public has hit rock bottom , Labor [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00000064 003 OF 003 members widely condemned the media trial balloon , which they saw as an unacceptable attempt by [PER Olmert  ] 's advisers to intervene in their party 's leadership contest . 
In any event , the incident is yet another indication of the intense degree of personal rancor and dysfunction prevailing at the top of the [ORG GOI  ] . 
[PER PERETZ  ] AND [PER SNEH  ] OUR [ORG AMA  ] PARTNERS -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding the [ORG GOI  ] 's internal discord , there is some good news in our efforts to nudge the [ORG GOI  ] toward improvements in [MISC Palestinian  ] quality of life issues . 
Despite his political woes , [PER Peretz  ] has proven himself a serious partner in our efforts to implement the Agreement on Movement and [ORG Access  ] ( [ORG AMA  ] ) and more generally in a slow but steady push by the [ORG MOD  ] to force a reluctant [ORG IDF  ] to accept steps to reduce barriers to [MISC Palestinian  ] movement and to revive the [MISC Palestinian  ] economy . 
Deputy Defense Minister [PER Efraim Sneh  ] , who will likely accompany [PER Peretz  ] to your meeting , has emerged as the point man for these efforts . 
[PER Sneh  ] shares [PER Peretz'  ] conviction that [LOC Israel  ] 's security stranglehold on the [MISC Palestinians  ] is " winning the battle but losing the war , " but [PER Sneh  ] , who in a decades-long career served as a military governor of the [LOC West Bank  ] , commanded an elite combat unit , and took part in the famed [LOC Entebbe  ] raid , also has both an intimate knowledge of the [MISC Palestinians  ] and a combat commander 's credibility with the [ORG IDF  ] that [PER Peretz  ] sorely lacks . 
Your meeting with [PER Peretz  ] provides an opportunity to express appreciation for his and [PER Sneh  ] 's efforts and to encourage them in their struggle to bring recalcitrant elements in the [ORG IDF  ] to heel . 
The more progress we can achieve with them on [ORG AMA  ] implementation now , the easier it will be to achieve meaningful results with both parties in the coming year. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [ORG Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the [ORG State Department  ] 's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** JONES</pre></code>
