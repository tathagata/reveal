<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 002754 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR PM , EUR E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 11/09/2019 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/MARR_0.html'>MARR</a> SUBJECT: INFORMATION ON SECURITY DIALOGUE WITH [LOC RUSSIA  ] REF: STATE 112900 [ORG Classified By: Political M/C Susan M. Elliott  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOR  ] have four existing , formal mechanisms for conducting security dialogues with the [LOC Russian Federation  ] ; all four are scheduled yearly . 
1 ) Joint Staff Talks ( JSTs ) : This event is hosted annually by [LOC U.S.  ] Joint Staff J-5 or the [ORG GOR  ] Chief of the [ORG Main OPS Directorate  ] on a rotational basis . 
The agenda is dynamic , but is typically focused on international military/security issues , mil-to-mil ( M2M ) cooperation , and transparency as nominated by the respective sides . 
2 ) Bilateral Defense Consultations ( BDCs ) : Hosted by [ORG ASD/ISA  ] and the Director of International Relations , [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MoD  ] on a rotational basis . 
Agenda is more policy and pol-mil oriented , but it is subject to items nominated by the respective sides . 
3 ) General Officer/Flag Officer Discussions ( GO/FO ) : Alternatively hosted by [ORG EUCOM  ] J5 and [ORG GOR  ] MoD equivalent ; agenda is more narrowly focused on AOR issues and developing direction for construction of the bilateral workplan ( [ORG WP  ] ) . 
4 ) [ORG US-GOR Colonels Working Group  ] ( CWG ) : Objective is to discuss and nominate events for the following year 's [ORG WP  ] . 
In practice , they meet more than once per year , alternating sites between [LOC Stuttgart  ] and [LOC Moscow.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition , as a result of the [ORG Presidential  ] summit in [LOC Moscow  ] in July , the Presidents directed their respective senior military officers to establish a military-to-military working group under the auspices of the Bilateral [ORG Presidential Commission  ] . 
The primary objective of this group will be to enhance military cooperation consistent with the [MISC Presidents'  ] broader cooperative agenda. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In practice , [ORG CJSC  ] and [ORG CHOD  ] will conduct 2-3 day counterpart visits every other year , with discussion agendas and visit venues to be determined by the respective sides . 
Ad hoc engagements vary , based upon interests of the respective sides . 
In the past these have included: --STRATCOM-Strategic [ORG Rocket Forces  ] ; --U.S . 
[ORG Air Forces Europe-GOR Air Force  ] ; --NORTHCOM/NORAD-RF [ORG Air Force  ] ; -Incidents at sea/Main Navy Staff talks between [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] ; -GO/FO delegation exchanges between [ORG EUCOM Component Commands  ] and elements of the [MISC Russian  ] Armed Forces. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We believe dialogue was first established by mutual consent in the late 1980s . 
The frequency of these meetings has been determined by informal understanding. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The most recent [MISC CJCS-CHOD  ] security dialogue meeting came when the [ORG CJCS  ] came to [LOC Moscow  ] July 6-9 . 
No set schedule determines the frequency of such meetings , but the event is placed on the [ORG WP  ] and dates are left to respective sides to negotiate . 
The next scheduled meetings are: --JSTs: December 14-18 ; --BDCs: Although featured as an event on the 2009 [ORG WP  ] , they will probably not be executed this year due to ongoing military reforms and personnel shifts within [ORG GOR  ] MoD ; --GO/FO Consultations: TBD ; --CWG: November 17-19 ; --INCSEA/Main Navy Staff Talks: December 10-11 in [LOC Moscow.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOR  ] expect officers to meet with their rank/position equivalents. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) While useful and meaningful exchanges do take place during the contacts discussed above , a number of challenges [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002754 002 OF 002 in effecting real , substantive and ongoing Military-to-Military ( M2M ) dialogues exist . 
These challenges include: 1 ) Lack of [MISC Russian  ] transparency and reciprocity: The [ORG GOR  ] [ORG MoD  ] has not changed its modus operandi for information exchange nor routine dialoguing since the end of the [MISC Cold War  ] . 
For example , [MISC Russian  ] delegations routinely refuse to share their briefing materials with us , even when presented with formal requests for these materials . 
Representatives of the [ORG GOR  ] [ORG MoD  ] are closely monitored by their [ORG Military Intelligence  ] ( [ORG GRU  ] ) handlers , and are loathe to engage in any dialogues outside of tightly controlled statements recited from prepared texts . 
While [LOC U.S.  ] hosts will often invite [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MoD  ] delegations to different bases for tours and exchanges , [LOC U.S.  ] delegations are rarely afforded visits anywhere but dedicated conference facilities at [ORG MoD  ] HQ in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
Access to [MISC Russian  ] academic institutions is particularly problematic . 
Visiting [LOC U.S.  ] delegations from [ORG Senior Service Schools  ] are afforded , at best , a one-hour visit at [ORG MoD  ] HQ to meet with a single representative of the [ORG GOR  ] [ORG MoD External Liaison Division  ] . 
Despite deliberate [LOC U.S.  ] transparency regarding its actions in [LOC Russia  ] 's " near abroad , " the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MoD  ] is loathe to provide information about its activities . 
A recent example occurred over the last six months: while the [LOC US  ] provided information to [LOC Russia  ] concerning our limited training activities with the [ORG Georgian Armed Forces  ] , [LOC Russia  ] provided no information regarding a series of [ORG Collective Security Treaty Organization  ] exercises occurring in [LOC Belarus  ] and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] involving some 12,000 [MISC Russian  ] troops . 
2 ) Coordinating DoD Relations with [ORG Russia: Russia  ] was integrated into the [ORG EUCOM  ] AOR as a result of the publication of the 2002 [ORG Unified Command Plan  ] ( [ORG UCP  ] ) . 
[LOC Russia  ] , however , resents the " delegation " of its relations to a " regional command " and refuses to interract with [ORG EUCOM  ] on a continuing , formal basis . 
DoD efforts to date have managed to gain some recognition by [LOC Russia  ] of [ORG EUCOM  ] 's role in the M2M relationship . 
For example , [LOC Russia  ] has not accepted initiatives to conduct a [MISC COM EUCOM-CHOD  ] exchange . 
Efforts need to continue along these lines to formalize the relationship . 
3 ) Lack of Continuity/Followup: While exchanges with the [MISC Russians  ] have been executed according to the [MISC U.S.-Russia Bilateral Workplan  ] ( [ORG WP  ] ) , they have suffered from a lack of continuity . 
This is often characterized by a lack of formally acknowledged minute and action items . 
In many ways , every meeting therefore is similar to a " restart " of a new forum , rather than a continuation of an extablished venue with review of previous business , followup actions , etc .
