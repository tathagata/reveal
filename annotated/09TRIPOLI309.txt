REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) According to the [MISC Egyptian  ] embassy , the on-going extraordinary ministerial meeting of the [ORG African Union  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] has unfolded as expected - with [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] making grandiose statements calling for a supranational body and " gradualist " states like [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , and [LOC South Africa  ] countering that the [ORG AU  ] must remain an intergovernmental body that respects state sovereignty . 
Delegates were to discuss an [ORG AU Commission  ] report on modalities for further integration , but the [MISC Libyan  ] hosts withdrew the report immediately before the meeting . 
Several states , reportedly led by [LOC Namibia  ] , complained and called on the [ORG Commission  ] to release the report to member states . 
2 . 
( C ) Al-Qadhafi reportedly used the forum to call for still greater expansion of [ORG AU  ] executive powers - which he has previously envisaged as controlling continental defense , trade , and economy - to include a common foreign policy set by the central authority . 
Delegates reportedly referred the matter to a committee which is to use the withdrawn [ORG AU Commission  ] report , the earlier [LOC Dakar  ] report on integration , and al-Qadhafi 's April 15 speech as a framework . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] embassy was unsure whether the committee 's findings would be presented April 16 or at the July [ORG AU  ] summit meeting ; al-Qadhafi reportedly " promised to present a surprise " at the July meeting during his remarks . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] embassy described the proceedings as political theater that made " no progress " toward al-Qadhafi 's vision of a federal [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Africa  ] . 
DELEGATES COMMEMORATE 1986 ATTACKS ON TRIPOLI , [ORG BENGHAZI  ] 3 . 
( C ) Members of the visiting delegations were also invited to the April 14 commemoration of the 1986 [LOC U.S.  ] bombings of [LOC Tripoli  ] and [ORG Benghazi  ] ( [ORG Operation El Dorado Canyon  ] ) - an annual event held at al-Qadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Past years have featured prominent public speeches and demonstrations . 
In contrast , [MISC Egyptian  ] delegates described the event as much more subdued without speeches by al-Qadhafi or the Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] . 
Instead , guests were treated to a dinner and a special documentary on the attacks ( described as " rhetorical and ideological " but not inflammatory ) .
