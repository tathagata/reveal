End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Frances Fragos Townsend  ] , Assistant to the President for [ORG Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  ] , was hosted for a July 7 working lunch in [LOC Rabat  ] by [PER Yassine Mansouri  ] , Chief of the [ORG External Studies Directorate General  ] ( [ORG DGED  ] ) , [LOC Morocco  ] 's premier intelligence agency . 
Joining the lunch were [PER Abdelatif Hammouchi  ] , Director-General for [MISC Territorial Surveillance  ] ( [ORG DGST  ] ) , which has the lead on domestic counterterrorism operations , and [PER Charki Draiss  ] , Chief of the [ORG National Police  ] force ( [ORG DGSN  ] ) . 
[PER Townsend  ] was accompanied by Ambassador [PER Riley  ] , [PER Adnan Kifayat  ] and [PER John Pearson  ] of the [ORG NSC  ] staff , and [ORG Emboffs.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Welcoming [PER Townsend  ] to [LOC Morocco  ] , [ORG DGED  ] Chief [PER Mansouri  ] affirmed that the country has enjoyed a long-standing and very cooperative security relationship with the [ORG USG  ] , to the benefit of both sides . 
[PER Townsend  ] expressed [LOC U.S.  ] satisfaction with the security relationship and particular gratitude for [LOC Morocco  ] 's robust efforts to shut down the foreign fighter pipeline to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Moroccans  ] made clear that stopping foreign fighters bound for [LOC Iraq  ] or other destinations was a major [ORG GOM  ] priority. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DGST  ] Chief [PER Hammouchi  ] noted that [LOC Morocco  ] has disrupted 83 different terrorist cells since the 2003 [LOC Casablanca  ] bombings . 
A number of cells identified have had connections to the [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG GSPC  ] , he noted . 
[PER Mansouri  ] added that the terrorist adversary is " very strategically minded " and is always seeking ways to maximize the impact of attacks by exploiting outside events . 
[PER Townsend  ] strongly agreed: The timing of the attempted car bombs in [LOC London  ] and the [LOC Glasgow  ] airport attack to coincide with the transition from the [PER Blair  ] to the [MISC Brown  ] government , was a case in point , she opined. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Townsend  ] asked her hosts about the [ORG GOM  ] 's approach to monitoring and controlling materials that can be precursors to explosives . 
[LOC TATP  ] , which was used in the April attacks in [LOC Morocco  ] , is made from readily available ingredients , she noted . 
[PER Hammouchi  ] stated that the broad availability of explosive precursors was a source of frustration for the [ORG GOM  ] . 
He recalled a case in which a violent Jihadist had sent his wife on 38 separate trips , in multiple cities , to buy hydrogen peroxide from pharmacies . 
" Our only weapon against this phenomenon is information , " [PER Hammouchi  ] opined. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The security chiefs underlined their conviction that the terrorist threat to [LOC Morocco  ] was transnational in nature . 
At least 12 cells wrapped up in recent years have had direct connections to groups operating in [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Northern Mali  ] , and [LOC Spain  ] . 
Of particular concern is recent information that a number of individuals in terror camps in [LOC Northern Mali  ] have moved from training units to operational units . 
This information , and the approach of important events on [LOC Morocco  ] 's political calendar , such as the " [MISC Fete  ] du Throne " ( Throne Day ) and the parliamentary elections in early September , prompted [LOC Morocco  ] to elevate its alert level on July 5. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Townsend  ] asked the security chiefs for their assessment of [LOC CT  ] cooperation between the countries of the [LOC Maghreb  ] region . 
Cooperation with the [MISC Algerians  ] was erratic , [PER Hammouchi  ] assessed . 
Sometimes they provide very good information and sometimes it seems like a one-way street . 
They make difficult partners , [PER Mansouri  ] added , speculating that they still suffered psychic trauma from their bloody RABAT 00001229 002 OF 003 struggle against terror in the 1990s , a battle they fought largely on their own . 
Security cooperation with [LOC Libya  ] has been good , [PER Mansouri  ] noted , they are ready to work with us and exchange information . 
There has been an improvement in cooperation with the [MISC Tunisians  ] as well , he continued , though he opined that they are still prone to denial in assessing the terror threat. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to the ideological front in the war on terror , the security chiefs affirmed that [LOC CT  ] disruption and preemption operations alone were not sufficient to defeat the enemy . 
" We have had to become involved in the ideological battle , even if this isn't our business , " [PER Hammouchi  ] stated . 
" Unfortunately , political and diplomatic restraints often limit our ability to act , " he added . 
Citing President [PER Bush  ] , [PER Townsend  ] affirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] belief that the war of words and ideas is a core theater of battle , but often an area where [MISC Muslim  ] leaders can be more effective than [MISC Americans.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Townsend  ] asked about lines of authority within the [MISC Moroccan  ] government in pursuing the ideological battle against terrorists . 
[PER Mansouri  ] responded that there was a diffusion of authority , with the security agencies , the [ORG Ministry of Communications  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Religious Affairs  ] all countering extremism in different ways . 
[PER Townsend  ] observed that this mirrored the diffusion of counter-extremist efforts in the [ORG USG  ] , but wondered if both systems wouldn't benefit from centralization of efforts. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Subsequent to the lunch , Minister of Interior [PER Chakib Benmoussa  ] welcomed [PER Townsend  ] , the Ambassador , [ORG NSC  ] staff , and emboffs to his office . 
The Minister was joined by Minister-Delegate [PER Fouad Ali Himma  ] ( who , as a long-standing friend and close advisor of King [PER Mohammed VI  ] , is generally considered more powerful than the Minister ) , and senior MOI officials [PER Khalid Zerouali  ] , [PER Mohieddine Amzazi  ] , [PER Noureddine Benbrahim  ] , and [PER Abderahmane Achour.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Affirming her appreciation of strong bilateral security cooperation , [PER Townsend  ] asked her hosts for more background on [LOC Morocco  ] 's recent decision to elevate its state of alert . 
The Minister said that information developed following recent arrests of [MISC Moroccans  ] in the [LOC U.K.  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and [LOC Morocco  ] , a continuing stream of general threat information , and upcoming events including the [MISC Fete  ] du Throne and the legislative elections all prompted [MISC Moroccan  ] security officials to conclude that it would be prudent to elevate the alert level. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Townsend  ] expressed understanding , mentioning the [ORG USG  ] 's experience that it was relatively easy to raise the alert level , but more difficult to bring it back down . 
Explaining such decisions to the public was always tricky , she added . 
[PER Himma  ] agreed that the relationship between the security services and the public was crucially important and merited constant attention . 
Educating the public about the nature of the threat and enlisting them as allies is particularly important he added. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Defending the Malikite rite of [LOC Islam  ] , native to [LOC Morocco  ] , against intolerant theological strains flowing out of the [LOC Middle East  ] was a major priority for King [PER Mohammed VI  ] and his government , [PER Himma  ] emphasized . 
He asserted that in [LOC Morocco  ] " our people are religious and conservative , but not fundamentalist . 
Our rite is completely opposed to radical theology . 
" [PER Himma  ] cited recent efforts to overhaul and upgrade the religious education system in the country , traditionally subsidized by the monarchy . 
The [ORG GOM  ] is working hard to strike a balance between [MISC Moroccan  ] tradition and modernity , seeking to take the best from both . 
[PER Himma  ] also cited the King 's human development initiative , launched in 2005 , as an important piece of the counter-extremist puzzle. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Townsend  ] complimented the Minister for [LOC Morocco  ] 's apparent success in integrating various elements of the [ORG GOM  ] involved in countering terror and extremism into a cohesive team . 
[PER Himma  ] affirmed that the [ORG GOM  ] strives to work as one integrated unit , and also lauded the strong security cooperation [LOC Morocco  ] enjoys with countries like the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] . 
" But our ambition is even higher , " [PER Himma  ] continued . 
We would like to have the same level of coordination and cooperation with our neighboring countries , particularly [LOC Algeria.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Recalling a visit to [LOC Algiers  ] as the King 's personal envoy , [PER Himma  ] asserted that repeated [MISC Moroccan  ] efforts [LOC RABAT  ] 00001229 003 OF 003 to bridge the diplomatic chasm had been rebuffed . 
He claimed that he had told the [MISC Algerians  ] that [LOC Morocco  ] was prepared to reopen its border and take any of a number of other confidence building measures , " but the [MISC Algerians  ] would never tell us what they want . 
" He attributed what he described as [MISC Algerian  ] intransigence to a generational and mind-set gap between the leaderships of the two countries . 
Noting that [LOC Algiers  ] was the next stop on her multi-country itinerary , [PER Townsend  ] said she would encourage the [ORG GOA  ] to expand security cooperation with [LOC Morocco  ] and to work hard to realize a broader rapprochement with its neighbor. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Prior to her arrival in [LOC Rabat  ] , [PER Townsend  ] visited the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Consulate General  ] in [LOC Casablanca  ] , which was targeted during a twin suicide bomb attack on April 14 . 
The [ORG CG  ] , [ORG RSO  ] , and Emboffs briefed [PER Townsend  ] on the incident , showing her the site of the bomb which detonated near the [ORG Consulate General  ] , and the site of the bombing which targeted the [ORG American Language Center  ] one block away , which was apparently mistaken for a [ORG USG  ] facility . 
[PER Townsend  ] reviewed CCTV footage of the attack , and received a briefing on upgrades being implemented to enhance the physical security of [ORG Consulate  ] facilities and personnel. ***************************************** Visit Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] 's Classified Website ; http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/rabat ***************************************** RILEY</pre></code>
