[PER Sarpong  ] complained about the lack of effective narcotics enforcement in neighboring countries , accused [ORG XXXXXXXXXX  ] of complicity in drug trafficking , and said that traffickers are using the airport [LOC VVIP  ] lounge to avoid searches . 
While President [PER Mills  ] has been outspoken in his determination to combat drug trafficking , [PER Sarpong  ] said that the [ORG NDC  ] government has failed so far to provide [ORG NACOB  ] with adequate resources , and stressed that low salaries make law enforcement personnel highly vulnerable to drug traffickers . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On October 5 , Pol Chief and Poloff met with the newly appointed Executive Secretary of [ORG NACOB  ] [PER Sarpong  ] . 
He was appointed to the government’s top anti-narcotics trafficking job in July 2009 and has moved quickly to establish his own imprimatur on the position . 
[PER Sarpong  ] stated that “I am a political man” outlining his time as former President [PER Jerry Rawlings’  ] youngest cabinet minister in the mid 1980s , but claimed emphatically that “there is no politics here” referring to [ORG NACOB  ] . 
He claimed to track all drug dealers regardless of their political affiliation yet simultaneously made disparaging categorical remarks about drug connections in the former [ORG New Patriotic Party  ] ( [ORG NPP  ] ) government , now the opposition party ( and the influence on politics of money derived from drug trafficking ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sarpong  ] stated unequivocally that [ORG XXXXXXXXXX  ] answered directly to [MISC Ghana’s  ] drug lords . 
He repeated the statement several times and said that he makes the accusation publicly whenever possible . 
However , while President [PER Mills  ] has struck the right rhetorical tone regarding his commitment to combating narcotics , [PER Sarpong  ] said that the [ORG Mills Administration  ] has so far failed to provide adequate resources to [ORG NACOB  ] . 
He underlined that the force is understaffed , underfunded , and underresourced . 
( COMMENT: [PER Sarpong  ] implied that police are open to corruption because of their personal financial situation . 
END COMMENT ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Executive Secretary noted that [LOC Ghana  ] , s difficulty in effectively preventing the inflow of drugs across its land borders highlights the regional nature of drug trafficking in [LOC West Africa  ] , as well as serious shortcomings in the police capabilities in [LOC Ghana  ] , s three neighbors . 
[PER Sarpong  ] said that if his office arranged for a controlled drop in [LOC Cote d’Ivoire  ] , the drugs would quickly wind up back in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
Drugs originating in [LOC Guinea  ] could travel through [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Burkina Faso  ] and enter [LOC Ghana  ] from the north “and no one would stop them.” [PER Sarpong  ] also questioned how “$700,000” mansions could be built in the poor region adjacent to the main [MISC Ghana-Togo  ] border crossing or how a single [MISC Nigerian  ] woman could buy large parcels of beach front property and no one questions the source of her funds. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the context of where to install a [ORG USG  ] funded body scanner at the airport , [PER Sarpong  ] outlined ways in which drugs are smuggled out of the [LOC Accra  ] airport . 
In addition to the individual “mules” who ingest small quantities of drugs or conceal the drugs in luggage or body cavities , airport workers have been arrested for passing drugs to travelers after they have completed security formalities . 
[PER Sarpong  ] also said that drugs are smuggled out of the airport through the “VVIP” ( Very Very Important Person ) lounge . 
[PER Sarpong  ] said that in the previous administration , [MISC Ghanaians  ] with a contact in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] could obtain a pass to the lounge from the [ORG State Protocol Office  ] that entitled the traveler to be driven from the lounge to the plane in a protocol vehicle without their person or luggage undergoing security screening . 
He commented that bank managers , pastors , and their wives were given service passports and access to the lounge and questioned why these middle class travelers were awarded privileges traditionally reserved for cabinet ministers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Before concluding the meeting , [PER Sarpong  ] asked the [ORG USG  ] for assistance in preventing [MISC Ghanaian  ] drug lords and their families from receiving visas to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Sarpong  ] claims that the drug barons can easily provide financial statements that help qualify them for travel visas but that once they get to the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Europe  ] , they legitimize their money by buying property or sending their children to expensive schools . 
He suggested that there should be greater scrutiny of those with substantial financial resources but without a clear source of that wealth , and said law enforcement would better be able to convict traffickers if their money stays in [LOC Ghana  ] where it can be traced. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Sarpong  ] appears determined to aggressively address [LOC Ghana  ] , s narcotics trafficking problem , and has clearly been emboldened by President [PER Mills  ] , public support for this effort . 
His experience in intelligence and the [ORG NDC  ] provides him the weight , and status to deal independently with the challenges facing [ORG NACOB  ] . 
Nevertheless , [PER Sarpong  ] , s comments indicate that corruption ( whether resulting from the low salaries paid to police personnel or the selling of [LOC VVIP  ] airport privileges ) remains a major obstacle to success . 
In addition , despite positive rhetoric it remains unclear whether the [ORG Mills Administration  ] will devote the resources that [PER Sarpong  ] feels are so far lacking .
