<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 MADRID 000133 SIPDIS FOR P - U/S BURNS , ALSO FOR EUR - A/S GORDON E.O. 12958 DECL: 02/04/2020 TAGS PREL , SP SUBJECT: [MISC SPANISH  ] REACTION TO ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING [MISC U.S.-EU  ] SUMMIT MADRID 00000133 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Alan D. Solomont  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
In the last 48 hours the Ambassador has spoken with [ORG Spanish National Security Advisor Leon  ] , [PER FM Moratinos  ] , and President [PER Zapatero  ] regarding the announcement that President [PER Obama  ] will not attend a [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] disappointment -- both among senior government officials and in the media -- is profound . 
Nevertheless , the [ORG GOS  ] is taking the high road , stressing the health of the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] and [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] relationships . 
We are taking a similar approach privately and publicly , aggressively reaching out to media to urge that they not read into this decision some hidden and inaccurate message about [LOC U.S.  ] policy . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] still hope for a Presidential visit , and will probably raise that with [LOC Washington  ] at every opportunity . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) It is important we all continue to reiterate a consistent message about what has and has not happened . 
There was never [LOC U.S.  ] agreement to a summit . 
The [ORG GOS  ] was told that on many occasions . 
The decision made this week has everything to do with the President’s very busy agenda and nothing to do with the importance the [LOC U.S.  ] attaches to [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has no more important relationship than the one its enjoys with [LOC Europe  ] , and [LOC Spain  ] is an important and valued ally . 
The President traveled to [LOC Europe  ] six times last year . 
He met twice with President [PER Zapatero  ] in recent months , will see him again at the [MISC National Prayer Breakfast  ] this week , and will receive King [PER Juan Carlos  ] at the [LOC White House  ] February 17 . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] press is covering the story heavily . 
Our message is being repeated in the media , although commentary is running heavily towards characterizing the decision as a slight to [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Spain.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] reaction is colored by the hopes they had pinned on this summit . 
The domestic economic news has been uniformly bad for [PER Zapatero  ] for a long time . 
That is not likely to change in the near future . 
[PER Zapatero  ] looked to the [ORG EU  ] presidency as a chance to burnish [LOC Spain’s  ] international standing , especially as a leader within the [ORG EU  ] . 
The summit with the [LOC U.S.  ] -- the first visit of a [LOC U.S.  ] President in eight years -- was to be the climax of [LOC Spain’s  ] presidency . 
Early on [LOC Spain  ] proposed late May as the date and began working to convince [LOC U.S.  ] officials of the value of a summit . 
Regrettably , and despite being told repeatedly that no dates were agreed , the [ORG GOS  ] treated the summit as a fait accompli when talking to the media. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] did take seriously [LOC U.S.  ] injunctions that a summit needed concrete and worthwhile deliverables and began working on an agenda that would be meaningful to the [LOC U.S.  ] In discussions with the [ORG Department of State  ] and the [ORG NSC  ] , the [MISC Spanish  ] stressed some worthwhile topics such as data protection/information sharing , removing trade and regulatory barriers , climate change , and -- most recently as described to the Ambassador -- having [PER Zapatero  ] personally lead an effort to persuade other [ORG EU  ] countries to accept more Guantanamo detainees . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] did appear to have taken seriously their role as a transitional [ORG EU  ] presidency , trying to find a balance with [ORG EU  ] President [PER Van Rompuy  ] and High Representative [PER Ashton  ] , dividing up meetings , and agreeing on appropriate roles for both [PER Van Rompuy  ] and [PER Zapatero  ] in a proposed [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] in [LOC Spain.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) By the time the new [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador arrived January 9 , the [ORG GOS  ] was clearly becoming nervous about the summit . 
In his first days , senior [ORG GOS  ] officials raised the issue with the Ambassador , including [PER Moratinos  ] , [PER Leon  ] , [PER Zapatero  ] , and the King . 
In each instance , the Ambassador made clear that the [ORG USG  ] had not yet agreed to a summit . 
His [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors made it equally clear that they placed great importance on having a summit. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At this point , the [MISC Spanish  ] do not feel betrayed , but they are deeply disappointed . 
Naturally they regret , as does everyone , that the bad news first appeared in the press . 
Despite that , the [ORG GOS  ] is trying to put the best face on this situation . 
The Ambassador has explained personally to [PER Leon  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] and [PER Zapatero  ] that [LOC Spain  ] remains an important and valued ally . 
In a February 2 conversation , [PER Zapatero  ] told the Ambassador he understands President [PER Obama  ] has a complicated agenda and that he traveled several times to [LOC Europe  ] in the past year . 
[PER Zapatero  ] assured the Ambassador he understands the decision has nothing to do with [LOC U.S.  ] feelings towards [LOC Spain  ] or [LOC Europe  ] . 
He said he hopes President [PER Obama  ] will find a convenient moment to visit [LOC Spain  ] and suggested he would tell the President that when he sees him at the [MISC National Prayer Breakfast  ] . 
MADRID 00000133 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Zapatero  ] has taken a serious political blow at a time when he can ill afford it . 
Nevertheless , bilateral relations will survive intact . 
We expect [LOC Spain  ] to follow through on its commitments to send more troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , accept five Guantanamo detainees , and be helpful on [LOC Iran  ] sanctions . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] are still hopeful for a Presidential visit this year , perhaps in conjunction with the President’s visit to [LOC Lisbon  ] in November . 
In that regard , we have advised the [MISC Spanish  ] not to create false expectations . 
We do believe such a visit would be useful in terms of strengthening relations with an important ally who has demonstrated an increasing willingness to support [LOC U.S.  ] priorities . 
The use of [MISC Spanish  ] military bases by our Navy and [ORG Air Force  ] has long been of great value to us as is [LOC Spain’s  ] commitment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and its cooperation on [LOC CT  ] , law enforcement , etc . 
Although [MISC Spanish  ] leaders may voice their desire for a visit to senior [ORG USG  ] officials , they should avoid making the same mistake twice of speaking publicly about a visit that has not been committed to . 
End comment .
