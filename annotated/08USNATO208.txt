END SUMMARY. ------------------------ [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] AND [LOC PAKISTAN  ] ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Under Secretary of Defense for [ORG Policy Eric Edelman  ] told [ORG NATO  ] PermReps on June 5 that , after his recent visit to [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] , he believes [LOC Afghanistan  ] will require a long-term approach that focuses efforts on improving local governance and security . 
Among his findings: - ( C ) [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) are far along in their plans to assume leadership for security in [LOC Kabul  ] city this summer . 
[ORG ANSF  ] are already providing " 95 percent " of [LOC Kabul  ] 's security. - ( C ) In the next few months , the [ORG U.S.-led Combined Security Transition Command- Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG CSTC-A  ] ) will be short more than 100 district-level 12-person Police Mentoring Teams ( PMTs ) . 
[MISC European  ] countries are well-suited for the high-end training of police , and [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Italy  ] have already expressed interest . 
Focused [ORG District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) , [ORG CSTC-A  ] 's police training program , gets the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) to about " the 80 percent level " , but PMTs are needed to mentor them and finish their training . 
[PER Edelman  ] reported that on his visit to [LOC Kapisa  ] province ( in [LOC RC-East  ] , where [MISC French  ] forces will soon deploy ) the difference was clear between towns where the [ORG ANP  ] was trained and operating effectively versus areas where they were not and as a result the [ORG Taliban  ] was active. - ( C ) Local governance is key to success . 
[ORG USDP Edelman  ] encouraged Allies to support the [ORG GoA  ] 's [ORG Independent Directorate  ] for Local Governance ( [ORG IDLG  ] ) . 
The estimated cost to implement the overall [ORG IDLG  ] strategy over a five-year period is USD 296 million , of which USD 26 million is for [ORG IDLG  ] 's recently unveiled [MISC Afghan  ] Social [ORG Outreach Program  ] ( [ORG ASOP  ] ) that focuses on developing local governance in eleven troubled provinces. - ( C ) UN SRSG [PER Kai Eide  ] needs support , especially in [LOC New York  ] where Allies should help ensure he gets the financial and staffing resources he requests. - ( C ) The enemy is adaptive . 
Officials in [ORG Regional Command East  ] and [ORG Regional Command Capital  ] have seen an uptick in insurgent attacks in [LOC Khost  ] , [LOC Nangarhar  ] , [LOC Kabul  ] , and other areas where [ORG ISAF  ] has been successful with its development projects . 
The enemy realizes it must destroy what has been built or risk losing the support of the people . 
[ORG USNATO  ] 00000208 002 OF 004 - ( C ) The [MISC Pakistani  ] leadership , including the President , Prime Minister , Defense Minister and new [ORG National Security Advisor  ] all say they are committed to fighting terrorism . 
[PER Edelman  ] raised with them [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the peace agreements in the tribal areas , noting that [ORG ISAF  ] already sees an increase in incidents in eastern [LOC Afghanistan  ] attributable to reduced pressure on militants in [LOC Pakistan.  ] - ( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] has two fundamental problems: the insurgency in the [ORG Federal Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) , which the political class underestimates because it remains focused on political machinations in [LOC Islamabad  ] ; and the grave economic crisis , characterized by low growth and balance of payments problems , which are exacerbated by political instability . 
[PER Edelman  ] urged Allies to weigh in with [LOC Islamabad  ] on the need for a strong counterinsurgency effort , to visit [LOC Pakistan  ] at the senior level , and to consider economic development programs in the tribal areas. ----------------- [MISC PermRep  ] Questions ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Greek  ] ambassador , [PER USDP Edelman  ] commented that he is not overly concerned about the possibility that [PER Karzai  ] might seek to manipulate local governance and development programs for his electoral ends , because his political base and the root of the insurgency overlap in the [MISC Pashtun  ] areas. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In response to the [LOC UK  ] ambassador , [PER Edelman  ] noted that [MISC Pakistani  ] CHOD [PER Kayani  ] has told senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials that he wants the [MISC Pakistani  ] military out of politics , but he noted that the army needs retraining and reequipping to confront domestic extremists with a counterinsurgency strategy , since it is currently oriented towards the [MISC Indian  ] threat . 
In [LOC Kabul  ] , [PER Edelman  ] added , he found [PER Karzai  ] eager to divert attention to [LOC Pakistan  ] as a source of all of [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's problems. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Czech  ] ambassador , [PER USDP Edelman  ] commented that the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to reinvigorate the [ORG Tripartite Commission  ] and has a very active mil-to-mil relationship with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Admiral [PER Mullen  ] and other senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials make frequent visits to [MISC Islamabad.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC French  ] ambassador , [PER Edelman  ] said that neither [ORG ISAF  ] nor the [MISC Afghan  ] government has been successful on counternarcotics , and that eradication programs focus mostly on small farmers , making some Allies uneasy . 
[PER Edelman  ] urged greater focus on drug labs and high-value targets , such as drug traffickers who are also insurgents . 
He pointed out that [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Marines  ] in [LOC Garmsir District  ] of [ORG Helmand Province  ] discovered a [ORG Taliban  ] poppy " agro-business " had sprung up in the absence of a [MISC GoA/ISAF  ] presence . 
The [LOC UK  ] ambassador added that going after traffickers and high-value targets has not had a negative effect on local opinion , in the [LOC UK  ] 's experience . 
Ambassador [LOC Nuland  ] commented that doing nothing about narcotics also damages [ORG ISAF  ] 's image with [MISC Afghans  ] and noted " neutrality is not an option " when dealing with traffickers. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Italian  ] ambassador , [PER Edelman  ] commented that our efforts to strengthen local governance do not undermine the [MISC Afghan  ] central government because there has never been a tradition of strong central government . 
The [ORG USNATO  ] 00000208 003 OF 004 best approach is to improve local governance and then link it to the central government in [LOC Kabul.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Norwegian  ] ambassador , [PER Edelman  ] expressed optimism regarding the transition to the [ORG ANSF  ] of security in [LOC Kabul  ] , noting that the [ORG ANSF  ] have shown improvement . 
Regarding Provincial Reconstruction Teams ( PRTs ) , [PER Edelman  ] similarly urged a phased transition to allow the [MISC Afghans  ] to assume more and more responsibilities . 
Transition will occur at different paces in different places and should not be viewed as [ORG ISAF  ] 's exit strategy. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Polish  ] ambassador , [PER Edelman  ] said that [PER Karzai  ] sees two fronts ( [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] ) to his dilemmas . 
[PER Edelman  ] noted that when the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Marines  ] went into [LOC Garmsir District  ] recently , they learned a lot of new information about insurgent and narcotics activities , and he is concerned that a similar " blind spot " may exist in [LOC Nimruz  ] along the border with [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Canadian  ] representative , [PER Edelman  ] said that the notion of a unified approach to the [MISC Pashtun  ] problems in both [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] was something [LOC U.S.  ] policy makers had considered , but it would be difficult to implement on both sides of the border. ------- [LOC LEBANON  ] ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In response to the [MISC Greek  ] ambassador , [PER USDP Edelman  ] said this was his third visit to [LOC Beirut  ] in six months and he said he was " more optimistic than expected . 
" President [PER Suleiman  ] is now more self-assured than he had been as CHOD and gave an impressive inaugural speech . 
Still to play out is the question of whether [ORG Hezbollah  ] over-reached and damaged itself by taking up arms against [MISC Lebanese  ] in the recent crisis . 
He added that he is skeptical that the recent [MISC Syrian/Israeli  ] dialogue will be successful given the nature of the [LOC Damascus  ] regime . 
[PER Edelman  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] is developing a good mil-to-mil bilateral relationship with [LOC Lebanon.  ] ----------------------- [PER SecGen  ] de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) In his conversation with [ORG NATO  ] SYG [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] , [PER USDP Edelman  ] said that he had raised with [PER Karzai  ] the latter 's unhelpful comments in [PER Der Spiegel  ] ( " I wish I Had the [ORG Taliban  ] as My Soldiers " ) , and that [PER Karzai  ] apologized and claimed he was misquoted . 
[PER SecGen  ] commented on a similar interview with the [MISC Indian  ] press saying that such coverage could lead parliaments in troop contributing nations to question the value of sending their troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER SecGen  ] wondered aloud which [PER Karzai  ] would show up for the [MISC Afghan  ] Donors , Conference in [MISC Paris--  ] the erratic [MISC Pashtun  ] politician or the rational national leader . 
[PER Edelman  ] observed that [PER Karzai  ] seemed preoccupied with blaming [LOC Pakistan  ] for [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's problems . 
[PER SecGen  ] responded that this does not bode well for efforts to reinvigorate the [ORG Tripartite Commission.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [PER SecGen  ] reported that attempts to update the [ORG Kosovo Operations Plan  ] had run aground due to [MISC Turkish  ] " paranoia " . 
The [LOC Turks  ] have prevented PermReps from [ORG USNATO  ] 00000208 004 OF 004 discussing the updated plan because of concerns about their relationship with the [ORG European Union  ] . 
[PER SecGen  ] asked for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in convincing the [LOC Turks  ] to be more flexible. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [PER SecGen  ] indicated that he disagreed with the [LOC U.S.  ] response to [MISC Turkish  ] complaints about the possible involvement of [MISC Greek  ] aircraft from a disputed island in the [ORG Aegean  ] in [ORG NATO  ] exercises . 
He is concerned that this could lead toward a situation in which [ORG NATO  ] could never exercise in the [LOC Aegean.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) USDP [PER Edelman  ] has cleared this cable .
