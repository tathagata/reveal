( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [LOC U.K.  ] government’s agreement to pump [MISC GBP  ] 37 billion into three of [MISC Britain’s  ] largest banks , along with similarly dramatic moves undertaken in the [LOC U.S.  ] and in the rest of [LOC Europe  ] , buoyed , at least temporarily , London’s stock markets , with minor gains posted in the first two days of this week . 
PM [PER Gordon Brown’s  ] stock has also risen in recent days , with the President of the [ORG European Commission  ] [PER Jose Manuel Barroso  ] publicly calling the nearly [MISC Europe-wide  ] , multi-billion dollar bank bail-out plan as “the [PER Brown Plan  ] , ” and pundits across the political spectrum at home hailing the PM as “the man who saved the financial system.” Most in [LOC London  ] are waiting to see if the recovery in stock market prices will be sustained throughout the week ( the [MISC FTSE  ] is down 4 percent in trading on October 15th ) before even considering whether the “worst is over.” Bleak economic news continues to trickle in: [LOC U.K.  ] inflation reached 5.2 percent in September , up .5 percent from August figures , with the annual rate of inflation of energy and other household utility bills reaching 15 percent - the highest since 1989 . 
End Summary . 
Pumping Up The Volume --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following a weekend of talks with [MISC Britain’s  ] largest banks , [ORG HMG  ] agreed to inject [MISC GBP  ] 37 billion into three banks: [ORG Royal Bank of Scotland  ] ( [ORG RBS  ] ) , [ORG Lloyds TSB  ] and [ORG HBOS  ] . 
The government will own a majority stake , up to 70 percent in [ORG RBS  ] , and more than 40 percent in [ORG Lloyds  ] and [ORG HBOS  ] . 
The three banks have shelved their dividend payments on ordinary shares until they fully repay the [MISC GBP  ] 9 billion in preference shares issued by the government . 
The banks will face restrictions on executive pay and have agreed to pay their 2008 executive bonuses in shares . 
( Comment: The restrictions on executive pay have been particularly welcomed by [MISC British  ] unions , which have long-called for bonuses to be curbed . 
End Comment . 
) The government and the banks are in discussions about how many board seats the government will have and about other managerial decision-making . 
In contrast , [ORG Barclays  ] has rejected the government’s recapitalization plan for the bank , saying it would , instead , raise [MISC GBP  ] 7 billion and cancel its quarterly dividend to raise [MISC GBP  ] 2 billion . 
The [ORG Bank also  ] plans to raise more than [MISC GBP  ] 6 billion in preference and common shares . 
On October 8 , [ORG HMG  ] had indicated that it stood ready to partially nationalize seven [LOC UK  ] banks , including [ORG Barclays  ] , by investing [MISC GBP  ] 50 billion in preference shares , ordinary shares , or permanent interest-bearing shares . 
Waiting to Exhale ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although stock prices have made some gains , and inter-bank lending has started - though just a trickle in volume - industry leaders believe it would be premature to call the crisis over . 
[LOC Gary  ] vonLemden , Corporate Head , [LOC Europe  ] , Citigoup ( Please protect ) , told econoff that the rescue plan will not directly move to re-open the bond and commercial paper markets , and until they re-open , banks will be remain under pressure . 
There has not been a single corporate bond issue since August , he stated. “The government’s scheme protects the taxpayer and is likely to make money . 
It will also make finance easier to obtain that it would otherwise have been . 
Whether that gets immediately in market prices , whether on inter-bank or retail lending , is harder to judge , ” observed [PER Ben Broadbent  ] , chief economist , [ORG Goldman Sachs  ] . 
Even the Chairman of the [ORG Treasury Select Committee  ] , [PER John McFall  ] , has expressed concerns that the [MISC GBP  ] 37 billion being injected into three of [MISC Britain’s  ] largest banks , might not be enough. “It is a minefield we are tiptoeing through , ” he stated , and called on banks to provide greater detail of their exposure to derivatives and other complex assets. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Others are concerned about the macro-economic situation . 
Inflation has jumped to 5.2 percent in September , above the [ORG BOE  ] expected 5 percent rate and significantly above the two percent target rate . 
Surging household utility and food prices were the key factors behind this jump . 
The declining price in oil is expected to bring inflation down below the five percent mark in October , but inflation will remain a significant concern . 
In September , unemployment recorded its biggest rise in 17 years , jumping by 164,000 [LOC LONDON  ] 00002603 002 OF 003 workers to 1.79 million , the largest rise since 1991 . 
The weakening global economy is also affecting the [MISC UK’s  ] trade deficit . 
Although it narrowed slightly in August to [MISC GBP  ] 4.7 billion from [MISC GBP  ] 4.8 billion , the gap was [MISC GBP  ] one billion higher than analysts had expected . 
The effects on the real economy have also to become evident: car sales were down 21 percent in September alone and house repossessions are set to rise by 50 percent to 45,000 this year . 
A New [PER Dawn For Brown  ] -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After a year of plummeting poll numbers and questions about his ability to lead , [PER Gordon Brown  ] is suddenly riding high . 
On October 13 , the same day that he was awarded the [ORG Nobel Prize for Economics  ] , [PER Paul Krugman  ] published a [ORG New York Times  ] op-ed entitled , “Gordon Does Good , ” praising the PM and his team for his quick actions to stave off a further collapse of the financial industry and to lay down the foundation for a new global financial system . 
Brown’s plan to recapitalize banks , first announced on October 9 , and then fine-tuned over the weekend was heralded by [PER Krugman  ] and many others as the missing element in all previous rescue plans - and a step subsequently adopted in several other countries . 
[PER Brown  ] has also received praise for riding to the rescue of the [ORG European Union  ] . 
President of the [ORG European Commission  ] [PER Barroso  ] told the media October 14: “We needed a global solution for a global problem and we ended up with what I will call the ‘Brown plan’...The [LOC UK  ] was amongst the first to propose comprehensive plans for working together in [LOC Europe.”  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Brown  ] and [ORG Labour  ] are up in the polls: a [ORG YouGov/Sunday Times  ] , poll released on October 13 showed [ORG Labour  ] popularity at 33 percent , up 3 points , and the [ORG Conservative Party  ] at 43 percent , down three points . 
[PER Brown  ] and his economic team were also judged as better able to handle the crisis than their [MISC Tory  ] counterparts . 
Even [MISC Tory  ] political leaders are ruefully acknowledging Brown’s achievements . 
At an [MISC Ambassador-hosted  ] breakfast for [ORG NY Times  ] journalist [PER Tom Friedman  ] on October 14 , [PER Gregory Barker  ] , MP , Shadow Minister for the Environment , stated that if [PER Brown  ] were to successfully stabilize the economy , he would not be surprised if the PM called for early elections , to try to capitalize on his helmsmanship of the economic recovery . 
This sentiment was echoed by [ORG Labour  ] MP [PER Jamie Reed  ] , who told emboff privately that the government could call elections as early as spring of 2009 , and would unlikely wait until the term ends in 2010 . 
He did give a caveat , stating that election planning remained in flux , and noting that discussions on timing were ongoing . 
Consensus For Now - But The [MISC Gauntlet Is Laid Down  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC Tories  ] have expressed support for the bail-out package , acknowledging that there was no other option when faced with the collapse of the banking system. “Now was the time for all political leaders to be bi-partisan , ” stated [PER Barker  ] , and “the [MISC Tories  ] have told the PM he has their support for the financial measures recently announced.” However , when the dust settles , he argued , it will be time to take a hard look at how “we got to this position , how do we get through the crisis stronger and better , and what can we achieve realistically in the longer-run ? ” The [ORG Labour Party  ] is particularly vulnerable on the first part of that question , he contended , and pointed to improper regulatory oversight among the many perceived failings of the [ORG Labour  ] government . 
He added that the challenge for everyone , now and in the immediate future , is to determine the right strategy for getting through the crisis and then to tackle the real problems brought on , or aggravated by , the crisis: a greater debt burden , collapsed housing prices , higher inflation , greater personal bankruptcies . 
This “is no moment of triumph for the government - for it is the [MISC British  ] people who have now been landed with the bill for the boom that turned to bust , ” recently remarked [PER George Osborne  ] , Shadow Chancellor . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Reaction in [LOC London  ] to the [LOC U.K.  ] economic rescue plan has been more muted than expected , with the stock market down nearly 3 percent in trading the morning of October 15th . 
Skepticism remains whether the measures adopted will be [LOC LONDON  ] 00002603 003 OF 003 sufficient to unlock paralyzed inter-bank lending and to start restoring credit in the faltering financial system . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] government and investors are also watching closely the [LOC U.S.  ] response to the crisis and the effect of the [LOC U.S.  ] plan on both [LOC Wall Street  ] and [LOC Main Street  ] . 
[LOC U.K.  ] officials have little room to maneuver should the rescue plan prove to be inadequate , since they have adopted measures that were to be called upon only in extremis . 
A worsening of the crisis would be bad news for the PM , who is enjoying a brief respite from the bashing he has received regularly in the press . 
While Labour’s poll numbers are slightly up , the [MISC Tories  ] would still win a majority if the elections were held today .
