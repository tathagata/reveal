Sobel  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] are involved in an open and growing collaboration with a common purpose to make more arms available to radical populist governments and spread anti-American ideology in the region , according to the chairman of the [ORG Senate  ] Foreign Relations and [ORG National Defense  ] committee . 
He is " truly concerned " and urges the [ORG USG  ] to be more engaged " before it is too late . 
" The chairman said presidential foreign policy adviser [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] strongly recommended [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] surmised that Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] was less receptive to the visit . 
[PER Fortes  ] noted that with the increasing wealth of oil-producing states , there are some that will support [MISC Russian  ] arms purchases , and in conversation , the Deputy Minister alluded that perhaps [LOC Ecuador  ] and even [LOC Brazil  ] could become beneficiaries . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a November 5 phone call , Senator [PER Heraclito Fortes  ] ( [ORG Democrats Party  ] , opposition ; of [LOC Piaui  ] ) asked the Ambassador to meet with him urgently to raise a matter he could not discuss on the telephone . 
In a meeting that afternoon , which continued the next morning , [PER Fortes  ] told the Ambassador , poloff , and assistant army attache that he is " truly concerned " about [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] activities in the region , including financing " friendship organizations " between congresses and even potentially financing arms sales . 
He described a recent meeting with the [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Minister for Petroleum and former Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] who sought " cooperation " with [LOC Brazil  ] , the nature of which " depends on [LOC Brazil  ] . 
" ( Note: This is Dr. [PER Mansour Moazami  ] , [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] from 2000 until about 2003 . 
End note . 
) He spoke of [LOC Iran  ] 's growing relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] and even indicated that the recent trip of President [PER Putin  ] to [LOC Iran  ] was extremely successful and dealt with many of the difficult issues that had to be resolved . 
In mentioning arms sales , Chairman [PER Fortes  ] again underscored [LOC Iran  ] 's interest in helping [LOC Brazil  ] , depending on [LOC Brazil  ] own interest . 
The Deputy Minister told [PER Fortes  ] that [LOC Iran  ] already has agreements with [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] , but it was not made clear to [PER Fortes  ] whether these were arms agreements . 
Connecting the Dots ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Fortes  ] sees a sequence of dots showing more [MISC Venezuelan  ] influence and interference in the region , [MISC Iranian  ] support for [LOC Caracas  ] , [LOC La Paz  ] , and [LOC Quito  ] , and the specter of [MISC Russian  ] arms in the region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Fortes  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Minister described President [PER Vladimir Putin  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Iran  ] as very good , resolving many differences between them ; the [MISC Iranian  ] mentioned [MISC Russian  ] arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [MISC Russian  ] relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] , as well as [MISC Venezuelan  ] support for [MISC Bolivian  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] , praised [LOC Venezuela  ] , and mentioned [LOC Venezuela  ] 's recent acquisition of 26 warplanes , claiming they are to maintain peace . 
The Deputy Minister , a former ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] and one who knows [LOC Brazil  ] , told [PER Fortes  ] it is up to [LOC Brazil  ] to determine how it wanted to work with [LOC Iran  ] , and through thinly veiled references asked the chairman of the Foreign Relations and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] if he was interested in reviving the [ORG Friendship Group  ] that previously had as its leader a former senator of , as [PER Fortes  ] implied , questionable character . 
[PER Fortes  ] said he had never been approached that way in his career . 
He said the moribund group will likely be revived in the [ORG Senate  ] without his support . 
[PER Fortes  ] said he believed there was pressure from unknown quarters within [LOC Brazil  ] to purchase [MISC Russian  ] arms , adding that the [ORG Air Force Commander  ] , General [PER Juniti Saito  ] , told him if he ( [PER Saito  ] ) were pushed to buy [MISC Russian  ] weapons he [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002132 002.3 OF 003 would have no option , and [PER Fortes  ] thought it would be a huge mistake. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Fortes  ] continued pointing out worrisome signs: leftist [MISC Venezuelan  ] , [MISC Bolivian  ] , and [MISC Peruvian  ] deputies who are trying to reactivate the [MISC Caracas-based Amazonian Parliament  ] ( [PER Parlamaz  ] ) were visiting [LOC Brasilia  ] Nov 5-8 to lobby the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] , and there are now " [MISC Bolivarian  ] circles " in [LOC Brazil  ] that media have reported as being under [MISC Venezuelan  ] tutelage . 
Official [MISC Venezuelan  ] diplomacy is increasingly commercial , with huge contracts for firms such as [MISC Brazilian  ] construction giant [ORG Odebrecht  ] , who then lobby for [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Fortes  ] noted . 
The expanded availability of the type of arms in [LOC Venezuela  ] that could be used for populist causes in [LOC Brazil  ] was also of concern to the senator . 
[PER Fortes  ] said it may not be coincidental that [MISC Russian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Sergey Kislyak  ] arrived in [LOC Brasilia  ] the same day as [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Petroluem Minister and he speculated there may have been a three-way meeting with [MISC Brazilians  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] , and the [MISC Iranian.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [MISC Iranian  ] outreach plans in the region include another [PER Ahmadinejad  ] trip including [LOC Brazil  ] , probably for the next inauguration of a [MISC Latin American  ] president , making the trip a springboard for [MISC Iranian  ] regional diplomacy , [PER Fortes  ] said . 
( Note: [PER Ahmadinejad  ] canceled a scheduled visit here last September on short notice . 
) Presidential foreign policy adviser [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] supported the [MISC Iranian  ] president 's visit , which may not have been supported by Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] , [PER Fortes  ] said , and the [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Minister , who was in the traveling delegation to [LOC Caracas  ] and [LOC La Paz  ] , said he tried everything up to the last minute to get it reinstated . 
[PER Fortes  ] added that the Deputy Minister was very disappointed at the cancellation , especially since an [MISC Iranian  ] advance team was already on the ground in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
The senator indicated that he thought that despite [PER Garcia  ] 's strong support for the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit , [PER Celso Amorim  ] may have intereceded due to the sensitivities . 
Sensitive reporting indicates , though that the reasons were other . 
" You Are Children " ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Fortes  ] strongly urged the [ORG USG  ] to engage much more " before it is too late . 
" The [ORG USG  ] is " indifferent " to what is happening in the region and he urged the [ORG USG  ] to take notice of [MISC Venezuelan  ] , [MISC Russian  ] , and [MISC Iranian  ] plans in the region , saying , " You are children: you ignore a problem until it is well along and then it is too late . 
" He suggested the [ORG USG  ] adopt a plan for regional integration and promote arms manufacturing partnerships with [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] to arm the region , and said it could be done indirectly through arms firms without publicly linking the [ORG USG  ] to the increased arms sales. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Comment . 
[MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] influence in [LOC Brazil  ] and the region is certainly growing and mutually reinforcing , and Chairman [PER Fortes  ] is correct that there are differing views on how to engage [LOC Iran  ] , but clearly [LOC Brazil  ] will be increasingly sensitive to [MISC Iranian  ] interests . 
It is also interesting to recall President [PER Lula  ] 's remarks on the margins of the last [ORG UN General Assembly  ] when he said [LOC Iran  ] was not in violation of any [ORG UN  ] guidelines with its nuclear program , as well as [LOC Brazil  ] 's abstention on November 7 in the [ORG Interpol  ] vote to issue international capture notices for [MISC Iranian  ] officials accused in the [ORG AMIA  ] bombing ( reftel ) . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] 's concerns parallel recent views we have heard reporting on increasing [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns over [MISC Venezuelan  ] arms purchases , the lack of a modernized [MISC Brazilian  ] defense capability , and increasing engagement of [MISC Venezuelan  ] diplomats in [LOC Brazil  ] funding [ORG Bolivarian Circles  ] and populist organizations . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] is not alone in his feeling , especially given the recent remarks of former president and [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002132 003.2 OF 003 sitting senator [PER Jose Sarney  ] , a leader of the [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  ] .
