MEETINGS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 21 , the [ORG Advisor  ] and the EconChief met with [PER Lin  ] , [LOC Sheng-Chung  ] , Vice Minister of the [ORG Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] ( [ORG MOEA  ] ) . 
The meeting was to provide first-hand knowledge of [LOC EXBS  ] work in [LOC Taiwan  ] and to elevate export control discussions above the working level . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Vice Minister [PER Lin  ] thanked [LOC EXBS  ] for the training programs conducted since 2007 . 
He stated that he understands that the training portion of [LOC EXBS  ] will end in a couple of years . 
He also stated that it is unclear , at this point , how export control work will be managed by [ORG MOEA  ] once the ministerial reorganization takes affect after 2010 . 
The [ORG Advisor  ] stated that , since [ORG MOEA  ] will be reorganized next year , this would be an opportune time to elevate the work of export controls within [ORG MOEA  ] so that it is commensurate with countries that are at similar level of development as [LOC Taiwan  ] ; that , currently , [LOC Taiwan  ] lags far behind places likes [LOC Hong Kong  ] , [LOC Singapore  ] , and [LOC South Korea  ] , in the way export controls is managed . 
He responded that he would look into the issue . 
However , a meeting with the [ORG National Security Council  ] would be helpful if the goal is to elevate the work within [ORG MOEA  ] . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER VM Lin  ] also expressed certain views with regard to the on-going [MISC US-Taiwan  ] bilateral cooperation . 
These views will be sent via email to appropriate offices in [LOC DC.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 24 , the [ORG Advisor  ] met with Professor [PER Liu  ] , [ORG Fu-Kuo of Institute of International Relations  ] , [ORG National Chengchi University  ] , to get a read-out on the [ORG WMD Study Group  ] meeting of the [ORG Council on Security Cooperation  ] in the [ORG Asia Pacific  ] ( [ORG CSCAP  ] ) that took place in [LOC Beijing  ] on June 28 - 30 . 
He said [LOC Taiwan  ] and [LOC China  ] are finalizing their cooperation on translating a [ORG WMD  ] manual into [MISC Chinese  ] so that [LOC Taiwan  ] and [LOC China  ] can use one manual . 
( [ORG Note: Taiwan  ] uses traditional [MISC Chinese  ] script and [LOC China  ] uses simplified [MISC Chinese  ] script . 
) He said even though [LOC Taiwan  ] has participated since the founding of [ORG CSCAP  ] , it has done so as a guest of [ORG USCSCAP  ] . 
He expressed his appreciation for the work of [ORG USCSCAP  ] to make [LOC Taiwan  ] 's participation in this NGO group possible . 
He hopes that [LOC Taiwan  ] can be a full [ORG CSCAP  ] member in the future .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) On July 27 , the [ORG Advisor  ] met with the [PER Chang  ] , [PER Chih-Yu  ] ( [PER James  ] ) , Director of the [ORG Office of Homeland Security  ] , [ORG Executive Yuan  ] . 
Director [PER Chang  ] transferred in March from the [ORG Department of Information and Liaison  ] of the [ORG Mainland Affairs Council  ] . 
While Mr. [PER Chang  ] does not have an export control background , he has consulted [ORG BOFT  ] and has visited [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] and [ORG Megaports  ] operations in [LOC Kaohsiung  ] to get a better understanding of [MISC US-Taiwan  ] cooperation in the nonproliferation area . 
He stated that [LOC Taiwan  ] 's biggest concern is industry compliance ; [LOC Taiwan  ] companies endlessly complain about compliance with export controls and how any measure to strengthen it will affect their bottom line . 
The [ORG Advisor  ] responded that industry complaint about export controls is not unique to [LOC Taiwan  ] ; that all companies , everywhere complain about export controls . 
Regardless , export controls is an international security issue that all of us must be vigilant in strengthening so that no place provides an avenue for proliferation of [ORG WMD  ] . 
She also reiterated that officials should explain to industry what the rules are , and how companies can comply with the rules , but in the end , officials are responsible for national security and foreign policy , not the private sector . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director [PER Chang  ] stated that export controls is not [LOC Taiwan  ] 's top priority . 
Additionally , few high-level officials truly understand what export controls is and how the management of it affects [LOC Taiwan  ] 's international standing . 
Currently , [LOC Taiwan  ] simply follows the footsteps of the [LOC US  ] . 
Furthermore , the main concern for [LOC Taiwan  ] is controlling commodities exported to [LOC China  ] . 
( [ORG Note: Taiwan  ] has stricter rules on exports of certain commodities to [LOC China  ] than the [LOC US  ] . 
) For goods shipped to other countries , such as [LOC Iran  ] or [LOC North Korea  ] , export controls is less of a concern for [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director [PER Chang  ] agreed with the advice and comments from the [ORG Advisor  ] regarding certain deficiencies in [LOC Taiwan  ] 's export control system and ways to remedy them . 
He stated he would explore whether his office can host regular interagency meetings on export controls so that the issues such as elevating export control discussion to a higher level ; additional personnel commitment ; interagency coordination and license review ; and increase in penalty for violations , stay in the forefront of [LOC Taiwan  ] authorities' discussions . 
( [ORG Note: An  ] interagency export control committee exists within [ORG BOFT  ] but that committee has not met for over a year . 
When repeatedly asked why [ORG BOFT  ] does not call an interagency committee meeting , the response has been [ORG BOFT  ] does not have the personnel to work on it . 
) ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director [PER Chang  ] agreed that export control issues need to be elevated to a higher level and stated that he would bring up the issue during his weekly meeting with [LOC Taiwan  ] 's Premier . 
He also stated that he has regular contact with officials of [ORG Taiwan National Security Council  ] so he would use those opportunities to get the message across . 
( [ORG Note: AIT ADIR  ] raised export control issues with the [ORG National Security Council  ] Secretary General [PER Su Chi  ] during a meeting the week of August 10 . 
He proposed assigning this portfolio to a senior [ORG NSC  ] official , raising the level of the office within [ORG BOFT  ] in charge of this portfolio , and creating an NGO to provide information and research on non-proliferation issues to [LOC Taiwan  ] authorities . 
Secretary General [PER Su Chi  ] agreed that [LOC Taiwan  ] needs to increase priority and instructed his deputy to coordinate these efforts . 
) ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director [PER Chang  ] stated , initially , his office would see if a task force can be formed to work on the following suggested areas: ( 1 ) fix the technology controls discrepancy in export control regulations ; ( 2 ) pass legislation to increase penalty for violations ; ( 3 ) allocate additional resource , including creating an NGO , for nonproliferation work ; and ( 4 ) establish a policy-making and coordinating body within [LOC Taiwan  ] authorities for export controls . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Director [PER Chang  ] and the [ORG Advisor  ] agreed to meet regularly ( once every one or two months ) to check on the progress of the task force. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B .
