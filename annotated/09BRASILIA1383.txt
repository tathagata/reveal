The newly heightened concerns about [LOC Brazil  ] 's infrastructure as a result of this blackout , combined with the need to address infrastructure challenges in the run-up to the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] , present the [LOC United States  ] opportunities for engagement on infrastructure development as well critical infrastructure protection and possibly cyber security . 
Mission encourages USG agencies , including DOD , DHS , [ORG FCC  ] , [ORG TDA  ] and others , to explore these opportunities in the near-term . 
END SUMMARY THE EVENT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On November 10 at 22:13 , [LOC Brazil  ] experienced a blackout that plunged 18 of [LOC Brazil  ] 's 27 states into darkness for periods ranging from 20 minutes to 6 hours . 
The blackout represented a loss of 28,000 megawatts - or 45 percent of total [MISC Brazilian  ] consumption at that instant - of electricity and left an estimated 87 million residents without power . 
Scrutiny has been intense and speculation rife over the cause of the incident , in large part due to the recent announcement of Rio as the host of the 2016 summer [MISC Olympics  ] . 
WHAT HAS THE GOVERNMENT DETERMINED SO FAR ? <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On November 18 , [PER Econoff  ] met with [PER Plinio de Oliveira  ] , the President of [ORG ONS  ] , the governmental agency responsible for the nation 's interlinked electricity grid , along with [PER Wilkens Geraldes Filho  ] , [ORG ONS  ] 's Director of [ORG Statistical Analysis  ] , and [PER Elione Vierira de Araujo  ] , a top engineer . 
They had spent much of the past week researching the incident and presenting explanations as to what happened . 
[PER Geraldes  ] and [PER Olivera  ] joined the conversation late after an impromptu meeting with the Director General of [ORG ONS  ] to discuss the incident . 
The team gave [PER Econoff  ] the same presentation they gave after the incident to Energy Minister [PER Lobao  ] . 
On November 20 , [PER Econoff  ] met separately with [PER Jose Coimbra  ] , Chief of Staff to Minister of Mines and Energy [PER Edison Lobao  ] , and [PER Ildo Wilson Grudtner  ] , Deputy Assistant Secretary for Electrical Energy , who was the Ministry official called in to work the issue the night of November the 10th and with overall responsibility for electrical sector planning. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Based on those detailed discussions , the following is what the government now says occurred . 
The source of the outage was a substation close to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] called [LOC Itaburi  ] on the [ORG Tijuco Preto  ] powerline , which supplies [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and then Rio with power from the [LOC Itaipu  ] dam ( a binational hydroelectric dam on the border with [LOC Paraguay  ] responsible for 12,600MW of energy or 20 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy supply . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's energy matrix is heavily hydro dependent - 80 percent - with the rest a combination of thermo , nuclear , and some bioelectricity . 
) . 
At that point in the system there are three separate power lines that connect [LOC Itaipu  ] into [LOC Sao Paulo  ] carrying 765 kilovolts of 60HZ [ORG AC  ] supply . 
There is a separate supply line from [LOC Itaipu  ] into [LOC Sao Paulo  ] north of the [ORG Tijuco Preto  ] power line , which carries 50 Hz of [LOC DC  ] power . 
The [ORG Sao Paulo/Rio  ] region is also linked by separate lines to the southern part of the country , as well as to the north and north east , which are also interlinked with one another . 
Overall system consumption for the day was 60 GW , well below total system capacity of 105 GW. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) At 22:13 , there was a short circuit in one of the three [LOC Itaburi  ] lines in what they call the " B " cycle . 
13.5 milliseconds later , cycle " A " experienced a short circuit in the second line . 
3.2 milliseconds after that , the substation at [LOC Itaber  ] went out , knocking out the third and final line , completely disrupting the flow of the southern supply line from [LOC Itaipu  ] into [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
When this happened , automated controls took over to preserve the system . 
The generators at [LOC Itaipu  ] shut down when they detected the disruption in [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001383 002 OF 005 transmission , thereby also shutting down the northern supply line to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
The interlinked systems in the northeast and northern regions of the country , detecting oscillation in the supply coming from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , shut off the transmission lines to protect those regions . 
In the southern region of the country , which was also providing energy supply to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , the sudden changes in frequency triggered [ORG ERAC  ] ( an emergency system in each substation monitoring balance between the supply and the load ) isolating the southern section from the rest of the grid . 
These changes preserved the rest of the system and permitted a quick return to service for most of the country , but left the major population centers without power for up to six hours . 
WHAT FACTORS EXACERABATED THE EVENT ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Geraldes  ] described the events of November 10 as unusual , not in the interruption of the system , but in the confluence of events that led to the overall catastrophic scale of the blackout . 
He said that a similar disruption taking out the same line had occurred in the past but the system had been operating in such a way that the flow was redistributed with very little disruption . 
In the November 10 case , reservoirs were full due to recent abundant rainfalls and the thermal plants , which are often tapped to augment flow , were not operating . 
The interlinked system which allows electricity from any part of the country to be distributed to any other part was exporting power from the primary hydroplants in the [LOC South  ] to the [ORG Sao Paulo/Rio  ] region . 
According to [PER Geraldes  ] , in prior instances , the situation was reversed , with flow exported from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] to the south during periods of less plentiful rainfall and the disruption had very little effect on the overall supply. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Grudtner  ] said international standards generally call for a system to have capacity allowing unimpeded operation with one transmission line inoperable . 
At the time of the incident , the [MISC Brazilian  ] system was operating at a capacity of unimpeded operations with two lines down , but the incident took out all three lines feeding into [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
Additionally [LOC Coimbra  ] pointed out , each of the lines which were disabled have recovery times of ten seconds , but the short circuits occurred within milliseconds of one another , disabling the transmission system with automatic shutdowns before the lines were able to recover . 
[PER Geraldes  ] called it the worst possible configuration of factors that led to a cascade effect . 
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER ? <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) A government commission composed of [ORG ONS  ] and the [MISC Brazilian  ] electricity regulator ANEEL is investigating exactly what happened on November 10 . 
The commission has 30 days from its formation on November 13 to complete a draft of its findings , including possible recommendations . 
The government will then submit the draft report to an independent group of non-governmental experts and academicians for review . 
The government will finalize the report after that review . 
In the absence of the final report , neither [ORG ONS  ] nor [ORG MME  ] offered a definitive explanation for what caused these outages . 
However , they both maintained that the short circuits are consistent with either a lightning strike ( although [ORG ONS  ] took pains to show satellite photos demonstrating that there were not storms in that area at that particular time ) or a combination of low barometric pressure combined with high winds and high humidity . 
[ORG ONS  ] also showed photos of transmission towers with visible discoloration , which they say further supports these two theories and rules out damage from trees , physical sabotage , or hackers . 
( Note: there was no way for Econoff to verify the location of the towers in the photos , the times of the discoloration , nor the cause . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Oliveira  ] and [PER Geraldes  ] further ruled out the possibility of hackers because , following some acknowledged interferences in past years , GOB has closed the system to only a small group of authorized operators , separated the transmission control system from other systems , and installed filters . 
[LOC Coimbra  ] confirmed that the [ORG ONS  ] system is a [MISC CLAN  ] network using its own wires carried above the electricity wires . 
[ORG Oliveira  ] pointed out that even if someone had managed to gain access to the system , a voice command is required to disrupt transmission . 
[LOC Coimbra  ] said that while sabotage could have caused the outages , this type of disruption would have been deadly , and investigators would have found physical evidence , including the body of the perpetrator . 
He also noted that any internal attempts by system employees to disrupt the system would have been easily [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001383 003 OF 005 traceable , a fact known to anyone with access to the system . 
THEORIES FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR , PRESS , AND OTHER AGENCIES <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) In the days immediately following the event , government officials were quoted giving explanations ranging from a downed powerline hit by a tree , storm damage , to the more general and on-message short circuit . 
Meteorologists and energy analysts questioned the government 's weather explanations . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Institute of Space Research  ] ( [ORG INPE  ] ) , which monitors atmospheric activity , stated they recorded no lightning strikes on the day of the blackout in the immediate vicinity of the transmission lines in question . 
[PER Adriano Pires  ] , founding director of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Center for Infrastructure and a highly-regarded [MISC Rio-based  ] energy expert , ruled out the government 's explanations , instead blaming an outdated national grid unable to keep pace with demand . 
In order to avoid future widespread outages , [PER Pires  ] told Rio Econoff , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government needs to diversify its sources away from [ORG Itaipu  ] by increasing thermoelectric generation and focusing less on just operating costs . 
Press reports have also suggested that , in order to handle the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and 2016 [MISC Olympic Games  ] , the [ORG GoB  ] needs to upgrade its transmission lines and build smaller-scale power plants - independent of the national grid - closer to high energy consumption centers , such as [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In the meeting with [LOC Brasilia  ] econoff , [ORG ONS  ] officials uniformly rejected the claims of an outdated grid , noting that the current grid was brought up to date after the 2001 blackouts , and now meets and exceeds international performance criteria and serves some 98% of the country . 
[LOC Coimbra  ] laughed at the suggestion that more construction of thermo plants is the solution , not only because there are existing thermo plants which are not being utilized due to high generation costs , but because even had they been in use , the thermo plants would need 12-13 hours to power up after a power failure . 
[ORG Itaipu  ] was operating again at full capacity less than 30 minutes after the disruption. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) Two days after the incident , according to a credible source , security officials in [LOC Brazil  ] were attributing the outage to " human error " on the part of a [MISC Brazilian  ] national who is a system operator . 
Accordingly to the source , that operator was under investigation . 
Source is unavailable for further comment on whether evolving assessments may have affected that hypothesis and the status of that particular investigation is unknown . 
There was also private speculation in at least one conversation among some government officials , apparently based in part of the coincidental " 60 Minutes program " just days earlier suggesting vulnerabilities in the [MISC Brazilian  ] system , that [LOC U.S.  ] private sector interests may have engineered the blackouts to gain better commercial access to the grid . 
INTERIM STEPS TO PREVENT SECURITY AND OUTAGE INCIDENTS <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Geraldes  ] acknowledged that the spotlight of the [MISC Olympic Games  ] brings an increased scrutiny of the system . 
[ORG ONS  ] has a protocol to guard against electricity disruptions which has been utilized during special events such as the [MISC Pan Am Games  ] in 2007 and will be used in upcoming events including the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] . 
The protocol includes running all thermal plants , many of these located close to major cities including Rio , during the event to ensure multiple sources of generation . 
Regular maintenance is deferred during the event to minimize the possibility of disruption and regular transmission patterns are maintained to ensure the consistency of normal flow . 
[PER Geraldes  ] acknowledged actual physical security was a low priority under this protocol and said no special plans were made even during events . 
As [PER Geraldes  ] said , " That has been less of a concern for us than for you . 
" However he agreed that there could be an increased focus on physical security in advance of the games , particularly after this incident has called attention to possible weaknesses in the system. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The perspective from [ORG MME  ] was somewhat different . 
[LOC Coimbra  ] noted that " we are not immune from the kinds of threats that you have seen in recent years . 
" There is a group in President [PER Lula  ] 's office known as the [ORG Cabinet for Infrastructure Security  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) that is looking at infrastructure security . 
[LOC Coimbra  ] recalled that they were the first to contact him after the incident . 
Grudtner is tasked with leading the [ORG Ministry 's  ] own effort on physical security and he said [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001383 004 OF 005 that the [ORG MME  ] working group is in the process of defining which installations are of greatest concern/most integral to the system , and therefore in need of physical protection. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG ONS  ] officials told [PER Econoff  ] that there was also an intensive process going on at the Energy Planning Agency , [LOC EPE  ] , to develop recommendations for how to avoid outage problems in the future . 
One immediate measure [LOC Brazil  ] has undertaken to guard against a repeat occurrence during the investigation period is reducing the amount of flow in any one direction to take the pressure off the system - but with the by-product of increased reliance on the more expensive thermo plants , increasing the price of electricity . 
Another longer-term option under consideration would be to build newer , larger , and therefore stronger transmission equipment ; an expensive option that the [ORG ONS  ] contacts intimated would not be worth the price to avoid a highly unlikely repeat of the November 10 blackout . 
16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ONS  ] shared the country 's five year plan for energy which plans for significant increases in energy demand , to be largely met in the near term with new hydro plants and increases in oil-fueled electric plants . 
While projections show sufficient electricity to meet demand , [PER Geraldes  ] cautioned the picture could change if there are unanticipated delays in completing the [LOC Belo Monte  ] hydro plant due to come on line in April of 2014 , just a few months in advance of the July [MISC World Cup.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Though [ORG MME  ] 's [LOC Coimbra  ] did not offer any thoughts for what might be technological recommendations after this event , he did say that one area of focus for the [ORG GOB  ] in a lessons learned-type exercise would be improving communications with the public during such events , as well as in advance of anticipated maintenance that could cause temporary outages . 
He was interested in learning more about the [LOC U.S.  ] Emergency Broadcast system as one possible way of handling this challenge . 
[PER Econoff  ] committed to research the [LOC U.S.  ] program and send information to see whether cooperation on this front was feasible . 
MANAGING THE POLITICS <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Both [ORG MME  ] and [ORG ONS  ] were eager to put the November 10 blackout in perspective . 
[ORG ONS  ] offered a slide that showed other comparable international blackouts over the last 30 years , including the four day [LOC East Coast  ] blackout in 2003 , detailing both the extent and duration of the blackouts ; a cmparison in which the [LOC Brazil  ] blackout fared well . 
[LOC Coimbra  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that an [MISC American  ] engineering association had sent an official letter of congratulations to the [ORG Center for Electrical Research  ] , [ORG CEPAL  ] , on the rapid recovery of the system and inviting them to a [LOC U.S.  ] conference in the first part of next year to share their experiences . 
Both [ORG ONS  ] and [ORG MME  ] point out how quickly most of the system came back ( the majority of the affected areas experienced outages of 20 minutes and the longest outage was six hours in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ) . 
As Grudtner said , the electrical sector was happy because the system functioned as it should have and came back comparatively quickly , but the politicians are not . 
Meanwhile , he noted wryly , the press is pleased to have fodder for its reports . 
[ORG Congress  ] has called for hearings on the incident which have had to be postponed because experts were traveling to the area on a fact finding mission in order to complete the investigation report . 
COMMENT: NOTABLE OPENNESS TO DIALOGUE WITH USG <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] officials were strikingly open to discussing the incident with [ORG Embassy  ] personnel , non-defensive in response to questions , and forthcoming with their information and assessments . 
The willingness of the President of [ORG ONS  ] and [ORG MME  ] Chief of Staff to meet on such a technical issue and provide detailed information to the [ORG Embassy  ] demonstrates the importance they place on ensuring the USG has an understanding of the blackout and [LOC Brazil  ] 's capability to handle major events in the future . 
Blackouts in [LOC Brazil  ] are not uncommon ( in fact Rio experienced another blackout on November 23 which has been attributed to disruptions in transmission , possibly due to stolen cables ) . 
However , the scale of the November 10 blackout , which garnered undesired international attention , may prompt [LOC Brazil  ] to seek long-lasting solutions to weaknesses in and threats to its electricity supply . 
Heading into a major election year , the [ORG GOB  ] will likely want to show they are taking measures to rebuild public trust . 
In light of the openness displayed by [ORG GOB  ] officials in discussing this event , combined with a desire to show progress on addressing the issue , the USG has an opportunity to work [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001383 005 OF 005 with the [ORG GOB  ] as they seek to identify possible improvements that will yield real results in the physical security and reliability of its network . 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR USG ENGAGEMENT - SEIZE THE MOMENT <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Having devoted much time and many resources to correcting problems in national electricity supply that were endemic in 2001 , the [ORG GOB  ] is proud of its interlinked national transmission system and has tended to view the blackouts that do occur as isolated incidents or as problems with local distribution systems . 
On recent visits to the [LOC United States  ] , Energy Deputy Minister [PER Zimmermann  ] suggested that transmission and long-range distribution might be a subject in which [LOC Brazil  ] has expertise it could share with the [LOC United States  ] in an energy cooperation agreement . 
While [ORG GOB  ] will be highly resistant to the idea that other countries are more advanced than they are in transmission and distribution , [ORG GOB  ] officials do acknowledge there is some room for improvement in their system . 
We will know more about the immediate cause of [LOC Brazil  ] 's major blackout in a few weeks but in the meantime , there are opportunities for the USG to take advantage of [ORG GOB  ] 's openness , highlighting the outage as reason for more engagement as well as preparations toward the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] . 
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY COOPERATION OPPORTUNITIES <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) This would be an excellent occasion to encourage the military to military Communication and [ORG Information Security Memorandum of Agreement  ] ( [ORG CISMOA  ] ) , noting that although this incident does not appear to have been the result of an attack on the system , such an event is possible and signing this agreement would permit cooperation were one to occur . 
We could also consider a cybersecurity working group . 
[LOC Brazil  ] might be open to pursuing cooperation on critical infrastructure protection , and [ORG MME  ] has already told us they would be interested in learning more about our emergency broadcasting system . 
It is clear that physical security has not heretofore been a major focus for planners but officials acknowledge the possibility of an attack and are working on developing protections , another possible area for fruitful cooperation as a follow up from [ORG DHS  ] visit in the later part of 2008 . 
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION OPPORTUNITIES <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Regarding infrastructure development , [ORG USTDA  ] is now exploring the possibility of sponsoring an orientation visit or a field study on electrical power . 
Up to this point , [ORG USTDA  ] has not pursued cooperation in the electrical area . 
Most infrastructure projects in this centralized electrical system are at the federal level , which generally translates into more bureaucracy and longer implementation times than projects undertaken at the state or local level . 
There are , however , electrical distribution issues which need to be addressed at the state and local levels that could benefit from [ORG USTDA  ] involvement , possibly offering another means of engagement to help [LOC Brazil  ] solve its electrical challenges . 
Prior to this event , the [ORG Energy Ministry  ] had highlighted Smartgrid technology as one area that would be of interest to them in cooperation , perhaps more so now. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) Mission encourages USG agencies , including [ORG DOD  ] , [ORG DHS  ] , [ORG FCC  ] , [ORG TDA  ] and others , to explore these opportunities in the near-term .
