( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
In a February 17 meeting , UAE Foreign Minister [PER Sheikh Abdullah  ] bin [PER Zayed Al Nahyan  ] ( [ORG AbZ  ] ) discussed [LOC Iran  ] with a four-member [ORG Congressional  ] delegation led by Chairwoman [PER Nita Lowey  ] of the [ORG House Appropriations Subcommittee  ] on Foreign Operations . 
[ORG AbZ  ] told the [MISC Codel  ] the nuclear issue is only one aspect of the [LOC Iran  ] problem , and that [LOC Iran  ] 's regional meddling was a serious concern . 
He pledged the [LOC UAE  ] 's backing as the [LOC US  ] rallies support for new sanctions but questioned whether they would achieve the desired effect . 
[ORG AbZ  ] noted the [LOC UAE  ] 's growing concern that [LOC Gulf  ] allies were being shut out of [LOC Iran  ] sanctions planning . 
End Summary . 
IRAN'S REACTORS AND REACH ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] began by expressing pride in the [MISC US-UAE  ] 123 agreement and the bilateral relationship generally . 
According to [ORG AbZ  ] , the 123 is a powerful example for the region and provides a transparent alternative to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear model . 
The [LOC UAE  ] views [LOC Iran  ] as a huge problem that goes far beyond nuclear capabilities . 
[MISC Iranian  ] support for terrorism is broader than just [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] has influence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Bahrain  ] , the [ORG Eastern Province of KSA  ] , and [LOC Africa  ] ( [ORG AbZ  ] mentioned [LOC Nigeria  ] specifically ) . 
[MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] have close , cooperative ties . 
If [LOC Iran  ] acquires nuclear weapons , the expeditionary aspect of its foreign policy will become ever more challenging for neighboring states . 
POSSIBILITY AND FUTILITY OF SANCTIONS ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lowey  ] asked what [ORG AbZ  ] thought about tougher sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] and how the [LOC UAE  ] can help with [LOC China  ] . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said the [LOC US  ] and its allies " have to decide how to stop [LOC Iran  ] " and that the [LOC UAE  ] was surprised at the [MISC Chinese  ] attitude . 
[ORG AbZ  ] noted the [MISC Emiratis  ] and the [MISC Saudis  ] have spoken to the [MISC Chinese  ] , and the [LOC UAE  ] expressed a willingness to expand its energy ties ( Note: [ORG AbZ  ] seemed to be indicating that this was intended as a carrot , but he acknowledged the difficulty of supplanting an [MISC Iran-China  ] trade relationship that reached $50 billion last year . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] urged quick action on tough new sanctions . 
The [LOC UAE  ] is conscientious in its efforts to enforce existing [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions but the [MISC Iranians  ] have been able to find other routes , bypassing [LOC UAE  ] ports , to import what they need . 
[ORG AbZ  ] predicted that smart and swift implementation of new sanctions could still be ineffective but said that we must try . 
[ORG GULF NEIGHBORS FEELING LEFT  ] OUT ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] highlighted a growing belief the [LOC UAE  ] and the [ORG GCC  ] are being left out of our [LOC Iran  ] sanctions consultations . 
[ORG AbZ  ] told Chairwoman [PER Lowey  ] that the P5+1 negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] should be expanded to included the [ORG GCC  ] . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said there is a " trust barrier " to full [ORG GCC  ] support for [LOC US  ] policy , as there is a deep suspicion that the [LOC US  ] is proceeding without consulting [LOC Gulf  ] allies. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] raised ( as he likes to do regularly ) the 2005 [ORG EU  ] package offer to [LOC Iran  ] that was briefed to the [LOC UAE  ] by the [MISC Iranians  ] , not the [LOC US  ] or another ally . 
Things have improved since then , but " we still need some serious trust building between the [LOC US  ] , the [ORG EU  ] , and the [ORG GCC  ] " on this issue . 
The [ORG DCM  ] reminded [ORG AbZ  ] ( and the [MISC Codel  ] ) that there are extensive and privileged communications between the [LOC UAE  ] and the [ORG USG  ] on policy towards [LOC Iran  ] and on sanctions planning . 
[ORG AbZ  ] acknowledged there was trust from the [LOC UAE  ] , but the rest of the [ORG GCC  ] had continuing concerns . 
" Your problem today is to fix your relations with the [ORG GCC  ] , quickly . 
A few countries in the region are already dealing with [LOC Iran  ] as if they had the bomb . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AbZ  ] said [ORG GCC  ] states are left wondering what will happen to them in any deal the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Iran  ] reach through back channel conversations . 
He compared the current multilateral conversations over [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program with negotiations over [LOC North Korea  ] 's nuclear program , asking why [LOC North Korea  ] 's neighbors are part of the [ORG Six Party  ] negotiations , but the [ORG GCC  ] is not equally involved in similar conversations about and with [LOC Iran  ] . 
" WHAT IF ? 
" SCENARIOS -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In response to questions from members of [ORG Congress  ] , [ORG AbZ  ] said that if [LOC Iran  ] goes nuclear others in the region will move forward on the same track and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty will completely break down . 
He said a crisis or confrontation in the region would create oil supply problems worldwide . 
14 million barrels a day pass through the [ORG Strait of Hormuz  ] . 
That said , he noted that the [LOC US  ] and [LOC UAE  ] militaries have plans to keep [ORG Hormuz  ] clear. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [ORG AbZ  ] concluded the meeting with a soliloquy on the importance of a successful peace process between [LOC Israel  ] and its neighbors as perhaps the most effective way of reducing [LOC Iran  ] 's regional influence. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Members of [ORG Congress  ] in attendance: Congresswoman [PER Nita Lowey  ] , Congressman [PER Tom Cole  ] , Congresswoman [PER Barbara Lee  ] , Congresswoman [PER Donna Edwards  ] .
