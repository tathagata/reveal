<code><pre>S E C R E T LISBON 002307 SIPDIS SIPDIS FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM AMBASSADOR [PER ALFRED HOFFMAN  ] E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 09/07/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PO_0.html'>PO</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S SEPTEMBER 17 MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER SOCRATES Classified By: Ambassador [PER Alfred Hoffman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Mr. President: Your meeting with Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] -- two months into [LOC Portugal  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency -- provides an excellent early opportunity to try to shape the [MISC Portuguese  ] government 's priorities in a direction consistent with [LOC U.S.  ] interests , both from a bilateral perspective and in the [ORG EU  ] context . 
[LOC Portugal  ] - A Steadfast Ally --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Portugal  ] , a founding member of [ORG NATO  ] , is a steadfast ally that has consistently stood by our side over the years under both center-right and center-left governments . 
The President and Prime Minister -- from opposing political parties -- each regularly stress that trans-Atlantic relations are a pillar of [MISC Portuguese  ] foreign policy and that [ORG NATO  ] is the primary guarantor of [MISC European  ] security . 
At our request , [LOC Portugal  ] ultimately withdrew its leading candidacy to host the 2008 [ORG NATO  ] Summit in favor of [LOC Romania  ] . 
In return , the [ORG USG  ] agreed to support [LOC Portugal  ] 's bid to host the 2010 [ORG NATO  ] Summit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] has provided virtually free access to [MISC Portuguese  ] air and seaports for military support operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with over three thousand flights a year transiting [ORG Lajes Air Base  ] in the [LOC Azores  ] . 
It has also granted permission to use [ORG Lajes  ] in support of repatriation of detainees from [LOC Guatanamo  ] . 
Despite severe budgetary constraints , it is currently engaged internationally on numerous fronts with military personnel in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( where it has lost one soldier ) , [LOC East Timor  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] , and , until recently , in [LOC Bosnia  ] and the [LOC Congo  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] has been an outstanding partner in the war on terror and collaborates actively with us as a member of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] , the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] , and the [ORG Global Initiative  ] to [ORG Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] presidency priorities ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While agreement on the shape of a new [ORG EU  ] treaty was achieved during the [MISC German  ] presidency , detailed negotiation and signature of the document have fallen to the [MISC Portuguese  ] presidency , which hopes to secure endorsement of a final text by the heads of government meeting in December . 
This internal [ORG EU  ] task has not derailed [LOC Portugal  ] 's external policy goals , but it has absorbed scarce resources and high-level attention within the [MISC Portuguese  ] government. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Socrates  ] and other senior [MISC Portuguese  ] officials have noted that the [ORG EU  ] 's biggest foreign policy concern is along its southern and southeastern borders , which are threatened by radical [MISC Islam  ] and poverty . 
He has proposed strengthening the [ORG EU  ] 's ties to [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC Moscow  ] , and [MISC Mediterranean  ] countries to help contain radical [MISC Islam  ] in that region ; this strategy includes lending strong support to [MISC Turkish  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] , involving the [ORG EU  ] more closely in the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] , and strengthening the [ORG EU  ] 's economic and cultural ties to the region through the [ORG Barcelona Process.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) So far during their Presidency , the [MISC Portuguese  ] have taken a primarily facilitative approach , seeking broad consensus on most issues . 
They have dedicated their individual efforts to the few issues they care most about: a strategic partnership with [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] processes noted above . 
Beyond those issues , the [MISC Portuguese  ] governmental structure has engaged in efforts to strengthen [ORG EU  ] ties with [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC Ukraine  ] through high-profile summits. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC EU-Brazil  ] summit in [LOC Lisbon  ] the first week of [LOC Portugal  ] 's presidency was successful in establishing a long-term relationship with a significant partner and energizing the debate in [LOC Europe  ] on biofuels . 
[MISC Portuguese  ] interlocutors candidly told us that they did not expect much and that the summit was only the first step toward an [MISC EU-Brazil  ] strategic partnership , but that they were delighted with the outcome . 
We believe this may raise [MISC Portuguese  ] ambitions for the other summits . 
Suggested areas of focus ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Kosovo:  ] The [MISC Portuguese  ] believe the current [MISC Troika-led  ] negotiations are a necessary last effort but are not optimistic about the outcome . 
They believe Kosovar independence is inevitable , but worry about both the Kosovars moving too quickly and the perceived need to have [MISC Russian  ] agreement on any solution . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] are working to find a legal mechanism that permits individual member states to recognize an independent [LOC Kosovo  ] absent a [ORG UNSCR  ] , and that provides the basis for deployment of an [ORG EU  ] rule of law mission . 
They need to hear from you that leaving [LOC Kosovo  ] in limbo is not an option , that giving [LOC Russia  ] veto power over foreign policy challenges in the heart of [LOC Europe  ] sets a troubling precedent , and that the world needs resolution on this troubling issue this year. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Russia: Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] visited [LOC Moscow  ] recently and was criticized in many quarters for his failure to address [LOC Russia  ] 's aggressive behavior against [ORG EU  ] allies [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Estonia  ] , human rights issues , or [LOC Moscow  ] 's penchant for rhetoric and gamesmanship on energy and security . 
[LOC Portugal  ] currently does not depend on [LOC Russia  ] for any energy needs , although that dynamic may be changing , given recent collaborative efforts between the national oil company and [ORG Gazprom  ] , and [ORG Gazprom  ] 's collaboration with [LOC Algeria  ] 's [LOC Sonatrach  ] , which provides a majority of [LOC Portugal  ] 's natural gas needs . 
[PER Socrates  ] 's advisors suggested to us following the trip that we needed to tone down our own rhetoric in order to elicit more constructive engagement from [LOC Moscow  ] . 
One senior advisor even suggested that our plan to place the missile defense system in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] -- the two more problematic [ORG EU  ] member states -- had not helped matters when we wanted the [ORG EU  ] to come to our defense. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Middle East:  ] The [MISC Portuguese  ] believe they have little historical baggage in the region and thus can advance progress on key issues . 
They have stressed many times and at the highest levels that the [ORG Road Map  ] is the way forward , but that it needs to be reinvigorated . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amado  ] has traveled extensively to the [LOC Middle East  ] and was one of the first to call for a special session of [ORG EU  ] Foreign Ministers at the onset of last summer 's hostilities in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
In addition , [LOC Portugal  ] has contributed an Army engineering company to [ORG UNIFIL  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] shares our deep concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons program and has been very supportive of efforts to increase pressure on [LOC Tehran.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Afghanistan: [MISC Portuguese  ] Special Forces and other troops serve without caveat and are engaged in heavy fighting in the volatile south . 
In addition , in response to an appeal from the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] recently agreed to assume leadership of one [ORG Operational Mentoring  ] and [ORG Liaison Team  ] ( OMLT ) . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] stress that they are with us in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for the duration of [ORG NATO  ] operations so congratulations for their current contributions are in order as well as encouragement to continue . 
[LOC Portugal  ] has contributed $2 million in assistance ; however , they are financially over-stretched and have not given more because of budgetary constraints. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Iraq: [LOC Portugal  ] had an infantry company in [LOC Iraq  ] for two years and also contributed trainers for the police training mission . 
[LOC Portugal  ] recently downsized its diplomatic presence in [LOC Baghdad  ] because of cost ( its operations were four times as expensive as any other embassy ) , but let us know far in advance and wanted to coordinate what they said publicly as they were sensitive to the political ramifications. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Africa: [LOC Portugal  ] has a special relationship with [LOC Africa  ] , particularly with its former colonies . 
It intends to host an [PER EU-Africa Summit  ] , although it has tried to deflect diplomatic conflict over the potential attendance of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] 's President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] who is subject to an [ORG EU  ] travel ban . 
The [LOC UK  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and others may not attend at the head of government level should [PER Mugabe  ] participate . 
Although the [MISC Portuguese  ] have led the development of an action plan between the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG African Union  ] , the negative ramifications of [PER Mugabe  ] 's presence in [LOC Lisbon  ] could overshadow any accomplishments. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Major Economies Meeting:  ] [PER Socrates  ] was pleased that [LOC Portugal  ] , in its capacity as [ORG EU  ] President , was invited to represent the [ORG European Union  ] at the September 27-28 [MISC Major Economies Meeting  ] on Climate Change and [ORG Energy Security  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
He is strong proponent of environmental issues , having served as Environment Minister from 1999-2002 . 
The current Environment State Secretary [PER Humberto Rosa  ] is scheduled to lead the delegation . 
Particular Bilateral Points ---------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Portuguese  ] government has , at the highest levels , stressed its interest in collaborating with the [LOC United States  ] to strengthen security and stability in [LOC Africa  ] , an effort which has begun in earnest . 
We are conducting joint demining training in [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] and are looking at developing an [MISC HIV  ] prevention program for [MISC African  ] armed forces . 
We are also exploring opportunities to work together in the Special Operations arena in [LOC Africa  ] . 
We hope to include the [MISC Portuguese  ] in peacekeeping training in [LOC Mozambique  ] and [LOC Angola  ] under the [ORG African Contingency Operations  ] training and Assistance ( [ORG ACOTA  ] ) program and a joint State-Defense team from [LOC Washington  ] recently visited [LOC Lisbon  ] to discuss further opportunities . 
In addition , our [ORG Department of Commerce  ] has been working with [MISC Portuguese  ] counterparts on a program to computerize [LOC Angola  ] 's judicial records. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Socrates  ] agreed to allow the repatriation of enemy combatants out of [LOC Guatanamo  ] through [LOC Lajes Air Base  ] on a case-by-case basis . 
This was a difficult decision , given the sustained criticism by [MISC Portuguese  ] media and leftist elements of his own party over the government 's handling of the [ORG CIA  ] rendition flights controversy . 
[PER Socrates  ] 's agreement has never been made public . 
The Attorney General 's Office was forced to review a dossier of news clippings and unsubstantiated allegations regarding [ORG CIA  ] rendition operations through [LOC Portugal  ] provided by a member of the [ORG European Parliament  ] . 
The [ORG AG  ] 's report should be released in the near future . 
Although we cannot predict its conclusions , government insiders and legal scholars have told us there was no useful or prosecutable information in the dossier . 
Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] ----------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Socrates  ] is a telegenic and charismatic leader , who worked hard to improve his [MISC English  ] in advance of the [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
He relies on advice from a small circle of advisors . 
He is a very moderate Socialist who has been successful at co-opting or marginalizing the leftists in his party , from whom he has taken some heat for his pro-U.S. policies . 
He also aggressively pursued his domestic agenda before assuming the [ORG EU  ] presidency , achieving difficult labor and social security reforms and reducing [LOC Portugal  ] 's budget deficit to near EU-mandated levels .
