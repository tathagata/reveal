( U ) The description that follows of the political and economic factors helping to shape [LOC Brazil  ] 's trade policy , and specifically its approach to the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , is offered to assist [LOC U.S.  ] policymakers in determining whether and how enough common ground can be found to conclude the [ORG FTAA  ] process successfully. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary and introduction . 
A number of concurrent forces are moving [LOC Brazil  ] along its present [ORG FTAA  ] trajectory . 
These forces , or considerations for formulating policy , are sometimes contradictory and may have led to some [ORG GOB  ] miscalculation on how best to achieve [LOC Brazil  ] 's interests within the [ORG FTAA  ] as well as the degree of hemispheric support it would receive for its ideas to restructure the negotiations . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's political goals , which include a leadership role in [LOC South America  ] along with a strong focus on development and the social agenda , sometimes clash in its pursuit of certain national economic interests . 
However , the [ORG GOB  ] 's vision of a reformulated [ORG FTAA  ] is solidly rooted in its perception of national interest and of the outcome required for [LOC Brazil  ] to benefit from the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
The newly-elaborated three-track approach is not simply a negotiating ploy . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG FTAA  ] calculation has always differed from that of other countries in the hemisphere . 
For [LOC Brazil  ] , the bottom line is improved access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market for its agricultural and industrial goods , not regional rules for attracting foreign direct investment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite [LOC Brazil  ] 's strong desire to secure improved access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market , the rigid perspective of [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials in charge of [ORG FTAA  ] policy inclines us to take at face value the [ORG GOB  ] claim that it will not continue with the across the board [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations as originally envisioned and currently structured . 
We also suspect that the [ORG GOB  ] is currently in a vulnerable stage in its [ORG FTAA  ] policy , given the substantial general rebuff of the [ORG Mercosul  ] three-track proposal that occurred during the [ORG Trade Negotiating Committee  ] ( [ORG TNC  ] ) meeting in [LOC San Salvador  ] July 8-11. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Regis Arslanian  ] , unofficially [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's new policy director for the [ORG FTAA  ] and [MISC Mercosul-EU  ] negotiations , has suggested privately that a compromise would be possible between [ORG Mercosul  ] 's three-track proposal and a baseline agreement that he understood the USG to have contemplated ( septel ) . 
According to [PER Arslanian  ] , a bilateral structure for all market access negotiations is the key element for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As the [ORG GOB  ] evaluates potential benefits of an [ORG FTAA  ] , assesses the current status of negotiations , and develops proposals to move the negotiations more in line with its perceived interests , we believe the following chief factors impact its deliberations: * [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire to be a regional political leader and , in particular , to be the driving force behind [ORG Mercosul  ] 's reinvigoration. * The belief that some [MISC Brazilian  ] producers are not sufficiently competitive to benefit from and in fact could lose through a free trade agreement at this time. * The recognition that [LOC Brazil  ] needs substantial expansion of exports to attain the economic growth necessary to address its social agenda. *The belief that exports to the [LOC United States  ] will continue to grow anyway. * The concern that rules within comprehensive trade agreements may constrain the [ORG GOB  ] 's ability to design its own preferred economic development policies. * The difficulty in convincing the public and [ORG Congress  ] that an [ORG FTAA  ] agreement would be a net positive for [LOC Brazil.  ] * The existence of divisions and opposition within society and government alike on the direction of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG FTAA  ] policy . 
LEADER OF SOUTH [MISC AMERICAN INTEGRATION  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The dominant theme in President [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy has been [LOC Brazil  ] 's role as the natural leader of [MISC South American  ] integration , with [ORG Mercosul  ] as the cornerstone . 
[PER Lula  ] has met almost every [MISC South American  ] counterpart at least once in the six months since taking office . 
Press reports that follow such meetings are replete with declarations of solidarity , including references to the need to forge common positions within the [ORG FTAA  ] and [ORG WTO  ] against developed country protectionism . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has used the granting of [ORG BNDES  ] credit lines to [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Peru  ] to reinforce these regional ties and fidelity to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
However , the [ORG GOB  ] may have taken the rhetoric too seriously , confusing no-cost statements of support in public declarations with substantive positions within negotiations . 
Despite [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to forge closer alliances with countries in the region , it appears that [ORG Mercosul  ] 's ( [LOC Brazil  ] 's ) proposal to reformulate the [ORG FTAA  ] was roundly rebuffed in the [LOC San Salvador  ] [ORG TNC  ] meeting. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) President [PER Kirchner  ] 's election in [LOC Argentina  ] has apparently provided [LOC Brazil  ] with a like-minded partner to make [ORG Mercosul  ] a priority . 
However , [ORG Mercosul  ] remains more important as a political project than an economic one , and at times [LOC Brazil  ] 's political interests regarding [ORG Mercosul  ] appear to blind it to its own economic interests . 
Virtually all [MISC Brazilians  ] now recognize that the [ORG Mercosul  ] market is insufficient to provide the export growth [LOC Brazil  ] needs . 
[LOC BRAZIL  ] COST - LACK OF COMPETITIVENESS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Rather than drawing attention to the new opportunities that a hemisphere-wide trade agreement could present , the [ORG FTAA  ] generates fear in [LOC Brazil:  ] the widespread perception that many [MISC Brazilian  ] industries cannot compete effectively , at least not yet . 
Although developed country protectionism is always cited as a major problem undermining [LOC Brazil  ] 's competitiveness , so are internal problems sometimes called the " [LOC Brazil  ] cost , " i.e. , high costs associated with [LOC Brazil  ] 's tax structure , outdated social security system , labor code , poor education , and , in general , bureaucratic obstacles to commerce . 
While the [ORG GOB  ] is committed to social security and tax reform , it seems to lack faith it can lower the " [LOC Brazil  ] cost " sufficiently in the near term to guarantee [MISC Brazilian  ] competitiveness in the free trade environment an [ORG FTAA  ] agreement would create . 
EXPORTS ARE ESSENTIAL <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] sees export growth as essential for economic growth and job creation . 
The [ORG GOB  ] is still following tight fiscal and monetary policies designed to control the inflation that started to accelerate following last year 's 30 percent devaluation of the Real . 
Foreign direct investment has fallen off and capital in-flows have not recouped following last year 's financial uncertainties . 
Exports grew at a record pace at the beginning of this year , but are expected to taper off somewhat with a strengthened currency . 
Although the [ORG FTAA  ] is a trade negotiation among 34 countries , the [ORG GOB  ] has stated clearly that its primary interest is access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market for goods . 
Thus there is a strong incentive for Brazil-led [ORG Mercosul  ] to stick with the [ORG FTAA  ] if it is clear that achieving a trade agreement with the [LOC United States  ] outside the [ORG FTAA  ] is highly unlikely . 
EXPORTS HAVE BEEN GROWING <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Although seeking improved access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market is a high [ORG GOB  ] priority , some [MISC Brazilians  ] note that exports to the [LOC United States  ] continue to grow anyway , even without a trade agreement . 
The [LOC United States  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest export market , and officials cite growth in exports to the [LOC United States  ] in each of the last seven years as evidence of a trend . 
Although the [ORG GOB  ] wants to negotiate increased access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market through the [ORG FTAA  ] , it is unlikely that [LOC Brazil  ] would choose to do so at any cost . 
FREEDOM TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While aggressively seeking increased access to foreign markets to allow for economic development through export growth , the [ORG GOB  ] is hesitant to enter into comprehensive trade negotiations -- for example , those that include rules on services , investment and government procurement -- due to fear that these might constrain its ability to develop new economic development policies . 
Such thinking was reflected in the [ORG GOB  ] proposals in late 2002 to changes the [ORG WTO  ] TRIMS agreement to , among others , allow performance requirements for investors , and again in Brazil/Mercosul 's [ORG FTAA  ] goods market access offer that included provisions to protect infant industries . 
Although not wishing to go all the way back to the inward-looking policies of the sixties , the [ORG GOB  ] does appear more concerned about maintaining its freedom of action than about establishing better hemispheric-wide rules for economic activity . 
[ORG FTAA  ] A HARD SELL <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Hand-wringing about the [ORG FTAA  ] is a daily staple in the [MISC Brazilian  ] press , creating a constant sense of pressure and urgency . 
There isn't a single day when articles speculating about [ORG FTAA  ] policy do not appear in the major [MISC Brazilian  ] dailies , and reporting in smaller newspapers and magazines on the subject is also prolific . 
Past rhetoric by [PER Lula  ] and his [ORG PT  ] party helped create this hostile climate , and the [ORG GOB  ] has increased public doubt and confusion through its own often-conflicting statements . 
The result has limited the [ORG GOB  ] 's maneuverability and intensified the leadership challenge it faces in winning domestic approval for any agreement. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Opposition to the [ORG FTAA  ] is not new in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Although industries worry about the " [LOC Brazil  ] cost " and their own specific competitive aspects , and labor organizations are fearful about employment repercussions and loss of union leadership , the arguments of the most vocal opponents are usually ideological . 
The emphasis that [PER Lula  ] and [ORG Itamaraty  ] have given under the [PER Lula  ] administration to communication with civil society , both domestically and through [ORG FTAA  ] hemisphere-wide fora , underscores the [ORG GOB  ] 's real concern about garnering public support for the [MISC FTAA.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) We believe that concern about deep-seated domestic opposition to an [ORG FTAA  ] deal is behind [ORG Mercosul  ] 's recent proposal to allow participation of private sector and legislative representatives in its official [ORG FTAA  ] delegations . 
In contrast to other countries' concerns about confidentiality and the inflexibility that an expanded [MISC SIPDIS  ] delegation composition might introduce into the negotiations , [LOC Brazil  ] apparently sees direct participation by these groups as a means of gaining their approval for any eventual agreement . 
The [ORG GOB  ] may also be pushing for a bilateral structure for market access because it would be simpler to explain the trade-offs that were made to reach agreement . 
Similarly , for [ORG Itamaraty  ] a " positive list " approach for services and investment market access makes it easier to convey details on concessions to labor leaders and other social and political leaders . 
NOT EVERYONE AGREES WITH [ORG ITAMARATY  ] POLICY <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) There has been a recent consolidation of power within [ORG Itamaraty  ] , first with the replacement of Ambassador Hugueney and now with the replacement of Ambassador [PER Simas  ] , of a group that has viewed the [ORG FTAA  ] skeptically for years . 
By all accounts , the driving force behind current [ORG Itamaraty  ] policy is the Secretary-General , [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] . 
He has been among the [MISC Brazilian  ] observers who have for years portrayed an [ORG FTAA  ] deal as at worst as a project of the [LOC United States  ] to take over the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy and at best as a necessary evil. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) However , not everyone within the diplomatic corps nor within the government agrees with [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's current [ORG FTAA  ] policy . 
Within other ministries , including the ministries of Agriculture , Development and Finance , there is concern that [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's minimalist approach does not take proper account of the potential economic benefits to be gained through the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Nonetheless , [ORG Itamaraty  ] has been put in charge of coordinating [ORG FTAA  ] policymaking , and we do not believe efforts to exploit differences among ministers would be successful . 
Attempts to stir the pot in this way would likely only stiffen hardliners and undermine like-minded ministers . 
COMMENT <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) As the [ORG GOB  ] reflects on its next step ( s ) given the lack of support for [ORG Mercosul  ] 's three-track proposal , we believe it will see its scope for movement as very limited . 
After so publicly arguing for this approach , the [ORG GOB  ] will have a hard time abandoning it . 
Some in the [ORG GOB  ] may harbor a sense of being misled , since they took Ambassador [PER Zoellick  ] 's presentations in [LOC Brasilia  ] in May as an invitation to engage in a dialog about reformulation of the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
[PER Arslanian  ] , for example , said the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation in [LOC El Salvador  ] was disappointed that the [LOC U.S.  ] side made no mention there of a " baseline " approach. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) There are intense political and social pressures for [LOC Brazil  ] to step back from the broad-based [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations as currently configured . 
Should the [ORG GOB  ] fail to obtain structural changes in the negotiations , [LOC Brazil  ] is likely to simply go through the motions with the [ORG FTAA  ] , refraining from constructive participation . 
Eventually it might even feel compelled to suspend participation in the negotiations , reluctant as it might be as a regional leader to be seen as the villain who killed the golden egg. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The present moment could be an opportune time should the [ORG USG  ] decide to explore potential modifications to the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations that would give [LOC Brazil  ] some of the political backing it is seeking . 
As noted above , [PER Regis Arslanian  ] seemed to suggest to econoff that [ORG Mercosul  ] could be flexible on a number of areas important to the [LOC United States  ] -- services and investment rules , [ORG IPR  ] and government procurement within the [ORG FTAA  ] -- as long as market access could be negotiated bilaterally . 
In future discussions the [ORG USG  ] may have with the [ORG GOB  ] on this issue , we would of course be leaving [LOC Brazil  ] in no doubt that it , not the [ORG USG  ] , is the demandeur for change in [ORG FTAA  ] scope .
