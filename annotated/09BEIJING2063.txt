Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Embassy contacts have reported that relations among [LOC China  ] 's top leaders remained largely stable , and the arrangements put in train for succession at the 18th [ORG Party Congress  ] in 2012 appeared to be holding , with [PER Xi Jinping  ] likely to become [ORG Party  ] chief and [PER Li Keqiang  ] to become Premier . 
Three years out , however , this succession scenario was by no means guaranteed , contacts contended , as a number of factors could cause [PER Xi  ] to stumble . 
End Summary . 
Tense , but Stable , Succession in [LOC Place...  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Echoing views we have heard from a number of contacts over the past several months [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told [PER PolOff  ] on May 13 that the [ORG Party  ] leadership , in general , was " stable . 
" [PER Chen  ] said it was too early to be certain about the outcome of the 18th [ORG Party Congress  ] in 2012 , but that he considered [PER Xi Jinping  ] to still be the front runner and [PER Li Keqiang  ] the runner-up . 
On May 26 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] senior editor at the [ORG Central Committee  ] paper Guangming Ribao , separately agreed that the final succession outcome was too early to call but that the situation at the top was stable . 
All the leaders know that they had to hang together , [PER Dong  ] said , or they would hang separately . 
That was the lesson of the 1989 Tiananmen unrest and the fall of the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] , according to [LOC Dong.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who served on the [ORG Central Committee General Office  ] research staff when Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] was [ORG General Office  ] Director in the late 1980s , stated in a meeting with PolOffs on May 18 that despite natural tensions and differences of view , the leadership was " very stable " and will remain so through 2012 . 
In his view , [PER Deng  ] 's final legacy to the [ORG Party  ] was a system designed to avoid the vicious infighting of the past . 
The leadership lineup put in place at the 17th [ORG Congress  ] was not likely to change , with [PER Xi Jinping  ] most likely becoming [ORG Party General  ] Secretary and [PER Li Keqiang  ] taking the Premier slot . 
[PER Hu  ] to Retain [ORG CMC Chair  ] ? ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] separately predicted that , as things now stand , [PER Hu Jintao  ] would probably stay on as [ORG Central Military Commission Chair  ] at the 18th [ORG Party Congress  ] in 2012 , following the example of former [ORG Party  ] chief [PER Jiang Zemin  ] in <a id='par2002' href='#par2002'>¶</a>2002 . 
[PER Chen  ] dismissed the possibility of [PER Hu  ] trying to retain his positions of General Secretary and President , even though there was no formal rule mandating that he step down . 
There was strong consensus in the [ORG Party against China  ] 's top leader serving beyond two five-year " terms . 
" [PER Chen  ] claimed that [PER Li Changchun  ] , [PER He Guoqiang  ] , and [PER Zhou Yongkang  ] , widely perceived as belonging to the [PER Jiang Zemin-Zeng Qinghong  ] political network , had all " sided with " and " supported " [PER Hu Jintao  ] and , in return , hoped this would pay dividends for their political allies in 2012 . 
As a result , [PER Chen  ] asserted , [PER Hu Jintao  ] was now " very strong , " even though he still must rule primarily through consensus as the " first among equals " among the nine-member [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] ( [ORG PBSC  ] ) . .. . 
But Succession [MISC Sweepstakes Not Set  ] in [LOC Stone  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , it was still " very early , " and [PER Xi  ] could " stumble , " potentially resulting in changes to the lineup in 2012 . 
For example , if [PER Hu  ] 's strength continued to grow , [PER Hu  ] might yet try to elevate [PER Li Keqiang  ] into the top job , [PER Chen  ] calculated . 
[PER Chen  ] said that the upcoming provincial personnel reshuffles would provide one clue to the leadership plans for 2012 as well as a barometer to measure [PER Hu  ] 's strength. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] formerly international page columnist of [ORG China Youth Daily  ] , told [PER PolOff  ] on March 11 that one should not assume that [PER Xi  ] 's promotion to [ORG Party  ] chief was inevitable . 
[PER Xi  ] 's role as [ORG PRC  ] Vice President was " useless , " [PER Wang  ] said , and there had only been one succession in [ORG Party history  ] that went according to plan , the transfer of power from [PER Jiang Zemin  ] to [PER Hu Jintao  ] in 2002 . 
[PER Wang  ] said that rumors continued to circulate that people were trying to undermine [LOC BEIJING  ] 00002063 002 OF 002 [PER Xi  ] as heir apparent . 
[PER Wang  ] claimed that [PER Xi  ] 's extended diplomatic visits to [LOC Mexico  ] and five [MISC Latin American  ] and [LOC Caribbean  ] nations , February 8-23 , were unusual for a Vice President and speculated that [PER Xi  ] may have been sent hoping he would perform poorly and show that he was not cut out to be [LOC China  ] 's top leader . 
[PER Xi  ] 's " inappropriate " comments in [LOC Mexico  ] , [PER Wang  ] huffed , were unbecoming a Vice President and showed that [PER Xi  ] was not very well cultivated ( ge ren xiu yang bu hao ) . 
( [LOC Note:  ] In [LOC Mexico  ] , [PER Xi  ] lashed out at " idle foreigners with nothing better to do " than criticize [LOC China  ] . 
) The [ORG CYL  ] group still hoped [PER Li Keqiang  ] could takeover from [PER Hu  ] , [PER Wang  ] stated . 
( See Ref B for rumors of possible maneuvering between [PER Xi  ] and [PER Li  ] in [LOC China  ] 's northeast . 
) [ORG Wen-Hu Tensions  ] Downplayed -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Chen  ] dismissed reports in [MISC Western  ] media of tension between [LOC Wen  ] and [PER Hu  ] . 
In particular , he discounted interpretations of [LOC Wen  ] 's absence at the May 12 memorial ceremony commemorating last year 's [LOC Wenchuan  ] earthquake as evidence of such tension . 
[PER Chen  ] stated that it would be unusual for both [PER Hu  ] and [LOC Wen  ] to appear together at such an event , noting that there was only one other [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] member present , seventh-ranking [PER Li Keqiang  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was not a sign of tension with [PER Hu  ] . 
[PER Wu  ] attributed the absence of [LOC Wen  ] photographs in the commemorative displays , which many observers claimed was a sign of tension because of [LOC Wen  ] 's high profile presence in [LOC Wenchuan  ] at the time of the earthquake , to political maneuvering by [ORG Sichuan Party  ] Secretary [PER Liu Qibao  ] . 
[PER Liu  ] , a [MISC CYL-faction  ] official in [PER Hu  ] 's camp , was simply trying to curry favor with [PER Hu  ] , according to [PER Wu  ] . 
[PER Wu  ] maintained that despite natural differences of views between [PER Hu  ] and [LOC Wen  ] , the two had a very close working relationship which would continue until the next leadership turnover in <a id='par2012' href='#par2012'>¶</a>2012 . 
( See Ref A for persistent criticism of [PER Wen Jiabao  ] ) . 
[PER Jiang  ] and [PER Zeng  ] Retain Influence ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Wu Jiaxiang  ] said that former [ORG Party  ] chief [PER Jiang Zemin  ] remained powerful but that his influence was waning over time . 
[PER Chen Jieren  ] similarly told [PER PolOff  ] last fall that [PER Jiang  ] could not be dismissed as a factor in leadership politics but that his age and ill health were starting to erode his authority . 
[PER Chen  ] dismissed rumors circulating last year that [PER Hu Jintao  ] was attempting to undermine [PER Jiang  ] , stating that it " made no sense " for [PER Hu  ] to risk provoking a conflict when [PER Jiang  ] 's influence was already decreasing. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Chen  ] claimed that former [ORG PBSC  ] member , and close [PER Jiang  ] ally , [PER Zeng  ] [PER Qinghong  ] also retained considerable influence and that [PER Jiang  ] exercised influence through [PER Zeng  ] . 
[PER Wu  ] , who knows [PER Zeng  ] [PER Qinghong  ] personally , said that [PER Zeng  ] was still powerful and exercised his influence through [PER Xi Jinping  ] . 
[PER Zeng  ] was one of [PER Xi  ] 's strong supporters in the General Secretary sweepstakes at the 17th [ORG Party Congress  ] , according to [PER Wu  ] . 
[PER Wu  ] added that it was not strange that [PER Zeng  ] had withdrawn from public view since he retired . 
In addition to current [ORG Party  ] norms which favored retired leaders staying out of public view , [PER Zeng  ] shunned the limelight of his own accord . 
In addition , [PER Zeng  ] had been suffering from minor health problems lately . 
Biographical Note on [PER Zeng  ] [PER Qinghong  ] ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Zeng  ] was one of the most open-minded of all contemporary [MISC Chinese  ] leaders and was a strong supporter of political reform , according to [PER Wu  ] [PER Jiaxiang  ] . 
In [PER Wu  ] 's view , had [PER Zeng  ] become [ORG Party General Secretary  ] , he would have led [LOC China  ] toward democracy . 
While [PER Zeng  ] was a strong supporter of former [ORG Party  ] paramount leader [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] , [PER Zeng  ] 's mindset was closer to that of former [ORG Party  ] chiefs [PER Hu Yaobang  ] and [PER Zhao Ziyang  ] and former [ORG Politburo  ] members [PER Wan Li  ] and [PER Xi Zhongxun  ] , [PER Wu  ] claimed . 
In addition , [PER Wu  ] said that [PER Zeng  ] had " a big heart " and was somewhat of an unsung hero within the [ORG Party who  ] had quietly come to the aid of many comrades in trouble . 
[PER Wu  ] related a personal experience with [PER Zeng  ] following the military crackdown in [LOC Tiananmen Square  ] in 1989 when [PER Wu  ] , having attempted suicide , was " covered with blood , " and [PER Zeng  ] used his influence to ensure that [PER Wu  ] was promptly sent to a hospital and treated for his wounds . 
[PER Zeng  ] " saved my life , " [PER Wu  ] related , adding that [PER Zeng  ] had similarly " saved " many other people [MISC GOLDBERG</pre></code>  ]
