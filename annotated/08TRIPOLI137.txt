( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Points below are keyed to ref A tasking points: -- REGULAR VISITS: Citing the cultural difficulty of keeping any sort of regular schedule in [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Sawani  ] threw cold water on the idea of establishing a schedule for regular visits . 
He stressed that [MISC Emboffs  ] could meet with the two returned detainees ( [PER Muhammad Abdallah Mansur  ] al-Rimi , ISN 194 , and [PER Ben Qumu Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamouda  ] , ISN 557 ) whenever it was " possible and appropriate " . 
Clarifying , he assured the [ORG CDA  ] that the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] would facilitate timely access , claiming that visits could be arranged with as little as a day 's notice . 
-- [ORG FAMILY/COUNSEL ACCESS: Responding  ] to the [ORG CDA  ] 's point encouraging access by counsel and family members to the detainees , [PER Sawani  ] noted that [PER Hamouda  ] ( ISN 557 ) had enjoyed a lengthy family visit within 48 hours of the [ORG CDA  ] 's meeting with him in December ( ref C ) . 
-- LEGAL BASIS FOR DETENTION: [PER Sawani  ] said he was not sure what the legal basis for the continued incarceration of the returned detainees is . 
He explained that , in general , if a detainee was wanted on specific charges under [MISC Libyan  ] law , he would be detained and debriefed by security organizations , and then transferred to judicial authorities to face legal charges . 
He suggested that if a detainee was not wanted on specific charges under [MISC Libyan  ] law , he could be released . 
He agreed to request that designated [ORG Watchdog Committee  ] counterpart [PER Muhammad Tarnesh  ] , Executive Director of the [ORG Human Rights Society of Libya  ] , follow up with security officials at the facility at which the detainees are being held to query them regarding the charges against them . 
He further suggested that P/E Chief , [ORG Post  ] 's [ORG Watchdog Committee  ] representative , contact [PER Tarnesh  ] directly to coordinate follow up . 
[ORG Post  ] is in contact with [PER Tarnesh  ] , who is working to coordinate a meeting with security officials . 
-- [ORG S/WCI TEAM VISIT:  ] [PER Sawani  ] 's comments strongly suggest that dispatching a team to assist in discussions concerning routine access to detainees would not/not be helpful .
