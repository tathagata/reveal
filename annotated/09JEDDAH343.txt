End summary . 
USG SUPPORT FOR [LOC SAUDI ARABIA  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At a previously scheduled September 5 farewell call on [LOC Prince Nayif  ] , Charge introduced [PER Mr. Brennan  ] and asked him to brief on [LOC Washington  ] perspectives on current counterterrorism challenges and efforts . 
[PER Brennan  ] opened by conveying [LOC U.S.  ] condemnation and concern over the August 27 attack on Assistant Interior Minister [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Nayif  ] as well as our great relief that he had survived the cowardly attack . 
In this regard , he said he had brought a personal letter from President [PER Obama  ] to [PER Prince Mohammed  ] expressing our concern and best wishes . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , he continued , greatly admired and appreciated the courageous work being done by the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] and the [ORG Mabahith  ] against violent extremism and terrorism . 
SHARED CONCERNS ABOUT [LOC YEMEN  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Obama  ] felt personally outraged by the attack , [PER Brennan  ] said , and emphasized that it was critically important that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] went forward in the fight against violent extremism . 
Noting that he would be visiting [LOC Yemen  ] the following day , [PER Brennan  ] said he would stress to President [PER Saleh  ] , in the strongest possible terms , the importance of combating terrorism and resolving the serious problems facing his country . 
[PER Brennan  ] also confirmed to [LOC Prince Nayif  ] that the [ORG USG  ] was working very closely with the [ORG Mabahith  ] and would be discussing in the coming days how to approach the threat coming from [LOC Yemen  ] . 
NAYIF: NO WEAKENING OF [MISC SAUDI  ] RESOLVE AGAINST TERRORISM --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Thanking [PER Brennan  ] for [ORG USG  ] support , [PER Nayif  ] emphasized that the attack had not weakened [ORG SAG  ] 's resolve to eliminate terrorism . 
Following the incident , he said , the King met with MbN , who stressed that acts of terror " would not keep us from working and doing our job . 
" At the same time , the door must always remain open to those militants who wanted to return to society . 
These terrorists were attacking the country as a whole and would not hesitate to attack anyone to reach their goals . 
" Every [MISC Saudi  ] official is at risk of attack , " he said . 
" Despite this , we are still willing to put forth more effort against terrorism , which is more dangerous than any illness . 
" Fear of losing one 's life was not a reason to stop working . 
We had a duty to defend the country , and it was preferable to die doing one 's duty . 
" [PER God  ] determined a person 's fate and everyone will go back to [PER God  ] . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Nayif  ] then described [ORG SAG  ] 's approach to terrorism as including countering terrorist ideology , armed counterterrorism operations , and a rehabilitation program for militants who surrendered . 
The [ORG SAG  ] has created a strategic communications center where intellectuals and imams worked to explain to the public that terrorists were working against the true ways of [MISC Islam  ] and attacking [MISC Saudi  ] society . 
In countering the spread of jihadist ideology , [PER Nayif  ] added , the Friday mosque sermons -- delivered four times a month in the country 's more than 15,000 mosques -- were one of the most effective vehicles. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Asked about the economic impact of the recent attack , [PER Nayif  ] asserted that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was better off than any country in the region and among the best-situated globally in terms of economic activity . 
Using a favorite line , he said: " We know that capital is a coward and wants a safe place . 
" For this reason , people could invest with confidence in the [LOC Kingdom  ] , the economy was growing , and the government was continuing its development plans . 
The economy was thriving and the security situation was good despite being among the countries most subject to terrorist attacks . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had thwarted more than 200 terrorist operations , he said , and only 5 percent of planned attacks had actually occurred . 
" We 've achieved many things in protecting the country and , [PER God  ] willing , we will achieve many more things with our friends . 
" [PER Brennan  ] praised [ORG SAG  ] efforts to combat terrorism: " I wish other countries in the world were as willing and capable . 
" [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , he stated , was on the front line of terrorism , a model in preventing individuals from being corrupted by the propaganda of [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , and thus instrumental in demonstrating to the [LOC West  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] that [ORG Al Qaeda  ] was a perversion of [MISC Islam  ] and did not represent the true faith . 
[LOC IRAN  ] PROMOTING TERRORISM ------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Nayif  ] complained that over the past two years [LOC Iran  ] has hosted [MISC Saudis  ] ( all [MISC Sunnis  ] ) -- including [PER Osama bin Laden  ] 's son [PER Ibrahim  ] -- who had contacts with terrorists and worked against the [LOC Kingdom  ] . 
[ORG SAG  ] considered this aggressive action a breach of the 2001 security agreement between the two nations . 
The [ORG SAG  ] has informed [LOC Iran  ] through its ambassador and the [ORG MFA  ] , asking the [MISC GOI  ] to hand over these [MISC Saudis  ] . 
[PER Nayif  ] recalled that after the operations in [LOC Khobar  ] in 1996 , the [ORG SAG  ] tried to open channels with [LOC Iran  ] and tried to improve relations during [MISC Khatami  ] 's presidency . 
He himself had met personally with [ORG Iranian National Security Secretary General Dr.  ] [PER Hassan Rohani  ] ( [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Supreme Council  ] on [ORG National Security  ] ) and had signed a security agreement in which [LOC Iran  ] promised to show respect and not take any actions inside or outside [LOC Iran  ] against the [LOC Kingdom  ] . 
[PER Brennan  ] agreed that [LOC Iran  ] had the capacity to cause trouble , and assured the Prince that the [ORG USG  ] was very concerned and looking carefully at the situation . 
President [PER Obama  ] 's willingness to talk to the [MISC Iranians  ] did not mean he did not understand the problem . 
[PER Brennan  ] emphasized the [ORG SAG  ] 's strong friends in the [LOC White House  ] , including President [PER Obama  ] , wanted to work very closely with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] on this front . 
FRUSTRATION WITH [LOC EUROPE  ] ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Nayif  ] expressed frustration with the limited cooperation of friendly [MISC European  ] nations with whom the [LOC Kingdom  ] has security agreements . 
The governments , he complained , shared information but did not take any action . 
As a result , " terrorists roam around freely in their countries , " and the [MISC Europeans  ] have not handed over terrorists . 
For example , [PER Ibrahim  ] ( [PER Salih Mohammed Al-Yacoub  ] ) , a very important suspect involved in the [LOC Khobar  ] bombing , was in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] asked several nations to hand him over as a terrorist who had acted against the [LOC Kingdom  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Nayif  ] complained that while these [MISC European  ] countries were friendly , had good relations , and shared interests with the [LOC Kingdom  ] , he failed to understand why [MISC Europeans  ] harbored terrorists working against [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in their countries . 
If there were people in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] working against friendly countries , the [ORG SAG  ] would intervene . 
[PER Nayif  ] requested [ORG USG  ] help in convincing [LOC Europe  ] to work more cooperatively . 
[PER Brennan  ] commented that we had similar frustrations with some countries . 
[ORG USG-SAUDI SECURITY TIES STRONGER  ] THAN EVER ---------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Throughout the two-hour meeting , [PER Nayif  ] highlighted the importance of bilateral security cooperation , noting that the level of professional exchange has been excellent . 
[PER Nayif  ] commented that there has been success in exchanging information , procuring the best , newest , most updated technology and in finding and preventing terrorist acts before they happen . 
The final goal , he stressed , was to stop terrorists and " dry out their resources . 
" Asked by Charge if he meant terrorist financing , [PER Nayif  ] replied: " Yes . 
When we say 'resources' we mean people , training , and money . 
We have found huge sums of money on many terrorists we have caught . 
" [PER Nayif  ] expressed the hope that through joint cooperation [ORG Al Qaeda  ] as the source of terrorism in the [LOC Kingdom  ] and throughout the world could be destroyed . 
He added that the support from [MISC U.S.-Saudi  ] leadership in this area was critically important to reach the goal . 
[PER Nayif  ] thanked President [PER Obama  ] for supporting strengthened security ties between the two countries and said that [PER King Abdullah  ] was strongly committed to cooperating with the [LOC United States  ] against terrorism . 
Recalling the 1945 visit between [ORG FDR  ] and [PER King Abdulaziz  ] , [PER Nayif  ] declared , " We're acting upon what they decided . 
" [PER Brennan  ] responded that President [PER Obama  ] would be pleased to hear that the [MISC Saudi  ] commitment to our special relationship remained stronger than ever. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) This message was cleared by Assistant to the President [PER John Brennan  ] .
