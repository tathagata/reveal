( C ) Summary . 
A delegation of [MISC Brazilian  ] federal deputies could travel to [LOC Havana  ] soon to learn more about the [MISC Cuban  ] boxers who were returned to [LOC Cuba  ] during the [MISC PanAm  ] games after apparently trying to defect and then undergoing a change of heart . 
The deputies would try to see the boxers to determine whether they have suffered any retaliation from the [MISC Cuban  ] government , but the president of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] may not allow the trip for budgetary reasons . 
Although the opposition is keeping the incident alive in the press , its criticism of the [ORG GOB  ] has not resonated much outside of congress . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Deputies from the [ORG Chamber of Deputies Foreign Relations  ] and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] ( [ORG CREDN  ] ) could visit [LOC Cuba  ] in September to gather information about the circumstances of the return of two [MISC Cuban  ] boxers who competed in the [MISC PanAm Games  ] last July , then apparently tried to defect , but suddenly changed their minds . 
Last week , the [ORG CREDN  ] approved a resolution on the [LOC Cuba  ] trip , but an adviser to [PER Arlindo Chinaglia  ] , president of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] and a member of President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers Party  ] , told us that [PER Chinaglia  ] , as [MISC Chamber  ] president , must approve all official foreign travel and might well disallow this trip for budgetary reasons . 
The adviser said politics would not be an issue in the decision and that the presidential palace was not likely to pressure [PER Chinaglia  ] to block the trip . 
However , the [ORG CREDN  ] chairman has already traveled extensively , and the [MISC Chamber  ] is facing growing budgetary constraints. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) When the boxers , [PER Guillermo Rigondeaux  ] and [PER Erislandy Lara  ] , asked to go home after having gone missing , [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities quickly facilitated their request and sent them away on a [MISC Venezuelan  ] aircraft reportedly chartered by the [MISC Cuban  ] government . 
Intense congressional and media attention in the aftermath raised questions about the actions of [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities and the circumstances leading up to the boxers' return . 
Press reports described a scenario in which the boxers may or may not have had a drunken night out on the town , decided not to return to [LOC Cuba  ] , discussed contracts with a [MISC German  ] promoter , applied for visas to [LOC Germany  ] , then suddenly changed their minds and told [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] ( [ORG PF  ] ) they wanted to go back to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Local press reports said [PER Rigondeaux  ] and [PER Lara  ] had felt pressured after family members in [LOC Cuba  ] told them by phone that the government had reduced their food rations and were threatening to expel them from their homes . 
The [ORG PF  ] , which is under the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] , arranged their immediate return . 
Both houses of congress have called [ORG GOB  ] officials to testify on their actions ; Justice Minister [PER Tarso Genro  ] defended the government , s actions as being totally within the law , and noted that other [MISC Cubans  ] who sought asylum have been allowed to stay ( note: [PER Rafael D'Acosta Capote  ] , a handball player , and [PER Lazaro Lamelas  ] , a coach ) . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] is due to testify later this month . 
Members of congress continue to spar over whether the [ORG GOB  ] did the right thing and whether [LOC Brazil  ] complied with international norms of behavior. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Although it remains unclear at what level decisions were made in the [ORG GOB  ] , and what role the [MISC Cuban  ] government played , it seems most likely that the [ORG Justice  ] ministry did not look behind the boxers' sudden change of heart , and simply took the path of least resistance . 
The [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] 's unusual public statement after the event , in which it denied any part in the decision , seems to support this view . 
By operating in its usual conflict-avoidance mode and trying to rid itself of a potential problem , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government may have brought on itself unwelcome scrutiny from congressional oppositionists who might wish to show the government acting against freedom-loving [MISC Cubans  ] . 
The proposed congressional trip is the latest gambit by congressional opposition to keep the [MISC Cuban  ] boxers incident alive . 
So far , however , the effort does not seem to be resonating much outside the halls of congress .
