Sanderson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Introduction: Reftel asks for a comprehensive assessment of President [PER Preval  ] 's decision-making process and leadership style . 
As noted in reftel , post has reported on many of the specific topics inquired about over the course of [PER Preval  ] 's re-election campaign and the first year of his second term . 
We welcome the opportunity to reiterate key judgments that we believe will become increasingly important as the [PER Preval  ] administration approaches completion of its first year in office . 
In sum , we believe [PER Preval  ] 's commitment to building democratic institutions , promoting political stability , and developing the economy corresponds with our own interests . 
However , [PER Preval  ] 's weaknesses as an executive , his reflexive nationalism , and his disinterest in managing bilateral relations in a broad diplomatic sense , will lead to periodic frictions as we move forward our bilateral agenda . 
Case in point , we believe that in terms of foreign policy , [PER Preval  ] is most interested in gaining increased assistance from any available resource . 
He is likely to be tempted to frame his relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [ORG Chavez-allies  ] in the hemisphere in a way that he hopes will create a competitive atmosphere as far as who can provide the most to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Additionally , [PER Preval  ] has displayed a tendency to fixate on a particular issue at the exclusion of all others and then to move on to other issues without leaving much to show for his efforts . 
Since taking office in May 2006 , [PER Preval  ] has been the education president , the roads president , and now the anti-narcotics president . 
All of these issues are worthy of his time and attention , but require a coherent approach to policy implementation in addition to rhetoric . 
End Introduction. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The answers below are keyed to the questions in reftel: Question A ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) How Does [PER Preval  ] make policy decisions ? 
What sources of information does [PER Preval  ] draw from when making decisions and how does he process that information , e.g. is he receptive new information , does he seek advice or rely on his own intuition ? 
Does [PER Preval  ] tend to see policy issues in black and white or in shades of grey ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We judge that [PER Preval  ] largely relies on his own intuition and experience in formulating policy . 
We see that experiences from his first presidential term are nearly always a touchstone on key bilateral issues , even when circumstances have significantly changed or the conclusion he is drawing is not directly applicable to the issue at hand . 
[PER Preval  ] 's recent insistence that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not do enough to combat narcotics traffic through [LOC Haiti  ] is a clear example of an attitude carried over from his first term . 
Likewise , [PER Preval  ] 's current resistance to making a placating gesture to [LOC China  ] after the [MISC GoH  ] voiced support for [LOC Taiwan  ] at the [ORG UN  ] is based in part on [PER Preval  ] 's belief that [LOC China  ] behaved unreasonably when renewing [ORG UN  ] mission mandates during his first term. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On balance , we see that issues where [PER Preval  ] has a fixed view , for example relations with [LOC China  ] , he is remarkably resistant to policy advice . 
On other issues , where [PER Preval  ] is not so engaged either because of lack of personal interest or lack of experience , [PER Preval  ] seems readily open to new information and flexible in his approach . 
This seems most apparent in issues relating to economic policy . 
Rather than separating [PER Preval  ] 's thinking into black and white or shades of gray , we believe it is more useful to bear in mind that [PER Preval  ] often appears not to fully think through the implications or consequences of a particular issue . 
He neglects to carry out the kind of study or put in place the administrative structure required to turn an idea into workable policy . 
This was most obvious in his approach to negotiations with gang leaders , his focus throughout the PORT AU PR 00000408 002 OF 007 summer of 2006 . 
Due to a lack of results however , he abandoned the effort . 
[PER Preval  ] 's entire policy seemed to be encapsulated in the formulation , ' 'd isarm or die . 
" He never appears to have coherently addressed the issue central to the negotiations -- the future of the most violent gang-leaders . 
Question B ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Does [PER Preval  ] seek advice from a wide array of sources or only look to certain people , if so , whom and on what issues ? 
Does he trust any of his advisers or ministers to make key decisions in his stead ? 
How does he deal with dissension or criticism from his advisors ? 
What tone does he set when he meets with his advisers - e.g. , does he encourage them to work collegially , competitively , or within the formal bureaucratic structure ? 
Has [PER Bob Manuel  ] 's influence with [PER Preval  ] diminished , and if so , why ? 
Does [PER Manuel  ] continue to informally oversee the security portfolio ? 
If not , who does , is there another adviser poised to succeed [PER Manuel  ] as [PER Preval  ] 's " right-hand man . 
" ? <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] seems open to a wide array of sources -- he reportedly reads and pays attention to the media on a wide variety of subjects and maintains a broad circle of friends -- but appears to limit the number of people from whom he actively seeks advice . 
Some , most notably [PER Robert Manuel  ] , have complained that the number is growing smaller and that his fiancee , [PER Elizabeth Delatour  ] , is the only advisor with whom he has meaningful discussions . 
[PER Fritz Longchamp  ] , Secretary General of the Presidency , appears to have gained [ORG SIPDIS  ] access and influence to [PER Preval  ] regarding the dispute with [LOC China  ] . 
As a former foreign minister , [PER Longchamp  ] may also be advising on broader foreign policy issues . 
[PER Gabriel Verret  ] remains [PER Preval  ] 's closest advisor on economic issues . 
[PER Lionel Delatour  ] , [PER Elizabeth Delatour  ] 's brother-in-law , maintains somewhat regular access due to his family ties and his direct involvement with the effort to promote HOPE legislation , however [PER Delatour  ] himself has complained that [PER Preval  ] often ignores his advice . 
With a few exceptions , [PER Preval  ] appears not to trust his advisers or ministers to make key decisions , or even to implement key decisions . 
The most recent account of the council of ministers meetings provided by [PER Gabriel Verret  ] to the Ambassador describes [PER Preval  ] going through the action items of each ministry and demanding status reports. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) With the Embassy and [ORG USG  ] representatives , ministers as a group are deferential and mostly subdued in [PER Preval  ] 's presence . 
There is little air of give-and-take or willingness among ministers to extemporize . 
In meetings with [ORG USG  ] officials [PER Preval  ] has abruptly cut off Prime Minister [PER Alexis  ] on two occasions , disagreeing with his views . 
On another occasion he cut off Minister of [ORG Public Works  ] [PER Frantz Varella  ] , who had offered an observation regarding security , telling him that security was not his responsibility . 
We hear of very little , if any , substantive criticism or dissension among the cabinet in private . 
The most visible intra-cabinet dissension , so far , has been between the judiciary and security officials ; most recently , a rift between the justice minister and chief prosecutor [PER Claudy Gassant  ] . 
[PER Preval  ] has pointedly refused to intervene . 
Many among [LOC Haiti  ] 's chattering classes attribute this to a strategy on [PER Preval  ] 's part to keep members of his government divided and weak . 
We judge rather that his attitude is more in line with his overall passivity as an executive. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Having observed the [MISC Preval-Manuel  ] relationship over the past two years since [PER Manuel  ] 's return to [LOC Haiti  ] to join the [PER Preval  ] campaign , we judge that [PER Manuel  ] 's role is most accurately described as [ORG Best Friend  ] . 
[PER Manuel  ] remains [PER Preval  ] 's closest confidante , and [PER Preval  ] still uses him as his personal emissary , but the influence of [PER Manuel  ] 's own views on any given subject appear limited . 
For example , against [PER Manuel  ] 's advice and own wishes , [PER Preval  ] involved [PER Manuel  ] in his first negotiations with gang leaders in the summer of 2006 . 
With [PER Manuel  ] 's displeasure with this policy unabated , [PER Preval  ] simply cut him out of the process . 
[PER Manuel  ] appears still to be charged with the management of [PER Preval  ] 's personal security , PORT AU PR 00000408 003 OF 007 overseeing the [ORG Presidential Protection Unit  ] ( [ORG USPN  ] ) in the palace , but [PER Preval  ] himself appears to have taken complete charge of security policy . 
[PER Manuel  ] , along with the justice minister , is charged with preparing President [PER Preval  ] for the upcoming drug trafficking summit in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] on March 16 , but our contacts with [PER Manuel  ] on narcotics issues so far indicate that he does no more than to restate [PER Preval  ] 's own views , often with more passion . 
[PER Manuel  ] confided to the Ambassador that he is frustrated with [PER Preval  ] 's unwillingness to listen to him and heed advice and that he wants to leave [LOC Haiti  ] , preferably as Ambassador to [LOC Mexico  ] , but that [PER Preval  ] has been non-committal about the timing of his appointment . 
Whatever the state of their relationship on policy issues , [PER Preval  ] clearly values [PER Manuel  ] 's friendship and may be reluctant to let him go . 
Question C ---------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) What is the nature of [PER Preval  ] 's relationship with Director General of the [MISC Haitian  ] [ORG National Police  ] [PER Mario Andresol  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Jean Reynald Clerisme  ] , Secretary of State for [ORG Public Security Luc  ] [PER Eucher Joseph  ] , Secretary General of the Presidency [PER Fritz Longchamp  ] , and economic advisor [PER Gabriel Verret.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's relationship with [PER Andresol  ] does not appear to extend beyond their formal association as president and the chief of police . 
[PER Preval  ] and [PER Andresol  ] had no personal connection to speak of before [PER Preval  ] inherited and then re-appointed [PER Andresol  ] director general of the [ORG HNP  ] . 
For his part , [PER Andresol  ] has , on several occasions , expressed frustration that he has not been able to gain more trust from [PER Preval  ] . 
Likewise , [PER Preval  ] 's relationship with [PER Eucher  ] seems limited to their formal roles: [PER Eucher  ] is not otherwise a close of advisor from whom [PER Preval  ] seeks counsel . 
[PER Preval  ] and [PER Clerisme  ] have a large number of mutual acquaintances from the rural/populist movements , however they do not have a close personal bond . 
[PER Preval  ] has reportedly taken personal charge of all important foreign policy issues , leaving [PER Clerisme  ] with little influence . 
[PER Longchamp  ] is both a trusted advisor and personal friend . 
With [PER Preval  ] limiting PM [MISC Alexis'  ] direction of the cabinet , and not having named a chief of staff , the importance of [PER Longchamp  ] 's position has steadily increased . 
Finally , [PER Gabriel Verret  ] , perhaps even more than either [PER Robert Manuel  ] or [PER Longchamp  ] , is the other advisor in the palace who can claim to be both a trusted confidante and influential policy advisor , as [PER Preval  ] remains open to advice on economic matters . 
In the same way , [PER Elizabeth Delatour  ] , who is also formally charged with providing economic advice , might be the single most important influence on [PER Preval  ] . 
Question D ---------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) What are [PER Alexis  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Clerisme  ] 's perceptions of former President [PER Jean-Bertrand Aristide  ] ? <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Based on [MISC Alexis' long-standing  ] personal association with [PER Preval  ] from his previous administration through his active role in the most recent presidential campaign , we surmise that [MISC Alexis'  ] views on [PER Aristide  ] hew closely to [PER Preval  ] 's own ( i.e. that [PER Aristide  ] betrayed the [MISC Haitian  ] people ) . 
If [PER Alexis  ] believes otherwise , he gives no hint of disagreement with [PER Preval  ] . 
We are less familiar with [PER Clerisme  ] , but note that [PER Clerisme  ] 's political engagement began with his involvement as a liberation theology priest working in the rural , peasant movement in [LOC Haiti  ] 's northeast . 
Most of this movement 's leaders became disillusioned with [PER Aristide  ] during the mid-1990 's . 
Whatever [PER Clerisme  ] 's views , as with [PER Alexis  ] , to the extent they do not correspond to [PER Preval  ] 's , he keeps them to himself . 
Question E ---------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Is [PER Preval  ] influenced by ideology , and if so , what are the major influences ? 
What motivated him to return to politics ? 
What role do [MISC Catholicism  ] , voodoo , and PORT AU PR 00000408 004 OF 007 liberation-theology play in his worldview ? 
What is his full educational history and experience working in private industry ? <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] seems profoundly uninfluenced and uninterested in ideology at this stage in his life . 
Despite his involvement in radical/communist circles as a student in [LOC Belgium  ] and his entrance into [MISC Haitian  ] politics through a populist movement deeply influenced by liberation theology , [PER Preval  ] 's public and private discourse is practically devoid of any notions reflecting that background . 
In the context of the developing world , we would most accurately describe him as a neo-liberal , particularly in that he has embraced free markets and foreign investment. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) At the same time , [PER Preval  ] 's discourse regarding [MISC Haitian  ] politics remains framed in the context of his past . 
He still refers broadly to " the people " and " the bourgeois " in referring to [MISC Haitian  ] society . 
His leftist views reportedly caused a deep rift between himself and his family , particularly his father , who although opposed to [PER Duvalier  ] held traditional [MISC Haitian  ] upper-class views . 
This is as close to an insight as we may venture into his motivation to return to politics , which is something of a puzzle . 
While a canny politician and an effective campaigner [PER Preval  ] evinces little of the ambition or overt drive typical of most politicians . 
It may be simply that he rightly recognized that he was the only leader in [LOC Haiti  ] who legitimately represented the broad-based popular movement that toppled [PER Duvalier  ] and first brought [PER Aristide  ] to power. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Like most [MISC Haitians  ] , [PER Preval  ] was raised [MISC Catholic  ] with an exposure to voodoo practices . 
He is a non-observant [MISC Catholic  ] but maintains a cordial and respectful relationship with [LOC Haiti  ] 's [MISC Catholic  ] hierarchy . 
He is particularly close to [LOC Haiti  ] 's Archbishop , who was a life-long friend of his parents . 
Likewise , he maintains a respectful and cordial relationship with Voodoo leaders . 
There are unconfirmed reports that [PER Robert Manuel  ] , who is a born-again [MISC Christian  ] , influences [PER Preval  ] 's religious views and that the two regularly pray together . 
However , [PER Preval  ] has been jocular and once dismissive of [PER Manuel  ] 's praying in conversations with ambassadors. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's educational and professional experiences listed in open sources are mostly accurate . 
He studied agronomy at the University of [LOC Louvain  ] in [LOC Belgium  ] but did not receive a degree reportedly because he spent too much time participating in political activities . 
Though he obtained a position with the [ORG National Institute for Mineral Resources  ] , apparently as part of [PER Jean-Claude Duvalier  ] 's conciliatory gestures to his father 's opponents , Embassy sources do not believe he actually worked at his job . 
He went into the bakery business with several friends in the mid-1970 , including [PER Michele Pierre Louis  ] , a renowned patron of [MISC Haitian  ] arts , and through her met [PER Aristide  ] . 
[PER Preval  ] 's bakery was successful , but destroyed by associates of the military after the 1991 coup d'etat . 
Among the many incidents of conflict between the right-wing and [PER Aristide  ] supporters , [PER Preval  ] apparently holds a special grudge against those who destroyed his business . 
Question F ---------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) What is [PER Preval  ] 's relationship to [PER Geri Benoit  ] ? 
Does his sister , [PER Marie-Claude Calvin  ] , play an influential role in his administration ? 
Does [PER Elizabeth Delatour  ] yield influence over [PER Preval  ] 's political decision-making ? 
What is the status of their impending nuptials ? 
One of [PER Preval  ] 's daughters lives with him in [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] . 
Where is the other and what does she do ? <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Though [PER Preval  ] and his second wife , [PER Geri Benoit  ] , appeared together at times during the campaign , they have apparently lived entirely separate lives since his inauguration . 
Mrs. [PER Calvin  ] and [PER Preval  ] are very close . 
She was among the family members on the payroll at his agricultural foundation in Marmalade , which was funded by PORT AU PR 00000408 005 OF 007 [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
[PER Calvin  ] acts as his scheduler , keeps an office in the palace , and one ambassador reports that [PER Calvin  ] kept him at bay for several days when he had an urgent request to see [PER Preval  ] . 
[PER Calvin  ] and her husband also accompanied [PER Preval  ] on his second trip to [LOC Cuba  ] for medical attention . 
Mrs. [PER Calvin  ] does not appear to play any role in influencing government policy. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) It is difficult to assess [PER Elizabeth Delatour  ] 's influence on policy . 
She is extremely private and reserved and does not generally engage foreign officials in substantive conversation . 
She politely resisted the Ambassador 's attempts to establish a more social relationship . 
Numerous people close to [PER Preval  ] complain that [PER Preval  ] has neglected both his work and limited the input of other advisors in favor of [PER Delatour  ] . 
During the critical juncture over the dispute with [LOC China  ] regarding the renewal of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's mandate , [PER Delatour  ] appeared to play a central role . 
[PER SRSG Mulet  ] chose [PER Delatour  ] as his contact when he argued that the GoH must provide [LOC China  ] some kind of written apology: [PER Preval  ] ultimately grudgingly signed a letter . 
[PER Delatour  ] called the Ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] when she was in the Department for consultations asking for an update on the [MISC Chinese  ] delegation 's position in [LOC New York  ] . 
[PER Preval  ] 's wedding plans remain perhaps the best kept secret in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
We have confirmed from multiple reliable sources that they are formally engaged , but no further reliable news regarding wedding plans has emerged . 
Factors that might be complicating their plans include [PER Preval  ] 's health and living arrangements for [PER Delatour  ] 's 11-year old son. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's older daughter , [PER Dominique  ] , lives with her mother in [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] and runs a stationery store above her mother 's book store . 
She is close to both her parents . 
[PER Preval  ] 's younger daughter , [PER Patricia  ] , is currently in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] studying [MISC Asian  ] art . 
Question G ---------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) How much importance does [PER Preval  ] place on maintaining close bilateral relations with the [LOC United States  ] ? 
Are there aspects of the relationship he values more than others ? 
Does he view it as a mutually beneficial relationship ? 
Does he see [LOC Haiti  ] as having obligations or responsibilities to the [LOC U.S.  ] ? 
How does he view the U.S.' previous involvement in [LOC Haiti  ] ? 
What is [PER Preval  ] 's relationship with the [MISC Haitian  ] Diaspora ? <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] recognizes that the [LOC U.S.  ] is [LOC Haiti  ] 's most important bilateral partner and that [LOC Haiti  ] 's closest societal links internationally are with the [LOC U.S.  ] His priority on the bilateral agenda is to leverage and extract the most assistance for [LOC Haiti  ] on his own terms and to tap into the wealth and resources of the [MISC Haitian-American  ] community in the [LOC U.S.  ] As the president of a small , poor nation in the shadow of the [MISC American  ] behemoth , he clearly believes that the [LOC U.S.  ] has far greater obligations to [LOC Haiti  ] than the other way around , if , in fact , [LOC Haiti  ] has any obligations at all . 
[PER Preval  ] numbers a few close friends in the diaspora of whom we know . 
He established a friendship with [PER Dumarsais Simeus  ] during the presidential campaign , and they stay in contact by email . 
For the most part , however , [PER Preval  ] does not seem closely connected to or interested in [MISC Haitian  ] communities abroad . 
He has indicated on a number of occasions that he fears that pro-Aristide extremists exert excessive influence in diaspora communities . 
Question H ---------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Are cabinet officials involved in any illicit activities ? 
How does [PER Preval  ] handle corruption within his administration ? <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) There has been little indication that cabinet members have been involved in illicit activities so far . 
At the time of the cabinet 's formation , observers noted that the ministers had been mostly free of suspicion over the course PORT AU PR 00000408 006 OF 007 of their careers . 
Indications regarding [PER Preval  ] 's own attitude toward corruption are mixed . 
During his first term , [PER Preval  ] either tolerated or was forced to accept gross abuses on the part of close associates of [PER Aristide  ] . 
In either case , [PER Preval  ] has exhibited a non-confrontational approach with passivity toward difficult issues as the hallmark of his political career . 
[PER Preval  ] maintains a reputation for personal honesty . 
Question I ---------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) How has [PER Preval  ] handled domestic criticism thus far ? 
Does he have a public communications or publicity strategy or manager ? 
How does he perform under significant stress ? 
How does he respond to confrontation , either personally or indirectly , e.g. mass unrest ? <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] has been remarkably impervious and unresponsive to domestic criticism thus far , which mostly centers on his approach to security and the gang activity during the fall of 2006 , when kidnapping and crime spiked upward . 
There have been no significant incidents of mass unrest since his inauguration on which to judge his reaction . 
Based on his intense involvement in the daily review of security policy , we surmise that he pays close attention to public opinion , even if remaining uncommunicative himself . 
He has a palace spokesman in name , [PER Assad Volce  ] but hardly uses him . 
Nor does he use the minister for communication , who is traditionally the government 's chief spokesperson . 
Regarding his public relations strategy , he has said on several occasions , that he wants to change the tradition of [LOC Haiti  ] 's presidents being the center of attention who make promises that they are unable to deliver . 
" I will talk when I have some accomplishments to talk about . 
" Question J ---------- <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) What is the status of [PER Preval  ] 's [ORG Lespwa  ] coalition ? 
Is it a cohesive coalition or is it fractured ? 
Do its members regard [PER Preval  ] as their leader ? 
What is [PER Preval  ] 's relationship to [PER Fanmi Lavalas  ] ( [LOC FL  ] ) ? <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] has removed himself from involvement in [ORG Lespwa  ] and undertakes little visible role in managing relations with the parliament . 
[ORG Lespwa  ] is directionless as a party . 
Though , in the general , [ORG Lespwa  ] 's drift does not particularly stand out in the incohesive atmosphere of [LOC Haiti  ] 's parliament . 
[ORG Senate  ] President [PER Joseph Lambert  ] , has emerged as a leader among [ORG Lespwa  ] parliamentarians , but devotes more of his energy to cultivating his image as parliament 's chief , rather than simply a party leader . 
No other [ORG Lespwa  ] parliamentarian has demonstrated a capacity to take direction of the party . 
[ORG Lespwa  ] parliamentarians no longer regard [PER Preval  ] as their party leader , but recognizing he remains the country 's most popular politician and still associated with [ORG Lespwa  ] in the public 's mind , they do not generally criticize him in public or in private . 
[PER Preval  ] has virtually no contact with any of the various [LOC FL  ] factions . 
Question K ---------- <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) How long are [PER Preval  ] 's workdays ? 
How many breaks does he take during his workday , what does he do during them and how long do they last ? 
Under what circumstances ? <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] appears to be keeping an increasingly busy schedule , working longer hours and seeing more visitors . 
The Ambassador has taken phone calls from him as early as 6:30 am and has had meetings as late as 6:30 pm . 
[PER Preval  ] told the Ambassador recently that he has for many years taken a full , in-pajamas 2-3 hour nap every afternoon , allowing him to maintain his energy . 
Question L ---------- PORT AU PR 00000408 007 OF 007 <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) What family history of alcohol or substance use does [PER Preval  ] have ? 
What alcohol or drugs has he been observed using , how much , and under what circumstances ? 
Any related problems ? 
Has [PER Preval  ] ever been observed to be high or drunk , disoriented , trembling or physically jittery , or had memory lapses ? 
How many drinks can [PER Preval  ] consume before he shows signs of inebriation ? 
Does [PER Preval  ] take any medications ? <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Preval  ] 's parents both lived well into their eighties . 
His father , in particular , reportedly enjoyed robust health . 
No one in his immediate family has or had a reputation for alcohol abuse . 
[PER Preval  ] drinks whiskey and smokes in public , including at Embassy functions , but we have not observed him inebriated nor seen him take more than one or two drinks . 
Rumors abound about his deteriorating physical condition -- intense physical pain , high dosages of medication , however ; we have no credible first-hand reports to confirm this . 
In our meetings [PER Preval  ] has always been completely lucid and has never appeared to be in any great pain . 
Special intelligence indicates that he began taking medication after the most recent round of medical examinations in [LOC Cuba  ] that indicated a possibility of the return of prostate cancer .
