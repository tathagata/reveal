Classified By: Acting DCM [PER Marie Damour  ] , reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , President [PER Lula  ] 's choice to succeed him as president in January 2011 , cast doubt over her viability as a presidential candidate when doctors discovered in March that she has lymphatic cancer . 
Observers say the [ORG Presidential Palace  ] is being transparent about her condition and she will be able to run for president next year . 
With no good alternative [ORG PT  ] candidate in sight , the [ORG PT  ] stands to lose the election should [PER Rousseff  ] withdraw . 
Some believe her illness provides an opening for President [PER Lula  ] to seek a third consecutive term , despite his repeated avowals not to . 
[PER Dilma  ] looks well and if she can continue to look like a fighter and winner , it could help her win the election in October 2010 . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , minister-chief of the civilian household and President [PER Lula  ] 's top aide on domestic policy , was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer in March . 
Her doctors stated that her cancer was caught early and she has a 90 percent chance of a full recovery . 
She had lymph nodes under her left arm removed and began what was originally scheduled as a four month program of chemotherapy in April . 
In late May , she was briefly hospitalized on an emergency basis with pain in her legs , which was later attributed to an abrupt cessation of medication associated with the chemotherapy . 
Doctors said in the future she will taper off those drugs to avoid a recurrence . 
In the meantime , [PER Rousseff  ] said she would cut back on her schedule . 
By early June she had completed three chemotherapy sessions . 
In a June 18 meeting with a [LOC Washington  ] visitor ( septel ) , [PER Rousseff  ] looked well with good natural color and light make-up , and a top aide told the Ambassador that [PER Rousseff  ] was responding so well to chemotherapy that her sessions would be reduced from six to four , ending in late [LOC June.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Journalists , analysts , and politicians tend to agree that the [ORG Presidential Palace  ] is not hiding information related to her illness and is trying to be as transparent as possible but might be overly optimistic about her prognosis . 
Still , her illness has provoked speculation about who might replace her as the [ORG Workers' Party  ] candidate in 2010 should she be too sick to run. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Tiao Viana  ] ( [ORG PT  ] , of [ORG Acre  ] ) , who is a physician , told poloff on June 9 that [PER Dilma  ] 's illness is exactly what the [ORG GOB  ] says it is: a case of lymphatic cancer caught early with a 90 percent chance of being fully cured . 
[PER Viana  ] also said that when her chemotherapy program is finished she should be considered cancer-free for five years . 
She will be able to campaign without restriction and should be fit enough for all the exertions that a national campaign will require , he said . 
Possible scenarios <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Several possible scenarios could emerge from [PER Dilma  ] 's cancer . 
In one scenario , she and the [ORG PT  ] inner circle might already know that she is much sicker than publicly revealed and too sick to be the candidate . 
In another , she might be well enough now to become the candidate but later be weakened by the illness and unable to campaign effectively . 
Another scenario , in harmony with the public statements by the [ORG GOB  ] and [PER Rousseff  ] 's doctors , is that she will respond well to chemotherapy and her cancer can be considered cured , or at least in remission. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The first scenario seems less likely , since the [ORG PT  ] gains no advantage by waiting to select and groom another candidate only 14 months before the election . 
In the absence of another strong contender , the longer the party waits to put forth another candidate , the harder it becomes to build him or her up and gain national name recognition . 
If [PER Rousseff  ] were too sick to run successfully , [PER Lula  ] and his inner circle would quickly move to put forth a viable alternative , although [ORG PT  ] choices may be limited . 
Without an alternative within the [ORG PT  ] , [PER Lula  ] would choose to delay replacing [PER Rousseff  ] if her recovery is slower than expected. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The second scenario poses the greatest danger to the [ORG PT  ] 's desire to retain the presidency , and if chemotherapy is successful this scenario will not occur . 
But given the estimates that [PER Rousseff  ] 's lymphoma has a 90 percent chance of being cured now , there is still a ten percent chance that [PER Rousseff  ] will face this scenario , and it would probably mean the loss of the presidency for the [ORG Workers' Party  ] in 2010 . 
Nonetheless , [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG PT  ] may be choosing to believe the most optimistic prognosis when the reality could be a range of possibilities , with the 90/10 prognosis at the sunny end. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The third scenario seems the most likely . 
Again , using the medical estimates , assuming the doctors are both correct and honest in their public statements , there is a 90% chance the cancer will be cured and [PER Rousseff  ] will be physically able to mount a strong campaign . 
Some analysts have noted that a " victory " over cancer will play in her favor and foster an image of her as a fighter and winner . 
Conversely , if she looks weak and defeated next year , voter support will flag . 
On June 18 , poloff spoke with [PER Paulo Delgado  ] , a former five-term federal deputy for the [ORG PT  ] ( 1987-2007 ) , now a political consultant with the [ORG Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) and a monthly guest columnist for national daily [ORG O Globo  ] . 
He suspects the presidential palace is uncertain about her condition but hopes she will be well enough to go the distance . 
[PER Rousseff  ] will have plenty of time to recover from the effects of chemotherapy before the October 2010 elections . 
In the wings <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) What if [PER Rousseff  ] is no longer a viable candidate ? 
Senator [PER Viana  ] said the most likely alternatives are Federal Deputy [PER Antonio Palocci  ] , the former finance minister who resigned in a scandal , and [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] , the president 's chief of staff . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] is to decide this month whether to allow federal prosecutors to bring a case against [PER Palocci  ] in the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
In this case , he would not be a viable candidate unless acquitted after trial , which could take a long time . 
[PER Carvalho  ] is not nationally known , and the [ORG PT  ] would face an uphill battle to build name recognition . 
In his current portfolio he lacks a vehicle to put him before the public , unlike [PER Rousseff  ] , who as the " mother of the [ORG PAC  ] , " ( the Accelerated [ORG Growth Program  ] , a massive public works program ) is regularly seen in a leading role at public works inaugurations . 
Other than [PER Carvalho  ] and [PER Palocci  ] , there are no obvious alternatives from within the [ORG Workers' Party  ] . 
Although there are five governors from the [ORG PT  ] , none is now widely viewed as presidential material , and [ORG PT  ] members of congress would all be very dark horses starting from the back of the pack . 
Occasionally the name of [PER Patrus Ananias  ] , the minister for [ORG Social Development  ] and the Combat against Hunger , is mentioned . 
Like [PER Carvalho  ] , he is not well-known , but has the advantage of administering the [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] ( Family Stipend ) program , the flagship social program of the [PER Lula  ] administration with national name recognition . 
Governor [PER Neves  ] to the rescue ? <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The wild card in everyone 's calculations is Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] , opposition ) , of [ORG Minas Gerais  ] . 
Speculation about [PER Neves  ] 's presidential ambitions has long been rife , often focusing on a possible switch to the [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  ] ( [ORG PMDB  ] , a non-ideological party in the government coalition ) . 
[PER Delgado  ] said another scenario is more likely: should [PER Rousseff  ] not be able to run , [PER Neves  ] could move to the [ORG Brazilian Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSB  ] ) or the [ORG Green Party  ] ( [ORG PV  ] ) and run with the support of the [ORG Workers' Party  ] . 
[PER Neves  ] has been careful to maintain good relations with [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG PT  ] , and [ORG PT  ] support for his candidacy is plausible , especially to beat [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) , who now has an edge over all other possible candidates in early polls . 
However , there is also speculation that [PER Neves  ] has an arrangement with [PER Serra  ] to support [PER Serra  ] 's candidacy in 2010 in return for becoming [PER Serra  ] 's choice as his successor . 
If [PER Neves  ] is to run for president for a different party , he must resign from the governorship by early October because he cannot switch parties less than a year before the election , and were he to switch without resigning , the [ORG PSDB  ] would sue to reclaim the governor 's seat and remove him office . 
President [PER Lula  ] to the rescue ? <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) There is always speculation about a third consecutive term for [PER Lula  ] , which would require a constitutional amendment . 
President [PER Lula  ] has repeatedly ( and convincingly ) stated publicly that he is against it . 
Nonetheless , there is considerable mistrust of [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG PT  ] on this subject , even among allied parties . 
Federal Deputy [PER George Hilton  ] ( [ORG Progressive Party  ] - [ORG PP  ] , of [ORG Minas Gerais  ] ) told poloff on June 17 that he believes [PER Rousseff  ] 's illness could be worse than publicly admitted but the [ORG Presidential Palace  ] and/or the [ORG PT  ] are maintaining her candidacy so that later this year they could drop her and , with no alternative in sight , force [PER Lula  ] to change his mind , let [ORG Congress  ] amend the [MISC Constitution  ] , and have him run for a third term . 
( Comment: This scenario is highly implausible , but this and similar lines of thinking will always find followers among those who do not trust [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG PT  ] . 
End comment . 
) [PER Delgado  ] pointed out that [PER Lula  ] has never categorically closed the door to running for a third term and one should not rule out such a turn of events. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment . 
When [PER Rousseff  ] 's illness was first made public , the [PER Lula  ] government rushed to give optimistic predictions for [PER Rousseff  ] 's health when it was too early for a reliable prognosis . 
This indicates some wishful thinking on the part of [PER Lula  ] and top government figures . 
[PER Rousseff  ] 's illness has also exposed a vulnerability in the [ORG PT  ] that it did not have only a few years ago , when it could point to several star-power governors and congressmen . 
Those stars for one reasons or another have now faded , and the party has adopted [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , the choice of [PER Lula  ] , its senior leader , for better , for worse , in sickness and in health . 
If she is sicker than publicly stated , and cannot effectively campaign and be elected [PER Lula  ] 's successor , [PER Lula  ] is making a colossal gamble that will be increasingly harder to unmake as time passes . 
But by all appearances , [PER Dilma  ] is doing well , and a winning and healthy appearance could help her to close the gap in polls with [PER Serra  ] and contest the election in October 2010 .
