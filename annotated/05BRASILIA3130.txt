[LOC BRASILIA  ] 1522 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Patrick Linehan  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] enjoys a close relationship with [LOC Cuba  ] and the [ORG GoB  ] has refused to criticize directly the [LOC Castro  ] regime 's human rights policies . 
In a rare public statement on [LOC Cuba  ] in April 2005 , President [PER Lula  ] implied criticism of [LOC Castro  ] when he told the press that " [LOC Brazil  ] can help build a democratic process in [LOC Cuba  ] " and that " we have much to do for democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" The [ORG Lula Administration  ] argues that engagement , rather than isolation , is more likely to change [LOC Cuba  ] 's behavior ; it states it has been critical of the [LOC Castro  ] regime 's actions behind the scenes . 
The [ORG GoB  ] , however , has a general aversion to meddling in the internal affairs of other countries and routinely opposes " single country " resolutions at the [ORG United Nations  ] , including those aimed at [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] media and [ORG NGOs  ] are much less hesitant to criticize the [LOC Castro  ] regime pointedly. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the past , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] has pushed unsuccessfully to allow [LOC Cuba  ] entry into the [ORG Rio Group  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) , some key members of which sought refuge in [LOC Cuba  ] from persecution during [LOC Brazil  ] 's military dictatorship , allegedly received from the [MISC Cuban  ] government a campaign contribution ( ranging from [MISC US$1.4  ] to [MISC US$3  ] million ) during the 2002 presidential elections . 
Beyond allegations made in the media by various self-described witnesses to the transaction , thus far no concrete evidence of such payment has emerged. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the economic front , the [ORG GoB  ] has welcomed contacts between [LOC Cuba  ] and the [ORG Mercosul  ] common market , of which [LOC Brazil  ] is the largest member . 
[LOC Brazil  ] supports [ORG Mercosul  ] 's plans to conclude a trade pact with [LOC Cuba  ] , although it appears the island 's relationship with [ORG Mercosul  ] would fall short of full membership . 
Bilateral [MISC Brazilian  ] trade with [LOC Cuba  ] grew to [MISC US$177.2  ] million in 2004 , over $91.8 million in 2003 . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] exports of [MISC US$131.9  ] million in 2004 to [LOC Cuba  ] consisted primarily of chicken , shoes , agricultural machinery and buses . 
2004 imports from [LOC Cuba  ] of [LOC US$22.3  ] million were dominated by medicines and vaccines . 
Over the period 2001-2003 , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Development Bank  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) provided [MISC US$52.3  ] million in export credits to finance the export of automobiles and buses to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Local accounts suggest that potential [ORG BNDES  ] export credits for [LOC Cuba  ] are under-utilized. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There has been a trickle of [MISC Brazilian  ] investment to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
According to [ORG Central Bank  ] data , [MISC Brazilian  ] companies held investments valued at [MISC US$19  ] million in [LOC Cuba  ] in 2004 . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] holds rights to an offshore oil exploration block , the potential of which it is evaluating . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] formed in 2004 a lubricants joint venture in [LOC Cuba  ] with [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG PDVSA  ] and a local partner . 
( [MISC Note:  ] local media accounts suggest that differences over ownership and controlling interests have delayed this investment , as [MISC Cuban  ] law reportedly limits foreign ownership to 49% of joint ventures .
