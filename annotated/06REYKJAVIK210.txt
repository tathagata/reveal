End summary. ----------------------- We have the envelope... ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The leaders of [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) and [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) coalition government announced June 10 their decisions regarding a cabinet reshuffle . 
Prime Minister [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] 's and Foreign Minister Geir [PER Haarde  ] joint statement culminated a week of intense intra- governmental lobbying and media and civil service speculation about potential fall-out from [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's June 5 resignation announcement ( reftel ) . 
On June 15 FM [PER Haarde  ] will become the new Prime Minister , while [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) will become the Republic 's first female Minister for Foreign Affairs . 
The [MISC IP  ] gives up one ministerial seat -- the [ORG Ministry for the Environment  ] -- to the [ORG PP  ] , thus reverting to the original coalition agreement forged after 2003 parliamentary elections regarding equal division of ministries between the two parties. ---------------------- And the winners are... ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As of June 15 the [MISC Icelandic  ] Ministerial line-up will be as follows: Prime Minister--Geir [PER H. Haarde  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) Foreign Minister-- [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) Minister of [ORG Finance--Arni M. Mathiesen  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) Minister of [PER Justice--Bjorn Bjarnason  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) Minister of [PER Agriculture--Gudni Agustsson  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) Minister of [PER Communications--Sturla Bodvarsson  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) Minister of [ORG Fisheries--Einar  ] [PER Kristinn Gudfinnson  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) Minister for the [ORG Environment  ] and [ORG Nordic Cooperation-Jonina Bjartmarz  ] ( [ORG PP  ] and first-time minister ) Minister of Industry and [PER Commerce--Jon Sigurdsson  ] ( [ORG PP  ] and first-time minister ) Minister of Health and Social [PER Security--Siv Fridleifsdottir  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) Minister of Social [PER Affairs--Magnus Stefansson  ] ( [ORG PP  ] and first- time minister ) Minister of Education , Science and [PER Culture--Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sverrisdottir  ] has been a member of parliament since 1987 ( and alternate member 1984-1987 ) ; and Minister of Industry and Commerce since 1999 , as well as Minister for [ORG Nordic Co-operation  ] 2004-2005 . 
As Minister she has been a tireless advocate for [LOC Iceland  ] 's increased industrialization . 
Among government bureaucrats she has established a solid reputation for being serious , hardworking , competent , and committed to the government 's highly successful economic liberalization process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In the face of vocal opposition from environmentalists [PER Sverrisdottir  ] has strongly backed efforts by [ORG Alcoa  ] and [ORG Century Aluminum  ] of the [LOC U.S.  ] to establish and expand their production facilities in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Her strong advocacy for the aluminum projects has slowly eroded her popularity , and in a recent [MISC Gallup  ] poll she ranked only seventh of the 12 ministers in popularity . 
Protesters at a march organized by environmentalists for municipal election day , May 27 , carried signs that read , " Drown Valgerdur - Not the Highlands . 
" [PER Sverrisdottir  ] later filed a police complaint alleging that the slogans amounted to an incitement of violence against herself and her three daughters. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As Minister of Industry and Commerce [PER Sverrisdottir  ] dabbled little in foreign affairs - and aside from language studies she has no relevant academic background for the job . 
She speaks halting , though passable , [MISC English  ] . 
Perhaps because she lacks confidence as a diplomat , or perhaps as part of an inter-party deal that won her the prestigious post , [PER Sverrisdottir  ] announced June 11 that she would leave defense negotiations to [PER Haarde  ] . 
She also disavowed any interest in the [ORG PP  ] chairmanship. -------------- [ORG NATO  ] SYG Visit -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] is scheduled to meet June 15 with high-level [MISC Icelandic  ] officials , to include [PER Sverrisdottir  ] and [PER Haarde  ] . 
While [PER Sverrisdottir  ] will presumably have her hands full just coming to grips with an unfamiliar portfolio , [PER Haarde  ] will doubtless use the meeting to press for Alliance support for a " robust and visible " defense for [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The choice of [PER Sverrisdottir  ] , while unforeseen by pundits ( who favored [MISC IP  ] stalwarts more experienced in foreign affairs ) , is win-win-win for the Progressives: -- They will control the country 's second most powerful ministry and the patronage that comes with it ( not insignificant for a party struggling to hold on to membership ) . 
-- By making the argument that continuity is important , they leave the loser ( as it now appears from a [ORG GOI  ] perspective ) defense portfolio to [PER Haarde  ] and the [MISC IP  ] . 
-- After an era in which [PER Asgrimsson  ] was seen as promoting loyal young men over more qualified women , the [ORG PP  ] will now get the credit for finally breaking through the socially conservative MFA 's glass ceiling . 
In terms of [LOC U.S.  ] interests , this appointment is also a boon , as in her performance at [LOC Commerce  ] and Industry [PER Sverrisdottir  ] has demonstrated sympathy for [MISC U.S.-Icelandic  ] business interests and vision in advancing them .
