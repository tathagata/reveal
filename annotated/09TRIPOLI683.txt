After listening attentively , [PER Kusa  ] responded that [PER Megrahi  ] would be met at the airport only by his family in a low-profile manner . 
Charge emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] was concerned not only with [PER Megrahi  ] 's reception today but the way he would be treated in [LOC Libya  ] today , tomorrow , and for the rest of his life . 
Charge underscored that we are asking the [MISC Libyan  ] Government to enforce the terms of [PER Megrahi  ] 's life sentence by ensuring that he remain in prison or under house arrest . 
[PER Kusa  ] , who raised his eyebrows at this point and did not look happy when it was repeated , responded that this was not part of the [MISC Scottish  ] decision but that he " would see about it . 
" [PER Kusa  ] agreed that the issue of [PER Megrahi  ] 's return was very serious for the bilateral relationship and that both sides should work to ensure that it did not jeopardize the progress made thus far . 
3 . 
( C ) Separately , [LOC UK  ] Ambassador to [LOC Libya  ] [PER Vicent Fean  ] told Charge August 20 that a team of at least three [MISC Libyan  ] officials - MFA A/S-equivalent for [ORG European Affairs Obeidi  ] , [PER Qadhafi  ] 's translator and personal aide [PER Fuad Zlitny  ] , and [LOC Libya  ] 's Charge d'Affaires in [LOC London  ] - was in [LOC Scotland  ] preparing for [PER Megrahi  ] 's return to [LOC Libya  ] .

[PER Fean  ] noted that FM [PER David Miliband  ] planned to call [PER Kusa  ] with a similar message . 
4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [PER Kusa  ] took time for this meeting out of what appeared to be a very busy day , receiving us in the Prime Minister 's office and bumping us ahead of a gaggle of waiting officials . 
He seemed to take our message seriously , and nodded in agreement with the points about the importance of this issue to the bilateral relationship . 
In our view , [PER Kusa  ] genuinely understands and appreciates the sensitivity and importance of this issue , but [PER Qadhafi  ] will be the ultimate decision maker on [PER Megrahi  ] 's role in [LOC Libya  ] after his return . 
We continue to monitor the situation .
