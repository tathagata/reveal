( C ) Summary: Long rumored to be considering a cabinet re-shuffle , PM [PER Erdogan  ] has made his first move suddenly and in limited fashion . 
However , more ministers in a cabinet which is still dominated by people loyal to [PER Erdogan  ] 's chief internal rival [PER FonMin Gul  ] may be in [PER Erdogan  ] 's sights as he tries slowly but surely to whittle down [PER Gul  ] 's influence . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a trademark sudden move , PM [PER Erdogan  ] announced the replacement of three ministers in a mini-Cabinet shuffle June 4 . 
Cabinet changes have been an intense subject of debate and waiting-for-Godot expectation in ruling [ORG AKP  ] since [PER Erdogan  ] inherited the Cabinet from his internal arch-rival [PER Abdullah Gul  ] , now [PER FonMin  ] , in March 2003 . 
Yet despite the heavy [PER Gul  ] influence ( until this shuffle [PER Erdogan  ] could depend on only four of 22 ministers for internal political support ) and despite his overriding popular support , [PER Erdogan  ] long appeared intimidated from making any changes . 
When Minister of [ORG Culture and Tourism  ] [PER Erkan Mumcu  ] resigned in Feb. 2005 , [PER Erdogan  ] remained in thrall to [PER Gul  ] for the abortive choice of current State Minister [PER Besir Atalay  ] and eventual choice of [PER Atilla Koc  ] to replace [PER Mumcu.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Now [PER Erdogan  ] appears to have overcome his indecision , spurred in part by what Minister of Energy [PER Hilmi Guler  ] told a close contact of ours June 6 is [PER Erdogan  ] 's realization of how much damage to his policies [PER Gul  ] and his circle are wreaking . 
Finally dismissed are three prominent incompetents: Minister of [ORG Agriculture  ] [PER Sami Guclu  ] , a barrier to progress on issues of concern to the [LOC U.S.  ] and a [PER Gul  ] ally ; Minister of [ORG Public Works  ] [PER Zeki Ergezen  ] , infamous for his scornful remarks about “infidels” ( gavurlar ) , surrounded by rumors of corruption , unable to finish [PER Erdogan  ] 's 15,000 kilometer divided highway project on time , an ally of Minister of the Interior [PER Abdulkadir Aksu  ] , and reportedly close to [PER Gul  ] ; and State Minister for Women 's Affairs [PER Guldal Aksit  ] , daughter of [PER Galip Demirel  ] , a prominent follower of controversial [MISC Islamist  ] sage [PER Fethullah Gulen  ] and a close associate of [LOC Aksu.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Erdogan  ] appointed as Minister of [ORG Agriculture Mehmet Mehdi  ] 1 ) , a [ORG Diyarbakir MP  ] from a prominent local family with high status in the [MISC Naksibendi  ] brotherhood . 
Born in Bismil ( [LOC Diyarbakir  ] province ) 1956 ; graduate of [LOC Ankara  ] U. veterinary faculty , [LOC MA  ] in agricultural economics from [LOC Aberdeen U  ] , PhD from [LOC Ankara  ] U . 
's health sciences institute . 
Veterinarian . 
Worked in upper-mid-level positions in the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] and as director of veterinary affairs in the [LOC Greater Istanbul Municipality  ] when [PER Erdogan  ] was mayor . 
Married , three children . 
Speaks [MISC English  ] , but we haven't yet tested his level. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) An [ORG AKP  ] xxxxx and two other long-term Embassy contacts with deep relations in [ORG AKP  ] describe [PER Eker  ] as a decent but passive man , close to [PER Erdogan  ] . 
These contacts and Minister of Energy have described in detail how [PER Eker  ] was deeply involved in a plan to remove former Minister [PER Guclu  ] by concealing from him a [MISC Russian  ] government note threatening six months ago to suspend imports of [MISC Turkish  ] fruits and vegetables for phytosanitary reasons ; the ban recently went into effect with [PER Guclu  ] looking ineffectual and uninformed . 
Embassy Ag Counselor 's contacts note that [PER Eker  ] is unlikely to be able to override the [ORG Ministry  ] 's entrenched , protectionist bureaucracy. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [PER U  ] ) The new Minister of [ORG Public Works  ] is [ORG Trabzon MP  ] [PER Faruk Nafiz  ] 2 ) ( umlaut over the [ORG O  ] ) . 
Born [LOC Trabzon  ] 1946 . 
Civil engineering degree from [LOC Karadeniz  ] technical University in [LOC Trabzon  ] . 
Senior civil engineer . 
Former captain of premier league [ORG Trabzonspor  ] football team . 
Chairman of the board of [LOC YAPISUN  ] construction company . 
Chairman of the board of [ORG Trabzonspor  ] . 
A founder of the [LOC Trabzon  ] development Foundation . 
Married , two children . 
Reportedly speaks [MISC English.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A fellow [LOC Trabzon  ] contractor and [ORG Trabzonspor  ] board member describes [PER Ozak  ] as coming from the [PER Sufi  ] ( mystical ) line of the [MISC Milli Gorus  ] [MISC Islamist  ] movement ; he is a quiet , reserved , obedient [PER Erdogan  ] man . 
As part of [PER Erdogan  ] 's strategy to use sports to maintain [ORG AKP  ] 's grassroots support , and in the wake of [ORG AKP  ] 's defeat in the [LOC Trabzon  ] mayoral race in March 2004 , the [ORG Istanbul-Black Sea  ] axis which forms [PER Erdogan  ] 's [LOC Istanbul  ] power base reportedly subsequently succeeded in having [PER Ozak  ] appointed [ORG Trabzonspor  ] chairman of the board . 
At the same time [PER Erdogan  ] reportedly agreed to transfer several million dollars from one of the [ORG Prime Ministry  ] 's hidden reserves to permit [ORG Trabzonspor  ] under [PER Ozak  ] to purchase better players . 
Our contacts expect [PER Ozak  ] to be relatively more upright than [PER Ergezen  ] was ( not a high bar ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [LOC Istanbul  ] Second District [ORG MP Nimet  ] 3 ) is the new State Minister for Women 's Affairs . 
Born Ayranci ( [LOC Ankara  ] ) 1965 . 
Grew up in relatively well-to-do circumstances with a family summer home on [LOC Heybeliada  ] , one of the [LOC Princes' Islands  ] off [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
Law degree from [LOC Istanbul  ] U. law faculty . 
Worked as an independent attorney , most recently representing the [MISC Islamist  ] businessmen 's association [ORG MUSIAD  ] . 
A founding member of [ORG AKP  ] . 
Married , one child. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Cubukcu  ] is focused , highly ambitious , and months ago made clear to us she sought the state minister position . 
She has ensured that she stays close to [PER Erdogan  ] 's wife [PER Emine  ] , which appears to have been a major factor in her selection , according to what party deputy chairman [PER Saban Disli  ] told us June 7 . 
Her businesslike approach and relative openness in private about problems in [ORG AKP  ] brought her to our attention early in [ORG AKP  ] 's tenure ; she participated in Embassy 's [ORG NATO  ] tour for MPs in Feb. 2004 and in the [MISC NDI-sponsored  ] democracy commission trip to [LOC Washington  ] in Spring 2005 . 
Responding to the bitter complaints of many women from [ORG AKP  ] 's grassroots in the northeast [LOC Black Sea  ] region who have seen their husbands take [MISC Russian  ] and other [MISC Black Sea-littoral  ] women as second wives , [PER Cubukcu  ] vigorously argued for criminalization of adultery during a controversy over adultery in autumn 2004 . 
On the other hand , although she talks about her son , she rarely mentions her husband and there are persistent questions among some observers of [ORG AKP  ] about her attitude toward her own marriage. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) With the dismissal of [PER Guclu  ] and these appointments [PER Erdogan  ] has shown more clearly that he intends to whittle down [PER Gul  ] 's influence . 
By dismissing [PER Aksit  ] and [ORG Ergezen  ] and appointing [PER Eker  ] , whose family status in [LOC Diyarbakir  ] makes him a powerful rival to Interior Minister [PER Aksu  ] , [PER Erdogan  ] has also drawn the noose around [PER Aksu  ] . 
[PER Aksu  ] has most recently served [PER Erdogan  ] 's purposes by dismissing [PER Hanefi Avci  ] , an leading Gulenist who as [ORG National Police  ] ( [ORG TNP  ] ) department head for organized crime was starting to push corruption investigations that were leading to the heart of [ORG AKP  ] . 
However , [PER Erdogan  ] has long been troubled by [PER Aksu  ] , whom he suspects of being ready to bolt from [ORG AKP  ] with a number of disgruntled MPs . 
[PER Aksu  ] 's [MISC Kurdish  ] favoritism , reported ties to the heroin trade , well-known predilection for teenage girls , and his son 's open Mafia links make him a weak link in the Cabinet , one [PER Erdogan  ] knows the core institutions of the [MISC Turkish  ] State could exploit at any time. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Contacts such as [ORG Prime Ministry  ] advisor xxxxx who has provided a wealth of accurate insights into [ORG AKP  ] , foresee a high possibility that [PER Erdogan  ] will continue to shuffle his cabinet in stages . 
In addition to [PER Aksu  ] , those who appear to be most in his sights are Minister of Labor [PER Murat Basesgioglu  ] , a former ANAPer who has a poor record of responding to [ORG AKP  ] MPs' queries and requests ; Minister of Trade and Industry [PER Ali Coskun  ] , who appears to be deeply implicated in a major corruption scandal at the [ORG Turkish Standards Institute  ] ( [ORG TSE  ] ) – involving payoffs of $500 million for certifications , according to the [ORG TSE  ] director 's statement in the June 7 press ; and State Minister for Foreign Trade [PER Kursad Tuzmen  ] , a former ( ultra-nationalist ) MHPer who was implicated in the [LOC Iraq  ] oil for food payoffs and is described by multiple contacts as open to every type of kickback. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] may also be aiming over time to remove [PER Gul  ] 's close associate State Minister [PER Atalay  ] and Minister of [LOC Justice  ] and government spokesman [PER Cemil Cicek  ] , who has not bothered to hide his prime ministerial and presidential ambitions and his disrespect for [PER Erdogan  ] .
