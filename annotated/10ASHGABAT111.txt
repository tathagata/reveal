( C ) SUMMARY: There have been reports about a recent incident in which a motorist crossed an intersection in front President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] 's motorcade as it moved through [LOC Ashgabat  ] . 
Several high ranking police officials were fired after the incident , and the driver of the vehicle was reportedly beaten and charged with attempted assassination . 
In another incident , a military official was fired after a cat ran in front of the president 's car as he was traveling to his dacha . 
Rumors are also circulating that there was an assassination attempt against [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] last summer , which was immediately followed by heightened security measures . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A police captain from the [ORG Diplomatic Security Department  ] of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , often assigned to duty at the [MISC Embassy  ] compound , told [MISC Embassy  ] political assistant about the incident in December involving the president 's motorcade . 
A motorist allegedly drove through a blocked-off intersection in front of the President 's cortege in [LOC Ashgabat  ] . 
It is not known how the car managed to bypass the police and [ORG Ministry of National Security  ] ( [ORG MNB  ] ) officers that cordon off the streets where the president 's motorcade is going to pass . 
One ex-traffic police officer believes that the driver either ignored the officer blocking the street and simply by-passed him , or knew the officer personally and tried , unsuccessfully , to get through before the motorcade arrived. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to yet another source , the driver was a resident of [PER Mary  ] , driving a relative 's car with [LOC Ashgabat  ] license plates . 
It is possible the provincial driver was unfamiliar with local regulations . 
The driver was alone in the car . 
He was quickly stopped by presidential security and bodyguards before he even got close to the president 's vehicle . 
The driver was reportedly " beaten black and blue " before being transported to an [ORG MNB  ] detention facility . 
According to some , he was charged with attempted assassination and sentenced to 25 years in prison . 
The acting head of [LOC Ashgabat  ] 's traffic police department and his two deputies were fired the next day . 
( [ORG NOTE:  ] The fired acting head of the [MISC Asghabat  ] police force , [LOC Major Babamyrat  ] , is a neighbor of an [MISC Embassy  ] employee and confirmed having lost his job in December . 
END NOTE ) The traffic police officer responsible for blocking the street in question was also jailed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Another incident reportedly occurred two months ago that was feared to be an assassination attempt . 
It was committed by a cat that ran in front of the President 's car as he was traveling to his residence in the village of [LOC Archibil  ] . 
( [PER NOTE: Archabil  ] , 20 kilometers from [LOC Ashgabat  ] , is located in the foothills of the [ORG Kopet Dag Mountains  ] and is surrounded by forest . 
END NOTE ) A military lieutenant reported that an officer from the [ORG Presidential Security Regiment  ] , responsible for safeguarding that particular area , was fired the following day. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Presidential security measures appear to have been heightened in recent weeks . 
Even streets and parking lots located several blocks from the motorcade 's route are blocked off , and any vehicles or pedestrians in the vicinity deemed suspicious are stopped and questioned . 
There are also rumors circulating that an assassination attempt against the president took place during a visit last August to [ORG Balkan Province  ] . 
Whether or not there is any truth to the rumor , we have noted that since [LOC ASHGABAT  ] 00000111 002 OF 002 last summer , the President 's security detail has become more professional and has increased the security cordon around President at events . 
END COMMENT .
