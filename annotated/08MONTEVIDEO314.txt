Baxter  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) On May 14 , the Ambassador delivered a letter on behalf of President [PER Bush  ] to the Foreign Minister which responds to President [PER Vazquez'  ] earlier request ( reftel ) for [ORG USG  ] cooperation in the release of pertinent documents related to the death of Mrs. [PER Cecilia Fontana de Heber  ] in [LOC Uruguay  ] in <a id='par1978' href='#par1978'>¶</a>1978 . 
Fourteen declassified documents were also attached . 
The letter indicates that the [ORG USG  ] possesses no additional information that would be helpful in identifying those responsible for Mrs. [PER Heber  ] 's death . 
[PER ForMin Fernandez  ] thanked the Ambassador for the [ORG USG  ] 's help in resolving this long standing murder case which continues to have political repercussions . 
He promised to immediately forward the letter and documents to President [PER Vazquez.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During the meeting , the Ambassador also took the opportunity to raise the unsolved murder case of [LOC OPS/AID  ] law enforcement officer [PER Daniel A. Mitrione  ] who died at the hands of the [MISC Tupamaro  ] guerrillas in August 1970 . 
He recalled that the [ORG USG  ] has not forgotten about this crime against a [LOC U.S.  ] citizen and that the perpetrators remain at large . 
The Ambassador noted that one of the unrepentant , self-admitted participants in the [PER Mitrione  ] killing is Dr. [PER Henry Willy ENGLER Golovchenko  ] , who currently resides in [LOC Uppsala  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] . 
He observed that Dr. [PER Engler  ] appears to be on the verge of " rehabilitation " in [LOC Uruguay  ] , and has even been mentioned as a possible candidate for the [ORG Nobel Prize  ] for his work on Alzheimer 's disease . 
He said that it would be " unfortunate " should [PER Engler  ] ever be placed in a position within the [ORG GOU  ] , because it would inevitably complicate [MISC U.S./Uruguayan  ] bilateral relations . 
He urged [PER Fernandez  ] to release any files that the [ORG GOU  ] might possess on the [PER Mitrione  ] case . 
The [PER ForMin  ] revealed his understanding in the matter. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On May 21 , President [PER Vazquez  ] telephoned the Ambassador to thank him for his assistance in the poisoned wine case . 
On May 22 , an [ORG Associated Press  ] article appeared under the ( roughly translated ) title of " [MISC U.S. Without Further Evidence  ] in the Poisoned Wine Case " . 
Subsequent to the [ORG AP  ] article , some National ( [ORG Blanco  ] ) party members publicly complained that they still believed the [LOC U.S.  ] was withholding classified information , but the story seems to have lost its momentum since then. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: We are keeping our fingers crossed that the poisoned wine case has definitively been laid to rest . 
The excellent work at the [ORG NSC  ] and the [ORG Department of State  ] persuaded our interlocutors that we take President [PER Vazquez'  ] requests and his relationship with President [PER Bush  ] seriously , even though we know that [PER Vazquez  ] was prompted to do so for domestic political reasons . 
Finally , the Ambassador raised the [PER Mitrione  ] case as a pushback on the poisoned wine case . 
End Comment .
