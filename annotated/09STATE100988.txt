END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------- BILATERAL DIALOGUE: SLOW AND DIFFICULT -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Under Secretary [PER Otero  ] opened the meeting by reaffirming Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , s commitment to improve relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] and noting her own interest in finding ways to be helpful to the bilateral dialogue process , given her [MISC Bolivian  ] background. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Choquehuanca  ] stressed the importance of building mutual trust and said [LOC Bolivia  ] would always be open to dialogue . 
He appreciated our first round of talks ( held in May , in [LOC La Paz  ] ) as a first step in overcoming differences and establishing a relationship of mutual respect . 
He did complain there had been no progress since then , and that the decisions to remove [LOC Bolivia  ] from the [ORG Andean Trade Preference  ] program ( [ORG ATPA  ] ) and to flunk [LOC Bolivia  ] in the narcotics certification were not constructive . 
He noted [LOC Bolivia  ] , s new alliances with [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] to combat drug trafficking and affirmed that , despite difficulties , they are ready for a second round of talks . 
[PER Choquehuanca  ] said the [MISC Bolivian  ] government cancelled [ORG USAID  ] democracy programs &en el marco del dialogo8 and that they look forward to discussing pending assistance issues and finalizing a bilateral framework agreement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) U/S [PER Otero  ] welcomed their commitment to advancing the dialogue as &good news8 but expressed disappointment in [LOC Bolivia  ] , s decision to terminate [ORG USAID  ] democracy programs. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Charge [PER Solon  ] said they feared a new &golpe8 to the dialogue process in December when [ORG ATPA  ] legislation is renewed . 
He warned the consequences for the bilateral relashionship would be grave if [LOC Bolivia  ] is not included . 
[PER Solon  ] said the clock is ticking , and if we do not move fast the dialogue will become increasingly difficult and the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] will eventually put [LOC Bolivia  ] in a category where it doesn , t belong . 
He said what they need from us is a concrete proposal on what steps we will take to advance the dialogue process. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Solon  ] recalled the advances of the first round of talks , especially how close we were in reaching agreement on principles to guide our development cooperation . 
Yet , from the four elements of their framework agreement proposal ( political relations , development cooperation , counternarcotics , and trade ) our counter-proposal was weakest in the area of development cooperation , a step backward. -------------- MOVING FORWARD -------------- STATE 00100988 002 OF 002 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] noted that although we understand there may be another &golpe8 to the dialogue process in December , we are working with [ORG Congress  ] to look at trade preferences more broadly . 
Noting that we face obstacles on both sides , [PER A/S Shannon  ] pointed out that our [ORG Congress  ] sees the [MISC Bolivian  ] government , s decision to expel parts of our mission and to terminate [ORG USAID  ] democracy programs as punitive actions , and justifying engagement becomes an obstacle for us . 
To that end , it would be useful for us to know if we should expect further measures before December. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Choquehuanca  ] said what we need is to set a date and focus on it . 
[PER Choquehuanca  ] said the first half of October is preferable because [LOC Bolivia  ] is hosting the [ORG ALBA  ] summit October 16-17 . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] said we would present them with a set of potential dates by next week. ------------------------------- [ORG WTO Health Services Commitments  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Finally , Charge [PER Solon  ] raised the [ORG WTO  ] health services commitments issue pending in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
He said no one opposes [LOC Bolivia  ] , s withdrawal from the commitments except the [LOC United States  ] . 
He asked for our assistance in resolving this issue in a satisfactory manner and avoiding arbitration .
