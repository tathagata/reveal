( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary: At  ] the head of a delegation of seven ambassadors , the Ambassador urged the new Minister of Fisheries February 7 to rescind the quota established by his predecessor last month that would allow a large commercial hunt for fin and minke whales over the next five years . 
The Minister , who will make a decision this week , described the constraints that limited a complete revocation of the quota , but implied he was exploring options to limit or restrict the hunt in future years . 
The new Minister of Foreign Affairs later assured the ambassador that he does not endorse the quota decision . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Accompanied by ambassadors from the [LOC U.K.  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] , [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC France  ] , and The [LOC Netherlands  ] , the Ambassador presented Minister of Finance , [ORG Fisheries  ] , and Agriculture [PER Steingrimur J. Sigfusson  ] a joint letter ( text below ) protesting the decision by outgoing Fisheries Minister [PER Einar K. Gudfinsson  ] on January 27 to issue a quota allowing a harvest of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales this year and for each of the subsequent four years . 
Speaking for the delegation , the Ambassador thanked [PER Sigfusson  ] for his willingness to review the decision and urged him to rescind it . 
Pointing out that the seven countries signing the demarche represented almost half of all tourists to [LOC Iceland  ] last year ( tourism is a pillar of the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy , particularly since the economic crash last fall ) , she stressed the growth of the whale watching sector in [LOC Iceland  ] and the negative impact of whaling on [LOC Iceland  ] 's international image . 
She questioned assertions by the pro-whaling sectors that the hunt would employ significant numbers and that export of the meat would be profitable . 
She further deplored the decision for undermining efforts in the [ORG IWC  ] to find a solution to the polarization of that organization. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sigfusson  ] made it clear that he personally opposed the decision by his predecessor , resented that the new government had been saddled with such a controversial issue , but expected the legal review now underway would certify that [PER Gudfinsson  ] had acted within his mandate . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] believed that revocation might not be constitutionally possible , though this option was being explored by Ministry experts . 
He noted that he was in a " tricky situation " in that a majority of the 63-member parliament had already put forward a bill to validate the [PER Gudfinsson  ] quota . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] observed that cabinet ministers in [LOC Iceland  ] are answerable to parliament , and said he faced the threat that parliament could and most likely would depose him from office were he to attempt to rescind the quota. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sigfusson  ] agreed that the question of the economic viability of the harvest is important to the government and is still unresolved ; whether an international market exists for the whale meat , and whether the claims by the whaling lobby that the hunt would produce 300 jobs for Icelanders , are question that remain to be determined . 
He appreciated the ambassador 's point about the importance of tourism from anti-whaling countries to the stricken local economy , but said that the support of the [MISC Icelandic  ] people for whaling was so deep-seated it constituted a " clash of cultures " with the outside world. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sigfusson  ] said he had " limited possibility to reverse the decision in terms of quota or time scale , " hinting that he would not be able to do much to change the decision for this year . 
The whalers were preparing for the hunt despite warnings issued by the Fisheries Minister not to move ahead until the issue was settled . 
However , [PER Sigfusson  ] said that " the longer future is easier to deal with , " implying he is exploring a two-phase solution in which he could make changes in the season length , the quota , and perhaps the species for the second through fifth years. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador also raised the issue February 18 with new Minister of Foreign Affairs [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] , who is concurrently the Minister of Tourism . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] said flatly that he was against whaling ( and in fact came from a family well-known for its anti-whaling views ) . 
He noted , without details , that he understood that [PER Sigfusson  ] is working on a bill to present to parliament that would give the Fisheries Minister authority to alter some parts of the quota decision . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] mentioned that restricting whaling to defined areas of [LOC Iceland  ] 's waters might be one of the actions [PER Sigfusson  ] could take for this coming season. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Text of joint letter to Minister of Finance , [ORG Fisheries  ] , and Agriculture , dated February 12 , 2009 and signed by ambassadors of [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC U.K.  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] , [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , and The [MISC Netherlands: We  ] are writing you today to express our governments' extreme disappointment in the decision of your predecessor to issue a quota for 150 fin and 100 minke whales to be harvested in [MISC Icelandic  ] waters . 
We applaud your interest in re-evaluating this decision . 
We deeply regretted [LOC Iceland  ] 's decision to resume commercial harvest of fin and minke whales in 2006 , and each of our governments objected to [LOC Iceland  ] 's reservation to the commercial whaling moratorium adopted pursuant to the [MISC International Convention  ] for the Regulation of Whaling . 
Our governments are concerned that the issuance of a quota at this time will undermine the " Future of the [ORG IWC  ] " efforts , in which [LOC Iceland  ] has been a participant . 
It is critical that the continuation or expansion of [LOC Iceland  ] 's commercial harvest or international trade in whale meat does not undermine goodwill or hamper progress in resolving issues pending before the [ORG Commission  ] . 
We call on [LOC Iceland  ] to reconsider this decision and focus on the advancement of the [ORG Commission  ] , and the long-term rather than short-term interests of the whaling industry .
