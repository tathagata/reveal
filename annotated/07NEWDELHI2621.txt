[ORG SCA  ] please see paragraph 4. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Summary: [MISC Kashmiri  ] paramilitary leader and [PER J&K State MLA Usman  ] [PER Abdul Majid  ] is seeking a [LOC U.S.  ] visa to attend functions hosted in [LOC Washington  ] by the [LOC United States  ] Institute of [ORG Peace  ] starting on June 7th .

Beginning in the early 1990s , [MISC India’s  ] security forces used [ORG Ikhwan  ] to combat terrorism in the [LOC Srinagar Valley  ] . 
Known for its brutal and corrupt practices , [ORG Ikhwan  ] is notorious for its use of torture , extra-judicial killing , rape , and extortion of [MISC Kashmiri  ] civilians suspected of harboring or facilitating terrorists . 
In the interest of remaining balanced in our approach tothe [LOC Kashmir  ] issue following Embassy New [MISC Delhi’s  ] denial of [PER Sayeed Ali Shah  ] Geelani’s visa request , Post recommends denying this visa application as well . 
End Summary . 
A Dubious History ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [MISC Kashmiri  ] paramilitary leader and [PER J&K  ] state MLA [PER Usman Abdul Majid  ] applied for a [LOC U.S.  ] visa on May 22nd in order to attend functions held by the [LOC United States  ] Institute of [ORG Peace  ] starting on June 7th in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] . 
[PER Majid  ] is a leader of the pro-GOI [MISC Ikhawan-ul-Musilmeen  ] paramilitary group , which was formed by [MISC India’s  ] security forces to combat terrorism in the [LOC Kashmir Valley  ] . 
The group is made up of terrorists who have surrendered to the [MISC Indian  ] government and agreed to fight against their former brethren . 
Ikhawan has a reputation in the [LOC Valley  ] for committing brutal human rights abuses -- including extra-judicial killings of suspected terrorists and their family members , as well as torturing , killing , raping , and extorting [MISC Kashmiri  ] civilians suspected of harboring or facilitating terrorists . 
[PER Majid  ] won election easily in his [LOC Baramullah  ] district of [LOC Kashmir  ] , but this is likely only because the district has had a minute voter turnout as terrorist groups continue to enforce a boycott there of [MISC Indian-held  ] elections . 
This boycott continued in [LOC Baramullah  ] even in 2002 , when turnout was much higher in other areas . 
Similar to many of the instances of torture and violence surrounding the [LOC Kashmir  ] dispute , Post is unable to verify with evidence the claims against [MISC Majid.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Action request: Post requests guidance as to how to proceed with Majid’s visa application . 
Visas donkey will follow septel. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Comment: Majid’s reputation in the [LOC Kashmir Valley  ] is one of the worst among those associated with the [ORG GOI  ] . 
In light of our rejection of the [MISC Geelani  ] visa , we will not be able to maintain our record of neutrality in the [LOC Kashmir  ] dispute if we grant this visa . 
Nonetheless , denying his application may have some repercussions with [ORG GOI  ] officials , especially those from [ORG India’s Intelligence Bureau  ] who have been close to his case . 
As with the [MISC Geelani  ] case , this will be a very delicate matter , but in light of [LOC Ikhawan’s  ] history , Post recommends that the [LOC U.S.  ] government deny the visa .
