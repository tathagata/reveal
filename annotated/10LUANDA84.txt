( [ORG SBU  ] ) The following responses are keyed to Department queries ( reftel ) : [ORG A: Description  ] of [MISC Chinese  ] engagement in [MISC Angola:  ] The [MISC Chinese  ] are heavily engaged in financing and implementing [LOC Angola  ] 's reconstruction following the end of the nation 's devastating civil war in 2002 . 
In the absence of a much anticipated ( by the [MISC Angolans  ] ) conference of [MISC Western  ] donors to help fund reconstruction , [LOC Angola  ] turned to the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
[MISC Chinese  ] financing includes a ( mostly oil-backed ) [ORG USD  ] 4 billion line of credit through the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Ex-Im Bank  ] . 
Although the terms of this line of credit are not entirely clear , it seemingly provides concessionary interest rates and some grace period for repayment . 
According to unconfirmed reports , an additional line of credit of up to [ORG USD  ] 4 to 6 billion has been established through the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Investment Fund  ] ( [ORG CIF  ] ) , though Post doubts that this fund , which was to have been funded by [MISC Chinese  ] investors , ever attracted enough [MISC Chinese  ] capital to undertake intended infrastructure projects in [LOC Angola  ] . 
At the moment , the [ORG CIF  ] is partnering with state oil company [ORG Sonangol  ] in extractive industry ventures in [LOC Africa  ] outside of [LOC Angola  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Ex-Im Bank  ] line of credit is linked to the use of [MISC Chinese  ] companies as prime contractors for [MISC Chinese-funded  ] projects . 
Many sub-contractors for these projects are [MISC Chinese  ] companies as well . 
Some of these companies have stayed in [LOC Angola  ] after project completion and are branching out into other areas , such as import/export transactions and private housing . 
The feverish pace of [MISC Chinese  ] engagement in [LOC Angola  ] cooled markedly in 2009 as the global financial crisis gutted [LOC Angola  ] 's oil and diamond revenues , precipitating sharp reductions in [LOC GRA  ] expenditures . 
According to the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador in [LOC Luanda  ] , [LOC China  ] had to recall more than 25,000 workers in 2009 due to the lack of [LOC GRA  ] funds to pay them . 
Few new projects were launched in 2009 , though most of those previously underway continued , albeit often at a reduced pace . 
However , those linked to preparations for the January 2010 [MISC Africa Cup of Nations Football  ] ( soccer ) [ORG Championship  ] , which [LOC Angola  ] hosted by building four new stadiums , continued full-steam . 
Recently concluded and currently underway infrastructure and energy sector-related undertakings include: ---upgrading the electricity network in [LOC Luanda  ] ; ---rehabilitation of [LOC Angola  ] 's three railway lines: Luanda-Malanje ( completion in 2010 ) ; Namibe-Menongue ( completion in 2011 ) ; and [MISC Benguela-DRC  ] ( completion in 2012 ) ; ---improvements of infrastructure in [LOC Luanda  ] , including building a new international airport ; ---numerous roads and highways outside of [LOC Luanda  ] ; ---social housing projects within [LOC Luanda  ] ; ---four football ( soccer ) stadiums ( [LOC Luanda  ] , [LOC Benguela  ] , [LOC Lubango  ] , and [MISC Cabinda  ] ) that were used during the [MISC Africa Cup of Nations  ] tournament in January 2010 ; ---joint oil exploration venture with [MISC Angolan  ] parastatal [ORG Sonangol  ] in Block 18 ; and ---a diamond mining venture with state diamond company [ORG Endiama.  ] <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
Examples of [MISC U.S.-China  ] cooperation in [LOC Angola  ] . 
[MISC Chinese  ] contractors have successfully implemented [MISC DOD-funded  ] humanitarian assistance projects , and a [MISC Chinese  ] national is engaged by an implementing partner in our malaria program. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
Potential areas for [MISC U.S.-China  ] cooperation . 
As reported Ref B , the Ambassador raised with the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador in July 2008 the concept of a joint agricultural development project , and the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador agreed to explore the possibilities . 
However , determined efforts by [ORG USAID  ] technical staff failed to identify a project consistent with our development objectives to which the [MISC Chinese  ] could contribute meaningfully . 
Given shifts in [MISC FY-2010  ] [ORG USAID  ] funding , Post will undertake again to explore possibilities for cooperation with the [MISC Chinese  ] in regard to either our expanding agriculture program or in our malaria and/or HIV/AIDS programs . 
Post experience has shown , however , that language can be a considerable barrier ; for example , the current [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador speaks no [MISC Portuguese  ] or [MISC English  ] and only limited [MISC Spanish  ] . 
[LOC LUANDA  ] 00000084 002 OF 002 <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: The [MISC Chinese  ] presence looms large in [LOC Angola  ] . 
Although exact numbers are elusive , a minimum of 50,000 [MISC Chinese  ] are in the country ; most other estimates are markedly higher . 
Few question that the [MISC Chinese  ] have contributed importantly to [LOC Angola  ] 's ongoing national reconstruction . 
Nonetheless , some [MISC Angolans  ] express concerns that [MISC Chinese  ] engagement , financed by loans that [LOC Angola  ] needs to repay , has failed to create jobs for [MISC Angolans  ] , has failed to transfer technology to [MISC Angolans  ] , and has often resulted in poor quality performance . 
Concerns have also been raised about the opaque nature of the [MISC Chinese  ] funding , which is channeled through the [ORG Office of National Reconstruction  ] of the Presidency . 
END COMMENT .
