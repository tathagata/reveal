Three competing consortia submitted bids and are led by the following firms: 1 ) [ORG Bechtel  ] ( [MISC American  ] ) , 2 ) [ORG ACS  ] ( [MISC Spanish  ] ) , and 3 ) [PER Sacyr  ] ( [MISC Spanish  ] ) . 
Reportedly , both [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] submitted technically compliant bids priced over $4 billion ; however , there are doubts about [PER Sacyr  ] 's technical and financial compliance . 
Unfortunately , there is no clear standard for minimal technical compliance and how a technically non-compliant bid would be disqualified . 
[PER Sacyr  ] 's price reportedly is lower than $4 billion and price weighs heavily in the determination of the winner . 
Additionally , [PER Sacyr  ] 's bid is reportedly supported by government export credit agencies reinsuring their bonding syndicate , which is against the spirit of the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] 's ( [ORG ACP  ] ) public efforts to not involve sovereign guarantees ( the inclusion of which masks a consortium 's financial well-being and provides a financial bidding advantage ) . 
Post will continue to monitor the process , to advocate for [ORG Bechtel  ] , and to promote [LOC U.S.  ] based content. ------------------------------ A WINNER WILL SOON BE DECLARED ( IF THE BID IS RIGHT ) --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The public ceremony to announce a winner for the [ORG Panama Canal  ] 's third set of locks contract is expected to be held between July 2 and July 14 , according to private statements made by representatives of the [ORG ACP  ] and [ORG Canal Expansion Project Advisor CH2MHill  ] to [ORG Embassy  ] and consortia staff . 
July 9 is the most commonly reported date . 
As explained in reftel , the financial portion of the bids will be opened and scored during a ceremony . 
The financial score ( 45% of the total points ) will then be combined with the technical score ( 55% of the total points ) , which is currently being calculated by a team of experts . 
The winner will then be instantaneously and publicly announced . 
However , if the winner 's financial bid is higher than the [ORG ACP  ] 's price cap ( which will be revealed moments before the consortia 's financial bids are opened ) , the winner will be asked to lower their price to within the price cap . 
If the winner does not accept the price cap price , then the [ORG ACP  ] will allow all consortia , who submitted technically and financially compliant bids , to resubmit price proposals . 
These new price proposals would then be combined with already determined technical proposals and a new winner would be declared . 
If the price is still too high , the [ORG ACP  ] can raise its price ceiling ( which would need approval by the [ORG National Assembly  ] ) or void the entire bidding process. -------------------------- COMPETITORS AND THEIR BIDS -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Three consortia submitted bids and are led by the following firms: 1 ) [ORG Bechtel  ] ( [MISC American  ] ) , 2 ) [ORG ACS  ] ( [MISC Spanish  ] ) , and 3 ) [PER Sacyr  ] ( [MISC Spanish  ] ) . 
According to a representative from the [ORG Canal Expansion Project Advisor  ] ( [MISC American  ] firm [ORG CH2MHill  ] ) , each consortium submitted differing bids . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] reportedly produced the " [ORG Rolls Royce  ] " set of locks , which exceeded [ORG ACP  ] requirements , including for throughput . 
( As laid out in the public bid documents , a consortium does not receive extra points for exceeding requirements . 
) [ORG ACS  ] reportedly more closely followed the [ORG ACP  ] 's requirements . 
[PER Sacyr  ] , according to [ORG CH2MHill  ] , submitted a technical proposal , which may not be minimally acceptable . 
Due to the publicly available criteria for scoring the technical proposals and assuming initial reports are accurate , it is anticipated that [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] will receive roughly the same technical score . 
[PER Sacyr  ] , if they are found technically compliant/viable , would score only slightly lower . 
Thus , if the technical scores are close , price will be the determining factor in the formula to determine the winner. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Reports of the prices attached to the bids roughly track the quality . 
According to consortia members , both [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] have bids that " start with a 4 " - meaning over $4 billion . 
[PER Sacyr  ] , via consortium member [ORG Impregilo  ] , leaked to the press the price of $3.7 billion on April 21 and stated that they have the lowest price . 
Depending on the accuracy of the leaked price data , [PER Sacyr  ] 's financial score could be significantly better than [ORG Bechtel  ] 's and [ORG ACS  ] 's . 
( Leaking the bid price is a breach of the bidding rules . 
[ORG Impregilo  ] recently broke the bidding rules again by declaring that the [MISC Sacyr-led  ] consortium has the highest technical score . 
Absent a breach in [ORG ACP  ] security , this information was unknowable at the time of the statements . 
[ORG ACS  ] and [ORG Bechtel  ] have both written strong protest letters to the [ORG ACP  ] . 
) Post 's Senior Commercial Officer reports that during an unrelated meeting , a senior [ORG ACP  ] official accidentally stated the [ORG ACP  ] price ceiling is $3.62 billion. ------------------------- SACYR - POTENTIAL SPOILER ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When combined the financial and technical components of the bid are combined in 45% and 55% proportions respectively , the [PER Sacyr  ] bid could win this " best value " competition . 
A [PER Sacyr  ] win could be disconcerting . 
[PER Sacyr  ] is considered bankrupt and is being propped up by the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
Therefore , besides possibly having a design that is not workable , a [PER Sacyr  ] wins adds financial risk to the locks construction . 
The bid process has protections against non-compliant bids , if the [ORG ACP  ] chooses to activate the protections . 
If a bid is technically non-compliant ( and the [ORG ACP  ] has not detailed the exact parameters of a technically non-compliant bid ) , the [ORG ACP  ] has the option to not even open the price envelope . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] representatives told the Ambassador on June 24 that they prefer this path . 
If a bid is financially non-compliant , the [ORG ACP  ] possibly can reject the offer . 
A bid would be financially non-compliant if a consortium failed a financial health audit , which will be conducted on the winner . 
All consortia were determined by the [ORG ACP  ] to be financially healthy as of November 15 , 2007 during the pre-qualification phase . 
Based upon previous decisions to keep all consortia in the process , the [ORG ACP  ] is not expected to disqualify any consortium. -------------------------------- SACYR - RECEIVING STATE SUPPORT ? -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Based upon reports from representatives from competing consortia , [PER Sacyr  ] 's $50 million performance bond is backed by the government export credit agencies of [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG CESCE-Secretaria  ] de Estado de [ORG Comercio  ] ) , [LOC France  ] ( [ORG COFACE-Compagnie Francaise D'Assurance Pour le Commerce Extereur  ] ) , and [LOC Italy  ] ( [PER SACE-Servize Assicurativi  ] del [PER Commercio Estero  ] ) . 
[PER Sacyr  ] gained a competitive advantage by securing the near equivalent of a sovereign guarantee apparently at no additional cost and no additional scrutiny of their books ( vice [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] who had to purchase the bond on the open market and subjected their firms to some level of financial evaluation ) . 
This arrangement goes against [ORG ACP  ] Administrator [PER Aleman  ] 's publicly expressed desire not to have sovereign guarantees , because the performance bond ideally should serve as a surrogate for a consortium 's financial health . 
If a consortium could not provide the $50 million performance bond , then the consortium was probably not financially healthy . 
If [PER Sacyr  ] wins , litigation from [ORG Bechtel  ] or [ORG ACS  ] is likely . 
For [ORG ACS  ] , there is the added dimension of why the [MISC Spanish  ] government is helping one [MISC Spanish  ] consortium and not the other . 
It should be noted , however , that the [ORG ACP  ] has not prohibited use of export credit agencies in the bidding process. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) In essence , the [ORG ACP  ] created a transparent process and now - due to rigid adherence to that process - may choose a consortium that provides the " best value , " on paper , but may not be capable of completing the project . 
It appears that the [ORG ACP  ] wished to retain flexibility by not clearly demarcating the floor of technical non-compliance and not deviating from its rules to ask [PER Sacyr  ] for a comprehensive audit before the bids are open . 
( We understand that [PER Sacyr  ] may have provided year-to-date 2009 financial data that , due to the limited time window of that data , could continue to mask [PER Sacyr  ] 's true financial condition . 
) Post will continue to monitor the bidding process closely to ensure fairness . 
Post maintains frequent communication with [ORG Bechtel  ] representatives in order to coordinate actions to assure [ORG Bechtel  ] is not unfairly disadvantaged .
