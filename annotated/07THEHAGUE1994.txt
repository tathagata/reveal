( C ) SUMMARY: On November 9 , Ambassador met with [MISC Dutch  ] MFA Minister for [ORG European Affairs  ] [PER Timmermans  ] to discuss [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] , [PER Timmermans  ] , upcoming trips to the [LOC United States  ] , and plans to commemorate 400 years of [MISC American-Dutch  ] relations . 
Although [PER Timmermans  ] officially defended the reasons for recent [MISC Dutch-Russian  ] energy deals , he privately confessed disappointment . 
He also expressed strong doubt the [ORG EU  ] could ever reach consensus on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] is visiting [LOC New York  ] November 16-18 , and will also visit [LOC Washington DC  ] November 26-28 ; he is seeking high level meetings at State , [ORG DOE  ] , [ORG NSC  ] , and [PER Capitol Hill  ] ( see para 8 ) . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC Dutch  ] - [MISC Russian  ] Relations ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] stated he was not without concerns about the latest [MISC Dutch-Russian  ] business agreements . 
However , he must defend the government 's policy . 
( Note: [PER Timmermans  ] served previously as a diplomat in [LOC Moscow  ] and is known to advocate a stronger human rights policy toward [LOC Russia  ] . 
On November 8 , Timmermans' fellow [ORG MP  ] and [ORG Labor Party  ] member [PER Martijn van Dam  ] criticized PM [ORG Balkenende  ] 's purported failure to publicly discuss human rights during the PM 's recent visit to [LOC Russia  ] . 
) [PER Timmermans  ] noted that the positive news is that engaging [LOC Russia  ] is the only way to influence it . 
There isn't a level playing field for energy deals , and the [MISC Dutch  ] energy sector needs the deals with [LOC Russia  ] . 
If the [MISC Russians  ] don't make deals and follow through to develop their energy sector , they will default on their contracts , and the fallout will hit [LOC Germany  ] and then the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] concluded that he has great concerns...but [LOC Russia  ] is not going away . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] noted that [LOC Russia  ] was creating havoc in the [LOC Balkans  ] , and [LOC Kosovo  ] will be a messy affair . 
The [MISC Russians  ] will react strongly ( to a Kosovar declaration of independence ) , and the [MISC European  ] reaction will be all over the place , I 'm afraid . 
[PER Timmermans  ] was concerned about the future implications of the [ORG EU  ] 's outreach to Kosovo: [LOC Kosovo  ] is run by people who live off crime.. . 
( they have ) no other means to support themselves . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] had just returned from the [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet meeting , where [LOC Afghanistan  ] was discussed only on the margins . 
In principle , the first round of cabinet discussions will take place November 16 , and everyone wants to avoid delay that could mean a January , rather than December , parliamentary decision ( reftel ) . 
For [PER Timmermans  ] , setting an 18-24 month time limit on the [MISC Uruzgan  ] deployment is key -- the deadline should be firm to avoid repeating the [MISC Dutch  ] debate in two years . 
( Note: Timmermans' statement reflects the view of the [ORG Labor Party  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] added that his brother will soon go to [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a battalion commander , and that he thinks about the parents of the dead soldiers in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
) The [MISC Dutch  ] will not disengage from [LOC Afghanistan  ] any time soon , but will disengage from [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] decision to deploy in [LOC Uruzgan  ] is very good news , though there was an explicit deal between PM [ORG Balkenende  ] and President [PER Sarkozy  ] -- that the [MISC Dutch  ] would deploy to [LOC Chad  ] in exchange for the [MISC French  ] deployment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) President [PER Sarkozy  ] is creating a wonderful opportunity for the [ORG EU  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , the risk is that he may overpromise and underdeliver in [LOC France  ] and within the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's steps toward [ORG NATO  ] are extraordinary . 
Timmermans' Trip to the [LOC United States  ] , [MISC Dutch-U.S  ] . 
Relations --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Timmermans  ] wants to make the 2009 celebration of [MISC American-Dutch  ] relations a success . 
He is working to focus organizers during his meetings in [LOC New York  ] November 16-18 . 
He spoke earlier to [LOC New York  ] Governor [PER Spitzer  ] about the events , and the governor was committed to the issue . 
Queen [PER Beatrix  ] has expressed interest in participating ( Note: Please protect . 
[PER Timmermans  ] asked that the information about the Queen not be shared . 
) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] also commented on [MISC Dutch-U.S.  ] relations after the 2008 elections -- he does not expect much change . 
There are few differences among the campaigns on foreign policy . 
If the [MISC Democrats  ] win the [LOC White House  ] , they won't disengage from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
If the [MISC Republicans  ] win , they won't put any less effort into building relations with [MISC Europe.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( SBU ) [PER Timmermans  ] thanked the ambassador for agreeing to help set up meetings for Timmermans' November 26-28 trip to [LOC Washington  ] . 
He would like to meet with Energy Secretary [PER Bodman  ] , Under [PER Secretaries Burns  ] and [PER Jeffrey  ] , as well as senior [ORG National Security Council  ] contacts and members of [ORG Congress  ] . 
COMMENT: ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Although his official portfolio covers [MISC European  ] and [ORG Cultural Affairs  ] , [PER Timmermans  ] is a major behind-the-scenes player within the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) on foreign and defense policy issues generally , including the [MISC Uruzgan  ] extension . 
Timmermans' support , while still in opposition , for sending [MISC Dutch  ] troops to [LOC Uruzgan  ] was one of the key factors convincing [ORG PvdA  ] leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] to support the original deployment decision in 2005 . 
Now that the issue of a new referendum on the [ORG EU  ] reform treaty has been settled in the [ORG Balkenende  ] government 's favor , [PER Timmermans  ] appears to be focusing on [MISC European  ] Energy policy as his next big project . 
His views on this subject will carry weight not only within the [LOC Netherlands  ] , but also in [ORG EU  ] circles where he is widely respected . 
End Comment .
