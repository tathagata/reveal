[ORG Ref: Reykjavik  ] 28 and previous <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Social [LOC Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) Chair and former Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] announced late on Sunday , 8 March that she will not be running for reelection as party chair nor as a member of the [ORG Althingi  ] in the elections on April 25 . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] , who was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor last September and has undergone two major operations as well as radiation treatment , has been recuperating since early February when the current [LOC SDA-Left Green  ] government was announced ( reftel ) . 
Though at that time [PER Gisladottir  ] retained her seat as [ORG SDA  ] Chair , she did not take a ministerial post and instead put forward current Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] as her party 's senior representative in the government . 
In announcing her withdrawal , [PER Gisladottir  ] said her medical recovery has been slower than expected and demands all her energy at present . 
In a TV interview on 7 March , she specifically referred to severe vertigo , and said the following night that she also has difficulty concentrating. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Gisladottir  ] 's health has been a looming question mark for her party since it became clear in January that she was in worse shape than earlier reported . 
A week ago , she barely met the registration deadline for the [ORG SDA  ] 's March 14 Reykjavik primary , but apparently reconsidered her decision over the past week . 
Her announcement leaves the [ORG SDA  ] floundering with just weeks before its national congress kicks off on March 27 . 
PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] has thus far resisted pressure to run for [ORG SDA  ] Chair , and the only other declared candidate is former FM and Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson  ] . 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Industry [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] declared again on March 9 that he has no plans to campaign for a leadership role in the party. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Political commentators speculate that [PER Sigurdardottir  ] will now come under intense pressure from party insiders to run as chair and provide the [ORG SDA  ] with some leadership . 
Leading daily newspaper Morgunbladid noted this possibility in its March 9 editorial , while also speculating that despite [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's tremendous popularity and 65 percent approval rating with the public , she will not have [PER Gisladottir  ] 's ability to unify the [ORG SDA  ] around a single vision . 
That said , one close observer of [ORG SDA  ] politics told [PER PolOff  ] that she believes [PER Sigurdardottir  ] will be left with little choice but to run for party chair , perhaps for a shortened two-year term . 
The party knows too well that the 70 year old [PER Hannibalsson  ] " belongs to the last century , " and that [PER Sigurdardottir  ] is the only reasonable possibility given the short time left to choose a leader before April .
