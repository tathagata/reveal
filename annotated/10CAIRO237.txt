( C ) Key Points: -- Thousands of supporters greeted former [ORG IAEA  ] Chairman [PER Mohammed El  ] [PER Baradei  ] upon his return to [LOC Cairo  ] . 
Beleaguered leaders of the opposition seem relieved at their ability to muster a show of support for [PER El Baradei  ] and enthusiastic about his potential impact . 
-- [PER El Baradei  ] is seen as an " independent " and viable alternative to a corrupt regime and an ineffectual opposition . 
However , the mainstream opposition appears reluctant to claim him as their own " consensus candidate . 
" -- In a television interview February 21 , [PER El Baradei  ] criticized GOE corruption , election fraud , lack of political reform and failure to successfully address poverty and illiteracy . 
-- [PER El Baradei  ] met with [ORG Arab League Secretary  ] [PER Amre Moussa  ] on February 22 and will begin to meet with political activists on February 23 . 
" -- [ORG NDP  ] reaction and government media reaction focused on [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's lack of political experience and doubts over his level of commitment . 
Opinion makers in the independent media also see [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] as an outsider and appear wary to offer unqualified support. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Mohammed El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's presence on the political scene remains more notable than his message , which echoes existing opposition demands . 
Yet [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's sober and broad-ranging criticism of President [PER Mubarak  ] 's regime , buttressed by his credentials as a [ORG Nobel Prize  ] winner and former [ORG IAEA  ] chairman , distinguished his message from that of largely ineffective opposition leaders . 
Despite his reluctance to declare himself a candidate , he appears , for now , to have captured the imagination of some section of the secular elite that wants democracy but is wary of the popularity of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
The significant challenge ahead is mustering credibility on the [MISC Egyptian  ] " street . 
" The [ORG NDP  ] has thus far stepped back from previous attempts to demonize [PER El  ] , which had backfired . 
The real political costs to the regime of embracing [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] are low , but President [PER Mubarak  ] is unlikely to receive the returning " national hero , " his criticism a personal affront . 
End Comment. --------------------------------- An Enthusiastic Welcome and Media Reaction -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) On February 19 , former [ORG IAEA  ] Chairman [PER Mohammed El Baradei  ] arrived at [LOC Cairo  ] airport to mark his return to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
According to several Embassy contacts and staff present at the airport " thousands " of supporters and activists greeted [PER El Baradei  ] warmly at the airport . 
[PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's return was also marked by a boost in the number of his [ORG Facebook  ] fans -- now more than seventy thousand -- and a flurry of reporting on his return in the independent media . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] for president [ORG Facebook  ] page is run by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , son of well known [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
End Note . 
) On the opinion pages , journalists suggested that while [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's welcome represented a hunger for political life previously repressed , they questioned the value of vague promises of change and [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's real commitment to the process . 
Government newspapers largely downplayed the importance of [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's return , noting President [PER Mubarak  ] had extended to [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] the use of the airport 's VIP lounge and confirmation that security services would be present to keep the peace . 
Opinion pieces in the [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000237 002 OF 004 government owned or affiliated newspapers noted his " [MISC European  ] style " of " brief and to the point answers , " suggesting that [PER El Baradei  ] remained out of touch with [MISC Egyptians  ] and unprepared for politics in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Noting that he has rejected alignment with any of [LOC Egypt  ] 's political parties they also suggest [PER El Baradei  ] arrived without a real " political program . 
" ------------------------------ Activists Generally Optimistic ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) " April 6 " leader [PER Ahmed Salah  ] , who was at the airport , told us he was " proud " his movement succeeded in helping to organize the group of supporters , which he estimated at around 3,000 . 
[PER Salah  ] said that " April 6 " leader [PER Ahmed Maher  ] and activist [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who were detained by police February 17-18 ( ref A ) , also participated in the greeting . 
Despite suggestions in the press that GOE security would maintain tight order and make arrests if necessary , [PER Salah  ] confirmed press reports of a limited security presence at the airport , saying the police " withdrew completely " from the airport . 
[PER Salah  ] acknowledged that the lack of police made the arrival somewhat chaotic , with supporters and journalists jostling each other to draw close to [PER El Baradei  ] . 
[PER El Baradei  ] himself later confirmed in a media interview that he had decided not to stop and speak to the crowd because of the limited security presence , fearing people would be hurt. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Kifaya  ] leader [PER George Is'haq  ] , himself over 60 , told us he had been pleasantly surprised that those on hand to greet [PER El Baradei  ] belonged to the " younger generation , " but said others of his generation were present . 
Taking credit for efforts to get people to come to the airport , he noted that [PER El Baradei  ] 's welcome marked a return to the kind of activism [ORG Kifaya  ] had not been able to muster since 2006 . 
This he said was the first time they were able to mobilize people without the help or presence of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ( [ORG MB  ] ) . 
( [ORG Note: Individual  ] members of the [ORG MB  ] had been cooperating with [ORG Kifaya  ] , " April 6 " and others in several campaigns focused on drawing support before the 2010 parliamentary and 2011 presidential elections , such as the [ORG Campaign for Free Elections  ] and the [ORG Campaign Against Succession  ] . 
The [ORG MB  ] also participated in [ORG Kifaya  ] 's pro-judge rallies during the 2005 elections . 
End Note . 
) [PER Is'haq  ] suggested [PER El Baradei  ] 's return fueled an optimism that had " revived " people 's spirits . 
Political commentator , [ORG Cairo University  ] professor and head of the [ORG Ayman Nour-founded Coalition Against Succession  ] [PER Hassan Nafaa  ] told [ORG Al Jazeera  ] [MISC English  ] urged public pressure on the GOE to enact the constitutional reforms outlined by [PER El Baradei  ] and said that [LOC Egypt  ] is now " witnessing a new wave of political mobilization . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Civil society activist and Director of the [ORG Arab Center  ] for the [LOC Independence  ] of the Judiciary and Legal Profession [PER Nasser Amin  ] said [PER El Baradei  ] represents a clean slate candidate , someone both untainted by possible collusion with the regime -- like other members of the opposition -- and untouched by accusations of wrong doing -- like 2005 presidential candidate [PER Ayman Nour  ] . 
Commenting in the independent press , novelist and now frequent political commentator [PER Alaa Al Aswani  ] called enthusiasm about [PER El Baradei  ] evidence of an [MISC Egyptian  ] desire for change , but warned that he should not be seen as a " savior . 
" ----------------------------- [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] and the Opposition ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Mainstream opposition parties which regularly meet as what is known in [LOC Egypt  ] as the " opposition coalition " ( [PER Al Wafd  ] , the [ORG Democratic Front Party  ] ( [ORG DFP  ] ) , [ORG Taggamou  ] and the [ORG Nasserist Party  ] ) have not been able to reach consensus on [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] as a democratic activist or candidate . 
Only [ORG DFP  ] leader [PER Osama Al  ] [PER Ghazali Harb  ] has publically expressed enthusiasm about the impact of [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000237 003 OF 004 return to [LOC Cairo  ] . 
[PER Harb  ] told us the turnout at the airport was a sign of a " new political momentum " that would take " competition with the government to a new level . 
" [PER Harb  ] called [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] the right man at the right time , but underscored that his core message was the same as the long-standing demands from the opposition . 
He called [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] an " international heavyweight " untouchable by government smear campaigns . 
Press reports indicate that [PER Harb  ] is the only member of the four party coalition that supports [PER El Baradei  ] as a candidate . 
However , there appears to be some internal debate within the [PER Wafd  ] party . 
[PER Wafd  ] party members from [LOC Gharbiyya  ] part of the group [ORG Wafdists Against Succession  ] ( not sanctioned by the party ) were present at the airport to receive [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] . 
That group 's leader told the [MISC Egyptian  ] daily [LOC El Shorouk  ] that he and [MISC Wafd  ] leaders Honorary President [PER Mostafa El Taweel  ] and VP [PER Fouad Badrawy  ] intend to seek their own meeting with [LOC El Baradei.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Al Ghad Party  ] Vice President [PER Wael Nawara  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that he and others in the party welcomed [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's political activism in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Nawara  ] added he would have liked to greet [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] at the airport , but was busy working to resolve internal party conflict after [PER Ayman Nour  ] 's announcement on February 15 that he had been selected by [ORG Al Ghad  ] as its presidential candidate . 
Some in the party , including its president [PER Ehab El Khouly  ] , publically criticized this move as pre-empting [ORG Al Ghad  ] 's ability to support an opposition " consensus candidate " like [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] . 
[PER Nour  ] 's own comments about [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] have vacillated between statements of support and suggestions that he is only a " virtual candidate . 
" [ORG Fellow Ghad  ] party VP [PER Gameela Ismail  ] , [PER Nour  ] 's estranged wife , was on hand to greet [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] and told the media she saw no contradiction in her support for [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] . 
[PER Ismail  ] said she would stand behind coordinated opposition support for one presidential candidate whether [PER EL  ] [PER Baradei  ] or Nour. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] will meet on February 23 with [PER Harb  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and other political activists . 
Press reports indicate that Dr. [PER Yehia El Gamal  ] , well-known constitutional scholar and co-founder of the [ORG Democratic Front Party  ] ( [ORG DFP  ] ) , will also ask [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] to join a group of scholars who seek to draft an alternative constitution for [LOC Egypt  ] . 
( [ORG Note: El  ] [PER Gamal  ] left the [ORG DFP  ] after a clash with current President and co-founder [PER Osama Al  ] [PER Ghazali Harb  ] . 
End Note . 
) ---------------- In His Own Words ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In his first public appearance since his return , Sunday , February 21 , [PER El Baradei  ] took part in a three hour interview on [MISC Egyptian  ] Satellite Channel Dream TV 's program ten o'clock hosted by [PER Mona El Shazli  ] . 
Taking questions from callers [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] reiterated his previous statements that he never intended to run in the 2011 presidential elections but said he would run against President [PER Mubarak  ] if needed constitutional changes were made and it were in [LOC Egypt  ] 's interest to do so . 
[PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] reiterated his call for constitutional reforms , particularly reform of [ORG Article  ] 76 which governs the selection of presidential candidates and which many believe was tailor made for presidential son [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] , and [ORG Article  ] 88 which does not proscribe term limits . 
( [ORG Note: El  ] [PER Baradei  ] has said he will not join a party ; one of the criteria for candidacy is senior membership in a party with at least one representative in parliament , but he has not ruled out running as an independent which would require the endorsement of 250 members of parliament and the local councils , likely impossible because both institutions are dominated by members of the ruling [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) . 
End Note ) [PER El Baradei  ] also criticized widespread election fraud in 2005 and criticized as " conspiracy theory " that any other country ( i.e. , the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) is capable of selecting the president of another . 
[PER El Baradei  ] criticized the current regime , specifically President [PER Mubarak  ] , for leadership that has led to a corrupt state characterized by a climate of fear that was imposed by the security services . 
He cited widespread corruption , the failure to enact reforms to address the country 's high poverty and illiteracy rates , inability to address sectarian tensions , and limited space for practice of political rights as the [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000237 004 OF 004 current regime 's legacy. ------------ [ORG NDP Reaction  ] ------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG NDP  ] reaction has been muted . 
[ORG NDP  ] MP and [ORG Political Science  ] Professor [PER Gehad Ouda  ] called in a comment during the [MISC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] television appearance and said [PER El Baradei  ] does not realize the difficulty of the situation in [LOC Egypt  ] , suggesting his criticisms were off the mark as there are different types of democracy that might be applied . 
The evening following [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's appearance on her show , TV host [PER Mona El Shazli  ] reportedly told her audience that she had received calls from the public accusing her of a pro-NDP bias and calls from [ORG NDP  ] members angry that she had given [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] three hours of air time . 
Dean of the [ORG Cairo University Faculty of Economics and Political Science  ] and member of the ruling [ORG NDP  ] 's [ORG Policies Committee  ] Alia [PER Al Mahdy  ] , told [PER PolOff  ] she remains close to her predecessor [PER Mona  ] [PER El Baradei  ] ( [PER Mohammed El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's sister ) and believes [PER El Baradei  ] intends to press for change but is unlikely to actually run for president . 
She said that she in others in the [ORG NDP  ] " respect " [PER El  ] [PER Baradei  ] but remain loyal to President [PER Mubarak  ] . 
She added that [LOC El  ] [PER Baradei  ] 's long absence from [LOC Egypt  ] does not mean that he does not understand [LOC Egypt  ] well enough to run but that [MISC Egyptians  ] do not know him well enough to vote for him. ------------------- Meeting [PER Amre Moussa  ] ------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) In his first public meeting following his arrival , [PER El Baradei  ] met with [ORG Arab League Secretary General  ] [PER Amre Moussa  ] whom he called a " personal friend . 
" The meeting was reported by the independent media as having focused on the " future of [LOC Egypt  ] . 
" [PER El Baradei  ] gave no formal comment to the media after the meeting but [PER Amre Moussa  ] reportedly said that all [MISC Egyptians  ] were " aspiring for change , " calling it their right to do so .
