END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) During a stop in [LOC Madrid  ] April 19 to consult on the [LOC Western Sahara  ] , Deputy Assistant Secretary for [MISC Near Eastern Affairs  ] [PER Gordon Gray  ] held an in-depth discussion on the current [LOC U.S.  ] approach toward the [LOC Western Sahara  ] dispute with MFA [ORG DG  ] [PER Alvaro Iranzo  ] , and a team of experts from MFA , s [LOC Middle East  ] and [ORG UN  ] divisions including [PER Juan Manuel Linares  ] , Deputy Director General for the [ORG UN  ] , [PER Felix Costales  ] , Deputy Political Director , [PER Javier Sancho  ] , Chief of Staff to the FM , and [PER Federico Torres  ] , Chief of Staff to the Deputy FM . 
The [ORG DCM  ] and PolCouns attended from the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
Discussions took place over lunch in the Foreign Minister 's private dining room , a special courtesy which reflected the GOS appreciation for the consultations and the importance the Foreign Minister attached to the issue. //TURNING POINT// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG DG  ] [PER Iranzo  ] opened the lunch by providing an historical overview of the [MISC Spanish  ] position on the [LOC Western Sahara  ] and the various efforts to reach a mutually agreeable solution . 
[PER Iranzo  ] noted that [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] , which are the main sources of [MISC Muslim  ] immigration to [LOC Spain  ] , are vital neighbors and factor heavily in [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy ; he added that in the age of globalization , [LOC Spain  ] in particular as well as the rest of the [ORG EU  ] feel compelled to reach a solution in the [LOC Western Sahara  ] that would open the door to [MISC North African  ] integration . 
The recent terrorist attacks in [LOC North Africa  ] are just additional proof of the need to increase cooperation in the region . 
[PER Iranzo  ] said the only modern comparison to the frozen border between [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] is the DMZ on the [LOC Korean Peninsula  ] , and he underscored that the two nations are natural allies that share homogeneous populations and strategic interests . 
[LOC Spain  ] would like to bring the leaders together through the [ORG EuroMediterranean Process  ] and other international bodies in order to improve the region 's capacity to combat terrorism and poverty. //ACHIEVE A SOLUTION WITH NO CLEAR WINNER// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] wants the April UNSC resolution to compel bilateral negotiations without preconditions between the [MISC Polisario  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] under [ORG UN  ] auspices with the assistance of a facilitator designated by the [ORG UNSYG  ] . 
The [ORG UN  ] 's role is historically established in the conflict and provides a guarantee to both parties , and [PER Iranzo  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was " religiously " committed to efficient multilateralism . 
The facilitator should not be a traditional mediator but should compel the two sides to find common ground rather than proposing a third-party solution . 
[PER Iranzo  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] had no specific preference on who would facilitate negotiations , though he noted that current Personal Envoy [PER Van Walsum  ] does not have the confidence of both parties . 
The end goal , according to [PER Iranzo  ] , should be a negotiated settlement with no clear winner . 
Without a mutually acceptable solution , it would be very difficult to achieve a thaw in relations between [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] . 
He cautioned that the worst [LOC MADRID  ] 00000753 002.2 OF 003 possible result from a [MISC Spanish  ] perspective would be another technical rollover of [ORG MINURSO  ] , and the international community should refuse any attempt at this by either party . 
On the need to maintain the ceasefire between the [MISC Polisario  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] , he said , " This is a must for [LOC Spain  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
" As it remains extremely difficult to identify the proper voting population for a referendum on [LOC Western Sahara  ] , [LOC Spain  ] thinks any referendum should not be the first step in any solution but should take place years down the road. //MANDATE RENEWAL// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to the length of the [ORG MINURSO  ] mandate renewal , [PER Iranzo  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] favored a six-month mandate that includes a report by [ORG UNSYG Moon  ] on the [LOC Western Sahara  ] after two months , providing the basis for negotiations prior to the next renewal . 
He cautioned that a two month renewal would be too short a period for [MISC Polisario  ] decision making to take place . 
He also warned against using [ORG MINURSO  ] as leverage , noting that the [MISC Moroccans  ] benefit from [ORG MINURSO  ] 's continued presence while the [MISC Polisario  ] feel they have nothing to lose by [ORG MINURSO  ] 's departure . 
[LOC Spain  ] , for its part , considers [ORG MINURSO  ] an essential element in maintaining stability so long as there is no agreement on the status of the [LOC Western Sahara  ] and therefore would not want the current process to lead to the end of [ORG MINURSO  ] unless conditions were appropriate . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] have told the [MISC Moroccans  ] not to be over-anxious in moving ahead with their autonomy plan and to keep their expectations low. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gray  ] agreed with much of [PER Iranzo  ] 's analysis , but he expressed the [ORG USG  ] 's slight disappointment in the [ORG UNSYG  ] 's report on the proposals . 
The report treated the [MISC Moroccan  ] and [MISC Polisario  ] plans equally and did not give enough credit to the sincere [MISC Moroccan  ] effort to craft a solution , while the [MISC Polisario  ] simply recycled the [ORG Baker Plan  ] . 
He noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] was flexible with regard to the auspices of any negotiations and could live with [ORG UN  ] auspices , but was not pushing for that outcome . 
He added that Secretary Rice had told the [MISC Algerian  ] Foreign Minister that negotiations without preconditions were the only way to proceed , and that the most important point was that both sides sit down to talk . 
On mandate renewal length , [PER Gray  ] told [PER Iranzo  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] favors a two-month mandate in order to maintain the pressure on both parties and to signal that this renewal is not a continuation of business as usual . 
The [ORG UN  ] also should not give the [MISC Polisario  ] a permanent veto over the process . 
If the [MISC Polisario  ] were to choose not to take advantage of the two-month window to accept negotiations , then the [LOC U.S.  ] would be prepared to support the [MISC Moroccan  ] plan as the preferred solution . 
He explained that if the negotiations do not begin after two months , it was not the [LOC U.S.  ] intention at this point to terminate [MISC MINURSO.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Iranzo  ] said that any disagreement between [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] was over tactics and not strategy . 
He praised the previous efforts of [PER James Baker  ] and noted that the likely solution to the conflict would be found somewhere in the confines of [PER Baker  ] 's previous proposals . 
In that sense he said , " The [PER Baker  ] plans are not dead , they are hibernating . 
" On a brief mandate renewal , he said that the [ORG Security Council  ] should not provide any easy excuse for either party to opt out , preserving the stalemate . 
He suggested that three or four months might provide more time to get things done , especially given the brand new SYG who has not entirely focused on the matter . 
[PER Gray  ] said that a two-month rollover would not shut the door to any future rollovers , it would just maintain the pressure . 
He also said that the achievement of a solution would probably not impact [ORG MINURSO  ] 's short term status , as any solution would take some time to implement. //SPANISH INITIATIVE ? // <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Iranzo  ] told [PER Gray  ] that [LOC Spain  ] would be unveiling new programs and initiatives , both from President [PER Zapatero  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] , including significant international assistance to both [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] , in order to bring the [LOC Maghreb  ] closer to the [ORG EU  ] and the [LOC West  ] . 
( NOTE: At an earlier meeting with [MISC PolCouns  ] , [PER Iranzo  ] made this same point , saying that his minister would be " pulling a rabbit out of a hat " in [LOC North Africa  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) //POLISARIO UNITY// [LOC MADRID  ] 00000753 003.2 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Gray  ] asked [PER Iranzo  ] what the [MISC Spanish  ] assessment was of unity within the [MISC Polisario  ] . 
[PER Iranzo  ] said it was a matter of pressure and time . 
As long as the [MISC Moroccan  ] government lacked subtlety in its handling of the matter , the [MISC Polisario  ] would remain united by opposition to the [MISC Moroccans  ] . 
But if the [MISC Moroccans  ] start offering the [MISC Sahrawi  ] " a way out of misery , there will be fractures . 
" He also viewed the [MISC Moroccan  ] refusal to use [MISC Sahrawi  ] symbols in its autonomy plan as a mistake , saying that [LOC Morocco  ] should encourage the [MISC Sahrawi  ] symbols' usage in the autonomous region , thereby minimizing their utility for separatists. //TERRORIST ATTACKS IN NORTH AFRICA// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Deputy Political Director Costales asked [PER Gray  ] for the [LOC U.S.  ] assessment of the recent bombings in [LOC North Africa  ] . 
[PER Gray  ] said that the [MISC Algerian  ] attack clearly showed the adoption of [ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] tactics by the [LOC Maghreb  ] extremists , but the [LOC U.S.  ] has not yet found any link between the [LOC Algiers  ] and [LOC Casablanca  ] attacks , nor the thwarted attack in [LOC Tunisia  ] in January . 
[PER Iranzo  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] is very worried about these new developments given the extent of [MISC Spanish  ] interests in the two countries . 
He said [MISC Spanish  ] interests will be a target in the future in [LOC North Africa  ] . 
However , he also expressed hope that the public reaction to the attacks was perhaps evidence of a growing popular condemnation of such methods . 
He stated that while [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] claim to have good bilateral [LOC CT  ] cooperation , " there is undoubtedly a lot of room for improvement . 
" //PRESIDENT [PER ZAPATERO  ] INVESTED IN NORTH AFRICA// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Gray  ] also met with [PER Diego de Ojeda  ] , a foreign policy advisor to President [PER Zapatero  ] in the [MISC Spanish  ] equivalent of the national security council . 
[PER Ojeda  ] provided [MISC Spanish  ] political context , saying that [LOC Spain  ] is in favor of applying pressure on the parties , but given the [LOC Maghreb  ] 's geographic proximity , [LOC Spain  ] is also very wary of a potential return to violence . 
In addition , the [PER Zapatero  ] government is being criticized by both the left and the right for allegedly abandoning the traditional [MISC Spanish  ] stance of support for [MISC Sahrawi  ] independence . 
He said that President [PER Zapatero  ] has invested significant political capital in improving [LOC Spain  ] 's relations with [LOC North Africa  ] , and the [LOC Western Sahara  ] will remain a critical issue for the [ORG GOS  ] . 
He repeated [PER Iranzo  ] 's statement that [LOC Spain  ] is happy that the [LOC U.S.  ] is forcefully engaged on the issue . 
[LOC Algeria  ] 's recent message to [LOC Spain  ] has been that the [LOC Western Sahara  ] is not a " causus belli " with [LOC Morocco  ] , and he agreed that [MISC Polisario  ] engagement would depend on the amount of pressure exerted upon them. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On the [LOC North Africa  ] attacks , [PER de Ojeda  ] described the [MISC Algerian  ] attacks as evidence of a new " [MISC Al Qa'ida franchise  ] " in [LOC Algeria  ] , but not necessarily of a coordinated strategy across the [LOC Middle East  ] or even the [LOC Maghreb  ] . 
He assessed the threat to [LOC Spain  ] as very serious , given its proximity to [LOC North Africa  ] , the amount of trans-migration through [LOC Spain  ] , the ongoing March 11 trial , and the recent statements by [PER Ayman Al-Zawahiri  ] about reconquering [MISC Al-Andalus  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] [LOC North African  ] enclaves of [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] also remain a likely target , although [PER de Ojeda  ] speculated that extremists might not choose to attack there , as this would provoke a security lockdown that would take away one of their relatively safe havens in the [LOC EU.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 .
