End Summary. ---------------------- A Special Relationship ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In his first official visit to [LOC Russia  ] , PM [PER Netanyahu  ] met with President [PER Medvedev  ] and Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] as well as leaders from [LOC Russia  ] 's [MISC Jewish  ] community . 
Both sides described this as a productive visit with " frank but positive discussions . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Israeli  ] DCM [PER Roi Rosenblit  ] said [PER Netanyahu  ] 's visit emphasized the " special relationship " between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
He indicated that this the connection between the two countries has flourished in the past year . 
Thanks to visa free travel , 400,000 [MISC Russian  ] tourists travelled to [LOC Israel  ] in 2009. --------------------------------------------- -- Bilateral Economic and [MISC Cultural Ties Increasing  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Dmitri Lebedov  ] , Second Secretary in the [LOC MFA  ] 's [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Palestine Department  ] , there was some discussion of economic issues , including cooperation in nanotechnology , agriculture , tourism and banking . 
The [MISC Russian-Israeli  ] Bilateral Economic and [ORG Trade Commission  ] last met in November 2009 . 
The commission is planning another meeting in 2010 in [LOC Jersusalem  ] although a date has not yet been selected . 
[PER Lebedev  ] noted that [PER Putin  ] has agreed to visit [LOC Israel  ] in 2010. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Rosenblit  ] said both sides blamed the economic crisis for the decrease in bilateral trade in 2009 which affected [MISC Israeli  ] imports of both raw diamonds and petrochemicals . 
Both sides are looking for ways to diversify trade to include more agricultural products . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] noted that [LOC Russia  ] was very interested in attracting [MISC Israeli  ] investment , citing a bilateral agreement on industrial research and development which gives both governments the ability to finance joint start-ups. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Elaborating on economics issues , [PER Rosenblit  ] said that [PER Netanyahu  ] and [PER Putin  ] discussed energy issues . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] had discussed with [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] the possibility of extending to [LOC Israel  ] a gas pipeline but this proposal became unnecessary after [LOC Israel  ] found offshore gas reserves in [LOC Haifa  ] . 
Although [ORG Gazprom  ] is still interested in building facilities in [LOC Haifa  ] and aiding in distribution , [PER Rosenblit  ] said this was now a question for the private sector . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] also claimed that an agreement was reached to launch a bilateral agricultural business forum in [LOC Moscow  ] , possibly in March 2010 . 
This would also be a private effort , but under governmental auspices . 
He also said that there was some discussion about future outer space cooperation for peaceful purposes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Rosenblit  ] claimed that the 65th anniversary of [MISC World War II  ] and Holocaust remembrance were high on the agenda . 
He said that both the [ORG GOI  ] and the [ORG GOR  ] are unhappy with recent attempts to revise the history of these events . 
He noted that a Holocaust Museum will be built in [LOC Russia  ] and a commemorative site recognizing the [ORG Red Army  ] 's role in WWII will be constructed in [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] also said that PM [PER Putin  ] invited President [PER Peres  ] to the May 9 [MISC Victory Day  ] ceremonies in [LOC Moscow  ] later this year . 
Medevedev also reportedly green lighted the idea of a cultural program including a " Year of [LOC Russia  ] in [LOC Israel  ] " and " Year of [LOC Israel  ] in [LOC Russia  ] " exchange. ------------------------------------------- [LOC Middle East Peace  ] Not High on Either [PER Agenda  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to [PER Rosenblit  ] , [ORG MEPP  ] was not thoroughly discussed and he " doubted that the [ORG Moscow Conference  ] specifically was mentioned . 
" [PER Rosenblit  ] also downplayed the [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000392 002 OF 003 recent visits of [PER Abbas  ] and [PER Meshaal  ] and the importance attached to them by the [MISC Russians  ] . 
He said that he believed [LOC Georgia  ] was of greater importance to [LOC Russia  ] than [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] or [LOC Palestine.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Rosenblit  ] said that [PER Netanyahu  ] emphasized his openness to talks between the [ORG GOR  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] because he welcomed any way to bring them back to negotiations . 
" We wanted everyone to tell [MISC Abbas  ] to return to negotiations because we can't give him a deal until he sits down . 
" He noted that [LOC Israel  ] prefers direct contacts but supports any kind of negotiations . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] still insists on talks without preconditions and no interim agreements: " Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed . 
" [PER Rosenblit  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] supported [LOC Russia  ] 's efforts to achieve comprehensive negotiations including [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Lebanon.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Referring to the recent visit to [LOC Moscow  ] of [PER Khaled Meshaal  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] told his interlocutors that [ORG Hamas  ] should not be legitimized by other countries . 
Although [PER Meshaal  ] had only a 15 minute meeting with [ORG Lavrov  ] , it received significant coverage in the media . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] said [PER Medvedev  ] asked what [LOC Russia  ] could do to help with [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] repeated that [LOC Israel  ] does not see [ORG Hamas  ] as a legitimate partner but would use the [MISC Russia-Hamas  ] channel to discuss humanitarian issues such as the proposed prisoner swap for IDF soldier [PER Gilad Shalit.  ] ------------------------ Closer than Ever on [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Lebedov  ] sought to downplay discussions of [LOC Iran  ] saying that , while it was discussed , other bilateral issues took up most of the discussions. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Rosenblit  ] , however , claimed that [LOC Iran  ] was clearly at the top of [LOC Israel  ] 's agenda for this visit . 
He said [PER Netanyahu  ] was " keen to form a group of like-minded parties " who recognized the danger of [LOC Iran  ] 's program and would cooperate to stop its " militant nuclearlization . 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] emphasized that [LOC Israel  ] believes that once [LOC Iran  ] has nuclear capabilities , other regional powers will immediately seek their own nuclear weapons . 
Because of this danger , and the threat from [LOC Tehran  ] itself , [PER Netanyahu  ] urged [LOC Russia  ] to cooperate on tougher sanctions against [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The [MISC Israeli  ] side , according to [PER Rosenblit  ] , was pleasantly surprised at [LOC Russia  ] 's harsh tone on [LOC Iran  ] which had changed dramatically even since [PER FM Lieberman  ] 's visit in November . 
" We heard words from them that we 've never heard before , " [PER Rosenblit  ] claimed , " and we aren't hearing the same old arguments . 
" [PER Rosenblit  ] credited this change to the [MISC Iranians  ] themselves , saying that their rejection of the [ORG TRR  ] proposal and their decision to enrich to 20 percent had toughened [LOC Russia  ] 's stance on [LOC Iran  ] . 
He remarked that just a few months ago , there was concern in [LOC Israel  ] that [LOC Iran  ] would divide the international community , but [LOC Iran  ] 's actions have only served as a unifying factor . 
" [LOC Russia  ] 's understanding of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue is closer to ours than it was a few months ago . 
" -------------------------- Ready to Discuss Sanctions -------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) On the issue of sanctions , [PER Netanyahu  ] reportedly handed the [ORG GOR  ] a list of areas where [LOC Israel  ] felt sanctions could affect change in [LOC Iran  ] 's behavior . 
The list included restrictions on [MISC Iranian  ] exports of energy products ; [MISC Iranian  ] imports of refined petroleum products ; the financial and banking sectors ; and , shipping and aerospace companies . 
He noted that , while [LOC Russia  ] was ready to discuss sanctions , the two did not necessarily see eye to eye on the specifics . 
Both sides did agree , however , that the [ORG UNSC  ] had to agree on sanctions . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] said that [MISC Russian  ] officials do not believe that unilateral sanctions will have the desired effect . 
They believe that the international community has to maintain united and either agree to impose or not impose sanctions. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] encouraged [LOC Russia  ] to be an example for [LOC China  ] regarding sanctions . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] said both [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Russia  ] had been working bilaterally with [LOC China  ] to convince them that it was time for a serious discussion on sanctions. --------------------------------------------- -- [ORG S-300s: No Quid Pro Quo  ] , but We Trust Medevedev --------------------------------------------- -- [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000392 003 OF 003 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) When asked about media reports citing [PER Netanyahu  ] himself which suggested that [LOC Israel  ] had agreed not to restart arms deals with [LOC Georgia  ] in exchange for [LOC Russia  ] 's continued inaction on the [MISC S-300s  ] contract with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Lebedov  ] noted that , in spite of this statement , there had been no change in the [ORG GOR  ] 's policy . 
He claimed that fulfillment of the [MISC S-300s  ] contract remained a political decision . 
He remarked that the [MISC S-300  ] system was itself defensive in nature and could not be used against another party , such as [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Rosenblit  ] also would not acknowledge that a deal had been made . 
Instead , he said that [PER Netanyahu  ] had reiterated his trust in [PER Medvedev  ] regarding the [MISC S-300s  ] . 
According to [PER Rosenblit  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] believes that [LOC Russia  ] has taken " all aspects of regional stability " into account when taking decisions on the [MISC S-300s  ] . 
[PER Rosenblit  ] did note that the [MISC S-300s  ] issue offered a window onto the different vectors in [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy , with the contradictory statements that their delivery was imminent , and the delay being caused by technical and political issues , coming just days before [PER Netanyahu  ] 's visit. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Rosenblit  ] said that neither [LOC Russia  ] nor [LOC Israel  ] was linking the [MISC S-300  ] issue with arms sales to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] , he claimed , as a [MISC Russian  ] partner , was " listening attentively " to [LOC Russia  ] 's concerns about weapons supplies to [LOC Georgia  ] and the effects this could have in the region . 
[LOC Israel  ] has friendly relations with [LOC Georgia  ] but the [MISC Russian  ] relationship was also very important , he said . 
He indicated that both sides were trying to come to an " understanding . 
" <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC Russian  ] media built up the Prime Minster 's visit as the final stage of [LOC Russia  ] 's [MISC Abbas-Meshaal-Netanyahu  ] trifecta of [LOC Middle East  ] callers . 
While both sides paid lip-service to [ORG MEPP  ] issues , [LOC Iran  ] was the main agenda item . 
This reflects [PER Netanyahu  ] 's priorities and the [ORG GOR  ] 's belief that it is [LOC Washington  ] 's job , not [LOC Moscow  ] 's , to pressure the [MISC Israelis  ] on [ORG MEPP  ] issues . 
[LOC Israel  ] came away pleased with [LOC Russia  ] 's changed posture on [LOC Iran  ] , but disappointed that its list of sanctions was too ambitious for the [ORG GOR  ] . 
Separately , the widely reported " quid-pro-quo " on a mutual freeze of the [MISC Russian  ] [MISC S-300  ] delivery for [LOC Iran  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] military sales to [LOC Georgia  ] could be a convenient [MISC Israeli  ] invention . 
While [MISC Israeli  ] contacts say there is no formal deal , [PER Netanyahu  ] 's statements to the media created enough speculation to put [LOC Russia  ] in a corner . 
Should [LOC Moscow  ] eventually deliver the system to [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Israel  ] has a pretext to step up arms sales to [LOC Georgia  ] .
