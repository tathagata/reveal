[PER Menon Tough  ] on [LOC Pakistan  ] , Bullish on Bilateral Relationship - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a meeting January 8 , Foreign Secretary [PER Shivshankar Menon  ] discussed with visiting Assistant Secretary for [LOC South  ] and [ORG Central Asian Affairs  ] [PER Richard Boucher  ] and Ambassador [PER Mulford  ] issues including the [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorist attack investigations , developments in [LOC Pakistan  ] , End Use Monitoring ( [ORG EUM  ] ) , next steps in civil nuclear cooperation , and the bilateral relationship in the context of the [LOC U.S.  ] political transition . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] Has Taken “No Irrevocable [PER Steps” Post-Mumbai  ] - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) [PER Boucher  ] recounted for [PER Menon  ] his impressions from his visit to [MISC Paksitan  ] ( ref A ) , that [PER Zardari  ] and [PER Gailani  ] were committed to ridding the county of terrorism and had made real strides with the terrorist groups operating in the tribal areas , but that they now understood they also had to tackle [MISC Punjabi-based  ] groups like [LOC Lashkar-e-Tayiba  ] , which was much more difficult. “We’re not giving them any breaks: they must eliminate [LOC Lashkar-e-Tayiba  ] , ” [PER Boucher  ] stressed , adding that it would require persistence . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] hoped to encourage a continuous flow of information , but [LOC Pakistan  ] still prefered the mechanism to be a high-level dialogue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) [PER Menon  ] replied that [LOC Pakistan  ] was “nowhere near the threshold of proving sincerity” in its response to the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks and had so far taken no “irrevocable” steps toward eliminating [LOC Lashkar-e-Tayiba  ] as a threat to [LOC India  ] . 
His worry was that the problem was “more basic , ” that the civilian government was incaable of taking action against [ORG Lashkar  ] and the military had not yet made the strategic shift required to do so . 
He recounted that [PER Jaish-e-Mohammad  ] was NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000048 002 OF 004 behind the assassination attempt on former [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Musharraf  ] in 2003 , but even that did not move the [MISC Pakistani  ] Army to crack down ; the group remains operational and has grown more lethal . 
Furthermore , compared to the [PER Musharraf  ] era , the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army was “not responsible right now , ” according to [PER Menon  ] , who cited provocations such as cease-fire violations . 
[LOC India  ] Focused on [LOC Pakistani Military  ] , Dismissive of [LOC Civilian Government  ] - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) [PER Boucher  ] observed that while [LOC India  ] had begun targeting pressure against [MISC Pakistani  ] security services , the [LOC U.S.  ] had decided to work through the civilian government . 
[PER Boucher  ] cautioned that recent statements claiming links between [MISC Pakistani  ] security services and the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks made cooperation more difficult , as did some [MISC Indian  ] military movements that , though limited , were enough to be noticed . 
[PER Boucher  ] said [LOC Pakistan  ] had a democratic government committed to eliminating terrorism , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] would hold them to it . 
[PER Menon  ] pointed out that [LOC India  ] deliberately had not taken action that would undercut the civilian government or impact the [MISC Pakistani  ] people , such as cutting trade , travel , or diplomatic representation . 
But [PER Menon  ] warned , “You’re setting the civilians up for a fall . 
If you raise expectations of increased civilian power , the military will knock them down.” Furthermore , an [MISC Indian  ] embrace of the civilian government would be “the kiss of death.” [PER Menon  ] concluded , “Honestly I do not think the civilian government can solve the problem ; the military must choose to act.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) [PER Boucher  ] shared that the [LOC U.S.  ] had not reached the conclusion that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] security services were directly involved in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks and asked [PER Menon  ] to “tone down” the public pressure . 
Provoking the [LOC Pakistan  ] military made constructive cooperation less likely . 
[PER Menon  ] replied , “What we have seen so far leads us to the opposite conclusion.” ( Asked about evidence , [PER Menon  ] added that India’s conclusion was “based on inference.” ) The political moment was such that the [ORG Pakistani Security Services  ] could make a fundamental shift away from support to terrorist groups if they so chose , but they had not done so. “Let’s not insult one another by telling a story that the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army was not involved , ” said [PER Menon  ] . 
The [LOC Pakistan  ] Army paid wages to [LOC Lashkar-e-Tayiba  ] and sustained the organization , and until these ties were severed , [LOC India  ] would continue to regard the [MISC Pakistani  ] security services as complicit in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
[PER Menon  ] concluded , “They’re either unwilling to take action , or incapable , or both ; any way you look at it , they’re involved.” Good Progress on Preventing Further Attacks - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/REL UK  ] ) [PER Menon  ] agreed that important progress was being made on prevention of further terrorist attacks , with good cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] He remarked that there was no popular resistance to the idea of [ORG FBI  ] involvement in the [LOC Mumbai  ] investigations . 
He agreed with [PER Boucher  ] that [LOC India  ] could work with the [LOC United States  ] to make itself safer regardless of [LOC Pakistan  ] , but he stressed that unless the [LOC Mumbai  ] perpetrators were brought to justice it will happen again . 
[PER Menon  ] concluded , “We have a huge confluence of interests , and as long as that exists we will work together.” [PER Boucher  ] assured [PER Menon  ] that [LOC India  ] could rely on the [LOC U.S.  ] to keep up the pressure on [LOC Pakistan  ] ; [PER Menon  ] replied , “And you can count on our pressure on you to help you do it.” End Use [LOC Monitoring: India  ] “Ready For a Deal” NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000048 003.2 OF 004 - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Asked whether [LOC India  ] was “ready for a deal” on End Use Monitoring ( [ORG EUM  ] ) , [PER Menon  ] replied emphatically , “Yes.” He added that he thought a deal was close , but that it would require “sitting at a table and finding a solution that is neither yours nor ours . 
We can do it.” He added that [ORG EUM  ] was important to [LOC India  ] and that he hoped for a deal “as quickly as possible.” Progress With [ORG Energy Agency  ] , But Nervous About [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Nonpro Policy  ] - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] shared that the government was ready to sign its [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) [ORG Safeguards Agreement  ] and expected to do so “by the end of the month.” Negotiations with the [ORG Agency  ] on an Additional Protocol were likewise scheduled to begin at the end of January . 
[PER Menon  ] expected the next Parliament to take up the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for [MISC Nuclear Damage  ] ( [ORG CSC  ] ) . 
( [PER Comment: Menon  ] did not mention the possibility of bypassing Parliament raised by External Affairs Minister [PER Mukherjee  ] , reported ref B . 
) [PER Menon  ] said the government had “rescheduled” a decision about designating a nuclear reactor park site for [LOC U.S.  ] firms and that it would not be made in time for the January 11-16 visit of the [ORG U.S.-India Business Council  ] ( [ORG USIBC  ] ) civil nuclear delegation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] confided that many people in [LOC India  ] were “nervous” about nonproliferation policy under the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration . 
He hoped for an early , quiet conversation with the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration , saying , “The world has changed in the past eight years , and we need to be sure we share updated views.” [PER Boucher  ] and Ambassador [PER Mulford  ] stressed the bipartisan support for the [ORG Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement  ] as evidence that both political parties were aware of the changed environment . 
Bilateral Relationship: Seeking The Next Big Idea - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] and [PER Menon  ] discussed a variety of bilateral issues in the context of the [LOC U.S.  ] political transition . 
[PER Menon  ] agreed that the papers exchanged with Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] outlining bilateral issues ripe for progress were “very congruent , almost the same.” [PER Menon  ] stressed the importance of focusing on issues with popular appeal . 
Many good things were happening on health , education , and agriculture , according to [PER Menon  ] , but nothing that “captures the imagination.” [MISC Indians  ] were beginning to view the relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] as only about political-military and nuclear issues. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] challenged [PER Menon  ] to think about formulating “the next big idea” to frame the bilateral relationship for the next several years . 
[PER Boucher  ] suggested that one direction might be toward popular issues , such as agriculture and energy , while another might be toward global issues , such as the environment and trade . 
Ambassador [PER Mulford  ] suggested that [LOC India  ] might leverage its position amid the global financial crisis by elevating its stature in the international financial architecture . 
[PER Menon  ] agreed , but cautioned that for the moment the issue of [LOC Pakistan  ] had become defining . 
[PER Menon  ] said he was very keen on an early visit by the next Secretary of State , but had not been sure who to ask. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Assistant Secretary [PER Boucher  ] cleared this message .
