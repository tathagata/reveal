Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) On December 21 , [ORG MFA Americas Department  ] Deputy Director General [PER Ding Xiaowen  ] summoned Acting PolMinCouns to receive a formal response to a December 10 letter from Ambassador [PER Huntsman  ] to Foreign Minister [PER Yang Jiechi  ] raising [ORG USG  ] concerns about the detention of [ORG Charter  ] 08 drafter [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] and other human rights issues. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Noting that he would attempt to refrain from " becoming emotional , " Deputy Director General [PER Ding Xiaowen  ] told Acting PolMinCouns that [LOC China  ] was strongly dissatisfied and registered its firm opposition to Ambassador [PER Huntsman  ] 's letter and to his December 9 meeting with human rights lawyers ( reftel ) . 
DDG [PER Ding  ] asserted that , during his meeting with [PER Jiang Tianyong  ] and four other rights lawyers , Ambassador [PER Huntsman  ] had said he would make representations to [LOC China  ] to safeguard the freedom of religion and legal rights of [MISC Chinese  ] citizens . 
In addition , the Ambassador had made inappropriate comments in his letter to FM [PER Yang  ] on the handling of specific human rights cases including those of [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] and [PER Huang Qi  ] . 
[LOC China  ] was firmly opposed to these actions , DDG [PER Ding  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) DDG [PER Ding  ] said that in recent years [LOC China  ] had made " huge progress on human rights " and that all its citizens were equal before the law . 
In that context , if persons violated the law they should be brought to justice , no matter who they were or what the situation . 
Certain " so-called " human rights lawyers and dissidents had sought to advance their " selfish interests " by attacking the [MISC Chinese  ] government . 
It was inappropriate and unacceptable for the Ambassador to meet with these types of people , [PER Ding  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] was a country " ruled by law " and the cases in question would be handled according to law , DDG [PER Ding  ] continued . 
The [LOC United States  ] had no right to " point fingers " at [LOC China  ] and interfere in its internal affairs . 
The bilateral human rights dialogue would take place in February and would serve to deepen mutual understanding and reduce differences between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] on the basis of equality , mutual trust and noninterference in internal affairs , DDG said . 
In order to avoid harm to bilateral relations , [LOC China  ] called on the [LOC United States  ] to respect [LOC China  ] 's judicial sovereignty and to cease using human rights as an excuse to " meddle " in [LOC China  ] 's internal affairs. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Acting PolMinCouns noted that the Ambassador 's letter reflected the degree of [ORG USG  ] concern over the cases of [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] , [PER Huang Qi  ] and others . 
He further noted that , as the Secretary had made clear in her December 14 speech , human rights remained a key component of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy . 
Human rights had also been addressed in the joint statement by President [PER Obama  ] and President [PER Hu  ] with both sides acknowledging internationally recognized rights . 
The cases of [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] and [PER Huang Qi  ] were clear violations of those internationally recognized norms . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] was willing to address these issues quietly through diplomatic channels , little progress had been achieved and [LOC China  ] had not acknowledged [LOC U.S.  ] concerns . 
A/PolMinCouns affirmed that the Ambassador would continue to meet freely with a range of [MISC Chinese  ] citizens. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a lengthy and disjointed digression , DDG [PER Ding  ] noted that he had formerly been Ambassador to [LOC Botswana  ] and recounted his conversations with the [LOC Botswana  ] Foreign Minister who told him that the most fundamental human rights were the right to food and shelter . 
While it was true that there are fundamental rights of religion , speech and assembly , [PER Ding  ] said , " we must not forget the right of human dignity and the pursuit of happiness . 
" In this area it was " a basic fact " that the [LOC PRC  ] had made huge progress in the basic welfare of the [MISC Chinese  ] people . 
DDG [PER Ding  ] suggested that the [LOC United States  ] had not come to [LOC China  ] 's aid in this respect when it had declined to provide spare parts for Blackhawk helicopters to assist with relief efforts in the aftermath of the [LOC Sichuan  ] earthquake . 
Repeating that human rights cases could be " emotional , " DDG [PER Ding  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] should seek to understand [LOC China  ] 's position through dialogue. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A/PolMinCouns replied that the [LOC United States  ] agreed that dialogue was important and would continue to address human rights issue through bilateral consultations . 
However , [LOC U.S.  ] concerns over abuses of internally recognized human rights norms remained . 
A/PolMinCouns also pointed out that during relief efforts after the [LOC Sichuan  ] earthquake , the [LOC United States  ] , in addition to the other relief assistance it [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003416 002 OF 002 had provided , had offered to arrange airlift support for [LOC China  ] , an offer which [LOC China  ] had rejected .
