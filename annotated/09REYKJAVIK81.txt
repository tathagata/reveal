( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) came away with a clear victory in parliamentary elections on April 25 , winning nearly 30 percent of the vote . 
The [ORG SDA  ] now holds a commanding position in coalition talks , as their [MISC Left-Green  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) partners in the current minority government suffered a last-minute fade and slipped to third behind the conservative [ORG Independence Party  ] . 
A surprisingly strong performance by two other pro-EU parties means the [ORG SDA  ] could abandon the [ORG LG  ] in favor of an " [ORG EU Government  ] , " and [PER Sigurdardottir  ] is plainly using this fact as leverage in negotiations with the [MISC Euro-skeptic Left-Greens  ] . 
Although the [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG LG  ] will probably stay together to create [LOC Iceland  ] 's first leftist majority government , the [ORG LG  ] will likely be forced to move towards [LOC Brussels  ] . 
Though the [ORG LG  ] may demand some concessions in exchange , these are likely to be on domestic welfare and economic issues rather than foreign affairs , which are problematic given the [ORG LG  ] 's anti-NATO platform . 
Aware that time is on their side , the [ORG SDA  ] will probably drag out the announcement of a new government to ratchet up the pressure on their would-be partners . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) As anticipated , [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) came away from national parliamentary elections on April 25 with the largest share of the vote . 
In its best performance since its founding a decade ago , Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] 's party won just shy of 30 percent of the vote and will hold 20 seats in the 63-member [ORG Althingi  ] . 
[PER Sigurdardottir  ] proclaimed the results a clear signal that the public trusts the [ORG SDA  ] to pull [LOC Iceland  ] out of its economic difficulties , while also claiming that the [ORG SDA  ] 's desire to apply for [ORG EU  ] membership played a key role . 
The [ORG SDA  ] focused its message almost entirely on the [ORG EU  ] question in the final three days of the campaign , arguing that the simple act of applying for membership would bring needed credibility to [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery efforts. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Saturday 's results were an unwelcome surprise for [ORG Finance  ] , [ORG Agriculture  ] and Fisheries Minister [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] 's [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) , which lost nearly six percent from the final pre-election opinion polls . 
Although the [ORG LG  ] 's 22 percent share of the vote increases their [ORG Althingi  ] delegation from nine seats to 14 , the party had clearly hoped for more and struggled to spin the results as a victory rather than a disappointment . 
Commentators were quick to remind that the [ORG LG  ] has historically suffered from last-minute electoral collapses , and pointed to several ill-advised statements by [MISC Left-Green  ] ministers in the waning days of the campaign . 
[ORG Party Chair  ] [PER Sigfusson  ] reportedly said at an event on April 23 that leading airline [ORG Icelandair  ] might have to be nationalized , then quickly backtracked via a [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] press release , while Minister of [ORG Environment Kolbrun Halldorsdottir  ] criticized oil exploration efforts in the [ORG Dreka Region  ] off [LOC Iceland  ] 's northeast coast and said the country should explore wind power instead . 
Taken together , the statements may have raised doubts in voters' minds about the [ORG LG  ] 's long-term abilities to rebuild [LOC Iceland  ] 's economy . 
The party 's downturn was particularly hard on [ORG MinEnv Halldorsdottir  ] , who was not reelected to parliament. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Combined with the [MISC Left-Green  ] collapse , three other parties defied expectations . 
The conservative [ORG Independence Party  ] , though clearly suffering voters' wrath over the economic collapse and government breakdown in January , did slightly better than anticipated and only fell to second place behind the [ORG SDA  ] . 
The [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , which struggled for much of the spring to find a compelling campaign narrative , nonetheless managed to gain three percentage points over the final pre-election polls and adding two MPs . 
Combined with the surprising run of the new [ORG Citizens' Movement  ] , which took four [ORG Althingi  ] seats in its maiden campaign effort , the [MISC Progressives'  ] success may actually reflect a growing preference for [ORG EU  ] membership more than anything else . 
Both the [ORG PP  ] and [ORG Citizens' Movement  ] have endorsed [ORG EU  ] accession as a solution to [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic woes , and as such may have benefitted from the [ORG SDA  ] 's focus on the issue and the [ORG LG  ] 's push-back from [LOC Brussels.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Final election results were as follows , with comparison to the 2007 elections: [ORG SDA  ] = [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] IP = [ORG Independence Party  ] [ORG LG  ] = [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] PP = [ORG Progressive Party  ] CM = [ORG Citizens' Movement LP  ] = [ORG Liberal Party  ] MD = [ORG Movement for Democracy Party Percent MPs Change  ] ( MPs ) [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000081 002 OF 002 [ORG SDA  ] 29.8 20 +2 IP 23.7 16 -9 [ORG LG  ] 21.7 14 +5 [ORG PP  ] 14.8 9 +2 CM 7.2 4 -- [ORG LP  ] 2.2 0 -4 MD 0.6 0 -- [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) has 63 members. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Party chairs began staking out their negotiating positions immediately , with [ORG SDA Chair  ] [PER Sigurdardottir  ] announcing simultaneously that she would be happy to see the [ORG SDA-LG  ] government continue , but also that a majority had voted for pro-EU parties and that the new government needed to reflect this . 
The [ORG LG  ] instead chose to spin the results as a nationwide move to the left and an endorsement of the current government 's economic policies , with [ORG LG Chair  ] [PER Sigfusson  ] going so far as to say on a Sunday night roundtable that only [LOC Iceland  ] 's " elite " wants [ORG EU  ] membership . 
[ORG Progressive Chair  ] Sigmundur [PER David Gunnlaugsson  ] , meanwhile , tried to avoid sounding desperate as he enthusiastically backed [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's suggestion that an [MISC SDA-PP-CM  ] majority could coalesce around the objective of an [ORG EU  ] membership bid. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Coalition talks began on the afternoon of April 26 , with PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] and [ORG LG Chair  ] [PER Sigfusson  ] meeting at [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's residence for informal discussions . 
[PER Sigurdardottir  ] said after the talks that they had covered the policies of the parties in general , including their positions on [ORG EU  ] membership . 
At the televised post-elections roundtable later that night , both [PER Sigurdardottir  ] and [PER Sigfusson  ] admitted that the [ORG EU  ] membership question was the most difficult issue that the [ORG SDA  ] and the [ORG LG  ] had to solve in their coalition negotiations . 
The [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG LG  ] parliamentary groups will meet today where the party leaders will seek a mandate from their respective parties to continue the coalition talks . 
From a technical perspective , PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] still holds the mandate to lead the government . 
As such , the [ORG SDA  ] and the [ORG LG  ] do not have to meet with the President of [LOC Iceland  ] to renew their mandate , but [PER Sigurdardottir  ] will do so out of courtesy on the afternoon of April <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Looking ahead , the [ORG SDA  ] will use the electoral results as leverage to force the [ORG LG  ] to come around on the [ORG EU  ] question . 
[ORG SDA  ] parliamentarians have underscored the importance of applying for [ORG EU  ] membership and are not keen on budging from that stance . 
Additionally , there is now a parliamentary majority for [ORG EU  ] membership given that the [ORG SDA  ] , the [ORG PP  ] , the [ORG Citizens' Movement  ] , and even a portion of IP MPs are willing to start accession negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
This puts the [ORG LG  ] in a very difficult negotiating position. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment , cont 'd : Given the [MISC Left-Greens'  ] evident desire to be part of [LOC Iceland  ] 's first leftist majority government , they will be under great pressure to yield to [ORG SDA  ] demands on the [ORG EU  ] question . 
In exchange , they may demand some face-saving concessions , most likely on economic , welfare , or environmental issues . 
This could mean a more difficult landscape for would-be investors in heavy industry , e.g. aluminum . 
However , there are few indications that the [MISC Left-Greens  ] will press on core foreign policy issues , such as their desire for [LOC Iceland  ] 's withdrawal from [ORG NATO  ] . 
[ORG LG  ] insiders have noted to post that the party 's foreign policy is lacking in depth , and that a push on foreign policy priorities would likely reveal splits between pacifist and neutralist elements within the [ORG LG  ] . 
In any event , time is on the [ORG SDA  ] 's side , and we anticipate that [PER Sigurdardottir  ] may draw out coalition talks as a way of increasing public pressure on the [ORG LG  ] to give on the [ORG EU  ] membership issue .
