( U ) In separate meetings , poloff delivered ref A points outlining continued [ORG USG  ] interest in concluding an [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement with [LOC Brazil  ] to Ministry of Foreign Relations ( [ORG MRE  ] ) [ORG U.S.-Canada Division  ] Chief [PER Paulo Alvarenga  ] and to [ORG MRE  ] [ORG United Nations Division  ] Chief [PER Carlos Duarte  ] . 
Both [PER Alvarenga  ] and [PER Duarte  ] had participated in the May [MISC U.S.-Brazil Pol-Mil  ] bilaterals ( ref B ) and were familiar with the [ORG Article  ] 98 issue . 
[PER Alvarenga  ] deferred comment to [PER Duarte  ] , whose office has the lead on [ORG Article  ] 98. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Referring to the [ORG Article  ] 98 discussions during the May bilaterals , [PER Duarte  ] reiterated [LOC Brazil  ] 's strong support for the [ORG ICC  ] -- a position reflected , he said , in domestic public opinion . 
Because of this depth of commitment , [LOC Brazil  ] would not undermine its " [ORG ICC  ] membership obligations . 
" However , [LOC Brazil  ] 's own loyalty to the [ORG ICC  ] , [PER Duarte  ] felt , did not preclude the possibility that a mutually-acceptable alternative to an [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement could be found . 
Repeating a long-standing [ORG GOB  ] position , [PER Duarte  ] commented that neither he nor his superiors could conceive of any occasion where [LOC Brazil  ] would subject [LOC U.S.  ] citizens on [MISC Brazilian  ] soil to [ORG ICC  ] jurisdiction . 
He added that there was a perception in [LOC Brazil  ] of excessive [ORG USG  ] militancy towards the [ORG ICC  ] , although [ORG USG  ] concerns that led to this position were clearly understood by the [ORG GOB  ] . 
He said he hoped the [LOC United States  ] , in the future , would be less confrontational towards the [LOC Court.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] , he emphasized , remained eager to work out a solution . 
He suggested the [ORG USG  ] consider submission of another proposal with a modified text referring exclusively to [LOC U.S.  ] military and official personnel rather than [MISC American  ] citizens . 
[PER Poloff  ] responded that , with ninety [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements already signed with various nations the [ORG USG  ] probably would not consider much alteration of the standard [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement text . 
[PER Poloff  ] added that senior [ORG USG  ] policymakers remained keenly focused on this issue and would not be reluctant to raise it in meetings with their [MISC Brazilian  ] counterparts. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: [LOC Brazil  ] 's commitment to the [ORG ICC  ] is genuine and robust , but [ORG MRE  ] officials do not want conflict with us over the [ORG Article  ] 98 issue -- they understand clearly our specific national concerns and also worry about a [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal over time from international peacekeeping because of those concerns . 
[PER Duarte  ] 's comments above suggest the [ORG GOB  ] wants to leave the door open to some sort of compromise , and [ORG GOB  ] assurances that under no imaginable scenario would [MISC American  ] citizens be extradited from [LOC Brazil  ] to the [ORG ICC  ] appear sincere . 
The question then emerges as to what form a compromise might take -- options might include a specific bilateral agreement that accomplishes our goals but does so outside the standard [ORG Article  ] 98 format , or inserting non-extradition language into a broader [ORG DCA  ] or [ORG SOFA  ] document were [LOC Brazil  ] to demonstrate openess to negotiating such bilateral agreements . 
Such options would not be easy , quick or certain to succeed , but they may merit further consideration .
