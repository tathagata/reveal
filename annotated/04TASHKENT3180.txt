<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L TASHKENT 003180 DEPT FOR EUR/CACEN EO 12958 DECL: 11/17/14 TAGS PBIO , PINR , UZ SUBJECT: [ORG FIRST DAUGHTER  ] LOLA ( [PER KARIMOVA  ] ) CUTS LOSE CLASSIFIED BY AMB . 
[ORG JON R. PURNELL  ] , FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B , D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) For at least the past month , the youngest of President [PER Islom Karimov’s  ] three children , 26-year old [PER Lola Karimova  ] , has been frequenting restaurant/club [LOC Barkhan  ] ( “shifting sand dune” ) on a near nightly basis . 
On November 13 , we once again ran into the [ORG First Daughter  ] at this location . 
During this encounter , she identified one of the men in her booth to poloff as her boyfriend and confirmed the club was hers. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Karimova  ] typically arrives in her -- one-of-a- kind , for [LOC Tashkent  ] -- [PER Porsche Cayenne S Sports Utility Vehicle  ] around ten o’clock for the traditional floorshow and stays until the wee hours dancing the night away in the raucous disco . 
On occasion , her older sister , [PER Gulnora  ] , joins her around three o’clock in the morning . 
Taking her prominently reserved booth amidst all the action and protected by four bodyguards , [PER Lola Karimova  ] drinks a fair amount of alcohol and dances freely while 28-year old [LOC Barkhan  ] proprietor “Timur” and [PER Ms. Karimova’s  ] thuggish-looking boyfriend also serve to keep potential dance partners at bay. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Lola Karimova  ] , who reportedly also owns chic [LOC Tashkent  ] nightclub [LOC Basha  ] , would appear to favor her new club , the [LOC Barkhan  ] . 
It remains unclear whether she is the owner by appropriation/hostile takeover , or whether she reached a partnership agreement with “Timur , ” who is rumored to own the popular restaurant [ORG Karavan  ] , as well . 
Considering the plethora of foreign contractors , diplomats , and [ORG First Family  ] members who habitually attend the [LOC Barkhan  ] , the securQis astonishingly light . 
[LOC Barkhan  ] ownership is obviously well connected , as it’s the only place in town that flaunts selling non-Uzbekistan produced hard alcohol , which is against the law .
