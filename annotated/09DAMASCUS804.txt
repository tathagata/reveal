Classified By: CDA [PER Charles Hunter  ] , Reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [LOC Syria  ] 's determined support of [ORG Hizballah  ] 's military build-up , particularly the steady supply of longer-range rockets and the introduction of guided missiles , could change the military balance and produce a scenario significantly more destructive than the July-August 2006 war . 
If rockets were to rain down on [MISC Israeli  ] civilians in [LOC Tel Aviv  ] , [LOC Israel  ] would still have powerful incentives , as it did in 2006 , to keep [LOC Syria  ] out of the conflict , but it might also face compelling reasons for targeting [ORG Hizballah  ] facilities in [LOC Syria  ] , some of which are in and around populated areas . 
[LOC Syria  ] 's current strategic mindset appears to assume [LOC Syria  ] could avoid involvement in a new conflict , based largely on its 2006 experience . 
[MISC Syrian  ] leaders also appear convinced that arming [ORG Hizballah  ] will increase [LOC Syria  ] 's leverage in bringing [LOC Israel  ] to the negotiating table . 
As [LOC Washington  ] weighs how to approach [MISC Syrian  ] officials in upcoming engagement efforts , discussing [ORG Hizballah  ] from the perspective of the regional strategic landscape may help to facilitate a " big picture " conversation in which we could challenge these assumptions and focus [LOC Damascus  ] on the importance of taking cooperative steps with the [LOC U.S.  ] now . 
Though raising this subject could well distract from a cooperative approach that shows signs of progress after months of investment , we believe sounding a warning , probably in a one-one-on meeting with President [PER Asad  ] , would be worth considering in pursuit of a broader , more strategic dialogue . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------- Is the [MISC Strategic Balance Changing  ] ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Syria  ] 's determined efforts to re-arm [ORG Hizballah  ] during and after the July-August 2006 war between [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] have consistently grabbed [MISC Israeli  ] headlines , most recently with [MISC Israeli  ] Chief of [PER Staff Ashkenazi  ] 's November 10 revelation that [ORG Hizballah  ] possessed 320-kilometer range rockets . 
[ORG Jane  ] 's [ORG Defense Weekly  ] reported October 28 on [ORG Hizballah  ] 's deployment of the first guided surface-to-surface [ORG M600  ] missile on [MISC Lebanese  ] soil , with a range of 250 kilometers and circular error probability of 500 meters . 
Public estimates put [ORG Hizballah  ] 's stockpile as high as 40,000 rockets and missiles , reinforcing assessments by some experts that this build-up may portend a shift in the military balance between [LOC Israel  ] and its northern nemesis . 
[ORG Hizballah  ] [PER SecGen Nasrallah  ] 's recent claims of possessing a capability to " destroy " the [ORG IDF  ] may overstate the case for domestic and regional propaganda purposes , but reporting in other channels confirms [PER Nasrallah  ] 's bragging on November 11 that [ORG Hizballah  ] can sustain fire on [LOC Tel Aviv  ] and reach " all of [LOC Israel  ] . 
" This capability , if fully used , would represent a quantum leap over the damage and psychological terror [ORG Hizballah  ] rockets caused in northern [LOC Israel  ] during the 2006 war. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) There is overwhelming evidence that shows [LOC Syria  ] provided not just logistical and other support in moving the weapons , but was the main source of the weapons . 
[LOC Syria  ] 's integration of [ORG Hizballah  ] into its military doctrine , moreover , means that [ORG Hizballah  ] operatives and facilities enjoy a growing footprint in [LOC Syria.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At least two potential consequences flow from [ORG Hizballah  ] 's increased capabilities and [LOC Syria  ] 's role in creating them: ( 1 ) If there is another war between [ORG Hizballah  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , it will be far deadlier than the 2006 conflict ; ( 2 ) as in 2006 , there would be compelling reasons for [LOC Israel  ] to want to keep [LOC Syria  ] out of any future war if possible , but there might be a countervailing need to hit [ORG Hizballah  ] and perhaps targets in [LOC Syria  ] , some of which are located in populated areas. --------------------------------- Agreeing to Disagree on [ORG Hizballah  ] ---------------------------------- DAMASCUS 00000804 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] discussions on [ORG Hizballah  ] have tended to " agree to disagree " after hitting the wall of conflicting views on the legitimacy of armed resistance and [MISC Israeli  ] occupation . 
[MISC Syrian  ] officials , including President [PER Asad  ] , emphasize their political link to [ORG Hizballah  ] and flatly deny that [LOC Syria  ] is arming [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
They then defend the right to armed resistance in response to prolonged [MISC Israeli  ] occupation of [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] territory . 
When convenient , [MISC Syrian  ] officials claim they no longer have responsibility for [ORG Hizballah  ] , noting " we are out of [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
" President [PER Asad  ] and FM Muallim have also suggested that the challenge of disarming [ORG Hizballah  ] would be solved after [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Israel  ] signed a peace treaty . 
This agreement would lead naturally to a deal between [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , thereby removing the rationale for [ORG Hizballah  ] 's resistance movement and setting the stage for the transition of [ORG Hizballah  ] to a purely political party. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Syrian  ] government 's strategic view of relations with [ORG Hizballah  ] is difficult to assess with high confidence . 
According to various contacts , President [PER Asad  ] appears to be focused on the possibility of a new conflict between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , but many suggest he believes that the red lines of the 2006 war would be preserved . 
According to this model , [LOC Syria  ] could avoid direct involvement as long as [LOC Israel  ] refrained from striking targets on [MISC Syrian  ] soil . 
[LOC Syria  ] also seems to be hedging its bets through improved relations with [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , which , [MISC Syrian  ] officials probably hope , would object to [MISC Israeli  ] attacks against [LOC Lebanon  ] and/or [LOC Syria.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Asad  ] nonetheless appears more convinced than ever that arming [ORG Hizballah  ] is necessary for [MISC Syrian  ] security and perhaps as a stick to bring the current [MISC Israeli  ] government back to negotiations on the return of the [LOC Golan  ] . 
[MISC Syrians  ] remain resistant to the notion that [LOC Syria  ] bears responsibility for managing a potentially explosive situation that could draw [LOC Damascus  ] into a war neither sought nor winnable . 
They have ably deployed a force field of cognitive dissonance to resist arguments linking [LOC Syria  ] 's arming of [ORG Hizballah  ] and the future prospects of [MISC Syrian-Israel  ] peace negotiations . 
[LOC Israel  ] , they insist , remains the problem , and only a more active [LOC U.S.  ] role can bring and sustain a resolution . 
According to the prevailing [MISC Syrian  ] view , however , [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] relations must normalize before the [LOC U.S.  ] can play the role of a credible honest broker. ---------------------------------------- The [ORG Cooperative Approach Shows Potential  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As the interagency continues to plot future plans to engage [MISC Syrian  ] officials and thinks about how to recruit other countries to support our efforts , we face a choice not only about the level of our engagement , but about the approach itself . 
Up to now , [LOC U.S.  ] efforts have largely focused on developing a cooperative relationship on issues of mutual interest , such as [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions . 
Our four month pursuit of military-to-military cooperation on [MISC Iraqi  ] border security represented , in effect , a first step toward establishing a broader and higher-level dialogue on [MISC Iraqi  ] security issues , including [MISC Syrian  ] support of foreign fighters . 
After the August 19 bombings [LOC Baghdad  ] rendered implementation of this initiative impracticable , discussions in late-September shifted toward a possible [LOC CT  ] dialogue . 
This new focus provides an alternative mechanism to continue discussions on [MISC Iraqi  ] security issues such as foreign fighters . 
[MISC Syrian  ] officials appear willing to go along with this approach , as long as the emphasis is on building bilateral relations first . 
After months of investment , our engagement efforts are close to enabling both sides to exchange positive gestures . 
This cooperation should help to the stage for more focused discussions on a broad range of issues and strategic choices about the future direction of [LOC DAMASCUS  ] 00000804 003 OF 003 the relationship. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During this process , [LOC U.S.  ] officials have carefully placed markers on key issues , including human rights , [ORG IAEA  ] compliance , [ORG Bank Aman  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] ( e.g. , border demarcation ) , and [MISC Palestinians  ] ( pushing [ORG Hamas  ] to accept the Quartet principles ) , and the new embassy compound . 
We have addressed these issues mainly in discussions with Vice Foreign Minister [PER Miqdad  ] and the [MISC Syrian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] ( with less dialogue between [ORG Embassy Damascus  ] and the [MISC Syrian  ] MFA ) . 
Our view is that the cooperative approach will have more chance of success if we continue to use these channels to deal with such issues , until the relationship can sustain discussion at higher levels that will yield a higher probability of favorable progress. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Against this backdrop , sending [LOC U.S.  ] officials to focus on [MISC Syrian  ] relations with [ORG Hizballah  ] could distract significantly from our efforts to build a cooperative foothold . 
There is unlikely to be common ground or any breakthroughs , and a new focus on [MISC Hizballah-related  ] issues could further set back our efforts to re-energize the engagement process , not least by spurring the [MISC Syrians  ] to demand a reciprocal change in [LOC U.S.  ] behavior , e.g. , lifting sanctions . 
Focusing our higher political-level discussions on the issue of foreign fighters provides a more familiar subject with a higher chance for initial progress. --------------------------------------------- -- But [ORG Hizballah  ] 's [ORG Arsenal Poses Urgent Challenges  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While the near-term chances for a successful dialogue on [LOC Syria  ] 's strategic relationship with [ORG Hizballah  ] are much lower , the stakes -- the possibility of a regional conflict and significant obstacles to achieving comprehensive peace -- are just as , if not more , urgent . 
Sharing our concerns about the dangers of [LOC Syria  ] 's arming of [ORG Hizballah  ] , probably best done privately in a one-on-one session with President [PER Asad  ] , could serve to establish the basis of a more frank exchange about [LOC Syria  ] 's role , and enable us to challenge potentially dangerous [MISC Syrian  ] assumptions as part of a wider strategic dialogue . 
Recent revelations about [LOC Syria  ] 's role in weapons shipments create some urgency in turning [MISC Syrian  ] attention toward ending these supplies and restraining [ORG Hizballah  ] from making good on its provocative rhetoric. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We don't expect these points immediately to change [MISC Syrian  ] behavior or its relations with [ORG Hizballah  ] , but we believe sounding this warning would put President [PER Asad  ] and others ( such as [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC France  ] ) on notice that [LOC Syria  ] 's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by [ORG Hizballah  ] could prove disastrous for [LOC Syria  ] and the broader region . 
This message could likewise underscore our belief that [LOC Syria  ] needs to demonstrate a more active role in achieving peace with [LOC Israel  ] and better relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Even if a war between [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] does not materialize in the immediate future , we should try find a way to use our ongoing cooperative engagement with [MISC Syrian  ] officials to help them recognize their overriding interest and responsibility in preventing this unappealing scenario altogether .
