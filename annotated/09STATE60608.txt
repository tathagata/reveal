[ORG Begin Final Text of Iceland  ] 's country narrative in the 2009 TIP Report: -------------------------------- [LOC Iceland  ] ( [ORG TIER  ] 2 ) -------------------------------- [LOC Iceland  ] is primarily a destination country and , to a lesser extent , a transit country for men and women from the [MISC Baltic  ] states , [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Bulgaria  ] , [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC China  ] trafficked to and through [LOC Iceland  ] to [LOC Western European  ] states for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor in the restaurant and construction industries . 
The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so . 
In 2008 , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] drafted a national action plan to fight trafficking . 
However , the government did not demonstrate significant law enforcement efforts during the reporting period . 
Victim identification and victim assistance was a challenge ; some victims of trafficking may have been deported without any effort to determine whether they were victims . 
The government also did not conduct any anti-trafficking awareness campaigns . 
Recommendations for [MISC Iceland: Amend  ] the criminal code to ensure penalties prescribed for sex trafficking are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes , such as rape ; increase efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses and convict and punish trafficking offenders ; provide training for law enforcement investigators and prosecutors on trafficking cases ; develop legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face retribution or hardship ; develop a victim identification and referral mechanism ; consider opening a trafficking-specific shelter to ensure that victims are adequately assisted ; ensure that victims are not penalized for acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked , including immigration violations ; and conduct an awareness and prevention campaign focused on both sex and labor trafficking and the demand for both forms of trafficking . 
Prosecution ---------------- The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] demonstrated modest law enforcement efforts over the reporting period . 
[LOC Iceland  ] prohibits trafficking for both sexual exploitation and forced labor through [MISC Section 227  ] of its criminal code , although prosecutors have never used [MISC Section 227  ] and have instead relied on alien smuggling and document forgery statutes to prosecute trafficking cases . 
Punishments prescribed for trafficking under section 227 extend up to eight years' imprisonment , which are sufficiently stringent , though not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes , such as rape . 
Police conducted one sex trafficking investigation and one labor trafficking investigation during the reporting period , compared to no investigations in 2007 . 
Authorities prosecuted and convicted no traffickers in 2008 , the same as in 2007 . 
Protection ---------------- [LOC Iceland  ] demonstrated limited efforts to assist and protect trafficking victims over the last year . 
Local governments and [ORG NGOs  ] identified 20 probable victims of trafficking and less than 10 victims received assistance from government-funded programs . 
[LOC Iceland  ] did not provide trafficking-specific shelters ; instead victims were accommodated at a domestic violence shelter . 
In 2008 , the care available under this structure was limited because the government did not provide trafficking-specific assistance that adequately addressed the unique needs of victims of trafficking . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] authorities did not employ procedures to proactively identify victims of trafficking ; the lack of such procedures increased the risk that victims were detained , prosecuted , jailed , and deported for immigration violations . 
[LOC Iceland  ] did not employ a victim referral process , though [ORG NGOs  ] reported that some law enforcement officers referred victims for assistance on an ad hoc basis . 
Victims were encouraged to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders ; two victims assisted law enforcement in 2008 . 
Prevention ---------------- [LOC Iceland  ] conducted no substantive trafficking prevention efforts , including measures to increase public awareness of trafficking , during the reporting period . 
The government did , however , draft a national action plan to address trafficking . 
Border police at the country 's only international airport provided potential trafficking victims with information about assistance if they find themselves in a future trafficking scenario . 
The government adequately monitored immigration patterns for evidence of trafficking . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has not ratified the 2000 [ORG UN  ] TIP Protocol. -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
[ORG Post  ] may wish to deliver the following points , which offer technical and legal background on the TIP [MISC Report  ] process , to the host government as a non-paper with the above TIP [MISC Report  ] country narrative: ( begin non-paper ) -- The [ORG U.S. Congress  ] , through its passage of the 2000 [ORG Trafficking Victims Protection Act  ] , as amended ( [ORG TVPA  ] ) , requires the Secretary of State to submit an annual [MISC Report  ] to [ORG Congress  ] . 
The goal of this [MISC Report  ] is to stimulate action and create partnerships around the world in the fight against modern-day slavery . 
The [ORG USG  ] approach to combating human trafficking follows the [ORG TVPA  ] and the standards set forth in the Protocol to Prevent , [ORG Suppress  ] and [ORG Punish Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons  ] , Especially Women and Children , supplementing the [ORG United Nations Convention  ] against [ORG Transnational Organized Crime  ] ( commonly known as the " [MISC Palermo Protocol  ] " ) . 
The [ORG TVPA  ] and the [MISC Palermo Protocol  ] recognize that this is a crime in which the victims' labor or services ( including in the " sex industry " ) are obtained or maintained through force , fraud , or coercion , whether overt or through psychological manipulation . 
While much attention has focused on international flows , both the [ORG TVPA  ] and the [MISC Palermo Protocol  ] focus on the exploitation of the victim , and do not require a showing that the victim was moved . 
-- Recent amendments to the [ORG TVPA  ] removed the requirement that only countries with a " significant number " of trafficking victims be included in the [MISC Report  ] . 
Beginning with the 2009 TIP [MISC Report  ] , countries determined to be a country of origin , transit , or destination for victims of severe forms of trafficking are included in the [MISC Report  ] and assigned to one of three tiers . 
Countries assessed as meeting the " minimum standards for the elimination of severe forms of trafficking " set forth in the [ORG TVPA  ] are classified as [ORG Tier  ] 1 . 
Countries assessed as not fully complying with the minimum standards , but making significant efforts to meet those minimum standards are classified as [ORG Tier  ] 2 . 
Countries assessed as neither complying with the minimum standards nor making significant efforts to do so are classified as [ORG Tier  ] 3 . 
-- The [ORG TVPA  ] also requires the Secretary of State to provide a " [MISC Special Watch List  ] " to [ORG Congress  ] later in the year . 
Anti-trafficking efforts of the countries on this list are to be evaluated again in an [ORG Interim Assessment  ] that the Secretary of State must provide to [ORG Congress  ] by February 1 of each year . 
Countries are included on the " [MISC Special Watch List  ] " if they move up in " tier " rankings in the annual TIP [MISC Report  ] -- from 3 to 2 or from 2 to 1 -- or if they have been placed on the [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] . 
-- [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] consists of [ORG Tier  ] 2 countries determined: ( 1 ) not to have made " increasing efforts " to combat human trafficking over the past year ; ( 2 ) to be making significant efforts based on commitments of anti-trafficking reforms over the next year , or ( 3 ) to have a very significant number of trafficking victims or a significantly increasing victim population . 
As indicated in reftel B , the [ORG TVPRA  ] of 2008 contains a provision requiring that a country that has been included on [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] for two consecutive years after the date of enactment of the [ORG TVPRA  ] of 2008 be ranked as [ORG Tier  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Thus , any automatic downgrade to [ORG Tier  ] 3 pursuant to this provision would take place , at the earliest , in the 2011 TIP Report ( i.e. , a country would have to be ranked [ORG Tier  ] 2 [ORG Watch List  ] in the 2009 and 2010 Reports before being subject to [ORG Tier  ] 3 in the 2011 [MISC Report  ] ) . 
The new law allows for a waiver of this provision for up to two additional years upon a determination by the President that the country has developed and devoted sufficient resources to a written plan to make significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards . 
-- Countries classified as [ORG Tier  ] 3 may be subject to statutory restrictions for the subsequent fiscal year on non-humanitarian and non-trade-related foreign assistance and , in some circumstances , withholding of funding for participation by government officials or employees in educational and cultural exchange programs . 
In addition , the President could instruct the [LOC U.S.  ] executive directors to international financial institutions to oppose loans or other utilization of funds ( other than for humanitarian , trade-related or certain types of development assistance ) with respect to countries on [ORG Tier  ] 3 . 
Countries classified as [ORG Tier  ] 3 that take strong action within 90 days of the [MISC Report  ] 's release to show significant efforts against trafficking in persons , and thereby warrant a reassessment of their [ORG Tier  ] classification , would avoid such sanctions . 
Guidelines for such actions are in the [MISC DOS-crafted  ] action plans to be shared by [ORG Posts  ] with host governments . 
-- The 2009 TIP Report , issuing as it does in the midst of the global financial crisis , highlights high levels of trafficking for forced labor in many parts of the world and systemic contributing factors to this phenomenon: fraudulent recruitment practices and excessive recruiting fees in workers' home countries ; the lack of adequate labor protections in both sending and receiving countries ; and the flawed design of some destination countries' " sponsorship systems " that do not give foreign workers adequate legal recourse when faced with conditions of forced labor . 
As the May 2009 ILO Global Report on Forced Labor concluded , forced labor victims suffer approximately $20 billion in losses , and traffickers' profits are estimated at $31 billion . 
The current global financial crisis threatens to increase the number of victims of forced labor and increase the associated " cost of coercion . 
" -- The text of the [ORG TVPA  ] and amendments can be found on website www.state.gov/g/tip . 
-- On June 16 , 2009 , the Secretary of State will release the ninth annual TIP Report in a public event at the [ORG State Department  ] . 
We are providing you an advance copy of your country 's narrative in that report . 
Please keep this information embargoed until 10:00 am [LOC Washington DC  ] time June <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
The [ORG State Department  ] will also hold a general briefing for officials of foreign embassies in [LOC Washington DC  ] on June 17 at 3:30 pm EDT . 
( end non-paper ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
[ORG Posts  ] should make sure that the relevant country narrative is readily available on or though the [ORG Mission  ] 's web page in [MISC English  ] and appropriate local language ( s ) as soon as possible after the TIP Report is released . 
Funding for translation costs will be handled as it was for the [ORG Human Rights Report  ] . 
[ORG Posts  ] needing financial assistance for translation costs should contact their regional bureau 's EX office. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
The following is press guidance provided for Post to use with local media . 
Q1: Why was [LOC Iceland  ] placed on the Report for the first time in 2009 ? 
A: [LOC Iceland  ] was placed on the TIP Report this year because there was reliable information that [LOC Iceland  ] is a country of origin , transit , or destination for victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons . 
Q2: What types of trafficking exist in [LOC Iceland  ] ? 
A: [LOC Iceland  ] is primarily a destination country and , to a lesser extent , a transit country for men and women from [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Asia  ] , and [LOC South America  ] for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor in the restaurant and construction industries . 
Q3: Why is [LOC Iceland  ] placed on [ORG Tier  ] 2 ? 
A: The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so . 
The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] drafted a national action plan to fight trafficking and local governments and [ORG NGOs  ] identified 20 probable victims of trafficking . 
However , the government did not demonstrate significant law enforcement efforts and victim identification and assistance was a challenge ; some victims of trafficking may have been deported without any effort to determine whether they were victims . 
The government also did not conduct any anti-trafficking awareness campaigns . 
Q4: What could the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] do to improve its anti-trafficking efforts in the coming year ? 
A: The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] could: increase efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses and convict and punish trafficking offenders ; provide training for law enforcement investigators and prosecutors on trafficking cases ; develop legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face retribution or hardship ; develop a victim identification and referral mechanism ; consider opening a trafficking-specific shelter to ensure that victims are adequately assisted ; and conduct an awareness and prevention campaign focused on both sex and labor trafficking and the demand for both forms of trafficking. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
