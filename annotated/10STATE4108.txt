<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 STATE 004108 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/14/2019 TAGS AF , MARR , MOPS , [ORG NATO  ] , PREL SUBJECT: CLARIFYING THE TRANSITION TO [MISC AFGHAN  ] LEAD PROVINCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Classified By: Acting A/S [PER Nancy McEldowney  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) For the Ambassador or Charge SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST -------------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Department requests action addressees clarify for host governments at the highest possible level the planning process for [ORG ISAF  ] transition to [MISC Afghan  ] lead at the provincial level , emphasizing that discussion of this issue must not be mischaracterized as a plan for the imminent withdrawal of [ORG ISAF  ] forces . 
In order for provincial transition to occur , certain criteria pertaining to security as well as governance and development will have to be met . 
As the President stated on December 1 , it is important that we increase our commitments to the mission now in order to create the conditions to begin to draw down international combat forces beginning in mid-2011 . 
BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG NATO  ] is currently developing an annex to the [ORG ISAF Operational Plan  ] that describes the process for a conditions-based , province-by-province transition of [MISC Afghan  ] responsibility for security . 
[ORG NATO  ] will discuss the plan , including political considerations , with the intent of achieving [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( [ORG NAC  ] ) approval prior to the January 28 [ORG London Foreign Ministers’  ] conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Welcoming this plan or progress toward it is a key deliverable of the [LOC London  ] conference. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) It is vital that in public messages the transition plan not be confused with an exit plan or timetable . 
[ORG ISAF  ] is currently in [ORG Phase  ] 3 ( Stabilization ) of its five-stage [ORG Operational Plan  ] . 
[ORG Phase  ] 4 is Transition and [ORG Phase  ] 5 is Redeployment , culminating in withdrawal . 
Transition has at times been erroneously equated with Transfer of [ORG Lead Security Responsibility  ] ( [ORG TLSR  ] ) . 
[ORG ISAF Phase  ] 4 Transition refers to a tangible demonstration of progress in the overall stability and security of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] ownership and responsibility , based on rigorous security , governance , and development conditions . 
Transition will proceed on a province-by-province basis and be gradual . 
[ORG TLSR  ] is an early tactical step in the partnership between [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) and [ORG ISAF  ] , controlled in theater at the operational level . 
It is part of the [ORG ANSF  ] development process to encourage and accelerate [ORG ANSF  ] capability , responsibility , and ownership , not an indication of changes in either [ORG ANSF  ] capabilities or the security mission. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) It is important that our Allies and partners counter erroneous misunderstanding that international support for the Government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] is wavering and any false expectation of an imminent withdrawal of [ORG ISAF  ] forces . 
Using the [LOC London  ] conference to lay out an exit strategy would send the wrong message to the people of [LOC Afghanistan  ] as well as to [ORG Allied  ] and partner publics . 
REPORTING DEADLINE STATE 00004108 002 OF 003 ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Department requests that action addressees report the results of their efforts by front channel cable slugged for EUR/RPM [PER Aaron Cope  ] , [ORG S/SRAP  ] , and SCA/A by January 17 . 
TALKING POINTS -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action addressees should draw on the following points: -- [ORG NATO  ] is currently developing an annex to the [ORG ISAF Operational Plan  ] describing the process for a conditions-based , province-by-province transition in consultation with the Government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and other stakeholders as appropriate . 
After discussing the plan and relevant political considerations , the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] aims to adopt the transition plan prior to the January 28 [ORG London Foreign Ministers’  ] conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
-- Transition is a tangible demonstration of progress in the overall stability and security of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] ownership and responsibility . 
Transition will proceed gradually on a province-by-province basis based on rigorous security , governance , and development conditions . 
-- The specific conditions for provincial transition are the focus of ongoing planning processes and have not been finalized . 
Transition of individual provinces should be undertaken with extensive consultations among [LOC NATO/ISAF  ] , the [MISC Afghan  ] government , [ORG UNAMA  ] , and other key stakeholders , and only when it is clear that security , governance , and development conditions have been met and can be sustained . 
-- Transition is not an exit strategy for [ORG ISAF  ] , although it is an important step toward fulfilling ISAF’s mission . 
[ORG ISAF  ] will retain supporting , enabling , and mentoring/advising roles throughout transition . 
International civilians will remain in place and may , in fact , increase as the international mission is civilianized and as conditions allow . 
The duration of the post-transition international presence will depend on local conditions . 
[ORG ISAF  ] forces no longer required in one province may need to shift to other provinces that are in earlier stages of the transition process . 
Affected nations participating in the provinces in which transition is taking place will be consulted regarding any necessary changes in force posture . 
-- It is important to distinguish Transition from Transfer of [ORG Lead Security Responsibility  ] ( [ORG TLSR  ] ) , which is an early tactical step in the partnership between [ORG ANSF  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] whereby [ORG ISAF  ] forces gradually assume the “supporting” role and [ORG ANSF  ] take greater leadership . 
This process is controlled in theater at the operational level . 
It is part of the [ORG ANSF  ] development process to encourage and accelerate [ORG ANSF  ] capability , responsibility , and ownership , not an indication of changes in either [ORG ANSF  ] capabilities or the security mission . 
-- In the wake of President Karzai’s positive commitments in his November 2009 inaugural address , it is particularly important that in publicly discussing transition , [ORG ISAF  ] countries neither imply that the commitment of the international community is wavering nor create unrealistic STATE 00004108 003 OF 003 public expectations of an imminent reduction in [ORG ISAF  ] forces . 
-- On the contrary , now is the time to reinforce our contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , as President [PER Obama  ] stated in his December 1 address , in order to create the conditions that will allow us to begin the process of drawing down combat forces in the summer of 2011 . 
-- Welcoming [MISC NATO’s  ] progress in developing a plan for provincial transition could be one useful deliverable of the January 28 international conference in [LOC London  ] . 
-- We expect the conference also will welcome and pledge support for an [MISC Afghan-led  ] program of reintegration . 
-- The conference will have a broader range of outcomes in governance and development as well as civilian coordination , not only security . 
It will provide Foreign Ministers an important opportunity to welcome [ORG GOA  ] plans for initiatives on anti-corruption , sub-national governance , and economic development and to welcome the announcement of the new [ORG UN  ] SRSG . 
The [LOC United States  ] believes that the conference also should be able to welcome [MISC NATO’s  ] plans to strengthen the mandate for its Senior Civilian Representative . 
-- While this will not be a pledging conference , we will welcome any additional civilian or military contributions that Allies or partners might announce there . 
At [LOC NATO’s Defense  ] Ministerial meeting on February 4-5 in [LOC Istanbul  ] , we will encourage nations to clarify previously pledged commitments to ensure that forces deployed in 2010 have an operational impact .
