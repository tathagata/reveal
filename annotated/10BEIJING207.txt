( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Summary: A  ] well-placed contact claims that the [MISC Chinese  ] government coordinated the recent intrusions of [ORG Google  ] systems . 
According to our contact , the closely held operations were directed at the [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] level . 
-- Another contact claimed a top [LOC PRC  ] leader was actively working with [ORG Google  ] competitor [ORG Baidu  ] against [ORG Google  ] . 
-- [MISC Chinese  ] concerns over the recent [ORG Google  ] threat to take down the company 's [MISC Chinese-language  ] search engine google.cn over censorship and hacking allegations were focused on the service 's growing popularity among [MISC Chinese  ] [MISC Internet  ] users and a perception that the [MISC USG  ] and [ORG Google  ] were working in concert . 
-- An appeal to nationalism seems to be the [MISC Chinese  ] government 's chosen option to counter [ORG Google  ] 's demand to provide unfiltered web content . 
-- Contacts in the technology industry tell us that [MISC Chinese  ] interference in the operations of foreign businesses is widespread and often underreported to [LOC U.S.  ] parent companies .

Attacks Directed at [LOC High Level  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX [MISC PRC Sees  ] [ORG USG  ] and [ORG Google  ] Working Together ---------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [ORG Google  ] 's recent move presented a major dilemma ( maodun ) for the [MISC Chinese  ] government , not because of the cyber-security aspect but because of [ORG Google  ] 's direct challenge to [LOC China  ] 's legal restrictions on [MISC Internet  ] content . 
The immediate strategy , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , seemed to be to appeal to [MISC Chinese  ] nationalism by accusing [ORG Google  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] government of working together to force [LOC China  ] to accept " [MISC Western  ] values " and undermine [LOC China  ] 's rule of law . 
The problem the censors were facing , however , was that [ORG Google  ] 's demand to deliver uncensored search results was very difficult to spin as an attack on [LOC China  ] , and the entire episode had made [ORG Google  ] more interesting and attractive to [MISC Chinese  ] [MISC Internet  ] users . 
All of a sudden , XXXXXXXXXXXX continued , [ORG Baidu  ] looked like a boring state-owned enterprise while [ORG Google  ] " seems very attractive , like the forbidden fruit . 
" He said it " seems clear " to the [MISC Chinese  ] people that [ORG Google  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] government were working together on [MISC Internet  ] freedom and to undermine [MISC Chinese  ] government controls on the [MISC Internet  ] . 
That made some intellectuals happy , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , but " some others " regarded it as interference in [LOC China  ] 's internal affairs . 
[ORG Industry: Interference Common  ] , [MISC Paranoia Driving PRC Policy  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- XXXXXXXXXXXX 002 OF 002 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( please protect ) noted the pronounced disconnect between views of [LOC U.S.  ] parent companies and local subsidiaries . 
[MISC PRC-based  ] company officials often downplayed the extent of [LOC PRC  ] government interference in their operations for fear of consequences for their local markets . 
Our contact emphasized that [ORG Google  ] and other [LOC U.S.  ] companies in [LOC China  ] were struggling with the stated [MISC Chinese  ] goal of technology transfer for the purpose of excluding foreign competition . 
This consultant noted the [MISC Chinese  ] were exploiting the global economic downturn to enact increasingly draconian product certification and government procurement regulations to force foreign-invested enterprises ( FIEs ) to transfer intellectual property and to carve away the market share of foreign companies . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Media: [MISC American  ] Hypocrisy and Cultural Hegemony --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The Secretary 's speech continued to dominate headlines January 25-26 , with the official [ORG People 's Daily  ] ( circ 2.2 million ) alleging collusion between [LOC U.S.  ] officials and the business community as evidenced by the propinquity of [ORG Google  ] 's rethink of its [LOC China  ] business and the Secretary 's speech . 
[MISC Chinese  ] media again accused the [LOC U.S.  ] of " cultural hegemony " for setting the standards for " so-called [MISC Internet  ] freedom8 and of hypocrisy for calling for the free flow of information while using the [MISC Internet  ] as a political and military tool . 
[ORG People 's Daily-affiliated Global Times English  ] ( circ 150,000 ) called the speech a " milestone " showing that [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Western  ] political interests were " taking over every dimension " of cyberspace. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [ORG Party-affiliated Beijing News  ] ( circ 530,000 ) opined that the speech showed " a huge gap between [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC American  ] information industries , which may lead to a trade war strategy . 
" In an article headlined " [LOC China  ] Intensifies Counterattack on [MISC Internet  ] Accusation , " [ORG Global Times  ] [MISC Chinese  ] ( circ 1.3 million ) quoted [MISC Chinese  ] scholar [PER Niu Xinchun  ] as rejecting the theory that [MISC U.S.-China  ] conflict would replace the " [MISC G2  ] " cooperation model , noting that [LOC U.S.  ] attacks usually ended " poorly " when the [LOC U.S.  ] considered its practical interests . 
Many papers quoted statements from the [ORG State Council Information Office and Ministry of Industry  ] and [ORG Information Technology  ] calling [MISC Chinese  ] [MISC Internet  ] controls " legitimate " and saying they should not be subject to " unjustifiable interference . 
" Papers continued to conflate [ORG Google  ] 's [LOC China  ] business strategy with the Secretary 's speech . 
Blogging Circumscribed ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Anecdotally , censors appear to have cracked down on blogging about the Secretary 's speech . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's speech is currently blocked in [MISC Chinese  ] on state.gov but remains accessible on the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy website in both [MISC English  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] .
