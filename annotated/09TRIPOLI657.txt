End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG CDA  ] presented the proposed agenda for the first round of the [ORG U.S.-Libya Human Rights Dialogue  ] ( ref ) in an August 12 meeting with [ORG MFA A/S-equivalent Ahmed  ] [PER Fituri  ] and [ORG Americas Desk  ] Director [PER Mohammed Matari  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] , who had reviewed the agenda with FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] on August 11 , said the proposed agenda was " fine " and that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government did not have any changes . 
[PER Fituri  ] also promised to provide the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation list no later than August 13 , along with information on the timing and venue for the August 18 dialogue . 
[PER Fituri  ] said the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Delegation  ] most likely would be led by the Secretary of the General People 's Committee for [MISC Justice  ] ( Minister of Justice-equivalent ) , and would include the [ORG MFA  ] 's [PER Matari  ] , representatives from the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG International Organizations Department and Refugees and Migration Department  ] , as well as a representative from the General People 's [ORG Congress' Human Rights Commission  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] stressed that he had spoken personally with Minister-equivalent of [ORG Justice  ] Mustafa [PER Muhammad Abd-al-Jalil  ] concerning the dialogue and that [MISC Abd-al-Jalil  ] was " fully on board " with the initiative. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Fituri  ] said the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] viewed this dialogue as a sensitive undertaking and wanted to ensure its success and continuation over time . 
To that end , the [ORG MFA  ] did not intend to announce the dialogue in advance . 
However , the GOL is fully committed to issuing a joint statement at the conclusion of the talks . 
[PER Fituri  ] noted that he had discussed this issue with FM [PER Kusa  ] on August 11 , and that [PER Kusa  ] had asked that the dialogue be announced as the first in a series of regular meetings , " one part of the broader dialogue . 
" [PER Fituri  ] agreed that language noting that the human rights meeting was held " in the context of the agreement between our two countries to expand cooperation across a range of issues " would be very appropriate , and asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] present a proposed draft statement for consideration by the [ORG MFA  ] as early as Sunday , August 16 , in order to facilitate the internal [MISC Libyan  ] Government approval process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Fituri  ] cautioned that although the [ORG MFA  ] understood the importance and utility of these talks , there are others in the [MISC Libyan  ] Government who may seek to use the dialogue to embarrass the [ORG U.S. Government  ] on its own human rights record . 
[PER Fituri  ] noted that the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] representatives are likely to raise issues such as [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] and alleged torture cases . 
[PER Fituri  ] urged the [ORG U.S. Delegation  ] to use this initial round of the dialogue to define the terms of reference for the talks , and to seek common ground on areas of mutual concern to both [LOC Libya  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
He said it would be very helpful if the [LOC U.S.  ] could explain some of the concrete areas in which it could provide assistance to the [MISC Libyans  ] , such as refugee and migration issues . 
[PER Fituri  ] believes that this sort of pragmatic engagement is essential to ensuring the dialogue 's long-term continuity. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment and action request: [ORG MFA  ] officials - including FM [PER Kusa  ] himself - appear to understand the importance of the human rights dialogue to the broader relationship and , as evidenced by [PER Kusa  ] 's August 11 meeting with [PER Fituri  ] , are making serious preparations for the talks . 
We agree with [PER Fituri  ] 's assessment that the first session of the dialogue will be most effective if it focuses on a broader discussion of [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] goals for the dialogue and results in a clear , agreed framework for future talks . 
To help smooth the way for the joint statement , we recommend that the interagency develop a proposed joint statement that could be shared with the [ORG MFA  ] on August 16 , as requested by [PER Fituri  ] . 
We will submit our suggestions via email to NEA/MAG and request the [ORG Department 's TRIPOLI  ] 00000657 002 OF 002 guidance by August 16.POLASCHIK</pre></code>
