Pearce  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Ambassador delivered reftel demarche December 21 to the MFA Director General for [ORG Arab Affairs  ] on the eve of [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] 's expected visit . 
On foreign fighters , [PER DG Abdelhamid Bouzaher  ] said that the flow into [LOC Iraq  ] had declined in recent years from a 2003-05 peak . 
He added that many young returning [MISC Algerian  ] fighters had been " disillusioned " by their experience , not wanting to be used merely as suicide bombers . 
Ambassador noted [LOC Syria  ] was still the main route into [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Damascus  ] needed to do more . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Bouzaher  ] saw [LOC Syria  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] as less one of " strategy and substance " than convenience and temporary interest . 
Ambassador noted that , over the years , [LOC Syria  ] had facilitated [MISC Iranian  ] access to [LOC Lebanon  ] but the [MISC Syrian  ] government was likely to listen carefully to any concerns [LOC Algeria  ] might voice . 
Ambassador asked that [LOC Algeria  ] lend its weight to pressing [LOC Syria  ] to adopt a more positive approach to [LOC Lebanon  ] , including the normalization of relations , which was important for the security and stability of the entire region . 
He also raised the need for [MISC Arab  ] countries to normalize relations with [LOC Iraq  ] , rather than leave the diplomatic field in [LOC Baghdad  ] to [LOC Iran  ] . 
FOREIGN FIGHTERS " DISILLUSIONED " -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In [PER Bouzaher  ] 's view , the flow of foreign fighters into [LOC Iraq  ] has declined markedly in recent years , from a 2003-2005 peak . 
The Ambassador responded that any decline was relative , and the transit of foreign fighters through [LOC Syria  ] was still a problem and the [MISC Syrian  ] government needed to do more . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] stressed the positive [MISC Syrian  ] step of opening its border to over a million [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees , and said he believed [LOC Syria  ] was today more serious about securing its frontier with [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Although [PER Bouzaher  ] admitted he " was not an expert " on the issue , he said that many young [MISC Algerian  ] fighters returning from [LOC Iraq  ] were " disillusioned " by their experience , as they did not want to be used merely as suicide bombers . 
" This is not part of our culture , " they felt , according to [LOC Bouzaher.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Bouzaher  ] said that [LOC Algeria  ] 's ties with [LOC Syria  ] had deteriorated in recent years over the terrorism issue . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] government had engaged recently with the [MISC Syrians  ] on economic and commercial issues , but had thus far failed to conclude a bilateral security accord . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] said that [LOC Syria  ] had shown signs lately of wanting to break out of its isolation and had evinced some good will regarding [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] in particular . 
Today , said [PER Bouzaher  ] , [LOC Syria  ] has a " clear interest " in stable relations with [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Ambassador pressed [PER Bouzaher  ] for specifics , saying he hoped [PER Bouzaher  ] was right but [LOC Syria  ] needed to demonstrate these intentions in a more concrete manner . 
INTO THE ARMS OF [LOC IRAN  ] --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Bouzaher  ] saw the resolution of the [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] conflict as the " key to the entire region , " including all of the issues involving [LOC Syria  ] . 
In the case of [LOC Iran  ] , he said , solving this problem would rob them of their vision of a " divine mission " to reclaim [LOC Jerusalem  ] , and therefore , by implication , make it easier for [LOC Syria  ] to stand against [MISC Iranian  ] support for [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] saw [LOC Syria  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] as less one of " strategy and substance " than of convenience and temporary interest . 
Ambassador noted that , over the years , [LOC Syria  ] had facilitated [MISC Iranian  ] access to [LOC Lebanon  ] but the [MISC Syrian  ] government was likely to listen carefully to any concerns [LOC Algeria  ] might voice . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] repeated that [LOC Syria  ] had been a victim of its own isolation , and said that he did not believe it had any real substantive interest in close relations with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Instead , he said al-Asad wanted to improve his relations with the [LOC U.S  ] , a desire that " was complicated " by recent cross-border [LOC U.S.  ] military actions inside [LOC Syria  ] . 
[ORG SHI'A THREAT  ] " FRIGHTENING " -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Ambassador asked that [LOC Algeria  ] lend its weight to ALGIERS 00001327 002 OF 002 pressing [LOC Syria  ] to adopt a more positive approach to [LOC Lebanon  ] , including the normalization of relations , which was important for the security and stability of the entire region . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] stressed that [LOC Algeria  ] had " an [MISC Arab  ] nationalist duty " to support [LOC Lebanon  ] and would continue to do so . 
He said [LOC Algeria  ] has consistently pushed for a full investigation into the assassination of former prime minister [PER Rafik Hariri  ] , but in the absence of specific proof , was not eager to blame [LOC Syria  ] outright . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] stressed that [LOC Algeria  ] 's relationship with [LOC Syria  ] had suffered greatly in the 1990s over the terrorism issue , but was now improving . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] believed that [LOC Syria  ] " has intentions to normalize " relations with [LOC Lebanon  ] , and added that [LOC Syria  ] has to realize that the situation in [LOC Lebanon  ] could be very damaging to [PER Sunni  ] interests . 
As [PER Sunni Arabs  ] , he said , [LOC Algeria  ] found the [ORG Shi'a  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] " frightening ; " it was a situation not at all favorable to " our way of seeing things . 
" [PER Bouzaher  ] said that the core issue in [LOC Lebanon  ] was the arming of [ORG Hizballah  ] , " as everyone knows . 
" WARILY REENGAGING ON [LOC IRAQ  ] ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) The Ambassador stressed that as an influential voice in the [MISC Arab  ] world , it would help if [LOC Algeria  ] was among those taking the lead on [MISC Arab  ] re-engagement with [LOC Iraq  ] . 
To not do so , he said , was damaging to stability and left the field to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Iraq  ] would endure and [MISC Iraqis  ] would remember those who supported them in their darker days , much as [LOC Algeria  ] remembered those who did or did not offer support during the 1990s civil war . 
To this , [PER Bouzaher  ] responded that [LOC Algeria  ] was still very much scarred by the July 2005 assassination of two [MISC Algerian  ] diplomats in [LOC Baghdad  ] , and that no official investigation or condolences had ever come from the [MISC Iraqi  ] government . 
Ambassador said this was an important and legitimate concern , one shared by other countries whose diplomats had been killed , but it was also important for the stability of the region to re-engage [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Bouzaher  ] acknowledged that it was time for [LOC Algeria  ] " to clarify its relations with [LOC Iraq  ] , " particularly since [MISC Iraqis  ] had supported [LOC Algeria  ] during its war for independence . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Bouzaher  ] was part of an [MISC Algerian  ] business delegation led by Prime Minister [PER Ahmed Ouyahia  ] that visited [LOC Damascus  ] in October , signing several economic and commercial agreements . 
He confided that in other areas such as security , there had been less progress . 
He referred to a bilateral draft agreement between [MISC Algerian  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] intelligence and security services that had been pending for some time and was still not signed , as " our services still have much to clarify to make sure we understand " [MISC Syrian  ] intentions . 
We delivered the demarche and non-paper to [PER Bouzaher  ] at a propitious time - we left his office at 1545 , and he was heading into a meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Mourad Medelci  ] at 1600 , presumably to discuss the imminent visit of al-Asad , among other things .
