During a June 7 meeting with G/TIP Director [PER Miller  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] and Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] acknowledged a shared commitment for concrete action against [ORG Trafficking  ] in [MISC Persons  ] ( [ORG TIP  ] ) . 
Although critical of the tone and unilateral nature of the [LOC U.S.  ] benchmarks outlined in the [MISC TIP Continuing Action Plan  ] ( reftel ) and insistent on tackling the problem in their own way , the [ORG Ministers  ] agreed clear guidelines to measure progress in fighting [ORG TIP  ] were desirable . 
Both sides agreed to continue their dialogue on [ORG TIP  ] in a constructive manner and expressed confidence we would come to a solution . 
[PER MILLER  ] MEETING WITH FOREIGN AND JUSTICE MINISTERS --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
The Secretary is considering Tier 1 placement for the [LOC Netherlands  ] in the 2004 [MISC TIP Report  ] , with a re-assessment in November 2004 . 
At the direction of the Deputy Secretary , G/TIP Director [PER John Miller  ] visited The [ORG Hague  ] June 7 . 
With Amb . 
[PER Sobel  ] , he met with [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] and Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] to discuss the quantifiable , specific benchmarks in the [MISC TIP Continuing Action Plan  ] ( reftel ) on which the [MISC Dutch  ] will be evaluated in November . 
Other [LOC U.S.  ] participants included G/TIP Acting Deputy Director [PER JoAnn Schneider  ] , [PER EUR/PGI Doug Hoyt  ] , [ORG DCM Danny Russel  ] , and [ORG Global Issues  ] officers [PER Drew Mann  ] and [PER Erin Webster-Main  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] participants were P.P . 
( [PER Peter  ] ) van [PER Wulfften Palthe  ] , [ORG MFA DG of Regional Policy  ] and [ORG Consular Affairs  ] , [PER Arie Ijzerman  ] , MoJ Director of [ORG International Criminal Affairs & Drugs Policy  ] , and [PER Marjo Crompvoets  ] , [ORG MFA Senior Policy Advisor  ] on [ORG Judicial and Police Cooperation.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The initial reception by the [MISC Dutch  ] was cold with considerable push back . 
Both Ministers [PER Donner  ] and [PER Bot  ] criticized the harsh tone of the benchmarks and the apparent unilateral imposition of [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG TIP  ] priorities upon the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
FM [PER Bot  ] said this is not how sovereign nations should deal with each other . 
He acknowledged the terrible scourge of [ORG TIP  ] and reiterated the [MISC Dutch  ] commitment to eradicate the problem . 
Still , as a sovereign country , [PER Bot  ] said , the [LOC Netherlands  ] would tailor its [ORG TIP  ] approach to national circumstances and priorities . 
For example , [PER Donner  ] noted the benchmarks laid a heavy emphasis on licensed brothels in the [ORG Amsterdam Red Light District  ] , when a more pressing concern for the [MISC Dutch  ] was the phenomenon of lover boys preying on minors , against which the [MISC Dutch  ] had undertaken information campaigns and increased prosecutions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Mr. [PER Miller  ] first reviewed the possibility of the Secretary doing a conditional Tier 1 placement to be reassessed in November and listed the conditions we felt necessary to maintain that rating in our evaluation . 
He expressed G/TIP , s view that the [MISC Dutch  ] decision to legalize prostitution and maintain a sex industry with zones like the [ORG Amsterdam Red Light District  ] created a magnet for [ORG TIP  ] crimes . 
As such , the [MISC Dutch  ] shouldered special obligations to rid the legalized sector of [ORG TIP  ] victims . 
The [ORG Ministers  ] agreed a link existed between prostitution and trafficking , but they distinguished the two activities and stated that licensing and regulating prostitution was , in fact , a [MISC Dutch  ] effort to stop [ORG TIP  ] . 
The [ORG Ministers  ] questioned whether G/TIP , s focus on legalized prostitution exceeded the [ORG Trafficking Victims Protection Act  ] mandate. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Both Mr. [PER Miller  ] and the [ORG Ministers  ] agreed the goal is to reduce the number of [ORG TIP  ] victims and increase the number of trafficker prosecutions . 
In fact , both countries share many similar tactics in their fight against [ORG TIP  ] . 
Mr. [PER Miller  ] and the [ORG Ministers  ] acknowledged several of the steps indicated in the benchmarks were , in fact , already being undertaken by the [MISC Dutch.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Noting the common ground between the two countries in shared goal and means , Amb . 
[PER Sobel  ] stressed the need for a continued real time dialogue on [ORG TIP  ] issues . 
Rather than relying upon proclamations and gestures , everyone recognized the importance of establishing concrete , measurable targets in the [ORG TIP  ] effort . 
Bot and [PER Donner  ] agreed , noting that progress against [ORG TIP  ] is made at the street level , not the paper level and the [MISC Dutch  ] plan to deal with [ORG TIP  ] issues in the expanded [ORG EU  ] during the [MISC Dutch  ] Presidency . 
[PER Donner  ] affirmed that national and [MISC EU-wide  ] progress on [ORG TIP  ] was a top [MISC Dutch  ] priority and urged that we move forward together on solutions and avoid problems of tone . 
The meeting ended with the promise by both sides to continue talking. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
After the meeting , Mr. [PER Miller  ] indicated to the [ORG Amb.  ] and [ORG DCM  ] alternative benchmarks might be acceptable , but the Deputy Secretary required conditions as substantial , specific and measurable as the benchmarks outlined in the Continuing [MISC Action Plan  ] . 
[PER Mr. Miller  ] said he could accept such clearly defined and measurable alternative benchmarks developed jointly by the [MISC Dutch  ] and [LOC U.S  ] . 
( including G/TIP ) if done quickly ( i.e. , within a month ) . 
OTHER MEETINGS -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Prior to his meeting with the [ORG Ministers  ] , [PER Mr. Miller  ] toured [PER De Roggeveen Shelter  ] for victims of domestic violence and trafficking . 
He discussed the need for improvements in the government 's [MISC B-9  ] status ( e.g. , allowing [ORG TIP  ] victims to work ) with the shelter 's social workers . 
Following the shelter visit , [PER Mr. Miller  ] met two former [ORG TIP  ] victims who had started [PER Atalantas  ] , an NGO working to inform other victims of their rights under [MISC Dutch  ] law . 
They spoke of their particular efforts to focus more attention on victims rather than prosecutions by reaching out directly to them , former to current victim. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
In another meeting , the [ORG National Rapporteur  ] told [PER Mr. Miller  ] of several areas of progress since their last meeting in September - a new joint investigative team involving [MISC German  ] , [MISC Belgian  ] , [MISC Bulgarian  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] , [ORG EUROPOL  ] and [ORG EUROJUST  ] officials to combat [ORG TIP  ] ; and an [ORG EU  ] twinning project with the [LOC U.K.  ] in the [LOC Czech Republic  ] . 
She said her third report would likely be released during the summer ( to include 2002 figures - final 2003 figures are expected shortly after its publication ) . 
[PER Mr. Miller  ] also met with [PER Rob Coster  ] , [ORG National Police Project Leader for Prostitution  ] and [ORG TIP  ] , who discussed the shift in police focus from the legal to the illegal prostitution sector ( including escort services ) . 
[PER Coster  ] also clarified the [MISC Dutch  ] were re-allocating 100 detectives from the regional level up to the national level to deal more effectively with transnational crimes such as [ORG TIP  ] . 
[PER Coster  ] echoed the [ORG National Rapporteur  ] , s remarks that the [LOC Netherlands  ] was instituting new [ORG TIP  ] demand reduction programs . 
Finally , a police tour of [LOC Amsterdam  ] , s [ORG Red Light District  ] after the meeting with the [ORG Ministers  ] revealed that police checked all legal brothels for [ORG TIP  ] victims once every six weeks on average . 
COMMENT -------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
Embassy believes the next step is a strong push for prompt joint development of clear , measurable benchmarks that closely conform to domestic [MISC Dutch  ] realities . 
This will help ensure continued bilateral , shoulder-to-shoulder cooperation in the fight against [ORG TIP  ] , and hopefully ease [MISC Dutch  ] pre-occupation with the process of producing our yearly report . 
Minister Bot committed the [MISC Dutch  ] to attack [ORG TIP  ] during their upcoming [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
With continued bilateral engagement , the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] will be able to multiply our individual efforts against [ORG TIP  ] at a time when [ORG EU  ] border policies are under review and its enlarged borders increase the risk of trafficking. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
G/TIP Director [PER Miller  ] has reviewed and cleared this cable .
