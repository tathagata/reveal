REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) We look forward to your visit on 10-11 January , and senior GOB officials seem keen to discuss the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] with you . 
Our requests for meetings with Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] , [ORG Presidency International Affairs Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , Finance Minister [PER Antonio Palocci  ] , Civil Household Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] Minister [PER Jorge Armando Felix  ] were enthusiastically received and have been confirmed . 
Reftel analyzes current [MISC Brazilian  ] views of energy sector investments in [LOC Bolivia  ] , which you can discuss further with Ministers [PER Rousseff  ] ( who previously was [LOC Brazil  ] 's mines and energy minister ) and [PER Palocci  ] . 
In your other meetings , you can focus on the GOB 's outlook for what a [PER Morales  ] presidency means for regional integration , political stability and law enforcement . 
In particular , you can stress with all interlocutors our concerns about a possible dramatic expansion in cocaine production and export -- concerns that many GOB officials quietly share , given the already heavy influx of [MISC Bolivian  ] cocaine into [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Presidential International Affairs Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] was in [LOC Bolivia  ] during the elections , and has been [PER Lula  ] 's envoy in earlier missions there . 
He has had contact with a range of key [MISC Bolivian  ] actors , including [PER Morales  ] . 
In meetings late last year with Deputy Secretary [PER Zoellick  ] and other USG officials , [ORG Garcia  ] repeatedly underscored [LOC Brazil  ] 's primary concern that the elections be seen as transparent and produce a clear winner , in order to stave off an immediate period of instability and protests . 
Now that such a result has been achieved , you can ask [PER Garcia  ] for his perspective on [ORG Morales'  ] ability to govern , especially with regard to managing pressures from his radical flank and reaching out to [PER Santa Cruz  ] . 
[ORG Garcia  ] is the most ideological of [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy advisors ( [PER Rousseff  ] also has pronounced leftist views ) , and is quite sympathetic to political forces like those [PER Morales  ] represents . 
Hence it will be interesting to press [ORG Garcia  ] for explanations of statements by [PER Lula  ] last year that appeared to welcome [ORG Morales'  ] looming " populist " victory , and of how the [ORG GOB  ] sees itself now in relation to the " Axis of [MISC Evo  ] " ( [PER Morales  ] , [PER Chavez  ] , [PER Castro  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In that context , it is interesting to note that both [PER Lula  ] and [PER Amorim  ] made statements to a meeting of senior [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats this week -- widely reported in the press here on 5 January -- in which they claimed the [ORG GOB  ] intends to maintain " strong relations " with [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , but does not intend to " abandon " or " contaminate " its good bilateral relationship with [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] stated that [LOC Brazil  ] had exercised an informal mediation role in the past between [LOC Washington  ] and [PER Chavez  ] , and wants to continue to be helpful . 
He implied [LOC Brazil  ] does not want to be perceived as directly associated with a [ORG Bolivia-Venezuela-Cuba  ] alliance: " [LOC Brazil  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] . 
There is no reason to be worried.. . 
" he affirmed . 
Such statements and the alacrity with which senior ministers accepted requests for meetings with you suggest the [ORG GOB  ] is eager to reassure us . 
Your meeting with [PER Amorim  ] will present an excellent opportunity to probe for how [LOC Brazil  ] will operationalize this independent " mediation " role , how [ORG Itamaraty  ] plans to coordinate with other agencies and [ORG Petrobras  ] in dealing with [ORG Morales'  ] " nationalization " agenda , and preview the upcoming [PER Morales  ] inauguration ( [PER Lula  ] reportedly may attend ) , [PER Lula  ] 's meetings in coming weeks in [LOC Brasilia  ] with [PER Morales  ] ( 13 January ) and with [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Kirchner  ] ( at a 19 January energy summit ) . 
We expect that you will have 15 or 20 minutes with [PER Amorim  ] , immediately before or just after an expanded discussion with Under Secretary for [MISC South American  ] Affairs [PER Jose Eduardo Felicio  ] . 
With [PER U/S Felicio  ] , it may be worth highlighting the importance of continued consultation between our missions in [LOC La Paz  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] 's Ambassador there , [PER Antonino Mena Goncalves  ] , is a seasoned and pro-U.S. diplomat who has regular contact with our Ambassador ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Finally , your meeting with [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] Minister [PER Felix  ] offers a chance to discuss in detail the grittier , real-world worries of [MISC Brazilian  ] law enforcement and intelligence services about the increased threats a [PER Morales  ] presidency may bring in the arenas of narcotrafficking and other cross-border criminal activities . 
[MISC Bolivian  ] cocaine products are a mainstay of low-cost drugs consumed in [LOC Brazil  ] and trafficked by Rio and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's violent gangs , and senior personnel in [PER Felix  ] 's GSI have expressed deep concern to us and [LOC Washington  ] visitors that trends will worsen under [PER Morales  ] . 
Your meeting with [PER Felix  ] ( who recently returned from consultations in [LOC Washington  ] on counter-terrorism issues ) is a venue for discussing bilateral cooperation to deal with [MISC Bolivia-origin  ] narcotrafficking and present our initial assessments of where [PER Morales  ] is likely to go in terms of regulating coca production and continuing to work with us , the [MISC Brazilians  ] and others on counternarcotics programs .
