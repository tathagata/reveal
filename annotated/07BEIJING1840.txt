( C ) Summary . 
[ORG Zhejiang Province Communist Party  ] Secretary [PER Xi Jinping  ] , a contender to succeed President [PER Hu Jintao  ] in 2012/2013 , describes [ORG Zhejiang  ] as a driving force behind national economic growth . 
[ORG Zhejiang  ] ranks high for income , low for income disparities , and makes substantial contributions to migrant worker employment and transfer payments of fiscal revenue to the [ORG Central Government  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] dismissed concerns about overheating , noting that the faster his province grows , the greater the amount of revenues that the province will transfer to the [ORG Central Government  ] . 
Those revenues also support economic development in comparatively poor regions in [LOC Central  ] and [LOC Western China  ] . 
Provincial party and government officials are regularly informed of citizens’ complaints and plan to address recurring concerns about education , affordable housing and healthcare . 
The provincial [ORG Communist Party  ] is committed to building the legal underpinnings of [MISC China’s  ] socialist market economy . 
[ORG National People’s Congress  ] passage of the [ORG Property Law  ] will be beneficial to building [MISC China’s  ] market economy and to [ORG Zhejiang  ] . 
Unification of corporate tax rates will be a great benefit to [ORG Zhejiang  ] companies while not deterring new foreign investment . 
[PER Xi  ] expressed satisfaction with his May 2006 visit to the [LOC United States  ] . 
He is a fan of [ORG Hollywood World War II  ] movies and criticizes [MISC Chinese  ] moviemakers for neglecting values they should promote . 
His frank and friendly dinner discussion with the Ambassador included several comparisons that [PER Xi  ] made to other provinces where other leading contenders now hold leadership roles , comparisons in which [ORG Zhejiang  ] looks better . 
End Summary . 
Booming [ORG Zhejiang  ] Is a [ORG National Economic Leader  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At a March 11 dinner hosted by the Ambassador at his residence , [ORG Zhejiang Party  ] Secretary [PER Xi Jinping  ] responded to a series of questions about [ORG Zhejiang Provincial  ] economic performance with an impressive array of data and interesting observations . 
[ORG Zhejiang Province’s  ] exports surpassed USD 100 billion in 2006 , an increase of 31 percent over 2005 , [PER Xi  ] said . 
Sixty percent of those 2006 exports were from private enterprises , and the 2006 rate of increase of exports for those private enterprises amounted to 40 percent . 
While unable to provide an immediate savings rate figure for [ORG Zhejiang  ] residents , [PER Xi  ] asserted that most [ORG Zhejiang  ] residents have more than enough money to cover expenses for basic needs . 
Prudential savings nonetheless remain high in recognition of the incomplete nature of [MISC China’s  ] social security system and to prepare for possible future consumption items such as health care . 
While a small proportion of the province’s population remains near poverty and requires assistance from government , perhaps 20 percent of Zhejiang’s approximately 50 million residents are high income earners within the [MISC Chinese  ] context . 
They don’t know how to spend all their money , [PER Xi  ] said . 
[MISC China’s  ] stock markets are not mature and thus hold risks unattractive to many [MISC Chinese  ] , and the investment fund industry is likewise immature and unattractive . 
The Ambassador interjected that Treasury Secretary [PER Paulson  ] had discussed [MISC China’s  ] capital markets and financial sector reform in a speech in [LOC Shanghai  ] just three days earlier and presented a [MISC Chinese  ] text of Secretary Paulson’s speech to Secretary [PER Xi  ] . 
SIPDIS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In their search for money-making opportunities and wealth preservation strategies , [PER Xi  ] continued , many rich [MISC Chinese  ] cannot find proper outlets for their cash . 
This helps feed illegal financial activities , such as deceptive claims on the [MISC Internet  ] and private but illegal banks and investment funds that claim to pay higher interest rates than are generally available in [LOC China  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Government and the [MISC Chinese  ] people place high hopes that the bilateral dialogue mechanism established through the [ORG Strategic Economic Dialogue  ] ( [ORG SED  ] ) can help solve some practical problems in [MISC China’s  ] financial sectors . 
Secretary [PER Xi  ] said he hopes that Secretary [PER Paulson  ] and the Ambassador will play important SIPDIS roles in the [ORG SED  ] as it moves forward . 
[PER Xi  ] added that he hopes the [LOC United States  ] [ORG Congress  ] will show enough patience to allow Secretary [PER Paulson  ] sufficient time to solve some of these SIPDIS problems. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Xi  ] proudly and easily rolled off numerous [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001840 002 OF 007 [ORG Zhejiang  ] provincial economic data . 
Provincial GDP increased 13.6 percent in 2006 , with per capita GDP now USD 4,000 -- well , USD 3,975 to be exact , he clarified . 
Only [LOC Guangdong  ] , [LOC Jiangsu  ] and [LOC Shandong  ] have greater provincial GDPs , and on a per capita GDP basis , [ORG Zhejiang  ] ranks first among all provinces and only lags the centrally administered cities of [LOC Shanghai  ] , [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Tianjin  ] in this regard . 
Per capita GDP in the provincial capital of [LOC Hangzhou  ] is now about USD 6000 and in the port city of [LOC Ningbo  ] now about USD 6500 . 
[ORG Zhejiang  ] ranks first in the nation in fiscal revenue and per capita disposable income , too. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Zhejiang  ] gets to keep about half of the fiscal revenue collected in the province , with about half sent to the [ORG Central Government  ] . 
In 2006 , [ORG Zhejiang  ] collected 256 billion renminbi in fiscal revenue ( 90 percent in taxes , 10 percent in items not clearly identified in Xi’s comments ) , of which 130 billion [ORG RMB  ] was retained for local uses . 
Furthermore , fiscal revenue data do not include other funds available to the government , such as government investment funds , social security funds , or tariffs collected by Customs officials at [ORG Zhejiang  ] ports of entry ( the latter funds go directly to the [ORG Central Government  ] , [PER Xi  ] added ) . 
[PER Xi  ] said that income for all levels of government generated from all sources in [ORG Zhejiang  ] in 2006 was probably near 500 billion [ORG RMB  ] . 
Dismissive of Overheating Concerns ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked whether [ORG Central Government  ] officials are concerned about possible economic overheating in [ORG Zhejiang  ] . 
Secretary [PER Xi  ] replied that the faster [ORG Zhejiang  ] grows , the more revenue the [ORG Central Government  ] receives . 
It is Zhejiang’s hope that the [ORG Central Government  ] will keep the share of provincial fiscal revenue that [ORG Zhejiang  ] must send to the [ORG Central Government  ] stable . 
The [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] is considering raising that share , a possibility which [PER Xi  ] opposes . 
Making the cake bigger ( i.e. , growing Zhejiang’s economy ) will make their piece bigger , too ( i.e. , a fixed percentage of a larger whole will bring an increase in absolute value of funds transferred to the [ORG Central Government  ] ) . 
Many cities in [LOC Eastern China  ] are concerned about this issue . 
[PER Xi  ] hopes that Finance Minister [PER Jin Renqing  ] will not think about or act upon this possible increase in revenue sharing burden . 
[PER Shouldering Burdens  ] of [LOC Central  ] and [LOC Western China  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Another issue about which [ORG Zhejiang  ] officials are very concerned is the gap in income and economic development levels between the wealthier [LOC East Coast  ] regions and [MISC China’s  ] [LOC Central  ] and [MISC Western  ] regions . 
Some of the fiscal revenue generated in [ORG Zhejiang  ] is allocated to assigned counties and communities elsewhere in [LOC China  ] , including some of the highest altitude administrative units in [LOC Xizang  ] ( [LOC Tibet  ] ) and [LOC Xinjiang  ] , the [LOC Fuling  ] area of [LOC Chongqing Municipality  ] , two impoverished areas in [LOC Sichuan Province  ] ( one of which is [LOC Nanchong  ] ) and certain Miao ethnic minority areas of [LOC Guizhou  ] . 
Some of these destinations in [LOC Western China  ] can themselves only raise 10 - 30 percent of their annual local government expenditures , while in assigned areas in [LOC Central China  ] that proportion may increase to 50 percent . 
Transfer payments to local governments in [LOC Central  ] and [LOC Western China  ] actually come in part from provincial contributions , [PER Xi  ] underscored , lessening the burden of the [ORG Central Government  ] . 
While [ORG Zhejiang  ] sends about 50 percent of its fiscal revenue to the Center , [LOC Shanghai  ] must contribute an even higher share , about 65 percent . 
An Important Destination for Migrant Workers -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Zhejiang  ] makes two other important contributions to the national economy . 
First , [ORG Zhejiang  ] hosts [MISC China’s  ] second largest population of migrant workers , 14 .5 million . 
Only [LOC Guangdong  ] hosts more . 
The ratio of Zhejiang’s permanent residents ( about 50 million ) to migrants is a little over 3:1 . 
[ORG Zhejiang  ] thus makes an important contribution to addressing [MISC China’s  ] employment challenges . 
There is a cost with having so many migrant workers , since 65 percent of issues requiring Public Security attention ( i.e. , crimes ) are caused by migrant workers . 
[PER Xi  ] clarified that migrant workers are defined as those who stay for work purposes for less than four months . 
Those who stay for more than four months in a [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001840 003 OF 007 locale are counted as residents . 
Furthermore , in the large number of migrant workers seeking work in [ORG Zhejiang  ] are a great many who come to this comparatively rich province from less affluent other provinces and cities . 
[PER Xi  ] contrasted his large number of provincial outsiders with the situation in [LOC Jiangsu Province  ] , where , he said , many of the migrants are persons from north of the [LOC Yangtze  ] who are seeking employment in locations south of the [LOC Yangtze  ] , still in their own home province . 
An Important [PER Contributor  ] to Economic Development Elsewhere --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The other important economic contribution by [ORG Zhejiang  ] is the role of 4.4 million businesspersons from [ORG Zhejiang  ] are working outside the province elsewhere in [LOC China  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] said [ORG Central Government  ] data does not report the economic impact of these businesspersons . 
While there is little foreign direct investment in [LOC Central  ] and [LOC Western China  ] , including little from the [LOC United States  ] , there is considerable investment and business activity in those regions by [ORG Zhejiang  ] businesspersons . 
Those 4.4 million extra-provincial [ORG Zhejiang  ] businesspersons generate another nearly one trillion [ORG RMB  ] more in GDP nationwide - nearly as much as the province . 
Another 1 million [ORG Zhejiang  ] businesspersons live overseas , often building international business links . 
So one must recognize that [ORG Zhejiang  ] has been a driver of the whole nation’s economic growth. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Nearly all other provinces have sent delegations to [ORG Zhejiang  ] to study the province’s experience and success . 
In recent days , delegations from [LOC Xinjiang  ] , [LOC Sichuan  ] and [LOC Jiangxi  ] had scheduled upcoming appointments to visit and study [ORG Zhejiang  ] , bringing large delegations that will include county-level [ORG Communist Party  ] secretaries . 
Secretary [PER Xi  ] quoted [ORG Jiangxi Provincial Party  ] Secretary [PER Meng Jianzhu  ] as saying he and others have much to learn from Zhejiang’s development path . 
The experiences of coastal cities such as [LOC Shenzhen  ] and [LOC Shanghai  ] that are destinations for high levels of foreign investment are not suitable development models . 
Income Gap and [ORG Urbanization Rate  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Ambassador inquired about income disparities within [ORG Zhejiang Province  ] . 
[ORG Zhejiang  ] has the second lowest provincial urban/rural income ratio in the nation , at 2.45:1 . 
[LOC Jiangsu  ] is first , at 2.1:1 , while the national average is 3.3:1 . 
However , Zhejiang’s ratio may increase slightly , due to faster income growth for urban residents ( 10.9 percent in 2006 ) than for rural residents ( 9.3 percent in 2006 ) . 
While the ratio may worsen slightly , [PER Xi  ] said , the important fact to recognize is that income levels are rising significantly in [ORG Zhejiang  ] regardless of being a city dweller or rural resident . 
Zhejiang’s population is now about 56 percent urbanized . 
With respect to income of urban residents , [ORG Zhejiang  ] has ranked first in [LOC China  ] for the last six years . 
With respect to income of rural residents , [ORG Zhejiang  ] has ranked first for the last 22 years . 
[PER Xi  ] again volunteered a comparison between [ORG Zhejiang  ] and [LOC Jiangsu  ] . 
Jiangsu’s total average income is less than that of [ORG Zhejiang  ] , and the highest income level in [LOC Jiangsu  ] , in the city of [LOC Suzhou  ] , is only at the level of the average income level for the whole of [ORG Zhejiang Province  ] . 
The average income level in Zhejiang’s capital of [LOC Hangzhou  ] , however , is about the same as the average income level in [LOC Shanghai.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG Zhejiang  ] has maintained these remarkable results because it is an economy of the grassroots -- the common people choose their own development paths , [PER Xi  ] continued . 
[ORG Zhejiang  ] is an economy of counties and towns ( implying not being a province with a heavy hand of central economic decision making ) . 
Of the top 100 most affluent counties in [LOC China  ] ( criteria for ranking not clearly explained by [PER Xi  ] ) , 30 of Zhejiang’s total 60 counties are among them . 
At the township level , 268 [ORG Zhejiang  ] towns rank in the top 1000 towns in [LOC China  ] . 
Of Zhejiang’s total nine provincial-level municipalities , seven rank in [MISC China’s  ] top 100 , and the other two are ranked between 101 and 110 . 
Hearing from the [ORG Grassroots Level  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked how provincial party and government officials hear from the citizenry and what are the [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001840 004 OF 007 most frequent concerns or complaints directed to [ORG Zhejiang  ] officials . 
Secretary [PER Xi  ] said provincial officials have many sources of information , many of them designed by [ORG Provincial Party  ] Secretary General [PER Li Qiang  ] , to whom [PER Xi  ] turned for comment . 
Mr. [PER Li  ] explained that the major source of news on the views of the citizenry remains letters . 
About 150,000 letters were delivered to [ORG Zhejiang  ] offices last year . 
The provincial government website provides a link for submission of e-mails from the public . 
Party Secretary [PER Xi  ] and provincial government leaders from the Governor on down often lead delegations to the counties to listen to the voices of the citizens . 
Provincial officials spend more than 100 days per year conducting research with specific industries or in different areas of the province to gather firsthand information . 
Government officials can also submit information to [PER Xi  ] at any time . 
Media reports on provincial developments are an additional source of news . 
The provincial [ORG Communist Party  ] itself also gathers information from the public . 
So , the [ORG Provincial Party  ] Secretary has uninterrupted access to the views of the general public , [PER Li  ] concluded . 
Concerns about Education , Housing and [ORG Health Care Common  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG Zhejiang  ] residents are most concerned about three basic issues: education , affordable housing , and health care , Secretary [PER Xi  ] said . 
The government must take a realistic attitude in addressing these concerns . 
While not all concerns can or should be addressed fully - for instance , not every child in the cities and in the countryside will matriculate to the highest ranked universities -- the government should act to ensure that all children receive an education , people have basic affordable housing , and all residents have access to at least basic medical care . 
[ORG Zhejiang  ] is doing a good job in all these respects , [PER Xi  ] asserted , even leading the whole country . 
While [LOC China  ] has a per capita GDP level of about USD 1000 , [ORG Zhejiang  ] is already at about USD 4000 . 
This leads to higher expectations for the work of provincial officials and party leaders . 
So new proposals will be forthcoming on how to improve the lives of [ORG Zhejiang  ] residents . 
[ORG Officials’ Work Styles Another Common Concern  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Another area in which dissatisfaction has been expressed regards the working style of government and party officials , [PER Xi  ] added . 
We will make energetic efforts to improve on this score . 
Surely the situation will improve in the long term but there is a long way to go . 
With 70 million persons holding membership in the [ORG Communist Party of China  ] , it should not be surprising that several thousand may be problem cases . 
However , the complaint letters from the people show the people still have faith in the [ORG Party and  ] hope the [ORG Party will  ] solve such problems within the [ORG Party .  ] 
For the present , the people will not take to the streets to complain about officials’ work styles . 
While there are many problem makers in the [ORG Party , the Party  ] also counts among its members the elite of society . 
Crime and Wastefulness , Too --------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Xi  ] briefly mentioned crime and government waste as other topics of public complaint . 
He did not elaborate any further on crime , but noted that once basic needs for food and clothing have been met , some officials have become wasteful in their use of administrative resources , seeking extravagance in their lifestyles . 
More guidance from the government is needed in such cases , in Xi’s view . 
He closed his comments on this topic by recalling that [LOC China  ] is a big country , with a population exceeding one billion persons . 
When you multiply something by more than one billion , you get a big number ; but if you divide something , like GDP , by more than one billion , you get a small result . 
[PER Deng Xiaoping  ] was right in observing that [LOC China  ] is still at a primary stage of development . 
Expectations for This [ORG National People’s Congress Session  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG Shanghai Consul General Jarrett  ] , noting the important role of the private sector in the [LOC Zhejiang  ] economy , asked Secretary [PER Xi  ] about the current meeting of the [ORG National BEIJING  ] 00001840 005 OF 007 [ORG People’s Congress  ] and expected passage of a [ORG Property Law  ] . 
Is there any dissent against the proposed law in [LOC Zhejiang  ] ? 
What will the law mean for [ORG Zhejiang  ] ? 
[PER Xi  ] expects that the [ORG NPC  ] will enact the [ORG Property Law  ] during the current session . 
Discussion of a [ORG Property Law  ] began in the sixth [ORG NPC  ] , about twenty years ago . 
Now is the right time to enact the law , passage is needed to support the legal regime of China’s socialist market economy . 
The [ORG Property Law  ] will equally protect state-owned , collectively-owned assets and private properties . 
The law should also protect against stripping of assets from state-owned enterprises and protect the general public’s growing holdings of private property . 
In the past , [LOC China  ] gave lip service to property protection , with the destruction of property in the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] being an example . 
Private property plays a leading role in Zhejiang’s economic development , so nearly everyone in [LOC Zhejiang  ] agrees with passage of the [ORG Property Law  ] . 
With property protection in place , [MISC Chinese  ] can gain even more wealth. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Another measure to be passed in this [ORG NPC  ] session will unify corporate taxation rates for foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies will see their tax rates decline from 33 percent to 25 percent , while FIEs will have a five-year transitional period as their tax holidays are phased out and their tax rates climb to 25 percent . 
Tax unification is very good news for [ORG Zhejiang  ] companies , Secretary [PER Xi  ] said . 
For example , the [ORG Ningbo  ] manufacturer ( heard as [ORG Ningbo  ] [PER Ya Ge Er  ] ) of the suit he wore to dinner has told [PER Xi  ] that the reduction of his corporate tax rate will save his company 40 million [MISC RMB  ] per year . 
Because foreign investors who are newcomers to [LOC China  ] consider more than just the corporate tax rate in selecting overseas investment destinations , the increased tax rate should not significantly hurt them , [PER Xi  ] asserted . 
Rule of Law in [ORG Zhejiang Province  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked for Secretary Xi’s views on the development and implementation of rule of law in [LOC Zhejiang  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] replied that the [ORG Party Provincial Committee  ] has proposed in 2006 to build [LOC Zhejiang  ] into a province ruled by law . 
Laws are a basis for the socialist market economy . 
Provincial officials will promote public awareness of laws and do their best to enhance enforcement of laws . 
The [ORG Provincial People’s Congress  ] will cobine laws as passed at the national level by the [ORG NPC  ] with Zhejiang’s local conditions . 
The government and the [ORG Party will  ] promote rule of law . 
A provincial working group on rule of law has been established , and [PER Li Qiang  ] is Director General of that working group . 
Local laws should accord with central laws . 
[LOC Zhejiang  ] can provide some pioneering efforts in rule of law for the whole country . 
Xi’s 2006 Visit to the [LOC United States  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked Secretary [PER Xi  ] for details of his May 2006 visit to the [LOC United States  ] and whether he had had opportunity to exchange views with members of [ORG Congress  ] while in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] indeed had met with members of [ORG Congress  ] , and found those he met with quite friendly towards [LOC China  ] . 
One member described himself or herself as formerly quite anti-China but his/her views had begun to shift . 
[PER Xi  ] and his delegation had been worried that [ORG Falun Gong  ] practitioners might pose a threat during their visit , and accordingly had some security assistants accompany them on their visit . 
All had proceeded smoothly with no encounters with the [ORG Falun Gong  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] said he and other [MISC Chinese  ] officials are not worried or annoyed by noise or protests during visits but are worried about the legal consequences and burdens if served papers as part of stateside legal actions. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) The May 2006 trip had proven fruitful for [LOC Zhejiang  ] , Secretary [PER Xi  ] continued , with several important contracts [MISC SIPDIS  ] signed that only more recently or even in the near future will be implemented . 
Among those agreements is one involving [ORG Federal Express  ] , which will have ceremonies at the [LOC Hangzhou  ] ( [LOC Zhejiang Province’s  ] capital ) airport for the construction or opening of a new distribution center . 
[ORG Citibank  ] decided to accelerate plans to establish a branch in [LOC Hangzhou  ] . 
[PER Xi  ] has written to [LOC China  ] Banking Regulatory Chairman [PER Liu Mingkang  ] to urge accelerated processing of that application and , while expressing confidence the application will be approved soon , [PER Xi  ] commented to his colleagues that additional lobbying may [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001840 006 OF 007 be in order . 
The Ambassador thanked [PER Xi  ] for his support to [ORG Motorola  ] for that company’s production plans in [LOC Hangzhou  ] . 
[ORG Motorola  ] is doing well in [LOC Hangzhou  ] , with Hangzhou’s sales revenue nearing 45 billion renminbi ( over USD 5 billion ) in 2006 , just slightly less than [ORG Motorola  ] sales revenue generated at its [LOC Tianjin  ] facilities . 
[LOC Hangzhou  ] sales revenue will surely eclipse [LOC Tianjin  ] sales revenue in 2007 . 
Finally , the 2006 visit to the [LOC United States  ] had included commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of sister state relations between [LOC Zhejiang  ] and [LOC New Jersey  ] . 
A [LOC New Jersey  ] university decided to set up a branch campus in [LOC Wenzhou  ] in [LOC Zhejiang  ] , a plan already approved by all relevant provincial authorities but still awaiting approval by the central [ORG Ministry of Education  ] . 
A WWII [ORG Hollywood Movie Aficionado  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) The Ambassador also asked Secretary [PER Xi  ] about his recent movie viewing , recalling that [PER Xi  ] had told him in their meeting one year ago that he had recently seen and tremendously enjoyed “Saving Private Ryan.” Had Secretary [PER Xi  ] seen other recent [MISC American  ] movies that he had enjoyed ? 
[PER Xi  ] replied that he already owns the “Flags of Our Fathers” DVD , but hopes to view it during the [ORG Lunar New Year  ] holidays had gone unfulfilled . 
He had seen and enjoyed “The [PER Departed.” Xi  ] said he particularly likes [LOC Hollywood  ] movies about [MISC World War II  ] and hopes [LOC Hollywood  ] will continue to make them . 
[LOC Hollywood  ] makes those movies well , and such [LOC Hollywood  ] movies are grand and truthful . 
[MISC Americans  ] have a clear outlook on values and clearly demarcate between good and evil . 
In [MISC American  ] movies , good usually prevails . 
In contrast , “Curse of the [MISC Golden Flower  ] , ” a recently popular [MISC Chinese  ] movie directed by [PER Zhang Yimou  ] and starring [PER Gong Li  ] ( she of “Miami Vice” movie stardom ) had been confusing to [PER Xi  ] . 
Some [MISC Chinese  ] moviemakers neglect values they should promote. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [LOC America  ] is a powerful nation in terms of culture because [MISC Americans  ] say what they should say , [PER Xi  ] elaborated . 
Too many [MISC Chinese  ] moviemakers cater to foreigners’ interests or preconceptions , sometimes vulgarly so . 
He criticized [PER Zhang Yimou  ] by name as well as the kungfu action movie genre. “Crouching Tiger , [ORG Hidden Dragon”  ] and “Wu Ji” and imperial palace intrigues -- all are the same , talking about bad things in imperial palaces . 
Most are not nominated for [MISC Oscars  ] or other awards , so to some extent it can be said that such movies are not worth very much . 
The Ambassador noted that a [MISC Chinese  ] film about [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] orphans had just garnered the [PER Oscar  ] for best short documentary . 
[PER Xi  ] expressed awareness of the movie , noting that the director is a female overseas [MISC Chinese  ] ( but [PER Xi  ] never said whether he had seen that documentary ) . 
[PER Xi  ] recalled that a low cost , very good [MISC Chinese  ] movie by the director [PER Jia Zhangke  ] had recently won a [MISC Golden Lion  ] award at the [ORG Venice Film Festival  ] . 
Returning to “Flags of Our Fathers , ” [PER Xi  ] said he had come to understand that the flag raising on Iwo Jima did not mark the end of the battle . 
The [MISC Japanese  ] were still in holes and caves and the battle continued . 
He expressed particular admiration for WWII movies set in the [LOC Pacific  ] theater of operations and expressed a strong desire to visit Guadalcanal. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) Many [MISC Chinese  ] had died in the [MISC Anti-Japanese War  ] ( as WWII is most often referred to in [LOC Mainland China  ] ) . 
The last one to two decades have been a period of historical importance , with peace and rapid economic development . 
[LOC China  ] should use this opportunity to focus on improving the living conditions of the people . 
[PER Xi  ] noted some earlier but brief periods of peace and economic development in [LOC China  ] , referring to two emperors’ reigns in the [LOC Han Dynasty  ] , the reign of the first emperor in the [LOC Tang Dynasty  ] , and the consecutive reigns of [PER Emperors Kangxi  ] , [PER Yongzheng  ] and [PER Qianlong  ] in the [LOC Ming Dynasty  ] . 
It was a crime that such periods did not last longer . 
The current period of peace and rapid economic development should be extended as long as possible . 
Comment ------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Xi  ] , regarded by many Embassy contacts to be one of the three leading contenders to succeed President [PER Hu Jintao  ] in 2012/2013 as [ORG Communist Party  ] Chairman and President of [LOC China  ] , certainly exhibited an easy and proficient familiarity with his relatively prosperous province’s economic data and development strengths . 
Comparisons to [LOC Jiangsu Province  ] and reference to [LOC Henan  ] were [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001840 007 OF 007 perhaps inevitable for an official with the strong ambitions he reportedly holds . 
The other two leading contenders to succeed President [PER Hu  ] are [PER Li Yuanchao  ] ( Ambassador’s March 8 dinner reported ref A ) , current Party Secretary in [LOC Jiangsu  ] , and [PER Li Keqiang  ] , past Party Secretary in [MISC Henan  ] ( Ambassador’s March 12 dinner reported ref B ) .
