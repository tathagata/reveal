( C ) Summary: One hundred days after [LOC Germany  ] 's black-yellow coalition took office , a strong , unified government led by Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] has yet to materialize . 
The much anticipated “dream coalition” comprised of [PER Merkel  ] 's [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) , its [MISC Bavarian  ] sister the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) , and [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) which promised a unified conservative approach to the economy and “like minded” thinking on social welfare , the environment , and foreign policy has become bogged down in party politics with no end in sight . 
Recent polls show that the bickering may be at least partly to blame for the [ORG FDP  ] 's 5.6 percent fall in the polls , with it now down to 9 percent from its historic 14.6 percent election results ( see septel ) and the [ORG CSU  ] plummet to an historic low of 41 percent . 
Indeed one minister is now threatening resignation . 
Sources from the three coalition parties have admitted to problems , blaming the other coalition parties , and downplaying their significance . 
[PER Merkel  ] has come under criticism within her own party for not taking strong public stands and reining in her coalition partners , instead staying above the political fray . 
The opposition , particularly the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) , is trying to capitalize on this “divided we rule” coalition with an eye toward unseating a teetering [MISC CDU-FDP  ] coalition in [LOC North-Rhine Westphalia  ] ( [LOC NRW  ] ) in May elections , thereby tipping the [MISC CDU-FDP  ] [ORG Bundesrat  ] majority in its favor . 
[PER Merkel  ] is counting on better economic and political indicators after the [LOC NRW  ] election followed by the release of the annual tax forecasts to congeal the coalition . 
If the [MISC CDU/FDP  ] coalition fails in [LOC NRW  ] , coalition divisions are likely to become more pronounced . 
End Summary . 
Off to a [LOC Rocky Start  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Concluding a coalition agreement in only three weeks , prior to her November 2 departure for [LOC Washington  ] to address [ORG Congress  ] and in time for the 9 November 20 year anniversary of [MISC German  ] unity may have been Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's first and only major success to date in marshaling coalition unity . 
But the feat may have had consequences . 
The haste to sign has left half-resolved differences on tax cuts , economic policy , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , health care , data protection ( see reftel ) and other issues that continue to gurgle to the surface . 
Important to recognize is that each party is operating under its own political pressures from different voting constituencies . 
The [ORG FDP  ] 's main goal is to deliver on campaign promises – particularly tax relief – and shore up its base , the [ORG CSU  ] is desperate to regain its dominance in [LOC Bavaria  ] , and the [ORG CDU  ] is seeking to rebuild its eroded voter base . 
All three parties and the opposition are now gearing up for May 9 elections in [LOC NRW  ] . 
This election in [LOC Germany  ] 's most populous state , referred to as a “small national election , ” is regarded as a partial vote of confidence on the national coalition , and will determine the [ORG Bundesrat  ] majority . 
If the [MISC NRW CDU-FDP  ] coalition fails to return to government , the national [MISC CDU-FDP  ] coalition will fall by six seats in the [ORG Bundesrat  ] – from 37 to 31 seats – it will lose its majority . 
Such a loss could well hamper the government 's ability to pass major financial or economic legislation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Each of the three coalition parties have pointed to the others for instigating tension . 
[ORG CDU  ] party contact xxxxx accused the [ORG FDP  ] of functioning as if it were still in the opposition . 
Senior [ORG SPD  ] parliamentarian [PER Hans-Ulrich Klose  ] attributed the coalition strains to the [ORG FDP  ] adjusting to being in government after 11 years in the opposition . 
[ORG FDP  ] contact xxxxx accused the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] of reacting to their own internal problems: for the [ORG CDU  ] , its controversy over the [LOC Kunduz  ] airstrike , and for the [ORG CSU  ] , its involvement in a major bank scandal . 
The [ORG FDP  ] also points to the [ORG CSU  ] 's strong rivalry with the [ORG FDP  ] , with which it now governs in [LOC Bavaria  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] is still trying to recover from its historic low voting results in the September 2008 state elections , which forced it for the first time in 46 years to govern within a coalition . 
All parties , however , have downplayed the significance of the feuds , with senior [ORG CDU  ] party operative xxxxx explaining in January that the party leaderships are just now settling in after an exhausting election campaign and intense coalition negotiations . 
He hoped ( more than predicted ) that the parties would soon settle into a more cooperative relationship . 
In January , [PER Merkel  ] called a small summit for coalition leadership with [PER Westerwelle  ] and [PER Seehofer  ] to smooth things over and commit to a new beginning . 
While the coalition 's political edginess receded for a time , policy divisions continue to surface . 
[ORG CDU/CSU  ] vs [ORG FDP  ] – the Economy ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While [ORG CDU/CSU  ] and [ORG FDP  ] voters may be the most likely to cross over to the other party , their mainstay voter bases are different , with the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] appealing to economically conservative voters who also support the social market economy , but are socially conservative . 
The [ORG FDP  ] base is composed of free-market advocates , who are socially liberal and strong advocates of civil liberties . 
The [ORG FDP  ] 's campaign and continuing mantra has been for much larger tax cuts in 2011 , worth 20-24 billion euros , apparently at the expense of both coalition unity and the better judgment of economic experts . 
The cuts would make getting the deficit back under the [ORG EU  ] ceiling of 3 percent of GDP by 2013 nearly impossible . 
National debt will rise from 66 percent of GDP to 80 percent . 
There are growing public concerns over rising debt , but also about perceived disarray in the coalition 's tax and budget policies . 
[PER Merkel  ] insists that a decision regarding the tax reduction plans will not be taken before May , when the overall tax revenue forecast is due . 
Waiting until May also means the coalition will not have to go public with unpopular consolidation measures until after the [LOC NRW  ] elections . 
Finance Minister [PER Schaeuble  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) appears unenthusiastic at best about further tax cuts . 
He has already said deficit reduction measures would have to start in 2011 . 
The [ORG CSU  ] has also called the [ORG FDP  ] 's call for speedy tax relief measures “unrealistic” despite the fact that it had included such a demand during its election campaign . 
The most recent squabble between the [ORG FDP  ] and [ORG CSU  ] is over [ORG FDP Health Minister Roesler  ] 's plans for health care reform which foresees more care options and the introduction of competition . 
[PER Seehofer  ] has rejected the proposal , holding fast against radical changes to the system . 
[PER Roesler  ] has indicated he might resign over this issue . 
Foreign Policy -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Coalition feuding over economic and tax policy has trumped coalition divisions over foreign policy , although FM [PER Westerwelle  ] has managed a few disruptions in the latter . 
As a harbinger of hard times to come , as one of his first actions , [PER Westerwelle  ] opposed the naming of [ORG CDU Bundestag  ] member [PER Erika Steinbach  ] to the foundation “Flight Expulsion and [ORG Reconciliation”  ] citing possible damage to relations with [LOC Poland  ] . 
As President of [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG Federation of Expellees  ] , [PER Steinbach  ] is disliked in [LOC Poland  ] . 
While the numbers are disputed , the expellee community , which mainly votes [ORG CSU  ] or [ORG CDU  ] , has exerted influence on the issue . 
National and [ORG State CDU  ] and [ORG CSU  ] politicians came out in support of [PER Steinbach  ] with only [PER Merkel  ] keeping mum . 
The controversy continues , despite ongoing attempts to reach a compromise , threatening to drain coalition attention and good-will. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Coalition strains have also surfaced on the issue of overseas deployments . 
Regarding a troop increase in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Westerwelle  ] 's position was at first muddled , as he tried to reflect his party 's general negativity toward overseas military deployments while at the same time tending to his role as [LOC Germany  ] 's chief diplomat in the run-up to the [ORG London Conference  ] . 
In the end , he ( together with the opposition ) likely played a role in achieving a lower-than-expected troop increase . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] also convinced the [ORG CDU  ] to agree on gradually reducing [MISC German  ] participation in [LOC UNIFIL  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] also rocked the coalition boat on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with [PER Seehofer  ] expressing general skepticism on a troop increase , although he later came around . 
In addition , [ORG CSU  ] Secretary General Dobrindt has ridiculed the federal government 's reconciliation concept in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a “cash for clunkers version for the [ORG Taliban.” Comment  ] --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] may have ironically cast off the yoke of the [ORG Grand Coalition  ] only now to be encumbered with a new [MISC FDP-CSU  ] double yoke , restrained by an [ORG FDP  ] bent on delivering on campaign promises and a [ORG CSU  ] distracted over its rivalry with the [ORG FDP  ] and internal problems . 
High expectations for the “dream coalition” are certainly in part to blame for the current polls , with popularity numbers for [PER Merkel  ] and [PER Westerwelle  ] both having suffered . 
Worried most , however , are the [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG FDP  ] politicians in [LOC NRW  ] , who fear that the national coalition 's squabbling could negatively impact their own chances in the May 9 elections . 
The leadership threesome – [PER Merkel  ] , [PER Westerwelle  ] , and [PER Seehofer  ] – may make an extra effort to get along , or at least appear to get along , as the [LOC NRW  ] elections near . 
It is not clear that [PER Westerwelle  ] and the [ORG FDP  ] , however , believe that it is the squabbling that is unhelpful , or rather its own inability to deliver as yet on certain campaign promises . 
If it is the latter , more coalition tensions could ensue as [PER Westerwelle  ] begins to expend more energy as [ORG FDP  ] Chairman and less as Foreign Minister , gearing up his party for its [LOC NRW  ] campaign . 
[LOC Berlin  ] is once again becoming bogged down in political squabbles as the [LOC NRW  ] elections near. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
