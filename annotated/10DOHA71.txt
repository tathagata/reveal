LeBaron  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . -------------- ( C ) KEY POINTS -------------- -- Prime Minister [PER Hamad bin  ] [PER Jassim Al Thani  ] ( [ORG HBJ  ] ) told Senator [PER John Kerry February  ] 13 that we will all lose us 4-6 months of time in pursuing the recently announced " proximity talks " between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
-- [ORG HBJ  ] underscored that it is a mistake to ignore [ORG Hamas  ] in seeking a lasting agreement . 
-- From [LOC Qatar  ] 's perspective , there are differences in style and approaches between the two wings of [ORG Hamas  ] , but in principle both are fundamentally aligned . 
[ORG Hamas  ] leaders in [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] can accept recognition of [LOC Israel  ] , but must calibrate the timing very carefully because [ORG Hamas  ] supporters are not ready for this change . 
-- According to [ORG HBJ  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] has a vested interest in dragging out [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation talks for as long as possible . 
[LOC Egypt  ] " has no end game ; serving as broker of the talks is [LOC Egypt  ] 's only business interest with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" -- The Prime Minister suggested that one or two [ORG GCC  ] members , [LOC Morocco  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] form the core membership of an [ORG Arab League  ] committee to address [MISC Palestinian-Israeli  ] concerns . 
Giving [LOC Syria  ] a role would create jealousy among the [MISC Arabs  ] , which [ORG HBJ  ] said would help the [LOC U.S.  ] move talks forward . 
-- [ORG HBJ  ] said putting economic pressure on [LOC Iran  ] by targeting its oil revenues is the best way to get [LOC Tehran  ] to rethink its quest for nuclear weapons . 
For the sanctions to work , it would be vital that [LOC Russia  ] and other countries bordering [LOC Iran  ] implement them fully . 
End Key [LOC Points.  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The Chairman of the [ORG Senate Foreign Relations Committee  ] ( [ORG SFRC  ] ) , Senator [PER John Kerry  ] ( [ORG D-MA  ] ) , accompanied by Ambassador , P/E Chief and [ORG SFRC  ] staff [PER Frank Lowenstein  ] and [PER Fatema Sumar  ] , met February 13 with Prime Minister ( and Foreign Minister ) of [LOC Qatar  ] Sheikh [PER Hamad  ] bin [PER Jassim Al Thani  ] ( [ORG HBJ  ] ) . 
[ORG HBJ  ] opened the meeting by observing that President [PER Obama  ] 's presidency had brought a lot of optimism to the region . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] agreed , adding that now we " need to deliver . 
" --------------------------- PROXIMITY TALKS NOT HELPFUL --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG HBJ  ] expressed dissatisfaction that " everyone in the region " seems to have a separate plan for moving ahead on the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] dispute when only one plan was needed -- a plan that both the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] would accept and finalize . 
More disconcerting to [LOC Qatar  ] , he said , was the announcement by Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] that both parties would now engage in " proximity talks . 
" Such talks " will lose us 4-6 months of time , " stated [PER HBJ.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] responded that we " are where we are . 
" He assessed that the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] and dissatisfaction in [LOC Fatah  ] 's ranks in the [LOC West Bank  ] made it difficult for [PER Abu Mazen  ] to " give something to [LOC Israel  ] " that would allow direct negotiations to begin between the parties . 
Add in [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's previous statements on the need for a full settlement freeze , and the ingredients for the [MISC Palestinian  ] people to accept direct talks simply are not there. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Abu Mazen  ] is out on a limb , responded [ORG HBJ  ] . 
" He climbed a tree ( drawing a line in the sand on settlements ) and can't get down . 
" [ORG HBJ  ] suggested that President [PER Obama  ] 's address to the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] at the opening of its current session could serve as a " roadmap " forward: two states ( [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] ) remain the goal , and the establishment of settlements must stop while negotiations take place . 
[ORG HBJ  ] stressed again that the " proximity talks " will cause a " lot of problems . 
" ----------------------------------- NEED FOR [MISC PALESTINIAN  ] RECONCILIATION ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG HBJ  ] told Chairman [PER Kerry  ] he had met recently in [LOC Doha  ] with an [MISC Israeli  ] delegation and had encouraged them to work with [MISC Palestinians  ] of all stripes in the pursuit of peace . 
[ORG HBJ  ] underscored that it is a mistake to work with just one partner , [PER Fatah  ] , and ignore [ORG Hamas  ] . 
Saying this does not mean [ORG DOHA  ] 00000071 002 OF 004 that [LOC Qatar  ] expresses a preference for [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[ORG HBJ  ] pointed out that [PER Abu Mazen  ] had taught in [LOC Qatar  ] for 30 years and remains a friend of [LOC Qatar  ] . 
[LOC Qatar  ] has no differences with him or those around him , but the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) cannot sign off on an agreement on behalf of the [MISC Palestinians  ] where open divisions exist. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG HBJ  ] noted that in conversations [LOC Qatar  ] has held with [ORG Hamas'  ] leadership , it is clear that [ORG Hamas  ] is ready to accept [LOC Israel  ] 's right to exist . 
But the acceptance must come about gradually , not in one day . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] said he had heard this elsewhere , but in his own conversations in [LOC Damascus  ] -- where a many leaders of [ORG Hamas  ] reside -- he did not get the sense that [ORG Hamas  ] was ready to accept [LOC Israel  ] 's existence. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Qatar  ] 's PM observed that the biggest obstacle on the [MISC Palestinian  ] side to an eventual agreement with [LOC Israel  ] is the reconciliation of [ORG Hamas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] . 
[ORG HBJ  ] maintained that it would have happened during the previous [LOC U.S.  ] administration , but President [PER Bush  ] told [PER Abu Mazen  ] not to sign off on it . 
Now , said [ORG HBJ  ] , progress is slow , and bringing the two parties together in the spirit of reconciliation is hampered by [MISC Arab  ] politics . 
Reconciliation can happen , [ORG HBJ  ] asserted , but only " if bigger countries in the region allow it . 
" 8 , ( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] , noting that he had seen [PER Yasser Arafat  ] make the transition from [ORG PLO  ] fighter to signer of an agreement on the [LOC White House  ] lawn , observed that people can come around and change their position . 
But was that the case here ? 
The Senator asked [ORG HBJ  ] if the differences at play between [ORG Hamas'  ] leaders in [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] were too wide to bridge. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) From [ORG HBJ  ] 's perspective , there are differences in style and approaches between the two wings of [ORG Hamas  ] , but in principle both are fundamentally aligned . 
They can accept recognition of [LOC Israel  ] , but have to calibrate the timing very carefully because [ORG Hamas  ] knows that its supporters in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories are not ready for this change . 
[ORG HBJ  ] said [ORG Hamas  ] leaders in [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] are aligned on wanting to open the border crossing at [LOC Rafah  ] , for example , but differ on tactics in reaching this goal . 
The leaderships in [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] consult each other , and no one leader in [ORG Hamas  ] can take a decision alone , reported [PER HBJ.  ] -------------------------------------------- [LOC EGYPT  ] INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS , NOT RESULTS -------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Chairman [PER Kerry  ] asked [ORG HBJ  ] if [ORG Hamas  ] is feeling political pressure from [MISC Gazans  ] over their current living conditions . 
[ORG HBJ  ] responded that anytime people do not have housing , schools or public utilities , their political leaders feel pressure . 
[ORG Hamas  ] , however , has a greater sense of urgency in reconciling with [PER Fatah  ] , observed [ORG HBJ  ] , than does the broker of the talks between the [MISC Palestinian  ] parties. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) According to [PER HBJ  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] -- the broker -- has a vested interest in dragging out the talks for as long as possible . 
[LOC Egypt  ] " has no end game ; serving as broker of the talks is [LOC Egypt  ] 's only business interest with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" [PER HBJ  ] likened the situation to a physician who has only one patient to treat in the hospital . 
If that is your only business , " the physician is going to keep the patient alive but in the hospital for as long as possible . 
" [PER HBJ  ] emphasized that [LOC Qatar  ] , on the other hand , is interested only in bringing about peace in the region -- and as quickly as possible. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Short term , [PER HBJ  ] said [ORG Hamas  ] wants to form with [PER Fatah  ] a unity government and rebuild the [MISC Israeli-inflicted  ] damage in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] , steering the conversation toward [ORG Hamas'  ] long-term aims , acknowledged that [LOC Qatar  ] 's leaders speak frequently with [ORG Hamas  ] . 
The Chairman asked [PER HBJ  ] to explain why [ORG Hamas  ] does not seem " to move when we need [ORG Hamas  ] to move . 
" <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Simply put , answered [PER HBJ  ] , " [ORG Hamas  ] does not trust [LOC Egypt  ] and the Quartet enterprise . 
" [PER HBJ  ] noted that since its inception the Quartet has been anti-Hamas and aligned with the interests of [PER Abu Mazen  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] . 
These partners of the Quartet , observed [PER HBJ  ] , are the very partners who have not delivered a [MISC Palestinian-Israeli  ] agreement. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Returning to his theme that " peace brokers " act in their own self-interest , [PER HBJ  ] observed that President [PER Mubarak  ] of [LOC Egypt  ] is thinking about how his son can take his place and how to stave off the growing strength of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] government , said [PER HBJ  ] , has jailed 10,000 [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] members without bringing court cases against them . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] " people blame [LOC America  ] " now for their plight . 
The shift in mood on the ground is " mostly because of [PER Mubarak  ] and his close ties " to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG DOHA  ] 00000071 003 OF 004 His only utility to the [LOC U.S.  ] is brokering peace between [MISC Palestinians  ] and [MISC Israelis  ] , so he has no interest in taking himself out of the one game he has , underscored [PER HBJ  ] . 
" Tell your friends ( in [LOC Egypt  ] ) they must help themselves . 
" <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) As for [LOC Qatar  ] , " We want to help [PER Abu Mazen  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , " declared [PER HBJ  ] . 
The short-term needs of [MISC Palestinians  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] are acute , said [PER HBJ  ] . 
We need to broker a quick reconciliation between [ORG Hamas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] and move forward quickly on rebuilding [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] asserted that [PER HBJ  ] was preaching to the converted and told the PM he was " shocked by what I saw in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
" <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Continuing to illustrate how [LOC Egypt  ] had not delivered for the [LOC U.S.  ] on [MISC Palestinian  ] issues , [PER HBJ  ] said [LOC Qatar  ] was told in late 2008 that [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] needed the [MISC Egyptians  ] to deal with the crisis in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Yet former [MISC Israeli  ] PM [PER Olmert  ] later complained to [LOC Qatar  ] that [LOC Egypt  ] is a big country and not nimble ; it could not move fast enough . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] pointed out he was in [LOC Cairo  ] at the time [LOC Qatar  ] was calling for an [ORG Arab League Summit  ] in December 2008/January 2009 and asked [PER HBJ  ] for his perspective on the rift between [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] at that time. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER HBJ  ] told Senator [PER Kerry  ] that [PER Mubarak  ] refused to come to [LOC Doha  ] for a meeting of [MISC Arab  ] leaders , preferring that the meeting take place in [LOC Riyadh  ] . 
The request to move the meeting was relayed to [LOC Qatar  ] by the [MISC Saudis  ] , not the [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , as a big country like [LOC Egypt  ] , has a vested interest in keeping [LOC Egypt  ] afloat , said [PER HBJ  ] . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] agreed to host the meeting in [LOC Riyadh  ] not because they objected to traveling to [LOC Doha  ] , but because the [MISC Egyptians  ] did . 
" So we argued over the meeting location " while the [MISC Palestinians  ] suffered , and we in [LOC Qatar  ] " called a meeting and said whoever comes , comes . 
" <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [LOC Qatar  ] is worried , said [PER HBJ  ] , about [LOC Egypt  ] and its people , who are increasingly impatient . 
[PER Mubarak  ] , continued [PER HBJ  ] , says [PER Al Jazeera  ] is the source of [LOC Egypt  ] 's problems . 
This is an excuse . 
[PER HBJ  ] had told [PER Mubarak  ] " we would stop [PER Al Jazeera  ] for a year " if he agreed in that span of time to deliver a lasting settlement for the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
[PER Mubarak  ] said nothing in response , according to [PER HBJ.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Asked his advice on bringing about an agreement between [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER HBJ  ] said President [PER Clinton  ] recognized before leaving office that [LOC Egypt  ] was a problem . 
When President [PER Clinton  ] sought help at the end of his term in reaching a final deal , the [MISC Saudis  ] and [MISC Egyptians  ] did not encourage him , said [PER HBJ  ] . 
" They told him to do what he thinks right . 
" Culturally , said [PER HBJ  ] , that is the way [MISC Arabs  ] say " you are on your own . 
" And President [PER Clinton  ] was , said [PER HBJ.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Now we are at a stage , said [PER HBJ  ] , where [LOC Egypt  ] does not want [ORG Arab League  ] involvement in brokering a reconciliation agreement among the [MISC Palestinians  ] unless the talks bog down . 
[PER HBJ  ] said he had told [PER Abbas  ] that climbing down from his tree on no settlement activity so that talks can go forward will require [MISC Arab  ] support . 
But the [MISC Egyptians  ] won't allow it. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Asked if tabling a more specific plan for peace between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] would help , [PER HBJ  ] said it would be a mistake to table a plan that is too specific . 
[PER HBJ  ] then reiterated that the problem is more with those carrying out the negotiations . 
" The good cooks ( [LOC Egypt  ] ) have not given good food to now . 
" <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] noted that Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] had made a lot of requests of [MISC Arabs  ] but with little success . 
Leaving [LOC Qatar  ] aside , the Chairman asked [PER HBJ  ] for proposed next steps . 
[PER HBJ  ] said he trusts the [MISC Saudis  ] , but because they talk openly to [LOC Egypt  ] and do not want to create more problems for [LOC Egypt  ] than the [MISC Egyptian  ] government already has , it is essential to bring in the small countries and start there. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [PER HBJ  ] suggested one or two [ORG GCC  ] members , [LOC Morocco  ] ( although the King there is hesitant ) and [LOC Syria  ] as the core membership of an [ORG Arab League  ] committee to address [MISC Palestinian-Israeli  ] concerns . 
[PER HBJ  ] told Senator [PER Kerry  ] the inclusion of [LOC Syria  ] might surprise him , but having [LOC Syria  ] play a role would create jealousy among the [MISC Arabs  ] . 
Some jealously and rivalry is just what the [LOC U.S.  ] needs , opined [PER HBJ  ] , to get the process moving. ---------------- [LOC IRAN  ] AND [LOC LEBANON  ] ---------------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Iran  ] , Senator [PER Kerry  ] said he understood [LOC Qatar  ] 's need to find the right balance in dealing with bigger [ORG DOHA  ] 00000071 004 OF 004 neighbors , especially [LOC Iran  ] given the natural gas field both share . 
Due to the working relationship [LOC Qatar  ] maintains with [LOC Iran  ] , the Chairman asked [PER HBJ  ] for his advice as the international community becomes more serious about economic sanctions against [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) [PER HBJ  ] said [LOC Iran  ] 's president views the [LOC U.S.  ] as a country that is overstretched and in difficulty as a result of too many commitments . 
[LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] economy are the three main problems President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] sees . 
[PER HBJ  ] observed that a [MISC Western  ] attack against [LOC Iran  ] for [PER Ahmadinejad  ] would be good politics , because it would allow him to take out his opposition using the war as a pretext . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] asked clarification of whether [PER Ahmadinejad  ] had said these things , or if [PER HBJ  ] inferred them from conversation. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [LOC Qatar  ] 's PM said [PER Ahmadinejad  ] had told him , " We beat the [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] ; the final battle will be in [LOC Iran  ] . 
" <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) [PER HBJ  ] said putting economic pressure on [LOC Iran  ] is the best way to get the leadership to rethink its quest for nuclear weapons . 
To be successful , he told Senator [PER Kerry  ] , [LOC Russia  ] would definitely have to be on board , as would the [MISC Central Asian  ] countries bordering [LOC Iran  ] that provide food and supplies. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) Asked his perception of the state of play with the opposition , [PER HBJ  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] had done a good job of standing back and not becoming the symbol of the opposition . 
Cracks in the regime are appearing . 
It is highly significant that many demonstrators ignored [PER Khamenei  ] when he called on them to stop their protests . 
The four key pillars of [MISC Iranian  ] power -- the court , oil sector , imams , and [ORG Revolutionary Guards  ] --- all must stick with him , stressed [PER HBJ  ] . 
There are cracks in the system , but the downfall of the regime may not be in the cards. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) Asked what the sanctions should target , [PER HBJ  ] said the money that [LOC Iran  ] derives from oil . 
Depriving [LOC Tehran  ] of this revenue would force the regime to negotiate. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] observed that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] was making it easier by his actions . 
There is wide consensus in the Executive and [ORG Legislative  ] branches of [LOC Washington  ] to press ahead . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] warned that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] " should not equate [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] with what he faces . 
" <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) [PER HBJ  ] encouraged Chairman [PER Kerry  ] to bear in mind that [LOC Iran  ] is clever and makes its opponents dizzy in the quest for deals . 
They will keep you working on a deal and then start from scratch with a new interlocutor . 
[PER HBJ  ] stressed that [LOC Iran  ] will make no deal . 
[LOC Iran  ] wants nuclear weapons , and [PER HBJ  ] said he would not be surprised to see [LOC Iran  ] test one to demonstrate to the world its achievement. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) On [LOC Lebanon  ] , Senator [PER Kerry  ] asked if [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] are ratcheting up their weapons stockpiles as part of [LOC Iran  ] 's war against [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER HBJ  ] affirmed that is the case. ---- [LOC IRAQ  ] ---- <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER HBJ  ] told Senator [PER Kerry  ] that Prime Minister [ORG Al-Maliki  ] wants a [LOC Shia  ] state , even though the [MISC Sunnis  ] ( when you count [MISC Kurds  ] and non-Kurds ) have the majority. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( U ) CODEL [PER Kerry  ] has cleared this message .
