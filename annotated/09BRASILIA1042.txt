( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: On August 18 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Exterior Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) , [ORG Division of Intellectual Property  ] ( [ORG DIPI  ] ) , hosted a presentation to interested members of the diplomatic community by the [ORG National Anti-Piracy Council  ] ( [ORG CNCP  ] ) . 
Chaired by the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , [ORG CNCP  ] brings together various ministries and private sector representatives to focus on enforcement issues . 
[ORG CNCP  ] 's MOJ-based Executive Secretary outlined the organization 's new national action plan to combat piracy and its branding campaign designed to encourage the consumption of legitimate goods . 
Representatives of [ORG CNCP  ] member organizations ( both public and private ) responsible for the action plan 's five priority projects provided updates on the content and status of each project . 
While [ORG CNCP  ] 's commitment to enforcement against piracy and counterfeiting recognizes the economic impact of intellectual property ( [MISC IP  ] ) protection , an earlier [MISC MRE-sponsored  ] conference strongly questioned the connection between [MISC IP  ] protection and economic development . 
End summary. -------- NEW NATIONAL PLAN TO COMBAT PIRACY -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On May 28 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG National Anti-Piracy Council  ] ( [ORG CNCP  ] ) launched ( with high level participation , including [ORG Minister of Justice  ] [PER Tarso Genro  ] ) its 2007-2008 annual report , a new anti-piracy branding campaign called [MISC Brasil Original  ] ( the " [MISC Brasil Original  ] " logo will be used on tags to identify legitimate products ) , and a new action plan to combat piracy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On August 18 , [ORG CNCP  ] presented further details on the progress of the new action plan and priority projects for this year . 
The event , hosted at [ORG MRE  ] and attended by representatives from approximately fifteen countries , was the inauguration of Post 's effort to bring together the diplomatic community in [LOC Brazil  ] in support of [MISC IP  ] protection. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG CNCP  ] 's 2009 priority projects ( each assigned to a [ORG CNCP  ] member organization for coordination ) are: - " Cities Free of Piracy " and " [ORG Legal Markets  ] " : The [MISC Brazilian  ] Institute for [ORG Ethical Competition  ] ( [ORG ETCO  ] ) is coordinating these two projects . 
[ORG ETCO  ] President [PER Andre Franco Montoro Filho  ] explained that in five " pilot cities " ( [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Curitiba  ] , [LOC Riberao Preto  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ) , the [ORG CNCP  ] is working to sign agreements defining obligations , implement a package of action ( including following up on existing local initiatives ) , and create a network of local stakeholders . 
In three of the cities , they have already identified the local lead and started the process of evaluating initiatives and building a municipal network . 
The [ORG CNCP  ] hopes to conclude agreements for all five cities by September and to have measurable progress by December 3 , when [LOC Brazil  ] observes a [ORG National Anti-Piracy Day.  ] - " Merchants Against Piracy " : The [ORG National Commercial Council  ] ( [ORG CNC  ] ) , an association of labor federations and unions , is leading the effort to raise awareness among merchants and vendors of the negative effects of piracy , first in the " pilot cities " of [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Curitiba  ] , [LOC Salvador  ] , and [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
[ORG CNC  ] is working with the [ORG Association of Brazilian Shopping Centers  ] to capitalize on the visibility and opinion-shaping power of well-known shopping centers and shop owners . 
The " [MISC Brasil Original  ] " logo is part of this project 's broader effort to convey to consumers an image of legality . 
[ORG CNCP  ] hopes the " [MISC Brasil Original  ] " tags and promotional materials will be in use in shops by December , 2009. - " Anti-Piracy Website " : The [MISC Brazilian  ] Association of [ORG Software Businesses  ] ( ABES ) is leading the project to develop an interactive , consumer-focused website featuring anti-piracy education campaigns and information . 
It is hoped that the site will allow both common users and rights-holders to post and share files ( text and audio/video ) . 
ABES noted that the challenge will be to keep the content fresh and attractive to users . 
[ORG CNCP  ] hopes to launch the site before December 3 , 2009. - " Partnership with [ORG Internet Providers  ] " : The [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] ( [ORG MOC  ] ) is coordinating this effort to create mechanisms with internet providers that can prevent the online distribution of pirated products . 
In November of 2008 , [ORG MOC  ] formed a working group with representatives from internet infrastructure and access provider companies , with the goal of discussing ways to increase the availability of legal content and analyze models for confronting the distribution of illegal content . 
The working group decided to examine ( with respect to the [MISC Brazilian  ] legal system ) the [MISC British  ] model for notifying violators by e-mail , then registered letter , and diminishing the internet speed available to the user as a deterrent when necessary . 
Until February 2009 , [PER de Souza  ] said , the response from access providers was positive . 
At that time , the access providers expressed reluctance to conduct the agreed-upon analysis , so the working group decided the analysis should be conducted by three federal agencies - the [ORG MOC  ] 's judicial consultant branch , the Attorney General 's [ORG Federal Public Ministry  ] , and the [ORG Department of Consumer Protection  ] . 
The analyses began to come in this month , and the [ORG MOC  ] plans a new meeting of the working group in the near future to discuss the results. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [ORG MRE  ] CONFERENCE SOME QUESTION [MISC IP  ] ROLE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) While the [ORG GOB  ] has demonstrated a strong commitment to fighting piracy and counterfeiting , there is not agreement across the board on the overall value of intellectual property rights in economic development . 
A late-April conference organized by [ORG MRE  ] 's [ORG Intellectual Property Division  ] ( [ORG DIPI  ] ) in conjunction with the [ORG World Intellectual Property Organization  ] ( [ORG WIPO  ] ) , the [MISC Brazilian  ] patent and trademark office ( [ORG INPI  ] ) , and the [MISC Alexandre  ] de [ORG Gusmao Foundation  ] primarily discussed [MISC IP  ] protection ( particularly the patent system ) not as an end in itself , but rather as one possible tool for achieving the ultimate end of industrial and economic development . 
To an audience of mostly students and executive-branch government representatives , a few speakers ( including the President of [ORG INPI  ] , a representative from the [ORG GOB Secretariat for Economic Law  ] , a patent attorney from the [ORG U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  ] , the President of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Intellectual Property Association  ] , and representatives of two [MISC Brazilian  ] pharmaceutical manufacturers associations ) argued for the importance of [MISC IP  ] protection to innovation , but the majority ( including a former president of [ORG INPI  ] , the [MISC IP  ] Coordinator for the [ORG GOB National Health Vigilance Agency  ] ( [ORG ANVISA  ] ) , three federal judges , a member of the federal [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] representative to the [MISC Latin American Integration Association  ] ( [ORG ALADI  ] ) , several academics , and a representative from the [ORG Ministry of Health 's HIV  ] program ) ) highlighted a need to " balance " [MISC IP  ] rights with the public good and concluded that [MISC IP  ] protection does not necessarily create innovation or increase economic development. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Solange Machado  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] [MISC IP  ] consultant for the [ORG U.S. Chamber of Commerce  ] , and [PER Jorge Raimundo  ] , representative of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Research-Based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association  ] ( [ORG Interfarma  ] ) , expressed disappointment at the repeated argument that [MISC IP  ] protection does not increase innovation . 
On a related note , [PER Machado  ] explained that the [ORG U.S. Chamber  ] conducted a survey in conjunction with the [ORG Federation of Industry  ] of the State of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) which revealed that 94% of [MISC Brazilian  ] federal legislators describe their knowledge of [MISC IP  ] as limited , little , or none . 
The [ORG Chamber  ] has , therefore , started a campaign in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] to raise awareness and knowledge of [MISC IP  ] issues. ---------------------------------------- COMMENT -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Post  ] has proposed to interested members of the diplomatic community in [LOC Brasilia  ] that the [ORG CNCP  ] presentation be the start of an ongoing , informal collaboration on [MISC IP  ] . 
Building on [ORG MRE  ] 's positive response to the [ORG Mission  ] 's request for a [ORG CNCP  ] presentation to the diplomatic community , [ORG Post  ] plans to schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss possible ways the diplomatic community can support the [ORG CNCP  ] 's efforts . 
[ORG Post  ] hopes that this positive start to collaboration among various like-minded missions and the [ORG GOB  ] will lead to discussion on [MISC IP  ] issues beyond piracy . 
However , [ORG Post  ] continues to observe a disconnect in the [ORG GOB  ] 's treatment of intellectual property: a multi-faceted , domestically-driven approach to enforcement against piracy and counterfeiting ( led by [ORG MOJ  ] 's [ORG CNCP  ] ) contrasted against resistance to some existing aspects of , as well as any enhancements to , the broader international [MISC IP  ] system among some in [ORG MRE  ] ( as well as [ORG MOH  ] , as reported previously ) . 
This resistance seems to be motivated by [ORG MRE  ] 's political desire for [LOC Brazil  ] to take a leading role among developing nations and a policy belief ( led by [ORG MOH  ] ) that pharmaceutical patents contradict the public interest by limiting access to medications . 
While innovation has occasionally served as a hook for positive discussion , some at [ORG MRE  ] seem intent on delinking conversations on innovation , economic development , and [MISC IP  ] protection . 
Support for [MISC IPR  ] as an engine for innovation and economic development varies across Ministries , with stronger support , for example , within the [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) , the [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] ( [ORG MCT  ] ) , and the [ORG Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development  ] ( [ORG ABDI  ] ) . 
[ORG Post  ] will report septel on innovation views in other ministries .
