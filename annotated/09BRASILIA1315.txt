[PER Lisa Kubiske  ] . 
Reason: 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
In a November 9 meeting , Charge [PER Kubiske  ] and Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Nelson Jobim  ] discussed next steps in the [MISC United States-Brazil  ] bilateral security relationship , the potential sale of [MISC U.S.-origin  ] fighter aircraft and regional security . 
[PER Jobim  ] showed strong interest in furthering security cooperation by signing the [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] as soon as possible and completing an information security agreement . 
[PER Jobim  ] told Charge that there would not be any decision on fighters until sometime after his return from international travel on November 23 and said that capability , technology transfer , benefit to [LOC Brazil  ] 's industrial capacity and price would be the criteria for decision . 
He offered no signs of encouragement that the [LOC U.S.  ] bid would be chosen. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Speaking of regional security issues , [PER Jobim  ] all but acknowledged presence of the [ORG FARC  ] in [LOC Venezuela  ] , offered a suggestion for building [MISC Colombia-Ecuador  ] confidence along their border , and a possible border-monitoring arrangement for combating the drug flow between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] indicated concern about the contents of an [ORG USAF  ] budget document which linked [LOC U.S.  ] military access to bases in [LOC Colombia  ] with " unfriendly governments " as evidence of a lack of understanding of [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He believed that recent inflammatory statements from Presidents [PER Uribe  ] and [PER Chavez  ] are aimed at domestic constituencies on the eve of upcoming elections , and called a potential [PER Uribe  ] run for a third term a terrible precedent for [MISC Bolivarian  ] governments in the region . 
[ORG Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] 's public offer , only two days later , to monitor border activities as a way to reduce tensions between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] shows [PER Jobim  ] 's influence . 
Despite the [ORG GOB  ] 's tendency to blame [LOC Colombia  ] for current tensions , its efforts to maintain peace are sincere and should be encouraged . 
END SUMMARY . 
Structuring the [ORG U.S.-Brazil Security Relationship  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] expressed support for moving forward with [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] security cooperation , first by signing the [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) , then moving on to other arrangements , including a information security agreement ( [ORG GSOMIA  ] ) . 
[PER Jobim  ] said he would see [ORG SecDef Gates  ] at the [ORG International Security Forum  ] , November 20 in [LOC Halifax  ] and could sign the [ORG DCA  ] there , if it were ready . 
If not , [PER Jobim  ] would like to sign before the December 10-11 Bilateral Working Group . 
[PER Jobim  ] also favored moving forward with an information security agreement , saying he would be discussing the issue with the [ORG Ministry for External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) . 
( [PER Note: Polmiloff  ] discussed the information sharing agreement with [ORG MRE  ] pol-mil advisor [PER Marcos Pinta Gama  ] last week . 
[PER Pinta Gama  ] was interested in moving forward as well and planned to consult with the MOD . 
End note . 
) [MISC FX-2 Fighter Competition  ] ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Asked about the [MISC Fx-2  ] competition , Minister [PER Jobim  ] repeated previous statements that the FX2 fighter competition would be based on capability , technology transfer , benefit to [LOC Brazil  ] 's industrial capacity and price . 
Technology transfer will be evaluated in terms of how it will contribute to [LOC Brazil  ] 's future industrial capacity . 
The Charge reiterated and deepened advocacy points in each of these areas , calling a decision to select the [LOC U.S.  ] bid an accelerator for an already growing [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] military and commercial relationship . 
[PER Jobim  ] informed the Charge that he and President [PER Lula  ] will review the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] , s technical analysis of the three competing bids after he returns from international travel November 23 . 
[PER Jobim  ] will then make a recommendation to President [PER Lula  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] , in turn , will make a decision and inform the [ORG National Defense Council  ] , for its concurrence . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001315 002 OF 002 The [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] and [LOC Regional Implications  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] said he was aware of the purpose of the [ORG Agreement  ] giving the [LOC United States  ] access to [MISC Colombian  ] bases , but the availability of an [ORG Air Force  ] budget memo over the internet , which cited " unfriendly countries " in the area had complicated matters . 
He said the document showed " a complete lack of understanding " of [LOC Latin America  ] and said he had had to discuss the issue with the President to urge " moderation " from [LOC Lula.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] then went into a lengthy discussion of security in the [MISC Andean  ] region , including [MISC Colombia-Brazil  ] , [LOC Colombia-Venezuela  ] and [MISC Colombia-Ecuador  ] dimensions with [LOC Colombia  ] at the center of the region 's potential instability . 
He noted that both Presidents [PER Uribe  ] and [PER Chavez  ] have been making statements aimed at domestic constituencies that have contributed to tensions between them . 
[PER Jobim  ] also was critical of [PER Uribe  ] seeking a third term , a move which he thought set a bad precedent for the " Bolivarists . 
" [PER Jobim  ] stressed [LOC Brazil  ] 's " moderate approach " and willingness to build confidence , in particular by providing aerial surveillance of border regions and by sponsoring exchanges of information on military movements in border areas . 
Asked about the presence of the [ORG FARC  ] in [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Jobim  ] said that , were he to acknowledge its presence there " it would ruin [LOC Brazil  ] , s ability to mediate . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
Minister [PER Jobim  ] was eager to discuss security agreements and animated about the regional issues , but was clearly not comfortable talking about the [MISC FX-2  ] competition . 
While he has been prominent in the press in recent days saying that " past problems " with [LOC USG  ] " tech transfer " ( in reality export licensing ) cases undermined confidence in [LOC USG  ] assurances about the [ORG Super Hornet  ] sale , he did not raise this concern with Charge and avoided the opportunity to discuss any lingering concerns he might have . 
In discussing the eventual [MISC FX-2  ] decision , he tried to downplay the importance of price but instead highlighted contributions to [MISC Brazilian  ] industrial capacity . 
Given that the [ORG Boeing  ] offer would integrate [MISC Brazilian  ] companies with [ORG Boeing  ] , s global business and thus offers excellent potential for long-term economic gain , this should be good news , and we pointed that out . 
However , President [PER Lula  ] may choose a different means of evaluation . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's 2008 Defense Strategy requires that purchase of foreign made aircraft be made only if such purchase will lead to indigenous production of more advanced aircraft . 
Should the political goal that [LOC Brazil  ] should someday export fighters to its neighbors -- even if market conditions make this possibility remote -- trump [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] analysis of the aircraft and real economic possibilities , [PER Lula  ] and [PER Jobim  ] will most likely favor the [MISC French  ] or [MISC Swedish  ] offers , both of which highlight the possibility of export production. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) COMMENT CONTINUED . 
Within two days of the Charge 's discussion with [PER Jobim  ] , [ORG Presidential Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] went public with [LOC Brazil  ] 's willingness to help ease [LOC Colombia-Venezuela  ] tensions through border monitoring , including aerial surveillance . 
This announcement shows [PER Jobim  ] 's closeness to [PER Lula  ] on security issues and once again highlights [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire to be the continent 's peacemaker . 
Although the [ORG GOB  ] , s continued questioning of the intent of the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] and insistence on painting [PER Uribe  ] as the primary source of [LOC Andean  ] tensions may limit the [ORG GOB  ] , s effectiveness , we believe the [ORG GOB  ] genuinely seeks to reduce tensions , and we should encourage these efforts .
