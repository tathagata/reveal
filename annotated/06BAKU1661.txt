( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] At a November 10 [ORG Azerbaijan International Oil Company  ] briefing , outgoing [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER David Woodward  ] told the Ambassador that according to [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] had not agreed to forego its contracted for 2007 [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas deliveries as a way of helping [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] with their winter gas problems , although they were willing to defer delivery of some amounts if the contracted for price of USD 120 per thousand cubic meters remained the same . 
[PER Woodward  ] said that [LOC Turkey  ] was declaring itself ready to receive [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas , although he himself had doubts . 
He said that a joint [MISC BP-SOCAR  ] working group would start work soon to discuss ways of redressing possible [ORG GOAJ  ] domestic gas shortages in winter 2007 . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On November 10 the Ambassador attended an [ORG Azerbaijan International Oil Company  ] briefing headed by outgoing [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER David Woodward  ] . 
Other attendees were incoming [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] , [ORG BP Group Azerbaijan  ] Director for Communications and [ORG External Affairs  ] [PER Clare Bebbington  ] , [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Laurie Bristow  ] , [LOC UK  ] EconOff , and Econoff as notetaker . 
READ-OUT OF TU-GOAJ MEETING --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Woodward  ] gave a read-out of his November 2 meeting with [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] . 
This meeting , prompted by the visit to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] of [ORG BP Executive Vice-President  ] and Deputy Chief Executive of Exploration and Production [PER Andy Inglis  ] , occurred right after [PER Abdullayev  ] had returned from [LOC Turkey  ] with Deputy Prime Minister [PER Abid Sharifov  ] , where they had notified [LOC Turkey  ] of intended delays in [ORG GOAJ  ] 2007 [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas deliveries . 
[PER Abdullayev  ] , fresh off the plane , provided [PER Woodward  ] and [PER Inglis  ] a read-out of his [LOC Turkey  ] meeting with Energy Minister [PER Gular  ] and [ORG Botas  ] . 
[PER Rovnaq  ] told them that [ORG Botas  ] would not sign the document he had brought , in which [LOC Turkey  ] was asked to agree to [ORG GOAJ  ] providing no [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas in 2007 and in which the [ORG GOAJ  ] sought to re-open [ORG Shah Deniz  ] price negotiations . 
[LOC Turkey  ] insisted on receiving its contracted for 2007 three billion cubic meters ( bcm ) of [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas at the agreed upon price of USD 120 per thousand cubic meter ( tcm ) , but said it did not have to receive it all in 2007 . 
It proposed that it could take half ( 1.5 bcm ) in winter 2007 , with the rest to be received in 2008 or 2009 , at the contracted price of USD 120/tcm . 
[PER Abdullayev  ] told [PER Inglis  ] that he had gotten [LOC Turkey  ] to agree that it would be a transit country for [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas ( vice a buyer-seller ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During this November 2 meeting with [PER Abdullayev  ] and [PER Sharifov  ] , Energy Minister [PER Gular  ] also said that [LOC Turkey  ] was ready to receive [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas . 
In this regard , [PER Woodward  ] said that he thinks that [ORG Botas  ] will ask for commissioning gas during the week of November 13-17 . 
As to how ready [LOC Turkey  ] actually is to receive [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas , [PER Woodward  ] said that the [ORG BP  ] opinion is that [ORG Botas  ] still has a lot of work to do to complete the pipeline to include work on the valve stations , and that if the work were done in accordance with international standards then the pipeline might not be ready until spring 2007 . 
However , he added that “it was not inconceivable” that [ORG Botas  ] could “rush finish” the job so that it would be ready to receive gas shortly , although the pipeline would not meet international standards . 
ACG PROBLEM RESOLUTION ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Woodward  ] said that during the recent visit of [ORG BP Executive Inglis  ] , [ORG BP  ] had given both President [PER Aliyev  ] and [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Abdullayev  ] a copy of a [ORG BP  ] ‘white paper’ on the way forward for [LOC Azerbaijan  ] in the energy sector , ( a copy of which he gave to the Ambassador ) , with the focus on four main themes: - ACG Maximum Development: Resolving current issues associated with [MISC ACG  ] to maximize recovery - Short/medium/long term gas issues: Short-term - how to address this winter’s gas needs ; Medium/Long-term: how best [LOC BAKU  ] 00001661 002 OF 003 to identify and exploit [ORG GOAJ  ] gas reserves - SOCAR: how to help make [ORG SOCAR  ] an energy company that meets international standards - [ORG BP Social  ] Programs: putting a ‘harder edge’ on them , to help build capacity in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Woodward  ] said that there were a series of outstanding ACG-related issues the resolution of which involved billions of dollars and which the [ORG AIOC  ] partners were trying to resolve with [ORG SOCAR  ] in a package , vice individually . 
In the November 2 meeting between [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] and [ORG BP  ] executive [PER Inglis  ] , [PER Abdullayev  ] said that he would head the [ORG SOCAR  ] [MISC ACG  ] steering group dealing with these problems , and that [ORG SOCAR  ] VP [PER Elshad Nassirov  ] would be the [ORG SOCAR  ] working level representative . 
[PER Abdullayev  ] also said he would head the [ORG SOCAR  ] team on the [MISC BP-SOCAR  ] gas working group , with [PER Nassirov  ] again the working-level representative . 
[PER Woodward  ] said that [PER Abdullayev  ] had an unrealistic expectation of how quickly these outstanding [MISC ACG  ] issues could be resolved: whereas [ORG BP  ] thinks that a framework within which to discuss the issues could be agreed upon by January , with actual negotiations over these issues lasting up to six months , [PER Woodward  ] said that [PER Abdullayev  ] told [PER Inglis  ] that the issues could be solved ‘within a few days.’ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Woodward  ] said that [PER Abdullayev  ] did not show much willingness to engage with [ORG BP  ] re Azerbaijan’s short-term ( Winter 07 ) gas problems , contending that [ORG AIOC  ] giving [ORG SOCAR  ] more associated [MISC ACG  ] gas could solve the problem . 
( Note: [ORG AIOC  ] is scheduled to give 1.4 bcm of associated [MISC ACG  ] gas to [ORG SOCAR  ] in 2007 ; [ORG SOCAR  ] is arguing that [ORG AIOC  ] does not need to re-inject any [MISC ACG  ] associated gas back into the well , and wants 3 bcm ) . 
[PER Woodward  ] said that all sides seemed to be waiting for the results of the President [PER Aliyev-President Putin  ] meeting in [LOC Moscow  ] , although he himself doubted whether the two would reach any definitive agreement , as everyone is waiting to see the results of the various [ORG CIS  ] bilateral [ORG Gazprom  ] negotiations , to see if the USD 230/tcm level will hold . 
[ORG BP  ] [LOC GEORGIA  ] GAS READOUT ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Woodward  ] said he and his replacement [PER Bill Schrader  ] had just returned from [LOC Georgia  ] , where they had met separately with the [MISC Georgian  ] Energy Minister , Environment Minister and Prime Minister , among others . 
At these meetings the [MISC Georgian  ] proposal of a November three-way gas-focused [MISC Turkish-Azerbaijani-Georgian  ] ministerial-level meeting in [LOC Tblisi  ] or [LOC Ankara  ] was discussed , although nothing definite had been agreed to by all parties . 
In their meetings , the [ORG GOG  ] interlocutors had referred to Turkey’s Summer 2007 ‘agreement in principle’ to supply [LOC Georgia  ] from its own [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas , although [PER Woodward  ] said in his opinion all [LOC Turkey  ] had agreed to at that time was a ‘bring us a proposal and we’ll have a look at it’ type agreement . 
[PER Woodward  ] said that the [ORG GOG  ] Energy Minister had told him that [LOC GA  ] would not buy gas from [ORG Gazprom  ] at USD 230/tcm , and that [LOC Turkey  ] would supply [ORG GOG  ] with 1.5 bcm in 2007 . 
[PER Woodward  ] said the [ORG GOG  ] PM was more realistic , saying that perhaps [LOC Georgia  ] could get 0.8 to 1.2 bcm from [LOC Turkey  ] in 2007 . 
[PER Woodward  ] said the [ORG GOG  ] PM seemed more relaxed about the upcoming winter gas situation than did the Energy Minister , and more concerned about [ORG Shah Deniz Stage Two-related  ] issues , stating that , inter alia , [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] should look at gas storage issues together , vice separately . 
[PER Woodward  ] said he got the impression that [ORG GOG  ] was more concerned about the economics of gas purchases from [ORG Gazprom  ] than the supply itself , and he noted that despite the intense rhetoric flowing between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] , the energy continues to flow . 
[ORG SD PRODUCTION  ] ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Woodward  ] agreed that [ORG Shah Deniz  ] was experiencing production delays , but said that other issues would play a more determinative role in deciding where [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas went , such as the [ORG GOG  ] technical capacity to uptake [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas at its border with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
He said that the Gas Pressure Reduction and [ORG Metering Station  ] at [ORG Pump Station  ] One in [LOC Georgia  ] has a maximum daily design throughput of 4.0 million cubic meters , equivalent to 1.46 bcm/a at one hundred percent load ( note: this compares to currently contracted [LOC BAKU  ] 00001661 003 OF 003 quantities which build up to around 08. bcm/a by 2011 ) . 
As such , he said that part of the work of the [ORG SOCAR-BP  ] gas working group that would be meeting imminently would be to model how much gas [LOC Georgia  ] could uptake from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] from a technical viewpoint . 
He noted that in addition to the [ORG SCP  ] ( i.e . 
[ORG Shah Deniz  ] ) pipeline , there was also the possibility of transferring gas from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to [LOC Georgia  ] through the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] gas system . 
As for [ORG Shah Deniz  ] gas itself , [PER Woodward  ] said that as soon as the first two of the four wells start flowing ( mid-November and late December respectively ) , will it be clear how quickly and how much production will be available for winter 2007. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT:  ] Before determining what steps to take to redress any possible winter 07 gas shortages in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] first needs to assess its current gas balance and possible alternative supply options . 
In this regard it is encouraging to hear that the joint [MISC BP-SOCAR  ] gas working group is scheduled to meet the week of November 12 . 
[PER Woodward  ] however was disparaging of the selection of [ORG SOCAR  ] President [PER Rovnaq Abdullayev  ] and Deputy Prime Minister [PER Sharifov  ] as the [ORG GOAJ  ] officials sent to [LOC Ankara  ] to deal with the [MISC Turkish  ] government ( indeed , a [ORG Statoil  ] representative told the Ambassador that [PER Abdullayev  ] had taken the wrong version of the [ORG Shah Deniz  ] contract to the discussions ) , and despaired of any solution to the short-term regional problem occurring if management of the issue stayed at the [ORG SOCAR  ] level . 
As such , he requested [ORG USG  ] help in convincing [LOC Turkey  ] to meet with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Now that [LOC Turkey  ] is doing so ( see reftel ) , Embassy will seek to ensure that the [ORG GOAJ  ] participates at the appropriate level .
