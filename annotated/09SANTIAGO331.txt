( U ) Participants: [ORG U.S.  ] [PER Joseph Biden  ] , Vice President [PER Antony Blinken  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] to the Vice President [PER Brian McKeon  ] , Deputy [ORG National Security Advisor  ] to the Vice President [PER Dan Restrepo  ] , Senior Director , [ORG Western Hemisphere Affairs  ] , [ORG National Security Council  ] [PER Craig Kelly  ] , Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of [LOC State  ] for [ORG Western Hemisphere Affairs  ] , [ORG U.S. Dept. of State  ] [PER Brian Harris  ] ( notetaker ) , Political/Economic Chief , [ORG U.S. Embassy Guatemala City  ] SPAIN [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] , Prime Minister [PER Bernadino Leon  ] , Secretary General of the [ORG Presidency  ] [PER Nieves Goicoechea  ] , Deputy Secretary of State for Communications [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] , Deputy Secretary of [LOC State  ] for [MISC Latin America  ] [PER Maria Solanes  ] , Presidential Counselor for [ORG International Affairs  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a bilateral meeting on the margins of the [ORG Progressive Governance Leaders Summit  ] in [LOC Chile  ] , Vice President [PER Joseph Biden  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] Prime Minister [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] discussed the need for a strengthened relationship and greater collaboration between [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC United States  ] .

He also criticized the lack of consultation prior to [LOC Spain  ] 's withdrawal from [LOC Kosovo  ] and requested [LOC Spain  ] consult the [LOC United States  ] earlier and in a more transparent fashion in the future .

End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ------- Expectations and New [ORG U.S. Approach to Foreign Policy  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PM [PER Zapatero  ] opened the meeting by congratulating Vice President [PER Biden  ] on the election victory and saying it had raised expectations in [LOC Spain  ] and throughout [LOC Europe  ] for a new relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Vice President [PER Biden  ] thanked [PER Zapatero  ] and added that expectations may be too high , and President [PER Obama  ] knows that high expectations have more to do with the failures of the previous administration than with his new administration. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] added that we want to change our foreign policy paradigm . 
We know that most of our challenges lie beyond the scope of the [LOC United States  ] to confront alone and that President [PER Obama  ] genuinely wants engage in dialogue with partners around the world to develop consensus around solutions . 
We know what the pillars of our policy are , but unless we listen and work with our partners , it will not matter much. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] went on to say that [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC United States  ] have worked as great partners in [LOC Iraq  ] and we need to enhance the cooperation between our two countries . 
The relationship has not been all positive in recent years but there was no reason why it could not change instantly. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] responded that managing the relationship between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Spain  ] under the [ORG Bush  ] administration was easy for him . 
Whatever position the [ORG Bush Administration  ] took , he would take the opposite and see his domestic poll numbers increase . 
Sarcastically , [PER Zapatero  ] said " for that I will always be grateful to the [ORG Bush Administration  ] . 
" Now , however , [LOC Spain  ] , and [LOC Europe  ] in general , want a change in the relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC Europe  ] is a group of countries that the [LOC United States  ] can trust . 
We share the same general outlook and , to a great extent , the same strategic interests . 
[LOC Europe  ] wants to see a [LOC United States  ] that shares decision making on global issues and listens to everyone , rather than pushing a single dogmatic view as with the [ORG Bush  ] administration . 
[LOC Europe  ] is the world 's greatest debating club which--despite numerous cultures , 27 countries , and 20 languages--can still reach consensus . 
Were [MISC Europeans  ] to be a little bolder , they would have a great impact on world affairs . 
Now [MISC Europeans  ] want to contribute to reinvigorated [LOC U.S.  ] leadership by helping to contribute the best ideas and principles to help solve global challenges. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] said that for eight years the doctrine of " my way or the high way " had been ascendant in [MISC American  ] foreign policy and that he had long spoken against this in the [ORG Senate  ] . 
In his recent speeches at the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] and at the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] he had been a consistent proponent of collaboration and consensus building . 
However , consensus building can have the drawback of leading to the lowest common denominator . 
Working together , [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC United States  ] must reach agreement , then implement plans and enforce the rules of the road . 
Despite being an ardent Atlanticist , Vice President [PER Biden  ] noted that [LOC Europe  ] has been reluctant to act to enforce the rules to which [MISC Europeans  ] have ascribed . 
The [PER Obama  ] administration brings good news and bad news for [MISC Europeans  ] . 
Unlike the [ORG Bush  ] administration , the [PER Obama  ] administration will genuinely consult and listen to its [MISC European  ] partners . 
However , once a decision is reached , the [PER Obama  ] administration will be more aggressive in asking [MISC Europeans  ] to follow through on its commitments. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] said regular [MISC Americans  ] in places like [LOC Peoria  ] and [LOC Albuquerque  ] do not like being a superpower , they want others , such as [LOC Europe  ] to help lead . 
When the idea of a [MISC European  ] military force separate from the [ORG NATO  ] command structure emerged , many in the [ORG Bush  ] administration railed against it . 
However , Vice President [PER Biden  ] said he had been supportive of the idea and did not view it as a threat . 
In a light moment , when [PER Zapatero  ] said that the [ORG European Defense Force  ] would happen , Vice President [PER Biden  ] extended his hand and said " I bet it won't . 
" Vice President [PER Biden  ] said we view the [MISC U.S.-European  ] relationship as an axis of world stability and we need to work together to strengthen it. ------ [LOC Kosovo  ] ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] said that we want to genuinely collaborate with [LOC Spain  ] , but changing a relationship was difficult , and required reciprocal changes . 
For example , when [LOC Spain  ] unilaterally withdrew its mission to [LOC Kosovo  ] , we would have appreciated advanced warning and collaboration . 
The decision is a sovereign one for [LOC Spain  ] to make and one that the [LOC United States  ] respects , but we should discuss it in advance. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] responded that there must have been a misunderstanding . 
[LOC Spain  ] made the decision to withdraw a year ago and could not maintain participation in the mission once [LOC Kosovo  ] declared its independence and was recognized by numerous nations . 
[LOC Spain  ] is a fractious country with [MISC Basque  ] ( [ORG ETA  ] ) terrorist organization that has killed over 900 [MISC Spaniards  ] in an effort to split from [LOC Spain  ] . 
Any hint that the [MISC Spanish  ] government would support the dissolution of a country into regional components would be sensitive politically and could embolden separatists . 
Therefore , [LOC Spain  ] could not continue to support a mission to [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
However , [PER Zapatero  ] allowed , [LOC Spain  ] could have conducted more comprehensive consultations with the [LOC United States  ] ahead of its withdrawal. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) The [ORG Office of the Vice  ] President has cleared this message .
