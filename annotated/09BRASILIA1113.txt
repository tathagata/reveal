( C ) Summary: In an August 4-5 visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] dominated by [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns over [ORG USG  ] intentions and the regional implications of expanded [LOC U.S.  ] access to [MISC Colombian  ] military bases , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] General [PER James L. Jones  ] assured senior [ORG GOB  ] officials that President [PER Obama  ] desires a transparent relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] and wants to expand our bilateral cooperation . 
The [ORG GOB  ] encouraged greater [LOC U.S.  ] dialogue and engagement with [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , and [LOC Cuba  ] , and more forceful [LOC U.S.  ] action against the de facto government in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
In discussions concerning the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , [LOC Iran  ] , and non-proliferation , General [PER Jones  ] made clear to [MISC Brazilian  ] officials that [LOC Brazil  ] , s growing international role implied taking greater responsibility . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials described a [LOC Brazil  ] that is seeking ways to expand its global economic reach: ready to become an [ORG IMF  ] creditor , to finalize a global trade agreement , to engage in bilateral and regional cooperation on energy , and to tackle the difficult issues surrounding climate change . 
Although the [LOC Colombia  ] bases issue caused longstanding regional security concerns to resurface , [ORG GOB  ] officials were complimentary of the new Administration , s initial approach to [LOC Latin America  ] and expressed interest in looking for new ways to cooperate .

( SBU ) General [PER Jones  ] , joined by [ORG State U/S for Arms Control and International Security  ] [PER Ellen Tauscher  ] , [ORG Defense U/S for Acquisitions , Technology and Logistics  ] [PER Ashton Carter  ] , and [ORG NSC  ] Director for [LOC South America  ] [PER Luis Rosello  ] , met with Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] , Presidential Foreign Policy [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , [ORG Defense Minister  ] [PER Nelson Jobim  ] , Casa Civil Minister ( Chief of Staff ) [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , Mines and Energy Minister [PER Edison Lobao  ] , [ORG Petrobras  ] CEO [PER Sergio Gabrielli  ] , [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] , and a number of other [ORG MRE  ] , [ORG Defense  ] , Energy , and Presidency officials , as well as senior opposition and business figures . 
Ref B addressed energy issues discussed during the visit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [PER Amorim  ] , [PER Garcia  ] , [PER Rousseff  ] , and [PER Jobim  ] meetings all included lengthy discussions of the [LOC Colombia  ] bases issue . 
[PER Amorim  ] ran through a series of questions that the news of the bases had raised , recalling alleged statements in the past by ( unnamed ) [LOC U.S.  ] military officers suggesting that the Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay tri-border area might be a " legitimate [LOC U.S.  ] target " if terrorist activity were discovered there , and that " [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congressional  ] reports " accusing [LOC Venezuela  ] of supporting drug trafficking ( a reference to a recent [ORG GAO  ] report ) , combined with the stated counternarcotics mission of the bases , raised concern that they might be used to launch actions against [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] said that what for the [LOC United States  ] was " business as usual " was exacerbating tensions in a sensitive ( and in [PER Chavez  ] 's case , hypersensitive ) region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said he appreciated the frankness of the dialogue and expected that we would overcome the current " malaise . 
" He noted that President [PER Lula  ] would meet [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] later that week , and that [PER Garcia  ] had spoken with [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] about the issue ; in his view , [PER Chavez  ] did not see it as a big problem , but the issue " smelled of [MISC Cold War  ] " and was surprising to the [ORG GOB  ] after the " very positive " overtures by the Administration and considering that , in his view , the [ORG FARC  ] had never been so weak and the only security threat to the [LOC United States  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] comes from [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] dismissed the discovery in [ORG FARC  ] hands of [MISC Swedish  ] anti-tank weapons that had been sold to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government as overblown noting that the weapons were old and that , in any case , they would be of limited value since " there are no tanks in insurgency conflicts . 
" [PER Garcia  ] added that he did not believe the [ORG GOV  ] was supporting the [ORG FARC  ] because " the [ORG FARC  ] is involved in drug trafficking , and everyone knows that involvement with the drug trade is destructive . 
" He noted that the current crisis is the continuation of a longstanding love-hate relationship between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , and that this was the third [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001113 002.2 OF 004 [MISC Colombia-Venezuela  ] crisis that he had had to deal with . 
[PER Garcia  ] stressed that [LOC Brazil  ] 's overriding interest is in ensuring a peaceful region that can live with the differences among countries , and cited this as the reason [LOC Brazil  ] supports the [MISC Colombia-U.S  ] . 
[ORG Free Trade Agreement.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] told [PER Gen. Jones  ] that the [ORG GOB  ] finds it disconcerting to be faced with questions from the press regarding why the [LOC United States  ] needs such bases . 
According to [PER Rousseff  ] , issues such as this open the door for radicals who want to create problems in the region . 
[PER Gen. Jones  ] emphasized [LOC Colombia  ] 's need for assistance in maintaining its security against drug traffickers and the [ORG FARC  ] , and then recounted [PER Uribe  ] 's concerns that his fight against the [ORG FARC  ] was made more difficult because of [ORG FARC  ] positions in other countries . 
In all three meetings , [PER Gen. Jones  ] explained the nature of the agreement as largely formalizing the current relationship . 
He said he was willing to send a team of [ORG USG  ] civilian and military officials to provide additional information , but stressed that it was unfortunate that others were playing up this issue in the press since [ORG USG  ] officials including himself were available to talk whenever [ORG GOB  ] officials had concerns about [ORG USG  ] actions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] told [PER Gen. Jones  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] has great expectations of the [ORG Obama Administration  ] , noting that transparency was a very important component of the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship with [LOC South America  ] . 
He noted that issues like the [LOC Colombia  ] bases become more difficult when the [ORG GOB  ] learns of them through the press , but added that [LOC Brazil  ] , too , is often surprised by the sensitivities of " [LOC Spanish America  ] " regarding issues that would be considered innocuous elsewhere . 
[PER Gen. Jones  ] encouraged [PER Jobim  ] to call if there were further doubts about [LOC U.S.  ] intentions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While insisting they did not want to engage in mediation between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOV  ] , both [PER Garcia  ] and [PER Amorim  ] used the opportunity to encourage the [LOC United States  ] to establish " a direct channel of communication with President [PER Chavez  ] . 
" [PER Amorim  ] suggested that a good [MISC USG-GOV  ] dialogue would have an impact on the domestic situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] , as well , because much of the opposition to [PER Chavez  ] has ties to the [LOC United States.  ] - - - Other [MISC Regional Issues  ] on [LOC Brazil  ] , s Mind - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) With regard to [LOC Honduras  ] , [PER Amorim  ] said that [PER Chavez  ] had wanted to make President [PER Zelaya  ] " a martyr , " but the [ORG GOB  ] had convinced him that " only the [LOC United States  ] can influence what happens in [LOC Honduras  ] " and needed to be consulted . 
[PER Amorim  ] said he had declined [ORG OAS  ] SYG [PER Insulza  ] 's request to participate in a foreign ministers' group , saying that the prospects had " slipped " since the [PER Arias  ] initiative had begun . 
He felt that the possibility of the de facto government rejecting yet another initiative made it too risky . 
[PER Amorim  ] described [ORG USG  ] actions against the de facto government as " surface scratches " that were not deep enough to do damage . 
There had been enough concessions to [PER Micheletti  ] , he said . 
The [LOC United States  ] needs to tell him in clear terms that he must allow [PER Zelaya  ] back . 
The situation in [LOC Honduras  ] needs a resolution that is " both quick and peaceful , " [PER Amorim  ] said , although he recognized the difficulty of achieving both . 
For his part , [PER Garcia  ] noted that President [PER Zelaya  ] would be coming to [LOC Brazil  ] shortly , and encouraged the [ORG USG  ] to apply stronger pressure on the de facto government to allow [PER Zelaya  ] to be restored to power quickly*he suggested revoking more visas . 
[PER Garcia  ] stressed that [PER Zelaya  ] " is not a dangerous revolutionary , " that returning him to power to run the elections " will not lead to significant changes , " and that the de facto government cannot be allowed to run elections. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] is seeking to increase its investment in [LOC Bolivia  ] , and particularly to compensate for [LOC Bolivia  ] 's lost [ORG ATPDEA  ] benefits . 
[PER Amorim  ] called removal of [ORG ATPDEA  ] benefits " a mistake . 
" [PER Garcia  ] said that there no longer appeared to be grave problems in [LOC Bolivia  ] , but stressed that it was important for the [ORG USG  ] to build a positive agenda with [LOC Bolivia.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] " embargo " ( sic ) on [MISC Brazilian  ] sales of [MISC Super Tucano  ] aircraft in the region was " very negative " and raised serious questions in [LOC Brazil  ] regarding defense cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
If the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001113 003.2 OF 004 [LOC United States  ] is going to place limits on what [LOC Brazil  ] can do , then partnership " is no good " for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] and [PER Carter  ] explained to [PER Garcia  ] , as well as to [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Rousseff  ] , that the Administration recognized the need to overhaul the procedure for protecting technology . 
[PER Tauscher  ] stressed that there is no embargo and that , going forward , such decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the impact they might have on [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] stressed the importance of regional stability for [LOC Brazil  ] , but cautioned that [LOC Brazil  ] resists being labeled the regional leader because they do not see it as helpful in resolving problems . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's concessions to [LOC Paraguay  ] on the [LOC Itaipu  ] dam were an example of [LOC Brazil  ] putting stability interests over commercial interests , an approach that many in [LOC Brazil  ] criticized. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Discussing [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Garcia  ] and his deputy , Amb . 
[PER Marcel Biato  ] , laid out their view that [PER Raul Castro  ] is more pragmatic and less ideological than [PER Fidel  ] , with a focus on getting short-term economic results . 
They see [LOC Cuba  ] as taking a path similar to that of [LOC Vietnam  ] under [PER Raul  ] , whom they acknowledged was a transitional leader . 
Given that the [LOC United States  ] has a relationship with [LOC Vietnam  ] , [PER Garcia  ] said , there is no reason the [LOC United States  ] can't have a similar relationship with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
In their view , [MISC Brazilian  ] support for [LOC Cuba  ] and efforts to " create a new niche " for [LOC Cuba  ] in the hemisphere open additional space that [PER Raul  ] needs to engage the [LOC United States  ] . 
They noted that their plans to help [LOC Cuba  ] construct a deep-water port at [LOC Mariel  ] only make sense on the assumption that [LOC Cuba  ] and the [LOC United States  ] will eventually develop a trading relationship. - - - [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , Non-Proliferation - - - <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) FM [PER Amorim  ] and MRE Under Secretary for the [ORG Political Affairs II Roberto  ] Jaguaribe told [PER Gen. Jones  ] that they had heard from the [MISC Palestinians  ] how pleased they were with his appointment and listened keenly to his assessment of the situation following his trip to the region the previous week . 
Jaguaribe said it is the [ORG GOB  ] 's view that the [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] conflict is the key to resolving most questions in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He stressed that [LOC Brazil  ] was pleased with the [LOC Annapolis  ] process , but acknowledged that neither [LOC Israel  ] nor the [MISC Arabs  ] seemed to want it to continue . 
Referring to his trip to the [LOC Middle East  ] in 2008 , [PER Amorim  ] highlighted the importance of engaging [LOC Syria  ] in the process. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] praised the " excellent " opening to [LOC Iran  ] made by President Obama-- " If they don't respond , " he asked , " then what do they want ? 
" [PER Amorim  ] described the [MISC Brazil-Iran  ] relationship as " not deep , but pragmatic " and dominated by commercial concerns . 
He said the nature of the relationship should not be " overvalued " -- " we are not buddies " --but that there is a channel between them , and [LOC Brazil  ] was willing to help if it can , although " not just to pressure " [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] CEO [PER Gabrielli  ] told [PER Gen. Jones  ] that [ORG Petrobras  ] is terminating exploratory activity in [LOC Iran  ] , although a small office will be left open . 
[PER Amorim  ] and other officials expressed concern that there might be an effort to prevent [LOC Iran  ] from pursuing enrichment even for peaceful purposes , and [PER Amorim  ] said , in particular , that the " zero-for-zero " approach " did not sound right . 
" [PER Gen. Jones  ] told both [PER Garcia  ] and [PER Amorim  ] that we would be pleased to share our views on [LOC Iran  ] as the process moves forward. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) All [ORG GOB  ] interlocutors stressed the importance of the President 's initiative on disarmament , which [PER Amorim  ] characterized as " the best argument for non-proliferation . 
" [PER U/S Tauscher  ] noted the importance of [LOC Brazil  ] in the 2010 review conference on the NPT and asked for [LOC Brazil  ] 's assistance in making it productive .

) - - - Prospects for [ORG Defense Partnership  ] - - - <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] highlighted the fact that [LOC Brazil  ] 's new [ORG National Defense Strategy  ] was crafted to ensure the defense sector would be an " enabler of development . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] is no longer an " off the shelf " buyer of defense equipment . 
Rather , it wants to be a partner in joint ventures with countries that want to sell equipment . 
[PER Jobim  ] said that , as a [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001113 004.2 OF 004 lawyer and judge , he is inclined to look at precedents when considering the possibilities for technology transfer . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] precedents " are not very encouraging . 
" [PER Tauscher  ] and [PER Carter  ] acknowledged the complexity and history attached to the relationship , suggesting we focus on the way forward: a relationship of full partnership that allows both parties to prosper .

( C ) Former [MISC Brazilian  ] ambassador to [LOC London  ] and [LOC Paris  ] and communications minister [PER Sergio Amaral  ] and former agricultural minister [PER Roberto Rodrigues  ] criticized [ORG GOB  ] foreign policy for being too ideological . 
Arguing that foreign policy had become politicized under [PER Lula  ] to compensate for his orthodox economic policies , [PER Amaral  ] described it as too lenient with [MISC South American  ] neighbors , favoring leftist governments in the region rather than remaining in a position to resolve disputes , and focused too heavily on [MISC South-South  ] relations and too little on relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Rodrigues  ] criticized [LOC Brazil  ] 's rejection of the [ORG Free Trade Area  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG FTAA  ] ) , saying it had hurt the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy. - - - Trade and Finance - - - <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Noting the excellent relations President [PER Lula  ] had with President [PER Bush  ] , [PER Garcia  ] stressed the " enormous expectations " that [LOC Brazil  ] has for President [PER Obama  ] , adding that he saw " extraordinary possibilities " for the [LOC United States  ] coming out of the current economic crisis. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] commented that countries had gone a long way toward concluding the [LOC Doha  ] trade round , but criticized the current [LOC U.S.  ] position , saying it seemed to be identical to that of the last [ORG Administration  ] . 
[PER Gen. Jones  ] stressed that the [LOC United States  ] wants to see a " balanced and ambitious " [LOC Doha  ] agreement , and [PER U/S Tauscher  ] noted the difficulty the President faced in recasting the trade agenda to the [MISC American  ] people in the midst of a recession . 
[PER Amorim  ] said he believed the last [ORG Administration  ] had " lost sight of the big picture , " and encouraged greater political-level involvement from the [ORG USG  ] , saying that " trade negotiations cannot be left to the trade negotiators . 
" <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] told [PER Gen. Jones  ] he anticipated the September G20 meeting would focus on regulation of the global financial system , and confirmed that although [LOC Brazil  ] had not yet made its USD 10 billion disbursement to the [ORG IMF  ] , " it will happen . 
" Regarding the global financial crisis , [PER Meirelles  ] credited [LOC Brazil  ] 's relatively strong position in part to strong domestic demand . 
He also pointed to the fiscal austerity law , passed following the financial crisis of the 1990s , which brought down domestic debt and allowed [LOC Brazil  ] to become a net foreign exchange creditor . 
He indicated that the bigger surprise was that [LOC Brazil  ] had been affected as much as it was ; a fact he attributed to [MISC Brazilian  ] reliance on foreign commercial credit for financing . 
This problem however , had been mitigated by the low level of credit in [MISC Brazilian  ] society , previously as low as 22 percent of GDP , now at 43 percent , compared to over 200 percent in the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) In response to a question from Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] regarding the increasing discussion around countries abandoning the dollar in favor of local currencies in bilateral trade transactions , [PER Meirelles  ] commented that " it is happening and is operationally positive . 
" [PER Meirelles  ] noted that , due to the large number of goods traded internationally that are priced in dollars , the volume of goods traded in local currency is never going to be too high .
