( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary .

After reiterating the political sensitivities surrounding the [ORG Sovereign Base Areas  ] ( [ORG SBA  ] ) on [LOC Cyprus  ] and the public and parliamentary pressure on [ORG HMG  ] to maintain sovereign control of its territories ( refs A , C , E , F ) , [PER Leslie  ] noted the [ORG USG  ] use of [LOC Akrotiri  ] had gotten “sloppy.” She reiterated the value [ORG HMG  ] placed on [MISC U.S.-UK  ] cooperation , but noted [ORG HMG  ] was now asking the [ORG USG  ] to comply with the same clearance procedures [ORG HMG  ] itself used for intel flights . 
She made no attempt to hide her annoyance that the [ORG FCO  ] working level had ratcheted up conditions as outlined in ref [PER A. Leslie  ] distinguished between ordinary intel flights and those that were also “operational , ” such as [ORG CEDAR  ] SWEEP , but maintained [ORG HMG  ] insistence that all intel flight clearances must be sought in gov-gov channels , rather than the mil-mil channels used to date . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG FCO  ] Director General for [ORG Defence and Intelligence Mariot  ] [PER Leslie  ] told Acting U/S [PER John Rood  ] May 16 that [MISC U.S.-UK  ] talks on clearances for DOD intel flights had become “unnecessarily confrontational.” She noted that [ORG HMG  ] “desperately needs” the [ORG SBA  ] for its own intelligence gathering and operations and was committed to keeping them available to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( and [LOC France  ] ) . 
However , the [MISC Cypriots  ] are hypersensitive about the [MISC British  ] presence there and , she said , could “turn off the utilities at any time.” That , combined with the “toxic mix” of the rendition flights through [PER Diego Garcia  ] , has resulted in tremendous parliamentary , public , and media pressure on [ORG HMG  ] to maintain sovereign control of its territories , especially [LOC Akrotiri  ] . 
[PER Leslie  ] noted that on a couple occasions recently the required process had not been followed , a process [ORG HMG  ] requires of its own intel flights . 
She explained that because [ORG CEDAR  ] SWEEP was an operational flight , as well as intel-related , “all sorts of additional [LOC UK  ] legal obligations come into play , ” including the [ORG EU Convention  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] . 
[LOC UK  ] law mandates a “dual-key” approach for approving intel flights , requiring both [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG FCO  ] assent to ensure nothing unlawful is approved. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] expressed annoyance at the additional conditions conveyed by the [ORG FCO  ] working level on May 14 ( Ref A ) , noting she had not been aware beforehand that such a message would be conveyed . 
In fact , she regretted the tenor of the discussions had turned prickly and underscored [ORG HMG  ] appreciation for [MISC U.S.-UK  ] military and intelligence cooperation . 
To set the record straight , she clarified that the follow-on letter from [ORG MOD  ] , dated May 9 ( emailed to PMAT Action Team May 19 ) , was merely meant to lay out that the [ORG HMG  ] approval for [ORG CEDAR  ] SWEEP was based on the [LOC U.S.  ] assurance that the operation had been requested by the Government of [LOC Lebanon  ] and was being conducted in a permissive environment . 
The letter was not/not intended to question whether the [LOC U.S.  ] had obtained full GOL ( vice just [ORG MOD  ] ) approval for the operation or to put any additional conditions on it . 
Furthermore , regarding the May 14 expectation that the [LOC U.S.  ] must follow up on all cases of alleged terrorists who were detained as a result of [ORG CEDAR  ] SWEEP intel , [PER Leslie  ] said that was not at all what [ORG HMG  ] intended to convey to the [ORG USG  ] . 
In fact , ministers had merely wanted to impress upon the [ORG USG  ] that they take the human rights considerations seriously . 
[PER Leslie  ] said as long as the [ORG USG  ] understood this , the issue needed no further discussion . 
[PER Rood  ] affirmed that the message was received. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Leslie  ] , however , was very frank that [ORG HMG  ] did object to some of what the [ORG USG  ] does ( e.g. renditions ) and therefore does have some redlines . 
Primarily , all requests for intel flights must come in writing from [ORG Embassy London  ] to Mr. Will [PER Jessett  ] at [ORG MOD  ] ; phone calls , demarches , and non-papers will not suffice . 
A/U/S [PER Rood  ] pushed hard to keep the process in mil-mil channels , but [PER Leslie  ] was insistent that Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] believed that “policy-makers needed to get control of the military.” [PER Leslie  ] mandated that , for ordinary intel flights , the grid/chart format that [ORG EUCOM  ] previously used would be acceptable if another column was added on the right that offered a very simple explanation and/or justification for the flight ( e.g. “in support of the Camp [PER David Accords”  ] ) . 
But [PER Leslie  ] drew a sharp distinction between ordinary intel flights and those from which the [ORG USG  ] shares intel with third parties . 
For the latter , she said , the more detailed submission discussed in ref E will be required . 
If a short notice approval were required , [ORG Embassy London  ] should submit it in writing and [ORG HMG  ] would do its best to push it through. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG PolMilOff  ] followed up with [ORG MOD  ] contact [PER Steve Gillard  ] , in Will Jessett’s office , May 19 to confirm MOD’s understanding of Leslie’s explanation . 
[PER Gillard  ] had not received a readout of the [MISC Leslie-Rood  ] meeting but confirmed that her instructions would be authoritative . 
He committed to closing the loop with [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG FCO  ] working level contacts . 
Recognizing that DOD had already done much of the work on the expanded submission that now seemed unnecessary for most of the flights , [PER Gillard  ] welcomed more , rather than less , information . 
[ORG PolMilOff  ] expressed concern that submitting unnecessary information could set a precedent and raise unrealistic expectations in [ORG HMG  ] for what the [ORG USG  ] would submit in the future . 
[PER Gillard  ] acknowledged this concern and noted he would welcome any additional information offered with a letter caveating that in the spirit of cooperation additional information was being submitted that will not be included in future requests for ordinary intel flights . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A/U/S Rood’s intervention has allowed us to obtain authoritative , albeit belated , guidance on HMG’s requirements for DOD flight clearances . 
Despite forceful arguments to keep the approvals process in mil-mil channels , [ORG HMG  ] was adamant that requests will have to come from [ORG Embassy London  ] ( either the Political or Defense Attache sections ) to Mr. Will [PER Jessett  ] at [ORG MOD  ] . 
For ordinary intel flights , this will involve OSD- and State-cleared instructions for [ORG Embassy London  ] to deliver to [ORG MOD  ] the grid normally constructed by [ORG EUCOM  ] on a trimester basis , but with an additional column containing an explanation/justification for the operation . 
[ORG Embassy  ] also recommends that another column be added explicitly stating whether the operation entails sharing intel with third parties . 
Ideally , the answer should be “no” for every operation on the grid , but the column would allow [ORG Embassy London  ] to ensure only the ordinary intel flights are contained therein . 
For flights that involve intel sharing with third parties , a more detailed submission , as described in Ref E , will be required . 
We understand that DOD has already compiled this additional information as a result of the instructions we received at the working level . 
We recommend proceeding with the more detailed submission for all flights but including a cover letter noting that the additional information is provided as a courtesy and does not set a precedent for future submissions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) A/U/S [PER Rood  ] has not had the opportunity to clear this cable .
