HOW [LOC U.S.  ] BUSINESS CAN THRIVE IN LIBYA: TECHNOLOGY TO TOURISM 2 . 
( C ) During a January 20 meeting in his prime office-space overlooking the [LOC Mediterranean Sea  ] , [PER Layas  ] discussed with the Ambassador ( accompanied by the [ORG FCS  ] officer and P/E chief ) the many ways in which [LOC U.S.  ] businesses could thrive in [LOC Libya  ] , through investment , trade , and joint ventures . 
He welcomed the February 20-23 [ORG Department of Commerce Trade Mission  ] and offered his thoughts on how to make the program a success -- " The best thing to do is to meet the right people here . 
You should have 2-3 ministers address the whole group . 
" He explained that the [ORG LIA  ] was very interested in attracting more [LOC U.S.  ] business to [LOC Libya  ] and believed the [LOC U.S.  ] could play a " major role " in [LOC Libya  ] 's development . 
During a recent visit to [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Layas  ] met with a number of [MISC American  ] company representatives , as well as the [ORG Export-Import Bank  ] ( [ORG EXIM  ] ) , to educate them on opportunities to invest in the " unique [ [MISC Libyan  ] ] market , " which according to him , unfortunately includes bureaucratic " red tape and corruption . 
" Some of the advantages that [PER Layas  ] saw the [LOC U.S.  ] having over [MISC European  ] competitors for contracts in [LOC Libya  ] are the weakness of the dollar compared to the [MISC Euro  ] , as well as [LOC U.S.  ] access to more advanced technology . 
[PER Layas  ] believes [LOC U.S.  ] companies can expand on their success in [LOC Libya  ] 's hydrocarbon market by competing for contracts in the electricity market , health services , and tourism . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Layas  ] was particularly interested in importation of advanced [LOC U.S.  ] medical technology , outlining plans to create a large medical center in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
He sees opportunities for [LOC U.S.  ] firms to enter into joint ventures with [MISC Libyan  ] companies to develop such plans . 
Additionally , he noted that the [ORG LIA  ] plans to manage a large tourism development plan , which will involve USD 1 billion projects in [LOC Western Libya  ] , [ORG Eastern Libya  ] , the [LOC Green Mountains  ] , and potentially another city ( most likely [LOC Tripoli  ] ) . 
[PER Layas  ] believes more than half of [LOC Libya  ] 's projected USD 136 billion development plan budget has been committed in contracts , but implied that some companies may back out of those contracts , as they were " reconsidering the conditions . 
" [PER Layas  ] asked the Ambassador to pass on the message that [LOC Libya  ] was still open to development by [LOC U.S.  ] companies and that [LOC Libya  ] wants to establish " lasting relationships " with major [LOC U.S.  ] firms . 
IMPROVING BILATERAL RELATIONS THROUGH VISAS 4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador attested to the interest of [MISC Americans  ] -- businesspeople , government officials , and tourists -- in coming to [LOC Libya  ] , but underlined the obstacles that [MISC Americans  ] face when trying to obtain visas . 
The current " visa freeze " for official [MISC Americans  ] was only the latest in a number of difficulties that [MISC Americans  ] faced . 
The Ambassador highlighted the imbalance in our governments' approaches to the relationship -- whereas the Embassy provided full consular services and had issued over 3,000 visas to [MISC Libyans  ] since opening in April 2009 , [LOC U.S.  ] tourists still could not visit [LOC Libya  ] . 
The situation is affecting Embassy operations , including planning for the [ORG Trade Mission  ] , and needs to be addressed . 
[PER Layas  ] sympathetically commented that he had also faced problems recently in trying to obtain visa approvals for a number of [MISC American  ] businessmen that had been invited to visit [LOC Libya  ] for business discussions . 
LIA'S INVESTMENTS: WEATHERING THE STORM 5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador stressed the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the bilateral relationship , including in trade and investment . 
He inquired about the state of the [MISC Libyan  ] economy and the [ORG LIA  ] 's wealth in particular , given fallen oil prices and the recent world economic crisis . 
[PER Layas  ] informed the Ambassador that [LOC Libya  ] had " weathered the storm " of the economic crisis . 
He noted that the [ORG LIA  ] operated with " high liquidity , " and therefore was not concerned about the volatility of the oil market . 
" We have USD [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000079 002 OF 002 32 billion in liquidity , " he stated , " mostly in bank deposits that will give us good long-term returns . 
" He explained that several [MISC American  ] banks are each managing USD 300-500 million of [ORG LIA  ] 's funds , and opined that the [ORG LIA  ] was entangled in a legal disagreement with [ORG Lehman Brother  ] 's due to a major investment that was " mismanaged . 
" He said that the [ORG LIA  ] has an office in [LOC London  ] and preferred doing business there rather than in the [LOC United States  ] , due to the " ease of doing business " in the [LOC UK  ] and relatively " uncomplicated tax system . 
" He noted that the [ORG LIA  ] 's primary investments are in [LOC London  ] , in banking and residential and commercial real estate . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Layas  ] denied press reports that the [ORG LIA  ] had invested USD 100 million with the infamous [PER Allen Stanford  ] . 
He said that he had personally written a letter to the " [ORG Financial Times  ] " disputing the information , explaining that [PER Stanford  ] had approached the [ORG LIA  ] in the middle of his crisis , offering a 7-8% share in his investment scheme , but [PER Layas  ] had refused . 
[PER Layas  ] also mentioned having been previously approached by [PER Bernard Madoff  ] about an investment opportunity , " but we did not accept . 
" On the contrary , [ORG LIA  ] 's recent purchase of the [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG Verenex  ] oil company -- after much controversy over the manner in which it was purchased and share price -- was considered by [PER Layas  ] a " good deal . 
" [ORG LIA  ] plans to operate [ORG Verenex  ] jointly with the [MISC Libyan  ] Investment and [ORG Development Corporation  ] ( [ORG LIDCO  ] ) . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment: The [ORG LIA  ] controls at least seven subsidiary organizations , and a fund that holds USD 32 billion in liquid assets . 
The fact that [PER Layas  ] weathered his own storm -- [ORG LIA  ] 's controversial , reported entanglement with [PER Allen Stanford  ] -- in a regime that has proven to be unforgiving in the face of embarrassment , is surprising , and indicative of his strong ties to powerful protectors within the [MISC Libyan  ] regime .
