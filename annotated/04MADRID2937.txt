( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: We accompanied [ORG Department of Energy  ] ( [ORG DOE  ] ) Deputy Administrator [PER Paul Longsworth  ] and [PER William Kilmartin  ] of the [ORG National Nuclear Security Administration  ] 's ( [ORG NNSA  ] ) Office of [ORG Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation  ] to meetings with the director of [ORG Spanish Customs  ] and the president of the [ORG Ports of State  ] regarding the [ORG Megaports Initiative  ] ( [ORG Megaports  ] ) . 
At [ORG Spanish Customs  ] , the proposed [MISC Spanish  ] translation of the [ORG Memorandum of Agreement  ] ( [ORG MOA  ] ) was discussed and appears to be satisfactory , although [ORG GOS  ] lawyers need to review the language upon their return from August vacations . 
The new president of the [ORG Ports of State  ] was briefed on [ORG Megaports  ] with its role in combating terrorism and understood a little better how [ORG Megaports  ] is different from the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) . 
End Summary . 
[ORG GOS  ] MAY BE PREPARED BY LATE SEPTEMBER FOR [ORG MOA  ] SIGNING IN THE [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After some discussion of the proposed changes to the [MISC Spanish  ] translation of the [ORG MOA  ] , Customs Director [PER Nicolas Bonilla  ] opined that the modifications were not substantial , and anticipated that following a review by legal counsel in September , the [ORG MOA  ] could be ready for signature . 
[PER Bonilla  ] noted that the signing should take place no earlier than 15 days after both parties agree on the final [MISC English  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] versions . 
[PER Longsworth  ] responded that the submitted [MISC English  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] drafts are the [ORG USG  ] 's proposed final versions , and that the [ORG USG  ] hopes for a response from the [ORG GOS  ] regarding the versions as soon as possible . 
Based upon [LOC Spain  ] 's August vacation schedule and subsequent legal review , [MISC Spanish  ] officials were hesitant to consider a signing date any earlier than the final week of September , but also did not want to speak about specific dates until legal review had taken place . 
Further , [PER Bonilla  ] suggested several times during the discussion that a [ORG GOS  ] official could travel to the [LOC US  ] to sign the [ORG MOA  ] . 
BRIEFING FOR NEW PRESIDENT OF PORTS OF STATE: [ORG MEGAPORTS  ] AND CSI NOT THE SAME <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mariano Navas Gutierrez  ] , the newly-appointed president of the [ORG Ports of State  ] , received an introductory briefing on [ORG Megaports  ] . 
He asked numerous questions about [ORG Megaports  ] and how it differed from [ORG CSI  ] , a [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] initiative now underway in [LOC Algeciras  ] . 
Although we had briefed him on these two initiatives in June , he demonstrated some confusion about the differences and similarities of these two initiatives . 
He expressed pleasure on learning that [ORG Megaports  ] should not hinder the flow of containers within the ports , and requested that the [ORG DOE  ] send additional information to him. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Welcoming a [MISC Spanish  ] official to the [LOC US  ] for the [ORG MOA  ] signing could provide an opportunity for further briefings on transportation security projects of mutual concern . 
A visit to a [LOC US  ] port where [ORG Megaports  ] equipment is already installed could also be productive . 
While the [ORG GOS  ] has consistently supported [ORG Megaports  ] , some confusion remains in distinguishing it from [ORG CSI  ] . 
It is understood that both [ORG CSI  ] and [ORG Megaports  ] involve many of the same [MISC Spanish  ] officials and will potentially target the same three ports over the next several years: [LOC Algeciras  ] , [LOC Barcelona  ] and [LOC Valencia  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials realize that both [ORG Megaports  ] and [ORG CSI  ] combat terrorism and involve containers . 
Yet these similarities probably contribute to the confusion . 
From an embassy perspective , it seems that [ORG CSI  ] and [ORG Megaports  ] may be distinguished in the following ways , respectively: document inspection followed by scanning of selected containers vs. goal of examining all containers ; host country paying for scanning equipment vs. DOE generally providing the equipment ; greater DHS personnel involvement in medium-term vs. minimal DOE personnel commitment ( primarily for set-up and training ) ; and sequential anticipated implementation at ports ( [LOC Algeciras  ] implemented before detailed assessment of [LOC Barcelona  ] and/or [LOC Valencia  ] ) vs. potential for almost simultaneous activation of [ORG Megaports  ] in at least two of the three ports . 
The Embassy continues ready to assist in furthering the implementation of both [ORG CSI  ] and [ORG Megaports  ] .
