( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Madame Secretary , Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] has been looking forward to meeting you since your nomination was first announced . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] leadership , including President [PER Mubarak  ] , are encouraged by the [ORG Administration  ] 's immediate attention to the [LOC Middle East  ] and your and the President 's early outreach to them . 
Overall , the [MISC Egyptians  ] believe they did not receive fair treatment from the previous [ORG Administration  ] and hope to see improvements . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] likely will explain [LOC Egypt  ] 's " soft power " --its ability to influence regional events without benefit of deep pockets . 
He likely will focus more on the strategic challenges of the region--the peace process and Iran--but may also address some pending bilateral matters . 
He may ask for your support for [LOC Egypt  ] to be part of an expanded G8 or G20 and press the candidacy of [MISC Egyptian  ] Culture Minister [PER Farouq Hosny  ] for Director General of [ORG UNESCO  ] . 
He may not raise human rights ( specifically [PER Ayman Nour  ] ) , political reform , or democratization ; but you should . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] will want to discuss [LOC Gaza  ] , including smuggling and counter-tunneling ; [LOC Iran  ] ; and the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace process . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] and counter-terrorism , we and the [MISC Egyptians  ] see largely eye-to-eye ; intelligence cooperation is close and effective ; and our military-to-military relationship is durable but stuck in a force-on-force mindset. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary continued: [PER Aboul Gheit  ] is smart , urbane , with a tendency to lecture and to avoid discussing [MISC Egyptian  ] failings with all-purpose recourse to [MISC Egyptian  ] sovereign pride . 
However , because this is his first meeting with you and it is in [LOC Washington  ] , he may be more inclined to listen . 
You should thank him for [LOC Egypt  ] 's continuing regional leadership , in particular regarding their efforts to bring about a ceasefire in [LOC Gaza  ] , and press him for [LOC Egypt  ] to continue to use their influence and good offices to achieve a permanent solution to intra-Palestinian infighting and conflict . 
You should also stress the need for [LOC Egypt  ] to more effectively insure that [ORG Hamas  ] cannot rearm via smuggling across -- or tunneling under -- the border with [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] will press for your attendance at the March 2 [ORG Gaza Donors Conference  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] , and may complain about unhelpful [MISC Qatari  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] behavior . 
He will also want to explore [LOC US  ] intentions towards [LOC Iran  ] ; President [PER Mubarak  ] told Senator [PER Mitchell  ] during his recent visit here that he did not oppose our talking with the [MISC Iranians  ] , as long as " you don't believe a word they say . 
" End summary. ------------------------ Respect and Appreciation ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In terms of regional affairs , Special [LOC Middle East  ] Envoy Senator [PER George Mitchell  ] struck the right chord during his recent visit to [LOC Cairo  ] when he told President [PER Mubarak  ] that he was here to " listen and hear your advice . 
" The [MISC Egyptians  ] have long felt that , at best , we take them for granted ; and at worst , we deliberately ignore their advice while trying to force our point of view on them . 
You may wish to thank [PER Aboul Gheit  ] for the vital role [LOC Egypt  ] played in bringing about a ceasefire in [LOC Gaza  ] , and its efforts at making it last . 
You should ask him what the current state of play is between [ORG Hamas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] and have him describe [LOC Egypt  ] 's vision of the future for the [MISC Palestinians  ] , both among their factions , and vis a vis [LOC Israel  ] . 
Note: Although the [MISC Egyptians  ] will react well to overtures of respect and appreciation , [LOC Egypt  ] is very often a stubborn and recalcitrant ally . 
In addition , [LOC Egypt  ] 's self-perception as the " indispensable [MISC Arab  ] state " is contingent on [MISC Egyptian  ] effectiveness on regional issues , including [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and [LOC Iraq.  ] ----------------------------------------- [LOC Egypt  ] and the [ORG Israel-Palestinian Conflict  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although [PER Aboul Gheit  ] was never enthusiastic about the [MISC Annapolis Peace  ] process , resolution of the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict remains the primary strategic political goal for the [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
They are proud of their role as intermediary , well aware that they are perhaps the only player that can talk with us , the [MISC Israelis  ] , and all [MISC Palestinian  ] factions . 
[PER Mubarak  ] hates [ORG Hamas  ] , and considers them the same as [LOC Egypt  ] 's own [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , which he sees as his own most dangerous political threat . 
Since the [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000231 002 OF 004 June 2007 [ORG Hamas  ] takeover of [LOC Gaza  ] , the [MISC Egyptians  ] , under the leadership of intelligence chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] ( the de facto national security advisor with direct responsibility for the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] account ) have shifted their focus to intra-Palestinian reconciliation and establishment of the [MISC Hamas-Israel  ] ceasefire . 
[PER Soliman  ] brokered a half-year-long truce last year , which [ORG Hamas  ] broke in December , leading to the [MISC Israeli  ] invasion of [LOC Gaza  ] . 
He has recently re-started those efforts , with the goal of getting [ORG Hamas  ] to agree to a year-long ceasefire , which should give the [MISC Egyptians  ] space to bring about their political goal of [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation under a technocratic , non-partisan government headed by President [PER Mahmoud Abbas.  ] ---------------- [LOC Gaza  ] and Tunnels ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Smuggling through the [ORG Sinai Peninsula  ] and into [LOC Gaza  ] is an old and complicated problem for [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] views a well-armed and powerful [ORG Hamas  ] as a national security threat , a point driven home in dramatic fashion by the January 2008 border breach when [ORG Hamas  ] bulldozed the old border fence and more than half a million [MISC Palestinians  ] poured into [LOC Egypt  ] , unchecked and hungry . 
Since the closure of the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border following the June 2007 [LOC Gaza  ] takeover by [ORG Hamas  ] , most smuggling of consumer goods and weapons has gone underground . 
The narrow corridor between [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] is as honey-combed with subterranean passageways as a gigantic ant colony. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although it is not directly in [PER Aboul Gheit  ] 's bailiwick , belonging more to the security and intelligence forces , nonetheless the issue of tunnels and rearming [ORG Hamas  ] is the subject of intense scrutiny ( by [LOC Israel  ] and the [ORG Congress  ] ) , and sensitivity ( by the [MISC Egyptians  ] ) . 
Long criticized by [LOC Israel  ] for " not doing enough " to halt arms smuggling via tunnels , the [MISC Egyptians  ] have stopped complaining and started acting . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has increased efforts to counter arms smuggling by accelerating its $23 million FMF-funded tunnel detection program along the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border and requesting [LOC U.S.  ] support to purchase four backscatter X-Ray machines to scan vehicles entering the [ORG Sinai  ] for weapons and explosives ( note [PER Aboul Ghait  ] may not be of this EGIS-originated request ) . 
[LOC Egypt  ] also continues to cooperate with [LOC Israel  ] , especially via intelligence sharing , to prevent militants from [ORG Hamas  ] and other extremist organizations from crossing the [LOC Gaza  ] border , and on thwarting militant activity in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] efforts are all justified under President [PER Mubarak  ] 's pledge that [LOC Egypt  ] with " protect its borders . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] will not take any action that could be perceived as collaboration in [LOC Israel  ] 's siege of [LOC Gaza  ] , and they have been hyper-sensitive to any suggestion that foreigners are assisting them or overseeing their efforts to counter smuggling . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] publicly distanced [LOC Egypt  ] from our January MOU with [LOC Israel  ] to combat arms smuggling into [LOC Gaza  ] , although he knew about it in advance and consulted with Secretary [PER Rice  ] and me about its contents . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] do not want to be stuck holding the [LOC Gaza  ] bag , and must be able to point the finger of blame at [LOC Israel  ] for the plight of the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
At the same time , [LOC Egypt  ] has withstood scathing and widespread criticism in the [MISC Arab  ] world for refusing to open the [LOC Rafah  ] border crossing to supply [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Even during the height of the December fighting , the [MISC Egyptians  ] only sent medicine and medical supplies through the [LOC Rafah  ] border ; all other humanitarian goods went through the [MISC Israeli  ] crossing at [LOC Kerem Shalom  ] . 
They likewise insist that [LOC Rafah  ] will only reopen to handle [MISC Gazan  ] travellers when the [MISC Gazan  ] side is under [LOC PA  ] control with [ORG EU  ] observers according to the 2005 [MISC AMA.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ultimately , [LOC Egypt  ] believes that the only realistic and viable solution to erode Hamas' power and stop arms smuggling is the return of the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] to [LOC Gaza  ] and the opening of [LOC Gaza  ] 's border to legitimate trade . 
While in the short term we can best assist the [MISC Egyptians  ] with technical know-how and training , long term counter smuggling success will depend on reducing the financial incentives to smuggling by providing the [ORG Sinai Bedouin  ] with legitimate economic opportunities and by regularly opening the [LOC Gaza  ] borders to trade , thereby reducing economic incentives to smuggle. ---------------------------------- The March 2 [ORG Gaza Donors Conference  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] told Senator [PER Mitchell  ] that he [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000231 003 OF 004 wanted to personally invite you to the March 2 [ORG Gaza Donors Conference  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] will press hard for you to accept this invitation . 
He is keen to keep up the momentum on [LOC Gaza  ] reconstruction and for [LOC Egypt  ] to be seen as taking the lead in helping the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
It is very important to him that this conference be at the ministerial level , and he will be disappointed if you are unable to accept. ------------- [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Iran  ] ------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] enjoys recounting for visiting members of [ORG Congress  ] how he warned former President [PER Bush  ] against invading [LOC Iraq  ] , ending with , " I told you so ! 
" and a wag of his finger . 
In addition , there are [MISC Egyptian  ] misgivings about [PER Nuri Al-Maliki  ] and [ORG Shia  ] majority rule in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] therefore will need additional prodding to continue to take steps to help rehabilitate [LOC Iraq  ] into the greater [MISC Arab  ] world . 
You should ask [PER Aboul Gheit  ] when he plans to fully open the [MISC Egyptian  ] embassy in [LOC Baghdad  ] and exchange accredited ambassadors with [LOC Iraq  ] ( the first [MISC Egyptian  ] ambassador to post-Saddam [LOC Iraq  ] was assassinated ) . 
As for [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Mubarak  ] has a visceral hatred for the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] , referring repeatedly to [MISC Iranians  ] as " liars , " and denouncing them for seeking to destabilize [LOC Egypt  ] and the region . 
He sees the [MISC Syrians  ] and [MISC Qataris  ] as sycophants to [LOC Tehran  ] and liars themselves . 
There is no doubt that [LOC Egypt  ] sees [LOC Iran  ] and its greatest long-term threat , both as it develops a nuclear capability and as it seeks to export its " [ORG Shia  ] revolution . 
" Nonetheless , [PER Mubarak  ] told [PER Mitchell  ] pointedly that he did not oppose the [LOC U.S.  ] speaking to the [MISC Iranians  ] , as long as we did not " believe a single word they say . 
" [PER Aboul Gheit  ] will be keen to hear your description of [LOC U.S.  ] intentions towards [LOC Iran  ] . 
In his conversation with Senator [PER Mitchell  ] , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] carefully noting he was speaking personally , expressed more interest into bringing the [MISC Syrians  ] into negotiations again ; President [PER Mubarak  ] was not enthusiastic about dealing with the [MISC Syrians  ] at this time. ------------------------ [LOC U.S.  ] Assistance to [LOC Egypt  ] ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The greatest [MISC Egyptian  ] outrage a year ago -- [ORG Congressional  ] conditioning of $100 million of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Egypt  ] -- may now be moot , according to our latest understanding of the state of play with the [MISC FY2009  ] appropriations language . 
Beyond the issue of conditioning , the [MISC Egyptians  ] resent the [LOC U.S.  ] unilateral decision to cut [ORG ESF  ] in half , from $415 million in [MISC FY-08  ] to $200 million in [LOC FY-09  ] , a level which the [MISC Egyptians  ] find embarrassing , not because they need the money ( they say ) , but because it shows our diminished view of the value of our relationship . 
In my view , it is important to the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue an [ORG ESF  ] program aimed at health , education , and poverty eradication to demonstrate concern for the [MISC Egyptian  ] people as opposed to a strictly military assistance program . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has also been unhappy with the use of these funds to support democracy in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
It would be useful if you could urge that [LOC Egypt  ] accept the FY 2009 levels so that we can proceed to program funds to benefit [LOC Egypt  ] , while promising to engage in a serious review of the conflicts that exist and a desire to resolve them as soon as possible. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Concerning military assistance , the [MISC Egyptian  ] political and military leadership feel that they have been " short changed " by our holding to an FMF level of $1.3 billion , ( the same level for 30 years despite inflation ) , and which they contrast with increases to our military assistance to [LOC Israel  ] . 
Finally , [LOC Egypt  ] seeks a higher profile in international financial circles ( Finance Minister [PER Youssef Boutros Ghali  ] was recently named Chairman of the [ORG IMF  ] 's policy-setting committee , the [ORG IMFC  ] , the first from a developing country ) , and [PER Aboul Gheit  ] is likely to ask for your support to include [LOC Egypt  ] in expanded [ORG G8  ] and G20 fora. --------------------------------- [PER Ayman Nour  ] and [PER Saad Eddin Ibrahim  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] 's political leadership considers our public chastisement of their treatment of jailed former opposition [ORG Al Ghad  ] party leader [PER Ayman Nour  ] as interfering with internal affairs and infringement on national sovereignty . 
[PER Mubarak  ] takes this issue personally , and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly in public . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] 's view is that we have made [PER Ayman Nour  ] a freedom martyr , and a damaging ( and [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000231 004 OF 004 distorting ) prism through which we view our relationship with [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Much the same can be said about [PER Saad Eddin Ibrahim  ] , the outspoken political science professor and democracy activist who is in self-imposed exile in the [LOC U.S.  ] because of spurious law suits brought against him for allegedly defaming [LOC Egypt  ] . 
In a negative development in late January , [LOC Egypt  ] , s Attorney General-equivalent took action to advance the only criminal case pending against [PER Ibrahim  ] . 
You should press [PER Aboul Gheit  ] hard on [PER Nour  ] and [PER Ibrahim  ] , and also urge the GOE to stop arresting other less prominent political activists . 
[PER Nour  ] 's health is bad and he has served more than half his sentence ; he deserves a humanitarian pardon . 
You may wish to lay down a marker for a future discussion on democratization and human rights concerns . 
You might note that although you and the President want to improve the relationship , [LOC Egypt  ] could take some steps to remove these very volatile issues from the agenda. ------------ [PER Farouq Hosny  ] ------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] has mounted a full-scale international campaign to support the candidacy of Culture Minister [PER Farouq Hosny  ] for Director General of [ORG UNESCO  ] . 
The [ORG Arab League  ] and the [ORG African Union  ] have already publicly stated their commitment to [PER Hosny  ] , and the [MISC Egyptians  ] believe they also have the support of several [MISC Europeans  ] , notably the [MISC French  ] . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] will also seek [LOC US  ] support -- or , at least , not to actively oppose -- the candidacy of [PER Farouq Hosny  ] as the next Director General of [ORG UNESCO  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] informed him last year that we could not support the candidacy and urged [LOC Egypt  ] to put forward another name . 
[PER Abould Gheit  ] will argue [PER Hosny  ] 's merits for facing down the [MISC Islamic  ] extremists who want to narrow the space in [LOC Egypt  ] for artistic expression . 
[LOC U.S.  ] objections have been to statements [PER Hosny  ] has made that " [LOC Israel  ] had no culture . 
. .it stole cultural ideas from others and claimed them as its own " and other objectionable remarks . 
If we plan to derail the [PER Hosny  ] candidacy , we must provide a credible alternate , preferably an [ORG Arab  ] and/or [MISC Muslim  ] .
