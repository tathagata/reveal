( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The effects of the global financial crisis are visible within [LOC Brazil  ] 's sugar and ethanol sector with industry experts estimating that about 20 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol mills are suffering financial difficulty . 
Even though the fundamentals for the sector remain positive , and sugar prices and internal demand for ethanol should fortify the sector this year , the outlook for 2009 is mixed . 
Some ethanol producers have good cashflow , others are saddled with debt , and many lack viable financing . 
Although some consolidation is inevitable , experts do not foresee a major increase in market dominance by individual companies . 
The biggest impact from the crisis going forward will be postponement of new projects ; however , this is temporary as demand for ethanol continues to grow . 
Internationally , countries that had planned to develop ethanol industries could review or suspend them given the scarcity of financing as well as the lower price of gasoline . 
Over the long-term , [MISC Brazilian  ] producers still anticipate that international markets ( including the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , in addition to high internal demand , will increase demand for [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol . 
End Summary . 
In [MISC Crisis Before the Financial Crisis  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the global financial crisis hit [LOC Brazil  ] in September 2008 , [LOC Brazil  ] 's sugar and ethanol sector had already been suffering since 2007 from falling commodity prices . 
Many sugar and ethanol mills took on huge obligations from 2005 to 2007 when the euphoria over biofuels brought a wave of private investment . 
At that time , mills had high profit margins , easy access to credit , and immense future domestic demand growth . 
Bank credit was easy to access , though mostly short-term rolling credit lines as bridge loans until funding from the [ORG Brazilian Development Bank  ] ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) could be disbursed , leading many mills to take on large debt burdens and assume repayment based on future revenue streams on the assumption of continued access to cheap credit . 
In 2008 , however , excess sugar supply worldwide led to a decline in prices that abruptly cut revenues to pay rolling credit lines . 
Production costs , especially for inputs such as diesel and fertilizers , rose as well . 
Mills began to renegotiate with banks , at higher rates , to postpone debt payments . 
This scenario reverberated throughout the sector affecting established ethanol producers as well as new operations . 
[PER Jose Luiz Oliveiro  ] , Vice-President for [ORG Technology and Development  ] at [LOC Dedini  ] , the world 's largest capital goods producer for sugar and ethanol mills , told [PER Econoff  ] that by March 2008 the company was already experiencing a deceleration of new business. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Already overburdened , the global crisis deepened the financial problems for many in the sector . 
Rolling over debt payments became difficult ( at much higher borrowing costs ) or impossible given credit risk . 
Because mills often financed improvements and expansion with their own cash savings , and then sought financing from banks and [ORG BNDES  ] , many were left without savings to draw upon . 
[ORG Bradesco Corretora  ] sugar and ethanol analyst [PER Auro Rozenbaum  ] estimated that approximately 20 percent of the sector has been affected by the crisis . 
According to [MISC Antonio  ] de [PER Padua Rodrigues  ] from the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Sugarcane Association  ] ( [ORG UNICA  ] ) , mills that lacked financing began flooding the ethanol market to generate cashflow , thus exacerbating the problem for all by forcing down the price of ethanol in the market . 
Five of the 402 sugar and ethanol mills in [LOC Brazil  ] have already filed for bankruptcy , and many in the industry are closely following ongoing bank negotiations and possible buy-outs to signal future developments . 
( Note: It is hard to estimate the extent of financial difficulty across the sector . 
While most contacts suggested a figure around 20 percent of mills have been seriously affected by the crisis , a few bank estimates were much higher , up to 70 percent . 
End Note . 
) [ORG SAO  ] PAULO 00000092 002 OF 004 Financing [ORG Options Limited  ] and More Expensive -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The biggest current problem for the sector is access to financing . 
One consequence of the crisis , according to [PER Jose Carlos Giachini  ] from [ORG Rabobank  ] , is that foreign denominated debt payments grew with the depreciation of the [MISC Brazilian  ] currency relative to the [MISC US Dollar  ] . 
( Note: The second largest mill is expected to have net losses of [MISC USD  ] 26 million from October to December 2008 explicitly due to the negative foreign exchange impact . 
End Note . 
) He noted that spreads are up significantly across the sector , driving up interest rates despite the recent rate cut . 
Average interest rates in [LOC Brazil  ] for companies as of December 2008 were 30 percent per year and likely higher for the ethanol sector given higher delinquency rates . 
Furthermore , [ORG Banco Modal  ] analyst [PER Roberto Nogueira  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that " everyone in the sector " had taken on the toxic foreign exchange derivatives to help hedge against dramatic currency fluctuations , which also put them in a weaker financial position . 
( Note: In a separate meeting , the [ORG Head of Business Development  ] for [PER Cosan  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that [PER Cosan  ] was one of the few mills that had no exposure to derivatives . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With few financing alternatives , a quick recovery for the sector is unlikely . 
[LOC Padua  ] outlined three major areas where financing was needed: 1 ) [ORG BNDES  ] , which provided approximately [MISC USD  ] 350 million to the sector in 2008 , excludes sugar and ethanol from its pre-shipment loans which are badly needed to help finance exports , 2 ) creating financing instruments to cover production costs would help stabilize prices between seasons and limit the incentive for mills without access to credit to flood the market to generate cashflow , and 3 ) a price-stabilizing warrantage system that pays producers to store excess production . 
( Note: Warrantage is a credit system in which farmers/growers stock their production at harvest when prices are low and receive cash on credit . 
End Note . 
) Despite clearly defined financing solutions , [LOC Padua  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that he did not expect any widespread GOB action in the near term because it served the government politically to keep prices as low as possible . 
He believes a solution would be on a company by company basis , with small adjustments within the market . 
Widespread Consolidation Unlikely --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As with many sectors in [LOC Brazil  ] , interlocutors expect some consolidation , but do not expect a major systemic change in the concentration of market share within the sector . 
The largest producer , [PER Cosan  ] , has 18 mills and crushes 10 percent of the country 's sugarcane . 
[PER Cosan  ] 's [ORG Head of Business Development  ] [PER Marcelo Martins  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that some companies be forced to sell mills because they cannot survive . 
Despite [PER Cosan  ] 's privileged financial position , the company is maintaining a more conservative approach when considering the potential acquisition of any one of these failed mills in order to maintain a healthy balance sheet . 
CEO of [PER ETH Bioenergy  ] , [ORG Odebrecht  ] 's ethanol subsidiary , said despite the waiting list of companies wanting to sell , the company would carefully evaluate any potential acquisitions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rozenbaum  ] explained that the sector was unique and that the limited opportunities for vertical integration meant that it was not a driving force for consolidation . 
In fact , [PER Cosan  ] is one of the few mills in [LOC Brazil  ] that operates throughout the entire value chain , from its recent land acquisition to its purchase of the [ORG Esso  ] gasoline distribution network from [ORG Exxon Mobile  ] last year . 
[PER Rozenbaum  ] noted that the majority of small family operated mills own land , grow sugarcane , and produce sugar and ethanol , but would not venture beyond these activities . 
[LOC Padua  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that he expected consolidation among the bigger producers that were overleveraged rather than the smaller family producers that he believes will weather the storm . 
[PER Martins  ] agreed , noting that [PER Cosan  ] was targeting large mills for potential acquisition rather than [ORG SAO  ] PAULO 00000092 003 OF 004 small family producers . 
( Note: [LOC Brazil  ] crushed 500 million tons of cane last year . 
" Large mills " are generally defined as more than two million tons of cane ; however , hundreds of mills crush only one to two million tons of cane per year . 
End Note . 
) Postponement of [ORG New Investment Likely  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The most obvious near-term impact from the international crisis on the sector is likely to be a decline in the rate of production growth . 
[LOC Padua  ] said that some 15 of the 35 mills projected to open in 2009 , each requiring an investment of [MISC USD  ] 200 million , would be delayed . 
According to press reports , investment in sugar and ethanol mills is expected to decline by 40 percent this year . 
Now that well-capitalized start-ups will have the option of purchasing overburdened mills at discounted prices , some expect delays in new greenfield projects . 
[PER Fernando Moreira Ribeiro  ] from [LOC ETH  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that the company is reviewing its investment strategy and that many of its planned greenfield projects for 2010 and 2011 could be replaced by purchases of existing mills . 
He expected delays on construction of mills that were scheduled for 2010 and beyond. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The crisis , however , did not figure into the production delays in 2008 . 
Many mill openings delayed in 2008 were due to low sugar prices , backlogs for equipment , and slow disbursement of [ORG BNDES  ] financing . 
[PER Dedini  ] 's [PER Oliveiro  ] noted that projects where significant investment had already been made , including equipment purchased ( 36 months lead-time ) , growing sugarcane ( 60 months lead time ) , and building a mill , would be completed regardless of the crisis . 
[LOC Padua  ] estimated that projects with 80 percent investment completed would be concluded because of the need to generate cashflow . 
Prospects for 2009 and Beyond ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Industry contacts all agreed that the outlook for the sector was positive , based on strong fundamentals over the next few years . 
Many opined that the major difference now versus the last crisis in 1996 is the positive outlook for demand . 
Despite the global slowdown , demand for sugar should remain constant because it is the cheapest sweetener and not generally affected by economic downturns . 
Sugar prices in 2009 should recover because of a decline in production in [LOC India  ] due to weak sugar prices , which [ORG Rabobank  ] calculated would result in some three to four million tons in additional [MISC Brazilian  ] exports . 
As a result , flexible mills ( those that can alter their ratio of sugar to ethanol ) will probably produce more sugar than in 2008 . 
[PER Cosan CFO Paulo Diniz  ] said the company was preparing to produce 60 percent sugar and 40 percent ethanol in 2009 . 
( Note: The [MISC Brazilian  ] mix in 2008 was 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent sugar because of low sugar prices and strong internal demand for ethanol . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the same time , most in the sector assume that internal demand for ethanol will continue to increase . 
Industry consultant [PER Julio Martins Borges  ] of [ORG JOB Consulting  ] expects a deceleration in internal ethanol demand , but continued growth . 
Industry expert [PER Plinio Nastari  ] 's consulting firm Datagro estimates growth of approximately five percent in sugar cane milled for the 2009 season . 
[ORG Rabobank  ] 's models show a 2.4 billion liter increase in ethanol consumption ( 12 percent ) even with a 50 percent reduction in car sales in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( Note: [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol consumption in 2008 was 19.6 billion liters of ethanol . 
End Note . 
) Furthermore , all industry contacts with whom [PER Econoff  ] met judged that [ORG Petrobras  ] was unlikely to cut [MISC Brazilian  ] gasoline prices . 
Despite a decline in world oil prices ( after a peak in July 2008 ) , [ORG Petrobras  ] has maintained gasoline prices fixed in [LOC Brazil  ] since 2005 . 
As of February 10 , the price of [MISC Brazilian  ] gasoline is being sold at a 32 percent premium over the market price for gasoline with oil at [MISC USD  ] 40 per barrel . 
As a result , consumers still prefer ethanol over gasoline . 
( Note: The generally understood price point for choosing [ORG SAO  ] PAULO 00000092 004 OF 004 ethanol over gasoline is when ethanol is less than 70 percent of the price of gasoline . 
Ethanol in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , where 37 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's cars circulate , sold for 55 percent of the price of gasoline in January . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Rabobank  ] estimated that ethanol exports , especially to the [LOC United States  ] , would decline in 2009 by about one billion liters from 2008 ( Ref B ) . 
Unlike [LOC Brazil  ] , lower gasoline prices in the [LOC U.S.  ] reduce incentives for distributors to increase the ethanol blend in gasoline . 
However , industry contacts expressed a more positive outlook for the external market over the longer term . 
[PER Dedini  ] 's [PER Oliveiro  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] market remains a positive future growth opportunity for many ethanol producers , but infrastructure projects to facilitate exports would be delayed due to the global financial crisis , limiting that market until financing returned to the sector . 
Private sector plans to build an ethanol pipeline and port terminals for ethanol exports have been put on hold . 
[PER Giachini  ] told [PER Econoff  ] he did not expect large scale new investments from the private sector until capital markets returned to normal functioning. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Financing will continue to be scarce for the sector over the next few years until ethanol producers can show healthy balance sheets . 
[ORG Rabobank  ] expects company balance sheets will be bad in 2009 . 
[PER Giachini  ] explained that cashflow would recover in 2009 due to a better pricing for sugar and ethanol , but that debt and interest payments would increase with the currency depreciation . 
He indicated this fact would continue to plague financing . 
Because the fiscal year for many mills ends in March , [PER Giachini  ] suspected that weak balance sheets would limit financing until 2011 , when the sector would recover . 
Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The effects of the financial crisis on the sugar and ethanol sector are real , though opinions are mixed as to the extent of the impact . 
There seems to be general agreement that [LOC Brazil  ] 's domestic ethanol demand is assured , and should continue to absorb all additional ethanol production even with falling oil prices . 
Domestic ethanol demand combined with the stable global demand for sugar , will likely pull the sector along despite the lack of financing . 
However , the lack of financing is likely to cause some plants to fold . 
In the short term , the growth of ethanol exports will likely be constrained , due to internal consumption of most of the available ethanol supply , as well as infrastructure challenges inhibiting large scale exports of ethanol , the solutions to which may be delayed by lack of available financing . 
In the long term , producers will look to overseas markets to complement the anticipated increase in domestic demand . 
While the sector overall appears to be positioned to fare the crisis without too much damage , it is clear growth will probably slow in the near term . 
Despite somewhat reduced growth expectations for domestic industry , the GOB is likely to continue its drive to build a global ethanol industry , both as a tool for development aid and to increase the potential international ethanol market with an eye towards creating future buyers of [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol . 
However , the ability of third countries to find financing for these projects in the wake of the global financial crisis and the precipitous decline in oil prices remains to be seen .
