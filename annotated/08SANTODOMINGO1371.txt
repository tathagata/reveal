SANTO DOMINGO 1353 Classified By: Ambassador PRFannin for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
Executives with [ORG Forbes Energy  ] met with the Ambassador regarding the company , s planned USD 700 million sugarcane ethanol project straddling the [MISC Dominican  ] [MISC Republic-Haiti  ] border . 
They said that while they have already obtained all needed permits for the project , which will be based in [LOC Manzanillo  ] , [LOC Montecristi  ] , [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , they continue to face unnecessary delays and moving goalposts that they interpret as prompts for bribes from government officials . 
They also described two overt solicitations from high-level officials for cash payments . 
The project is currently held up due to delays in finalizing a negotiated land swap with a state entity ; the Ambassador has sent a letter to the top official of this entity requesting a status update . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On August 28 , the Ambassador met with [ORG Forbes Group  ] CEO [PER Lucien Forbes  ] , Director of External Relations [PER Josh Fenton  ] , and Chief Legal Counsel [PER D. Edward Wilson  ] . 
Also present were [PER DCM Bullen  ] , EconChief , [ORG PAO  ] , EconOff and [ORG FCSO  ] . 
The meeting followed a July 31 , 2008 meeting between the company and [ORG WHA Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Shannon  ] ( ref A ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [ORG Forbes  ] executives said that the company has been working since 2006 to establish operations in the northern border region to produce ethanol from sugarcane stock primarily for export to the [LOC U.S.  ] market . 
Initially , the plant would denature [MISC Brazilian  ] &wet8 ethanol for the [LOC United States  ] . 
Subsequently , the company will produce ethanol from locally-grown sugarcane stock for the domestic and export markets as well as generate 50 MW of electricity from bagasse ( sugarcane waste ) for sale to the [MISC Dominican  ] electricity grid . 
The major part of the project will operate under the Special Duty-Free Zone tax incentive regime . 
The local affiliate of the company , [ORG Forbes Energy Dominicana  ] , S.A. , has already received a 20-year renewable permit for a duty-free zone . 
The executives said that this will be one of the largest private investments ever in the country and the largest commercial venture of its kind in the world. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The project would also impact [LOC Haiti  ] . 
While the ethanol and electricity production will all take place in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [PER Forbes  ] plans to either cultivate land that it buys or else buy feedstock from [MISC Haitian  ] producers directly across the border from its [MISC Dominican  ] assets . 
[PER Forbes  ] said he aims to make the project fully operable with an entirely [MISC Haitian-Dominican  ] workforce within five years of launch. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although the [PER Forbes  ] executives said that the company has obtained all necessary permits to begin the project and negotiated a [ORG Power Purchase Agreement  ] ( [ORG PPA  ] ) for the sale of electricity to the local grid , they are awaiting the signature of [PER Radhames Segura  ] , the executive vice president of the [ORG Dominican Corporation of State Electrical Companies  ] ( [ORG CDEEE  ] ) , on a land-swap agreement . 
Although [PER Segura  ] has told [PER Forbes  ] that &It , s done8 , weeks have passed without a signed agreement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The executives said they feel that [PER Segura  ] is moving the goalposts in an attempt to prompt a personal payment for him to facilitate the project , s completion , but noted that he has never directly solicited a bribe. &He knows this is costing me money , 8 [PER Forbes  ] said . 
[PER Fenton  ] said that the company would absolutely not pay any bribes and asked the Ambassador to support this position . 
The executives also mentioned two overt requests for bribes from senior [ORG GoDR  ] officials . 
[PER Forbes  ] said that at the end of 2007 the former Minister of Tourism [PER Felix Jimenez  ] offered to get all necessary permits in exchange for USD 10 million . 
( [PER Note: Jimenez  ] was removed from his post on August 16 in the inauguration cabinet reshuffle ( ref B ) . 
However , [PER Jimenez  ] recently told the [LOC CONGEN  ] that he was going to be the next Ambassador to [LOC Washington  ] after he improves his [MISC English  ] . 
End Note . 
) They also noted a similarly explicit request for cash from an assistant to the Secretary of Defense whose name they did not recall. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Forbes  ] also described the project as a victim of a political rivalry between [PER Segura  ] and [PER Juan Temistocles Montas  ] , the Secretary of Economy , Development and Planning . 
He criticized the [PER Fernandez  ] administration , s inability to transcend the personal impasse between these two officials , both of whom are rumored to have presidential ambitions . 
He said that while &the problem is [PER Radhames Segura8  ] , he wondered whether the true holdup lies with the President himself . 
He urged the Ambassador to make contacts with key [ORG GoDR  ] officials on the company , s behalf. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador told [PER Forbes  ] that he appreciated the corruption-related challenges that the company is facing in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , and described [ORG USG  ] efforts to combat the government corruption at the institutional level through USAID programs and other efforts . 
The Ambassador agreed to write a letter to [PER Segura  ] inquiring into the status of the land swap agreement . 
The letter was sent on August 28. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
While the corruption issues that [PER Forbes  ] raised are not new or surprising , it was disturbing to hear of the audacity of certain [ORG GoDR  ] officials in offering their assistance in exchange for large bribes . 
It is even more worrisome that Post has now heard from two different sources that [PER Jimenez  ] could be appointed as the next Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] Post will consider whether to request a revocation of [PER Jimenez  ] 's visa for corruption and looks forward to coordinating with the [ORG Department on  ] whether to accept agreement for the former minister if he is nominated as Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] END COMMENT .
