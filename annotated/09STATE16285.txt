S.  ] ELIOT KANG , ACTING FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
See paragraphs 6-9. ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) Director General ( [ORG DG  ] ) [PER ElBaradei  ] released his latest reports on the status of the [ORG IAEA  ] 's investigations into [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] 's nuclear programs on 19 February 2009 . 
Both reports conformed to expectations in describing the absence of any meaningful steps by either country to address the serious issues that exist with respect to their nuclear programs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With respect to [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG DG  ] [PER ElBaradei  ] 's description of the dichotomy between the stalled investigation and rapid pace of [LOC Iran  ] 's centrifuge advances is stark . 
The report underscores the number of outstanding issues that need to be clarified regarding possible military dimensions to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] simply notes that it has " still not received a positive reply from [LOC Iran  ] " regarding its request for access to relevant " information , documentation , locations or individuals . 
" Consequently , " the [ORG Agency  ] has not made any substantive progress on these issues . 
" [LOC Iran  ] 's failure to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] in this regard suggests [LOC Iran  ] continues to wish to hide the nature of these activities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the same time , the [ORG IAEA  ] reported that , far from having complied with its UNSC obligation to suspend its uranium enrichment and heavy water-related activities , [LOC Iran  ] has continued to expand its activities at the [ORG Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant  ] ( [ORG FEP  ] ) and [ORG Arak Heavy Water Research Reactor  ] . 
Approximately 5,500 centrifuges are operating , up from approximately 3,800 in November <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
Of particular concern , the [ORG IAEA  ] notes that since February 2007 , [LOC Iran  ] has produced 1,010 kilograms of low enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) , a substantial increase over the 630 kilograms reported in November 2008 . 
Approximately 1,300 kilograms of [ORG LEU  ] would be sufficient for one nuclear weapon if [LOC Iran  ] decided to go that route . 
Currently , this material remains under [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards . 
Nevertheless , the risk posed in an [MISC Iranian  ] breakout scenario , either from diversion of safeguarded nuclear material or through the covert enrichment of undeclared nuclear material , is higher than in the past . 
Morever , [LOC Iran  ] continues to deny the [ORG IAEA  ] access to the [ORG Arak  ] reactor to conduct a [ORG Design Information Verification  ] inspection which would provide the [ORG IAEA  ] assurances that the construction of the reactor does not serve as a pathway to divert nuclear material for weapons purposes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG DG  ] [PER ElBaradei  ] 's report on [LOC Syria  ] reinforces our conclusion that [LOC Syria  ] was engaged in a clandestine effort to construct and operate a nuclear reactor at [LOC Al  ] [PER Kibar  ] . 
The report also helps to confirm that uranium found via environmental samples collected at the site is not naturally occurring , lending credence to the fact that the facility in question was a reactor . 
Although the report does not categorically dismiss [LOC Syria  ] 's explanation that the uranium was from [MISC Israeli  ] missiles used in the attack on the reactor in September 2007 , it suggests that this explanation is highly unlikely . 
[LOC Syria  ] delivered an eleventh-hour letter on 17 February 2009 attempting to demonstrate a degree of cooperation immediately before the report 's release . 
The report notes that the responses in the [MISC Syrian  ] letter " were only partial ... and did not address most of the questions raised in the Agency 's communications . 
" Importantly , the report also calls on [LOC Syria  ] to allow access to other locations and allow inspectors to take samples of the debris removed from [PER Al Kibar  ] as soon as possible , noting that these measures are " essential " for the [ORG IAEA  ] to be able complete its assessment. --------------- Action Requests --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ACTION REQUEST FOR ALL POSTS: Posts are requested to convey [LOC U.S.  ] views regarding the [ORG IAEA  ] reports to appropriate host governments . 
Posts should underscore that these reports demonstrate that neither [LOC Iran  ] nor [LOC Syria  ] have taken any meaningful steps to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] in the past six months . 
Posts should stress that [LOC Syria  ] 's refusal to do so only deepens concerns regarding the nature of its clandestine nuclear activities . 
With respect to [LOC Iran  ] , Posts should emphasize that while [LOC Iran  ] has stalled the [ORG IAEA  ] 's investigation and still refuses to provide the [ORG IAEA  ] with requested transparency , its centrifuge program continues to make progress . 
The net result is that in neither case can the international community have confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of these nuclear programs . 
For [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG UN Security Council  ] has imposed a mandatory requirement that it suspend all proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate fully with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , we should stress that with international rights , come responsibilities . 
[LOC Iran  ] needs to live up to those responsibilities . 
We believe that [LOC Iran  ] 's continued failure to do so is another opportunity lost. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ACTION REQUEST FOR ALL POSTS CONT: With respect to the upcoming 2-6 March 2009 [ORG IAEA Board  ] of [ORG Governors'  ] meeting , Posts should stress the need for the following from host governments: -- Strong national statements on [LOC Iran  ] and call on [LOC Iran  ] to impement its international nuclear obligations without delay . 
Statements should urge [LOC Iran  ] to take advantage of this critical opportunity for engagement by addressing the concerns of the international community and underscore the need for full transparency with the [ORG IAEA  ] ( including [LOC Iran  ] 's implementation of the Additional Protocol ) and cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] 's investigation , as well as suspension of all proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities ; -- Strong national statements on [LOC Syria  ] and a demand that [LOC Syria  ] cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] 's investigation ; -- Strengthened statements on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] from regional or other groups , e.g. , [ORG European Union  ] , the [ORG Group of  ] 77 and [LOC China  ] , the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] , the Group of [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Carribean  ] ; the [ORG Africa Group  ] , etc . 
To the extent possible , Posts should encourage host goverments to instruct their delegations not to accept statements from any group to which they are a member that would downplay the factual reports of the [ORG IAEA  ] , or undercut the Agency 's ability to obtain the necessary information and access needed to resolve these serious issues ; and , -- [ORG Board  ] members should support , by vote if necessary , releasing the [LOC Syria  ] report to the public . 
This is essential for the public to appreciate the serious nature of [LOC Syria  ] 's failure to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
This report will also demonstrate the level of transparency in [ORG IAEA  ] affairs that we believe [LOC Syria  ] should manifest in its approach to the [LOC IAEA.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) ACTION REQUEST FOR UNVIE: In addition to conveying these messages to local [ORG IAEA Missions  ] , [ORG UNVIE  ] should continue working to promote support within the [ORG IAEA Secretariat  ] and among [ORG IAEA Board  ] Members for continuing and expanding the investigation into both [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] 's nuclear activities and pressuring both to cooperate with the respective investigations . 
[ORG Mission  ] is requested to place maximum effort into securing strong national statements demanding [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] by as many [ORG Board  ] members as possible , particularly those in the [ORG EU  ] . 
[ORG Mission  ] should also work to support a [ORG P5+1  ] statement on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Mission  ] 's efforts to build support for such statements should begin as soon as possible , and will be facilitated by technical briefings on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] 's nuclear efforts to [ORG Board  ] members in [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Vienna  ] the week prior to the [ORG Board  ] meeting . 
These briefings will be provided by State and [ORG IC  ] nonproliferation experts . 
[ORG Mission  ] is also requested to ensure that the [ORG IAEA  ] Director General 's forthcoming report on [LOC Syria  ] is made public , including by laying the groundwork for a vote in the [ORG Board  ] if necessary . 
If possible politically and statutorily , [ORG Mission  ] should seek the concurrent release of the November 2008 [LOC Syria  ] report , which was denied public release by [MISC NAM/Arab  ] intervention at the November 2008 [ORG Board  ] meeting . 
[ORG Mission  ] should begin coordinating with likeminded [ORG Board  ] members at the earliest possible date. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) ACTION REQUEST FOR [LOC LONDON  ] , [LOC PARIS  ] , [LOC MOSCOW  ] , [LOC BERLIN  ] , AND BEIJING: In addition to conveying [LOC U.S.  ] views regarding the [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] reports , Posts should stress that the [LOC United States  ] believes that the [LOC Iran  ] report reinforces the need for a strong [ORG P5+1  ] statement demanding [LOC Iran  ] 's immediate and full cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
Discussions regarding specific texts will be addressed in [LOC Vienna  ] and [LOC Washington.  ] --------------------------- [ORG POCS  ] AND REPORTING DEADLINE --------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Mission  ] is requested to report on the status of its efforts in advance of the [ORG Board  ] . 
[PER Richard Nephew  ] ( 202-647-7680 ) and [PER Matt Goldstein  ] ( 202-647-4196 ) are the [ORG Department 's POCs  ] for this issue .
