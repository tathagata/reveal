( C ) Summary . 
Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] and [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Dmitry Medvedev  ] used their first one-on-one meeting at the [MISC G8  ] summit to build a friendly rapport rather than “score points” on smaller contentious issues , said the [ORG Foreign Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) to members of the diplomatic community . 
According to the [ORG FCO  ] , [PER Brown  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] both expressed frustration at the stalled dialogue between the two governments , and pledged to reopen top-level lines of communication . 
They agreed on several issues , including support of a post-Kyoto framework , reformation of international institutions , and increased dialogue on climate change . 
At the same time , the pair did not dwell on more controversial issues , such as Kosovo’s independence and the [MISC Litvinenko  ] murder . 
The [ORG FCO  ] , s overall assessment of the meeting was positive , and the [ORG FCO’s Russian Office  ] sees in [PER Medvedev  ] a leader more open to domestic liberalization and cooperation with [LOC Britain  ] and the [LOC West  ] than was his predecessor. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary continued . 
Though the [MISC Brown-Medvedev  ] meeting touched on important international issues , the [ORG FCO  ] said the most important outcome were signs of a thaw in top-level [MISC UK-Russian  ] relations . 
As an example , they pointed to conversations with the [MISC Russian  ] government regarding [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and progress in gaining [MISC Moscow’s  ] support for some [MISC G8  ] action . 
Encouraged by the prospects of improving relations under [PER Medvedev  ] , the [ORG FCO  ] believes that now may not be the time to renegotiate items such as the [ORG Russia-EU Partnership and Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG PCA  ] ) , and that better agreements with [LOC Moscow  ] may be reached later , if [PER Medvedev  ] can successfully liberalize parts of [MISC Russian  ] society . 
End Summary . 
[MISC Litvinenko  ] ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) PM [PER Brown  ] briefly brought up the [MISC Litvinenko  ] murder case and the extradition request , and [PER Medvedev  ] apparently sought to bury the matter by referring to it as a “legal issue.” [PER Medvedev  ] said that it was a “sad affair , ” but that it should be a matter left to the courts . 
[ORG FCO  ] reported that no transformative dialogue occurred , and that no progress was made on the issue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) In a separate meeting on the day of the briefing , [ORG Cabinet Office Director  ] General [PER Margaret Aldred  ] confirmed to the [ORG DCM  ] that the [PER Brown  ] meeting had been “fairly relaxed” and not strained . 
[PER Aldred  ] said the cost of the fall-out to [ORG HMG  ] from the [MISC Litvinenko  ] issue was an end to close cooperation with [MISC Russian  ] intelligence ( [ORG FSB  ] ) on counterterrorism and other global issues . 
Visas and Diplomatic Relations ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [PER Brown  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] made little progress on the issue of diplomatic visas , which are still being restricted by both countries as part of the fall-out from the [MISC Litvinenko  ] case .

( [LOC C/NF  ] ) According to the [ORG FCO  ] , [ORG HMG  ] has had good reasons to refuse many [MISC Russian  ] visa requests . 
[ORG HMG  ] officials see a real “intelligence threat from” [LOC Russia  ] ( in addition to [LOC China  ] ) , and regret a “missed opportunity” in the late 1990s and early 2000s to assess these intelligence threats . 
[ORG FCO  ] officials explained that the [MISC Russian  ] government is still restricting visas to [LOC UK  ] diplomats , that [ORG HMG  ] is not be able to fully staff its embassy in [LOC Russia  ] , and that local [MISC Russian  ] hires have been harassed by the [ORG FSB  ] . 
Accordingly , [ORG HMG  ] is restricting the number of visas issued to [MISC Russian  ] officials . 
The [ORG FCO  ] reports that [ORG HMG  ] had proposed a deal on easing visa restrictions , but that [LOC Russia  ] is requiring that [ORG HMG  ] consult with the [ORG FSB  ] on any mutual visa agreement . 
[ORG HMG  ] continues to refuse to engage directly with the [ORG FSB  ] , pending resolution of the [MISC Litvinenko  ] murder case .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Medvedev  ] confirmed to [PER Brown  ] that he had met with [MISC Russian  ] shareholders of [ORG TNK-BP  ] , and indicated to them that they could seek legal recourse through [MISC Russian  ] courts , if they had concerns with how the joint venture was operating .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Medvedev  ] brought up the need for major reform of international institutions , one of the [MISC PM’s  ] main international initiatives . 
[PER Medvedev  ] told [PER Brown  ] that international financial institutions need to be more engaged in managing the global credit crunch . 
[ORG British Council  ] --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Medvedev  ] told [PER Brown  ] that while [LOC Russia  ] no longer views the [ORG British Council  ] in [LOC Russia  ] as a “den of spies , ” there still exist legal issues regarding the [ORG British Council  ] , s activities in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Medvedev  ] implied that politicians are not in a position to discuss what is or is not legal , and that [MISC Russian  ] courts will make the final decisions regarding the [ORG British Council  ] , s [MISC Russian  ] operations . 
[ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Medvedev  ] indicated to [PER Brown  ] that [LOC Russia  ] might be willing to support a 2012 post-Kyoto framework , but expressed concerns about the rapid industrialization of [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] and its potential to undermine any international agreement on carbon emissions . 
[ORG FCO  ] , s [PER Analysis: Medvedev  ] is not [PER Putin  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [ORG FCO  ] officials expressed optimism that [PER Medvedev  ] will bring a partial liberalization to [MISC Russian  ] political life . 
They see signs of a slow break with [PER Putin  ] , including the former President , s failure to attend the [MISC G8  ] summit , the retirement of several high-ranking [MISC Putin-appointed  ] generals , and the appointment of [PER Antoly Chubais  ] , a liberal and close [PER Medvedev  ] ally , to the presidency of [LOC Rosnanotech  ] , which [ORG FCO  ] views as a huge “Kremlin slush fund.” On the other hand , several of [PER Putin  ] , s men are still in the upper echelons of the [LOC Kremlin  ] , though the [ORG FCO  ] believes that they will be removed over the next few years. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [ORG FCO  ] officials said that the [ORG EU  ] should hold off on signing a new [ORG PCA  ] , which expires at the end of 2008 , and wait to see if [PER Medvedev  ] liberalizes parts of [MISC Russian  ] society before agreeing to long-term commitments . 
The [ORG FCO  ] stressed that the next few years should be geared towards improving upper-level [MISC UK-Russian  ] relations , and that high-level visits are the way forward . 
[ORG HMG  ] is planning several visits to [LOC Russia  ] in the fall , and will receive high-level [MISC Russian  ] officials early next year .
