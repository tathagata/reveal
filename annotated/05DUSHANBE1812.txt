( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: Although we now de-emphasize its previous [MISC Cold-War  ] primacy in [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy , [LOC Russia  ] still requires clear-eyed scrutiny for the havoc it can play with the President’s democracy agenda and larger goals for transformational diplomacy in the former [MISC Soviet  ] republics . 
We believe [LOC Russia  ] is exerting consistent and strong pressure on [LOC Tajikistan  ] to reduce the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Western  ] role and presence . 
Although Tajikistan’s “open-door” foreign policy seeks to balance competing foreign pressures for its own best interests , Moscow’s pressure is beginning to take a toll . 
To promote democracy and economic and political reform in [LOC Tajikistan  ] , we need to develop new ways to overcome negative [MISC Russian  ] actions and influence . 
END SUMMARY . 
WHY IS [LOC RUSSIA  ] FOCUSING ON [LOC TAJIKISTAN  ] ? <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Russia  ] is paying special attention to [LOC Tajikistan  ] because of its military base and other strategic interests , including the [ORG Nurek Space Tracking Center  ] . 
[LOC Moscow  ] is determined to do everything possible to prevent a “color revolution” in [LOC Tajikistan  ] that could threaten its perceived strategic interests . 
Working from the “siloviki” zero-sum-game worldview of current geo-politics , some in [LOC Moscow  ] seem to believe that the [LOC United States  ] wants additional and permanent [LOC U.S.  ] military bases in [LOC Central Asia  ] and sees [LOC Tajikistan  ] as a prime candidate , especially after the [LOC U.S.  ] loss of [LOC Karshi-Khanabad  ] in [LOC Uzbekistan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite the fact that Tajiks are war-weary and opposition-leary , and President [PER Rahmonov  ] is still genuinely popular , [LOC Moscow  ] truly fears a “color revolution” in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
Elsewhere , “color revolutions” have tended to bring [MISC Western-oriented  ] leaders to power , although in [LOC Tajikistan  ] no [PER Saakashvili  ] or [PER Yushchenko  ] is waiting in the wings . 
A “color revolution” in [LOC Tajikistan  ] , the “siloviki” fear , would open the door for a [LOC U.S.  ] military base , or even more devastating to [LOC Moscow  ] , for [ORG Dushanbe  ] to kick out the [MISC Russians  ] and give the [MISC Russian  ] military base to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The nightmare of the “siloviki” is that the [LOC United States  ] would then have a string of bases from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , through [LOC Tajikistan  ] , and into [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] to weaken [LOC Russia  ] and dominate [LOC Central Asia  ] , which [LOC Russia  ] persists in calling its “sphere of influence.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) This may sound like easily dismissed fringe paranoia , but the “siloviki” do not play by our rules of fact-based logic . 
It is worth recalling that [LOC Moscow  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [ORG Dushanbe  ] consistently put out the irrational rumor in 2004 that the [LOC United States  ] had secretly convinced [LOC Tajikistan  ] to demand that the [MISC Russian  ] Border Force leave the [MISC Tajikistan-Afghanistan  ] border which [LOC Russia  ] had controlled back to the 19th century . 
WHAT IS [LOC RUSSIA  ] DOING ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Because [LOC Russia  ] is militarily weak , it uses other means to assert its authority in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
After years of inconclusive negotiation , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Tajikistan  ] rapidly reached agreement in 2004 ( following [MISC Tbilisi’s  ] [PER Rose Revolution  ] ) to forgive Tajikistan’s bilateral debt and to establish the legal basis for the [MISC Russian  ] military base in perpetuity. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The symbolic culmination was President Putin’s October 16 , 2004 , visit to [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
To set the hook in [LOC Rahmonov’s  ] jaw , [PER Putin  ] also announced major investments , variously described as $1.2 billion to over $3 billion , in [LOC Rahmonov’s  ] pet interests - hydropower ( primarily [MISC Sangtuda-1  ] and secondarily [MISC Rogun  ] ) and the old [MISC Soviet  ] aluminum tolling industry . 
Until then , no nation , especially in the [LOC West  ] , took [LOC Rahmonov’s  ] pleas seriously to invest in these [MISC Soviet-era  ] behemoths , although it is now evident that they had some economic merit , especially for [MISC South Asia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Since [LOC Russia  ] made its commitment-in-principle , [LOC Iran  ] has expressed interest in creating the financial consortium for [MISC Sangtuda-2  ] , and [LOC China  ] has said it will invest in the [MISC Nurek Hydroelectric Station  ] . 
These potential investments , especially [MISC Russia’s  ] , could be seen as economically positive for [LOC Tajikistan  ] and the region , or at least politically benign - except that [LOC Russia  ] appears recently to be working to exclude [MISC Western  ] participation in them ( septel ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Through the second half of 2004 and 2005 , [LOC Russia  ] has mounted a campaign to prevent “color revolutions” in the [ORG CIS  ] . 
In overt media propaganda and in private and covert communications with governments like Tajikistan’s , [LOC Moscow  ] has asserted that [LOC U.S.  ] democracy [ORG NGOs  ] - specifically , [ORG National Democratic Institute  ] , [ORG International Republican Institute  ] , [ORG Freedom House  ] , and Internews - are [LOC U.S.  ] covert tools whose job is to prepare the local populations to overthrow “legal governments” in the [ORG CIS  ] . 
More recently , the goal of [MISC Russian  ] pressure seems to be to limit the presence of not just [LOC U.S.  ] democracy [ORG NGOs  ] but all [MISC Western  ] elements present in [LOC Tajikistan.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On the ground in [LOC Tajikistan  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] position seems to be hardening . 
The previous [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador , [PER Maksim Peshkov  ] , was reasonable , amiable , and accessible . 
He worked the diplomatic circuit and was always available for reasonably frank , even if inconclusive , discussions with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other [MISC Western  ] ambassadors. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Since the arrival in early summer of the high-level political appointee , Ambassador [PER Ramazan Abdulatipov  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has become a closed bastion . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy’s previous access to different sections of the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has nearly dried up , and [PER Abdulatipov  ] very seldom appears in public . 
He continues to accept diplomatic invitations , but almost invariably at the last minute pleads an unexpected visitor from [LOC Moscow  ] or that he is indisposed . 
The rare times that he is seen in public - e.g. , at important countries’ national days - he ostentatiously huddles in a corner with the most senior [MISC Tajik  ] officials present. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) At the same time , we and other [MISC Western  ] embassies hear that [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] officers have unlimited free access at any time to [MISC Tajik  ] Government offices , sometimes even barging in without appointments . 
This is especially telling because all other embassies are required to submit diplomatic notes , to which the responses are often long delayed , for appointments to conduct even the most mundane mid-level daily business. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Most important , the [MISC Russian  ] intelligence services thoroughly dominate Tajikistan’s [ORG Ministry of Security  ] . 
[ORG Ministry of Security  ] views often take precedence in the [MISC Presidential Apparat  ] and key ministries like Justice that is responsible for registering foreign [ORG NGOs  ] and [MISC Tajik  ] media outlets and political parties . 
BUT RAHMONOV IS NOT A SIMPLE PAWN <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Tajikistan  ] describes its foreign policy as “open door , ” and balances its relations with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and the [ORG European Union  ] seeking what is best from each for its own national interests . 
During the last six months , President [PER Rahmonov  ] has repeatedly let us know he is “satisfied” with the [MISC U.S.-Tajik  ] relationship . 
He is especially pleased with the security relationship - primarily [LOC U.S.  ] funding and training to increase [MISC Tajik  ] capabilities for border control , counter-narcotics , and counterterrorism. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Even on the contentious issue of [LOC U.S.  ] democracy [ORG NGOs  ] , [PER Rahmonov  ] has appeared to split the baby - refusing legal registration for [ORG National Democratic Institute and Freedom House  ] , but allowing them , nonetheless , to operate most of their programs . 
Another positive sign is that he has just approved for the national school curriculum a civic-education textbook that has been a long-term project of the [ORG International Foundation for Election Systems  ] ( [ORG IFES  ] ) . 
For some reason , [ORG IFES  ] is the only [LOC U.S.  ] democracy [ORG NGO  ] that escaped [MISC Tajik  ] scrutiny and operates unfettered . 
INCREMENTALLY CLOSING IN ON WESTERN NGO’S AND OTHERS <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) More recently , though , we detect an incremental hardening of the [MISC Tajik  ] position . 
Although no new [MISC Tajik  ] anti-NGO legislation is pending like in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , the [ORG Tajik Government  ] is consistently working to gain greater control over all [ORG NGOs  ] , not just democracy ones. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG Tajik Government  ] argues that during the 1992-97 [ORG Civil War  ] and in its aftermath , [MISC Western  ] [ORG NGOs  ] flooded into [LOC Tajikistan  ] without limit or supervision . 
[ORG Dushanbe  ] now wants to find out who is actually in [LOC Tajikistan  ] and what they are doing . 
For any country concerned about security , this is reasonable . 
But we also believe it is a [ORG Ministry of Security  ] response to [MISC Russian  ] prodding to prevent a “color revolution” and limit [MISC Western  ] influence. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Further , [LOC Tajikistan  ] has recently been floating a new policy position , including during Secretary of State Rice’s October visit and more recently with the [ORG European Union  ] . 
The [ORG Tajik Government  ] suggests it is time for foreign assistance delivered via [ORG NGOs  ] to cease and be replaced by direct foreign investment in infrastructure projects ( like the hydroelectric stations and roads ) and business “joint ventures.” <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Nazarov  ] has told us that this is , so far , a [ORG Tajik Government  ] “desire , not a policy” ( reftel B ) . 
[LOC Tajikistan  ] argues that [ORG NGOs  ] are both expensive , because of their high overhead to support foreign advisers , and sometimes ineffective . 
This , [LOC Tajikistan  ] says , is an unacceptable waste of foreign assistance . 
While this argument has some merit , it suggests a worrisome trend , and will scare off the very international investors they are trying to attract . 
INCREASING VISA DELAYS - MALEVOLENCE OR JUST INCOMPETENCE ? <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Even more worrisome , obtaining [MISC Tajik  ] visas is becoming more difficult - not just for [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG NGO  ] staff , but also for [MISC European  ] [ORG NGO  ] workers , foreign business people , and even staffs of international financial institutions . 
Being an “inscrutable Eastern country , ” [LOC Tajikistan  ] never likes to say “no.” It just drags things out until reasonable but impatient people give up . 
There is a credible view in the [MISC Western  ] diplomatic community that these new visa problems are a result of [MISC Russian  ] prodding to limit [MISC Western  ] influence in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
It is worth noting the [ORG Ministry of Security  ] vets all visa applications. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) However , another explanation is possible - corruption and incompetence . 
The previous reasonably professional chief of the Foreign Ministry’s [ORG Consular Office  ] was replaced this past summer by a [PER Rahmonov  ] relative ( reftel D ) , and that’s when the new problems started . 
It could be that he has the job to assure loyalty to a new restrictive visa policy . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX BOOST THE ECONOMY TO PREVENT A “COLOR REVOLUTION” <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Russia’s anti-U.S. stance in [LOC Tajikistan  ] and [MISC Dushanbe’s  ] incremental moves against [LOC U.S.  ] and other [MISC Western  ] [ORG NGOs  ] may be coincidental . 
However , we know [LOC Russia  ] agitates for countries like [LOC Tajikistan  ] to curtail , if not expel , [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG NGOs  ] . 
More indirectly , [LOC Russia  ] does not deliver “foreign assistance” via [MISC Russian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
Moscow’s promises of massive direct investment in hydropower and aluminum may have emboldened [PER Rahmonov  ] to begin to draw the line against NGO-provided [MISC Western  ] foreign assistance. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) We know [PER Rahmonov  ] understands clearly that one of the key trip-wires for “color revolutions” is chronic economic stagnation . 
While he has been reasonably open to economic reform that would eventually create the conditions for [MISC Western  ] economic investment , he may now be impatient with how long that process takes and that it comes with no tangible promises of investment . 
He may believe that to survive , he has to give [LOC Tajikistan  ] concrete economic improvement and growth , and do it fast. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) From the [LOC West  ] , [PER Rahmonov  ] receives painful and long-drawn-out economic restructuring and seemingly endless and inconclusive feasibility studies . 
From [LOC Russia  ] ( and [LOC Iran  ] and perhaps [LOC China  ] ) , he receives promises of large-scale investment that could potentially lift the entire economy . 
He has no extensive experience in the [LOC West  ] and no deep understanding of the complexities and realities of the global economy . 
He wants [MISC Tajik  ] economic growth , and he wants it now . 
If he has to take a little extra political baggage from [LOC Moscow  ] , that’s a price he may be willing to pay . 
At the same time , we do not believe that he will abandon [MISC Western-style  ] economic restructuring and reform . 
He wants to hedge his bets . 
WHAT CAN THE [LOC UNITED STATES  ] DO ? <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) PUBLIC DIPLOMACY: Our short-term focus will be to protect the interests of [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG NGOs  ] as deliverers of developmental assistance . 
A mid-level Foreign Ministry official recently told us that the [ORG Tajik Government  ] generally does not understand what [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG NGOs  ] really do and simply listens to [LOC Russia  ] on these matters ( reftel A ) . 
( COMMENT: This may not be as absurd as it seems . 
All written communication with any part of the government must be conducted by diplomatic note , and the [ORG Ministry of Security  ] screens all diplomatic notes . 
We suspect the [ORG Ministry of Security  ] does not pass forward diplomatic notes with which it does not agree . 
END COMMENT . 
) Embassy [ORG Dushanbe  ] plans to arrange information roundtables to bring together senior government officials and major [LOC U.S.  ] developmental [ORG NGOs  ] . 
We will also start a public diplomacy campaign of press releases focusing each week on one [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG NGO  ] and its achievements for [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
Print media reach a miniscule percentage of the population ; but we know that the [ORG Ministry of Security  ] and [ORG Presidential Apparat  ] carefully study each and every [ORG U.S. Embassy  ] press release , and that’s what counts. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) SUPPORT FOR [MISC TAJIK  ] HYDROPOWER IN GREATER CENTRAL ASIA: In brief , the [ORG U.S. Government  ] needs to make clear to the Government of [LOC Tajikistan  ] , in international fora and in public , that the [LOC United States  ] supports the development of [LOC Tajikistan’s  ] hydroelectric potential for export to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] to create new [MISC Central-South Asian  ] links . 
See septel. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) ENGAGEMENT: We cannot and should not attempt to compete with the constant back and forth of [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Tajik  ] officials between [LOC Moscow  ] and [ORG Dushanbe  ] - and even less should we attempt to emulate their drinking bouts . 
However , building on Secretary Rice’s successful October 13 visit , we would [ORG SIPDIS  ] definitely benefit from more frequent and - this is important - longer senior [LOC U.S.  ] visits . 
[PER Rahmonov  ] does indeed listen , but he needs to have [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors willing to spend more than a few hours in [LOC Tajikistan  ] every six months or so . 
He especially needs interlocutors who do not focus on the relatively stable security side of the bilateral relationship but who can tackle the harder parts of the relationship , including economic development. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( SBU ) [LOC U.S.  ] ASSISTANCE REVIEW: We do not want to appear like iconoclasts seeking to reinvent the wheel of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance for [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
But we do suggest for consideration two possibilities: <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) ( A ) For democracy [ORG NGOs  ] , we need to consider whether current partners’ approaches have been overtaken by events . 
For example , if [ORG Internews  ] can no longer be effective with its current programs because [LOC Tajikistan  ] is using its licensing regulations to strangle the broadcast of non-government information ( reftel C ) , we need to consider whether a refocus on training journalists and helping “independent” media outlets to become financially independent might be a better way to meet our media goals . 
Any [ORG NGO  ] will likely find successes to justify its current programs , but we may need a review council with political-level participation to determine whether current assistance is promoting [LOC U.S.  ] core policy goals - or if we are on self-defeating autopilot. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) ( B ) It may be useful to convene an off-cycle senior assistance review with both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Tajik  ] participants who are decision makers , not just at the technical level . 
We need to listen as well as to preach . 
What does [LOC Tajikistan  ] want ? 
How can we make what [LOC Tajikistan  ] wants support core [LOC U.S.  ] policy objectives ? 
We believe that if we make this effort , and especially if we can jointly reach consensus , there will be less pressure on [LOC U.S.  ] development [ORG NGOs  ] . 
This , in turn , will provide a wider space for the [LOC United States  ] to promote its core policy goals and objectives. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [LOC Tajikistan  ] has brought this latest crossroads on itself . 
There is the requisite political stability for [LOC Tajikistan  ] to continue on its modest path of democratic , economic , and political reform . 
However , thanks to [MISC Russian  ] pressure , [LOC Tajikistan  ] is embarking on a potentially confrontational approach that will slow development and encourage the [LOC Tajikistan  ] [MISC Government’s  ] worst instincts . 
Now is the time to encourage [LOC Tajikistan  ] to stay on track . 
END COMMENT .
