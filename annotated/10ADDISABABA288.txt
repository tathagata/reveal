( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a meeting on the margins of the [ORG African Union Summit  ] , A/S [PER Carson  ] and [MISC French  ] Africa Director [PER Stephane Gompertz  ] discussed the next steps for [LOC Guinea  ] , including the [ORG ECOWAS  ] observer mission and how to resume foreign assistance . 
On [LOC Niger  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] expressed [MISC French  ] displeasure over [PER Tandja  ] 's extension of term , but said [LOC France  ] had no plans to cut its foreign aid . 
Turning to [LOC Nigeria  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] said the January 28 joint statement sent a good message . 
On [LOC Madagascar  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] thought that both [ORG SADC  ] mediator [PER Joaquim Chissano  ] and other parties had made huge blunders . 
He said the [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] positions parted ways on who we consider to be at fault . 
[LOC France  ] does not favor any of the political actors , including the deposed president , while the [LOC U.S.  ] considers coup leader [ORG Rajoelina  ] to be the villain. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Summary ( cont ) : Moving to [LOC Chad  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] expressed concern about news that the government was demanding an end to the [MISC MINURCAT  ] peacekeeping mission by March 15 . 
He hoped an accommodation could be reached by renaming the mission or changing the mandate . 
On the [LOC Great Lakes Region  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] said that [LOC Paris  ] and [MISC Kigali  ] had resumed diplomatic relations . 
He concurred that [ORG MONUC  ] should not be terminated this year , as the [ORG DRC  ] wished . 
[PER Gompertz  ] alleged that Lord 's [ORG Resistance Army  ] leader [PER Joseph Kony  ] was in [LOC Khartoum  ] in late 2009 , according to sensitive reporting from the [MISC French  ] [ORG DGSE  ] . 
Finally , on [LOC Sahel  ] counter-terrorism issues , [PER Gompertz  ] said [LOC Algeria  ] was blocking the long-sought conference on coordinating counter-terrorism policy in the [LOC Sahel  ] . 
End Summary. --------------------------- [ORG Guinea: Progress  ] being made --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A/S [PER Carson  ] met with [MISC French  ] Africa Director [PER Stephane Gompertz  ] on January 30 on the sidelines of the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) [ORG Summit  ] in [LOC Addis Ababa  ] . 
[PER Carson  ] began by raising [LOC Guinea  ] , saying that [LOC Morocco  ] played a useful role , and things seem to be turning out well in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[MISC Burkinabe  ] President [PER Blaise Compaore  ] deserves much credit . 
Secretary [PER Clinton  ] was scheduled to call him and offer her thanks soon . 
[PER Gompertz  ] feels that [PER Compaore  ] wants to go slowly because he is concerned about supporters of coup leader [PER Dadis Camara  ] using force . 
[LOC Paris  ] wants [LOC Morocco  ] to continue to be at the center of resolution in [LOC Guinea  ] , but also does not want to exclude the [ORG Economic Community of West African States  ] ( [ORG ECOWAS  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Carson  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] will participate in the upcoming security sector assessment , and we are prepared to be financially supportive of these and other upcoming steps towards getting [LOC Guinea  ] back on its feet . 
He said we will fund elections via the [ORG International Foundation for Electoral Systems  ] ( [ORG IFES  ] ) and re-establish our substantial aid activities . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said [LOC France  ] will also resume , but not with any more money than before the coup . 
Principally , ADDIS ABAB 00000288 002.2 OF 004 [LOC France  ] will un-freeze the Conakry-Airport expressway project that it was funding. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the [LOC U.S.  ] has not passed any names to [MISC Guinean  ] officials about who would be " unacceptable " for office , the [MISC French  ] have suggested some members of the [ORG National Council for Democracy and Development  ] ( [ORG CNDD  ] ) who would be " toxic . 
" [PER Carson  ] believes that no military should take part in the transition election. ----------------------------------- [ORG Nigeria: Joint  ] statement a success ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both [PER Carson  ] and [PER Gompertz  ] felt the January 28 joint statement was a great success . 
[PER Carson  ] is pessimistic about the situation in [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
We thought ailing President [PER Yar'adua  ] was heading back to [LOC Abuja  ] last week , but our information turned out to be incorrect . 
Senior [MISC Nigerian  ] leadership are still engaged in self-deception , evidenced by the recent cabinet declaration that [PER Yar'adua  ] is " not incapable " of leading . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said former [MISC Nigerian  ] President [PER Obasanjo  ] is frustrated by his inability to influence the current situation , which he caused by selecting a sick [PER Yar'adua  ] as President in 2006 . 
[PER Carson  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] wants a stable transition without military involvement. ----- [LOC Niger  ] ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] is embarrassed by the situation in [LOC Niger  ] , created by [MISC Nigerien  ] President [PER Tandja  ] 's successful hijacking of the constitution for a third term in office . 
[PER Tandja  ] told [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] in MarchQQQ8'Ve 's inability to influence the situation , in part because the [MISC Nigerien  ] opposition is disorganized . 
According to [PER Gompertz  ] , the [MISC Nigerien  ] opposition regularly visits [LOC Paris  ] and tells of big plans to hold demonstrations and rallies , however , in the end these events never take place . 
He believes a military coup is possible , and understands from [ORG ECOWAS  ] that mediation is more or less dead. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Carson  ] responded that we had cut all non-humanitarian assistance , which was difficult since [LOC Niger  ] is an important actor on counter-terrorism . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said that [LOC France  ] does not intend to cut aid , even though his country 's assistance makes up nearly half of [LOC Niger  ] 's national budget , because he worries about destabilizing the country further . 
He lamented [ORG AU  ] rules , which prevented the [ORG AU  ] from taking automatic and decisive action on [LOC Niger  ] because the third term was via constitutional means. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gompertz  ] said he will try and see the [MISC Nigerien  ] Prime Minister soon ; according to him , the Foreign Minister is moderate but has no leverage . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said [ORG ECOWAS  ] was waiting because [LOC Nigeria  ] was paralyzed due to [PER Yar'adua  ] 's condition. ------------------------------ [ORG Madagascar: Agree  ] to disagree ------------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gompertz  ] raised the subject of [LOC Madagascar  ] by saying that this was " obviously a very embarrassing subject " for [LOC France  ] . 
He thought the [ORG Maputo I  ] and [LOC Addis Ababa  ] agreements were a good start , but that [ORG SADC  ] mediator [PER Chissano  ] blundered on [ORG Maputo III  ] by not having full participation by all parties . 
The recommendations were then presented as decisions , when all parties had not participated in the agreement . 
ADDIS ABAB 00000288 003.3 OF 004 <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , [PER Gompertz  ] said , coup leader [ORG Rajoelina  ] was also " stupid " and resorted to unilateral measures like canceling his acceptance of [LOC Maputo  ] I. [LOC France  ] thinks [ORG AU  ] Chairperson [PER Jean Ping  ] 's initiative is a good one , and said that former [MISC Mozambican  ] President [PER Joachim Chissano  ] was upset merely at [PER Ping  ] 's method -- not at the substance. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] said [ORG Rajoelina  ] visited [LOC Paris  ] recently and met with him and President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's [ORG Africa Advisor Joyandet  ] at the [LOC Elysee  ] . 
[PER Joyandet  ] told [ORG Rajoelina  ] that [PER Ping  ] 's proposal was the last deal , and that he cannot avoid the co-presidency . 
[ORG Rajoelina  ] had no substantive response . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said his information from [LOC Antananarivo  ] indicated that [ORG Rajoelina  ] would be unable to pay the army from March onwards. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Carson  ] said that we need to avoid having the mediation favor the " villain " in the situation -- coup leader [ORG Rajoelina  ] . 
We favor an inclusive , broad outcome with all political actors included . 
[PER Gompertz  ] responded by saying that this was the point of disagreement between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] -- for [LOC France  ] , they are all villains , none caring about the [MISC Malagasy  ] people. ------------- Chad/MINURCAT ------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Government of [LOC Chad  ] demands that the [ORG UN Mission  ] in the [LOC Central African Republic  ] and [LOC Chad  ] ( [ORG MINURCAT  ] ) leave [LOC Chad  ] by March 15 are unrealistic , said [PER Gompertz  ] . 
He noted that the [MISC Chadians  ] believe the mission has done nothing useful , has not built anything , and mostly stays at the airport . 
This is unlike the [ORG European Union Forces  ] ( [ORG EUFOR  ] ) mission , which [LOC Chad  ] thinks is a useful endeavor. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Carson  ] said it would be a disaster for [ORG MINURCAT  ] to leave prior to [LOC South Sudan  ] 's independence referendum in March 2011 , as we do not yet know if the vote will lead to instability along the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] border . 
[PER Gompertz  ] opined that if [MISC Chadian  ] President Deby sticks to the March 15 deadline , we should offer a face-saving device , like changing the mission 's name or mandate. ------------------ [LOC Great Lakes Region  ] ------------------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gompertz  ] relayed news that [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Kigali  ] recently resumed diplomatic relations . 
[MISC French  ] FM [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] visited [LOC Kigali  ] to mark the occasion . 
[MISC Rwandan  ] President [PER Kagame  ] stressed the need for investment and a fresh start . 
[PER Kouchner  ] was impressed by the new [MISC Rwandan  ] foreign minister . 
[MISC Rwandan  ] talks with [LOC Kinshasa  ] are going okay , but there is tension in civil society on the talks . 
This tension was explained to [PER Kouchner  ] by the Archbishop of [LOC Kigali  ] , who said " look , we had a genocide here . 
" <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] said [PER Kouchner  ] discussed the future of the [ORG UN Mission  ] in [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG MONUC  ] ) while in [LOC Kigali  ] , and everyone emphasized to him the need to train [MISC Rwandan  ] forces . 
[PER Carson  ] said we want to continue [ORG MONUC  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] wondered aloud if DRC President [PER Kabila  ] wanted to end [ORG MONUC  ] for domestic political reasons , or so that he could rig the elections . 
Special Advisor [PER Wolpe  ] responded that in his opinion it was for domestic political reasons only. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( S ) [PER Gompertz  ] said that the [MISC French  ] intelligence service had sensitive reporting which indicated that Lord 's [ORG Resistance Army  ] leader [PER Joseph Kony  ] was in [LOC Khartoum  ] six months ago . 
[PER Carson  ] said that if that were true it would be an enormous bad faith gesture by the [MISC Sudanese  ] government , and would show the north 's intention to tear apart the [MISC Southern  ] independence movement . 
It would mean that the north could not be trusted as an honest partner . 
[PER Carson  ] ADDIS ABAB 00000288 004.3 OF 004 said we needed to be 100 percent sure before we could act on that kind of information. ----------------------- [ORG Sahel Counter-terrorism  ] ----------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] thinks the security situation in the [ORG Sahel  ] remains fairly unchanged from the [LOC Paris  ] meetings on [ORG Sahel  ] counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) issues six months ago . 
He said [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] in the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Mahgreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) is expanding into northern [LOC Burkina Faso  ] and recruiting in [LOC Senegal  ] . 
The [ORG DGSE  ] believes [ORG AQIM  ] will find weakness in northern [LOC Nigeria.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] saw the [MISC Malian  ] Foreign Minister on January 29 . 
The FM regretted criticism leveled against his country for lack of action , and insisted steps were being taken against [ORG AQIM  ] . 
He said no one supports the [ORG Sahel CT  ] conference favored by the [LOC West  ] , and that [LOC Algeria  ] is actively blocking it . 
[PER Gompertz  ] added that in his view the [MISC Algerians  ] are dismissive of the problem and do not want to act . 
[PER Carson  ] said he was troubled by the lack of regional cooperation . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said that [ORG Sahel  ] issues were poorly understood in the [ORG EU  ] , and asked [PER Carson  ] to help him educate northern and eastern [ORG EU  ] member states on the [ORG AQIM  ] problem . 
He said that [LOC Lisbon  ] implementation made it even harder for the [ORG EU  ] to take a comprehensive look at the [LOC Sahel.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( U ) A/S [PER Carson  ] has not cleared this message .
