Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
Chief of Army Staff ( [ORG COAS  ] ) General [PER Ashfaq Kayani’s  ] February 20-27 visit to [LOC Washington  ] comes on the heels of the government’s loss of control over [ORG Swat  ] , continued [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Army/Frontier Corps  ] operations in the tribal areas , and still-simmering [MISC Indo-Pak  ] tensions in the wake of the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
We expect [PER Kayani  ] will request increased intelligence sharing ( real-time SIGINT and [ORG ISR  ] ) , help to modernize his helicopter fleet , increased support for civilian law enforcement , and financial compensation for [MISC Pakistanis  ] displaced by combat . 
He likely will complain about delays in [ORG Coalition Support Fund  ] payments , suggest that [LOC U.S.  ] policy on strikes in the tribal areas be amended , and request information about plans for a [LOC U.S.  ] troop surge in southern [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We should recognize growing [MISC Pakistani  ] casualties in the fight against militants , praise Kayani’s support for the civilian democratic government in [LOC Islamabad  ] , re-iterate the long-term [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to support [LOC Pakistan  ] , and thank him for agreeing to send his intelligence chief and director of military operations to the [MISC Holbrooke/Riedel U.S.-Pakistan  ] strategic review meeting in [LOC Washington  ] . 
We should also thank [PER Kayani  ] for the GOP’s effort to ensure that U.S./NATO continues to deliver fuel and dry goods through [LOC Pakistan  ] for our forces in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) But we need to lay down a clear marker that Pakistan’s Army/ISI must stop overt or tacit support for militant proxies ( [PER Haqqani  ] network , Commander [PER Nazir  ] , [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ) . 
We should preface that conversation with an agreement to open a new page in relations ; [PER Kayani  ] , who was [ORG ISI  ] Chief from 2004-2007 , does not want a reckoning with the past . 
Given the [MISC GOP  ] surrender of [ORG Swat  ] to local taliban , we need to press [PER Kayani  ] to commit his now reluctant Army to retake the area after the “peace deal” inevitably fails. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We should press for [MISC Pakistani  ] prosecution of the [LOC Mumbai  ] suspects , encourage expanded [ORG USG  ] training of Army and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] forces , raise the prospect of embedding [LOC U.S.  ] military observers/advisors with the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] , support a prioritized needs-based FMF request that builds COIN capability , ask [PER Kayani  ] to explain how [LOC Pakistan  ] plans to back [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to stabilize [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and probe for what [MISC Indian  ] action would allow him to redeploy troops from his eastern front to support increased combat in the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border area . 
Suggested talking points and bio are included at paras 28-30 . 
End Summary . 
Supporting [MISC Democratic  ] [ORG Governance  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The civilian government headed by Prime Minister [PER Yousaf Gilani  ] , elected one year ago , is now stable . 
President [PER Zardari’s  ] elected position is politically secure and [PER Gilani  ] has a majority in parliament . 
The [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) and its coalition allies rule in three of the four provinces and effectively control all three branches of federal government . 
Opposition leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is by far the most popular politician in [LOC Pakistan  ] ( with an 83% approval rating compared to [PER Zardari’s  ] 20% in the latest [ORG IRI  ] poll ) , but he does not have the votes to bring down the government. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] is cementing leadership alliances so he can avoid another election until he receives international assistance to address food and fuel inflation , electricity blackouts and high unemployment . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has met its first-quarter targets under a $6.7 billion [MISC IMF Standby Agreement  ] but the economy remains too weak to support the [MISC Pakistani  ] military’s appetite for expensive weapons systems ( particular F-16s ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) President [PER Zardari  ] and [PER Kayani  ] are the key decision-makers in [LOC Pakistan  ] ; they have developed a respectful if not entirely trusting working relationship . 
[PER Kayani  ] has gone out of his way to publicly defer to [PER Zardari  ] because he needs political support to wage successful military ISLAMABAD 00000365 002 OF 006 operations . 
After eight years of military rule under [MISC Musharraf  ] , [PER Zardari  ] is re-shaping civilian-military relations in the shadow of Pakistan’s history of repeated military coups . 
It is in [ORG USG  ] interests for the [MISC Zardari/Gilani  ] government to complete its full five-year term , and we should praise Kayani’s efforts to support civilian democracy. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] may advocate for pending legislation ( [MISC Kerry-Lugar  ] ) in the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congress  ] to triple non-military assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] and robust [ORG USG  ] support for an [ORG IMF/World Bank Donors’ Conference  ] to provide $4 billion in social safety net programs to compensate for [MISC IMF-imposed  ] budget cuts . 
We anticipate that Special Representative [PER Holbrooke  ] will attend a [ORG Donors’ Conference  ] in April . 
[PER Kayani  ] may request additional [LOC U.S.  ] support for civilian law enforcement ; in addition to the over $40 million of equipment and training delivered to the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] , we are providing $15 million in additional equipment for the [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) police and are working to re-program another $55 million in FY2009 . 
There is a FY2009 supplemental request pending for another $95 million for the police. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] will request cash to assist more than 300,000 internally displaced persons ( [ORG IDPs  ] ) who have fled fighting in the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) and [ORG Swat  ] , [ORG NWFP  ] . 
Through USAID , State/PRM and [ORG DOD  ] , we already have provided over $10 million in assistance and are preparing to respond to new [ORG UNHCR/ICRC/World Food Program  ] appeals for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Of particular interest will be [LOC U.S.  ] plans to continue/expand the delivery of $2 million in ( [MISC CERP-like  ] ) assistance from [ORG DOD  ] through the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] to [ORG IDPs  ] in support of Kayani’s counter-insurgency strategy. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Security concerns are limiting our ability to operate , but today USAID contractors are building schools and wells , hiring workers for short-term jobs , training teachers and increasing the capacity of the [ORG FATA Secretariat  ] to deliver services that demonstrate the writ of government in [LOC FATA  ] . 
The [MISC Big Strategic Questions  ] --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zardari  ] and [PER Gilani  ] agree that Pakistan’s biggest threat comes from a growing militant insurgency on the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border . 
The military and [ORG ISI  ] have not yet made that leap ; they still view [LOC India  ] as their principle threat and [LOC Afghanistan  ] as strategic depth in a possible conflict with [LOC India  ] . 
They continue to provide overt or tacit support for proxy forces ( including the [PER Haqqani  ] group , Commander [PER Nazir  ] , [PER Gulbaddin Hekmatyar  ] , and [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ) as a foreign policy tool. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The single biggest message [PER Kayani  ] should hear in [LOC Washington  ] is that this support must end . 
It is now counterproductive to Pakistan’s own interests and directly conflicts with [ORG USG  ] objectives in Afghanistan--where [PER Haqqani  ] is killing [MISC American  ] soldiers and [MISC Afghan  ] civilians--and the region--where [LOC Mumbai  ] exposed the fruits of previous [ORG ISI  ] policy to create [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] and still threatens potential conflict between nuclear powers. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] will want to hear that the [LOC U.S.  ] has turned the page on past [ORG ISI  ] operations ( he was [ORG ISI  ] chief from 2004-2007 ) . 
We should ask for his views on what political end state in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would convince him to end proxy support for militants and probe for what would be required by [LOC India  ] to allow him to redeploy forces from the [MISC Indian  ] border for the fight in [LOC FATA  ] . 
The reality is that , without a redeployment , he does not have the forces ( however poorly trained ) to combat the insurgency in [LOC FATA  ] . 
[MISC Pakistani  ] Will . 
. . . --------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The good news is that the [ORG Army/Frontier Corps  ] are engaged in combat in [LOC Bajaur  ] and [LOC Mohmand  ] , [LOC FATA  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] is committed to the fight ; he knows that [PER Osama bin Laden  ] has publicly targeted [LOC Pakistan  ] and admits “the militants are [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000365 003 OF 006 after me and my job.” The bad news is that the militants increasingly are setting the agenda. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The government’s anti-terrorism strategy is based on “dialogue , deterrence and development ; ” however , it lacks the military capacity to deter militants and the financial resources to develop the [LOC FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] . 
Its historic fallback has been to play for time by conducting negotiations with militants , a disastrous tactic that only has made the extremists stronger . 
The government insists it will negotiate with tribal leaders but not with militants. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) However , in the latest agreement in [ORG Swat  ] ( once a tourist resort approximately 90 miles from [LOC Islamabad  ] ) , the provincial government agreed to negotiate for peace in exchange for imposition of [ORG Shari’a  ] law with the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
This was recognition of de-facto [ORG Taliban  ] control , which produced beheadings , closure of girls’ schools , a growing exodus of terrified citizens , and the desertion of outgunned and outmanned police . 
Ham-handed military tactics , which included indiscriminate artillery bombardment , have further alienated a population that simply wants the fighting to end . 
Under international pressure , [PER Zardari  ] has not yet signed off on the deal pending assurances it really will deliver peace ; a similar negotiation in 2008 failed. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] , who supported the [ORG Swat  ] deal , will argue that he does not have the forces to battle on multiple fronts , so he is picking his battles and negotiating to preserve later options . 
We should push back hard , noting that it will be difficult for international donors to support a government that is not prepared to go all-out to defend its own territory . 
. . .vs Capability ------------------ <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Now absorbing combat losses against formidable militants , [ORG Pakistan’s Frontier Corps  ] ( [ORG FC  ] ) and military finally have begun to accept more [ORG USG  ] training and assistance in support of counter-insurgency ( COIN ) . 
[PER Kayani  ] will appreciate [LOC U.S.  ] recognition of the casualties his men have suffered , and this is an opening we should exploit to press for expanded [ORG FC  ] and special forces ( SSG ) training . 
[PER Kayani  ] remains leery of too large a [ORG USG  ] military footprint in [LOC Pakistan  ] , but to win he must be able to fight without creating the level of civilian casualties his forces’ blind artillery and [MISC F-16  ] bombardments are now producing . 
We are responding to [LOC Pakistan  ] Air Force requests for Close Air Support training to improve the precision of F-16s they are using in [LOC FATA  ] . 
We should probe for the possible introduction of [LOC U.S.  ] military observers/advisors to improve the COIN capability of this 1940’s force. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] will repeat his requests for increased intelligence sharing , notably SIGINT , in support of ongoing military operations in [LOC FATA  ] . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has agreed to build additional tripartite [ORG Border Coordination Centers  ] ( [ORG BCCs  ] ) , and this month we will expand real-time tactical/target-focused intelligence sharing through the [LOC Torkham  ] [ORG BCC  ] . 
We continue to work on delivering Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ( [ORG ISR  ] ) aerial capability ( two [MISC B350-ERs  ] ) that [PER Kayani  ] has raised with all his high-level visitors. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The [PER Bush  ] administration’s commitment to provide [LOC Pakistan  ] with $300 million annually in [LOC FMF  ] expires in 2009 , and we need to come to agreement with [LOC Pakistan  ] on how to restructure its [LOC FMF  ] program to meet its long-term COIN needs . 
The [LOC Pakistan  ] military has requested $1B per year for five years ( FY10-14 ) in [LOC FMF.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Kayani  ] may request additional [LOC U.S.  ] support for Pakistan’s [MISC F-16  ] program , the flagship symbol of post-9/11 re-engagement . 
We are about to send to [ORG Congress  ] notification for an additional $142 million in [LOC FMF  ] support for one part of this complex program . 
But we do not believe [LOC Pakistan  ] can afford to complete a $2 billion plus program to buy 18 new F-16s , upgrade 35 older aircraft , upgrade a new base , and fund a munitions package . 
Given the funding and production [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000365 004 OF 006 line implications of either bailing out the [MISC GOP  ] or canceling the program , [LOC U.S.  ] agencies are reviewing our options. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) We could not agree more with [PER Kayani  ] on the need to modernize [MISC Pakistan’s  ] helicopter fleet ; on any given day , they have perhaps 2-3 attack helos flying in support of COIN operations . 
We now are delivering spare parts for their [MISC Cobra  ] and [PER Bell 412s  ] , overhauling and upgrading their [MISC MI-17s  ] , and assessing ways to improve overall helicopter maintenance . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Strikes ------------ <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As recent media reports indicate , the [LOC U.S.  ] has eliminated 10 of the top 20 al-Qaida operatives in [LOC Pakistan  ] over the last year . 
However , the strikes have put increasing political pressure on the [MISC Pakistani  ] government , which has struggled to explain why it is allowing an ally to violate its sovereignty . 
The [MISC GOP  ] so far has denied recent media reports alleging that the [LOC U.S.  ] is launching the strikes from bases in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] knows full well that the strikes have been precise ( creating few civilian casualties ) and targeted primarily at foreign fighters in the [MISC Waziristans  ] . 
He will argue , however , that they undermine his campaign plan , which is to keep the [MISC Waziristans  ] quiet until the Army is capable of attacking [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] and other militants entrenched there . 
In recent meetings with Special Representative [PER Holbrooke  ] , a variety of [MISC Pakistani  ] interlocutors ( and now the press ) suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] work jointly with [LOC Pakistan  ] and target [PER Mehsud  ] or other militants who are killing [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) Pakistan-NATO/Afghan cooperation and coordination across the border has improved dramatically in recent months . 
This includes exchanges of tactical intelligence that allows [ORG NATO  ] forces to block passes in support of [MISC Pakistani  ] operations and has helped lower attacks on [MISC U.S./NATO  ] forces . 
In recent meetings with ISAF Commander [PER McKiernan  ] , [PER Kayani  ] raised concern about the effect of a [LOC U.S.  ] troop build-up in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which could push militants and refugees across the border into [LOC Balochistan  ] and prompt an influx of foreign fighters . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] currently has only one Army brigade and perhaps 15 [ORG Frontier Corps  ] wings stationed along the vast and largely unpopulated [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border in [LOC Balochistan.  ] <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Following embarrassing militant attacks on [MISC U.S./NATO  ] convoys last year , [LOC Pakistan  ] has made efforts to secure Khyber [PER Agency/Torkham Gate  ] , through which [MISC U.S./NATO  ] trucks deliver 30% of the fuel and 80% of the dry goods for our forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The troop surge will require us to send additional supplies through the [LOC Chaman  ] ( [LOC Balochistan  ] ) border crossing in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; CENTCOM is now evaluating ways to improve delivery of supplies through [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] ----- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) Indo-Pak tensions are still simmering , but to avoid a potential [MISC Indian  ] military strike , the [MISC GOP  ] needs to continue to show progress on prosecuting those [PER Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ( LeT ) operatives responsible for the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
[LOC India  ] has welcomed the [MISC GOP  ] decision to file formal charges against the key masterminds of [LOC Mumbai  ] ; [LOC Islamabad  ] now awaits an [MISC Indian  ] response to requests for additional information ( forensics , ballistics reports , etc ) from [LOC New Delhi  ] to support prosecution . 
Nukes ----- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Although he has remained silent on the subject , [PER Kayani  ] does not support Zardari’s statement last year to the [MISC Indian  ] press that [LOC Pakistan  ] would adopt a “no first use” policy on nuclear weapons . 
Despite increasing financial constraints , we believe that the military is proceeding with [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000365 005 OF 006 an expansion of both its growing strategic weapons and missile programs . 
Pakistan’s strategic assets are under the control of the secular military , which has implemented extensive physical , personnel and command and control safeguards . 
Our major concern has not been that an [MISC Islamic  ] militant could steal an entire weapon but rather the chance someone working in [MISC GOP  ] facilities could gradually smuggle enough fissile material out to eventually make a weapon and the vulnerability of weapons in transit . 
Despite a court decision to “free” nuclear proliferator [PER A.Q. Khan  ] , the [MISC GOP  ] continues to assure us he remains under significant travel and media restrictions. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) Suggested Talking Points: -- ( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) What is in the past is behind us . 
What we seek going forward is an all-encompassing bilateral relationship based on what we can accomplish for the future . 
We recognize your sacrifices and are well-aware of the trust-deficit that exists on each side . 
We must both work to overcome it. -- ( [PER C/Rel Pak  ] ) We appreciate your efforts to support stable civilian democracy in [LOC Pakistan  ] and are working to provide a democracy dividend that improves both economic conditions and the law and order situation. -- ( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) We must succeed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
What is your vision for what constitutes an acceptable outcome ? -- ( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) We want more [MISC Pakistani  ] forces deployed to the western border to fight the militants . 
What conditions are necessary for you to reposition forces from the eastern to the western border ? -- ( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) It is time to cut your ties to extremist groups/proxy forces and urge the permanent severing of ties . 
Such ties hinder trust and our ability to move forward together. -- ( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) Our security relationship must move beyond the provision of equipment , and we seek opportunities to expand training throughout the military. -- ( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) Our ability to deliver sustained security assistance also depends on the [ORG Administration securing Congressional  ] approval . 
[ORG Congress  ] is likely to prioritize assistance to counterinsurgency-related equipment and training , as well as align its support with [MISC Pakistani  ] performance in the field. -- ( [PER S/Rel Pak  ] ) Strikes in the [LOC FATA  ] are succeeding in eliminating the enemy senior leadership and collateral damage has been minimal . 
We are working to provide you with tactical battlefield intelligence to support your operations in [LOC FATA  ] .
