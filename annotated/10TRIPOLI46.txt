( C ) On January 18 , per instruction reftel , the Ambassador , accompanied by [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Fean  ] and [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador Chamov presented a joint demarche on the [MISC Libyan  ] proposal to amend the [MISC Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) to [MISC Libyan  ] MFA Under Secretary [PER Abdulathi Obeidi  ] , MFA/IO Chief [PER Mehdi al-Mjribi  ] and Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , Head of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Atomic Energy Establishment  ] . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] led off by explaining that the genesis of their proposal was the special [ORG UN Security Council  ] session on nonproliferation that had been chaired this past fall by President [PER Obama  ] . 
POTUS' statements and passion on the subject , in conjunction with [MISC Libyan  ] ( and other [MISC Non-Aligned Movement  ] members' ) long-held sentiment that the [ORG NPT  ] had been a discriminatory document monopolized by the nuclear powers , and that there had been a lack of seriousness by those powers to move toward a de-nuclearized world , had compelled the [MISC Libyans  ] to act . 
There was also a continuing concern , said [PER Obeidi  ] , that countries like [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , located in volatile regions , were increasingly threatening international security with their nuclear arsenals . 
[LOC Libya  ] , he argued , was best-placed to take this initiative given that it served as a model for those countries that wanted to give up their [ORG WMD  ] capability. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) By agreement with his colleagues , the Ambassador read the demarche and clarified the meaning of several points for the [MISC Libyans  ] . 
Our trio reiterated several times that the joint position was not necessarily a rejection of the [MISC Libyan  ] ideas ; rather , our opposition was to [LOC Libya  ] 's request to circulate the proposals , which would inevitably open up the [ORG NPT  ] to other potentially unhelpful amendments by others . 
The [ORG NPT  ] had withstood any amendment process for 40 years , and its integrity needed to be upheld . 
We also argued that the upcoming [ORG Review Conference  ] would be focusing on difficult issues and the work needed to deal with those issues could be placed in jeopardy if the participants had to be diverted to deal with the issue of amendments . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] asked several times if , despite their opposition , the [ORG NPT Depositary States  ] were still willing to circulate the proposal if that is what the [MISC Libyans  ] decided . 
We replied that that was indeed the case. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) After some further discussion , it was clear that the [MISC Libyans  ] were intrigued by the point that we would deal seriously with their concerns at the May conference if they agreed to not circulate the current amendment proposal . 
They were concerned , however , that the agenda had already been set . 
They could consider withdrawing their proposal if they could receive some ironclad guarantees that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC UK  ] could find a mechanism to ensure that their concerns were discussed and take the lead in encouraging such a discussion . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] did not want to be put in a position of yielding on their current initiative and then having their concerns dismissed by technicalities at the conference . 
If the [ORG Depositary States  ] could assure them on this count , they would take the proposal to their leadership . 
5 . 
( C ) We agreed to bring this option to our capitals and to get back to the [MISC Libyans  ] when we had a definitive answer . 
6 . 
( C ) Action request: That Department , working with USUN , [LOC Moscow  ] and [LOC London  ] , prepare a response to the [MISC Libyans  ] that would enable them to cease current efforts to circulate proposals to amend the [ORG NPT  ] .
