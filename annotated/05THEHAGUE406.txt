<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 000406 SIPDIS TO THE SECRETARY FROM AMBASSADOR SOBEL E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 02/10/2025 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/NL_0.html'>NL</a> <a href='/tag/EUN_0.html'>EUN</a> <a href='/tag/NATO_0.html'>NATO</a> SUBJECT: YOUR MEETING WITH [MISC DUTCH  ] FOREIGN MINISTER [PER BOT  ] REF: THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 3350 ( 2004 ) Classified By: AMBASSADOR CLIFFORD SOBEL FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . 
Madame Secretary: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Bot  ] requested this meeting to discuss a wide range of [MISC U.S.-EU  ] issues prior to the President 's visit to [LOC Europe  ] . 
A former [MISC Dutch  ] permrep to the [ORG EU  ] with a pro-European reputation , [PER Bot  ] 's appreciation of the transatlantic relationship appears to have deepened and strengthened during the six months of the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
On several key issues -- e.g . 
[LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] -- [PER Bot  ] leveraged his understanding of [MISC European  ] politics and institutions to advance a solidly transatlantic agenda . 
His candid assessments of internal [MISC European  ] decision-making at critical moments also proved invaluable . 
[PER Bot  ] very much wants to remain a player , and is seeking to stake out a clear role for the [MISC Dutch  ] ( and for himself ) in the post-Presidency environment . 
Although we have had our recent -- over the [MISC Dutch  ] withdrawal from al-Muthanna , for example -- this meeting provides an excellent opportunity to take advantage of [PER Bot  ] 's credibility and experience to refine our message to [LOC Europe  ] , while encouraging [PER Bot  ] to assume a more active leadership role in key areas . 
IRAQ: ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] personally made [LOC Iraq  ] a high priority during the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
He should continue to press the [ORG EU  ] from within to assume greater responsibilities in [LOC Iraq  ] , and to move quickly to establish a physical presence on the ground in particular . 
The decision -- which [PER Bot  ] fought in cabinet -- to withdraw the [MISC Dutch  ] bilateral military presence from al-Muthanna next month is unfortunately irreversible . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] were among the first , however , to commit personnel to the first phase of the [ORG NATO  ] training mission and have indicated a willingness to provide up to 100 in later phases -- with the caveat that they expect other partners to provide similar numbers . 
It would be useful to remind [PER Bot  ] that while we appreciate [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to press allies to be more forthcoming , basing [MISC Dutch  ] contributions on strict definitions of proportionality would be counterproductive. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] have never ruled out additional missions in [LOC Iraq  ] , and [PER Bot  ] in particular may be receptive to ideas for how the [MISC Dutch  ] could fill important niches For example , The [MISC Dutch  ] could be asked to consider expanding bilateral support to [MISC Iraqi  ] institutions such as the [ORG Ministries of Foreign Affairs  ] ( the [MISC Dutch  ] are currently training one class of junior [MISC Iraqi  ] diplomats in the [ORG Hague  ] ) and [ORG Justice  ] ( the [MISC Dutch  ] last year hosted a successful conference of [MISC Iraqi  ] jurists in The [ORG Hague  ] ) or to sponsor specific reconstruction and development projects in the al-Muthanna area to take advantage of existing links to the local community . 
[LOC CHINA  ] ARMS EMBARGO: ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] started the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency resigned to lifting the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo , but ended it determined to prevent a lift on his watch . 
He can continue to provide useful insights into how the issue is being handled within [ORG EU  ] circles , and should be pushed to keep the [ORG EU  ] focused on its commitment -- which the [MISC Dutch  ] insisted on inserting into the December 17 Council declaration -- not to increase sales to [LOC China  ] in quantity or quality . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have made clear that they will take their lead on this issue from the [MISC British  ] , and that they will not stand alone to prevent a lift , but they may be able to help us find and exploit potential cracks in the [ORG EU  ] 's consensus . 
[PER Bot  ] should also be left with no illusions about the likely consequences of a lift , including potential complications in [MISC U.S.-European  ] defense trade . 
CUBA: ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] continue to represent the [ORG EU  ] Presidency in [LOC Havana  ] ( since [LOC Luxembourg  ] has no mission there ) and have deep concerns about the human rights situation there . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have so far not been as active as the [MISC Czechs  ] or [MISC Poles  ] in pressing the [ORG EU  ] to maintain contacts with dissidents as it improves relations with [LOC Havana  ] ; [PER Bot  ] could and should do more in this area . 
For example , he could instruct the [ORG Dutch Embassy  ] in [LOC Havana  ] to respond positively to our request that [LOC US  ] representatives be invited to the monthly coordination meetings on human rights held by [ORG EU  ] missions in [LOC Havana  ] . 
TURKEY/CYPRUS: ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As a former Ambassador to [LOC Turkey  ] , and the man under whose watch the [LOC Turks  ] finally got a date to begin accession talks , [PER Bot  ] has a personal interest in facilitating [LOC Turkey  ] 's bid to accede to the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] MFA plans to establish a regular bilateral forum for discussing [ORG EU  ] accession issues with [LOC Turkey  ] along the lines of their previous successful relationship with [LOC Poland  ] ; this relationship may prove useful in identifying and resolving problems ad October 3 approaches . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] can also provide useful insights into [ORG EU  ] thinking regarding [LOC Cyprus  ] , and are keenly aware that a failure to resolve the current impasse over Berlin-plus has serious implications for [ORG NATO  ] . 
ICC/SUDAN: --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We will have little success convincing [PER Bot  ] to break from [ORG EU  ] consensus to support an [ORG AU/UN  ] tribunal on [LOC Darfur  ] as long as the [ORG ICC  ] remains an option in [MISC European  ] eyes ; as the host of the [ORG ICC  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] are uniquely committed to seeing it succeed . 
We can , however , ask [PER Bot  ] to tone down the rhetoric and activities of [MISC Dutch  ] representatives in [LOC New York  ] , [LOC Brussels  ] , and elsewhere opposing alternatives to the [ORG ICC  ] . 
As a pragmatist , [PER Bot  ] should understand that a public spat over this issue does nothing either to promote the transatlantic agenda or to bring the perpetrators to justice . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] , and [PER Bot  ] personally , have been heavily involved in [LOC Darfur  ] ( the [MISC Dutch  ] , for example , paid over half of the [ORG EU  ] 's contribution to the [ORG AU  ] mission ) and do not want to jeopardize a potential resolution over technicalities . 
AFGHANISTAN: ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In the debate over the al-Muthanna withdrawal , the [MISC Dutch  ] government cited commitments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- including a possible deployment of special forces to [ORG OEF  ] and heading up a new PRT in phase III -- as one reason for leaving [LOC Iraq  ] . 
These commitments are substantial , useful , and appropriate , but you may want to set down a marker that they should not be used to justify seen as substitutes for contributions in [LOC Iraq  ] -- both are high priorities . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have also recently expressed public interest in deploying the [MISC Dutch  ] battalion of the [LOC SRF  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to support upcoming elections , but have balked at deploying the more substantial [MISC Dutch  ] NRF forces ( approximately 4,000 troops . 
) [ORG NATO  ] has not yet determined which force , if either , should be deployed for this mission , but [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to predetermine the outcome are not helpful . 
[ORG MIDDLE EAST:  ] ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Last November , [PER Bot  ] was eager to transform his successful hosting of the [MISC EUROMED  ] conference in the [ORG Hague  ] into a a prominent role in the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
So far , however , he has been unable to carve out an appropriate role for himself or the [LOC Netherlands  ] either within the [ORG EU  ] or bilaterally . 
[PER Bot  ] correctly judges that there is broad public support ( including from the main opposition parties in parliament ) for increased engagement in the [LOC Middle East  ] , but he will not insert himself into the process without being asked . 
AFRICA: ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Already heavily involved in [LOC Africa  ] -- the [MISC Dutch  ] are the fourth largest donor of aid to the continent -- [PER Bot  ] is under constant pressure from the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament ( and [MISC Dutch  ] development minister [PER Agnes van Ardenne  ] ) to do more . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] uniquely include a major focus on peace and security in their [MISC African  ] development policy , and have expressed interest in greater coordination with the [LOC U.S.  ] , especially in the [LOC Horn  ] and [LOC Great Lakes  ] Regions . 
In fleshing out possible areas of increased cooperation in [LOC Africa  ] , we should remain cognizant of the fact that [MISC African  ] initiatives have sometimes been portrayed as alternatives to missions in [LOC Iraq  ] or [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; we will need to make clear in any discussion where our top priorities lie . 
BOTTOM LINE: ----------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] 's experience and credibility make him a useful [MISC European  ] interlocutor and an effective advocate for the transatlantic agenda . 
During the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency , he repeatedly demonstrated a talent for translating transatlantic objectives into the language of [LOC Europeanism  ] , and for discreetly managing difficult issues ( such as [LOC Turkey  ] or [LOC China  ] ) to successful conclusions . 
It would be in our interest to find creative ways to harness his skills as a coalition builder and his newly-deepened transatlantic orientation in the post-presidency environment as well. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) One final point you may want to stress in your discussion is that the concept of proportionality creeping into many [MISC Dutch  ] debates ( on [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , for example ) is misguided . 
The value we place on our partnership is not based on whether or not the [MISC Dutch  ] contribute their fair share to any given operation , but rather reflects the trust developed over a long history in which each side demonstrated its willingness to do whatever was needed to achieve shared objectives .
