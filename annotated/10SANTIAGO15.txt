[ORG Bolivia: More Moderate  ] than Many Realize --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Consolidating the worldwide sense of hope inspired by President [PER Obama  ] will be the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's big challenge going forward , President [PER Bachelet  ] told [ORG A/S Valenzuela  ] . 
Some leaders , including [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [PER Evo Morales  ] get caught in a trap of opposing individual [LOC U.S.  ] officials and agencies . 
Similarly , there are many moderates in [LOC Bolivia  ] , she said , implying that some in the [LOC U.S.  ] don't realize this . 
[PER Bachelet  ] cautioned against lumping all of [LOC Latin America  ] 's populist-leaning leaders together , emphasizing that [PER Morales  ] was very different from [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , and that [PER Morales  ] had been fairly elected . 
Foreign Minister [PER Fernandez  ] and Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Flisfisch  ] added that [ORG Morales' MAS  ] party was likely to do well in April 's local elections , further consolidating [ORG Morales'  ] power. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bachelet  ] had high praise for [MISC Bolivian  ] Foreign Minister [PER David Choquehuanca  ] , who she said is more sophisticated than some other [MISC Bolivian  ] leaders , and is " serene and capable . 
" Cultural differences are important in understanding [LOC Bolivia  ] and its leaders , [PER Bachelet  ] emphasized , saying that while she had discussed economic growth with [PER Choquehuanca  ] , he has a different mindset and is more focused on quality of life than economic development for its own sake . 
[MISC Argentina:  ] A Challenged Country with an Unsteady President --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bachelet  ] was frank about her view of [LOC Argentina  ] , saying that [LOC Chile  ] 's neighbor has problems with credibility as a country -- its democracy is not robust , and its institutions are not strong . 
[PER Flisfisch  ] added that [LOC Argentina  ] 's unusual federal system and Peronist ideology--which can lead to political paranoia--are additional obstacles to political and economic stability . 
Argentines tend to live from crisis to crisis , the President added , rather than pursuing stable , long-term policies. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] is emblematic of [LOC Argentina  ] 's problems , the [MISC Chileans  ] agreed . 
[PER Kirchner  ] is not anti-U.S. by nature , [PER Bachelet  ] asserted , but is convinced that the 2007 " maletinazo " incident was a plot against her and will not listen to contradictory evidence . 
( Note: " Maletinazo " refers to an incident in which [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials found nearly [LOC US  ] $800,000 in cash the suitcase of a [LOC U.S.  ] citizen at a [LOC Buenos Aires  ] airport . 
[ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000015 002 OF 002 A [LOC U.S.  ] assistant attorney alleged that the money was illegal contributions for [PER Kirchner  ] 's campaign . 
End Note . 
) In general , [PER Kirchner  ] is prone to believing rumors and scurrilous press articles and has a tendency to make unfortunate public comments , [PER Bachelet  ] noted , recalling [PER Kirchner  ] 's negative comments after [ORG A/S Valenzuela  ] 's recent trip to that country. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) President [PER Bachelet  ] highlighted that [LOC Chile  ] had achieved a very positive relationship with [LOC Argentina  ] despite the challenging political situation there and [PER Kirchner  ] 's shortcomings . 
[LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] have a number of bilateral agreements in place and during [PER Kirchner  ] 's October visit to [ORG Santiago  ] the two presidents shared the now-famous " [MISC Maipu  ] hug " after recalling the historic friendship and heroism of both countries . 
Brazil: Presidential Candidates Can't Hold a Candle to [PER Lula  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Describing [PER Lula  ] as a " political fox , " President [PER Bachelet  ] asserted that [LOC Brazil  ] does not play a major role in most regional issues , despite press reports that consistently portray the country as an important regional mediator . 
[PER Bachelet  ] views [LOC Brazil  ] as more interested in playing on the world stage on issues including climate change and nuclear non-proliferation . 
On the other hand , [LOC Brazil  ] has consistently been a good ally to [LOC Chile  ] , she asserted , describing President [PER Lula  ] as intelligent and charming . 
[PER Bachelet  ] also offered her opinion of the leading [MISC Brazilian  ] presidential candidates , neither of whom she believes share [PER Lula  ] 's outstanding qualities . 
She described opposition candidate [PER Jose Serra  ] as arrogant and [PER Lula  ] 's favorite , cabinet chief [PER Dilma Roussef  ] , as distant and formal . 
[LOC Chile  ] 's Presidential Election: Worries about a [ORG Pinera Presidency and Press Bias  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Chile  ] 's fast-approaching presidential election , [PER Bachelet  ] proffered the widely-held belief that there is general agreement about policy among the leading candidates , and so the candidates' behavior and personalities are more important than policy differences . 
Nonetheless , she said that she was worried about a potential [MISC Pinera  ] presidency , particularly because it would create a tremendous concentration of power ( Note: [MISC Pinera  ] is a wealthy businessman and a number of his key advisors will likely come from the business community . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Bachelet  ] expressed frustration over the [MISC Chilean  ] press' sensationalism and anti-Concertacion bias . 
Every time the [PER Frei  ] campaign raises questions about conflict of interest questions surrounding [MISC Pinera  ] 's very large stock portfolio , the effort is painted as a " dirty war " by the largely right-leaning press , which tends to ignore the right 's missteps. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Assistant Secretary cleared this cable .
