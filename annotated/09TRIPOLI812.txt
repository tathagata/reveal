REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) On October 7 , a [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MiG-23  ] fighter jet crashed during a demonstration flight at the third annual [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Aviation Expo  ] ( [ORG LAVEX  ] ) . 
According to a [MISC British  ] businessman attending the expo at [LOC Mitiga Airbase  ] ( a [MISC Libyan  ] military facility , and former [LOC U.S.  ] airbase ) , the aircraft was performing its maneuvers and then suddenly plunged to the ground . 
It was flying so low to the ground that the two pilots had no time to eject . 
The cause of the crash is unknown but , according to our contacts , the jet was " very old . 
" Some believe it may simply have run out of fuel . 
After the crash , which occurred in the late morning , all other demonstration flights were cancelled . 
2 . 
( C ) The aircraft crashed into a residential area about two kilometers from observation platforms at [ORG LAVEX  ] . 
The official [MISC Libyan  ] press agency reported that three people on the ground were wounded . 
Highlighting the lack of credibility that governmental news sources have with normal [MISC Libyans  ] , rumors are circulating throughout [LOC Tripoli  ] that the government is not reporting the true casualities , and that actually , between one to twelve [MISC Libyans  ] were killed . 
A military protocol official told us that the jet hit a house that was under construction , wounding three workers . 
A cellphone video of the crash scene posted on [ORG YouTube  ] , shows a mass of people gathered around a mass of rubble with no apparent emergency personnel on site . 
3 . 
( C ) Comment: At the expo , [LOC Libya  ] 's aging air force - which is only slowly recovering from years of unreliable maintenance and lack of spare-parts when [LOC Libya  ] was under international sanctions - was on full display . 
The crash of the jet tragically highlighted the weaknesses of [LOC Libya  ] 's military airfleet . 
Despite [LOC Libya  ] 's obvious need to procure new planes internationally , our contacts report that many high-level foreign delegations to [ORG LAVEX  ] , including the Chief of Staff of the [LOC French Air Force  ] , were unable to secure meetings with senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials , presumably since during the expo , most of the government was summoned to the southern oasis town of [LOC Sebha  ] for festivities marking the 50th anniversary of the Free Officer Movement ( reftel ) . 
This is yet another demonstration of how business in [LOC Libya  ] is subject to the whims of its unpredictable leader .
