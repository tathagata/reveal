Summary: As countries worldwide search for alternatives to increasingly expensive petroleum , not to mention green fuel alternatives that help meet [MISC Kyoto Protocol  ] targets , [LOC Brazil  ] finds itself in an enviable position . 
The world 's largest producer of both ethanol and sugar is the purveyor of technology , infrastructure and processes that could help fuel a biofuel revolution . 
In fact , [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol program is so successful it has drawn the likes of [PER Bill Gates  ] and [ORG Google  ] 's founders , [PER Sergey Brin  ] and [PER Larry Page  ] , into the fray , promoting expanded ethanol production in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Yet , despite the monumental success of ethanol in [LOC Brazil  ] , it is not happening without some growing pains. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[LOC Brazil  ] now finds itself in the unforeseen position of not having enough supply to satisfy demand . 
The unanticipated flex-fuel boom in [LOC Brazil  ] coupled with increasing international demand for ethanol is exerting serious pressure on [LOC Brazil  ] 's domestic production apparatus . 
Sales of flex-fuel cars reached approximately 80% of new vehicle sales in 2005 . 
The resulting increase in demand for ethanol necessarily led to price increases . 
Moreover , ethanol exports increased by 1.8 billion liters in 2005 ( a 269% jump over 2004 ) . 
This facet of increased demand is compounded by the fact that foreign importers are offering a price 8-10% higher than [LOC Brazil  ] 's internal market . 
During the current interharvest period supplies are limited and prices have skyrocketed , leaving [MISC Brazilian  ] consumers and officials with little hope for price reductions until production renews at the end of April . 
Taken as an omen , one of the most pressing questions facing [LOC Brazil  ] is how to create an infrastructure which can deal with the escalated demand for ethanol . 
End Summary <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The question of how [LOC Brazil  ] intends to address this supply and demand issue is still up for debate . 
In conversations with [PER Scioff  ] , [PER Angelo Bressan  ] , Director of the [ORG Ministry of Agricultures  ] sugar/alcohol division , noted that the [ORG GoB  ] has only two ways to regulate ethanol . 
The first involves adjusting the requisite amount of ethanol to be mixed in gasoline . 
The [ORG GoB  ] recently utilized this approach dropping the percentage from 25 to 20% . 
( reftel ) Although this measure increased supply , it had little to no effect on prices . 
A second option would be to regulate ethanol exports by , for example , linking exports to domestic stocks via a system of quotas , but leaving prices free . 
This argument has been negatively received both by industry and free market advocates within the [ORG GoB  ] . 
[ORG Unica  ] ( the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Sugarcane [ORG Industry Association  ] ) believes that this mechanism would not be able to function without government interference in pricing . 
[PER Bressan  ] noted that the [ORG GoB  ] and industry have had an open dialogue focusing on how to address the problem of supply but without any decisive outcomes as of yet. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The sugar/alcohol industry , for its part , is looking to expand both the area of planted cane and the industry 's capacity to refine it . 
Preliminary estimates are that [MISC US$  ] 14 billion is going to be invested into refineries that can crush and produce sugar/alcohol by 2011 . 
Meanwhile , another [MISC US$  ] 7 billion is being invested into expanding cultivated land . 
[PER Bressan  ] added that 11 new refineries are already under construction with an additional 16 planned for 2007 . 
That said , the analgesic effects of these investments are still some years away . 
Because it is not cost-effective to transport cane long distances , refineries and agricultural lands must remain in close proximity . 
Once a distillery is completed , there will still be a 12-15 month lag time ( the crop cycle for cane ) before production commences . 
Moreover , the upward swoop of land prices in cane producing regions ( 49% over the last year , compared to the national average of 2% ) , is certain to become an obstacle to the expanding industry. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
This , of course , does not address the [ORG GoB  ] 's principal concern of how to maintain competitive prices for ethanol during the interharvest period . 
[PER Bressan  ] has stated that the [ORG GoB  ] and industry are discussing palliative measures but failed to expand on what they [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000788 002 OF 002 were . 
They are simply " discussing the issue . 
" The most prominent idea , reflected in numerous media accounts , is to create stockpiles of sufficient size to guarantee supply . 
While the industry and government agree to the idea in concept , both sides dispute who should be responsible for creating mechanisms and supplying the necessary funding for the stocks . 
While [PER Roberto Rodrigues  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's Minister of Agriculture , initially said that the government was studying inexpensive financing mechanisms for creating stocks , he later retracted those comments affirming that stocks are the responsibility of the productive chain. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
In terms of [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , and the growing attention exhibited by parties like [PER Gates  ] , [PER Brin  ] and [PER Page  ] , and rising interest in [LOC California  ] , [PER Bressan  ] noted that the [ORG Ministry  ] would like to see [LOC U.S.  ] tariff barriers dropped on combustible ethanol . 
But , he stated , it needed to be done in a systematic fashion . 
He fears that when the [LOC U.S.  ] market opens , [MISC Brazilian  ] consumers will be adversely affected by a dearth in supply resulting from profit hungry exporters . 
[PER Bressan  ] further maintained that the [ORG GoB  ] has an interest in creating a world market and that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] should work together to achieve that goal . 
He added too , that countries , including the [LOC U.S.  ] , have a vested interest in working with [LOC Brazil  ] because of the " know-how " they have regarding the production and processing of ethanol. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
A crucial link in this process , from his perspective , will be spreading the supply chain throughout the developing world , especially in [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Asia  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , he stated emphatically , are not capable of sustaining a world ethanol market on their own . 
That , of course , has not stopped the likes of [ORG Petrobras  ] from signing a contract in February to build a pipeline from [PER Goias  ] ( one of [LOC Brazil  ] 's principal cane producing regions ) down to [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest port in [LOC Santos  ] . 
A portent of how industry views the future role of ethanol. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Comment: In the short-term , it is clear that alcohol induced euphoria will continue the industry 's ascension . 
As the world 's largest producer of sugar and alcohol , [LOC Brazil  ] is taking measures to increase production and at least discussing how to satisfy supply in the boom time . 
In response to the crisis over the last four months and the elevated prices , the [ORG GoB  ] has recognized its impotence and is " throwing in the towel " , waiting for the new harvest . 
This is currently underway , and greater supplies of ethanol are expected in filling stations by early May .
