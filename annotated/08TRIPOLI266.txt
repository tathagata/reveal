REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: A pair of recent visits by Emboffs to detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi , who remains at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) despite assurances he would be released in late March , suggest that the GOL and [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) are using prostate complications attendant to a recent change in medication as a pretext to delay his discharge while they pressure his family to sign a written pledge that he will refrain from political statements or discussion of his detention after his release . 
The [ORG QDF  ] subsequently told Post the requirement for a signed , written statement had been dropped , but the family claims this has not been conveyed to them . 
El-Jahmi 's treating physician believes his prostate condition is not/not serious and says el-Jahmi 's cardiac condition - the most serious of his medical issues - is stable enough that he may be safely discharged immediately . 
End summary . 
VISITS TO THE [ORG TMC  ] 2 . 
( C ) P/E Chief visited el-Jahmi at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) on March 27 and March 30 . 
El-Jahmi 's wife and sons , [PER Muhammad  ] and [PER Ahmed  ] , were present during both visits . 
His treating physician , Dr. [PER Abdulrahman Mehdy  ] , was present for the second visit on March 30 . 
Three plainclothes security officials , whom P/E Chief has seen before ( ref A and previous ) were present during the first visit , but not the second . 
Breaking with past practice , P/E Chief established a time for the second visit with el-Jahmi 's son , [PER Muhammad  ] , by telephone . 
[PER Muhammad  ] said security officials , who are otherwise constantly present , vacated their posts about 30 minutes before P/E Chief arrived on March 30 . 
The man described as el-Jahmi 's " nurse " , [PER Abdullah Bashir  ] , was not present during either visit . 
EL-JAHMI'S CARDIAC CONDITION STABLE 3 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] described el-Jahmi 's current medical condition as " stable and good " ; however , a new beta blocker heart medication introduced after the recent visit of [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] ( [ORG HRW  ] ) and [ORG Physicians for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG PHR  ] ) had adversely interacted with one of el-Jahmi 's medications for his prostate condition , causing his blood pressure to drop . 
The prostate medication was discontinued ; el-Jahmi subsequently experienced a resurgence of prostate-related symptoms ( burning during micturation and minor incontinence ) . 
[PER Mehdy  ] stressed those conditions were not/not serious and did not , in his opinion , prevent el-Jahmi from being discharged from hospital . 
PROSTATE COMPLICATION NOT/NOT SERIOUS 4 . 
( C ) Clarifying contradictory reports from [ORG HRW  ] and the media about proposed surgical intervention for el-Jahmi 's prostate condition , [PER Mehdy  ] explained that the [ORG TMC  ] 's resident urologist , in [LOC Italy  ] for a conference , would return to [ORG Tripoli April  ] 2 and would assess el-Jahmi 's condition on/about April 3 . 
In his initial consultations with [PER Mehdy  ] , the urologist suggested his preference would be to remove el-Jahmi 's prostate and subsequently biopsy it to determine whether any malignancy was present . 
( Note: It was unclear late last week whether the proposed procedure would be a biopsy or removal of el-Jahmi 's prostate . 
End note . 
) [PER Mehdy  ] said another approach , believed to be that advocated by [ORG PHR  ] 's Dr. [PER Scott Allen  ] , who visited el-Jahmi circa March 12-14 , would be to first biopsy el-Jahmi 's prostate to determine whether it was necessary to remove it . 
DOCTOR SAYS ( PRIVATELY ) THAT EL-JAHMI CAN BE RELEASED .. . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER Mehdy  ] said el-Jahmi 's cardiac condition was , in his medical opinion , sufficiently stable that he could be safely discharged from the [ORG TMC  ] , provided he received needed ongoing care on an outpatient basis . 
The typical observation period for the new beta blocker medication introduced after the [PER HRW/PHR  ] visit was two weeks . 
That period had already elapsed . 
A very conservative approach would call for a further four to five days of observation , but barring any change in condition el-Jahmi [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000266 002 OF 003 could be released by about April 4 . 
El-Jahmi 's prostate condition was not/not serious enough to delay his discharge . 
[ORG QDF  ] TELLS FAMILY THEY MUST SIGN PLEDGE TO KEEP EL-JAHMI QUIET El-Jahmi 's family said they have all but completed repairs to the family home in [LOC Tripoli  ] and would be ready to take el-Jahmi there directly from the [ORG TMC  ] . 
Earlier discussions about the [ORG QDF  ] providing a furnished flat or villa in which el-Jahmi could convalesce before his expected return to [LOC Benghazi  ] had not born fruit . 
During P/E Chief 's visit on March 27 , [PER Muhammad  ] said [ORG QDF Human Rights Director  ] [PER Abdelsalem Saleh  ] had stipulated that [PER Muhammad  ] and his mother sign a document as a condition for his discharge from hospital pledging that el-Jahmi would not " speak with anyone in any channel " about political issues or his experience in detention . 
The signed statement would make [PER Muhammad  ] and his mother responsible for keeping el-Jahmi quiet . 
[PER Saleh  ] told [PER Muhammad  ] that el-Jahmi and his family would " be directly affected " if el-Jahmi spoke with anyone after leaving hospital . 
[ORG QDF Executive Director  ] [PER Sawani  ] subsequently called the [ORG CDA  ] , asking that he convey to [LOC Washington  ] that after consultation with the [ORG QDF  ] 's chairman ( i.e. , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi ) , the requirement for a signed , written pledge had been dropped . 
El-Jahmi 's wife and sons stressed to P/E Chief on March 30 that the [ORG QDF  ] had not/not told them that the requirement for a signed statement had been dropped . 
8 . 
( C ) El-Jahmi told P/E Chief on March 27 that he would not/not agree to any " formal conditions " in exchange for his discharge , and had told his wife and [PER Muhammad  ] that he did not/not consent to their signing the [ORG QDF  ] 's proposed pledge , either . 
As reported ref B , during [PER HRW/PHR  ] 's visit , el-Jahmi agreed to abide by the tacit understanding that he would refrain from public statements about political issues or his detention . 
According to [PER HRW/PHR  ] , el-Jahmi 's daughter , [PER Najla  ] , played a key role in convincing her father that he should agree to remain quite , stressing to him that his focus - for now - should be on recovering his health and protecting his family . 
EL-JAHMI REQUESTS POLITICAL ASYLUM 9 . 
( C ) On March 27 , el-Jahmi told P/E Chief he needed " international protection " and mentioned asylum . 
He asked that the [MISC Embassy  ] explore the possibility of either transporting him from the [ORG TMC  ] to his home in an [MISC Embassy  ] vehicle or escorting him . 
On March 30 , he reiterated the request for protection and clarified his remarks on asylum , indicating that he was requesting political asylum from the [LOC U.S.  ] Noting references to an asylum request in a media statement by el-Jahmi 's brother , resident in the [LOC U.S.  ] , P/E Chief said he would convey the request . 
Given [ORG GOL  ] sensitivities , P/E Chief noted that our ability to act on that request would depend in part on limiting public discussion of it . 
( Note: As reported ref B , the [ORG QDF  ] indicated it was " not opposed " to facilitating issuance of a passport to el-Jahmi to travel abroad for treatment , provided he abided by the tacit understanding that he would refrain from speaking publicly about political issues or his experience in detention . 
End note . 
) THE WAY AHEAD: COMMENT & GUIDANCE REQUEST 10 . 
( C ) Comment: It increasingly appears that the [ORG GOL  ] , acting through the [ORG QDF  ] , is using el-Jahmi 's prostate complications as a pretext to delay releasing him while they pressure [PER Muhammad  ] and his mother to formally pledge that el-Jahmi will stay quiet after his discharge . 
[PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , who is personally involved , has a considerable personal stake in [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000266 003 OF 003 ensuring that el-Jahmi 's release does not prompt adverse media reaction akin to that in the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses case last summer . 
The [ORG QDF  ] is in the delicate position of trying to facilitate el-Jahmi 's release to respond positively to international pressure and assuring reluctant old guard regime elements that the [ORG GOL  ] will not be embarrassed for its efforts . 
Post recommends that NEA/MAG contact [PER Dr. Allen  ] in the [LOC U.S.  ] to: 1 ) pass el-Jahmi 's latest test results ( sent to NEA/MAG by email ) ; 2 ) ask him to consult with Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] by telephone and , 3 ) explore whether [PER Dr. Allen  ] would be willing to recommend to the [ORG QDF  ] - either directly or through Post - that el-Jahmi is fit to be discharged . 
( Note: Post is not in a position to have confidential conversations with [PER Dr. Allen  ] . 
End note . 
) SIPDIS 11 . 
( C ) Comment ( continued ) : Post notes that the [ORG QDF  ] 's [MISC Dr. Sawani  ] is currently in [LOC Washington  ] for a joint [ORG Green Book Society/Middle East Institute  ] conference on [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Africa  ] , scheduled to take place March 31 . 
If the opportunity arises to engage [MISC Dr. Sawani  ] while he is in [LOC Washington  ] , Post suggests that the following points be conveyed to him: 1 ) our understanding is that there is no medical reason for keeping el-Jahmi in hospital ; 2 ) el-Jahmi should be released from the [ORG TMC  ] now ; 3 ) there should be no formal conditions for el-Jahmi 's release and , 4 ) it is expected that the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] will ensure el-Jahmi 's physical safety . 
Post would suggest the following points for any public statements on the case: 1 ) We welcome news that [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi 's medical condition has improved since he began receiving treatement , and ; 2 ) the embassy has visited el-Jahmi regularly to assess his medical condition and prognosis for his release , and has been in regular contact with el-Jahmi and his family . 
( Note: Post strongly recommends that the Department not/not disclose publicly or to [PER HRW/PHR  ] and others that el-Jahmi has requested asylum ; our ability to successfully secure el-Jahmi 's passport and dispensation to travel will depend in large measure on the extent to which our engagement and role remain quiet . 
End note . 
) 12 . 
( C ) Guidance Request: Post requests guidance on how to respond to el-Jahmi 's request for political asylum . 
End comment & guidance request .
