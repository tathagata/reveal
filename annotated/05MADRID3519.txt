( U ) This is an Action Request for [ORG ISN/MTR  ] -- see paragraph 8. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [ORG MFA Disarmament Affairs  ] Ambassador [PER Tomas Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] summoned ESTHOFF September 30 to [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] said that during the [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] bilat on the first day of the September 12-16 Madrid MTCR plenary , and in a subsequent side bar meeting during a plenary Information Exchange session , [LOC Spain  ] had raised with the [ORG ISN/MTR Office  ] Director [PER Van Diepen  ] the request by the [MISC Spanish  ] firm " [MISC Espinesa  ] " to sell a [MISC Nitrate-based  ] explosives manufacturing plant to [LOC Libya  ] ( allegedly for mining-related conventional explosives production ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] explained that the [MISC Spanish  ] firm first wanted to sell the explosives plant in 2000 . 
[LOC Spain  ] checked with the [LOC U.S.  ] , which in May and September of 2001 advised [LOC Spain  ] to block the sale , arguing that the plant could easily be converted into a missile fuel production facility for [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC SCUD  ] missiles . 
[LOC Spain  ] eventually turned off the sale , prohibiting it for a period of three years . 
[PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] said the company had sued the [ORG GOS  ] after it blocked the sale in 2001 , and that this suit remained pending in the [MISC Spanish  ] courts . 
All the while , the entire plant has been sitting in a [LOC Valencia  ] warehouse waiting to be sold. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] noted that the [ORG GOS  ] three year sale moratorium had now expired and that in the meantime , [LOC Libya  ] had started to return to the " normal " community of nations ( leaving " rogue " status behind ) . 
" [MISC Espinesa  ] " recently asked the [ORG GOS  ] for permission to make the same sale to [LOC Libya  ] , arguing that the three year ban had expired and [LOC Libya  ] was now a friendly and cooperative country . 
[PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] said the [MISC Libyan  ] Government had leaned very heavily on the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] , requesting repeatedly that [LOC Spain  ] let the sale go through. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG MFA  ] , according to [PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] , does not/not think the sale should go through . 
Neither does the [ORG CNA  ] ( the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG CIA  ] equivalent ) . 
Both argue that while the current [MISC Libyan  ] Government may have changed its spots , a coup could happen any day and a less friendly/responsible [MISC Libyan  ] regime could emerge . 
[PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] stressed that [LOC Libya  ] retains 400 medium range SCUDs with the ability to strike [LOC Israel  ] and that this explosives plant could easily be converted from producing mining explosives into producing [MISC SCUD  ] missile fuel . 
Thus , [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG CNA  ] want to extend the sales band to 2008 ( three more years ) . 
However , the [MISC Libyan  ] lobbying of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , as well as pressure from the company , has led the [ORG GOS  ] to reopen the issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) The reason for summoning [ORG ESTHOFF  ] to [ORG MFA  ] , [PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] explained , was to request [LOC U.S.  ] support for [MISC MFA/CNA  ] efforts to continue to block the sale . 
[PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] said that if the [LOC U.S.  ] were to officially informed Madrid that it opposed the sale , this would strengthen [ORG MFA  ] 's case to extend the sales ban through 2008 . 
In brief , [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG CNA  ] want the [ORG USG  ] as bureaucratic allies in their battle to gain [ORG GOS  ] approval to prohibit the sale for three more years. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] said that [ORG ISN/MTR Office  ] Director [PER Van Diepen  ] had indicated to him at the plenary that the [LOC U.S.  ] would likely oppose the sale , but would have to confirm this after [PER Van Diepen  ] 's return to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] said he was now , via this meeting , requesting an official communication of [ORG USG  ] views on the sale . 
Either in writing or delivered orally through [ORG ESTHOFF  ] would be acceptable . 
[PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] said the communication could also go through [MISC CIA-CNA  ] channels if the [LOC U.S.  ] preferred . 
He said he would like to have this communication by Friday October 14 , if possible . 
He suggested that internal [ORG GOS  ] decision meetings regarding the sale would take place shortly after that date . 
[ORG ESTHOFF  ] told [PER Rodriguez-Pantoja  ] that he was optimistic that the [ORG Embassy  ] would be able to pass [ORG USG  ] views on the sale prior to October 14. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) ACTION REQUEST - please pass [ORG USG  ] views on this possible sale to [ORG Embassy  ] Madrid [ORG ESTHOFF  ] Ken Forder prior to [ORG MFA  ] 's October 14 deadline .
