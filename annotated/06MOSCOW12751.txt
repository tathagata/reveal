<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 012751 SIPDIS SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/RUS EO 12958 DECL: 11/29/2016 TAGS PGOV , KDEM , PREL , PINR , RS SUBJECT: [ORG LITVINENKO ASSASSINATION:  ] REACTION IN [LOC MOSCOW  ] REF: [LOC MOSCOW  ] 11490 Classified By: Ambassador [PER William J. Burns:  ] 1.4 ( d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The November 23 death by radiation poisoning of former [ORG FSB  ] agent [PER Aleksandr Litvinenko  ] in [LOC London  ] has spawned a welter of conspiracy theories in [LOC Russia  ] . 
The media have variously traced [MISC Litvinenko’s  ] demise to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , suicide , [ORG Putin’s  ] [LOC Kremlin  ] , [PER Putin  ] himself , those determined to undermine [PER Putin  ] , [ORG FSB  ] agents unhappy with [MISC Litvinenko’s  ] alleged betrayal of their organization , those unhappy with [MISC Litvinenko’s  ] cooperation with [MISC Israel-based  ] businessman [PER Nevzlin  ] on the [ORG Yukos  ] affair , and the [LOC United States  ] or “other” countries . 
This message recounts a representative sample of speculation , much of it self-serving . 
End summary. --------------- Make [PER Putin Stay  ] --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Independent radio station [PER Ekho Moskvy  ] Editor-in-Chief [PER Aleksey Venediktov  ] , like many here , linked the murders of [PER Litvinenko  ] and journalist [PER Anna Politkovskaya  ] . 
( [PER Politkovskaya  ] , who had accused the [PER GOR  ] of human rights abuses in [LOC Chechnya  ] , was murdered in [LOC Moscow  ] on October 7 ( reftel ) . 
) In his telling , both murders , with perhaps more to come , are part of an effort to force [PER Putin  ] to remain in office beyond 2008 by , in effect , making him persona non grata in the [LOC West  ] . 
( [PER Putin  ] has repeatedly insisted he will leave when his term expires in 2008 . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Venediktov  ] pegged the two assassinations to rogue or retired [ORG FSB  ] or military intelligence agents controlled by forces either within or without the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
[PER Putin  ] , [PER Venediktov  ] thought , is well aware of the game being played , but is powerless to stop it ; in part because he is not certain whom to hold responsible . 
[PER Venediktov  ] subscribed to the generally-held view here that [PER Putin  ] values his reputation in the [LOC West  ] , and that sabotaging it is one path to having him reconsider his decision to leave the [LOC Kremlin  ] in 2008. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Venediktov  ] did not exclude the possibility that the culprit in [MISC Litvinenko’s  ] poisoning may have been ex-FSB agent turned businessman [PER Andrey Lugovoy  ] , who has loudly advertised his innocence . 
[PER Lugovoy  ] met with [PER Litvinenko  ] in [LOC London  ] November 1 , the day [PER Litvinenko  ] was allegedly irradiated . 
Lugovoy’s rush to the [LOC Moscow  ] [MISC British  ] Embassy and into the [MISC Russian  ] media immediately after the [PER Litvinenko  ] story broke in the press was designed to provide him with a measure of protection , [PER Venediktov  ] thought , should “others” --either those who commissioned the killing or those unhappy with the furor it has caused-- want revenge . 
[PER Venediktov  ] joined [ORG National Bolshevik Party  ] leader [PER Eduard Limonov  ] in finding it suspicious that a [MISC Moscow-based  ] businessman and former [ORG FSBer  ] like [PER Lugovoy  ] would want to cooperate commercially with a man like [PER Litvinenko  ] who was on the [LOC Kremlin’s  ] --and the FSB’s-- enemy list . 
[PER Lugovoy  ] may have been dispatched to cultivate , and kill , [PER Litvinenko  ] , [PER Venediktov  ] thought. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a separate conversation November 30 , the [ORG Moscow Heritage Foundation’s  ] [PER Yevgeniy Volk  ] seconded the version of events offered by [PER Venediktov  ] , and was at pains in his remarks to insulate [PER Putin  ] from any association with the murders . 
[ORG Volk  ] described [PER Putin  ] as a “pawn in a larger game” being played by those in the [LOC Kremlin  ] as 2008 drew nearer . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] saw [PER Putin’s  ] fingerprints on both the murders , although he admitted he had no evidence to support his allegations . 
Noting that [PER Putin  ] had appointed [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] Prime Minister of [LOC Chechnya  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered us his bleak assessment of [PER Putin  ] with the phrase “you know people by the company they keep.” --------------- Make [PER Putin Play  ] --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Stanislav Belkovskiy  ] , political analyst from the [ORG National Strategic Institute  ] also linked the [PER Politkovskaya  ] and [PER Litvinenko  ] killings , but thought they were designed to influence the succession struggle . 
In his far-fetched ( but indicative of the conspiratorial mood that hangs over [LOC Moscow  ] ) telling , [LOC Kremlin  ] “liberals” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had engineered the assassinations in order to embarrass [PER Putin  ] before the [LOC West  ] , [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00012751 002 OF 003 and force him to sacrifice someone from his inner circle in order to salvage his reputation . 
[PER Belkovskiy  ] thought that victim would be [ORG Presidential Administration Deputy Head  ] and leader of the so-called “siloviki , ” [PER Igor Sechin  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] understand that First Deputy PM [PER Medvedev  ] is a very weak presidential candidate , and that [PER Putin  ] remains unconvinced that he would make an able successor . 
Undermining the “siloviki” is one way to ensure the inevitability of [MISC Medvedev’s  ] candidacy , [PER Belkovskiy  ] told us . 
He suggested that [PER Putin  ] could portray Sechin’s ouster as the first serious step in the fight against government corruption , noting , “Putin could credibly tar him with the [ORG Yukos  ] machinations.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The victims to date , [PER Politkovskaya  ] and [PER Litvinenko  ] , had been selected because they were better known beyond [MISC Russia’s  ] borders , where it was important that the murders resonate most strongly . 
[PER Belkovskiy  ] predicted more murders to come if [PER Putin  ] “failed to get the message.” He suggested that [PER Garry Kasparov’s  ] absence from the [MISC Russian  ] media , ties to the [LOC U.S.  ] , and name recognition abroad made him a likely victim. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Belkovskiy  ] offered in support of his theory what he said was indirect proof of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] involvement . 
[PER Belkovskiy  ] told us he had been approached the week of October 2 by a longtime contact from [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] inner circle who warned him that he had been targeted and should leave [LOC Russia  ] immediately , which he did . 
Politkovskaya’s murder that weekend had , [PER Belkovskiy  ] believed , the “liberals’” fingerprints on it . 
He doubted that he had ever been the actual target , and speculated that his contact knew of a plot to kill someone in journalistic circles , and had warned [PER Belkovskiy  ] “just in case.” --------------- Make [PER Putin Stay  ] --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG Institute for Globalization Problem’s  ] [PER Mikhail Delyagin  ] added the November 18 killing in [LOC Moscow  ] of [PER Movdali Baysarov  ] , [MISC Chechen  ] “Gorets” division commander and critic of [MISC Chechen  ] Prime Minister [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] ; and the November 4 “Russian March” to [PER Belkovskiy  ] and Venediktov’s lists of recent , linked events . 
[PER Delyagin  ] joined others here in assuming that Baysarov’s killing had not occurred as described by the [LOC Moscow  ] police . 
( [ORG Moscow Internal Affairs  ] personnel claimed that [PER Baysarov  ] had threatened them with a hand grenade when stopped on a busy [LOC Moscow  ] avenue . 
[MISC Russian  ] blogs and the internet press are filled with alleged eyewitness accounts that claim [PER Baysarov  ] offered no resistance . 
) Baysarov’s protective detail had been suspended just before his murder , something that only could have been done , [PER Delyagin  ] said , by the [ORG FSB  ] or “someone higher.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) According to [PER Delyagin  ] , the killings of [PER Baysarov  ] , [PER Politkovskaya  ] , and [PER Litvinenko  ] combine to create an atmosphere of chaos desired by the “siloviki , ” who would like [PER Putin  ] to remain in office . 
[PER Delyagin  ] discounted XXXXXXXXXX as possible authors of the murder of [PER Litvinenko  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXX In addition , he said , they lack the connections to confidentially procure the polonium 210 allegedly used in the [LOC SIPDIS  ] killing . 
[PER Delyagin  ] joined [PER Venediktov  ] and [PER Belkovskiy  ] in seeing the polonium as the calling card of someone in [LOC Moscow.  ] -------------------------- XXXXXXXXX-------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) ------------------ No Theory Suffices ------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In a December 1 conversation , the [ORG Carnegie Moscow  ] Center’s [PER Masha Lipman  ] cautioned against falling prey to conspiracy theories . 
None of the ones available , she thought , fully account for what appears to be happening . 
She found it unlikely that the killings were being staged in an effort to force [PER Putin  ] to remain in office . 
If so , the strategy seemed shortsighted , as [PER Putin  ] who felt his hand had [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00012751 003 OF 003 been forced would surely seek revenge if compelled by circumstances he did not create to remain . 
With little information available , the only thing that could be said with certainty , she thought , was that [LOC Russia  ] had again entered a period , perhaps occasioned by the looming 2008 succession , where problems were being solved by force . 
[PER Lipman  ] noted that recent murders had not been confined to enemies of the [LOC Kremlin  ] ; she mentioned the assassination of [ORG Central Bank  ] Chairman [PER Kozlov  ] , and suggested that factors contributing to the recent re-eruption of violence in addition to 2008 might be corruption , institutions unable to solve the problems of [MISC Russians  ] , and the sense , at least in the [LOC Kremlin  ] , that [PER Putin  ] no longer is fully in control as his power wanes with the approaching end of his term. ---------- Postscript ---------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The sense of unease here only deepened with news that former Prime Minister [PER Yegor Gaidar  ] had been poisoned November 24 while attending a conference in [LOC Dublin  ] . 
[ORG United Energy Systems’  ] Chairman [PER Anatoliy Chubais  ] , who talked to [PER Gaidar  ] after he returned to [LOC Moscow  ] , alleged that [PER Gaidar  ] had been the victim of foul play even before hearing the verdict of the [LOC Moscow  ] physicians . 
[PER Chubais  ] implied that Berezovskiy was the culprit . 
[PER Gaidar  ] Spokesman [PER Valeriy Natarov  ] reported the evening of November 30 that Gaidar’s [LOC Moscow  ] doctors believed that he had been poisoned . 
Gaidar’s daughter [PER Mariya  ] alleged poisoning as well in a November 30 Radio Moskvy interview . 
However , she cautioned that a complete diagnosis would have to await the arrival of initial tests on [PER Gaidar  ] conducted at the [LOC Dublin  ] hospital . 
Other media report that [PER Gaidar  ] is recovering and expects to be discharged December 4. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Masha Lipman  ] believed that the well-connected Chubais’s early certainty that [PER Gaidar  ] had been poisoned might mean that he knows , or has reason to suspect that he knows , who was behind the attempt . 
[PER Gaidar  ] , she hoped , might shed some light on this when released from the hospital next week. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) All of the above putative versions of events are handicapped by a lack of evidence and by the existence of other motives for the killings and other potential perpetrators . 
Whatever the truth may ultimately be --and it may never be known-- the tendency here to almost automatically assume that someone in or close to [MISC Putin’s  ] inner circle is the author of these deaths speaks volumes about expectations of [LOC Kremlin  ] behavior as the high-stakes succession struggle intensifies .
