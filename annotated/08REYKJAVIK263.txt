[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Summary: Public support for [LOC Iceland  ] 's government has fallen below 50 percent in the wake of the financial crisis here , and cracks are beginning to widen between the two coalition parties as weekly demonstrations grow in size and fervor . 
PM [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) has taken the brunt of criticism for the failed economy , while Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] is polling higher than its election results last year . 
In the short term , a lack of viable ( i.e. , pro-EU ) partners and [PER Gisladottir  ] 's good relationship with [PER Haarde  ] will likely keep the FM from breaking up the coalition in the hope of new elections . 
However , [PER Gisladottir  ] has said publicly she is pushing within the cabinet for [LOC Iceland  ] to explore [ORG EU  ] membership , and polls show a majority of the public agree with her . 
Securing a $6 billion package of [ORG IMF  ] and bilateral financing will buy the government some time , but if [PER Haarde  ] cannot convince his party to go along with exploring [ORG EU  ] membership we could see early elections called for the first time since the 1960s . 
Some form of reshuffle is almost inevitable , however -- [PER Haarde  ] will not be able to answer the growing pro-EU group in his party without lots of blood on the floor and the rousting of several old [ORG IP  ] chieftans ( including the Minister of [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Central Bank  ] Chairman [PER David Oddsson  ] ) . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Following the economic disaster of October and the collapse of the country 's banking sector , the government continues to take a beating in the polls . 
Public support for the government fell to 46 percent by the end of October , down 30 points from the beginning of the year . 
While support for the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( the junior coalition partner ) has held steady or increased slightly , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) has been hammered . 
The [ORG IP  ] , after nearly two continuous decades as [LOC Iceland  ] 's largest political party , is now third behind the [ORG SDA  ] and the opposition [MISC Left-Greens  ] , pulling only 22 percent in the polls . 
The opposition parties and a growing portion of the electorate are now calling for elections before the current term ends in 2011 . 
A poll at the end of October showed 60 percent support for early elections , and the Chairman of the [MISC Left-Greens  ] showed up at the [ORG Embassy  ] 's Election Night event gleefully working the room with that encouraging datum . 
Demonstrations calling for -- among other things -- a new government continue to grow , with the latest protest on November 8 drawing over 3000 participants. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) That the public blames the [ORG IP  ] specifically for the economic crisis is no coincidence -- the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are both from the party , and the [ORG IP  ] 's 2007 campaign was based on the notion that only the [ORG Independence Party  ] could be counted on to maintain [LOC Iceland  ] 's then-world-beating prosperity and quality of life . 
More significantly , many domestic and international observers blame former PM and [MISC Grand Old Man  ] of the [ORG Independence Party  ] [PER David Oddsson  ] for [LOC Iceland  ] 's stunning loss of credibility in the financial world . 
[PER Oddsson  ] has served as the highly controversial Chairman of the [ORG Central Bank  ] since 2005 . 
He made a number of ill-considered statements to the media early in the crisis , and many suspect it was at least partially due to his wounded pride that [LOC Iceland  ] did not immediately seek [ORG IMF  ] assistance . 
[PER Haarde  ] 's apparent inability to " control " or remove his predecessor as [ORG IP Chair  ] has led many to blame the [ORG Independence Party  ] for the continuing economic bad news. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Indeed , [PER Haarde  ] missed a key opportunity to gain political support by not replacing [PER Oddsson  ] early in the crisis . 
Even among [ORG IP  ] stalwarts , [PER Oddsson  ] 's standing has never been lower , with the party 's younger , more business-oriented members asserting to [ORG Emboffs  ] and journalists that it was time for [PER Oddsson  ] --rabidly anti-EU membership for [LOC Iceland  ] -- to finally exit the stage . 
Only [PER Haarde  ] has the authority to replace the [ORG Central Bank Chair  ] , and speculation around town is that the PM has not pulled the trigger thus far out of a deep sense of personal loyalty to his old mentor . 
The result is that demonstrators now excoriate [PER Haarde  ] as well as [PER Oddsson  ] , the initial target of public ire . 
While [PER Oddsson  ] remains in the picture , it will be almost impossible for [PER Haarde  ] to start his party and his country moving towards the [ORG EU.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Other [ORG IP  ] members , however , are proving much more open to [ORG EU  ] membership , and are finding support from those who previously stayed out of the debate . 
[ORG IP Vice Chair  ] and Minister of Education [PER Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir  ] , though cautioning that she was not making any sort of leadership challenge , said in a highly publicized late October interview that the her party had always pledged to take the most pragmatic stand on [ORG EU  ] membership in terms of what was best for [LOC Iceland  ] 's interests . 
Given that both the global and domestic economic situation has changed so dramatically in recent months , [PER Gunnarsdottir  ] continued , it is only logical that the [ORG IP  ] reexamine its stand . 
[PER Bjarni Benediktsson  ] , Chair of the [ORG Althingi Foreign Affairs REYKJAVIK  ] 00000263 002 OF 002 Committee , quickly echoed this argument . 
[PER PolOff  ] has heard separately from [ORG IP  ] sources that [PER Benediktsson  ] sees the party 's old guard as standing in the way of not only serious consideration of [ORG EU  ] membership for [LOC Iceland  ] , but also [PER Benediktsson  ] 's personal ambitions of a cabinet post. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) , however , has become increasingly strident in its calls for serious exploration of [ORG EU  ] membership as well as the dismissal of [ORG Central Bank Chair  ] [PER Oddsson  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] said in a press interview that she is pressing [PER Haarde  ] for a new policy on the [ORG EU  ] , and other [ORG SDA  ] ministers have been equally active on this front . 
However , to our knowledge , she has not made the leap to a push for early elections , though her party would be likely to benefit . 
There may be a practical explanation here , as [PER Gisladottir  ] 's recovery from brain surgery in September has kept her away from work for much of the tumultuous fall . 
Some here also credit her personal relationship with the Prime Minister as a brake on a move to change the coalition . 
The two party heads have developed an unexpectedly close and collaborative working relationship and clearly both like and respect each other . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] may view [PER Haarde  ] as a useful ally in the future should she be able to convince him to reexamine the [ORG EU  ] question. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Most probable , however , is the explanation that [PER Gisladottir  ] simply does not see a viable alternative to the [ORG IP  ] as a coalition partner at the moment . 
The [ORG Progressive Party  ] -- [LOC Iceland  ] 's only other pro-EU party -- has seen only marginal gains over the last month , and would in all likelihood still be too small to form a two-party coalition with the [ORG SDA  ] . 
The [ORG Liberal Party  ] is even smaller , leaving only the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] . 
Although the [MISC Left-Greens  ] have polled significantly higher of late , they still do not endorse [ORG EU  ] membership for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] seems unwilling to go into coalition with yet another party that is against joining the [ORG EU  ] . 
However , as with the [ORG IP  ] , the [MISC Left-Greens  ] are locked in an internal struggle over their [ORG EU  ] policy ; the party 's [ORG Vice Chair  ] told [PER PolOff  ] over the summer that she was sympathetic to the growing pro-EU wing of the party and that she expected a reevaluation of the party 's [ORG EU  ] policy by the end of 2008 . 
This dynamic may be what FM [PER Gisladottir  ] meant in an interview when she said early elections would be a distraction to the government now , " but then a new year is coming , and people will have to assess the situation then . 
" COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) In the short term , the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] desperately needs to finalize the $6 billion loan package with the [ORG IMF  ] and other bilateral donors . 
If the [ORG IMF  ] loan fails to come through , the government will lose what little remaining credibility it has on the economic front and may very well find it impossible to stay on . 
Despite the protests and the speculation around town , however , we note that there is little tradition here of disgraced politicians or governments -- even those convicted of crimes -- resigning from their posts . 
Early elections have not been invoked since the 1960s , and then only because a three-party coalition dissolved and no replacement could be created . 
No-confidence votes are virtually unheard of. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) If the [ORG IMF  ] loan comes through , a likely scenario is that after the new year [ORG SDA Chair  ] [PER Gisladottir  ] and a group led by [ORG IP Vice Chair  ] Gunnarsdottir present the Prime Minister with their own ultimatums , both calling for a serious look at [ORG EU  ] membership , and explicitly ( [ORG SDA  ] ) or implicitly ( [ORG IP  ] ) calling for [PER Oddsson  ] 's removal . 
In any event , a cabinet reshuffle -- either to give the [ORG SDA  ] more power over economic policymaking , to sweep out the [ORG IP  ] old guard , or both -- seems inevitable once the fate of the [ORG IMF  ] loan is clear. van Voorst</pre></code>
