( C ) Less than two weeks after her party suffered losses in two state elections , [ORG CDU  ] Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] found her fighting spirit before 8,000 party faithful at a September 6 election rally in [LOC Duesseldorf  ] launching the " hot phase " of the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] electoral campaign . 
The [ORG CDU  ] has been shifting party tactics after its losses in the August 30 elections in [LOC Saarland  ] and [LOC Thuringia  ] , where the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) may now be in a position to form coalitions with the [ORG Left Party  ] . 
[PER Merkel  ] -- to great applause -- focused in on the specter of a so-called red-red government composed of the [ORG SPD  ] and The [ORG Left Party  ] . 
She described the [ORG SPD  ] as suffering from an " identity crisis , " and needing a vacation from political decision-making and time in opposition . 
Along with the entire [ORG CDU  ] leadership and incumbent [ORG CDU/CSU  ] Ministers-president , [PER Merkel  ] made her case for a [ORG CDU/CSU  ] coalition with the pro-business but socially liberal [ORG FDP  ] . 
She repeated the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] 's election mantra: " we have the strength " throughout her speech , aiming to convince the [MISC German  ] electorate that a strong [ORG CDU/CSU  ] is required for [LOC Germany  ] to emerge from its worst economic recession in post-war history . 
[ORG CDU  ] views on whether the issue of [LOC Germany  ] 's role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would become a more prominent campaign theme were mixed. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) With three weeks to go before the parliamentary elections , all signs point to Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] returning to office , although she and her party recognize that they face a difficult campaign . 
It remains uncertain whether the [ORG CDU  ] and the [ORG FDP  ] will gain enough support to form a majority coalition . 
If not , another [ORG Grand Coalition  ] ( [ORG CDU/CSU-SPD  ] ) is very likely ; other options require a three-party constellation that would force the ill-suited [ORG Greens  ] and [ORG FDP  ] to work together . 
But , there seems to be an almost one hundred percent certainty -- given the [ORG SPD  ] 's chronic slump in the polls and limited coalition options -- that [ORG SPD  ] Foreign Minister and Chancellor-candidate [PER Frank Walter Steinmeier  ] will not become Chancellor . 
End summary . 
[PER MERKEL  ] CASTS ASIDE [ORG SPD  ] , EMBRACES [ORG FDP  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] -- to rapturous cries of " [LOC Angie  ] , [LOC Angie  ] " and a standing ovation -- took to the floor at her party 's September 6 rally before some 8,000 supporters affirming that the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] " have the best chance to win the parliamentary elections " but also cautioning that " the election 's outcome has not yet been decided . 
" On the one hand , she praised her [ORG Grand Coalition  ] government 's record , noting its success in countering [LOC Germany  ] 's economic and financial crisis . 
On the other hand , she called for a new [ORG CDU/CSU  ] coalition with the [ORG FDP  ] after the upcoming elections-- casting aside the [ORG SPD  ] . 
She asserted that such a coalition would anchor [LOC Germany  ] in the " middle " of the political spectrum and take the country out of its current economic crisis faster . 
[PER Merkel  ] said: " Our country needs a government that will support growth , security and work for everyone . 
" In a swipe at the [ORG SPD  ] ( COMMENT: [PER Merkel  ] never mentioned [PER Steinmeier  ] by name . 
END COMMENT . 
) , she said the party is currently plagued by an " identity crisis , " adding that , " The [ORG SPD  ] is devoid of any reality and is distraught . 
" She asked , " How can a party that achieved 10 , 18 , and 24 percent at the recent state elections in [LOC Saxony  ] , [LOC Thuringia  ] , and [LOC Saarland  ] be taken seriously ? 
" Dismissing [ORG SPD  ] warnings against a so-called " black-yellow " ( CDU/CSU-FDP ) coalition , [PER Merkel  ] said that the country should be more worried about the [ORG SPD  ] 's plans to form coalitions with The [ORG Left Party  ] on the state and federal levels . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG SPD  ] has warned that a black-yellow coalition would represent wealthy [LOC Germany  ] and business interest at the expense of the middle and lower classes . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [ORG CDU  ] leaders also tried to cast the [ORG CDU  ] at the state level in a positive light after its poor showing in the [LOC Saarland  ] and [LOC Thuringia  ] state elections on August , causing the Minister President of the latter state to resign . 
[LOC Lower Saxony  ] 's [ORG CDU  ] Minister President [PER Christian Wulff  ] asserted that the most prosperous and successful " Laender " ( states ) in [LOC Germany  ] are those ruled by the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] and [ORG FDP  ] . 
He cited [LOC Berlin  ] , governed by [ORG SPD  ] Mayor [PER Klaus Wowereit  ] 's [LOC Berlin  ] ( NOTE: in [LOC Berlin  ] the [ORG SPD  ] rules with The [ORG Left Party  ] . 
END NOTE ) , as being the worst case . 
[ORG Hesse  ] 's Minister President [PER Roland Koch  ] -- to great applause -- noted that he could not understand how the [ORG SPD  ] could possibly cooperate on a state or national level with a [ORG Left Party  ] that is " anti-American and anti-European . 
" ( [LOC Note:  ] In [LOC Saarland  ] and [LOC Thuringia  ] the option [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001106 002 OF 003 exists for the [ORG SPD  ] to form a governing coalition with the [ORG Left Party  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) [ORG CSU  ] Truce with [ORG FDP  ] ? ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG CSU  ] [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister-President [PER Horst Seehofer  ] threw his party 's support behind a [ORG CDU/CSU  ] coalition with the [ORG FDP  ] , despite his well-publicized doubts about the [ORG FDP  ] 's real coalition intentions after the parliamentary elections . 
Even as [PER Seehofer  ] pronounced his support for the [ORG FDP  ] in [LOC Duesseldorf  ] , however , media reports from [LOC Munich  ] confirmed that the [ORG CSU  ] had decided to continue attacking the [ORG FDP  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] has been buffing its economic bona fides by attacking the [ORG FDP  ] on its own themes while basking in the reflected glory from popular Economics Minister [PER zu Guttenberg  ] , the new [ORG CSU  ] champion . 
[PER Seehofer  ] has publicly suspected that [ORG FDP  ] Chairman [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] -- in an attempt to enter government at all costs -- might support a " traffic light " coalition with the [ORG SPD  ] and the [ORG Greens  ] , although this political constellation appears unlikely at present . 
In addition , [MISC Bavarian  ] politics trump national politics , especially during a time when the [ORG CSU  ] longs for the days when their party alone wielded political power in [LOC Munich  ] , rather than as it does today , in a coalition with the [ORG FDP  ] . 
[PER Seehofer  ] is also aware that the [ORG CSU  ] needs to be strong and the [ORG FDP  ] proportionally more weak for the [ORG CSU  ] to win more and better ministerial posts in a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition . 
He did not use his appearance in [LOC Duesseldorf  ] to chide the [ORG FDP  ] , to the great delight of those pleading that recent CDU/CSU-FDP bickering had been harmful and counter-productive during the campaign . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] - A DOMESTIC CAMPAIGN ISSUE ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The September 4 air strike against two fuel tankers near [LOC Kunduz  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] hit the press right before the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] rally . 
In light of the [MISC German  ] media 's frenzy , [PER PolOff  ] asked the [ORG CDU  ] 's Head of International Relations [PER Klemens Moemkes  ] whether [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG ISAF  ] commitment might emerge as a potential domestic campaign issue . 
[PER Moemkes  ] noted that the [ORG SPD  ] could make [LOC Afghanistan  ] an issue but this would be very odd given Foreign Minister [PER Steinmeier  ] 's support for [LOC Germany  ] 's military role in [ORG ISAF  ] . 
However , the prospect of [LOC Afghanistan  ] becoming a major theme clearly had the [ORG CDU  ] 's xxxxx spooked . 
He told [PER PolOff  ] that it would be very difficult for the [PER Chancellor  ] not to address [LOC Germany  ] 's role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the coming weeks . 
Given the [MISC German  ] public 's overwhelming support for a withdrawal of [MISC German  ] troops from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , this was not an issue the [PER Chancellor  ] wanted to address in the run-up to the parliamentary elections . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While it is all but certain that [PER Chancellor Merkel  ] will return to office as [PER Chancellor  ] after the next parliamentary elections on September 27 , it is too close to call whether she will achieve a coalition with the [ORG FDP  ] . 
[MISC Bavarian  ] MP [PER Seehofer  ] 's attacks on the [ORG FDP  ] in [LOC Bavaria  ] could weaken that party there and further undermine the chances of a coalition . 
The [ORG FDP  ] wants the same but political bickering over future ministerial positions and [ORG CSU  ] attacks on the [ORG FDP  ] in [LOC Bavaria  ] and on [ORG FDP  ] Chairman [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] suggest that a possible CDU/CSU-FDP coalition will not be a marriage made in heaven . 
Some [ORG FDP  ] contacts admit that they harbor doubts about the [PER Chancellor  ] 's promise to form a coalition with the [ORG FDP  ] . 
They insinuate that in reality she may prefer another [ORG Grand Coalition  ] with the [ORG SPD  ] , although [PER Chancellor Merkel  ] has used every public opportunity to advertise for a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition . 
Backing down on this pledge would call into question her reputation. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Paradoxically , however , it is the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] 's relative weakness in the polls ( 35-36 percent ) that threatens a possible CDU/CSU-FDP coalition . 
The [ORG FDP  ] is clearly riding on a high with double-digit successes in the state elections of [LOC Saarland  ] , [LOC Saxony  ] , and [LOC Thuringia  ] , but this may not be enough . 
The [ORG CDU  ] refuses to engage in any self-introspection after its defeats in [LOC Saarland  ] and [LOC Thuringia  ] and the party can really only take comfort from the [ORG SPD  ] 's perennial weakness . 
The fear in the [ORG CDU  ] is acute that the [PER Chancellor  ] 's high popularity ratings may not be enough to ensure a comfortable win for the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] at the parliamentary elections. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Merkel  ] , once again , vehemently denies any intention to form a [ORG Grand Coalition  ] with the [ORG SPD  ] but the electoral math on September 27 may force her -- despite intense [ORG CDU/CSU  ] reservations , not to mention those of the [MISC German  ] public -- to look at the [ORG SPD  ] as a partner . 
As for the [ORG SPD  ] , [PER Steinmeier  ] is [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001106 003 OF 003 looking desperate . 
The [ORG SPD  ] has failed to reach over 25 percent in the last six elections and [PER Steinmeier  ] 's unlikely path to the chancellorship is only possible if he reneges on a campaign promise not to form a coalition with The [ORG Left Party  ] . 
This will not happen in 2009 but the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] will not tire of raising the fear of a red-red coalition in 2009 or in <a id='par2013' href='#par2013'>¶</a>2013 . 
The [PER Chancellor  ] appears to be in a win-win situation but three weeks on the campaign trail can be an eternity .
