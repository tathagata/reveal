( C ) [PER Jozame  ] explained that he continues to inform the [ORG GOB  ] and [MISC Latin American  ] missions in [LOC Brasilia  ] about the [MISC U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] , in an attempt to combat the misinformation campaign led by [PER Chavez  ] and the other more left-leaning neighbors in the region . 
In meetings in August [PER Jozame  ] told [PER PolOff  ] he had already met with several [MISC Brazilian  ] members of [ORG Congress  ] and the leadership of the [MISC Latin American  ] missions in [LOC Brasilia  ] ( Ref A ) . 
[PER Jozame  ] said that he had recently held a meeting at the [MISC Colombian  ] Embassy with about 35 military attaches from embassies in [LOC Brasilia  ] so that he and his staff could again clarify the details of the [MISC U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] also mentioned that a [MISC Brazilian  ] congressional delegation will be traveling to [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] in November . 
According to [PER Jozame  ] , their goal in [LOC Colombia  ] is to see for themselves the bases included in the [ORG DCA  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] said he is happy the [MISC Brazilians  ] have finally taken the [MISC Colombians  ] up on the invitation to visit the bases because all they will see at the bases are " some buildings and a landing strip . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Jozame  ] shared his personal views as to why the [MISC Brazilians  ] had such a negative initial reaction to the [ORG DCA  ] , claiming that most of the problem came from the [ORG MRE  ] which is " leftist " and " anti-Yankee " and " jealous " of any other country , s leadership in the region . 
[PER Jozame  ] said that the leadership in the [ORG MRE  ] is very leftist and because of that they did not support greater cooperation between [LOC Colombia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
Also , he believes [LOC Brazil  ] is jealous because it does not like to have any issues negotiated or discussed without [LOC Brazil  ] serving in a leadership role. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Lula  ] , s open approval of the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] will make it hard for the [ORG GOB  ] to support criticism of the agreement by others in the region against the agreement . 
However , as [PER Lula  ] admitted and several [ORG GOB  ] officials have told us privately , [LOC Brazil  ] , s initial reaction was driven by the reaction of others in the region " principally [LOC Venezuela  ] " and by a perceived need to maintain " balance " and the ability to mediate between the two sides . 
This dynamic is likely to hold sway in the future , as well , regarding issues of sovereignty and the sanctity of borders .
