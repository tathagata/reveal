Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC China  ] is keen to understand the direction of [LOC U.S.  ] policy toward the [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran  ] ( [ORG IRI  ] ) and is willing to facilitate dialogue between the two sides , according to an [ORG MFA  ] official . 
[LOC China  ] remains committed to the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] process but values its bilateral engagement with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Nonetheless , the [LOC Iran  ] should not take for granted its economic relations with the [LOC PRC  ] . 
Despite [LOC PRC  ] urging that [LOC Iran  ] respond positively to [MISC American  ] overtures , initial rounds of direct talks with the [MISC Iranians  ] on the nuclear issue would be difficult , the official suggested . 
The official said that it is too soon to contemplate what actions should be taken should [LOC Iran  ] develop a nuclear weapon . 
An academic contact suggested that there is no " point of no return " on [LOC Iran  ] 's development of nuclear technology and that the [MISC Iranians  ] believe they are in a strong bargaining position should some form of new diplomatic engagement emerge . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG PolOff  ] discussed [MISC Iran-China  ] relations and the international community 's efforts to deal with the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue with Deputy Director [PER Xu Wei  ] of [ORG MFA  ] 's [MISC West Asian Affairs Department Iran Division  ] March 3 . 
[ORG PolOff  ] also met with [PER Li Guofu  ] , Director of the [ORG Center for Middle East Studies  ] at the [ORG MFA-affiliated China Institute for International Studies  ] ( [ORG CIIS  ] ) February 27 . 
[LOC China  ] Seeks Clarity on Policy Review ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] 's [PER Xu Wei  ] told [ORG PolOff  ] that [LOC China  ] was closely following the ongoing review of our [LOC Iran  ] policy . 
He said that [LOC China  ] believed that the [LOC United States  ] maintains a leadership role in the [LOC Middle East  ] and that the results of the review will have an impact on [MISC Chinese  ] engagement with the region . 
He said that [LOC Beijing  ] hoped for more clarity from the [LOC United States  ] on policy adjustments resulting from this review , adding that [LOC China  ] had been left to guess at how [LOC U.S.  ] policy might change on a very important set of shared concerns . 
In the meantime , [PER Xu  ] stressed , [LOC China  ] 's overall policy toward [LOC Iran  ] had not changed , and [LOC China  ] would continue to emphasize the importance of stability in the [LOC Middle East  ] and its opposition to the development of nuclear weapons in the region . 
[PER Xu  ] noted that additional clarity was especially important because [PER China  ] perceives several voices in the USG with different viewpoints on [LOC Iran  ] speaking publicly on the issue . 
[ORG PRC Committed  ] to [LOC P5-plus-1  ] , Willing to Facilitate Talks --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Xu  ] stressed the need to resolve the nuclear impasse through dialogue , and added that [PER China  ] remained committed to the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] process , as indicated in its support for the recent [LOC P5-plus-1  ] joint statement on [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that [LOC China  ] sincerely hoped that the outcome of our [LOC Iran  ] policy review would be direct [MISC U.S.-Iran  ] talks , and offered [LOC China  ] 's assistance in creating a channel for communication with the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
Official: [MISC PRC Effective  ] at Communicating with [LOC Tehran  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] and [LOC Iran  ] continued to enjoy " good " relations in both the political and economic realms , [PER Xu  ] said , but this did not indicate that [LOC China  ] supports all of [LOC Tehran  ] 's policies . 
He said that [LOC China  ] had developed strong communication with the [MISC Iranian  ] regime and used these channels to express to the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership the concerns of the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] and the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] over nuclear proliferation . 
[LOC Beijing  ] sought to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to play a positive role in the region , and [MISC Chinese  ] communication with [LOC Tehran  ] to that end was effective , [PER Xu  ] said , adding that [LOC Iran  ] 's cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] and the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] , though limited , was due in part to [MISC Chinese  ] intervention . 
[LOC China  ] had made clear to [LOC Iran  ] that [MISC PRC-Iran  ] economic cooperation should not be interpreted as an indication that [LOC China  ] is not serious about concerns over nuclear proliferation or about working with the international community to deal with the nuclear issue . 
Talking to [LOC Iran  ] Would Require Patience -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Xu  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] policy review had generated debate within [LOC Iran  ] over how to respond , especially over the possibility of direct dialogue . 
[LOC China  ] was urging the [MISC Iranian  ] regime to respond positively to [MISC American  ] overtures , but [PER Xu  ] said that based on his experience working on [MISC Iranian  ] issues , he believed the leadership will find it difficult to show a [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000560 002 OF 003 positive attitude in public . 
[PER Xu  ] counseled patience , saying that he was concerned that expectations in the [LOC United States  ] on how [LOC Iran  ] would respond may be too high . 
Still , he said that the issues involved were too important for the [LOC United States  ] to fail to press forward with dialogue even if any such discussions are difficult . 
" Too Soon " to Contemplate Weaponization Concerns --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Pressed on how [LOC China  ] would respond if [LOC Iran  ] developed nuclear weapons , [PER Xu  ] said that [LOC China  ] took proliferation concerns seriously and opposed such a development . 
However , he indicated that [LOC China  ] did not yet see [MISC Iranian  ] development of nuclear weapons as an immediate concern , noting that [LOC China  ] was willing to " wait and see how far [LOC Iran  ] can go " in developing nuclear technology before it would change its position . 
He added that it was still too soon to contemplate what actions should be taken should the [MISC Iranians  ] develop a nuclear weapon. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG CIIS  ] 's [PER Li Guofu  ] echoed this approach , saying that while [LOC China  ] followed the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program closely , [LOC China  ] was not 100-percent convinced that [LOC Iran  ] is pursuing nuclear weapons . 
He indicated that observers who believe there is a " point of no return " in [LOC Iran  ] 's technical development of nuclear weapons were incorrect , because the problem was fundamentally a political one and not technical . 
He said that [LOC Iran  ] was moving ahead with its nuclear program without a clear internal position on whether it would want to weaponize the technology , but added that [LOC Iran  ] hoped to bring the technology to the point where it could produce a nuclear weapon in a short period of time . 
He stressed , however , that in his view , a complicated series of steps remained between the current level of technology and the point of weaponization , including the necessity for a nuclear test . 
Such a test , he indicated , would have a profound effect on the political questions facing the international community . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Needs to Offer " Something Real " ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] said that direct [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Iran  ] would be complicated by the reality that there is little the [LOC United States  ] can offer at present that would persuade [LOC Tehran  ] to change its behavior . 
As the regime 's confidence in its own domestic legitimacy has grown , the value to the regime of normalized relations with the [LOC United States  ] has decreased . 
Similarly , security guarantees would mean little to an [MISC Iranian  ] Government convinced that it can already ensure its own security . 
[PER Li  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] side would need to be prepared to make concessions in any engagement , and would need to offer " something real . 
" [PER Li  ] sugested starting with demonstrating a position of " mutual respect . 
" [LOC Iran  ] Remains Suspicious of [LOC U.S.  ] Intentions ------------------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Based on his conversations with [MISC Iranian  ] policy-makers , [PER Li  ] said , [LOC Iran  ] remained suspicious of [LOC U.S.  ] intentions . 
He suggested that dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] should have a " symbolic " beginning to avoid a false start . 
He said that the two sides should first agree on principles not directly related to the nuclear issue . 
He suggested that if the [MISC Iranians  ] show a willingness to suspend uranium enrichment , the [LOC United States  ] should be prepared to follow up immediately with new cooperation . 
He stressed that the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership regarded itself an important player on the regional issues that concern the [LOC United States  ] , especially efforts to stabilize [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
IRI Official: Nuclear Weapon Would Be " Disastrous " --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] reported that he was told by a Deputy Foreign Minister in [LOC Tehran  ] that [LOC Iran  ] considers itself a regional power , but understands that if [LOC Iran  ] were to develop a nuclear weapon , the [LOC United States  ] would likely deploy nuclear weapons to the [MISC Persian Gulf  ] region , which would be " strategically disastrous " for [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that the official had told him [LOC Iran  ] wants to develop " nuclear capability " as a symbol of its status as a regional power . 
The official told [PER Li  ] that [LOC Iran  ] was nevertheless willing to open a dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Other Challenges to Opening a Dialogue -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] said that the atmosphere had improved for developing new engagement with [LOC Iran  ] , but obstacles remained . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00000560 003 OF 003 The regime in [LOC Tehran  ] continued to see opportunities for changing [LOC Iran  ] 's engagement with the world under the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration , and there was debate in [LOC Iran  ] on how best to respond . 
Serious debate among the [MISC Iranian  ] people on the need for a nuclear program had yet to take place , [PER Li  ] stressed , although the notion of weaponizing the results of the nuclear program continued to generate debate among the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership . 
[PER Li  ] stressed that the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership continued to dismiss the notion of [LOC U.S.  ] military action in response to its ongoing nuclear development and was convinced that suspension of uranium enrichment is not necessary for starting a " new process " with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Election Politics also a Factor ------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] said that this year 's presidential election in [LOC Iran  ] would be an important factor in the chances for meaningful talks with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Noting that the candidacy of former President [ORG Khatami  ] posed the first real challenge of the campaign to incumbent President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [PER Li  ] stressed that [ORG Khatami  ] would not have been able to announce his candidacy without explicit approval from Supreme Leader [PER Ayatollah Khamenei  ] . 
Unlike previous elections , other reformist candidates had since dropped out of the campaign , [PER Li  ] said , improving [ORG Khatami  ] 's chances . 
Still , the hard-liners had acted to overcome their internal divisions in light of the [ORG Khatami  ] candidacy , and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] remained " likely " to be re-elected . 
[PER Li  ] argued that the top-level blessing of the [ORG Khatami  ] candidacy indicated that the Supreme Leader deems [ORG Khatami  ] reliable enough and would not expect bold reforms even if [ORG Khatami  ] were elected . 
In the meantime , [PER Li  ] suggested , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] might feel the need to demonstrate his hard-line credentials in the run-up to the June election . 
[LOC PRC  ] to [MISC Iran: Don't Take Economic Cooperation  ] for Granted --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] said that [LOC China  ] continued to value development of its economic ties with [LOC Iran  ] in order to maintain economic growth . 
He noted that [MISC Chinese  ] officials told their [MISC Iranian  ] counterparts that they are frustrated with the lack of progress on the nuclear issue , progress which would create a foundation for new investment in the energy sector . 
According to [PER Li  ] , to prod the [MISC Iranians  ] to show progress on the nuclear issue , the [MISC Chinese  ] had warned them not to take [LOC China  ] 's economic interests in [LOC Iran  ] for granted . 
Furthermore , [LOC China  ] 's dependence on [MISC Iranian  ] energy is decreasing given recent improvements in [MISC Sino-Saudi  ] relations ( as evidenced by President [PER Hu  ] 's recent travel there ) and their potential to bring about increased [MISC Chinese  ] access to [MISC Saudi  ] energy supplies .
