( C ) Summary . 
PM [PER Berlusconi  ] specifically requested this meeting , and a spring address to a joint session of [ORG Congress  ] , to bolster his prospects in [LOC Italy  ] 's April elections . 
Behind in the polls and facing his toughest campaign , [PER Berlusconi  ] will juxtapose his proactive and pro-U.S.foreign policy with that of his likely center-left opponent , [PER Romano Prodi  ] , who prefers to follow an [ORG EU  ] foreign policy lead and has called for a timetable to withdraw [MISC Italian  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials are concerned about a potential terrorist attack , either during the [LOC Turin  ] Winter [MISC Olympics  ] or the spring elections. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] will seek: ( a ) presidential statements of support on shared values ; ( b ) support for extending in 2005 the [ORG UN  ] mandate on [LOC Iraq  ] ; ( c ) tangible progress on a plan to enhance [MISC Iraqi  ] security capabilities and allow a coordinated drawdown of [MISC Italian  ] forces ; and ( d ) the President 's possible intervention to waive or delay new passport requirements for continued [MISC Italian  ] participation in the [MISC Visa Waiver Program  ] . 
We should: ( a ) offer appropriate praise for [LOC Italy  ] 's foreign policy support without jeopardizing our relationship with [PER Prodi  ] ; and ( b ) engage [PER Berlusconi  ] on [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
End Summary [MISC Italian  ] Elections ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) PM [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] prides himself on his warm relationship with the President and has carefully planned this meeting and a spring address to a joint session of [ORG Congress  ] ( he meets Speaker [PER Hastert  ] before going to the [LOC White House  ] ) to bolster his prospects in [LOC Italy  ] 's national elections , tentatively scheduled for April 9 . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] 's center-right coalition is down eight points in the polls , undermined by internal leadership spats and continued economic stagnation . 
The center-left also is plagued by internal disputes but former [ORG European Commission  ] President [PER Romano Prodi  ] just won a triumphant electoral victory in the primaries . 
Pending electoral law changes may slightly increase the odds for the center-right , and it is too early to deal [PER Berlusconi  ] out . 
However , most political observers predict [PER Prodi  ] 's center-left coalition will win in April . 
[MISC Iraq:  ] Seeking a Way Forward --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We expect [PER Berlusconi  ] will juxtapose his proactive , pro-U.S. foreign policy with that of [PER Prodi  ] , who prefers to follow an [ORG EU  ] foreign policy lead and has publicly called for a timetable to withdraw [MISC Italian  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] has remained adamant that [MISC Italian  ] troops will stay in [LOC Iraq  ] until the security situation warrants , and the [MISC Iraqi  ] government requests , a drawdown of [MISC Italian  ] troops . 
The center-right has already accused [PER Prodi  ] of encouraging terrorist attacks on [LOC Italy  ] through reckless calls for withdrawal . 
However , [MISC Italian  ] public opinion remains overwhelmingly opposed to the war in [LOC Iraq  ] and [PER Berlusconi  ] will be under increasing pressure to make public statements about plans to withdraw troops . 
He will be reassured by commitments of continued high-level consultations but would better appreciate progress in enhancing [MISC Iraqi  ] security capabilities in a way that allows measured [MISC Italian  ] drawdowns by April . 
[LOC Italy  ] is also seeking an extension of the [ORG UN  ] [LOC Iraq  ] mandate by the end of the year ; the [MISC Italian  ] presence is premised on the [ORG UN  ] mandate , and Parliament will vote in January on the next six-months of funding for thier troops . 
[LOC Italy  ] also feels that the mandate extension should specifically reference political progress in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) We can and will work with a [MISC Prodi-led  ] government should the center-left win next year . 
Despite [PER Prodi  ] 's calls for a withdrawal timetable , other elements of his center-left coalition have assured us that [LOC Italy  ] will not make any dramatic [MISC Zapatero-style  ] actions and will coordinate changes in troop levels with both us and the [MISC Iraqi  ] government . 
[PER Prodi  ] himself has hinted at a compromise formula involving continued [MISC Italian  ] involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] for reconstruction initiatives . 
Strongest Ally in [LOC Continental Europe  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] will be seeking Presidential statements of support on shared values for our freedom agenda and praise for [LOC Italy  ] 's substantial commitment of resources overseas . 
In addition to being the third largest contributor of troops to [LOC MFN-I  ] , [LOC Italy  ] also funds reconstruction and justice projects in [LOC Iraq  ] , leads [ORG ISAF  ] , a PRT and a justice initiative in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , just took over [ORG KFOR  ] command , pledged $3 million to the [ORG UN Fund for Democracy  ] , indicated it will fund the new Foundation for the Future , co-hosts [ORG Democracy Assistance Dialogue  ] initiatives with [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] , and provided earthquake and hurricane relief for [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC New Orleans  ] . 
We want to provide appropriate praise without jeopardizing a potential future relationship with a center-left government . 
Budget Woes ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) High public debt , rising social welfare costs and a stagnant economy are limiting [PER Berlusconi  ] 's ability to maneuver in the face of growing domestic economic discontent . 
Pocketbook issues will drive the campaign and be [PER Berlusconi  ] 's biggest challenge , although [PER Prodi  ] has yet to offer any credible alternative economic policy . 
The draft budget now being debated by the [MISC Italian  ] Parliament must be approved by the end of the year , and it appears it will include painful cuts in many sectors . 
This includes potentially dramatic ( to about .85% of GDP ) cuts in the defense budget and a 20% reduction in the overseas deployment budget that could undermined [LOC Italy  ] 's ability to sustain its overseas commitments . 
[ORG Terrorist Threat Looms Large  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Following the [LOC London  ] bombings , the [ORG GOI  ] approved a strong anti-terrorism law and began a crackdown of arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants and suspected terrorists . 
However , [LOC Italy  ] continues to be targeted in fundamentalist websites , and many [MISC Italian  ] officials expect [LOC Italy  ] will be attacked in the near future . 
They are worried specifically about a potential attack during either the February [LOC Turin  ] [MISC Olympics  ] or the spring elections . 
We continue to work closely with the [ORG GOI  ] on security preparations and intelligence sharing for the [MISC Olympics  ] as well as on increasing readiness for possible attacks on [ORG USG  ] facilities or London/Madrid scenarios . 
[ORG UN  ] Reform/Iran/Russia/Balkans ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] is likely to thank you for [LOC U.S.  ] support in opposing the [MISC G-4  ] plan for [ORG UNSC  ] reform ; while [LOC Italy  ] 's specific concern is blocking [LOC Germany  ] from obtaining a seat , they support our view that any changes to the [ORG Security Council  ] should be based on a wide consensus of support within the [ORG UN  ] . 
As [LOC Iran  ] 's largest [MISC European  ] trading partner , [LOC Italy  ] remains concerned that it has been excluded from the [MISC EU-3  ] negotiations and complains that the [MISC EU-3  ] has not sufficiently consulted other [ORG EU  ] member states . 
[LOC Italy  ] shares our concern about proliferation and supports moving the issue to the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
Overall , however , [LOC Italy  ] favors engagement over confrontation and will be concerned about the economic losses associated with potential sanctions . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Putin  ] remain good friends , and [PER Berlusconi  ] continues to insist he has delivered our messages of concern about [PER Putin  ] 's increasingly anti-democratic actions . 
Another nudge from the President would strengthen our message . 
[LOC Italy  ] remains fully engaged on the [LOC Balkans  ] and supports a continued international presence in [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] until there is international consensus that both entities have made sufficient progress on democratic reforms . 
The candidacy of [LOC Amb  ] . 
[PER Laura Mirachian  ] for the post of the High Representative in [LOC Bosnia  ] is of key interest to the [MISC Italians  ] . 
They have lobbied strongly for [ORG USG  ] support , arguing that [LOC Italy  ] 's high military profile deserves an equally strong policy voice . 
Department and [ORG Embassy  ] officers who have met with [PER Mirachian  ] believe she shares our outlook for the future of the region . 
While she has not received official [ORG USG  ] support at this point , the [ORG USG  ] does not want to be seen as opposing her candidacy , since she could emerge as the front-runner . 
[ORG Visa Waiver Program  ] ------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG DHS  ] has confirmed that there will be no blanket waiver , no official policy favoring parole , and no exceptions to the October 26 , 2005 requirement for digitized photos in passports for any beneficiary of the [ORG Visa Waiver Program  ] ( [ORG VWP  ] ) . 
The [ORG GOI  ] plans to issue machine readable passports with digitized photographs in five [MISC Italian  ] [PER Prefectures: Rome  ] , [LOC Milan  ] , [LOC Naples  ] , [LOC Palermo  ] and [LOC Cagliari  ] , with the possibility of successive extension to other Prefectures . 
[MISC Italians  ] who obtain passports after October 26 from Prefectures other than these five offices , or who obtain passports from an [MISC Italian  ] Consulate abroad , will require a [LOC U.S.  ] visa . 
[LOC U.S.  ] consular sections in [LOC Italy  ] are working with airlines and travel agencies to ensure that [MISC Italian  ] passengers caught unaware of the change in visa requirements are directed to the closest [ORG Embassy  ] or Consulate for expeditious visa processing. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) President [PER Ciampi  ] , FM [PER Fini  ] and senior aides to PM [PER Berlusconi  ] have all raised the [ORG VWP  ] issue with the Ambassador , insisting that the new requirements will be a major embarrassment to [PER Berlusconi  ] just when he is trying to use his [LOC U.S.  ] connections to improve his election prospects . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] may ask the President to intervene to fix the problem , arguing that [LOC Italy  ] is a staunch partner in the war on terror and is in the process of implementing previously announced [LOC U.S.  ] requirements for biometric passports .
