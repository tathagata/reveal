( [ORG SBU  ] ) This cable is in response to reftel . 
We will also keep the questions in mind as we continue to meet with relevant contacts. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG QUESTION  ] A: ARE CHURCH OFFICIALS CULTIVATING CUBAN PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS DOCTORS , ENGINEERS , ACCOUNTANTS , PROJECT DIRECTORS , [ORG ETC  ] ? 
IF SO , HOW ? 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF COURTING PROFESSIONALS ? 
WHO IS DIRECTING THIS APPROACH ? 
ARE THESE ACTIVITIES COORDINATED FROM THE CHURCH HIERARCHY , OR DESIGNED INDEPENDENTLY BY PARISHES ? ( [ORG C/NF  ] ) POST RESPONSE: We do not see evidence of such targeted proselytizing . 
The church hierarchy , from the Cardinal on down to parish priests , complains that emigration decimates the ranks of the laity and that they have to engage in constant recruitment merely to replace those laity who emigrate . 
We have no reason to believe that those efforts target professionals in particular. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG QUESTION  ] B: ARE CHURCH MEMBERS RUNNING PROFESSIONAL TRAINING CLASSES ? 
IF SO , WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING ARE PARISHES PROVIDING ( I.E. FOREIGN LANGUAGES , CRITICAL THINKING , BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND DELEGATION , WESTERN PHILOSOPHY , WESTERN POLITICAL THOUGHT , PUBLIC SPEAKING , [ORG ETC  ] . 
) ? ( [ORG C/NF  ] ) POST RESPONSE: We have seen several examples of parishes and at least one convent that provide training in computers and foreign languages . 
( Note: denominations have similar activities . 
End Note . 
) XXXXXXXXXXXX also tells us he does some training at his parish in [LOC Santiago de Cuba  ] . 
Computer training is the most common . 
The [LOC San Juan de Letran  ] church in [LOC Vedado  ] has a monthly lecture series on theological issues that attracts 100 or more , mainly university-age , participants . 
The Mission to the Order of [LOC Malta  ] provides equipment ( projector , video camera , etc . 
) for some workshops promoting spiritual cinema . 
Otherwise , we are not familiar with churches that run the type of courses mentioned in reftel. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG QUESTION  ] C: ARE LOWER-LEVEL [MISC CUBAN  ] CLERGY AND LAY PEOPLE PROVIDING TRAINING AND/OR CONDUCTING ACTIVITIES NOT APPROVED BY THE HIERARCHY ? 
HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE IDENTIFIED ? 
THROUGH CHURCH ACTIVITIES ? 
FROM SCHOOLS ? 
ARE INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT PREVIOUS ENTREPRENEURIAL OR POLITICAL SKILLS BEING TRAINED ? 
HOW LONG HAVE THESE ACTIVITIES BEEN TAKING PLACE ? ( [ORG C/NF  ] ) POST RESPONSE: The classes of which we are aware are offered to all parishioners on a first-come , first-served basis . 
These are mostly modest efforts . 
These programs go back at least several years . 
Our experience with contacts is that these programs are known to the Church hierarchy and that in many cases the hierarchy provides " cover " for such activities with the relevant Government of [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) authorities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG QUESTION  ] D: DOES ANY EVIDENCE EXIST TO SUGGEST THAT THE [MISC CATHOLIC  ] CHURCH IS SEEKING TO MEDIATE A DIALOGUE IN CUBA'S CURRENT POLITICAL CONTEXT BETWEEN INDEPENDENT CIVIL SOCIETY AND STATE-ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUALS BY " HOSTING " INTERVIEWS WITH THE LATTER GROUP IN CHURCH PUBLICATIONS--SUCH AS THE HAVANA ARCHDIOCESAN MAGAZINE [PER ESPACIO LAICAL  ] ( E.G. THE 2009 ISSUE NUMBER ONE ARTICLES INVOLVING ECONOMIST OMAR EVERLENY PEREZ AND POLITICAL SCIENTIST [PER CARLOS ALZUGARAY  ] ) ? ( [ORG C/NF  ] ) POST RESPONSE: We 've seen articles as described in reftel in both Espacio Laical and in [LOC Palabra Nueva  ] , which recently ran a two-part series that essentially was a point/counterpoint between [PER Orlando Marquez  ] of [LOC Palabra Nueva  ] and [PER Rafael Hernandez  ] , the editor of [LOC Temas  ] . 
Post believes these articles are oriented toward creating space and legitimacy for the [MISC Catholic  ] Church as a legitimate interlocutor in [MISC Cuban  ] societal issues and are not aimed at fostering a broader debate between [MISC GOC-affiliated  ] intellectuals and broader civil society . 
In fact , we have not seen any evidence that the [MISC Catholic  ] Church is specifically reaching out to independent civil society in [LOC Cuba.  ] -------- Comments -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The [MISC Catholic  ] Church is slowly increasing the scope of the activities it is willing and able to conduct in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The relief work of [ORG Caritas  ] and various parishes after the 2008 hurricanes has earned the [ORG Church  ] some additional street credibility . 
Some parishes also offer soup kitchens , medicines , and some form of parochial education for children , all of which are at risk since they technically compete with the [MISC Cuban  ] Government 's desire for complete control over the provision of social services . 
The Church goes to great lengths to keep a low profile and stay out of any public discussions that may be deemed political , or certainly counter-revolutionary . 
For years , the [ORG Church  ] has worked to distance itself from well-known opposition figures who are also devout [MISC Catholics  ] such as [PER Oswaldo Paya  ] and [PER Dagoberto Valdes  ] . 
As such , any activities the [ORG Church  ] may be carrying out to prepare for a post-Castro [LOC Cuba  ] are not being shared either from the pulpit or in our private discussions with Church officials .
