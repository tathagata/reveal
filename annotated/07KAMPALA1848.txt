( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary: Post  ] has considered reftel [LOC Horn of Africa  ] MANPADS Acquisition Engagement and [ORG Plan of Action Strategy for Uganda  ] . 
Mechanisms proposed to help the [ORG GOU  ] address counter-proliferation and destruction are feasible and timely . 
Post is confident that the [ORG GOU  ] would welcome greater [ORG USG  ] involvement . 
We have also determined that a [MISC Yemen-like  ] acquisition plan could support [ORG GOU  ] efforts to control [ORG MANPADS  ] proliferation , but do not believe it to be necessary at this point . 
There are no political impediments to immediate engagement with [ORG GOU  ] officials on the proposed [ORG MANPADS  ] strategy . 
A sucessful strategy would incorporate a larger weapons accountability and destruction program to enlist wider [ORG GOU  ] support for [ORG MANPADS  ] destruction . 
End Summary. ----------------------------------------- [ORG GOU  ] Shares Counter-Proliferation Concerns ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOU  ] has demonstrated its willingness to work with the [ORG USG  ] to combat terrorism and further [MISC East African  ] security initiatives , particularly in the area of weapons proliferation . 
Military and civilian authorities , starting with the establishment of the [ORG National Focal Point  ] on [ORG Small Arms and Light Weapons  ] in 2001 , have deepened collaboration to tighten arms control regulations and have actively sought international partners to advance objectives . 
We therefore believe that the [ORG GOU  ] would be receptive to [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in drafting export control legislation and determining priorities . 
Given that the majority of the [ORG MANPADS  ] currently in [LOC Uganda  ] were purchased by the government , [LOC U.S.  ] intervention with the “supply country” might not be welcomed by the [ORG GOU  ] . 
Such action would be considered by some as meddling in internal security matters. --------------------------------------------- -------------- [ORG GOU  ] Committed to SA/LW DESTRUCTION ; Open to [LOC U.S.  ] Engagement --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOU  ] in 2007 worked with [LOC SaferAfrica  ] , [ORG UNDP  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , and other international partners to identify and destroy small arms and light weapons stockpiles , including [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Crispus Kiyonga  ] reaffirmed this commitment publicly , and expressed Uganda’s desire to work with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other international partners to meet the country’s obligations under the [ORG UN Program of Action  ] on [ORG Small Arms and Light Weapons  ] , the [ORG Nairobi Protocol  ] , and the [ORG National Action Plan  ] on [ORG Small Arms and Light Weapons  ] . 
We believe that the [ORG GOU  ] would welcome greater [LOC U.S.  ] engagement in the area of stockpile management and destruction . 
However , a more broadly focused assistance package that helps with overall weapons accountability and destruction would likely garner wider [ORG GOU  ] support. -------------------------- [ORG Yemen Acquisition Possible  ] -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A [MISC Yemen-like  ] acquisition plan could be reached with the [ORG GOU  ] . 
The primary [MISC Ugandan  ] counterpart would be the [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG People’s Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG UPDF  ] ) . 
Currently , we do not believe there is black market activity to warrant such a program. ----------------------- Timing And [ORG GOU Partners  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOU  ] has demonstrated political will to tighten arms proliferation , combat global terrorism , and push forward on [LOC East Africa  ] peace and security initiatives . 
This commitment suggests that [LOC Uganda  ] would be open to immediate engagement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The primary [ORG GOU  ] interlocutors would likely be the following: --Ministry of [MISC Defense  ] ; --Uganda [ORG People’s Defense Force  ] ( [ORG UPDF  ] ) ; --National Focal [ORG Point  ] on [ORG Small Arms and Light Weapons  ] ; [ORG --Parliament’s Committee  ] on Military and [ORG Internal Affairs  ] ; and [ORG KAMPALA  ] 00001848 002 OF 002 --Ministry of Foreign Affairs. --------------------------------------------- ---- Pitfalls OR Challenges to Strategy Implementation --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC GOU’s  ] military sales relationship with [LOC North Korea  ] might hinder engagement . 
For three years , the [ORG GOU  ] has refused to allow us access to its classified budget , which could potentially include the sale of [ORG MANPADS  ] by the [ORG GOU  ] .
