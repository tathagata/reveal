Summary . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Government officials praised [ORG U.S. Government  ] willingness to brief them regularly on developments in the financial sector , particularly given their exposure to [MISC GSE  ] debt . 
Although the direct exposure of [MISC Chinese  ] firms to other troubled financial institutions is limited , most [LOC Beijing  ] officials and academics expressed concern about the adverse impact on [LOC U.S.  ] domestic demand and global market sentiment . 
Several officials noted [LOC China  ] 's desire to deploy its foreign assets in a way that promotes financial stability , but foreign exchange managers remain cautious about risky investments and uncertain as to whether they can overcome [LOC U.S.  ] regulatory barriers and perceived [LOC U.S.  ] political resistance to greater [MISC Chinese  ] investment in [LOC U.S.  ] financial institutions . 
The crisis has driven home the fact that [LOC China  ] is now integrated into the world economy , leading to some comments in the popular media that it should seek to insulate itself . 
Others have blamed the [LOC United States  ] for exporting the cost of recovery to the world , or even causing the crisis itself . 
These views , however , have been characterized as " extreme " and have not been espoused by mainstream media , officials or academics . 
End Summary . 
Officials Welcome Explanations ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Central Government  ] officials expressed appreciation for [ORG USG  ] efforts to explain the details of plans to handle troubled [MISC American  ] financial institutions . 
They have been particularly interested in [ORG Fannie Mae  ] and [ORG Freddie Mac  ] ( see ref E ) . 
( Note: The [ORG State Administration for Foreign Exchange  ] holds about half a trillion dollars of [ORG Fannie Mae  ] and [ORG Freddie Mac  ] debt . 
A combined [PER Treasury/Morgan Stanley  ] team briefed officials from the [ORG State Administration of Foreign Exchange  ] ( [ORG SAFE  ] ) , [ORG China Investment Corporation  ] ( [ORG CIC  ] ) , the [ORG People 's Bank of China  ] ( [ORG PBOC  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] ( [ORG MOF  ] ) , [ORG China Banking and Regulatory Commission  ] ( [ORG CBRC  ] ) , Industrial and [ORG Commercial Bank of China  ] ( [ORG ICBC  ] ) and the [ORG Agricultural Bank of China  ] ( [ORG ABC  ] ) on the situation surrounding [ORG Fannie Mae  ] and [ORG Freddie Mac  ] . 
Treasury Under Secretary [PER McCormick  ] has called counterparts at the [ORG SAFE  ] , [ORG PBOC  ] , [ORG CBRC  ] and [ORG MOF  ] . 
Embassy officials have also discussed the bailout with academics at the [ORG Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  ] ( [ORG CASS  ] ) and the [ORG National Development Reform Commission  ] ( [ORG NDRC  ] ) . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While noting that [LOC China  ] 's direct exposure to other troubled private institutions is limited ( see ref B and C ) , [MISC Chinese  ] officials have praised the [ORG USG  ] 's willingness to keep the [MISC Chinese  ] Government constantly apprised of current actions . 
Vice Premier [PER Wang Qishan  ] told Secretary [PER Paulson  ] in a phone conversation that [LOC China  ] appreciates and supports all of the measures the [ORG U.S. Government  ] has taken , and also Under Secretary [PER McCormick  ] 's efforts to reach out to [ORG CIC  ] , [ORG PBOC  ] and [ORG SAFE  ] . 
Prominent [ORG NDRC  ] economist [PER Xia Bin  ] noted that , because of ties built during the [ORG Strategic Economic Dialogue  ] ( [ORG SED  ] ) , [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] officials are now able to pick up the phone and talk to each other in order to coordinate responses to economic crises . 
[ORG China Response  ] -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Chinese  ] official media reported that President [PER Hu Jintao  ] expressed hope that [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003662 002 OF 005 Government efforts would succeed in stabilizing the [LOC U.S.  ] financial system , which he said would be in the interests of both the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
In a private conversation with Treasury Secretary [PER Paulson  ] , Vice Premier [PER Wang  ] stated very clearly that [LOC China  ] will do whatever it can to help , but this must be done on the basis of the " win-win " principle and be mutually beneficial . 
[ORG MOF  ] officials similarly told Embassy officials that they stand ready to assist if necessary , asking if there was anything they should do. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] academics echoed this response . 
A [ORG CASS  ] economist in the [ORG Economic Research office  ] had a very positive view of the [ORG USG  ] 's response to the financial crisis . 
Although [LOC U.S.  ] measures to " rescue " the financial markets were certainly motivated by [LOC U.S.  ] self-interest , he said [LOC China  ] and other countries should nevertheless cooperate with the [LOC United States  ] , as this is a situation that will impact everyone given the extent of globalization . 
The [ORG USG  ] acted " responsibly " by signaling to the international community that the [LOC United States  ] will use all of its assets to reduce the current market difficulties , he emphasized . 
Should [LOC China  ] " Buy [MISC American  ] " --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A few observers have noted that [LOC China  ] , both through official and commercial financial institutions , has the foreign assets to rescue troubled [LOC U.S.  ] financial firms . 
[ORG China Securities Regulatory Commission  ] ( [ORG CSRC  ] ) International Affairs Director General [PER Tong Daochi  ] asked whether the [LOC United States  ] would be receptive towards [MISC Chinese  ] firms taking large stakes in [LOC U.S.  ] financial firms , both from a regulatory and more importantly political perspective . 
[ORG China Export-Import Bank  ] Chairman [PER Li Ruogu  ] also commented to an Embassy official that [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to stabilize financial markets should be done in cooperation with [LOC China  ] and utilize [LOC China  ] 's large reserves of capital. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CIC  ] Deputy General Manager [PER Jessie Wang  ] , however , said that given losses on high profile investments in the [LOC U.S.  ] financial sector to date ( e.g . 
[ORG Blackstone  ] ) , [LOC China  ] 's [ORG State Council  ] is being more cautious about letting [MISC Chinese  ] firms invest abroad in the financial sector . 
[MISC Chinese  ] firms are cautious , despite low prices , because they see [LOC U.S.  ] investors , who have a greater understanding of risks , hesitating . 
Concern Over Broader Impact --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although [MISC Chinese  ] officials point out that [MISC Chinese  ] firms have little direct exposure to [LOC U.S.  ] financial institutions beyond the [MISC GSEs  ] , many note that continued financial stress will adversely impact [LOC U.S.  ] domestic demand and result in lower growth for [LOC China  ] . 
[ORG CSRC  ] 's [PER Tong  ] said the [MISC Chinese  ] side is concerned about the impact on the real economy and demand for [MISC Chinese  ] exports . 
There is also an additional psychological impact , as a weak [LOC U.S.  ] economy and financial markets could depress [MISC Chinese  ] investor sentiment. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A [ORG CASS  ] industrial economist said the [LOC US  ] financial bailout is definitely affecting [MISC Chinese  ] industrial sectors which have higher ratios of export dependency . 
He noted , however , that the media has exaggerated the [LOC U.S.  ] financial bailout 's impact on [LOC China  ] . 
He said that industrial production was already slowing for a variety of reasons independent of overseas demand . 
Reform Threatened ? ------------------ [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003662 003 OF 005 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Many officials have noted that the global economic situation may reduce support for continued market reform , particularly in the financial sector . 
Next month 's Third Plenum of the [ORG Communist Party  ] 's 17th [ORG Central Committee  ] is expected to address major macroeconomic issues such as rebalancing the economy away from an excessive reliance on exports and towards increasing rural incomes . 
A [ORG CASS  ] foreign policy academic noted that the Government 's ability to do so will be hindered , however , if the current crisis dramatically impacts [MISC Chinese  ] exports now. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The academic said that the [LOC West  ] has been pressing for further reform and opening of the [ORG PRC  ] 's financial markets . 
But the current crisis has sparked a significant debate within [LOC China  ] , with some arguing that the ongoing financial troubles demonstrate that [LOC China  ] should not integrate with or open further to the international financial system . 
Others , however , are arguing that [LOC China  ] , like its national basketball team , has no choice but to open itself further to international competition , particularly if it is to remain competitive globally. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding specific reforms , [LOC China  ] will certainly proceed cautiously in the next few months with financial deregulation . 
[ORG CSRC  ] Assistant Chairman [PER Jiang Yang  ] announced last week that [LOC China  ] will proceed " safely " with futures market innovations , and they will be more cautious regarding arrangements for stock index futures . 
Many officials are still supporting innovation . 
[ORG PBOC Survey and Statistics Department Director General  ] [PER Zhang Tao  ] told reporters that his lesson from the [LOC U.S.  ] crisis was that market supervisors did not monitor markets . 
He proposed that [LOC China  ] improve its financial supervision , but should not abandon developing a mortgage-backed securities market . 
More Active Government Role in Markets Considered --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CASS  ] foreign policy scholar noted that , in recent years the [MISC Chinese  ] Government has been reluctant to intervene aggressively in [LOC China  ] 's stock and real estate markets . 
After witnessing the [ORG USG  ] 's massive intervention in these same sectors , however , some [MISC Chinese  ] officials and scholars are reconsidering the role [LOC Beijing  ] should play. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some observers have countered the call for a more activist [MISC Chinese  ] Government approach to markets . 
[PER Hu Shili  ] , Editor of the respected economic weekly Caijing , published an editorial stating that " the [LOC U.S.  ] bailout has nothing in common with a wished-for shoring up of the [MISC Chinese  ] property market.. . 
There are no signs that property market risks are spreading to other institutions . 
" [ORG CSRC  ] 's [PER Tong  ] said the recent moves by the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] gave [ORG CSRC  ] cover to intervene in the market as part of global actions without increasing expectations for future intervention ( see refs A and B ) . 
[LOC China  ] Tied In ------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC America  ] 's financial woes have driven home to many [MISC Chinese  ] academics and officials exactly how involved [LOC China  ] is in the global economy . 
The [ORG CASS  ] foreign policy scholar , who admintted he is not normally involved in economic issues noted that , after 30 years of reform , [LOC China  ] 's integration into the world economy means that [LOC China  ] undoubtedly will be affected by the current [LOC U.S.  ] financial crisis . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00003662 004.2 OF 005 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A [ORG CASS  ] international economist , however , was not daunted by that integration , and was highly confident in [LOC China  ] 's ability to confront this crisis . 
" Nothing is impossible in [LOC China  ] , " he said , noting that the [ORG PRC  ] Party-State is , after all , the system that threw tremendous resources at confronting the massive snowstorms and the [LOC Sichuan  ] earthquake earlier this year , not to mention pulling off a spectacular [MISC Olympics  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] system can handle the shocks produced by this crisis , he averred . 
A New Model ----------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some popular media and blogs have called for [LOC China  ] to try to extricate itself from this dependence on foreign markets . 
The official [ORG People 's Daily  ] , in an overseas edition editorial by [PER Shi Jianxun  ] , states that the " sub-prime crisis has exposed immense gaps in the [LOC United States'  ] financial oversight and supervision... the world urgently needs to create a diversified currency and financial system and fair and just financial order that is not dependent on the [LOC United States  ] . 
" [LOC U.S.  ] Image ---------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although most [MISC Chinese  ] reporting on the crisis has been fairly straightforward , some media reports blamed the [LOC United States  ] for making mistakes and then forcing the rest of the world to bear the costs . 
For example , the official [ORG Communist Party  ] international news publication Global Times ( widely recognized for its nationalist views ) on September 17 reported that " the whole world is bearing the price of the [LOC U.S.  ] financial crisis.. . 
[LOC U.S.  ] national egotism , which uses the [LOC U.S.  ] dollar 's hegemonic position to exploit the world , is the primary cause of the crisis . 
" <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most media and academic experts dismissed this rhetoric . 
The September 22 edition of the [ORG International Herald Leader  ] commented , " The [LOC U.S.  ] economic position is unchallengeable... . 
[LOC U.S.  ] vitality is experiencing some challenges . 
Whether or not the [LOC U.S.  ] will fall depends on how effectively it adjusts its hegemonic mold , acclimating to the world . 
" The [ORG CASS  ] foreign policy academic did not think the crisis would harm the image of the [LOC United States  ] in the region . 
He had no sense that people were questioning the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's leadership role or its trustworthiness . 
He had heard no one comparing the current crisis to the 1998 [MISC Asian  ] financial crisis , arguing that the parallel people here are drawing is to 1929 -- and the obvious desire to avoid that outcome -- not 1998. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CASS  ] international economist noted that there were some academics arguing that the [LOC United States  ] was itself behind the current crisis and is now attempting to force the burden caused by it on the rest of the world . 
However , he characterized these views as " extreme " and said they were held only by a minority of " leftists . 
" <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] business has certainly lost some confidence in [LOC U.S.  ] financial institutions , with one investor stating that [LOC U.S.  ] financial operators had failed to accurately assess risk . 
An [MISC American  ] working in [LOC Beijing  ] at a major firm handling overseas IPOs , however , still thought that once stability returns to the markets , the [LOC U.S.  ] exchanges will be the premier place for [MISC Chinese  ] companies to list . 
Comment [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003662 005 OF 005 ------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most [MISC Chinese  ] officials , academics , and the official media have publicly and privately supported the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to restoring confidence in [LOC U.S.  ] financial markets . 
They have been especially thankful for timely and frequent personal briefings on [LOC U.S.  ] government actions . 
[MISC Chinese  ] officials' statements have been extremely disciplined , sticking to a few safe talking points generally endorsing moves that will enhance stability and letting [ORG PBOC  ] Governor [PER Zhou take  ] the lead . 
Several financial officials acknowledge that [LOC China  ] 's official reserves are too large to meaningfully reallocate assets without adversely impacting the value of its investments . 
For the time being , [LOC Beijing  ] appears unlikely to make any dramatic decisions regarding their approach to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over time , as markets stabilize , the events of the last month may strengthen the hand of opinion leaders advocating a more diversified and independent approach to international economic and financial engagement that involves a larger role for [LOC China  ] . 
A [MISC Japanese  ] central banker recently said that [MISC Chinese  ] officials have approached him about etablishing a " yuan-yen " basis for trading in [LOC Asia  ] . 
MOF officials have stressed how existing international financial institutions , such as the [ORG IMF  ] , appear to be increasingly irrelevant in dealing with global economic problems. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The downturn in the [LOC U.S.  ] economy is likely to spur efforts by [MISC Chinese  ] firms to continue to diversify their exports markets . 
Moreover , as [MISC Chinese  ] firms become increasingly export oriented and established in overseas markets , [LOC China  ] 's economic and financial integration with , and its vulnerability to changes in , the global economy will continue to increase , irrespective of government policies . 
And despite the public rhetoric about the need to reduce their dependence on the [LOC U.S.  ] financial system and policies , [MISC Chinese  ] authorities do not yet appear prepared to adopt the main reforms needed to achieve this , namely de-linking the [ORG RMB  ] from the [LOC U.S.  ] dollar , which would allow [LOC China  ] to have a more independent monetary policy , and allowing unhindered capital flows , so the [ORG RMB  ] can be used as the basis for international trade and financial transactions .
