On [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Karzai  ] expressed the hope that [PER Musharraf  ] , s extra-constitutional approach will work , but it was not clear to [PER Karzai  ] that [PER Musharraf  ] is ready to follow through in the short term on elections and a deal with [PER Benizir Bhutto  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] welcomed the prospect of a visit by [ORG SecDef Gates  ] before the end of the year . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) USDP [PER Edelman  ] , accompanied by Ambassador [PER Wood  ] , called on President [PER Karzai  ] on November 7 . 
[PER Karzai  ] was accompanied by Defense Minister [LOC Wardak  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] , and two staff . 
[PER Edelman  ] and [PER Wood  ] were accompanied by DASD Shivers , Deputy Commander of the [ORG Combined Security Transition Command  ] - [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [MISC CSTC-A  ] ) BG [PER George  ] , two OSD staffers and an Embassy notetaker . 
[MISC Baghlan Bombing: FBI Assistance  ] Welcomed ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Edelman  ] opened by expressing his deepest condolences for the victims of the November 6 bomb attack in [LOC Baghlan Province  ] that killed six parliamentarians and up to 40 other victims , including as many as 15 children . 
( NOTE: An authoritative assessment of casualties was not available at the time of the meeting . 
) Clearly shaken by the tragedy , [PER Karzai  ] described it as a terrible and sad event and noted that the basic facts of the attack were still under investigation . 
He recalled briefly the names and his personal association with most of the six murdered parliamentarians and expressed concern for the security of a parliamentarian still hospitalized . 
In response to [PER Edelman  ] , s question , [PER Karzai  ] affirmed his conviction that if initial reports that this was a suicide attack are confirmed , it was definitely the work of the [ORG Taliban  ] , which had carried out many other such attacks , e.g. , in [LOC Kandahar.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Later in the conversation , [PER Karzai  ] said he wanted the [LOC U.S.  ] to help out with the investigation , and he welcomed Ambassador [PER Wood  ] , s offer to request [ORG FBI  ] assistance with the investigation of the bombing . 
[PER Karzai  ] offered to include [LOC U.S.  ] personnel in the [MISC IRoA  ] delegation being dispatched to investigate the attack site , led by Interior Minister [PER Zarar  ] and including Parliamentary security representatives and the [ORG National Directorate for Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) . 
An Opportunity for [ORG National Unity and Decisive Action  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Edelman  ] observed that the [LOC Baghlan  ] bombing also presented an opportunity to stress national unity and rejection of terrorism . 
[PER Wood  ] added that this is an opportunity to bring the [MISC Afghan  ] people together not only to [LOC KABUL  ] 00003800 002 OF 004 mourn the victims but also to affirm a confident outlook for the future . 
In spite of [PER Karzai  ] , s difficult relations with Parliamentary Speaker and political rival [PER Qanooni  ] , [PER Wood  ] pointed out that [PER Qanooni  ] is making unifying statements , e.g. , supportive of [MISC IRoA  ] security measures for the Parliamentary delegation visiting [LOC Baghlan  ] ; he is not using the occasion to seek to divide the nation for personal political gain . 
[PER Karzai  ] and [PER Qanooni  ] should join in bringing the nation together and use this as a basis for renewed , decisive action to counter the insurgency and take the hard decisions needed to advance good governance goals . 
[LOC Iran  ] ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In this regard , [PER Edelman  ] noted the military situation in [PER Farah Province  ] and asked [PER Karzai  ] whether there might be an [MISC Iranian  ] hand behind recent [ORG Taliban  ] attacks . 
[PER Edelman  ] recalled maps of the myriad smuggling routes from [LOC Iran  ] into [LOC Afghanistan  ] and reports of [ORG Taliban  ] recruits training at sites in [LOC Iran  ] , although there was no concrete evidence of direct [MISC Iranian  ] involvement . 
He added that ISAF Commander GEN [PER McNeill  ] will want to respond , and he will be seeking to work with [PER Karzai  ] on an effective military strategy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] agreed that [LOC Iran  ] is “busy.” It is seeking to undermine the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and it is trying to undermine development and reconstruction in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] asserted that [LOC Iran  ] is bothered that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is becoming an important transit hub for the region , and it wants to forestall [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC Indian  ] natural gas imports from [LOC Central Asia  ] in order to protect its own market. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Edelman  ] asked how best to deal with [LOC Iran  ] . 
The explosively-formed projectile weapons ( EFPs ) intercepted by [MISC British  ] troops are worrying ; even small numbers , if effectively employed against a small [PER Ally  ] such as the [MISC Dutch  ] , could have a strategic effect . 
EFPs have been a major cause of [LOC U.S.  ] casualties in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Reports of [MISC MANPADS  ] coming out of [LOC Iran  ] are also of concern . 
Recalling his conversation with [PER Karzai  ] in March on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Edelman  ] said [MISC Iranian  ] meddling is getting increasingly lethal . 
He appreciated this was a complicated issue and that [LOC Afghanistan  ] wants to avoid a two-front war , but [MISC Iranian  ] actions , if not checked , will result in a two-front war in any event . 
We need to work together to put the [MISC Iranians  ] back on their heels , adding that the [ORG USG  ] is implementing new financial sanctions on the [ORG IRCG Quds Force  ] . 
[MISC Iranian  ] lethal assistance to the [ORG Taliban  ] must be stopped before it reaches the levels of similar assistance to insurgents in [LOC Iraq  ] ; [PER Edelman  ] underscored that we need to make clear that [MISC Iranian  ] support for the [ORG Taliban  ] is equally dangerous to [LOC Tehran  ] and [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] agreed that [LOC Iran  ] has to be confronted , adding without elaboration that we need to do so “effectively.” They are supporting those who are killing [MISC Afghan  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] personnel , so we cannot keep quiet , he said . 
[PER Edelman  ] agreed that pressure is what the [MISC Iranians  ] understand . 
The [MISC British  ] and [MISC French  ] are with us ; we need to bring the [MISC Germans  ] along . 
Without going into detail , [PER Karzai  ] said he discussed [LOC Iran  ] with Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] when she visited [LOC Afghanistan  ] last week . 
Governance and Counternarcotics ------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Edelman  ] said the perception in [LOC Washington  ] is that [MISC Afghan  ] and ISAF forces have had tactical successes in disrupting the [ORG Taliban  ] , and [ORG Congress  ] has appropriated significant new funding to sustain the train-and-equip programs for the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] and [ORG Afghan National Police  ] . 
He noted that [ORG Congressional  ] committees plan to hold hearings in the near future on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and will be asking [LOC KABUL  ] 00003800 003 OF 004 what the [MISC IRoA  ] and [ORG USG  ] are doing to take advantage of the tactical successes to advance police training and reform , extend governance to the provincial and local levels , create economic opportunity and counter the narcotics trade . 
Interest in counternarcotics action will become particularly acute in the wake of the [ORG UN  ] report on record poppy crops during the last growing season . 
[LOC Musa Qala  ] and [LOC Airpower  ] ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] responded by highlighting public frustration in parts of [ORG Helmand Province  ] with [ORG Taliban  ] control . 
He recounted a recent phone call he received from a tribal chief in [LOC Helmand  ] urging that [MISC Afghan  ] and ISAF forces launch an attack on the [LOC Musa Qala  ] District center . 
[PER Karzai  ] said there are 300 shops that sell opium paste and 65 heroin labs in [LOC Musa Qala  ] . 
He added that the people are sick and tired of the situation and want to be liberated . 
[PER Karzai  ] said that [LOC Helmand  ] must be liberated in order to stop poppy production . 
In response to [LOC Edleman  ] , s observations about recent polling results showing significant public opinion against poppy cultivation and trafficking , [PER Karzai  ] said the [MISC Afghan  ] people want a better , honest government , and they support the international community , s presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The point , he added , is to use this opportunity properly . 
The more we can bring security to the people and force the [ORG Taliban  ] out , the better. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Wood  ] noted that GEN [PER McNeill  ] is developing a plan for [LOC Musa Qala  ] , but it will likely require air power , which in the past has created political issues due to unintended civilian casualties . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed that the plan would have to be discussed , but he reiterated that the people in [LOC Musa Qala  ] are fed up , and we need to act . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] -------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] emphasized that the issue of [ORG Taliban  ] sanctuary in [LOC Pakistan  ] has to be solved , noting with dismay that the [ORG Taliban  ] flag has been raised in three districts in the [LOC FATA  ] . 
He observed that while [LOC Afghanistan  ] has a national identity and a weak state , [LOC Pakistan  ] has a strong state with no coherent national identity . 
Noting that he had discussed [LOC Pakistan  ] in his November 7 telephone call with President [PER Bush  ] , [PER Karzai  ] expressed the hope that [MISC Musharraf’s  ] imposition of extra-constitutional rule will work ; [PER Musharraf  ] must be sincere because he has no further room for “more games.” <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Edelman  ] noted that [ORG U.S.-Pakistan Defense Consultative Group  ] ( [ORG DCG  ] ) talks were postponed to underscore [LOC U.S.  ] dissatisfaction with the imposition of the [ORG Provisional Constitution Order  ] ; it was also not clear that our [MISC Pakistani  ] interlocutors would be able to focus on the [ORG DCG  ] agenda , given the current political turmoil . 
The [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] share an interest in [MISC Pakistani  ] authorities moving against terrorist sanctuaries and the [ORG Taliban  ] , s [ORG Quetta Shura  ] ; arresting lawyers will not help in this regard . 
We are urging [PER Musharraf  ] to focus on keeping to the election schedule , completing the deal with [PER Bhutto  ] , and taking off his uniform . 
Although there are special interests that are seeking to extend the period for martial law , it must be kept short . 
If not , [MISC Musharraf’s  ] interests and those of the [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Army  ] may begin to diverge . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed the situation is complicated . 
[PER Musharraf  ] recognizes that if/when [PER Bhutto  ] takes power , he will be out , and he may not be ready yet to take that step . 
Possible [PER Gates Visit  ] -------------------- [LOC KABUL  ] 00003800 004 OF 004 <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Edelman  ] conveyed the warm regards of [ORG SecDef  ] Gates and said the [ORG SecDef  ] hopes to visit [LOC Afghanistan  ] before the end of the year . 
[PER Karzai  ] welcomed the prospect of his visit .
