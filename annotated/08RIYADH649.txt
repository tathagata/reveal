( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: US Ambassador to [LOC Iraq  ] [PER Ryan Crocker  ] and General [PER David Petraeus  ] met with [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] bin [PER Abd al-Aziz  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Prince Saud  ] al-Faisal , General Presidency of Intelligence Chief [PER Prince Muqrin  ] bin [PER Abd al-Aziz  ] , and Interior Minister [PER Nayif  ] bin [PER Abd al-Aziz  ] during their April 14-15 visit to [LOC Riyadh  ] . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] King and senior Princes reviewed [MISC Saudi  ] policy toward [LOC Iraq  ] in detail , all making essentially the same points . 
They said that the Kingdom will not send an ambassador to [LOC Baghdad  ] or open an embassy until the King and senior [MISC Saudi  ] officials are satisfied that the security situation has improved and the [MISC Iraqi  ] government has implemented policies that benefit all [MISC Iraqis  ] , reinforce [LOC Iraq  ] 's [MISC Arab  ] identity , and resist [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] evinced somewhat greater flexibility regarding the issues of economic and humanitarian assistance for [LOC Iraq  ] and debt forgiveness . 
In a conversation with the [LOC Charge'  ] on April 17 , [MISC Saudi  ] Ambassador to the US [PER Adel al-Jubeir  ] indicated that the King had been very impressed by the visit of Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] , and al-Jubeir hinted that the [MISC Saudi  ] government might announce changes to its [LOC Iraq  ] policy before the President 's visit to [LOC Riyadh  ] in mid-May . 
End Summary . 
Positive Signs in [LOC Iraq  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In all their meetings with the [MISC Saudi  ] royals , both Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] conveyed the progress in [LOC Iraq  ] and confirmed the negative role [LOC Iran  ] is playing in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
They characterized the recent [MISC ISF-led  ] operations in [LOC Basra  ] and [LOC Baghdad  ] as having a striking effect against the [ORG Shia  ] militias , most importantly turning [MISC Iraqi  ] public opinion away from the militias . 
While Prime Minister [PER Nuri al-Maliki  ] 's decision to take action against the militias was described as hasty and not well-planned , Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] emphasized that any tactical shortfalls were overshadowed by the greater positive effect of unifying [LOC Iraq  ] and demonstrating the [ORG GOI  ] 's , and most specifically al-Maliki 's , determined resolve to take on the [ORG Shia  ] militias , especially [MISC Jaysh  ] al-Madhi . 
Concurrently , these operations unequivocally demonstrated [LOC Iran  ] 's subversive activities in [LOC Iraq  ] and its broader regional ambitions . 
Throughout all their discussions , Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] stressed the importance and urgent need for the [MISC Saudis  ] to join us in supporting [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] Embassy Issue <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) King [PER Abdullah  ] , the Foreign Minister , and [PER Prince Muqrin  ] all stated that the [MISC Saudi  ] government would not send an ambassador to [LOC Baghdad  ] or open an embassy there in the near future , citing both security and political grounds in support of this position . 
The Foreign Minister stated that he had considered dispatching an ambassador and had sent [MISC Saudi  ] diplomats to [LOC Baghdad  ] to identify a site for the [MISC Saudi  ] embassy . 
However , he said . 
" the King simply forbade us to go any farther . 
" King [PER Abdullah  ] confirmed this account in a separate meeting with Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] . 
The King asserted that the security situation in [LOC Baghdad  ] was too dangerous for him to risk sending a [MISC Saudi  ] ambassador there . 
" He would immediately become a target for the terrorists and the militias , " he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG King  ] also rejected the suggestion that by sending a [MISC Saudi  ] ambassador to [LOC Baghdad  ] he could give essential political support to the [MISC Iraqi  ] government as it struggles to resist [MISC Iranian  ] influence and subversion . 
He expressed lingering doubt on the [MISC Iraqi  ] government 's willingness to resist [LOC Iran  ] . 
He also repeated his frequently voiced doubts about [MISC Iraqi  ] Prime Minister al-Maliki himself by alluding to his " [MISC Iranian  ] connections . 
" The [MISC Saudi  ] monarch stated that he does not trust al-Maliki because the [MISC Iraqi  ] Prime Minister had " lied " to him in the past by promising to take certain actions and then failing to do so . 
The King did not say precisely what these allegedly broken promises might have been . 
He repeated his oft heard view that al-Maliki rules [LOC Iraq  ] on behalf of his Shiite sect instead of all [MISC Iraqis.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) However , in a potentially significant move , the King did not reject the idea of dispatching a [MISC Saudi  ] ambassador to [LOC Baghdad  ] completely . 
Instead , he said that he would consider [LOC RIYADH  ] 00000649 002 OF 003 doing so after the [MISC Iraqi  ] provincial elections are held in the autumn . 
The conduct of these elections would indicate whether or not the [MISC Iraqi  ] government is truly interested in ruling on behalf of all [MISC Iraqis  ] or merely in support of the [ORG Shia  ] , King [PER Abdullah  ] asserted . 
Grudging Acknowledgment of Change in [LOC Iraq  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Foreign Minister signaled another potential softening in [MISC Saudi  ] policy by saying that the Kingdom 's problem was not with al-Maliki as a person but rather with the conduct of the [MISC Iraqi  ] government . 
The King himself admitted that the [MISC Iraqi  ] government 's performance has improved in recent months and grudgingly accepted the point that al-Maliki and his security forces have indeed been fighting extremists , specifically [ORG Shia  ] extremists in both [LOC Basra  ] and [LOC Baghdad  ] and [MISC Sunni  ] extremists and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] in [LOC Mosul  ] . 
However , the King and the senior Princes argued that more time would be required to judge whether the recent change in [MISC Iraqi  ] behavior was lasting and sincere . 
The King suggested that much of the [MISC Iraqi  ] government 's improved performance is attributable to [LOC US  ] prodding rather than change in [MISC Iraqi  ] attitudes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Foreign Minister also suggested that the USG should prod [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] to speak out in favor of a unified [LOC Iraq  ] and national reconciliation among different [MISC Iraqi  ] sects and groups . 
" You have paid a heavy price in blood and treasure , and [PER Sistani  ] and his people have benefited directly . 
You have every right to ask this of him , " [PER Prince Saud  ] al-Faisal said . 
Possible [ORG Saudi Economic Assistance  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG King  ] , [PER Prince Muqrin  ] , and the Foreign Minister all suggested that the [MISC Saudi  ] government might be willing to consider the provision of economic and humanitarian assistance to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Prince Muqrin  ] asked Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] to send him a list of the kinds of assistance that the [LOC US  ] government would like to see the Kingdom provide [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Al-Jubeir  ] later told the [LOC Charge'  ] that this assistance would be separate from the [ORG USD  ] 1 billion in aid that the [MISC Saudi  ] government had promised at the [LOC Madrid Conference  ] but still not delivered due to security worries . 
He said that the [LOC Madrid  ] commitment consisted of $500 million in trade credits and $500 million in project assistance with strict conditionally , along the lines of what the [ORG World Bank  ] would require . 
[PER Al-Jubeir  ] added that the assistance the [MISC Saudi  ] government might provide via [PER Prince Muqrin  ] would initially be in the range of $75-$300 million . 
Possible Debt Relief <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG King  ] noted that [MISC Saudi  ] debt relief for [LOC Iraq  ] " will come at some point , " although he did not say when . 
[PER Al-Jubeir  ] told the [LOC Charge'  ] that debt relief is a real possibility . 
He also noted that the [MISC Saudi  ] government might make changes to its [LOC Iraq  ] policy , perhaps including both assistance and debt relief , prior to the President 's visit to [ORG Riyadh  ] . 
The Need to Resist [LOC Iran  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG King  ] , Foreign Minister , [PER Prince Muqrin  ] , and [PER Prince Nayif  ] all agreed that the Kingdom needs to cooperate with the [LOC US  ] on resisting and rolling back [MISC Iranian  ] influence and subversion in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG King  ] was particularly adamant on this point , and it was echoed by the senior princes as well . 
[PER Al-Jubeir  ] recalled the [ORG King  ] 's frequent exhortations to the [LOC US  ] to attack [LOC Iran  ] and so put an end to its nuclear weapons program . 
" He told you to cut off the head of the snake , " he recalled to the [LOC Charge'  ] , adding that working with the [LOC US  ] to roll back [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] is a strategic priority for the [ORG King  ] and his government. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Foreign Minister , on the other hand , called instead for much more severe [LOC US  ] and international sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] , including a travel ban and further restrictions on bank lending . 
[PER Prince Muqrin  ] echoed these views , emphasizing that some sanctions could be implemented without [ORG UN  ] approval . 
The Foreign Minister also stated that the use of military pressure against [LOC Iran  ] should not be ruled out . 
[ORG RIYADH  ] 00000649 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [MISC Saudi  ] attitudes toward [LOC Iraq  ] , from the [ORG King  ] on down , remain marked by skepticism and suspicion . 
That said , the [MISC Saudis  ] have noticed recent events in [LOC Iraq  ] and are eager to work with the [LOC US  ] to resist and reverse [MISC Iranian  ] encroachment in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG King  ] was impressed by Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] 's and General [PER Petraeus'  ] visit , as were the Foreign Minister , GPI Chief , and Interior Minister . 
Cautious as ever , the [MISC Saudis  ] may nevertheless be willing to consider new measures in the areas of assistance and debt relief , although further discussions will be required to make these ideas a reality . 
End Comment. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) This cable was reviewed and cleared by Ambassador [PER Crocker  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] .
