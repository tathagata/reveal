( U ) [MISC Summary: The  ] traditionally agrarian [ORG Progressive Party  ] is looking to the 2009 elections as a chance to reclaim lost glory and its historical role as the deciding factor in governing coalitions on both ends of the political spectrum . 
The party -- [LOC Iceland  ] 's second-largest for most of the last century -- suffered mightily at the polls in 2006 and 2007 from perceptions of cronyism and corruption . 
Support has decreased still further since then despite attempts to modernize the party , which seem to have widened internal disputes rather than overcome them . 
Four chairmen in three years have not managed to bring the disagreements to a close , but many are hopeful that a new young chairman can finally unify the party . 
The party is pro-NATO and until recently was against , or at best ambivalent towards , the [ORG EU  ] , but has shifted more to a pro-EU platform in the last few months . 
The [ORG PP  ] is currently defending the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance/Left-Green Movement  ] minority coalition and claims to prefer a leftist government after the upcoming parliamentary elections . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) was established in 1916 . 
For most of the twentieth century it was the second largest party in [LOC Iceland  ] , but its poll numbers have slipped in recent years . 
The constituency is largely rural and agrarian , closely connected with the cooperative movement in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [ORG PP  ] has frequently played a kingmaker role , given the inability of any one party to win an outright majority on its own . 
Icelanders describe the party as " open at both ends " because of its ability to form coalitions on both the left and right of the political spectrum. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former party leader [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] ( 1994-2006 ) , who was Prime Minister in the [MISC IP-PP  ] coalition from 2004-2006 , attempted to modernize the party and increase its appeal to urban voters , but he proved mostly unsuccessful in this endeavor . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] stepped down as chairman of the party after the municipal elections in May 2006 when the [ORG PP  ] suffered its second-worst electoral outcome ever . 
The party was also embroiled in discord between the rural and agrarian component of the party -- led by Deputy Chair [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] -- and the urban faction associated with [PER Asgrimsson  ] . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] bypassed [PER Agustsson  ] when he handpicked technocrat [PER Jon Sigurdsson  ] for the chairman position . 
This only further complicated intra-party arbitration , and [PER Sigurdsson  ] did not succeed in settling the disagreements in the party . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] led the [ORG PP  ] through the 2007 parliamentary elections where it suffered its worst outcome in any parliamentary elections , receiving only 11.7 percent of the national vote. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the 2007 campaign , the [MISC Progressives  ] were hamstrung by the public 's perception that the party was rife with cronyism that was just shy of outright corruption . 
In what became an emblematic case , about a month before the election the [ORG Althingi  ] granted [MISC Icelandic  ] citizenship to the soon-to-be daughter-in-law of Minister of Health [PER Jonina Bjartmarz  ] under circumstances in which political connections seemed to many to be the deciding factor . 
Given its command of the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] and [ORG Commerce  ] , the party also took the brunt of controversy over expansion in the aluminum sector and resulting environmental concerns . 
Many [MISC Progressives  ] complained that somehow their coalition partner , the [ORG Independence Party  ] , reaped all the credit for [LOC Iceland  ] 's booming economy while the [ORG PP  ] was left to take the blame for unpopular side effects of the expansion . 
The party was hammered on Election Day , dropping from 12 [ORG Althingi  ] seats to seven and failing to win a single seat in the [LOC Reykjavik  ] district . 
Though the [MISC IP-PP  ] coalition still held a one-seat majority , IP Chair [PER Geir Haarde  ] chose instead to build a larger majority with the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] , leaving the [MISC Progressives  ] out in the cold. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Sigurdsson  ] resigned as chairman after the elections and was replaced by Deputy Chairman [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] . 
This opened a window of opportunity for [PER Agustsson  ] to guide the party back to its traditional roots to try to regain some of the recently lost support . 
[PER Agustsson  ] was ineffective at unifying the broken party and the [ORG PP  ] did not bounce back in opinion polls . 
In November 2008 , he resigned suddenly from the position of chairman after a bitter central committee meeting at which the party 's youth wing made clear its unhappiness with his leadership . 
Deputy Chairman [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] headed the party until the January 2009 party national congress where the party elected a new leadership . 
[PER Sverrisdottir  ] herself did not seek election as chairman and when early elections were called for April 2009 announced that she would be retiring from politics. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The national congress was historic for two reasons . 
First , an outsider was elected chairman of the party for the first time , namely 34-year-old [PER Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson  ] , who had joined the party only one month earlier . 
Though [PER Gunnlaugsson  ] 's father had represented the party in parliament in the 1990s , [PER Gunnlaugsson  ] had no prior political experience . 
Second , the [ORG PP  ] resolved at the congress to support starting accession negotiations with the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) given certain preconditions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the January public demonstrations in [LOC Iceland  ] when the majority coalition was teetering on the brink of collapse , the [ORG PP  ] , under the leadership of new chairman [PER Gunnlaugsson  ] , informed the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) and the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LGM  ] ) that if they were to form a minority coalition , then the [ORG PP  ] would defend it . 
On February 1 , the [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG LGM  ] did indeed form a minority coalition government and the [ORG PP  ] pledged to defend it against no-confidence motions in the [ORG Althingi  ] . 
For the first few weeks after the new chairman was elected , the party surged in the polls , at times measuring at over 20 percent . 
Support has started to dwindle since then as the party has struggled at finding the balance between defending the government -- and therefore bearing some of the cost of unpopular decisions -- and not having any direct influence over the [MISC SDA-LG  ] coalition 's policies. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gunnlaugsson  ] 's lack of experience in the political arena is also raising doubts . 
The new party chair has in recent statements all but excluded cooperation with the [ORG Independence Party  ] after the elections , but then in mid-March has also harshly criticized the [ORG SDA  ] for not being a " real " party and called the [ORG SDA  ] 's credibility into question . 
At the same time , [PER Gunnlaugsson  ] 's praise for the [ORG LGM  ] has bordered on the saccharine , something of a break from tradition for the centrist [MISC Progressives  ] . 
Some believe that although the party appears to be courting leftist elements , this could be a political ploy and the [ORG PP  ] could go back to its kingmaker role again , joining either the center-right or the center-left forces in parliament. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On foreign affairs the [ORG PP  ] is pro-NATO , and took on a more modern view on western defense cooperation under [PER Asgrimsson  ] , with [MISC Icelandic  ] participation in peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction efforts . 
The party had advocated [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal from [MISC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik in the ( unspecified ) long term , but [PER Asgrimsson  ] had personally favored a [LOC U.S.  ] presence and expressed his personal feelings of betrayal in the harshest terms . 
While the party had traditionally been anti-EU , [PER Asgrimsson  ] attempted to sway the party to a more [MISC EU-friendly  ] position and had scandalized many in 2006 with a prediction that [LOC Iceland  ] would become a member by 2015 . 
Subsequent chairmen have all been pro-EU with the exception of the traditionalist [PER Agustsson  ] . 
Their efforts to move the party in the direction of [LOC Europe  ] eventually came to a head at the national congress in January where the party decided to drastically modify its position and stated its preference for starting negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
That said , Chairman [PER Gunnlaugsson  ] 's position on the [ORG EU  ] can best be described as " open " to [ORG EU  ] membership rather than as advocacy . 
He is otherwise something of a tabula rasa on foreign policy issues .
