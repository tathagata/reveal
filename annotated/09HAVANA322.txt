07 [ORG HAVANA  ] 761 Classified By: COM [PER Jonathan Farrar  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The combination of new warnings of potential blackouts , serious liquidity issues , and potential ( if not already ) reduced financial support from [LOC Venezuela  ] has sparked rumors on the street and in the international media that [LOC Cuba  ] may be headed toward another " Special Period " . 
The reality is that [LOC Cuba  ] and [MISC Cubans  ] are not as vulnerable as they were in 1989 before the end of [MISC Soviet  ] subsidies . 
However , the [MISC Cuban  ] economy remains remarkably dependent on external markets and access to credit . 
While the level of foreign reserves is a well guarded secret , some analysts and USINT contacts believe the [ORG GOC  ] could run out of cash later this year without a significant change of course . 
Energy austerity measures officially began on June 1 , starting with state companies and then potentially moving to households . 
We expect a reduction in non-fuel imports as a next step . 
End Summary ----------------------------- Are We There Yet ? 
No , [PER But...  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The standard of living for [MISC Cubans  ] , while still not as high as twenty years ago before the end of [MISC Soviet  ] subsidies , remains much better than the darkest days of the 1990 to 1993 period when GDP fell more than 35 percent . 
While we expect zero to negative GDP growth in 2009 ( Ref A ) , [LOC Cuba  ] 's latest challenges have yet to seriously affect the average [MISC Cuban  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] blames its current macroeconomic woes on the world economic slowdown , the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo , a particularly destructive 2008 hurricane season , and general inefficiency and waste . 
The [ORG GOC  ] is quick to point out that no [MISC Cuban  ] will be evicted for failure to pay a mortgage and [MISC Cuban  ] jobs remain secure while rich countries are experiencing massive layoffs . 
Nevertheless , the [ORG GOC  ] has previewed other difficulties that could soon reach [MISC Cuban  ] households . 
Liquidity Crunch ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Cuba  ] has been in a perennial state of late-payment for decades ; sometimes due to legitimate cash shortages and at other times simply as a negotiation tactic . 
[LOC Cuba  ] has long pointed to the crisis of the day to renegotiate short term official debt , and we can not rule out that the [ORG GOC  ] is simply using the current world economic crisis to improve its cash position . 
However , diplomatic contacts agree that [LOC Cuba  ] 's current liquidity crunch is much deeper than in recent years . 
Foreign companies are waiting three to six months to receive payment , and some have already agreed to sell their assets back to the [ORG GOC  ] ( Pebercan ) or restructure their accounts receivables ( [MISC Sherritt  ] ) into medium to long term government debt. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The latest holdup appears to be at the banking level , as [MISC Cuban  ] state companies are reportedly making payments on time but the payment transfers are delayed by the bank for months before being released to the foreign enterprise . 
Alternatively , the funds are deposited in the foreign company 's account for use within [LOC Cuba  ] but they are not permitted to transfer the funds abroad or into a foreign currency . 
Initially , [MISC Cuban  ] officials blamed the need to divert resources to assist in the recovery from last year 's hurricanes , but now the main culprit appears to be the world economic crisis . 
A reported collapse in all of [LOC Cuba  ] 's main sources of foreign currency ( nickel exports , tourism , remittances ) and an increase in the quantity and price of [MISC Cuban  ] imports have magnified an already increasing debt burden . 
It is clear that the [ORG GOC  ] is hemorrhaging cash . 
Whether it has reached the crisis point or not is less clear . 
Either way , the [MISC Cuban  ] banking sector has lost much of the credibility it had built in recent years , which has led some [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000322 002 OF 005 to speculate that long time [ORG Central Bank President  ] [PER Francisco Soberon  ] may finally be on his way out. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG CIMEX  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] 's largest and most diversified holding company , reported on May 20 that payments for some imports have suffered delays , but the " will of the country " was to meet its financial obligations . 
[ORG CIMEX  ] also reported that remittances were down so far in 2009 . 
[ORG CIMEX  ] controls [ORG Banco Financiero International  ] , the most important [MISC Cuban  ] bank for foreign trade related transactions , and the relationship with remittance providers including [ORG Western Union and Canada  ] 's [ORG Transcard  ] through [ORG Financiera CIMEX  ] . 
According to [ORG Reuters  ] , the [ORG GOC  ] has called government ministries to cut spending by 6 percent and limit imports . 
[MISC European  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] diplomats report reduced exports to [LOC Cuba  ] so far this year , especially for machinery and other non-food items . 
Ironically , and to the visible dismay of our diplomatic colleagues , [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC Cuba  ] through the first quarter of 2009 were higher than even last year 's historic level . 
This dismay is heightened by the fact that [LOC U.S.  ] companies are paid on time while others must wait as reported above . 
[LOC U.S.  ] exports make up much of the food consumed by [MISC Cubans  ] and sold in the income generating tourist industry , and [LOC U.S.  ] law requires payment in cash in advance . 
However , there are recent reports that [MISC Cuban  ] purchases of [LOC U.S.  ] meat products have been cut through the rest of 2009 . 
Threatened Blackouts -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 2005 , [PER Fidel Castro  ] announced that his new Energy Revolution would put a stop to blackouts in [LOC Cuba  ] by the end of 2006 . 
The [ORG GOC  ] took several measures over the next few years to limit future blackouts ( Ref B ) , including increasing household electricity bills , swapping out refrigerators and light bulbs , and importing hundreds of small generators . 
Despite these steps , the official press announced on May 22 that " exceptional measures to save electricity shall be applied throughout the country starting 1 June in an effort to curb overconsumption , bring every center , municipality , and province in line with their plan , and prevent power cuts . 
" The [ORG GOC  ] identified 1,700 state enterprises as high electricity users , 3,000 examples of waste in the public sector , and four provinces with increasing home consumption . 
The [ORG GOC  ] is taking extreme measures to prevent countrywide blackouts . 
A new austerity plan is being implemented by each municipality and state enterprise to conserve energy . 
Local energy councils are monitoring the daily use of electricity and local authorities are conducting surprise inspections . 
In the first few days of the new plan , provinces have been strict in their stated intention to shut off a company 's electricity if it exceeds its budgeted allowance . 
There are reports that the [LOC Holguin  ] province shut off the electricity for the offices and warehouses of the three nickel plants due to overconsumption , although the plants themselves continue to operate. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although households are not included in the formal austerity program , the official press has highlighted fines levied on residents caught rigging electricity meters , urged personal energy savings , and threatened countrywide blackouts if the situation doesn't improve . 
The summer 2005 blackouts were a serious strain on [MISC Cuban  ] households and the possibility of a return to those days despite years of supposed reform in the sector has clearly disappointed our [MISC Cuban  ] contacts . 
Frequent but short-lived power outages already take place on a daily basis , but many [MISC Cubans  ] refuse even to speculate on a return to scheduled blackouts . 
Blackouts mean spoiled food , no air conditioning during the brutal summer months , and no cooking since the [ORG GOC  ] recently swapped most gas stoves with an electric version from [LOC China  ] . 
According to [ORG GOC  ] officials , the root of this summer 's energy crisis is not a lack of generation capacity ( as in 2005 ) but a shortage of fuel . 
[LOC Cuba  ] uses much of its own heavy crude oil for domestic electricity production , but also relies on imports , in particular [MISC Venezuelan  ] deliveries of refined products to power the ( diesel ) gas guzzling generators. --------------------------------------------- ------------ Potential Triggers: [LOC Venezuela  ] , Hurricanes , or Insolvency --------------------------------------------- ------------ [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000322 003 OF 005 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Venezuela: In addition to oil deliveries , [LOC Cuba  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] oil conglomerate [ORG PDVSA  ] have significant joint ventures in [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and other [ORG Petrocaribe  ] countries . 
Within [LOC Cuba  ] , these ventures are focused on building and expanding oil refining capacity , oil prospecting , gas production , maritime transportation ( crude oil and byproducts ) , housing construction , agricultural production , access to potable water , fishing , and transportation services . 
Potential future operations include increasing storage capabilities , enlarging cargo docks and navigation channels , and constructing a network of pipelines , roads , and services infrastructure . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] has taken over from [LOC China  ] a joint venture to build a new nickel plant within three years . 
In addition , [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] are working on a fiber optic cable with an ever changing completion date , currently some time in 2010. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOC  ] started hinting that all was not rosy with its economic relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] when , in an unusually public display , the front page of the [ORG Communist Party  ] newspaper [ORG Granma  ] reported on May 21 that [LOC Venezuela  ] would experience a 50 percent drop in petroleum revenue in <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
The [ORG GOC  ] reference to a lack of fuel rather than generation capacity to explain energy shortages could indicate either a reduction ( or delay ) in fuel supplies from [LOC Venezuela  ] or disappointing refining results through the [ORG Cuba/PDVSA  ] joint venture projects . 
A [MISC French  ] diplomat told us that a [MISC French  ] company inquiring about its overdue accounts receivable from a [MISC Cuban  ] bank was told that the bank had to wait until funds arrived from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] is not yet as dependent on [LOC Venezuela  ] as it was on the [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
However , a potential loss of even partial support for the many activities [MISC Venezuelan  ] enterprises are now involved in would severely impact several facets of the [MISC Cuban  ] economy . 
A reduction of oil shipments in 2010 ( Ref C ) could bring the economy to a halt. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Hurricanes:  ] The 2008 hurricane season devastated many parts of the island ( Ref D ) , but it mostly missed the foreign income generating regions of [LOC Havana  ] ( tourism and most industry ) , [LOC Matanzas  ] ( tourism ) , and Moa ( nickel ) . 
It also had only a modest effect on the sugar and tobacco industries . 
The 2009 hurricane season , which began on June 1 , is expected to be less severe than 2008 . 
However , one or two hurricanes that target these regions would cut [LOC Cuba  ] 's foreign earnings even further and raise serious questions around [LOC Cuba  ] 's solvency. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Insolvency: [LOC Cuba  ] effectively ran out of reserves in 1992 at the height of the [LOC Special Period  ] . 
At that time , [MISC Cubans  ] experienced extensive cuts in their rations ( food , clothing , electricity , and fuel ) , a near end to public transportation , and strict black market crackdowns . 
Since the end of the [LOC Special Period  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] has built up some foreign reserves , but , as one [MISC European  ] diplomat with good ties in the [MISC Cuban  ] banking sector told us , the exact number remains one of two key national secrets ( along with the details of [LOC Cuba  ] 's financial arrangement with [LOC Venezuela  ] ) . 
The [ORG Central Bank of Cuba  ] has implemented strict new measures limiting foreign currency transactions by foreign companies and further controlling transactions by state companies . 
The [MISC French Commercial  ] Counselor expects [LOC Cuba  ] to reach bankruptcy or near bankruptcy by the end of the year. ---------------------------------- Is [ORG Cuba Better Prepared This Time  ] ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC Cuba  ] 's over-reliance on credit to pay for critical imports and dependence on [LOC Venezuela  ] for more than just oil remain [LOC Cuba  ] 's primary vulnerabilities . 
In contrast to 1989 , however , [LOC Cuba  ] has diversified both its trading partners and sources of foreign currency . 
Whereas the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] represented 80 percent of [LOC Cuba  ] 's total trade in 1989 , [LOC Cuba  ] 's top five trade partners in 2007 represented only 60 percent of total trade ( in goods ) with [LOC Venezuela  ] on top at 20 percent ( followed by [LOC China  ] with 18 percent , [LOC Canada  ] with 10 percent , [LOC Spain  ] with 8 percent , and the [LOC United States  ] with 4 percent ) . 
Detailed 2008 numbers have not been released yet . 
All of these partners , with the exception of the [LOC United States  ] , [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000322 004 OF 005 offer [LOC Cuba  ] extensive credit . 
The [MISC Spanish Commercial  ] Counselor told us that [LOC Spain  ] is close to concluding a renegotiation of its short term debt with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] have already agreed on the new structure of the debt ( some cancelled , the rest longer term ) and the applicable interest rate . 
The only remaining obstacle is how much new credit [LOC Spain  ] will offer [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Some of the reforms that helped bring [LOC Cuba  ] out of the [LOC Special Period  ] will also provide a cushion for the [MISC Cuban  ] economy today . 
Even with an expected fall in tourism this year , [LOC Cuba  ] may receive close to 2 million more tourists than the 340,000 that arrived in 1990 . 
Earlier this year , [LOC Cuba  ] re-started licensing private taxi cabs . 
Local paladars ( small , private restaurants ) frequented by USINT staff remain profitable self-employment ventures . 
Although remittances are reportedly down so far this year , presumably due to the world economic crisis , money and visits from family members living abroad remain an important source of income for many [MISC Cuban  ] families . 
In addition , foreign investors remain interested in key sectors like hydrocarbons and tourism in spite of [LOC Cuba  ] 's liquidity problems , possibly in order to keep a foot in the door before a hypothetical opening to [LOC U.S.  ] business . 
Furthermore , the [MISC Cuban  ] government is much better at capturing foreign currency than before 1990 through customs , fees , taxes , and hard currency stores. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Special Period  ] is still fresh in the minds of all [MISC Cubans  ] . 
For most , the problem was not one of income but rather of a lack of supply . 
There was simply nothing to buy and very little provided by the state . 
As a result , [MISC Cubans  ] have spent the past twenty years learning how to " escapar " ( literally to escape but usually meant to survive ) without relying on [ORG GOC  ] assistance . 
The 2008 hurricanes returned many families in eastern [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Pinar  ] del [LOC Rio  ] , and the [ORG Isle of Youth  ] to desperate conditions with insufficient government assistance . 
According to the [ORG World Food Program  ] , most hurricane assistance has now been delivered , so victims will have to rely on their own efforts for sustenance ( see septel for information on the pending [MISC European  ] Community aid package which includes some humanitarian assistance ) . 
The destruction caused by last year 's hurricanes means that some [MISC Cubans  ] don't have as far to fall to reach standards of living similar to the Special Period. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On May 24 , state newspaper [ORG Juventude Rebelde  ] reported on interviews conducted to determine how [MISC Cubans  ] see the effects of the global economic crisis on the country . 
Most of the interviewees urged readers to " work harder " and " soldier on " to help the country through this difficult time . 
One retiree said he didn't think this is going to get as bad as in the worst of the days of the 1990s . 
Several respondents said [MISC Cubans  ] were better prepared since they have been trained to live through similar crises . 
The article sought to dampen rumors of " catastrophic overtones " including " no oil , soap , and other staples , ( and ) that the blackouts will come back and that they will be long . 
" The [ORG GOC  ] and official press have yet to offer any solutions other than a call on the patriotic duty of all [MISC Cubans  ] to save more and spend less . 
Several [ORG GOC  ] officials have echoed a 2005 quote by [ORG Central Bank President  ] [PER Francisco Soberon  ] turning the political motto " Fatherland or Death " into its economic equivalent of " Savings or Death " . -------- COMMENTS -------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Daily life for most [MISC Cubans  ] remains extremely difficult primarily due to a backward and mismanaged economy and the lingering effects of last year 's hurricanes . 
The summer months promise even more hardship as the world economic crisis finally makes its way to [MISC Cuban  ] households . 
Nevertheless , today 's [MISC Cuban  ] economy is less vulnerable to a return to the lows of the Special Period thanks to more diversified sources of income and credits , a more resourceful [MISC Cuban  ] population , and an actual ( remittances and travel ) and theoretical ( end of the embargo ) opening of [MISC U.S.-Cuban  ] relations . 
By even mentioning the possibility of blackouts , the [ORG GOC  ] is trying to set the expectations of [MISC Cubans  ] as low as they can possibly go without triggering public unrest . 
If [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000322 005 OF 005 the [ORG GOC  ] can show that [MISC Cubans  ] working together can successfully prevent massive blackouts , then it can at least show level of competence and socialist pride . 
Further risks remain , however , as hurricane season approaches and both [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] face their own financial crises .
