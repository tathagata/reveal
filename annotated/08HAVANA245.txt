( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The visit to [LOC Cuba  ] of [LOC Vatican  ] Secretary of State Cardinal [PER Tarcisio Bertone  ] was considered a disappointment by everyone USINT has spoken with , though presumably not by the [ORG GOC  ] itself . 
In a subsequent meeting with the [ORG COM  ] , the [ORG Nuncio  ] seemed especially disappointed . 
But even normally cautious Cardinal [PER Jaime Ortega  ] cited several serious problems with the visit . 
Nevertheless , the visit probably achieved the Church 's principal objective of preserving , and even expanding slightly , its space on the island . 
Cardinal [PER Ortega  ] is now focusing his attention on convincing the [LOC Vatican  ] that a papal visit in January 2009 would be a good idea . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The February 20-26 visit to [LOC Cuba  ] of [LOC Vatican  ] Secretary of State Cardinal [PER Tarcisio Bertone  ] had been planned for months to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the visit to [LOC Cuba  ] of [PER Pope John Paul  ] II . 
The visit included the dedication of a monument to the papal visit that was erected on the site of the papal mass celebrated during the 1998 visit in the central [MISC Cuban  ] city of [ORG Villa Clara  ] . 
By coincidence , [PER Bertone  ] 's visit began just as the [ORG Cuban National Assembly  ] was electing [PER Raul Castro  ] president of the [ORG Council of State  ] in place of his brother [PER Fidel  ] , who had withdrawn from consideration for the post the week before for health reasons . 
Thus , Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] became the first official outside visitor to the new [PER Raul Castro-led  ] [LOC Cuba  ] . 
With that role in mind , the [PER Bertone  ] visit was an especially inauspicious event. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Given the care with which the Church in [LOC Cuba  ] approaches its relations with the regime , we did not expect [PER Bertone  ] to go beyond very circumspect diplomatic language . 
Instead , at a [MISC MINREX-sponsored  ] press event he attacked [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] , calling the embargo " ethically unacceptable and an oppression of the [MISC Cuban  ] people . 
" He also lent his support to the [ORG GOC  ] proposal to swap political prisoners for five [MISC Cuban  ] spies held in the [LOC U.S.  ] , implicitly equating the convicted spies with prisoners of conscience . 
He further criticized the [LOC U.S.  ] for the way its policies affected family reunification , but made no mention of restrictions placed on family reunification of its own citizens by the Government of [LOC Cuba  ] itself. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bertone  ] 's willingness to join with the [ORG GOC  ] in bashing [LOC U.S.  ] policy prompted one [MISC Cuban  ] to comment to his parish priest that the [ORG Cuban Communist Party  ] ( [ORG PCC  ] ) would soon be issuing him a membership card . 
Many [MISC Cubans  ] with whom we have spoken expressed similar or stronger levels of disappointment with the visit . 
Especially among practicing [MISC Catholic  ] faithful , [PER Bertone  ] 's visit had been anticipated as an opportunity to renew the spirit of hope that had come from [PER Pope John Paul  ] II 's 1998 visit , and give a voice to the rising and unfulfilled expectations of the [MISC Cuban  ] people to which the [MISC Cuban  ] bishops had referred clearly in their [MISC Christmas  ] message . 
Those in and around [LOC Havana  ] complained specifically about the heavy police presence at Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] 's mass at the [LOC Havana  ] cathedral that seemed designed to exclude the rank and file faithful . 
Those excluded were relegated to viewing the mass on television ( the broadcast of which was considered a success of the visit by the local church ) where they could see the pews filled with foreign diplomats ( though not from USINT , we were not invited ) , government officials , and members of the nomenklatura who normally take no part in church activities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG COM  ] called on the Papal [ORG Nuncio  ] the week after the visit to raise the statements made by Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] . 
The [ORG Nuncio  ] defended [PER Bertone  ] 's statement on the embargo strongly as consistent with the [LOC Vatican  ] 's position , and refused to be swayed on the question of swapping [MISC Cuban  ] political prisoners for five [MISC Cuban  ] spies held in the [LOC U.S.  ] , saying all are prisoners who suffer and the Church must defend the rights of all . 
The [ORG Nuncio  ] seemed literally to be stricken that the [ORG USG  ] would be offended by [PER Bertone  ] 's comments . 
He did allow that he thought it was unfortunate that the Cardinal had decided to speak in [MISC Spanish  ] , a language in which he is not comfortable , at the news conference . 
That decision may have induced [PER Bertone  ] to use the [MISC Spanish  ] phrasing he had heard most recently , that of the senior officials of the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] who used their customary loaded language to describe relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG Nuncio  ] cited some things he saw as successes coming from the visit , including progress on [LOC HAVANA  ] 00000245 002.2 OF 002 allowing the Church to have regular radio broadcasts and permission for construction on churches ( though not to build entirely new churches ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a subsequent meeting , the usually cautious and circumspect Cardinal [PER Jaime Ortega  ] , the archbishop of [LOC Havana  ] , told [ORG COM  ] and [PER PolEcon Counselor  ] that he was disappointed with the visit as a whole . 
[PER Ortega  ] complained about the level of Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] 's homilies , which he described as doctoral-level essays on the theology of relativism--a worthy subject , but not what the [MISC Cuban  ] people needed or wanted to hear about at this time . 
[PER Ortega  ] also was very unhappy about the decision to have the Cardinal visit the [ORG ELAM  ] ( [PER Escuela Latino-American  ] de [LOC Medicina  ] or [MISC Latin American School  ] of [MISC Medicine  ] ) . 
There he met with foreign students dressed in native dress who extolled the benefits of being brought to [LOC Cuba  ] to study medicine . 
The event was a blatant propaganda exercise directed at individuals who are not in any way related to the [MISC Cuban  ] Catholic Church . 
Presumably , it was the price that had to be paid to allow the construction and dedication of the papal monument in [ORG Villa Clara  ] to go forward. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While disappointed in the visit of Cardinal [PER Bertone  ] , [PER Ortega  ] is already focused on a larger goal--another papal visit . 
He said that he hoped to convince the [LOC Vatican  ] that it will be possible for the [PER Pope  ] to stop in [LOC Cuba  ] upon his return from an already scheduled visit to [LOC Mexico  ] in January 2009 . 
[PER Ortega  ] expects that the [LOC Vatican  ] will argue that the [PER Pope  ] will be too exhausted to do another visit , but he plans to argue that the flight to [LOC Cuba  ] from [LOC Mexico  ] is short ; the visit would consist only of the dedication of the new seminary now under construction near [LOC Havana  ] and a large , open-air mass ; and that the [PER Pope  ] can then fly directly to [LOC Rome  ] . 
As [PER Ortega  ] faces mandatory retirement for age at the end of 2009 , this will be his last chance to get the [PER Pope  ] to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He hopes that a papal visit will help to fill the newly-opened seminary with [MISC Cuban  ] candidates for the priesthood. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The most positive reports regarding the [PER Bertone  ] visit came from outside of [LOC Havana  ] . 
[MISC Santiago-based  ] priest , Fr . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , described the [MISC Catholic  ] faithful in eastern [LOC Cuba  ] as excited by the visit , and enthusiastic participants in the mass [ORG Bertone  ] celebrated in the city of [LOC Guantanamo  ] and his visit to the [LOC Basilica  ] of the [ORG Copper Madonna  ] near [LOC Santiago  ] . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought the Cardinal 's homilies on those occasions were appropriately directed to the interests of the local people and well-received . 
He agreed , however , with the overall assessment that the visit had not addressed the broader expectations of the [MISC Cuban  ] people. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The [MISC Cuban  ] church hierarchy has been famous ( or infamous ) for taking a very mild stance relative to the [PER Castro  ] regime . 
Their goal , and that of the [LOC Vatican  ] as well , has been to preserve and nurture back to health an institution that had been battered by the revolution . 
To achieve that goal , their center of gravity has been the regime , since it has always represented the biggest threat to the existence of the church as an institution . 
Through keeping the regime friendly , the Church hopes to build on small successes , like access to the airwaves and permission to construct [MISC Church-related  ] buildings like the seminary . 
In the sense of achieving the goal of keeping the regime friendly , the [ORG Bertone  ] visit could be considered a great success , therefore . 
However , it is a success that could come at the cost of a loss of confidence in the Church among the [MISC Cuban  ] faithful . 
If those faithful feel the [MISC Catholic  ] Church is not sensitive enough to their expectations , they may begin to drift away , perhaps to be picked up by the burgeoning evangelical and pentecostal movements on the island . 
Parish-level priests we spoke with in [LOC Havana  ] are aware of this threat and were even more vocal in their disapproval of the [ORG Bertone  ] visit . 
It goes without saying that we too are extremely disappointed by the fact that the Cardinal allowed himself to be used by the regime as a propaganda tool to bash [LOC U.S.  ] policy . 
If an early-2009 papal visit is a viable option , the way might still be clear to recuperate some of the ground lost through [ORG Bertone  ] 's visit . 
But that will only happen if the [LOC Vatican  ] has a change of heart about how it deals with this regime .
