( C ) [ORG SUMMARY: Institutional Security Office  ] ( GSI ) Minister General [PER Jorge Felix  ] shared with Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] on February 9 [LOC Brazil  ] 's top security concerns , which include: assistance and cooperation in [LOC Haiti  ] ; increased drug trafficking in the region and consumption in [LOC Brazil  ] ; and security for the four upcoming sporting events to be hosted by [LOC Brazil  ] , to include the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] .

END SUMMARY. -------------------------------- LOOKING TO ENHANCE POSITIVE PARTNERSHIP ON [LOC HAITI  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] on February 9 met with the [ORG Institutional Security Office  ] Chief , General [PER Jorge Felix  ] , Deputy General [PER Geromel  ] , and Secretary General [PER Fernando de Lima Santos  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] thanked [PER Felix  ] for [LOC Brazil  ] 's long-term work in [LOC Haiti  ] and [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and for its post-earthquake assistance and partnership with [LOC U.S.  ] forces on the ground . 
Ambassador [PER Shannon  ] also highlighted the new opportunity presented in [LOC Haiti  ] for [LOC Brazil  ] , the [LOC United States  ] , and the [ORG UN  ] to work together . 
[PER Felix  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] 's history and experience with [LOC Haiti  ] has helped in providing emergency assistance . 
However , assisting [LOC Haiti  ] is a challenge too great for just a few countries to handle . 
[PER Felix  ] explained that [LOC Brazil  ] 's permanent assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] over the years has not improved the situation on the ground . 
While security has improved in [LOC Haiti  ] , assistance has not taken [MISC Haitians  ] out of the misery they live in . 
The next phase of assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] needs to focus on helping [MISC Haitians  ] provide for themselves , said [PER Felix  ] ; we need to " teach them to fish instead of giving them the fish . 
" [PER Felix  ] explained that what has been coined in the media as President [PER Lula  ] 's " [ORG Bolsa Haiti  ] " is actually a series of projects that were implemented or planned by [LOC Brazil  ] to promote development in [LOC Haiti.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Felix  ] stated that [LOC Brazil  ] 's next steps on [LOC Haiti  ] include the [LOC Haiti  ] Donors meeting . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will bring its proposals to the meeting but [PER Felix  ] emphasized the need for partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] and active participation and commitment by the [MISC Haitian  ] government to successfully assist [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Felix  ] also confirmed that [PER Lula  ] will be traveling to [LOC Haiti  ] on February 25 to present [LOC Brazil  ] 's proposals to the [MISC Haitian  ] government . 
The Ambassador highlighted the importance of coordinating our actions and understandings in the run-up to the donors conference . 
[PER Felix  ] agreed and added that it would be very useful if [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] show up at the [LOC Haiti  ] Donors meeting with coordinated ideas . 
[PER Felix  ] closed his comments on [LOC Haiti  ] by recalling that he has been to [LOC Haiti  ] several times and at every departure he leaves his hope for [LOC Haiti  ] behind . 
The situation in [LOC Haiti  ] , he said , is too difficult to improve , " but we have to try . 
" -------------------------------- GSI LISTS ITS TOP SECURITY CONCERNS -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Felix  ] reciprocated the Ambassador 's willingness to cooperate , especially on security issues , adding that GSI " wants to be part of the solution , not the problem . 
" [PER Felix  ] explained that there are many areas of great interest to GSI that could be better addressed with a deeper partnership with the [LOC United States  ] , including critical infrastructure protection , information security , and the constant problems of terrorism and drugs . 
[PER Felix  ] noted that critical infrastructure protection is something they should likely discuss with the [ORG U.S. Department of Homeland Security  ] ( [ORG DHS  ] ) and information security , which is now a top concern for most countries , is an issue he would like to better address by getting [MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] technical folks together and by deepening relationships with private [LOC U.S.  ] firms that have successfully dealt with cyber threats. -------------------------------- [LOC BOLIVIA  ] AND COUNTERNARCOTICS -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that organized crime and drugs is also a great security concern for the [LOC United States  ] . 
Political changes in the region , however , had complicated traditional [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation programs . 
In this kind of environment , the Ambassador said , cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] was more important than ever . 
[PER Felix  ] described [LOC Brazil  ] 's difficult experiences with [LOC Bolivia  ] and emphasized the importance of addressing the issue of organized crime and the drug trade in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Felix  ] explained that [MISC Bolivian  ] cocaine , coca paste , and crack are low in quality and cheap-therefore unacceptable for sale in the [LOC United States  ] and [MISC Europe-and  ] have instead infiltrated [LOC Brazil  ] . 
This has led to an explosive increase in consumption among [MISC Brazilians  ] , which also coincided with the increase of coca cultivation in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] shares a 3,400 km border with [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Felix  ] said , which makes monitoring almost impossible , especially because traffickers frequently change their drug routes . 
Now that the [MISC Brazilian  ] government has been able to decrease the number of drug flights from [LOC Bolivia  ] , by increased monitoring , there has been a noticeable increase in trafficking via vehicles. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Felix  ] complained about how hard it is to work with other countries in the region on counternarcotics . 
He told the Ambassador , " You saw how difficult it is to work with [LOC Bolivia  ] , " and explained that [LOC Bolivia  ] 's complex and unique history has led it to the transition it is still experiencing today , and " no one knows where the transition will take them . 
" [PER Felix  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] has tried to work with [LOC Bolivia  ] on several issues . 
According to [PER Felix  ] , after [LOC Bolivia  ] expelled [ORG DEA  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] wanted [LOC Brazil  ] to step in , even substitute , the role the [LOC United States  ] had played in counternarcotics efforts . 
But in practice cooperation did not work . 
[PER Felix  ] explained that , although [LOC Brazil  ] had had greater influence in [LOC Bolivia  ] in the past , the relationship had matured and [LOC Brazil  ] now has to negotiate more with [LOC Bolivia.  ] -------------------------------- UPCOMING EVENTS AND [MISC GAMES  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Felix  ] also listed the four upcoming sporting events [LOC Brazil  ] will host as top security challenges to tackle . 
[PER Felix  ] noted that while most attention is being paid to the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] will also first host the [MISC Military World Games  ] in 2011 and the [MISC Confederations Cup  ] ( a soccer tournament organized by [ORG FIFA  ] ) in 2013 ; these smaller events , [PER Felix  ] remarked , will help prepare [LOC Brazil  ] for the larger 2014 and 2016 competitions . 
[PER Felix  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] will make intelligence-sharing among the countries participating in the events a priority . 
He noted that [LOC Brazil  ] had already experienced successful intelligence sharing during the 2007 [MISC Pan American  ] Games-hosted by [ORG Rio de Janeiro-and  ] that they plan on doing the same for the upcoming events but on a larger scale . 
[PER Felix  ] concluded that " we very much need cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and other games participants " to ensure successful and safe celebrations . 
( Comment: The intelligence sharing during the 2007 [MISC Pan American Games  ] was a lopsided arrangement . 
The [ORG USG  ] provided extensive resources and information to the [MISC Brazilian  ] hosts , yet received no information beyond what was shared with all other nations participating in the [MISC Games  ] .
