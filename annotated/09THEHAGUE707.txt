THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 615 Classified By: PolEcon Counselor [PER Andrew C. Mann  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Dutch  ] will support [ORG EU  ] consensus on the anti-Israel resolutions at [LOC UNGA  ] , having negotiated a strong Explanation of Vote ( [ORG EOV  ] ) by the [ORG EU  ] . 
FM [PER Verhagen  ] was dismayed by the latest [LOC Israel  ] decision on settlements in [LOC Gilo  ] , and angered by the surprise announcement of new settlements in [LOC Gilo  ] shortly after a visit and phone call with [MISC Israeli  ] FM [PER Lieberman  ] . 
FM [PER Lieberman  ] 's visit on November 11 was a demonstration of how to irritate people and lose friends . 
In contrast with an earlier meeting of the two ministers , however , [PER Lieberman  ] seemed fully in charge . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) ANTI-ISRAEL RESOLUTIONS AT [MISC UNGA: Post  ] delivered reftel A points to key MFA contacts on [ORG UN  ] , human rights and [LOC Middle East  ] affairs . 
In a November 19 discussion with [PER Dorine Wytema  ] and [PER David Zeverijn  ] , senior policy officers in the [LOC Middle East  ] department , [PER Zeverijn  ] indicated the [LOC Netherlands  ] would support the [ORG EU  ] consensus position on the anti-Israel resolutions . 
This year 's resolutions are significantly worse than last year 's . 
However , the [MISC Dutch  ] were satisfied that their firm position within the [ORG EU  ] yielded a strong [ORG EOV  ] with language addressing the [ORG Goldstone  ] report , the blockade language , the rocket attacks and [LOC Israel  ] 's right to self defense . 
Within the [ORG EU  ] , we found ourselves needing to pick our battles and therefore opted to support consensus , said [PER Zeverijn  ] . 
( COMMENT: The [MISC Dutch  ] have been criticized for their tough position on [MISC Serbian  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] , among other issues , and may be seeking to take a more conciliatory approach within the [ORG EU  ] . 
END COMMENT . 
) [PER Zeverijn  ] added that [MISC Dutch  ] domestic politics , with some parties highly critical of [LOC Israel  ] , also made it difficult for [PER Verhagen  ] to buck [ORG EU  ] consensus ( reftel C ) . 
Finally , [PER Zeverijn  ] suggested it was best to avoid a repeat of the [ORG EU  ] split that occurred during the [LOC Geneva  ] debate over the [ORG Goldstone  ] report. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) REACTION TO NEW SETTLEMENTS: [PER Wytema  ] advised confidentially that FM [PER Verhagen  ] was angry about the [MISC Israeli  ] decision to approve settlements in [LOC Gilo  ] . 
Some of his anger stemmed from the fact that FM [PER Lieberman  ] did not reveal the settlement plan during a December 11 visit to The [ORG Hague  ] or in a thank you call afterward . 
In public comments , [PER Verhagen  ] said he was dismayed by the new settlements . 
( NOTE: [PER Verhagen  ] used the [MISC Dutch  ] word onthutst , which one commentator translated as flabbergasted , and onthutst probably sounds slightly stronger than dismayed to [MISC Dutch  ] ears . 
However , [PER Zeverijn  ] indicated the FM 's remarks matched the [LOC U.S.  ] language indicating dismay . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) VISIT BY FM LIEBERMAN: [PER Zeverijn  ] described [PER Lieberman  ] 's visit as a demonstration of how to irritate people and lose friends . 
[PER Wytema  ] noted that [PER Lieberman  ] started first and spoke for 20 minutes without giving [PER Verhagen  ] the opportunity for a back-and-forth dialogue . 
[PER Lieberman  ] also had dinner with far-right [ORG Freedom Party  ] leader [PER Gert Wilders  ] during his visit . 
According to [PER Wytema  ] , [PER Lieberman  ] made no movement on peace settlement issues , was pessimistic and cynical about every [MISC Palestinian  ] , including [PER Abbas  ] , and asserted the ball was in [LOC Palestine  ] 's court because the problem was not with us . 
[PER Lieberman  ] also expressed distrust of [LOC Turkey  ] , suggesting the [ORG Turkey-Iran-Syria Qdistrust of Turkey  ] , suggesting the [ORG Turkey-Iran-Syria  ] rapprochement is part of a plan to divide [LOC Iraq  ] after the [MISC Americans  ] depart . 
[PER Verhagen  ] told [PER Lieberman  ] you need friends , and emphasized his friendship , but noted that the [LOC Netherlands  ] cannot go on defending [LOC Israel  ] without helpful actions by the [MISC Israelis  ] . 
[PER Verhagen  ] urged movement on the settlements issue , noting that the [LOC Netherlands  ] viewed them as illegal and a violation of obligations under the roadmap . 
A good gesture , even a temporary moratorium , would help . 
[PER Verhagen  ] also urged [PER Lieberman  ] to strengthen [PER Abbas  ] -- [LOC Israel  ] 's best partner . 
He asked [PER Lieberman  ] to lift border restrictions against the [MISC Palestinians  ] to better address humanitarian concerns , while reaffirming [MISC Dutch  ] support for anti-smuggling efforts . 
Finally , he urged further investigations of the [LOC Gaza  ] conflict , noting that he would try to keep international resolutions in [LOC New York  ] fair , but that [LOC Israel  ] could help with more transparent efforts and more publicity with its investigations . 
[PER Zeverijn  ] concluded that the visit had one benefit -- it deflected criticism from the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament away from [PER Verhagen  ] and toward [PER Lieberman.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER LIEBERMAN  ] IN CHARGE: [PER Wytema  ] noted that [MISC Leiberman  ] seemed fully in charge in the meeting , and that D/FM Ayalon THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00000707 002 OF 002 and other staff did not speak . 
( NOTE: This contrasts with a previous meeting in [LOC Jerusalem  ] , where [PER Lieberman  ] appeared frustrated and deferred to his staff .
