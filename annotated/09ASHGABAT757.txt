<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC ASHGABAT  ] 000757 SIPDIS STATE FOR NEA/IR AND SCA/CEN EO 12958 DECL: 06/15/2019 TAGS IR , [LOC TX  ] , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC PREL  ] , PHUM SUBJECT: [LOC IRAN  ] POST-ELECTION: [ Source removed ] CALLS RESULTS A “COUP D’ETAT ; ” SAYS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD DEMAND A RECOUNT [LOC ASHGABAT  ] 00000757 001.2 OF 002 Classfied By: Charge [PER Richard Miles  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) In a conversation today with [LOC Iran  ] Watcher , a [ Source removed ] in [LOC Ashgabat  ] labeled the announcement of [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s  ] victory in Friday’s presidential election a “coup d’etat , ” and called [MISC Iran’s  ] incumbent President “another [PER Pinochet.”  ] [ Name removed ] said that based on calculations from [LOC Mousavi’s  ] campaign observers who were present at polling stations around the country and who witnessed the vote counts , [ORG Mousavi  ] received approximately 26 million ( or 61% ) of the 42 million votes cast in Friday’s election , followed by [PER Mehdi Karroubi  ] ( 10-12 million ) . 
According to his sources , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] received “a maximum of 4-5 million votes , ” with the remainder going to [PER Mohsen Rezai  ] . 
He said that more than anything else , the huge turnout of voters on Friday was a reflection of the [MISC Iranian  ] electorate’s overwhelming “anti-Ahmadinejad” sentiments . 
PRECINCT RESULTS OBSCURED <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ Name removed ] said that in a clear departure from established electoral rules and practice in [LOC Iran  ] , including the procedures followed in the 2005 presidential election and last year’s legislative elections , the authorities embargoed the results from individual precincts and announced instead that they must be conveyed directly to the central election authorities , who would announce the overall results after all the votes were counted . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] authorities knew , he said , that attempts to falsify individual precinct counts could be countered by observers from the [ORG Mousavi  ] and the other campaigns , so in order to engineer a “lopsided” [PER Ahmadinejad  ] victory , they had no choice but to conceal the precinct results . 
In his words , “People know who they voted for and the observers know who won in each precinct.” [MISC ARAB REACTION:  ] A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ Name removed ] said that [MISC Iranians  ] are puzzled by the muted reaction thus far of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] governments , as well as “very disappointed” by the number of [MISC Arab  ] rulers who have sent messages to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] congratulating him on his “victory.” He said that the international community should acknowledge the illegitimacy of the election and demand that the [MISC Iranian  ] authorities release and account for the results from each precinct . 
He said the [ORG IRGC  ] ( [ORG Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] ) was behind the “coup.” Even Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] , he said , to whom the [ORG IRGC  ] owes allegiance , is “not totally in control” of the [ORG IRGC  ] . 
Citing the [MISC IRGC’s  ] warnings against a “velvet revolution” in the days leading up to the election , it would appear that the [ORG IRGC  ] has taken on “a life of its own.” [MISC IRANIAN  ] DIPLOMATS GET 4TH OF JULY INVITATION INSTRUCTIONS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During a visit to the [MISC Iranian  ] Embassy in [LOC Ashgabat  ] last Friday to vote , [ Name removed ] said that , without exception , “everyone he spoke to” who was there to cast their ballot said they were voting for [ORG Mousavi  ] . 
[ Detail removed ] CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE: “OUR ONLY OPTION” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ Name removed ] said that the [MISC Iranian  ] authorities , particularly the [ORG IRGC  ] , are “merciless” and , “unlike the government in 1979 , ” will use any level of force necessary to put down [MISC Iranians  ] who attempt [LOC ASHGABAT  ] 00000757 002.2 OF 002 to demonstrate or force an annulment of the election . 
Instead , he said , the most effective means to counter the results will be in the form of peaceful , civil disobedience. “The people need to act in concert and ‘shut down the country.’” “If no one goes to work and the government cannot function , ” he said , “this will cause them to think again.” 6 ( C ) COMMENT: During our conversation our interlocutor recalled the words of his father [ detail removed ] during the lead-up to the 1979 revolution . 
He said that his father warned him against joining the revolution and to “watch out for the [MISC Islamists.”  ] “Once they get power , ” he had said , “they’ll never relinquish it . 
People are going to be sorry.” END COMMENT .
