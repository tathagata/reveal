On March 19 , [ORG DG Yin  ] told us that Premier [PER Wen  ] and other senior leaders believe it is important to avoid actions that could be perceived as adversely impacting the claims of senior creditors to systemically large financial institutions and to avoid a repeat of " ( the ) [ORG Lehman  ] ( situation ) " in 2008 . 
[ORG MOF Assistant Minister Zhu Guangyao  ] said that enhancing confidence and trust should be an important theme of the next [ORG Economic Dialogue  ] . 
Other [MISC Chinese  ] contacts have offered similar versions of their Government 's concerns , with one noting that there has been a " huge debate " within the government about [LOC China  ] 's holdings of [LOC U.S.  ] Treasuries .

End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) At the March 13 closing press conference of the [ORG National People 's Congress  ] ( [ORG NPC  ] ) in [LOC Beijing  ] , Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] was asked about [LOC U.S.  ] measures to counteract the global financial crisis in light of [LOC China  ] 's large holdings of [LOC U.S.  ] debt , and also about [LOC China  ] 's strategy to spread investment risk if the USD depreciated . 
In response , [PER Wen  ] said [LOC China  ] was " paying close attention " to the [LOC U.S.  ] economic situation and the [ORG USG  ] 's measures to address the crisis . 
He then added that " we are certainly concerned about the security of our assets " and " I am a little concerned . 
" Following the press conference , coverage of [PER Wen  ] 's remarks by [LOC China  ] 's official [ORG Xinhua  ] news agency acknowledged the Premier 's " worries " while also reporting that [PER Wen  ] expected [LOC U.S.  ] measures would " counter " the crisis . 
[ORG Xinhua  ] also noted that [LOC China  ] 's reserves were " generally safe " ( ref ) . 
What Did [MISC Wen Mean  ] ? ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Wen  ] 's remarks immediately generated intense speculation that [LOC China  ] might be contemplating some adjustment in its foreign reserve management policy . 
Shortly after reports of the Premier 's remarks became public , [ORG U.S. Treasury Department Acting Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Sobel  ] raised the issue with [ORG State Administration of Foreign Exchange  ] ( SAFE ) Director ( and [ORG People 's Bank of China Deputy Governor  ] ) [PER Hu Xiaolian  ] . 
( Note: SAFE is the [MISC Chinese  ] government agency responsible for managing [LOC China  ] 's reserves . 
) In response , [PER Hu  ] noted [LOC China  ] 's continued concerns about the inflationary implications of the expansion of the [ORG Fed  ] 's balance sheet ; her comments closely paralleled those conveyed by SAFE Director General ( [ORG DG  ] ) for [ORG Reserve Management Yin Yong  ] during a February 26 meeting in [LOC Beijing  ] with visiting [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] [PER DAS Dohner  ] . 
On that occasion , [PER Yin  ] had observed that SAFE was concerned about the risks of [LOC U.S.  ] dollar depreciation and [LOC U.S.  ] inflation , as both would erode the [ORG RMB  ] value of their [LOC U.S.  ] dollar denominated assets . 
[PER Yin  ] called President [PER Obama  ] 's announced intention to cut the federal budget deficit by the end of his first term a wise step , and said he would like to see measures by the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] to unwind its injection of liquidity after the financial crisis ends . 
Stabilize the Economy , and Protect the Investors --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a March 19 follow-up conversation with Finatt , SAFE DG [PER Yin  ] , who clearly had deferred meeting with us until he received approval and guidance from his superiors , said the Premier had been " worrying " about all of [LOC China  ] 's investments in the [LOC U.S.  ] , including [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] securities . 
[PER Wen  ] also had " noticed " the policies promulgated by the administration of President [PER Obama  ] , and hoped that the measures taken to address the global economic crisis would help to stabilize the financial systems and promote economic recovery . 
[PER Yin  ] also said his " understanding " of Premier [PER Wen  ] 's message was , in addition to the above objectives , that [LOC U.S.  ] policy should [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000728 002 OF 003 focus on protecting the interests of investors , as both financial stability and protecting investor rights were important for strengthening the confidence of domestic and foreign investors. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Continuing , [PER DG Yin  ] said he believed the [ORG USG  ] measures taken thus far are " responsible " and he hoped any future interventions in systemically large financial institutions also would be responsible and consistent . 
Ensuring that would be vital for maintaining investor confidence , while anything harmful to confidence would also undermine financial stability . 
[PER Yin  ] noted concern about " voices " in the [LOC U.S.  ] -- but not in the [ORG Obama Administration  ] - that were recommending " sacrificing " the interests of some senior creditors' claims on systemically large financial institutions . 
( Comment: Some [LOC U.S.  ] commentators have suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] government require that senior creditors take " haircuts " as a condition for intervening in [LOC U.S.  ] financial institutions . 
In previous cases where the [ORG FDIC  ] took over insolvent banks , not all creditor claims were honored in full ) . 
After Finatt observed that [ORG USG  ] interventions taken to date in large financial institutions have for the most part been designed to maintain the confidence of holders of senior debt , [PER Yin  ] replied that [LOC U.S.  ] policies should be consistent , " not like [ORG Lehman  ] " in <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
( Comment: Several interlocutors have told us that [ORG Lehman  ] was a counterparty to SAFE in financial transactions and as a result SAFE suffered large losses when [ORG Lehman  ] collapsed . 
) Huge Internal Debate -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Other [MISC Chinese  ] contacts have offered us similar versions of their Government 's concerns about its [LOC U.S.  ] investments in recent weeks . 
In a February 27 meeting with visiting [ORG Treasury  ] [PER DAS Dohner  ] , senior economist [PER Shen Minggao  ] of the respected " Caijing " magazine said there has been a " huge debate " within the government about [LOC China  ] 's holdings of [LOC U.S.  ] Treasuries . 
Some officials are concerned about the risks of future [LOC U.S.  ] inflation due to excess liquidity creation and USD depreciation . 
Furthermore , if [LOC China  ] buys more , the risk grows . 
He understood that SAFE has been shifting its portfolio toward shorter-term assets to reduce the risk of capital losses from higher inflation . 
[PER Shen  ] also recommended the [ORG USG  ] consider entering a bilateral agreement with [LOC China  ] under which [LOC China  ] would continue providing funds to the [LOC U.S.  ] in exchange for some sort of hedging scheme. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On March 18 Director [PER Xiao Lian  ] of the [ORG Center for American Economic Studies  ] at the [ORG Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  ] ( [ORG CASS  ] ) , told us that Premier [PER Wen  ] and the senior leadership have been under " strong pressure " to address public criticism about recent high profile losses on [LOC China  ] 's overseas investments . 
[PER Xiao  ] also speculated that [PER Wen  ] may have wanted to reiterate [LOC China  ] 's concerns , perhaps more clearly understood by former Secretary [PER Paulson  ] and other now-departed [LOC U.S.  ] officials , to the new [PER Obama  ] administration . 
On March 16 , [ORG CASS  ] researcher [PER Zhang Ming  ] speculated to us that [LOC China  ] may want to invest in [ORG Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities  ] ( [ORG TIPS  ] ) or RMB-denominated assets , to protect its overseas investments . 
Professor [PER Yu Yongding  ] , also of [ORG CASS  ] and Director [PER Xiao Lian  ] 's superior , has long advocated that [LOC China  ] press the [LOC U.S.  ] to issue RMB-denominated debt , and at a recent conference [PER Yu  ] opined that [LOC China  ] should receive equities in [LOC U.S.  ] nationalized banks as collateral for its [LOC U.S.  ] investments . 
[PER Xiao  ] told us he has proposed that the [LOC U.S.  ] Government issue convertible bonds that [MISC Chinese  ] investors could convert into stocks ( presumably of financial institutions held by the [LOC U.S.  ] government ) . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Regarding Premier [PER Wen  ] 's remarks at the [ORG NPC  ] press conference , comments of this nature by senior [MISC Chinese  ] leaders , both public and private , are not new , although they have not been expressed so directly at such a senior level . 
Last fall on numerous occasions , Vice Premier [PER Wang Qishan  ] remarked to then-Secretary [PER Paulson  ] , both privately and during the public session of the [ORG Strategic Economic Dialogue  ] , on the need to " protect " [MISC Chinese  ] investments . 
Since then , officials from SAFE have repeatedly noted concerns about the risks of an adverse market reaction , in both the fixed income and foreign currency markets , to upcoming large gross issuances of [LOC U.S.  ] Government securities and the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] 's injections of liquidity . 
( Comment: the [LOC U.S.  ] dollar dropped significantly against major currencies following the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] 's announcement that it would be increasing [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000728 003 OF 003 significantly its purchases of various [LOC U.S.  ] fixed income instruments , including long-term [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] bonds ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comments of this sort do not imply that [LOC China  ] will attempt to dump its [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] holdings . 
Rather , they indicate that [LOC China  ] 's leaders are aware that , while they can purchase more or fewer USD-denominated assets at their margin , their holdings are so enormous that they cannot reallocate the currency composition of their portfolio to any meaningful extent without leading to large capital losses and thus further public -- and internal -- criticism. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We believe [PER Wen  ] 's remarks were most likely intended to acknowledge rising public criticism over the government 's losses on its investment of reserves ( fueled by high-profile losses by the [ORG China Investment Corporation  ] ( [ORG CIC  ] ) in [LOC Blackstone  ] and [ORG Morgan Stanley  ] ) . 
[PER Wen  ] also probably intended to maintain blame for [LOC China  ] 's current cyclical downturn on foreign factors , urge the [LOC U.S.  ] and others to act resolutely to restore financial stability and to stem the decline in financial assets ; signal to western governments that when intervening in financial institutions not to trample on the claims of foreign investors ( e.g. , as was done to [LOC China  ] 's [ORG Ping An  ] insurance company with its investment in [LOC Belgium  ] 's [ORG Fortis  ] ) ; and , avoid surprises that could adversely impact the claims of senior creditors . 
Ironically , one of the largest [ORG USG  ] interventions in financial institutions to date was in [ORG Freddie Mac  ] and [ORG Fannie Mae  ] , where it agreed to inject up to USD 400 billion in capital to keep the institutions solvent . 
As former Secretary [PER Paulson  ] noted , this " effectively guarantees " claims of senior creditors , the largest of which is most likely SAFE .
