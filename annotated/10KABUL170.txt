<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 [LOC KABUL  ] 000170 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/20/2020 TAGS PGOV , PREL , AF SUBJECT: SRAP MEETING WITH KARZAI: MOVING REINTEGRATION POLICY TOWARDS [LOC LONDON  ] Classified By: Ambassador [PER Karl Eikenberry  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: President [PER Karzai  ] told [PER S/SRAP Holbrooke  ] January 16 that he wants to announce a reintegration policy before [LOC London  ] but save the details of the plan for a rollout at the [LOC Kabul  ] conference in late spring . 
[PER Karzai  ] is still conflicted about finalizing the policy , according to several observers , but has apparently grasped that a pre-London announcement can leverage donations and other support from key nations , especially the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
He said that elections “were likely to slip a few months” although media reports indicated that he told [PER Holbrooke  ] ( and [LOC UK  ] FM Milliband , who he saw later that day ) that the elections would be “on time.” On transition and a [ORG NATO  ] SCR , Karzai’s position tracks with ours and he promised to raise his concerns with the [LOC UK  ] . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- -------- Reviewing 2009 - New [ORG Policies Literally Bearing Fruit  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a relaxed one-hour meeting with President [PER Karzai  ] , his newly-confirmed Foreign Minister [PER Zalmay Rassoul  ] , and four other senior advisors , SRAP [PER Holbrooke  ] , Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] and [ORG SRAP Senior Advisor  ] [PER Barney Rubin  ] discussed developments since Karzai’s November 2009 inauguration . 
[PER Karzai  ] spoke first about the [LOC Haiti  ] earthquake and expressed sympathy at the tragedy from “a country that truly understands.” He said that one of his servants had asked him to do something for [LOC Haiti  ] and he planned to do so - the Palace announced a gift of $200,000 later that day. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] noted that the night before the [LOC Embassy/ISAF  ] team had briefed President [MISC Obama  ] on progress since the elections ; this was also a moment to review the nearly one year of the [MISC Obama Administration’s  ] work in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Since the new [MISC Obama  ] strategy was articulated , [PER Holbrooke  ] said , the impact on areas such as agriculture have been tremendous . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed and said that the recent visit by [ORG Agriculture Secretary Vilsak  ] had been extremely positive . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] said that with about $400 million in [LOC U.S.  ] assistance , and more from other key donors such as [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC India  ] , [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] agricultural sector was poised to succeed . 
The next stage , [PER Karzai  ] and [PER Holbrooke  ] agreed , would be the re-establishment of an [ORG Agricultural Development Bank  ] by the end of 2010. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] said that [LOC Afghanistan  ] does have excellent ministers such as Minister of [ORG Agriculture Rahimi  ] , who [PER Holbrooke  ] said [PER Vilsack  ] had praised as “world-class” but lacks capable administrators on almost every level . 
The brain drain of the war years was enormous , [PER Karzai  ] said , and claimed that luring back expatriates would not succeed since now they were “too costly” to keep. --------------------------------- Conferences: “Will [LOC Kabul  ] Happen ? ” --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] will attend the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] ; [PER Holbrooke  ] noted that he and [PER NSA Jones  ] would likely attend and that the [MISC Germans  ] hoped to make it a productive event . 
He said that the recent [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] conference of Special Representatives for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] had been very useful , especially with the presentations by Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] and [PER Mosoom Stanekzai  ] , the architect of the new reintegration policy . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] noted than an unusually high number of [MISC Muslim  ] nations had been represented in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] sending a lower-level delegate ( for mainly internal reasons . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) While the original intention had been to hold the [LOC Kabul  ] meeting ahead of [LOC London  ] , [PER Holbrooke  ] said , our interest now was to make the January 28 [LOC London  ] conference a success . 
This is a time to rally world support for [PER Karzai  ] and for the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy , he said . 
A “big headline” that showed the way forward and consolidated this support is the desired outcome of this conference , [PER Holbrooke  ] said , rather than pledging of money or troops ; the best headline would be something like “the world community supports President [PER Karzai  ] and his reintegration plan.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] agreed but asked , ”will a [LOC Kabul  ] conference actually happen” in view of the international focus and efforts that have been expended on [LOC London  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] visitors turned the question around to ask [PER Karzai  ] if he plans to hold the conference and invite international attendees . 
[PER Karzai  ] countered by asking “will the Secretary attend , ” we answered that this is the current [LOC U.S.  ] intention and he said that his proposed timing would be in April. ---------------------------------------- [ORG Reintegration: Reassurance  ] from the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC KABUL  ] 00000170 002 OF 003 ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Regarding progress to date in establishing both a reintegration policy and a reconciliation approach for [ORG Taliban  ] fighters and political leaders , respectively , [PER Karzai  ] indicated that he was close to finalizing the new [MISC Afghan  ] policy . 
Claiming that he had only read the new draft [ORG National Security Council  ] policy papers the night before , [PER Karzai  ] said that he “liked this plan more than the previous ones.” He believes that this approach will given foot soldiers lots of incentive to turn , while [PER Rassoul  ] noted that during his lobbying efforts he had spoken to nearly 200 [MISC MPs  ] and eighty percent were in favor of reintegration . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] asked if this applied to women MPs who are especially important to this effort ; [PER Rassoul  ] said that if they are given the full information about the program they are less skeptical . 
( Note: SRAP [PER Holbrooke  ] met with seven female MPs on January 17 - septel . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite his positive feeling about the plan , [PER Karzai  ] said , before “technicalities” are figured out he wants to be sure he has understanding and political backing from all relevant quarters - most importantly from the [LOC United States  ] . 
Next , he wants [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s political support as well as any financial resources they might contribute . 
[PER Rubin  ] noted that the [MISC Saudi  ] officials he had visited a week ago are prepared to not only back the plan politically but to offer Hajj/Umrah “packages” to reintegrees , which would offer a strong religious motivation and undercut the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] may also offer deradicalization program advice , [PER Rubin  ] said . 
( Note: [PER Karzai  ] said that [MISC Saudi  ] programs were probably too “hard core” for the “country bumpkins” they believe are currently filling the [ORG Taliban  ] ranks , but the offer is appreciated . 
End note . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] turned to the issue of ensuring Pakistan’s support for the policy since “neither reintegration nor reconciliation would work without them.” If they are not on board it will be “the same vicious cycle of trial - failure - trial - partial success” that previous reintegration plans have faced . 
In [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , [PER Holbrooke  ] said , senior [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Jordanian  ] , [MISC Afghan  ] , [MISC Saudi  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] officials discussed this issue and all had stressed to [LOC Pakistan  ] that they had to support this policy . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] countered that the “totality of the [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] relationship” should be reassessed ; [PER Karzai  ] said that “we are beginning to see that point.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Holbrooke  ] assured [PER Karzai  ] that [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] current reintegration draft policy has the backing of the [LOC U.S.  ] and seems to have strong [LOC Gulf  ] buy-in , which [PER Karzai  ] flagged as crucial to psychologically undermining the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] would not prevent this from happening as it had in the past , [PER Holbrooke  ] said ; on the contrary we plan to help fund the plan . 
However , “we are all waiting on you” to announce exactly what the plan will contain , he said to [PER Karzai  ] , and to make maximum use of [LOC London  ] that announcement should occur before January 28 . 
[PER Karzai  ] asked whether the plan was really for [LOC London  ] or [LOC Kabul  ] - [PER Eikenberry  ] explained that to leverage the window of opportunity that was now open for contributions by the [MISC Japanese  ] , [LOC Gulf  ] states and [LOC Europe  ] there should be a conceptual plan in time for [LOC London  ] . 
Real implementation , especially given donor funding mechanisms , could wait for the [ORG Kabul Conference  ] announcement of modalities. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] gave more details about his concept for a “Loya [ORG Jirga”  ] which would reaffirm the [MISC Afghan  ] partnership with the international community and also endorse the reintegration plan and reconciliation efforts . 
It could occur before the [ORG Kabul Conference  ] , he said , and would involve 500-1000 people including [MISC MPs  ] and traditional leaders . 
He compared it to the gathering of 1200 people who approved the 2005 [ORG Strategic Partnership Agreement  ] before he flew to [LOC Washington  ] to sign the [ORG Agreement  ] with President [PER Bush  ] . 
He reassured [PER Holbrooke  ] and [PER Eikenberry  ] that “some people will shout” but that the [MISC Afghan  ] way is to complain first , then support. ------------------------------------ Elections: I Won’t Mention In [LOC London  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Holbrooke  ] noted the ongoing “confusion” over 2010 elections , and advised that in order to avoid a pointless debate in [LOC London  ] [PER Karzai  ] should either clarify his position on the timing of elections or take the issue off the table . 
[PER Krazai  ] said that he is not planning to mention elections in his speech at [LOC London  ] - there is no time to discuss this issue and that it wasn’t the right venue to bring up such an internal matter . 
The [ORG Independent Electoral Commission  ] , with reference to the [LOC Constitution  ] , would come up with a new date that is likely to be “a few months” after May , he said . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00000170 003 OF 003 [PER Eikenberry  ] noted that while it was clear that elections should stick to the constitutional timeframe of 2010 , the exact date and the conditions - including reforms - still have to be determined . 
[PER Karzai  ] pushed for [LOC U.S.  ] funding of the elections on the grounds that “democracy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has been your big achievement.” In a later aside , Chief of [PER Staff Daudzai  ] told [PER Eikenberry  ] that if the [ORG Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior  ] make the case for an election delay , the [ORG IEC  ] would accept it . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] offered to have international community representatives then meet with the [ORG IEC  ] to be briefed on the reasons for the new election date and show our support. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In later discussions with FM Milliband , he indicated his concern that the elections would take place without any reforms , and in fact expressed his view that a 2010 date was not his preference since it would not allow for significant changes . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] noted to him that without improvements we were not planning to fund the elections . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] said that he had pressed [PER Karzai  ] in an earlier meeting on the issue of the [ORG IEC  ] having mishandled the elections at a provincial level . 
Even with [MISC Karzai’s  ] myopia ( [PER Karzai  ] absolves the [ORG IEC  ] at a national level from wrongdoing and blames the [ORG ECC  ] for the allegations of fraud ) he accepts that the [ORG IEC  ] provincial authorities mishandled their duties . 
[PER Daudzai  ] noted that [ORG IEC  ] Chairman [PER Ludin  ] ‘should have returned by now’ but is still outside [LOC Afghanistan.  ] ----------------------- [ORG NATO  ] SCR and Transition ----------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On another potential point of discussion in [LOC London  ] , the civilian “counterpart” to General McChrystal , [PER Karzai  ] said that he did not understand or accept the concept of a high-level [ORG NATO  ] “Senior Civilian Representative” with powers and responsibilities commensurate with [MISC COMISAF.  ] “In fact , I don’t meet with the current [ORG NATO  ] SCR , ” [PER Karzai  ] said , adding that he would foresee “conflict” if there were two empowered [ORG NATO  ] representatives . 
For PRT coordination the nation who controls the PRT should take the lead on development in that area , [PER Karzai  ] said . 
This cable was cleared by Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] .
