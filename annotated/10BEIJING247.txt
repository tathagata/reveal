( C ) Summary . 
Despite media reports quoting [ORG Google  ] officials in the [LOC U.S.  ] as saying [ORG Google  ] is in talks with [LOC China  ] , [ORG a Ministry  ] of [ORG Commerce  ] official told a visiting [LOC U.S.  ] delegation on January 28 that " it would be better if [ORG Google  ] stopped telling the media that it is in negotiations with [LOC China  ] , since it is not . 
" However , a [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] official told [ORG Poloff  ] earlier this week there is going to be a " meeting in [LOC Davos  ] " that [LOC China  ] hopes " will resolve everything in an extremely low-key and quiet manner . 
" Separately , several [MISC U.S.-China  ] dialogues related to IT issues were unexpectedly postponed by [LOC China  ] this week due to the purported unavailability of key officials who had previously confirmed to attend . 
It is unclear , however , whether the postponements are related . 
[ORG Google  ] remained the hot topic this week among our contacts in [LOC China  ] , s information technology ( IT ) industry , with those in foreign firms generally supportive and appreciative of the Secretary , s speech on internet freedom . 
Expat executives said that while they expect the [ORG USG  ] 's highlighting of internet freedom and requests for an investigation of [ORG Google  ] 's allegations will lead to frictions with [LOC China  ] , they welcomed the intervention in what they see as an increasingly difficult operating environment . 
End summary . 
[ORG GOOGLE  ] REMAINS HOT ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Google  ] 's decision to potentially walk away from [LOC China  ] 's market of nearly 400 million internet users continues to spark extensive discussion on a range of important related issues: censorship and information flow ; principled versus bottom-line decision-making ; protection of corporate proprietary information and intellectual property ; and how companies can effect positive change from within a foreign economy . 
Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's January 21 speech on Internet freedom touched a nerve in [LOC China  ] 's leadership ( reftel ) , and rightly so according to our local business contacts who regularly cite the increasingly challenging business climate in [LOC China  ] . 
[MISC Locally-based  ] western businessmen and consultants are viewing [ORG Google  ] 's confrontation with the [MISC Chinese  ] authorities with a fascinated mix of admiration and caution , though few are willing to bet on the ultimate outcome. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Western  ] companies [MISC Chinese  ] employees are , not surprisingly , sometimes more sympathetic to the [LOC PRC  ] , s position . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that [ORG Google  ] has played matters badly , suggesting it should have tried to help [LOC PRC  ] authorities understand what [ORG Google  ] provides " is good for [LOC China  ] . 
" [PER Xiao  ] stated he thinks [ORG Google  ] approache the problem incorrectly , citing [PER Bill Gates'  ] position that companies must " follow the laws of the country in which they operate . 
" [PER Xiao  ] also intimated that , as a [MISC Chinese  ] citizen , he could empathize with the [MISC Chinese  ] government’s fears that [ORG Google  ] 's services could be used by [PER Dalai Lama  ] supporters to publicize their views throughout [LOC China  ] . 
[PER Liu Tao  ] , [ORG Government Affairs Manager  ] for [MISC Caterpillar  ] , notes that the parties involved in the [ORG Google  ] issue should discuss the issue without " being so emotional . 
" [PER Liu  ] , a [MISC Chinese  ] citizen , said that the [MISC Chinese  ] government was " not acting emotionally " over this issue . 
PREDICTIONS FOR A RESOLUTION ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A visiting [MISC London-based  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] executive believes the [ORG Google  ] matter was a " good shaking of the tree for [LOC China  ] issues needing greater visibility . 
Although he predicted impact from [ORG Google  ] would not necessarily change the game for [MISC European  ] interests here , he noted that [ORG Google  ] has established close relations with [LOC UK  ] Conservatives , and predicted a potential future [ORG Conservative  ] government would be very supportive of the tenets in Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's recent speech . 
Another Beijing-based [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] consultant compared [ORG Google  ] , s experience to [ORG Intel  ] , which in 2003 threatened to withdraw from [LOC China  ] after [MISC Chinese  ] authorities sought to impose technological modifications to its encryption- enabled products . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] government ultimately backed down , but our local contact believes [MISC Chinese  ] payback continues today and is one reason [LOC China  ] insists that homegrown technology be [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000247 002 OF 003 co-installed in any [MISC WI-FI-enabled  ] phones/communication devices . 
The latter local contact further suggested [ORG Google  ] could pursue resolution of its current impasse by lobbying technologically-enlightened senior statesmen , especially more pro-business ones , who might sway [LOC China  ] 's leadership to address [ORG Google  ] 's censorship issues more moderately. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Many contacts have opined that it appears [ORG Google  ] will likely remain in [LOC China  ] , albeit with a more limited presence , i.e. , without a search engine service . 
Although [ORG Google  ] has firmly positioned itself on censorship matters and hence will likely have little choice but to take down its Google.cn search site , they believe [ORG Google  ] executives' public statements and vested interests still coincide with maintaining at least some presence in [LOC China  ] . 
LONG TERM OUTLOOK POSITIVE , SHORT TERM FALLOUT --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Another IT association representative told Econoff that interest in the [ORG Google  ] case " highlights the growing number of [MISC Chinese  ] measures and policy goals that diminish the investment environment in [MISC China...  ] part of a troubling pattern that is making it increasingly difficult for foreign firms to do business . 
" Business contacts told [ORG ConGen Shanghai  ] that they " welcome a more assertive voice on behalf of the [LOC U.S.  ] While it may not be good for [MISC U.S.-China  ] relations in the short term , it will be better in the long term . 
We need to stand for what we believe in . 
" Injecting a more cautionary note , however , another [LOC Shanghai  ] businessmen warns that " [LOC America  ] will not advance its objectives with regard to the bilateral relationship by telling the [MISC Chinese  ] government that it is working to put new internet technologies into the hands of dissidents . 
In this particular face-off , at least , the [MISC Chinese  ] are 's pinning' the issue far more effectively than the [MISC Americans  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Fallout beyond [LOC China  ] 's borders continues . 
Two governmental dialogues ( the [ORG U.S. China ICT Consultations  ] , previously scheduled for February 9 , 2010 , and the [ORG DOC-Ministry of Industry  ] and [ORG Information Technology  ] on February 2 , 2010 - both in [LOC Washington DC  ] ) were postponed this week due to purported unavailability of key officials who had previously confirmed to attend . 
[ORG Congen Shanghai  ] has found many IPR-related meetings cancelled this week . 
Interestingly , officials from the [MISC Swedish  ] Embassy were summoned to the [ORG MFA  ] to receive a protest of statements made by the [MISC Swedish  ] FM supportive of Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's speech on Internet Freedom . 
According to our [MISC Swedish  ] contacts , the [ORG MFA  ] charged the [MISC Swedes  ] with damaging ties during the 60th anniversary of [MISC Chinese-Swedish  ] diplomatic relationship . 
WHAT'S DRIVING [LOC CHINA  ] -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to another well-respected tech sector analyst here , a number of historical , cultural , and technological factors have coalesced to put [LOC China  ] in a technologically-aggressive state-of-mind . 
One contributing factor was [ORG Microsoft  ] 's flubbed 2004 " black screen " strategy to deter intellectual property theft by darkening computer monitors running unlicensed Windows operating software . 
This consultant believes that example of [LOC U.S.  ] technology effectively wielding power over [LOC China  ] 's personal computers helped spur [LOC China  ] 's aggressive campaign for source codes and its own technology . 
This , combined with growing [MISC Chinese  ] pride , economic clout and influence , and the " weakened " position of the [LOC U.S.  ] and its allies after the global economic downturn , are emboldening the [MISC Chinese  ] to take ever more aggressive positions in advancing its innovative industries at the expense of foreign ones. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) A local [ORG Microsoft  ] executive applauds the Secretary 's speech and the [ORG Administration  ] 's commitment " to organize sustained , targeted , persistent engagement on the full range of [MISC Internet-related  ] issues " with [LOC China  ] . 
This executive said the Secretary 's remarks were " right on point , " particularly for companies who " desperately need the help of the [ORG USG  ] " in the face of " harassment , threats and actual shutdowns of service , threats of licenses being revoked , resistance to provide legal authority , mandates to place servers in [LOC China  ] , etc . 
" Our local [MISC APCO  ] contact described the [ORG Google  ] issue as a " stirring of the beehive , " but says the kind of harassment [ORG Microsoft  ] describes is a fact of worsening life here which [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000247 003 OF 003 the [ORG Google  ] incident only helps spotlight .
