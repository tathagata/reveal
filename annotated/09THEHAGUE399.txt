Gallagher  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
Mr. President: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) As indicated in our overview cable , [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] hopes to limit discussion to four major topics during his meeting with the President: Afghanistan/Pakistan ; the economic crisis/G20 ; [LOC Middle East Peace  ] Process/Iran ; and climate change . 
He will also mention the [ORG New York  ] 400 celebration , hoping you will agree to see the [LOC Crown Prince  ] at the [LOC White House  ] in September . 
These are discussed discussed below . 
Other possible topics are discussed in a separate cable. -------------------- Afghanistan/Pakistan -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] will share his expectations on what the [MISC Dutch  ] can contribute in [LOC Afghanistan  ] post-2010 . 
We have recently asked the [MISC Dutch  ] to remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] after 2010 to run the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] but not , necessarily , to remain as lead nation in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
We also want them to continue to supply enablers and trainers for the [ORG ISAF  ] mission as well as providing financial assistance for [ORG ISAF  ] initiatives. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] , past and current efforts put them at the forefront of our Allies . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have been in [LOC Afghanistan  ] since December 2001 . 
They are the lead nation in [LOC Uruzgan  ] with [ORG PRT  ] [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] and combat elements . 
They are also mid-way through their second one-year command of [ORG Regional Command South  ] ( [ORG RC-South  ] ) at [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
Their commitment includes 1,800 personnel and such critical enablers as F-16s , helicopters , intelligence assets , special forces , and medical units . 
In addition , they have devoted more than 220 million euro ( USD 305 million ) in aid to [LOC Afghanistan  ] since 2006 . 
On short notice , they hosted the March 2009 [ORG UN Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] which gained international acceptance of our strategic review . 
They are also proud of their growing international reputation for their implementation of a 3-D approach ( defense , development and diplomacy ) in [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) We understand [PER Balkenende  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] , and Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] have been drumming up support in the [ORG Cabinet  ] for continued deployment in [LOC Uruzgan  ] beyond 2010 , scaling back to about 500 troops ( providing force protection for [ORG PRT  ] operations in effect ) , relinquishing lead nation status but still providing enablers and development assistance . 
The stumbling block so far has been the [ORG Labor Party  ] leader , [PER Wouter Bos  ] , Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister . 
Several factors make an extension a difficult decision for [PER Bos  ] . 
A majority of the [MISC Dutch  ] public does not strongly support the military deployment , and several politicians have pledged to pull [MISC Dutch  ] troops out of [LOC Uruzgan  ] in 2010 . 
Many MPs are also concerned about the effect the deployment has on military readiness and recruitment -- [MISC Dutch  ] forces have a shortfall of approximately 7,000 personnel ( out of a total of 43,000 , a 16% shortfall ) . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] media report that the [ORG ISAF  ] mission is not successful in bringing security to the region and that [MISC Dutch  ] aid is ineffective ( the [ORG Labor Party  ] holds the development portfolio in the [ORG Cabinet  ] as well ) . 
There is also a growing sentiment that the [MISC Dutch  ] have done enough and it is time for other countries , such as [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] , to do more . 
Qother countries , such as [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] , to do more. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) FM [PER Verhagen  ] recently told us , as well as [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [ORG NATO  ] Daalder , that the [ORG Labor Party  ] could probably support staying in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in some role , just not in [LOC Uruzgan  ] ( a step that makes no sense given the depth of [MISC Dutch  ] experience in [LOC Uruzgan  ] ) . 
[ORG Labor Party  ] staff indicated a willingness to continue some sort of mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( even in [LOC Uruzgan  ] ) if the issue were framed in terms of continuing [MISC Dutch  ] development and stability efforts . 
[PER Balkenende  ] , the Foreign Minister and others expressed to us their frustrations caused by their [ORG Labor  ] partners , and have asked our help in bringing [ORG Labor  ] around. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) In the President 's discussions with [PER Balkenende  ] and with the press ( at the end of the meeting ) , the President may THE HAGUE 00000399 002 OF 004 want to stress: - our appreciation for the long-standing and significant [MISC Dutch  ] contribution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , specifically in [LOC Uruzgan  ] ; - we see the [MISC Dutch  ] as a valued partner in Allied efforts to address a common threat in a dangerous region ; - while it is an internal decision by the [MISC Dutch  ] whether they stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , we hope they will continue with other Allies in [ORG ISAF  ] as it implements its new strategy ; and - ( perhaps most importantly ) , we hope they will continue their stability and development efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] to build upon the [MISC Dutch  ] achievements there. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] welcomed the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategic link between [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , but they keep a low profile on their generous aid programs in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
They have pledged 86.7 million euro ( USD 120 million ) in development aid over the next three years , as well as 3.5 million euro ( USD 4.9 million ) in immediate aid for [LOC Pakistan  ] , s internally displaced persons . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are perplexed , however , by [LOC Pakistan  ] , s weak democratic credentials and disorganized aid programs . 
Nonetheless , [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] contacts have indicated [PER Balkenende  ] may be prepared in the meeting to announce additional aid to [LOC Pakistan.  ] ---------- [PER Guantanamo  ] ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) In the President 's private meeting , he may want to ask [PER Balkenende  ] to accept [PER Guantanamo  ] detainees , but recognize [PER Balkenende  ] and other [ORG Cabinet  ] members have already said publicly the [LOC Netherlands  ] will not/not accept detainees . 
In a July 5 radio interview , [PER Balkenende  ] said he expected the President to ask the [LOC Netherlands  ] to consider taking some [PER Guantanamo  ] detainees , " " We have already said no to this request , but we will discuss the issue . 
There are legal obstacles to taking in these prisoners . 
Still , he left the door open , saying it was a complex issue and he is willing to discuss it , possibly in a [MISC European  ] context . 
On June 30 , FM [PER Verhagen  ] told us privately the [LOC Netherlands  ] " " will accept detainees if that , s what it takes to close [PER Guantanamo  ] . 
" " Taking detainees would be difficult and could cause the government to fall because the decision would strengthen the [MISC Dutch  ] turn to the right , giving [MISC Wilders  ] ammunition to feed the flames of [MISC Dutch  ] anti-immigrant fears . 
Given these constraints , the [MISC Dutch  ] have looked for other ways to be helpful . 
FM [PER Verhagen  ] is funding a two-year study of the nexus of human rights , humanitarian law , and use of force , with an eye toward resolving the knotty legal issues surrounding [PER Guantanamo  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] may also be willing to support funding to transfer of detainees to third countries. ------------------- Economic Crisis/G20 ------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] financial sector was hit hard by the global financial crisis , due in part to exposure to [LOC U.S.  ] mortgage-backed securities and other toxic assets . 
The government responded assertively with several measures to assist banks and their customers , most dramatically by nationalizing the [MISC Dutch  ] operations of [ORG Fortis Bank  ] and spending a controversial USD 36 billion to bail out the new [MISC Fortis/ABN AMRO  ] entity , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , largest bank . 
The contagion in the financial sector has spread throughout the [MISC Dutch  ] economy , now in recession since the first quarter of <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
After four consecutive years of GDP growth , the [MISC Q2009  ] . 
After four consecutive years of GDP growth , the economy is expected to shrink by 4.75 percent in 2009 . 
Exports are expected to decline 16.75 percent this year - a precipitous drop for the [LOC Netherlands  ] , small , open economy which depends on foreign trade . 
Unemployment is rising and likely will reach 9.5 percent by 2010 . 
[PER Balkenende  ] , s government introduced three economic stimulus packages between November 2008 and March 2009 , including subsidies for clean energy projects , corporate tax breaks , expanded export credit insurance facilities , and accelerated infrastructure projects . 
The [ORG Cabinet  ] remains committed to an incremental , cautious approach of giving these stimulus measures time to work before embarking on new ones . 
Meanwhile , the budget surplus that the [LOC Netherlands  ] enjoyed in recent years has disappeared as a result of the stimulus programs , with a THE HAGUE 00000399 003 OF 004 deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP expected by 2010 . 
[PER Balkenende  ] now faces the difficult question of how to promote economic recovery while keeping the deficit in check. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Balkenende  ] remains a staunch believer in international cooperation as the only means of bringing about economic recovery at home and abroad . 
In keeping with the [MISC Dutch  ] tradition of multilateralism , [PER Balkenende  ] supports the work of the [ORG G20  ] and expanded roles for the [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] champion much broader financial regulation - and standards for corporate responsibility . 
They are keenly interested in the plight of developing countries in the economic crisis and continue to push the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG UN  ] , and international financial institutions to develop programs to address this issue . 
This focus is in keeping with the strong [MISC Dutch  ] tradition of assistance to the developing world . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] provide a fixed 0.8 percent of GDP - over USD 7 billion - in development aid annually , making the [LOC Netherlands  ] the world 's fourth largest aid donor as a percentage of GDP and the sixth largest in absolute terms . 
[PER Balkenende  ] will seek the President 's views on the pace of economic recovery and how the [LOC Netherlands  ] can play a constructive role , particularly to assist developing countries. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] considers participation in the [ORG G20  ] a critical measure of the [LOC Netherlands  ] , international stature and will push hard for an invitation to the [LOC Pittsburgh  ] summit . 
This is THE key deliverable he hopes to secure from this meeting . 
( Note: Finance Minister Bos asked Treasury Secretary [PER Geithner  ] for a [ORG G20  ] invitation during their June 29 meeting in [LOC Washington  ] ; the Secretary indicated the [LOC White House  ] would make a decision after the July 8-10 G8 summit . 
End note . 
) [MISC Dutch  ] participation in the [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC London  ] summits were major wins for the [LOC Netherlands  ] ; [PER Balkenende  ] will argue that the [MISC Dutch  ] deserved those invitations , and that the practice should continue . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] point out the [LOC Netherlands  ] is the 5th largest economy in the [ORG EU  ] , the 16th largest in the world , and has the world , s 11th largest financial center . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are particularly supportive of the [ORG G20  ] , s calls for anti-protectionist trade and investment policies , reform of financial supervisory structures , including a prominent role for the new [ORG Financial Stability Board  ] , increased supervision of hedge funds , and more restrictive remuneration policies . 
[PER Balkenende  ] will argue that the [LOC Netherlands  ] , open financial sector has been significantly damaged by the crisis ; the [MISC Dutch  ] have the knowledge and experience to play a constructive role in [ORG G20  ] efforts to reform the international financial architecture and spur economic recovery ; the precedent for their [ORG G20  ] participation has already been set ; and they , therefore , deserve a seat in [LOC Pittsburgh.  ] -------------- Climate Change -------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] is keenly interested in climate change and pushes the [LOC Netherlands  ] to address the issue through ambitious , coordinated , global action . 
We expect him to praise renewed [LOC U.S.  ] leadership on climate but he probably will not stray from the common [ORG EU  ] position -- still hoping for a more aggressive medium-term [LOC U.S.  ] mitigation target . 
The [ORG GONL  ] has committed to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas ( [ORG GHG  ] ) emissions by 2020 relative to 1990 . 
[ORG Qgreenhouse  ] gas ( [ORG GHG  ] ) emissions by 2020 relative to 1990 . 
They want other top emitters to display a " " comparable effort " " in mitigating climate change , but they privately acknowledge that even a 20 percent [LOC U.S.  ] cut by 2020 is unrealistic . 
We share much common ground with the [MISC Dutch  ] on this issue . 
They see an international carbon market , heavy private sector involvement , and broad access to clean technologies as key parts of the solution . 
They support robust financing for developing countries that undertake serious mitigation commitments , and will insist such aid be allocated efficiently , accountably and transparently. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] will likely explain how tackling climate change is vital to the [LOC Netherlands  ] , as over 60 percent of its population and economic activity is located below sea-level . 
The devastation of Hurricane [PER Katrina  ] was a wake-up call for the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Yet despite their best intentions , [MISC Dutch  ] rhetoric far outstrips their deeds . 
[ORG Yale  ] , s 2008 [MISC Environmental Protection Index  ] ranked the [LOC Netherlands  ] 55th worldwide , placing it in the bottom fifth of [ORG EU  ] countries . 
( Note: The THE HAGUE 00000399 004 OF 004 [LOC United States  ] ranked 39th . 
End note . 
) The latest [ORG UN  ] figures reveal the [LOC Netherlands  ] reduced its total [ORG GHG  ] emissions by only 2 percent between 1990 and 2006 , leaving it a steep hill to climb to achieve its ambitious 30 percent target by 2020 . 
Local energy experts admit the [LOC Netherlands  ] has no chance of achieving the [ORG EU  ] , s 20 percent renewable energy target by <a id='par2020' href='#par2020'>¶</a>2020. ---------------- [LOC Middle East/Iran  ] ---------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] are eager to play a constructive role in the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] participate in the [LOC Gaza  ] maritime interdiction initiative to stop arms smuggling . 
Along with the [MISC Danish  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] have proposed resurrecting the [ORG EU  ] Gaza-Egypt border monitoring mission . 
At the same time , the [MISC Dutch  ] push for greater access for humanitarian aid in [LOC Gaza  ] , and they are substantial donors to [LOC Gaza  ] economic development and governance initiatives , providing 72 million euro ( USD 100 million ) in 2008 . 
FM Verhagen makes regular trips to the region ( he was last in [LOC Israel  ] at the end of June ) and is considering hosting a 2010 conference in support of peace efforts . 
They will be anxious to find ways to support our efforts in the region . 
They also welcome the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to engage [LOC Syria  ] and have been holding off expanding their ties with [LOC Syria  ] until there is greater human rights progress. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) On [LOC Iran  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] are tough-minded and have pushed the [ORG EU  ] to prepare a coordinated response to [LOC Iran  ] , s crackdown on protestors and the media . 
On the nuclear issue , the [MISC Dutch  ] strongly support the [ORG UN  ] sanctions regime and quickly follow up on efforts to curtail proliferation activities . 
Before the election crisis , the [MISC Dutch  ] embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] reported that sanctions were starting to work . 
The embassy also noted that acquiring nuclear capacity enjoyed wide support throughout [MISC Iranian  ] society . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are willing to deepen [MISC U.S.-Netherlands  ] cooperation on information sharing on [LOC Iran.  ] --------------------------------- [LOC New York  ] 400 - [ORG Crown  ] Prince Visit --------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] government is spending almost $10 million this year to highlight four hundred years of [MISC Dutch-American  ] friendship . 
This commemorates the 400th anniversary of the exploration of [LOC Manhattan  ] and its river system by [PER Henry Hudson  ] , an [MISC English  ] seaman working for a [MISC Dutch  ] company . 
The quadricentennial ( known as " " [MISC NY400  ] " " ) , with programs in [LOC New York  ] and [LOC Amsterdam  ] , weaves our shared history into what will be our shared future , expanding awareness of our similarities: our pioneering spirit and the values of freedom , democracy , openness , creativity , entrepreneurship , diversity and tolerance . 
In September , [ORG Crown  ] Prince [PER Willem-Alexander  ] and his wife , [PER Princess Maxima  ] , will visit [LOC New York  ] to participate in [MISC NY400  ] activities . 
The Prime Minister will ask if you can receive their [LOC Royal Highnesses  ] at the [LOC White House  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] stress the [ORG Crown  ] Prince will likely be king soon ( it is widely anticipated Queen [PER Beatrix  ] will abdicate within a year ) and this would be an opportunity for the President to meet the [ORG Crown  ] Prince in the context of the [MISC NY400  ] festivities . 
The [ORG Crown  ] Prince is a champion around the world for clean water and sanitation as a public health initiative. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 .
