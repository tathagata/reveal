PRISON CONDITIONS ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) After the two interrogations , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] wasnot questioned again , but returned to the crowded holding room . 
Prisoners were fed 2 pieces of bread three times a day and allowed to use the toilet twice a day . 
A bucket in the middle of the room served as a toilet between escorted bathroom breaks , but it constantly spilled and contaminated the room with urine and feces . 
Many prisoners could not talk due to the lack of water , their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths from thirst . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said prisoners believed [ORG ENSO  ] had placed informers in the prison cell to gain additional information .

[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] smuggled the diaries out also using the food trays . 
WITNESS TO TORTURE ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG ENSO  ] personnel regularly tortured prisoners imprisoned with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] .

His feet were tied together and a wooden pole was placed beneath his knees .

[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [ORG ENSO  ] later moved the container to a more remote part of the [LOC Camp  ] where other prisoners could not observe the torture . 
CHILDREN NOT SPARED ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that for a few days , approximately 35 boys , aged 8-13 , were confined with him .

( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was angry and nearly broke into tears a number of times . 
He said although the physical abuse and deprivations took a toll on his body , it was the psychological abuse of being packed in with so many other people , of not knowing when the next beatings would come , and believing he could be killed , that was the most damaging . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has probably been more candid about his experience than other [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who were incarcerated ( reftel ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was freed , with no explanation for his release or detention . 
[ORG ENSO  ] personnel warned him they would kill him if he told anyone . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of his detention and treatment . 
The [ORG ENSO  ] personnel refused to return his [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] or his demobilization card . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , his arrest occurred because the [ORG ENSO  ] official saw [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and noticed his father 's [MISC Ethiopian  ] last name .
