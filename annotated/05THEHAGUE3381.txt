( C ) SUMMARY . 
Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Matthew J. Bryza  ] 's recent visit to The [ORG Hague  ] featured lively discussion on integration and counter-radicalization issues currently the focus of intense debate in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Counterparts from [ORG Dutch Ministries  ] and [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] described the antecedents to the pervasive ethnic tension in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and defined challenges facing integration of the [MISC Muslim  ] community into traditional [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
[MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors shared DAS [PER Bryza  ] 's conviction that the [LOC Netherlands  ] must take a leading role in both integrating [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community members into mainstream [MISC Dutch  ] society , while satisfying second- and third-generation immigrants' thirst for connection with their families' [MISC Islamic  ] cultures . 
Though some interlocutors conveyed skepticism that the [MISC Muslim  ] community could integrate into the [MISC European  ] model of society , all counterparts conveyed deep interest in continued dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] in order to fight radicalization . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Matthew Bryza  ] discussed integration and radicalization of [MISC Muslim  ] communities in the [LOC Netherlands  ] with [MISC Dutch  ] counterparts on December 13 . 
A roundtable dialogue with interlocutors from the [ORG Ministries  ] of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] , [ORG Internal Affairs  ] , and [ORG Justice  ] and separate meetings with [MISC Dutch  ] Parliamentarians yielded insight into the broad ongoing debate in the [LOC Netherlands  ] surrounding efforts in [MISC Dutch  ] public and private sectors to counter extremism and foster integration of [ORG Dutch Muslim  ] communities . 
THE [MISC DUTCH  ] BEGIN TO EXAMINE WHAT'S UNDER THE CARPET --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Recent events have given impetus to [MISC Dutch  ] interest in integration and radicalization issues . 
[PER Peter Knoppe  ] ( [ORG Dutch National Counter-Terrorism Board  ] ) said that public discussion on the topics became increasingly polemical after the 2002 assassination of [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] , a [MISC Dutch  ] politician known for his anti-immigration position , and quite harsh after the murder last December of [MISC Dutch  ] filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] by a [MISC Muslim  ] extremist . 
[PER Saskia Tempelman  ] ( Policy Officer , Integration Department , [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ) explained that , as the [MISC Dutch  ] scrutinize the cultural progenitors of the current imbroglio , they begin to realize that the problem is exacerbated by ignorance -- a majority of native [MISC Dutch  ] think all immigrants to the [LOC Netherlands  ] are [MISC Muslim  ] when in fact only 54% are -- and denial . 
According to [PER Tempelman  ] , a lot of things ( about ethnic tension in the [LOC Netherlands  ] ) have been swept under the carpet . 
[PER Knoppe  ] pointed to a lack of opportunities for second- and third-generation [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Muslims  ] and the increase in access to extremist [MISC Muslim  ] messages via the internet as the primary origins of ethnic tension confronting contemporary [MISC Dutch  ] society. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] counterparts expressed grave concerns that [ORG Dutch Muslim  ] communities are radicalizing at a faster rate than in [LOC Turkey  ] or [LOC Morocco  ] . 
[PER Knoppe  ] said the Government of [LOC Morocco  ] has expressed concern to the [ORG GONL  ] that [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Moroccan  ] communities are an extremist threat in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
As discrimination against [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] intensifies , the backlash in the [MISC Muslim  ] community correspondingly increases ; [PER Coskun Coruz  ] ( [PER Parliamentarian  ] , [PER Christian Democrats  ] ) lamented that even secular communities of [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Muslims  ] are now showing signs of susceptibility to the lure of radicalization . 
[PER Fadime Orgu  ] ( [PER Parliamentarian  ] , Social Conservatives ) pointed to what she saw as the hypocrisy of the [ORG GONL  ] in promulgating separation of church and state on the one hand and subsidizing religious television and radio programming on the other , and argued that such religious programming exacerbated tensions between the native [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG Dutch Muslim  ] communities . 
THE WAY FORWARD: INTEGRATING [MISC DUTCH  ] [MISC MUSLIM  ] LEADERSHIP --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Though heightened focus has fostered greater [MISC Dutch  ] understanding of the integration and radicalization challenges they face , [MISC Dutch  ] policy to address the problems is nascent . 
[PER Tempelman  ] acknowledged that that the murder of van [PER Gogh  ] sped up the process leading to the incipience of [MISC Dutch  ] domestic integration and radicalization policies . 
Olthof explained that the [MISC Dutch  ] have not yet coordinated counter-radicalization and recruitment strategies with the governments of [LOC Morocco  ] or [LOC Egypt  ] . 
THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00003381 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors shared DAS [PER Bryza  ] 's assessment that the [LOC Netherlands  ] faces a dual challenge of integrating the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community into mainstream society , while satisfying second- and third-generation immigrants' thirst for connection with their families' [MISC Islamic  ] cultures . 
Maintaining this balance is critical to countering both the indignation of discrimination and the spiritual alienation that allow radical messages espoused by internet imams to take root in [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] youth . 
Counterparts agreed that an education program for [MISC Dutch  ] Imams is essential to this strategy . 
[PER Coruz  ] indicated that the CMO , the umbrella organization which claims to represent 80% of [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Muslims  ] , recently signed a gentlemen 's agreement with the [ORG GONL  ] to institutionalize a pedagogic process for [MISC Muslim  ] theology students in the [LOC Netherlands  ] that would feature an introductory period of a few years of general religious training followed by a few more years of focused training in [MISC Islam  ] , under the tutelage of moderate [MISC Muslim  ] instructors . 
[MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Muslims  ] of [MISC Turkish  ] descent , however , refused to sign the agreement . 
[PER Coruz  ] explained that the [MISC Turkish  ] Government 's Directorate of [ORG Religious Affairs  ] ( or [ORG Diyanet  ] ) , which administers mosques and regulates the practice of [LOC Islam  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] , seeks to ( and succeeds in ) exerting political influence over the [MISC Turkish-Dutch  ] community , encouraging [MISC Turkish-Dutch Muslims  ] to retain cultural connections with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER Coruz  ] and [PER Orgu  ] underscored the importance to integration efforts of convincing the [MISC Turkish-Dutch  ] community that [MISC Dutch  ] concepts of freedom of religion do not impinge on the contemporary [MISC Turkish  ] secularist ideology and urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to assist [MISC Dutch  ] integration efforts by encouraging the [ORG Diyanet  ] to soften its efforts to exert political influence over [MISC Turkish-Dutch Muslims  ] . 
DAS [PER Bryza  ] suggested that adapting the [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG Diyanet  ] 's model of moderate [MISC Islam  ] could be helpful to efforts to train moderate [MISC Dutch  ] Imams . 
Though [PER Orgu  ] thought the idea had merit , [PER Tempelman  ] indicated that the proposal faces a number of obstacles . 
[PER Tempelman  ] said the [ORG Diyanet  ] currently proscribes training of its Imams outside [LOC Turkey  ] and underscored that the [MISC Dutch  ] do not want foreign governments exercising control over [MISC Dutch  ] minorities . 
IS THERE A PLACE FOR [MISC MUSLIMS  ] AT THE [MISC DUTCH  ] TABLE ? --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Some [MISC Dutch  ] counterparts intimated that endeavors to integrate [MISC Muslims  ] into traditional [MISC Dutch  ] society may be futile: Henk [PER Jan Ormel  ] ( [PER Parliamentarian  ] , [PER Christian Democrats  ] ) -- the only native [MISC Dutch  ] [PER Parliamentarian  ] with whom DAS [PER Bryza  ] spoke -- confided that he believed the prospect of [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG EU  ] membership was the foremost reason that the [MISC Dutch  ] voted on October 3 against adopting the [ORG EU  ] Constitution . 
[PER Ormel  ] asserted that the roots of [LOC Europe  ] are in Christianity , not [MISC Islam  ] , adding , [MISC European  ] history has in fact been defined against [MISC Islam  ] . 
Though [PER Marnix Krop  ] ( Director General for [ORG European Cooperation  ] , [ORG MFA  ] ) indicated that since the October 3 referendum a majority of [MISC Dutch  ] have begun to favor [MISC Turkish  ] membership in the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Ormel  ] doubted that there had been any genuine change in the [MISC Dutch  ] electorate 's minds other than a cooling of tempers on the subject. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) DAS [PER Bryza  ] reacted warmly to [MISC Dutch  ] solicitations for [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation . 
He promised to share a paper he is currently writing after revising it pursuant to his consultations with [MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) DAS [PER Bryza  ] has cleared this cable .
