End Summary . 
RAPP’S COMMENTS RAISE CONCERN WITHIN THE [ORG GOL  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Chief Prosecutor [PER Stephen Rapp’s  ] ill considered announcement in the press February 24 that [PER Charles Taylor  ] may walk free because of a supposed budget shortfall for the [ORG Special Court  ] for [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , where [PER Taylor  ] is presently on trial , made headlines in the local press , and raised anxiety here about [LOC Taylor’s  ] imminent return . 
The [ORG GOL  ] was alarmed enough that President [PER Sirleaf  ] called Ambassador on February 28 to raise her concerns . 
[PER Sirleaf  ] pointed out that [MISC Liberia’s  ] stability remains fragile , and such remarks reverberated throughout the country , as people are still traumatized by [PER Taylor  ] and the war. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The press accounts out of The [ORG Hague  ] have also emboldened the pro-Taylor factions here , including his extended family members , financiers and [ORG National Patriotic Party  ] ( [ORG NPP  ] ) loyalists , raising their hopes that [PER Taylor  ] might be acquitted soon . 
Despite their rhetoric about “moving on , ” they have thus far refused to appear before the [ORG Truth and Reconciliation Commission  ] ( [ORG TRC  ] ) to account for their activities , and those on the [ORG UN Sanctions  ] lists continue to request delisting on the basis they have done nothing wrong rather than demonstrating what they have done to provide restitution for their activities . 
[ORG GOL  ] TREADING CAREFULLY WITH [PER TAYLOR  ] FACTIONS ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The government itself is caught in the middle . 
There is quite little the [ORG GOL  ] can do legally to arrest , prosecute or freeze assets of those who were close to [PER Taylor  ] , even if the political will were there , which remains an open question . 
The [ORG TRC  ] has recommended a domestic war crimes court be set up , but under statute an [ORG Independent National Commission  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] ( [ORG INHCR  ] ) would implement the recommendation , and the [ORG Legislature  ] ( some of whom had close ties to [PER Taylor  ] ) has thus far failed to establish the [ORG INCHR  ] . 
The [ORG Legislature  ] has also refused to pass any law that would allow the [ORG GOL  ] to freeze assets of those on the [ORG UN  ] sanctions list , and the [ORG Supreme Court  ] has ruled that any confiscation of property can be done only after a trial. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement  ] ( [ORG CPA  ] ) of August 2003 that ended the 14-year civil war , did not require the [ORG NPP  ] to disband and in fact permitted the [ORG NPP  ] to participate in the transitional government and in the 2005 elections . 
The [ORG NPP  ] now holds seven seats in the [ORG Legislature  ] ( which may be one reason the legislation is being blocked ) . 
As well , none of [LOC Taylor’s  ] properties have been seized by the government and they remain in good shape and remarkably free of squatters , as no one dares to take the risk of retribution . 
COMMUNICATIONS AMONG [PER TAYLOR  ] SUPPORTERS REMAIN STRONG --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The pro-Taylor forces still have the ability to organize themselves . 
An [ORG NPP  ] rally in December 2008 gathered a sizeable crowd , and [PER Taylor  ] supporters in June 2008 succeeded in preventing [ORG FBI  ] investigators from entering [LOC Taylor’s  ] residence “White Flower” to obtain evidence for the [PER Chucky Taylor  ] trial in [LOC Florida  ] . 
The most recent example was their effort on March 7 to disrupt the [ORG International Women’s Colloquium  ] . 
[PER Taylor  ] remains popular within many rural communities , especially in [LOC Bong  ] , [LOC Lofa  ] and [LOC Nimba  ] counties , and is seen as someone who was able to unite [MISC Liberia’s  ] different ethnic groups . 
We also suspect there is some sympathy within the [MISC Americo-Liberian  ] population who saw him as their deliverance from their losses following the 1979 coup . 
While we do not suggest they would want [PER Taylor  ] to return , we are sure that they do no want too many rocks to be turned over. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Although we do not have any direct evidence to support the belief that pro-Taylor factions are behind much of the [LOC MONROVIA  ] 00000188 002 OF 002 armed robbery on the premise that crime will keep the government weak and the country unstable , the [ORG GOL  ] is certainly convinced of this , and has taken steps to counteract the threat . 
The most recent act was to put [MISC Taylor-era  ] head of police [PER Paul Mulbah  ] into the [ORG LNP  ] as an “advisor” that some accuse ( and the government denies ) was in order to placate the [PER Taylor  ] people in advance of the March 7-8 [ORG International Women’s Colloquium  ] . 
That the [PER Taylor  ] crowd can still motivate such a reaction in the government is a testament to their influence. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Lines of communications within [LOC Taylor’s  ] faction , the [ORG National Patriotic Front of Liberia  ] ( [ORG NPFL  ] ) remain intact . 
To be sure , the disarmament of the factions following the [ORG CPA  ] has been extremely successful , and we have thus far been unable to confirm the existence of any large weapons caches , despite the persistent rumors . 
But the reintegration of the ex-combatants is far from complete . 
Former [ORG NPFL  ] commanders [PER Roland Duo  ] ( the only senior [PER Taylor  ] supporter to have testified before the [ORG TRC  ] ) , [PER Christopher  ] “General [PER Mosquito” Vambo  ] and [PER Melvin Sogbandi  ] ( none of whom are on the sanctions lists ) remain in contact with the ex-combatants , and would have the capability to organize an uprising or even criminal activity. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Certainly , the same is true for the other factions , the [ORG Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy  ] ( [ORG LURD  ] ) and the [ORG Movement for Democracy in Liberia  ] ( [ORG MODEL  ] ) . 
While apparently unarmed and not active in [LOC Liberia  ] , we continue to receive reports that [ORG LURD  ] is recruiting ex-combatants for militias in [LOC Guinea  ] and [ORG MODEL  ] is doing the same for [PER Cote  ] d’Ivoire . 
THREAT OF TAYLOR’S RETURN ADVANCES THEIR CAUSE --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The threat of a return of [PER Taylor  ] strengthens their hand and for now they see no need to give in at all . 
However , if [PER Taylor  ] is put away for a long time , the government may feel a bit bolder in recovering assets and bringing [PER Taylor  ] backers who committed war crimes to justice. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The international community has just a few tools to pressure the [PER Taylor  ] people into accepting the new reality . 
The [ORG UN  ] sanctions appear to have the intended effect of keeping them somewhat marginalized and fearful of further attempts to strip them of their ill-gotten gains . 
However , we have regularly heard of travel outside [LOC Liberia  ] of those on the travel ban list without prior approval . 
NEXT STEPS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ------------------------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) However , the best we can do for [LOC Liberia  ] is to see to it that [PER Taylor  ] is put away for a long time and we cannot delay for the results of the present trial to consider next steps . 
All legal options should be studied to ensure that [PER Taylor  ] cannot return to destabilize [LOC Liberia  ] . 
Building a case in the [LOC United States  ] against [PER Taylor  ] for financial crimes such as wire fraud would probably be the best route . 
There may be other options , such as applying the new law criminalizing the use of child soldiers or terrorism statutes. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The peace in [LOC Liberia  ] remains fragile , and its only guarantee is the robust and adaptable [ORG UNMIL  ] presence . 
The [ORG GOL  ] does not have the ability to quell violence , monitor its borders or operate independently to fight crime . 
A free [PER Taylor  ] could tip the balance in the wrong direction .
