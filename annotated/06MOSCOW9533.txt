Reason 1.4 ( b , d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Weddings are elaborate in [LOC Dagestan  ] , the largest autonomy in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
On August 22 we attended a wedding in [LOC Makhachkala  ] , Dagestan’s capital: [ORG Duma  ] member and [ORG Dagestan Oil Company  ] chief [PER Gadzhi Makhachev’s  ] son married a classmate . 
The lavish display and heavy drinking concealed the deadly serious [LOC North Caucasus  ] politics of land , ethnicity , clan , and alliance . 
The guest list spanned the [MISC Caucasus  ] power structure -- guest starring [MISC Chechen  ] leader [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] -- and underlined just how personal the region’s politics can be . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Dagestani  ] weddings are serious business: a forum for showing respect , fealty and alliance among families ; the bride and groom themselves are little more than showpieces . 
Weddings take place in discrete parts over three days . 
On the first day the groom’s family and the bride’s family simultaneously hold separate receptions . 
During the receptions the groom leads a delegation to the bride’s reception and escorts her back to his own reception , at which point she formally becomes a member of the groom’s family , forsaking her old family and clan . 
The next day , the groom’s parents hold another reception , this time for the bride’s family and friends , who can “inspect” the family they have given their daughter to . 
On the third day , the bride’s family holds a reception for the groom’s parents and family . 
Father of the [PER Groom  ] ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On August 22 , [PER Gadzhi Makhachev  ] married off his 19 year-old son Dalgat to [PER Aida Sharipova  ] . 
The wedding in [LOC Makhachkala  ] , which we attended , was a microcosm of the social and political relations of the [LOC North Caucasus  ] , beginning with Gadzhi’s own biography . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] started off as an [MISC Avar  ] clan leader . 
[PER Enver Kisriyev  ] , the leading scholar of [MISC Dagestani  ] society , told us that as [MISC Soviet  ] power receded from [LOC Dagestan  ] in the late 1980s , the complex society fell back to its pre-Russian structure . 
The basic structural unit is the monoethnic “jamaat , ” in this usage best translated as “canton” or “commune.” The ethnic groups themselves are a [MISC Russian  ] construct: faced with hundreds of jamaats , the 19th century [MISC Russian  ] conquerors lumped cantons speaking related dialects together and called them “Avar , ” “Dargin , ” etc. to reduce the number of “nationalities” in [LOC Dagestan  ] to 38 . 
Ever since then , jamaats within each ethnic group have been competing with one another to lead the ethnic group . 
This competition is especially marked among the [MISC Avars  ] , the largest nationality in [LOC Dagestan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As [MISC Russian  ] power faded , each canton fielded a militia to defend its people both in the mountains and the capital [LOC Makhachkala  ] . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] became the leader from his home canton of [LOC Burtunay  ] , in [LOC Kazbek Rayon  ] . 
He later asserted pan-Avar ambitions , founding the [PER Imam Shamil Popular Front  ] -- named after the great [MISC Avar  ] leader of mountaineer resistance to the [MISC Russians  ] -- to promote the interests of the [MISC Avars  ] and of [MISC Burtunay’s  ] role within the ethnic group . 
Among his exploits was a role in the military defense of [LOC Dagestan  ] against the 1999 invasion from [LOC Chechnya  ] by [PER Shamil Basayev  ] and al-Khattab , and his political defense of [MISC Avar  ] villages under pressure in [LOC Chechnya  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gadzhi  ] has cashed in the social capital he made from nationalism , translating it into financial and political capital -- as head of Dagestan’s state oil company and as the single-mandate representative for [LOC Makhachkala  ] in [LOC Russia’s State  ] [ORG Duma  ] . 
His dealings in the oil business -- including close cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] firms -- have left him well off enough to afford luxurious houses in [LOC Makhachkala  ] , [LOC Kaspiysk  ] , [LOC Moscow  ] , [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC San Diego  ] ; and a large collection of luxury automobiles , including the [ORG Rolls Royce Silver  ] Phantom in which Dalgat fetched [PER Aida  ] from her parents’ reception . 
( [PER Gadzhi  ] gave us a lift in the [ORG Rolls  ] once in [LOC Moscow  ] , but the legroom was somewhat constricted by the presence of a [MISC Kalashnikov  ] carbine at our feet . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] has survived numerous assassination attempts , as have most of the still-living leaders of [LOC Dagestan  ] . 
In [LOC Dagestan  ] he always travels in an armored [ORG BMW  ] with one , sometimes two follow cars full of uniformed armed guards . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gadzhi  ] has gone beyond his [MISC Avar  ] base , pursuing a multi-ethnic cadre policy to develop a network of loyalists . 
He has sent [MISC Dagestani  ] youths , including his sons , to a military type high school near [LOC San Diego  ] ( we met one graduate , a [MISC Jewish  ] boy from [LOC Derbent  ] now studying at [LOC San Diego  ] state . 
He has no plans to enter the [MISC Russian  ] military ) . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00009533 002 OF 005 Gadzhi’s multi-ethnic reach illustrates what the editor of the [MISC Dagestani  ] paper “Chernovik” told us: that in the last few years the development of inter-ethnic business clans has eroded traditional jamaat loyalties. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) But the [MISC Avar  ] symbolism is still strong . 
Gadzhi’s brother , an artist from [LOC St. Petersburg  ] , ordered as a wedding gift a life-sized statue of [PER Imam Shamil  ] . 
[PER Shamil  ] is the iconic national symbol , despite his stern and inflexible character ( portrayed in [LOC Tolstoy’s  ] “Hadji-Murat” as the mountaineers’ tyrannical counterpart to the absolutist [LOC Tsar  ] ) . 
Connection with [PER Shamil  ] makes for nobility among [MISC Avars  ] today . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] often mentions that he is a descendant on his mother’s side of [LOC Gair-Bek  ] , one of [MISC Shamil’s  ] deputies . 
The Day Before -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Gadzhi’s [LOC Kaspiysk  ] summer house is an enormous structure on the shore of the [MISC Caspian  ] , essentially a huge circular reception room -- much like a large restaurant -- attached to a 40-meter high green airport tower on columns , accessible only by elevator , with a couple of bedrooms , a reception room , and a grotto whose glass floor was the roof of a huge fish tank . 
The heavily guarded compound also boasts a second house , outbuildings , a tennis court , and two piers out into the [MISC Caspian  ] , one rigged with block and tackle for launching jet skis . 
The house filled up with visitors from all over the [MISC Caucasus  ] during the afternoon of August 21 . 
The [ORG Chair of Ingushetia’s  ] parliament drove in with two colleagues ; visitors from [LOC Moscow  ] included politicians , businessmen and an [MISC Avar  ] football coach . 
Many of the visitors grew up with [PER Gadzhi  ] in [LOC Khasavyurt  ] , including an [MISC Ingush  ] [MISC Olympic  ] wrestler named [PER Vakha  ] who seemed to be perpetually tipsy . 
Another group of Gadzhi’s boyhood friends from [LOC Khasavyurt  ] was led by a man who looked like [PER Shamil Basayev  ] on his day off -- flip-flops , t-shirt , baseball cap , beard -- but turned out to be the chief rabbi of [ORG Stavropol Kray  ] . 
He told us he has 12,000 co-religionists in the province , 8,000 of them in its capital , [LOC Pyatigorsk  ] . 
70 percent are , like him , Persian-speaking Mountain Jews ; the rest are a mixture of [MISC Europeans  ] , [MISC Georgians  ] and [MISC Bukharans.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Also present was [PER Chechnya’s Duma  ] member , [PER Khalid  ] ( aka [MISC Ruslan  ] ) [PER Yamadayev  ] , brother of the commander of the notorious [LOC Vostok Battalion  ] . 
He was reserved at the time , but in a follow-up conversation in [LOC Moscow  ] on August 29 ( please protect ) he complained that [LOC Chechnya  ] , lacking experts to develop programs for economic recovery , is simply demanding and disposing of cash from the central government . 
When we pressed him on disappearances , he admitted some took place , but claimed that often parents alleged their children had been abducted when in fact their sons had run off to join the fighters or -- in a case the week before -- they had murdered their daughter in an honor killing . 
We mentioned the abduction of a widow of [PER Basayev  ] , allegedly to gain access to his money . 
[PER Khalid  ] said he had not heard of the case , but knew that [PER Basayev  ] had had no interest in wealth ; he may have been a religious fanatic , but he was a “normal” person . 
The fighters who remain are not a serious military force , in Khalid’s view , and many would surrender under the proper terms and immunities . 
He himself is arranging the immunity of a senior official of the [LOC Maskhadov  ] era , whose name he would not reveal. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) During lunch , [PER Gadzhi  ] took a congratulatory call from Dagestan’s president , [PER Mukhu Aliyev  ] . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] told [PER Aliyev  ] how honored he would be if [PER Aliyev  ] could drop in at the wedding reception . 
There was a degree of tension in the conversation , which was between two figures each implicitly claiming the mantle of leadership of the [MISC Avars  ] . 
In the event , [PER Aliyev  ] snubbed [PER Gadzhi  ] and did not show up for the wedding , though the rest of Dagestan’s political leadership did. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Though Gadzhi’s house was not the venue for the main wedding reception , he ensured that all his guests were constantly plied with food and drink . 
The cooks seemed to keep whole sheep and whole cows boiling in a cauldron somewhere day and night , dumping disjointed fragments of the carcass on the tables whenever someone entered the room . 
Gadzhi’s two chefs kept a wide variety of unusual dishes in circulation ( in addition to the omnipresent boiled meat and fatty bouillon ) . 
The alcohol consumption before , during and after this [MISC Muslim  ] wedding was stupendous . 
Amidst an alcohol shortage , [PER Gadzhi  ] had flown in from the [ORG Urals  ] thousands of bottles of [ORG Beluga Export  ] vodka ( “Best consumed with caviar” ) . 
There was also entertainment , beginning even that day , with the big-name performers appearing both at the wedding hall and at Gadzhi’s summer house . 
Gadzhi’s main act , a [MISC Syrian-born  ] singer named [PER Avraam Russo  ] , could not make it because he was shot a few days before the wedding , but there [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00009533 003 OF 005 was a “gypsy” troupe from [LOC St. Petersburg  ] , a couple of [MISC Azeri  ] pop stars , and from [LOC Moscow  ] , [LOC Benya  ] the Accordion King with his family of singers . 
A host of local bands , singing in [MISC Avar  ] and Dargin , rounded out the entertainment , which was constant and extremely amplified. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The main activity of the day was eating and drinking -- starting from 4 p.m. , about eight hours worth , all told -- punctuated , when all were laden with food and sodden with drink , with a bout of jet skiing in the [MISC Caspian  ] . 
After dinner , though , the first band started an informal performance -- drums , accordion and clarinet playing the lezginka , the universal dance of the [MISC Caucasus  ] . 
To the uninitiated [MISC Westerner  ] , the music sounds like an undifferentiated wall of sound . 
This was a signal for dancing: one by one , each of the dramatically paunchy men ( there were no women present ) would enter the arena and exhibit his personal lezginka for the limit of his duration , usually 30 seconds to a minute . 
Each ethnic group’s lezginka was different -- the [MISC Dagestani  ] lezginka the most energetic , the [MISC Chechen  ] the most aggressive and belligerent , and the [MISC Ingush  ] smoother . 
Wedding Day 1 ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) An hour before the wedding reception was set to begin the “Marrakech” reception hall was full of guests -- men taking the air outside and women already filling a number of the tables inside , older ones with headscarves chaperoning dozens of teenaged girls . 
A [MISC Dagestani  ] parliamentarian explained that weddings are a principal venue for teenagers -- and more importantly their parents -- to get a look at one another with a view to future matches . 
Security was tight -- police presence on the ground plus police snipers positioned on the roof of an overlooking apartment block . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] even assigned one of his guards as our personal bodyguard inside the reception . 
The manager told [PER Gadzhi  ] there were seats for over a thousand guests at a time . 
At the height of the reception , it was standing room only. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) At precisely two p.m. the male guests started filing in . 
They varied from pols and oligarchs of all sorts -- the slick to the Jurassic ; wizened brown peasants from Burtunay ; and Dagestan’s sports and cultural celebrities . 
[PER Khalid Yamadayev  ] presided over a political table in the smaller of the two halls ( the music was in the other ) along with [LOC Vakha  ] the drunken wrestler , the [MISC Ingush  ] parliamentarians , a member of the [ORG Federation Council  ] who is also a nanophysicist and has lectured in [LOC Silicon Valley  ] , and Gadzhi’s cousin [PER Ismail Alibekov  ] , a submariner first rank naval captain now serving at the General Staff in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
The [MISC Dagestani  ] milieu appears to be one in which the highly educated and the gun-toting can mix easily -- often in the same person. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) After a couple of hours Dalgat’s convoy returned with [PER Aida  ] , horns honking . 
Dalgat and [PER Aida  ] got out of the [ORG Rolls  ] and were serenaded into the hall , and into the Makhachev family , by a boys’ chorus lining both sides of the red carpet , dressed in costumes aping medieval [MISC Dagestani  ] armor with little shields and swords . 
The couple’s entry was the signal for the emcee to roll into high gear , and after a few toasts the [MISC Piter  ] “gypsies” began their performance . 
( The next day one of Gadzhi’s houseguests sneered , “Some gypsies ! 
The bandleader was certainly [MISC Jewish  ] , and the rest of them were blonde.” There was some truth to this , but at least the two dancing girls appeared to be [PER Roma  ] . 
) <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) As the bands played , the marriageable girls came out to dance the lezginka in what looked like a slowly revolving conga line while the boys sat together at tables staring intently . 
The boys were all in white shirts and black slacks , while the girls wore a wide variety of multicolored but fashionable cocktail dresses . 
Every so often someone would shower the dancers with money -- there were some thousand ruble notes but the currency of choice was the [LOC U.S.  ] hundred dollar bill . 
The floor was covered with them ; young children would scoop the money up to distribute among the dancers. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Gadzhi  ] was locked into his role as host . 
He greeted every guest personally as they entered the hall -- failure to do so would cause great insult -- and later moved constantly from table to table drinking toasts with everyone . 
The 120 toasts he estimated he drank would have killed anyone , hardened drinker or not , but [PER Gadzhi  ] had his [MISC Afghan  ] waiter [PER Khan  ] following him around to pour his drinks from a special vodka bottle containing water . 
Still , he was much the worse for wear by evening’s end . 
At one point we caught up with him dancing with two scantily clad [MISC Russian  ] women who looked far from home . 
One , it turned out was a [LOC Moscow  ] poet ( later she recited an incomprehensible poem in [LOC Gadzhi’s  ] honor ) who [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00009533 004 OF 005 was in town with a film director to write the screenplay for a film immortalizing [MISC Gadzhi’s  ] defense of [LOC Dagestan  ] against [PER Shamil Basayev  ] . 
By 6 p.m. most of the houseguests had returned to [LOC Gadzhi’s  ] seaside home for more swimming and more jet-skiing-under-the-influence . 
But by 8 the summer house’s restaurant was full once more , the food and drink were flowing , the name performers were giving acoustic renditions of the songs they had sung at the reception , and some stupendously fat guests were displaying their lezginkas for the benefit of the two visiting [MISC Russian  ] women , who had wandered over from the reception . 
The Wedding -- Day 2: Enter The [MISC Man ------------------------------------  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The next day’s reception at the [LOC Marrakech  ] was [LOC Gadzhi’s  ] tribute to Aida’s family , after which we all returned to a dinner at [LOC Gadzhi’s  ] summer home . 
Most of the tables were set with the usual dishes plus whole roast sturgeons and sheep . 
But at 8:00 p.m. the compound was invaded by dozens of heavily armed mujahedin for the grand entrance of [MISC Chechen  ] leader [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] , dressed in jeans and a t-shirt , looking shorter and less muscular than in his photos , and with a somewhat cock-eyed expression on his face . 
After greetings from [PER Gadzhi  ] , [PER Ramzan  ] and about 20 of his retinue sat around the tables eating and listening to [LOC Benya  ] the Accordion King . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] then announced a fireworks display in honor of the birthday of Ramzan’s late father , [PER Ahmat-Hadji Kadyrov  ] . 
The fireworks started with a bang that made both [PER Gadzhi  ] and [PER Ramzan  ] flinch . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] had from the beginning requested that none of his guests , most of whom carried sidearms , fire their weapons in celebration . 
Throughout the wedding they complied , not even joining in the magnificent fireworks display. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) After the fireworks , the musicians struck up the lezginka in the courtyard and a group of two girls and three boys -- one no more than six years old -- performed gymnastic versions of the dance . 
First [PER Gadzhi  ] joined them and then [PER Ramzan  ] , who danced clumsily with his gold-plated automatic stuck down in the back of his jeans ( a houseguest later pointed out that the gold housing eliminated any practical use of the gun , but smirked that [PER Ramzan  ] probably couldn’t fire it anyway ) . 
Both [PER Gadzhi  ] and [PER Ramzan  ] showered the dancing children with hundred dollar bills ; the dancers probably picked upwards of USD 5000 off the cobblestones . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] told us later that [PER Ramzan  ] had brought the happy couple “a five kilo lump of gold” as his wedding present . 
After the dancing and a quick tour of the premises , [PER Ramzan  ] and his army drove off back to [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
We asked why [PER Ramzan  ] did not spend the night in [LOC Makhachkala  ] , and were told , “Ramzan never spends the night anywhere.” <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) After [PER Ramzan  ] sped off , the dinner and drinking -- especially the latter -- continued . 
An Avar FSB colonel sitting next to us , dead drunk , was highly insulted that we would not allow him to add “cognac” to our wine. “It’s practically the same thing , ” he insisted , until a [MISC Russian  ] FSB general sitting opposite told him to drop it . 
We were inclined to cut the Colonel some slack , though: he is head of the unit to combat terrorism in [LOC Dagestan  ] , and [PER Gadzhi  ] told us that extremists have sooner or later assassinated everyone who has joined that unit . 
We were more worried when an [MISC Afghan  ] war buddy of the [ORG Colonel’s  ] , [ORG Rector  ] of the [ORG Dagestan University Law School  ] and too drunk to sit , let alone stand , pulled out his automatic and asked if we needed any protection . 
At this point [PER Gadzhi  ] and his people came over , propped the rector between their shoulders , and let us get out of range . 
Postscript: The [ORG Practical Uses of a Caucasus  ] Wedding --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Kadyrov’s attendance was a mark of respect and alliance , the result of [LOC Gadzhi’s  ] careful cultivation -- dating back to personal friendship with Ramzan’s father . 
This is a necessary political tool in a region where difficulties can only be resolved by using personal relationships to reach ad hoc informal agreements . 
An example was readily to hand: on August 22 Chechnya’s parliamentary speaker , [PER Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov  ] , gave an interview in which he made specific territorial claims to the [LOC Kizlyar  ] , [LOC Khasavyurt  ] and [LOC Novolak  ] regions of [LOC Dagestan  ] . 
The first two have significant [MISC Chechen-Akkin  ] populations , and the last was part of [LOC Chechnya  ] until the 1944 deportation , when [LOC Stalin  ] forcibly resettled ethnic Laks ( a [MISC Dagestani  ] nationality ) there . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] said he would have to answer [PER Abdurakhmanov  ] and work closely with [PER Ramzan  ] to reduce the tensions “that fool” had caused . 
Asked why he took such statements seriously , he told us that in the [MISC Caucasus  ] all disputes revolve around land , and such claims can never be [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00009533 005 OF 005 dismissed . 
Unresolved land claims are the “threads” the [MISC Russian  ] center always kept in play to pull when needed . 
We asked why these claims are coming out now , and were told it was euphoria , pure and simple . 
After all they had received , the [MISC Chechen  ] leadership’s feet are miles off the ground . 
( A well-connected [MISC Chechen  ] contact later told us he thought that raising nationalistic irredentism was part of Abdurakhmanov’s effort to gain a political base independent from [PER Kadyrov  ] . 
) <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The “horizontal of power” represented by [MISC Gadzhi’s  ] relationship with [PER Ramzan  ] is the antithesis of the [MISC Moscow-imposed  ] “vertical of power.” [LOC Gadzhi’s  ] business partner [PER Khalik Gindiyev  ] , head of [LOC Rosneft-Kaspoil  ] , complained that [LOC Moscow  ] should let local [MISC Caucasians  ] rather than [MISC Russians  ] -- “Magomadovs and Aliyevs , not [PER Ivanovs  ] and [PER Petrovs”  ] -- resolve the region’s conflicts . 
The vertical of power , he said , is inapplicable to the [LOC Caucasus  ] , a region that [LOC Moscow  ] bureaucrats such as [PER PolPred Kozak  ] would never understand . 
The [MISC Caucasus  ] needs to be given the scope to resolve its own problems . 
But this was not a plug for democracy . 
[PER Gadzhi  ] told us democracy would always fail in the [LOC Caucasus  ] , where the conception of the state is as an extension of the [MISC Caucasus  ] family , in which the father’s word is law. “Where is the room for democracy in that ? ” he asked . 
We paraphrased [PER Hayek:  ] if you run a family as you do a state , you destroy the family . 
Running a state as you do a family destroys the state: ties of kinship and friendship will always trump the rule of law . 
[MISC Gadzhi’s  ] partner agreed , shaking his head sadly. “That’s a matter for generations to come , ” he said .
