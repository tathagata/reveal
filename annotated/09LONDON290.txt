End summary . 
[ORG HMG  ] Welcomes the Executive Orders --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Drawing from ref A , PolCouns met with [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] and senior members of his department on January 29 to discuss [LOC UK  ] reaction to the [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] executive orders and [LOC UK  ] views on resettlement of [LOC Guantanamo detainees  ] . 
[ORG HMG  ] was very pleased with the orders , [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] stressed , and [ORG HMG  ] lawyers are closely reviewing them and their implications for future detainee policy . 
He acknowledged that there had not been an official [ORG HMG  ] statement welcoming the orders , but put that down to the travel schedule of the appropriate ministers . 
[ORG Foreign Office  ] press lines , used in response to press queries , had praised the orders as “a welcome new chapter” and this was “certainly the view across HMG.” [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] speculated that the orders would be raised the next time the Foreign Secretary addressed the [MISC Commons  ] and at the time the Foreign Secretary would make clear the [MISC UK’s  ] positive reaction . 
Still Difficult Legal Issues Ahead for Both Governments --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] cautioned , however , that there were still serious legal issues ahead for [ORG HMG  ] and [ORG USG  ] regarding detainee policy . 
He noted that twelve of the detainees who have returned to the [LOC UK  ] have brought a combined action in the [LOC UK  ] courts charging named [ORG HMG  ] officials with “malfeasance in the use of their public office” because of their involvement in the detainees’ incarceration at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] . 
[PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] said that the [ORG Home Office  ] , not the [ORG Foreign Office  ] , had the lead on this case , but it was likely to raise similar issues concerning access to classified information as had been raised in the [PER Binyam Mohammed  ] case . 
He noted that the Executive Orders would provide “reassurance” to the Court hearing the [PER Binyam Mohammed  ] case , but that court and others would be looking to the results of the inter-agency panels before concluding that legal and human rights issues raised by the defendants were now moot . 
Inter-Agency Panels May Want to Consult with [ORG HMG  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Polcouns used ref A guidance to respond to questions concerning whether the [ORG USG  ] was considering resettling detainees in the [LOC United States  ] and the legal authorities under which detainees were now being held . 
[PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] , although noting that he understood the focus of the inter-agency groups established under the Executive Orders was on [LOC U.S.  ] policy and legal authority , suggested that the policy group examining broad [LOC U.S.  ] policy on detainee issues still might find it useful to consult with other governments on an international legal regime to govern terrorist combatants . 
[ORG HMG  ] Will Not Take Any More Detainees ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Reconfirming a message Prime Minister Brown’ Foreign Policy Advisor had conveyed to Ambassador [PER Tuttle  ] and [ORG DCM  ] a few days before ( ref B ) , [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] told PolCouns that [ORG HMG  ] was not willing to take any additional detainees for resettlement in the [LOC UK  ] , beyond the two detainees with [LOC UK  ] connections that are currently the subject of bilateral discussions -- [PER Binyam Mohammed  ] and [PER Shaker Amer  ] . 
[ORG HMG  ] had already resettled over a dozen detainees and the [MISC UK’s  ] available security resources to monitor any additional detainees were already stretched to the limit , he explained . 
The decision to accept more detainees had been taken at the [LOC LONDON  ] 00000290 002 OF 002 “ministerial level , ” he added , and after cabinet discussion , so it was not one that [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] believed was subject to revision. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) The question of other [ORG EU  ] Member governments accepting detainees was , ultimately , for individual governments to decide in consultation with the [ORG USG  ] , [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] said . 
He said that [ORG HMG  ] was not opposed to the [ORG EU  ] discussing what steps it could take to assist individual governments that decide to accept detainees . 
He understood the next step following the discussion on detainees at the January 26-27 [ORG EU  ] GAERC meeting was for [ORG EU  ] Ambassadors in [LOC Brussels  ] to meet and propose possible steps that could be taken to assist Members which choose to accept detainees , as well as proposals to address the legal issues that were raised concerning the detainees’ possible freedom of movement across [ORG EU  ] borders . 
[ORG HMG  ] Will Share Its Experiences with Other Governments --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [ORG HMG  ] has offered to provide other [MISC European  ] governments considering resettlement of detainees advice on the [MISC UK’s  ] experiences , both legal and security , in resettling detainees . 
[PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] did not know of any government that had yet taken up the [MISC British  ] offer , in part he speculated , because to do so would “show a government’s cards” about its willingness to take detainees . 
He thought that most governments were still at a point at which they did not want to reveal to other [ORG EU  ] capitals their willingness to resettle detainees , waiting to find out if others would step forward first. “I would expect [LOC Washington  ] will learn first which countries are willing , before we do.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chatterton-Dixon  ] stressed that [ORG HMG  ] appreciates the [ORG USG  ] keeping it informed of future developments related to the Executive Orders and the work of the inter-agency panels .
