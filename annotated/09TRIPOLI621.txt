REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary: On July 23  ] , [LOC Libya  ] 's elusive top nuclear official , Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , met with Pol/Econ Chief and Econoff to discuss [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] scientist redirection programs . 
While he was cordial and welcoming , [PER Gashut  ] did not take responsibility for any of the delays in progress on joint projects , such as the [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] and the installation of water desalination equipment for the pilot project at [LOC Tajura  ] . 
As for the signing of an agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] to repatriate spent nuclear fuels ( Highly-Enriched Uranium ) , he said it would be ready " soon , " without providing any precise timeframe . 
He also blamed the lack of visa approvals for [ORG USG  ] visitors on the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] . 
Although [PER Gashut  ] said he viewed the [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] science program as a " model of cooperation , " he repeated the familiar refrain that [LOC Libya  ] has not sufficiently benefited from its abandonment of weapons of mass destruction . 
[PER Gashut  ] said the arrangement since 2004 for him to be the [MISC Libyan  ] focal point for joint activities had worked well and he looked forward to continuing this with new ISN staff . 
He also noted that an official response to Acting [PER DAS Mitman  ] 's letter would be forthcoming . 
End Summary . 
GASHUT: " I AM THE POINT OF CONTACT " FOR ALL [ORG U.S.-LIBYA NUCLEAR ISSUES  ] 2 . 
( S ) Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] met with Pol/Econ Chief and Econoff to review the status of [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] scientist redirection programs , at the Embassy 's request July 23 . 
The Embassy has not had a face-to-face meeting with [PER Gashut  ] since last January and two diplomatic notes requesting meetings with his staff at [ORG Tajura Nuclear Center  ] have gone unanswered . 
As reported in Ref A , [PER Gashut  ] is the Secretary of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Atomic Energy Establishment  ] . 
His deputy , Dr. [PER Mohamed Ennami  ] , was not available to join the meeting . 
[PER Gashut  ] said that since 2004 , there had been an " operating agreement " that he would be the focal point on the [MISC Libyan  ] side for joint activities , while the manager for [MISC Libya-related  ] programs in the [ORG Bureau for International Security and Nonproliferation  ] ( [ORG ISN  ] ) would play the same role on the [LOC U.S.  ] side . 
He said this had worked well , and he looked forward to continuing this arrangement with new ISN staff . 
To that end , he noted that he had prepared an official response to Acting [PER DAS Mitman  ] 's letter , which he believed would be forwarded to the embassy within a week . 
[ Note: Post received [PER Gashut  ] 's response - dated July 12 - on July 24 ; we have forwarded the text via email to NEA/MAG . 
] 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Gashut  ] outlined his team 's composition , noting that he is in charge of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Atomic Energy Establishment  ] ( [ORG LAEE  ] ) . 
[PER Gashut  ] confirmed [PER Mohamed Ennami  ] is his deputy ; [PER Ahmed al-Habrush  ] is in charge of [ORG Tajura Nuclear Center  ] ; Dr. [PER Musa Mohammed  ] is in charge of [ORG Renewable Energy  ] ( mainly Solar ) , replacing Dr. [PER Salem Ghurbal  ] ; and Dr. [PER Husein Mansour  ] is in charge of a small training center for [ORG Chemical Technologies  ] ( bio details provided in response to Ref B ) . 
STATUS OF [MISC HEU/LEU GOVERNMENT-T0-GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT 4  ] . 
( C ) [PER Gashut  ] said he expected the government-to-government agreement for the repatriation of the [MISC HEU/LEU  ] material from [LOC Tajura  ] to [LOC Russia  ] to be signed in the near future , without providing any specifics . 
The Pol/Econ Chief thanked him for his help in securing multiple-entry visas for two [ORG Department of Energy  ] officials to travel to [LOC Libya  ] in conjunction with the repatriation program . 
She told him Acting Assistant Secretary for [MISC Near Eastern  ] Affairs [PER Jeffrey Feltman  ] would be visiting [LOC Tripoli  ] the week of July 26 and he would raise the need for a signed agreement during his meetings ( Ref D ) . 
[ORG REGIONAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE CENTER  ] 5 . 
( S ) [PER Gashut  ] highlighted the proposed [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] ( [ORG RNMC  ] ) as a good symbol of [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] cooperation - one which would demonstrate to the [MISC Libyan  ] people that they have benefited from [LOC Libya  ] 's renunciation of its [ORG Weapons of Mass Destruction  ] program . 
In [PER Gashut  ] 's view , the [ORG Center  ] would provide badly-needed healthcare services . 
He said he and his colleagues were waiting for " good news " from the [LOC U.S.  ] side on whether the project could move forward , adding that land near the [ORG Tripoli Airport  ] had been identified for the [ORG Center  ] . 
He noted that Dr. [PER Omran Shammam  ] , Director of the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] , had a " few remarks " regarding the strategic plans for the project , but [PER Gashut  ] believed these could be resolved through discussions between the two sides . 
He said he was waiting to hear whether the [LOC U.S.  ] side had a budget in place for the [ORG Center  ] . 
The Pol/Econ Chief told him the [LOC U.S.  ] side was in fact , waiting for approval from the [MISC Libyans  ] to move forward , prior to requesting funds from [ORG Congress  ] for the completion of the project . 
[ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000621 002.2 OF 002 6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ Note: In November 2008 , a draft strategy was passed to the [MISC Libyan  ] government for approval to start the architectural design for the [ORG RNMC  ] . 
In a meeting last May , Dr. [PER Shammam  ] told EconOff that the draft strategy passed a technical review ; he believed it was then sent to the [ORG MFA  ] for approvals . 
[PER Gashut  ] told [ORG Emboffs  ] the proposal had not been properly vetted by the General People 's [ORG Committee for Health ( Ministry of Health-equivalent  ] ) . 
However , in a June meeting between the Ambassador and the Secretary of the [ORG GPC for Health  ] , neither the Secretary nor his colleagues had ever heard of the [ORG Center  ] proposal ( Ref C ) . 
In his April meetings in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , [PER Gashut  ] said that the time-line contained within the [ORG RNMC  ] proposal was too long and needed to be sped up . 
To date , however , the Embassy has not received an official response to the submitted proposal . 
End note . 
] [ORG SISTER LAB  ] 7 . 
( C ) [ORG Emboffs  ] conveyed disappointment that visas were not approved for the June [ORG Sister Laboratory  ] visit . 
[PER Gashut  ] insisted that visa approvals remained within the purview of the [ORG MFA  ] . 
WATER DESALINATION PILOT PROJECT 8 . 
( S ) [PER Gashut  ] informed [ORG Emboffs  ] that the water desalination project was stalled because his team could not access the necessary equipment to proceed . 
He said that some of the equipment for the desalination project and analytic laboratory had arrived but that other equipment had not yet cleared customs because the [MISC Libyan  ] shipping agent had not received the original bill of lading from the [MISC U.S.-based  ] shipping company . 
Econoff assured [PER Gashut  ] that a new " original " bill of lading was being sent to [LOC Tripoli  ] via the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy . 
[PER Gashut  ] said once the equipment was in place , the [ORG Department of Energy  ] officials ( [PER Malynda Cappelle  ] and [PER Randy Everett  ] ) could visit to verify all equipment had arrived and to provide training to the desalination project staff . 
[ORG Emboffs  ] reviewed an [MISC ISN-supplied  ] list of program areas that required completion by [PER Gashut  ] 's team , including the need to ensure the accuracy of the wiring for the housing of the desalination project . 
In response , [PER Gashut  ] said he had forwarded relevant emails to the desalination project staff . 
He asked us to send him an email with other outstanding items , such as whether a radioactive waste tracking database was completed and pledged to review the points with relevant [LOC Tajura  ] staff . 
[ORG RENEWABLE ENERGY ACTIVITIES  ] 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Earlier this month , two officials ( [PER Musa Mohamed  ] and [PER Khairy Agha  ] ) of the [ORG Renewable Energy Research Center  ] received funding from the [ORG ISN Bureau  ] to attend a conference on alternative energy in [LOC California  ] . 
[PER Gashut  ] said the trip was useful and he seemed pleased the two were able to participate . 
He noted Dr. [PER Musa Mohamed  ] was now the director of the [ORG Renewable Energy Research Center  ] ( replacing Dr. [PER Salem Ghurbal  ] ) who , it has been rumored , is ill and suffers from diabetes . 
[ Note: as [ORG Emboffs  ] were leaving [PER Gashut  ] 's office , they passed [PER Ghurbal  ] , who said hello but did not elaborate on his current employment status ; he did not appear terribly ill . 
End note . 
] 10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Gashut  ] noted that an Alternative [ORG Energy/Desalination Study Tour  ] had been proposed two years ago , in talks between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
He said a delegation had been all set to go the [LOC U.S.  ] but blamed the trip 's cancellation on what he described as the lengthy [LOC U.S.  ] visa approval process . 
[ Note: Other reasons given to [ORG Emboffs  ] in the past include the inability of delegation members to travel to [LOC Tunis  ] for visa interviews , which no longer pose a problem since [LOC U.S.  ] nonimmigrant visas are now being processed in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
End note . 
] [PER Gashut  ] noted that the project had now shifted to the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Water Authority  ] , headed by [PER Omar Salem  ] . 
He suggested the Embassy follow-up with [PER Salem  ] on the status of the delegation . 
11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: While it was helpful to have this rare , face-to-face meeting with [PER Gashut  ] , many unanswered questions remain , such as the status of the [ORG HEU  ] repatriation agreement , and whether future [ORG USG  ] visitors will be able to receive visas to come to [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Gashut  ] was cordial and polite but not particularly effusive . 
He refused to commit to regular meetings , such as on a monthly basis , with [ORG Emboffs  ] , yet insisted on directing all [ORG USG  ] communication with [LOC Tajura  ] officials . 
One can only surmise that our scientific engagement , like all of our other engagement , is being dictated from the highest levels of the [PER Qadhafi  ] regime . 
As such , [PER Gashut  ] 's ability to influence policy , including visas for [LOC U.S.  ] officials , is limited .
