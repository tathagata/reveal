BERLIN  ] 176 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 128 Classified By: ROBERT [PER A. POLLARD  ] , Minister-Counselor for [MISC Economics Affa  ] irs , for Reasons 1.4 ( b and d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] is privately angry over the lack of support [MISC German  ] members of the [ORG European Parliament  ] gave the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program ( [ORG TFTP  ] ) interim agreement and is worried that [LOC Washington  ] will view the [ORG EP  ] 's veto as a sign that [LOC Europe  ] does not take the terrorist threat seriously . 
[PER Merkel  ] is particularly irritated with [MISC German  ] MEPs from her [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) and sister [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) parties , most of whom reportedly voted against the agreement despite previously indicating they would support it . 
Public [MISC German  ] reactions to the [ORG EP  ] vote have come exclusively from [ORG TFTP  ] detractors who portrayed the veto as a sign that the [ORG European Parliament  ] has won a victory over an arrogant Commission/Council , as well as delivering a rebuke to [LOC U.S.  ] counterterrorism policies that undervalue data privacy . 
These events suggest the need to intensify our engagement with [MISC German  ] government interlocutors , [ORG Bundestag  ] and [MISC European  ] parliamentarians , and opinion makers to demonstrate that the [LOC U.S.  ] has strong data privacy measures in place . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Hamburg Mayor Ole von [PER Beust  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) told Ambassador today ( 2/12 ) that he had met with Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] last night and she was " very , very angry - angrier than he had ever seen her " with the outcome of the vote . 
[PER Beust  ] said that the Chancellor had personally lobbied [MISC German  ] MEPs from the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] parties to support the agreement , but that most of these MEPs ended up voting against the agreement anyway . 
[PER Merkel  ] expressed concerns to [PER Beust  ] that [LOC Washington  ] will view the [ORG EP  ] veto as a sign that [LOC Europe  ] does not take the terrorist threat seriously . 
[PER Merkel  ] also worried about the ramifications ( presumably within [LOC Europe  ] and for transatlantic relations ) that might follow were a terrorist attack to occur that could have been prevented had SWIFT data been exchanged. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Federal Justice Minister [PER Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] , a strong proponent of data privacy rights from the [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ; see reftels ) , quickly welcomed the [ORG TFTP  ] veto . 
She said " the citizens of [LOC Europe  ] have won a victory today that strengthened not just data protection , but democracy in all of [LOC Europe  ] . 
" The Minister has been a vocal critic of the [ORG TFTP  ] and in interviews today stressed that the [ORG EP  ] veto will lead to a change of [MISC European  ] policy in which " data protection is no longer just an appendix of security policy . 
" She also restated her understanding that [MISC German  ] investigators believe [ORG TFTP  ] data has not/not contributed meaningfully to terrorism investigations . 
She said the [ORG EP  ] decision paves the way for new negotiations that take into account [MISC European  ] notions of data protection. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Some [MISC German  ] members of the [ORG European Parliament  ] likewise applauded the [ORG TFTP  ] veto . 
[ORG Green Party  ] MEP [PER Jan Philipp Albrecht  ] stated that the vote would not cause a " transatlantic ice-age " because President [PER Obama  ] has more important concerns and would not " emphasize this defeat too much at home . 
" [PER Werner Langen  ] , head of the [ORG EP  ] [ORG CDU/CSU  ] group , said that his group did not vote against the [LOC United States  ] , but rather against the [ORG European Commission  ] and the Council who had " negotiated a bad agreement . 
" [PER Martin Schulz  ] , head of the [ORG Social Democratic faction  ] , said that the " negotiating position of the [ORG EU  ] is now better . 
" [ORG FDP  ] MEP [PER Alexander Graf Lambsdorff  ] acknowledged that the decision could be a temporary irritation in transatlantic relations , but believed that this would not last long and the time would soon come to " negotiate a reasonable agreement . 
" [MISC Bavarian  ] State Minister [PER Mueller  ] told [LOC Munich  ] CG that the [ORG CSU  ] is interested in moving forward with the negotiation of a new agreement that meets [LOC US  ] and [MISC European  ] needs. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Why did so many [MISC German  ] MEPs oppose [ORG TFTP  ] ? 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 00000180 002 OF 002 First , the debate was not just about [ORG TFTP  ] . 
[MISC Germans  ] across the political spectrum adamantly support data protection ) whether it has to do with Passenger Name Records , [ORG Google  ] , s supposed &monopoly8 on data searches , or individual credit ratings . 
Recent scandals in which major firms such as [ORG Deutsche Telekom  ] and [ORG Deutsche Bahn  ] illegally tapped phones or files of tens of thousands of employees and customers reinforced [MISC Germans  ] , concerns about the misuse of data technology . 
Historical memory also plays a part , as stories about how the [ORG Stasi  ] abused information to destroy people , s lives still regularly circulate in the press . 
Paranoia runs deep especially about [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence agencies . 
We were astonished to learn how quickly rumors about alleged [LOC U.S.  ] economic espionage ) at first associated with the new [LOC U.S.  ] air passenger registration system ( [ORG ESTA  ] ) , then with [ORG TFTP  ] ) gained currency among [MISC German  ] parliamentarians in the run-up to the February 11 vote in [LOC Strasbourg  ] . 
Moreover , the fact that the libertarian [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) made data privacy a central plank of the pact with its coalition partners , the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] ) and more importantly , captured the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] ) made it very difficult for [ORG TFTP  ] advocates like Interior Minister [PER de Maiziere  ] to speak up . 
None of this may excuse the behavior of certain [MISC German  ] MEPs , but it says something about the challenge ahead. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT CONT.: The overwhelming rejection of the interim agreement by [MISC German  ] MEPs from all political parties nonetheless is surprising . 
Although we anticipated that the [ORG FDP  ] and [ORG Greens  ] would come out strongly against the interim agreement , the broad lack of support it received from the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] and [MISC Social Democrats  ] was unexpected . 
We believe a number of factors contributed to this including the fact that MEPs of all stripes saw this as an early opportunity to exert their new post-Lisbon powers and send a message to the [ORG Commission  ] and Council . 
Specific to [LOC Germany  ] , the almost complete absence of public statements by [MISC German  ] leadership in support of the agreement resulted in a situation in which MEPs received no political coverage supporting a positive vote and saw little political cost for a no vote . 
Furthermore , the [MISC German  ] public and political class largely tends to view terrorism abstractly given that it has been decades since any successful terrorist attack has occurred on [MISC German  ] soil . 
This week 's [ORG TFTP  ] vote demonstrates that we need to intensify our engagement with [MISC German  ] government interlocutors , [ORG Bundestag  ] and [MISC European  ] parliamentarians and opinion makers to get our views across . 
We need to also demonstrate that the [LOC U.S.  ] has strong data privacy measures in place so that robust data sharing comes with robust data protections .
