Public and private readouts suggest [LOC Iran  ] is particularly focused on joint investment activity and cooperation between the two sides' central banks , a potentially worrying development .

( U ) [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG First Vice-President  ] , [PER Pervez Davoudi  ] , headed a high-level [MISC Iranian  ] delegation that visited [LOC Tripoli  ] December 26-27 under the auspices of the twelth session of the joint [ORG Libya-Iran Economic Commission  ] .

PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM ; [LOC U.S.  ] SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM [LOC IRAQ  ] 3 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's state-controlled media focused on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program - emphasizing its right to pursue peaceful uses of atomic energy - and economic cooperation . 
In his public remarks , Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi stressed [LOC Libya  ] 's support for [LOC Iran  ] 's " legal and principled stands on its peaceful nuclear activities " . 
Al-Mahmoudi noted publicly that [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Iran  ] share the view that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" occupation " of [LOC Iraq  ] has destabilized the region . 
Echoing [PER Davoudi  ] 's remarks , he expressed support for [LOC Iraq  ] 's territorial integrity and its people and called for the prompt withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] forces , a subject he said featured prominently in the two sides' private discussions .

4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Citing a readout from [MISC Iranian  ] DCM [PER Mohammed Hossein Mirzaee  ] , [MISC Egyptian  ] Charge d'Affaires [PER Ahmed Abdel-Halim  ] told A/DCM January 6 that [PER Davoudi  ] 's visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] was a follow-on to [MISC Libyan  ] PM al-Mahmoudi 's stop in [LOC Tehran  ] in May 2007 . 
[PER Mirzaee  ] confirmed that [PER Davoudi  ] met with Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , clarifying conflicting press accounts as to whether such had occurred . 
According to [PER Mirzaee  ] , al-Qadhafi and [PER Davoudi  ] discussed further possible sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] in light of [LOC Libya  ] 's current UNSC Presidency . 
Al-Qadhafi reportedly assured [PER Davoudi  ] that [LOC Libya  ] opposes a third sanctions resolution on [LOC Iran  ] . 
According to [PER Mirzaee  ] , [PER Shalgham  ] took the same position in his discussions with [PER Davoudi  ] . 
( [PER Note: Contradicting  ] what we understand [PER Shalgham  ] told [PER U/S Burns  ] in [LOC Washington  ] January 3 , and agreeing with what we understand he told [LOC U.K.  ] Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] in [LOC London  ] January 7 ( reftel ) .

) 5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Mirzaee  ] stressed to his [MISC Egyptian  ] interlocutor that neither al-Qadhafi nor [PER Shalgham  ] had offered to play a role in mediating between [LOC Iran  ] and the [ORG USG  ] and international community on the nuclear file . 
( [PER Note: Again  ] , contradicting what we understand [PER Shalgham  ] told [PER U/S Burns  ] on January 3 . 
End note . 
) According to [PER Mirzaee  ] , [LOC Libya  ] 's experience is not analogous to [LOC Iran  ] 's because [LOC Libya  ] had WMD aspirations , while [LOC Iran  ] maintains that it only seeks civilian applications of nuclear technology. .. . 
AND ON [LOC IRAQ  ] , [MISC ISRAEL-PALESTINE  ] & IMAM MUSA SADR CASE 6 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly spent considerable time denouncing the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" occupation " of [LOC Iraq  ] and continuing [MISC Israeli  ] " aggression " against [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
He apparently treated [PER Davoudi  ] to a lengthy discourse on his " [MISC Isratine  ] " proposal for a one-state [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000012 002.2 OF 002 solution to the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict . 
Echoing [PER Shalgham  ] 's public remarks , [PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly assured [PER Davoudi  ] that the GOL shares [LOC Iran  ] 's views on [LOC Iraq  ] , [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly raised with [PER Davoudi  ] the case of [MISC Lebanese  ] Shi'a cleric Imam [PER Musa Sadr  ] , who disappeared during a visit to [LOC Libya  ] in August 1978 . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly complained that [MISC Lebanese  ] officials had recently raised the case again and asked for [LOC Iran  ] 's assistance in smoothing over the issue . 
( [PER Note: Lebanese-Libyan  ] official relations have remain strained since [PER Sadr  ] 's disappearance . 
End note . 
) Noting that [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Libya  ] have a " separate channel " for dealing with the contentious issue of [PER Sadr  ] 's disappearance , [PER Mirzaee  ] stressed to [PER Abdel-Halim  ] that [LOC Iran  ] tries to limit the extent to which the matter bears on bilateral [MISC Iran-Libya  ] relations . 
[PER Mirzaee  ] complained that [LOC Lebanon  ] 's insistence on pursuing the matter has periodically led to [MISC Iranian-Lebanese  ] contretemps . 
10 AGREEMENTS SIGNED ; JOINT BANKING , INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS KEY 8 . 
( U ) During the visit , the two sides announced they would soon establish a joint political committee at the ministerial level and signed 10 agreements and memoranda of understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] 's ) covering investment , banking , higher education , maritime transport , fishing , tourism cultural exchanges and media cooperation . 
Two key [ORG MOU  ] 's provide a framework for cooperation between the central banks of [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Iran  ] and the establishment of a joint investment entity by [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Investment Promotion Office  ] and its [MISC Iranian  ] counterpart . 
[PER Shalgham  ] emphasized the expectation that the activities of the joint political committee would facilitate greater [MISC Iranian  ] participation in [LOC Libya  ] 's economic development , particularly in the areas of finance and infrastructure development . 
Claiming that expansion of ties with [MISC African  ] countries is a key [MISC Iranian  ] foreign policy priority , [PER Davoudi  ] nonetheless stressed that economic and other , unspecified , [MISC Libyan-Iranian  ] cooperation would also extend to [LOC Central Asia  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] . 
INVESTMENT , FINANCE KEY FROM IRAN'S PERSPECTIVE 9 . 
( C ) [PER Mirzaee  ] told [PER Abdel-Halim  ] that from [LOC Iran  ] 's perspective the most significant agreement was that which established a joint [MISC Libyan-Iranian  ] investment entity , to be capitalized with money via each country 's central bank , for investments in [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Central Asia  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] also viewed increased cooperation between the two sides' central banks as an important development , in part because [LOC Iran  ] 's access to international banking and finance has become increasingly difficult . 
10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: The apparent disconnect between [PER Shalgham  ] 's public and private comments in [LOC Tripoli  ] and what he said in [LOC Washington  ] is troubling , the more so since the readout from his meeting with [LOC U.K.  ] FS [PER Miliband  ] seems to corroborate reports here that the [ORG GOL  ] opposes further sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Iranian  ] officials' emphasis on joint investment projects and central bank cooperation is an interesting and potentially worrying development that Post will continue to track .
