Referendum Rumors and Government Stability -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) President [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] 's decision on January 5 to veto the [ORG Icesave  ] bill sparked wild speculation regarding [LOC Iceland  ] 's immediate future . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] constitution is clear in mandating that a national referendum occur shortly after the President refuses to sign a bill , but the law is vague on how to conduct such a referendum . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament , which is currently on holiday recess , is expected to reconvene on January 8 to discuss the matter . 
The first order of business for parliament will be to introduce legislation clarifying the subject and laying out the procedures for a referendum . 
There are currently two bills sitting before parliament that address the topic , however , the government intends to submit a completely new bill that will apply exclusively to the current situation . 
The national referendum , according to the media , may take place as early as Saturday , February 20. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The coalition government appears as though it will survive the political upheaval and chaos precipitated by the president 's refusal to sign the [ORG Icesave  ] law , at least until the national referendum takes place . 
Chairman of the parliamentary group for the [MISC Social Democrats  ] , [PER Bjorgvin G. Sigurdsson  ] , said on January 5 that " the government will continue in power and will start preparations to hold the national referendum " . 
Most commentators agree , however , that the coalition will likely collapse if voters strike down the [ORG Icesave  ] law in the referendum. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The situation in [LOC Iceland  ] could become even more politically charged as the referendum , should it take place in mid February , would occur shortly after the release of a " [ORG Truth Commission  ] " report . 
The report , which was commissioned by the government to investigate the causes of the bank collapse and to identify those responsible , is scheduled to be made public on February 1 . 
The combination of these two highly volatile issues , occurring within such close proximity to one another , ensures that political tensions will be running high in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[ORG Economic Recovery  ] in Doubt -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In the wake of the president 's decision , several [MISC Nordic  ] finance ministries came forward with statements suggesting that the [MISC Nordic  ] loan of USD 2.5 billon to [LOC Iceland  ] was now in jeopardy . 
Several of these ministries indicated that the [MISC Nordic  ] loan would not be forthcoming at least until after the national referendum was conducted . 
The Deputy Director General at the [ORG Finnish Ministry of Finance  ] , [PER Ilkka Kajaste  ] , said on February 6 that " the process will probably be delayed , as we will ask the [MISC British  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] what they think about the situation . 
In any case , this will require a new assessment . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) This decision by the [MISC Nordic  ] countries jeopardizes the [ORG IMF  ] recovery package for [LOC Iceland  ] which was , in large part , predicated on the [MISC Nordic  ] loan package . 
The [LOC Iceland  ] mission chief for the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] , [PER Mark Flanagan  ] , said that although an agreement on the [ORG Icesave  ] issue was not a precondition for the [ORG IMF  ] program , it was important that the [ORG IMF  ] program be fully funded and he intended to consult with the other countries providing financing to the program .
