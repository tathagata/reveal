<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L WELLINGTON 000647 SIPDIS NSC FOR MGREEN DEPARTMENT FOR EAP/ANP EO 12958 DECL: 07/30/2014 TAGS PREL , PGOV , [LOC NZ  ] SUBJECT: [LOC NEW ZEALAND  ] MINISTER HOSTS MIKE MOORE’S “FAHRENHEIT 9/11” FUNDRAISER ( ALMOST ) Classified By: DCM [PER David R. Burnett  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy [LOC Wellington  ] learned July 30 that GNZ Cabinet Minister for the Environment [PER Marian Hobbs  ] was reportedly hosting a special screening of [PER Michael Moore’s  ] controversial movie “Fahrenheit 9/11” as a local [ORG Labour Party  ] fundraising event . 
[ORG DCM  ] contacted the Prime Minister’s office to ask whether it could shed some light on the matter and was told by PM office staff that they were not aware of the issue but would look into it . 
DCM then contacted Minister Hobbs’ office but the Minister’s office declined to make her available to discuss the matter . 
Hobbs’ staff later informed Embassy that [PER Hobbs  ] would not be hosting the fundraiser . 
However , she would be attending the event. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) COMMENT: There’s a reason this particular Minister is nicknamed “Boo [PER Boo” Hobbs  ] . 
That said , it is probable that this potential fiasco may only have been averted because of our phone calls - it is apparent to us that neither the Minister nor anyone else in the [ORG Labour  ] government seems to have thought there was anything wrong with a senior Minister hosting such an event . 
Ambassador will use a scheduled meeting with the Prime Minister to tell [PER Clark  ] of the near instantaneous press queries for [MISC USG  ] comment in this matter and remind her that we would really rather not get dragged into internal [LOC NZ  ] political issues , such as Ministerial fundraising events for [ORG Clark’s Labour Party  ] .
