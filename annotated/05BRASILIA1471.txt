WHA/BSC - EMBASSY/POL TELCONS AND EMAILS D. STATE 54960 Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION PHILIP CHICOLA . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has rejected our proposal to grant A and T status to [LOC U.S.  ] servicemembers coming to [LOC Brazil  ] for the [LOC PKO South  ] and [MISC Patriot  ] Angel exercises . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials have indicated that a diplomatic note with language similar to that used in the past would be acceptable . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Per refs , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) has been considering terms proposed by [ORG USG  ] on 29 March for an exchange of notes establishing status of forces protections and immunities for [LOC U.S.  ] servicemembers coming to [LOC Brazil  ] for military exercises , with specific focus on establishing the terms through exchange of notes prior to the upcoming [ORG PKO South  ] and [MISC Patriot  ] Angel exercises . 
Per ref C , [PER PolCouns  ] subsequently stressed to [ORG MRE  ] action officers that granting of Technical and [MISC Adminstrative-level  ] protections/immunities under the [ORG Vienna Convention  ] would be the key issue for the [LOC U.S.  ] , and also provided [ORG MRE  ] a non-paper prepared by [ORG USG  ] interagency legal experts that delinked the [LOC SOFA  ] notes from [ORG Article  ] 98 issues and the [ORG ICC  ] . 
Mission MLO officers double-tracked progress on the issue with senior [ORG MOD  ] officials , who voiced strong support for securing an agreement that would facilitate the exercises , and indicated that a letter from [ORG Defense Minister/Vice  ] President [PER Alencar  ] to FM [ORG Amorim  ] would be sent in support of granting [MISC A/T  ] status to [LOC U.S.  ] forces in the exchange of notes. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On 27 May , [PER PolCouns  ] met with [ORG MRE  ] action officer [PER Marcos Pinta Gama  ] , who told [PER PolCouns  ] informally that [ORG MRE  ] attorneys and Secretary General [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] had forwarded to the [ORG MOD  ] a recommendation that [LOC Brazil  ] not/not grant A and T status to [LOC U.S.  ] servicemembers , and recommending that the [ORG GOB  ] seek agreement from the [ORG USG  ] to conduct the upcoming exercises under the terms of previous diplomatic note texts used in the past to cover joint exercises . 
[PER Pinto Gama  ] explained that , in the [ORG MRE  ] 's view , the protections/immunities explicitly provided under the [ORG Vienna Convention  ] for [MISC A/T  ] status personnel are of a fundamentally different and broader order than protection afforded [LOC U.S.  ] personnel in the past , and would raise a range of legal and even constitutional questions for the [ORG GOB  ] that would require time to resolve . 
[PER Pinta Gama  ] asked informally whether the [ORG USG  ] could use the terms of earlier notes to cover the immediate exercises while the governments worked toward a longer-term solution . 
[PER PolCouns  ] replied that the question would have to be referred to [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] and [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On 30 May MLO Chief was called to the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] by [ORG Admiral Miguel  ] [PER Angelo Davena  ] , Secretary for Political , Strategic and [LOC International Issues  ] , and provided a copy of a letter from [PER Davena  ] to General [PER Craddock  ] , Combatant Commander , [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] . 
In the letter [PER Davena  ] formally states the position relayed per ref 2 , i.e. , that the [ORG MRE  ] had indicated that military exercises in [LOC Brazil  ] involving [LOC U.S.  ] forces should proceed under the same terms for protections used in the past . 
[PER Davena  ] said that he considered it a " personal failure " that he had not been able to successfully persuade [ORG MRE  ] and [ORG MOD  ] senior authorities to grant [MISC A/T  ] status , and asked MLO chief to convey his hope that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] would still find a way to proceed with the exercises , which [PER Davena  ] said the [ORG MOD  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's service commanders consider to be crucial. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Unless we are prepared to provide the [ORG GOB  ] with a diplomatic note with essentially the same text as used in the pastm the exercises in question cannot proce</pre></code>
