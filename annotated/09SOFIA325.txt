08 [LOC SOFIA  ] 0499 Classified By: DCM [PER Alex Karagiannis  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( please strictly protect ) confided that the July report on [LOC Bulgaria  ] 's anti-crime and corruption efforts would be negative , but the [ORG EU  ] political level would " water down " the tone of the final version . 
The report 's release might be delayed until September because of the formation of a new [ORG Commission  ] . 
In contrast to previous conversations , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emotionally reflected [LOC Brussels  ] , growing and by now extreme frustration with [LOC Sofia  ] 's cosmetic fixes to get a " good report " while failing to undertake real reforms . 
He confirmed that the [MISC Dutch  ] want to invoke the safeguard clause when the report is released and that others , including the [MISC Swedes  ] who hold the next presidency , favor extending the Mechanism beyond its three-year mandate . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------------------------------------ [ORG Judicial Reform  ] -- [ORG Fatigue  ] and Frustration ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the monitors raised key issues with the GOB such as the appointment procedure for top judicial officials , vote buying , and progress in organized crime and high-level corruption cases . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] called the appointment/nomination procedure for the top judicial officials " non-transparent " because the vote on the nominees is secret and does not take into full account disciplinary actions against the nominees . 
Furthermore , the process lacks real debate among the [ORG Supreme Judicial Council  ] ( [ORG SJC  ] ) members on the nominees' qualifications and does not allow the members to release " opinions " on why they voted for or against a nominee . 
The non-transparent procedure permits the selection of corrupt and/or incompetent judges and prosecutors to the higher courts , perpetuating the cycle of incompetence and corruption in the [MISC Bulgarian  ] judiciary . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the entire team believes the [MISC Bulgarians  ] only address issues in the [ORG Commission  ] 's report to get a " good report , " not to create a better judicial system . 
For example , Prosecutor General [PER Boris Velchev  ] asked if his nomination of a certain person for a position in the prosecutor 's office would be recorded negatively in the upcoming [ORG Commission  ] report . 
They replied to [PER Velchev  ] that if he thinks the nomination would be reported negatively , then it is a " good sign that it probably would be . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that [PER Velchev  ] often asks how he is perceived in [LOC Brussels  ] when they discuss reforms in the prosecution service . 
Another example is that [ORG Sofia City Court  ] has two courtrooms specifically available for hearing [ORG EU  ] funds fraud cases , while available courtrooms for other cases are hard to come by. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Bulgarian  ] government -- especially [PER PG Velchev  ] and [MISC European  ] Minister [LOC Passy  ] -- are lobbying heavily for a positive monitoring report , magnifying modest progress . 
The government keeps presenting the [ORG Commission  ] a list of on-going high profile organized crime and corruption court cases ( the number has grown from 30 to 52 over the last two and a half years ) as " successes . 
" Incredibly , several of the " success " cases have been suspended . 
Several other cases , against notorious shady businessmen [PER Angel Khristov  ] and [PER Plamen Galev  ] [ORG AKA  ] the [ORG Galevi  ] brothers , and others can hardly be called [LOC SOFIA  ] 00000325 002 OF 002 successes as these defendants gained immunity by running for parliament . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the team found this " loophole " quite disturbing , along with how some [MISC Bulgarian  ] officials vehemently defend the law that permits this phenomenon . 
Along with the " [MISC Galevization  ] " of politics ( referring to the [ORG Galevi  ] brothers election campaign ) , [LOC Brussels  ] is also concerned with vote buying and general election fraud. ------------------------ Only Sticks Seem to Work ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the [ORG Commission  ] feels they have " tried everything " to make the [MISC Bulgarians  ] reform their judicial system , but concluded " how do you make them reform when they do not want to ? 
" The government 's defensive arrogance -- and lack of political will -- is intensifying enlargement fatigue in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
He underscored that [ORG EC  ] pressure via the monitoring reports and withholding [ORG EU  ] funds are the only ways to produce results . 
He confirmed media reports that [MISC Dutch  ] Minister of [ORG European Affairs  ] [PER Franz Timmermans  ] requested the [ORG Commission  ] to consider activating the safeguard clause against [LOC Bulgaria  ] and [LOC Romania  ] when the [ORG EC  ] releases both reports . 
( Activating the safeguard clause in Justice and [ORG Home Affairs  ] would mean that the [ORG European Union  ] would not recognize [LOC Bulgaria  ] 's legal decisions and exclude [LOC Bulgaria  ] from legal and police cooperation . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said currently only The [LOC Netherlands  ] is demanding the safeguard clause , but others are increasingly fed-up with [LOC Bulgaria  ] ( and [LOC Romania  ] 's ) lack of progress . 
There is talk within the [ORG Commission  ] about extending the Monitoring and Verification Mechanism beyond the three years stated in [LOC Bulgaria  ] 's and [LOC Romania  ] 's [ORG EU  ] Accession Acquis . 
[LOC Sweden  ] , which holds the next [ORG EU  ] presidency , favors extending the monitoring mechanism and is committed to pursue " rule of law issues " in both countries. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The report 's release date hinges on [ORG EU  ] internal political maneuvering for the formation and nomination of the new [ORG Commission  ] and the election of its next president -- a process that begins in July . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the team is preparing the report to be released the last week of July , but it may be published the second half of September if the new [ORG Commission  ] formation is drawn out . 
The team 's report will be critical , saying overall reform has stopped , but likely the final [ORG EC  ] report will be " watered down " as in the past for political reasons. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's frustration with the [MISC Bulgarian  ] government 's lame and insincere reform efforts was striking . 
It appears to be spreading in [LOC Brussels  ] where at least the working level appears to be feeling " buyers remorse " over letting [LOC Bulgaria  ] and [LOC Romania  ] into the club too early . 
According to reliable contacts , [LOC Brussels  ] [MISC Eurocrats  ] have dubbed enlargement fatigue the " [MISC Bulgarian  ] Break , " further tarnishing [LOC Bulgaria  ] 's bad image within the [ORG EU  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) . 
END COMMENT .
