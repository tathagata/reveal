Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a July 20 plenary session of the [ORG GSD  ] with a large [LOC UAE  ] delegation , accompanied by a smaller session with the [ORG UAE Chief of Staff  ] , the immediate focus was largely on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Participants reiterated the good defense cooperation that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UAE  ] enjoy , while noting the need to improve coordination further to deal with real and urgent threats in the region . 
In this regard , the [LOC UAE  ] put the threat of [LOC Iran  ] 's potential reaction to a " likely " [MISC Israeli  ] attack on its nuclear program at the center of scenarios to be considered . 
Other issues , to include [LOC Yemen  ] , counter-proliferation , [LOC Pakistan  ] , the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict , and extremism were also addressed , but even these were often seen through the prism of [MISC Iranian  ] intentions. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) This message begins with the Chief of [ORG Staff  ] 's urgent plea on " munitions " to deal with an unpredictable [LOC Iran  ] , followed by a synopsis of [ORG GSD  ] plenary proceedings . 
A list of [LOC UAE  ] participants is included at para 20 . 
End summary . 
Chief of [ORG Staff Presses for Munitions: Urgent  ] about [LOC Iran  ] 's unpredictability ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a brief session with principals only , Chief of [ORG Staff Hamad Thani  ] al-Romaithi ( who also participated in the [MISC MbZ  ] dinner and was on his way to [LOC Lebanon  ] later July 20 ) said the [LOC UAE  ] cannot act alone in the region and needs coherent plans -- especially to deal with the unique threat of [LOC Iran  ] . 
How to deter [LOC Iran  ] without provoking it is a challenge . 
Ambassador al-Otaiba emphasized how the proximity of the [LOC UAE  ] to [LOC Iran  ] magnifies the threat perception ; the CoS said [LOC UAE  ] military planning had to consider worst-case scenarios. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said the [ORG USG  ] did not disagree with the [LOC UAE  ] evaluation of [LOC Iran  ] 's objectives , but that we need to work to prevent them from achieving those objectives . 
Diplomacy is only one tool . 
The [ORG USG  ] wants to help provide the [LOC UAE  ] with defensive capabilities and our troop presence here should help act as a deterrent to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We don't want to signal that we will give up on diplomacy , yet in parallel to that effort we intend to keep the pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
We appreciate the candor of our defense engagement with the [LOC UAE  ] . 
We are dealing with an unpredictable foe and need to take all precautions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The CoS said [LOC Iran  ] will remain a threat in any case , as its objectives are constant . 
He added that if the [MISC Israelis  ] strike , [LOC Iran  ] may lash out at the [LOC UAE  ] and around the [LOC Gulf  ] -- one can conceive of many possible scenarios from missile strikes to attacks on isolated islands to the exploitation of 130,000 [MISC Iranians  ] living in the [LOC UAE  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] therefore seeks ongoing support from the region 's " main actor , " the [LOC U.S.  ] , and desires close defense coordination . 
The [LOC UAE  ] 's friends in the [ORG GCC  ] , on the other hand , are not always realistic in their approach to [LOC Iran  ] , he said , citing [MISC Arab  ] misinterpretation of " brotherly " [MISC Iraqi  ] intentions with regards to [LOC Kuwait  ] back in 1990. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said that our message to [LOC Iran  ] is that threats against our allies will not go unanswered . 
We need to be prepared in case deterrence does not work , with the realization that with or without nuclear weapons [LOC Iran  ] seeks to be a dominant power in the region . 
This is a very interconnected region , asserted the CoS . 
" If I was in the [MISC Israelis'  ] shoes , I would attack , to reduce the nuclear threat . 
" The first reaction may be that the [MISC Iranians  ] launch missiles against targets in [LOC Israel  ] and then the [LOC Gulf  ] , he added . 
Air Chief [PER Sweidan  ] added that the [LOC UAE  ] needs munitions on a tighter timeline than previously assumed -- with urgent needs in 2010 , 11 , and 12 . 
He said the [ORG UAE Armed Forces  ] could receive munitions from the [LOC U.S.  ] inventory and then replenish them later ( he supplied the same list of requirements as was relayed some months ago , noting that they had only received a " political " answer to that inquiry thus far ) . 
ABU DHABI 00000744 002 OF 004 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The CoS was appreciative of Patriot deployments , progress on command and control systems , and movement toward more effective shared early warning , but lamented that other pieces of the air defense puzzle require immediate attention . 
Ambassador al-Otaiba reiterated the need to " borrow from [LOC U.S.  ] inventories " to meet urgent timelines . 
[PER A/S Vershbow  ] said we were leaning far forward for the [LOC UAE  ] on [LOC THAAD  ] , for example , and would continue to look into opportunities to assist , including filling gaps before [MISC UAE-purchased  ] systems were delivered. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Highlighting the importance of close defense coordination , the CoS noted that in the event of an attack the [LOC UAE  ] may have no time to react . 
Taking the fight to [LOC Iran  ] may require " passing over [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft carriers , " for example , so we need to be in lock-step at all phases of preparation and operation . 
Introductory remarks -------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Plenary session of the [ORG U.S.-UAE Gulf Security Dialogue  ] ( [ORG GSD  ] ) convened July 20 at the [ORG Armed Forces Officers' Club  ] , with newly promoted Deputy Chief of [ORG Staff Major General Ali Hamad Subaih  ] al-Kaabi stating that the " small but significant " [LOC Gulf  ] region makes a large contribution to global peace and development and seeks enhanced cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] He cited [LOC UAE  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] use of [LOC UAE  ] bases , a robust intelligence exchange , strong counter-terror efforts , and improved border control as evidence that the [LOC UAE  ] shares common goals with the [LOC U.S.  ] Citing the " high importance " of strong relations among [ORG GCC  ] members , he thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for its role in the defense relationship and wanted to learn more about [LOC U.S.  ] strategies vis-a-vis [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and [LOC Palestine.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary of [ORG Defense Vershbow  ] , leading the [LOC U.S.  ] team along with Assistant State of State for Political-Military AffairsShapiro , expressed confidence in the strength and future of the bilateral relationship , anchored by common strategic interests . 
Recounting shared priorities , he noted that the [ORG GSD  ] was being taken to a new level as we seek strategic synergy in facing real threats like [LOC Iran  ] -- which we are obligated to defend against . 
He called for a more multi-lateral approach to counter-proliferation and cited the need to prepare missile defenses . 
He lauded the [LOC UAE  ] decision to host LEADING EDGE 2009 and cited the 123 agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] as the high standard on civil nuclear cooperation . 
The responsible drawdown of [LOC U.S.  ] troops in [LOC Iraq  ] also calls for continued [LOC UAE  ] support , he emphasized , as [LOC Iraq  ] seeks to assume responsibility for its own security and integrate into the region . 
The [LOC UAE  ] 's advanced fighter squadron , growing air defense net , participation in RED FLAG , and leadership of [ORG CTF  ] 152 are all indications of a maturing defense capability. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] emphasized the [ORG USG  ] desire to ensure regional stability , counter extremism , curb WMD proliferation , and tackle the inter-related challenges of the region holistically . 
He focused on the threat from [LOC Iran  ] , stressing that the [ORG USG  ] was attempting a diplomatic solution -- if possible -- and would proceed in consultation with our friends in the region . 
Recounting the basic components of our [LOC Iraq  ] policy , he also highlighted the need to strengthen the institutions of government in [LOC Lebanon  ] and build capacity within the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] . 
[LOC UAE  ] offers threat analysis: all [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] 's presentation of the primary regional threat assessed that [LOC Iran  ] 's leadership " genuinely believes that it has emerged victorious from its clash with the [LOC U.S.  ] , " with gains made in [LOC Iraq  ] , an expanding " [LOC Shi'a  ] tide " in the region , an ongoing nuclear program , missile modernization , and continued provocation of resistance in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
While [LOC Israel  ] was able to neutralize to some degree threats on its flanks in [LOC Lebanon  ] ( 2006 ) and [LOC Gaza  ] ( 2008/9 ) , ABU DHABI 00000744 003 OF 004 [LOC Iran  ] 's main goals of regional influence were not inhibited . 
The [LOC UAE  ] assessment continued that [LOC Israel  ] may act on its perception that only " extreme " ( and unlikely ) [ORG UNSC  ] action or unilateral [MISC Israeli  ] military action can slow [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear goals . 
As [LOC Iran  ] continues to reject a political solution , the [LOC UAE  ] must prepare for the fallout should [LOC Israel  ] act on its fears . 
With that , the briefer introduced a slide on [LOC Iran  ] 's capabilities , with missile sites in the south of [LOC Iran  ] and concentric circles showing their likely range all covering [LOC UAE  ] territory. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [MISC Iranian  ] promotion of " [MISC Shi'ism  ] , " coupled with sleeper cells in the region , magnify the threat articulated by the [LOC UAE  ] . 
If attacked , it may seek to obstruct shipping in the [LOC Gulf  ] and control ( more ) islands over which it does not have legitimate sovereignty . 
Working in alliance with al-Qaeda , [ORG Hezbollah  ] , and [MISC Iraqi Shi'a  ] , [LOC Iran  ] is poised to do damage of an unpredictable nature if/when provoked . 
In sum , [LOC Iran  ] continued as the traditional focus of the threat briefing offered by the [LOC UAE  ] at [ORG GSD  ] sessions . 
Other regional concerns noted in lesser detail included [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , the [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] conflict , terrorism , and piracy . 
[ORG Strategic Cooperation  ] --------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) In further briefings , the [LOC UAE  ] team highlighted good operational cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] and offered a review of the maturing [ORG Critical National Infrastructure Agency  ] ( [ORG CNIA  ] ) which is taking charge of security on land , along the coast , and off shore -- with an initial focus on [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] but an intent to serve as a federal agency . 
The [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] and [ORG NYPD  ] were cited as partners in the growing [ORG CNIA  ] mission , with a [LOC U.S.  ] promise of first-time " [ORG Nuclear Security Training  ] " in the near future. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] delegation received a draft " [ORG UAE National Defense Strategy  ] and [ORG U.S.-UAE Comprehensive Defense Strategy  ] " document outlining key priorities in the defense relationship ( a document proposed by [LOC UAE  ] Ambassador to [LOC Washington Yousef  ] al-Otaiba ) . 
Without immediate comment on the substance of the [ORG USG  ] draft , al-Kaabi said the [LOC UAE  ] would reply via embassy channels and looked forward to continuing the dialogue . 
Q&A on [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] ------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) When the floor was open to general discussion , two topics dominated: [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] asked whether the [ORG USG  ] had any new information since the December 2007 NIE regarding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weaponization program ; the [LOC U.S.  ] team noted that a new estimate was in progress but it was premature to comment . 
The [ORG DMI  ] representative also noted that [LOC Iran  ] exploits crises for its own advantage , making the defusing of crises like [LOC Palestine  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] imperative if we are to keep [LOC Iran  ] in check . 
In the case of [LOC Palestine  ] , he added optimistically , it is time to " cut to the chase " and deal with final status issues ; [LOC Lebanon  ] is also ripe for progress , he suggested , without a drawn out process. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) On [LOC Yemen  ] , the [LOC UAE  ] said it shared a [LOC U.S.  ] concern that a " failed state " could emerge on the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] , with terrorist partners and [MISC Iranian  ] influence further poisoning the mix . 
A collapsed [LOC Yemen  ] " gives us [LOC Afghanistan  ] , " said Commander of the [ORG Air Force  ] and [ORG Air Defense Major General Hamad  ] bin [ORG Suweidan  ] al-Qamzi , and then it presents a long-term threat to the region . 
He said the [LOC UAE  ] was coordinating economic development support for [LOC Yemen  ] while also trying to assist with political reconciliation . 
He noted the dangers of " another [LOC Somalia  ] . 
" ASD Vershbow hoped the [LOC UAE  ] could help secure a unified [ORG GCC  ] approach to [LOC Yemen  ] , as time is running out on the seccession question and [LOC Yemen  ] cannot afford a " two front " war with both seccesionists and the [MISC Al-Houthi  ] insurgency . 
In a brief discussion of [LOC Pakistan  ] , all agreed that [LOC Islamabad  ] needs to focus resources to fight insurgency rather than obsessing with [LOC India  ] as its potential military foe . 
ABU DHABI 00000744 004 OF 004 Positive Conclusions -------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Enhanced U.S.-UAE cooperation to counter troublesome financial flows and cash smuggling -- solidified during a recent visit by [ORG Treasury Secretary Geithner  ] -- was noted by the Charge as another area of productive engagement . 
Both sides also put in very positive words about the role of the [ORG Air Warfare Center  ] which has become a proud center of excellence for the region. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In closing , al-Kaabi raised [LOC Iran  ] yet again , noting that its leadership is not likely to change fundamentally and therefore the threat is likely to continue . 
He looked forward to ongoing discussion of the defense strategy discussed earlier as we continue to pursue a common vision. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 .
