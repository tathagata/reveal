( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Summary: Polls  ] continue to show [LOC Iceland  ] 's leftist minority government with a strong lead one week ahead of national elections on April 25 . 
Though the official campaign may be less than a full week due to an opposition filibuster that has kept parliament in session , the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] and [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] are increasingly acting like they will get a renewed mandate . 
Adding to [ORG Independence Party  ] woes is the fallout from news of extremely large ( by local standards ) political donations in 2006 on the eve of new campaign finance limits . 
The damage is forcing the [MISC IP  ] to consolidate support from its base , rather than make an attempt to pose a credible challenge to what would be [LOC Iceland  ] 's first leftist majority government . 
At the same time , unease over the donations scandal will mean the new government will have work to do in reestablishing public confidence in the political system . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Although the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) continues to meet , the government coalition parties are gaining confidence with just over a week before national elections on April 25 . 
A filibuster by the opposition [ORG Independence Party  ] over constitutional amendments has kept the [ORG Althingi  ] in session closer to the date of elections than at any other time in [MISC Icelandic  ] history , but polling data seems to show that the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] and [ORG Left-Greens  ] have not been damaged by the shortened campaign. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The country 's leading newspapers published their latest poll results on April 16 and 17 . 
Despite measuring significantly different levels of support for the conservative [ORG Independence Party  ] , both polls show that the current [MISC SDA-LG  ] minority government would hold a majority in the [ORG Althingi  ] . 
[ORG Frettabladid  ] 's April 16 poll results showed the [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG LG  ] with 32.2 and 25.7 percent , respectively , while Morgunbladid 's [MISC Gallup  ] poll released on April 17 had the two parties at 30.7 and 28.2 percent . 
[ORG Independence  ] supporters found something to cheer in the [ORG Frettabladid  ] results showing 27.3 percent support , which implied that a campaign finance scandal has done little harm to the party . 
However , the next day 's [MISC Gallup  ] poll showed the [MISC IP  ] dropping to 23.3 percent nationwide , down from 36.6 in the 2007 elections. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Variances aside , the polls were in agreement on three points . 
The new [ORG Citizens' Movement  ] is inching closer to the 5 percent threshold needed to get an MP elected . 
Meanwhile , support for the [ORG Progressive Party  ] continues to hold stagnant around seven percent , meaning that after an initial bounce the party 's new leadership has made no inroads with the public . 
Finally , the idiosyncratic [ORG Liberal Party  ] is in a quagmire at around one or two percent and is clearly not going to win any seats in parliament this year , meaning the party will probably be dissolved in the near future. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Reflecting the news from the polls , leftist politicos have been increasingly upbeat in meetings with embassy officials in recent days . 
Debate now centers on whether or not the [ORG Left-Greens  ] will suffer what has been a traditional collapse of support in the last days before national elections ( in 2007 , they lost 10 percent in the last month of the campaign ) . 
If the current numbers hold , the [MISC IP  ] could see itself fall to an historic low as [LOC Iceland  ] 's third-largest political party. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Independence Party  ] malaise has only deepened over the last week as news emerges regarding political donations made under [LOC Iceland  ] 's previous campaign finance regime . 
Easter weekend headlines were dominated by reports that in 2006 the [MISC IP  ] accepted millions of [MISC ISK  ] in donations from [ORG FL Group  ] ( [MISC ISK  ] 30 million , $238,000 at current exchange rates , or $415,000 at the time ) and [ORG Landsbanki  ] ( [ORG ISK  ] 25 million/$198,000/$346,000 ) only a few days before [LOC Iceland  ] 's first campaign finance law took effect on January 1 , 2007 . 
Once the scandal broke on April 8 , former [MISC IP  ] chairman [PER Geir Haarde  ] immediately sent out a statement saying that he took full responsibility for accepting the donations , though many feel that [PER Haarde  ] was trying to shield the rest of the party from blame only two weeks before national elections. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The fallout continued on April 10 , when the party 's Secretary General [PER Andri Ottarsson  ] resigned , although he claimed to have had no knowledge of the donations ( [PER Ottarsson  ] was hired by the [MISC IP  ] in mid-2006 ) . 
MP and former [ORG Minister of Health Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson  ] took the most heat , and he was forced to retract his categorical denials of any involvement . 
Reports have surfaced that put [PER Thordarson  ] at the center of [MISC IP  ] fundraising efforts in late 2006 , and he is said to have been pressured to resign from the [ORG Althingi  ] or yield his seat at the top of one of the [ORG Reykjavik Constituency  ] lists to a candidate less tainted by scandal . 
[PER Thordarson  ] 's political position has since improved after a slate of his allies was re-elected to the leadership of the [MISC IP  ] 's [ORG Reykjavik  ] chapter , and it is unlikely he will be leaving the stage. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The other three major parties were quick to disclose information about where the sources of their donations in 2006 . 
The [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000075 002 OF 002 [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , which was in government with the [MISC IP  ] in 2006 , initially claimed that privacy concerns prevented it from releasing information about its donors under the old law . 
It quickly relented and released a breakdown of [MISC ISK  ] 23.5 million ( $187,000 at current exchange rates , or $326,000 at the time ) in donations that were over [MISC ISK  ] 1 million each . 
Of those the largest donation was [MISC ISK  ] 5 million from the contractor Eykt , and [MISC ISK  ] 4 million from [ORG Kaupthing Bank  ] . 
A third of the [MISC ISK  ] 23.5 million came from companies associated with the so-called " [ORG S  ] " group ( a holding company made up of three leading insurance and retirement savings firms ) and another third from large contractors and construction firms. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG SDA  ] 's disclosures confirmed for many the party 's close ties with the [ORG Baugur Group  ] , long a bugaboo of the [ORG Independence Party  ] . 
The [ORG SDA  ] received a total of [MISC ISK  ] 45 million ( $357,000 at current exchange rates , or $625,000 at the time ) in 2006 . 
Donations over [MISC ISK  ] 500 thousand amounted to [MISC ISK  ] 36 million . 
Of those the largest donation was [MISC ISK  ] 5 million from [ORG Kaupthing bank  ] and [MISC ISK  ] 4 million from [ORG Landsbanki  ] . 
Of the [MISC ISK  ] 36 million in large donations , 25 percent came from companies associated with the [ORG Baugur Group  ] , and slightly smaller amounts from the [MISC S-Group  ] and father-son investors [PER Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson  ] and [PER Bjorgolfur Thor Bjrgolfsson  ] , respectively. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG LG  ] issued a statement saying that the party 's accounting had always been open to the public and that the largest donation in 2006 was [MISC ISK  ] 1 million ( $8,000 at current exchange rates , or $14,000 at the time ) , from the insurance company [PER Samvinnutryggingar  ] ( one of the [ORG S-group  ] companies ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The campaign contributions scandal has taken a toll on the [MISC IP  ] in the short term at least , according to the latest [MISC Gallup  ] poll , but it remains to be seen whether brouhaha will remain fresh in the minds of voters on [MISC Election Day  ] . 
Many wonder what hardcore [MISC IP  ] supporters will do given their lack of alternatives on the right end of the spectrum . 
Rumors are swirling that many will turn in a blank vote rather than support a party that has failed to adequately deal with the past and has missed repeated opportunities to put forth a new generation of candidates . 
If [MISC IP  ] support drops below 20 percent , the base 's dissatisfaction will be clear . 
In these conditions , anything above 25 percent will be a relative victory for new [ORG IP Chair  ] [PER Bjarni Benediktsson.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment , cont 'd : Many point out that the [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG PP  ] also received donations from large corporations , but not nearly as high as the [MISC IP  ] . 
This has shielded them from taking the same level of criticism , although commentators wonder why the political parties do not disclose financial information reaching further back than 2006 , which naturally begs the question of what there is to hide . 
The [ORG Citizen 's Movement  ] 's jump in the polls may be a reflection of growing dissatisfaction with the party system and a sense that all of [LOC Iceland  ] 's parties are tainted . 
Although voters may put the [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG LG  ] back in power on April 25 , they will have some work ahead of them to turn a sense of resignation into enthusiastic support for the government .
