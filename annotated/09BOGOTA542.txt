[LOC BOGOTA  ] 0401 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Counselor [PER John Creamer  ] Reasons 1.4 ( b and d ) SUMMARY -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [ORG Defense Ministry  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) continues to step up investigations into reports of murders committed by Army personnel , and has fired fifty-one officers and enlisted men implicated in the incidents--including 27 dismissed as a result of the [LOC Soacha  ] murders . 
The [ORG MOD  ] is also working to fix breakdowns in intelligence , operational planning and logistics that contribute to human rights abuses , as well as to implement clearer rules of engagement . 
Still , some senior military officials continue to resist the [ORG MOD  ] 's efforts , arguing that human rights concerns are overstated and that the new policies are harming the war effort . 
Army Commander General [PER Oscar Gonzalez  ] has impeded investigations of abuses by limiting the mandate of the [ORG Army Inspector General  ] . 
With Defense Minister [PER Juan Manuel Santos  ] likely to depart soon to launch his presidential campaign , senior military and civilian officials say it is key that President [PER Uribe  ] appoint a Minister equally committed to human rights if the current progress is to be maintained . 
End Summary [ORG MOD  ] IMPLEMENTS CORRECTIVE MEASURES ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Since October 2008 , the [ORG MOD  ] has dismissed fifty-one officers and enlisted men implicated in extrajudicial killings: 27 Army personnel were fired in October 2008 for the [LOC Soacha  ] killings ; 13 more were dismissed in November 2008 for murders in [LOC Cordoba  ] ; and 11 others were dismissed from [ORG La Popa Battalion  ] in January 2009 for killings in [LOC Cesar  ] . 
In addition to the investigations , the [ORG MOD  ] is implementing the 15-point plan announced by [ORG MOD Santos  ] in November 2008 to improve the military 's human rights record and deter abuses ( see reftel A ) . 
The [ORG MOD  ] is developing clearer rules of military engagement and is designating those criminal bands that are legitimate military targets and those that should be subject to law enforcement action . 
The [ORG GOC  ] also modified an internal directive regulating rewards payments to informants to avoid situations such as the " [PER Rojas  ] " case where the [ORG GOC  ] paid for [ORG FARC Secretariat  ] member [PER Ivan Rios'  ] hand ( and later his corpse ) . 
IG'S MANDATE LIMITED -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Army Inspector General  ] ( [ORG IG  ] ) Major General [PER Carlos Suarez  ] , who was made [ORG IG  ] by [ORG MOD Santos  ] with the specific mandate to investigate extrajudicial killings , told us on February 13 that he and two trusted members of his team are the only personnel who investigate alleged murders committed killings by [ORG Army  ] personnel . 
The investigations follow the model used by [PER Suarez  ] in investigating the [LOC Soacha  ] murders , and examine the operational , intelligence , logistical and administrative components of supposed military operations . 
[PER Suarez  ] clarified that his role is not criminal or disciplinary , but rather administrative . 
He cannot dismiss any personnel on his own , and can only make recommendations to the [ORG Army Commander  ] , Armed Forces Commander , or the [ORG MOD  ] . 
For example , he recommended that 28 [ORG Army  ] officers and other personnel be dismissed from the [ORG Popa Battalion  ] due to their alleged roles in killings in [LOC Cesar  ] , but [ORG Army Commander  ] [PER Oscar Gonzalez  ] approved the removal of only 11 officers . 
PROBLEM WIDESPREAD AND BAD TACTICS ---------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Suarez  ] said the extrajudicial execution problem was widespread . 
He stated that the [LOC Soacha  ] phenomenon originated in the 4th Brigade in [LOC Medellin  ] ( commanded at one time by both former [ORG Army Commander  ] [PER Mario Montoya  ] and current [ORG Army Commander  ] [PER Oscar Gonzalez  ] ) . 
The practice later spread to other brigades and commands in the region , including the [ORG Joint Caribbean Command  ] . 
[PER Suarez  ] said the insistence by some military commanders on body counts as a measure of success despite [ORG MOD  ] directives to the contrary--coupled with some commanders' ties to criminals and narcotraffickers--led to the specific pattern of murders committed in the [LOC Soacha  ] and other cases . 
He noted that the body count system--and the resulting murders--not only undermined the [ORG Army  ] 's legitimacy , but also created a false illusion of success . 
As a result , the " false positives " diverted resources and attention away from the main fight against the [ORG FARC  ] . 
SENIOR LEVEL RESISTANCE TO CHANGE --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Suarez  ] said he continues to enjoy the support of [ORG MOD Santos  ] , Vice Minister of Defense [PER Sergio Jaramillo  ] , and Armed Forces Commander [PER Freddy Padilla  ] . 
Still , he faces resistance from some active duty officers supported by a group of retired generals and right-wing politicians . 
[PER Suarez  ] noted that he was imposed on [ORG Army Commander  ] [PER Gonzalez  ] by [PER Padilla  ] , and that [PER Gonzalez  ] opposes his work . 
He acknowledged that [PER Gonzalez  ] tried to intimidate witnesses not to testify about murders committed by the 11th Brigade in [LOC Sucre  ] , and said [PER Gonzalez  ] tries to limit his office 's resources . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX echoed [PER Suarez  ] 's comments , noting that [PER Gonzalez  ] has transferred personnel from [PER Suarez  ] 's office , reduced his bodyguard contingent , and tried to restrict the [ORG IG  ] 's mandate . 
[PER Suarez  ] added that his family has received indirect threats due to his work . 
His staff is searching for an email allegedly circulating within the military which shows photos of the members of the [ORG MOD Commission  ] that investigated the [LOC Soacha  ] murders with X 's drawn through them. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Beyond the military , [PER Suarez  ] said retired generals such as [PER Montoya  ] and former 17th Brigade Commander [PER Rito Alejo  ] del Rio are working with right-wing politicians like former Minister [PER Fernando Londono  ] to undercut [ORG Santos'  ] human rights initiatives . 
He cited a February 12 " [ORG El Tiempo  ] " Op-ed in which [PER Londono  ] complained that the dismissals over the so-called " false positives " had emasculated the military , leaving officers too scared to conduct operations and returning the tactical initiative to the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Jaramillo  ] told us that some officers are mounting a campaign involving legal action , intimidation , and slander to harass those officers and civilians committed to cleaning up the [ORG Army  ] . 
[PER Jaramillo  ] noted that former Colonel Mejia--who faces criminal charges for his role in the [ORG La Popa  ] murders--has filed complaints with the [ORG Inspector General 's Office  ] ( [ORG Procuraduria  ] ) against him and [ORG Prosecutor General Human Rights Office  ] director [PER Sandra Castro  ] for allegedly forcing witnesses to testify against him . 
BATTLE OVER URIBE'S EAR ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Suarez  ] observed that President [PER Uribe  ] continues to view military success in terms of kills , leaving him susceptible to the arguments of some military officers and politicians that the [ORG MOD  ] 's emphasis on human rights is overstated and is harming the war effort against the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Jaramillo  ] confirmed that the group 's arguments are gaining some traction with [PER Uribe  ] . 
[PER Suarez  ] said the President needs to understand that the previous enemy combat death reports included many non-FARC , creating a misleading view of progress and promoting both bad tactics and officers. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Suarez  ] and [PER Jaramillo  ] discounted charges that the [LOC Soacha  ] investigations and other [ORG MOD  ] human rights initiatives are discouraging military operations against the [ORG FARC  ] , noting that the [ORG Army  ] units which have achieved the greatest results against the terrorist group were not involved in the murders . 
[PER Suarez  ] said [ORG Army Operations Chief Major General  ] [PER Carlos Saavedra  ] agrees that the human rights impact on operations has been minimal ( Embassy 's own analysis supports [PER Suarez  ] and [PER Saavedra  ] 's conclusions . 
See reftel B ) . 
Still , [PER Suarez  ] and [PER Jaramillo  ] said that with [ORG MOD Santos  ] likely to depart soon to launch his presidential campaign , President [PER Uribe  ] 's choice of the next [ORG MOD  ] will be key . 
If the next [ORG MOD  ] does not share [ORG Santos'  ] strong human rights commitment , the progress achieved to date could be reversed .
