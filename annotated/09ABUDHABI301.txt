( C ) During a March 24 meeting with Special Representative for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] , UAE Foreign Minister [PER Shaykh Abdullah  ] bin [PER Zayed Al Nahyan  ] ( [ORG AbZ  ] ) asked if the [LOC United States  ] had changed its ( Ref E ) policy on joining the [ORG International Renewable Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IRENA  ] ) . 
[ORG AbZ  ] recalled his March discussion of the issue with the Secretary in [LOC Sharm al Sheikh  ] and told [PER Holbrooke  ] the [LOC UAE  ] is trying to convince its friends to join [ORG IRENA  ] and support the UAE’s candidacy to host the agency’s headquarters in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] ( refs A , B , and D ) . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said the [LOC UAE  ] was in a “tough fight” with [LOC Germany  ] , the only other viable candidate , and explained the [ORG UAEG  ] argument was based on the symbolic importance of having an international organization ( other than [ORG UNRWA  ] ) headquartered in the region . 
Further , having an oil-producing country host the headquarters of an international renewable energy organization sent an important message about international commitment to renewable energy. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador’s Comment: [PER Shaykh Abdullah’s  ] request for support came in the context of a discussion ( reported septel ) on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] in which the [PER Abdullah  ] and the [LOC Crown Prince  ] ( [PER Shaykh Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayid  ] ) indicated their desire ( based on proven ability ) to be very helpful to the [LOC United States  ] on political issues . 
While there was no direct linkage between [ORG IRENA  ] and [LOC AF/PAK  ] , the former is very clearly something that is important to the [ORG UAEG  ] , and the [LOC UAE  ] expects the USG to be helpful on [ORG IRENA  ] , given the considerable effort the [LOC UAE  ] is putting in to supporting us on our critical issue . 
End Comment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] did not clear this message .
