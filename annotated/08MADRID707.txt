( C ) Summary and [MISC Comment: On June 23  ] , President [PER Zapatero  ] acknowledged the economy 's rapid deceleration , said growth in 2008 would be below 2 percent but would start to recover in the second half of 2009 , and announced 21 reforms . 
The measures include spending cuts that are being perceived as an attempt to show that the [ORG GOS  ] is sharing the public 's pain but are not likely to have a significant impact . 
Most of the other measures are structural reforms that , while they may have positive effects in the medium term , are not likely to address the immediate slowdown . 
Because of a perception that [PER Zapatero  ] has downplayed the severity of the economic situation , initial public reaction was skeptical . 
As the [ORG GOS  ] cannot do much in the short term about high fuel or food prices or the housing slowdown and is locked in the monetary straightjacket of the [ORG ECB  ] , nothing it does is likely to satisfy the public . 
The next year or two could be unpleasant for the government , as well as for [MISC Spaniards  ] . 
End Summary and [ORG Comment.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In his an annual state of the economy report on June 23 , President [PER Zapatero  ] acknowledged that the [MISC Spanish  ] economy was indeed suffering a rapid de-acceleration , with growth now expected to be less than 2 percent for 2008 as a whole , though it would start to recover in the second half of 2009 . 
Despite this admission , [PER Zapatero  ] assured the public that [LOC Spain  ] was in a strong position to confront the situation and would overcome this slowdown by the second half of 2009 . 
[PER Zapatero  ] refrained from using the word " crisis , " a term which has been used frequently by the media and by opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] leaders to describe the current economic situation and criticize the government. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) During the speech , [PER Zapatero  ] presented a package of 21 short- , mid- , and long-term measures to improve [LOC Spain  ] 's competitiveness and address the economic situation . 
They included measures to confront the deceleration , austerity measures , and structural reforms . 
A list follows: Measures to Address the Deceleration <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 .

Facilitate the creation of businesses within 24 hours ; <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
Reduce administrative burdens for businesses. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) These 21 measures come on the heels of the June 13 approval by the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] of a draft law that would accelerate value-added tax returns and eliminate wealth taxes in 2009 , with a combined expansionary impact of 7.8 billion euros in 2009 . 
This was the government 's second major stimulus effort since [PER Zapatero  ] 's reelection in April . 
The first was the April 18 package ( reftel ) that included the 400 euro refunds promised in the campaign and is expected to [ORG MADRID  ] 00000707 002.2 OF 002 have a combined expansionary impact of 10 billion euros in 2008 and 8 billion in 2009 . 
Assuming the legislature cooperates as expected , the total stimulus from both sets of measures will be about 1 percent of GDP in 2008 and 1.6 percent in 2009. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Although  ] the structural reforms could eventually increase productivity , many of the measures [PER Zapatero  ] announced will have little impact in the short term , several are far from being implemented , and many were already planned . 
In terms of macroeconomic impact , it does not look very coherent for the government to announce spending cuts just 10 days after approving an expansionary stimulus program . 
However , the spending cuts are expected to save only 250 million euros in 2008 and 2009 combined , a contraction dwarfed by the almost 26 billion euro expansionary impact of the two stimulus packages . 
Second Vice President and Finance Minister [PER Solbes  ] ( who is reported to have not been involved in preparation of the package ) has characterized the June 23 austerity measures as psychological . 
Initial public reactions suggested that they are seen as politically rather than economically motivated , to give an example of the government sharing in the hard times and taking action . 
Even the structural reforms do not address labor laws , which many economists consider an important target for reform. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment continued: It is not clear that the [ORG GOS  ] has policy options that would enable it to satisfy public wishes . 
The budget surplus of previous years that it had said gave it maneuvering room is gone as a result of lower tax receipts . 
Inflation is stubbornly high , and unemployment is expected to pass 10 percent and continue rising into next year . 
There will be no expansionary monetary policy in line with the [ORG GOS  ] , fiscal stimulus as long as the [ORG European Central Bank  ] keeps interest rates high to fight inflation . 
The average [MISC Spaniard  ] is experiencing the effects of higher food and fuel prices every day and is well aware of the collapse in residential construction . 
Regular news of real or threatened strikes by various interest groups to protest rising prices or other economic concerns heightens the awareness of the economic difficulties faced around the country. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment continued: If the media and the public believed [PER Zapatero  ] 's statement that the economy will start to recover in the second half of next year , the mood might be different . 
However , at the moment his and the [MISC GOS'  ] credibility on economic issues is low . 
Over the last several months , he and his economic team have regularly revised downward their forecasts , as previous projections -- whether for how low growth would drop , when it would rebound , how rapidly unemployment would increase , or when inflation would start to decline -- proved too optimistic . 
There is a widespread perception that [PER Zapatero  ] and the [ORG GOS  ] intentionally downplayed the severity of the situation during the campaign for the April 9 elections. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment continued: Perhaps because he does not want to damage already shaky consumer confidence , he and other officials have refused to use the word " crisis . 
" While the current situation may not be a crisis in the strictest sense of the word , it is certainly a difficult period , and [PER Zapatero  ] 's statements have given many the impression that he is either intentionally downplaying the problem or does not understand its severity . 
This speech appears to have been an attempt to show that he understood the severity of the situation and was taking action . 
However , since the [ORG GOS  ] cannot do much in the short term about high fuel or food prices or the housing slowdown and does not have monetary levers to stimulate the economy , it is not likely to satisfy the public . 
It could be an unpleasant next year or two for the government , as well as for [MISC Spaniards  ] .
