Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: As a presidential candidate , [PER Lee Myoung-bak  ] called for a “creative reconstruction” of [MISC Korea’s  ] foreign policy . 
In his February 2008 inaugural address , [PER Lee  ] criticized his two predecessors , saying , “At times over the last ten years , we found ourselves faltering and confused.” He vowed to trade ideology for pragmatism as [MISC Korea’s  ] surest means of improving ties with its neighbors , and he’s had some successes , especially with [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , where [PER Lee  ] was able to expand substantially economic and political ties . 
[ORG Lee’s  ] efforts on [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] are more mixed . 
With [LOC Japan  ] , the [MISC South Korean  ] public was not quite ready to accept fully [ORG Lee’s  ] attempts to compartmentalize history issues . 
Still , much progress was made in [MISC Seoul-Tokyo  ] consultations on a variety of issues ranging from [LOC North Korea  ] to economic to even security issues . 
On [LOC North Korea  ] , [ORG Lee’s  ] conservative agenda was predictably rebuffed by [LOC Pyongyang  ] . 
However , all signs are that President [PER Lee  ] is quite comfortable in sticking to denuclearization and reciprocity as the basis of his [LOC North Korea  ] policy , especially as it enjoys considerable support . 
End Summary. ---- [LOC DPRK  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a February 2007 speech that has widely come to be known as the “MB Doctrine , ” presidential candidate [PER Lee  ] Myung-bank firmed up his vision of his administration’s [LOC North Korea  ] Policy . 
[PER Lee  ] said his first priority would be to abolish what he described as his predecessors’ “unprincipled and unilateral policy of appeasement” toward the [LOC DPRK  ] and replace it with a policy that offered generous assistance in exchange for [ORG North Korea’s  ] complete nuclear dismantlement and Pyongyang’s accommodation of [MISC South Korea’s  ] desire for family reunion , accounting of welfare and whereabouts of POWs from the [MISC Korean  ] War and several hundred abductees after the war . 
Immediately upon taking office , the [ORG Lee Administration  ] also made it clear that it would review all commitments from the two [MISC South-North  ] summits -- June 2000 and October 2007 . 
Senior [ORG Lee Administration  ] officials complained publicly that the October 2007 summit between [PER Kim Jong-il  ] and President [PER Roh Moo-hyun  ] was arranged by [PER Roh  ] to favor the progressive candidate in the presidential election two months later and that therefore President [PER Lee  ] was not bound to fulfill promises amounting to billions of dollars of aid to the [MISC North.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The response from [LOC Pyongyang  ] was predictably swift and severe . 
Using threatening language not heard since the [PER Kim Young-sam  ] days , [LOC North Korea  ] has moved step by step to cut off inter-Korean relations . 
Initially , all inter-Korean meetings were cancelled , with the [LOC North  ] loudly proclaiming that food aid from the [LOC South  ] was neither needed nor wanted . 
Thereafter , [LOC Pyongyang  ] implemented a draconian restriction in December of [MISC North-South  ] cross-border traffic , stopping [ORG Kaesong  ] tourism and severely limiting traffic to the [ORG Kaesong Industrial Complex  ] . 
As the [ORG Kumgang  ] tourism had been stopped by the [MISC South  ] over the July shooting death of a [MISC Southern  ] tourist , the net result has been a crippling blow to the [ORG KIC  ] and [ORG Kumgang  ] tourism , the two proudest results of the Sunshine policy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With both sides dug in , the outlook for any quick improvement in inter-Korean relations is slim to none . 
Much more likely is the continued “psychological war , ” as characterized by Foreign Minister [PER Yu Myung-hwan  ] in his recent meeting with the Ambassador . 
President [PER Lee  ] is determined not to give in to [MISC North Korean  ] pressure . 
Our [LOC Blue House  ] contacts have told us on several occasions that President [PER Lee  ] remained quite comfortable with his [LOC North Korea  ] policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office , if necessary . 
It is also our assessment that [ORG Lee’s  ] more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the [LOC North  ] , even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship . 
Also favoring the [PER Lee  ] Administration’s stance is the the [MISC Korean  ] public , which is calm to the point of apathy about the inter-Korean situation. ----- [LOC Japan  ] ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) President [PER Lee  ] has made concerted efforts to improve relations with [LOC Tokyo  ] , which were significantly strained during the [PER Roh Moo-hyun  ] era over history and territory issues . 
[PER Lee  ] sought to compartmentalize what he called “disputes over the past” , stating in an early policy address that “South [LOC Korea  ] and [LOC Japan  ] should...try to foster a future-oriented relationship with a pragmatic attitude . 
Historical truth must not be ignored , but we can no longer afford to give up our future relations due to disputes over the past.” [ORG Lee’s  ] vision was to look beyond the history-bound bilateral issues and create a [MISC Korea-Japan  ] partnership active in the regional and global arena on issues like the denuclearization of the [LOC DPRK  ] , strengthening of multilateral relationships , trade and economics , and cooperation on projects like alternative energy , communicable diseases , and poverty alleviation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) So far , [ORG Lee’s  ] efforts have yielded some success , although [LOC Blue House  ] officials would argue that results would have been far better had [LOC Tokyo  ] shown more courage , especially in dealing with the [MISC Takeshima/Dokdo  ] issue . 
For example , [PER Lee  ] pressed ahead with his plan to engage [LOC Japan  ] on a more strategic regional and global level . 
[PER Lee  ] made the decision that [LOC Korea  ] would participate in the October [ORG U.S.-Japan-Korea Trilateral Policy Planning  ] talks ( Ref A ) in [LOC Tokyo  ] . 
He then agreed to the [ORG U.S.-Japan-Korea Defense Trilateral Talks  ] ( Ref B ) in [LOC Washington  ] in November , the first trilateral defense talks in six years . 
[PER Lee  ] also initiated the first ever stand-alone [ORG China-Japan-Korea Trilateral Summit  ] ( Ref C ) in [LOC Fukuoka  ] in December . 
Critics will of course point out that there were no substantive results from these meetings , but the fact that the meetings were held at all is a significant result. ----- [LOC China  ] ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) President [PER Lee  ] has openly courted the [MISC Chinese  ] , and he has chalked up some noteworthy successes . 
Less than one year into his term , [PER Lee  ] has already met with [ORG PRC  ] President [PER Hu Jintao  ] three times , quite unprecedented in the history of [MISC ROK-PRC  ] relations ( Ref D ) ; typically , in the past , the [ORG ROK  ] could expect only one visit in a [ORG PRC  ] president’s ten-year term . 
[PER Lee  ] paid his first state visit to [LOC Beijing  ] in May 2008 and met [PER Hu  ] again in August when [PER Lee  ] traveled to [LOC Beijing  ] for the [MISC Olympics  ] . 
[PER Hu  ] paid a state visit to [LOC Seoul  ] August 25-26 . 
President [PER Lee  ] made the relations seem a two-way desire . 
A [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy contact told us that [LOC Beijing  ] had been concerned that [MISC China-Korea  ] relations would suffer because of the emphasis [PER Lee  ] wanted to put on improving [MISC U.S.-Korea  ] relations . 
Therefore , [LOC China  ] was pleasantly surprised that [PER Lee  ] was able to improve both bilateral relationships simultaneously . 
[PER Kim Heung-kyu  ] , Professor of [ORG Chinese Security and Foreign Policy  ] at the [ORG Institute of Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG National Security  ] , said [PER Lee  ] had effectively leveraged the [MISC U.S.-Korea  ] relationship to improve relations with [LOC China  ] , which is eager for closer ties with [LOC Korea  ] to check [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Japanese  ] interests in the region. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) During [ORG Lee’s  ] first visit to [LOC Beijing  ] , he and [PER Hu  ] issued a joint statement which upgraded the [MISC Korea-China  ] relationship to a “strategic cooperative partnership” . 
Our [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy contact gave the clearest explanation of what was now “strategic” about the [MISC ROK-PRC  ] relationship: that China’s nomenclature to describe its relations with [LOC Korea  ] was upgraded according to a roughly five-year schedule . 
In 1992 , relations were normalized ; in 1998 , the first year of [PER Kim Dae-jung’s  ] term as President , the [MISC Chinese  ] upgraded the relationship to “cooperative partnership” ; in 2002 , it was upgraded again to “comprehensive cooperative partnership , ” and now it is “strategic cooperative partnership.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite the name , [MISC Koreans  ] have found substantive strategic discussions with the [MISC Chinese  ] frustratingly difficult . 
For example , [PER Lee  ] , unlike his immediate predecessors , [PER Kim Dae-jung  ] and [PER Roh Moo-hyun  ] , added [MISC North Korean  ] human rights to the [MISC Korea-China  ] summit agenda in August , asking [PER Hu  ] not to repatriate [MISC North Korean  ] refugees against their will . 
[PER Hu  ] did not respond to [ORG Lee’s  ] request ( Ref E ) . 
Also , we understand , [PER Lee  ] asked [PER Hu  ] what [LOC China  ] thought about the [MISC North Korean  ] domestic political situation and whether [LOC Beijing  ] had any contingency plans . 
This time , [PER Hu  ] apparently pretended not to hear [PER Lee  ] . 
Still , the [ORG ROK  ] did not come away empty , because , despite initial [MISC Chinese  ] objections , [PER Lee  ] was successful in including in the summit joint statement a commitment “to promote dialogue and cooperation in the field of international human rights.” ------ [LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Lee  ] has largely continued the trend of his predecessors in upgrading economic ties with [LOC Russia  ] . 
[LOC ROK-Russia  ] economic ties have grown more than 40% annually for the past three years , with two-way trade exceeding USD 15 billion in 2007 . 
Much of the growth is due to [MISC Russia’s  ] natural resources . 
For example , [PER Lee  ] paid a state visit to [LOC Moscow  ] in September and agreed to a contract for [LOC Russia  ] to supply [LOC Korea  ] with 7.5 million tons of natural gas annually for thirty years beginning from 2015 , amounting to an estimated 20% of [PER Korea’s  ] annual natural gas consumption . 
And despite doubts about [MISC North Korea’s  ] cooperation , [PER Lee  ] agreed in principle to [LOC Russia  ] exploring plans for a pipeline through [LOC North Korea  ] to deliver the gas . 
The two countries also agreed to investigate the possibilities for linking the inter-Korean railway to the trans-Siberian railway system ( Ref F ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On his state visit , [PER Lee  ] also signed an agreement to upgrade the [LOC ROK-Russia  ] relationship to a “Strategic Cooperative [PER Partnership”  ] , the same term used by [LOC China  ] to describe this year’s upgrade to the [MISC ROK-PRC  ] relationship . 
[PER Ko Jae-nam  ] , of [ORG MOFAT’s Institute of Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG National Security  ] , said [LOC Korea  ] proposed using the term “Strategic Cooperative [PER Partnership”  ] after [LOC China  ] used the term to describe the [MISC ROK-PRC  ] relationship . 
[PER Ko  ] said [PER Korea’s  ] objective in using the same terminology to describe the [LOC ROK-Russia  ] relationship was to balance the [MISC ROK-PRC  ] relationship. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) During a year in which President [PER Lee  ] faced considerable difficulty advancing his domestic agenda , his foreign policy efforts , if not wildly successful , at least did not get him into trouble . 
To a considerable degree , relations with [MISC South Korea’s  ] neighbors are driven by economic realities -- increased regional trade , investment , and tourism -- that mesh with [ORG Lee’s  ] pragmatic , non-ideological approach . 
Relations with [LOC North Korea  ] were the outlier , as the [LOC DPRK  ] took pains in 2008 to demonstrate that it could live without [ORG ROK  ] assistance .
