( C ) Summary and [ORG Comment: Pakistan’s Supreme Court  ] ruled February 25 that both [PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] from the opposition [ORG Pakistan Muslim League-N  ] ( [MISC PML-N  ] ) party are ineligible to hold public office . 
President [PER Zardari  ] told Charge that he had temporarily appointed PPP Governor Taseer as Chief Executive pending an election to replace [PER Shahbaz  ] , that the government would consider additional legal appeals , and that he did not expect significant political fallout from the Court’s decision . 
The street reaction will be “in the hundreds , not the millions , ” claimed [PER Zardari  ] . 
[PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] told Principal Officer [LOC Lahore  ] that the decision , which they claimed was entirely [MISC Zardari’s  ] , was a declaration of war ; they would not seek legal appeals and instead would take their battle to the streets . 
In a press conference , [PER Nawaz  ] revealed that [PER Zardari  ] had offered to drop the case in exchange for [MISC PML-N  ] agreement to extend the tenure of the current Chief Justice of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] ; he called on [MISC Pakistanis  ] to come out into the streets to protest. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Even before the press conference , there were sporadic demonstrations in [LOC Punjab  ] , particularly [LOC Lahore  ] , and [MISC Islamabad/Rawalpindi  ] ; we expect additional demonstrations tomorrow . 
Both Embassy and Consulate [ORG Lahore  ] held [ORG EAC  ] meetings and sent [ORG LES  ] staff home early to avoid traffic problems . 
Following the decision , [MISC PML-N  ] certainly will participate in the lawyers’ march , planned to begin in [LOC Karachi  ] on March 12 and end on March 16 in [LOC Islamabad  ] with a proposed sit-in. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The decision comes as no surprise as [PER Zardari  ] has been telling us for weeks that he was going to move against [PER Nawaz  ] . 
This was a controversial move within the [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) and one that PM [PER Gilani  ] tried to forestall two days ago in talks with [PER Shahbaz  ] that apparently were not blessed by [PER Zardari  ] . 
Before moving , [PER Zardari  ] expanded the coalition’s seats in the [ORG National Assembly  ] and worked out deals in three of four provinces to ensure the [ORG PPP  ] will increase its seats in upcoming [ORG Senate  ] elections. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The ruling will open up the battle for control of the [ORG Punjab Provincial Assembly  ] and prompt renewed rounds of inter-party negotiations . 
If [PER Zardari  ] is right and the street reaction remains modest , we expect little real political change to emerge from this Court decision . 
If Nawaz’s gamble pays off and he can bring significant crowds into the streets , the [ORG Army  ] could possibly be called out to maintain law and order . 
We expect a renewed rush of predictions that this will prompt the [ORG Army  ] to replace [PER Zardari  ] ; certainly , the military will consider the Court decision as unnecessary and ill-timed , but we still have no indications the military would move to oust [PER Zardari  ] or pave the way for a [MISC PML-N  ] government . 
With the ongoing debacle in [LOC Swat  ] and a high-level [MISC Pakistani  ] delegation in [LOC Washington  ] , few will challenge the perception of the bad timing of this move . 
It also demonstrates , disappointingly , that [PER Zardari  ] continues to play politics while his country disintegrates . 
End Summary . 
The Decision - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 25 , a three-judge panel of [ORG Pakistan’s Supreme Court  ] effectively ruled that both opposition [ORG Pakistan Muslim League-N  ] ( [ORG PML-N  ] ) leaders [PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] were disqualified from holding public office . 
The judges issued an oral ruling from the bench , dismissing all of the appeals by [PER Sharif  ] proxies ; one anti-Sharif petition was not struck down . 
The [MISC Sharifs  ] themselves had refused to appeal the original rulings against them , questioning the legitimacy of this Court , which took oath of office under Musharraf’s November 2007 provisional constitution order ( [ORG PCO  ] ) . 
To settle ruffled political feathers when the [ORG LHC  ] decision was announced , the [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) government [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000415 002 OF 004 decided to represent the [MISC Sharifs  ] in an appeal to the [ORG Supreme Court.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) By dismissing the pro-Sharif appeals , those original , adverse rulings stand , [ORG Attorney General  ] [PER Latif Khosa  ] told PolOff February 25 . 
The [ORG Lahore High Court  ] ( [ORG LHC  ] ) ruled in June 2008 that [PER Nawaz  ] was disqualified to run for a [ORG National Assembly  ] seat because of his previous hijacking and corruption convictions . 
The [ORG LHC  ] held that [PER Nawaz  ] had not proven the [PER Musharraf  ] administration pardoned these convictions instead of simply commuting the prison sentence. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) There is continuing confusion over Shahbaz’s case . 
The [ORG Lahore Elections Ruling  ] Officer decided in December 2007 that [PER Shahbaz  ] was disqualified to run for a [ORG Punjab Provincial Assembly  ] seat because of a previous loan default . 
According to [PER Khosa  ] , today’s decision automatically throws out the later decisions by the Ruling Officer , as well as by the [ORG Lahore Election Tribunal  ] , allowing [PER Shahbaz  ] to run in a June 2008 by-election . 
[ORG PML-N  ] spokesman [PER Ahsan Iqbal  ] , however , told [MISC Polcons  ] that the disqualification was based on a technical fault when [PER Shahbaz  ] failed to announce which seat he would claim from his victories in the June by-election . 
In any case , [PER Shahbaz  ] is disqualified from serving in the [ORG Punjab Provincial Assembly  ] , and this is the prerequisite for being Chief Minister . 
[ORG PPP Reaction  ] ------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The decision was no surprise ; [PER Zardari  ] advised Ambassador weeks ago that he felt he had to move to rein in [PER Nawaz  ] ( Ref ) . 
However , in a phone call , Zardari--just back from his latest trip to China--told Charge February 25 that he had “nothing to do with the decision” and had been surprised by Shahbaz’s disqualification . 
He noted that the Court had ruled against the government , which had been representing the [MISC Sharifs  ] . 
He said he had ordered [ORG PPP Punjab  ] Governor Taseer to temporarily take over the [ORG Punjab  ] government until new elections for a Chief Minister could be held . 
He expected the [ORG PPP  ] would have a candidate and thought the [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] ( [ORG PML  ] ) party would also be interested in running a candidate. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Asked about any further legal steps , [PER Zardari  ] indicated the government might consider going back to the [ORG Lahore High Court  ] to appeal the decision . 
He said he was not concerned about political fallout , as the initial reaction had been for hundreds , not millions , of people in the streets . 
Interior Minister [PER Malik  ] told Charge essentially the same thing and reiterated that the government had not anticipated that [PER Shahbaz  ] would be disqualified. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) After the ruling , AG [PER Khosa  ] today noted to PolOff that the [ORG PML-N  ] could always negotiate with the [ORG PPP  ] to amend the qualification/disqualification provisions of [ORG Pakistan’s Constitution  ] . 
Information Minister [PER Sherry Rehman  ] told [MISC PolCouns  ] , however , that the decision was “unsettling” and the reaction “would be volatile.” [ORG PPP  ] parliamentarian [PER Farah Ispahani  ] ( [PER Zardari  ] confidant and wife of Pakistan’s Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Husain Haqqani  ] ) told [MISC PolCouns  ] February 25 that today’s Court decision “is not the end of the story.” The [MISC GOP  ] might even appeal the decision . 
( Note: There is a provision for “review” of [ORG Supreme Court  ] decisions but only by the same bench . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Ispahani  ] confided that [PER Zardari  ] would take further actions to ensure the March 12-16 lawyers’ march/sit-in “would not cause problems.” She hinted at proposals affecting former Chief [PER Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry  ] and [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] . 
Asked why [PER Zardari  ] chose now to move on this long-stalled decision , [PER Ispahani  ] said the PPP-led [MISC GOP  ] “had no choice” because Prime Minister [PER Yousuf Gilani  ] had entered into discussions with [PER Shahbaz  ] on February 23. “We are very unhappy with the way [PER Gilani  ] has gone off the reservation” while [PER Zardari  ] was in [LOC China  ] , she said . 
According to unconfirmed press reports , [PER Gilani  ] had assured [PER Shahbaz  ] that the [ORG PPP  ] would not try to remove the [MISC Sharifs  ] from power in [ORG Punjab  ] and suggested [PER Chaudhry  ] might lead a new “Constitutional Court , ” proposed by the 2006 [ORG PPP/PML-N Charter of Democracy  ] . 
[ORG PPP Moves  ] in on the [ORG Punjab ISLAMABAD  ] 00000415 003 OF 004 -------------------------- 12 . 
( C ) Despite Gilani’s assurance to [PER Shahbaz  ] earlier in the week , [PER Zardari  ] is already moving in on the [ORG Punjab  ] government . 
In addition to temporarily ( for two months ) appointing Governor Taseer as Chief Executive pending an election to replace [PER Shahbaz  ] , he has fired the [ORG Punjab  ] Chief Secretary and replaced him with [PER Kamran Lashari  ] , a long-time [ORG PPP  ] supporter . 
[PER MOI Malik  ] told Charge that the [ORG Punjab Inspector General  ] of the Police technically was not fired but since he was so close to the [MISC Sharifs  ] , he has voluntarily vacated the office . 
Both the Chief Secretary and IG Police are federal appointees . 
Opposition Reaction ------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Principal Officer Lahore met February 25 with [PER Shahbaz  ] and [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] ( septel ) to hear their reaction . 
The [MISC Sharifs  ] pre-briefed what [PER Nawaz  ] said in his press conference , namely that they laid the decision at [LOC Zardari’s  ] door and it was not in the interests of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] democracy . 
As proof of [LOC Zardari’s  ] complicity , [PER Nawaz  ] revealed to [ORG PO  ] and later in his press conference that [PER Zardari  ] had offered [PER Shahbaz  ] a “business deal” -- if the [ORG PML-N  ] would agree to extend [ORG Supreme Court Justice Dogar’s  ] tenure and agreed to stop attacks on the [ORG PPP  ] , then [PER Zardari  ] would drop the [ORG Supreme Court  ] cases against the [ORG Sharifs.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Shahbaz  ] told the [ORG PO  ] that this was now “war” with the [ORG PPP  ] , and the [ORG PML-N  ] would take their battle directly to the streets . 
The [MISC Sharifs  ] would not appeal the decision in Musharraf’s PCO courts . 
[ORG PML-N  ] would not resign from the [ORG Punjab Assembly  ] and might run its own candidate for Chief Minister . 
If they did , [ORG PML-N  ] could succeed without the support of the [LOC PML.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) In [MISC Nawaz’s  ] press conference , he carefully tried to create friction against [PER Zardari  ] on several levels . 
He said the [ORG PML-N  ] did not blame the [ORG PPP  ] rank and file for this decision , expressed concern that it was a “slap in the face” to [MISC Punjabis  ] , and declared there was no chance of rapprochement with [PER Zardari  ] . 
He suggested that [PER Zardari  ] was obsessed with concern that a reinstated Chief [PER Justice Chaudhry  ] would declare invalid the [ORG National Reconciliation Order  ] that absolved [PER Zardari  ] of corruption charges . 
He said it would be “catastrophic” if [MISC Pakistanis  ] did not take to the streets to protest this decision , and he affirmed that the [ORG PML-N  ] would fully participate in the March 12-16 lawyers’ long march. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [ORG PML-N  ] Spokespersons [PER Ahsan Iqbal  ] and [ORG Siddiq-ul-Farooq  ] declared , “We do not recognize this court.” [PER Iqbal  ] went even further , charging [PER Zardari  ] with “assuming the mantle of [PER Musharraf  ] , ” a theme we expect the [ORG PML-N  ] to press in the coming days . 
Religious Jamaat-e-Islami ( [ORG JI  ] ) party leader [PER Qazi Hussain  ] disavowed the [PER Musharraf  ] court . 
The leader of Musharraf’s [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] ( [ORG PML  ] ) party , [PER Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain  ] , declared the [ORG Court’s  ] decision was “nothing to be happy about” but noted that the [ORG PML  ] would respect the decision . 
The [ORG Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development  ] and [ORG Transparency  ] ( [ORG PILDAT  ] ) had named an “independent observer” to watch the case ; [ORG PILDAT  ] issued a statement questioning whether justice had been served with this verdict . 
Public Reaction --------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The public’s reaction was swift . 
Sporadic demonstrations began in [LOC Lahore  ] , and other cities throughout [ORG Punjab  ] saw large crowds . 
In [LOC Lahore  ] , streets were blocked with tire fires and [ORG PPP  ] posters were torn down . 
[ORG PO Lahore  ] reported a tense mood as well as limitations on movements around the city . 
The [ORG Islamabad Police  ] briefly shut down [ORG Constitution Avenue  ] around official buildings to warn against spontaneous demonstrations . 
The capital’s [ORG Abpara Market  ] did attract about one thousand , according to [ORG RSO  ] , and the airport road was shut down by crowds tearing down [ORG PPP  ] posters and throwing rocks . 
As of this writing , the airport road remains closed and airport operations are uncertain . 
Both Embassy [ORG Islamabad  ] and [ORG Consulate Lahore  ] held [ORG EAC  ] meetings and allowed LES staff to depart early . 
Several bar associations have [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000415 004 OF 004 called for strikes. and we expect additional demonstrations in the coming days . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Reaction ------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] asked Charge for a readout of [ORG PO Lahore’s  ] meeting with [PER Nawaz  ] ; Charge said that the [ORG PO  ] had conveyed the [LOC U.S.  ] position that this was an internal matter for the [MISC Pakistani  ] government . 
In his press conference , [PER Nawaz  ] characterized the visit as a courtesy call . 
[ORG PML-N  ] spokesman [PER Ahsan  ] warned [MISC Polcouns  ] that [MISC Pakistanis  ] would assume the [LOC U.S.  ] , as a firm supporter of [PER Zardari  ] , had supported the decision and urged that we issue a statement expressing concern. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Comment: The decision comes as no surprise ; [PER Zardari  ] has been telling us for weeks that it was coming and that he felt he could control the reaction . 
Before making this move , he coaxed the [ORG Muttahida Quami Movement  ] party into the coalition to renew Gilani’s majority in the [ORG National Assembly  ] ( Ref B ) . 
He also successfully sealed a power sharing deal in three of the four provinces over seats in the upcoming [ORG Senate  ] elections ( Ref A ) to ensure the [ORG PPP  ] will have a majority in the [ORG Senate.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The game now will be controlling the street , and [PER Zardari  ] has about two weeks if he is to make any repairs to reduce the impact of the March 12-16 lawyers’ march . 
If [PER Zardari  ] is correct and the street reaction is muted , we expect the Court ruling to have no immediate impact on [ORG PPP  ] rule . 
If [MISC Nawaz’s  ] gamble -- to provoke enough protests to require the [ORG Army  ] to come out and restore order -- pays off , we may see a different dynamic . 
So far , we still have no indication the [ORG Army  ] has any interest in ousting [PER Zardari  ] or ushering in a [ORG PML-N  ] government. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] may indeed win the short-term tactical battle against [PER Nawaz  ] . 
In the longer term , however , [PER Nawaz  ] is playing his cards well and now has grounds to compare what he will term [LOC Zardari’s  ] high-handed rule to that of [PER Musharraf  ] . 
Many in the [ORG PPP  ] disagreed with the decision to challenge [PER Nawaz  ] , so [PER Zardari  ] has further alienated party faithful . 
This decision and promises of additional deals for the former Chief Justice or [PER Shahbaz  ] demonstrate , disappointingly , that [PER Zardari  ] remains focused on political machinations rather than the militant threat in [LOC Swat  ] and the tribal areas .
