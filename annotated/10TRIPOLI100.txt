Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: In a February 2 meeting with the Ambassador , the director of the [ORG Libyan Immigration and Passports Department  ] , [ORG Brigadier General Mohamed  ] al [PER Rammali  ] , said that [MISC American  ] businesspeople can now " easily get visas to [LOC Libya  ] , just like the [MISC Europeans  ] " provided that they have an invitation letter from a [MISC Libyan  ] company . 
In response to the Ambassador 's urging that [LOC Libya  ] also start issuing visas to [LOC U.S.  ] tourists , [PER Rammali  ] indicated that the [ORG GOL  ] still refuses to do so because of concerns about the safety of [MISC Americans:  ] " they are a better target for [ORG Al Qaida  ] than the [MISC European  ] tourists . 
" [PER Rammali  ] underlined that , due to [LOC Libya  ] 's being on the list of countries whose citizens require additional [ORG TSA  ] screening when traveling to the [LOC U.S.  ] , the ban on [LOC U.S.  ] tourists to [LOC Libya  ] is unlikely to be lifted soon . 
He noted that he will sign the [MISC PISCES  ] agreement on behalf of the [ORG GOL  ] as soon as the [MISC Arabic-English  ] translations have been compared . 
The Ambassador also pressed [PER Rammali  ] on a long-standing ACS case . 
End summary 2 . 
( C ) [PER Rammali  ] , who had last met with the Embassy in 2006 , commented at the outset of the meeting that it was " highly unusual " for him to meet with foreign diplomats , and that all future contact would need to take place through the [ORG MFA  ] . 
In response to the Ambassador 's queries , he stressed that " since November 2009 , when the regulations changed , [MISC American  ] businesspeople coming to [LOC Libya  ] are treated just like [MISC Europeans  ] . 
" According to [PER Rammali  ] , whose department is responsible for granting visa approvals for foreigners visitors to [LOC Libya  ] , [MISC American  ] businesspeople simply need a letter of invitation from a [MISC Libyan  ] company ; the company then files the visa application and letter with the [ORG Libyan Immigration and Passports Department  ] , and a visa will subsequently be granted " usually within one week . 
" ( Note: For the past year , our business contacts have complained repeatedly about the difficulties they encounter in getting [LOC U.S.  ] businesspeople to [LOC Libya  ] , including long delays and astronomical fees . 
End note ) . 
To highlight his office 's work in granting visas to [MISC American  ] businesspeople , [PER Rammali  ] showed the Ambassador a spreadsheet containing the names and passport numbers of 284 [LOC U.S.  ] businesspeople to whom he had issued visas in January 2010 . 
He said that the visa fees " are not more than the 178 dinars ( equivalent to USD 140 ) that [MISC Libyans  ] are charged for the [LOC U.S.  ] visa process , " and highlighted that in the past month , he had refused a visa to only one [MISC American  ] visa applicant . 
3 . 
( C ) In response to the Ambassador 's pressing for an end to the apparent freeze on the issuance of [MISC Libyan  ] visas to official USG-related travelers , [PER Rammali  ] noted that he is responsible for " normal " travelers only , not official ones . 
The Ambassador then urged that the [MISC Libyan  ] ban on issuing visas to [LOC U.S.  ] tourists be lifted , particularly given the fact the Embassy is now issuing dozens of visas every day to [MISC Libyan  ] tourists . 
[PER Rammali  ] highlighted [ORG GOL  ] concerns that [MISC American  ] tourists will " attract terrorists " and that they " are at higher risk of getting attacked by [PER Al Qaida  ] when they go out in the desert than [MISC Italian  ] or [MISC French  ] tourists . 
" He also opined that after the recent announcement that [MISC Libyans  ] will be subject to additional [ORG TSA  ] screening when traveling to the [LOC U.S.  ] , " the timing is not right for us to start issuing tourist visas ... you should be encouraging us to do so with positive measures , rather than adding us to lists where our citizens get screened . 
" The Ambassador urged [PER Rammali  ] not to view the breadth of the full range of the bilateral relationship simply through the lens of [ORG TSA  ] screening . 
He encouraged [PER Rammali  ] to advocate within the [ORG GOL  ] for the issuance of visas to [MISC American  ] tourists , suggesting that as a first step , [LOC Libya  ] might issue visas for a few [LOC U.S.  ] citizens to join a larger foreign tour group to [LOC Libya  ] , and then subsequently build up to issuing more tourist visas . 
[PER Rammali  ] pledged to discuss the issue within the [ORG GOL  ] , but " we need time . 
" 4 . 
( C ) [PER Rammali  ] flagged that [ORG National Security Advisor Muatasim  ] al [PER Qadhafi  ] has asked him to be the [MISC Libyan  ] signatory on the [MISC PISCES  ] agreement , which would create the framework for enhanced border security cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Rammali  ] said he needed to compare the [MISC Arabic  ] and [MISC English  ] translations of the document , and then would send it back to the Embassy through the [ORG MFA  ] . 
Once we had also agreed to the text , the agreement could be signed . 
The Ambassador urged [PER Rammali  ] to move quickly on the agreement , noting that he hoped to sign it before the end of February . 
5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised a long-standing ACS case with [PER Rammali  ] , urging that [PER Mohamed Ghennewa  ] , an [MISC American-Libyan  ] citizen and LES Embassy employee , be allowed to depart [LOC Libya  ] as soon as possible , in order to assist his ill wife in seeking medical care outside the country . 
( Note: [PER Ghennewa  ] was previously detained by the [ORG GOL  ] , and upon being released from prison , was told his name is on the no-fly list , and that he was barred from leaving the country . 
We have continuously advocated on his behalf with a range of senior-level interlocutors . 
End note ) . 
[PER Rammali  ] said he knew of the case , and was unsure if [PER Ghennewa  ] was [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000100 002 OF 002 still on the no-fly list , although " if he is , the [MISC Libyan  ] government has good reasons for it . 
" He pledged to look into it , and to give the Ambassador an answer when the [MISC PISCES  ] agreement is signed .
