( [ORG S  ] ) In a September 22 meeting , [MISC Iraqi  ] Prime Minister [PER Nouri al-Maliki  ] told the Ambassador that [LOC Iran  ] is intervening increasingly boldly in the [MISC Iraqi  ] political process in a bid to " control the [ORG COR  ] " ( the [ORG Council of Representatives  ] , the [ORG Iraqi Parliament  ] ) . 
[LOC Iran  ] has not discarded use of military means to attain its objectives , [PER Maliki  ] said , but for now it is focusing on political means . 
If [LOC Iran  ] does not succeed in influencing the upcoming [MISC Iraqi  ] national elections , [PER Maliki  ] said , he expects to see them return to military actions . 
[PER Maliki  ] said that the [MISC Iranian  ] initiative was thwarted -- dealt a " fatal blow " -- by [PER Dawa  ] 's refusal to join the [PER Shi  ] , a alliance being forged for the elections ( the [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] ) . 
[LOC Iran  ] , he said , is trying to rally the [MISC Shi'a  ] to counter the " [MISC Saudi  ] project " to align the [MISC Sunni  ] states . 
But if [PER Dawa  ] had joined the [MISC Shi'a  ] alliance , he said , that " could have led to sectarian strife . 
" <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Maliki  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] is using the [MISC Saudi  ] efforts as pretext to continue its intervention in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
On September 21 , for example , the [MISC Saudis  ] sponsored a meeting in [LOC Amman  ] at which at least ten senior [MISC Iraqi  ] Sunnis attended , including [ORG Rafi  ] al-Issawi . 
While in [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Maliki  ] said , he asked POTUS to intervene with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to ask them to stop their efforts at rallying the [MISC Sunni  ] , in part precisely to avoid inflaming sectarianism and to deny [LOC Iran  ] that pretext for similarly seeking to rally the [PER Shi  ] , a . 
[PER Maliki  ] 's concerns in this regard have not abated , he said . 
He chose not to press this issue again with VPOTUS during his September 18 visit to [LOC Baghdad  ] because he felt he had expressed his concerns once and it was not necessary to continue to raise the same issue. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to the [ORG Mujahedin  ] el [PER Khalkh  ] ( [ORG MEK  ] ) , the Ambassador urged [PER Maliki  ] not to take any provocative actions prior to the elections . 
[PER Maliki  ] took this point on board , but replied by asking what outcome the [ORG USG  ] sees , and how long this situation can go on . 
Ambassador stressed that a . 
) the situation " won't go on forever , " b . 
) the [ORG USG  ] has sent a " stern message " to the [ORG MEK  ] that they must deal directly with the [ORG GOI  ] , not the [ORG USG  ] , and c . 
) the [LOC U.S.  ] base near the [ORG MEK  ] camp will eventually be closing . 
The [ORG USG  ] has urged the [MISC Europeans  ] to take a similar stance , and is seeking greater [ORG United Nations  ] involvement in treating the [ORG MEK  ] as refugees . 
[PER Maliki  ] replied that the [ORG GOI  ] " has to do something " so that it can say it has started the process . 
Otherwise , he said , this issue will be used against him in the elections . 
In [PER Maliki  ] 's view , " whoever wants to return to their country can do so . 
" The rest , he said , should be relocated away from the [MISC Iranian  ] border , to protect them and [LOC Iraq  ] from [MISC Iranian  ] pressure . 
[LOC Iran  ] , [PER Maliki  ] said , at one time was even contemplating a long-range missile strike on the camp , and even today is considering filing a case against [LOC Iraq  ] for " harboring a terrorist organization . 
" The [ORG GOI  ] must try to relocate " at least 1,000 " members before the end of the year , [PER Maliki  ] said , returning to his theme that the [ORG GOI  ] must do something prior to the elections . 
Ambassador emphasized that any attempt to forcibly remove members could lead to bloodshed and crisis , and again urged [PER Maliki  ] not to do so . 
[PER Maliki  ] said he felt most members would willingly relocate . 
Only the leadership of the group objects , and they are " criminals . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Comment: [PER Maliki  ] , s comments regarding [MISC Iranian  ] Q4 . 
( S ) Comment: [PER Maliki  ] , s comments regarding [MISC Iranian  ] involvement in internal [MISC Iraqi  ] affairs are the strongest we have heard . 
The [PER Shi  ] , a alliance [ORG INA  ] is under considerable pressure from the [MISC Iranians  ] to persuade or even threaten [PER Maliki  ] , s [PER Dawa  ] party to join the alliance , but on terms unfavorable or unsatisfactory to either [PER Dawa  ] or [PER Maliki  ] . 
He anticipates that if he pursues his non-sectarian State of [LOC Law  ] alliance , he will encounter not only stiff resistance from the [ORG INA  ] but also heavy and active opposition from the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
Regarding [ORG MEK  ] , while it appears that the [ORG GOI  ] will not move immediately after [PER Ramadan  ] against the camp , s residents , the eventual transfer operation will likely occur before the end of the year . 
We will continue to advocate patience , direct [MISC GOI-MEK  ] negotiation for a peaceful transfer and involvement of an international organization .
