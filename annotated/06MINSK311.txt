( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: On March 20 , a defiant [PER Aleksandr Lukashenko  ] accepted his presidential “victory” at a press conference held in the cavernous [LOC Palace of the Republic  ] and spoke to a full audience , including practically the entire [MISC Belarusian  ] government , on live television . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] stressed [MISC Belarusians  ] had made “a just decision” and challenged foreign nations to recognize and accept that fact . 
He claimed the elections were democratic and stoutly refuted international criticisms , using the moment to lambaste the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC West  ] , and opposition while promoting his plans for the future . 
In a rare occasion , [PER Lukashenko  ] took questions from [MISC Western  ] and non-state owned press correspondents on live television . 
The often hardball questions only aggravated more bizarre answers from a clearly disturbed [PER Lukashenko  ] . 
End Summary. ---------------------------- [MISC Lukashenko’s  ] Opening Remarks ---------------------------- [MISC Belarusians  ] Made Their Choice , Other [MISC Countries Should Tend  ] to Their Own Problems --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In his March 20 speech at the [LOC Palace of the Republic  ] , President [PER Lukashenko  ] announced that the “revolution” that many had prepared for had failed . 
According to the President , [PER Belarusians  ] had made a wise decision . 
However , those [ opposition leaders ] who tried to go behind the backs of the people to get power “from the hands of foreign sponsors” are unable to accept this. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Lukashenko  ] said [MISC Belarusians  ] respected [MISC Americans  ] and citizens of [LOC Europe  ] , but that did not mean [PER Belarusians  ] would “alter” themselves to fit Washington’s , [LOC Brussels’  ] , and Warsaw’s standards . 
[PER Belarusians  ] do not need to be told how to live and would not become “servants” to stronger nations . 
The President opined that countries of the “so-called” color revolutions should first bring order to their own people and rid themselves of poverty and crime . 
He called color revolutions a “virus” that infects weak countries that have turned a deaf ear to the people and allowed corruption to flourish . 
[LOC Belarus  ] , however , has a strong social policy and a dynamic economy that is developing “for the people” and not for oligarchs . 
Elections Were [MISC Democratic  ] ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The President asserted that the March 19 presidential elections were democratic and conducted in strict accordance with [LOC Belarus’  ] constitution . 
[PER Belarusians  ] independently made their decision and showed the world that they are the “masters” of their home . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] called the elections an indisputable victory for the people’s spirit , satisfaction , and self-esteem , despite foreign and domestic interference that tried to “break” the [MISC Belarusians.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Lukashenko  ] stressed that foreign countries needed to respect Belarusians’ decision as the will of the people and a clear indicator of democracy . 
According to [PER Lukashenko  ] , the high turnout at the polls showed that [MISC Belarusians  ] feel a “deep and personal” responsibility for their government’s fate and the welfare of their people . 
The President lambasted the [LOC West  ] for its criticisms of early voting , claiming that the practice existed in “super democracies” such as the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Germany  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] ensured the necessary conditions for a fair democratic vote and allowed 1,200 international and 30,000 domestic observers and 1,000 journalists to monitor . 
Opposition Does Not Respect Its People -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Lukashenko  ] declared that [LOC Belarus  ] had never seen such unprecedented pressure and anti-Belarusian behavior as the opposition had presented . 
The President viewed it as the opposition’s high level of disrespect to its own people and failure to recognize their right to an independent election . 
However , the opposition’s actions Conference with the help of foreign pressure resulted in almost all [MISC Belarusians  ] supporting the regime in the “moment of truth.” The [ORG President’s New Mission  ] --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Lukashenko  ] said the election results showed Belarusians’ support for his approach to building a strong , developing country . 
He said his next mission was his five-year plan that would build a government for the people . 
The President stated that [LOC Belarus  ] is not as rich as the people would like , but it was just a question of time and labor before [MISC Belarusians  ] would attain or even exceed [MISC Western  ] European standards of living. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [LOC Belarus  ] will continue its peaceful policies and strengthen relations with its neighbors . 
He noted a union with [LOC Russia  ] is of high strategically importance to [LOC Belarus  ] , but stressed dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] was also important. ------------------------------------------- Journalists [PER Toss Lukashenko  ] Tough Questions ------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In a rare event , [MISC Belarusian  ] TV provided continuous live coverage of [MISC Lukashenko’s  ] press conference with western and independent journalists , as well as with state journalists . 
The western and independent journalists posed many tough , if not embarrassing questions to the President . 
However , the audience was overwhelmingly comprised of [ORG GOB  ] officials , state journalists , and pro-Lukashenko election monitors . 
All of [MISC Lukashenko’s  ] answers were greeted with broad applause . 
On Demonstrators ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Q ( Liberacion ) : You [ [PER Lukashenko  ] ] said on March 17 that you would wring the necks of opponents who would go to the streets . 
What happened to them and can you give them security guarantees ? 
A: To wring the necks ? 
I see your neck is all right , just as everyone else’s . 
[ Laughter from audience ] So do not be concerned . 
Q ( [PER RIA Novisti  ] ) : If you were sure of your victory and are confident it was democratic , why was it necessary to deport foreign observers and detain representatives of the opposition ? 
A: I do not know who was arrested or detained . 
The law is the law for everyone , and if someone violated the law , then they will be prosecuted . 
I know that a few people were detained , but they asked for it to save their face after realizing nothing would come of their actions . 
Q ( [ORG BBC News  ] ) : If so many people voted for you , why do you think thousands of people came to the streets to protest your victory ? 
A: This proves the democratic nature of our society . 
We have people who do not agree with the president’s policyQDid you see the people who came to the square yesterday ? 
Could you distinguish between the participants and bystanders ? [ The demonstrators ] are 14 and 15-year-olds who were paid [ORG BYR  ] 20,000 ( USD 10 ) to participate . 
They then blamed the authorities for the weather . 
You can see that [PER God  ] was with the [MISC Belarusian  ] people yesterday . 
A terrible snow blizzard was observed only on that square . 
On the Elections ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Q ( [ORG Associated Press  ] ) : What is your reaction to opposition leaders’ demands to hold a repeat election ? 
A: If they want to have a repeat vote , let them go and vote . 
There will be no reaction from my part . 
I only react to the results and the reaction voiced by the [ORG Central Election Commission  ] . 
Q ( GOB’s telegraph news Belta ) : It is evident the [LOC West  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] will not recognize the election . 
There are Conference lots of example of what happened to countries that attempted to oppose the [LOC White House  ] . 
Do you think [LOC Belarus  ] faces a threat of international isolation ? 
A: Judging by the words of [LOC U.S.  ] politicians and others that you mentioned , we have lived in international isolation for a long time alreadyQI wish we could continue our development at the same pace in this isolation . 
If they [ the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC West  ] ] respect [MISC Belarusians  ] , as they always say , they will change their policies . 
I am not afraid of any further isolation . 
I do not understand how one can isolate a country that is the heart of [LOC Europe  ] , through which 100 million tons of goods are shipped annually . 
Neither the [MISC Europeans  ] , [MISC Russians  ] , nor the [MISC Kazakhs  ] have ever experienced any problems hereQ.We will preserve the country like this at any cost . 
They will stage provocations every day and will [ claim ] to act in accordance with the Bible . 
We will show the absurdity of their policies being carried out in [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Latvia  ] , and [LOC Lithuania  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] Support --------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Journalist ( state newspaper [ORG Narodnaya Gazeta  ] ) : Mr. [PER Lukashenko  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] authorities have supported your candidacyQ [PER Lukashenko: Did  ] you hear this ? 
Where did you get this fact ? 
I am an official , so do not use rumors in public . 
Excuse me for interrupting you , but I will tell you and the [LOC West  ] that [PER Putin  ] is not backing [PER Lukashenko  ] . 
An analyst says that the [MISC Belarusian  ] economy is developing so successfully because we buy [MISC Russian  ] oil at friendly prices and sell it to the [LOC West  ] at international prices . 
I want you to know , and [MISC Euronews  ] above all , that we buy oil from [LOC Russia  ] at higher than world pricesQI do not need any support from [LOC Russia  ] , though I am confident I would receive it if I asked . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] Is An Emancipator ---------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Q ( Interfax ) : Thanks to your election rivals , this country has learned interesting things about your private life and sons . 
Are you going to charge these individuals for libel ? 
And , basically , will [MISC Milinkevich  ] and [MISC Kozulin  ] be sent to prison ? 
A: I would hate to see anyone sent to prison , but believe me , I do not send people to prison . 
Under the constitution , I release people , and as any other president I have the power to pardon peopleQif they are guilty , they will be sent to prison . 
As far as I am concerned , they will not be sent to prison for personal reasons . 
I will oppose this and will ask law- enforcement agencies not to touch them . 
Let [PER God  ] go with them , as it is all coming to themQI do not think the public has learned too many things about my private life . 
What they said is horrible...they were destroying my image with the help of spin-doctors . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] Gets Cheeky With [MISC Ukrainian  ] Journalist --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) Journalist ( [PER Antena  ] TV , [LOC Ukraine  ] ) : Several events have happened over the last few weeks here that were viewed as scandalous . 
Some of our politicians were not allowed into [LOC Belarus  ] and some of my colleagues were barred from entering this conference . 
My colleague was arrested when reporting live at an opposition rallyQ [PER Lukashenko:  ] During a live broadcast ? 
Journalist: She was reporting by phone [PER Lukashenko:  ] You need only this . 
This is good when you are detained reporting live . 
Your television does not need better facts . 
Journalist: May I finish [ the question ] ? 
[PER Lukashenko:  ] As you wish . 
You are the master . 
You can finish if you want . 
Journalist: Sometimes you speak about [LOC Ukraine  ] in a slightly negative contextQ [PER Lukashenko: No  ] , no , excuse me . 
You did not allow me to finish . 
I respect my opposition because they found my Conference [MISC Ukrainian  ] roots . 
[ Passage omitted: [PER Lukashenko  ] recalls working with [MISC Ukrainians  ] on a collective farm and claims [LOC Belarus  ] supports [MISC Ukrainian  ] farmers during the harvesting campaign . 
] Probably , she was not arrested but detained , because it is not so easy to arrest a person . 
She was probably doing something wrong . 
So when in this country , you should abide by this country’s laws . 
Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The setting of [MISC Lukashenko’s  ] press conference showed a leader far removed from the people . 
He sat at a large desk , flanked by two large flags centered high on a large stage , isolated from the packed auditorium . 
His curt answers to [MISC Western  ] journalists and scolding of [MISC Belarusian  ] correspondents only helped to show the world his bizarre behavior , yet he still received healthy applause from his well-chosen audience and foreign lackeys Q including [MISC American  ] citizen [PER Michael Margulis  ] , whom [PER Lukashenko  ] repeatedly mentioned during his remarks as representing the real [MISC American  ] people. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The press conference rivaled his firebrand speech at the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] used this rare moment with [MISC Western  ] journalists to criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] and accuse it , along with the rest of the [LOC West  ] , of murdering [PER Slobodan Milosivic  ] and unjustly removing [PER Saddaam Hussein  ] . 
At one disturbing moment , [PER Lukashenko  ] told a journalist she was jumping to conclusions when thinking that his third term as President would be his last . 
This clearly demonstrated a defiant [PER Lukashenko  ] intends to stay in power indefinitely and sees no reason to change his course .
