( C ) [MISC Summary: At  ] a dinner hosted by [ORG PGR  ] for a visiting DOJ delegation , [ORG National Security Coordinator Tello Peon  ] and Undersecretary for [ORG Governance Gutierrez Fernandez  ] told the delegation they would like to explore seriously focusing our joint efforts on two or three key cities to reverse the current wave of violence and instability and show success in the fight against the [ORG DTOs  ] in the next 18 months . 
They suggested starting in [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] , [LOC Tijuana  ] , and one other city with a joint planning cell to review what resources we could collectively bring to bear . 
They believe the symbolism of turning several of the most violent cities would be potent , sending a signal to the rest of the country that the fight against organized crime can be won , and combating the current sense of impotence felt by many [MISC Mexicans  ] . 
They believe it would also go a long way toward stitching up the country , s damaged international reputation . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Acting Attorney General [PER Alcantara  ] hosted a dinner for Deputy Attorney General for the [ORG Criminal Division  ] [PER Lanny Breuer September  ] 21 in [LOC Mexico City  ] . 
Other attendees included: [ORG GOM National Security System Coordinator Jorge Tello Peon  ] Undersecretary for [ORG Governance  ] ( [ORG SEGOB  ] ) [PER Geronimo Gutierrez Fernandez  ] [ORG PGR  ] DAG ( SIEDO ) [PER Marisela Morales  ] [ORG PGR  ] DAG [PER Victor Emilio Corzo Cabanas PGR  ] Director for Analysis and [ORG Strategic Information  ] [PER Oscar Rocha  ] Dobrowski US Deputy Assistant AG [PER Bruce Swartz Deputy Assistant  ] AG for [ORG Criminal Division  ] Kenneth [ORG Blanco Special Assistant  ] to the AG [PER Paul Rosen  ] DOJ Attache [PER Tony Garcia NAS Director  ] [PER Keith Mines  ] GOM WANTS FULL TRANSFER OF INTEL TECHNOLOGY AND TRAINING --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Alcantara  ] opened the meeting with two requests from [PER Oscar Rocha  ] . 
First , he said [ORG PGR  ] would like to develop a more general exchange of intelligence information and capacity , not the case-by-case exchange we now have . 
Second , they would like for us to provide a full exchange of technology for use in intelligence gathering , not just the loan of equipment for specific cases , but the transfer of the know-how and training as well . 
[PER Morales  ] added that the [ORG FBI  ] is helping to create a cyber-unit in [LOC Mexico  ] but it would be beneficial if it were expanded and replicated more broadly . 
The [ORG SSP  ] , she said , already has a cyber-unit but the real mandate rests with [MISC PGR-SIEDO  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side offered that there is great capacity in [LOC CCIPS  ] in the [ORG Criminal Division  ] and they would be happy to find ways to offer training and capacity building to their [MISC Mexican  ] counterparts . 
We would be pleased , [PER Breuer  ] said , in the effort to press High Value Targets , to get our [MISC Mexican  ] counterparts to the point where they can do these things themselves . 
It will take the development of strong trust through proper vetting and good training but it would be excellent to get to the point where there is no longer impunity for a [ORG Chapo Guzman  ] because his operating space has been eliminated. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Rocha  ] then spoke of the technological leap about to take place in the coming years in the intelligence field . 
He cited the target-finding equipment used by the [ORG USMS  ] with [MISC Mexican  ] counterparts but asked if it would be possible to acquire not only such equipment for [ORG GOM  ] officials , but also the training and full technology transfer that would go with it . 
He suggested we work with vetted units first to provide such equipment and training , and then move it out more broadly , both to [ORG PGR  ] and [ORG CISEN  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side suggested getting together in the appropriate working group to see what could be done . 
[PER Rocha  ] reiterated that his intent would be to develop indigenous to the [ORG PGR  ] all the capacity they currently have only in conjunction with the [ORG USMS  ] . 
STRATEGIC MISCALCULATIONS IN [ORG MERIDA  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gutierrez Fernandez  ] then turned to the [ORG Merida Initiative  ] , saying that in retrospect he and other [ORG GOM  ] officials realize that not enough strategic thought went into [LOC Merida  ] in the early phase . 
There was too much emphasis in the initial planning on equipment , which they now know is slow to arrive and even slower to be of direct utility in the fight against the [ORG DTOs  ] . 
Of more immediate importance is building institutions that can effectively use the equipment . 
He was careful to point out that all the equipment is needed and will be put to good use , but wishes that there had been a more direct focus on institution building , and supported the current shift in [LOC Merida  ] focus to capacity building and creating more effective institutions . 
" WE HAVE EIGHTEEN MONTHS " ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gutierrez  ] went on to say , however , that he now realizes there is not even time for the institution building to take hold in the remaining years of the [PER Calderon  ] administration . 
" We have 18 months , " he said , " and if we do not produce a tangible success that is recognizable to the [MISC Mexican  ] people , it will be difficult to sustain the confrontation into the next administration . 
" He lamented the pervasive , debilitating fear that is so much a part of contemporary [MISC Mexican  ] society , where even people in the [LOC Yucatan  ] , with " [MISC European  ] levels of security " are afraid because of the instability in a few distant cities . 
He expressed a real concern with " losing " certain regions . 
It is damaging [LOC Mexico  ] 's international reputation , hurting foreign investment , and leading to a sense of government impotence , [PER Gutierrez  ] said . 
DON , T SHY AWAY FROM THE HARDEST CHALLENGES ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Gutierrez  ] believes what is needed is a clear roadmap for the remaining years of security cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] under President [PER Calderon  ] that targets a few joint projects in a few cities , rather than doing a little of everything . 
[PER Tello Peon  ] agreed , suggesting that there is not time for pilot projects , and certainly not time to work in a few relatively safe cities such as [LOC Nuevo Laredo  ] as has been suggested , in order to develop the experience to take on the real challenges. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Instead , he believes , we need to confront the cities with the largest insecurity and fix them . 
If we could turn around [LOC Tijuana  ] , [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] , and one other city such as [LOC Culiacan  ] , it would solve 60% of the violence , and send a signal to the [MISC Mexican  ] people that the war can be won . 
Politically , he and [PER Gutierrez  ] said , [LOC Mexico  ] must succeed in [LOC Juarez  ] because [PER Calderon  ] has staked so much of his reputation there , with a major show of force that , to date , has not panned out . 
Even if it is not completely solved by the time [PER Calderon  ] leaves office , if they can get things moving in the right direction , setting the conditions for ultimate success , it will be enough . 
There was a brief &chicken and egg8 discussion , with one side suggesting that well-placed and effective federal forces could push back the [ORG DTOs  ] sufficiently for the state and local forces to function , while others believed that well-functioning state and local forces will be a precondition for the federal forces to produce stability . 
MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER ----------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Gutierrez  ] thought that to start we need a good joint assessment of organized criminal groups that makes explicit their vulnerabilities . 
We have , he said , five things to put into the fight: resources , training , joint operations , technology , and cooperation , and we need to mobilize effectively all of them . 
He especially mentioned the need to synchronize our joint efforts , citing the recent show of force the [LOC U.S.  ] promised on our side of the border that could not be matched by anything on the [MISC Mexican  ] side , leaving it hollow . 
[PER Tello Peon  ] suggested we form a planning cell , a few experts on each side , who could focus on a few programs in a few places for the next 2 years. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In addition to the intelligence and operational cooperation that would be at the heart of the new approach , [PER Gutierrez  ] and [PER Tello Peon  ] mentioned the importance of cultural and political factors . 
Politically , [LOC Mexico  ] may have a federal system , [PER Gutierrez  ] said , but historically it has been more centralized like [LOC Colombia  ] or [LOC France  ] . 
The federal government , however , no longer has the ability to manage the system from top to bottom . 
He suggested it would be necessary for success to break through the impasse produced by [LOC Mexico  ] , s currently dysfunctional federal system and ensure programs can be synchronized with the states . 
[PER Tello Peon  ] also said there will be a need to work on the cultural factors required to produce a &culture of lawfulness8 that would mobilize the societal support necessary for success . 
Culture and politics will be very complex , he said , but can be made to work . 
A clearly articulated and strong doctrine will help get people behind the strategy. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Tello Peon  ] ended the discussion by saying he arrived at the dinner somewhat fatigued but would leave energized . 
He thought it was an excellent mix of people and welcomed the honest exchange of new ideas . 
[LOC Mexico  ] , he summarized , is committed to staying the course , which is sustainable with a few clear successes. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment: We will follow up with [PER Tello Peon  ] and [PER Gutierrez  ] in the coming weeks to see how committed the [ORG GOM  ] is to the strategy of selecting a few key cities and working to turn security . 
If it is their strategy and they plan to execute it , we should get behind it , using the new strategic framework to build a regional program to take on the biggest challenges in key border cities . 
A considerable amount could be done with existing funding and a marginal increase in staffing . 
We would use the remainder of the calendar year for planning , and have a new series of programs ready to roll out in the new year .
