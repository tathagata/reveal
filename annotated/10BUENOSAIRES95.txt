( C ) The [ORG GoA  ] issued a decree on February 16 requiring ships to obtain [ORG GoA  ] permission before sailing from [LOC Argentina  ] or through [MISC Argentine  ] waters to reach the [LOC Falkland/Malvinas Islands  ] . 
[MISC Argentine  ] President [PER Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] sought to justify the decree based on [ORG UN  ] resolutions . 
The decree is intended to discourage oil exploration in territorial waters of the islands . 
[MISC British  ] diplomats in [LOC Argentina  ] are seeking to calm the waters , but note that [LOC Argentina  ] has sent warning letters to companies currently involved in such exploration . 
They think that there is a real possibility that the [ORG GoA  ] might place sanctions against these companies , even if [MISC Argentine  ] economic interests might be harmed in the process . 
While it is unclear to what extent [LOC U.S.  ] companies may be affected , one target may be [LOC U.S.  ] tour operators for [ORG Southern Cone and Antarctica  ] cruises that include a stop at the islands . 
The [MISC British  ] strategy is to let [ORG CFK  ] score political points now and wait for the issue to fade away as the public debate shifts to more pressing domestic issues . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Argentina  ] Requires Ships to Request Permission to Travel to [ORG Falklands/Malvinas  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 16 , Cabinet Chief [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] announced that President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) had that day signed a new decree ( Executive Order equivalent ) requiring ships to obtain [ORG GoA  ] permission to sail from [LOC Argentina  ] or through [MISC Argentine  ] waters to the [ORG Falklands/Malvinas  ] and other [MISC South Atlantic  ] islands claimed by [LOC Argentina  ] , or before loading cargo destined for them . 
According to a [ORG GoA  ] press release , it " establishes the requirement for ( [ORG GoA  ] ) permission to navigate between the [MISC Argentine  ] continental territory and the [LOC Malvinas  ] , [LOC South Georgia  ] and [LOC South Sandwich Islands  ] . 
" [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] will head a commission ( which will include representatives from the [ORG Ministries of Foreign Affairs  ] , Planning , Industry and Tourism , Economy and Justice ) to oversee implementation of the decree. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At a public event later in the day , [ORG CFK  ] explained that " all ships that are headed to [LOC Puerto Argentino  ] ( i.e. , [ORG Port Stanley  ] ) must request authorization from [LOC Argentina  ] , whatever their reason for going . 
" She justified this new requirement , arguing that " there are numerous [ORG UN  ] resolutions which request and require both countries ( i.e. , [LOC Argentina  ] and the [LOC U.K  ] . 
) to renew talks to reach an agreement on sovereignty ( of the islands ) , and resolutions which say that neither party can take unilateral actions . 
" She added that " these resolutions have been systematically ignored by the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , which refuses to discuss the matter , " and that " the [LOC U.K.  ] refuses to sit at the table to discuss it as the [ORG UN  ] orders . 
" She stated that she would raise the issue at the [ORG Rio Group  ] summit meeting to be held next week in [LOC Playa del Carmen  ] , [ORG MC  ] ) xico . 
The Reason: To Raise the Cost of Doing Business in the [MISC Islands  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Numerous press reports cited anonymous government sources with more detailed justifications and explanations of intent . 
Leading daily [PER Clarin  ] 's source stated that " The ships that go ( to the [MISC Falklands  ] to support oil drilling ) should know that they won't get any assistance in [MISC Argentine  ] ports . 
" Pro-government daily [ORG Pagina  ] 12 's source in the [ORG MFA  ] went further , claiming that the goal was " to make the exploration process more expensive " and thus discourage firms from operating there . 
Foreign Minister [PER Taiana  ] , in a closed-door session with CFK-aligned congressmen , reportedly repeated that last argument , while also expressing the hope that companies would choose instead to conduct similar activities in nearby ( undisputed ) [MISC Argentine  ] waters . 
Another [ORG MFA  ] source told pro-government [ORG Pagina  ] 12 that " last Friday , the [ORG Financial Times  ] reported that stock prices ( of [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] , the [MISC British  ] company leading the exploration efforts ) were falling . 
That is what our sanctions aim for , always through peaceful and legal means , so that the risk factor that every petroleum company ( operating in the [MISC Islands  ] ) faces is increasingly higher . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While the decree has yet to be published in its entirety , the [ORG GoA  ] may have already begun to enforce it . 
A British-flagged ship , the " [LOC Thor Leader  ] , " was detained in a port north of [LOC Buenos Aires  ] on February 11 ( it arrived at the port February 4 ) based on allegations that it had delivered equipment related to the oil exploration activity to [ORG Port Stanley  ] prior to stopping in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
( Initial reports quoted [ORG GoA  ] sources accusing [MISC Argentine  ] oil tubing manufacturer [ORG Techint  ] of shipping its goods to the [MISC Islands on board  ] the [LOC Thor Leader  ] . 
The company quickly denied those claims , stating that the goods to be loaded on the ship were destined for various customers in the [MISC Mediterranean  ] . 
The accusations against [ORG Techint  ] have not been repeated in the past few days , but the ship remains detained . 
) Local press cited the [ORG Financial Times  ] as the source for the information that the ship was owned by [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] , and attributed the drop in [ORG Desire  ] 's stock price to the detention . 
However , other press reports state that the justification for the detention was a resolution issued in 2007 ( see Ref B ) which threatens to shut down the [MISC Argentine  ] operations of any oil company that operates in the [MISC Falklands  ] without [ORG GoA  ] permission . 
[LOC UK  ] Expects Continued [MISC GoA Moves  ] to [ORG Discourage Oil & Gas Exploration  ] Off [MISC Falklands  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC British  ] diplomats in [LOC Argentina  ] are concerned about how far the [ORG GoA  ] will take this matter , and are therefore seeking to downplay the situation as much as possible . 
[MISC British  ] Ambassador [PER Shan Morgan  ] told [ORG DCM  ] February 16 that the [MISC British  ] strategy is to be quiet and patient in the hope that the situation blows over , but adding that [LOC London  ] was " jumpy " over the issue . 
A [MISC British  ] Embassy source quoted by multiple dailies has followed that tack , stating that " [LOC Argentina  ] applies its own laws in its own territory , " suggesting that this regulation was strictly a domestic [MISC Argentine  ] issue . 
( Several newspapers said that the quote was in response to a question about the British-flagged [LOC Thor Leader  ] , suggesting that the [LOC UK  ] is not making the detention a bilateral issue . 
) However , the source is quoted as adding that " The [LOC U.K.  ] has no doubt over its sovereignty in the [MISC Falklands  ] and its maritime waters , and is convinced that the petroleum exploration is a completely legitimate activity . 
" [PER Morgan  ] noted her belief that the Kirchners were fanning the flames in an effort to score political points domestically , a point underscored in the [MISC Argentine  ] press as well. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC British  ] [ORG DCM  ] [PER Simon Thomas  ] told [ORG EconCouns  ] on February 11 that the [ORG GoA  ] had , as widely reported in the press , formally delivered to him ( as ChargC ) d'Affaires ) on February 2 a protest over hydrocarbons exploration activity in the [LOC Falklands/Malvinas Islands  ] territorial waters that was expected to begin in mid-to-late February . 
He downplayed the protest , calling it similar to many their mission has received previously . 
[PER Thomas  ] was surprised to learn that the [ORG USG  ] had not yet received any similar protest , despite the fact that the drilling rig contracted by [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] to do the drilling in the [MISC Falklands/Malvinas  ] is owned and operated by a major [LOC U.S.  ] drilling firm , [ORG Diamond Offshore Drilling  ] . 
( [MISC British  ] Ambassador [PER Morgan  ] also raised this point with [ORG DCM  ] , saying she has been told by [LOC London  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] companies had been warned by the [ORG GoA  ] to not participate in the project . 
She asked us to confirm that the [ORG USG  ] is not/not aware of such approaches , either to [LOC U.S.  ] companies or to the [ORG USG  ] itself . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC British  ] diplomats also told [ORG EconCouns  ] that several companies involved in the planned exploration had received warning letters from the [ORG GoA  ] threatening to cancel ( or prevent ) their operations in [LOC Argentina  ] if they participate in the [MISC Falklands/Malvinas  ] exploration without [ORG GoA  ] permission . 
In addition to [ORG Desire Petroleum  ] , these include [MISC Danish  ] shipping giant [ORG Maersk  ] , which is towing the rig to the planned drilling site . 
The [MISC British  ] believe that the intent of the letters is to pressure companies into dropping all Falklands-related activity ; they did not rule out [ORG GoA  ] sanctions against these companies for continuing Falkland-related activities , even if such action would also damage the [MISC Argentine  ] economy . 
[ORG Maersk  ] , in particular , handles approximately 20% of [LOC Argentina  ] 's foreign shipping , including an estimated 50% of [LOC Argentina  ] 's soy exports , the country 's top export commodity and a critically important source of export tax revenues for the [MISC GoA.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There have also been press reports claiming that British-owned [ORG Barclay  ] 's [ORG Bank ,  ] the lead bank working on behalf of the [ORG GoA  ] on the proposed debt restructuring agreement to resolve the problem of the " holdouts " from the earlier 2005 debt swap ( Ref A ) , is the single largest shareholder in [ORG Desire  ] , with about 4.5% of the shares . 
[ORG Barclay  ] 's is also said to own an interest in [LOC Minera  ] Alumbrera , a large copper and gold mining firm , which was [LOC Argentina  ] 's 10th-largest exporter in 2009 . 
Post has not yet been able to verify either claim . 
In light of [ORG Barclay  ] 's ownership position in Desire , a former [MISC Argentine  ] congressman has filed a lawsuit seeking to force the [ORG GoA  ] to end [ORG Barclay  ] 's participation in the debt restructuring . 
[MISC Australian  ] company [ORG BHP Billiton  ] was also identified in the press as a firm with interests in both the [MISC Falklands/Malvinas  ] exploration and mining in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
Comment <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) While the [ORG GoA  ] seeks to prevent companies from participating in oil exploration activity in the waters off of the [MISC Falklands/Malvinas  ] , it is not clear how much it is willing to risk real harm to the [MISC Argentine  ] economy as it exploits a nationalistic issue for political gain . 
For now , the [ORG GoA  ] is being scrupulous to couch its actions in terms of adherence to [ORG UN  ] resolutions and international law . 
In the absence of an ( unlikely ) [MISC British-Argentine  ] accord on the [LOC Islands  ] , the [ORG GoA  ] will , in all probability , continue to ratchet up economic pressure on [LOC Falkland Islands  ] residents , for whom tourism is an important cash generator . 
An aggressive position on the issue unites [MISC Argentines  ] behind their unpopular government , and there is still a long way to go before the steps contemplated by the [ORG GoA  ] cause any real damage to the [MISC Argentine  ] economy . 
Current ship traffic between [LOC Argentina  ] and the [MISC Falklands  ] ( as well as the other islands ) is limited , and the impact of the decree on [LOC U.S.  ] and other companies will likely also be limited for now . 
However , this could change if the [ORG GoA  ] ups the ante and imposes significant sanctions on companies such as tour cruise ship operators with current activities in both the [MISC Falklands  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] , harming both the companies and the [MISC Argentine  ] economy .
