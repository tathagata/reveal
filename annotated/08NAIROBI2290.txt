[ORG USDAO NAIROBI IIR  ] 6 854 0026 08 091427Z NOV 07 Classified By: [PER PolOff Rachael Doherty  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S-NF  ] ) A shipment of 33 [MISC Ukrainian  ] T-72 tanks and other ammunition and equipment aboard the M/V [PER Faina  ] , currently under the control of pirates off the coast of [LOC Somalia  ] , has raised questions and controversy in [LOC Kenya  ] about their final destination . 
It is a poorly kept secret that the tanks are bound for the [ORG Government of South Sudan  ] -- and that the [ORG Government of Kenya  ] has been facilitating shipments from [LOC Ukraine  ] to the [ORG Government of South Sudan  ] since 2007 . 
Since the world 's eyes are now on the M/V [PER Faina  ] , it is unlikely that the tanks , if released , would go immediately to their intended destination . 
Instead , they are likely to sit in a [MISC Kenyan  ] military depot until the world 's attention shifts elsewhere . 
In the meantime , the [MISC Kenyan  ] military is in an uncomfortable spot . 
End [LOC Summary.  ] --------------------- [LOC Kenya  ] Claims T-72s... --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The hijacking of the [MISC Ukrainian-owned  ] , Belize-flagged merchant vessel ( M/V ) [PER Faina  ] -- and subsequent confimation by the government of [LOC Ukraine  ] that there are 33 T-72 tanks and other ammunition and equipment onboard -- has raised questions about the cargo 's ultimate destination . 
In a move likely aimed at stemming controversy , the [ORG Government of Kenya  ] has claimed that the ultimate destination for the shipment is the [ORG Kenyan Armed Forces  ] . 
It is a poorly-kept secret , however , that the shipment was originally bound for [LOC South Sudan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S-NF  ] ) The contradictions have already been highlighted in the press . 
[MISC Kenyan  ] Government spokesman [PER Alfred Mutua  ] and [MISC Kenyan  ] [ORG Defense  ] spokesman [PER Bogita Ongeri  ] have both insisted that the tanks belong to [LOC Kenya  ] . 
[ORG East Africa Seafarers' Assistance Program  ] spokesman [PER Andrew Mwangura  ] told a different story: that the shipment ultimately was bound for the [ORG Government of South Sudan  ] . 
( [PER Note: Intelligence  ] reporting ( refs [MISC A-C  ] ) confirms [PER Mwangura  ] 's story -- not the official [ORG GOK  ] stance . 
After reporting that he was warned by [MISC Kenyan  ] government officials to stop talking about the shipment , [PER Mwangura  ] was arrested on October 1 .

( C ) MFA Director of Political Affairs Ambassador [PER Ben Ogutu  ] maintained the party line to [PER PolOff  ] on September 30 , but expressed relief that the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] has the lead on the issue . 
" e are just repeating the information that the [ORG Ministry has  ] provided to us , " [PER Ogutu  ] said . 
( Note: [PER Ogutu  ] also expressed great interest in what [LOC U.S.  ] officials in [LOC Washington  ] would say about the arms' ultimate destination . 
End Note . 
) -------------------------------- ...Although They Were [MISC Juba-Bound  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S-NF  ] ) Since last year , [LOC Kenya  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] has indeed played a major role in assisting the [ORG Government of South Sudan  ] receive arms shipments from the [ORG Government of Ukraine  ] . 
When the shipments are off-loaded at the port of [LOC Mombasa  ] , they are transported via rail to [LOC Uganda  ] and then onward to [LOC Southern Sudan  ] ( ref C ) . 
Military officials have expressed discomfort with this arrangement , however , and have made it clear to us that the orders come " from the top . 
" ( i.e. , President [PER Kibaki  ] ) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S-NF  ] ) Given the extensive local and international media attention , it is unlikely that the shipment will go directly to [LOC Sudan  ] should the cargo be offloaded in [LOC Mombasa  ] as originally planned . 
A high-level military official has indicated to us that if received , the cargo will be offloaded and delivered to a military depot in [LOC Kenya  ] , where it will likely sit for a few months before risking the overland shipment to [LOC Sudan.  ] ------------------ [LOC NAIROBI  ] 00002290 002 OF 002 Not the [MISC First Time  ] ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S-NF  ] ) This is not the first time a T-72 shipment to [LOC South Sudan  ] has been publicly diverted . 
In mid-February , the [ORG Government of Kenya  ] was reported as " seizing " a shipment of tanks bound for the [ORG Sudan People 's Liberation Army  ] as it violated the 2003 [MISC Comprehensive Peace Agreement  ] to end [LOC Sudan  ] 's civil war . 
The " seizure " occurred when [LOC Kenya  ] 's own security situation was still precarious given the post-election crisis . 
The tanks were ultimately released and proceeded to [LOC Sudan  ] , and the cargo currently aboard the M/V [PER Faina  ] was meant to complete the tank sale . 
( Note: Although there is no arms embargo against [LOC Southern Sudan  ] , the [ORG CPA  ] does say that the parties " agree in principle to proportional downsizing of the forces on both sides " following the cease fire . 
The [ORG CPA  ] permits the resupply of lethal military items on approval by the [ORG Joint Defense Board  ] and [ORG UN  ] mission .

) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: While [LOC Kenya  ] does see itself as a guarantor of the 2003 [MISC Comprehensive Peace Agreement  ] , which was signed in [LOC Nairobi  ] , the highest levels of government have nevertheless allowed previous arms shipments to proceed . 
[LOC Kenya  ] 's political leadership has thereby put the [MISC Kenyan  ] military in a in an uncomfortable spot . 
Some [MISC Kenyan  ] military officials have been questioning whether [LOC Kenya  ] should be facilitating arms deliveries since well before the M/V [PER Faina  ] made headlines. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment , cont: While no one is talking about why [LOC Kenya  ] is in this position , we can think of a few reasons . 
First , it is possible that [LOC Kenya  ] 's political leadership wants to support the [ORG Government of South Sudan  ] but not in a way that will openly provoke [LOC Khartoum  ] or potentially threaten [LOC South Sudan  ] 's eventual independence . 
Vice President [PER Musyoka  ] 's public opposition to the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] 's indictment of President [PER Bashir  ] ( because it could threaten the [ORG CPA  ] ) illustrates this point . 
Second , the government appears genuinely sensitive to charges that major arms shipments would be in violation of the spirit of the [ORG CPA  ] . 
Third , given [LOC Kenya  ] 's track record on corruption , it is always possible that there is a financial benefit for a senior [MISC Kenyan  ] official ( or two , or more ) in return for facilitating the arms shipments . 
As such , the question of " Who owns the tanks ? 
" will remain a touchy side issue for [LOC Kenya  ] in the piracy of the M/V [PER Faina  ] .
