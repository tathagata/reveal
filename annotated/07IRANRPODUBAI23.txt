He acknowledged reformists’ limited ability to impact policy but called the threats of impeachment a powerful tool .

End summary . 
2 . 
( S ) On April 11 , IRPOffs met with a member of the [ORG Majles  ] [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The [ORG MP  ] shared his opinions about the state of internal politics in [LOC Iran  ] and commented on international crises related to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] He claims ongoing communication with [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] leaders , including former President [PER Khatami  ] . 
[ORG Supreme Leader:  ] [MISC Islamic  ] interests over national --------------------------------------------- -- 3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG MP  ] believes that [ORG Supreme Leader  ] [PER Khamenei  ] aspires to become the “emperor” of the [MISC Islamic  ] world and is willing to sacrifice [MISC Iranian  ] national interests for this goal . 
He sees President [PER Ahmadi-Nejad  ] as merely a puppet of the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] , under the leader’s complete control . 
[PER Ahmadi-Nejad  ] , in turn , sees more pragmatic conservatives such as [ORG Larijani  ] and [PER Qalibaf  ] as his main rivals . 
The [ORG MP  ] claimed the president is not worried about reformists . 
4 . 
( S ) Speaking about [MISC Iran-US  ] tensions , the [ORG MP  ] opined that some conservatives in [LOC Iran  ] want to go to war for the following reasons ( Note: views shared by some other contacts . 
Endnote ) : -- to crack down on reformists and further resist change ; -- to appear strong and capable to the [MISC Iranian  ] public , as defenders of the nation ; -- to hide government failures . 
Threats of impeachment: the reformist weapon of choice --------------------------------------------- --------- 5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG MP  ] claimed that after the December 15 elections , hardliners attempted to take away the seat won in the [LOC Tehran  ] [ORG Majles  ] by-election by female reformist [PER Soheila Jelodarzadeh  ] . 
( Note: this is the first time [ORG IRPO  ] has heard this claim . 
Endnote ) The [ORG MP  ] said that reformists united and threatened to impeach the interior minister , and [PER Ms. Jelodarzadeh  ] kept her seat . 
6 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG MP  ] mentioned other past efforts to impeach administration officials , including the president , noting they had failed to gather enough support . 
He said , however , if there is another [ORG UNSC  ] resolution against [LOC Iran  ] following [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , reform groups are determined to impeach Foreign Minister [PER Mottaki  ] , and ultimately President [PER Ahmadi-Nejad  ] . 
The [ORG MP  ] indicated they were more likely to be able to gather the votes needed to impeach [PER Mottaki  ] than [PER Ahmadi-Nejad  ] , but he said they were determined to make an effort . 
The [ORG MP  ] praised the passage of [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions 1737 and 1747 as effective diplomacy and specifically praised the efforts and rhetoric of Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] . 
7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG MP  ] said the [ORG Mosharekat  ] reformist coalition has the eventual goal of changing the constitution to eliminate or change the position of the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] to an elected office with accountability . 
He noted , however , that some reformists , such as former [ORG Majles  ] speaker [PER Karroubi  ] , are opposed to amending the constitution . 
The [ORG MP  ] claimed that [PER Karroubi  ] , former president [PER Khatami  ] , and even [ORG Expediency Council  ] chair [PER Rafsanjani  ] cannot criticize the government as much as they might want to , because they would be marginalized . 
[ORG IRGC  ] ---- 8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG MP  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] press has reported very few details about the identities of the five [MISC Iranians  ] detained by RPO [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000023 002.2 OF 002 the [LOC US  ] in [LOC Irbil  ] , which he saw as a strong indication the men are military , not diplomats as the [MISC Iranian  ] government claims . 
Separately , he claimed that according to [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] members of the [ORG IRGC  ] do not necessarily support [PER Ahmadi-Nejad  ] . 
They must , however , follow the dictates of the [ORG Supreme Leader  ] . 
9 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG MP  ] claimed the government is very concerned about the whereabouts of former deputy Defense Minister [PER Ali Reza Asgari  ] , who reportedly went missing in [LOC Turkey  ] in February 2007 . 
According to the [ORG MP  ] , [PER Asgari  ] has the rank of [ORG IRGC  ] commander and is a key [ORG IRGC  ] insider with access to a great deal of sensitive information . 
As the government is uncertain whether he defected or was abducted , it does not know whether to attack him as a traitor and a liar or defend him as a captured hero . 
The [LOC UK  ] sailor crisis -------------------- 10 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Regarding the government’s detention of 15 [MISC British  ] sailors , the [ORG MP  ] opined that the government had planned the incident as a diversion from [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , which was eliciting public criticism of the government’s handling of the nuclear issue . 
Citing a widely repeated rumor that the [LOC UK  ] has cQl and influence over the clerical government ( “everybody knows the mullahs usually obey [MISC England”  ] ) , the [ORG MP  ] doubted that the sailor crisis would not have escalated beyond diplomacy , calling it simply a political stunt . 
[ORG VOA  ] broadcasts too anti-Iran ? ----------------------------- 11 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG MP  ] believed that the underlying theme of [ORG Voice of America  ] ( [ORG VOA  ] ) broadcasts was regime change for [LOC Iran  ] in all but name , which he said undermines USG claims that its policy towards [LOC Iran  ] is changed behavior , not regime change . 
He argued that predominantly negative coverage of [LOC Iran  ] is counter-productive , alienating viewers . 
In order to educate the people and work toward the goal of democracy promotion in [LOC Iran  ] , he recommended that the [ORG VOA  ] report facts and objective information , with the goal of creating a better-informed [MISC Iranian  ] public . 
12 . 
( C ) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX is an outspoken [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] While it is doubtful he has much direct contact with members of government , his comments about the political state of play in [LOC Iran  ] are valuable coming from inside the system . 
He acknowledges that the reformists in the [ORG Majles  ] have little ability to directly effect policy changes but claims the threat of impeachment has weight . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment continued: Although the [ORG MP  ] did not specifically mention the recently aired [ORG VOA  ] interview with [PER Abdul-Malek Rigi  ] , the leader of the violent [MISC Baluchi  ] separatist group [ORG Jundallah  ] with his criticisms of [ORG VOA  ] programming , that interview in particular was widely condemned in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Jundallah  ] claimed responsibility for February terrorist attacks in Iran’s southeastern [LOC Sistan-va-Baluchestan  ] province that killed 11 and injured 31 . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] spokesman released a statement about the [PER Rigi  ] interview , saying “the aforementioned terrorist is under prosecution for drug smuggling , kidnapping , murder , and injuring some of our compatriots , so what [ORG VOA  ] has done is in direction of double standards of the [LOC US  ] government in fighting against terrorism.” [ORG BURNS</pre></code>  ]
