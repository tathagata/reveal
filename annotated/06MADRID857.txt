( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
In a surprise announcement April 7 , President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] named new [MISC Defense  ] , [ORG Interior  ] and [ORG Education Ministers  ] . 
[PER Jose Bono  ] is out as Defense Minister , to be replaced by [PER Jose Antonio Alonso  ] who moves over from his post as [ORG Interior  ] Minister . 
Current Socialist spokesman in [LOC Parliament  ] and member of [PER Zapatero  ] 's inner circle , [PER Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  ] , will take over the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] and [PER Mercedes Cabrera Calvo-Sotelo  ] will replace [PER Maria Jesus San Segundo  ] as [ORG Minster  ] of [ORG Education  ] . 
The cabinet changes are the first since [PER Zapatero  ] and the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) took office following the March 2004 elections . 
The Ambassador called [PER Bono  ] and [PER Alonso  ] to thank them for their work with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Bono  ] expressed his admiration for the [LOC U.S.  ] and said he was uncertain what he would be doing next . 
[PER Alonso  ] said that had a good relationship with [LOC U.S.  ] officials as Minister of [ORG Interior  ] and was used to cooperating with the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Alonso  ] also said the [LOC U.S.  ] should expect " no negative surprises " from him as Minister of [MISC Defense  ] and suggested that he and the Ambassador meet immediately after the Easter holidays for a comprehensive review of [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] defense issues . 
The Ambassador was unable to reach [PER Rubalcaba  ] , but will speak with him as soon as possible to offer continued close counterterrorism communication . 
End Summary. //THE [ORG ETA  ] FACTOR// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Embassy 's initial analysis on the [ORG Interior  ] and [ORG Defense Ministry  ] changes is that [PER Zapatero  ] 's [ORG ETA  ] policy is the driving force , although there is some speculation that [PER Bono  ] himself asked to leave and this is a shuffle forced on [PER Zapatero  ] . 
Whatever the cause , [PER Zapatero  ] has put into place key allies as he pursues his strategy with [ORG ETA  ] following the March 26 announcement of a ceasefire . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] has been the brain trust on the [ORG ETA  ] policy and putting him in place as Interior Minister solidifies his role and gives him the authority to devise and implement [PER Zapatero  ] 's policies on [ORG ETA  ] , while ensuring political control over police actions against [ORG ETA.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Moving [PER Alonso  ] to [MISC Defense  ] removes [PER Bono  ] -- a longtime rival of [PER Zapatero  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] has not been seen as favorable towards [PER Zapatero  ] 's policies favoring increased powers for [LOC Spain  ] 's regions . 
This puts [PER Alonso  ] -- a close personal friend of [PER Zapatero  ] -- into a key position as [PER Zapatero  ] consolidates his political support and moves his [ORG ETA  ] strategy forward . 
[PER Zapatero  ] 's popularity has increased considerably and he likely feels he no longer needs to keep [PER Bono  ] close to him . 
However , free from the restraint that comes in being in government , [PER Bono  ] may be a wildcard for [PER Zapatero  ] on the political scene. //CHANGES AT [LOC MOD//  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The change at the [ORG MOD  ] is important for the [LOC US  ] , given the extent of our [MISC Defense  ] relationship with the [ORG GOS  ] . 
While not necessarily in any " pro-US " camp , [PER Alonso  ] has been favorable to cooperation with the [LOC US  ] on counter-terrorism . 
He has visited the [LOC US  ] in his role as Interior Minister and has met with Attorney General [PER Alberto Gonzales  ] and [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Robert Mueller  ] -- both in [LOC Spain  ] and in the [LOC US  ] . 
The Ambassador has a cordial relationship with [PER Alonso  ] and the Embassy works well with his staff . 
These relationships could be helpful as [PER Alonso  ] assumes his new role at [LOC Defense.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Moving [PER Alonso  ] to [MISC Defense  ] will likely mean there will be other changes in the ministry as well , although it may take until June to see all the changes that could take place . 
A [ORG PSOE  ] official in the Ministry told the Embassy that the military leadership is unlikely to be affected by the change . 
However , [PER Alonso  ] has been interested for quite some time in removing [ORG Civil Guard  ] Director General [PER Gomez Arruche  ] , so [PER Arruche  ] 's days may be numbered . 
Other sources tell us that [PER Alberto Saiz  ] , the head of the [ORG Spanish Intelligence Service  ] ( the [MISC CNI  ] , which falls under the [ORG MOD  ] ) might be replaced , as he was directly appointed by [PER Bono  ] and was considered a strong [PER Bono  ] ally . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 00000857 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Sources also said [PER Bono  ] has been " feeling uncomfortable " in the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] for " a long time . 
" [MISC Spanish  ] media is reporting that [PER Bono  ] might be done with politics for good , but post thinks that unlikely . 
With [PER Bono  ] out of the picture , a [ORG PSOE  ] advisor told the Embassy that the " [MISC Moratinos  ] line on foreign policy has obtained a victory . 
" Though [PER Bono  ] has portrayed himself and is widely seen as a " friend " of the [LOC US  ] , his actions on [LOC Venezuela  ] defense sales , the [MISC Spanish  ] troop withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] and other issues sometimes belie this image. //CHANGES AT [LOC MOI//  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A [MISC Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) advisor told the Embassy that [PER Rubalcaba  ] is unlikely to make many changes at [ORG Interior  ] because many of " his people " are already in place . 
MFA Director General for [LOC North America  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Jose Pons  ] , told the [MISC DCM  ] that one or two key [ORG Interior  ] officials ( such as [PER Antonio Camacho  ] , currently serving as [PER Alonso  ] 's deptuty ) may be headed to [MISC Defense  ] with [PER Alonso  ] . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] is not known as a friend of the [LOC US  ] ; however , he may well see it in his interest to continue the [LOC CT  ] cooperation with the [LOC US  ] that was put in place by his predecessor . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] is seen as smart and experienced and has the skills necessary to influence people . 
Tapping him for [ORG Minster  ] of [ORG Interior  ] is proof positive that [PER Zapatero  ] is serious about succeeding with [ORG ETA.  ] //PP REACTION// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Popular Party  ] leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] wasted little time in criticizing the selection of [PER Rubalcaba  ] as [ORG Interior  ] Minister ( stating bluntly that the [ORG PP  ] " does not trust [PER Rubalcaba  ] " ) and lamenting [PER Bono  ] 's departure . 
[PER Rajoy  ] 's comments on [PER Rubalcaba  ] reflect [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's reputation as a skilled , and highly partisan , political actor who has worked hard to outmaneuver and isolate the [ORG PP  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] , on the other hand , is among the most conservative [ORG PSOE  ] leaders so it is understandable that the [ORG PP  ] would be sad to see him go . 
He agreed with the [ORG PP  ] in opposing greater autonomy to the [MISC Catalan  ] or [MISC Basque  ] regions and was seen by the [ORG PP  ] as a brake on [PER Zapatero  ] 's readiness to deal with the regional governments . 
Interestingly , a [ORG PP  ] think tank speculated that [PER Alonso  ] was moved to the [ORG MOD  ] in part because [PER Alonso  ] had developed good relations with [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts during his stint as Interior Minister . 
The think tank contrasted [PER Bono  ] 's " strident positions within [LOC Spain  ] and abroad " with [PER Alonso  ] 's ability to inspire confidence both within [LOC Spain  ] and with the [MISC USG.  ] //COMMENT// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Zapatero  ] has installed two of his closest allies into key positions in his cabinet . 
Neither one runs the risk of being seen as a political competitor of [PER Zapatero  ] -- one of the problems that contributed to [PER Bono  ] 's departure . 
Both [PER Alonso  ] and [PER Rubalcaba  ] will carry out [PER Zapatero  ] 's strategy with [ORG ETA  ] to the letter -- a strategy that is no doubt directed at winning the next national elections with an absolute majority . 
Political observers were impressed that [PER Zapatero  ] organized the cabinet reshuffle in complete secrecy . 
Clearly , [PER Zapatero  ] is using this cabinet shuffle , whatever the cause , to move swiftly to take advantage of recent victories and has consolidated his control over his government and the [ORG Socialist Party  ] .
