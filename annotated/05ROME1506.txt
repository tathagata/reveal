<code><pre>S E C R E T [LOC ROME  ] 001506 SIPDIS [LOC BAGHDAD  ] PLEASE PASS TO BG VANGJEL ; JUSTICE FOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL , CRIMINAL DIVISION EO 12958 DECL: 05/02/2015 TAGS PREL , MOPS , KJUS , IT , IZ , IRAQI FREEDOM SUBJECT: IRAQ/ITALY: BERLUSCONI TRYING TO PUT [PER CALIPARI  ] INCIDENT BEHIND US - [MISC ITALIAN  ] REPORT FINDS NO INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY Classified By: Ambassador [PER Mel Sembler  ] , reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary and [MISC Recommendation: Just  ] prior to the May 2 release of the [MISC Italian  ] report on the March 4 killing of intelligence officer [PER Nicola Calipari  ] at a [LOC U.S.  ] checkpoint in [LOC Baghdad  ] , Ambassador , [ORG DCM  ] and [MISC PolMilCouns  ] were called to PM Berlusconi’s office to receive an advance copy of the report and to hear from senior [ORG GOI  ] officials their view of the way forward . 
The [MISC Italians  ] stressed that the [ORG GOI  ] wanted to put the incident behind us , that it would not damage our strong friendship and alliance , and that it would not affect the [MISC Italian  ] commitment in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Italians  ] said that while [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation with [LOC Italy  ] in the joint investigation had been total and thoroughly professional , [LOC Italy  ] had to stand by the [MISC Italian  ] reconstruction of the March 4 incident . 
The [MISC Italian  ] report , they said , concluded that the shooting was not intentional and that no individual responsibility could be assigned for the shooting , thus making the magistrate’s criminal investigation less likely to develop into a full criminal case. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Recommendation ( see also [ORG Para  ] 9 ) : While the [MISC Italian  ] report quibbles with many findings and much of the methodology of the [LOC US  ] AR 15-6 report on the incident , we will be best served by resisting the temptation to attack the [MISC Italian  ] version point-by-point , and should instead continue to let our report speak for itself . 
While our instinct at Post is to defend the [LOC U.S.  ] report and criticize the [MISC Italian  ] one , we realize the consequences of doing so could be asymmetrical: while the criticism in the [MISC Italian  ] report is unlikely to have serious negative consequences for the [ORG USG  ] , if the [ORG GOI  ] appears to be disloyal to its public servants - or to be rolling over to please the [ORG USG  ] in this matter , the consequences for Berlusconi’s government and Italy’s commitment in [LOC Iraq  ] could be severe . 
Therefore , we strongly recommend all [ORG USG  ] spokespeople stand by the 15-6 report while refraining from detailed criticism of the [MISC Italian  ] draft . 
End Summary and [MISC Recommendation.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador , [ORG DCM  ] and [MISC PolMilCouns  ] were called to the PM’s office late May 2 to receive an advance copy of the [MISC Italian  ] report on the March 4 [PER Calipari  ] incident , based on the joint investigation carried out with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and to hear from senior [ORG GOI  ] officials their views on the matter . 
Present on the [MISC Italian  ] side were [PER FM Fini  ] , [PER U/S Letta  ] , PM [ORG Dip Advisor  ] ( [ORG NSA  ] equivalent and Ambassador-designate to the [LOC US  ] ) [LOC Castellaneta  ] , [ORG SISMI  ] Chief [PER Pollari  ] , a few of their senior aides , and the two [MISC Italian  ] investigators [PER BG Campregher  ] and [ORG MFA  ] official [ORG Ragaglini  ] . 
( [PER Berlusconi  ] himself was not at the meeting and , we believe , was out of [LOC Rome  ] until the next morning . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Italians  ] made the following main points: -- The intent of [MISC Italian  ] Government is that this incident should have no negative effect on our excellent bilateral relations . 
-- Specifically , there should be no effect on the [MISC Italian  ] commitment in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
-- The [MISC Italian  ] government wants to put the incident behind us and hopes this report will contribute to that end ( see below for explanation as to how it will serve that purpose ) . 
-- An unclassified version of report would be posted on a [ORG GOI  ] web site May 2 , with classified sections redacted . 
The full , classified report would be given only to PM [PER Berlusconi  ] , but the [ORG USG  ] could have a copy on request after [PER Berlusconi  ] sees it . 
-- [PER Berlusconi  ] would discuss the report in [LOC Parliament  ] on Thursday , May 5 . 
-- It would be useful for President [PER Bush  ] to call [PER Berlusconi  ] Wednesday , so that he could say before [LOC Parliament  ] the next day that he had spoken with the President about the matter. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As to the report itself , the [MISC Italians  ] generally described it as supporting the “tragic accident” thesis , and highlighted the following: -- The report says it is impossible to attribute individual responsibility for the killing . 
-- It also says [MISC Italian  ] investigators found no evidence that killing was intentional . 
-- This last point was designed specifically to discourage further investigation by the prosecuting magistrates , since under [MISC Italian  ] law they apparently can investigate cases of intentional homicide against [MISC Italian  ] citizens outside of [LOC Italy  ] , but not cases of unintentional homicide . 
( NOTE: Our contacts warn that [MISC Italian  ] magistrates are infamous for bending such laws to suit their purposes , so it remains to be seen whether the [ORG GOI  ] tactic will work in this regard . 
) Also , [LOC Castellaneta  ] told us later that the [ORG GOI  ] was hoping the prosecutors would find that , because the killing was unintentional , there would not be grounds for a case of “excessive legitimate defense.” -- The [MISC Italian  ] report was written with prosecuting magistrates in mind . 
The [MISC Italians  ] stressed that [LOC USA  ] 15-6 regulations permitted some things to be covered in the joint investigation but not others , while [MISC Italian  ] magistrates had broader scope that had to be satisfied . 
-- The government will block attempts by parliamentary committees to open their own investigations ( there are already several calls for this from the opposition ) , on the grounds that this report answers questions sufficiently . 
-- The report stands behind the accounts given by [PER Sgrena  ] , the driver , and [ORG SISMI’s Baghdad Station  ] Chief ; i.e. , the “Italian reconstruction” of the incident. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The copy of 67-page [MISC Italian  ] report that they handed to us was a draft that was still being proofread in another room ( in fact , they said it was the only hard copy in existence , and they swapped out a couple pages during the meeting as typos were corrected ) . 
We have translated and e-mailed to State EUR/WE high points ( see para 10 ) and faxed the complete text in [MISC Italian  ] to State EUR/WE . 
Our quick scan indicates that there are several pages in which the [MISC Italian  ] investigators take issue with specific facts and findings in the [LOC USA  ] 15-6 report , generally on the grounds that the accounts of the [MISC Italian  ] witnesses differed significantly from those of the [MISC American  ] soldiers . 
There is also an extensive critique of the inadequacy of SOPs for Traffic control Points and Blocking Positions . 
It argues that more complete notification to [LOC US  ] authorities would not have changed the outcome . 
In a subsequent meeting with the [ORG DCM  ] , [LOC Castellaneta  ] said the main difference in the reports was that the [LOC US  ] report focused on communications while the [MISC Italian  ] report focused on preparation of the soldiers and the stress under which they were operating . 
The final conclusions , though , are as stated by the [MISC Italians  ] in our meeting: no individual responsibility , no deliberate intent. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sembler  ] told the [MISC Italians  ] that the [ORG USG  ] shared the [MISC Italian  ] desire to put this incident behind us and not let it affect overall bilateral relations . 
In that regard , it was important for the [MISC Italian  ] government not to point accusing fingers at the [LOC U.S.  ] or complain about lack of cooperation , and we would endeavor to continue doing so ourselves . 
[PER Fini  ] said [LOC Italy  ] could not complain about cooperation from [LOC U.S.  ] ; the [MISC Italian  ] report clarified that the [MISC Italian  ] investigators had full access and he would ask [PER Berlusconi  ] to stress that fact in parliament on May 5 . 
[ORG Ragaglini  ] and [PER BG Campregher  ] were effusive about the “total and complete” cooperation they received from the [LOC USA  ] investigators , including access to all evidence . 
The one caveat was that for five days before they arrived in [LOC Baghdad  ] BG Vangjel had been conducting interviews within the [LOC USA  ] chain of command re communications and [LOC U.S.  ] knowledge of the rescue operation . 
The [MISC Italians  ] , however , were given copies of everything done prior to their arrival. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Italians  ] were clearly not happy about the classified portions of the [LOC USA  ] 15-6 posted on the web being “unredacted” so easily and asked the Ambassador for an explanation . 
They did not push the issue after he explained it was solely a technical mistake . 
The [MISC Italians  ] said they had pulled from [LOC Baghdad  ] the [ORG SISMI Station  ] Chief whose name was revealed in the “unredacted” version of the 15-6 ; he will not go back. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Embassy recommendations for immediate next steps: -- The [ORG NSC  ] should try to schedule a [MISC POTUS-Berlusconi  ] call on Wednesday . 
-- The [ORG USG  ] public reaction for now should be limited to “We’ve just received [MISC Italian  ] report and are studying it.” ( [MISC Italian  ] press will be furiously nit-picking , and it will not serve a useful purpose for us to get into point-by-point refutation at this stage , although we might want to do backgrounders later in [LOC Baghdad  ] , [LOC Washington  ] , or [LOC Rome  ] . 
) -- The Department should consider a [MISC SecState-Fini  ] call in the next few days to confirm that we share Italy’s desire to put incident behind us. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Informal Embassy Translation of [MISC Italian  ] Report’s Conclusions: “The [MISC Italian  ] representatives - based on the evidence they were able to obtain - did not find elements that would allege that the facts indicate deliberate murder . 
It is realistic that tension felt by the soldiers and some inexperience and stress may have made them react instinctively and with little control . 
The lack of formal references to clear rules that should have been observed makes it problematic to assign specific individual responsibilities . 
The facts asserted by [PER Ms. Sgrena  ] , the car’s driver and the [ORG SISMI  ] Chief of [LOC Station  ] in [LOC Baghdad  ] can be considered realistic . 
Based on the overall analysis , their reconstruction is coherent and plausible.” End Informal Embassy Translation of [MISC Conclusions.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
