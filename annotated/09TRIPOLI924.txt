( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Summary: Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's recent appointment of his son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam as " General Coordinator " and attendant indications of a succession plan have stirred up old rumors of rivalry between seeming frontrunners for the throne , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam and his brother , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi . 
[PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's return from a 12-month self-imposed absence from [MISC Libyan  ] politics and his recent new appointment clearly indicate that his star is on the rise in the constellation of [MISC Libyan  ] succession contenders . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] pere was reportedly disappointed in [PER Mutassim  ] 's management of September 1 Revolution Day anniversary events and his late September travel to [LOC UNGA  ] . 
Nevertheless , [PER Mutassim  ] 's continued engagement on the [LOC U.S.  ] file and continuing efforts to coordinate a meeting between his father and POTUS -- demonstrate that he may see this portfolio as his ticket to continue playing in the succession game ( Ref A ) . 
Contacts assert that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam may be the " face of reform , " due to his high-profile , public status , and the current favorite to succeed his father , but that [PER Mutassim  ] should not be counted out of the succession game , particularly given his backing by conservatives in the regime , such as PM-equivalent [MISC Al-Baghdadi  ] al-Mahmoudi , and his rumored ability as [ORG National Security Advisor  ] to access significant military and security elements , including brother [PER Khamis  ] 's elite 32nd Brigade force . 
End Summary . 
SAIF'S RETURN FROM THE COLD 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's October 6 speech to [ORG Revolutionary Committee  ] members in [LOC Sebha  ] marked the peak of a remarkably resurgent six weeks for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam , which began with the latter 's high-profile return to [LOC Libya  ] on August 20 with convicted [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Saif  ] has also recently begun to re-engage international media , with profiles in two [ORG CNN  ] feature reports on his efforts to " rehabilitate " former [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Islamic Fighting Group  ] members ( septel ) . 
He has also been involved in attempting to settle the ongoing contretemps between the [LOC GOL  ] and [LOC Canada  ] ( septel ) . 
[PER Saif  ] 's reentry onto the public scene signaled the end of his August 2008 self-announced retreat from politics , and comes after some significant setbacks for him over the past year at the hands of regime conservatives . 
In March , the draft constitution ( a Saif-initiative that was to include a position for him as head of a 100-member council of deputies ) was dropped from the agenda of the annual General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( Ref C ) . 
During the same meeting , the [ORG Congress  ] installed or kept ministers historically opposed to [PER Saif  ] 's reform agenda , such as PM-equivalent [MISC Al-Baghdadi  ] al-Mahmoudi ( who kept his position after [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi publicly called him a corrupt thief just six months earlier ) ( Ref D ) . 
Late April witnessed the sudden nationalization of [PER Saif  ] 's quasi-independent media company , which included the take over of his al-Libia satellite channel mid-broadcast by the state-run [ORG Jamahiriya News Agency  ] ( Ref E ) on reported grounds that [PER Saif  ] was overreaching in expanding media freedom . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] 's slide was juxtaposed with younger brother [PER Mutassim  ] 's rise , with the latter completing a state visit to [LOC Russia  ] in October 2008 ( Ref F ) , meeting the Secretary of State in [LOC Washington  ] in March 2009 ( Ref G ) , accompanying [PER Qadhafi  ] on the historic visit to [LOC Italy  ] in June , welcoming [PER CODEL McCain  ] in August ( Ref H ) , and accompanying his father to [LOC New York  ] for the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
[PER Mutassim  ] was very visible at his father 's side throughout these high level visits . 
Additionally , [MISC Al-Baghdadi  ] al-Mahmoudi 's ability to maintain the PM-equivalent position proved to be positive for [PER Mutassim  ] , who is reportedly close to the conservative PM and , in the past , has orchestrated reactions against [PER Saif  ] 's interests through the PM 's office ( Ref I ) . 
Regime insiders also tell us that [PER Mutassim  ] remains the only one who can actually challenge his father . 
WHAT SAIF'S RETURN MEANS FOR [ORG MUTASSIM  ] 4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As [PER Saif  ] 's star rises again , local observers are turning their eyes toward [PER Mutassim  ] for a reaction . 
[PER Mutassim  ] has time and time again evinced his aversion to the spotlight via media encounters or public events . 
Evidence of the elder [PER Qadhafi  ] 's disappointment in [PER Mutassim  ] 's management of September 1 Revolution Day anniversary events , as well as specific missteps in [LOC New York  ] ( i.e. , [PER Mutassim  ] 's inability to get necessary permissions for a tent to be pitched for the [MISC Libyan  ] leader ) have surfaced ( Ref A ) . 
[PER Saif  ] is rumored to have trumped [PER Mutassim  ] during a recent order for all expatriate residents of the [ORG National Oil Company  ] housing compound to vacate their houses . 
The residents report that while [PER Mutassim  ] originally gave the [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000924 002 OF 002 order for everyone to move immediately , [PER Saif  ] intervened to block the demand in order to give the occupants more time to pack up and move . 
[ Note: The reason for the demolition of the housing compound is rumored to be to clear a way for [PER Aisha  ] al-Qadhafi ( known to have disagreements with [PER Saif  ] ) to build a home adjacent to a park near the location . 
End note . 
] 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Simultaneous with [PER Saif  ] 's apparent ascendancy , [PER Mutassim  ] has moved in an uncharacteristically quick manner to reengage on the [LOC U.S.  ] file . 
On November 8 , he approved the 505 agreement , which had previously languished in his office for nearly six months ( Ref J ) . 
A few days before , on November 5 , he personally engaged the Ambassador on the treatment of [MISC Libyan  ] ships at [LOC U.S.  ] ports and [MISC Libyan  ] diplomtas by [LOC U.S.  ] border authorities . 
Additionally , [PER Mutassim  ] renewed his desire to coordinate a meeting between the [MISC Libyan  ] leader and POTUS ( Ref A ) . 
According to the [MISC Egyptian  ] Embassy here , [PER Mutassim  ] was also expected to meet [LOC Egypt  ] 's Intelligence Chief [PER Omar Suleiman  ] during a November visit to [ORG Tripoli  ] ( septel ) , and his staff advised us that he will meet the [MISC Turkish  ] PM during the latter 's historic upcoming visit . 
THE SUCCESSION QUESTION - WILL IT BE SAIF OR [ORG MUTASSIM  ] ? 6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Contacts suggest that although [PER Mutassim  ] is not as skilled in public relations as his older brother [PER Saif  ] , he wields significant power from behind the scenes . 
As [ORG National Security Advisor  ] ( [ORG NSA  ] ) , [PER Mutassim  ] directs at least some of [LOC Libya  ] 's national security policy decisions , including purchases of equipment , and he reportedly plays on issues regarding the military purse . 
Contacts also report that younger brother [PER Khamis  ] al-Qadhafi , Commander of the 32nd " [PER Khamis  ] " Brigade ( widely known to be the most well-trained and well-equipped force in the [MISC Libyan  ] military ) , is closer to [PER Mutassim  ] than to [PER Saif  ] . 
[ Note: At least one contact has commented that [PER Khamis  ] could come out as a dark horse in the succession race . 
End note . 
] [PER Mutassim  ] 's role as [ORG NSA  ] and his reported closeness to [PER Khamis  ] would give [PER Mutassim  ] access to some of the most important military and security elements of the regime . 
Nevertheless , the ultimate authority over the regime 's security apparatus remains in question . 
Independent website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm reported November 4 that the Minister-equivalent of [LOC Defense  ] , [ORG Major General Abu Baker  ] [PER Younis Jaber  ] , recently called on his officers to swear allegiance to [PER Saif  ] in his new post , making it unclear whether the military establishment will report to [PER Mutassim  ] or [PER Saif  ] -- or both -- in the future . 
[ Note: [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi reportedly mediated a conflict between [PER Mutassim  ] and [PER Younis Jaber  ] earlier this year involving their respective roles in military procurement . 
( Ref I ) . 
End Note . 
] COMMENT 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As [LOC Libya  ] undergoes this latest round of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's political restructuring , without a constitution or clarified succession plan , burgeoning sibling rivalry among [PER Qadhafi  ] 's progeny is near inevitable . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] has placed his sons ( daughter [PER Aisha  ] is considered by some shrewder and smarter than her brothers but does not seem to be playing a visible role in the succession struggle ) on a succession high wire act , perpetually thrown off balance , in what might be a calculated effort by the aging leader to prevent any one of them from authoritatively gaining the prize . 
It is also difficult to precisely gauge [PER Mutassim  ] 's depth of ambition for the leadership role since those around him do not freely engage on the topic . 
The rivalry is likely to play out publicly over the next few months in a continued realignment of political and business interests , as reformists ( " [PER Saif  ] backers " ) and conservatives ( " [PER Mutassim  ] backers " ) continue to vie for the elder [PER Qadhafi  ] 's attention . 
[PER Mutassim  ] appears to believe that progress in the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship could prove key to keeping him in the game if he does indeed aspire to play a crucial role in the post-Leader era . 
Whichever of the [PER Qadhafi  ] children wins the " prize , " there is a high level of anxiety among our [MISC Libyan  ] contacts , given the potential for chaos in the absence of the traditionally " guiding hand " of the Leader and given the absence of viable state institutions to insure stability . 
They see a best possible outcome as a division of the spoils , with [PER Saif  ] handling the domestic side of the house and [PER Mutassim  ] handling the security and possible foreign relations part . 
A second possibility is a " trinity , " whereby [PER Saif  ] would be the political face of the regime , [PER Mutassim  ] the national security face , and [PER Khamis  ] the military/security face .
