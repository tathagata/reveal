End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Damascus  ] February 5 awoke to the ugly aftermath of some of the worst rioting the city has witnessed in recent memory . 
The previous afternoon angry crowds stormed the building housing the [MISC Danish  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , as well as the [MISC Swedish  ] and [MISC Chilean  ] missions , ransacking all three and setting the building on fire . 
All three Embassies suffered extensive damage , with the first-floor [MISC Chilean  ] [ORG Embassy  ] suffering the worst . 
The [MISC Chilean  ] [ORG DCM  ] reported that the [ORG Embassy  ] was completely destroyed by fire and vandalism . 
The streets outside were strewn with the embassy 's official papers . 
Rioters were kept out of parts of the [MISC Danish  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] Embassies ( except the waiting rooms ) by security doors and reinforced glass. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The mob then marched to the [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , in the [LOC Mezzeh  ] suburbs , and , after clashing with [MISC Syrian  ] security forces hurriedly posted to defend the [ORG Embassy  ] , tore down the security barriers and trashed the entire building . 
Rioters then set the building ablaze , gutting it entirely . 
Rioters at both sites raised the green religious flag favored by [ORG Hamas  ] supporters. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC FRENCH  ] [ORG EMBASSY  ] SPARED: Rioters also tried to storm the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] but hastily summoned riot police and other security forces used tear gas , water cannons , and truncheons to beat back the mob , which dispersed after two hours of volatile demonstrations . 
MFA Chief of Protocol told the Charge February 5 that [ORG SARG  ] security forces had nearly lost control of the situation at the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] as they had elsewhere . 
According to First Secretary [PER Benedicte de Montlaur  ] , the [ORG Embassy  ] suffered no damage . 
[PER De Montlaur  ] attributed the lack of damage at the [ORG Embassy  ] to the fact that the Ambassador lives on the [ORG Embassy  ] compound , allowing the [MISC French  ] to call for additional [ORG SARG  ] protection more quickly than diplomats at the other three missions , which were closed for the weekend and empty . 
No looting or vandalism was reported anywhere except at the sites of the four diplomatic missions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) THE [MISC AMERICAN EMBASSY:  ] A few hundred [MISC Syrian  ] riot police guarded the [MISC American  ] [ORG Embassy  ] against crowds of several hundred demonstrators . 
Although a few scuffles were reported , there were no serious attempts to penetrate the police line . 
No injuries or damage to property was reported . 
( See septel for [ORG RSO  ] report of February 5 [ORG EAC  ] . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC DANISH  ] [ORG EMBASSY  ] REACTION: The [MISC Danish  ] government has decided to recall its Ambassador to protest the [ORG SARG  ] failure to protect its mission has decided to withdraw all non-essential personnel at the [ORG Embassy  ] , including family members , according to a [MISC Danish  ] diplomat . 
It is also encouraging all [MISC Danish  ] citizens to leave [LOC Syria  ] immediately and is helping to organize the evacuation via air transport later today. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) THE NORWEGIANS: The [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] 's Admin Officer [PER Marie-Louise Hansen  ] reported on February 5 that the [ORG Embassy  ] is also arranging to evacuate [MISC Norwegian  ] citizens in [LOC Syria  ] on flights out of [ORG Damascus International Airport  ] . 
[PER Hansen  ] said that no decision has been made yet about whether the [ORG Embassy  ] 's diplomatic personnel would also leave . 
The [MISC Norwegian  ] Ambassador was in [LOC Jerusalem  ] when the rioting occurred . 
It is not known yet whether he will be recalled. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) THE SWEDES AND CHLEANS: The [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG Embassy  ] is not ordering any drawdown in personnel and had made no decision as of mid-morning about whether it would recommend non-official Swedes to leave the country , reported [MISC Swedish  ] diplomat [PER Eva Nillson  ] . 
The [MISC Chilean  ] [ORG DCM  ] told Polchief that he had not yet received instructions from his government but that he expected it to come back with instructions to lodge a protest and demand extensive compensation . 
With only two diplomats resident in [LOC Damascus  ] , he did not expect to see a recall or other personnel measure , especially since the [MISC Chileans  ] were not specifically targeted but just happened to be the most accessible mission in the building with the [ORG Danes.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) THE [ORG SARG  ] REACTION: The Minister of the [LOC Awqaaf  ] and the [MISC Grand Mufti  ] both issued statements condemning the riots and insisting that [MISC Islam  ] encouraged dialogue as a way to deal with controversies between cultures over religious issues . 
The official [MISC Syrian  ] press reported the incidents on the front pages of several [MISC Arabic-language  ] newspapers and in the English-language [ORG Syria Times  ] , emphasizing popular anger at the purported insults to [MISC Islam  ] and the fact that the burning of the embassies occurred despite the extensive efforts of the [ORG SARG  ] security forces . 
Only the [ORG Syria Times  ] printed a photo actually showing the rioting in front of an embassy. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) When asked by the Charge to explain how the [ORG SARG  ] had failed so miserably to protect diplomatic facilities , MFA Chief of Protocol [PER Amir Smadi  ] responded repeatedly that at least the [ORG SARG  ] had protected the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
He also tried to discount the damage suffered at the [MISC Danish  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] Embassies , but had nothing to say about the destruction the [MISC Chilean  ] [ORG Embassy  ] suffered . 
He noted that [ORG FM  ] Shara'a had spoken with the [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG FM  ] about the attack on the [ORG Embassy  ] and had explained that the [ORG SARG  ] had not expected demonstrations on the day they occurred . 
[PER Smadi  ] said the [ORG USG  ] statement on the caricature of [MISC Mohammed  ] issued several days before the rioting had been " very good , very balanced . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [MISC SYRIAN  ] CONTACTS REACT: Several of our contacts expressed shock and dismay at the violence . 
Typical of them , [ORG AP  ] bureau chief [PER Albert Aji  ] told Polchief " I can't believe that [MISC Syrians  ] did this . 
" Many contacts insisted that the [ORG SARG  ] had to have been involved in facilitating the initial stages of the demonstrations , noting that [LOC Syria  ] is a police state where there is no right of assembly without government sanction . 
Many of the banners put up the day before the rioting , for example in [LOC Rawda Square  ] , adjacent to the [ORG Embassy  ] , had the look of official productions . 
Nearly all the banners had religious slogans , such as " [PER Allah  ] suffices you , he is all-hearing and all-knowing . 
" A thirty-foot banner draped over the front of the biggest building near the [ORG Embassy  ] carried a slogan , " I have not been sent to give curses . 
I have been sent as a mercy . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) SUSPICIONS OF [ORG SARG INVOLVEMENT: Civil  ] society contacts noted that SMS text messages were sent to cellphones two days before , announcing a demonstration on February 4 , in front of the [MISC Danish  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
These contacts also insisted , and an imam confirmed to [LOC Poloff  ] , that the [ORG SARG  ] ( probably through its security services ) had issued a " suggested " sermon for all imams to use in the mosques for the Friday prayers that preceded the Saturday rioting . 
Some contacts reported buses being sighted bringing in demonstrators from some of the rougher areas of [LOC Damascus  ] , including the [MISC Palestinian  ] camps at [LOC Yarmouk  ] , although this could not be confirmed . 
One opposition contact said it was ludicrous to think that the [ORG SARG  ] could not have prevented this rioting -- at least earlier on -- if it chose to , noting that when [PER Riyad Seif  ] and several other recently released [ORG Damascus Spring  ] detainees attempted late last week to hold a press conference , the government deployed " three hundred security officers " to prevent it . 
[MISC Islamist-oriented  ] human rights activist [PER Haithem Maleh  ] insisted that it was [ORG SARG  ] provocateurs affiliated with the security services , rather than [MISC Islamists  ] , who had stormed the embassies and egged on the crowds. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) COMMENT: We concur with contacts that the [ORG SARG  ] allowed these demonstrations to occur and almost certainly helped to facilitate them at the beginning . 
Somewhere along the way , the [ORG SARG  ] , true to form , seems to have miscalculated and lost control . 
The end result left a deeply embarassed [ORG SARG  ] to pick up the pieces and trying to explain its incredible security lapses to the disbelieving [MISC Europeans  ] and [MISC Chileans  ] . 
Despite any miscalculation , loss of control , or embarrassment , the minority Alawite regime seems to have benefited from the rioting , enhancing its legitimacy in several ways . 
It offered its religious [MISC Sunni  ] population an opportunity to vent on an issue of visceral populist concern and it put itself in the vanguard regionally , demonstrating to the [MISC Arab  ] street that [LOC Syria  ] can be counted on to defend [MISC Islamic  ] dignity . 
The rioting also helped the [ORG SARG  ] in its recurring attempts to convey to the international community that " we are the only thing standing between you and the [MISC Islamist  ] hordes . 
" Some argue that the riots also serve as useful distraction from recent price hikes and general hard times .
