( C ) Summary: Mission [LOC Paris  ] recommends that that the USG reinforce our negotiating position with the [ORG EU  ] on agricultural biotechnology by publishing a retaliation list when the extend " [MISC Reasonable Time Period  ] " expires . 
In our view , [LOC Europe  ] is moving backwards not forwards on this issue with [LOC France  ] playing a leading role , along with [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Italy  ] and even the [ORG Commission  ] . 
In [LOC France  ] , the " [LOC Grenelle  ] " environment process is being implemented to circumvent science-based decisions in favor of an assessment of the " common interest . 
" Combined with the precautionary principle , this is a precedent with implications far beyond [MISC MON-810  ] BT corn cultivation . 
Moving to retaliation will make clear that the current path has real costs to [ORG EU  ] interests and could help strengthen [MISC European  ] pro-biotech voices . 
In fact , the pro-biotech side in [LOC France  ] -- including within the farm union -- have told us retaliation is the only way to begin to begin to turn this issue in [LOC France  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) This is not just a bilateral concern . 
[LOC France  ] will play a leading role in renewed [MISC European  ] consideration of the acceptance of agricultural biotechnology and its approach toward environmental regulation more generally . 
[LOC France  ] expects to lead [ORG EU  ] member states on this issue during the [MISC Slovene  ] presidency beginning in January and through its own Presidency in the second half of the year . 
Our contacts have made clear that they will seek to expand [MISC French  ] national policy to a [MISC EU-wide  ] level and they believe that they are in the vanguard of [MISC European  ] public opinion in turning back [ORG GMO  ] 's . 
They have noted that the member states have been unwilling to support the [ORG Commission  ] on sanctioning [LOC Austria  ] 's illegal national ban . 
The [ORG GOF  ] sees the ten year review of the [ORG Commission  ] 's authorization of [ORG MON  ] 810 as a key opportunity and a review of the [ORG EFSA  ] process to take into account societal preferences as another ( reftels ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) One of the key outcomes of the " [LOC Grenelle  ] " was the decision to suspend [ORG MON  ] 810 cultivation in [LOC France  ] . 
Just as damaging is the [ORG GOF  ] 's apparent recommitment to the " precautionary principle . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] publicly rejected a recommendation of the [ORG Attali Commission  ] ( to review [LOC France  ] 's competitiveness ) to move away from this principle , which was added to the [MISC French  ] constitution under [MISC Chirac.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] 's new " [ORG High Authority  ] " on agricultural biotech is designed to roll back established science-based decision making . 
The recently formed authority is divided into two colleges , a scientific college and a second group including civil society and social scientists to assess the " common interest " of [LOC France  ] . 
The authority 's first task is to review [ORG MON  ] 810 . 
In the meantime , however , the draft biotech law submitted to the [ORG National Assembly  ] and the [ORG Senate  ] for urgent consideration , could make any biotech planting impossible in practical terms . 
The law would make farmers and seed companies legally liable for pollen drift and sets the stage for inordinately large cropping distances . 
The publication of a registry identifying cultivation of GMOs at the parcel level may be the most significant measure given the propensity for activists to destroy [ORG GMO  ] crops in the field. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Both the [ORG GOF  ] and the [ORG Commission  ] have suggested that their respective actions should not alarm us since they are only cultivation rather than import bans . 
We see the cultivation ban as a first step , at least by anti-GMO advocates , who will move next to ban or further restrict imports . 
( The environment minister 's top aide told us that people have a right not to buy meat raised on biotech feed , even though she acknowledged there was no possible scientific basis for a feed based distinction . 
) Further , we should not be prepared to cede on cultivation because of our considerable planting seed business in [LOC Europe  ] and because farmers , once they have had experience with biotech , become its staunchest supporters. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Country team [LOC Paris  ] recommends that we calibrate a target retaliation list that causes some pain across the [ORG EU  ] since this is a collective responsibility , but that also focuses in part on the worst culprits . 
The list should be measured rather than vicious and must be sustainable over the long term , since we should not expect an early victory. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) President [PER Sarkozy  ] noted in his address in [LOC Washington  ] to the Joint Session of [LOC Congress  ] that [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] are " allies but not aligned . 
" Our cooperation with [LOC France  ] on a range of issues should continue alongside our engagement with [LOC France  ] and the [ORG EU  ] on ag biotech ( and the next generation of environmental related trade concerns . 
) We can manage both at the same time and should not let one set of priorities detract from the other .
