( C ) SUMMARY During their trip to [LOC Israel  ] , [PER CODEL Cardin  ] discussed [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [MISC Israel-Palestinian  ] negotiations , and the [MISC Israeli  ] elections with [ORG Likud Party  ] leader and candidate for Prime Minister [PER Benjamin Netanyahu  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] described a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] as the greatest threat facing [LOC Israel  ] , and urged strong economic sanctions backed by a viable military option to confront a problem that he said threatened the region and could prove a " tipping point " in world history . 
Describing his approach to " economic peace " with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] suggested he would cut through bureaucratic obstacles to [MISC Palestinian  ] economic development to build a " pyramid " from the " bottom up " that would strengthen the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , and offer the [MISC Palestinians  ] a viable alternative to radicalism . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] expressed support for the concept of land swaps , and emphasized that he did not want to govern the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] but rather to stop attacks from being launched from there . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] suggested [MISC Syrian  ] interest in peace negotiations with [LOC Israel  ] were really overtures to the [LOC United States  ] , and described the [MISC Syrians  ] as firmly in the [MISC Iranian  ] camp . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] expressed confidence that President [PER Peres  ] would offer him rather than [ORG Kadima Party  ] leader [ORG Livni  ] the opportunity of forming a coalition because the bloc of center-right/right wing parties in the new [ORG Knesset  ] amounted to 65 seats . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said his desire would be to form a unity government with [ORG Kadima  ] , but would not agree to a rotating prime ministership . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) As part of their February 14-17 visit to [LOC Israel  ] , [PER CODEL Cardin  ] met with [ORG Likud Party  ] leader and candidate for Prime Minister [PER Benjamin Netanyahu  ] on February 16 in [LOC Jerusalem  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] was at the center of intense political speculation about the formation of a governing coalition following the extremely close [MISC Israeli  ] national election of February 10 , which did not produce a clear winner . 
The [PER CODEL  ] met with [PER Netanyahu  ] following meetings the previous day with President [PER Peres  ] , and prior to meetings later in the day with Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] and [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] Prime Minister [PER Fayyad.  ] ---- [LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] quickly launched into his oft-stated position that [LOC Iran  ] is the greatest threat facing [LOC Israel  ] . 
Noting that " [LOC Persia  ] " already had two bases on the [MISC Mediterranean  ] ( referring to [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] ) , [PER Netanyahu  ] complained that [LOC Iran  ] 's " tentacles " were choking [LOC Israel  ] , and that a new one grew back whenever one was cut off . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] charged that [LOC Iran  ] was developing nuclear weapons with the express purpose of wiping out [LOC Israel  ] , and described preventing [LOC Iran  ] from developing a nuclear capability as [LOC Israel  ] 's highest policy priority . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] described five threats that he saw emanating from [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear development: a direct threat to [LOC Israel  ] ; a direct threat to other regional states ; increased terrorist power under an [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear umbrella ; a [LOC Middle East  ] nuclear arms race ; and a destabilized [LOC Middle East  ] , with [MISC Arab  ] regimes " terrified " of [LOC Iran  ] in his view . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] , commenting that he normally avoided political jargon , pointed to one phrase that he said applied to this issue - " a tipping point . 
" According to [PER Netanyahu  ] , if [LOC Iran  ] develops a nuclear weapon capability it will " topple the peace process " and " change the history of the world . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) When asked what advice he offered to the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] reported that he had spoken to then-candidate [PER Obama  ] and said the method was less important than the goal , and asked rhetorically whether the President would allow [LOC Iran  ] to " cross the nuclear threshold ... on his watch . 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] suggested there were many ways to pressure [LOC Iran  ] , which he saw as economically weak at the moment due to plunging oil prices at the same time that the [LOC U.S.  ] President had strong international backing , a situation [PER Netanyahu  ] described as the opposite of the past few years . 
He said he would look forward ( as Prime Minister ) to discussing with President [PER Obama  ] concrete measures to be taken against [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said these would not be a substitute for [MISC Palestinian  ] negotiations , but that any result from such negotiations would be " washed away " by [LOC Iran  ] 's attaining a nuclear bomb. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When asked how [LOC Iran  ] could be isolated , [PER Netanyahu  ] suggested a blockade as one possibility . 
The nuclear program could be stopped if the [LOC U.S.  ] led the international community to " ratchet up " economic sanctions , but that these sanctions would only work if [LOC Iran  ] knew that the [LOC U.S.  ] military option remained viable . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he did not object to a [LOC U.S.  ] dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] provided the talks were close ended , perhaps two months , with fixed results , otherwise [LOC Iran  ] would [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00000457 002 OF 003 " take you to the cleaners . 
" He said he agreed with the [MISC Europeans'  ] urging the [LOC U.S.  ] to postpone any talks until past the [MISC Iranian  ] elections in June . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he did not know for certain how close [LOC Iran  ] was to developing a nuclear weapons capability , but that " our experts " say [LOC Iran  ] was probably only one or two years away and that was why they wanted open ended negotiations . 
He again urged " tough negotiations " if military means were not used ( and added that Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] was both nice and tough . 
) [PER Netanyahu  ] described the [MISC Iranian  ] regime as crazy , retrograde , and fanatical , with a [MISC Messianic  ] desire to speed up a violent " end of days . 
" That was not the whole country , however , in his view , as he said that " 75 percent of the [MISC Iranian  ] people " oppose the regime , but that it governed with terror and would be hard to overthrow . 
There was no single view from [MISC Iranians  ] , therefore , but there was from the powers that dominate . 
He reiterated that strong economic action could stop their nuclear development or possibly even bring down the regime - as could " the [LOC U.S.  ] military process . 
" ----------------- [MISC PALESTINIAN  ] TRACK ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Turning to peace with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] said the reason the process had not worked so far was that while 70 percent of [MISC Israelis  ] were willing to make concessions , the same number were convinced that there was no real [MISC Palestinian  ] partner . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] warned that when [LOC Israel  ] left [LOC Lebanon  ] is created a first [MISC Iranian  ] base , that when it left [LOC Gaza  ] it created a second [MISC Iranian  ] base , and if [LOC Israel  ] " promised " a third retreat from the [LOC West Bank  ] it would see the same results . 
There were three options , according to [PER Netanyahu  ] - withdrawing to the 1967 borders ( that would " get terror , not peace " ) ; doing nothing ( " just as bad " ) ; or " rapidly building a pyramid from the ground up . 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] suggested a rapid move to develop the [LOC West Bank  ] economically , including " unclogging " bureaucratic " bottlenecks . 
" He promised to " take charge personally " ( as Prime Minister ) to facilitate this bureaucratic reform , which would occur in tandem with political negotiations and cooperation with [LOC Jordan  ] to build up [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] security capacity . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] noted that there were larger demonstrations against the [LOC Gaza  ] operation in [LOC Madrid  ] and [LOC London  ] than in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
He said this was because the [LOC West Bankers  ] recognized that [ORG Hamas  ] represents the prospect of " violent , crazy " people in charge of their society ; they should be offered real alternatives in order to have the strength to resist the radicals. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said his " new approach " would also include not continuing to fund a " bloated " [MISC Palestinian  ] bureaucracy . 
It would be aimed at direct development . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] , noting that he had previously " turned around " the [MISC Israeli  ] economy ( as Finance Minister ) , gave one example of a problem he would fix as an electric powerline in the [LOC West Bank  ] that was held up by conflicting and competing agencies . 
He said this powerline was needed and would create jobs , but was held up not because the [MISC Palestinians  ] were targeted , but because that was how the [MISC Israeli  ] bureaucracy worked for everyone , including [MISC Israelis  ] . 
When asked whether these reforms could include room to modify security arrangements , [PER Netanyahu  ] agreed that some of what the [MISC GOI  ] calls security is in fact bureaucracy . 
Pointing to what he described as strong but unpublicized trade between [LOC Haifa  ] port and [LOC Iraq  ] via [LOC Jordan  ] , he suggested assembly points could be set up in the [LOC West Bank  ] for some goods , which would create thousands of jobs . 
This would not be a substitute for a political settlement , according to [PER Netanyahu  ] , but economic prosperity would make peace possible , as occurred in [LOC Northern Ireland.  ] ----- [LOC SYRIA  ] ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said he was actually more optimistic about dealing with the [MISC Palestinians  ] than with [LOC Syria  ] , because he was confident that the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] wants [LOC Iran  ] and its proxies out . 
He said he was less sanguine about [LOC Syria  ] , which he complained straddles the fence all the time . 
The [MISC Syrians  ] might " talk about " a new ( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) relationship , but he did not see them disconnecting from [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] suggested that [LOC Israel  ] " giving up " the [LOC Golan  ] would just result in assurances that [LOC Syria  ] would later " tear up . 
" Describing King [PER Hussein  ] as heroic , and noting that the King came from his " death bed " in 1998 to get then-Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] and [ORG then-Palestinian Authority  ] Chairman [PER Arafat  ] to reach an agreement at the [LOC Wye River  ] talks , [PER Netanyahu  ] said that when [PER Saddam Hussein  ] took [LOC Kuwait  ] , even King [PER Hussein  ] " snuggled up " to the [MISC Iraqi  ] leader out of necessity . 
Such is the reality in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00000457 003 OF 003 ------------------- COALITION FORMATION ------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite finishing one [ORG Knesset  ] seat behind [ORG Kadima  ] and its candidate [PER Tzipi Livni  ] in the February 10 [MISC Israeli  ] national elections , [PER Netanyahu  ] expressed complete confidence that President [PER Peres  ] would offer him the opportunity to form a government because the bloc of center-right/right wing parties in the new [ORG Knesset  ] has 65 seats compared to [PER Livni  ] 's potential bloc of 45 seats for center-left/left wing parties plus 11 seats for [MISC Arab  ] parties . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said his desire would be to form a unity government with [ORG Kadima  ] , but would not agree to a rotating prime ministership with [PER Ms. Livni  ] . 
He explained that the one time [LOC Israel  ] had a rotation came as a result of an exact tie between the two political coalitions , but this time the right wing bloc was much larger. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) When asked about [PER Avigdor Lieberman  ] 's [ORG Yisrael Beiteinu  ] party , [PER Netanyahu  ] reminded the [ORG CODEL  ] that [ORG Kadima  ] had in fact included [PER Lieberman  ] in their government in its earlier stages . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] stressed repeatedly that he preferred a unity government , and said the large security and economic problems facing [LOC Israel  ] called for the strength that a unity government would offer . 
[PER Livni  ] " collapsed " left- wing votes ( from Labor and other parties ) to score a one vote margin for [ORG Kadima  ] over [ORG Likud  ] in the elections , but took no votes away from the right , according to [PER Netanyahu  ] . 
When asked what he might offer to [ORG Kadima  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] suggested [ORG Kadima  ] would get a few key ministerial portfolios , but did not elaborate . 
He said that he while he was convinced a rotating Prime Ministership would not happen , he was confident a unity government could . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said the government would not include the [MISC Arab  ] parties. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] promised that as Prime Minister his government would not " go back " to unilateral withdrawals , and would have a clear focus . 
On the economy , he said [LOC Israel  ] was not a huge economy such as the [LOC United States  ] or [LOC China  ] , and that he would be able to turn things around quickly , as " a small share of a declining market " was big for [LOC Israel  ] . 
Asked about settlements , [PER Netanyahu  ] noted that he had not established any new settlements when he was Prime Minister . 
Half of the [LOC West Bank  ] , the area east of the ridge line and the [LOC Jordan Valley  ] , is virtually unpopulated and only contains a few settlements . 
In the other half , [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] populations are intertwined . 
Once the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] develops into a real partner it will be possible to negotiate an agreement over territory , settlements and " refined " [MISC Palestinian  ] sovereignty without an army or control over air space and borders . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said it would be too hard to negotiate agreements over [LOC Jerusalem  ] and refugees until the other issues are resolved . 
Claiming that many [MISC Palestinians  ] accept this point , [PER Netanyahu  ] said he was not talking about a delaying tactic but rather a temporary freeze , adding that he hoped [MISC PA  ] Prime Minister [PER Fayyad  ] would still be around since [PER Fayyad  ] also thinks along economic lines. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) As an example of economic development , [PER Netanyahu  ] spoke about expanding faith tourism . 
He said that it " defied imagination " that the well-known site on the [LOC Jordan River  ] where [LOC John  ] the [MISC Baptist  ] baptized [PER Jesus  ] was " paralyzed " by a GOI/PA jurisdiction dispute . 
With [LOC Jericho  ] only a mile away , [PER Netanyahu  ] offered to give an " easy " , secure " envelope " for transporting tourists from the [LOC Galilee  ] to this part of the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
That would lead to " co-production " that would provide large revenue streams of tourist dollars to the [MISC Palestinians  ] , from a population that was already coming to [LOC Israel  ] . 
He asked why [MISC Israelis  ] would be less disposed to make concessions to a viable [MISC Palestinian  ] government and society . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] agreed that [LOC West Bank  ] checkpoints take too long , and offered to look into express lanes , increased staffing , and other possible solutions - as Prime Minister. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 .
