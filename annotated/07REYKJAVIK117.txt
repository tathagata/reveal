( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Summary: A  ] series of newspaper articles about [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees , written by a well-known [MISC Icelandic  ] journalist , in [LOC Iceland  ] 's newspaper-of-record , has seized public attention and ignited new discussion on [LOC Iceland  ] 's conservative refugee admissions policy . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has not admitted any [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees since the beginning of the [LOC Iraq  ] war . 
The generally pro-government newspaper followed the articles with an editorial strongly criticizing the [ORG GOI  ] and encouraging it to shoulder responsibility for supporting the war and accept [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has announced a $100,000 pledge to [ORG UNHCR  ] for [MISC Iraqi  ] refugee aid , though the [ORG MFA  ] was careful to point out to Post that the pledge was in the works well before Morgunbladid 's articles came out . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's newspaper-of-record , Morgunbladid , highlighted the [MISC Iraqi  ] refugee problem and [LOC Iceland  ] 's contributions to reconstruction efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] in articles written by award-winning journalist [PER David Logi Sigurdsson  ] from April 15-17 . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] , a good contact of Embassy [ORG Reykjavik  ] and an alumnus of the Dept 's [ORG International Visitor Leadership Program  ] , traveled to [LOC Amman  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] and interviewed [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees , both [MISC Sunni  ] and [PER Shi'a Muslims  ] , most of whom live there illegally and under dire conditions . 
The first article was an introduction to the situation , and offered personal stories of the refugees and the conditions in which they live . 
The article included a table listing [LOC Iceland  ] 's contributions to the reconstruction efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] ( a total contribution of roughly $5.6 million from 2003-2006 ) . 
The most provocative item was [PER Sigurdsson  ] 's reporting that [LOC Iceland  ] has turned down 10 [MISC Iraqi  ] asylum seekers in the past four years . 
In contrast , he recounted that [LOC Sweden  ] had welcomed several thousand [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees in 2006 , while the [LOC U.S.  ] accepted 202 individuals . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] went on to report the [ORG USG  ] 's pledge to accept 7,000 [MISC Iraqis  ] this year . 
The articles caught the attention of Morgunbladid readers , and on April 17 Morgunbladid included an interview with an [MISC Icelandic  ] woman who wanted to invite an [MISC Iraqi  ] refugee to come live with her and her family in [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) By [PER Sigurdsson  ] 's account , the [ORG Refugee Council of Iceland  ] has debated the possibility of offering asylum to a group of [MISC Iraqis  ] , but [ORG UNHCR  ] suggested that the next group of refugees admitted to [LOC Iceland  ] be [MISC Colombians  ] because there are several [MISC Colombians  ] in [LOC Iceland  ] already and this will facilitate the integration of the refugees . 
When asked in a follow-up article , Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] has usually followed the [ORG UNHCR  ] 's advice and that the [ORG UNHCR  ] was happy with how Icelanders have handled these matters. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On April 16 , [PER Sigurdsson  ] discussed the [ORG UNHCR  ] conference on [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees , taking place in [LOC Geneva  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] on April 17 and 18 , and reported that the [ORG GOI  ] would pledge $100,000 toward [ORG UNHCR  ] operations for [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees . 
This news was confirmed in a press release from the [ORG MFA  ] on April 17 . 
An [ORG MFA  ] official whose purview includes refugee affairs reported to [PER PolOff  ] that the ministry was " not happy " with the way it was portrayed by Morgunbladid , and sought to clarify that the most recent pledge was in the works well before the articles were published . 
She also noted that decisions on individual asylum seekers are the responsibility of the [ORG Directorate of Immigration  ] , while [MISC UNHCR-referred  ] refugees are the concern of the [ORG Refugee Council of Iceland  ] ( which includes the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] as well as the [ORG Icelandic Red Cross  ] ) , and was not pleased that the articles blurred this division of labor. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In an editorial on April 17 , Morgunbladid criticized the [ORG USG  ] for not having accepted more [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees . 
However , notwithstanding the paper 's generally pro-government line , it reserved harsher criticism for the [ORG GOI  ] for not receiving any [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees , and thus not having shouldered the responsibility for supporting the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The editorial urged other countries in the [ORG Coalition of the Willing  ] to accept refugees from [LOC Iraq  ] , especially the lead nations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: As reported reftel , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] 's refugee admissions policy can be described as conservative at best -- over the last decade , [LOC Iceland  ] has admitted roughly 25 refugees every other year , primarily from [LOC Colombia  ] and the [LOC Balkans  ] , while only one individual has received political asylum here since 1984 . 
While concerns about integration into [LOC Iceland  ] 's small , unique society deserve appropriate attention , a reexamination of the fact that [LOC Iceland  ] 's doors are largely closed to refugees and asylum seekers is overdue . 
Post will seek to use this newfound attention to refugee affairs to gently press the issue with our [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors .
