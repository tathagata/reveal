[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) The Icelanders are delighted to welcome you to the [LOC High North  ] . 
Your visit to [ORG Reykjavik  ] is the first by a Secretary of State since Secretary [PER Powell  ] attended the [MISC NATO Summit  ] here in 2002 , and the first bilateral visit since Secretary [PER Albright  ] overnighted in 2000 . 
Under Secretary for Political Affairs Burns was the last senior State official to visit in June of last year. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In development and general prosperity , the [LOC Iceland  ] you will see bears little resemblance to that of the [MISC Cold War  ] years , when the country was struggling to emerge from a hardscrabble existence as one of the poorest countries in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Leveraged investments of fishing profits and cheap , clean electricity translated into a booming economy for most of the last fifteen years . 
Though the economy has faltered in recent months as credit has dried up globally , life is now very comfortable for the vast majority of [LOC Icelanders.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The governing coalition of the Prime Minister 's [ORG Independence Party  ] and the Foreign Minister 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) is strong and enjoys considerable public support , though a few fractures are emerging as economic worries strain the partnership . 
So far , the [ORG SDA  ] has taken the biggest hit in public confidence , as they have struggled to make the shift from opposition to government and have lost a number of coalition policy battles . 
Disagreement over [ORG EU  ] membership may eventually drive the two parties apart , but most likely not before the next scheduled elections in 2011 . 
FM [PER Gisladottir: Atmospherics  ] , topics ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] 's meeting with you in April was the last stop of an extremely heavy spring travel schedule . 
Both she and PM [PER Haarde  ] have been criticized for spending too much time abroad during a period of economic turmoil at home . 
She has focused more on her role as [ORG SDA  ] leader in the last few weeks , though she did find time to visit the [LOC UK  ] for consultations on development aid , to , lobby for [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG UN Security Council  ] bid , and to sign an [MISC MOU  ] on defense cooperation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gisladottir  ] is very appreciative of your visit and views it as confirmation of her role as the proponent of a more international-minded [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Although her welcome will be warm and sincere , [PER Gisladottir  ] is also under pressure from within and outside of her party to show that she can hold her own at the table with the [LOC U.S.  ] She may feel she has to raise sensitive topics such as the [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detention facilities and renditions of terrorist suspects , if only to be able to report she made the point. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Women 's [PER Empowerment: Gisladottir  ] will be keen to follow up on your previous discussion of [LOC Iceland  ] 's proposal for a Women Leaders Working Group. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Middle East/Afghanistan: [PER Gisladottir  ] will be interested in a readout of the [ORG ICI Conference  ] in [LOC Stockholm  ] and developments in [LOC Iraq  ] , as well as your sense of progress in the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace process . 
She has a genuine desire to hear your thoughts on what role small states such as [LOC Iceland  ] can play in the peace process , and may point to [ORG Palestinian Authority President  ] Abbas' comments here last month that perhaps [LOC Iceland  ] could host a second " [MISC Reykjavik Summit  ] , " this time centered on peace in the [ORG Middle East.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Defense and [ORG Security:  ] The FM 's focus here will be on continuing her earlier conversation with you regarding [ORG NATO  ] 's involvement in the [LOC High North  ] and broader security issues in the region , possibly foreshadowing the lunch conversation on [LOC Russia  ] and the [MISC North Atlantic  ] neighborhood . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] may also want to brief on [LOC Iceland  ] 's latest efforts in building robust defense and security ties with neighboring [ORG NATO  ] allies , including recent progress with the [LOC UK  ] . 
She is also likely to cover the bilateral security relationship , and may raise the handover of the previously [ORG U.S.-run Iceland Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) radar stations , on which DOD has the lead . 
We are hoping to complete that transfer soon but may not be able to get the price as low as [LOC Iceland  ] wishes due to legal and regulatory hurdles. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG UN Security Council  ] Bid: We doubt that [PER Gisladottir  ] will spend much time soliciting our vote for one of the two [MISC WEOG  ] seats on the [ORG Security Council  ] this fall ( NOTE: [LOC Iceland  ] is running against [LOC Austria  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] ) . 
Rather , she will go forward from the premise that [LOC Iceland  ] will be successful and will be looking for input on how [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000091 002 OF 002 [LOC Iceland  ] might shape its term on the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
Should [LOC Iceland  ] win election , it will hold the [ORG UNSC  ] Presidency in February 2009 , and [PER Gisladottir  ] is exploring possible themes for [LOC Iceland  ] 's presidency , while also trying to prepare for the potential staffing headache for her small ( 250-person ) foreign service . 
Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] -------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Warm , witty , and pragmatic , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] is at ease in domestic and international settings . 
Since you met him in [LOC Washington  ] in October 2006 to sign the bilateral [MISC Joint Understanding  ] , [PER Haarde  ] has only become more comfortable in the role of [ORG Head of Government  ] . 
[PER Haarde  ] spent much of the first half of this year on trips abroad , serving as the country 's head cheerleader for international audiences and protesting what he sees as the financial media 's tendency to gang up on [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Beyond economic pep talks , he also found time for bilateral visits with his [MISC Canadian  ] and [MISC British  ] counterparts in March and April , and in both places revitalized talks on defense and security cooperation that had become mired in the bureaucracy . 
He was most recently in the [LOC U.S.  ] in April for anniversary celebrations of the international students program at [LOC Brandeis  ] , his undergraduate alma mater. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) You will find [PER Haarde  ] assured and affable , though possibly defensive on the issue of media carping and the influence of foreign speculators on the strength of the [MISC Icelandic  ] currency . 
You may see a slight awkwardness in the interplay between [PER Haarde  ] and FM [PER Gisladottir  ] should the topic of [ORG EU  ] membership come up ; [PER Gisladottir  ] makes no secret of her view that [LOC Iceland  ] should join , while [PER Haarde  ] and his party are opposed . 
On virtually all other points , however , the two leaders have put themselves firmly in sync , and in their year as coalition partners have skillfully presented a unified front on most international issues while ignoring the squabbling of their parties' respective fringe elements . 
[PER Haarde  ] has given [PER Gisladottir  ] a free hand to reorganize the [ORG Defense Department  ] , housed within the [ORG MFA  ] , and supported her as she pushed through [LOC Iceland  ] 's first defense budget . 
While [PER Haarde  ] will defer to [PER Gisladottir  ] as your formal host , he is certain to make his own points to underline the central importance of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] to [LOC Iceland  ] 's security . 
PM/FM Working Lunch Topics: [LOC Russia  ] , Global Economy --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Over lunch with PM [PER Haarde  ] and FM [PER Gisladottir  ] , we anticipate a wider scope to the discussion , focusing on issues of global concern . 
In particular , [LOC Iceland  ] is keeping a close eye on developments in [LOC Russia  ] , and the chattering classes here swing from criticism of [LOC U.S  ] . 
" provocations " of the [MISC Russians  ] to deep concerns over the increasingly assertive [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy . 
This topic would provide an ideal opportunity to follow up on the [ORG NATO  ] Bucharest Summit and the issue of [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] -- [LOC Iceland  ] supported [LOC MAP  ] for both , but did not want to appear too far out in front . 
Further afield , both [PER Haarde  ] and [PER Gisladottir  ] would be interested in your views on developments in [LOC East Asia  ] -- particularly [LOC China  ] -- and in [LOC Africa  ] , two areas where [LOC Iceland  ] is constructing new business or development ties. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [PER Haarde  ] and [PER Gisladottir  ] may also want to briefly cover economic issues , both to talk up the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy and to explore developments in the [LOC U.S.  ] and global economy that have a bearing on [LOC Iceland  ] 's highly leveraged financial sector . 
[PER Haarde  ] , who as Finance Minister oversaw much of [LOC Iceland  ] 's startling economic transition , is particularly interested in reassuring the [LOC U.S.  ] concerning [LOC Iceland  ] 's creditworthiness. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Whaling will be in the news again shortly before your arrival , as the government issued a new quota for commercial hunting of minke whales on May 19 . 
While [PER Gisladottir  ] and her fellow SDA ministers believe whaling harms [LOC Iceland  ] 's image abroad and serves no real domestic interest , [PER Haarde  ] 's party controls the issue and the PM is a firm defender of what he sees as [LOC Iceland  ] 's sovereign right to manage its own marine resources.
