( C ) SUMMARY . 
[ORG Tanzania’s Prevention of Corruption Bureau  ] ( [ORG PCB  ] ) has never successfully prosecuted a high-level corruption case involving either the private or public sector . 
On July 14 , the Director General of the [ORG PCB  ] , [PER Edward Hoseah  ] , assured the [ORG DCM  ] that the [ORG PCB  ] was now prepared to prosecute a milestone corruption case: the [MISC U.K.-Tanzanian  ] [ORG BAE  ] radar deal . 
Beyond plans to prosecute the [ORG BAE  ] case , [PER Hoseah  ] painted a mixed picture regarding the Government of [ORG Tanzania’s  ] ( [MISC GOT’s  ] ) progress toward addressing the country’s endemic corruption problem . 
On one hand , [PER Hoseah  ] highlighted recent legal reforms and the increasing willingness of both Parliament and press to level corruption charges against the government . 
On the other hand , he noted the unabated corruption in [LOC Zanzibar  ] , weak capacity of his bureau , and President Kikwete’s reluctance to implicate former President [PER Benjamin Mkapa  ] or members of [LOC Mkapa’s  ] inner circle in corruption scandals . 
Finally , [PER Hoseah  ] reiterated deep concern about his personal safety , explaining that he frequently received threatening letters . 
In the event of increasing threats to his life , [PER Hoseah  ] said he would not hesitate to seek refuge in another country . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG PCB: Ready  ] to Prosecute the [ORG BAE Radar Deal  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Edward Hoseah  ] , Director General of the [ORG Prevention of Corruption Bureau  ] ( [ORG PCB  ] ) told the [ORG DCM  ] that the [ORG PCB  ] was almost finished with its investigation of the U.K.- [MISC Tanzanian  ] [ORG BAE  ] radar deal and that it intended to prosecute the case. “We are focused on the 31 percent commission paid to [ORG BAE  ] . 
We understand that businessmen need commissions but the question is whether 31 percent is lawful or not , ” [PER Hoseah  ] said . 
He called the deal “dirty” and said it involved officials from the [ORG Ministry of Defence  ] and at least one or two senior level military officers. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hoseah  ] said that the two primary suspects , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER Shailesh Vithlani  ] , CEO of [PER Merlin International  ] , were currently out of the country but that when they returned the [MISC GOT  ] would begin to prosecute. “I have obtained President Kikwete’s support to prosecute the culprits once they return to [LOC Tanzania  ] , ” he said , stressing that prosecution of the case would mark an important milestone in the [MISC PCB’s  ] struggle. “The real signal of the [ORG GOT’s  ] political commitment will be when we take this radar case to court , ” [PER Hoseah  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Note: [PER Shailesh Vithlani  ] is a [MISC British  ] citizen who reportedly grew up in [LOC Tanzania  ] . 
He heads [PER Merlin International  ] , a [LOC Dar es Salaam  ] based company . 
[PER Merlin International  ] has been implicated as the agent for [ORG Britain’s BAE Systems  ] which sold a USD 40 million military radar system to the [MISC GOT  ] in 2002 . 
Beyond the [ORG BAE  ] radar deal , [PER Merlin  ] has been linked in the media to a range of other high profile government deals including the sale of a [ORG Gulfstream  ] presidential jet to former President [PER Benjamin Mkapa  ] . 
According to a July 13 report in This Day , a local newspaper , at the time of the [ORG BAE  ] deal , Vithlani’s local partner was [PER Tanil Somaiya  ] of [ORG Shivacom Tanzania Ltd  ] . 
Promising Signs on [MISC Anti-Corruption Front: Legal Reform...  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to the possible prosecution of the [ORG BAE  ] radar case , [PER Hoseah  ] emphasized that there were other promising signs in [ORG Tanzania’s  ] fight against corruption . 
First , he noted that as of July 1 the [MISC Anti-Corruption  ] bill had become fully operational , laying the legal groundwork to accelerate the prosecution of corruption . 
He said that the [MISC GOT  ] had almost finalized its “whistle blowers” legislation and that the relationship between the [ORG PCB  ] and the Director of Public Prosecution ( [ORG DPP  ] ) had improved. “I have a good working relationship with the new [ORG DPP  ] and he appears serious about prosecuting corruption.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Stronger Parliament , Press , and Public Support --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A second promising sign regarding anti-corruption efforts which [PER Hoseah  ] stressed was increased support within the Parliament , press and the general public. “Parliament is now our ally . 
Members of Parliament are no longer just spectators ; they are starting to ask the tough questions to unveil corruption schemes , ” [PER Hoseah  ] said . 
He explained that the media was also making a crucial contribution , showing politicians that they could not hide: “The press has started to bring allegations against former President [PER Mkapa  ] . 
This signals to all politicians that no one is immune.” Awareness is growing among the general public too , [PER Hoseah  ] noted , as evidenced by the increased trust in the [ORG PCB  ] and the decline of negative news articles about the [ORG PCB  ] and its staff . 
Initiatives Stemming from the [ORG UNCAC  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Finally , [PER Hoseah  ] noted [ORG Tanzania’s  ] participation in the [MISC UN Convention Against Corruption  ] as another reason for optimism on the anti-corruption front . 
As a signatory to the [ORG UNCAC  ] , [LOC Tanzania  ] must not only follow international standards , but will take part in several anti-corruption initiatives in the near future . 
For example , [LOC Tanzania  ] will be subject to a peer review and a gap analysis on its compliance with the convention . 
Troubling Signs on [MISC Anti-Corruption: Impunity  ] at the [LOC Top....  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Hoseah  ] then turned to his concerns regarding [ORG Tanzania’s  ] anti-corruption struggle . 
He noted that President [PER Kikwete  ] does not appear comfortable letting the law handle corruption cases which might implicate top level officials . 
According to [PER Hoseah  ] , President [PER Kikwete  ] is hesitant to pursue cases which may implicate former President [PER Benjamin Mkapa:  ] “Kikwete is soft on [PER Mkapa  ] . 
He does not want to set a precedent by going after his predecessor.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Referring to the widespread rumors of corruption within the [ORG Bank of Tanzania  ] ( Ref B ) , [PER Hoseah  ] remarked that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] In [LOC Hoseah’s  ] view , Kikwete’s recent appointment of three new deputy [ORG BOT  ] governors was [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] remarked that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] responses to allegations [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were opaque and even projected a sense of impunity. “Your perception is correct , ” [PER Hoseah  ] responded , adding , “there is a sense of impunity with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] because he and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] are so closely intertwined . 
[PER Kikwete  ] would find it very difficult to fire him.” Complacency on [LOC Zanzibar...  ] --------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The ongoing , if not accelerating , level of corruption on [PER Zanzibar  ] is another cause for pessimism in [ORG Tanzania’s  ] fight against corruption . 
While establishment of [ORG Tanzania’s Financial Intelligence Unit  ] ( [ORG FIU  ] ) would indeed force changes on [PER Zanzibar  ] in the long term , [PER Hoseah  ] admitted that he did not believe Zanzibar’s current leadership was committed to fighting corruption . 
With a “free port” and government officials routinely on the payroll of foreign investors , [PER Zanzibar  ] is rife with corruption , [PER Hoseah  ] emphasized . 
With the momentum of anti-corruption efforts on the [LOC Mainland  ] , [PER Zanzibar  ] will have to follow suit , [PER Hoseah  ] said . 
He added , however , that “in the short term , Zanzibar’s President faces the end of his term and it appears that there is actually an acceleration of corruption through acquisition of land and other assets.” Continuing Capacity Constraints... --------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Hoseah  ] raised the [MISC PCB’s  ] lack of capacity as another key challenge to [ORG Tanzania’s  ] anti-corruption campaign . 
He stressed that support from the [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] ( [ORG MCA  ] ) [ORG Threshold Program  ] has assisted the [ORG PCB  ] immensely with training prosecutors and investigators . 
Still , institutional capacity at the [ORG PCB  ] is weak and additional capacity building is needed . 
One area which [PER Hoseah  ] specified for additional training was intelligence or evidence gathering. “Cooperation among law enforcement agencies is still limited and we need to improve our intelligence capabilities , ” [PER Hoseah  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] . 
Threat of Stepping on the Wrong Toes ------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) At the end of the meeting , [PER Hoseah  ] reiterated concern for his personal security ( Ref A ) , saying he believed that his life may be in danger . 
He told the [ORG DCM  ] that he had received threatening text messages and letters and was reminded everyday that he was fighting the “rich and powerful.” While [PER Hoseah  ] maintained that he was not scared to do his job , he said that he could not be seen as “uncompromising.” Toward the end of the meeting , he said quietly to the [ORG DCM  ] , “If you attend meetings of the ‘inner-circle , ’ people want you to feel as if they have put you there . 
If they see that you are uncompromising , there is a risk.” Finally , he made clear that if the threat to his life reached a certain point , he would flee the country . 
Comment: [PER PCB’s List  ] of [ORG Untouchables: Growing  ] ? --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In our January 2007 meeting with [PER Hoseah  ] ( Ref A ) , he said his primary goal as the newly appointed Director General of the [ORG Prevention of Corruption Bureau  ] would be to prosecute “big fish.” He told us point blank , however , that cases against the Prime Minister or President were off the table . 
Now , he has revealed that former President [PER Benjamin Mkapa  ] and certain members of [LOC Mkapa’s  ] inner circle may also be untouchable , many of whom have ministerial or sub-ministerial posts in Kikwete’s government . 
Thus , while President Kikwete’s talk against corruption might be tough , he is clearly treading carefully and the jury remains out on his commitment to tackling high-level corruption. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Even if the [PER Kikwete  ] administration does prosecute the [ORG BAE  ] case , it is important to note that the [MISC U.K. Serious Fraud Office  ] conducted the lion’s share of the investigation . 
According to [PER Hoseah  ] , after the [ORG Fraud Office  ] confronted the [ORG GOT  ] with evidence , [ORG PCB  ] officials were invited to spend one month in [LOC London  ] working with the [ORG Serious Fraud Office  ] to finalize the case . 
Therefore , although the [ORG GOT  ] may ultimately point to [ORG BAE  ] as a landmark case reflecting commitment to combating corruption , the decision to prosecute may actually reflect the notoriety of the case in the [LOC UK  ] , its notoriety and prominent press play here , and most importantly , the fact that a fully developed case file , brimming with detailed evidence , was presented by [LOC UK  ] investigators to the [ORG Prevention of Corruption Bureau  ] . 
In short , to the cynical eye , the [ORG GOT  ] may have little recourse other than to prosecute .
