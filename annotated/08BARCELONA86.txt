[LOC Catalonia  ] Vice President [PER Josep Carod-Rovira  ] is expected to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] to inaugurate the new office . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Roser Clavell  ] , Secretary General of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] told [ORG CG  ] September 9 the [ORG Generalitat  ] ( [LOC Catalonia  ] 's regional government ) plans to extend its presence abroad this year by opening offices in [LOC New York  ] city . 
According to [PER Clavell  ] , the new office will bring together under one roof the various offices the [ORG Generalitat  ] has in the most prominent capital cities in the world . 
Who will head the delegation has not yet been decided . 
The [ORG Generalitat  ] currently has offices in [LOC Paris  ] , [LOC Berlin  ] , [LOC Brussels  ] , and [LOC London  ] . 
There also plans to open offices in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] and [LOC Mexico City  ] , and [LOC Morocco  ] . 
[LOC Catalonia  ] has a number of offices to promote tourism , business , and the [MISC Catalan  ] culture and art. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clavell  ] lamented the fact that the world , in her words , only knows [LOC Catalonia  ] through two ways , the diplomatic corps resident in [LOC Barcelona  ] ( good ) and the national [MISC Spanish  ] press ( not so good ) . 
[PER Clavell  ] implied the [ORG Generalitat  ] was not happy with its portrayal in the press and wanted to tell its own story . 
The new offices are a way of doing just that . 
The office in [LOC New York  ] will be located at the [LOC Rockefeller Center  ] and it is planned to be opened on October 30 . 
[PER Clavell  ] will accompany [ORG Generalitat  ] VP and [MISC Republican  ] Left of [LOC Catalonia  ] ( [ORG ERC  ] ) President [PER Josep Carod-Rovira  ] to [LOC New York  ] for the inauguration . 
While being there , [PER Clavell  ] said officials are hoping to meet with [LOC New York  ] Governor [LOC Patterson  ] , participate in the opening of an exhibit on [MISC Catalan  ] painter [PER Joan Miro  ] organized by [ORG MOMA  ] , and attend [ORG UNESCO  ] 's linguistic university. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Despite falling popularity at the polls , [ORG ERC  ] leader [PER Carod-Rovira  ] is pressing ahead with his strategy of raising [LOC Catalonia  ] 's flag in the world 's major cities . 
While it is not at all clear [MISC Catalans  ] are happy seeing their taxes go to expensive offices in the most expensive cities around the world , especially since officials have recently claimed lack of resources to cover rising social and educational programs , the [ORG ERC  ] is hoping regional pride will eventually win the day . 
One official close to [ORG Generalitat  ] President [PER Jose Montilla  ] told [ORG CG  ] recently the President has made the decision to systematically cut the Vice President 's office out of foreign affairs . 
This latest move by [PER Carod-Rovira  ] could be a reaction to the President . 
Conversely , [ORG Carod  ] 's decision to open the [LOC New York  ] office might have been the action that caused the President to decide to start clipping the Vice President 's wings . 
End Comment .
