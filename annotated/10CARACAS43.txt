( C ) Summary: President [PER Chavez  ] made socialism taste better with the December 22 opening of a " socialist arepera " serving [MISC Venezuelan-style  ] tortillas at a fraction of their usual price . 
The " [MISC Arepera Socialista  ] " is planned to be the first of a chain of [MISC Venezuelan  ] government ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) restaurants run by the [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] . 
This restaurant is the [ORG GBRV  ] 's latest effort at setting up alternatives to the private market , branding national symbols , like the " arepa , " as part of the [MISC Bolivarian  ] Revolution , and providing tangible benefits to its electoral base before the September legislative elections . 
End Summary . 
Socialism 's Tangible - and Tasty -- Benefits <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) President [PER Chavez  ] opened the " [MISC Arepera Socialista  ] " with much fanfare on December 22 , advertising its low price and high quality as symbolic of the benefits of his socialist revolution . 
( Note: " Arepas " are a [MISC Venezualan-style  ] thick cornmeal tortilla usually used for a type of sandwich . 
End Note . 
) The restaurant , located in a lower middle class neighborhood of [LOC Caracas  ] , serves " arepas " for about a fourth of their regular price . 
It is currently only open during weekday mornings , although there are plans to extend its hours , add coffee and fresh juice to its menu , and open two new locations in working class neighborhoods. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) On a January 8 visit , [ORG EmbOffs  ] witnessed a long line of people waiting to get into the restaurant but surprisingly rapid service . 
Inside , one wall was dominated by a quote in large red lettering from [PER Simon Bolivar:  ] " The best system of government is that which produces the greatest happiness . 
" An employee managing the line said the restaurant served 1,200 customers per day . 
One man in line said he worked in the neighborhood and came every day since the food was excellent and cheap . 
Money is Secondary in Socialist Restaurants <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to Minister of [LOC Commerce  ] [PER Eduardo Saman  ] , people can count on low prices at the " arepera socialista " because the ingredients come from government-owned companies and other products , such as boxed juices , come from government-owned companies . 
[PER Saman  ] claimed the prices were sufficient to cover the store 's operating costs . 
He also announced on December 23 that a chain of " [MISC Arepera Socialista  ] " restaurants would be opened throughout [LOC Venezuela  ] as part of the Socialist [ORG Market Cooperatives  ] run by the [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] . 
[PER Saman  ] himself worked at the restaurant on December 24 ; other [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] employees were " volunteering " at the restaurant on the day of the [MISC Emboffs'  ] visit . 
About 30 people work at the restaurant. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Besides the price , [PER Saman  ] highlighted another key difference between socialist and capitalist " arepera " : customers pay only after eating , while " in fast food chains . . . they only think about money . 
" In the " [MISC Arepera Socialista  ] , " the cash register is in a corner of the room and customers pay only after eating , self-reporting how many of the " arepas " they ate . 
Comment: Let [PER Them Eat Arepas  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Facing high inflation , electricity and water rationing , and failing public services , [PER Chavez  ] may see the " arepera socialista " as a relatively quick and easy way to promote the [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000043 002 OF 002 benefits of " socialism " to his electoral base before the September legislative elections . 
The challenge will be meeting demand without raising the subsidized price or cutting quality .
