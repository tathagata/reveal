( U ) [MISC Spanish  ] media reported that Doctor [PER Jose Luis Garcia Sabrido  ] , Chief Surgeon of the [LOC Community of Madrid  ] 's [LOC Gregorio Maranon Hospital  ] , had examined [PER Fidel Castro  ] for 90 minutes on December 21 . 
[PER Garcia Sabrido  ] asserted on December 26 that " as far as I know , [PER Castro  ] does not have cancer . 
" [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] also said [PER Castro  ] was recovering well " for someone of his advanced age , " and could conceivably recover sufficiently to return to power . 
In a news conferecence , [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] stated that " ( [PER Castro  ] ) does not have a malignant tumor , " and is recovering from very serious and complex surgery and that the post-operative process includes " muscular and nutritional rehabilitation . 
" [PER Garcia  ] [PER Sabrido  ] declined to elaborate on the nature of [PER Castro  ] 's condition . 
He said that [PER Castro  ] 's intellectual ability remained intact , but failed to discuss his current physical condition , other than to say that it was " stable . 
" [PER Garcia  ] [PER Sabrido  ] , who admitted treating other unnamed [MISC Cuban  ] leadership figures , lauded [PER Castro  ] 's medical care in [LOC Havana  ] and said he had not recommended any changes in his rehabilitation regimen . 
Asked for his personal views on the [MISC Cuban  ] system , [PER Garcia  ] [PER Sabrido  ] said that he " admired the successes of [MISC Cuban  ] society , but do not want to offer my opinion on other political issues . 
" <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Following up on these reports , Post consulted various sources for additional details . 
One contact , [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a [LOC Cuba  ] activist and close associate of noted exile author [PER Carlos Alberto Montaner  ] , said that he was certain that Doctor [PER Garcia  ] [PER Sabrido  ] was being truthful and that if he said that [PER Castro  ] did not have cancer , then [PER Castro  ] did not have cancer . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] freely acknowledged his sympathy for [PER Fidel Castro  ] and was a frequent visitor to the island , but that in the [LOC Madrid  ] medical community he was also known as a skilled surgeon with a high degree of integrity . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] found it impossible to contemplate that [PER Garcia  ] [PER Sabrido  ] would have risked his professional reputation merely to delay public knowledge of the details of [PER Castro  ] 's illness . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that in having [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] make a positive assertion that [PER Castro  ] does not have cancer , the [MISC Cuban  ] Government has obtained a credible foreign specialist to confirm what they have been claiming in recent weeks. //BUT [MISC CUBAN  ] EMBASSY DID REQUEST CANCER DRUGS// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that while he felt compelled to accept [PER Garcia  ] [PER Sabrido  ] 's statements , he was still confused by elements of this case . 
Most importantly , [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] had confirmed from sources in the [ORG Madrid Community  ] health system that the [MISC Cuban  ] Embassy in [LOC Madrid  ] had requested specialized cancer drugs ( sitostatic drugs to inhibit cancer cell growth ) and pain killers in June 2006 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that the drugs may have been for another [MISC Cuban  ] leader. //COMMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The fact that Doctor [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] is technically an employee of the [ORG Popular Party-governed Community of Madrid  ] generated some mild discomfort for [LOC Madrid  ] PP leader [PER Esperanza Aguirre  ] , who made clear that [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] had undertaken his trip to [LOC Cuba  ] in his own capacity and without [ORG Community  ] funds . 
All political figures generally defended the humanitarian nature of [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] 's actions , though some [MISC Cuban  ] activists in [LOC Madrid  ] suggested that [MISC Spanish  ] donors should also insist on being able to provide medicines to [MISC Caritas  ] and other charitable organizations in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Our sense is that most Spaniards will find [PER Garcia  ] 's [PER Sabrido  ] 's actions appropriate . 
In a conversation with [ORG DCM  ] , MFA Director General for Foreign Policy [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] said that he had no new information as a result of the [ORG Garcia  ] [PER Sabrido  ] 's trip to [LOC Cuba  ] , but said he believed [MISC Spanish  ] officials could debrief [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] soon and offered to meet with DCM at a later date to discuss the issue further . 
We will continue to investigate and report any new information as it develops .
