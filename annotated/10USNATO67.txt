( C ) [LOC Lithuania  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] PermRep [LOC Linkevicius  ] raised [LOC France  ] 's potential sale to [LOC Russia  ] of a [MISC Mistral  ] class ship during a February 9 PermReps' lunch , noting that the sale was not simply a national issue but a subject for discussion within the [ORG Alliance  ] . 
[MISC French  ] PermRep [PER Andreani  ] did not respond . 
However , the following day , the February 10 NAC meeting , [PER Andreani  ] made a point of highlighting [LOC France  ] 's commitment to [MISC Baltic  ] security by reporting that [LOC France  ] had been participating since January 4 in [MISC Baltic  ] air policing . 
She cited this as evidence of [LOC France  ] 's commitment to the collective defense of the [MISC Baltics  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] Political Counselor told us afterward that he was waiting for guidance from [LOC Paris  ] on the [MISC Mistral  ] sale as the [MISC French  ] [ORG Mission  ] here had not previously been involved in this issue . 
On February 11 , [MISC Estonian  ] PermRep [LOC Luik  ] complained about the sale over lunch with Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] , noting that inclusion of Allied equipment could trigger third county transfer rules - in particular the case of [MISC Canadian  ] technology. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [ORG NATO  ] Spokesman [PER James Appathurai  ] was asked about the sale during a February 10 press conference , in light of [LOC Russia  ] 's newly released military doctrine that identifies [ORG NATO  ] enlargement as a key threat . 
[PER Appathurai  ] noted that , while Secretary-General [PER Rasmussen  ] recognized the concerns of some Allies over the sale were real and understandable for historic and geographic reasons , [PER Rasmussen  ] had told [MISC Russian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] that he did not view [LOC Russia  ] as a threat and hoped [MISC Russians  ] did not see [ORG NATO  ] as a threat. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC Mistral  ] sale had not been a topic of debate at [ORG NATO  ] prior to the [MISC Lithuanian-French  ] exchange . 
Several Allies have been reluctant to raise an [PER Ally  ] 's bilateral arms sales at [ORG NATO  ] , even if they preferred that [LOC France  ] not sell the ship to [LOC Russia  ] . 
In the past , discussion of bilateral arms sales have traditionally not been seen as an appropriate topic at [ORG NATO  ] . 
Given the significance of the potential [MISC Mistral  ] sale and broader discussions on reassurance and [ORG NATO  ] 's relations with [LOC Russia  ] , the [MISC Mistral  ] may be viewed as an exception in light of some Allies' concerns regarding [LOC Russia  ] 's military capabilities and intentions , and possible third party transfer rules .
