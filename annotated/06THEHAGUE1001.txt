PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY . 
REF: THE HAGUE 00149 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) SUMMARY: There are a growing number of [MISC Islamic  ] schools in [LOC The Netherlands  ] , but they are hardly madrassas . 
All are state funded , follow the national [MISC Dutch  ] curriculum , teach in [MISC Dutch  ] , and have largely [MISC Dutch  ] personnel . 
Although the number of [MISC Islamic  ] schools is small - 47 in the whole country - they have become one focus of the ongoing political debate over integration in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
NUMBER OF [MISC ISLAMIC SCHOOLS SMALL  ] BUT GROWING ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The number of [MISC Islamic  ] schools in [LOC The Netherlands  ] has slowly grown over the last few years , reaching 45 primary and two secondary schools in the 2005-2006 school year . 
More schools plan to open next year , including a third secondary school in The [ORG Hague  ] . 
Muslims we have spoken to say many [MISC Muslim  ] parents prefer a more conservative environment than public schools offer - some even send their children to [MISC Christian  ] schools when [MISC Islamic  ] schools are not available . 
Some students also say the [MISC Islamic  ] schools offer a refuge from prejudice at some public schools . 
One female student at an [MISC Islamic  ] secondary school in [LOC Rotterdam  ] told us , for example , that she had been harassed in a public school for wearing a headscarf . 
She told us she felt more comfortable in the [MISC Islamic  ] school. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Since 1917 , the [ORG Dutch Constitution  ] has provided for government funding of religious schools . 
The [ORG GONL  ] thus fully funds [MISC Islamic  ] schools and inspects them on a regular basis . 
As all students in [MISC Islamic  ] schools are required to pass national exams , these schools follow the same curriculum and use the same textbooks as their non-religious school counterparts , although regulations allow for nonnational curriculum courses , including classes on [MISC Islamic  ] and [MISC Koranic  ] studies , [MISC Arabic  ] , and world religion . 
MAJORITY OF [MISC MUSLIM  ] STUDENTS NOT IN [MISC ISLAMIC  ] SCHOOLS --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) According to Said [PER Benayad  ] , former Chairman of the umbrella organization for [MISC Islamic  ] schools ( [ORG ISBO  ] ) and a current board member of [ORG INHOLLAND University  ] , the 45 [MISC Islamic  ] primary schools in the [LOC Netherlands  ] represent about 0.6 percent of the total number of primary schools in the country . 
Only 4 percent of all ethnic students attend [MISC Islamic  ] schools . 
Some 85 percent of teachers at these schools are non-Muslim , while 75 percent of the principals are non-Muslim . 
All [MISC Islamic  ] schools in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are co-educational , although at least one [LOC Amsterdam  ] school separates boys and girls in the classroom . 
As a comparison , [PER Benayad  ] noted that 70 percent of ethnic [MISC Muslim  ] students in The [ORG Hague  ] attend public schools , 15 percent attend [MISC Christian  ] schools , and 15 percent attend [MISC Islamic  ] or other schools . 
FUTURE OF [MISC ISLAMIC  ] SCHOOLS DEBATED --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given the national debate on integration , the future of [MISC Islamic  ] schools has become a focus of political and parliamentary discussion , with some questioning whether [MISC Islamic  ] schools should continue to qualify for government funding . 
For those who oppose government funding of [MISC Islamic  ] schools , the issue is how to end such funding without also ending state support of [MISC Christian  ] schools. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Another question raised in the debate is whether the existence of [MISC Islamic  ] schools encourages separation of ethnic [MISC Muslim  ] from native [MISC Dutch  ] children . 
In a recent meeting with [ORG Emboffs  ] , [LOC Amsterdam  ] Mayor [PER Job Cohen  ] asserted that [MISC Islamic  ] schools are a positive development . 
He said such schools generally follow [MISC Dutch  ] curriculum , maintain high standards , and participate fully in the educational system . 
He did acknowledge , however , that [ORG Amsterdam City  ] officials probably need to pay closer attention to the operations and affiliations of a small number of [MISC Islamic  ] schools associated with mosques with more radical messages. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some right-wing critics , such as parliamentarians [PER Geert Wilders  ] and [PER Ayaan Hirsi Ali  ] , argue that [MISC Islamic  ] schools do not foster integration in [MISC Dutch  ] society . 
They claim that a policy of maintaining separate , segregated schools hinders interaction between [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim THE HAGUE 00001001 002.2 OF 002 [MISC Dutch  ] students . 
Moreover , they assert that in some [MISC Islamic  ] schools , students are being indoctrinated into non-Western modes of thinking , which makes them prime recruiting targets for violent extremists. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Anne-Bert Dijkstra  ] , [ORG Dutch Education Inspectorate  ] , recently told [PER Emboff  ] that regular monitoring had not found any [MISC Islamic  ] schools to be teaching anti-Western ideas . 
In a 2003 review of [MISC Islamic  ] schools , the [ORG Inspectorate  ] did note concern that several schools were too passive in promoting social values . 
This has resulted in the implementation this year of expanded legislation requiring all schools to actively promote integration and good citizenship programs . 
Schools' efforts to promote social cohesion are now part of the [ORG Inspectorate  ] 's regular monitoring. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In a separate exchange with [ORG Emboffs  ] , [MISC Islamic  ] school principals noted how some ethnic [MISC Muslim  ] staff and principals were still adjusting to a life in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , while simultaneously attempting to teach the same to their students . 
[PER Alderman Fatima Elatik  ] has also noted that primary schools in her district of [LOC Amsterdam  ] have parent rooms where non-Dutch speaking parents can attend [MISC Dutch  ] language classes , meet other parents , and learn how to become more involved in their children 's education . 
SEGREGATION PART OF PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM ? ----------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) With only 4 percent of ethnic [MISC Muslim  ] students attending [MISC Islamic  ] schools , it is difficult to argue that these schools are the significant cause of segregation in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
However , many experts do view the 550 black schools in the country ( which the [MISC Dutch  ] define as having over 50 percent minority enrollment , mostly as the result of segregated neighborhoods ) as contributing to defacto segregation . 
Such schools are mostly located in larger cities and represent about six percent of all schools in the country . 
CONTINUING [MISC EMBASSY  ] OUTREACH --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Building on contacts made at a recent luncheon , [ORG Emboffs  ] recently visited [LOC Rotterdam  ] 's [PER Ibn Ghaldoun  ] , the largest [MISC Muslim  ] high school in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The visit included discussions with school administrators on how to build a long-lasting relationship between the [MISC Embassy  ] and the school , whose growing student population has resulted in plans to open a new high school in The [ORG Hague  ] . 
[ORG Emboffs  ] also shared with students and faculty donated maps , books on [MISC American  ] history and literature , and a [MISC CD-ROM  ] for use in the school library. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) School administrators noted with approval that the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] was the first foreign embassy in the country to visit the school . 
Students asked pointed questions about anti-Muslim sentiment in the [LOC U.S.  ] , but were clearly happy with the opportunity to speak with [LOC U.S.  ] representatives . 
One student questioned whether [ORG Emboffs  ] had been afraid to visit the school given widespread anti-U.S. sentiment -- a clear sign that additional outreach is needed . 
As a follow-on , [PER Ibn Ghaldoun  ] students visited the [MISC Embassy  ] in April . 
[PER Ibn Ghaldoun  ] 's [MISC English  ] department is also developing a proposal for follow-up activities with the [LOC Embassy.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Emboffs  ] have also visited the [ORG Islamic University of Rotterdam  ] ( [ORG IUR  ] ) , one of two privately-funded [MISC Islamic  ] universities in the country that focus on religious training of imams and counselors . 
Additional visits are planned .
