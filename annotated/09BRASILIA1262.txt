( C ) Summary: A six-member [MISC Brazilian  ] Congressional delegation traveled to [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] September 30 to October 2 to support the [MISC Brazilian  ] community in [LOC Honduras  ] and met with [PER Zelaya  ] and [PER Micheletti  ] government officials . 
According to two members of the delegation , [PER Zelaya  ] appeared to be " fragile " and perhaps not completely lucid . 
Only four members of the delegation met with [PER Micheletti  ] , who affirmed that there had been no coup against [PER Zelaya  ] and all of the government , s repressive measures were taken to protect the population . 
In meetings with [MISC PolOffs  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] and [LOC Recife  ] this month the delegation was unable to define a strategy or provide recommendations for [LOC Brazil  ] to help diffuse the [LOC Honduras  ] crisis , which parallels the lack of planning and vision seen in the [PER Lula  ] administration and [MISC Brazilian  ] Ministry of [ORG Foreign Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) on the issue ( Reftel ) . 
At the broadest level , this reflects the fact that [LOC Brazil  ] is in the unaccustomed position of being at the center of a crisis outside its historical sphere of influence . 
End summary. -------------------------------------- [LOC BRAZIL  ] CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION VISITS [LOC HONDURAS  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Six [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] ( equivalent to [ORG United States House of Representatives  ] ) members traveled to [LOC Honduras  ] September 30 to October 2 to visit the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and met with [PER Zelaya  ] and [PER Micheletti  ] government officials . 
The delegation included four opposition members--Raul [PER Jungmann  ] ( [MISC PPS-PE  ] ) , [PER Bruno Araujo  ] ( [MISC PSDB-PE  ] ) , [PER Ivan Valente  ] ( [ORG PSOL-SP  ] ) , and [PER Marcondes Gadelha  ] ( [MISC PSB-PB  ] ) --and two members of the ruling party , [PER Janeta Pieta Rocha  ] ( [ORG PT-SP  ] ) and [PER Mauricio Rands  ] ( [MISC PT-PE  ] ) --all of whom serve in the [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] ( [ORG CREDN  ] ) in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] . 
In meetings with [LOC Recife  ] [MISC PolOffs  ] and [LOC Brasilia  ] Poloffs [ORG Congress  ] members emphasized that the main goal of their trip was to support the [MISC Brazilian  ] community in [LOC Honduras  ] and convey to the [PER Micheletti  ] government that [LOC Honduras  ] must respect the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and staff . 
[PER Rocha  ] and [PER Jungmann  ] said there are approximate 600 [MISC Brazilians  ] living in [LOC Honduras.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] did not fully support the delegation , s mission . 
[PER Jungmann  ] said that the Ministry [MISC Foreign Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) did not like the idea of having members of [ORG Congress  ] dealing with a diplomatic issue . 
[PER Jungmann  ] explained that the [ORG MRE  ] tried to block their trip and even the President of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , [PER Michel Temer  ] , heavily lobbied the delegation not to travel . 
According to both [PER Jungmann  ] and [PER Rocha  ] , they all had to pay their own way from [LOC El Salvador  ] to [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] , otherwise they would not have been able to make the trip. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Rocha  ] described the situation in [LOC Honduras  ] as worrisome . 
She was concerned with the level of repression exerted by the government because [PER Micheletti  ] was " ruling with a firm hand . 
" There was a curfew being enforced and the media was being censored , she said , in addition to the harassing measures [PER Rocha  ] said the [PER Micheletti  ] government and security forces were employing against the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy.  ] -------------------------------------- MEETINGS WITH ZELAYA AND [PER MICHELETTI  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Both [PER Jungmann  ] and [PER Rocha  ] recounted their meetings in [LOC Honduras  ] in general terms . 
[PER Jungmann  ] said the delegation first met with the [ORG Honduran Supreme Court  ] , which told the [MISC Brazilians  ] that [PER Zelaya  ] , s removal from power was [ORG Constitutional  ] . 
The delegation was successful in visiting the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] and was well received . 
According to [PER Jungmann  ] , the [ORG Embassy  ] , s employees were very grateful and felt that the [ORG GOB  ] had not abandoned them . 
There are currently only three [MISC Brazilian  ] employees at the [ORG Embassy  ] , and only one is a diplomat . 
[PER Rocha  ] expressed her appreciation for the [LOC United States  ] Embassy , s assistance to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] , which included their role in negotiations with the [PER Micheletti  ] government and food deliveries. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The delegation also met with the [ORG Honduran National Assembly  ] and opened a dialog between legislatures in [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Honduras  ] , according to [PER Rocha  ] , who said " we as parliamentarians can demand a certain parliamentary diplomacy . 
" [PER Rocha  ] said they made it clear to the [MISC Honduran  ] [ORG Congress  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] did not expect or plan [PER Zelaya  ] , s return to [LOC Honduras  ] and refuge in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
But , because of [LOC Brazil  ] , s negative experience with a military dictatorship , in which so many [MISC Brazilian  ] lives were saved when other countries gave them refugee , [LOC Brazil  ] could not have turned down [PER Zelaya  ] . 
[PER Rocha  ] added that the meeting was interesting since many of the [MISC Honduran  ] members of [ORG Congress  ] were involved with the ousting of [PER Zelaya  ] . 
The [MISC Honduran  ] members conveyed to the [MISC Brazilians  ] their belief that [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] had partnering roles and positions on [PER Zelaya  ] , s return , and the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation worked hard to explain otherwise , [PER Rocha  ] said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Regarding their meeting with [PER Zelaya  ] , [PER Rocha  ] said he was " fragile " but holding up well . 
[PER Jungmann  ] said the meeting was interesting but that [PER Zelaya  ] may not be completely lucid . 
[PER Rocha  ] explained that the [PER Micheletti  ] government was employing a lot of " psychological interference " against [PER Zelaya  ] , which she listed as light and sound interference and the constant presence of snipers around the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[PER Rocha  ] said [PER Zelaya  ] thanked the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation for their visit and thanked [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] for his support . 
[PER Zelaya  ] told the [MISC Brazilians  ] all he wants is an electoral process without interruptions before the November election and to step down from office in January. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Rocha  ] and [PER Rands  ] did not attend the meeting with [PER Micheletti  ] . 
[PER Rocha  ] said it was not a difficult decision for her to miss the meeting because she ideologically could not meet with a " golpista " ( coup-maker ) and the [PER Micheletti  ] appointment was the last on their schedule . 
[PER Jungmann  ] said that in the meeting , [PER Micheletti  ] tried to explain that there had been no coup , that every process had been respected and done in line with the [MISC Honduran  ] constitution , with the exception of how the military removed [PER Zelaya  ] from office . 
[PER Micheletti  ] told [PER Jungmann  ] it was the [MISC Honduran  ] military that saw the need to remove [PER Zelaya  ] from the country to prevent a civil war . 
[PER Micheletti  ] also mentioned that martial law was implemented to protect the population , and avoid serious confrontations . 
[PER Micheletti  ] told [PER Jungmann  ] that the military is not controlling the private sector or government institutions , which is a common occurrence following a true military coup. -------------------------------------- MUDDLED GOB MESSAGE AND POLICY -------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Jungmann  ] and [PER Rocha  ] viewed the trip as a success but , while the delegation was united in its primary goal--to support the [MISC Brazilian  ] community and [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Honduras--they  ] appeared factionalized in their intention and views for the rest of the trip . 
[PER Jungmann  ] said the delegation did not speak as one voice and as the leader of the group there were some uncomfortable moments when he had to manage different political views . 
But , [PER Jungmann  ] said , that was to be expected since he put together a delegation with members from different parties . 
[PER Jungmann  ] said he is working on a trip report to be presented to the [ORG Chamber ,  ] s [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] , but did not say when it would be completed. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Both [PER Jungmann  ] and [PER Rocha  ] reiterated that they believe [LOC Brazil  ] was correct in allowing [PER Zelaya  ] to enter their [ORG Embassy  ] and that the [ORG GOB  ] did not have any prior knowledge or warning of [PER Zelaya  ] , s return to [LOC Honduras  ] . 
[PER Jungmann  ] , however , made it a point to say that [LOC Brazil  ] should have prevented [PER Zelaya  ] from using the [ORG Embassy  ] as a pulpit to stir up his supporters and cause problems in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
[PER Jungmann  ] recounted that the most delicate and embarrassing moment of the trip was when the delegation was shown a DVD with images of protestors holding banners saying , " [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] have violated [LOC Honduras  ] , sovereignty , " images that had been broadcast throughout the country many times . 
[PER Jungmann  ] went so far as to say that [LOC Brazil  ] should apologize to [LOC Honduras  ] , an idea he said was completely rejected by other members in the delegation , the [ORG MRE  ] , and other members of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies Foreign Relations Committee  ] . 
He said , " I knew my proposal would not be accepted , but one has to express what he or she thinks . 
" He said , " the [MISC Brazilian  ] government acted correctly when it decided to host [PER Zelaya  ] , but our diplomacy made a serious mistake in allowing him to interact with the population via our [ORG Embassy  ] . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Although she did not define a position and plan for [LOC Brazil  ] in the crisis , [PER Rocha  ] expressed the need for the [LOC United States  ] to provide greater clarity on its position on the situation , asserting that the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] is evidently divided over the issue . 
[PER Rocha  ] added that she hopes that the international community exerts greater voice in the [MISC Honduran  ] crisis because [LOC Latin America  ] has seen these types of standstills erode the progress made to protect civil rights in the region. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The congressional delegation , s somewhat chaotic and inconclusive visit to [LOC Honduras  ] mirrors the GOB , s muddled policy toward the crisis in [LOC Honduras  ] ( Reftel ) . 
The matter was further complicated by the differing views within the delegation and confusion over which players in [LOC Honduras  ] to engage . 
More than anything , the lack of decisive [MISC Brazilian  ] action on the issue and the heated public debate on [LOC Brazil  ] , s role ( [LOC Sao Paulo  ] septel ) reflect the fact that [LOC Brazil  ] finds itself in an unaccustomed and uncomfortable position , at the political center and in the public spotlight of a crisis outside its historical sphere of influence .
