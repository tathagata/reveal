04 [LOC NAIROBI  ] 5341 Classified By: POL/Couns [PER Michael J. Fitzpatrick  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( B , C , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: The absence of convictions in high-profile cocaine cases and the [MISC New Year  ] 's Eve murder of the lead police officer investigating drug trafficking through the [LOC Port  ] of [LOC Mombasa  ] ( [LOC East Africa  ] 's regional maritime hub ) amply demonstrate that international narcotics trafficking rings have made major inroads into [LOC Kenya  ] , corrupting , bribing , intimidating and killing their way into position to operate with relative impunity . 
Little progress has been made in exposing those behind the shipment of , or providing political protection for , the record one ton-plus shipment of cocaine seized here in December 2004 . 
The lackluster performance of legal and law enforcement authorities in the cases , the increasingly whispered fear that national politicos are providing protection for the ring , and now the murder of Officer [PER Hassan Abdillahi  ] , sharply undermine post 's confidence that [MISC Kenyan  ] authorities are serious about combating international narcotics trafficking . 
And despite continuing concerns of its possible diversion back onto the streets , [MISC Kenyan  ] authorities are no closer to even deciding how or when to destroy that cocaine that actually has been seized . 
Post recommends it is time [LOC Washington  ] turns up the heat . 
END SUMMARY. ----------------- BUNGLING THE BUST ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The then-largest recorded seizure of cocaine in [LOC Africa  ] occurred in [LOC Kenya  ] in December 2004 , with simultaneous seizures of containers -- totaling more than one ton of cocaine -- in [LOC Nairobi  ] and the coastal town of [LOC Malindi  ] . 
This followed the interception in the [LOC Netherlands  ] of a related consignment of cocaine ( of several hundred kilos ) believed shipped from [LOC Kenya  ] by seaborne container . 
[MISC Dutch  ] authorities arrested several persons , including the son of a former [MISC Kenyan  ] Member of Parliament ( [ORG MP  ] ) . 
[MISC Kenyan  ] authorities separately arrested 12 [MISC Kenyans  ] and 2 [MISC Italians  ] and charged them with involvement of the various shipments seized by the [MISC Dutch  ] or [MISC Kenyan  ] authorities . 
( NOTE: Initial information provided to the [MISC Kenyan  ] authorities by [MISC European  ] partners indicated exactly where " several tons " of cocaine was to be found in [LOC Kenya  ] . 
When the [MISC Kenyan  ] authorities finally did move on the information more than one week later , several implicated had calmly departed the country , and only one ton was recovered . 
END NOTE . 
) In the year since then , there has been minimal progress in the investigation -- and much cause for concern. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) During a December 19 meeting with [MISC Emboffs  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed a high level of frustration with the poor handling of the investigation and prosecution by the [ORG Kenya Police Service  ] and the [ORG Department of Public Prosecutions  ] . 
Seven suspects stand accused of trafficking the cocaine seized December 2004 in both [LOC Malindi  ] ( 837.5 Kg ) and [LOC Nairobi  ] ( 304 Kg ) . 
Following months of mounting frustration with the prosecution , s failure to introduce the drugs into court as evidence ( without which there is no case ) , Chief Magistrate [PER Aggrey Muchelule  ] had ordered the court to visit the warehouse where the drugs were stored . 
( NOTE: The drugs are technically under the court 's jurisdiction , but were turned over to Police Commission [PER Ali  ] for safeguarding at a presumably secure , undisclosed location . 
One of the only three police officers said to have keys to the storage facility was murdered this year under highly suspicious circumstances ; several of his immediate family members have since also been killed . 
The police balked at moving a ton of cocaine to the court -- or of having the court come to the " undisclosed " location . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) But the Court finally had its way , and helicopters ferried the drugs to and from a neutral location for the Court to inspect . 
The Court 's October visit ( with press in tow ) , however , did little to allay concerns that the drug haul may have been tampered with or that the drugs were finding their way back into the market . 
( NOTE: The arrests of a continuing stream of [MISC Kenyan  ] Airways employees at [LOC London  ] 's [LOC Heathrow Airport  ] for smuggling cocaine on flights from [LOC Kenya  ] points ominously at the latter . 
The most recent arrest occurred just this week . 
END NOTE . 
) Upon viewing the seizure , defense attorneys alleged discrepancies in the weight and color of the displayed packets from those originally seized . 
Despite [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] repeated offers to assist in the analysis and testing of the seized goods , and to help trace the network responsible for the shipment , [MISC Kenyan  ] authorities have kept all foreign missions at arms' length . 
To date , only a small fraction of the seizure has been tested -- in private , by the [MISC Kenyan  ] Police . 
Controversy remains surrounding the manner and timing of destruction of the drugs ; neither the court nor the government has a plan to confirm that what is still being warehoused is cocaine ( and not flour or some other substitute ) , much less a plan for publicly destroying the seized drugs . 
The court case is scheduled to resume before Magistrate Muchelule January 15 , 2006. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Kenya  ] , s confused and conflicting legal provisions on the analysis requirements for narcotics seizures also hinder the investigation . 
As a result of [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] pressure , the [LOC Nairobi  ] branch of the [ORG United Nations Office  ] on Drug and Crime worked with the [ORG State Law Office  ] and the [ORG Department of Public Prosecutions  ] to develop a protocol to the [ORG Narcotic Drugs  ] and [ORG Psychotropic Substances Regulations  ] on the seizure , analysis , and disposal to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of these seizures . 
Drafted months ago , the protocol has yet to come into force . 
The Attorney General must still draft , and then table an amendment before Parliament , which must then vote a change in one of the governing laws before the AG can even issue regulations to implement the protocol . 
But Parliament has prorogued by the President ( for unrelated reasons ) until at least March ) too late to assist in the prosecution of at least one of the cocaine cases. ------------------------------------- INCOMPETENCE ? 
LACK OF WILL ? 
OR WORSE ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) In the first of the two cases being pursued in [LOC Kenya  ] , seven suspects were acquitted November 18 of drug trafficking charges connected to the shipment of drugs originating from [LOC Kenya  ] seized in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The presiding magistrate , [PER Rose Ougo  ] , sharply criticized the police and the prosecution for their failure to build a case connecting the [MISC Kenyan  ] defendants with the drugs , or to even establish that the substance seized was a narcotic . 
[PER Muchelule  ] privately complained to [MISC Emboffs  ] that [MISC Kenyan  ] legal and law enforcement authorities did not liase with authorities in the [LOC Netherlands  ] to even confirm that what was seized was cocaine . 
Nor , he said , do they cooperate in the [MISC Dutch  ] investigation of the case . 
[PER Ougo  ] was reportedly enraged that evidence she understood had been collected was not presented in Court . 
( COMMENT: Though he did not say so explicitly , we took his comments to imply that both [PER Muchelule  ] and [PER Ougo  ] were aware of quiet rumors that [MISC Dutch  ] phone records implicating [MISC Kenyan  ] politicians with the traffickers , among other items , had been stripped out of the prosecutor 's case file . 
END COMMENT . 
) [PER Ougo  ] , [PER Muchelule  ] said , had no choice but to dismiss the charges for lack of evidence . 
In her decision , the magistrate issued scathing statements accusing legal and law enforcement authorities of conducing shoddy investigations . 
The handling of the case was so deficient that the magistrate questioned the seriousness of the Attorney General , s commitment to combating drug trafficking . 
( [ORG Post  ] is seeking a copy of [PER Ougo  ] 's ruling , which has yet to be published . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] decried to Poloff December 1 that the separation of the two December 2004 cocaine cases was a ruse to prevent successful investigation or prosecution . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the move &buried8 evidence of an international trafficking ring operating ( with official sanction ) i [LOC Kenya  ] by denying the authorities the ability to make a legal connection between the cocaine seized in [LOC Kenya  ] and the shipment sized in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , those being prosecuted now are mere scapegoats , while the real guilty parties ( including [PER Christopher Murungaru  ] , who was Security Minister at the time of the initial seizure , later moved to Transportation ( which oversees the ports ) , and only removed from the cabinet last November ) enjoy impunity. --------------------------------------------- --- MURDER OF OFFICER INVESTIGATING DRUG TRAFFICKING --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Further undermining confidence in the ability of law enforcement , [LOC Kenya  ] [ORG Ports Authority District Criminal Investigations  ] Officer ( [ORG DCIO  ] ) [PER Hassan Abdillahi  ] was murdered this past December 31 . 
[ORG Criminal Investigations Division  ] ( [ORG CID  ] ) Chief [PER Joseph Kamau  ] publicly stated that [PER Abdillahi  ] 's murder may have been linked to his investigations into organized narcotics trafficking and related criminal activity through the [LOC Port  ] of [LOC Mombasa  ] . 
( He reportedly had been investigating the theft of 39 shipping containers from a secure port facility . 
Press reports allege that [ORG Interpol  ] had tipped [PER Abdillahi  ] to the possible presence of another major cocaine shipment in the identified containers . 
) [PER Abdillahi  ] was perceived by a number of Embassy personnel as being deeply committed to tackling fraud and drug trafficking at the [LOC Port  ] of [LOC Mombasa  ] . 
However , a [MISC British  ] diplomat revealed to PolCouns January 5 that [PER Abdillahi  ] might have had close ties to the late drug baron [PER Ibrahim Akasha  ] and his family . 
( NOTE: The [PER Akasha  ] family long controlled drugs ( then mostly hashish , heroin , cannibis ) along through [LOC Mombasa  ] to [LOC Europe  ] , with [MISC Kenyan  ] police , judges and politicians all bought or intimidated . 
[PER Akasha  ] was gunned down in [LOC Amsterdam  ] in May 2000 . 
One of [PER Akasha  ] 's sons was gunned down in 2002 in [LOC Mombasa  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) Thus , goes this theory , with the [PER Akasha  ] family 's wings clipped and now supplanted by upstarts , a falling out among thieves over control of the port could have been behind [PER Abdillahi  ] 's aggressive investigations -- and his killing . 
Meanwhile , it is undisputed that cocaine consumption among [MISC Kenyan  ] coastal youths has soared in the past several years. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) A number of suspects have been arrested for questioning about [PER Abdillahi  ] 's death . 
Among them: four brothers of ( known thug and rich-far-beyond-visible-means ) [ORG Juja MP  ] [PER William Kabogo  ] , who is also owner of a port container transshipment company . 
( One of those brothers arrested had been arrested the day before [PER Abdillahi  ] was killed , having been charged with the theft of the 39 suspect containers . 
) Curiously , the Chief of Inspections for [ORG CID  ] avowed to Embassy Legal Attach January 4 that the police have little to no leads in the case . 
In a December 16 conversation with PolCouns , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated baldly that [LOC Mombasa  ] [ORG CID  ] had uncovered clear evidence of high-level political protection of corruption and drugs trafficking in the port . 
His [ORG CID  ] sources , he said , were very nervous about digging further , fearing that it would get them killed . 
( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
) [ORG Mandera Central MP  ] ( and Shadow Finance Minister ) [PER Billow Kerrow  ] publicly questioned the police , s ability to properly investigate the killing , alleging that members of the police themselves may have been behind the shooting , and called for international assistance to investigate the crime . 
Former [PER DPP Murgor  ] has made similar calls . 
The government has yet to comment publicly -- other than Police Commissioner [PER Ali  ] 's urging the public not to speculate on any possible narcotics or corruption as being the motive for [PER Abdillahi  ] 's murder. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) COMMENT: The mishandling of the cocaine seizure cases and the brazen murder of the [ORG DCIO  ] raise strong suspicions about the integrity of legal and law enforcement authorities to investigate or prosecute the case . 
( Indeed , simply shipping cocaine in multi-ton loads suggests: a ) that this was not a virgin voyage , but one which employed a well-used route , and b ) a route the shippers were comfortable was protected from interception . 
) Nor can one be assured that the seized drugs remain properly safeguarded . 
As long as the shipment remains undestroyed , pressure to resell it will only continue . 
As noted ref A , there have long been reasons to be concerned that high-ranking [MISC Kenyan  ] government and/or police officials are either protecting those involved or are themselves involved in actual involvement in drug trafficking activities . 
( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) [ORG Post  ] presented a diplomatic note to the MFA January 6 , renewing the offer of [LOC U.S.  ] government assistance in investigating the December 2004 cocaine seizure case and offering to assist in the investigation of [PER Abdillahi  ] , s murder . 
[ORG Post  ] recommends a letter ( to be prepared by [ORG Post  ] ) from either [ORG INL A/S Patterson  ] or [ORG DEA  ] Administrator [ORG Tandy  ] be sent to the [MISC Kenyan  ] Attorney General , Minister of Internal Security and Police Commissioner , reiterating [LOC U.S.  ] offers of assistance and pressing the [MISC Kenyans  ] to invigorate their investigation efforts . 
[ORG Post  ] also seeks to amend its previous submission for the annual [ORG INCSR  ] . 
It is clear that only a combination of public and private pressure , well coordinated with our diplomatic allies , will move this government to even attempt to kick its increasingly dangerous drug habit .
