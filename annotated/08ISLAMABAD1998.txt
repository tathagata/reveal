Patterson  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: On May 26 , [PER Codel Schiff  ] -- [ORG U.S. Representatives  ] [PER Adam Schiff  ] ( [MISC D-CA  ] ) and [PER Allyson Schwartz  ] ( [MISC D-PA  ] ) -- met with [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) Co-Chairman [PER Asif Zardari  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Shah Mehmood Qureshi  ] , [ORG NSA  ] Ambassador [PER Mahmud Ali Durrani  ] and [ORG Ambassador-designate  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Husain Haqqani  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] thanked the [PER Codel  ] for [ORG USG  ] support of credible national elections . 
As he has previously , he committed [LOC Pakistan  ] to the war on terror , insisting this was [ORG Pakistan’s  ] fight . 
He argued more needed to be done by the [LOC U.S.  ] and international community to promote economic development in the frontier . 
Building on that point , [PER Zardari  ] suggested a new blend of [ORG USG  ] assistance , increasing aid to “civilian forces” like the police and promoting civilian engagement . 
He warned that public opinion was unalterably against President [PER Pervez Musharraf  ] and that , for the sake of the new [MISC GOP  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] needed to contemplate an “honorable exit.” End summary. “We are because of you.” ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Meeting May 26 in [LOC Islamabad  ] , [ORG U.S. Representatives  ] [PER Schiff  ] and [PER Schwartz  ] met with [ORG PPP  ] leader [PER Zardari  ] and his foreign policy team . 
[PER Zardari  ] thanked the [ORG USG  ] for its support of credible parliamentary elections , which brought his party to power: “We are here because of you.” [PER Zardari  ] noted that his late wife , [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] , maintained close relations with many of member of [ORG Congress  ] , and he encouraged more codel visits to [LOC Pakistan  ] to improve mutual understanding . 
[ORG Pakistan’s War  ] -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As he has before , [PER Zardari  ] stressed that the [ORG Global War on Terror  ] ( [ORG GWOT  ] ) was “Pakistan’s war.” The fall of [MISC Bhutto’s  ] second government was financed by [PER Osama bin Laden  ] , he claimed , noting that she and her father [PER Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto  ] were assassinated by religious extremists . 
But counterterrorism initiatives lacked popular [MISC Pakistani  ] support , [PER Zardari  ] lamented , and terrorism fostered profiteers who had an interest in the struggle continuing. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] argued that [LOC Pakistan  ] Muslim [ORG League-N  ] ( [ORG PML-N  ] ) leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] had “walked into the vacuum” as opposition leader when [PER Bhutto  ] was assassinated just weeks before national elections . 
For stability , however , the [ORG PPP  ] continued to cooperate with the [ORG PML-N  ] at the federal and [LOC Punjab  ] provincial levels. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] described the general distrust of the [LOC U.S.  ] by the public and in political circles , “fearing you will leave us again.” Post 9/11 , however , he believed this was no longer an option ; the [ORG USG  ] would have to make a commitment of decades , calling for a [ORG Marshall Plan  ] for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
There were already success stories , noting that his progressive [ORG PPP  ] even won a [ORG National Assembly  ] seat from the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] advocated attacking the root cause of radical insurgency: economic under-development . 
He lobbied the Representatives to quickly take up and pass reconstruction opportunity zone ( ROZ ) legislation . 
There should be [LOC U.S.  ] tax breaks for companies producing “made in [MISC Pakistan”  ] products , noting that [ORG Pakistan’s  ] textile industry would be more competition to other countries than to [LOC U.S.  ] manufacturers . 
Without creating more jobs , [LOC Pakistan  ] just could not match the taliban’s reported [ORG USD  ] 300 per month to tribals in the frontier regions . 
The tribals , though , wanted peace , [PER Zardari  ] claimed . 
A [ORG New Blend  ] ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Asked if he felt [ORG USG  ] assistance over the past seven years had been military heavy , [PER Zardari  ] noted that democracy promotion had been the smallest component of aid . 
He quickly added that military aid was still badly needed but more should also go to “civilian forces , ” e.g. , police . 
[ORG USG  ] assistance should support social development , e.g. , more higher education scholarships to [MISC Pakistanis  ] studying in the [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00001998 002 OF 002 [LOC U.S.  ] All in all , he wanted to see more civilian engagement than military-to-military exchanges . 
[PER Zardari  ] also said he wanted the [ORG U.N  ] . 
( with support from the [LOC U.S.  ] and other western countries ) to establish a compensatory fund for the families of the victims of terrorist acts . 
On [PER Musharraf  ] ------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Transitioning , [PER Zardari  ] blamed President [PER Pervez Musharraf  ] for not taking enough responsibility for the [ORG GWOT  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] ; the public , instead , believed [MISC Pakistanis  ] were dying for the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Zardari  ] then said , “Anti-U.S. feelings will go away when the old faces go away , ” adding that the [ORG USG  ] should no longer rely on just [PER Musharraf  ] in fighting radicalism. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] admitted that his public statements in the last week had been more anti-Musharraf . 
He was afraid that he and his party were losing popular support , while [PER Nawaz  ] was able to pretend to be the populist by supporting restoration of the pre-November 3 judges. “But he doesn’t want the Chief Justice ( [PER Iftikhar Chaudhry  ] ) back in , just [PER Musharraf  ] out.” [PER Zardari  ] revealed that he hoped to discuss privately with [PER Musharraf  ] the possibility of an “honorable exit” and believed Chief of Army Staff ( [ORG COAS  ] ) [PER Ashfaq Kayani  ] would stay out of such political discussions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] feared , however , that [PER Musharraf  ] was misguided by “smooth-talking advisors , ” who were protecting their own personal interests . 
The public was against the President , the institution and the man , adding the [ORG PPP  ] needed to “change the face of [MISC Pakistan”  ] or it too would be kicked out of power. “We won’t act without consulting with you , ” [PER Zardari  ] concluded. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER Codel Schiff  ] did not clear this cable .
