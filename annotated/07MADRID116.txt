End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a January 16 introductory courtesy call on [PER Angel Acebes  ] , Secretary General of the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , the [ORG DCM  ] reviewed the current areas of close cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] in [ORG NATO  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] discussed our close cooperation now and particularly in the past with the [ORG PP  ] and the [PER Aznar  ] government , but said that it was important for us to now work with the current GOS on a variety of issues . 
[PER Acebes  ] replied that he understood this perfectly , indeed it was good for him as a [MISC Spaniard  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] have good working relations , but believed that bilateral relations would improve even more in the future when the [ORG PP  ] returns to power . 
The [ORG DCM  ] noted the continued range and frequency of high-level contacts between the Embassy and the [ORG PP  ] , including at the [LOC Ambassadorial  ] level. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] asked [PER Acebes  ] for his thoughts on the contentious debate between President [PER Zapatero  ] and [ORG PP  ] leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] that had taken place in [MISC Spanish  ] Parliament the day before ( reported separately in [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) , and what has become the defining political issue of the day in [LOC Spain  ] , the GOS' policies towards the terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] . 
[PER Acebes  ] stated that [PER Rajoy  ] had indeed been very severe in his criticisms of the President , because this issue was of the most severe importance to the [MISC Spanish  ] people . 
[PER Acebes  ] then added that [PER Rajoy  ] had criticized [PER Zapatero  ] 's anti-terrorism policy , " not for the mere purpose of Parliamentary debate or to win elections , but because of the party 's strongly-held principles . 
" Despite [PER Zapatero  ] 's calls for all of [LOC Spain  ] 's democratic political parties to join a united anti-terrorist pact , [PER Acebes  ] said that the [ORG PP  ] would not join in any coalition with parties that support continued dialogue with [ORG ETA  ] or political participation with [ORG ETA  ] 's outlawed political wing [ORG Batasuna  ] . 
[PER Acebes  ] said his party fears that a broad pact would also broaden and weaken its terms to accommodate [PER Zapatero  ] , s left-wing coalition partners and ultimately give him the wiggle room for a future negotiated settlement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Acebes  ] and the [ORG DCM  ] then touched on a full range of foreign policy issues related to [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] briefed [PER Acebes  ] on the impetus behind President [PER Bush  ] 's new strategy for the way forward in [LOC Iraq  ] that will include increases in the number of [LOC U.S.  ] troops in [LOC Baghdad  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] economic assistance . 
The [ORG DCM  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] have agreed to move beyond past disagreements over the war and we continue to appreciate [LOC Spain  ] 's continued economic assistance to the country . 
[PER Acebes  ] agreed that the Coalition cannot afford to fail in [LOC Iraq  ] and expressed his hope that this change in strategy will serve to get a handle on security in [LOC Baghdad  ] and [ORG al-Anbar Province  ] . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Acebes  ] was in agreement on the importance of the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG E.U.  ] maintaining a united front against that country 's nuclear ambitions , and posited that [LOC Iran  ] likely represented the " crisis to come . 
" [PER Acebes  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] should work within the [ORG E.U.  ] to ensure that a hard line is maintained . 
[PER Acebes  ] expressed his concern with the antics of [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] during his recent visit to [LOC Nicaragua.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A discussion of the current situation in [LOC Cuba  ] wrapped up the meeting , and [PER Acebes  ] stated that [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's health prognosis is likely very bad . 
Whatever the truth behind recent conflicting reports in [MISC Spanish  ] newspapers on the status of [PER Castro  ] 's health ( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) , [PER Acebes  ] believes that we are already in a " post-Fidel era , " and agreed with the [ORG DCM  ] that [PER Raul Castro  ] and other senior regime figures are right now gauging the international community 's reaction to events in the country before deciding how to proceed . 
[PER Acebes  ] stated that for this reason , it is vital for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG E.U.  ] to [ORG MADRID  ] 00000116 002 OF 002 speak with one voice . 
The [ORG DCM  ] reiterated the importance of the [ORG E.U.  ] making a statement of strong support for a democratic [LOC Cuba  ] , even if this statement is not made jointly with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and [PER Acebes  ] agreed . 
The [ORG DCM  ] thanked the [ORG PP  ] for raising a Parliamentary motion December 19 calling for unity among [MISC Spanish  ] political parties in supporting a democratic transition in [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] C ) . 
Although Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] had signaled to [ORG PP  ] Parliamentarians that a common position on [LOC Cuba  ] could be negotiated , the [ORG PP  ] measure was defeated by the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) and its far left coalition partners . 
[PER Acebes  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that the [ORG PP  ] intends to bring this resolution up again in the coming weeks and will probably propose a similar motion in the [MISC European  ] Parliament , where it expects greater success . 
( Note: Following this meeting , the [ORG DCM  ] met with [ORG PP  ] foreign policy advisor Moragas and with the leadership of President [PER Aznar  ] 's think tank , [ORG FAES  ] , to suggest [ORG FAES  ] and the Embassy coordinate on a major seminar on [LOC Cuba  ] in [LOC Madrid  ] in the coming months . 
[ORG FAES  ] officials were receptive to the idea and undertook to give a definitive answer to the [ORG DCM  ] soon .
