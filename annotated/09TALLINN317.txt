[PER Lukashenko  ] , assuring [PER Paet  ] that [LOC Estonia  ] was not his enemy , spent the bulk of their 90-minute meeting lashing out at [LOC Russia  ] with claims that [LOC Minsk  ] may be forced to recognize [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] this winter in order to get cheap gas from [LOC Russia  ] , and that [LOC Russia  ] had instigated the war in [LOC Georgia  ] .

End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) On October 20 - 21 , FM [PER Paet  ] led a delegation of 30 [MISC Estonian  ] business people ( Estonia’s largest ever business delegation ) to [LOC Minsk  ] .

Lukashenko: “Estonia is Not Our Enemy , ” But Maybe [LOC Russia  ] Is --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Civil Society: [PER Paet’s  ] meeting with [PER Lukashenko  ] was scheduled to last 30 minutes , but went 90 minutes and only ended when [PER Paet  ] said he needed to catch his flight . 
[PER Roos  ] said Lukashenko’s office told him this was only the third time that a meeting with [PER Lukashenko  ] had gone longer than planned ( the others being [PER Javier Solana  ] and [PER Benito Ferrero-Waldner  ] ) . 
In the meeting [PER Paet  ] raised complaints from civil society leaders that political parties were not allowed to register or freely operate , and that security forces were increasingly using violence against demonstrators . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] replied that he and several members of the opposition had once been allies who “drank vodka and womanized together.” However , these people had turned against him ( [PER Lukashenko  ] ) after he refused to give them promotions . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] told [PER Paet  ] that the opposition in [LOC Belarus  ] would never unite , and only existed “to live off western grants.” Furthermore , [PER Lukashenko  ] claimed that he could halt the flow of grant money at any time , but that he saw no reason to do so , since the parties were “harmless.” Regarding civil society complaints of violence against them , [PER Lukashenko  ] stated the opposition should expect to get hurt when they attack the [LOC OMON  ] ( riot police ) . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] also claimed [LOC Belarus  ] has no political prisoners , but that common crooks join the opposition after they are arrested in order to claim political persecution . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] added that he did not want to be president , but was only acting to help the [MISC Belarusan  ] people . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] also repeated earlier claims that in the 2006 elections he actually received 93 percent of the vote , but reduced the final tally to 86 percent to make the vote more credible to the [MISC West.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER NATO:  ] [PER Lukashenko  ] told [PER Paet  ] that , despite Estonia’s membership in the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] , he did not consider [LOC Estonia  ] to be an enemy . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] also said that [LOC Latvia  ] , [LOC Lithuania  ] and [LOC Poland  ] were not threats to [LOC Belarus  ] , despite being [ORG NATO  ] members . 
[PER Paet  ] argued that [ORG NATO  ] should not be considered as an enemy , but according to [PER Roos  ] , [PER Lukashenko  ] did not buy it . 
[LOC TALLINN  ] 00000317 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) EU: [PER Lukashenko  ] also told [PER Paet  ] stated that the [MISC EU’s  ] “ridiculous sanctions” had not weakened [LOC Belarus  ] . 
In fact , [PER Lukashenko  ] told [PER Paet  ] he had specifically ordered his government , “to do nothing to please the [ORG EU”  ] before the [ORG EU  ] discusses extending sanctions at the November [ORG GAERC  ] . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] argued that he prefers [LOC Belarus  ] to be independent , and was particularly upset that the [ORG EU  ] has not given him credit for any reforms or for his non-recognition of [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] . 
He claimed that [LOC Ukraine  ] undertook numerous reforms to “please” the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] , but that now [LOC Ukraine  ] is no nearer membership in either organization and is in economic and political ruin . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] added that the [ORG EU  ] , “can sleep soundly at night , ” because [LOC Belarus  ] protects the [MISC EU’s  ] border from illegal immigrants . 
He lamented that the [ORG EU  ] does not give [LOC Belarus  ] any credit for this. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and [PER Venezuela:  ] [PER Lukashenko  ] claimed to [PER Paet  ] that [PER Saddam Hussein  ] called him in early 2003 , asking [PER Lukashenko  ] to negotiate peace with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] claimed [PER Hussein  ] was prepared to offer gas at half price , and had argued that [LOC Iraq  ] had no ties to al-Qaeda nor any [ORG WMD  ] . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] also claimed that [LOC Belarus  ] was forced to seek friendship with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Iran  ] to lessen [LOC Belarus’  ] energy dependence on [LOC Russia  ] . 
Those countries help [LOC Belarus  ] as much as they can , but [PER Lukashenko  ] lamented that his country is still dependent on [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Russia: Roos  ] told us that [PER Lukashenko  ] maintained an anti-Russian tone throughout the meeting . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] said he hoped [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] refuse to give permission to build the [MISC Nordstream  ] pipeline . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] would prefer to see [PER Yamal II  ] ( crossing [LOC Belarus  ] ) built , arguing it would cost one-tenth the price . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] also claimed he would likely be forced to recognize [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] this winter in order to get cheaper energy from [LOC Russia  ] . 
He also complained that [MISC Russian  ] media is full of falsifications . 
On [LOC Georgia  ] , [PER Lukashenko  ] claimed [LOC Russia  ] had planned the war years in advance and tricked [PER Saakashvili  ] into acting , and told [PER Paet Saakashvili  ] had invited him to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] was considering accepting this invitation , but had not yet done so since he did not want to annoy the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
Beleaguered [ORG Civil Society  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Paet  ] met with [ORG NGO  ] and political party representatives , who said the level of repression they face has worsened over the past six months . 
They reported that it has gotten even harder to get permission to demonstrate , that security services are more frequently using force to break up unsanctioned demonstrations , and that activists face violence more often after being arrested . 
The civil society group accused [LOC Russia  ] of propping up [PER Lukashenko  ] with cheap oil and gas , and claimed [LOC Russia  ] is trying to “Russify” [LOC Belarus  ] as it pushes [LOC Minsk  ] into accepting a union state . 
FM [PER Martynov  ] Defends Status Quo ----------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Paet  ] presented the civil society complaints to FM [PER Martynov  ] , who argued that [LOC Belarus  ] was reforming , but that reform takes time . 
[LOC TALLINN  ] 00000317 003 OF 003 [PER Martynov  ] claimed there was a debate within the [ORG GOB  ] between a faction that is pro-reform , and others that want to halt reforms since the [ORG EU  ] has not positively responded . 
[PER Martynov  ] reiterated Lukashenko’s complaints that [LOC Belarus  ] has not been properly thanked for refusing to recognize [LOC South Ossetia  ] , and has not gotten any credit from the [ORG EU  ] for decreasing its use of the death penalty . 
[PER Martynov  ] then accused the [ORG EU  ] of double standards , since sanctions are being lifted against [LOC Uzbekistan  ] but not against [LOC Belarus  ] . 
[PER Martynov  ] also said that [LOC Belarus  ] would upgrade its Consulate in [LOC Tallinn  ] to an Embassy in six to nine months , and that the [ORG GOB  ] wants to create an inter-governmental commission with [LOC Estonia  ] to discuss payment of pensions , social issues , tourism , and cultural issues. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG GOE  ] is an active supporter of democratic reform in [LOC Belarus  ] , even if [LOC Belarus  ] is not one of Estonia’s main foreign policy priorities ( which are [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Moldova  ] ) . 
The [MISC Estonian  ] MFA is providing 115,045 [MISC Euro  ] in scholarships to thirteen [MISC Belarusan  ] students removed from university for political reasons , and in 2008 gave 28,761 [MISC Euro  ] to the [ORG European Humanities University  ] for scholarships ( EHU is a private [MISC Belarusan  ] university currently operating in [LOC Vilnius  ] ) . 
In recent years [LOC Estonia  ] has granted political asylum to several young [MISC Belarusan  ] pro-democracy activists , such as [PER Pavel Morozow  ] of the [ORG Third Way NGO  ] . 
Estonia’s Charge in [LOC Minsk  ] told Pol Chief before his assignment that he intends to push hard for democratic transition in [LOC Minsk  ] . 
Given Estonia’s own transition experience , and the fact that [LOC Estonia  ] is not an “enemy” of [LOC Belarus  ] , the [MISC GOE’s  ] modest support and efforts could have some traction . 
We are actively engaged with the [ORG GOE  ] on ways we can maximize support to [LOC Belarus’  ] democratic opposition , and have made some useful connections ( at least for us ) to link up Embassies in [LOC Tallinn  ] and [LOC Minsk  ] with the [MISC Estonian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and now , the [MISC Estonian  ] Embassy in [LOC Minsk  ] . 
We hope to be able to reinforce our national efforts to promote change in [LOC Belarus  ] by triangulating , where we can , our assistance .
