( [ORG SBU  ] ) THE COUNTRY'S TIP SITUATION <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
What is ( are ) the source ( s ) of available information on human trafficking ? 
What plans are in place ( if any ) to undertake further documentation of human trafficking ? 
How reliable are these sources ? 
There is a serious deficit in reliable statistical data on trafficking , but the government plans to undertake further documentation in 2010 . 
The [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] has contracted [PER Ushari Khalil  ] , a scholar with past experience working on trafficking issues with the [ORG UN  ] in southern [LOC Sudan  ] , to complete a national situation report and evaluation of current government interventions . 
The government-affiliated [ORG Saleh Foundation  ] maintains a registry for tracking children returning from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , although this only captures a small fraction of total trafficking victims in the country . 
The [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] and Labor ( [ORG MOSAL  ] ) said that fewer children were trafficked to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in 2009 ( 602 ) compared to 2008 ( 900 ) , but these figures are inaccurate and represent only the small number of trafficking victims that found their way to one of two children 's rehabilitation centers in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
According to a joint [MISC UNICEF-MOSAL  ] study , security officials have prevented 1500 children from being trafficked from 2004-2009 ( no further breakdown available ) . 
Local [PER NGO Seyaj  ] said a study from 2007 suggested there were 700,000 children in forced-labor conditions in [LOC Yemen  ] and they estimate that the number is now double that figure . 
According to [PER Seyaj  ] , the magnitude of human trafficking in [LOC Yemen  ] is directly related to the economic and security conditions in the country , both of which have deteriorated in recent years , increasing the vulnerability of [MISC Yemenis  ] to trafficking. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
Is the country a country of origin , transit , and/or destination for men , women , or children subjected to conditions of commercial sexual exploitation , forced or bonded labor , or other slave-like conditions ? 
Are citizens or residents of the country subjected to such trafficking conditions within the country ? 
If so , does this internal trafficking occur in territory outside of the government 's control ( e.g. , in a civil war situation ) ? 
From where are people recruited or from where do they migrate prior to being subjected to these exploitative conditions ? 
To what other countries are people trafficked and for what purposes ? 
Provide , where possible , numbers or estimates for each group of trafficking victims . 
Have there been any changes in the TIP situation since the last TIP Report ( e.g. , changes in destinations ) ? 
[LOC Yemen  ] is a point of origin ( [MISC Yemenis  ] trafficked mainly to the [LOC Gulf  ] and [LOC Horn of Africa  ] nationals trafficked upon arrival in [LOC Yemen  ] ) , transit ( [LOC Horn of Africa  ] nationals trafficked to the [LOC Gulf  ] ) , and destination ( [LOC Horn of Africa  ] nationals trafficked [ORG SANAA  ] 00000295 002 OF 013 to [LOC Yemen  ] ) . 
According to IOM , children ( mostly boys ) are smuggled to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] for forced begging , unskilled labor and street-vending . 
Children are recruited from the governorates of [LOC Dhamar  ] , [LOC Hajja  ] , [LOC Rayma  ] , [LOC Taiz  ] , [LOC Hudeidah  ] , [LOC Mahweet  ] , [LOC Ibb  ] , [LOC Lahj  ] , [LOC Dhale'  ] and [LOC Sa'ada  ] . 
Although [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is the primary destination for children trafficked from [LOC Yemen  ] , a small number are trafficked to [LOC Oman  ] . 
Trafficking to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is especially high during the season of [LOC Umra  ] and the [PER Hajj  ] ( pilgrimage to [LOC Mecca  ] ) . 
Internal trafficking occurs , both in areas under and somewhat outside of the government 's control ( e.g . 
[LOC Sa'ada  ] ) . 
Children are recruited from their families , and the parents reach an agreement with an agent to receive a certain monthly share of their child 's earnings . 
Many victims are young girls from a variety of rural governorates sent to hotels in [LOC Aden  ] , [LOC Sana'a  ] , [LOC Taiz  ] , [LOC Hudeidah  ] and other cities for sexual exploitation . 
According to [PER Seyaj  ] , local media reports and the [MISC Egyptian  ] government , at least 10 [MISC Yemeni  ] children were trafficked to [LOC Egypt  ] for organ harvesting in 2009 . 
The children were repatriated to [LOC Yemen  ] after [MISC Egyptian  ] authorities discovered the trafficking ring . 
There were many reports during the year that [MISC Somali  ] refugee women were trafficked to [LOC Aden  ] for prostitution and forced to live in squalid conditions . 
Since the last TIP report , the war in northern [LOC Yemen  ] intensified and spread , although a ceasefire was declared on February 12 . 
Local [ORG NGO Shawthab Foundation  ] reports that although the [MISC Saudi  ] entrance into the conflict has reduced the ability of traffickers to penetrate the [MISC Yemeni-Saudi  ] border , people inside the conflict zone are extremely vulnerable to trafficking because their livelihoods have been destroyed . 
[ORG Shawthab  ] says that it interviewed child trafficking victims who were recruited from official [ORG IDP  ] camps . 
[PER Seyaj  ] reports that there are approximately 150,000 children in [LOC Sa'ada  ] governorate , which has almost no functioning schools and a legal system even more dysfunctional than in the rest of the country . 
Of the estimated 250,000 IDPs from the conflict , 70 to 80 percent live outside of official camps. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
To what kind of conditions are the trafficking victims subjected ? 
Children are deprived of all rights ; they do not attend school and they cannot get access to medical care when necessary , although they are at high risk for STDs , skin diseases and other ailments . 
They often experience slavery-like conditions , including domestic abuse , and may be remunerated only with room and board . 
Children trafficked for purposes other than sexual exploitation often experience sexual exploitation at the hands of traffickers , border patrols , other security officials , and their employers . 
Their status in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is illegal , and they cannot report abuses and crimes to the authorities . 
When crossing the [MISC Saudi  ] border back into [LOC Yemen  ] to visit their families , they are subjected to robbery and extortion by border guards . 
Many of the border crossings used by traffickers are in dangerous desert areas where trafficking victims are subjected to the risks of dehydration , starvation , and exposure . 
Trafficked children told [ORG Shawthab  ] that [MISC Saudi  ] border guards have hung children 's severed heads from trees near the border as a warning to other children thinking about crossing the border illegally . 
In the conflict zone in northern [LOC Yemen  ] , [ORG NGOs  ] have collected evidence that children are forced to fight both with the government forces and with the [PER Houthis  ] ( see 33 for more details on child soldiers in [LOC Sa'ada  ] ) . 
Street children in the major cities work in arduous , dangerous jobs unsuitable for their age and physical [ORG SANAA  ] 00000295 003 OF 013 capabilities . 
They are subject to exploitation by individuals and gangs involved in the sex trade . 
They face verbal and physical abuse and are subject to kidnapping , trafficking and sexual harassment. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
Vulnerability to TIP: Are certain groups of persons more at risk of human trafficking ( e.g. , women and children , boys versus girls , certain ethnic groups , refugees , IDPs , etc . 
) ? 
If so , please specify the type of exploitation for which these groups are most at risk . 
[PER Young  ] women and boys are more at risk for sexual exploitation and domestic servitude ; disabled children are more at risk for forced begging . 
Children are also used to smuggle drugs across the border into [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
Refugees and economic migrants from the [LOC Horn of Africa  ] are also vulnerable to trafficking . 
Many choose to travel to [LOC Yemen  ] with hopes of working in other [LOC Gulf  ] countries , but once they reach [LOC Yemen  ] are trafficked into prostitution and domestic servitude . 
Others are trafficked to [LOC Yemen  ] with false promises of comfortable work as domestic servants , but upon arrival are forced into prostitution or domestic servitude. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
Traffickers and Their [MISC Methods: Who  ] are the traffickers/exploiters ? 
Are they independent business people ? 
Small or family-based crime groups ? 
Large international organized crime syndicates ? 
What methods are used to gain direct access to victims ? 
For example , are the traffickers recruiting victims through lucrative job offers ? 
Are victims sold by their families , or approached by friends of friends ? 
Are victims " self-presenting " ( approaching the exploiter without the involvement of a recruiter or transporter ) ? 
If recruitment or transportation is involved , what methods are used to recruit or transport victims ( e.g. , are false documents being used ) ? 
Are employment , travel , and tourism agencies or marriage brokers involved with or fronting for traffickers or crime groups to traffic individuals ? 
The traffickers are both individuals and , less frequently , organized gangs . 
[PER Seyaj  ] claims that most of the gangs are run by [MISC Saudis  ] . 
Their agents know local communities and seek out children with lucrative potential . 
For sex trafficking they recruit children based on their " degree of beauty . 
" They also recruit children with disabilities because they earn more as street beggars . 
Local [ORG NGO Democracy School  ] reports that many of the traffickers are former trafficked children . 
They become experts at crossing the border and develop contacts in [MISC Saudi  ] who will pay for trafficked labor . 
Both Shawthab and [PER Seyaj  ] report that the victims are often sold by their families , in exchange for a promised monthly remittance . 
Many of the trafficking victims are girls who enter into " temporary marriages " with [MISC Saudi  ] tourists . 
Sometimes the traffickers promise the family that a rich sheikh from the [LOC Gulf  ] will sponsor their disabled child for special education or physical rehabilitation . 
Other victims are " self-presenting , " young people who seek work opportunities outside of their villages and are then subjected to forced-labor conditions . 
It is common for impoverished families to send an older child to work in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in what they believe will be a decent job opportunity to help the family financially . 
Some children already working in the streets as beggars or vendors hear about better opportunities in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] that sound tempting . 
[MISC Somali  ] pirates capitalize on the instability in the [ORG Horn of Africa  ] to traffic people across the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Aden  ] to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Piracy , human trafficking and illegal smuggling are intertwined and many of the same criminals engage in all three practices .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) SETTING THE SCENE FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ANTI-TIP EFFORTS <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
Does the government acknowledge that human trafficking is a problem in the country ? 
If not , why not ? 
According to Higher Council for [MISC Motherhood  ] and Childhood ( [ORG HCMC  ] ) General Secretary Dr. [PER Nafisa H.  ] al-Jaifi , the government acknowledges that human trafficking is a problem in the country . 
Prime Minister [PER Ali al-Mujawwar  ] convened a meeting of the entire cabinet to develop a national strategy for addressing trafficking in persons , which was ratified by the Council of Ministers on March 31 , 2009. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
Which government agencies are involved in efforts to combat sex and labor trafficking ) including forced labor ) and , which agency , if any , has the lead in these efforts ? 
The [ORG HCMC  ] is the lead organization in efforts to combat child trafficking . 
It works with a [ORG Technical Committee  ] comprised of representatives from [ORG NGOs  ] , concerned Ministries , and [ORG UN  ] agencies . 
The national action plan identifies the following agencies as having a support role in combating child trafficking: [ORG Ministry of Human Rights  ] ( [ORG MOHR  ] ) , [ORG MOSAL  ] , [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of Legal Affairs  ] , [ORG Parliament  ] and the [ORG Social Fund  ] for [ORG Development.  ] <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
What are the limitations on the government 's ability to address these problems in practice ? 
For example , is funding for police or other institutions inadequate ? 
Is overall corruption a problem ? 
Does the government lack the resources to aid victims ? 
With the exception of the military , nearly all government agencies saw their funding cut dramatically in 2008 and 2009 , severely hindering their ability to combat TIP . 
Officials reported an inability to travel to governorates where trafficking was a problem due to lack of funds . 
Corruption is an acute problem in [LOC Yemen  ] , which was ranked 154 out of 180 countries on [ORG Transparency International  ] 's 2009 Corruption Perceptions index . 
It is difficult to prosecute sexual exploiters , since shari'ah law stipulates that there must be four witnesses to prove a sexual offense. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
To what extent does the government systematically monitor its anti-trafficking efforts ( on all fronts ) prosecution , victim protection , and prevention ) and periodically make available , publicly or privately and directly or through regional/international organizations , its assessments of these anti-trafficking efforts ? 
Please see 25A for details. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
What measures has the government taken to establish the identity of local populations , including birth registration , citizenship , and nationality ? 
Children born to at least one citizen parent are eligible for citizenship . 
Children born in the country who do not have at least one citizen parent are eligible to file for citizenship , although frequently it is not granted . 
There was no universal birth registration , and many children , especially in rural areas , were never registered or registered after several years . 
Hospitals maintain official birth registries , but not all hospitals insist on registration , and most children are not born in hospitals . 
Theoretically , children must have birth certificates to register for school , but this requirement was not universally enforced. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
To what extent is the government capable of gathering the data required for an in-depth assessment of law enforcement efforts ? 
Where are the gaps ? 
Are there any ways to work around these gaps ? 
[ORG SANAA  ] 00000295 005 OF 013 There is a serious deficit in reliable statistical data on trafficking , including law enforcement efforts . 
Relevant government ministries complain that traffickers are often prosecuted for non-trafficking offenses , including kidnapping and the illegal ways that they use trafficking victims , including theft , drug smuggling , prostitution and homosexuality . 
Differences in terminology make it difficult to collect information on prosecutions and convictions of traffickers . 
The government is hopeful that its recently hired consultant will suggest ways to address these gaps. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
Existing Laws against TIP: Does the country have a law or laws specifically prohibiting trafficking in persons ) both sexual exploitation and labor ? 
If so , please specifically cite the name of the law ( s ) and its date of enactment and provide the exact language ( actual copies preferable ) of the TIP provisions . 
Please provide a full inventory of trafficking laws , including non-criminal statutes that allow for civil penalties against alleged trafficking crimes ( e.g. , civil forfeiture laws , and laws against illegal debt ) . 
Does the law ( s ) cover both internal and transnational forms of trafficking ? 
If not , under what other laws can traffickers be prosecuted ? 
For example , are there laws against slavery or the exploitation of prostitution by means of force , fraud , or coercion ? 
Are these other laws being used in trafficking cases ? 
As it stands , anti-trafficking laws are piece-meal , inconsistent and not comprehensive . 
Parliamentary elections scheduled for April 2009 were postponed for two years in February . 
With a weak [ORG Parliament  ] distracted by numerous other internal issues , there has been no progress on strengthening anti-trafficking legislation . 
Efforts are still underway to amend the [ORG Child Rights Law  ] to add punishments for trafficking offenses , and to define a minimum age for marriage . 
The [ORG Technical Committee  ] to combat child trafficking lobbied [ORG Parliament  ] throughout the year for passage of comprehensive anti-trafficking laws . 
It conducted special meetings with the [ORG Islamic Law  ] , Regulations and [ORG Human Rights  ] committees . 
In December 2009 , the [ORG MOJ  ] issued a decree to all judges to aggressively pursue human trafficking prosecutions and finish pending cases as soon as possible . 
The [ORG MOJ  ] and [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) issued a decree in October 2009 aimed at reducing early marriage and trafficking via " temporary marriage " arrangements ( more info in 29E ) . 
According to the government , the penalty for transporting a child under the age of 18 to another country for the purpose of illegal exploitation is imprisonment of not more than 5 years . 
The penalty increases to 7 years if the criminal uses force and deception . 
The penalty increases to not less than 3 and not exceeding 10 years if the transport action is combined with sexual acts or bodily harm. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
Punishment of Sex Trafficking Offenses: What are the prescribed and imposed penalties for the trafficking of persons for commercial sexual exploitation , including for the forced prostitution of adults and the prostitution of children ? 
No change from last year. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
Punishment of Labor Trafficking Offenses: What are the prescribed and imposed penalties for labor trafficking offenses , including all forms of forced labor ? 
Do the government 's laws provide for criminal punishment*e.g. , jailtime*for labor recruiters who engage in recruitment of workers using knowingly fraudulent or deceptive offers with the purpose of subjecting workers to compelled service in the destination country ? 
Are there laws punishing employers or labor agents who confiscate workers' passports or travel documents for the purpose of labor trafficking , switch [ORG SANAA  ] 00000295 006 OF 013 contracts without the worker 's consent as a means to keep the worker in a state of compelled service , or withhold payment of salaries as means of keeping the worker in a state of compelled service ? 
No change from last year. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
What are the prescribed penalties for rape or forcible sexual assault ? ( NOTE: This is necessary to evaluate a foreign government 's compliance with [ORG TVPA Minimum Standard  ] 2 , which reads: " For the knowing commission of any act of sex trafficking ) the government of the country should prescribe punishment commensurate with that for grave crimes , such as forcible sexual assault ( rape ) . 
" END NOTE ) No change from last year. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
[ORG Law Enforcement Statistics: Did  ] the government take legal action against human trafficking offenders during the reporting period ? 
If so , provide numbers of investigations , prosecutions , convictions , and sentences imposed , including details on plea bargains and fines , if relevant and available . 
Please note the number of convicted trafficking offenders who received suspended sentences and the number who received only a fine as punishment . 
Please indicate which laws were used to investigate , prosecute , convict , and sentence traffickers . 
Also , if possible , please disaggregate numbers of cases by type of TIP ( labor vs commercial sexual exploitation ) and victims ( children under 18 years of age vs. adults ) . 
What were the actual punishments imposed on convicted trafficking offenders ? 
Are they serving the time sentenced ? 
If not , why not ? 
Data on arrests and prosecutions for human traffickers were incomplete and varied widely depending on the source: Government-affiliated Asrar press reported that in the first six months of 2009 , security forces in [LOC Hajja  ] governorate captured 26 child traffickers attempting to traffic 180 children to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The traffickers were referred to [LOC Hajja  ] prosecutor 's office to stand trial and the children were sent to the [ORG Haradh Child Protection Center  ] . 
( No further information was available on the outcome of the case as of the writing of this report . 
) Head of local [ORG NGO National Organization  ] for [ORG Combating People Smuggling  ] Ali al-Jelai said that police had thwarted attempts to traffic 70 children to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] during 2009 and that 20 smugglers had been arrested . 
Democracy School reports that there were approximately 50 cases against traffickers in local courts in [LOC Hajja  ] governorate . 
Some of those prosecuted received sentences up to 10 years. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
Does the government provide any specialized training for law enforcement and immigration officials on identifying and treating victims of trafficking ? 
Or training on investigating and prosecuting human trafficking crimes ? 
Specify whether [ORG NGOs  ] , international organizations , and/or the [ORG USG  ] provide specialized training for host government officials . 
The government conducted training courses for an unknown number of policemen at border crossings on how to deal with trafficked children. <a id='parG' href='#parG'>¶</a>G . 
Does the government cooperate with other governments in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases ? 
If possible , provide the number of cooperative international investigations on trafficking during the reporting period . 
Efforts to develop a [MISC Yemeni-Saudi  ] partnership against human trafficking , to include investigations and prosecutions of cross-border trafficking offenders , have fizzled , a situation that the [MISC Yemeni  ] government and civil society attribute to the [MISC Saudi  ] government 's lack of seriousness about the problem . 
[ORG SANAA  ] 00000295 007 OF 013 <a id='parH' href='#parH'>¶</a>H . 
Does the government extradite persons who are charged with trafficking in other countries ? 
If so , please provide the number of traffickers extradited during the reporting period , and the number of trafficking extraditions pending . 
In particular , please report on any pending or concluded extraditions of trafficking offenders to the [LOC United States  ] . 
No reported extraditions during the reporting period. <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
Is there evidence of government involvement in or tolerance of trafficking , on a local or institutional level ? 
If so , please explain in detail . 
Although there is little evidence of explicit government involvement in trafficking , corruption in law enforcement and border security officials ensures that traffickers are able to operate with impunity . 
Seyaj reports that traffickers sometimes supply a child to border guards for sexual exploitation in exchange for those border guards " looking the other way " as the traffickers smuggle goods and people across the border . 
There is anecdotal evidence that sheikhs and other tribal leaders who may also occupy seats on local councils are involved in trafficking rings . 
Traffickers and the parents of trafficked children sometimes spell out the payments that the parents will receive in a contract , and Democracy School reports that police officers in [LOC Hajja  ] sometimes serve as the witnesses for these contracts. <a id='parJ' href='#parJ'>¶</a>J . 
If government officials are involved in human trafficking , what steps has the government taken to end such complicity ? 
Please indicate the number of government officials investigated and prosecuted for involvement in trafficking or trafficking-related criminal activities during the reporting period . 
Have any been convicted ? 
What sentence ( s ) was imposed ? 
Please specify if officials received suspended sentences , or were given a fine , fired , or reassigned to another position within the government as punishment . 
Please indicate the number of convicted officials that received suspended sentences or received only a fine as punishment . 
There was no evidence of prosecutions of government officials for complicity in trafficking during the reporting period . 
Anti-corruption authorities did little to address the endemic corruption that permits government officials to " look the other way " on human trafficking. <a id='parK' href='#parK'>¶</a>K . 
For countries that contribute troops to international peacekeeping efforts , please indicate whether the government vigorously investigated , prosecuted , convicted and sentenced nationals of the country deployed abroad as part of a peacekeeping or other similar mission who engaged in or facilitated severe forms of trafficking or who exploited victims of such trafficking . 
There were no reports of [MISC Yemeni  ] troops involved in international peacekeeping efforts engaging in trafficking or exploiting victims of trafficking. <a id='parL' href='#parL'>¶</a>L . 
If the country has an identified problem of child sex tourists coming to the country , what are the countries of origin for sex tourists ? 
How many foreign pedophiles did the government prosecute or deport/extradite to their country of origin ? 
If your host country 's nationals are perpetrators of child sex tourism , do the country 's child sexual abuse laws have extraterritorial coverage ( similar to the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG PROTECT Act  ] ) to allow the prosecution of suspected sex tourists for crimes committed abroad ? 
If so , how many of the country 's nationals were prosecuted and/or convicted during the reporting period under the extraterritorial provision ( s ) for traveling to other countries to engage in child sex tourism ? 
[LOC Yemen  ] has an identified problem of child sex tourists coming to the country . 
The main country of origin is [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , but [ORG NGOs  ] suggested that tourists from other [LOC Gulf  ] countries [ORG SANAA  ] 00000295 008 OF 013 visit hotels in [LOC Aden  ] and [LOC Sana'a  ] , where trafficking victims are sexually exploited . 
There were no reported prosecutions , deportations or extraditions of child sex tourists during the reporting period . 
There were no reports that [MISC Yemeni  ] nationals engaged in child sex tourism during the reporting period. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( SBU ) PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
What kind of protection is the government able under existing law to provide for victims and witnesses ? 
Does it provide these protections in practice ? 
No change from last year. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
Does the country have victim care facilities ( shelters or drop-in centers ) which are accessible to trafficking victims ? 
Do foreign victims have the same access to care as domestic trafficking victims ? 
Where are child victims placed ( e.g. , in shelters , foster care , of juvenile justice detention centers ) ? 
Does the country have specialized care for adults in addition to children ? 
Does the country have specialized facilities dedicated to helping victims of trafficking ? 
Are these facilities operated by the government or by [ORG NGOs  ] ? 
What is the funding source of these facilities ? 
Please estimate the amount the government spent ( in [LOC U.S.  ] dollar equivalent ) on these specialized facilities dedicated to helping trafficking victims during the reporting period . 
The only victim care facilities in the country are two centers for trafficked children in [LOC Haradh  ] ( [LOC Hajja  ] ) and [LOC Sana'a  ] , operated jointly by the government and [ORG NGOs  ] . 
These centers provide the children with social protection , psychological and medical care and reunite them with their families , if possible . 
Children without families are enrolled in orphanages . 
There was no information available on how much the government spent on these facilities. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
Does the government provide trafficking victims with access to legal , medical and psychological services ? 
If so , please specify the kind of assistance provided . 
Does the government provide funding or other forms of support to foreign or domestic [ORG NGOs  ] and/or international organizations for providing these services to trafficking victims ? 
Please explain and provide any funding amounts in [LOC U.S.  ] dollar equivalent . 
If assistance provided was in-kind , please specify exact assistance . 
Please specify if funding for assistance comes from a federal budget or from regional or local governments . 
The [ORG Saleh Foundation  ] , a federal government-affiliated NGO , operates the center in [LOC Haradh  ] , a major nexus of human trafficking on the [MISC Saudi-Yemeni  ] border . 
[PER Shawthab  ] operates the center in [LOC Sana'a  ] , where there are on average 16-20 children at a time . 
According to [PER Shawthab  ] , the center in [LOC Sana'a  ] provides the children with food , clothes , healthcare , psychological counseling , schooling , and sports/extracurricular activities . 
[PER Shawthab  ] receives donations for the center , both financial and in-kind , from local businessmen and restaurants and has an agreement with [LOC Sana'a  ] 's government-run al-Thawra Hospital for the children to receive free treatment there . 
There was no information available on how much the government spent on these facilities. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
Does the government assist foreign trafficking victims , for example , by providing temporary to permanent residency status , or other relief from deportation ? 
If so , please explain . 
A January 2010 law requiring all refugees in [LOC Yemen  ] to register or face deportation to their home countries could impact victims of trafficking if they do not register with the government . 
The government provides prima facie status to all [MISC Somali  ] refugees in [LOC Yemen  ] , which allows them to remain in country and receive [ORG UNHCR  ] services . 
However , there was no formal program to assist foreign trafficking victims .
