( C ) The Charge called on [MISC Mariot  ] [PER Leslie  ] , the [ORG FCO DG for Defense and Intelligence and Acting Political  ] Director , on August 28 to discuss recent developments in regard to [LOC Georgia  ] and deliver ref demarches . 
[PER Leslie  ] affirmed that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] are “on the same page” that [LOC South Ossetians  ] and [MISC Abkhazians  ] should not participate in upcoming [ORG UNSC  ] meetings on [LOC Georgia  ] . 
She stated that the August 27 G-7 Joint Foreign Ministers Statement , which condemns [MISC Russia’s  ] recognition of [LOC South Ossetian  ] and [MISC Abkhazian  ] independence , “mostly covers” concerns about recent [MISC Russian  ] steps . 
The [LOC UK  ] , she continued , is “absolutely right along with you” and is trying to persuade others to follow the same course. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Leslie  ] said that [ORG HMG  ] will continue to support economic and development assistance to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
She noted that Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] agreed with Secretary [PER Rice  ] about the importance of economic aid to [LOC Georgia  ] and cited the August 25-27 [LOC U.S.  ] interagency delegation led by Under Secretary of State [PER Jeffery  ] . 
She added that a team from the [ORG UK Department for International Development  ] ( [ORG DFID  ] ) , recently completed a ten day visit to [LOC Georgia  ] and is in the process of drafting a report of its mission .

Also , [PER Karen Pillay  ] , Head of [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC CIS  ] and Energy at [ORG HM Treasury  ] told [ORG Econoff  ] that [ORG HMG  ] had received an economic assistance “wish list” from [LOC Georgia  ] , but was awaiting the results of an [ORG IMF  ] needs assessment .

) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Leslie  ] stated that there “is lots going on” within the [ORG EU  ] and that the [ORG EU Council  ] meeting on Monday will consider the “crucial issue” of the next steps the [ORG EU  ] should take regarding [MISC Russian  ] actions and in support of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Within the [ORG EU  ] , “one end of the scale” involves discussions of a possible [ORG ESDP  ] presence in [LOC Georgia  ] , while “economic aid acceleration” is also under discussion . 
A Strategic Shift...But Not a [MISC New Cold War  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Leslie  ] told the Charge that [MISC Russia’s  ] actions in [LOC Georgia  ] represent a “strategic , tectonic shift in international relations.” Citing Foreign Secretary Miliband’s August 27 speech in [LOC Kyiv  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , in which [PER Miliband  ] affirmed that [PER Putin  ] has a “big responsibility” not to start a new [MISC Cold War  ] , [PER Leslie  ] observed that [ORG HMG  ] is “not calling this a new [MISC Cold War  ] , ” although recent events have “strategic consequences” and mark the “end of the period that began in 1991.” [PER Leslie  ] stressed that Miliband’s clear condemnation in his speech of [MISC Russia’s  ] actions has helped put the [MISC Russians  ] in the defensive position of having to justify their actions -- “ ( Foreign Minister ) [PER Lavrov  ] is on the run.” ( Note . 
Miliband’s speech affirms “in the midst of the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis...the commitment of the [LOC United Kingdom  ] to support the democratic choices of the [MISC Ukrainian  ] people” and states that “the sight of [MISC Russian  ] tanks in a neighboring country on the fortieth anniversary of the crushing of the [ORG Prague Spring  ] has shown that the temptations of power politics remain.” The full text of the speech is available on the [MISC FCO’s  ] website , http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/ End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Asked by the Charge whether , in her view , [MISC Russia’s  ] decision to go into [LOC Georgia  ] was part of an overall change of [MISC Russian  ] strategy , [PER Leslie  ] replied that she is “still assessing if it was a strategic decision or a tactical decision with strategic consequences.” [PER Leslie  ] stated that in her capacity as [ORG DG  ] for [ORG Defense and Intelligence  ] she would continue to evaluate “the big strategic challenge from [MISC Russia.”  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting with [ORG Cabinet Office  ] Director General for Foreign and [ORG Defense Policy  ] [PER Margaret Aldred  ] to deliver ref points , she pointed to Foreign Secretary Miliband’s speech in [LOC Kyiv  ] as laying out HMG’s strong condemnation of [MISC Russian  ] actions in [LOC Georgia  ] , including [MISC Moscow’s  ] recognition of the two breakaway [MISC Georgian  ] enclaves . 
Echoing Leslie’s comments , she told Pol Minister Counselor that [MISC Moscow’s  ] actions represented a “seismic shift” in international relations and a defining break with global relationships in place since the end of the [MISC Cold War  ] . 
Turning to the situation on the ground in [LOC Georgia  ] , [PER Aldred  ] said that the six-point peace plan negotiated by the [MISC French  ] had “clearly” left room for [MISC Russian  ] forces to remain “outside existing boundaries” and the [MISC Russians  ] were taking “maximalist” advantage . 
The [ORG West  ] needs to be thinking what its response will be to this , if the [MISC Russians  ] continue this approach . 
She also referred to messages she had seen from [LOC Tbilisi  ] indicating that there were voices in [LOC Georgia  ] , as well , that wanted to resume military action -- the [ORG West  ] had to send a message to [LOC Georgia  ] as well warning against this .
