( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Summary: The  ] construction of an [ORG AFRICOM  ] funded airport interdiction facility moved a step closer on July 29 with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Charge Sue [PER K Brown  ] and [ORG Ghana Narcotics Board  ] Executive Secretary [PER Ben Botwe  ] . 
Five convicted cocaine traffickers received long prison sentences . 
Officials from western embassies participated in a “mini-Dublin” session to discuss narcotics interdiction efforts . 
MOU Signed for [ORG Airpor Facility  ] ; -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) CDA [PER Sue K. Brown  ] and [ORG Ghana Narcotics Board  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) Executive Secretary [PER Benjamin Botwe  ] July 29 signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the construction of a $75,000 airport interdiction facility . 
The [ORG AFRICOM  ] funded facility , to be located at [LOC Kotoka International Airport  ] , will provide a climate controlled space to house sensitive equipment used in drug detection . 
( [ORG Note: Two USG  ] purchased itemizers , capable of detecting drug residue , are currently not functioning . 
The machines do not operate well in non-air conditioned spaces . 
End Note . 
) Executive Secretary [PER Botwe  ] used the event to lobby for an x-ray machine for airport interdiction efforts against “swallowers” who ingest pellets of cocaine . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] is working with [ORG INL  ] and [ORG AFRICOM  ] to obtain an x-ray machine for the airport and to support maintenance of the itemizers . 
End Note . 
) [ORG NACOB  ] Officials Talk Shop ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the signing , [ORG POLOFF  ] , OSC Chief , IO and [ORG LES Political Specialist  ] met with [PER Botwe  ] and top [ORG NACOB  ] officials for a discussion on the state of the [ORG Narcotics Board  ] . 
[PER Botwe  ] , who was appointed Secretary on an interim basis last year , told [ORG POLOFF  ] that he was negotiating his return to his permanent position as Deputy Chief Executive of the [ORG Ghana Food and Drugs Board  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] A source at [ORG NACOB  ] told [ORG EMBOFF  ] that Botwe’s successor has been selected and an announcement could be made soon . 
) [PER Botwe  ] lamented NACOB’s position as a subordinate agency within the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] . 
He said that its status made it difficult to deal authoritatively with other Ministries and the Police Service , as [ORG NACOB  ] needed to work within a chain of command that slowed operations and diverted resources . 
[PER Botwe  ] believes the [ORG Board  ] needs independent status , such as an agency within the Office of the President . 
He added that any progress on an independent status for [ORG NACOB  ] would need to wait until after the elections . 
[PER Botwe  ] noted that [ORG NACOB  ] had grown significantly under his time as Executive Secretary , and its 150 member staff was projected to reach five hundred by 2010 . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) . 
[ORG POLOFF  ] asked [PER Botwe  ] about the planned [ORG Africa Partnership Station  ] , a [ORG US Navy  ] maritime security program . 
The [ORG NACOB  ] head said that he hoped his agency could participate in the training , nad added that participation would serve as an opportunity for the [ORG NACOB  ] to enter into talks with the [ORG Ghana Armed Forces  ] ( and in particular the navy ) on inter-agency cooperation , which is currently limited . 
5.SBU ) [ORG POLOFF  ] asked [PER Botwe  ] about the recent seizure of a large shipment of cocaine that originated in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
The shipment was stopped outside of [LOC Accra  ] by police , but other than the three individuals in the vehicle , no arrests have been made . 
[PER Botwe  ] and his officials agreed that more patience in conducting investigations was needed in order to arrest those higher up in trafficking circles . 
He cited the need for better cooperation among [MISC Ghanaian  ] law enforcement organizations . 
Cocaine Traffickers Receive Long Sentences ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) A [MISC Ghanaian  ] court sentenced five traffickers each to twenty-five year prison terms . 
The five , involved in the MV [PER Benjamin  ] cocaine case , attempted in 2006 to land 2,300 kilograms of cocaine to [LOC Ghana  ] . 
( [ORG Note: Some  ] of the confiscated product later disappeared , mysteriously , from the [LOC Ghana  ] Police Service’s secured evidence storage facility . 
End Note ) . 
The five included three [MISC Ghanaians  ] and two [MISC Chinese  ] ; a [MISC South Korean  ] originally indicted was found not-guilty . 
The trial judge , [PER Justice Anin Yeboah  ] , said that the harm caused [ORG ACCRA  ] 00001005 002 OF 002 to the country by the rise in narcotic trafficking made it imperative for the court to issue lengthy sentences as a deterrent . 
[LOC Accra  ] Mini-Dublin Meeting Held April 24 --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG POLOFF  ] attended the April 24 Mini-Dublin session . 
Representatives from the [LOC UK  ] , [MISC French  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , the [ORG EU  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] and other western missions participate regularly in the committee . 
The [MISC French  ] [ORG DCM  ] reported that her Mission had arranged for a year’s supply of drug test kits to be provided to [MISC Ghanaian  ] authorities . 
The [MISC Ghanaians  ] had allowed their inventory of kits to run out , requiring a last minute rush to obtain new kits . 
The [LOC UK  ] representatives said that [ORG SOCA  ] ( [ORG Serious Organized Crime Agency  ] ) was increasing its presence in [LOC West Africa  ] and will be posting in September or October a liaison officer in [LOC Accra  ] . 
A [ORG Royal Navy  ] vessel ( HMS Endurance ) will visit [LOC Ghana  ] approximately August 20 as part of a maritime security program . 
The leader of the [ORG UK Project Westbridge  ] ( which conducts drug interdiction operations with [ORG NACOB  ] at Ghana’s international airport ) described a training package available through the [ORG UN  ] , currently used in [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
He has held discussions with [ORG NACOB  ] officials about using the modules in [LOC Ghana  ] , and possibly expanding training to drug officials from other [MISC West African  ] countries . 
The [ORG EU  ] representative said that a team of narcotics experts were in [LOC West Africa  ] . 
[ORG POLOFF  ] told attendees that the DEA’s plans to open an [LOC Accra  ] office later this year were still on schedule. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] embassy official expressed concern over [MISC Ghanaian  ] traffickers increasing use of [LOC Lome  ] as a trans-shipment point for narcotics to [LOC France  ] , via the regular [ORG Air France  ] flights . 
The [LOC UK  ] official who directs [ORG Project Westbridge  ] described recent operations , which have included six seizures in the past month . 
He has observed [ORG NACOB  ] agents at the airport ( particularly [LOC Ghana  ] Police Service officers on loan to [ORG NACOB  ] ) directing passengers away from flights receiving extra interdiction scrutiny . 
On one occasion , he returned unexpectedly to the airport at 4 a.m. to screen a flight . 
An arrested trafficker told the [LOC UK  ] official that the trafficker had been told that [ORG Westbridge  ] was not operating that night . 
A test by [ORG Westbridge  ] officials of the cell phone SIM card of a trafficker found the phone numbers of senior [ORG NACOB  ] officials . 
The [LOC UK  ] official lamented that [MISC Ghanaian  ] authorities return to arrested traffickers their [ORG EU  ] identity cards , which allow entry and residence in the [ORG EU  ] . 
He noted that depriving traffickers of their [ORG EU  ] permits “hurts them worse than prison.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment . 
The [ORG Project Westbridge  ] team’s concerns over the integrity of [ORG NACOB  ] personnel at the airport are neither new nor surprising . 
Nor is the concern limited to the NACOB-- the MV [MISC Benjamin’s  ] missing cocaine from the Police Service evidence room shows that corruption is an issue throughout Ghana’s counter-narcotics program . 
The ease of fast money in the narcotics trade is a powerful incentive for corruption . 
Until the authorities expand beyond interdiction , to arresting middlemen and the so-called drug barons , it is difficult to see how the drug problem will be controlled . 
Initiatives such as the airport facility , x-ray machine and [ORG Project Westbridge  ] are important and should be supported , but are not sufficient alone .
