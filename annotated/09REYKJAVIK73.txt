( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: Prime Minister [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] is riding high in the polls ahead of [LOC Iceland  ] 's April 25 parliamentary election , and is on the verge of becoming the country 's leading political party . 
An April victory would fulfill the party 's raison d'etre of forming a credible counterweight to the conservative [ORG Independence Party  ] 's dominance of [MISC Icelandic  ] politics , and would put to rest the question of whether the [MISC Icelandic  ] left can ever truly be united . 
If [PER Sigurdardottir  ] stays on as PM , it will also help resolve the party 's turmoil following the sudden illness and retirement from politics of previous [ORG SDA Chair  ] [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] . 
Though conflicted on defense and security issues , the [ORG SDA  ] is avowedly pro-EU , and will without doubt work to bring the [ORG EU  ] membership question to the fore should it stay in power after the election . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) was formally established as a political party in 2000 . 
Four traditional leftist parties merged to form the [ORG SDA:  ] The [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SDP  ] ) , The [ORG People 's Alliance  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) , The Women 's List ( [ORG WL  ] ) , and a split-off party from the [ORG SDP  ] , the [ORG National Awakening  ] , established by current PM [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] . 
The [ORG SDA  ] wanted to challenge the dominance of the [ORG Independence Party  ] by creating a large , unified social democratic party akin to those in the other [MISC Nordic  ] countries . 
This effort was initially stymied by the establishment of a new splinter left party , the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] . 
The [ORG Alliance  ] won only 27 percent of the 1999 vote , but made strong gains in 2003 with 31 percent of the vote . 
In the 2007 elections support dwindled again to 27 percent , but the [ORG SDA  ] 's credibility rebounded after [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] brought them into government with the [ORG Independence Party  ] . 
Thanks in large part to the economic collapse in 2008 and the fact that public discontent has focused on the [MISC IP  ] rather than the [ORG Social Dems  ] , current polls show the [ORG SDA  ] set to finally cement a place as a credible counterweight to the long-dominant [ORG IP.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG SDA  ] has had trouble articulating a coherent foreign policy as the views of the three traditional leftist parties that formed the [ORG SDA  ] do not readily converge . 
The [ORG SDP  ] was very supportive of [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] presence , while the [ORG PA  ] long advocated withdrawing from [ORG NATO  ] and ending the bilateral defense relationship . 
The [ORG WL  ] advocated an essentially pacifist policy . 
The [ORG SDP  ] was the only [MISC Icelandic  ] party in favor of [ORG EU  ] membership , which both the [ORG PA  ] and the [ORG WL  ] strongly opposed . 
Today the [ORG SDA  ] champions [ORG EU  ] membership for [LOC Iceland  ] and the adoption of the euro as [LOC Iceland  ] 's currency . 
The [ORG SDA  ] favors defense ties with the [LOC US  ] and is a supporter of [ORG NATO  ] membership and the ongoing shaping of a security policy for [LOC Iceland  ] in conjunction with [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG EU  ] and the other [MISC Nordics  ] . 
That said , there are still some within the party that cling to the notion that [LOC Iceland  ] does not need to spend any money on defense . 
These voices have gained some following in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] succeeded [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] as [ORG SDA Chair  ] to much fanfare in 2005 , but her efforts to unify the party did not immediately translate into better standing with the public . 
In the run-up to the 2007 parliamentary elections , the party did not seem to have a coherent policy on the most important issues to voters . 
Party members made contradictory remarks in the media on [ORG SDA  ] voters' core issues , including the environment and further build-up of heavy industry . 
Voters sensed this , and polls showed party support going down to only 20 percent . 
It is possible that voters were suffering from what some termed " [PER Ingibjorg Solrun  ] fatigue , " as she had been prominent in [MISC Icelandic  ] politics for a long time as Reykjavik Mayor and then a member of parliament . 
However , the [ORG SDA  ] was able to rally from this low point , capitalizing on doubts about the radical [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] 's credibility , and emerged as the second-largest party in the [LOC Althingi.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG SDA  ] formed a majority coalition with the [MISC IP  ] after the elections that pledged to be a " liberal reforming government " for a dynamic economy , a robust welfare system , improved household finances , and greater business competitiveness . 
The coalition was popular from the outset , but as dark economic clouds started gathering on the horizon in early 2008 , public support began to dwindle . 
The highly leveraged financial system collapsed as lending lines closed internationally in September , and the government took over [LOC Iceland  ] 's three largest banks . 
Public demonstrations that started in October and culminated in January channeled anger and frustration at the [MISC IP-SDA  ] majority coalition and such institutions as the [ORG Central Bank and Financial Supervisory Authority  ] . 
At the end of January , the coalition broke down under the pressure. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gisladottir  ] was diagnosed with a brain tumor after becoming ill when attending the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] in September <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
As a result , during the most hectic moments of the crisis shewas out on medical leave and unable to resume a ful schedule . 
Her absence was a double-edged swor for the party . 
Many observers note that with [PER Gisladottir  ] out , Prime Minister and [ORG IP Chair  ] Geir Haade [LOC REYKJAVIK  ] 00000073 002 OF 002 became the sole public face of the cabinet during the crisis , leading many to associate the government 's poor handling of affairs with the [MISC IP  ] and [MISC Haarde  ] alone . 
The [ORG SDA  ] was thus spared the full brunt of popular anger over the collapse . 
On the other hand , [PER Gisladottir  ] 's absence was also apparent in the increasingly open tension between the coalition partners and disagreements between [ORG SDA  ] ministers . 
After the [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition broke up , several [MISC IP  ] insiders vented their frustration with the [ORG SDA  ] , which they viewed as " ungovernable " without [PER Gisladottir  ] 's steady hand. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Gisladottir  ] returned briefly to the fray as the coalition unwound in January , but then chose to step down as Foreign Minister and did not take a seat in the new [MISC SDA-Left Green  ] minority coalition headed by [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] as Prime Minister . 
A break from political work in February proved insufficient for [PER Gisladottir  ] to fully recover her health , and in early March she announced her departure from politics for an unspecified time . 
All eyes turned to [PER Sigurdardottir  ] , who received tremendous support in the [ORG SDA  ] 's Reykjavik primary and came under massive pressure to declare her candidacy in the election for [ORG SDA Chair  ] at the [ORG SDA  ] national convention in late March . 
After giving it some thought , [PER Sigurdardottir  ] ran unopposed and received 98 percent of the total vote at the national convention. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG SDA  ] primaries produced some regeneration of party lineups in all six constituencies . 
Half of the candidates are incumbent MPs while the other half is either absolute newcomers or have previous ties to the [ORG SDA  ] . 
The party leadership says that the most important tasks at hand for the next government will be to ensure the increased creation of wealth , employment , and welfare . 
In this regard , the [ORG SDA  ] wants to reestablish the [MISC Icelandic  ] financial system and re-instill faith in the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy . 
The [ORG SDA  ] believes it is necessary to follow through with the plan agreed on with the [ORG IMF  ] and that it is vitally important to initiate [ORG EU  ] accession talks as soon as possible . 
Although the [ORG SDA  ] has stated its preference to continue working with the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] in a coalition government , it has not ruled out other coalition options . 
Some believe this is a tactic to force the [ORG LG  ] to the table on the [ORG EU  ] question , as the [MISC Left-Greens  ] are still reluctant to move closer to [LOC Brussels  ] . 
Given the strength of [ORG SDA  ] conviction on the [ORG EU  ] question , however , there is little doubt that a continued government under Prime Minister [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's leadership will move to address the issue sooner rather than later .
