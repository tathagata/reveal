" He added that [PER Lula  ] had not returned any of [PER Chavez  ] 's calls since then , but that he would probably do so soon in order to keep the communication open , as unpleasannt as it may be. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

[PER Dirceu  ] added that [PER Lula  ] had received the mother of the [MISC Brazilian  ] detained in [LOC Cuba  ] .

( C ) Turning to [LOC Argentina  ] , [PER Dirceu  ] commented that part of the problem is that it is not clear that the [ORG Kirchner  ] government has a clear or comprehensive plan for extricating the country from its economic woes . 
Consequently , the government is in the position of having to " slay a lion " every week to stay out in front of impending crises .

[PER Dirceu  ] 's comments on [LOC Haiti  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's vote on the [LOC Cuba  ] motion at the [ORG UNHRC  ] track closely with [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] UnderSecretary [PER Vera Pedrosa  ] 's comments to Ambassador [PER Hrinak  ] on March 19 , reported reftel .
