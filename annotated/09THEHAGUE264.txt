( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The philosophical opposition of [ORG Labor Party  ] members , the economic crisis , and unfavorable [LOC U.S.  ] reports have brought [MISC Dutch  ] support of the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) Program to the political breaking point . 
Parliament is in a stalemate as it goes into a second day of emotionally charged debates . 
The future of [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG JSF  ] participation -- and the survival of the ruling coalition -- hangs in the balance . 
Post believes the coalition will survive , but any procurement of [ORG JSF  ] test planes will come with a political cost . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Labor Party  ] views: ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) as a major coalition partner in the [MISC Dutch  ] government has faced considerable pressure from the rank-and-file to oppose the [ORG JSF  ] from the very beginning of the coalition ( reftels B and C ) . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] has always been philosophically opposed to being a partner in the development of the [ORG JSF  ] . 
However , in 2006 , party leaders were convinced during the formation of the coalition that they had to agree to a decision timeline on [ORG JSF  ] in order to be a part of the coalition government . 
The coalition accord states " " The Memorandum of Understanding on the [ORG JSF  ] test planes will be signed in 2007 . 
In 2008 the business case will be reviewed before decision-making takes place in 2009 on signing the contract for the definite procurement of test planes . 
On the basis of the review and of comparison on price , quality , and term of delivery with possible other aircraft , the cabinet will present a decision to parliament in 2010 on the replacement of the [MISC F-16  ] . 
" " Under pressure from [ORG PvdA  ] leader and Finance Minister [PER Woulter Bos  ] and [ORG PvdA  ] floorleader [PER Mariette Hamer  ] , the [ORG PvdA  ] congress on March 15 refrained from adopting resolutions on [ORG JSF  ] and budget cuts . 
[PER Hamer  ] urged the congress to give the party leadership room to negotiate . 
At that time 83% of the [ORG PvdA  ] rank and file opposed the purchase of the test aircraft . 
Economic crisis: ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The economic crisis has given a platform for the [ORG PvdA  ] to rally against what is perceived as a costly program at a time where the funds should be used for critical services or offsetting the effects of the crisis . 
The handling of the crisis by [ORG PvdA  ] party leader [PER Bos  ] has given him and the party a credibility that they can use for a political advantage . 
[PER Bos  ] did not disagree in March with a poll that showed that 84% of those interviewed believed that postponing the procurement of the [ORG JSF  ] would be a good measure . 
Mixed [LOC U.S.  ] signals: ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Adding to the complexities of the decision has been the mixed signals coming from various sectors within the [LOC U.S.  ] Perhaps most often referred to by the [ORG PvdA  ] has been the [ORG Government Accounting Office  ] ( [ORG GAO  ] ) reports that have been extremely critical of the [ORG JSF  ] . 
This was compounded on a recent trip when a [ORG GAO  ] official noted that it would be too risky to proceed with buying [ORG JSF  ] aircraft . 
The uncertainty of the [LOC U.S.  ] defense budget for the [ORG JSF  ] and the subsequent impact on the overall cost of the program is also a concern to members of Parliament . 
This is the first time the [MISC Dutch  ] have been in a major equipment development program vice an off-the-shelf purchase . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] and opposition parties have Qoff-the-shelf purchase . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] and opposition parties have been extremely critical at every stage of the business plan and have focused on each and every negative report or comment from any source , credible or not . 
The extensive number of articles clearly critical of the [ORG JSF  ] from [LOC U.S.  ] sources , specifically [PER Winslow Wheeler  ] and [PER Pierre Sprey  ] , continue to add fuel to the argument against the [ORG JSF  ] program . 
Next steps: ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Parliament will continue to debate [ORG JSF  ] tonight . 
The [ORG Socialist Party  ] will reportedly introduce a resolution calling on the government to end participation in [ORG JSF  ] , and a majority of parliament appears ready to support that resolution . 
The cabinet will then consider , but is not bound by , the resolution . 
If the cabinet opposes the resolution and decides to proceed with the [ORG JSF  ] test plane purchase , in effect disregarding parliament , opposition parties are then likely to propose a vote of no confidence . 
These decisions and votes could take place today , ahead of parliament 's recess , or could require the parliament to reconvene on Tuesday , April 28 . 
[ORG PvdA  ] dilemma and prospects for a compromise: ------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) If/if there is a no confidence measure . 
[ORG PvdA  ] members will face a difficult choice . 
If they oppose the no confidence measure , they undermine their opposition to [ORG JSF  ] . 
If they support the no confidence measure , they bring down the government . 
With low numbers in the polls , [ORG PvdA  ] would expect to lose seats and perhaps any role in a future coalition government . 
The largest coalition party , PM Balkenende , s [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , also faces potential losses in an election . 
Despite these incentives for compromise , [ORG PvdA  ] leaders have left themselves little room to change position , stating they will not support the purchase . 
They insist that it is premature to commit to [ORG JSF  ] and that purchasing of the test aircraft de facto implies a decision in favor of buying [ORG JSF  ] in the future . 
In addition , [ORG PvdA  ] has seen a number of other political losses during their participation in the coalition government , including decisions on the [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment , the [ORG EU  ] referendum , and road taxes . 
Nonetheless , [ORG PvdA  ] leader [PER Marriet Hamer  ] has said this issue is not worth a cabinet crisis . 
Comment: -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The Parliamentary debate on the [ORG JSF  ] is more about politics than it is about the merits of the program . 
The coalition will most likely survive this brinkmanship by the [ORG PvdA  ] and the [PER Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) - the potential losses at the polls are too great -- but the storm will have damaged the credibility of both parties . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG JSF  ] program will continue to have fierce opponents , but ultimately the [MISC Dutch  ] will probably purchase at least one test aircraft to remain a participant in the [ORG JSF  ] program . 
The political damage and subsequent impact on next year 's decision for the purchase of operational aircraft remains to be seen . 
END COMMENT .
