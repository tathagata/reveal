( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG Summary: On  ] 5 June , [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG USCG  ] ) [ORG Drug Interdiction Specialist  ] ( [ORG DIS  ] ) assigned to the [LOC United States  ] Interests Section ( [ORG USINT  ] ) in [LOC Havana  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] attended a repatriation of sixteen [MISC Cuban  ] migrants at [LOC Bahia de Cabanas  ] . 
During the transit to and from the pier , a [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MINREX  ] ) official offered subtle insights on the possible [ORG GOC  ] approach to the upcoming migration talks between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOC  ] , and reiterated past statements regarding issues that he believes are of mutual concern between both nations . 
The conversation occurred immediately following 2 incidents involving the commandeering of a [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Border Guard  ] ( [ORG CBG  ] ) go-fast ( gf ) by 2 [ORG CBG  ] recruits , and the appearance of 7 migrants in a raft in front of the [ORG USINT  ] building . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The 5 June repatriation was the second in a week , with the first taking place on 30 May . 
[PER Armando Bencomo  ] ( [PER Bencomo  ] ) , the [ORG MINREX  ] official in attendance , was uncharacteristically quiet on 30 May , choosing not to initiate conversation regarding policy issues as he normally does . 
On 30 May , [ORG DIS  ] mentioned to [PER Bencomo  ] the prospect for re-initiation of migrant talks , to which [PER Bencomo  ] responded that his government was mulling over the offer . 
[PER Bencomo  ] , in typical fashion , made a point to reiterate that the former [MISC Bush  ] administration had quashed the talks in 2004 , and stated that the talks had previously been one of the only forms of productive candor between both parties. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Conversely , on 5 June , immediately upon embarking on the short gf trip to the migrant receiving pier at [LOC Cabanas  ] , the conversation between [ORG DIS  ] and [PER Bencomo  ] turned to the subject of the migration talks . 
However , the topic was brushed over , and [PER Bencomo  ] reiterated his past message that the [ORG GOC  ] is also interested in engaging in talks on 3 additional topics: counterdrug , counterterrorism , and natural disaster response and preparation . 
These 3 items are common themes in conversations with [PER Bencomo  ] , and [ORG DIS  ] believes , based on his repeated statements , and their recent offer to include these three topics as a way ahead between both sides , that the [ORG GOC  ] 's interest in these three items may be greater than migration-related issues. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Immediately following the repatriation , [ORG DIS  ] and [PER Bencomo  ] boarded the gf for the ten minute trip back to the parking lot in the town of [LOC Cabanas  ] . 
While boarding , in nonchalant fashion , [PER Bencomo  ] asked about the status of 2 [ORG CBG  ] recruits who commandeered a [ORG CBG  ] gf on the evening of 31 May . 
The 2 were ultimately rescued by the [ORG USCG  ] when the gf they commandeered was located broken down fifty nautical miles northwest of [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[ORG DIS  ] informed [PER Bencomo  ] that the 2 were being treated per normal migrant processing protocols , and at the time of the conversation , disposition had not been determined- the issue was dropped immediately thereafter. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) A more detailed conversation regarding the migrant talks ensued during the gf ride back to the parking area at [LOC Cabanas  ] . 
Adding the disclaimer " in my opinion , " [PER Bencomo  ] said he thought the talks will be a positive thing . 
[ORG DIS  ] asked why , and [PER Bencomo  ] continued that the venue would be a good opportunity to discuss why [MISC Cubans  ] choose to leave [LOC Cuba  ] ; specifically , [PER Bencomo  ] stated he believes the talks will help identify which factors motivate [MISC Cubans  ] to depart the island to pursue a life in the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Bencomo  ] , without naming the policy , alluded to the " wet-foot , dry-foot " policy currently in place that permits [MISC Cubans  ] who reach [LOC U.S.  ] soil to remain there legally ; [PER Bencomo  ] expressed rather subtly his disapproval of this policy . 
Further , he asserted that the talks would be a good venue where both sides might develop or agree to joint measures that would help curtail a mass migration scenario from [LOC Cuba  ] . 
In addition , he stated that the talks would help both sides to develop a response to a potential mass migration scenario . 
Finally , [PER Bencomo  ] alluded to the [MISC Cuban  ] mass migration events in 1980 and 1994 , and stated that in 1994 the [LOC U.S.  ] encouraged the behavior of [MISC Cubans  ] who chose to steal boats and depart the island by not returning those boats or treating said [MISC Cubans  ] as criminals. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Recollecting an earlier conversation in which he stated that , although the [LOC U.S.  ] had made some recent overtures towards the [ORG GOC  ] , [PER Bencomo  ] stated that the [LOC U.S.  ] could take " heavier " steps to change the nature of the relationship . 
[ORG DIS  ] asked [PER Bencomo  ] why he believed migration talks and the other three topics mentioned above were so important if the [ORG GOC  ] was so interested in seeing " heavier " changes . 
He stated that the aforementioned forums for engagement are a launching point , or segue , to further talks on larger issues , which we believe include the embargo , [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] , and the five [MISC Cuban  ] spies . 
[PER Bencomo  ] summed up the [MISC Cuban  ] outlook on the current [MISC USG-GOC  ] relationship when he stated that " everything is in your ( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) hands . 
" Note: This is a consistent theme heard from all of the [ORG DIS  ] 's [MISC Cuban  ] contacts ; [ORG GOC  ] representatives persistently reiterate in their dialogue that the status of the [MISC USG-GOC  ] is the fault of the [LOC U.S.  ] , and the road ahead lies entirely in the hands of the [LOC U.S.  ] This line of conversation is usually accompanied by an unsolicited statement by the representatives that eschews the notion of human rights and pre-conditions asserted by the [LOC U.S.  ] in any dealings with the [ORG GOC  ] ; both of these issues are so far beyond the consideration of [ORG GOC  ] officials that merely mentioning them normally turns off a conversation in its entirety. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Summary: [ORG DIS  ] assesses that the [ORG GOC  ] will attempt to place the wet-foot , dry-foot issue at the center of the upcoming migrant talks , and perhaps hammer the policy as the prime reason for illicit [MISC Cuban  ] migration departures from [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The mention of a mass migration scenario by a [MISC Cuban  ] official , especially one at the relatively high level that [PER Bencomo  ] currently holds , is unusual. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Further Summary: While the [ORG DIS  ] has significant , regular contact during repatriations with [PER Bencomo  ] , [ORG DIS  ] also has significant contact with [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( MININT ) officials while carrying out counternarcotic and countermigration duties . 
As such , [ORG DIS  ] has and continues to gather unique insight into the demeanor and consistent party line of these elements of the [ORG GOC  ] . 
[ORG GOC  ] officials tend to tow the same line ; however , [ORG DIS  ] has noticed a recent up-tick in anti-U.S. policy candor from the various [ORG GOC  ] officials . 
[ORG DIS  ] estimates this is a sign that [MISC Cuban  ] officials are uncomfortable with the shifting [LOC U.S.  ] approach to dealing with [LOC Cuba  ] demonstrated in recent months . 
In short , [ORG GOC  ] is developing a defensive posture , and is utilizing their relationship with the [ORG DIS  ] as one of an interlocutor to verbally state their interest in discussing issues of mutual cooperation ; however , their actions , or lack thereof in some cases , suggest otherwise . 
For instance , in the aftermath of a large drug bust facilitated by [MISC US-Cuban-Bahamian  ] information exchange , wherein the [ORG CBG  ] recovered a large amount of marijuana and 3 traffickers , the [MISC Cuban  ] representative from the [ORG Anti Drug Directorate  ] utilized a follow-up meeting with the [ORG DIS  ] to chastise [LOC U.S.  ] authorities in the [LOC U.S.  ] for not detecting trace amounts of marijuana concealed in ink markers and carried onto the island by [MISC Cuban  ] [MISC American  ] visitors . 
The [ORG GOC  ] mentality that they are never in the wrong , and the [LOC U.S.  ] has fostered the current poor state of relations between the two states , is more prevalent now than in the past year the [ORG DIS  ] has spent on the island .
