End summary. -------------------- [LOC Rafah  ] as a Test Case -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a November 18 meeting with [ORG NEA  ] DAS [PER Robert Danin  ] , [ORG Israel Security Agency  ] Director [PER Yuval Diskin  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] sees risks and dangers in allowing traffic between the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Nevertheless , if [LOC Rafah  ] were successful , it would also benefit [PER Qarni  ] and other crossings into [LOC Israel  ] . 
[LOC Rafah  ] is an important test case , he said . 
If the [MISC Palestinians  ] are able to manage [LOC Rafah  ] successfully , it will influence positively the opening of other passages. ---------------- [PER Fatah  ] in Trouble ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Diskin  ] expressed strong concerns about [PER Fatah  ] in the run-up to the [MISC Palestinian  ] elections . 
He said that [PER Mahmud Abbas  ] has shown no interest in party business and has not set up any mechanism to run the party while he ran the [ORG Palestinian Administration  ] . 
As a consequence , [PER Fatah  ] is disintegrating and has descended into infighting between an inactive old guard and a new guard that is ascendant but still largely excluded from the political process . 
[PER Diskin  ] predicted that the old guard would disappear after the election . 
He said the new guard does not trust [PER Mahmud Abbas  ] . 
[PER Marwan Barghuti  ] , whom he called " a real troublemaker , " is an important player and very popular . 
[PER Diskin  ] believed [PER Barghuti  ] could become the party leader in the near future . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that [PER Barghuti  ] tries to appear moderate in order to make himself more attractive and to help get himself released from [MISC Israeli  ] imprisonment , but really is one of the most extremist members of [PER Fatah  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that keeping [PER Barghuti  ] in jail is the best of the available options. --------------------- [MISC Palestinian  ] Elections --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Asked about his forecast of the [MISC Palestinian  ] election scheduled for January 2006 , [PER Diskin  ] said that the outcome would depend on the [PER Fatah  ] party list . 
He said that the likely outcome would be clearer following the upcoming primaries , even though the [ORG Central Committee  ] and not the primary would decide who is on the list . 
The best results would be for [PER Fatah  ] to receive more than 40 percent and for [ORG Hamas  ] to get less than 30 percent . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that recent polls indicated that with a strong party list , [PER Fatah  ] would receive 42 percent and [ORG Hamas  ] 20 percent. ----------------------------------------- No Coordination with [LOC PA  ] on [LOC Anti-terrorism  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Diskin  ] indicated that terrorism is still a major problem in [MISC PA-controlled  ] areas , and this was one reason why he had opposed disengagement . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that cooperation with his [MISC Palestinian  ] counterparts had been " useless " and there had been no coordination on anti-terrorist activities . 
He said that some [MISC Palestinian  ] leaders continue to support terrorist activities and had provided help to suicide bombers , and added that the problem was worse in [LOC Gaza  ] than in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that [MISC Dahlan  ] was no longer the strongman he once was in [LOC Gaza  ] , and that new stars , such as Mushrawi and [PER Hillis  ] , were on the ascendancy . 
There are at least two [ORG Hamas  ] cells in the [LOC Hebron  ] area and one in [LOC Nablus  ] , which [PER Diskin  ] called " the capital of terrorism . 
" The [ORG Shin Bet  ] had been able to thwart their activities . 
[LOC Ramallah  ] is where the " brains of [ORG Hamas  ] " are located , he suggested . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that without [PER Fatah  ] support , local commanders have no motivation to act . 
Thus , he argued , " We have to do the most to help [PER Fatah  ] . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) DAS [PER Danin  ] cleared this cable .
