07 RABAT 1838 RABAT 00001169 001.2 OF 004 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Thomas T. Riley  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The banned [MISC Islamist  ] religio-political organization [PER Al Adl  ] wal-Ihsan ( [ORG Adl  ] ) ( more commonly known as the [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Charity  ] or [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Good Works Organization  ] ) may be moving toward political participation , perhaps as a legal political party . 
[ORG Adl  ] spokesman [PER Fatallah Arsalane  ] highlighted [ORG Adl  ] 's political project to PolCouns December 11 . 
Noting stability is [ORG Adl  ] 's key goal , he denounced terrorism and violence , while protesting ongoing repression . 
[MISC Democratic  ] politics was meaningless , he said , given the powerlessness of Parliament and royal absolutism , but he did not challenge the legitimacy of the monarchy . 
[PER Arsalane  ] echoed [ORG Adl  ] 's charismatic [MISC Sufi  ] leader [PER Abdelsallam Yassine  ] 's public disavowal last summer of [ORG Adl  ] 's historic call for a [PER Caliphate  ] , reinforced by the Sheikh 's suspension of outreach , reported December 15 . 
In their often symbolic dialogue , the authorities transmitted some positive signals of their own , while still holding some [ORG Adl  ] members in jail . 
Were [ORG Adl  ] to accept the monarchy and become legal , it could enhance stability but it could also increase [MISC Islamic  ] influence on [MISC Moroccan  ] politics . 
[PER Arsalane  ] closed by extending a hand to the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration , urging changes in policies toward the region . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Al Adl  ] wal-Ihsan ( [ORG Adl  ] ) spokesman and executive committee ( [ORG Majlis al Shura  ] ) member [PER Fatallah Arsalane  ] and [PER Hassab Bennajeh  ] , the director of [ORG Adl  ] 's public relations office , met with PolCouns and [LOC Casablanca  ] PolOff ( notetaker ) at [PER Arsalane  ] 's home in [LOC Rabat  ] on December 11 . 
[PER Arsalane  ] was welcoming and spoke openly and at length about [ORG Adl  ] 's political aspirations and its difficult relationship with the [LOC GOM.  ] ------------------------------- Adl: " Stability " and [ORG Good Works  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Arsalane  ] began discussing the organization by stressing , " Our first goal , above all others , is the stability of [LOC Morocco  ] . 
" Both left and right have failed , leaving only [MISC Islam  ] as a model . 
Within [MISC Islam  ] there are moderates and extremists and , " we have chosen moderation . 
" He said [ORG Adl  ] wanted to work with other groups and political parties to help pull [LOC Morocco  ] out of the political , social and economic crises it now faces. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Adl  ] is best known for its grassroots organizational abilities and for its social welfare programs among the poor urban [MISC Moroccans  ] . 
[PER Arsalane  ] admitted that [ORG Adl  ] 's social programs were a source of its popularity , which was based more on [ORG Adl  ] 's message and ideas . 
The government ban on [ORG Adl  ] 's offering these services has only increased [ORG Adl  ] 's popularity . 
( Note: We have heard many of these efforts continue under the guise of [MISC Adl-related  ] independent NGOs . 
[ORG Adl  ] also has focused on youth ; it gained control of the student unions of most [MISC Moroccan  ] universities and the national organization of students . 
Its activists on campus continue to harass more secular students . 
) --------------------------------------------- - Repression and [MISC Dialogue: An evolving Approach  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Arsalane  ] reported that [ORG GOM  ] repression of [ORG Adl  ] is widespread and includes bans on all public activities as well as all publications . 
In recent years police have raided private meetings in homes , but many of activities are tolerated . 
His own house was kept under surveillance and he was confident that his phones were tapped , but was unconcerned , noting , " We have nothing to hide . 
" ( Note: As we departed , an apparent surveillance team of three made a choreographed exit of their vehicle , parked just behind our embassy car , making sure we noticed . 
End note . 
) RABAT 00001169 002.2 OF 004 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Arsalane  ] acknowledged that [ORG Adl  ] had over the years maintained informal communication with the [MISC Moroccan  ] regime . 
This was only rarely direct , and more often one-way and symbolic . 
He contended that the " undemocratic regime " was unwilling to engage in a more open and formal dialogue , maintained political red lines and imposed conditions on allowing [ORG Adl  ] greater scope for activity . 
" In [LOC Morocco  ] we have the motto: 'God , Nation , [ORG King'  ] but in fact the only thing that matters here is the King . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) When asked about the historic support of [ORG Adl  ] for a [PER Caliphate  ] or [MISC Islamic  ] state , [PER Arsalane  ] said this was not [ORG Adl  ] 's position , claiming legitimacy and authority comes from the people and the [LOC Ulema  ] . 
He thus substantiated the major but largely unremarked turnaround on this basic question by Sheikh [PER Yassine  ] during an interview this summer with the [MISC Arabic  ] satellite TV channel Hiwar that opened the door to [ORG Adl  ] 's potential acceptance of the monarchy -- albeit not in its current state. ------------------------------ Condemning the Use of Violence ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Arsalane  ] insisted that [ORG Adl  ] was a political organization , and opposition to violence was a key principle . 
[ORG Adl  ] also demanded that its members reject violence and expelled those who did not . 
He acknowledged that one participant in a failed bombing of a tour bus in [LOC Meknes  ] in 2007 had once been a member , but claimed that the bomber had been out of [ORG Adl  ] for a long time before the incident . 
Unprompted , [PER Arsalane  ] raised the detention and subsequent release , at the end of November , of 11 [MISC Moroccan  ] immigrants in [LOC Italy  ] , including members of [ORG Adl  ] . 
[PER Arsalane  ] strongly rejected that these members were involved in terrorism and charged the [MISC Italian  ] police were well aware of their activities . 
He contended that the arrests took place at the instigation of the [MISC Moroccan  ] government , which unable to prove any wrongdoing , falsely continued to try to paint [ORG Adl  ] members as terrorists . 
[PER Arsalane  ] contrasted [ORG Adl  ] to Salafist groups truly bent on terrorist violence . 
" We reject these extremists ... they are against us and call us 'kufar' ( non-believers ) . 
" He insisted that [ORG Adl  ] regularly condemned terrorist attacks. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) PolCouns urged that [ORG Adl  ] be more vocal in its condemnation of terrorist attacks , such as the 2007 suicide attacks against the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate General and other sites in [LOC Casablanca  ] , and other terrorist attacks around the world . 
[PER Arsalane  ] responded that [ORG Adl  ] in fact had denounced the 2003 [LOC Casablanca  ] attacks , all terrorist attacks in [LOC Morocco  ] and many elsewhere. ------------------------------------------ Intra-party dialogue on its Political Role ------------------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Arsalane  ] noted that there is a constant dialogue within [ORG Adl  ] about the extent to which the movement should participate in elections or the political process . 
He recounted that in 1981 [ORG Adl  ] had asked to become a political party , but the [ORG GOM  ] refused . 
In the lead up to the 2007 parliamentary elections , [ORG Adl  ] decided not to participate because it believed that the Parliament does not have any real power to effect change . 
" It does not matter which party is in power , even the [ORG Party of Justice and Development  ] ( [ORG PJD  ] ) . 
" If the [ORG GOM  ] were now to allow [ORG Adl  ] to become a political party , [PER Arsalane  ] averred they would accept. ---------------------- Relations with the [ORG PJD  ] ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Arsalane  ] characterized [ORG Adl  ] 's relationship with [ORG PJD  ] as respectful but denied that there is any active political cooperation except on Arab/international issues , such as [LOC Palestine  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , as in their recent joint demonstrations in [LOC Tangier  ] against a visit by senior [MISC Israeli  ] officials . 
( Comment: It is unclear just how much the undeclared [ORG Adl  ] RABAT 00001169 003.2 OF 004 boycott of the 2007 parliamentary elections contributed to the abysmally low turnout . 
If [ORG Adl  ] members had voted for the [ORG PJD  ] , the [ORG PJD  ] might have fulfilled the many predictions that it would emerge as the largest party , and would have been in a position to form the government . 
So in the convoluted logic of [MISC Moroccan  ] politics , this boycott served the regime 's purpose . 
End comment . 
) ---------------------------- Succession of Sheikh [PER Yassine  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) We asked about what would happen after the death of [ORG Adl  ] 's charismatic leader , " Sheikh " [PER Ahmed Yassine  ] , reportedly 80 and poor health . 
[PER Arsalane  ] said that [ORG Adl  ] has internal rules governing succession , which would be decided by an election of its executive committee ( [PER Majlis Ash-Shura  ] ) . ---------------------------------------- A Message to the [ORG New American Government  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Like virtually all our [MISC Moroccan  ] interlocutors , [PER Arsalane  ] expressed interest in the incoming [LOC U.S.  ] administration and asked that we convey a message to it . 
First , he said , the [ORG USG  ] should stop supporting dictatorial regimes in the region and encourage them to be more democratic . 
The [ORG USG  ] , in his view , has spoken much about principles of freedom and democracy but has observed them only when there was no conflict with [LOC U.S.  ] regional interests . 
Second , he urged that the incoming administration devote its energy from outset to helping solve the [MISC Palestinian  ] issue which would help solve many of the other problems in the region . 
Finally , he noted that prior to 9/11 many in the [MISC Islamic  ] world aspired to visit the [LOC United States  ] . 
Since then , however , many across the region , particularly moderate [MISC Islamists  ] , are afraid to visit , because they believe that [ORG USG  ] will falsely accuse and imprison them at behest of their repressive home governments . 
He also hoped some intervention could be made on behalf of party members he claimed were falsely convicted of homicide in [LOC Morocco  ] and have gone a long way towards serving their 20-year sentences. -------------------------------------- The all-Embracing [PER Makhzen  ] opens a door -------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) For its part , the authorities have responded with some positive signals to [ORG Adl  ] , s overtures . 
While the newspaper remains banned , there appears to be less tampering with the well-constructed [ORG Adl  ] website ( www.aljamaa.net in [MISC French  ] and [MISC Arabic  ] ) . 
Arrests continue but appear to be diminishing in both frequency and scope . 
The prosecution of [PER Nadia Yassine  ] , the Sheikh , s daughter , for verbal assault on the monarchy continues to be delayed . 
( [PER Note: Arsalane  ] described this as equivalent to judicial supervision . 
) In another step , earlier in the week Minister of Endowments and [MISC Islamic  ] Affairs [PER Ahmed Toufiq  ] paid a condolence call on the family of a recently deceased [ORG Adl Board  ] member and close companion of [PER Yassine  ] , whom [PER Toufiq  ] knew long ago in a common [MISC Sufi  ] brotherhood , a visit that likely required palace assent. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) On December 15 , media reported that Sheikh [PER Yassine  ] decreed that the organization would suspend all public activity , assemblies , meetings , etc. , apparently to avoid any confrontation with the authorities . 
( [PER Note:  ] This is in context of , and may be an attempt to insulate [ORG Adl  ] from , a current [ORG GOM  ] crackdown against [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
) ------- Comment ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Arsalane  ] represents an apparently growing tendency within [ORG Adl  ] that is eager to engage more actively in the political life of the country . 
In contrast to past expressions of religio-political identity , he clearly acknowledged its principally political nature and RABAT 00001169 004.2 OF 004 aspirations , pointedly making little or no reference to it being a religious body . 
It is unclear to what extent Sheikh [PER Yassine  ] 's own epiphany is behind this evolution of the movement , or whether he is reflecting the wishes of the politicized next generation , be it [PER Arsalane  ] and his politicized cohort or the sheikh 's daughter [PER Nadia Yassine  ] -- who appear to be rivals . 
There has been widespread speculation that after the sheikh 's death there will be a split in the organization . 
It now seems clear that either way the politicos will dominate , with the religious element possibly becoming a parallel organization , as is the case with the [ORG PJD  ] and its religious counterpart the [ORG Movement for Unity and Reform  ] ( [ORG MUR  ] ) . <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Although [PER Arsalane  ] was adamant that the GOM/Palace has not engaged in a formal dialogue with [ORG Adl  ] , it is clear that an understanding is developing between them . 
The [ORG GOM  ] has tolerated the activities of [ORG Adl  ] so long as it did not press the question of the king 's legitimacy or take steps to mobilize its followers against regime . 
Some analysts believe that [ORG Adl  ] has played a critical role as a release valve for social and political tensions through a non-violent organization . 
Certainly , [ORG Adl  ] exploited these frustrations to swell its ranks . 
The [ORG GOM  ] periodically alleges [ORG Adl  ] involvement in violent or terrorist activities , as it apparently did in [LOC Italy  ] , but has presented no evidence for this . 
All indications appear to substantiate [ORG Adl  ] 's commitment to avoid violence. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [ORG Adl  ] 's potential buy-in to the system could have an important effect on enhancing stability in [LOC Morocco  ] , just at a time when it is under pressure due to the global economic downturn . 
It would also , however , increase [MISC Islamic  ] influence on politics , adding to the leverage of the [ORG PJD  ] , but even together , [MISC Islamists  ] would almost certainly remain a minority . 
Like most politics here , this potential " conversion " to legitimacy will remain for some time obscure , and play out only over time . 
End comment. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Note A: The last time mission has had contact with [PER Arsalane  ] was before 9/11/2001 , and the government protested . 
We have heard no such protest so far . 
We have avoided contact with [PER Nadia Yassine  ] since her indictment , and have been in touch only at a lower level. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( SBU ) Note B: Al [ORG Adl  ] wal-Ihsan has frequently been translated as the [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Charity Organization  ] , with the familiar acronym [ORG JCO  ] . 
In fact , the organization itself prefers the translation [ORG Justice  ] and Spirituality . 
While perhaps the best translation of the [MISC Islamic  ] concept of [MISC Ihsan  ] would be " good works , " the term encompasses that notion as well as charity and the performance of spiritual acts . 
Following local press usage , we plan to continue to use [ORG Adl  ] ( [ORG Justice  ] ) .
