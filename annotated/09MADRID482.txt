See paragraph 12 . 
SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] 's [MISC MON810  ] corn crop is under threat from an emerging well-coordinated campaign to ban cultivation of genetically engineered seed varieties in [LOC Europe  ] , according to industry sources . 
The campaign has gained strength and speed in recent months with the April 14 [MISC German  ] ban on [MISC MON810  ] cultivation - which followed an [ORG EU  ] vote supporting maintenance of a ban in [LOC Austria  ] and [LOC Hungary  ] . 
Legislation which threatens [MISC MON810  ] cultivation has also been introduced recently in both the [MISC Basque  ] and [ORG Catalonian Regional Parliaments.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to invocation of a safeguard and emergency measure to suspend [MISC MON810  ] cultivation in [LOC France  ] , the [ORG European Food Safety Authority  ] 's ( [ORG EFSA  ] ) [ORG Scientific Opinion of October  ] 29 , 2008 found no new scientific evidence of risk related to [MISC MON810  ] plantings . 
The [ORG EFSA  ] report , however , is being questioned . 
[ORG Monsanto  ] maintains that anti-MON810 momentum was gained by a de facto agreement between the Government of [LOC France  ] and Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth whereby the [ORG GOF  ] would support the anti-GMO movement and environmental activists would turn a blind eye to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's nuclear energy initiatives . 
A senior [MISC Spanish  ] agriculture official has expressed concern that [LOC Spain  ] is under increasing pressure within the [ORG EU  ] . 
Post requests renewed USG support of [LOC Spain  ] 's science-based agricultural biotechnology position , as well as support for a non-USG science fellow to interact with [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors . 
End Summary . 
BACKGROUND <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] was the first [ORG EU  ] country to grow genetically modified ( [ORG GM  ] ) corn and now cultivates nearly 75 percent of the [ORG EU  ] 's [MISC MON810  ] corn crop - nearly 200,000 acres . 
During a May 13 meeting with [ORG Monsanto  ] 's Director for Biotechnology for [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Portugal  ] , Embassy officials were told that [LOC Spain  ] is increasingly becoming a target of anti-biotechnology forces within [LOC Europe  ] and that [LOC Spain  ] 's cultivation of [LOC MON810  ] corn was under serious threat . 
The sentiment echoed by supporters of agricultural biotechnology regarding a ban on [MISC MON810  ] cultivation in [LOC Spain  ] is that " If [LOC Spain  ] falls , the rest of [LOC Europe  ] will follow . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Anti-biotechnology activists in the [ORG EU  ] have gained momentum in recent weeks . 
On April 14 , [LOC Germany  ] announced a ban on the cultivation of [LOC MON810  ] following similar bans in [LOC France  ] , [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Hungary  ] , [LOC Greece  ] and [LOC Luxembourg  ] , despite [ORG EU  ] approval of [LOC MON810  ] as safe for commercial use . 
This followed a March 2 vote in which [LOC Spain  ] joined with [LOC France  ] and other [ORG EU  ] corn producers to allow [LOC Austria  ] and [LOC Hungary  ] to maintain their provisional bans on the use and sale of [LOC MON810  ] corn . 
According to Ministry sources , this surprising vote did not represent a change in position by [LOC Spain  ] on biotechnology ; rather , technical considerations justified upholding the provisional bans pending [MISC EU-wide  ] renewal of [LOC MON810  ] corn . 
Industry contacts , however , assert that [LOC Spain  ] 's vote was a political gesture to thank [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] for helping to arrange President [ORG Zapatero  ] 's presence at the November 2008 G-20 financial summit in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The [ORG GOS  ] has traditionally been a strong supporter of biotech corn due to high domestic demand for feed corn within the livestock sector . 
[LOC Spain  ] is the number two pork producer within the [ORG EU  ] and the number one corn importer . 
[ORG GM  ] corn plantings in [LOC Spain  ] reached nearly 200,000 acres in 2008 - approximately 30 percent of total [MISC Spanish  ] feed corn production . 
Cultivation of [LOC MON810  ] corn is mainly concentrated in [LOC Aragon  ] and [LOC Catalonia  ] , where the [MISC European  ] corn borer , which [MISC MON810  ] protects against , is a serious pest . 
The feed compound industry and the livestock sector are supportive of [ORG GM  ] corn . 
Within the agriculture sector , only left-wing farmers' unions have negative opinions of [LOC GMOs  ] . 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Anti-GMO forces periodically attempt to build support for a prohibition on [ORG GMO  ] cultivation in [LOC Spain  ] . 
According to [ORG Monsanto  ] 's biotechnology director , two left-wing parties have recently discussed introducing such legislation in the [MISC Spanish  ] parliament . 
A Socialist ( ruling ) party Member offered reassurances that his party would oppose such a move , but advised that the issue bears watching , especially given the government 's uncertain majority. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) In addition , there have been worrisome developments in several of [LOC Spain  ] 's 17 autonomous communities , which , led by [LOC MADRID  ] 00000482 002.2 OF 002 [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [LOC Basque Country  ] , continue to seek more autonomy via a vis the central government . 
In March 2008 , the [LOC Canary Islands  ] were declared [MISC GM-free  ] . 
Since fewer than 1,380 acres of corn are grown in the [LOC Canaries  ] , this is considered mostly a symbolic gesture . 
However , on February 5 , 2009 , an initiative was proposed in the [ORG Catalonian Regional Parliament  ] to declare the region [MISC GM-free  ] . 
The initiative has not yet come up for a vote , and its prospects are uncertain . 
Such an action would be cause for serious concern , since [LOC Catalonia  ] is a center of [ORG GMO  ] corn cultivation . 
More recently , on April 21 , 2009 , the [ORG Basque Parliament  ] passed stringent biotech coexistence legislation which could likely force farmers to halt planting of [LOC MON810  ] due to strict compliance issues . 
The [ORG Spanish Association of Biotechnology Industries  ] ( [ORG ANOVE  ] ) will challenge the [MISC Basque  ] legislation. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In February 2008 , [LOC France  ] notified to the [ORG EC  ] an Order suspending cultivation of [LOC MON810  ] and further invoked safeguard and emergency measures to provisionally prohibit the cultivation of [LOC MON810  ] on its territory . 
In response , the [ORG Scientific Panel  ] on [ORG Genetically Modified Organisms  ] of the [ORG European Food Safety Authority  ] ( [ORG EFSA  ] ) issued a [ORG Scientific Opinion  ] on October 29 , 2008 . 
In its report , the panel assessed the package of documents supporting and justifying the [MISC French  ] safeguard clause and the duration of the invoked measure . 
The panel concluded that , in terms of risk to human and animal health and the environment , the information provided by [LOC France  ] presented no new scientific evidence that would invalidate the previous risk assessments of [LOC MON810  ] . 
It further concluded that invoking the safeguard clause and emergency measure was scientifically unjustified . 
The [ORG EU  ] is currently facing the [LOC MON810  ] cultivation renewal process . 
The renewal is the legal condition for the lifting of the ban under [MISC French  ] law . 
Within the scientific review carried out by [ORG EFSA  ] , the [MISC Spanish  ] authorities and experts have completed the environmental risk assessment for [LOC MON810  ] corn . 
According to [ORG Monsanto  ] , the [ORG EFSA Scientific Opinion  ] report is being questioned . 
The [ORG GOF  ] has sent letters to different Member [MISC States  ] urging them to sign up and request an in-depth examination of the application for the renewal of [LOC MON810.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Monsanto  ] asserts that anti-MON810 momentum was gained by a de facto agreement between the Government of [LOC France  ] and Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth whereby the [ORG GOF  ] would support the [MISC GMO-free  ] movement if activists turned a blind eye to President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's nuclear energy initiatives . 
In [LOC Spain  ] , agricultural factions against agricultural biotechnology include the environmental side of [ORG MARM  ] and organic farmers . 
Increasingly , consumers are also expressing negative attitudes toward genetically modified crops . 
On April 18th , the newspaper " [MISC El Pas  ] " conducted a survey on whether or not [ORG GM  ] food should be prohibited . 
The following results were obtained after a one month period: 85 percent voted " Yes , they can be dangerous " and 15 percent voted " No , they are absolutely safe " . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Secretary of State and Deputy Minister [PER Josep Puxeu  ] contacted the [LOC Charg  ] d'Affaires on April 22 , following the [MISC Basque  ] vote on coexistence and the [MISC German  ] ban , to express his concern that the Government of [LOC Spain  ] is under increasing pressure to ban [LOC MON810  ] cultivation . 
[PER Puxeu  ] , a long-time supporter of agricultural biotechnology , lamented that it was " the most complicated week of my life . 
" He asked that the [ORG USG  ] maintain pressure on [LOC Brussels  ] to keep agricultural biotechnology an option for Member [MISC States  ] and requested that the [ORG USG  ] work together with [LOC Spain  ] in this endeavor . 
Deputy Minister [PER Puxeu  ] is becoming increasingly isolated on biotech issues at the Ministry OF Environment and and [ORG Rural and Marine Affairs  ] ( [ORG MARM  ] ) due to the rising influence of environmental officials within [ORG MARM  ] as well as the increased influence of [LOC France  ] within the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
While [ORG MARM  ] Minister [PER Espinosa  ] has come out publicly in favor of genetic engineering in agriculture , her views on issues will generally reflect those of the [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] which has recently shown itself to be fickle when it comes to voting against [LOC France  ] 's anti-GMO interests. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ACTION REQUESTED: In response to recent urgent requests by [ORG MARM  ] State Secretary [PER Josep Puxeu  ] and [ORG Monsanto  ] , post requests renewed [ORG USG  ] support of [LOC Spain  ] 's science-based agricultural biotechnology position through high-level [ORG USG  ] intervention in support of the [ORG EFSA  ] findings . 
Post also requests [ORG USG  ] support for a non-USG science fellow to meet with influential [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors on this issue and assistance with developing an agricultural biotechnology action plan for [LOC Spain  ] . 
Post would also welcome any comments from other posts concerning the anti-GMO campaign .
