Cretz  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B/D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: [PER Frances Fragos Townsend  ] , Assistant to the President for [ORG Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  ] ( [ORG AFHSC  ] ) , met [ORG Mossad  ] Director [PER Meir Dagan  ] on July 12 for a general discussion of regional security threats . 
On the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , [PER Dagan  ] proved surprisingly optimistic about the effects of [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) resolutions and their impact on [MISC Iranian  ] elites . 
On most other fronts , however , [PER Dagan  ] expressed deep skepticism regarding any near-term solutions . 
[PER Dagan  ] believes that the [MISC Syrians  ] were emboldened by the Second [LOC Lebanon  ] War , and argued for a concerted international effort to enforce [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions in [LOC Lebanon  ] as a means of removing [LOC Syria  ] from [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
In [PER Dagan  ] 's personal opinion , present attempts to prop up the government of Prime Minister [PER Salam Fayyad  ] will fail , and " an entirely new approach " with the [MISC Palestinians  ] is required . 
[PER Dagan  ] and [PER Townsend  ] surveyed political developments in [LOC North Africa  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , and the [LOC Gulf  ] , and shared concerns about [LOC Pakistan  ] 's ability to withstand the challenge of [MISC Islamic  ] radicals . 
END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------- Financial Sanctions [PER Offer Hope  ] on [LOC Iran  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Mossad  ] Director [PER Meir Dagan  ] began his two-hour meeting with [PER Townsend  ] by expressing satisfaction with sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Dagan  ] said [ORG UNSC Resolutions  ] 1737 and 1747 caught the [MISC Iranians  ] off-guard , and were having an impact on the [MISC Iranian  ] elite and financial community . 
The resolutions had been particularly successful through their indirect consequences , explained [PER Dagan  ] , by stigmatizing [MISC Iranian  ] businesses and discouraging risk-averse [MISC Europeans  ] from being connected with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Dagan  ] praised ongoing [MISC GOI-USG  ] cooperation on this front , and added that domestic economic problems were creating additional pressure on the regime. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) With regard to their nuclear program , [PER Dagan  ] said the [MISC Iranians  ] are attempting to convey a " false presentation " that they have mastered the uranium enrichment process . 
The reality is that they are not there yet , said [PER Dagan  ] , and they are paying a heavy political price ( sanctions ) for something they have yet to achieve . 
[PER Dagan  ] noted growing antipathy in [LOC Russia  ] towards [LOC Iran  ] and its nuclear program , and said the [MISC Iranians  ] were shocked by [MISC Russian  ] statements accusing them of supporting terrorism against the [LOC United States  ] . 
In [PER Dagan  ] 's view , there is no ideological conflict within the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership ( all wish to see the destruction of [LOC Israel  ] ) , but there is a growing divide on tactics with some supporting a retaliatory position against the [LOC West  ] and others favoring new policies of moderation . 
Recognizing the growing strength of the moderate camp , [PER Dagan  ] said that the militant followers of President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] are now trying to target supporters of [PER Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  ] as spies. --------------------------------------------- - [MISC Gulf States  ] Await Action ( From Others ) on [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) According to [PER Dagan  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and the [MISC Gulf States  ] all fear [LOC Iran  ] , but want someone else " to do the job for them . 
" [PER Townsend  ] and [PER Dagan  ] discussed the current state of affairs in the [MISC Saudi  ] royal court , where the [ORG Mossad  ] Chief accused Foreign Minister [PER Saud  ] bin Faysal of playing a " very negative role . 
" He also pointed to the recent visit of the [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] to [LOC Jordan  ] as a historical first and turning point for relations between the two countries . 
[PER Townsend  ] agreed , and said that the [MISC Saudi  ] king has a sense of urgency on the political front . 
[PER Dagan  ] characterized [LOC Qatar  ] as " a real problem , " and accused Sheikh [PER Hamid  ] of " annoying everyone . 
" In his view , [LOC Qatar  ] is trying to play all sides -- [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] -- in an effort to achieve security and some degree of independence . 
" I think you should remove your bases from there...seriously , " said [PER Dagan  ] . 
" They have confidence only because of the [LOC U.S.  ] presence . 
" [PER Dagan  ] predicted , with some humor , that al-Jazeera would be the next cause of war in the [LOC Middle East  ] as some [MISC Arab  ] leaders ( specifically [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ) are willing to take drastic steps to shut down the channel , and hold Sheikh [PER Hamid  ] personally responsible for its provocations. ---------------------------- [LOC Syria  ] Taking Dangerous Risks ---------------------------- [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002280 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dagan  ] echoed other reports that [LOC Syria  ] expects an [MISC Israeli  ] attack this summer , and has raised its level of readiness . 
Despite the fact that [LOC Israel  ] has no intention of attacking , said [PER Dagan  ] , the [MISC Syrians  ] are likely to retaliate over even the smallest incident , which could lead to quick escalation . 
[PER Dagan  ] believes that [LOC Syria  ] 's strategic alliance with [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] has not changed , and that [PER Assad  ] views these policies as both " successful and just . 
" There is a tendency to assume that [LOC Syria  ] can be separated from [LOC Iran  ] , said [PER Dagan  ] , and that this offers the key to weakening [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[PER Dagan  ] argued that the opposite is true: by enforcing [ORG UN  ] resolutions on [LOC Lebanon  ] and increasing efforts to disarm [ORG Hizballah  ] , the international community can remove the glue that binds [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
Enforcing the resolutions would put additional pressure on [PER Assad  ] , who fears being tried for the assassination of [MISC Lebanese  ] Prime Minister [PER Rafiq Hariri  ] above all else . 
The advantage of such an approach , continued [PER Dagan  ] , is that the legal ground is already in place for action by the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
This credible threat could sufficiently frighten [LOC Syria  ] away from [LOC Iran  ] and towards more natural allies in the [LOC Arab League.  ] --------------------------------------------- Deep Pessimism on Relations With [MISC Palestinians  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Departing from official [ORG GOI  ] policy , [PER Dagan  ] expressed his personal opinion that after more than a decade of trying to reach a final status agreement with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , " nothing will be achieved . 
" Only [MISC Israeli  ] military operations against [ORG Hamas  ] in the [LOC West Bank  ] prevent them from expanding control beyond [LOC Gaza  ] , lamented [PER Dagan  ] , without which [LOC Fatah  ] would fall within one month and [ORG Abbas  ] would join his " mysteriously wealthy " son in [LOC Qatar  ] . 
Offering what he believed to be a conservative estimate , [PER Dagan  ] said that USD 6 billion had been invested in the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] since <a id='par1994' href='#par1994'>¶</a>1994 . 
" What did it accomplish , other than adding a few more people to the [MISC Fortune 500  ] ? 
" asked [PER Dagan  ] . 
Although he expressed his personal faith in [PER Salam Fayyad  ] , [PER Dagan  ] said that the [MISC Palestinian  ] Prime Minister had no power base . 
[LOC Fatah  ] as a party would have to completely reorganize itself in order to regain credibility , argued [PER Dagan  ] , but instead they have turned once again to the " old guard . 
" The [ORG Mossad  ] Chief suggested that a completely new approach was required , but did not provide [PER Townsend  ] any additional details. -------------------------------------- Pakistan...and Other [MISC Regional Concerns  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Townsend  ] and [PER Dagan  ] then embarked on an informal tour of the region , comparing notes on countries critical to combating terrorism . 
[PER Dagan  ] characterized a [LOC Pakistan  ] ruled by radical [MISC Islamists  ] with a nuclear arsenal at their disposal as his biggest nightmare . 
[ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and other " Global Jihad " groups could not be relied upon to behave rationally once in possession of nuclear weapons , said [PER Dagan  ] , as they do not care about the well being of states or their image in the media . 
" We have to keep ( President [PER Pervez  ] ) [PER Musharaf  ] in power , " said [PER Dagan  ] . 
In [LOC North Africa  ] , [PER Dagan  ] contended that [PER Qaddafi  ] needs to be pushed more in order to put [LOC Libya  ] on the right track . 
[PER Qaddafi  ] faces little domestic pressure , said [PER Dagan  ] , but has traditionally responded to outside threats and runs foreign policy based on his emotions . 
The only reason [PER Qaddafi  ] moderated his position to begin with , said [PER Dagan  ] , was that he feared that he was " in the crosshairs " for regime change . 
[PER Dagan  ] viewed the situation in [LOC Algeria  ] as more serious , with the south of the country becoming increasingly dangerous and the leadership uncertain as it faces radical [MISC Islamic  ] forces . 
[LOC Morocco  ] is coping better with these issues " in spite of the king , " said [PER Dagan  ] , who appears to take little interest in governing . 
In [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Dagan  ] said that [MISC Islamists  ] there are not of the same cloth as others in the region , but he does fear that they are slowly breaking down the secular character of the state and could become more radical over time . 
[PER Dagan  ] argued that if the [MISC Turkish  ] military received more direct support from the [LOC United States  ] , it would be better able to prevent the rise of [MISC Islamists.  ] ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [ORG Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the [ORG State Department  ] 's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002280 003 OF 003 CRETZ</pre></code>
