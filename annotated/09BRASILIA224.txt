[PER Vargas  ] expects [PER Amorim  ] to raise the upcoming meeting between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Lula  ] , where [PER Lula  ] will likely want to discuss the financial crisis and [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC South America  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) [PER Vargas  ] , who expects to be confirmed as [LOC Brazil  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Germany  ] shortly after congress reconvenes in March , was joined by his successor as Under Secretary for Political Affairs Ambassador [PER Vera Machado  ] , who just returned to [LOC Brasilia  ] after serving as ambassador to the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
( [PER Note: Vargas  ] 's portfolio has recently been divided into two with the creation of a new Under [ORG Secretariat for Energy and Technology  ] , now under Ambassador [PER Andre Amado  ] . 
[PER Machado  ] will keep environment , international organizations , transnational crimes , [LOC Europe  ] , the [LOC United States  ] , and [LOC Canada  ] in her portfolio . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Vargas  ] is focused on preparing FM [PER Amorim  ] for his February 25 meeting with the Secretary . 
He stressed that the " cornerstone " of [PER Amorim  ] 's message to the Secretary , which will " permeate all other ideas , " is [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire to build on the progress in bilateral relations made over the last two years , and to continue the growing level of dialogue between our countries . 
[PER Amorim  ] will likely raise the planned March 17 meeting between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Lula  ] . 
They principally view the meeting as a " get acquainted " session on which to build future relations and hope to have an " open agenda . 
" In addition to the bilateral relationship , they expect President [PER Lula  ] will want to discuss the financial crisis , [ORG UN Security Council Reform  ] , [MISC South American  ] integration , and [LOC U.S.  ] relations with the region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Vargas  ] , the specific issues on [PER Amorim  ] 's agenda will include: -- Summit of the [MISC Americas:  ] [PER Amorim  ] expects that it will focus on the financial crisis , and does not want a " strait-jacketed " agenda , as the leaders should be free to discuss the most urgent issues for the region . 
[LOC Brazil  ] sees the [ORG SOA  ] as a valuable opportunity for the new [LOC U.S.  ] President to meet his regional counterparts , to discuss his [ORG Administration  ] 's agenda for the region , and to strengthen cooperation . 
In this regard , [PER Vargas  ] believes FM [PER Amorim  ] will want to stress to the Secretary that it is important for the [LOC United States  ] to recognize that the region has matured politically , economically , and socially . 
With regard to [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Vargas  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] is pleased with the new [ORG Administration  ] 's actions with regard to [LOC Guantanamo  ] and eventually hopes to see relations between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] normalized . 
( Comment: It has become increasingly apparent over the last few months that the GOB views the [ORG SOA  ] not as a gathering in which a single region , the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] , develops a common agenda , but rather as a forum for [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] to engage the [LOC United States  ] and , to a lesser extent , [LOC Canada  ] , much as regional leaders regularly engage [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Portugal  ] , [MISC Arab  ] states , and [LOC Africa  ] . 
End comment . 
) -- [ORG Regional Energy Cooperaton: Vargas  ] said that [PER Amorim  ] is aware of [LOC U.S.  ] interest in this issue and would like to know more about the [ORG Administration  ] 's plans . 
Stating that he had been opposed originally to the [MISC U.S.-Brazil Biofuels  ] MOU for fear that it would never get off the ground , [PER Vargas  ] said he is pleased that our cooperation in third countries now has good momentum and believes it could be enlarged , but stressed that [ORG MRE  ] has had to apply a great deal of pressure to ensure it is implemented . 
( Comment: [PER Vargas'  ] non-commital stance with regard to hemispheric energy matters contrasts with the more negative view of his [ORG MRE  ] colleagues dealing with energy matters , inclding U/S [PER Amado  ] , who recently expressed very negative views about the prospects for a hemispheric energy agreement ( ref A ) . 
[ORG MRE  ] 's views differ from those expressed by Ambassador [PER Marcel Biato  ] , foreign affairs advisor in the [LOC Presidency  ] , in a February 20 meeting with congressional staffers ( septel ) . 
[PER Biato  ] indicated that [LOC Brazil  ] was open to hearing more from the [LOC United States  ] regarding our proposal for energy cooperation , thought there would be ample areas for cooperation , and believed it could be one of the significant areas for cooperation to come out of the [ORG SOA  ] . 
Vice-Minister of [ORG Mines and Energy  ] [PER Roberto Zimmerman  ] likewise told the Ambassador February 21 that he saw [LOC U.S.  ] overtures on regional energy cooperation as timely , relevant , and important , indicating that he saw a number of possible areas for regional cooperation ( septel ) . 
End comment . 
) -- [PER Haiti: Vargas  ] said that [LOC Haiti  ] is very much on [PER Amorim  ] 's mind . 
He would like to pursue further cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and wants to hear the new [ORG Administration  ] 's views . 
" We can't stay there forever , " he said , so it will be important to make the political process there more stable . 
In particular , he said , it will be important to ensure a successful transition to Preval 's successor . 
-- [ORG Middle East: Vargas  ] confirmed that [PER Amorim  ] will attend the upcoming meeting in [LOC Sharm el Sheikh  ] , and said that he will want to hear the Secretary 's perspective on the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process . 
-- [ORG UN Reform: Amorim  ] will want to discuss [ORG UN  ] reform , and [ORG Security Council  ] reform in particular . 
-- [PER G-20: Amorim  ] will likely seek the Secretary 's views on the global financial crisis going into the April 2 G-20 leaders meeting. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: One issue that is almost certainly not on [PER Amorim  ] 's mind is the future of bilateral defense cooperation . 
We continue to believe this is an important area for future cooperation between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , and that a successful [ORG Boeing  ] bid to sell the [LOC F/A-18  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] holds the potential to enhance this partnership in unparalleled ways over the next decades . 
As the purchase decision moves to the political levels over the next months , [PER Amorim  ] will be one of a handful of senior officials advising President [PER Lula  ] on it . 
We recommend using the upcoming meeting to discuss with [PER Amorim  ] the importance the [LOC United States  ] attaches to this sale , our commitment to appropriate technology transfer in relation to the sale , and our understanding of [LOC Brazil  ] 's interest in using the purchase to enhance its domestic defense industry .
