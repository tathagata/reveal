( C ) Summary . 
After years of preparation , [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Vladimir Putin  ] , accompanied by 400 assistants , journalists and business executives in six planes , visited [LOC Libya  ] on April 16-17 primarily to secure an agreement on [LOC Libya  ] 's sizeable [MISC Soviet-era  ] debt . 
[LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Russia  ] agreed to swap the $4.5 billion debt for a large railroad contract and several future contracts in housing construction and electricity development . 
At [MISC Libyan  ] insistence , the two sides signed an [ORG MOU  ] committing them in principle to formalize a civilian nuclear agreement by the end of 2008 . 
While [MISC Russian  ] diplomats in [LOC Tripoli  ] maintain that [PER Putin  ] did not have a political agenda for his visit , [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar Qadhafi  ] used the opportunity to claim he opposes [ORG NATO  ] expansion to [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] and to advocate for his one-state solution to the [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] problem . 
[PER Putin  ] also raised -- without success -- the case of a detained [MISC Russian  ] national and [ORG LUKoil  ] employee who remains in pre-trial detention since his arrest under unclear circumstances in November 2007 . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Libya  ] briefed [ORG CDA  ] on [PER Putin  ] 's visit on April 23 and [LOC Poloff  ] followed up in a separate meeting with [MISC Russian  ] [PER Poloff  ] [PER Evgeny Kozlov  ] on April 24 . 
[LOC MARATHON  ] , 26-HOUR MEETING ON LIBYA'S $4.5 BILLION DEBT <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Finalizing an agreement on [MISC Russian  ] forgiveness of [LOC Libya  ] 's sizeable [MISC Soviet-era  ] debt topped [LOC Russia  ] 's agenda for President [PER Putin  ] 's April 16-17 visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
After a marathon , 26-hour meeting between [MISC Russian  ] Finance Minister [PER Aleksei Kudrin  ] and his [MISC Libyan  ] counterpart , the two countries agreed that [LOC Russia  ] would forgive [LOC Libya  ] 's $4.5 billion debt and , in exchange , [LOC Libya  ] would sign commercial contracts on railways , housing construction , electricity development , and road construction . 
[LOC Libya  ] opened the negotiations by stating that [LOC Libya  ] did not recognize any debt to [LOC Russia  ] and , instead , demanded that [LOC Russia  ] offer financial compensation for [LOC Russia  ] 's role in passing and enforcing [ORG UN  ] sanctions against [LOC Libya  ] in the 1980s and 1990s. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Kozlov  ] , who was present throughout the negotiations , the two delegations " locked themselves in " the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] at 9 [ORG AM  ] on April 16 and , with only a one-hour break from 18:30-19:30 , did not emerge with an agreement until 11 [ORG AM  ] on April 17 -- a half hour after [PER Putin  ] was scheduled to sign the debt agreement . 
[PER Kozlov  ] closely connected [PER Putin  ] 's visit to the debt issue , noting that [PER Putin  ] made clear to [PER Qadhafi  ] that he did not engage in " political tourism " and would not leave without an agreement on the debt . 
Both [PER Qadhafi  ] and [PER FM Abdulrahman Shalgham  ] were in regular phone contact with the [MISC Libyan  ] Finance Minister throughout the 26-hour negotiations . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] INSISTS ON INKING CIVILIAN NUCLEAR [ORG MOU  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During the visit , the two sides also signed -- at [MISC Libyan  ] insistence -- an [ORG MOU  ] committing both sides to side a formal cooperation agreement on civilian uses of nuclear energy by the end of 2008 . 
[PER Kozlov  ] noted that [LOC Libya  ] hoped to sign a formal civilian nuclear agreement during the visit ; however , no language had been agreed to before the visit and [LOC Russia  ] refused to sign without further consultations . 
[PER Kozlov  ] reiterated that the civilian nuclear agreement will establish a general framework for future cooperation and will not/not include any specific projects . 
Current Libyan-Russian cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy -- limited to a few [MISC Russian  ] technical experts working at the [LOC Tajoura  ] nuclear facility -- is based on an " outdated " [MISC Soviet-era  ] agreement with [LOC Libya  ] ; according to [PER Kozlov  ] , [LOC Russia  ] hopes to " modernize " the framework for nuclear cooperation . 
He added that the [MISC Libyans  ] are chiefly interested in acquiring nuclear-powered water desalination technology and that [LOC Libya  ] is stringing along several possible sellers , including [LOC France  ] , before it decides what to buy . 
Noting [MISC Libyan  ] dissatisfaction with slow progress on [MISC Libyan  ] efforts to purchase civilian nuclear technology from [LOC France  ] following President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's July 2007 visit to [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Kozlov  ] cautioned that the [MISC Russian  ] side made clear that any [MISC Russian  ] sales will not/not be quicker than the [MISC French  ] deal . 
RAILROAD CONTRACT ONLY COMMERCIAL DEAL SIGNED DURING VISIT <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador downplayed the value of commercial contracts to [ORG CDA  ] in an April 23 briefing for select foreign diplomats . 
[LOC Russia  ] only signed one contract during the visit -- a 2.2 billion euro , four-year contact for the construction of approximately 500km of railroad between [ORG Sirte  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
Despite press reports to the contrary , [MISC Russian  ] diplomats maintain that no military contracts were signed during the visit . 
[PER Kozlov  ] anticipated that , in the near-term , [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Russia  ] would also sign commercial contracts on housing construction in [LOC Janzour  ] and [LOC Zawiya  ] , electricity line installation , road construction , and possibly an additional section of [LOC Libya  ] 's planned coastal railroad between [LOC Tunisia  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
In addition , the two sides signed a general agreement on promotion of investments , an [ORG MOU  ] on economic cooperation , an agreement on the protection of confidential commercial and military information , and three MOUs on oil/gas exploration between [ORG Gazprom  ] and the [MISC Libyan  ] authorities . 
[ORG QADHAFI CLAIMS TO OPPOSE  ] [ORG NATO  ] EXPANSION <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In over six hours of private meetings on April 16-17 , [PER Qadhafi  ] voiced his satisfaction that [LOC Russia  ] 's increased strength can serve as a necessary counterbalance to [LOC U.S.  ] power , echoing the [MISC Libyan  ] leader 's frequent support for a more multi-polar international system . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] also raised the issue of [ORG NATO  ] expantion to [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] , assuring the [MISC Russian  ] President that [LOC Libya  ] opposes any further expansion of [ORG NATO  ] . 
( Note: According to [PER Kozlov  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] has learned that [PER Qadhafi  ] voiced strong support for [LOC Ukraine  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] bid during [MISC Ukrainian  ] President [PER Aleksandr Yushchenko  ] 's April 2008 visit to [LOC Libya  ] . 
End note . 
) The two leaders also discussed [PER Qadhafi  ] 's vision for a one-state solution to the [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] conflict . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] leader expressed luke-warm support for [MISC Russian  ] plans to convene a [LOC Middle East  ] peace conference in [LOC Moscow  ] , reflecting [LOC Libya  ] 's long reluctance to participate in any meeting that advocates a two-state solution to the [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] conflict . 
The two leaders did not/not discuss non-proliferation or [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions . 
[ORG PUTIN RAISES CASE  ] OF DETAINED [ORG LUKOIL  ] REP <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] also raised with [PER Qadhafi  ] the case of detained [ORG LUKoil  ] Overseas representative [PER Aleksandr Tsyganov  ] . 
According to [PER Kozlov  ] , [MISC Libyan  ] security services arrested [PER Tsyganov  ] , a [MISC Russian  ] national , in November 2007 . 
Despite repeated requests for an official explanation of the charges against [PER Tsyganov  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has received only an " informal explanation " that [PER Tsyganov  ] is charged with disclosing the " secret " location of the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Noting that bribery allegations related to a contract tender have surfaced in the press , [PER Kozlov  ] said that the [MISC Libyan  ] government had never mentioned bribery charges and instead told the [MISC Russians  ] that [PER Tsyganov  ] 's case had been referred to a state security court . 
( Note: [MISC Libyan  ] security officials have indicated that he was arrested on suspicion of espionage . 
End note . 
) The [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador and Consul have met " several times " with [PER Tsyganov  ] ; however , [PER Kozlov  ] noted that arranging a meeting was exceedingly difficult and that the Ambassador had only been allowed to visit [PER Tsyganov  ] at the [MISC Bourj  ] al-Fatah office building in [LOC Tripoli  ] and not/not at [PER Tsyganov  ] 's detention facility . 
[PER Tsyganov  ] remains in pre-trial detention at an unknown facility . 
According to [PER Kozlov  ] , as a result of [PER Putin  ] 's failure to gain traction on the case during his visit , the [MISC Russians  ] are prepared to " reciprocate " by arresting a [MISC Libyan  ] businessman in [LOC Russia  ] . 
PROTOCOLARY SURPRISES <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian  ] diplomats in [LOC Tripoli  ] described [PER Putin  ] as " very patient " with [LOC Libya  ] 's unusual way of doing business . 
Upon [PER Putin  ] 's arrival at [PER Qadhafi  ] 's compound , [PER Qadhafi  ] drove up in a golf cart to meet [PER Putin  ] 's motorcade and promptly abandoned [PER Putin  ] beside a large outdoor bonfire while the [MISC Libyan  ] leader went to pray . 
On the morning of [PER Putin  ] 's second day in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Libya  ] ordered [PER Putin  ] 's motorcade redirected in the middle of the highway for a last-minute , private breakfast meeting with [MISC Qadhafi.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russians  ] were generally pleased with the performance of [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Protocol  ] before and during the visit . 
After four meetings with [MISC Libyan  ] Chief of [ORG Protocol  ] ( and [PER Qadhafi  ] confidant ) [PER Nuri  ] al-Mismari in the run-up to the visit , [LOC Libya  ] consented -- for the first time ever -- to grant [MISC Russian  ] security and [PER Putin  ] 's advance team access to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's [PER Bab Azziziya  ] compound in [LOC Tripoli  ] before [PER Putin  ] 's arrival . 
Though al-Mismari initially balked at the [MISC Russian  ] side 's refusal to allow [PER Putin  ] to travel in a [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Protocol  ] vehicle , he eventually relented and allowed the [MISC Russians  ] to fly in three presidential limosines for use during the visit . 
When the [MISC Russians  ] informed al-Mismari that [PER Putin  ] would be accompanied at all times by an assistant carrying [LOC Russia  ] 's nuclear launch codes , al-Mismari blew up: " [LOC Libya  ] has made a decision to get rid of its nuclear weapons . 
We will not let you bring your nuclear weapons here ! 
" [MISC Russian  ] diplomats explained to al-Mismari that [PER Putin  ] would be traveling with codes and not/not the nuclear weapons themselves .
