Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request ; see para <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In an August 4 meeting , [ORG MFA Americas Division  ] Director [PER Mohamed Al Matari  ] gave the [ORG DCM  ] a formal invitation from Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] for the Secretary to attend the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] 's 40th anniversary celebration of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's [ORG Al Fateh Revolution  ] , planned for September 1 in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[ORG DCM  ] promised to convey the invitation to the [ORG Department  ] . 
Original Arabic-language invitation was faxed to NEA/MAG on August 4 ; informal embassy translation of the invitation follows in para <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] began a slow rollout of the 40th anniversary invitations around July 29 , calling in individual embassies to receive personalized invitations . 
Several of our [ORG EU  ] colleagues and the [MISC Japanese  ] reported their governments have been invited to participate at the head of state level . 
We have heard that the [MISC Libyans  ] approached the [MISC Italians  ] some time ago to clarify when [ORG Berlusconi  ] would visit [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] reportedly pushed for his attendance at the September 1 date when given the choice of his attending only one event ( August 30 is also the first anniversary of the [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] friendship treaty and the [MISC Libyans  ] would have liked him there for that as well ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG MFA  ] 's [PER Matari  ] told us that he could not confirm at what level [ORG EU  ] members had been invited but that some [MISC African  ] and [MISC Latin American  ] states -- " [LOC Libya  ] 's friends " -- had been invited at the head of state level . 
When asked why the [LOC U.S.  ] was invited at the Ministerial level , [PER Matari  ] responded that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] was certain that [ORG POTUS  ] would not be able to attend. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Comment and Action Request: [PER Qadhafi  ] views the 40th anniversary celebration as the key moment in a year characterized by his and [LOC Libya  ] 's " achievements " in gaining international prominence . 
Rather than opt for what they knew was an almost certain negative response on [ORG POTUS  ] attendance , they chose to invite the Secretary . 
They undoubtedly hope that the Secretary will attend to help them garner the respect and international legitimacy that they crave . 
The [ORG Department  ] 's guidance on how to respond to the invitation is requested. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Informal embassy translation of the invitation follows: TO: H.E. Secretary [PER Hillary Clinton  ] [ORG U.S. State Department  ] Secretary [PER Dear Secretary:  ] On the first of September this year , the [MISC Libyan  ] people are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the [ORG Great Al Fateh Revolution  ] that delivered it from ignorance , poverty and backwardness , placed it on the track of progress and prosperity and enabled it to contribute actively in the efforts to consolidate peace , stability and security in all parts of the world . 
On this occasion celebrated by the [MISC Libyan  ] people and the rest of free people in the world , we have the honor to invite your Excellency to attend the celebrations that will be held in [LOC Tripoli  ] on September 1 , 2009 . 
We are fully confident that your acceptance of this invitation and attending these celebrations in person will be very much appreciated by the [MISC Libyan  ] people , and would allow us the opportunity to discuss ways to develop bilateral relations between our two countries so as to achieve the common interests of our two friendly peoples in [LOC Libya  ] and in the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] . 
Signature: [PER Musa Kusa  ] Secretary of the General People 's Committee for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] .
