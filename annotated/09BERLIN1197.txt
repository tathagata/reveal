[LOC BERLIN  ] 1179 Classified By: AMBASSADOR [PER PHILIP D. MURPHY  ] FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] achieved her goal of a solid parliamentary majority for her [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) with its [MISC Bavarian  ] sister party , the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) , and the pro-business [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , but will have to contend with a self-confident [ORG FDP  ] that is likely to seek major concessions in terms of policy and personnel . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] 's 33.8 percent showing was its lowest since 1949 , while the [ORG FDP  ] 's 14.6 percent was its strongest in the history of the [LOC Federal Republic  ] . 
The [ORG SPD  ] crashed , while the [ORG Left Party  ] and [ORG Greens  ] were able to score their highest results ever , with the [ORG Left Party  ] surpassing the [ORG Greens  ] overall and overtaking the [ORG SPD  ] in the eastern [MISC German  ] states by a wide margin . 
[PER Merkel  ] hopes that coalition negotiations with the [ORG FDP  ] will be " quick and decisive , " while [ORG FDP  ] Chairman [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] -- widely expected to be the next foreign minister -- has emphasized his intention to press for the party 's goals of a fundamental tax reform , more emphasis on education , and stronger protection of civil liberties . 
[PER Merkel  ] and [PER Westerwelle  ] already met privately election night ( September 27 ) and coalition negotiations should begin soon , most likely with the goal of having a formal agreement with the selection of a cabinet by the time the [ORG Bundestag  ] convenes a month from now . 
End Summary . 
OVERALL TREND: MAJOR PARTIES IN DECLINE --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The results show the decline of the major parties -- particularly the [ORG SPD  ] -- and the strengthening of a five-party system . 
Preliminary results give [ORG CDU/CSU  ] 33.8 percent ( versus 35.2 percent in 2005 ) ; the [ORG FDP  ] 14.6 percent ( 9.8 ) ; the [ORG SPD  ] 23.0 ( 34.3 ) ; the [ORG Left Party  ] 11.9 ( 8.7 ) , and the [ORG Greens  ] 10.7 ( 8.1 ) . 
The decline in the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] percentage is due particularly to the [ORG CSU  ] 's losses in [LOC Bavaria  ] , where the party suffered its worst [MISC Bundestag  ] result ever at 42.6 percent , down from 49.2 percent in 2005 , but it still won all 45 of its constituencies . 
These preliminary results give the [ORG CDU  ] 24 " surplus mandates " because of the high number of constituency seats it won despite its low 33.8 percent second vote showing ( see REFTEL G ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The new coalition should end up with control of both the [MISC Bundestag  ] and the [ORG Bundesrat  ] ( [ORG Upper Council  ] ) . 
Based on the preliminary official results , the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] will have 239 seats in the [MISC Bundestag  ] ( up from 226 ) , which along with the 93 [ORG FDP Bundestag  ] seats ( previously 61 ) would give the new government a solid majority . 
The [ORG SPD  ] will have 146 seats in the [MISC Bundestag  ] ( down from 222 ) , the [ORG Left Party  ] 76 ( versus 54 ) and the [ORG Greens  ] 68 ( versus 51 ) . 
The [LOC Schleswig Holstein  ] election on September 27 also appears to have given the [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG FDP  ] a parliamentary majority in that state . 
With [MISC CDU-FDP  ] governments there and in [LOC Saxony  ] , where the two parties won a majority on August 30 , the new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition will soon have a majority in the [ORG Bundesrat  ] and should be able to gain its approval of future coalition legislation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and her [ORG CDU/CSU Union  ] are somewhat disappointed by their party 's results , but are publicly emphasizing that the [ORG CDU/CSU-SPD Grand Coalition  ] has met its demise and will be replaced by a center-right coalition composed of the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] and [ORG FDP  ] . 
" We achieved something fantastic , " said Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , now facing a second four-year term . 
" We achieved a stable majority in [LOC Germany  ] for a new government...We can party tonight , but there is a lot of work waiting for us . 
" An uncharacteristically emotional [PER Merkel  ] -- clearly relieved by her victory -- promised to be the " Chancellor of all [MISC Germans  ] " -- old and young , entrepreneurs and workers -- and said the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] would be sufficiently dominant in the new coalition to prevail " in questions that affect social balance . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Despite her huge personal popularity , however , [PER Merkel  ] led her [ORG CDU/CSU Union  ] to its second poorest result in history , leaving her vulnerable to future backstabbing within [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001197 002 OF 003 her party . 
[PER Merkel  ] -- while happy to be rid of the [ORG Grand Coalition  ] with the [ORG SPD  ] -- now faces the challenging task of entering a coalition with a party that could prove to be more difficult to manage than the [ORG SPD  ] . 
[PER Merkel  ] will start talks with the [ORG FDP  ] within days . 
It could , however , take up to the end of October for the parties to forge the policy compromises and work out the distribution of cabinet posts necessary to seal a coalition deal . 
FDP: THE REAL WINNER -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG FDP  ] will return to government after eleven years in opposition , having achieved its best election results in the party 's history . 
Its leader , [ORG FDP Party  ] Chairman [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] , will most likely become [LOC Germany  ] 's next foreign minister ( see REFTEL E ) . 
At the [ORG FDP  ] election celebration , [PER Westerwelle  ] told his party faithful that " We want to be part of the government . 
But this means responsibility , and we are ready to take on this responsibility . 
" [PER Westerwelle  ] said his party would work to ensure that [LOC Germany  ] gets a " fair tax system and better educational opportunities " and that civil rights would once again be respected . 
The [ORG FDP  ] will be in a very powerful position to demand a larger number of cabinet seats in a new [MISC German  ] government . 
They are likely to expect to get at least the equivalent of what they have had in the past: the foreign office , either justice or perhaps interior ( which they led from 1969-82 ) , economics or possibly finance , and at least one other ministry ( in the past they have had education and economic cooperation ( i.e. development ) . 
However , the [ORG FDP  ] will find it difficult to negotiate a coalition agreement with the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] over the coming weeks , especially in the areas of tax cuts ( see REFTEL F ) and civil rights , including data privacy ( see REFTEL D ) . 
SPD: HARD ROAD AHEAD -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) It would be hard to exaggerate the dimension of the [ORG SPD  ] defeat . 
The party fell more than 11 points to its worst result in the post-war period . 
Its share of the eastern [MISC German  ] vote was 19 percent , behind both the [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG Left Party  ] , and the [ORG FDP  ] came within striking distance of the [ORG SPD  ] in some western [MISC German  ] states , including [LOC Bavaria  ] , where the [ORG SPD  ] 's 17 percent was just ahead of the [ORG FDP  ] 's 15 percent . 
The [ORG SPD  ] election-night party was like a funeral , and [ORG Steinmeier  ] and [ORG SPD  ] party chairman Muentefering appeared grim-faced to announce that [ORG Steinmeier  ] would be the [ORG Bundestag  ] caucus chairman and thus unofficial leader of the opposition to the new black-yellow government . 
Muentefering did not , as many expected , announce his resignation but it is likely to come by the time of the next party conference in mid-November. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Exit polls show that the [ORG SPD  ] lost more than a million votes to former supporters who simply stayed home and additional voters to the [ORG Left Party  ] and [ORG Greens  ] , and that the public still blames it for the changes in unemployment insurance and the retirement age enacted during the [PER Schroeder  ] government and as part of the grand coalition . 
The [ORG SPD  ] , with only four minister-presidents and a shrunken parliamentary caucus , will have to decide how to profile itself against its two fellow leftist opposition parties , and the party left is likely to press for coalitions with the [ORG Left  ] and [ORG Greens  ] at the state level . 
[ORG LEFT OVERTAKES GREENS  ] --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG Left Party  ] -- under [PER Oskar Lafontaine  ] 's and [PER Gregor Gysi  ] 's leadership -- can also claim electoral victory with their party 's best showing ever in a parliamentary election . 
Having won 11.9 per cent of the total vote and 20 direct mandates -- the largest number ever for one of the smaller parties -- it will be difficult for [LOC Germany  ] 's other parties , especially the [ORG SPD  ] , to ignore The [ORG Left  ] 's steady rise in popularity in east and west [LOC Germany  ] ( see REFTEL B ) . 
The party successfully stole the [ORG SPD  ] 's thunder and was partially responsible for the [ORG SPD  ] 's poorest showing ever in [MISC German  ] election history . 
The [ORG Left Party  ] can now concentrate on achieving the ultimate prize in [MISC German  ] politics in 2013: a governing coalition with the [ORG SPD  ] and the [ORG Greens  ] . 
[LOC Berlin  ] [ORG SPD Governing Mayor  ] [PER Klaus Wowereit  ] has already said that this year 's election must be the last one in which the [ORG SPD  ] excludes the possibility of cooperation with the [ORG Left  ] , and he and other left-wingers in the [ORG SPD  ] will likely fight to bring the two parties closer together . 
GREENS: HOW TO STAY RELEVANT ? 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 00001197 003 OF 003 ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG Greens  ] may have celebrated their first double digit showing ( 10.7 per cent ) in a parliamentary election , but the party was unsuccessful in preventing a black-yellow coalition or becoming the third strongest party in the [ORG Bundestag  ] ( see REFTEL A ) . 
Party Co-Chairman [PER Cem Oezdemir  ] -- who failed to win his direct mandate and was too low on the party list to win a seat in the [ORG Bundestag  ] -- said that the [ORG Greens  ] would establish themselves as a " think tank for social issues and for [LOC Germany  ] as a whole . 
" The [ORG SPD  ] 's disastrous electoral result will remind the [ORG Greens  ] that they may need to reach out to the [ORG CDU  ] if they are to remain a relevant political power . 
For the foreseeable future , [PER Oezdemir  ] hinted that his party would concentrate on achieving good results at future state elections and plotting their return to power in <a id='par2013' href='#par2013'>¶</a>2013 . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's main campaign objective -- to attract centrist support by out-positioning the [ORG SPD  ] as the best protector of [LOC Germany  ] 's social welfare state -- was successful , although her [ORG CDU/CSU  ] union suffered losses , primarily because of the [ORG CSU  ] . 
She will now have to find a way to balance this promise with [ORG FDP  ] demands for greater reforms while dealing with the likely struggles between a strengthened [ORG FDP  ] and a [ORG CSU  ] that is concerned about its continued decline . 
The parties will now enter complex coalition negotiations with pressure to complete them by the time that the new [ORG Bundestag  ] convenes in late October , these talks have the potential to be very contentious . 
[PER Merkel  ] will want to stamp her authority on the coalition agreement , while [PER Westerwelle  ] will be a tough bargaining partner for [PER Merkel  ] as he aims to extract the maximum amount of policy and personnel concessions from the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] . 
Finally , as a weakened [ORG SPD  ] moves into the opposition , it can be expected that it will seek to continue the public debate on the major campaign issues and begin to rebuild itself , a process that could include its strong re-positioning to the left. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) What does a CDU/CSU-FDP victory mean for the [LOC United States  ] ? 
On a practical level , [LOC Germany  ] will have a new foreign minister , most likely [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] , who has enjoyed a difficult relationship with the [LOC United States  ] during his time spent in opposition ( see REFTEL D ) . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] will face a steep learning curve at the [ORG MFA  ] , but we should not expect him to play second fiddle to Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] . 
The foreign and security policy rivalry between the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG Chancellery  ] during the [ORG Bush Administration  ] will not disappear . 
Indeed , they may be enhanced with [PER Westerwelle  ] 's attempt to profile and make an international name for himself as quickly as possible , making it difficult for us to identify who is in the lead on any given issue . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and [PER Westerwelle  ] will be competing for attention ; the latter 's flamboyant and outgoing style may give him a leg up but Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] will be keen to assert her primacy in international affairs , especially on economic and [ORG EU  ] matters . 
She has more government and foreign policy experience that will come in handy in this future duel , and in an age of international summitry , the Chancellor rather than the Foreign Minister calls the shots . 
We should not underestimate her desire to carve out a political legacy for herself , especially in the international arena , and her record of strong cooperation with [LOC Washington  ] suggests that her dominance is likely to have a net benefit for [LOC US  ] interests. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 .
