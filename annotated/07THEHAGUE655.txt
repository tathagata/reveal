( C ) Summary: In his introductory meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] , new [MISC Dutch  ] Defense Minister [PER Eimert van Middelkoop  ] stressed the importance of success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He repeated official policy regarding the [MISC Dutch  ] two-year commitment in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province , and anticipated a fierce debate this summer within the coalition and with parliament regarding a possible extension in some capacity past August <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
However , he suggested that completely leaving [LOC Uruzgan  ] " " made little sense " " after investing two years worth of time and resources , and that the [MISC Dutch  ] could possibly team with another [ORG NATO  ] ally in [LOC Uruzgan  ] or continue its partnership with [LOC Australia  ] under different terms . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] added that any perceived [LOC U.S.  ] pressure could backfire in both parliament and the [MISC Dutch  ] public . 
He also expressed views on a possible [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to [LOC Africa  ] , and continued [MISC Dutch  ] participation in the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] discussed these issues with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] on April 10 . 
End summary . 
[ORG Afghanistan: Extension Debate Looming  ] ------------------------------------ 2 , ( C ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] stressed that [ORG NATO  ] " " must succeed " " in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He described his recent visit to [LOC Uruzgan  ] with new Foreign and Development Ministers [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] and [PER Bert Koenders  ] as " " an investment in ourselves , " " allowing the [MISC Dutch  ] to emphasize the comprehensive , " " 3D " " approach balancing defense , development and diplomacy efforts . 
He was quick to add , however , that the comprehensive approach was " " not uniquely a [MISC Dutch  ] one , " " especially as the [LOC United States  ] does some aspects far better than the [LOC Netherlands  ] -- the [ORG USG  ] deserves compliments as well , he said . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] said cooperation in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] was going " " very well , " " but added that the [MISC Dutch  ] need more strategic airlift . 
He said he raised the possibility of helicopter support with [ORG NATO  ] SYG [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] , and questioned whether the [LOC United States  ] might be able to help in that capacity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] turned discussion to the possibility of extending the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in some role beyond its two-year commitment to August 2008 . 
He acknowledged the [ORG GONL  ] will make an extension decision by the end of the summer , and anticipated a fierce debate with parliament . 
Complicating the issue , he said , were differing points of view within the coalition government . 
He said " " officially , " " the [MISC Dutch  ] are committed until 2008 , and that [ORG NATO  ] is responsible for replacing the [MISC Dutch  ] should they decide to leave . 
Personally , he argued that the [LOC Netherlands  ] is a [ORG NATO  ] member and is therefore also responsible for finding an ally to replace it should the [ORG GONL  ] decide to leave . 
Moreover , it did not make sense in his view to invest " " so much time , energy and resources " " in [LOC Uruzgan  ] for two years , and then opt to completely leave [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) If the [MISC Dutch  ] did choose to extend , van [PER Middelkoop  ] acknowledged they would not be able to continue their deployment at its current capacity . 
" " We are at our limits , " " van [PER Middelkoop  ] said , " " if we extend , it will be in a smaller role . 
" " He acknowledged the possibility of teaming with another ally past 2008 , and said the [MISC Dutch  ] were actively pursuing this possibility . 
Another option might be for [LOC Australia  ] to take the lead in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , he added . 
That said , he stressed the importance of avoiding the perception publicly that the [LOC United States  ] and others were pressuring the [MISC Dutch  ] to extend -- this had the potential of backfiring should parliament and the [MISC Dutch  ] public believe the [LOC United States  ] was pushing the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] concurred , and added that the [MISC Dutch  ] press is keen to create the perception of [ORG USG  ] pressure . 
He noted that in a recent interview with visiting Assistant Secretary of State [PER Dan Fried  ] , a [MISC Dutch  ] reporter asked 22 different ways how the [LOC United States  ] was pressuring the [LOC Netherlands  ] to extend despite [PER Fried  ] 's best attempts to assure him otherwise . 
[ORG Africa: Next Stop After Afghanistan  ] ? ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] noted the strong interest by coalition government partner [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) to become more involved in [LOC Africa  ] , and asked whether this might deter the [MISC Dutch  ] from extending in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] acknowledged [ORG Labor  ] 's desires to " " go to [LOC Africa  ] , " " highlighted by Development Minister [PER Koenders'  ] strong interest in the continent . 
However , he stressed that such interest has " " not yet become a real issue . 
" " " " We are currently committed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- that is our concrete responsibility , " " he said . 
He noted that the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Defense  ] was in the very formative stages of reviewing options in [LOC Africa  ] -- none of which should distract from the [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
JSF: The Reason He is Defense Minister -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) , van [PER Middelkoop  ] repeated the government coalition accord language honoring all previous commitments to [ORG JSF  ] contingent upon a third-party , independent review of the business case early next year , while making a procurement decision by 2010 . 
Regarding procurement , he said the [MISC Dutch  ] will look at [ORG JSF  ] and alternatives , i.e. , the [LOC EuroFighter  ] , but added that none of them posed " " any serious threat " " to [ORG JSF  ] . 
He acknowledged that there is some cause for caution , given the fact that the [ORG Labor Party  ] opposed participating in the production , sustainment and follow-on phase of the program . 
However , he pointed to [ORG Labor  ] 's acceptance of the coalition accord as a positive sign . 
" " Quite frankly , " " he said , " " the reason I am Defense Minister today is that the [ORG Labor Party  ] did not want to be in charge of the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] when the [MISC Dutch  ] government finally agreed to buy [ORG JSF  ] . 
" " Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] , from the government coalition minority member [ORG Christian Union  ] party , appeared relaxed and in good spirits regarding his new position -- " " who ever thought that my small [ORG Christian  ] party would ever be in the government -- let alone that I would be Defense Minister , " " he laughed . 
Yet van [PER Middelkoop  ] clearly knew his portfolio and spoke confidently on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Speaking frankly on the transatlantic relationship , he said " " perhaps we have missed some chances on bridging the gap , but look how well we are working together in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" " To date , he has been publicly reticent , preferring to reiterate official policy . 
However , if his private comments on [LOC Afghanistan  ] are any indication , he will play a key role in determining whether the [MISC Dutch  ] will continue their deployment in some capacity past August 2008 .
