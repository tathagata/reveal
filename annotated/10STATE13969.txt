[PER GORDON  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: This is an action request for all Embassies in [ORG EU  ] countries to reiterate our position that the [ORG EU  ] should retain its arms embargo on [LOC China  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials , including the [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister , signaled a possible review of the arms embargo under [LOC Spain  ] 's Presidency of the [ORG EU  ] . 
Although USEU reports that there is no active discussion of this in [LOC Brussels  ] ( reftel ) , we believe it is important to reiterate that the [LOC U.S.  ] remains firmly opposed to any lifting of the embargo . 
END SUMMARY. ---------- BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador to [LOC China  ] [PER Carlos Blasco  ] told [MISC Chinese  ] journalists on January 21 that " we hope to intensify talks on lifting the ( arms ) embargo . 
" Subsequently , when asked about these comments at a January 26 press conference , [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] stated that his government would be " reviewing the decision " on and " weighing the pros and cons " of lifting the arms embargo. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] imposed the arms embargo on [LOC China  ] , alongside a similar [LOC U.S.  ] arms embargo , following the violent suppression of protestors at [LOC Tiananmen Square  ] in 1989 . 
The last major push to lift the [ORG EU  ] arms embargo came in late 2004/early <a id='par2005' href='#par2005'>¶</a>2005 . 
[LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] were strong proponents of lifting the embargo at the time . 
In the end , a combination of our public and private opposition , NGO pressure , and the passage of a [MISC Chinese  ] anti-secession law authorizing the use of force against [LOC Taiwan  ] persuaded [ORG EU  ] governments to maintain the embargo. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/REL [ORG EU  ] MEMBER STATES ) ACTION REQUEST: Posts are asked to approach host government at the appropriate level to reaffirm [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to the lifting of the arms embargo , and solicit host government views on the issues , using the below talking points: -- We are concerned by recent comments suggesting that the [ORG EU  ] may consider lifting its arms embargo on [LOC China  ] . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] position on an arms embargo has not changed since the [MISC Tiananmen  ] crackdown of June 1989 or since the last time the [ORG EU  ] considered lifting the ban in 2004: We continue to believe that lifting the embargo is not warranted , on either human rights or security grounds . 
-- In terms of human rights , the [MISC Chinese  ] Government 's actions over the last few months have ignored international concern over specific human rights cases , including the harsh sentencing of [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] to 11 years in prison and the execution of [MISC British  ] citizen [PER Akmal Shaikh  ] . 
Public comments at this time from senior [MISC European  ] officials suggesting that the [ORG EU  ] may seek to lift the arms embargo undercut these international concerns regarding [LOC Beijing  ] 's human rights practices . 
-- We refer you to the [ORG Department of Defense  ] 's annual [ORG PLA Military Power Report  ] , which highlights the increased capabilities of [MISC Chinese  ] military forces . 
Lifting the arms embargo would have serious implications for the security and stability of the [LOC Pacific  ] region. -- ( If the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Code of Conduct  ] is brought up ) We believe that the [ORG Code of Conduct  ] and 'toolbox' of export controls cannot replace the embargo . 
-- We should continue to discuss the requirements of security and stability in [LOC East Asia  ] in the context of the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] strategic dialogue on [MISC Asia.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Please slug all responses for [MISC EUR/ERA  ] , EAP/CM , PM/RSAT and [ORG ISN/RA  ] . 
[ORG Department  ] thanks Posts for their assistance .
