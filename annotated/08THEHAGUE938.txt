( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Dutch  ] government agrees fully with [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's lack of anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime . 
They are already taking action and want the [LOC U.S.  ] to have confidence in the [LOC Netherlands'  ] commitment and ability to address the terrorism finance threat from [LOC Iran  ] . 
Senior [ORG Finance Ministry  ] officials complained that repetitive high-level demarches offering no new substantive information are not constructive . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Econoff delivered reftel points November 4 to [PER Eric Ligthart  ] , Deputy Director Financial Integrity Division , [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , and two of his colleagues . 
[PER Ligthart  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] government considers itself a close ally of the [LOC U.S.  ] on terrorism finance and worked to obtain a strong [ORG FATF  ] statement on [LOC Iran  ] at the [LOC Rio  ] plenary . 
He said reftel points contained no information that the [MISC Dutch  ] were not already aware of and taking steps to address . 
Moreover , [PER Ligthart  ] was dismayed that the [LOC U.S.  ] government was again raising the issue of [ORG Credit Europe Bank  ] 's correspondent relationship with [MISC Iranian  ] banks . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] government was fully aware of the issue , having heard the message loud and clear in September when Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence [PER Stuart Levey  ] brought it to the attention of the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] 's number three official as well as senior [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] counterterrorism officials . 
[PER Ligthart  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] government had taken action to resolve the issue and discussed these actions in detail when [MISC Dutch  ] Embassy representatives met October 23 with Undersecretary [PER Levey  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Ligthart  ] asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] have confidence in the [LOC Netherlands'  ] commitment and ability to implement [ORG FATF  ] 's guidance and [ORG UN Security Council Resolutions  ] as they relate to the terrorism finance threat from [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ligthart  ] expressed concern that the concerted efforts by the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Netherlands  ] and many others to prevent funding of [LOC Iran  ] 's illicit activities were undermined by lax enforcement in certain [LOC Middle East  ] financial centers . 
He said one need only look at those banks active in [LOC Dubai  ] to gain an idea of which countries are involved in diverting funds to [LOC Iran  ] .
