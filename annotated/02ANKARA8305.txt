( [ORG U  ] ) THE PRIME , RADICAL ISLAMIST TERROR GROUP OF [LOC TURKEY  ] IS THE [ORG TURKISH HIZBULLAH  ] . 
ALTHOUGH KNOWN TO FIGHT RIVALS , NAMELY THE PKK AND OTHER RIVAL ISLAMIC GROUPS , IN FAVOR OF CONFRONTATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES , [ORG TURKISH HIZBULLAH  ] HAS NOT CARRIED OUT ANY MAJOR OPERATIONS IN 2002 . 
IT STAGED A SPECTACULAR JANUARY 2001 AMBUSH IN DIYARBAKIR THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF DIYARBAKIR SECURITY DIRECTOR GAFFAR OKKAN AND FIVE OF HIS BODYGUARDS .

SEPARATIST <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG KADEK  ] , [ORG FORMERLY KNOWN AS  ] THE [ORG PKK  ] , REPRESENTS [ORG THE LARGEST  ] SEPARATIST ORGANIZATION GROUP IN [LOC TURKEY  ] , THOUGH ITS CAPABILITY TO OPERATE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY REDUCED DUE TO VIGOROUS AND ON-GOING COUNTER-INSURGENCY EFFORTS OF THE TURKISH ARMED FORCES , JANDARMA , TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE ( [ORG TNP  ] ) , AND [PER VILLAGE GUARDS  ] ( A PARAMILITARY GUARD FORCE RECRUITED FROM LOCAL VILLAGERS ) . 
THIS EFFORT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE ARREST AND CONVICTION OF PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN IN 1999 . 
[ORG THE EUROPEAN UNION  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) [ORG DESIGNATED  ] THE PKK A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN MAY 2002. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) IN APRIL 2002 [ORG THE GROUP  ] UNDERWENT A RE-ORGANIZATION AND NAME CHANGE . 
RENAMED THE KURDISTAN FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY CONGRESS ( [ORG KADEK  ] ) , [ORG THE ORGANIZATION  ] HAS EXPANDED ITS OPERATIONS BY FOCUSING UPON MORE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES .

SMALL CELLS AND SYMPATHIZERS REMAIN THROUGHOUT [LOC TURKEY  ] , BUT THESE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED TO THE POINT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS , RATHER THAN THE MILITARY , OVERSEE MOST OPERATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS .

THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) IN [ORG THE PAST  ] , [LOC TURKEY  ] HAS FACED DIFFICULTY IN EXTRADITING TERROR-RELATED SUSPECTS FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES . 
ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS , [LOC TURKEY  ] HAS REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF 245 HIGH LEVEL ADMINISTRATORS FOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS SINCE 1991 . 
SYMPATHY WITH KURDISH POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ASPIRATIONS IN SOME EUROPEAN STATES , ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE BY TURKISH OFFICIALS , AND TURKEY’S LEGAL PROVISION FOR [ORG THE DEATH  ] PENALTY HAVE ALL PROVED IMPEDIMENTS TO SUCH EXTRADITIONS . 
HOWEVER , IN AUGUST 2002 , AS A PART OF [ORG THE EUROPEAN UNION REFORM PACKAGE  ] , [ORG THE TURKISH  ] PARLIAMENT PASSED A LAW BANNING THE USE OF [ORG THE DEATH  ] PENALTY. ------------------------------------ RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION ( E ) ------------------------------------ <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC TURKS  ] SEE THEMSELVES TO BE AMONG [ORG THE WORLD’S PRIMARY VICTIMS  ] OF TERRORISM . 
THEY CITE THE 15-YEAR INSURGENCY OF [ORG THE KURDISTAN WORKERS’ PARTY  ] ( PKK ) , AND [ORG THE WORLDWIDE ASSASSINATION CAMPAIGN  ] AGAINST [ORG THE TURKISH DIPLOMATS  ] AND THEIR FAMILIES BY ARMENIAN ACTIVISTS OF THE 1970S AND 1980S . 
THEY HAVE LONG COMPLAINED ABOUT LIBERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES’ HARBORING KURDISH ( PKK ) , LEFTIST ( [ORG DHKP-C  ] ) AND ISLAMIST ( [ORG HIZBOLLAH  ] , [ORG KAPLANISTS  ] ) “TERRORISTS.” THEY FEEL OTHER NATIONS DO NOT APPRECIATE TURKEY’S SUFFERING AT THE HANDS OF THESE PARTIES . 
THUS , [ORG THE TURKISH  ] GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA WERE QUICK TO RESPOND TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 . 
AT ALL LEVELS , THERE WAS AN OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY AND SOLIDARITY . 
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSTANT REMINDER THAT NOW OTHERS WERE BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE WHAT TURKS HAD LIVED WITH FOR YEARS . 
TURKEY’S PRE-9/11 HISTORIC COOPERATION WITH THE US IN LAW ENFORCEMENT , MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES HAS ONLY INCREASED IN THE LAST YEAR WITH PUBLIC COMMITMENTS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM FROM THE PRESIDENT , [ORG THE PRIME  ] MINISTER AND THE MILITARY . 
THERE HAS BEEN VERY VISIBLE SUPPORT FOR THE SECURITY OF AMERICANS AT OUR MISSION’S BUILDINGS BY LOCAL POLICE . 
AS [ORG THE STORM  ] BROKE ON THE NOVEMBER 17 ARRESTS IN [LOC GREECE  ] , THERE WAS INTENSE COVERAGE WITH A NEW “I TOLD YOU SO” IMPLICATION IN THE GOVERNMENT PRINT MEDIA. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG THE TURKISH  ] STAND ON TERRORISM HAS BEEN “SOFTER” IN THE CASE OF THE CHECHENS . 
CHECHENS ARE , OF COURSE , MUSLIMS AND THERE ARE CULTURAL TIES BETWEEN TURKS AND CHECHENS AND LONG TIME RIVALRY WITH [LOC RUSSIA  ] . 
[ORG THE ARMED  ] , BUT NOT VIOLENT , TAKEOVERS OF A FERRYBOAT IN 1996 AND A HOTEL IN 2001 IN [LOC ISTANBUL  ] WERE TREATED MORE LIKE PROTESTS THAN LIKE TERRORIST ATTACKS BY THE MEDIA . 
THAT CHANGED WITH THE OCTOBER 23 , 2002 CAPTURE OF A THEATER IN MOSCOW WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED DEAD . 
[LOC TURKEY  ] DID CONDEMN THE HOSTAGE-TAKING , BUT WITH THE MEDIA STILL ADDRESSING THE SUFFERING OF THE CHECHEN PEOPLE. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC TURKEY  ] HAS A FREE PRESS . 
IN THE LEFTIST AND ISLAMIC FRINGE PRESS , CHECHEN REBELS , [MISC PALESTINIAN  ] SUICIDE BOMBERS AND EVEN [ORG AL QAIDA  ] MEMBERS CAN BE PORTRAYED AS “FREEDOM FIGHTERS.” TERRORISM HAS LONG BEEN AN INTEREST OF ACADEMICS AND WRITERS IN [LOC TURKEY  ] . 
IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CONFERENCES ON THE TOPIC . 
THOSE ORGANIZED BY INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE HAVE BEEN SEEN AS TOOLS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM . 
PRIVATELY-FUNDED ACADEMIC PROGRAMS HAVE BECOME MORE FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF TERRORISM AND THE ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM. --------------------------------------------- MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS BY THE GOT ( F ) --------------------------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) THE GOVERNMENT OF [LOC TURKEY  ] CONTINUED ITS AGGRESSIVE COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 2002 . 
FOR EXAMPLE , IN A JOINT OPERATION , THE TURKISH CUSTOMS GUARD AND THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY ( [ORG MIT  ] ) SEIZED NINE KALASHINIKOV RIFLES AND ONE SCORPION ASSASSINATION PISTOL WITH SILENCER FROM A CAR AT THE KAPIKULE BORDER GATE IN SEPTEMBER 2002 . 
THESE WEAPONS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO BE DELIVERED TO THE DHKP/C TO BE USED IN SUPPOSED OPERATIONS TO CREATE DISTURBANCES PRIOR TO THE TURKISH GENERAL ELECTIONS HELD IN NOVEMBER 2002. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) ADDITIONALLY , THE GOT APPREHENDED THREE SUSPECTED [ORG AL QAIDA  ] OPERATIVES NEAR THE IRANIAN BORDER ( NEAR VAN ) . 
THE GOT FOLLOWED UP BY ARRESTING DOCUMENT FORGERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE , NEAR BURSA IN NORTHWESTERN [LOC TURKEY.  ] <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) THE GOT CONTINUES ITS ACTIVE SUPPRESSION OF THE PKK/KADEK , THOUGH ITS SECURITY OPERATIONS TEMPO HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN LINE WITH A REDUCTION IN THE CONFLICT . 
IT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE ORGANIZATION’S POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO STEM ANY POTENTIAL DISTURBANCES. ------------------------------------ GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM ( G ) ------------------------------------ <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) THE GOT CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY OPPOSES BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM . 
[LOC TURKEY  ] DOES NOT VIEW ITS MAINTENANCE OF DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH [LOC CUBA  ] , [LOC IRAN  ] , [LOC IRAQ  ] , [LOC LIBYA  ] , [LOC SUDAN  ] , AND [LOC SYRIA  ] AS CONSTITUTING SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. --------------------------------------------- - SUPPORT STATEMENTS FOR TERRORIST COUNTRIES ( H ) --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG TURKEY SHARES BORDERS WITH  ] , AND HAS BEEN AN HISTORIC TRADING PARTNER OF [LOC SYRIA  ] , [LOC IRAN  ] AND [LOC IRAQ  ] . 
IT BALANCES A CONDEMNATION OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES ( INCLUDING PROVIDING HAVENS FOR THE PKK ) WITH THE NEED TO ACCESS HISTORIC TRADE ROUTES . 
THUS [LOC TURKEY  ] WILL PROVIDE BASES FOR OPERATION NORTHERN WATCH WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SENDING LARGE TRADE DELEGATIONS TO BAGHDAD AND [LOC TEHRAN  ] . 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS AGAINST STATE-SUPPORTED TERRORISM ARE CLEAR. --------------------------------------------- --------- SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM ( I ) --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) SINCE THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11 , THE GOT HAS TAKEN AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE WORLDWIDE OPPOSITION AGAINST TERRORISM . 
IN MAY 2002 [ORG THE EUROPEAN UNION PLACED  ] THE PKK AND DHKP/C ON ITS LIST OF TERRORIST GROUPS AFTER AN INTENSIVE PUSH BY THE GOT FOR THE EU TO ADOPT TOUGHER MEASURES AGAINST TURKISH TERROR GROUPS OPERATING IN EUROPE . 
IT CONTINUES TO PRESS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO RECOGNIZE KADEK AS THE SUCCESSOR OF THE PKK AND THUS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. --------------------------------------------- ------------ USG COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH GOT ( J ) --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 .
