( [LOC C  ] ) The public profile of [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] , presidential son and rising star in the ruling party , has increased in recent months . 
His appearance in late March on an evening talk show and a highly publicized visit to a [LOC Cairo  ] slum have fueled speculation that an effort to succeed his father is moving full speed ahead . 
The possibility that [PER Gamal  ] might succeed his father remains deeply unpopular on the street - a sentiment often echoed by commentators in the independent and opposition press . 
[PER Gamal  ] has denied that he harbors presidential ambitions , but many believe his actions speak louder than his words . 
The intra-family politics of a [PER Gamal  ] succession bid are unclear . 
Conventional wisdom holds that [PER Suzanne Mubarak  ] is her younger son 's most ardent booster . 
[PER Gamal  ] 's chances are improved by the fact that there are no other obvious contenders for the presidency waiting in the wings . 
End summary. ------------- Burning Issue ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The issue of presidential succession is the hottest single issue on [LOC Egypt  ] 's domestic political scene . 
Unlike his predecessors , President [PER Mubarak  ] has never named a Vice President . 
[PER Mubarak  ] , who began his fifth six year term in September 2005 , will turn 78 in May . 
Though he is vigorous and healthy , there is general recognition that the actuarial tables will catch up with [PER Mubarak  ] sooner or later . 
Speculation that [PER Mubarak  ] was grooming his son [PER Gamal  ] to succeed him increased markedly in 2002 , when the younger [PER Mubarak  ] assumed a prominent leadership post in the ruling [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) , just two years after Bashar al-Asad succeeded his father in [LOC Syria.  ] ------------- Stage Setting ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Both [PER Gamal  ] and his father have repeatedly denied that there is any plan for a " succession scenario . 
" More important than such words , many [MISC Egyptians  ] tell us , are the actions of [PER Gamal  ] , his father , and others , which appear to be setting the stage for the young [PER Mubarak  ] 's rise to power . 
In the summer of 2004 and again at the end of 2005 , the President shuffled his cabinet , replacing " old guard " figures with younger , ambitious technocrats , most with direct or indirect links to [PER Gamal  ] . 
In early 2006 , a shake-up in the ruling [ORG NDP  ] promoted [PER Gamal  ] to the post of Assistant Secretary-General ( co-equal with [PER Zakaria Azmy  ] , the SIPDIS President 's de-facto Chief of Staff , and old-guard cabinet veteran [PER Mufeed Shehab  ] ) . 
The party shuffle also brought a number of other [PER Gamal  ] allies into key party leadership positions , replacing a number of old-guard rival kingmakers , including the notorious machine politician [PER Kamal al-Shazly.  ] ------------- Settling Down ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gamal  ] 's February engagement to the 24 year old socialite [PER Khadiga  ] el-Gammal is widely viewed as another step on the path to the presidency . 
In a society where men typically marry before their 30th birthday , [PER Gamal  ] 's bachelorhood has extended into his 40 's . 
Thus [PER Gamal  ] 's engagement , cynics tell us , was engineered to broaden his appeal. --------------------------- " Not for Any Other Purpose " --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On March 28 , [PER Gamal  ] paid a visit , camera crews in tow , to the slums of [LOC Agouza  ] al-Qadima in [LOC Giza  ] , just west of [LOC Central Cairo  ] . 
[PER Gamal  ] was there , with Housing Minister ( and ally ) [PER Ahmed al-Maghraby  ] , to cut the ribbon on new low income housing units prepared by his [ORG Future Generation Foundation  ] , a development group he founded in 1999 , aimed at addressing the needs of poor youth . 
Most political observers regard the foundation as a vehicle primarly intended for [PER Gamal  ] 's public entree onto the political stage . 
" We came to help and serve only - not for any other purpose , " [PER Gamal  ] told accompanying journalists in [LOC Agouza.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Later that evening , [PER Gamal  ] made a rare appearance on a talk show on [ORG State Channel  ] 1 , promoted all day in advance of the broadcast and re-aired on March 29 . 
[PER Gamal  ] focused his remarks on his work to rejuvenate the [ORG NDP  ] and promote reform and " new thinking . 
" He denied that he was out of touch with the public , asserting that " one enjoys...going down into the street and listening to the people . 
" He also asserted that he regularly visits the provinces , but usually keeps a low profile lest people ascribe ulterior motives . 
We have noticed an uptick of recent [PER Gamal  ] forays outside of [LOC Cairo  ] . 
He stood in for his father , grounded in [LOC Cairo  ] by a dust storm , at the ribbon cutting for an international air show in [LOC Sharm el Sheikh  ] . 
Given all the attention , he could have easily been mistaken as the head of state himself. -------------- Stone Throwers -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On his alleged presidential ambitions , [PER Gamal  ] told [MISC Egyptian  ] talk show viewers on March 28 that he had " made clear as daylight " that he did not intend to seek the presidency and was instead focused on his current efforts to promote reform and serve society . 
These denials have been generally disregarded . 
" He is repackaging himself - if he is not interested , why is he going to all this trouble ? 
" prominent liberal dissident [PER Saad Eddin Ibrahim  ] recently mused to a western journalist . 
Former [PER Nasser  ] advisor and influential writer [PER Mohamed Hassanein Heikal  ] has made opposition to [PER Gamal  ] 's succession a staple of his regular newspaper columns in the independent press . 
The notion that [PER Gamal  ] might succeed his father , [PER Heikal  ] has written , is an affront to [LOC Egypt  ] 's republican principles. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Abdel Halim Qandil  ] , editor of the Nasserist weekly Al-Araby ( and a co-founder of the [LOC Kifaya  ] protest movement ) , was a pioneer of the anti-Gamal movement , authoring in 2003 a series of scathing editorials against the alleged plot to install [PER Gamal  ] and underlining the public 's " universal rejection " of the notion . 
These editorials , many believe , were linked to [PER Qandil  ] 's brief 2004 abduction and beating by still unidentified thugs , who left him bruised and naked on the [LOC Suez  ] desert highway. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Very publicly resigning from the [ORG NDP  ] in early March , leading liberal thinker [PER Osama  ] el-Ghazaly [PER Harb  ] told us of his disillusionment with the party 's reform process , which he came to believe was merely a vehicle for [PER Gamal  ] to promote his political career . 
Imprisoned opposition politician [PER Ayman Nour  ] and his supporters have repeatedly insisted to us that it was his threat to [PER Gamal  ] that led to his political destruction . 
Like [PER Gamal  ] , [PER Nour  ] is 42 years old. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) An article that appeared March 23 in the maverick independent paper Al-Dustour attacked [PER Gamal  ] from a new angle . 
With dubious sourcing , the paper alleged that the [MISC Egyptian  ] brokerage and financial analysis firm [ORG EFG-Hermes  ] had manipulated the early March drop of the [ORG Cairo-Alexandria Stock Exchange  ] to the advantage of its partners and clients and at the expense of small investors , adding that [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] is on the firm 's board . 
The article clearly got [PER Gamal  ] 's attention: He acknowledged in his talk show appearance that he sat on EFG 's board , but insisted that his work focused on subsidiary companies not traded on the stock market. ------------- An [ORG Open Field  ] ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Despite the sniping of many [MISC Egyptian  ] opinion-leaders , and a more general public hostility ( echoed by many of our contacts ) to [PER Gamal  ] 's possible presidential succession , there are few other obvious contenders for the post . 
The post of Vice President has remained vacant , despite earlier speculation that [PER Mubarak  ] might fill it after the 2005 elections were behind him . 
Of the 10 candidates who contested [PER Mubarak  ] 's presidency last fall , [PER Ayman Nour  ] , who placed second , lost his parliamentary seat under very controversial circumstances and was subsequently convicted of forgery and sentenced to a seven year jail term . 
The third-place finisher , [ORG Wafd Party  ] candidate No 'm an [PER Gomaa  ] , was arrested for attempted murder and other charges on April 1 ( septel ) . 
The other eight candidates , marginal figures to begin with , have faded back into nearly total obscurity. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) There are currently almost no other [MISC Egyptian  ] personalities with the national stature and political capital needed to seriously contend for the presidency . 
One exception could be Intelligence Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] , who wields enormous influence over national security policy and is known to have the full confidence of [PER Mubarak  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] is often cited as a potential appointee to the long-vacant Vice Presidential post and his profile has grown with his well-publicized mediation visits to [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Another possible exception could be [ORG Arab League  ] Secretary-General [PER Amr Moussa  ] , who has a high public profile SIPDIS and generally receives favorable coverage across the spectrum of [MISC Egyptian  ] media outlets . 
Consequently , he enjoys considerable street crediblity as a champion of [ORG Arab  ] causes . 
However , [PER Moussa  ] has never expressed or even hinted at any presidential ambitions and has no [MISC Egyptian  ] institutional platform from which to spring . 
[PER Moussa  ] 's assumption of another five year term as [ORG Arab League  ] SYG could be alternately interpreted as keeping him " otherwise occupied " or " still in the game , " with respect to future political positions , but he has never offered any hint that he intends to wade into [LOC Egypt  ] 's domestic political scene. ----------------- All in the Family ----------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The intra-family politics of a [PER Gamal  ] succession bid are unclear . 
Elder son [PER Alaa'  ] , well-known to have extensive business interests ( many of which are privately criticized as corrupt and exploitative ) keeps a low public profile and has never shown any inclination to wade into the political arena . 
( A rare sighting of [PER Alaa'  ] on national TV took place during the final game of the [MISC Africa Cup  ] championship in late February , when he was photographed in the stadium 's VIP section with [PER Gamal  ] , cheering on [LOC Egypt  ] to its 2-1 victory over [LOC Ivory Coast  ] . 
) <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The President has been careful not to indicate any overt support for [PER Gamal  ] , is rarely photographed with him , and has on several occasions angrily denied to the media that there is any plan for his younger son to succeed him . 
While some have speculated that the President is ambivalent about [PER Gamal  ] 's political future , he has not stood in the way of the rise of his son and his allies through the ranks of the ruling [ORG NDP  ] , or obstructed his increased public profile . 
Moreover , the President has twice in the past two years shuffled his cabinet and replaced " old guard " elements with younger technocrats linked to [PER Gamal  ] . 
While there is little public evidence , commonly accepted wisdom in [LOC Cairo  ] is that [ORG First Lady  ] [PER Suzanne Mubarak  ] is [PER Gamal  ] 's most ardent political patron . 
Unlike the President , the [ORG First Lady  ] is often photographed at public events with [PER Gamal  ] , frequently in connection with social issues . 
Her power and influence , many argue , are keys to [PER Gamal  ] 's viability . 
Sources tell us that she has kept [PER Mubarak  ] pere from naming a Vice President. --------------------- [ORG Legal Framework Wired  ] --------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The legal/electoral stage , rearranged in 2005 with the amendment of [ORG Article  ] 76 of the constitution , currently guarantees that the ruling [ORG NDP  ] , increasingly dominated by [PER Gamal  ] and his allies , will retain their lock on the presidency . 
Of all 20 of [LOC Egypt  ] 's legally recognized parties , only the [ORG NDP  ] currently meets the conditions as defined in the amendment to field a presidential candidate . 
( The rules set forth in the amendment state that only parties holding five percent or more of the seats in each of the [ORG People 's Assembly  ] and the [ORG Shura Council  ] . 
The bar is set higher for independents , who must obtain endorsements from 65 [LOC PA  ] members , 25 [ORG Shura Council  ] members , and 10 local council members from each of at least 14 of the 26 provinces . 
) While voters will have opportunities to change the current makeup of the [ORG Shura Council  ] in 2007 and 2009 , and the [ORG People 's Assembly  ] in 2010 , should a presidential transition become necessary sooner , there would be no legal or procedural hurdles for any [ORG NDP  ] candidate to the presidency. --------------------------- A Military Stumbling Block ? --------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) A key stumbling block for any effort to bring [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] to the presidency could be the military . 
Each of [LOC Egypt  ] 's three presidents since the republic was established in 1952 were drawn from the military 's officer corps , and the military has historically been the ultimate guarantor of the president 's rule . 
[PER Gamal Mubarak  ] did not serve as a military officer ( and it is not clear whether he ever completed , even " on paper , " his national military service ) and unlike his father , can not take the military 's support for granted . 
This factor is often cited by our contacts , who believe that [PER Soliman  ] , the intelligence chief with a military background , would have to figure in any succession scenario for [PER Gamal  ] , if only as a transitional figure . 
Another theory is that some other military officer could emerge from obscurity as a presidential contender . 
( Defense Minister [PER Tantawi  ] is acknowledged to be frail and without any political ambition . 
) ------- Comment ------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] 's rise in the ruling [ORG NDP  ] , his attempts to position himself as a " friend of the people , " and as the national champion of reform and " new thinking , " are all compelling evidence that his political ambitions are real - denials notwithstanding . 
Despite palpable public hostility to his succession , and potential stumbling blocks , the way forward for [PER Gamal  ] currently appears open . 
[PER Gamal  ] and his ambitious allies , such as [ORG MP  ] and [ORG NDP  ] figure [PER Ahmed Ezz  ] and economic reform ministers such as [PER Rachid Rachid  ] and [PER Youssef Boutrous Ghali  ] , are apparently banking that structural improvements to the economy will deliver tangible benefits to the masses , and build a support base that extends beyond affluent business circles .
