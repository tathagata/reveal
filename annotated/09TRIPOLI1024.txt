REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG Swiss Charge in Tripoli  ] , [PER Stefano Lazarrotto  ] , expressed cautious optimism that the bilateral crisis with [LOC Libya  ] had seen measured improvements . 
On December 15 , the [ORG GOL  ] issued a visa to a [MISC Swiss  ] diplomat assigned to work in [LOC Tripoli  ] , and in exchange , [LOC Switzerland  ] issued a visa to a [MISC Libyan  ] diplomat assigned to work in [LOC Bern  ] , as part of a " deal " struck between the Charge and [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Lazarrotto  ] told us that [LOC Switzerland  ] was now pursuing a dual-track approach in an attempt to resolve the crisis , a bilateral [ORG MFA  ] dialogue based in [LOC Bern  ] and a new [MISC Tripoli-based  ] dialogue with the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] Government insists that a third party ( [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC France  ] , or [LOC Spain  ] ) mediate discussions in both tracks . 
Although [PER Lazarrotto  ] no longer expressed an immediate fear that he would be declared persona non grata , he maintained his December 1 request that the [ORG Embassy  ] support the detained [MISC Swiss  ] in the event that [MISC Swiss  ] officials are asked to leave the country . 
End summary . 
POSITIVE SIGN BUT REQUEST FOR SUPPORT STANDS 2 . 
( C ) [ORG Swiss Charge  ] [PER Stefano Lazarrotto  ] said that the [ORG GOL  ] had granted a visa to a [MISC Swiss  ] diplomat who will be assigned to [LOC Libya  ] to serve as " Head of [LOC Chancery  ] " ( the equivalent of a Management Officer ) . 
The diplomat arrived on December 19 . 
Simultaneously , the [ORG Swiss Government  ] issued a visa to a [MISC Libyan  ] diplomat assigned to work at the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Bern  ] . 
[PER Lazarrotto  ] said the " deal " was struck after three weeks of negotiation on the issue . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Due to this positive development , [PER Lazarrotto  ] said the [MISC Swiss  ] were less concerned than they were a few weeks ago about the possibility that the Charge would be asked to leave the country for allowing the detained [MISC Swiss  ] citizens , now sentenced in a [MISC Libyan  ] court , to continue to reside at the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Embassy  ] ( reftel ) . 
However , [PER Lazarrotto  ] noted that the request still stands for possible [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in providing food to the detained [MISC Swiss  ] in the event that the [MISC Swiss  ] diplomats are declared persona non grata . 
[PER Lazarrotto  ] also said the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Embassy  ] had stockpiled food and water for the detainees , which somewhat lessened the need for humanitarian assistance in the event of further political difficulties . 
He said that he had made the request for humanitarian assistance to several embassies but that none had responded yet . 
Separately , the [ORG UK Embassy  ] told us on December 16 that they had received the [MISC Swiss  ] request but had not responded , and indicated that the [ORG UK Government  ] was unlikely to respond positively . 
[MISC SWISS  ] PURSUE DUAL TRACK STRATEGY 4 . 
( C ) [PER Lazarrotto  ] confirmed that an appeals trial was still scheduled to take place on December 22 in the immigration court . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] lawyer working on the case is trying to clarify whether the two men have to be present for the trial to take place . 
Separately , the hearings before the " economic court , " which handles tax issues and other matters , have been pushed back to January 2 , 2010 for [PER Max Goeldi  ] and to January 3 , 2010 for [PER Rashid Hamdani  ] . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] do not plan to attend . 
The lawyer is still trying to obtain in writing the list of specific charges . 
5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Swiss  ] are now proceeding along two tracks to negotiate a solution to the situation . 
The first track , being led by the [MISC Swiss  ] Government in [LOC Bern  ] , consists of bilateral [ORG MFA  ] talks to reopen discussions on political reconciliation . 
[PER Lazarrotto  ] reported that a [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] representative ( the name of whom he could not remember ) traveled to [LOC Bern  ] last week for informal discussions of how to move forward . 
[LOC Libya  ] is now insisting that any formal discussions include a third country " mediator . 
" [LOC Bern  ] agreed to allow [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC France  ] , or [LOC Spain  ] to serve as the third party , as those countries had previously agreed to facilitate negotiations on behalf of the [MISC Swiss  ] . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Swiss  ] have initiated a second track recently , through [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) . 
[PER Lazarrotto  ] explained that the [MISC Libyan  ] lawyer representing the detained businessmen had approached the [ORG QDF  ] to intervene with the [ORG GOL  ] on the issue , and that the [ORG QDF  ] had also insisted that a third party be involved in the discussions ( namely , one of the countries mentioned above ) . 
According to [PER Lazarrotto  ] , [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] met with the [MISC Swiss  ] during the group 's recent visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] and noted that in previous discussions they had had with [PER Saif  ] al-Islam in [LOC London  ] , [PER Saif  ] had articulated his interested in " solving " the [MISC Swiss  ] issue soon . 
[LOC SWITZERLAND  ] CONTINUES TO APPLY VETO POWER [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001024 002.2 OF 002 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lazarrotto  ] said that he had faced pressure recently from " a few [ORG EU  ] embassies , " regarding [LOC Switzerland  ] 's decision to veto the issuance of [LOC Schengen  ] visas to [MISC Qadhafi  ] family members . 
He specified that the [MISC Portuguese  ] Ambassador ( strictly protect ) had been particularly vocal in accusing [LOC Switzerland  ] of abusing its veto power . 
[PER Lazarrotto  ] defended his nation 's stance , stating " Imagine that this situation were to happen to another [MISC Qadhafi  ] family member ? 
[LOC Switzerland  ] could not afford that . 
It is better that we take precautions . 
" [PER Lazarrotto  ] stressed that the veto policy was only being applied to [MISC Libyan  ] officials and [MISC Qadhafi  ] family members -- " average [MISC Libyan  ] citizens are still able to apply for [MISC Swiss  ] visas in [LOC Cairo  ] , " he said . 
8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Lazarrotto  ] 's previous fears regarding his status seem to have been greatly allayed by the [ORG GOL  ] 's issuance of a visa for a [MISC Swiss  ] diplomat assigned to work at the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
The introduction of [ORG EU  ] mediating parties and a new negotiating track under the auspices of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] strike us as positive developments though the [MISC Swiss  ] remain angered and frustrated by the [MISC Libyan  ] refusal to state what they truly want to settle the dispute once and for all .
