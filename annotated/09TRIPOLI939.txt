REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Traffic accidents are the third-leading cause of death in [LOC Libya  ] , according to the [ORG World Health Organization  ] . 
Heavily subsided fuel , readily available cars , poor road conditions , easily obtained licenses , and drug and alcohol abuse contribute to the problem . 
Some attribute [MISC Libyans'  ] atrocious driving habits to the stifling political climate , with limited personal freedoms leading many to drive with little regard for others . 
While recent traffic flows in [LOC Tripoli  ] appear to be worse than ever , according [PER Taher Mahmoudi  ] , the head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Traffic Department  ] , traffic fatalities are leveling off and starting to decrease due to a multi-pronged strategy by the [MISC Libyan  ] government that involves capacity-building and training of police , educational outreach to students , and infrastructure upgrades . 
According to [PER Mahmoudi  ] , the way forward requires a coordinated effort among police , infrastructure , justice , and education authorities . 
Private companies , particularly foreign companies , working in [LOC Libya  ] have begun to collaborate with the [MISC Libyan  ] government and with [MISC Libyans  ] who have been personally affected by road tragedies , to encourage local drivers to abide by traffic and public safety laws and to reform their driving habits . 
[LOC U.S.  ] efforts to support this initiative could also have a positive impact on civic activism . 
End summary . 
NO ONE IS UNTOUCHED BY UNSAFE ROADS IN [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The combination of unsafe driving habits , poor roads , and relatively high car ownership make [LOC Libya  ] 's roads among the most hazardous in the world . 
Subsidized petrol costs about 65 cents per gallon , and the government imports thousands of cars every year , which it provides to regime loyalists and civil servants as job ( and loyalty ) perks , resulting in heavy traffic conditions . 
According to the [ORG World Health Organization  ] ( [ORG WHO  ] ) , road traffic injuries are the third-leading cause of death in [LOC Libya  ] , following cardiovascular diseases and cancer . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The diplomatic community has experienced several tragedies on the road since foreign embassies and businesses began returning to [LOC Libya  ] a few years ago . 
In 2008 , the [MISC Malaysian  ] Charge d'Affaires was killed in an accident on the airport highway . 
In the past year , Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] has lost three [MISC Libyan  ] colleagues to traffic accidents: two Embassy guards were killed a year ago while one of them was behind the wheel , en route to his own wedding . 
Another guard died while driving home after his shift at the Embassy ; he was hit head-on by a truck . 
In 2008 , a [LOC U.S.  ] diplomat was medically evacuated due to a road accident in which her car was destroyed . 
The anecdotes do not stop there -- the fiancee of one local employee was hit head-on while driving her car four years ago . 
She has had to travel to [LOC France  ] to have several plastic surgery operations to repair her face , which was unrecognizable after the accident , costing her family thousands of dollars in medical bills . 
As a result , her wedding has been postponed indefinitely . 
Several other staff members and their families and friends have been injured in traffic accidents . 
" SEAT-BELTS ARE TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE " 4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Drivers , traffic officials , expatriates and others cite a lack of driver education , loose enforcement of traffic rules , easy access to drivers' licenses , and poor driving conditions as factors contributing to the dangerous [MISC Libyan  ] road conditions . 
A study by a [MISC German  ] consulting firm reportedly concluded the problem with traffic in [LOC Libya  ] was not due to the roads , but the result of the unsafe habits of most drivers . 
Even our own Embassy drivers adopt different habits when driving for official versus personal purposes . 
One Embassy driver , when asked whether he wore a seatbelt while driving his own car said no , since it was " uncomfortable " and hurt his football-related injuries ( around the abdomen ) . 
He said it was fine to not wear a seatbelt when driving inside the city of [LOC Tripoli  ] since heavy urban traffic forced driving speeds to be relatively low . 
[ Note: In May 2009 , [LOC Libya  ] enacted a seatbelt law mandating use of seatbelts , yet only about one in ten drivers can be seen wearing seatbelts . 
End note . 
] Related hazards included the almost total lack of use of car-seats for infants and the requirement that children only sit in the backseats of cars ( with seatbelts on ) . 
Many parents can be seen holding babies on their laps while driving , while small children routinely romp between the front and back seats as their guardians drive at high speeds . 
[ORG TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR REPORTS SOME PROGRESS  ] 5 . 
( C ) While recent traffic flows in [LOC Tripoli  ] appear to be worse than ever , according to the head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Traffic Department TRIPOLI  ] 00000939 002.2 OF 003 ( under the General People 's Committee for [ORG Public Security  ] ) , [PER Taher Mahmoudi  ] , traffic fatalities are leveling off and starting to decrease due to a multi-pronged effort by the government . 
He said when he started as the head of the department three years ago , the government was approaching the problem only from a law enforcement perspective . 
The problem , however , was multi-faceted , and included driving at excessive speeds , disregard for seatbelt laws , and the cultural requirement to frequently visit family , even if they live large distances away . 
In addition , the rates of car ownership are very high . 
According to [PER Mahmoudi  ] , the government recently adopted a strategy to target traffic safety , which he described as based on the " four E 's " of [LOC Engineering  ] , [ORG Emergency Services  ] , Education and Environment . 
In [PER Mahmoudi  ] 's view , [LOC Libya  ] needs a " pragmatic approach " to traffic safety , led by a " decision-maker " within society . 
[PER Mahmoudi  ] identified the related problem of lack of coordination among police , the courts , licensing and inspection authorities , and educational bodies as an area that also needed to be addressed . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Mahmoudi  ] noted that [LOC Libya  ] has 30,000 kilometers of roads , but that the state did not differentiate how many of those were " safe " roads . 
Working with companies , such as [ORG Shell  ] , his office has directed resources from [LOC Libya  ] 's Roads and [ORG Bridges Authority  ] to upgrade particularly dangerous stretches of road around the country . 
[PER Mahmoudi  ] credits himself with the early 2009 addition of clearly visible road signs in [LOC Tripoli  ] , including along the heavily traveled " Second Ring Road . 
" According to [PER Mahmoudi  ] , prior to his efforts , over 20 miles of the city 's main highway were completely devoid of signage and exit markers . 
While the signs are currently only written in [MISC Arabic  ] ( he was refused permission to include [MISC English  ] ) , many of the signs do include pictograms ( such as an airplane indicating the airport ) and/or internationally-recognized symbols indicating speed limits and non-parking zones . 
The roads in eastern [LOC Libya  ] are especially hazardous due to dangerous passing habits on two-lane highways . 
Other country-wide problems include: driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol ( despite an alcohol ban in this [MISC Muslim  ] country ) , pedestrians wandering into traffic , talking or texting on cell phones while driving , corrupt practices in issuing licenses , and the lack of a car inspection regime . 
[PER Mahmoudi  ] said poor tire quality was also a serious issue , since many people used " cheap , poor-quality , [MISC Chinese  ] tires " on their vehicles . 
In a year and a half , [LOC Libya  ] will begin a program to inspect vehicles , which , if implemented , would be an important step towards keeping old , unsafe cars off the roads . 
[PER Mahmoudi  ] said that a new system for producing professional-quality drivers' licenses ( along with mandatory testing ) will also be developed . 
[ Note: At present , the [MISC Libyan  ] driver 's license is a hand-written , laminated card with no picture , which is easily forged . 
One can reportedly pay a [LOC US  ] 50 dollar bribe to a DMV-equivalent office clerk in exchange for a license . 
End note . 
] 7 . 
( C ) [PER Mahmoudi  ] said he was puzzled as to why " seemingly normal people " would become totally different once behind the wheel . 
He said many people in [LOC Libya  ] exhibited " criminal behavior " as soon as they got into their cars . 
He consulted a psychologist to try to gain insight into this phenomenon ; however , he still has not reached any conclusions . 
[PER Mahmoudi  ] believes the change in mindset vis-a-vis driving safety will be generational . 
Thus , he has launched an outreach program to educate secondary school students about road safety . 
He said the students report going home to their parents to discuss issues such as the need to wear seatbelts and other safety measures after interventions at their schools . 
FOREIGN PRIVATE SECTOR CONCERNED 8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most international companies have strict policies when it comes to driving , either not allowing their expatriate staff to drive in [LOC Libya  ] at all , or only allowing them to drive after completing a road safety course . 
The [MISC American  ] construction firm , [ORG AECOM  ] , decided to avoid any potential injuries to expatriate staff ( or liability issues if they were to hit someone ) by refusing to allow any expatriate staff to drive . 
Instead , transportation is provided to/from home to work and for other needs . 
Many oil companies have similar policies and provide cars with drivers to their staff . 
A few companies allow expatriates to drive , but only after taking a rigorous driver-safety courses . 
To monitor locally-hired drivers , many companies have outfitted vehicles with [MISC USB  ] devices that track speed , breaking patterns , and other factors for each shift ; this information is then downloaded and analyzed . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] oil company [ORG Amerada Hess  ] has witnessed a dramatic decrease in the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000939 003.2 OF 003 number of dents in its motorpool fleet since the company adopted the [MISC USB  ] system . 
The oil services company , [ORG Schlumberger  ] , has a particularly aggressive road safety strategy and employs an accident simulator called " the Convincer " that has participants experience what would happen to a baby ( in this case a greased watermelon ) in the event of a collision . 
[ORG Shell  ] has taken its program a step further to educate not only its own staff but also the general public about road safety . 
They have also teamed up with [PER Mahmoudi  ] 's department to improve treacherous roads in and around the areas where they are working in eastern [LOC Libya  ] . 
9 . 
( C ) Comment: A daily topic of discussion among expatriates and [MISC Libyans  ] alike is the appalling manner in which most people here drive . 
One theory is that [MISC Libyans  ] enjoy so few personal freedoms that driving their own cars with little regard for other drivers is something the regime permits as a sort of pressure valve . 
Most people shun the use of seatbelts , which they deem too constricting and uncomfortable . 
In a country with no discotheques , theaters , bars , and only one small shopping mall , young people have nowhere to go and nothing to do other than drive around in their parents' cars . 
As articulated by the head of [LOC Libya  ] 's traffic office , traffic safety will only be improved through a coordinated effort among various [MISC Libyan  ] authorities , including the police and infrastructure , justice , and education ministries . 
Opportunities to work with private companies exist , particularly with foreign companies , who recognize the need to protect their most precious assets ( their people ) and also to involve average [MISC Libyans  ] who have been touched by road tragedies . 
[ORG Organizations  ] including the [ORG Red Crescent Society  ] , the [ORG Scouts  ] and youth groups can also be involved in making roads safer . 
By working together , government , civil society , and the private sector can effect a gradual change in attitudes and behavior among [MISC Libyan  ] drivers . 
In the process , these programs can also have a positive impact on civic activism . 
Post aims to engage these actors to tackle the third highest killer of [MISC Libyans  ] using [ORG Economic Support Funds  ] and other resources that may become available .
