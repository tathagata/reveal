SECRETARY ( [ORG SECTO  ] ) 007 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Ivo Daalder  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This is an action request . 
See paragraph 10. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: Leaders in [LOC Estonia  ] , [LOC Latvia  ] , and [LOC Lithuania  ] are pressing hard for [ORG NATO Article  ] 5 contingency planning for the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] are on record supporting such contingency planning for Allies . 
At the same time , however , [ORG NATO  ] internal processes and politics make it difficult to openly carry out such planning , particularly if it would require specifying [LOC Russia  ] as a potential threat . 
Nevertheless , there are possible ways to meet the substance of [MISC Baltic  ] demands . 
The existing contingency plan for [LOC Poland  ] , for example , might be modified to include the [MISC Baltics  ] or generic plans for the use of the [ORG NATO Response Force  ] could be exercised and certified in a manner consistent with [MISC Baltic  ] defense . 
We request high-level interagency discussion of the issue to develop the substance and [ORG NATO  ] tactics of [MISC Baltic  ] planning and exercises . 
END SUMMARY Why [MISC Baltic Contingency Planning  ] ? -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As reported in refs A-D , leaders in [LOC Estonia  ] , [LOC Latvia  ] , and [LOC Lithuania  ] are pressing hard for [ORG NATO Article  ] 5 contingency planning for the defense of the [MISC Baltics  ] . 
The Administration at the highest levels is on record supporting such efforts . 
President [PER Obama  ] told [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General [PER Rasmussen  ] this during the latter 's September 28-29 trip to [LOC Washington  ] . 
Furthermore , Secretary [PER Clinton  ] told her colleagues at the September 22 " [MISC Trans-Atlantic Dinner  ] " in [LOC New York  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] wants more work on [ORG Article  ] 5 contingency plans ( ref E ) . 
The Difficulties ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At the same time , the internal processes and politics of the [ORG Alliance  ] make it unlikely that a [ORG Baltic-only Article  ] 5 contingency plan could be developed . 
[ORG NATO  ] contingency plans are designed for possible future security risks that are consistent with [ORG NATO  ] 's General Intelligence Estimate ( [ORG MC  ] 161 ) and [ORG NATO Ministerial Guidance  ] . 
While Admiral [MISC Stavridis  ] , the [ORG Supreme Allied Commander Europe  ] ( [ORG SACEUR  ] ) , does have the authority to generate , review and revise contingency plans based on changes in the strategic security environment , those changes to the security environment would need to be reflected in [ORG MC  ] 161 . 
Without a change to [ORG MC  ] 161 , [ORG SACEUR  ] does not have the authority to develop new [ORG Article  ] 5 contingency plans . 
Moreover , changes to [ORG MC  ] 161 are not made by [ORG SACEUR  ] . 
They must be agreed by the [ORG NAC.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In this case , the [MISC Baltic  ] states clearly believe that the [LOC Russian Federation  ] represents a future security risk and desire a contingency plan to address that risk . 
And therein lies the problem . 
While the exact content of [ORG MC  ] 161 cannot be discussed in this message , [MISC post-Cold War  ] [ORG NATO  ] has consistently said that it no longer views [LOC Russia  ] as a threat . 
Allies , for example , agreed to language in the 1997 [MISC NATO-Russia Founding Act  ] that " [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Russia  ] do not consider each other as adversaries . 
" As we saw during the debates over the [MISC Russia-Georgia  ] war , many Allies will take great pains to avoid even the suggestion that the [ORG Alliance  ] and [LOC Russia  ] are on course toward a new [MISC Cold War  ] . 
[LOC Countries  ] such as [LOC Germany  ] are unlikely to agree changes to [ORG MC  ] 161 that explicitly define [LOC Russia  ] as a potential threat , preferring instead to argue that the [ORG Alliance  ] needs to find a way to work cooperatively with [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[ORG USNATO  ] 00000464 002 OF 003 But Hard is Not " Too Hard " -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Despite these difficulties , however , there are steps that can be taken to meet the substance of the [MISC Baltic  ] demands and demonstrate the Allied commitment to their defense . 
As a start , [ORG SACEUR  ] did begin conducting informal " prudent planning " efforts within his own Headquarters in the wake of the [MISC Russian-Georgian  ] war . 
These efforts should continue . 
Furthermore , the existing [ORG NATO  ] contingency plan for [LOC Poland  ] is up for revision . 
We could explore the possibility of revising this plan to include the reinforcement/defense of the [MISC Baltics  ] as an element of the reinforcement/defense of [LOC Poland  ] . 
Indeed , this idea was first raised by the [MISC German  ] PermRep in conversation with Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] . 
[ORG NATO  ] also has a number of agreed generic contingency plans for the [ORG NATO Response Force  ] ( [ORG NRF  ] ) , including for relatively high-end " initial entry operations . 
" Perhaps these generic [ORG NRF  ] plans can be exercised/certified in a manner that would be consistent with the defense of the [MISC Baltics  ] . 
Finally , we could pursue a generic [ORG Article  ] 5 [ORG Alliance-wide  ] contingency plan which would be applicable to multiple threats . 
Necessary for [MISC NATO-Russia  ] ; Expeditionary Forces --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Baltic  ] reassurance can not be seen in isolation . 
Our ability to move forward with other [LOC U.S.  ] priorities at [ORG NATO  ] will be affected by our ability to reassure the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
For example , our ability to maintain an Allied consensus on re-engagement with [LOC Moscow  ] will depend on it . 
Furthermore , the [MISC Baltic  ] states have made clear that if they do not feel they can trust Allies to defend them , they will have to consider developing a force structure focused on territorial defense rather than on expeditionary capabilities . 
[ORG U.S. Reassurance Does Not Equal NATO Reassurance  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] has taken a number of bilateral steps to reassure the [MISC Baltics  ] , including tasking the [ORG U.S. European Command  ] ( which [PER ADM Stavridis  ] heads under his [MISC U.S.-only  ] hat ) to develop a plan for supporting [ORG NATO  ] deterrence and defense in the [MISC Baltic  ] region . 
While these efforts can be useful in supporting [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning and reassurance efforts , if done on their own they could actually undermine our efforts to reassure the [MISC Baltic  ] states that all [ORG NATO  ] Allies will carry out their [ORG Article  ] 5 commitments . 
Defense of the [MISC Baltics  ] must remain a [ORG NATO Article  ] 5 commitment , not solely a [LOC U.S.  ] bilateral one . 
Unless consensus can be achieved within the [ORG Alliance  ] to take positive steps in this direction , the [MISC Baltic  ] states will continue to lose faith in the [ORG Alliance  ] , undercutting a key [LOC U.S.  ] strategic objective . 
[LOC Washington  ] should not allow [LOC U.S.  ] bilateral reassurance efforts to become an easy substitute for [MISC NATO-wide  ] efforts . 
Recommended Way Ahead --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] has been having quiet conversations with some Allies , as well as with [ORG SACEUR  ] , to see what might be possible . 
We believe that a key aspect of any approach would be to socialize the [ORG NAC  ] on the issue through briefings by [ORG SACEUR  ] on current plans and the extent to which they satisfy the requirement to defend Allied territory . 
In addition to further consideration of the ideas in para 6 above , [ORG Mission  ] proposes the following as an initial way ahead on this issue that we should seek to set in train: -- The [ORG Military Committee  ] should task [ORG NATO Military Authorities  ] to review the current family of contingency plans to determine if they are sufficient to meet [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Article  ] 5 commitments ; [ORG USNATO  ] 00000464 003 OF 003 -- The [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] should ask [ORG SACEUR  ] to brief PermReps on the status of these plans and on their ability to provide for the defense/protection of Allied territory , populations , and [ORG Alliance  ] interests ; -- SHAPE should request that each Ally assess its own national plans and national contributions in support of these plans ; -- Strategic communications/public messaging regarding [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning would allow the [ORG Alliance  ] to highlight its efforts to provide for the protection of [ORG Alliance  ] territory from the range of threats ; -- Ongoing Strategic Concept discussion and seminars should be used to identify new security threats and ways to meet those threats . 
This process could help build consensus for new contingency planning efforts ; -- The [LOC U.S.  ] should consider the possibility/suitability of adapting the upcoming [MISC USEUCOM  ] bilateral exercise , " [MISC Baltic  ] Host 2010 , " into a [ORG NATO  ] deterrence and defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] states exercise ; and -- As [ORG NATO  ] contingency plans are developed , task the development of supporting [MISC USEUCOM  ] contingency plans. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mission  ] requests that a [ORG NATO  ] IPC be scheduled in the near future to discuss this issue further , with a view to developing a coherent interagency-agreed strategy on how to take forward the President 's vision of contingency planning in [ORG NATO  ] .
