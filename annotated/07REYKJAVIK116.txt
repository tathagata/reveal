Summary: The [MISC Icelandic  ] government is publicly backing away from its October 2006 decision to reestablish commercial whaling . 
The outspokenness of prominent business figures -- worried about the image of [LOC Iceland  ] --coupled with international pressure to stop whaling seems to be having an effect on the government 's thinking . 
The lack of a market for fin whale meat is adding to the growing public sentiment that although whaling is still an [MISC Icelandic  ] sovereign right , it 's a " stupid idea . 
" A jubilant environmentalist told post " we are winning the fight " and expects that the commercial whaling quota will not be renewed after this whaling season . 
He is pushing for [LOC Iceland  ] 's commissioner to make this announcement at the upcoming [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] meeting , conveniently slated for after the parliamentary elections in May 2007 . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In October 2006 , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] decided to allow commercial whaling again , issuing a quota for nine fin whales and 30 minkes , of which seven fins and one minke have been killed ( Ref C ) . 
In his most recent public comments on the issue , Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] said during an April 16 interview with [ORG Reuters  ] that , " what happened last year was an experiment . 
" [PER Haarde  ] said a number of factors , including global public opinion , the negative effect on tourism and especially whether there is a market for whale meat , would all have to be considered before a new decision is made. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This echoed what Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] said at the [ORG Federation of Icelandic Trade  ] ( an influential lobby group ) on February 16 ; although [PER Sverrisdottir  ] is convinced that whaling by [LOC Iceland  ] is justified , she could not disregard the warnings that have been raised about possible negative impact of whaling on [MISC Icelandic  ] commercial interests . 
She further commented that the [ORG GOI  ] would review carefully the impact commercial whaling would have on the nation 's image and business interests before any decision will be taken on further whaling . 
Minister of Fisheries [PER Einar Gudfinnsson  ] continues to zealously defend commercial whaling in the media but has conceded that if there is no market for whale products then commercial whaling is effectively over. ----------------------------------------- [ORG Business Community Loudly Opposes Whaling  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since the October decision , the business community has protested that the decision will harm [LOC Iceland  ] commercially by hurting [LOC Iceland  ] 's image . 
The Chairman of the [ORG Whale Watching Association  ] , a strong influence in the tourism sector , said , " This is a direct strike against the tourist industry in Iceland...killing large whales will have a very stark image abroad . 
" At the [ORG Icelandic Chamber of Commerce  ] annual meeting on February 7 , whaling became the unscheduled main issue of discussion . 
Harsh criticism came from two of the most powerful businessmen in [LOC Iceland  ] , [PER Jon Asgeir Johannesson  ] of [ORG Baugur Group  ] and [PER Lydur Gudmundsson  ] of [LOC Exista  ] investment firm. --------------------- Fin [ORG Whale Meat Unsold  ] --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) . 
The media reports that the meat from the seven fin whales killed last fall has not been sold and is sitting in storage . 
Speculation is that tests for the meat 's mercury and chemical content have not been finished and the [ORG Environment and Food Agency of Iceland  ] was unable to confirm to post when the results would be released . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's Chief Veterinarian told us that the procedures to actually export the meat are not clear and this further complicated the matter. ----------------------------------- Environmentalist Cautiously Hopeful ----------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) . 
Environmentalist [PER Arni Finnsson  ] told Econoff on April 18 that the Prime Minister 's remarks to foreign media clearly indicated the [MISC Icelandic  ] government was ready to change its position on commercial whaling and not reissue the commercial quota . 
[PER Finnsson  ] said public perception is changing and cited a March 22 Gallup poll his [ORG NGO  ] commissioned which found 40 percent of the public unhappy with commercial whaling . 
He summarized the public 's attitude as whaling remains a sovereign right but without economic justification it is a " stupid idea " to pursue . 
[PER Finnsson  ] , while caveating by knocking his knuckles on the wood table , said " we are winning the fight " against further whaling in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
He believes the commercial quota will not be renewed after expiration in August but that the decision on this season 's whaling will not be rescinded. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Finnsson  ] shared his desire that [LOC Iceland  ] make a public announcement on not renewing the commercial quota at the upcoming [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) meeting in [LOC Anchorage  ] . 
He called it a win-win for [LOC Iceland  ] to make such an announcement under the media spotlight and asked that our [ORG IWC  ] Commissioner suggest this idea to the [MISC Icelandic  ] Ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] beforehand. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: We agree with [PER Finnsson  ] that unless the fin whale meat can be sold at a profit it is unlikely the government will renew the commercial quota . 
By timing an announcement of this decision at the [ORG IWC  ] meeting , which occurs two weeks after parliamentary elections here , the [ORG GOI  ] would avoid any question of whaling influencing the elections .
