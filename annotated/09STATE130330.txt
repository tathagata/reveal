( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: We have received reports of an arms deal between the [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] and what is believed to be a front company for [MISC Serbian  ] arms dealer [PER Slobodan Tesic  ] . 
This individual is designated under the travel ban under [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution 1521  ] ( 2003 ) and its subsequent extensions for his assistance in providing arms to [LOC Liberia  ] in violation of the [ORG UN  ] arms embargo . 
[LOC Washington  ] seeks to verify this reporting with the government of [LOC Yemen  ] , and strongly urges [LOC Yemen  ] not to deal with individuals designated by [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolutions  ] . 
End Summary. ---------- BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Intelligence reporting indicates that in early October the [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] signed a weapons deal with , for $95 million in early October 2009 , to be delivered by early January 2010 . 
The scheduled delivery will include small arms ammunition , heavy artillery ammunition , sniper rifles , demolition equipment , anti-aircraft guns , and howitzers . 
Reporting indicates that , both named in the contract , are linked to [MISC Serbian  ] arms broker [PER Slobodan Tesic  ] , and that [PER Tesic  ] has made frequent trips to [LOC Yemen  ] in the past year in connection with this contract . 
[PER Tesic  ] is designated in the travel ban annex of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1521 for his assistance in providing arms to [LOC Liberia  ] in violation of the [ORG UN  ] arms embargo . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We have learned through sensitive reporting that [LOC Yemen  ] may be pursuing sizable arms deals with several other Eastern [MISC European  ] countries for $30 million to $55 million each . 
It is currently unclear if the [MISC Yemeni  ] government is merely shopping around , or if the country is actually attempting to purchase several hundred million dollars in small arms for use against [MISC Houthi  ] rebels . 
If the latter is true , we have concerns about stockpile security and the potential for these weapons to be diverted to [LOC Yemen  ] , s robust black market. ---------- OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Posts should seek to: --Ascertain whether the [ORG Yemen Government  ] is dealing with [PER Slobodan Tesic.  ] --Discourage [LOC Yemen  ] from working with individuals designated by [ORG United Nations  ] travel bans. --Note USG concerns about a possible small arms buildup in [LOC Yemen.  ] ------------------------------- ACTION REQUEST / TALKING POINTS ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
