<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L MADRID 000312 SIPDIS SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR S/CT COORDINATOR DAILEY AND EUR/WE NSC FOR [MISC JUAN ZARATE  ] DEA FOR MICHAEL BRAUN AND [PER THOMAS HARRIGAN E.O.  ] 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 03/12/2018 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PTER_0.html'>PTER</a> <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: SPAIN/AL-KASSAR: EXTRADITION NOT LIKELY UNTIL NEW GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE REF: MADRID 007 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Eduardo Aguirre  ] , Jr. for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [ORG Spanish Council of Ministers  ] ( [ORG COM  ] ) on March 7 failed to discuss and approve the [LOC U.S.  ] request for the extradition of [MISC Syrian  ] arms dealer [PER Monzer Al-Kassar  ] during its final meeting before Spaniards went to the polls to elect [LOC Spain  ] 's next government . 
The Ambassador and [ORG DCM  ] followed up with senior GOS officials to press them on the status of the case . 
The Ambassador phoned Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] on March 7 to express his disappointment over the [ORG COM  ] 's failure to approve the extradition , and the [ORG DCM  ] contacted Deputy Justice Minister [PER Perez-Hernandez  ] on March 12 to congratulate him on the elections results and to request an update on the case . 
Both officials said that some " technical and legal issues " have blocked action on the matter . 
[PER Perez-Hernandez  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that the [ORG MOJ  ] still did not have formal notification of the written decision from [ORG Appeals Court  ] Judge [PER Gomez-Bermudez  ] and therefore could not send the decision to the [ORG COM  ] for final review and approval . 
There appears to be a disconnect , as the [ORG DCM  ] met with Judge [PER Gomez-Bermudez  ] in late February and received assurance that the decision was completed and had been sent to the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , and [PER Perez-Hernandez  ] 's deputy told Embassy [ORG LES  ] legal advisor on March 3 that all documentation was in order and ready to go to the [ORG COM  ] . 
We will do what we can to sort through the confusion and obtain a copy of the official written appeals court decision . 
Regardless of the status of the decision , we are again in a holding pattern for the next several weeks . 
Embassy Madrid 's legal advisor tells us that [MISC Spanish  ] law prohibits an " interim " government ( such as we have now pending the formation of the new [ORG Zapatero  ] administration in April ) from approving extradition cases , preventing the [MISC Spanish  ] government from taking action until the new government is seated and the new [ORG Council of Ministers  ] convenes , probably in late April or early [PER May.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Further to [ORG REFTEL  ] comprehensive review of the ongoing case , we have continued efforts to achieve [PER Al-Kassar  ] 's successful extradition to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Bureaucratic delays , a labor strike at [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Court  ] now in its sixth week , and a probable desire on the part of the government to avoid this case becoming a negative electoral issue , served to slow this process more than we would have liked . 
Our objective now is to ensure that Judge [PER Gomez-Bermudez  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] are on the same page in regards to the written decision so that the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] is prepared to deal with this issue when the new government takes office . 
The Ambassador plans to engage directly with Justice Minister [PER Fernandez Bermejo  ] to ensure prompt attention to this matter . 
The [LOC Madrid Country Team  ] will continue to work this case at the highest levels to reinforce to the [MISC Spanish  ] government our desire to see [PER Al-Kassar  ] in [LOC U.S.  ] custody as soon as possible . 
Other than the delay described above , we have every reason to believe the extradition will move forward .
