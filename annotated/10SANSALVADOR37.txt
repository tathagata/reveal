( C ) [MISC Summary: Eight  ] months into the [PER Funes  ] presidency , the [ORG GOES  ] can best be characterized as schizophrenic . 
The part of the government that [PER Funes  ] controls is moderate , pragmatic , responsibly left-of-center and friendly to the [ORG USG  ] . 
The part he has ceded to hard-line elements of the ( left-wing ) [ORG Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  ] ( [MISC FMLN  ] ) is seeking to carry out the [MISC Bolivarian  ] , [PER Chavista  ] game-plan , including implacable hostility towards the [ORG USG  ] . 
Divisions on the right have given the [MISC FMLN  ] a dominant position in the [ORG Legislative Assembly  ] . 
However , the [MISC FMLN  ] does not have an outright majority in the legislature , and it faces strong opposition in the popular and independent-minded President [PER Funes  ] . 
[PER Funes  ] 's popularity could erode quickly if his administration does not start showing visible results in reducing violent crime and reviving the economy . 
The government 's long-run inability to tackle crime or produce economic growth , coupled with petty infighting and corruption within the country 's political parties , raises questions about the future of democratic governance in [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
End summary. --------------------------------------- [MISC FUNES-FMLN  ] RELATIONS STRAINED BUT CIVIL --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [PER S  ] ) The [MISC FMLN  ] 's relationship-of-convenience with [PER Mauricio Funes  ] has soured since the March 2009 election . 
Early in his tenure , [PER Funes  ] surrounded himself with centrist advisors and laid out a moderate , pro-U.S. foreign policy - moves [MISC FMLN  ] hardliners saw as an attempt to distance himself from their influence . 
Recognizing [PER Funes  ] 's popularity and needing his support , the [MISC FMLN  ] sought subtle ways to challenge [PER Funes  ] 's independence . 
Starting in September 2009 , [MISC FMLN  ] hardliners within [PER Funes  ] 's cabinet ( most notably Vice President and Education Minister [PER Salvador Sanchez Ceren  ] ) gave anti-American speeches , announced [LOC El Salvador  ] 's intention to join [ORG ALBA  ] , and made high-profile visits to [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] - each action carefully choreographed to defy [PER Funes  ] 's agenda but with the pretense that the officials were acting as [MISC FMLN  ] representatives , not as members of the [PER Funes  ] government ( see reftel A ) . 
Meanwhile , Public Security Minister [PER Manuel Melgar  ] has sought to politicize the [ORG National Civilian Police  ] ( [ORG PNC  ] ) and the [MISC FMLN  ] has used its " territorial " ministries ( Labor , Health , Education and Gobernacion ) to extend their geographic and bureaucratic hold over the [ORG GOES  ] . 
[PER Funes  ] advisors told us the [MISC FMLN  ] may have also used their control of the [MISC Salvadoran  ] intelligence agency to bug phones in the [PER Casa Presidencial  ] ( see reftel B ) . 
Thus far , however , the two sides continue to cooperate on issues of mutual interest , including the budget and tax reform passed in December. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While the [MISC Funes-FMLN  ] conflict would appear to benefit the right , internal divisions there have prevented the ( center-right ) [ORG National Republican Alliance  ] ( [ORG ARENA  ] ) from mounting a serious opposition . 
Since October , thirteen legislative deputies and scores of mayors and local party functionaries have left [ORG ARENA  ] , most of them joining the newly-formed [ORG Grand Alliance  ] for [ORG National Unity  ] ( [ORG GANA  ] ) ( see reftel C ) . 
[ORG ARENA  ] leaders blame these defections on former president [PER Antonio Saca  ] , whom the party expelled from its ranks in December 2009 . 
While not officially a member of any party , [PER Saca  ] is widely rumored to be the inspirational and financial force behind [ORG GANA.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) This crisis has not only dashed [ORG ARENA  ] 's hope of forming a majority alliance in the [ORG Legislative Assembly  ] , it has also called into question the identity of the party , for years considered one of the most well-organized and ideologically-unified in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Still , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that the crisis has galvanized the party 's base , which [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] says is " angry as hell " at [PER Saca  ] and the [ORG GANA  ] " traitors . 
" According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , in February [ORG ARENA  ] plans to roll out a Contract with America-style publicity campaign that will emphasize " center-right pragmatism " and distance the party from President [PER Saca  ] 's corrupt legacy . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG ARENA  ] president [PER Alfredo Cristiani  ] has instructed party leaders to focus their criticism on the [MISC FMLN  ] and avoid attacking [ORG GANA  ] or President [PER Funes  ] , both of which [ORG ARENA  ] views as potential allies . 
Until the 2012 legislative elections , however , [ORG ARENA  ] will remain a marginalized force in national politics. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Aside from the [MISC FMLN  ] and [ORG ARENA  ] , the country 's other political parties are small , weak , and ideologically malleable . 
Their only real selling points are as coalition partners providing the final votes on closely fought legislation . 
Neither the [MISC FMLN  ] nor [ORG ARENA  ] can achieve a legislative majority without the support of [ORG GANA  ] or the ( opportunist ) [ORG National Conciliation Party  ] ( [ORG PCN  ] ) . 
In recent months , the [MISC FMLN  ] has teamed with both [ORG GANA  ] and the [ORG PCN  ] to reshuffle the legislature 's leadership positions and pass a contentious tax increase ( see reftels D and E ) . 
Given their strategic positions , [ORG GANA  ] and the [ORG PCN  ] will likely remain major players in legislative battles ahead , demanding , as they were rumored to have done in their previous votes with the [MISC FMLN  ] , political favors and covert payments in exchange for their support. ----------------------------------------- [PER Funes  ] 's [ORG Challenges: Crime  ] and the Economy ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Public security ranks atop most polling on the nation 's priorities , particularly after a 37 percent increase in homicides in 2009 . 
Despite great efforts , successive administrations have failed to make much of a dent in the intractable street-gang problem , so [PER Funes  ] 's team will need to be both creative and ambitious in its approach to make any headway . 
So far , they have been neither . 
[PER Funes  ] 's most significant public security reform to date has been a temporary deployment of troops to patrol high-crime areas ( see reftel F ) which news reports suggest may have moderately reduced crime in those areas since the November 2009 deployment . 
However , the constitution limits such deployments to six months , and [PER Funes  ] has yet to propose reforms to the [ORG GOES  ] security apparatus that would make those gains sustainable . 
He has not moved to provide the [ORG National Civilian Police  ] ( [ORG PNC  ] ) with significant increases of badly-needed personnel , equipment and training , nor sought institutional changes in [ORG PNC  ] culture , that will result in more effective law enforcement and crime control. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The other major concern for the [ORG GOES  ] is the sluggish economy , which continues to feel the effects of the global financial crisis and the recession in the [LOC U.S.  ] According to the [ORG GOES  ] , GDP declined 3.5 percent in 2009 and is projected to grow less than 1 percent in 2010 - its worst two-year performance since <a id='par1992' href='#par1992'>¶</a>1992 . 
Unfortunately , [PER Funes  ] has few options available to stimulate a recovery: the [ORG GOES  ] has limited funds for countercyclical fiscal activity , even with President [PER Funes  ] 's modest tax increase , and dollarization rules out monetary stimulus . 
[PER Funes  ] and his economic team understand the importance of free-market incentives , but have been anemic in their efforts to attract private investment . 
Ultimately , powerful trade and remittance relationships mean that the [MISC Salvadoran  ] economy will only recover following a sustained economic recovery in the [LOC U.S.  ] ------- Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG GANA  ] 's threat to [ORG ARENA  ] now appears more serious than it did at first . 
[ORG GANA  ] has poached dozens of [MISC ARENA-loyalists  ] in recent weeks and has demonstrated through an extravagant convention and a subsequent publicity campaign that it has the deep pockets to put up a real fight . 
Whispers within [ORG ARENA  ] also suggest [ORG GANA  ] 's critique of [ORG ARENA  ] 's elitism has struck a chord among mid-level party functionaries , many of whom secretly sympathize with [ORG GANA  ] despite remaining within [ORG ARENA  ] . 
[ORG ARENA  ] 's rebound depends on recuperating financing , which it lost when it became an opposition party without [ORG GOES  ] patronage to hand out . 
It still represents the only organized force capable of confronting the growing influence of the [ORG FMLN.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Funes  ] 's ego has little chance of rapprochement with the hard-line [MISC FMLN  ] . 
If things continue to deteriorate , we could see an open break between the two sides , possibly resulting in a new alliance between [PER Funes  ] and an existing party ( perhaps the center-left [MISC Democratic Change  ] ( CD ) ) for the 2012 legislative elections . 
[PER Funes  ] would then need to shake up his cabinet and seek right-of-center allies in the [ORG Legislative Assembly  ] to pass his agenda . 
The [MISC FMLN  ] response would be ugly - massive street protests , labor strikes , road blockages , threats of violence , legislative logjams - and paralyze some government operations and place a further drag on the struggling economy. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOES  ] 's inability to make gains in public security , continued anemic growth and the disintegration of the right taken together present a challenging road ahead for democracy in [LOC El Salvador  ] , especially if coupled with a [MISC Funes-FMLN  ] split . 
[PER Funes  ] 's persistent high popularity ratings , now well over 80 percent , make it too soon to sound the alarm , but democratic institutions are vulnerable . 
[PER Sanchez Ceren  ] 's recent call for sweeping constitutional reforms to institute " participatory democracy " is a timely reminder that the hard-line [MISC FMLN  ] 's threat to [MISC Salvadoran  ] democracy is real . 
The [MISC Embassy  ] , allied with civil society , will continue to engage and support moderates in the [ORG GOES  ] while working with democratic forces across the political spectrum to strengthen [MISC Salvadoran  ] constitutional institutions .
