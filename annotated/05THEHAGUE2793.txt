Schofer  ] , Acting DCM , for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: In the largest single counter-terrorism action in the [LOC Netherlands  ] since the 9/11 attacks , a newly formed rapid intervention team arrested six men and one woman in The [ORG Hague  ] , [LOC Amsterdam  ] and [LOC Almere  ] on October 14 . 
Among those arrested were [PER Jermaine Walters  ] , the brother of ( [MISC American  ] ) [PER Hofstad  ] suspect [PER Jason Walters  ] , and [PER Samir Azzouz  ] , a [MISC Dutch  ] teenager or [MISC Moroccan  ] origin acquitted in April of plotting attacks on [LOC Amsterdam  ] airport , a nuclear reactor and [MISC Dutch  ] governmental buildings . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The public prosecutors office confirmed that the sweeps netted seven suspects , including four in The [ORG Hague  ] , two in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , and one in [LOC Almere  ] . 
News of the arrests is dominating local media . 
A press spokesperson at the prosecutors' office confirmed to us the arrest of [PER Jermaine Walters  ] , but stressed the prosecutors' office would not confirm that information publicly . 
The spokesperson told [ORG Emboff  ] that the seven will appear in a [LOC Rotterdam  ] court on October 17 on charges of terrorist activities , including planning terrorist attacks on politicians and the offices of the [MISC Dutch  ] intelligence service ( [ORG AIVD  ] ) in [LOC Leidschendam  ] . 
No weapons have yet been discovered , according to the spokesman , but investigations and house searches continue. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Office of the [ORG Counter-Terrorism Coordinator  ] ( [ORG NCTb  ] ) ordered security tightened today around a number of politicians , [ORG Parliament  ] , [ORG AIVD  ] offices , and both the [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Interior Ministries  ] . 
[ORG AIVD  ] information indicating that [PER Azzouz  ] was seeking automatic weapons and explosives to carry out attacks on politicians and [MISC Dutch  ] government buildings , reported by the press and public prosecutors' office , prompted the move . 
[ORG NCTb  ] officials would not comment on which politicians received additional protection . 
Although [MISC Dutch  ] intelligence reports indicated that only the [ORG AIVD  ] building was targeted specifically , the [ORG NCTb  ] bolstered security at the other sites as a precaution , according to the spokesperson at the prosecutors office . 
A senior [ORG NCTb  ] official , [PER Ewald Riks  ] , told us the security would likely stay in place a few days until the threat had been removed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) There was some disagreement over the impact of the arrests on the [PER Hofstad  ] group . 
National Counter-Terrorism [ORG Coordinator  ] [PER Tjibbe Joustra  ] told Charge that today 's arrests , combined with the previous arrests of some 10 suspected [PER Hofstad  ] members currently on trial for their membership in this alleged terrorist organization , meant that a substantial part of the group was now in custody . 
He added , however , that of course you never know if you have them all ; it is a very loose network . 
Interior Minister [PER Remkes separately  ] told reporters that the threat has not disappeared but the immediate threat has been removed , adding that despite earlier arrests , the [PER Hofstad  ] group is growing in size. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to [ORG NCTb  ] 's [PER Riks  ] , no shots were fired and no injuries were sustained in the raids , conducted by the rapid intervention team . 
This was the first major use of the combined military and police team , designed specifically for counter-terrorism actions . 
The team was recently empowered with arrest authority. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG GONL  ] has no plans to raise either the national threat level in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , currently considered substantial , or the state of alert for any of the seven critical infrastructure sectors included in the [LOC Netherlands'  ] new counter-terrorism alert system. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG GONL  ] told us there are no known direct threats towards [LOC U.S.  ] interests at this time . 
The Embassy and Consulate are already in a heightened state of alert and will maintain their current security posture . 
All Mission personnel have been reminded to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the local authorities and the [ORG RSO  ] . 
Post is prepared to initiate appropriate steps should the local threat environment change .
