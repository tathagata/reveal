Pierce  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: On September 29 , the [MISC Irish  ] government announced plans to back deposits in all [MISC Irish-domiciled  ] banks . 
Foreign banks with significant [MISC Irish  ] operations were initially left out of the scheme but some look now to be included . 
[MISC Irish  ] government officials maintain that impaired assets at [MISC Irish  ] banks are still relatively insignificant and are mostly confined to commercial property loans . 
They say that regulatory oversight of the financial sector will be tightened and that the drying up of credit to [MISC Irish  ] banks forced the decision to guarantee all deposits . 
The crush on [MISC Irish  ] banks could not have come at a worse time -- immediately preceding next week’s presentation of what is widely expected as the most austere government budget in years . 
End Summary . 
A Crisis Unfolds ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Following a late-night September 29 meeting with leading bankers -- [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor [PER John Hurley  ] and Chief Executive of the [ORG Financial Regulator Pat Neary  ] -- Prime Minister [PER Brian Cowen  ] took the decision to guarantee the deposits , loans , and obligations of the six Irish-owned Banks for two years . 
The next day Finance Minister [PER Brian Lenihan  ] and [PER Hurley  ] briefed their key [MISC European  ] counterparts . 
During a marathon session ( almost 22 hours , a record ) on October 1 , the [MISC Irish  ] parliament passed legislation that would make the guarantee operational . 
On October 2 , President [PER Mary McAleese  ] signed the [ORG Credit Institutions  ] ( [ORG Financial Support  ] ) Bill 2008 into law . 
On October 6 , [PER Lenihan  ] faced questions about the scheme from other [ORG EU  ] Finance Minister at an [MISC ECOFIN  ] meeting in [LOC Brussels  ] and the [ORG Central Bank  ] and the [ORG Regulatory Authority  ] met to finalize the terms of the plan . 
On October 8 , the [MISC Irish  ] Cabinet met to discuss the plan but delayed announcing anything until the [ORG EU  ] gives its formal approval , which is widely expected to happen early next week . 
A Perfect Storm --------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Econoff and visiting [MISC EUR/WE  ] Desk Officer met with [ORG Central Bank  ] and [ORG Financial Services Authority  ] officials [PER Gordon Barham  ] , [PER Maria Woods  ] , and [PER Billy Clarke  ] on October 6 to talk about the government’s bank guarantee plan . 
[PER Clarke  ] said that the regulator had been carefully watching the banking sector as the months-long credit contraction unfolded . 
Explaining the seemingly sudden pressure on [MISC Irish  ] banks last week , he said a “perfect storm” of external events related to the credit crisis had dried up the traditional sources of financing for [MISC Irish  ] financial institutions . 
[PER Barham  ] maintained that the level of impaired assets in the system stood at between 0.5 and 0.8 percent and these are mostly confined to loans to commercial property developers . 
When pressed , [PER Barham  ] said the media had exaggerated the level of problem assets and those that existed could be managed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Clarke  ] hesitated to make predictions but said that it is “likely” the regulatory system would move from one that relied heavily on bank management working within broad guidelines laid down by the regulator to a “rules-based” one . 
An example he gave was that the regulator may be given the authority to limit the percentage of the banks’ loan books that are extended to any one sector ( i.e. commercial or residential property ) . 
[PER Barham  ] and [PER Clarke  ] said that the banks would not be allowed to securitize and sell impaired assets under this scheme . 
Rather , the banks , the regulator , and other government agencies would have to figure out how to “unwind the problem assets without exposing the [MISC Irish  ] taxpayer to undue risk.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Econoff spoke with [PER Kevin Cardiff  ] , Second Secretary General at the [ORG Department of Finance  ] , who has been deeply involved in putting together the guarantee package . 
[PER Cardiff  ] echoed the regulator and pointed out that auditors contracted by his [ORG Department to  ] look at the books of at least two of the institutions under pressure came away with “a favorable impression of the loan books.” While he admitted that the amount of “speculative loans , or those that are not currently productive , is not insignificant , ” he stressed that all involved in putting together the package were confident that the government would not be forced to bail out the banks. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Cardiff  ] said that credit to the [MISC Irish  ] banks “virtually dried up” on September 29 and that the government had to step in to salvage the [MISC Irish  ] financial sector . 
The genesis of this was classic “herd mentality” based mostly on rumor and innuendo about [MISC Irish  ] banks rather than any hard facts . 
However , fighting the herd became impossible , he added . 
He added that non-Irish institutions with significant [MISC Irish  ] [LOC DUBLIN  ] 00000556 002.2 OF 002 operationsXXXXXXXXXXXX would likely be included in the scheme . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Although the move did not win any friends across [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Cardiff  ] said that there is a gradual realization in [LOC Brussels  ] that each country should be allowed to tailor its response to local conditions . 
He characterized the [MISC Irish  ] government’s discussion with [ORG EU  ] officials as “positive” and indicated that the [MISC Irish  ] solution would soon gain approval . 
In an aside , he pointed out that [MISC Irish  ] Finance Minister [PER Brian Lenihan  ] and his [MISC British  ] counterpart , [PER Alistair Darling  ] , had engaged in a very constructive exchange of views . 
[PER Cardiff  ] continued that the prevailing mood in [LOC Europe  ] is that “large-scale failures just make things worse” and that he expected more [MISC Irish-like  ] solutions . 
He warned , though , that the battle had just begun . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Against the background of a steep slump in the property market and anecdotal evidence we have picked up , it may be that government officials are being a bit optimistic in their assessment of the level of impaired assets . 
It begs the question: if the level of impaired assets is not a problem , why the sudden pressure on [MISC Irish  ] banks ? 
Perhaps the perfect storm answer is the right one . 
Whatever the answer , the [MISC Irish  ] government has its work cut out for it as it works with the private sector to stop the bleeding and then rebuild the [MISC Irish  ] financial sector . 
With the government maintaining that the [MISC Irish  ] banking sector nearly collapsed during the past two weeks and the announcement of what is expected to be a very draconian 2009 government budget next week , [MISC Irish  ] economic policymakers are facing their most significant challenge in decades .
