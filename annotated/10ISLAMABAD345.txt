( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a meeting with [ORG DCM  ] and POLOFFs on February 8 , a group of moderate [MISC Muslim  ] religious leaders expressed very strong feelings about the [PER Siddiqui  ] case and the guilty verdict . 
The religious leaders were unified in their belief that [PER Siddiqui  ] did not receive a fair trial and called for mercy on the grounds that she was a woman . 
They claimed that the verdict detracted from President [PER Obama  ] , s efforts to reach out to the [MISC Muslim  ] community and that he should step in and release [PER Siddiqui  ] as a show of good faith towards the world , s [MISC Muslims  ] . 
The US Embassy representatives pushed back noting that [PER Siddiqui  ] had receieved a fair trail in the [LOC U.S.  ] , was given every opportunity to present evidence in her own defense , and was convicted by a jury . 
Moreover , [PER Siddiqui  ] has the right to appeal her conviction .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The [PER Siddiqui  ] case has from its outset elicited a strong , emotional response among the [MISC Pakistani  ] public , and has regularly been raised with us by senior [MISC Pakistani  ] officials . 
Many [MISC Pakistanis  ] were undoubtedly taken by surprise by the verdict as one-sided media coverage of the case reported only her defense and not the prosecution’s case , leading local observers to conclude her acquital was a near certainty . 
We expect this issue to persist for some time as a nationalistic cause with the active involvement of the [ORG JI  ] who never tire of anti-American agitation .
