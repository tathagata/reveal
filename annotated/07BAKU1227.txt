( C ) SUMMARY: In a one-hour one-on-one meeting with the Ambassador on October 8 , President [PER Aliyev  ] outlined with frustration current problems on energy in advance of the [LOC Vilnius Summit  ] . 
[ORG British Petroleum  ] ( [ORG BP  ] ) is “stealing our oil , ” he asserted sharply , seeking to put pressure on [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to delay to 2010 the advent of an 80/20 profit split due next year under the [MISC Azeri Chirag  ] [ORG Guneshli  ] ( [ORG ACG  ] ) [MISC Production Sharing Agreement  ] ( [ORG PSA  ] ) by threatening to cut back on gas it provides to the [ORG GOAJ  ] from the [ORG ACG  ] field from 3 bcm to 1.4 bcm. “Only [LOC Georgia  ] will suffer” if [ORG BP  ] continues down this path , he warned , noting [ORG Azerbaijan’s  ] commitment , otherwise , to help [LOC Georgia  ] on gas this winter . 
He said the [MISC Georgian  ] PM had promised him to enlist Washington’s help with [ORG BP  ] . 
He said [ORG BP  ] had asked for time , until October 19 , to resume talks . 
If a good response is not found , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] “will make public that [ORG BP  ] is stealing our oil , ” [PER Aliyev  ] stated . 
Similarly , he said , Turkey’s 15 percent netback pricing scheme for gas transit is “unacceptable” as it would require [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to disclose to [LOC Turkey  ] sales agreements with customers in [LOC Europe  ] and allow [LOC Turkey  ] to sell 15 percent of [ORG Azerbaijan’s  ] gas to [MISC European  ] markets . 
A transit agreement is “not so urgent for us that we will accept unjustified conditions from [LOC Turkey.”  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary Continued: [LOC Azerbaijan  ] has an MOU with [LOC Greece  ] , will soon launch talks with [LOC Italy  ] , and will not allow [LOC Turkey  ] to “block the [MISC Azerbaijan-Europe  ] partnership.” He said [LOC Turkmenistan  ] seems to want the trans-Caspian option to be implemented but “to hide it from [LOC Russia.” Azerbaijan  ] has shown “maximum constructiveness” -- offering its infrastructure to [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and pledging to serve as purely a transit country -- but [LOC Azerbaijan  ] will not initiate next steps with [LOC Turkmenistan  ] -- “We cannot want it more than they do.” [LOC Azerbaijan  ] does support the [LOC Odessa-Brody-Plotsk  ] oil pipeline for political reasons ( “Ukraine , [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] are friends to us.” ) and will present a concrete plan on next steps at a meeting in [LOC Vilnius  ] with [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Lithuania  ] , and [LOC Georgia  ] with the aim of making the project commercially feasible . 
[PER Aliyev  ] asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] try to deliver the message on the unacceptability of the 15 percent netback pricing proposal to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
He continues to support Nazarbayev’s idea of a 3-way summit between [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] as a good signal and a way to strengthen 3-way relations , but will not initiate the meeting . 
End Summary . 
[MISC Georgian  ] Winter Gas ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Aliyev  ] opened the discussion on energy by saying that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] will help [LOC Georgia  ] this winter as it has in the past . 
He said he confirmed this to the visiting [MISC Georgian  ] PM during his September 27 visit to [LOC Baku  ] . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] , however , is having some difficulties with [ORG BP  ] , he said . 
Because the [ORG GOAJ  ] halted negotiations on [ORG PSA  ] extension and [PER Shah Deniz  ] development , [ORG BP  ] is now “trying to put political pressure on us by cutting back on gas it is giving to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , from 3 bcm to 1.4 bcm.” But “only [LOC Georgia  ] will suffer” from this step because the [PER Shah Deniz  ] gas they will receive from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] will not be enough. “If [ORG BP  ] reduces the gas it is giving [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] will get less.” The [MISC Georgian  ] PM , [PER Aliyev  ] said , had told him he is aware of this danger , and had said he would talk to [LOC Washington  ] to “get them to help us.” ( See Ref . 
A for background on [MISC Azerbaijan-BP  ] negotiations . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] continued that “these things are inter-connected . 
If [ORG BP  ] is supportive and helpful , there will be no problem supplying [MISC Georgia.” But  ] the situation with [ORG BP  ] is “unpleasant -- they are cheating us on the [ORG PSA  ] profit split according to our calculations.” The [ORG GOAJ  ] believes that the profit split should have changed in the second quarter of this year. “They are stealing our oil -- they are unilaterally changing the formula on the ROR ( rate of return ) so the profit split will take place in 2010 . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] spoke to ( [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] head ) [PER Bill Schrader  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] asked for time , until October 19 , to come back to discussions.” [ORG BAKU  ] 00001227 002 OF 003 ( Comment: [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] on October 9 had no news of an impending visit by [ORG BP  ] CEO , per Ref . 
B. End comment . 
) If there is not a good response , “we’ll make public that [ORG BP  ] is stealing our oil . . . oil that belongs to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , because [ORG BP  ] wants the 80/20 profit split that should occur next year to be pushed to 2010.” The [MISC Georgian  ] situation , [PER Aliyev  ] repeated , “is connected to that.” [MISC Turkey Transit Agreement  ] ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] said that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] rejects the [MISC Turks’  ] 15 percent netback proposal . 
The [MISC Turkish  ] formula would require [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to disclose to the GOT its commercial agreements with [LOC Greece  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and other [MISC European  ] countries -- “anywhere our gas goes.” The netback pricing proposal is “not acceptable -- it does not exist in any other transit agreement . 
We would lose money and [LOC Turkey  ] could sell 15 percent of our oil to our markets . 
This is not fair . 
We’ll pay an agreed transit tariff . 
We want to do it on the basis of best international practice . 
Our position with [LOC Turkey  ] is pretty strong . 
If they block an agreement , they are responsible . 
The Minister always says [LOC Turkey  ] will do the necessary , but then does nothing . 
We will not accept pressure.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] noted that it is [LOC Turkey  ] and [MISC European  ] consumers who need the transit agreement. “It is not so urgent for us that we will agree to unjustified conditions with [ORG Turkey.” Azerbaijan  ] has existing and adequate markets for its gas in [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] , he noted . 
[PER Aliyev  ] asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] “deliver ( to [LOC Turkey  ] ) if it can , this message . 
[LOC Turkey  ] wants to get everything.” [LOC Turkey  ] does not understand that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] has signed an MOU with [LOC Greece  ] and will soon start negotiations with [LOC Italy.  ] “Turkey cannot block the [LOC Azerbaijan-Europe  ] partnership.” [PER Aliyev  ] said Finance Minister [PER Samir Sharifov’s  ] proposal for [ORG USTDA  ] technical assistance to review best international practice in transit agreements was a good one . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] wants the transit agreement with [LOC Turkey  ] to be based on best international practice , not to “invent something new.” He encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to consider the technical assistance . 
[LOC Turkmenistan  ] and [ORG Trans-Caspian Gas  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] pointed to [MISC Turkmen  ] President Berdimuhamedov’s statement that he would “sell gas to [LOC Europe  ] at [LOC Turkmenistan’s  ] border , ” adding , however , that he had failed to specify which border he was referring to -- that with [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , or the [LOC Caspian Sea  ] ? 
[PER Aliyev  ] said it was his sense that [LOC Turkmenistan  ] wants the trans-Caspian option to be implemented but “wants to hide it from [ORG Russia.” Azerbaijan  ] , he said , has shown “maximum constructiveness -- we offered all our infrastructure ; we said we’d be a purely transit country , not do like [LOC Turkey  ] is trying to do . 
But we will not be more interested than they . 
I will not initiate a meeting with Berdimuhamedov -- it is not right to do.” [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , he repeated , “will not initiate discussions with [LOC Turkmenistan  ] because we do not need its gas -- we cannot be seen to want it ( the trans-Caspian option ) more than they do.” [LOC Odessa-Brody-Plotsk  ] ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Azerbaijan  ] has finalized its energy plan , [PER Aliyev  ] said . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] supported the [LOC Krakow Summit  ] and the proposed [LOC Odessa-Brody-Plotsk  ] oil pipeline “even though the project is seen as anti-Russian” because [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] are friendly to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that the key is for [LOC Odessa-Brody-Plotsk  ] to be “commercially feasible.” For this reason , he had asked Energy Minister [PER Natiq Aliyev  ] to prepare a concrete proposal for discussion in [LOC Vilnius  ] . 
This will include Azerbaijan’s joining as a shareholder in the [LOC Sarmitia  ] pipeline , and the launch of a feasibility study . 
In addition , a joint trading company for [LOC Black Sea  ] oil will be created . 
With [LOC Supsa  ] and [LOC Novorossisk  ] , there is a great deal of [LOC Black Sea  ] oil available , [PER Aliyev  ] said . 
The key , he repeated , is to make the [LOC Odessa-Brody-Plotsk  ] project commercially feasible . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] supports it “more to show political support than any urgent need” economically . 
[ORG BAKU  ] 00001227 003 OF 003 Three-way [ORG Summit  ] ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] said that [MISC Lithuanian  ] PM [PER Adamkus  ] had told him in [LOC Vilnius  ] last month that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] would not attend the [LOC Vilnius Summit  ] . 
He said , again with some frustration , that the idea of a 3-way [MISC Azerbaijan-Turkmenistan-Kazakhstan  ] summit was Nazarbayev’s idea , but there has been no further progress on taking it forward to his knowledge . 
With the clear implication that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] should take its idea forward , [PER Aliyev  ] said he still believes such a trilateral meeting “would send a good signal , strengthening our relations and could be a positive thing.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Aliyev  ] was clearly frustrated and uncharacteristically sharp in discussing [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and especially [ORG BP  ] , and disappointed with what he sees as Kazakhstan’s equivocation . 
He repeated throughout the conversation that Azerbaijan’s interest in delivering gas to [LOC Europe  ] is strategic , driven by Azerbaijan’s desire for a deeper partnership with [LOC Europe  ] . 
He also underscored , in a clear reference to [LOC Russia  ] , that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] “cannot be seen” to be more in the lead than others in the region on gas issues . 
It will be important to reassure [PER Aliyev  ] in [LOC Vilnius  ] of the USG’s commitment to the southern corridor and to working closely with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to realize it , and to encourage him to find a productive way forward , in practical terms , with [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and [ORG BP  ] . 
Septel will provide further insights from both [ORG BP  ] and [ORG SOCAR  ] on both the state of [MISC GOAJ-AIOC  ] negotiations and Azerbaijan’s ability to provide gas to [LOC Georgia  ] this winter .
