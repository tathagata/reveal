<code><pre>Thursday , 11 February 2010 , 13:07 S E C R E T NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 000287 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 02/10/2020 TAGS PREL , [LOC PTER  ] , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC SENV  ] , [LOC AF  ] , [LOC PK  ] , IN SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR CODEL KERRY’S VISIT TO [LOC INDIA  ] Classified By: A/DCM [PER Uzra Zeya  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( B , D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Summary: You will find an [MISC Indian  ] government that is more committed than ever to building a durable and wide ranging [MISC USG-GOI  ] relationship after Prime Minister [PER Singh’s Washington  ] visit in November . 
[LOC New Delhi  ] has been broadly supportive of [ORG USG  ] goals in both [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
After refusing post-Mumbai to engage broadly with [LOC Pakistan  ] until [LOC Islamabad  ] took action against the attack perpetrators , [LOC New Delhi  ] has now offered unconditional talks to [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
This is a calculated risk on PM Singh’s part given the political fallout over last summer’s [MISC India-Pakistan  ] joint statement at [LOC Sharm al Sheikh  ] . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , there are underlying concerns that [LOC U.S.  ] policy foreshadows an early exit from [LOC Afghanistan  ] with negative security consequences for [LOC India  ] . 
[LOC India  ] has expressed concern about the outlines of the reintegration policy promoted by the [MISC Karzai  ] government and supported by the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has begun to weigh a policy response that may include increased [MISC Afghan  ] police and military training/assistance . 
They will be interested in your views on [MISC India’s  ] role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Our bilateral [MISC Civil-Nuclear Agreement  ] no longer dominates the headlines , but the goodwill it generated has contributed to our improved relationship across the board and to [MISC India’s  ] gradual movement toward the nonproliferation mainstream . 
Several Agreement implementation measures remain unresolved . 
The [MISC U.S.-India  ] defense relationship is progressing rapidly , and defense sales could reach [MISC USD  ] 4 billion in 2011 . 
The [MISC U.S.-India  ] economic relationship , for decades practically nonexistent , has grown quickly and [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC India  ] have increased five-fold from [MISC USD  ] 3.6 billion in 2000 to [MISC USD  ] 17.7 billion last year . 
On climate change , the [LOC Copenhagen  ] conference marked a fundamental shift in [MISC India’s  ] position , and [LOC India  ] is beginning to understand it must address the climate issue not as a poor developing nation but rather as the major economy it has become . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) The [MISC Indians  ] understand our message about the importance of resuming a robust dialogue with [LOC Pakistan  ] and the necessity of increased [ORG GOI  ] communication to reassure [MISC Pakistani  ] officials about [MISC India’s  ] intentions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] has now offered to hold Foreign Secretary-level talks with [LOC Pakistan  ] , but has rejected [MISC Islamabad’s  ] attempts to condition resumption of discussion on picking up the thread from the [ORG Composite Dialogue India  ] paused after [LOC Mumbai.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) PM [PER Singh  ] is taking a calculated political risk in pushing forward with an offer of talks with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
While there is a general recognition that the policy of not engaging with [LOC Pakistan  ] except on counterterrorism issues has exhausted its usefulness , that does not necessarily translate into strong or consistent support for broad talks with [LOC Pakistan  ] among the political class , given continuing terrorist threats . 
There are heavyweights in the [ORG Congress  ] , including Finance Minister [PER Mukherjee  ] , who were not supportive after last year’s [LOC Sharm al Sheikh Joint Statement  ] fiasco , and they will seize on any missteps to argue against a policy that reaches out to the [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
This is also likely to be the last time for some time that PM [PER Singh  ] will have sufficient support to reach out to re-engage on dialogue . 
The PM took a beating after [LOC Sharm al Sheikh  ] and his government’s post-election honeymoon came to a crashing halt . 
If this renewed effort falters because of lack of interest on the part of the [MISC Pakistanis  ] , many could point to newly appointed [ORG NSA Shiv Shankar Menon  ] as the scapegoat . 
[PER Menon  ] was lambasted for his role as Foreign Secretary at [LOC Sharm  ] and will equally be identified with this proposal . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The reaction to the President’s December 1 [LOC West Point  ] speech announcing the way forward on [LOC Afghanistan  ] drew guardedly positive support from most of our interlocutors . 
While the President’s emphasis on development and agriculture assistance and a re-affirmation of [ORG USG  ] commitment to the region drew approval , many were apprehensive about the setting of July 2011 as a beginning date for the transfer of [LOC U.S.  ] troops out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC India’s  ] fears that its views and interests are not being taken into account has intensified lately: [LOC India  ] was kept out of the [LOC Istanbul  ] regional conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( based on a [MISC Pakistani  ] veto ) and [LOC New Delhi  ] was the odd man out at the [ORG London Conference  ] over reintegration. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [LOC India  ] is proud of its own ongoing “development partnership” with post-Taliban [LOC Afghanistan  ] that began in late 2001 , and the [ORG GOI  ] claims the sum of its performed and pledged assistance to date totals [MISC USD  ] 1.3 billion . 
Civilian aid is channeled into three main areas: infrastructure development ( centerpiece is a 218km road in [LOC Helmand  ] ) ; capacity building ( scholarships and civil service training in [LOC India  ] ) ; and humanitarian assistance ( daily food aid to 2 million [MISC Afghan  ] school children ) . 
Virtually all [ORG GOI  ] aid is administered through the [MISC Afghan  ] government or NGOs. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [MISC Indian  ] support for [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] government is long-standing and motivated by a variety of reasons , not the least being [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] strategic value as [LOC New Delhi  ] seeks regional influence . 
[LOC India  ] , with the exception of the [MISC Taliban  ] era , has always had strong ties to [LOC Afghanistan  ] since Partition ; conversely , [LOC Islamabad  ] with the exception of the [MISC Taliban  ] period , has had strained ties with [LOC Kabul  ] . 
Pakistan’s expectation that the government in [LOC Afghanistan  ] will be pro-Pakistan and anti-Indian is unrealistic , particularly given Karzai’s own long-standing ties to [LOC India  ] and the goodwill that [MISC India’s  ] assistance and other elements of [MISC India’s  ] soft power have created in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) While [MISC India’s  ] assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] has primarily focused on reconstruction and stabilization , there has also been limited military aid . 
The [ORG MEA  ] told us after the [LOC West Point  ] speech that the [ORG GOI  ] wishes to do more to help develop [MISC Afghan  ] capacity , especially with regard to the police and military , but is also cognizant of [ORG USG  ] “sensitivities” about such assistance . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Internal Politics:  ] a [ORG Raucous Democracy  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We have a true partner in the current [MISC Indian  ] government led by Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] , but its capabilities are not without limits . 
The strong performance by the [ORG Congress Party  ] and its [ORG United Progressive Alliance  ] ( [ORG UPA  ] ) allies in [MISC India’s  ] national elections in 2009 gave the Prime Minister [ORG Singh’s  ] coalition a mandate to govern and -- freed from dependence on half-hearted allies on the Left -- to promote a closer relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Despite the strong endorsement by the electorate and a floundering opposition , the [ORG UPA  ] government has gotten off the blocks somewhat slowly . 
The government grew less confident after its honeymoon period was cut short by the fallout over a joint statement from [ORG Singh’s  ] July 2009 Sharm-el-Sheikh meeting with [MISC Pakistani  ] Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] . 
The [LOC Sharm  ] debacle rallied [ORG Singh’s  ] otherwise disjointed political opponents , while reminding the Prime Minister of his constraints despite his mandate . 
The tentativeness of the government was again on display during the winter session of [ORG Parliament  ] , during which an unruly opposition united over populist causes and sidelined civil nuclear liability legislation and long-awaited financial sector liberalization . 
The government is again on the defensive over demands for the creation of a separate state of [LOC Telangana  ] from [LOC Andhra Pradesh  ] . 
On February 3 it bowed to political pressure and announced the formation of a five-person Committee to evaluate the issue . 
[ORG Civil Nuclear Cooperation  ] ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC India  ] viewed the signing of the [ORG U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement  ] as an historic event and an essential part of transforming our relationship . 
[LOC India  ] has since followed through on its nonproliferation commitments by signing its [ORG IAEA Safeguards Agreement  ] and concluding an Additional Protocol with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
We are working with the government to implement commercial cooperation , providing [LOC U.S.  ] firms access to an estimated [MISC USD  ] 150 billion market and leading to the creation of thousands of high-skilled jobs , as well as providing [MISC India’s  ] growing economy with access to clean energy . 
The [ORG Agreement  ] no longer dominates the headlines , but the goodwill it generated has contributed to our improved relationship across the board and to [MISC India’s  ] gradual movement toward the nonproliferation mainstream. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Indian  ] government made substantial progress on implementing commercial cooperation ahead of PM [ORG Singh’s  ] visit to [LOC Washington  ] , though some important hurdles remain . 
In recent months , [LOC India  ] announced two favorable reactor park sites for [LOC U.S.  ] firms in the states of [LOC Gujarat  ] and [LOC Andhra Pradesh  ] , and submitted its declaration of safeguarded facilities to the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
We have held five rounds of reprocessing consultations pursuant to the 123 [ORG Agreement  ] , and hope to conclude negotiations soon . 
The government responded to our request for Part 810 license assurances on the eve of [ORG Singh’s  ] visit , a top priority of [LOC U.S.  ] industry , and we await clarification on two issues . 
The cabinet approved draft liability legislation , a top priority for [LOC U.S.  ] firms , but [ORG Parliament  ] was not able to pass the legislation in the just-concluded session . 
The [ORG Defense Relationship  ] ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG U.S.-India  ] defense relationship has progressed rapidly since sanctions were removed in 2000 following [MISC India’s  ] 1998 nuclear test . 
Today’s relationship is focused on bilateral exercises , Subject Matter Expert Exchanges ( [ORG SMEEs  ] ) , and personal exchanges at schools , conferences and seminars . 
Billion-dollar defense sales are a growing component and a superb opportunity to expand the relationship . 
Exercises are the most visible of the activities between our two militaries . 
In October , the [ORG Army  ] completed its most ambitious exercise with the deployment of 17 Strykers to [LOC India  ] for a two week exercise which included live firing of a combined mechanized task force for the first time . 
Simultaneously , the [ORG Air Force  ] had five transport aircraft participating in exercise COPE [LOC INDIA  ] held in [LOC Agra  ] that included a Special Forces component . 
The [ORG Navy  ] conducts an annual exercise , [LOC Malabar  ] , that has been conducted both bilaterally and multilaterally . 
The [MISC Marines  ] hold an annual exercise with the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Army  ] , [ORG Shatrujeet  ] , which focuses on amphibious operations . 
The [MISC Indians  ] have been cooperating with the [ORG Joint POW/MIA Accountability Command  ] for recovery of remains from downed Second [MISC World War  ] planes in the politically sensitive state of [LOC Arunachal Pradesh  ] . 
To date , we are still working on obtaining permission to repatriate all of the remains so as to properly identify and recover lost [PER Airmen.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Defense  ] sales are growing quickly from roughly one billion [MISC USD  ] in 2008 , to over two billion so far this year . 
There is good potential for over four billion in sales next year , especially with the recent [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] approval to pursue the [MISC C-17  ] . 
For the first time , [LOC India  ] can afford ( politically and financially ) to purchase front line [LOC U.S.  ] equipment . 
They recognize the quality of [LOC U.S.  ] systems and have been astounded by the mission capable rates quoted for [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft compared to their older [MISC Russian  ] inventory . 
They are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their analysis of costs and now use life-cycle cost instead of cost on delivery for some purchases , giving [LOC U.S.  ] products an opportunity to beat cheaply made competitors . 
Most important , the July 2009 agreement on [MISC End Use Monitoring  ] ( [ORG EUM  ] ) has opened the door for FMS sales at a time when there is growing frustration with [LOC Russia  ] - previously [MISC India’s  ] supplier of choice . 
The near doubling in cost and extensive delays in delivery of the ex-Russian aircraft carrier [MISC GORSHKOV  ] , issues with transfer of technology on the [MISC T-90  ] tank , and universal problems with spare parts have convinced the [MISC GOI  ] that new sources of supply are needed to balance [LOC Russia  ] . 
Given an opportunity , we ask that you endorse [MISC Indian  ] purchases of [LOC U.S.  ] equipment as an important part of our defense relationship and support our ongoing sales efforts . 
Economic Ties ------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG U.S.-India  ] economic relationship , for decades practically nonexistent , has grown rapidly and has significant potential to expand further . 
At the same time , [LOC India  ] is an increasingly important player at the table in multilateral economic fora , from the [ORG WTO Doha Round  ] negotiations and the [MISC G-20  ] , [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG IMF  ] to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] negotiations in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
While [LOC India  ] was seen in the [LOC United States  ] as a spoiler when the [ORG World Trade Organization Doha Development  ] Agenda talks broke down in July 2008 , [MISC India’s  ] new Commerce Minister showed leadership and significantly improved the tone of discussions when he hosted a [ORG Doha  ] “Mini-ministerial” meeting in September , attended by [ORG U.S. Trade Representative  ] Kirk. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] is [MISC India’s  ] largest trading partner in goods and services and one of its largest foreign investors . 
Investment has surged between our countries in recent years , prompting agreement to launch negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty . 
[LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC India  ] has increased five-fold from [MISC USD  ] 3.6 billion in 2000 to [MISC USD  ] 17.7 billion last year . 
Two-way merchandise trade grew to a record [MISC USD  ] 44.4 billion in 2008 , a 76-percent increase from 2005 . 
Reflecting the global economic downturn , exports to [LOC India  ] fell 9.7 percent in January-September 2009 ( to [MISC USD  ] 8 billion ) , but [MISC Indian  ] exports to the [LOC United States  ] fell more sharply . 
Thus , the [LOC U.S.  ] trade deficit with [LOC India  ] fell 43.8 percent to just [MISC USD  ] 3.2 billion in January-September 2009 . 
Despite the size of its economy , [LOC India  ] was only the [LOC United States’  ] 18th largest trading partner in 2008 . 
One of the major goals of the [ORG U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum  ] is to resolve barriers to trade and investment to improve this ranking. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC India  ] was somewhat shielded from the global economic downturn due to its conservative central bank and [MISC SEC-equivalent  ] restricting many of the derivative innovations linked to the global financial crisis , and its relatively low reliance on exports . 
However , although [MISC India’s  ] “Wall [PER Street”  ] was less affected , its “Main [PER Street”  ] bore the brunt of the downturn , with slower growth , tighter access to credit , declining exports , higher unemployment , and less investment . 
In response , [MISC India’s  ] central bank and [MISC SEC-equivalent  ] relaxed many of its restrictions on foreign capital inflows and investment procedures and the [MISC GOI  ] enacted several fiscal stimulus programs , both pre- and post-election , to boost economic growth. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Indian  ] economy continues to be one of fastest growing economies in the world , even as the global slowdown and financial crunch moderated GDP growth from nine percent in fiscal year ( [ORG FY  ] ) 2007-08 to 6.7 percent in [ORG FY  ] 2008-09 , which ended March 31 . 
Growth in the second quarter was 7.9 percent and growth in fiscal year 2009-10 is now expected to be in the seven percent range . 
The [ORG Commerce Ministry  ] announced December 15 that it expects to see a return to positive export growth soon . 
With the expected return of higher growth rates , rising inflation , and the highest fiscal deficit ( approximately 11 percent of GDP ) in 20 years , the [MISC GOI  ] has begun to reverse some the measures it enacted during the financial crisis and has announced plans to decrease subsidies and increase disinvestment . 
Lagging agricultural productivity and poor -- but improving -- infrastructure continue to constrain growth . 
Accordingly , the top [MISC Indian  ] economic priorities remain physical and human infrastructure development and spreading economic benefits into rural [LOC India.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] continues to have concerns about agricultural trade with [LOC India  ] . 
The recently released [ORG Senate Finance Committee Report  ] on [MISC Indian  ] agricultural trade barriers -- a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG ITC  ] investigation -- highlighted the essentially defensive agricultural trade policy long promoted by the [MISC Indian  ] government . 
The [LOC United States  ] is particularly interested in gaining marketing access for [LOC U.S.  ] dairy products which are blocked due to a series of non-scientific [MISC GOI  ] rules . 
Discussions are ongoing , but the effort to resolve long-standing agricultural trade issues is a Mission priority . 
Climate Change/Clean Energy --------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The 16th [ORG Conference of Parties  ] ( [LOC COP-16  ] ) at [LOC Copenhagen  ] marked a fundamental shift in [MISC India’s  ] climate change position . 
Minister of [ORG Environment and Forests  ] [PER Jairam Ramesh  ] claimed victory for [MISC India’s  ] negotiating team in a December 22 address to parliament stating [LOC India  ] was “entirely successful” at [MISC COP-16  ] in that there was no dilution of either the [ORG Bali Action Plan  ] or the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] , [LOC India  ] was not required to agree on a peak year for its emissions , and that it avoided any legally binding emission commitments , including a long-term global goal of reducing emissions 50 percent by 2050 . 
Although [MISC India’s  ] current position is that the [LOC Kyoto Protocol  ] and [ORG Bali Action Plan  ] are sacrosanct and must be the basis for all future climate negotiations , both [PER Ramesh  ] and Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] have publicly supported the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [ORG Accord  ] pursuant to the [ORG Accord  ] , [LOC India  ] communicated its domestic mitigation action of reducing it’s carbon intensity by 20 to 25 percent by 2020 from a 2005 baseline to the [ORG UNFCCC Secretariat  ] on January 30 . 
In addition , [PER Ramesh  ] has drawn [LOC India  ] farther from the G77 by telling parliament [LOC India  ] was not in the same category as other developing countries such as [LOC Bangladesh  ] , [LOC Maldives  ] , [LOC Grenada  ] , or [MISC African  ] nations , that it did not need to demand technology transfer at low or no cost , and that [LOC India  ] should be selling green technology to the world . 
[MISC India’s  ] association and close coordination of its climate negotiating position with the [ORG Basic Group of nations  ] , comprised of [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC China  ] , indicates [LOC India  ] is beginning to understand it must address the climate issue not as a poor developing nation but rather as the major economy it has become. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the November visit of the Prime Minister , Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and her [MISC Idian  ] counterpart signed an [ORG MOU  ] to [ORG Enhance Cooperation on Energy Security  ] , [ORG Energy Efficiency  ] , [ORG Clean Energy  ] and Climate Change . 
Both countries share an interest in rapid expansion of clean and renewable energy production . 
[LOC India  ] has massive investments planned in energy production , both conventional and renewable , as the government recognizes the need to continue to power [MISC India’s  ] economic growth and extend access to electricity to ever more of the significant portion of the population which still does not have it . 
The bilateral [ORG MOU  ] calls for stepped up engagement beyond the existing Energy Dialogues to include a focused [ORG Clean Energy Research  ] and [ORG Deployment Initiative  ] to rapidly disseminate clean energy technologies , including solar , wind , hydro , as well as shale gas and cleaner coal . 
The USG is holding ongoing inter-agency consultations and is finalizing recommendations for the organization of these new initiatives . 
DOE has the lead on a [ORG Joint Clean Energy Research Center  ] , while USAID is heading a multi-agency team to create the [ORG Clean Energy Deployment Center  ] in coordination with State , [ORG Commerce  ] , [ORG OPIC  ] , [ORG EXIM  ] , [ORG USTDA  ] and others . 
Completed designs for the centers are expected by early spring . 
We expect that they will accelerate existing initiatives as well as launch numerous others in order to have broad impact in building the [MISC Indian  ] clean energy market .
