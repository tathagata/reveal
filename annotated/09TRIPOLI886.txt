REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [MISC Libyan  ] government warmly greeted the [ORG Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation 's Office of Cooperative Threat Reduction  ] ( [PER ISN/CTR  ] ) , team leader [PER Kathryn Insley  ] and program manager [PER D.A. Brown  ] , on [PER ISN/CTR  ] 's first official trip to [LOC Libya  ] since November 2008 . 
This visit was a critical step in re-establishing a strong rapport between [PER ISN/CTR  ] staff and their [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutors , and lead GOL contact Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] indicated that previous visa problems that had plagued the project had been " solved . 
" [PER ISN/CTR  ] held meetings with officials of the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) to discuss the [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] ( [ORG NMC  ] ) and next steps for developing the [LOC Architectural  ] and Engineering ( A&E ) design and model for the [ORG NMC  ] . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] Government agreed to move ahead on this project on a cost-sharing basis , a reversal of the [MISC Libyans'  ] previous position . 
[ORG TMC  ] management also reported rooms had been allocated to establish a [ORG Telemedicine Center  ] , linking [MISC Libyan  ] specialists to their counterparts overseas , and the next step would be to install equipment with the help of experts from [ORG Harvard  ] 's [ORG Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology  ] . 
[PER ISN/CTR  ] toured the desalination pilot project site at [ORG Tajura Nuclear Research Center  ] ( [ORG TNRC  ] ) where equipment will be installed by engineers from [ORG Sandia National Laboratory  ] . 
The Director of [ORG TNRC  ] pledged to provide a list to [PER ISN/CTR  ] of current issues and requests for future engagement under the [ORG Sister Laboratory/Stack Monitoring Project  ] . 
[PER Insley  ] and [PER Brown  ] also held meetings at the [MISC Italian  ] Embassy to explore possible collaboration in scientist engagement . 
End summary . 
WHO'S WHO ? 
OUR MAIN INTERLOCUTORS ON NUCLEAR AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY ISSUES <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] 's primary [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutor on all nuclear and alternative energy issues with a strictly research component is Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , Director of the [ORG Libyan Atomic Energy Establishment  ] ( [ORG LAEE  ] ) . 
As outlined in Ref A , [PER Gashut  ] reports directly to Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi . 
The [ORG LAEE  ] includes three operational/research divisions: the [ORG TNRC  ] ( previously known as the [ORG Renewable Energies  ] and [ORG Water Desalination Research Center  ] --REWDRC-- and [ORG Nuclear Research Center  ] ) headed by Engineer [PER Ahmed al-Habrush  ] , whose deputy is [PER El Mahdi Ghallab  ] ; the [ORG Alternative Energy Research Center  ] , headed by Dr. [PER Salem Ghurbal  ] ; and Chemical Engineering ( including the [ORG Petrochemical Institute  ] ) , headed by Dr. [PER Husein Mansour  ] . 
As for [PER Ghurbal  ] , he is reportedly not well , perhaps suffering from diabetes , and his deputy , Dr. [PER Mohammed Mussa  ] , may take on a greater role in managing the [ORG Alternative Energy Research Center  ] in the future . 
One of [PER ISN/CTR  ] 's main projects , the [ORG Desalination Pilot Project  ] , falls under the [ORG Desalination  ] and [ORG Water Treatment Research Department  ] , headed by Dr. [PER Abdulnaser Ali Alsadawi  ] , who reports to al-Habrush . 
Another familiar face in [MISC Libyan  ] scientific circles is Dr. [PER Mohammed Ennami  ] , who is [PER Gashut  ] 's deputy , and who was formerly science advisor to the now-Secretary for Infrastructure [PER Matuq Matuq  ] ( after the latter 's previous General People 's [ORG Committee for Manpower  ] was dissolved in March in the government reconfiguration--see Ref B ) . 
While [PER Ennami  ] is now technically [PER Gashut  ] 's subordinate , due to his close connections to [PER Matuq  ] , a regime insider , we can surmise he may wield more power than [PER Gashut  ] in a de facto sense . 
Meanwhile , the staff at the [ORG TMC  ] is [PER ISN/CTR  ] 's primary interlocutor in the development of the [ORG NMC  ] . 
In particular , Dr. [PER Omran Shammam  ] ( educated at [ORG Ohio State University  ] ) has been steadfast in his support and commitment to this project . 
Dr. [PER Omran Assatel  ] ( PhD in [LOC Physics  ] , [ORG Oregon State University  ] ) is also key to the [ORG NMC  ] project . 
Both participated directly in this visit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On October 19 , in a one-on-one meeting with [PER ISN/CTR  ] , [PER Gashut  ] reiterated the need for all initial communication between the [LOC U.S.  ] side and the [MISC Libyans  ] to go through him . 
He said , " otherwise , things get too confusing , " especially when it comes to arranging visits and tracking visa approvals through the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy . 
But , [PER Gashut  ] said the visa problem was " solved now . 
" [PER ISN/CTR  ] pressed for more clarity on the visa issue , and [PER Gashut  ] implied that he now has a system in place whereby he can communicate directly with [MISC Libyan  ] protocol on visa issuance . 
MOVING FORWARD ON THE REGIONAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE CENTER <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gashut  ] accepted moving ahead on the [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] ( [ORG NMC  ] ) on a bilateral partnership basis ( i.e. cost-sharing ) , in an apparent reversal of his previous stance that [PER ISN/CTR  ] commit to fully funding construction of the [ORG NMC  ] , [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000886 002.2 OF 004 He agreed to provide a quick-turnaround written concurrence similar to a letter provided by [PER ISN/CTR  ] , which will then pave the way for [PER ISN/CTR  ] 's development of the [ORG NMC  ] A&E Design . 
In an October 18 meeting with [PER ISN/CTR  ] , Dr. [PER Omran Shammam  ] offered comments on the draft strategic plan for the [ORG NMC  ] , several of which were resolved during the meeting . 
[PER Shammam  ] would like to meet again with the strategic plan development experts from [LOC Harvard/Massachusetts General Hospital  ] concerning the issue of average examination times but overall , he approved the draft strategic plan without further comment . 
[PER ISN/CTR  ] will follow-up with Dr. [PER Giles Boland  ] ( Harvard/Mass General ) to schedule a visit to [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Shammam  ] also indicated that a site had been selected for the [ORG NMC  ] . 
The site is 10,000 square meters in size , located near the [ORG Tripoli International Airport  ] , and will therefore be accessible to travelers from outside of [LOC Tripoli  ] as well as from neighboring countries . 
[PER Shammam  ] offered to show the site to [PER ISN/CTR  ] during a future visit . 
[PER Shammam  ] emphasized [LOC Libya  ] 's desire for all staff in the proposed [ORG NMC  ] to be trained in the [LOC U.S.  ] or by [MISC Americans  ] . 
In addition , [PER Gashut  ] noted the [ORG NMC  ] would be more than just a building , but a model of [MISC American  ] excellence equipped to the highest [MISC American  ] standards . 
He underscored the need to enforce [LOC U.S.  ] labor standards , such as punctuality , clear reporting systems , and accountability -- values which , according to [PER Gashut  ] , are abundantly lacking in the current [MISC Libyan  ] healthcare system. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to the [ORG NMC  ] , [PER ISN/CTR  ] is working with [ORG TMC  ] to establish a [ORG Telemedicine Center  ] that will enable specialists in [LOC Libya  ] to consult with their counterparts in the [LOC U.S.  ] and other countries around the world . 
[PER Shammam  ] reported that rooms have been allocated at the [ORG TMC  ] for the [ORG Telemedicine Center  ] , equipment has been approved for the project , and [MISC Shamman  ] is now ready for experts from [ORG Harvard  ] 's [ORG Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology  ] ( [ORG CIMIT  ] ) , funded through [PER ISN/CTR  ] , to begin installation . 
In terms of more general training needs , [PER Shammam  ] asked for an oncologist and radiotherapist to visit [LOC Libya  ] in order to conduct training . 
During the course of discussions on the [ORG NMC  ] , [PER Shammam  ] also provided a tour of [ORG TMC  ] 's new diagnostic wing which , according to [PER Shammam  ] , had been built in under one year and , along with several other diagnostic rooms , currently houses a state-of-the-art Cyclotron which synthesizes the [MISC Fluorine-18  ] isotope to make fluordeoxyglucose for use in a [MISC Positron Emission  ] Tomography ( [ORG PET-CT  ] ) medical imaging device . 
According to [MISC Shamman  ] , [ORG TMC  ] 's [ORG PET-CT  ] , which is equipped with an array of mood , lighting , scenery and music selections to help patients relax during treatment , is only the second of its kind in use worldwide . 
The new wing measures 1,200 square meters and cost 32 million dinars ( approximately $26 million dollars ) to construct , of which half was spent on new equipment . 
When pressed for further details on the budget , [PER Shammam  ] said it was simply a line item that appeared in [ORG TMC  ] 's budget , and [ORG TMC  ] was directed to spend it on this new wing . 
A [MISC Libyan  ] construction firm , [ORG al-Akaria Construction Company  ] , was selected to build the wing , and an [MISC Italian  ] sub-contractor , [ORG Prisma  ] , carried out the specialized medical construction . 
According to [PER Shammam  ] , the new wing does not yet have dedicated staff . 
He indicated there is a lack of trained technicians and also expressed interest in additional training from the [LOC U.S.  ] side . 
EQUIPMENT IN PLACE FOR DESALINATION PILOT PROJECT <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On October 19 , [PER ISN/CTR  ] met Dr. [PER Abdulnaser Ali Alsadawi  ] , the Head of the [ORG Desalination and Water Treatment Research Department  ] at [ORG TNRC  ] . 
They discussed the [ORG Desalination Pilot Project  ] , under which experts from [ORG Sandia National Laboratory  ] ( [ORG SNL  ] ) will work with their [MISC Libyan  ] counterparts to install desalination equipment at the pilot facility in [LOC Tajura  ] . 
[PER Alsadawi  ] took them on a tour of the pilot project site , which is next to the holding tanks for an existing desalination plant ( which provides potable water to [ORG TNRC  ] ) . 
The equipment for the pilot project is housed in three special shipping containers that are on a raised platform . 
[PER Alsadawi  ] said some modifications to the platform were needed and these would be completed in the next two weeks . 
Ideally , two experts from [ORG SNL  ] will travel to [LOC Libya  ] in early November to begin connecting the equipment , pending visa issuance . 
[ Note: In a separate meeting , [PER Gashut  ] pledged to assist with visa approvals for a two week visit by the [ORG SNL  ] experts and [PER DA Brown  ] , the [ORG ISN/CTR  ] [LOC Libya  ] program manager . 
End note . 
] [PER Alsadawi  ] also gave [PER ISN/CTR  ] a tour of the laboratory space at [ORG TNRC  ] which will be used as a water quality laboratory to support the desalination pilot project . 
All the equipment for the new water quality laboratory is still in boxes , but it appears that all equipment has arrived . 
Perishable reagents appear to be appropriately stored in refrigerators . 
[PER Alsadawi  ] [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000886 003.2 OF 004 noted that one of the incubators that had been unpacked was missing components and essentially , was unusable . 
[ Note: Shipments to [LOC Libya  ] of technical equipment , chemicals , and reagents have been plagued with delays and difficult to confirm . 
[PER Alsadawi  ] stated that [MISC Libyan  ] customs officials are not extremely cooperative with [ORG TNRC  ] . 
According to [PER Alsadawi  ] , storage space is very limited at the port and stringent rules apply unilaterally to all shipments , including a requirement to auction all shipments that have not cleared customs within ninety days . 
[PER Alsadawi  ] said that [ORG TNRC  ] had to request very high-level intervention to get a recent equipment shipment released after it had been listed for auction . 
End note . 
] [ORG SISTER LABORATORY/STACK MONITORING ACTIVITIES  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In 2005 , the [ORG International Nuclear Safeguards and Engagement Program  ] ( [ORG INSEP  ] ) signed a " [ORG Sister Laboratory  ] " Arrangement with the former [ORG National Board of Research and Development  ] ( [ORG NBRD  ] ) , which is now [ORG TNRC  ] . 
Under this arrangement , [ORG INSEP  ] initiated five [PER Action Sheets  ] , of which three are nearly complete , and further visits are needed to close out or restart those that have stalled . 
Current plans call for a visit to pursue: [ORG Action Sheet  ] 4 - [ORG Stack Monitoring System  ] , [ORG Action Sheet  ] 2 - [ORG Radiation Protection Train-the-trainer  ] capability , [ORG Action Sheet  ] 5 - Radioactive Waste Tracking Database , and [ORG Action Sheet  ] 1 - [ORG Cleanroom Assistance  ] . 
[ Note: A team from [ORG NNSA  ] was due to visit [LOC Tripoli  ] in mid-June but has not received visas . 
End note . 
] The head of [ORG TNRC  ] , al-Habrush , said he would send a letter to [PER ISN/CTR  ] , via [PER Gashut  ] , providing a list of current issues and requests for future engagement on the [ORG Sister Lab  ] program . 
His deputy , [PER Ghallab  ] , commented that there had been " good momentum " on the [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] science program but that about a year ago , " everything stopped . 
" When [PER ISN/CTR  ] pointed out that several [LOC U.S.  ] visitors had tried to come to [LOC Libya  ] , but they did not receive visas ( until this visit ) , al-Habrush acknowledged that there had been " some sort of problem with visas , " but was unaware of the three prior [PER ISN/CTR  ] attempts to obtain visas . 
He noted that , " I , myself , was supposed to go to the [ORG United Nations  ] in [LOC New York  ] , but never got a visa " last April . 
WATER RESOURCES MODELING <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Under a program with [ORG Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  ] ( [ORG LLNL  ] ) , [LOC U.S.  ] experts will train [MISC Libyans  ] in how to use a specialized software program to run various scenarios for water resource management . 
[PER Gashut  ] asked [PER ISN/CTR  ] for more information about the data necessary from the [ORG Great Manmade River Project  ] to implement the water quality monitoring and modeling program . 
He also had questions on the nondisclosure agreement ( [ORG NDA  ] ) required by [ORG LLNL  ] in order to safeguard intellectual property rights . 
[PER ISN/CTR  ] said they would follow-up with [ORG LLNL  ] in order to clarify their needs for real data and to discuss their plans to return to [LOC Libya  ] to demonstrate the model . 
Issues concerning the [ORG NDA  ] will also need to be resolved . 
[ Note: In an October 22 meeting , [PER Omar Salem  ] , Chairman of the [MISC Libyan  ] General Water Authority , told Econoff that [PER Gashut  ] had written to him to say that the [LOC U.S.  ] experts would return to [LOC Libya  ] once the data needs were clarified . 
[PER Salem  ] looked forward to the training , which will involve [MISC Libyan  ] specialists from his organization . 
End note . 
] [ORG VIRTUAL SCIENCE LIBRARY  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) When asked about the status of the proposed [ORG Virtual Science Library  ] , [PER Gashut  ] said he had followed up on his discussions on this project during his April meeting with [PER ISN/CTR  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , by passing the proposal to the General People 's [ORG Committee for Education ( Ministry of Education-equivalent  ] ) . 
He promised to update [PER ISN/CTR  ] as soon as he received a reply from the [ORG Education  ] officials . 
VIEWPOINT OF THE [MISC ITALIAN  ] EMBASSY <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER ISN/CTR  ] met with xxxxxxxxxxxx at the [MISC Italian Embassy  ] to explore possible collaboration in [LOC Libya  ] , following the example of [LOC Iraq  ] , where the [MISC Italians  ] are working with us on scientist engagement projects. xxxxxxxxxxxx said that [LOC Italy  ] had not been involved in the nuclear scientist redirection efforts in [LOC Libya  ] but was working with them on converting the former biological weapons factory to a pharmaceutical plant . 
The plan is for the pharmaceutical plant to produce medicines for treating [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] for export to [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
He noted the [MISC Libyans  ] did not seem very concerned with meeting this goal , but instead thought [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000886 004.2 OF 004 [LOC Italy  ] and other countries should be pleased that at least the factory was not being used for its former purpose ( developing biological weapons ) . 
Ensuring [LOC Libya  ] lives up to its commitments to destroy the stockpiles of chemical weapons is another concern of [LOC Italy  ] , particularly given [LOC Libya  ] 's geographic proximity . 
In xxxxxxxxxxxx 's view , the [MISC Libyans  ] are stalling on the destruction of the stockpiles in order to keep this " as a bargaining chip " ( Refs F , G ) . 
More broadly , in terms of the medical system in [LOC Libya  ] , xxxxxxxxxxxx noted around 200 [MISC Libyan  ] doctors have been trained in [LOC Italy  ] , and they had established a good network between the [MISC Libyan  ] and [MISC Italian  ] medical schools . 
He thought this might be a good resource for [MISC U.S.-based  ] medical trainers to tap into . 
11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: As the success of many of our programs in [LOC Libya  ] hinges on personal relationships , this recent visit was a critical step in establishing a strong rapport between [PER ISN/CTR  ] staff and their [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutors . 
Our main point of contact for [MISC Libyan  ] scientist engagement , Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , made a real effort to welcome [PER Kate Insley  ] and [PER DA Brown  ] , as evidenced by his participation in their meetings . 
He also personally invited them to a traditional [MISC Libyan  ] dinner and even brought along his teenage son , transparently underscoring the importance of cultivating interpersonal relationships in [MISC Libyan  ] cultural context . 
It is also important to note that [LOC Libya  ] is a relatively small country ( population around 6 million ) , and the cadre of [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC US-trained  ] scientists is also small . 
Most of [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC US-trained  ] scientists were educated in the [LOC U.S.  ] before sanctions , and as they are now in their 50 's and 60 's and will retire soon , we only have about 5-10 years more to pursue joint projects with this group of people . 
Due to [LOC Libya  ] 's isolation during the past few decades as well as a previous ban on teaching [MISC English  ] , the current generation of young professionals has had little exposure to [MISC Western  ] work-styles and has limited facility in [MISC English  ] language . 
The [PER ISN/CTR  ] programs present an excellent opportunity to address this generation gap .
