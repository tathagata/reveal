REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Implementation of a key component of the [MISC Italian-Libyan  ] " friendship agreement " has begun , as [LOC Italy  ] has returned approximately 500 migrants rescued and interdicted at sea to [LOC Libya  ] over the past week . 
[MISC Libyan  ] authorities have notified the local offices of [ORG IOM  ] and [ORG UNHCR  ] before returning boats arrive in [LOC Tripoli  ] to facilitate medical screening , identification , and consular notification . 
The returnees are then placed in immigrant detention centers . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] has interviewed a number of the detained returnees , noting that only " a handful " of the 500 are likely asylum seekers - mostly of [MISC Somali  ] and [MISC Eritrean  ] origin ; the rest are economic migrants . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is expected to accept delivery of six [MISC Italian  ] patrol vessels this week , and to start patrolling [LOC Libya  ] 's coast with a joint [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] crew and command in June . 
One [MISC Italian  ] diplomat said he hoped the [MISC Libyan  ] cooperation would continue , but suspected that it was linked to [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's planned mid-June visit to [LOC Rome  ] . 
End Summary . 
[LOC ITALY  ] TURNS BACK OVER 500 MIGRANTS INTERDICTED AT SEA 2 . 
( C ) [LOC Libya  ] has accepted the return of three tranches of migrants interdicted or rescued at sea by [MISC Italian  ] authorities in recent days , beginning implementation of a key component of the [MISC Italian-Libyan  ] " friendship agreement " signed last August aimed at reducing the flow of migrants from [LOC Libya  ] to [LOC Italy  ] . 
In each case , the [MISC Italians  ] contacted the [MISC Libyan  ] navy , which agreed to accept their return to [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] navy did not/not agree to take the migrants on [MISC Libyan  ] vessels ; rather , in one case , it instructed [MISC Italian  ] energy company [ORG ENI  ] , which operates an offshore platform in the area , to tow an [MISC African  ] vessel to shore ; in the other cases , it permitted the [MISC Italian  ] navy to transport the migrants back to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Once in [LOC Tripoli  ] , according to the [MISC Italian  ] Embassy , the migrants were processed in an orderly fashion and sent to a detention center . 
3 . 
( C ) The first group of 227 returnees arrived in [LOC Tripoli  ] on May 7 . 
A regional [ORG IOM  ] team in [LOC Tripoli  ] implementing a G/TIP-funded workshop to enhance [LOC Libya  ] 's response to human smuggling and trafficking was on hand to help screen the arrivals and visit one of the three detention centers where the migrants were held . 
The trainers described conditions in the centers as overcrowded , but noted that [ORG IOM  ] 's [MISC Libyan  ] partner - the [ORG International Organization for Peace  ] , Care , and Relief ( IOPCR ) - was providing humanitarian assistance similar to that given during a recent high-profile loss of over 200 migrants in late March ( ref A ) . 
[ORG IOM  ] is assisting the [ORG GOL  ] obtain treatment for some returnees suffering from dehydration and scabies and has asked for financial support to ensure continued care . 
Another boat carrying 163 arrived on May 10 . 
[ORG IOM  ] reported that a third ship arrived on May 9 and that [ORG IOM  ] is receiving notice from the [ORG GOL  ] before the ships arrive so that [ORG IOM  ] staff can monitor the disembarkation . 
A " HANDFUL " OF MIGRANTS ARE LIKELY ASYLUM SEEKERS 4 . 
( C ) [ORG IOM  ] staff here characterized the recent returnees as " the usual suspects " of [MISC Nigerian  ] , [MISC Nigerien  ] , [MISC Ghanaian  ] , and [MISC South Asian  ] nationality . 
The [ORG UNHCR  ] mission reportedly interviewed many of the returnees and found fewer than 10 migrants who were likely asylum seekers including " four or five " [MISC Somalis  ] and " a handful " of [MISC Eritreans  ] . 
JOINT PATROLS TO BEGIN THIS WEEK BUT ENFORCEMENT MAY BE SHORT-LIVED 5 . 
( C ) Shortly after [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Italy  ] exchanged instruments of ratification of the friendship and cooperation treaty in March 2009 , [MISC Italian  ] embassy contacts told us that 43 [MISC Libyans  ] had applied for visas to collect six patrol vessels from [LOC Italy  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is expected to accept delivery of the [MISC Italian  ] vessels this week , and to start patroling [LOC Libya  ] 's coast with a joint [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] crew and command in June . 
According to the [MISC Italian  ] Embassy , there will be 15 [MISC Italian  ] naval personnel stationed in [LOC Libya  ] for this purpose . 
One [MISC Italian  ] diplomat said he hoped the [MISC Libyan  ] cooperation on halting illegal migration to [LOC Italy  ] would continue , but suspected that it was a gesture to curry favor in [LOC Rome  ] prior to [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's planned mid-June visit to meet PM [PER Berlusconi  ] . 
6 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Post  ] does not have direct access to immigrant detention centers . 
Over the past year , contacts have described the facilities as ranging from " poor and crowded " to " acceptable " and both [ORG IOM  ] and [ORG UNHCR  ] have said conditions have improved over the past 12 months . 
Both organizations have regular access to the facilities , but limited capacity to provide care . 
Conditions will likely become worse if similar numbers of migrants crowd facilities . 
The [ORG GOL  ] currently keeps [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000391 002.2 OF 002 family and national groups together - in part to facilitate mass deportation by charter plane to [LOC West Africa  ] . 
In the March tragedy , of the 21 rescued from the sea , all [MISC Arabs  ] were deported and the [ORG GOL  ] facilitated consular access for the [MISC Africans  ] whose countries had representation in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Others were integrated into the general population of immigration detainees , and the [ORG GOL  ] 's record-keeping shortcomings make it difficult for organizations to track these migrants .
