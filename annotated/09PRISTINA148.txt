Kaidanow  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: On April 6 the [ORG European Union’s  ] rule-of-law mission in [LOC Kosovo  ] , [ORG EULEX  ] , declared full operational capability ( [ORG FOC  ] ) . 
Four months after its initiation , [ORG EULEX  ] can claim some significant successes , including a complete and violence-free roll-out of the police component ; the reopening of the problematic [LOC Mitrovica  ] courthouse and hearing of a case , the first since violence closed the court on March 17 , 2008 ; and establishing its customs presence at border crossing points [ORG Gates  ] 1 and 31 with [LOC Serbia  ] . 
However , the [ORG EULEX  ] police component’s low profile and its limited executive authority , the absence of control over its judges , and [ORG EULEX  ] unwillingness -- or inability -- to clarify the question of applicable law continue to dog the rule of law mission’s ability to do its job effectively . 
All of these problems are compounded in the [MISC Serb-majority  ] north , where [ORG EULEX  ] has yet to reinforce its authority with the local populace . 
Success also requires that [LOC Serbia  ] play a constructive role in dealing with [ORG EULEX  ] on a technical level to solve practical problems while keeping the [ORG UN  ] firmly outside the process -- an outcome we wish [LOC Brussels  ] would underscore with [LOC Belgrade  ] in a far more decisive manner . 
END SUMMARY POLICE <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG EULEX’s Police  ] component , with 1654 total staff ( international and national ) , comprises by far the largest share of [ORG EULEX’s  ] 2507 person presence in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[ORG EULEX Police  ] enjoyed some success when the Formed [MISC Police Units  ] ( FPUs or specialized riot police ) responded to tense situations in January and March in the divided flashpoint city of [LOC Mitrovica  ] . 
However , the [ORG EULEX Police  ] component has remained largely invisible in day-to-day operations . 
This is largely due to a different mandate that [ORG EULEX  ] sees for its police officers compared to how [ORG UNMIK Police  ] operated . 
Where [ORG UNMIK Police  ] possessed wide-ranging executive authority and were visible to the public throughout the country , [ORG EULEX Police  ] focus primarily on monitoring , mentoring , and advising ( [ORG MMA  ] ) . 
[ORG EULEX  ] headquarters tells us that this [ORG MMA  ] role necessitates that its officers work most closely with the [ORG Kosovo Police  ] on management functions , and this work requires primary staffing at the station level. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC American  ] officers assigned to the Police component have expressed some frustration regarding this hands-off approach and the absence of executive authority when operating in the field . 
Officers in the [ORG Strengthening Department  ] operating in [LOC Mitrovica  ] and at border gates , for example , have no executive authority to enforce laws or make arrests for visible criminal violations committed in their presence . 
They can only perform their [ORG MMA  ] activities , and acting outside of this mandate could expose individual officers to disciplinary action -- for example , responding with force to an agitated and threatening individual at a border crossing -- for exerting unlawful executive authority . 
As a result , [ORG EULEX  ] refuses to deploy officers from the [ORG Strengthening Department  ] to situations where they might be compelled to act in self-defense -- the very situations where an international presence would be most beneficial. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As an example , March protests over power cuts in the eastern [MISC Serb  ] enclave of [LOC Silovo/Shilovo  ] ( Gjilane/Gnjilane municipality ) initially saw no [ORG EULEX  ] police officers respond due to their absence of executive authority . 
[LOC U.S.  ] officers assigned to work with [ORG Kosovo Police  ] ( [ORG KP  ] ) officers in station-level management positions in the region convinced [ORG KP  ] commanders to visit the scene , thus creating a rationale for the [LOC U.S.  ] officers to monitor the commanders’ performance in the field . 
At the same time , these officers exposed themselves to personal jeopardy by leaving what [ORG EULEX  ] calls their primary workplace , the police station. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As it stands now , there is a large gap in [MISC EULEX’s  ] police activity . 
The [ORG Special Police Department  ] provides in extremis crowd control and riot suppression and currently [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000148 002 OF 005 deploys the bulk of its 455 [ORG FPU  ] officers in the [LOC Mitrovica  ] region . 
The [ORG Strengthening Department  ] assigns officers to monitor , mentor , and advise at the station-level across the country . 
However , due to its lack of executive authority , [ORG EULEX  ] has little role to play in emerging situations not yet requiring an [ORG FPU  ] response -- situations that might benefit from the presence of international police officers whom local residents may regard as more objective and professional than [ORG KP  ] officers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG EULEX Police’s Executive Police Department  ] ( [ORG EPD  ] ) does possess authority to conduct investigations into organized crime cases and incidents where political interference undermines the rule of law , but [ORG EULEX  ] tells us that this activity is limited due to insufficient equipment . 
Without surveillance or wiretap equipment , [ORG EPD  ] officers cannot conduct effective investigations . 
[ORG JUSTICE  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG EULEX Justice  ] component enjoys some success in the solid mentoring relationship it has developed with [LOC Kosovo  ] judges and prosecutors . 
Feedback has been positive and cooperation with USG programs in these areas has been very good . 
Cooperation with [ORG EULEX Justice  ] at the headquarters level has also been good , and weekly meetings , which include other international stakeholders including the [ORG International Civilian Office  ] ( [ORG ICO  ] ) and the [ORG European Commission  ] ( [ORG EC  ] ) , have helped ensure a tighter , more unified message on the range of legal issues . 
Significantly , [ORG EULEX  ] has occupied the [LOC Mitrovica  ] court house and has begun prosecuting cases . 
Though [MISC Serbs  ] in north [LOC Mitrovica  ] initially protested [ORG EULEX’s  ] presence , seeing the organization as a tool of the [LOC Kosovo  ] government and independence , [ORG EULEX  ] was able to conduct a prosecution against two [MISC Serb  ] defendants in March that resulted in acquittal on charges of felony robbery . 
But continued confusion within [ORG EULEX  ] on applicable law has detracted from the success of this proceeding . 
The judges chose to apply [ORG UNMIK  ] law , arguing that the offenses occurred while [LOC Kosovo  ] was under [ORG UNMIK  ] jurisdiction . 
EULEXXXXXXXXXXXXX failed to clarify the question of applicable law with both the judges and the GOK prior to beginning the case . 
We expect the court to issue a written judgment on or about April 10 , which could prompt an unhappy response from [LOC Kosovo  ] leaders and media ( a point we have made repeatedly to [ORG EULEX  ] top officials ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] It’s also apparent that the rigidity of [ORG EULEX’s  ] prosecutorial structure , with international prosecutors assigned to specific courts or prosecutor’s offices and case transfers among prosecutors necessary when a case moves to another court or jurisdiction , hampers quick and effective action . 
[ORG CUSTOMS  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG EULEX Customs  ] component has developed a strong mentoring , monitoring , and advising role with the [ORG Kosovo Customs Service  ] and has gradually increased its activities since [ORG EULEX  ] initiated operations on December 9 , 2008 . 
Coordination between [ORG Customs Head of Component  ] [PER Paul Acda  ] and [ORG Kosovo Customs  ] Director [PER Naim Huruglica  ] , stemming from their previous cooperation under [ORG UNMIK  ] , is especially strong and transparent. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Eight [ORG EULEX Customs  ] staff are working at the [ORG Kosovo Customs Service  ] headquarters , including the [ORG Customs Head of Component  ] , his deputy , two media relations personnel , and four expert advisors working directly with relevant [ORG Kosovo Customs  ] departments in revenue operations , law enforcement , legal , and finance and administration . 
[ORG EULEX Customs  ] also has 18 personnel working as mobile customs units ( six teams of three people ) , plus one team coordinator , monitoring all customs border posts . 
The mobile units group is based at a separate [ORG Kosovo Customs  ] building located in [LOC Fushe Kosove/Kosovo  ] Polje , just outside of [LOC Pristina  ] . 
These units are fully staffed but are experiencing some equipment shortages , including phones , radios , cameras , GPS equipment , etc. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG EULEX Customs Reinforcement Task Force  ] has a staff of 22 internationals out of a planned 33 , with no local staff deployed to date . 
This group first operated on a 9-to-5 basis in northern [LOC Kosovo  ] in December 2008 , and commenced 24/7 operations in mid-January 2009 . 
On February 1 , 2009 , [ORG EULEX Customs  ] officials began registering commercial goods entering through the two northern gates ( 1 and [PER D31  ] ) , data which had gone unrecorded since protesters destroyed the gates in February 2008 . 
The registration process entails collecting basic information about shipments , such as company name , type of goods , value and quantity , to share with customs officials at the inland [LOC Mitrovica  ] customs clearance terminal , and vehicles entering these gates receive instructions to proceed to the inland terminal . 
These are essentially the same procedures that were in place prior to independence ( February 2008 ) , except that [ORG EULEX  ] officials are not yet withholding personal documents from drivers -- such as a passport or driver’s license -- as a guarantee that the driver will present the goods for clearance at the [LOC Mitrovica  ] terminal. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Full customs procedures will not restart at [LOC Gates 1  ] and [PER D31  ] until the gates undergo repair and receive specialized inspection equipment . 
Possible next steps toward [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000148 004 OF 005 reestablishing full customs controls will include building customs offices at the northern gates , establishing freight forwarding and bank offices , installing cameras that connect directly to the main customs operations center in [LOC Pristina  ] , and acceptance of customs duties at the gates . 
Some of these steps , such as installing cameras and collecting duties , are likely to spark political sensitivities in the north , with threats emanating regularly from northern [MISC Serb  ] hardliners about the violent response that will ensue if customs is fully restored . 
[ORG EULEX Customs  ] also needs clarification on which customs law applies in the north -- [ORG UNMIK  ] or [LOC Kosovo  ] -- in order to begin collecting customs duties at the two northern gates . 
Discussions on how to rectify this legal dilemma are on-going in the context of “practical issues” consultations between [ORG EULEX  ] and the [LOC Belgrade  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] governments . 
[ORG EULEX Customs  ] has recommended adding an additional 20 international and 10 local staff in the north to cover eventual revenue collection at [LOC Gates 1  ] and [PER D31  ] , which would take the Customs component to fully operational status . 
[ORG EULEX  ] BEYOND [ORG FOC  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) EULEX’s policy chief [PER Dominique Orsini  ] on April 2 told us that Full Operating Capability ( [ORG FOC  ] ) is a military term in vogue and in use because of former [MISC French  ] General [PER Yves de Kermabon’s  ] influence and reflects only that [ORG EULEX  ] has sufficient personnel to fulfill its mission . 
While [ORG EULEX  ] declared [ORG FOC  ] on April 6 , it does not mean that EULEX’s activities or its mandate have grown to meet Kosovo’s requirements for [MISC EULEX’s  ] mission . 
[PER Orsini  ] told us that [ORG EULEX  ] is actively considering how to improve its performance and told us that other participant countries and the [ORG UN  ] have also noted the gap in policing left by the limited executive authority that [ORG EULEX  ] police officers possess . 
[ORG EULEX  ] is considering creating a very limited cadre of civilian affairs officers that might be able to respond to emerging situations , providing on-the-scene international voices working with [ORG Kosovo Police  ] to help quell local tensions . 
Visiting [ORG EU  ] CIVCOM representative [PER Kim Friedberg  ] told the Ambassador on April 7 that this was under active consideration for the north , though the very next day [ORG EULEX  ] HOM de Kermabon denied to the Ambassador that this civilian or political component would do anything more than simply “coordinate” among [ORG EULEX  ] elements and possibly other international actors operating in the north . 
Confusion obviously still exists on the methodologies [ORG EULEX  ] will employ to overcome some of these “gap” issues. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Orsini  ] is also less confident that [ORG EULEX  ] will resolve the applicable law question . 
As long as only 22 of 27 [ORG EU  ] member states recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] , [ORG EULEX  ] will be unable , according to [PER Orsini  ] , to develop a consistent policy that identifies [LOC Kosovo  ] law as the only legal system operating here . 
He added that [LOC Madrid  ] and the other four non-recognizing capitals complain to [LOC Brussels  ] each time a routine report even suggests that [ORG EULEX  ] is venturing beyond the bounds of status-neutrality and straying from its mandate under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1244 , and [LOC Brussels  ] , in turn , notifies [ORG EULEX  ] headquarters of its offense . 
( At the recent [ORG EULEX  ] ceremony marking the opening of their new headquarters and reaching [ORG FOC  ] , no [LOC Kosovo  ] flag was displayed , though all [ORG EU  ] member state flags -- including that of the [LOC UK  ] , which recently announced its withdrawal of most of its [ORG EULEX  ] contingent -- were prominently featured . 
No [LOC U.S.  ] or [MISC Turkish  ] flag was flown , either . 
) We expect that this confusion will continue to plague both justice and customs operations in the [LOC North  ] , and it will become an ever more vocal bone of contention among [ORG Kosovo  ] [MISC Albanian  ] political forces and the local media . 
COMMENT <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [ORG EULEX  ] has had some successes -- its deployment , de Kermabon’s receptiveness to our counsel , its effective response to violent outbreaks in [LOC Mitrovica  ] , and a growing number of concluded court cases , including a war crimes conviction against a [ORG Kosovo Albanian  ] that carried a 17-year [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000148 005 OF 005 prison sentence . 
Its cautiousness in hewing to status neutrality and defining its mission as purely technical , however , is a serious limitation . 
Right now [ORG EULEX  ] is a stabilizing influence , helping to provide law and order in the absence of international consensus on Kosovo’s status , but it could quickly become immobilized by its inherent political limitations. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG EULEX  ] must take a more active role in helping [LOC Kosovo  ] resolve practical issues that fall within its legitimate mandate on customs , justice and police issues ; this will obviously require an active dialogue with [LOC Serbia  ] -- but without the [ORG UN  ] presence in negotiations that convinces the Kosovars that these talks are just a continuation of the abortive “six point” discussions that almost led to a breakdown of stability in [LOC Kosovo  ] last November . 
If [ORG EULEX  ] -- the biggest and most ambitious ESDP mission to date -- is to succeed , it needs to make progress on the critical issues of the north , but that progress will only come if [LOC Brussels  ] applies equal pressure on [LOC Belgrade  ] and [LOC Pristina  ] , rather than acceding to Belgrade’s political demands and alienating their [LOC Kosovo  ] counterparts . 
Thus far the jury is still out on whether the [ORG EU  ] will show the necessary degree of political leadership , but we will continue to urge a balanced and vigorous approach , as well as a more robust operational posture in Kosovo’s north .
