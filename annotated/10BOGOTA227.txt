End Summary . 
[ORG FARC  ] Hints At Meeting in [LOC Sweden  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) High Commissioner for Peace [PER Frank Pearl  ] told Polcouns February 4 that the [MISC Swedish  ] Ambassador had relayed a positive response by [ORG FARC  ] leadership to a [ORG GOC  ] offer to meet ( reftel ) . 
[PER Pearl  ] said the information had been passed by an unidentified [ORG FARC  ] member living in [LOC Sweden  ] via a former [MISC Swedish  ] Ambassador to [LOC Colombia  ] and current head of the [ORG International Council of Swedish Industry  ] ( [ORG NIR  ] ) . 
[PER Pearl  ] said in the message the [ORG FARC  ] had agreed in principle to a meeting between two [ORG GOC  ] representatives and two members of the [ORG High Command  ] ( " Estado Mayor " ) , but not with higher-ranking [ORG FARC  ] Secretariat members . 
[PER Pearl  ] said he agreed to the meeting on the condition that that [ORG FARC  ] not appoint as one of its representatives [ORG Southern Block Deputy Commander  ] alias [PER Fabian Ramirez  ] , whom the [ORG GOC  ] considers a major narco-trafficker and criminal . 
[PER Pearl  ] said he had discussed with the Government of [LOC Sweden  ] its facilitation of the meeting , including the transportation of the [ORG FARC  ] representatives to [LOC Sweden  ] . 
[PER Pearl  ] presumed that the two representatives would be among those [ORG FARC  ] leaders residing in [LOC Venezuela  ] , thus facilitating their international travel . 
( Note: The current [MISC Swedish  ] Ambassador to [LOC Colombia  ] did not mention these developments in a February 4 breakfast with the Ambassador . 
) [ORG Humanitarian Release Delayed By Electoral Politics  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pearl  ] confirmed rumors that the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] had agreed to facilitate the humanitarian release of [MISC Colombian  ] soldiers [PER Pablo Moncayo  ] ( held by the [ORG FARC  ] since December 1997 ) and [PER Josue Calvo  ] ( held since April 2009 ) . 
The [ORG FARC  ] also agreed to deliver the remains of [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Army  ] major [PER Julian Ernesto Guevara  ] . 
[PER Pearl  ] discounted reports in December that the [ORG FARC  ] had rejected [LOC Brazil  ] in favor of [LOC Argentina  ] . 
He pointed out that the message had come from former president and left-wing [ORG Liberal Party  ] official [PER Ernesto Samper  ] . 
[PER Pearl  ] theorized that [PER Samper  ] was working on behalf of opposition senator [PER Piedad Cordoba  ] , who had been in contact with the [ORG FARC  ] over the releases . 
Catholic Church peace envoy [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] complained to us on February 1 that [PER Cordoba  ] had been manipulating the release date to place it nearer to the March 14 congressional elections . 
Indeed , [PER Cordoba  ] told the press on February 7 that she expected the releases to come at the end of February . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] lamented that [PER Gustavo Moncayo  ] , hostage [PER Moncayo  ] 's father and a [PER Polo Democratico  ] candidate for the [ORG Senate  ] , appeared complicit in this plan . 
[PER Pearl  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] plans to move ahead regardless of dates , though [ORG International Commission  ] for the [ORG Red Cross  ] country director [PER Christophe Beney  ] told us on February 8 that he fears the [ORG GOC  ] will further delay the release so as not to give [PER Cordoba  ] and [PER Moncayo  ] free campaign publicity . 
[PER Pearl  ] publicly echoed complaints of [ORG FARC  ] political manipulation in February 10 remarks to the press , but said the [ORG GOC  ] would cooperate with a release nonetheless . 
[ORG ELN Also Accepts Meeting Offer  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pearl  ] also reported that his offer for a meeting with the [ORG ELN  ] had been accepted . 
He had yet to confirm a date or location , though he expected the meeting would take place in the [LOC Colombia  ] . 
He said he was going to [LOC Medellin  ] to meet with jailed [ORG ELN  ] member [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to discuss details . 
As with the [ORG FARC  ] , the purpose of the meeting is to establish a line of communication that could lead to a " roadmap " toward eventual peace talks . 
[PER Pearl  ] 's hope is to have roadmaps on the [ORG ELN  ] and [ORG FARC  ] ready for the next administration when it takes office in August .
