Senator [PER Biden  ] asked [PER Kayani  ] to describe his view of a stable [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Graham  ] added his presence emphasized bipartisan support for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
( He had just visited [LOC Pakistan  ] three weeks ago . 
) Senator [PER Graham  ] said he was going to support the [MISC Biden-Lugar  ] bill , but he needed to convince his constituents of the value of investing in schools in [LOC Pakistan  ] instead of [LOC South Carolina  ] . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] needed to prosecute those involved in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks and be seen as a country that observed the rule of law. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] replied that [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [LOC US  ] had a convergence of interests . 
[PER Kayani  ] 's goal was a peaceful , friendly and stable [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he had no desire to control [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In fact , he said , anyone who wanted to control [LOC Afghanistan  ] was ignorant of history , since no one has ever controlled it . 
[PER Kayani  ] noted there had been confusion about the policy of " strategic depth " but for him " strategic depth " meant a peaceful [LOC Afghanistan  ] " on his back . 
" But the [MISC Pashtuns  ] have to be accommodated , [PER Kayani  ] added . 
[PER Biden  ] asked if [PER Kayani  ] made a distinction between the [MISC Pashtuns  ] and the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] replied that the [ORG Taliban  ] were a reality , but the [MISC Afghan  ] government dominated by the [ORG Taliban  ] had had a negative effect on [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] recalled he told Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] needed realistic expectations of what the [MISC Pakistani  ] military could achieve and that these expectations had to be clearly articulated . 
[PER Kayani  ] described his campaign in [LOC Bajaur  ] and his plans to confront the insurgents in other tribal agencies , but he repeatedly said he had capacity problems , particularly regarding equipment . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he needed urgent support for the 150,000 people displaced from the fighting . 
He said the military had undertaken hundreds of sorties in [LOC Bajaur  ] , and the population of [LOC Bajaur  ] was so far supportive of the military efforts . 
Senator [PER Graham  ] mentioned the success of the [ORG CERP  ] program in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] which had put money in the hands of commanders for urgent community needs. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] recounted the situation in [LOC Swat  ] in which the provincial government had made accommodations with the militants , requiring the army to retake the area repeatedly . 
[PER Kayani  ] also said the population , once it saw the army pull out , was far less likely to support it the second time around . 
The military had to be followed by civilian agencies or the local support would diminish. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] said military efforts needed the political support of the civilian government . 
He recalled that when ISLAMABAD 00000270 002 OF 003 the [ORG Federal Investigative Agency  ] headquarters in [LOC Lahore  ] had been hit by suicide bombers , the citizens of [LOC Lahore  ] had demonstrated against the government rather than against the suicide bombers . 
While the army had sent the message in [LOC Bajaur  ] that it meant business , there had to be follow-up support from the civilian agencies . 
[PER Kayani  ] said as his campaign moved through the tribal agencies , the army should ideally need to use diminishing force . 
When they have to fight for the same ground repeatedly , it becomes increasingly difficult and demoralizing to the troops. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Biden  ] asked [PER Kayani  ] if he had the capacity and could obtain sufficient resources , would he then move against [ORG Taliban  ] leaders like [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] , Commander [PER Nazir  ] , and the [MISC Haqqanis  ] ? 
Senator [PER Biden  ] asked [PER Kayani  ] if he were prepared to move into the [LOC Waziristans.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] replied that [LOC Bajaur  ] had been the " hardest nut to crack " militarily: the [MISC Pakistani  ] military had undertaken an operation in [MISC South Waziristan  ] last October , but the army had moved out because of the elections . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] military had also had a fort in the middle of [MISC Waziristan  ] which had been cut off by militants . 
[PER Kayani  ] said he was painfully aware that the army had to retake [LOC South Waziristan  ] since ninety percent of the suicide bombers came from [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] . 
" He has to be cut down to size , " said [PER Kayani.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) But , [PER Kayani  ] said , the [MISC Pakistani  ] military could not fight everyone at once . 
They would have to go after [PER Mehsud  ] and [PER Nazir  ] sequentially ( a point [PER Pasha  ] confirmed ) . 
[PER Biden  ] said it was important to be in agreement on this issue . 
[PER Pasha  ] said the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] needed to have confidence in each other . 
[PER Pasha  ] said he was hurt about the inference that he did not have a relationship of trust with [ORG CIA  ] . 
He had gone to [LOC Washington  ] for a frank talk with [ORG CIA  ] Director [PER Hayden  ] and he often briefed , and sought the advice of , the RAO Chief in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
Senator [PER Biden  ] repeated he was not going to revisit the past . 
[PER Pasha  ] replied that there was no reason for ISI to be protecting " these people " and he had no interest in saving them. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Biden  ] said he needed to know that the situation had changed . 
Senator [PER Biden  ] said he understood that the [MISC Pakistani  ] military lacked capacity , but would the situation change if they had additional resources ? 
It was important to know if we had the same enemy: the [LOC U.S.  ] needed to be able to make an objective assessment of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's part of the bargain . 
[PER Graham  ] added that " General [PER Musharraf  ] had cut deals , but those deals didn't work out . 
" <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kayani  ] repeated there had been considerable cooperation on the technical level with [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
But this did not mean that there would not be differences of opinion on tactics . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Kayani  ] stressed ) " past , present , and future " -- we are on the same page. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Regarding LeT , [PER Kayani  ] said [LOC Pakistan  ] would not allow small groups to dictate state policy . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] had not waited for evidence and they had moved immediately . 
The information they had now was based on confessions . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] needed [MISC Indian  ] cooperation to move the investigation forward . 
[PER Kayani  ] also insisted that any information available about upcoming attacks be shared with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He understood that information about the attack had been provided to [LOC India  ] but not to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He said repeated discussion about " the next attack and all bets were off " only provided an incentive for another attack . 
[PER Biden  ] said that what was important was [LOC Pakistan  ] 's action against LeT and similar organizations . 
Senator [PER Biden  ] said he would share what he had heard with [ORG Admiral Mullen  ] and emphasized the need for results. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Kayani  ] said he appreciated the [ORG Senators'  ] frank response . 
He repeated his need for help with [ORG IDPs  ] . 
Senator [PER Biden  ] said the system of reimbursement through [ORG Coalition Support Funds  ] would be reexamined . 
[PER Kayani  ] said that the military had only received about $300 million of the $1 billion ostensibly reimbursed for military expenses . 
He was not implying that the money had been stolen , but had been used for general budget support . 
ISLAMABAD 00000270 003 OF 003 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
[PER CODEL Biden  ] has cleared this message .
