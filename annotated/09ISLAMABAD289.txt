[PER Zardari  ] reiterated again that he and Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] [PER Kayani  ] get along well , although he said he was very realistic about the power of the army “given our history.” Again , [PER Zardari  ] said that he supported stronger ties with [LOC India  ] . 
He also continues to have serious concerns about his personal security . 
End summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador called on President [PER Zardari  ] on February 8 to discuss the upcoming visit of Special Representative [PER Holbrooke  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he would raise with Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] [MISC Pakistan’s  ] commitment to fighting insurgency , which he expected to get much worse when the [ORG GOP  ] really engaged the militants . 
He would also discuss the need for trade access ( [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zone  ] legislation ) for [MISC Pakistani  ] products and economic assistance . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he would not dwell on assistance issues , although he was considering some formulations in which he would invest his own funds for development projects in [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] . 
He realized the [LOC United States  ] could not easily provide aid given the current economic climate . 
Still , as the conversation progressed , [PER Zardari  ] was very worried about the lack of international support for the internally displaced persons and for the police/law enforcement in [ORG NWFP  ] and [ORG FATA  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] said several times that the Special Representative’s visit provided an opportunity to “reset the agenda” with the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] told the Ambassador “not to worry” about his relations with Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] . 
Ambassador said she was not worried , but she believed that the Embassy ( and many others ) had not been paying enough attention to the PM , and we were going to try to rectify that . 
The PM was lashing out because everyone saw him playing second fiddle to the President . 
However , as a longstanding political leader and [ORG Sufi  ] saint , he served a valuable role in the [LOC Pakistan  ] People’s [MISC Party.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] said he had excellent relations with [MISC Afghan  ] President [PER Karzai  ] , but was under no illusions about his forthrightness . 
[PER Zardari  ] said that he was going to work with [PER Karzai  ] , and he did not see any better options in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] was clearer than in previous meetings about his intention to move against [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] and predicted the [ORG Supreme Court  ] would declare [PER Nawaz  ] ineligible to run for the [ORG National Assembly  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] claimed [PER Nawaz  ] had planned to run [PER A.Q. Khan  ] on a [LOC Pakistan  ] [MISC Muslim League-N  ] slate , so it was better to confront [PER Nawaz  ] sooner rather than later . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he had been ready to make a deal with [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] that would provide for a constitutional amendment to increase the retirement age for the justices - presumably bringing back the former chief justice as a justice -- but [PER Shahbaz  ] had been uncooperative . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he was convinced that Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] ( [ORG COAS  ] ) General [PER Kayani  ] would never support [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] as Prime Minister. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] said he was struggling over who would be named Chairman of the [ORG Senate  ] after the [ORG Senate  ] elections , now scheduled for March 4 . 
[PER Zardari  ] said the best candidate would be law minister [PER Farouk Naek  ] , but Ambassador asked who would then be Law Minister. “That’s the problem , ” said [PER Zardari  ] , “we don’t have enough good people.” He said that Information Minister [PER Sherry Rehman  ] “was dying for the job , ” but the conservative religious party , [PER Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam  ] , which would still have thirty votes in the [ORG Senate  ] , would never vote for a woman as [ORG Senate  ] President . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he was probably going to pick someone from [ORG NWFP  ] or [ORG FATA  ] so he would have regional balance . 
ISLAMABAD 00000289 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] said he was going to replace [ORG NWFP  ] Governor [PER Ghani  ] soon . 
He had not done so to date , as picking a replacement brought with it multiple political problems . 
He suggested [ORG Frontier Corps Inspector Major General  ] [PER Tariq Khan  ] . 
Ambassador tried to discourage that idea , indicating that [PER Khan  ] was desperately needed in the ongoing fight . 
[PER Zardari  ] was also considering various names for [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , including former Ambassador to the [LOC UK  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Maleeha Lodi  ] ( “the party doesn’t trust her” ) and retired [ORG COAS  ] and Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Jehangir Karamat  ] ( “probably too old and , as a former [ORG COAS  ] , [PER Kayani  ] would always have to defer to him.” ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador saw [PER Zardari  ] at [LOC Bilawal House  ] in [LOC Karachi  ] . 
Zardari’s father is in poor health and [PER Zardari  ] was reluctant to leave [LOC Karachi  ] . 
The conversation turned to security in the neighborhood and his personal security . 
[PER Zardari  ] said his vulnerability was one reason it was important to select a competent President of the [ORG Senate  ] . 
( If the president dies or resigns , the President of the [ORG Senate  ] would step in as President until the indirect election for President could be held . 
) [PER Zardari  ] revealed that , if he was assassinated , he had instructed his son [PER Bilawal  ] to name his sister , [PER Faryal Talpur  ] , as President. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Bio Note: Embassy officers have been very impressed with [PER Talpur  ] , who is extremely energetic and well respected . 
[PER Kayani  ] once told the Ambassador that she would be a better president than her brother . 
) [PER Zardari  ] described his sister as “tough and committed.” Her nineteen year old son had committed suicide and her husband , [PER Zardari  ] said , had never really recovered from his son’s death . 
They also had a daughter who had also been emotionally damaged by her brother’s death . 
The [MISC Talpurs  ] had then adopted a child from the [MISC Afghan  ] refugee camp , but passed the now six-year old off as their own since it was considered “un-Islamic” to adopt in some circles .
