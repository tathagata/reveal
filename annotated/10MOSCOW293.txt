It was agreed that implementation of all of these areas of cooperation will be a benefit to both the [LOC United States  ] and the [LOC Russian Federation  ] . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 4 , 2010 , [PER OC Harrigan  ] and [PER RD Destito  ] participated in the [MISC US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] , [ORG Drug Trafficking Working Group  ] headed by ONDCP Director [PER Gil Kerlikowske  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] Director [PER Viktor Ivanov  ] . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Subsequent to the [MISC US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] , [ORG Drug Trafficking Working Group  ] meeting , on February 5 , 2010 , [PER OC Harrigan  ] met with [ORG FSKN  ] Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] to discuss [MISC DEA-FSKN  ] bilateral cooperation and drug enforcement issues . 
Also in attendance from [ORG FSKN  ] were [PER Alexander Kirushev  ] , First Deputy [PER Head  ] of Operations , [PER Vasily Rogozin  ] , [PER Head  ] of [ORG Enforcement Division  ] , [PER Oleg Koryagin  ] , [PER Head  ] of [LOC Financial Investigations  ] , [PER Inga Mayke  ] , Deputy [PER Head  ] of Enforcement , [PER Ilya Malakhov  ] , Deputy [PER Head  ] of [LOC Financial Investigations  ] , [PER Alexander Kurkov  ] , Chief Inspector of [ORG International Cooperation Department  ] . 
In attendance from [ORG DEA  ] were [PER RD Destito  ] and [ORG CA Michael Nowacoski  ] . 
US Embassy [ORG Moscow/Law Enforcement Section  ] - [ORG Resident Legal Advisor  ] [PER Richard Daddario  ] also attended this meeting . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] began by discussing the [MISC Afghan  ] opiate problem that the [LOC Russian Federation  ] is facing . 
According to Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] , from [ORG FSKN  ] 's and the [MISC Russian  ] Government 's point of view the trafficking of [MISC Afghan  ] opiates and their abuse is considered a " weapon of mass destruction " for the [LOC Russian Federation  ] , which is inflicting great harm to the country and its citizens . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] explained every day there are approximately 80 to 150 drug related deaths of [MISC Russian  ] citizens , which can be attributed to the abuse of [MISC Afghan  ] opiates . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] is not satisfied that last year the production of opium decreased to approximately 6,900 metric tons . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] believes that much more can be done to decrease the opium production in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
According to [ORG FSKN  ] intel , there are enough opiates in storage in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that can supply the demand for the next five years . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG FSKN  ] stated that [MISC Central Asian  ] law enforcement counterparts are not fulfilling their duties in combating the trafficking of [MISC Afghan  ] opiates . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] provided statistics for last year , which revealed the following: the [ORG Tajik Drug Control Agency  ] seized approximately 1.5 metric tons less than they did in 2008 , [MISC Kyrgyz  ] law enforcement counterparts seized 10 times less drugs shipments than last year , and the situation is no different for [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000293 002 OF 007 [MISC Kazakh  ] and [MISC Uzbek  ] law enforcement counterparts . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] is disappointed with the work ethic and results of all the law enforcement agencies in the [MISC Central Asian  ] countries . 
7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] requested [ORG DEA  ] 's assistance in combating the trafficking of [MISC Afghan  ] opiates in [LOC Russia  ] and throughout the region . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] echoed US Ambassador [PER John Beyrle  ] 's statement during the [MISC US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] , [ORG Drug Trafficking Working Group  ] meeting that the cold war does not exist and that today calls for " a new time and new relations " between our two countries . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] explained that the [ORG FSKN  ] is accomplishing a lot in combating the [MISC Afghan  ] opiate problem but has realized that it is impossible to tackle this problem alone and without cooperation from other countries , including the [LOC United States  ] . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] stated that " [LOC Russia  ] can't do the job by ourselves . 
" 9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] 's personal opinion is that [ORG DEA  ] is highly respected and influential throughout the world wide law enforcement community . 
This opinion is also shared throughout the [ORG FSKN  ] . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] hopes that [ORG DEA  ] can use its influence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Central Asia  ] to curb the [MISC Afghan  ] drug problem . 
10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] identified the following areas of cooperation that the [ORG FSKN  ] is interested in conducting with the [ORG DEA: Utilizing DEA  ] 's resources and capabilities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to target [MISC Afghan  ] based [PER DTOs  ] . 
[ORG FSKN  ] would like a concentrated effort on conducting joint investigations with the [ORG DEA  ] on [ORG Northern Route DTOs  ] and targeting the [MISC Afghan  ] based sources of supply . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] identified the [LOC Moscow  ] CO-FSKN joint investigation of the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX MOSCOW  ] 00000293 003 OF 007 The [ORG FSKN  ] suggested as a method to target [MISC Afghan  ] based sources and [MISC Russian  ] based recipients that the [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] attempt to conduct International Controlled Deliveries ( ICDs ) to [LOC Russia  ] . 
In an attempt to effectively target [MISC Afghan  ] based sources of supply and [ORG Northern Route DTOs  ] , the [ORG FSKN  ] proposed that the [LOC United States  ] become a " full fledged " country member of the [ORG CARICC  ] . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] proposed that the [ORG FSKN  ] would not only support the [MISC United States'  ] bid to become an " observer " country member with [ORG CARICC  ] but would support the [LOC United States'  ] bid to become a " full fledged " country member of [ORG CARICC  ] . 
[ORG FSKN  ] also places an emphasis on targeting [PER DTOs  ] that are sending cocaine shipments to the [LOC Russian Federation  ] . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] stated that during last year , the [ORG FSKN  ] seized five times the amount of cocaine than the previous year . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] believes that cocaine trafficking will continue to increase in the future due to the lucrative [MISC Russian  ] market . 
The average price for a kilogram of cocaine in [LOC Russia  ] is approximately $60,000 to $100,000 USD per kilogram . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Agent  ] 's Note: On February 3 , 2010 , [ORG FSKN  ] Director [PER Ivanov  ] was on [MISC Russian  ] TV and in the [MISC Russian  ] press discussing the [MISC DEA-FSKN  ] relationship and thanked the [ORG DEA  ] 's assistance in the above mentioned SHEFATOV investigation , which led to its successful outcome . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] requested to utilize [ORG DEA  ] 's resources and capabilities in [LOC South America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] to target [ORG DTOs  ] that are sending cocaine shipments to [LOC Russia  ] . 
Director [PER Aulov  ] proposed conducting new joint cocaine investigations with the [ORG DEA  ] to include a DTO that is sending cocaine shipments from [LOC Brazil  ] to [LOC Russia  ] . 
Another area of joint cooperation that the [ORG FSKN  ] would like to develop with the [ORG DEA  ] is on targeting [MISC DTOs  ] that are engage in the trafficking of synthetic drugs and precursor chemicals . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] requested the [ORG DEA  ] to provide information on the seizures of acetic anhydride ( AA ) shipments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the subsequent results of the chemical analysis that may allow the identification of the source countries . 
Due to recent changes in [MISC Russian  ] legislation , the [ORG FSKN  ] is now allowed to exchange drug samples with foreign counterparts for further analysis . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] proposed the exchange of the results of the chemical analysis on the seized drugs for further comparative studies . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] also suggested the exchange of [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] chemists in an attempt to learn new techniques and ideas from each other when analyzing drug samples . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] is interested in conducting joint financial investigations with the [ORG DEA  ] . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] is very interested in starting the joint mapping exercise with the [ORG DEA  ] to identify money movements and to share financial intel to target key narcotics traffickers . 
The [ORG US Treasury Department  ] and [MISC Russian  ] Financial Monitoring Service ( Rosfinmonitoring Service ) are currently finalizing the Terms of Reference ( TOR ) to start sharing financial information between the two agencies . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000293 004 OF 007 Agent 's Note: A new trend that [ORG FSKN  ] in seeing is that drug proceeds are now being sent directly to [LOC Afghanistan  ] instead of being sent to third countries ( i.e . 
[LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Europe  ] , and [LOC Central Asia  ] ) . 
During the [MISC US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] , [ORG Drug Trafficking Working Group  ] meeting , Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] presented a [ORG PowerPoint  ] presentation [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] supplied a hard copy of his [ORG PowerPoint Presentation  ] to [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] . 
This hard copy is written in the [MISC Russian  ] language . 
The [ORG Moscow CO  ] will translate the hard copy into the [MISC English  ] language . 
Another emerging threat that the [ORG FSKN  ] has identified is [MISC Afghan  ] based [MISC DTOs  ] utilizing [LOC Iran  ] as a conduit to ship large shipments of [MISC Afghan  ] opiates and hashish to [LOC Russia  ] via [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and the [LOC Caspian Sea  ] . 
According to [ORG FSKN  ] intel , more and more [MISC DTOs  ] are now using [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Caspian  ] seaports to ship large opiate and hashish shipments to [LOC Russia  ] due to the lack of enforcement and inspections in these areas . 
To combat this problem the [ORG FSKN  ] is attempting to develop better working relationships with [MISC Azeri  ] law enforcement counterparts . 
As of right now , the [ORG FSKN  ] has limited engagement with [MISC Iranian  ] law enforcement counterparts . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] knows that the [ORG US Government  ] and the [ORG DEA  ] does not have any relationship with the [ORG Iranian Government  ] or [MISC Iranian  ] law enforcement counterparts . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] proposed on sharing [MISC Iranian  ] intel with the [ORG DEA  ] and vice versa to fill the intelligence gaps that each agency has related to [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] would like to be seen united with the [ORG DEA  ] in the eyes of [ORG Central Asian  ] law enforcement counterparts . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] believes that if [ORG Central Asian  ] counterparts see the [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] united they will not be able to play off both countries as they have in the past . 
As noted above , the [ORG FSKN  ] is very dissatisfied with the counter narcotics effort of [ORG Central Asian  ] counterparts . 
The [ORG FSKN  ] believes if these [ORG Central Asian  ] counterparts see the [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] proactively engaging in joint [ORG Northern Route  ] investigations and sitting side by side with each in the [ORG CARICC  ] this would send a loud and clear signal that the [MISC Afghan  ] drug problem is a major issue for both the [LOC United States  ] and the [LOC Russian Federation  ] and that their lack of effort will not be tolerated . 
11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] responded to Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] 's comments that [ORG DEA  ] 's main focus in this region is [LOC Afghanistan  ] and that the [ORG DEA  ] would assist the [ORG FSKN  ] in every possible way to target the [MISC Afghan  ] based sources of supply . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] stated that any intel that is developed or obtained that could be shared with the [ORG FSKN  ] would be shared with them . 
12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] provided a briefing on [ORG DEA  ] 's operations and assets that are in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] stated that he would provide the [ORG FSKN  ] with a written summary in the [MISC Russian  ] language of [ORG DEA  ] 's current operations and staff levels in [LOC Afghanistan  ] via the [ORG Moscow CO  ] . 
13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] reported that he may travel to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in or about March and during this visit would attempt to personally meet with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who is [ORG FSKN  ] 's liaison officer based in [LOC Kabul  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] explained that [ORG DEA  ] 's main mission is to target the key individuals who are the " command and control " for the major [MISC DTOs  ] . 
[ORG DEA  ] utilizes world wide assets in an attempt to disrupt and dismantle [MISC DTOs  ] by arresting and prosecuting the " high value targets " of the [MISC DTOs  ] . 
15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] handed Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] with a target package that contains eight [MISC Afghan  ] DTOs that were cleared by the [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000293 005 OF 007 [ORG Kabul CO  ] to pass to the [ORG FSKN  ] . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] requested the [ORG FSKN  ] to conduct a search in their databases on these [MISC DTOs  ] in an attempt to determine if the [ORG FSKN  ] has any intel on these [MISC DTOs  ] . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] proposed conducting joint investigations with the [ORG FSKN  ] on these targets . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] advised that the [ORG DEA  ] conducted an extensive search on the booklet that was provided by the [ORG FSKN  ] that contained the 175 heroin markings and logos but the search was negative . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] explained that the [ORG DEA  ] does not seize significant quantities of [ORG Southwest Asian  ] heroin in the [LOC United States  ] and thus does not have a detailed database . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] thanked the [ORG FSKN  ] in providing this booklet and requested the [ORG FSKN  ] to continue to provide details on heroin seizures to include , dates , locations , amounts , markings , and logos so that the database could be enlarged . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] stated that the [ORG Moscow CO  ] would translate the results of [ORG DEA  ] 's search on the heroin markings and logos into the [MISC Russian  ] language so that it could be passed to the [ORG FSKN  ] . 
17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] briefed the [ORG FSKN  ] on [ORG DEA  ] 's operations in [LOC Africa  ] including information on [MISC Colombian  ] DTOs who are establishing a presence in [LOC West Africa  ] . 
These [MISC Colombian  ] DTOs are receiving plane loads of cocaine shipments from [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] for further distribution to [LOC Europe  ] and possibly to [LOC Russia  ] . 
18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] identified that the [ORG DEA  ] has offices in the following [MISC African  ] countries: [LOC Lagos  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , [LOC Cairo  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Pretoria  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , and [LOC Accra  ] , [LOC Ghana  ] but the [ORG DEA  ] is quickly developing a close working cooperation with the respective host country counterparts . 
As an example , [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] described the recent joint investigation between the [ORG DEA  ] and [LOC Ghana  ] counterparts that led to the arrest and the extradition of three [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] associates who were involved in cocaine trafficking to the [LOC United States  ] for prosecution . 
19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] also provided a briefing on [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's presence in [LOC East Africa  ] and their activities in trafficking in precursor chemicals . 
[ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] related that more [MISC DTOs  ] are now involved in narco-terrorism activities . 
20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] agreed with all of Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] 's proposals and is very interested in [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] fostering closer working relationships and conducting numerous other " joint " investigations . 
21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the meeting , [ORG RD Destito  ] provided a briefing on [ORG DEA  ] 's operations and presence in [LOC Central Asia  ] . 
22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RD Destito  ] explained that the [ORG Dushanbe CO  ] is working joint investigations with the [ORG Tajik Drug Control Agency  ] , the [MISC Tajik  ] [ORG MVD  ] , and the [ORG Tajik Border Guard Services  ] . 
[ORG RD Destito  ] described the working cooperation with [MISC Tajik  ] counterparts is difficult due to corruption issues . 
23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RD  ] [PER Destito  ] advised that [ORG DEA  ] has recently re-opened the [ORG Tashkent CO  ] and that the [ORG DEA  ] is now allowed to work with the previous [MISC Uzbek  ] [ORG SIU  ] unit . 
24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RD  ] [PER Destito  ] discussed the status of opening of the [ORG Almaty CO  ] , which will cover [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , and work directly with [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000293 006 OF 007 the [ORG CARICC  ] . 
[ORG RD Destito  ] used the [ORG SECI Center  ] as an example of how the [ORG CARRIC  ] could be utilized in counter narcotics investigations . 
[ORG RD Destito  ] explained that in the beginning the [ORG SECI Center  ] encountered difficulties Since then , the [ORG SECI  ] has been provided outstanding contributions to joint multi lateral investigations . 
[ORG RD Destito  ] described the recent seizure of a ton of cocaine made by [MISC Romanian  ] counterparts , which was then shared with the [ORG SECI Center  ] . 
The [ORG SECI Center  ] was able to provide timely intel that resulted in the seizure of an additional 3.5 metric tons of cocaine in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG RD Destito  ] believes that the [ORG CARICC  ] will be able to follow in the foot steps of the [ORG SECI Center  ] in providing quality case support . 
25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] and [ORG RD Destito  ] thanked the [ORG FSKN  ] for its suggestion on supporting the [LOC United States  ] on becoming a " full fledged " country member of the [ORG CARRIC  ] instead of an " observer " country member . 
26 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RD  ] [PER Destito  ] explained his disappointment with the disbandment of the [ORG Kyrgyz Drug Control Agency  ] ( [ORG KDCA  ] ) and that this will be a set back for the entire region on curbing the flow of [MISC Afghan  ] opiates . 
[ORG RD Destito  ] stated that the [ORG DEA  ] is waiting on the final decision from the [ORG Kyrgyz Government  ] on the reorganization of the [ORG Kyrgyz Ministry  ] of the Interior ( [ORG MVD  ] ) .

[ORG RD Destito  ] explained that the newly established [ORG Turkmen Drug Control Agency  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) needs international support and proposed that [ORG FSKN  ] provide assistance in joint [LOC NATO-Russian Training  ] for the [MISC Turkmen  ] [ORG DCA.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both [ORG OC  ] [PER Harrigan  ] and [ORG RD Destito  ] proposed that [ORG FSKN  ] liaison officers who are posted in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Tajikistan  ] , [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , and [LOC Uzbekistan  ] meet with the respective [ORG DEA  ] agents who are or who will be posted to those countries in an attempt strength the relationship between the [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] and to show [MISC Central Asian  ] counterparts that the [ORG DEA  ] and [ORG FSKN  ] are committed in working together in a common goal on disrupting and dismantling Northern Route DTOs . 
Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] agreed with this proposal but added that the high level of corruption that are involved in those countries can not be dismissed . 
29 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the end of the meeting , Deputy Director [PER Aulov  ] allowed General [PER Alexander Kirushev  ] and General [PER Vasily Rogozin  ] to provide comments . 
30 .

The [ORG FSKN  ] is in the process of analyzing seven additional investigations that could be proposed as joint investigations to be conducted with the [ORG Moscow CO  ] . 
31 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) General [PER Kirushev  ] requested that since [MISC Afghan  ] sources of supply are not in direct contact with [MISC Russian  ] based DTOs , if the [ORG DEA  ] would be able to provide identified [MISC Afghan  ] and other [MISC Central Asian  ] telephone numbers that could then be used to identify [MISC Russian  ] telephone numbers . 
Lastly , General [PER Kirushev  ] explained that since the break up of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , there are a lot of [MISC Russian  ] nationals who are residing world wide who may be involved in shipping drug shipments to [LOC Russia  ] .
