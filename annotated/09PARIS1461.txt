END SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND . 
SECOND ANNUAL FRANCO-ISRAELI [ORG STRATEGIC  ] DIALOGUE --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pierre Sellal  ] , Director General of the [MISC French  ] [ORG MFA  ] , and [PER Yossi Gal  ] , Director General of the [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG MFA  ] , led their respective delegations in the second annual [MISC Franco-Israeli Strategic Dialogue  ] on October 29 in [LOC Paris  ] . 
The " five to six hours " of talks covered a wide range of issues , including the peace process , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , according to [PER Bereyziat  ] . 
The first bilateral [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] took place in May 2008 , approximately a year after President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's election . 
No such exchanges took place under President [PER Chirac  ] , [PER Bereyziat  ] acknowledged , adding that the [MISC French  ] now hope to make it an annual tradition . 
He said the next dialogue will take place late next year . 
( COMMENT: This new tradition reflects [PER Sarkozy  ] 's avowed attempt to create a more balanced [MISC French  ] approach to the [LOC Middle East  ] by developing a closer rapport with [LOC Israel  ] . 
END COMMENT . 
) [LOC TURKEY  ] ------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC French  ] participants in the [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] noted profound disquiet among the [MISC Israelis  ] about [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Bereyziat  ] said . 
He reported that the [MISC Israelis  ] claimed the [LOC Turks  ] have allowed weapons-related material for [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program to transit [LOC Turkey  ] , with Prime Minister [PER Erdogan  ] 's full knowledge . 
The [MISC French  ] replied that [LOC Israel  ] would need to have clear and concrete proof of such activity before leveling accusations . 
The [MISC Israelis  ] replied that they are collecting evidence which they will eventually publicize . 
In the meantime , [PER Bereyziat  ] said , the [MISC Israelis  ] explained that they will not take strong public positions condemning what they perceive as [LOC Turkey  ] 's recent strategic shift away from western positions on the peace process , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear program . 
[PER Erdogan  ] 's public comments about [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear weapons had particularly irked the [MISC Israelis  ] , [PER Bereyziat  ] explained , describing them as unprecedented by a [MISC Turkish  ] leader . 
Moreover , the [MISC Israelis  ] blamed the [MISC Europeans  ] , and especially [LOC France  ] , for this shift in [LOC Turkey  ] 's policy . 
They said that if [LOC Europe  ] had more warmly embraced [LOC Turkey  ] , then the [LOC Turks  ] would not be taking steps to earn approval in the [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] world at the expense of [LOC Israel  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] , in response to this accusation , " begged to differ , " [PER Bereyziat  ] said . 
[ORG GOLDSTONE REPORT  ] , PEACE PROCESS , [ORG UAV TECHNOLOGY  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) President [PER Sarkozy  ] called Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] directly on October 26 , [PER Bereyziat  ] reported , to urge him to establish an independent investigation into the actions of the [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Defense Forces  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] informed [PER Netanyahu  ] that such a step would decrease pressure on [LOC Israel  ] and its allies stemming from the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] responded briskly: " No way . 
" [MISC French  ] officials emphasized [PER Sarkozy  ] 's point again during the [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] , [PER Bereyziat  ] said , and the [MISC Israelis  ] continued to reject his advice . 
( See reftel for a description of earlier [MISC French  ] efforts to persuade the [MISC Israelis  ] to take this step . 
) Separately , to prevent the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] from further impeding the peace process , the [MISC French  ] are now contemplating a pre-emptive approach in the [ORG U.N. General Assembly  ] , according to [PER Bereyziat  ] . 
With this aim in mind , the [ORG GOF  ] may float a Resolution that would ensure the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] does not return to the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
[PER Bereyziat  ] did not specify further what this draft Resolution might contain. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [MISC Franco-Israeli  ] discussions on the status of the peace process itself resembled a " conversation of the deaf , " [PER Bereyziat  ] said . 
" We have a profound disagreement on tactics , but we obviously agree on the end goal . 
" [LOC France  ] has not , however , taken any " punitive " measures following the [LOC Gaza  ] conflict , [PER Bereyziat  ] explained . 
He said that whereas other [MISC European  ] countries stopped selling [ORG Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  ] ( [ORG UAV  ] ) parts to [LOC Israel  ] after the conflict , the [MISC French  ] have continued to do so . 
And [PER Bereyziat  ] reported that the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Israelis  ] did agree on one important point related to the peace process: [LOC Iran  ] continues to play a destructive role in the region , creating and prolonging conflicts . 
[LOC SYRIA  ] ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Bereyziat  ] described a division within the [MISC Israeli  ] delegation about [LOC Syria  ] 's openness to the west . 
Some on the delegation perceived [MISC Syrians  ] as intransigent and discounted the possible benefits that might accrue to [LOC Israel  ] through the re-launching of direct , or even indirect , negotiations . 
Others , [PER Bereyziat  ] said , including military representatives " with [PER Ehud Barak  ] 's ear , " supported the [MISC French  ] claim that [LOC Israel  ] would put [LOC Syria  ] in a bind by suddenly expressing openness to negotiations over the [LOC Golan  ] . 
This group of [MISC Israelis  ] believed [MISC Syrian  ] leaders seek to free themselves from dependence on [LOC Iran  ] and to re-engage fully with the west .
