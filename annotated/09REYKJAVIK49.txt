( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Part  ] 1 of [ORG Embassy  ] 's submission follows , keyed to reftel format . 
[ORG Part  ] 2 will follow septel . 
Begin text of submission: THE COUNTRY'S TIP SITUATION: -- [PER A. Sources  ] of information: The only information presently available on TIP is anecdotal in nature , though government officials' and NGOs' accounts of the problem are largely consistent . 
As in years past , post 's sources - especially [ORG NGOs  ] - maintain that they have seen several concrete examples of trafficking . 
There are no current government plans to undertake comprehensive documentation of trafficking . 
Official reporting on the problem of TIP is limited to a brief discussion in the February 2009 annual report by the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner on threats to [LOC Iceland  ] from organized crime and terrorism . 
The report noted the existence of ( illegal ) organized prostitution rings in [LOC Iceland  ] and speculated that these rings may traffic women to [LOC Iceland  ] for the purposes of prostitution . 
Government officials have confirmed to post that they believe trafficking exists in [LOC Iceland  ] and have shared anecdotal information on the issue , but have reiterated that no comprehensive reporting exists . 
There has been some limited media reporting on TIP , generally related to specific cases . 
During the reporting period two cases of alleged trafficking in persons received media coverage . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Red Cross  ] began an investigation in January 2009 to measure the scope of the trafficking problem , and expects to issue a report on it in June 2009 . 
-- [PER B. Is  ] the country a country of origin , transit , and/or destination for internationally trafficked men , women , or children ? 
Internal trafficking ? 
Outline of victims and changes to situation ? 
[PER Summary:  ] Estimates by police sources and [ORG NGOs  ] put the number of victims during the reporting period between 5-20 . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is a country of destination and likely a country of transit for trafficked women ( primarily in the sex industry ) and to a lesser extent for men ( restaurant and construction industry ) . 
One [ORG NGO  ] source reported knowledge of a woman resident in [LOC Iceland  ] who was trafficked from the country during the reporting period . 
There are no indications of trafficking within [LOC Iceland  ] ; post sources agree that with rare exception victims are trafficked internationally to the greater [LOC Reykjavik  ] metropolitan area . 
The situation with regard to sex trafficking to and through [LOC Iceland  ] appears unchanged . 
Reports of labor exploitation of foreign construction workers ( in rare cases , possibly trafficked to [LOC Iceland  ] ) have decreased dramatically . 
Individual cases of alleged trafficking received greater attention in the media than in previous years . 
End summary . 
The government did not officially identify any cases of trafficking during the reporting period . 
However , estimates by police and [ORG NGO  ] sources agree that there were likely 5-20 alleged victims , most if not all female . 
There were isolated cases of origin and destination . 
For the current reporting period , post considers 5-20 victims to be a credible estimate of the scope of the problem , though we are concerned over the lack of a formal , comprehensive study of TIP in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Even the harshest critics of government policy concede [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000049 002 OF 006 that there are likely only a handful of victims each year . 
Most alleged cases include underpaid and/or mistreated workers in nightclubs and massage parlors as well as prostitutes trafficked from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] . 
Nightclub and massage parlor workers -- who are alleged to be forced to work as prostitutes -- may stay for several months before being trafficked onward , while other prostitutes may spend only a few days in [LOC Reykjavik  ] before being moved abroad . 
A [ORG Metropolitan Police  ] source said that there had been five possible TIP cases during the reporting period , all involving foreign prostitutes and most likely linked to [MISC European-based  ] organized crime rings . 
An [ORG NGO  ] representative said that she had seen as many as 13 possible TIP victims who had been involved in prostitution or abusive marriages . 
One of Post 's sources claimed at least one woman had been trafficked into prostitution from [LOC Iceland  ] to a [LOC Pacific  ] island , a direct consequence of the economic crisis that hit [LOC Iceland  ] beginning in October 2008 . 
The woman 's nationality is unknown , but she is not of [MISC Icelandic  ] origin and does not have [MISC Icelandic  ] citizenship . 
Post has been unable to independently confirm this case . 
Undocumented foreign workers - mostly [MISC Baltic  ] and [ORG Eastern European  ] - in [LOC Iceland  ] 's construction and manufacturing sector may be exploited , but most sources opine that these are cases of immigrant and employment law violations rather than trafficking in persons . 
Post agrees with this assessment . 
Press accounts of such cases have drastically decreased during the reporting period compared to the previous year ; post 's contacts in the government confirm a decline in reported violations . 
Furthermore , size of the immigrant labor force has been reduced drastically as a result of [LOC Iceland  ] 's financial and economic collapse beginning in fall 2008. . 
There was one reported case in February 2008 that came to light during the reporting period alleging that at least two and as many as five workers at a [MISC Chinese  ] restaurant were trafficked to [LOC Iceland  ] and forced to work under substandard conditions . 
There was no evidence of trafficking in children . 
-- [PER C. What  ] kind of conditions are the victims trafficked into ? 
With regard to sex trafficking , most alleged cases include underpaid and/or mistreated workers in nightclubs and massage parlors as well as prostitutes trafficked from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] . 
Nightclub dancers and massage parlor workers -- who are alleged to be forced to work as prostitutes in addition to their stated job duties -- may stay for several months before being trafficked onward , while other prostitutes may spend only a few days in [LOC Reykjavik  ] before being moved abroad . 
Legal measures to reduce the number and operations of strip clubs in the [MISC Reykjavik Metropolitan Area  ] -- the predominant loci of TIP cases , according to post sources -- have been somewhat successful . 
Beginning in 2007 , police and municipal governments strengthened the licensing requirements for such establishments , leading many to go out of business . 
At the end of the reporting period only three strip clubs remained in operation in the whole country , all in the [MISC Reykjavik Metropolitan Area  ] . 
The owners were apparently able to exploit loopholes in the law on the operations of entertainment establishments to remain in operation , although this legislation had in effect outlawed strip shows as well as lap dances in 2007 . 
[ORG NGO  ] representatives and police say that rumors continue to circulate regarding prostitution and illegal nude shows and lap dances in the handful of the remaining establishments . 
Nightclub dancers are allegedly encouraged , and sometimes obligated , to provide sexual services during performances in private rooms as well as to make prostitution calls outside the clubs . 
Foreign prostitutes brought to [LOC Iceland  ] for shorter periods of time are often required to provide sexual services in hotels or private apartments , where they stay during their time in the country . 
In one case , the head of a prostitution ring seized the passports of four foreign women resident in [LOC Iceland  ] and forced three of them to work as prostitutes in order to earn money in exchange for the return of their documents . 
The women worked as prostitutes in apartments in the greater [LOC Reykjavik  ] area but were not forced to live there full-time . 
[ See Overview E , below . 
] Media reports of undocumented foreign workers living in industrial [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000049 003 OF 006 space and less-than-optimal living conditions -- having mostly vanished from news reports during 2007 -- did not resurface during the reporting period . 
The inflow of [ORG Eastern European  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] citizens who have been coming to [LOC Iceland  ] in search of employment , virtually stopped and many have returned to their home countries in wake of the financial and economic collapse that hit [LOC Iceland  ] in October 2008 . 
In the case of [MISC Chinese  ] restaurant workers allegedly trafficked to [LOC Iceland  ] , the workers were reportedly forced to live in the same building as the restaurant and were paid grossly substandard wages . 
Their travel documents were falsified by the traffickers , who seized the documents upon the victims' arrival in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
-- [PER D. Vulnerability  ] to [MISC TIP: Are  ] certain groups of persons more at risk of being trafficked ( e.g. women and children , boys versus girls , certain ethnic groups , refugees , [LOC IDPs  ] , etc . 
) ? 
Women from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] appear to be the primary victims of TIP in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
-- [PER E. Traffickers  ] and Their Methods: A February 2009 report by the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner on organized crime and terrorist threats in [LOC Iceland  ] confirmed the existence of organized prostitution involving international organized crime rings , who traffic foreign women to [LOC Iceland  ] for the purpose of prostitution . 
Traffickers are often connected with dealers of illegal narcotics . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] criminal elements serve as local agents for the foreign organized crime rings , according to the report and the 2008 edition of the same report . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is in the [ORG Schengen Zone  ] as well as the [ORG European Economic Area  ] ( [ORG EEA  ] ) , which allows for the free flow of travelers and workers between [LOC Iceland  ] and other [MISC European  ] countries . 
Workers from [ORG EEA  ] countries may come to [LOC Iceland  ] visa-free for up to three months to seek employment . 
Traffickers reportedly use this provision to bring prostitutes to the country and then move them again before the expiration of the three-month period , thereby removing the need for false documents or fraudulent work permit applications . 
Suspected trafficking victims from non-EEA states most commonly hold valid visas from other [LOC Schengen  ] countries , according to police officials . 
Police officials tell post that as these travelers most commonly are arriving from elsewhere within the [LOC Schengen  ] zone , police and customs officials at the port of entry ( i.e. , the country 's sole international airport ) have limited authorization to detain them for further questioning unless they are suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking . 
There are no reports of travel or employment agencies or marriage brokers acting as fronts for traffickers . 
Two cases during the reporting period shed further light on traffickers' methods . 
In the first , in March 2008 , labor authorities and union representatives reported that the [MISC Chinese  ] owners of a [MISC Chinese  ] restaurant in [LOC Reykjavik  ] were suspected of having trafficked several of its kitchen staff to the country . 
Two [MISC Chinese  ] individuals were allegedly forced to live above the restaurant -- while being registered as living in an apartment elsewhere in [LOC Reykjavik  ] -- and were not paid according to union contracts . 
The Chairman of the [MISC Icelandic  ] Union of Food and Restaurant Workers said that the restaurant applied for work permits for five [MISC Chinese  ] chefs in 2007 . 
The qualifications of the workers submitted by the restaurant were not adequate . 
The owners left [LOC Iceland  ] in the fall of 2007 , perhaps for [LOC Belgium  ] and [LOC France  ] where they had their legal address . 
At that time , the [MISC Icelandic  ] immigration authorities were alerted to the case . 
However , it was not until March 2008 that police got the information about alleged human trafficking . 
In this case , the union discovered that payments to the five workers were not in accordance with union contracts . 
The union chairman claims that the employers had at least two of the [MISC Chinese  ] workers pay them money to come to work in [LOC Iceland  ] , and then give ten percent of their wages to them under threat of violence . 
The workers were brought to [LOC Iceland  ] using false documents procured by the traffickers and which were seized by the traffickers upon arrival in the country . 
The union chairman said that at least two of the workers had never seen their hiring contracts , and had only received 50-100 thousand [MISC Icelandic  ] kronur ( $443 - $885 ) per month . 
The other three workers did not comment on their pay or working conditions , and police and union officials suspect they were in fact relatives of the restaurant 's owners . 
The union chairman complained to post that [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000049 004 OF 006 police resources -- and perhaps priorities -- were insufficient to see the case to its conclusion . 
No charges were filed by the victims in the case , but police started the investigation on their own accord . 
The police finished the investigation in September and sent the case to the [ORG Metropolitan Police Prosecution Division  ] where it remains as of the end of the reporting period . 
The second , more prominent case during the reporting period involved a female [MISC Icelandic  ] citizen of [MISC Equatorial Guinean  ] descent , who is suspected of having operated brothels in apartments in central [LOC Reykjavik  ] and in the neighboring town of [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] . 
The woman forced four other [MISC Equatorial Guinean  ] women into prostitution . 
In a television interview , the alleged madam confirmed that the women were " entertaining men " but denied that anything improper had taken place . 
Police officials confirmed to post the substance of media reports alleging that in September 2008 the woman employed had three [MISC Icelandic  ] men , who had connections to the narcotics world , assault the four victims and seize their money and passports . 
All four women had a [LOC Schengen  ] area residence permit and were resident in [LOC Iceland  ] at the time of the assault . 
The madam then told the victims that in order to retrieve their passports , they would have to prostitute themselves and use the proceeds to pay 100,000 kronur ( $885 ) each . 
All four were subsequently forced into prostitution . 
One of the victims , who had suffered a miscarriage as a result of the assault , made claims in the media that the madam did not successfully force her into prostitution . 
Police , however , told post that these claims were incorrect . 
The women eventually sought temporary shelter at the country 's sole Women 's Shelter , but their stay was short-lived . 
[ See PROTECTION , B . 
] The victims were still present in [LOC Iceland  ] at the end of the reporting period and were assisting in the case investigation . 
Their passports were recovered by police and returned to them . 
In February , the madam was arrested at [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] on arrival from [LOC Amsterdam  ] on drug-related charges both in [LOC Iceland  ] and abroad . 
She was additionally charged with sexual violence offenses stemming from the prostitution-related allegations . 
She was held in police custody for questioning for one week , and has subsequently been released while the investigation continues . 
SETTING THE SCENE FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ANTI-TIP EFFORTS: -- [PER A. Does  ] the government acknowledge that trafficking is a problem in the country ? 
If not , why not ? 
The government of [LOC Iceland  ] has acknowledged that trafficking is a worldwide problem , including [LOC Iceland  ] . 
That said , the government 's focus on TIP issues remains on victim protection and assistance as in the previous year . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is a signatory to the [MISC Palermo Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime  ] as well as the two [MISC Palermo Protocols  ] on TIP and [PER Migrant Smuggling  ] . 
However , despite the parliament 's approval of ratification of the [MISC Palermo Convention  ] in May 2008 , the government has yet to deposit its instruments of ratification . 
The parliament has yet to ratify the two [MISC Palermo Protocols  ] . 
The greatest commitment to dealing with the problem of TIP has come from the current Prime Minister , who for most of the reporting period was the Minister of [ORG Social Affairs  ] and only assumed her current position in February 2009 . 
As Minister of [ORG Social Affairs  ] , she requested in the fall of 2007 that her ministry become the lead agency on TIP , and announced plans to develop a government-wide action plan on prevention of trafficking in persons and support to TIP victims ( see PREVENTION: D ) Police reports ( such as the [ORG National Commissioner of Police  ] assessment referred to in [MISC Overview A  ] and E above ) note the existence of prostitution connected to international criminal organizations and utilizing foreign prostitutes , and assume that [LOC Iceland  ] is a destination and transit country for TIP as a result . 
During the reporting period , police officials -- such as the District Commissioner for [LOC Sudurnes  ] , which includes the country 's sole international airport -- also frankly stated in media interviews and in interviews with Post that TIP exists in [LOC Iceland  ] , though only in limited numbers . 
-- [PER B. Which  ] government agencies are involved in anti-trafficking efforts and which agency , if any , has the lead ? 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000049 005 OF 006 The following agencies are involved in anti-trafficking efforts: -- [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] ( including the [ORG Equal Rights Office and Directorate of Labor  ] ) : lead agency . 
-- [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( including the [ORG Directorate of Immigration  ] , State Prosecutor 's [ORG Office  ] , and National Commissioner of Police and local police forces . 
-- [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] . 
-- [PER C. What  ] are the limitations on the government 's ability to address this problem in practice ? 
Government efforts to address TIP face two major limitations . 
The first is the lack of a detailed understanding of the problem . 
As noted above , there has been no detailed official information-gathering on the scope of the problem . 
Post concurs with the [MISC Icelandic  ] government and [ORG NGO  ] community 's anecdotal assessment that the problem affects 5-20 victims per year , but has consistently noted the lack of hard statistics . 
Post 's assessment is that the lack of detailed official study of the problem ties into the second major obstacle: a shortage of available police assets in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
For example , the country 's entire local and national police forces have fewer than 800 personnel , including administrative and support staff . 
The [ORG National Police Commissioner 's Office  ] , which has primary responsibility for organized crime and narcotics investigations at the national level , has only three officers in its national security division ( which covers both international organized crime and counterterrorism issues ) and six officers in its narcotics division . 
Given these limitations it is on some levels unsurprising that the police are unable to devote assets exclusively to the problem of TIP . 
The collapse of the [MISC Icelandic  ] financial system in October 2008 and the ramifications of that required police to focus their energies on providing public order and crowd control at political protests that in their scope , number , and intensity were unlike anything the country had seen in the last half-century . 
Allocation of manpower and funds to other fronts , including TIP , thus became very limited , exacerbating previous resource issues . 
Post anticipates that government-wide budget cuts and already-announced police layoffs will only worsen this situation over the coming year . 
Previously , funding for police and other institutions that handle TIP issues was adequate for a reactive approach but inadequate to fund active measures to prevent potential new cases . 
The January 2007 launch of an intelligence and analytical unit within the office of the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner , intended to strengthen proactive measures to combat international organized crime , has improved [ORG National Police  ] and [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] awareness of organized crime problems . 
However , some local police commissioners have in the past noted to post that they have seen little direct benefit from the intelligence and analytical unit , and that cooperation between national and local levels on TIP and other organized crime issues could be improved greatly . 
The [ORG Reykjavik Metropolitan Police  ] say they have a close relationship with other police districts , and this would also apply in the case of possible TIP issues . 
Programs to provide emergency shelter and crime victim compensation , which in theory could be used to help TIP victims , have rarely been tested in the trafficking context . 
Given this resource shortage , police are likely directed to focus their limited assets elsewhere . 
[ORG NGO  ] sources observed to post that [MISC Icelandic  ] police do not question possible TIP victims - such as foreign prostitutes purportedly employed by a third party - to find out if they are trafficking victims , but instead quickly deport them on other grounds . 
Police sources confirmed this claim . 
-- [PER D. To  ] what extent does the government systematically monitor its anti-trafficking efforts ? 
There is no systematic government monitoring of anti-trafficking efforts as such - i.e. , none beyond ordinary recordkeeping as to laws proposed and passed . 
Primary responsibility for anti-trafficking work currently lies with the [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] , which oversees victim protection and assistance . 
Post expects that the national anti-TIP action plan currently being drafted ( see PREVENTION D ) will include measures to systematically monitor government anti-TIP efforts .
