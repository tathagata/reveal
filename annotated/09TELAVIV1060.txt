[PER WEXLER  ] DISCUSSES [LOC IRAN  ] WITH IDF INTELLIGENCE CHIEF [PER YADLIN  ] Classified By: DCM [PER Luis G  ] , [PER Moreno  ] , Reason 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Representative [PER Robert Wexler  ] ( D , [LOC Florida  ] ) , accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff [PER Joshua Rogin  ] and DCM [PER Moreno  ] , met with [ORG Israel Defense Forces Intelligence  ] Chief , MG [PER Amos Yadlin  ] , on Sunday 10 May 2009 . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] focused his discussion on the preparations for the upcoming visit of Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] to the [LOC United States  ] and the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] informed [PER Rep. Wexler  ] that the PM was preparing intensely for his upcoming visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
In addition to hours of policy review , the PM had been provided significant amounts of intelligence from the [ORG IDI  ] and [PER Mossad  ] on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
The intelligence presented included assessments of the current status of the [MISC Iranian  ] program ; timelines , effects of sanctions ; views of the international community ; and outcomes of engagement . 
The differences that exist between the intelligence community in interpretations of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program as well as the relationship between [LOC Iran  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] were also presented . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] indicated that the IDF had presented its information last week , leaving the cabinet on Friday 08 May 2009 to consider policy options and how information will be presented during the upcoming visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
Although no direct feedback was provided , [ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] opined that the PM appears determined on [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rep. Wexler  ] asked [ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] to expand on the differences in the interpretations of the intelligence . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] explained that until 2003 , [LOC Iran  ] had violated the [ORG Nuclear Proliferation Treaty  ] by having a weaponization group and although [LOC Iran  ] could show civilian uses for a missile program and a fissile program , there was no justification for a weaponization group . 
He went on to say that [LOC Iran  ] halted its program in 2003 after the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] , but reinvigorated the program in 2005 . 
He expressed that some in the [LOC US  ] agree with this and others do not . 
He went on to explain that [LOC Israel  ] is not in a position to underestimate [LOC Iran  ] and be surprised like the [LOC US  ] was on 11 September 2001. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] explained that [LOC Israel  ] tries to be more precise than the [LOC US  ] in estimating [LOC Iran  ] 's intentions and timeline for obtaining a nuclear bomb . 
[LOC Iran  ] is in the position of wanting to pay only a minimum cost for its current program . 
It does not want to be [LOC North Korea  ] or what [LOC Iraq  ] was before 2003 . 
[LOC Iran  ] intends to keep resolutions and sanctions at a certain manageable level and continue to produce low enriched uranium until there is enough for several bombs . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] stated that [LOC Iran  ] could decide to produce a bomb by 2010 , but [LOC Iran  ] is waiting for the right time in the future and that there are some who will always doubt it despite the evidence. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rep. Wexler  ] then asked about the prospect of engagement . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] said he does not oppose engagement , and in fact gave a speech approximately six months ago expressing that [LOC Israel  ] needed to find a way to find positives in engagement . 
He feels there needs to be an agreed upon deadline ; a measure for success or failure ; and a plan B if engagement does not work in order for engagement to have any chance . 
He also expressed strongly that engagement should have already started . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] outlined four possible outcomes of engagement . 
Two good outcomes would be the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program stopped or a failure of engagement that allows [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] to see the [LOC US  ] made all efforts to prevent the program diplomatically and allows for greater cooperation in the future . 
Two bad outcomes would be [LOC Iran  ] playing for time with no claim of failure on the part of engagement or a bad bargain that still allows [LOC Iran  ] to obtain a nuclear bomb even if in a longer timeline . 
[PER Rep. Wexler  ] went on to discuss that there is a third good option in that the President may have better leverage with the [MISC American  ] public to support action if engagement efforts are attempted and failed . 
[PER Rep Wexler  ] recommended that the [MISC Israeli  ] people need to consider the [LOC US  ] perspective and public opinion . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Yadlin  ] responded that he is not recommending the [LOC US  ] enter a third front , but it has to be understood that [LOC Israel  ] sees things differently and that [LOC Israel  ] has to be ready and can not remove the military option from the table . 
[PER Rep Wexler  ] stated that he expected [LOC Israel  ] would be pleasantly surprised by the President 's acceptance of all possible options in regards to [LOC Iran.  ] ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM</pre></code>
