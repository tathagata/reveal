( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: Secretary of Defense [PER Robert Gates  ] ( [ORG SecDef  ] ) met with [MISC Italian  ] Minister of Foreign Affairs [PER Franco Frattini  ] during an official visit to [LOC Rome  ] on February 8 . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Frattini  ] was eager to move beyond the [ORG London Conference  ] and work to produce practical results for the [MISC Afghan  ] people . 
He proposed better civil-military coordination at senior levels in [ORG NATO  ] , and raised the prospect of coordination on local projects across the [MISC Afghanistan-Iran  ] border . 
[ORG SecDef  ] thanked [PER Frattini  ] for [LOC Italy  ] 's pledge of more troops for operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and explained where gaps in civil-military cooperation existed . 
[PER Frattini  ] believed the international community was lining up against [LOC Iran  ] , and encouraged better coordination with countries outside the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] warned that a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] would lead to greater proliferation in the [LOC Middle East  ] , war , or both . 
[ORG SecDef  ] agreed with [PER Frattini  ] that a [ORG United Nations  ] conference highlighting security challenges in the [LOC Horn of Africa  ] was a good idea . 
END SUMMARY. ------------ [LOC Afghanistan  ] ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Frattini  ] opened by telling [ORG SecDef  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] can count on [LOC Italy  ] 's full support on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and fighting terror . 
He had recently talked with General Jones and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and relayed the same message . 
He expressed a desire to focus on the comprehensive approach in such a way to improve the daily lives of [MISC Afghans  ] . 
He asserted a need to press President [PER Karzai  ] on delivering improved governance or risk losing support for the mission in coalition [ORG Parliaments  ] . 
[PER Frattini  ] wanted to get beyond " just talking " -- referencing the [LOC London  ] conference -- and noted concrete [MISC Italian  ] projects to convert poppy cultivation to olive oil production and to create a national high school for public administration. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] commended [LOC Rome  ] 's efforts to increase [MISC Italian  ] contributions , asking whether even more [PER Carabinieri  ] might be available for training the [MISC Afghan  ] security forces . 
He observed that General [PER McChrystal  ] 's emphasis on protecting [MISC Afghan  ] civilians has changed attitudes among Allied publics . 
[ORG SecDef  ] said he is pushing the comprehensive approach , noting a need for all stakeholders in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to share information effectively . 
He said he hoped that [ORG NATO  ] 's new Senior Civilian Representative , Ambassador [PER Mark Sedwill  ] , could facilitate this . 
[ORG SecDef  ] recommended a focus on better governance below the level of the national government -- which would take decades to turn into a modern government ) taking advantage of traditional institutions and competent governors at the regional and sub-regional levels and leveraging them into local success stories . 
At the national level , however , our priority should be to develop those ministries most critical to our success , such as Defense , Interior , Finance , Agriculture , and Health . 
Noting Gen. [PER McChrystal  ] 's recent statement that the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is no longer deteriorating , [ORG SecDef  ] said that much of the challenge is psychological -- convincing [MISC Afghans  ] that we can win and that we will not abandon them. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Frattini  ] agreed that civilian-military integration is the weakest part of the [MISC Afghan  ] strategy . 
He expressed frustration that [ORG NATO  ] foreign ministers only discuss issues like agriculture and education while defense ministers only discuss security . 
The problem , [PER Frattini  ] suggested , is that they don't talk to each other . 
He proposed a joint meeting of foreign and defense ministers , beginning with talks at the expert level . 
[ORG SecDef  ] responded that Gen. [PER McChrystal  ] and Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] do civilian-military collaboration at the national level on the basis of a [ORG Joint Campaign Plan  ] , as do local ground commanders with leaders of PRTs . 
What is missing is the level in between -- the regional commands -- and [ORG SecDef  ] expressed a desire for [PER Sedwill  ] to appoint subordinates to address this in each [ORG RC  ] , building on the [LOC ROME  ] 00000173 002.2 OF 003 example of the civ-mil cell in [LOC RC-South  ] . 
The effect would be cascading civil-military coordination at the national , regional , and local levels . 
[ORG SecDef  ] noted that similar efforts by [ORG UNSRSG Kai Eide  ] had been hamstrung by resourcing and the [ORG UN  ] 's aversion to working with the military . 
As a [ORG NATO  ] representative , [PER Sedwill  ] should not have these problems. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Frattini  ] also asked about practical cooperation across the [MISC Afghan-Iranian  ] border . 
Local incentives for cooperation might undermine weapons and drug trafficking and help co-opt reconcilable [ORG Taliban  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] is playing both sides of the street -- trying to be friendly with the [LOC Afghanistan  ] government while trying to undermine ISAF efforts . 
He noted that intelligence indicated there was little lethal material crossing the [MISC Afghanistan-Iran  ] border . 
[ORG SecDef  ] suggested that trade route protection from [LOC Afghanistan  ] into [ORG Eastern Iran  ] , which is important for local economies on both sides of the border , might be a place to start . 
[ORG SecDef  ] noted that any effort will need to be coordinated with [LOC Kabul  ] . 
[PER Frattini  ] agreed this would be a good starting point. ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Frattini  ] supported recent public statements by [ORG SecDef  ] raising the pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
He declared that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] cannot be trusted , especially after contradicting recent constructive statements by his own government . 
[PER Frattini  ] , citing a recent conversation with [MISC Russian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] , said he believed [LOC Russia  ] would support the sanctions track . 
The challenge was to bring [LOC China  ] on board ; [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] , in [PER Frattini  ] 's view , were critical to the adoption of measures that would affect the government without hurting [MISC Iranian  ] civil society . 
He also specifically proposed including [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] in the conversation . 
He expressed particular frustration with [LOC Ankara  ] 's " double game " of outreach to both [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Frattini  ] proposed an informal meeting of [LOC Middle East  ] countries , who were keen to be consulted on [LOC Iran  ] , and noted that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] was in agreement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] emphasized that a [ORG UNSC  ] resolution was important because it would give the [ORG European Union  ] and nations a legal platform on which to impose even harsher sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] pointedly warned that urgent action is required . 
Without progress in the next few months , we risk nuclear proliferation in the [LOC Middle East  ] , war prompted by an [MISC Israeli  ] strike , or both . 
[ORG SecDef  ] predicted " a different world " in 4-5 years if [LOC Iran  ] developed nuclear weapons . 
[ORG SecDef  ] stated that he recently delivered the same warning to PM [PER Erdogan  ] , and he agreed with [PER Frattini  ] 's assessment on [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC China  ] , noting that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is more important to both [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Moscow  ] than [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] urged [PER Frattini  ] to reconsider a planned visit to [LOC Italy  ] by a prominent [MISC Iranian  ] Parliamentarian in the wake of recent executions of students in opposition to the government . 
At the same time , we needed to ensure we did not discredit the opposition by creating the impression that they are the tools of foreign partners. -------------- [ORG Horn of Africa  ] -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Frattini  ] expressed concern about deteriorating conditions in [LOC Somalia  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] . 
He noted a recent conversation with President [PER Sharif  ] of [LOC Somalia  ] 's [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) , in which [PER Sharif  ] said that he would be unable to pay his security forces by the end of February . 
[PER Frattini  ] said that [LOC Italy  ] was encouraging the [ORG EU Presidency  ] to focus on [LOC Somalia  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] , and had proposed a [ORG United Nations  ] conference addressing [ORG Horn of Africa  ] security issues . 
[LOC Italy  ] was providing funding to the [ORG TFG  ] 's national budget . 
[ORG SecDef  ] concurred that the region deserved more focus .
