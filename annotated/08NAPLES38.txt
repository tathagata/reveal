REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: This is the third of a three-part series ( see reftels A-B for parts I and II ) ; this message offers views on how to combat organized crime in [LOC Italy  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] has a significant stake in the fight against organized crime in [LOC Italy  ] . 
The [MISC Italian  ] crime syndicates help support terrorist groups in [LOC Colombia  ] and [ORG Central Asia  ] through drug trafficking ; violate the intellectual property rights of [MISC American  ] businesses and artists ; buttress organized crime in the [LOC United States  ] ; pose potential public health risks to [LOC U.S.  ] military and dependents stationed in southern [LOC Italy  ] ; and weaken an important ally . 
Law enforcement cooperation has led to many important arrests , particularly in [LOC Sicily  ] , but could be strengthened . 
However , the apprehension of criminals is not enough . 
Trials need to be swifter and sentences tougher . 
The seizure of mob assets , not only in [LOC Southern Italy  ] but in the [LOC North  ] and in other countries , is another way to hit hard at these groups , and the economy needs to offer young people an honest alternative to crime . 
Education and awareness-raising among politicians , average citizens and students are essential elements to any successful strategy against organized crime . 
The [MISC Italian Catholic  ] Church can also play a more prominent role , as a couple of brave clerics have demonstrated . 
We can also publicly support grassroots strategies to foster a societal rejection of organized crime . 
ConGen [LOC Naples  ] strongly supports [ORG OFAC  ] 's decision to add the 'Ndrangheta to its Drug Kingpin list . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The first two cables in this three-part series were descriptive , explaining how organized crime is the greatest threat to economic growth in [LOC Southern Italy  ] . 
This message is prescriptive , proposing a multi-faceted approach to more effectively combat organized crime in [LOC Italy  ] . 
Specifically , we propose consideration of the following tactics as part of a multi-faceted approach by the USG: -- Publicly acknowleding both the scope of [LOC Italy  ] 's organized crime problem and [ORG USG  ] support for [MISC Italian  ] efforts to combat it . 
-- The committing of greater resources to law enforcement cooperation with [LOC Italy  ] . 
-- Fostering closer cooperation between [MISC Italian  ] law enforcement officials and counterparts in other key countries . 
-- Conveying to the [ORG GOI  ] the view that it has far too few anti-Mafia magistrates in [LOC Calabria  ] , home to the country 's largest criminal organization . 
-- Pressing the [ORG GOI  ] to root out corruption at its ports . 
-- Cooperating more closely with [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] , and pressing other countries ( e.g. , [LOC Switzerland  ] , [LOC Liechtenstein  ] , [LOC Monaco  ] ) to cooperate more , in order to crack down on money laundering . 
-- Working with the [ORG GOI  ] to improve a flawed judicial system . 
If organized crime is to be brought under control , sentences must be tougher , appeals limited , and the judicial process made more efficient . 
Convicted prisoners cannot be set free because judges failed to complete paperwork on time . 
-- Sharing the [ORG USG  ] experience on penal institutions . 
One of [LOC Italy  ] 's biggest problems is a lack of prisons , which means many of the accused are never jailed and many convicts are released far in advance of completing their sentences . 
-- Giving more visible support for grassroots efforts to fight organized crime ( e.g. , groups in [LOC Sicily  ] that are leading a public rebellion against paying extortion ) . 
[ORG NAPLES  ] 00000038 002.2 OF 008 -- Helping raise public awareness about the deleterious effects of organized crime and how it has been dealt with in the [LOC United States  ] . 
-- Enlisting the assistance of the [MISC Roman Catholic  ] Church to be more outspoken against organized crime . 
-- Encouraging the [ORG GOI  ] and [ORG EU  ] to invest in infrastructure , particularly improvements to public security , in southern [LOC Italy  ] and at the same time to tighten accountability for how this money is spent . 
Why We Should Care ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] can and should become more engaged for several key reasons: -- Drug trafficking by [MISC Italian  ] mobs sends money to narcotraffickers ( and thus indirectly to terrorist groups ) in [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , affecting [LOC U.S.  ] national security . 
-- A 2005 [ORG FBI  ] intelligence assessment reported that " Criminal interaction between [MISC Italian  ] organized crime and [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups provides potential terrorists with access to funding and logistical support from criminal organizations with established smuggling routes and an entrenched presence in the [LOC United States  ] . 
" In a public statement given on April 19 , 2004 , [LOC Italy  ] 's national anti-Mafia prosecutor , [PER Pierluigi Vigna  ] , indicated a link between [MISC Islamic  ] militant groups and the [LOC Camorra  ] , stating that evidence existed implicating the [LOC Camorra  ] in an exchange of weapons for drugs with [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist groups . 
-- Counterfeiting and piracy of [MISC American-made  ] products ( particularly movies , music and software ) directly impact [LOC U.S.  ] economic interests . 
-- Ties between [MISC Italian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] organized crime mutually reinforce these groups . 
The links between the [ORG Sicilian Cosa Nostra  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] Mafia go back nearly a century , but the [LOC Camorra  ] and 'Ndrangheta also have affiliates in the [LOC United States  ] , according to the [ORG FBI  ] . 
-- Amcit residents ( including thousands of Navy personnel and their families in [LOC Campania  ] and [LOC Sicily  ] ) and tourists are affected by street crime and potentially by the [LOC Campania  ] waste crisis ( which result in large part from organized crime -- see reftels ) and illegal toxic dumping in the region . 
-- [LOC U.S.  ] businesses that would like to invest in [LOC Southern Italy  ] refrain from doing so because of concerns about organized crime . 
-- Organized crime weakens an important ally politically , economically and socially . 
Why Law Enforcement Alone is Not Enough ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In its efforts to defeat organized crime , the [MISC Italian  ] government has been most successful in [LOC Apulia  ] , where the [MISC Sacra Corona  ] [ORG Unita  ] has been mostly dismantled , and [LOC Sicily  ] , where a multi-faceted approach has led to the arrests of dozens of [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] bosses , important seizures of mob assets , and a growing rebellion by business owners against the protection racket . 
Law enforcement has been one of the keys to progress in [LOC Sicily  ] , where authorities cracked down following the 1992 mob assassinations of anti-Mafia prosecutors [PER Giovanni Falcone  ] and [PER Paolo Borsellino  ] . 
Wiretapping , plea-bargaining agreements , the strengthening of a witness protection program , and greater [ORG NAPLES  ] 00000038 003.2 OF 008 security for judges and prosecutors have resulted in the apprehension of hundreds of Mafia members and associates . 
The captures of top bosses [PER Toto Riina  ] in 1993 , [PER Bernardo Provenzano  ] in 2006 , and [PER Salvatore Lo Piccolo  ] in 2007 proved to be significant blows to an organization built on a pyramidal hierarchy . 
However , law enforcement successes have not been the only factor in [LOC Sicily  ] 's progress against organized crime . 
[MISC Sicilian  ] citizens' efforts to reject the Mafia are finally getting traction . 
The [ORG Industrialists Confederation  ] ( [ORG Confindustria  ] ) has started expelling members who have paid protection money and not complained to police . 
At least two new anti-racket NGOs have been formed , one by consumers and one by business owners ( more below ) . 
And even the Church , long considered complicit for not refusing to preside at lavish Mafia funerals , has seen a bishop forced to seek police protection for just that. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The situation is starkly different in [LOC Campania  ] and [LOC Calabria  ] . 
Because the [LOC Camorra  ] in [LOC Campania  ] is not one organization , but a multitude of armed gangs , there is no one boss whose capture could cause a significant blow to organized crime in the region . 
The war on the 'Ndrangheta in [LOC Calabria  ] has been even more difficult . 
With members recruited on the basis of family ties , the 'Ndrangheta is virtually impervious to police infiltration . 
" Every cell is composed of people who belong to family , and this is why there are no justice collaborators , " according to [PER Nicola Gratteri  ] , [LOC Calabria  ] 's senior anti-Mafia prosecutor , who adds that only 42 turncoats have come from the 'Ndrangheta , compared with 700 to 1,000 from the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] and 2,000 from the [LOC Camorra  ] . 
It would be difficult to completely duplicate the [MISC Sicilian  ] strategy in [LOC Campania  ] and [LOC Calabria  ] , but what is clear is that relying merely on arrests is not enough . 
As another anti-Mafia prosecutor , [MISC Catania-based  ] [PER Giuseppe Gennaro  ] , told us , " You can apprehend mobsters , but most are released within five years . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Law enforcement alone , however , cannot solve [LOC Italy  ] 's organized crime problem . 
[LOC Apulia  ] 's success in dismantling [MISC Santa Corona  ] [ORG Unita  ] was certainly facilitated by economic development which offered its citizens an honest alternative ; it is southern [LOC Italy  ] 's principal economic success story ( ref C ) . 
[LOC Cosenza  ] sociology professor [PER Giap Parini  ] explained to us that any overall strategy must include political , economic , and socio-cultural components in addition to law enforcement elements . 
Banco di [ORG Napoli President  ] [PER Antonio Nucci  ] told the [ORG CG  ] that " the police can lock up all the people they want , but it won't be enough if crime is the only job that pays . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A multi-faceted approach must necessarily include components designed to change public attitudes towards organized crime . 
[PER Ivan Lo Bello  ] , the President of the [ORG Sicilian Industrialists Confederation  ] , told us in December 2007 that the first step is to " reject the fatalist perspective that things cannot change . 
To defeat the Mafia , you need society to band together . 
Sanction by society hurts more than sanction by the state . 
Gaining greater consensus is the solution , not bringing in the army . 
" With this in mind , the prescription must include education and awareness-raising , and support for grassroots organizations that are standing up to the criminals . 
Law Enforcement Approaches -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As noted above , law enforcement successes have been one of the keys to the progress in [LOC Sicily  ] . 
A February 2008 joint [MISC U.S.-Italian  ] sting , called " [LOC Operation Old Bridge  ] , " resulted in the arrests of over 80 suspects in the [LOC United States  ] and over 30 in [LOC Sicily  ] , and exposed attempts by the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] to reestablish ties with [LOC New York  ] 's [LOC Gambino  ] family that would have increased drug trafficking to [LOC Italy  ] . 
Ironically , there are [ORG NAPLES  ] 00000038 004.2 OF 008 significantly more anti-Mafia prosecutors and magistrates in [LOC Sicily  ] and [LOC Campania  ] than in [LOC Calabria  ] , where the largest and most dangerous mob , the 'Ndrangheta , is based . 
The [ORG USG  ] should consider: -- Greater cooperation with [MISC Italian  ] authorities ( on the order of " [MISC Old Bridge  ] " ) , committing more resources and intelligence-sharing to fighting the [LOC Camorra  ] and the 'Ndrangheta ; we could also foster much closer cooperation between [MISC Italian  ] authorities and their counterparts in [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Albania  ] , [LOC Bulgaria  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere . 
At least two prosecutors have complained to us about the ineffectiveness of authorities in [LOC Spain  ] to combat drug trafficking by [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] organized crime groups . 
( Comment: [ORG DEA  ] , by contrast , has found [LOC Spain  ] to be an outstanding partner in international drug investigations . 
The issue may be one of poor cooperation , rather than any lack of dedication or competence on either side . 
End comment . 
) -- The need to impress on [MISC Italian  ] authorities that far more law enforcement resources are needed in [LOC Calabria  ] , including dramatically increased numbers of anti-Mafia judges and prosecutors . 
-- Pressing [MISC Italian  ] authorities to root out corruption at [LOC Italy  ] 's ports . 
There are [ORG USG Container Security Initiative  ] officials present at some ports , but they are focused on containers destined for the [LOC United States  ] . 
Having seen the tight security at [LOC Calabria  ] 's [LOC Gioia Tauro  ] port ( ref A ) , ConGen [LOC Naples  ] believes that the reported in-flow of narcotics there can only be done with the assistance and complicity of corrupt personnel . 
Financial and [ORG Economic Strategies  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Anti-Mafia prosecutor [PER Gennaro  ] believes that seizure of assets is a much more important weapon than arrests . 
" To defeat the Mafia , you have to attack their profits and investments , " he told us in [LOC Catania  ] , [LOC Sicily  ] in January 2008 . 
[PER Gennaro  ] expressed frustration over the discovery that many banks in [LOC Italy  ] do not report suspicious transactions to the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
It has also been very difficult for [MISC Italian  ] authorities to obtain information from banking authorities in [LOC Switzerland  ] , [LOC Liechtenstein  ] and [LOC Monaco  ] , where Mafia members stash away their earnings in secret accounts . 
In February 2008 , the [ORG Treasury Police  ] in [LOC Sicily  ] confiscated mob assets with an estimated worth of nearly 309 million euros ( USD 487 million ) -- " a tremendous blow , " according to then-Interior Minister [PER Giuliano Amato  ] , one that could lead to " a crisis for the entire organization . 
" Unfortunately , confiscations of this sort happen much less frequently in [LOC Campania  ] and [LOC Calabria  ] , let alone in northern [LOC Italy  ] , where much of the money laundering takes place . 
The [ORG USG  ] should consider: -- Working more closely with [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] and [ORG Fiscal Police  ] , perhaps via greater sharing of intelligence and information obtained from investigations , to identify organized crime assets and ensure that they are frozen or confiscated . 
-- Adding all three major [MISC Italian  ] mobs to the Office of [ORG Foreign Assets Control 's Drug Kingpin  ] list . 
[ORG OFAC  ] has included the 'Ndrangheta on the Tier One list , which could eventually lead to sanctions on companies dealing with the organization and front companies that launder money . 
The 'Ndrangheta is by all accounts one of [LOC Western Europe  ] 's biggest drug trafficking groups , but the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] and [ORG Camorra  ] are also heavily engaged in the narcotics trade . 
-- Reinforcing and re-orienting existing programs such as the [ORG NAPLES  ] 00000038 005.2 OF 008 [MISC Partnership for Growth  ] , to increase economic growth , which will create more well-paying alternatives to organized crime . 
[LOC Judicial Weapons  ] ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In February 2008 , the son of [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] boss [PER Toto Riina  ] was released from jail under a law that frees those who have been held for five years without a trial , and a prosecutor was recently skewered by the press for allowing several Mafia cases to expire ( resulting in the release of suspects ) . 
[MISC Naples-based  ] former Senator [PER Lorenzo Diana  ] , an organized crime expert , believes that the [MISC Italian  ] justice system needs quicker trials and stiffer sentences . 
And [PER Gratteri  ] ( the top anti-Mafia prosecutor in [LOC Calabria  ] ) contends that , in order to bring down the 'Ndrangheta , new legislation is needed . 
" We have no laws that are proportional to the force of the 'Ndrangheta , " he told us , echoing [PER Gennaro  ] 's lament that well-behaved convicts can leave prison after five years . 
" I would like .. . 
[ them ] not to be released before 30 years . 
" [PER Diana  ] also believes the system that conducts background checks on those bidding on government contracts is not working . 
Unfortunately , the country 's politicians are not focused on these issues , as was clear from the March-April 2008 election campaign in which organized crime was barely mentioned . 
Strengthening the efficiency of the judiciary and its ability to impose stronger sentences should be a priority for the next parliament . 
Furthermore , [LOC Italy  ] must improve civil and criminal courts to enforce commercial contracts , consumer protections , criminal law , health and safety standards , building codes , and general quality-of-life standards . 
As long as the court systems are dysfunctional , it will be impossible to reduce organized crime to a manageable level. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) We may also want to consider sharing with the [ORG GOI  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] experience in construction , management and privatization of prisons . 
One of the most serious issues facing [MISC Italian  ] law enforcement is the lack of prisons . 
At the end of 2007 , according to the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] , [MISC Italian  ] jails held 113 inmates for every 100 beds . 
In 2006 , the [ORG GOI  ] granted early release to several thousand convicts in an effort to alleviate the overcrowding ; MOJ statistics show the recividism rate to be 31 percent . 
A Carabinieri colonel complained to the CG in April 2008 that police are frustrated by their inability to keep accused or suspected mobsters in jail because of the lack of cells . 
Support for [LOC Grassroots Change  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG Lo Bello  ] , the President of the [MISC Sicilian  ] [LOC Confindustria  ] , took the bold step in September 2007 of instituting a policy ( adopted by unanimous vote ) of expelling members who have paid protection money to the Mafia and not complained to police . 
Since that time , around 35 members have been asked to leave the [ORG Confederation  ] . 
This courageous move has been praised by business owners , the media and political leaders . 
[ORG Lo Bello  ] told us in January 2008 that " The time has come [ for [LOC Sicily  ] ] to move from an archaic , feudal past to modernity . 
" When we met with them in late 2007 , the [ORG Calabrian Industrialists  ] were much more timid , looking over their backs before telling us that the time is not right for business owners to take a public stand against extortion there . 
( In June 2006 , one of the founders of the [LOC Calabria  ] anti-racket association , [PER Fedele Scarcella  ] , was brutally assassinated ; his charred corpse was discovered in his burned car in what authorities described as " very probably a Mafia homicide . 
" ) Nonetheless , the media reported in March 2008 on talks between the two regions' [ORG Industrialists Confederations  ] on collaborating against organized crime . 
[ORG Lo Bello  ] was quoted as declaring , " It may seem simple , but what has happened has [ORG NAPLES  ] 00000038 006.2 OF 008 changed the framework of the entire region: the idea that the fight against the Mafia cannot be delegated only to the State , but needs to include an assumption of responsibility on the part of [MISC Southern Italian  ] society: in this case , the world of entrepreneurship . 
" Also in March , the [ORG Industrialists Confederation  ] in [ORG Caserta  ] ( [LOC Campania  ] ) took initial steps toward a similar policy , drawing praise from the anti-Mafia prosecutor . 
[ORG Lo Bello  ] hopes to enlist other business and trade associations to adopt similar rules . 
Unfortunately , most [MISC Sicilian  ] business owners are still unwilling to complain about extortion . 
In May 2008 , a prominent businessman , [PER Vincenzo Conticello  ] , who has refused to pay protection money for his [ORG Palermo  ] focaccia restaurant , told the CG that he had heard ( probably from his police escort ) that of 170 companies named in the accounting books of apprehended Mafia boss [PER Salvatore Lo Piccolo  ] , only three have owned up to it , while the others claim the accounts are in error. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Sicilian  ] businesses , emboldened by the arrests of top Mafia bosses , are openly defying the Mafia by signing on with a grassroots organization called " [MISC Addiopizzo  ] " ( Goodbye " [PER Pizzo  ] , " the [MISC Italian  ] word for extortion payments ) , which brings together businesses in [ORG Palermo  ] that are resisting extortion . 
The campaign was launched in 2004 by a group of youths thinking of opening a pub . 
They started off by plastering [ORG Palermo  ] with anti-pizzo fliers , reading " AN ENTIRE PEOPLE THAT PAYS THE PIZZO IS A PEOPLE WITHOUT DIGNITY , " and eventually brought their campaign online where it struck a chord with [MISC Sicilians  ] fed up with [MISC Mafia  ] bullying . 
The rebellion has since spread to other strongholds of the most ruthless Mafia clans , including places such as [PER Gela  ] , an industrial coastal town , where some 80 business owners in recent months have denounced extortion attempts . 
This is a dramatic turn since the early 1990 's , when a [PER Gela  ] merchant who denounced extortion was slain by the Mafia , and a [PER Gela  ] car dealer , whose showroom was repeatedly torched , had to move his family and change his name after he testified in court . 
" [MISC Addiopizzo  ] " has recently launched a supermarket selling products certified as being " pizzo " free , and maintains a public list on the internet of businesses rejecting extortion . 
Another NGO was launched last November by forty [MISC Sicilian  ] business owners to assist entrepreneurs who refuse to pay extortion money . 
The group is called " [PER Libero Futuro  ] , " which translates " Free Future , " but also pays homage to [PER Libero Grassi  ] , a [MISC Sicilian  ] businessman who was murdered in 1991 for refusing to pay protection money . 
In response to the organization 's founding , [ORG Palermo  ] mayor [PER Diego Cammarata  ] promised 50,000 euros to assist merchants who have been victims of extortion . 
" This rebellion goes to the heart of the Mafia , " says [ORG Palermo  ] prosecutor [PER Maurizio De Lucia  ] , who has investigated extortion cases for years . 
" If it works , we will have a great advantage in the fight against the Mafia . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For authorities battling the 'Ndrangheta , a welcome ally has been " [PER Ammazzateci Tutti  ] , " ( " [MISC Kill Us All  ] " ) formed three years ago by fed-up young people in the wake of the mob assassination of [LOC Calabria  ] regional Vice President [PER Fortugno  ] . 
In a recent news interview , [PER Bruno Marino  ] , a student whose father was killed by the 'Ndrangheta , likened the 'Ndrangheta to " an octopus that tries to control everything and to kill all of the fish . 
" Since its founding , [PER Ammazzateci Tutti  ] has held regular demonstrations designed to pressure the [MISC Italian  ] state into taking action against the 'Ndrangheta. In February 2007 , a protest in [LOC Reggio Calabria  ] drew thousands into the streets . 
Later in the year , the group staged regular protests against the government 's pending transfer of [PER Luigi De Magistris  ] , an anti-Mafia prosecutor investigating links between politicians and the 'Ndrangheta . 
" [PER Ammazzateci Tutti  ] is a message that expresses both hope and challenge to the 'Ndrangheta , saying , 'See if you have enough lead to kill us all , ' " according to [PER Aldo Pecora  ] , a law student and spokesman for the group . 
" It is also a challenge to normal people to rebel against the the [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000038 007.2 OF 008 'Ndrangheta . 
" These groups are having an impact , but they remain fledgling organizations with little official backing . 
The [ORG USG  ] can lend public support to these groups ( a member of [MISC Addiopizzo  ] , for example , was selected for the [ORG State Department  ] 's [ORG International Visitor  ] program . 
) Education and Public Awareness ------------------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Many of our interlocutors believe that the long-term solution to organized crime is education . 
This means breaking the pervasive culture of organized crime which controls societies through power and fear . 
It means destroying the glamorous image that young people have of Mafia bosses and more openly and directly supporting those who defy the Mafia . 
It means getting consumers to realize that the prices of a bottle of olive oil , a jar of tomato sauce , a bottle of wine -- the staples of [MISC Italian  ] life -- have been inflated by organized crime , or that the products themselves have been adulterated by the same sources . 
It also means breaking the culture of illegality that is so rampant in [LOC Southern Italy  ] but also felt countrywide ; that is , the blatant disregard for the law by average citizens and the lack of a sense of civic responsibility . 
[LOC Naples  ] Chief Prosecutor [PER GianDomenico Lepore  ] told the CG -- while lighting a cigar in a no-smoking office to underscore his point -- that [MISC Neapolitans  ] have something " in their [MISC DNA  ] " that causes them to react to any law by breaking it . 
[LOC Campania  ] Carabinieri General [PER Franco Mottola  ] told the CG that the [ORG Camorra  ] exploits a general atmosphere of delinquency in [LOC Naples  ] . 
He suggested the change needed to start in the schools , but added that first teacher training would be required ( " they can't teach what they don't know " ) . 
We could perhaps encourage the [MISC Italian  ] government to make greater outreach efforts in poor neighborhoods , and to offer alternatives to a life of crime for young people . 
There is a conspicuous lack of a visible police presence throughout [LOC Naples  ] , and there have been countless cases of [MISC Neapolitans  ] protecting criminals from police trying to apprehend them. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) Instead of Mafia dons , those fighting them need to be regarded as the real role models . 
[PER Roberto Saviano  ] , whose book " [LOC Gomorrah  ] " was an international best-seller in 2007 , may be well on his way . 
He appears regularly in print and broadcast media as not just an authority on the mob , but more importantly as a moral compass for those willing to listen . 
The film version , released in May 2008 , will probably have an even bigger impact , as it underscores the [ORG Camorra  ] 's influence in toxic waste dumping and features hip young actors and a score by popular musicians . 
[PER Saviano  ] 's book and the film ( for which he wrote the screenplay ) are also keys to convincing [MISC Italians  ] that organized crime is not just a southern problem , but an [MISC Italian  ] problem . 
When asked how the [ORG USG  ] could best assist in the fight against organized crime beyond law enforcement cooperation , [PER Saviano  ] told the CG in April 2008 , " Just talking about it , you give the issue a credibility that the rest of the world , including the [MISC Italians  ] , cannot ignore . 
" The Role of the [MISC Church  ] ----------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The [MISC Italian  ] Catholic Church has often come under fire for not taking a stronger public stance against organized crime . 
One of the few priests who have , [PER Father Luigi Merola  ] , is now under police escort after working against the [ORG Camorra  ] in the poor [LOC Naples  ] neighborhood of [LOC Forcella  ] . 
In February 2008 , he inaugurated a foundation for at-risk youth in the confiscated villa of a former [ORG Camorra  ] boss . 
ConGen [LOC Naples  ] and local [LOC U.S.  ] Navy personnel are lending their support to the foundation by volunteering to teach [MISC English  ] , build sports facilities and coach the kids who participate in the foundation 's programs , which are [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000038 008.2 OF 008 designed to offer the kids an alternative to crime . 
Another [MISC Church  ] official , Bishop [PER Michele Pennisi  ] of [PER Piazza Armerina  ] in [LOC Sicily  ] , is also under police escort after refusing to preside over funerals of mafiosi . 
We may want to consider seeking greater [MISC Church  ] cooperation against organized crime , perhaps through channels at the [LOC Holy See  ] or with [MISC Italian  ] Church leaders . 
" Heal the Periphery " - Improve Infrastructure --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] and [ORG European Union  ] should be encouraged to review the way public money is invested in [LOC Southern Italy  ] . 
As noted in ref B , infrastructure contracts often wind up going to mob-owned businesses , who steal millions while building sub-standard roads , tunnels , bridges and public housing . 
Instead , recommends [MISC Naples-based  ] former Senator [PER Diana  ] , " Heal the periphery . 
Take ten places and invest 100 - 200 million euros in them . 
" He says that money could be spent building parks and improving security ( e.g. , with lighting and video cameras ) , creating conditions unfavorable to organized crime. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] Although law enforcement , business associations , citizens' groups , and the church , at least in some locations , are demonstrating promising engagement in fighting organized crime , the same cannot be said of [LOC Italy  ] 's politicians , particularly at the national level . 
As [PER Roberto Saviano  ] has reminded us , the subject was virtually absent from the [LOC March-April  ] election campaign . 
At the national level it is generally referred to , if at all , as a " southern " issue , although it affects the entire country and although the [LOC South  ] 's criminal organizations have made worrying advances in the [LOC North  ] . 
Even in [LOC Sicily  ] , where regional elections were precipitated by former governor [PER Cuffaro  ] 's conviction for Mafia-related crimes , discussion of crime was not a major part of the campaign ( and [PER Cuffaro  ] was elected to the [ORG Senate  ] ) . 
We should work to convey to [LOC Italy  ] 's new government that organized crime is a serious [ORG USG  ] priority , and that the dramatic economic costs of organized crime present a convincing argument for immediate action . 
However , we should not limit our support for [LOC Italy  ] 's organized crime efforts to private conversations ; on the contrary , our public advocacy for the efforts of [LOC Confindustria  ] , [LOC Addiopizzo  ] , Church clerics , and others will give them both greater visibility and enhanced credibility , just as many [MISC Italians  ] ignored the impressive innovations of their own research institutions before the [ORG Mission 's Partnership for Growth  ] program began to champion them .
