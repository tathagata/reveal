Cretz  ] , Ambassador , US Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Hosni Mubarak  ] flew to [LOC Libya  ] on February 3 for a three-hour meeting with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi to discuss the upcoming [ORG Arab League  ] Summit and growing differences over requirements for [MISC Egyptians  ] entering [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly also expressed interest in trying to mediate between [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] . 
[PER Mubarak  ] was expected to counsel [PER Qadhafi  ] that [LOC Libya  ] needed to do more to assure [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] that the summit would not lead to any new tensions between the two countries . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] Embassy expects that [LOC Iran  ] will be invited to the summit at the ministerial level but noted that several [MISC Arab  ] countries -- including [LOC Egypt  ] -- would boycott the summit if [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] attended . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] Embassy chalked up recent visits by [ORG Hamas Political Chief  ] [PER Khaled Meshaal  ] to " independent " rather than official GOL initiatives to broker a [MISC Hamas-Fatah  ] reconciliation in advance of the March 27 summit . 
Engagement with [PER Qadhafi  ] in the run-up to the [ORG Arab League  ] Summit , strongly advocated by the [MISC Arab  ] diplomatic community here , could help manage his notorious unpredictability . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi held private talks with [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Hosni Mubarak  ] in [LOC Sirte  ] on February 3 to discuss [LOC Libya  ] 's upcoming presidency of the [ORG Arab League  ] ( [LOC AL  ] ) and continuing differences over entry requirements for [MISC Egyptian  ] nationals coming to [LOC Libya  ] . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] poloff said the three-hour visit would help the two countries coordinate in advance of the March 28 [ORG Arab League  ] Summit scheduled to take place in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[PER Mubarak  ] planned to counsel [PER Qadhafi  ] that [LOC Libya  ] needed to better assure the [MISC Saudis  ] that the [MISC Libyan-hosted  ] summit would not serve as a platform to embarrass the royal family but instead move forward in a spirit of reconciliation between the two leaders . 
[LOC IRAN  ] EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE AT THE FM LEVEL <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Egyptian  ] poloff expected that [MISC Arab-Iranian  ] relations and [MISC Palestinian  ] issues would dominate the summit , and he noted that [LOC Libya  ] had made recent , high profile contact on both issues . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] ambassador also told the Ambassador that [LOC Sudan  ] and upcoming non-proliferation events in the [LOC U.S.  ] , as well as [PER Qadhafi  ] 's possible proposals to create new high-level political and military positions in the [ORG Arab League  ] along the lines of [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG EU  ] , would also figure prominently . 
[MISC Arabs  ] , he said , would not tolerate surprises like [LOC Libya  ] 's management of the July 2009 [ORG African Union  ] Summit in [LOC Sirte  ] , where [PER Qadhafi  ] 's rumored , last-minute invitation of [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] had caused [PER Mubarak  ] to cancel his attendance at that summit at the eleventh hour . 
( Note: While [MISC Iranian  ] diplomats were at the venue to advance [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's visit to the [LOC AU Summit  ] , his visit was cancelled on the day he was supposed to arrive . 
) Should [PER Ahmadinejad  ] attend , he said , several heads of state -- including [LOC Egypt  ] 's -- would boycott the summit . 
He expected [MISC Iranian  ] FM [PER Manuchehr Motaki  ] , who visited [LOC Tripoli  ] on January 14 , to represent [LOC Iran  ] as an observer . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] outreach by [LOC Libya  ] is reportedly consistent with [PER Qadhafi  ] 's new vision of being able to serve as a bridge between [LOC Tehran  ] and the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
[MISC PALESTINIAN  ] UNITY TO FIGURE LARGE ON AGENDA <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Recalling the yet-unfulfilled January 2009 pledge by [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Kuwait  ] to provide $1.5 billion in reconstruction assistance to [LOC Gaza  ] , the [MISC Egyptian  ] poloff assessed that [MISC Palestinian  ] issues would provide plenty of opportunities to weaken fragile [MISC Arab  ] unity and that [MISC Arab  ] leaders would be " holding their breath " and hoping to avoid unwelcome surprises by the unpredictable [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
Although [LOC Libya  ] has played host to [PER Hamas'  ] [PER Khaled Meshaal  ] twice in as many months , the [MISC Egyptian  ] poloff did not expect any major initiatives by the [MISC Libyan  ] government to force [MISC Hamas-Fatah  ] resolution before the March 28 summit . 
In his view , " independent " initiatives like those of [ORG Khalid  ] al-Humeidi -- son of long-time [PER Qadhafi  ] insider al-Khweldi al-Humeidi -- would intensify on the outside chance a [MISC Libyan  ] could reach a breakthrough . 
Humeidi reportedly visited [LOC Ramallah  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] earlier this year to meet with [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] and [PER Meshaal  ] and has organized humanitarian assistance to [LOC Gaza  ] through his quasi-independent [ORG International Organization for Peace  ] , Care , and Relief ( septel ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While MFA A/S-equivalent [PER Omran Abu Kraa  ] and Deputy Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Muhammed Siala  ] have been named to lead [LOC Libya  ] 's preparations for the summit , the organizing [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000110 002.2 OF 002 committee has not communicated with member states on logistics or the agenda . 
A purpose-built site for the conference is rumored to be under construction on the sprawling grounds of the new [MISC Libyan  ] Protocol office , though guest palaces nearer public view at that site appear to require more than seven weeks to complete . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] poloff commented that [MISC Arab  ] leaders would be less forgiving than the [MISC African  ] delegations in [LOC Sirte  ] -- some of whom slept on the beach as they awaited proper room assignments from their [MISC Libyan  ] hosts . 
[LOC EGYPT  ] SEEKS EASING OF [LOC LIBYA  ] VISA REQUIREMENTS <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) During his February 3 meeting with [PER Qadhafi  ] , [PER Mubarak  ] was expected to push for resolution of increasingly serious problems regarding [MISC Libyan  ] entry requirements for [MISC Egyptian  ] nationals . 
According to the [MISC Egyptian  ] poloff , [MISC Egyptians  ] are still subject to new requirements for visas or valid work contracts begun earlier this year ( ref a ) while [MISC Algerians  ] and [MISC Tunisians  ] have reverted to earlier rules allowing entry without a visa upon demonstrating financial self-sufficiency ( in the form of $800 cash ) . 
Recent bilateral agreements with countries providing significant labor to [LOC Libya  ] , including [LOC Sri Lanka  ] and [LOC Bangladesh  ] , include 500 dinar ( USD 420 ) commissions for [MISC Libyan  ] sponsors of guest workers from those countries . 
In the [MISC Egyptian  ] poloff 's view , officials taking advantage of the financial inducements for sponsoring workers from those countries bore part of the blame for [LOC Egypt  ] 's continued troubles . 
[LOC Libya  ] recently began a crackdown on illegal [MISC Egyptian  ] workers . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] ambassador told the Ambassador that the [MISC Libyan  ] crackdown resulted initially from [MISC European  ] pressure on [LOC Libya  ] to stem illegal traffic to [LOC Europe  ] , and intensified after the extensive and embarrassing [MISC Egyptian  ] press coverage given to [MISC Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi 's [MISC New Year  ] 's partying in the [LOC Caribbean  ] ( ref b ) . 
COMMENT <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In the wake of his failed attempt to extend his leadership of the [ORG African Union  ] , [PER Qadhafi  ] undoubtedly is looking to the March 27 [ORG Arab League  ] summit and beyond as a way to bolster his international standing . 
His massive ego and notoriously erratic behavior have generated much concern among the [MISC Arab  ] diplomatic community here about the summit and its outcomes . 
The [MISC Arabs  ] here have been very insistent that the [LOC U.S.  ] has a role to play in influencing the outcome by engaging [PER Qadhafi  ] in the lead-up to the summit .
