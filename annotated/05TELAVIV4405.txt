Kurtzer  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Welch  ] , Ambassador [PER Kurtzer  ] , Lt Gen [ORG Ward  ] and [ORG NSC  ] Director [PER Mustafa met  ] with MGen [PER Moshe Kaplinsky  ] , the [ORG IDF  ] Deputy Chief of the General Staff , [PER BGen Yossi Kuperwasser  ] , IDI Chief of Production , and [PER BGen Udi Dekel  ] , Chief of [ORG Strategic Planning Branch  ] , in the evening of July 14 . 
The previously planned meeting took place shortly after news came in that a [MISC Qassam  ] rocket fired into [LOC Israel  ] from the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] had killed an [MISC Israeli  ] woman in [ORG Nativ Ha Asara.  ] --------------- Recent Violence --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Reviewing events of the day ( July 14 ) , [PER BGen Kuperwasser  ] reported that [ORG IDF  ] soldiers killed a wanted [ORG PIJ  ] activist with ties to the al [ORG Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade  ] early that morning in the [LOC Rafidiya  ] neighborhood of [LOC Nablus  ] . 
The [ORG PIJ  ] organization in [LOC Gaza  ] reacted by firing a [MISC Qassam  ] rocket that impacted near the [MISC Israeli  ] city of [LOC Sderot  ] on Thursday morning , causing no casualties . 
[ORG PIJ  ] cells fired additional rockets and mortars at [MISC Israeli  ] targets in the [ORG Gush Katif  ] settlement block . 
[ORG Hamas  ] was not active during the morning events. -------------------- [ORG Hamas  ] Joins the Fray -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Hamas  ] cells , however , joined the attacks after 1200 hrs , firing four mortars and/or rockets that impacted [PER Nahal Oz  ] ( inside the [LOC Green Line  ] ) , lightly injuring three [ORG IDF  ] soldiers , [PER Kuperwasser  ] explained . 
Cells also fired rockets and mortars at [MISC Israeli  ] targets in and near the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
At approximately 1800 hrs , four rockets struck the [ORG Netiv Ha Asara  ] moshav inside [LOC Israel  ] north of [LOC Gaza  ] , killing the 22-year-old [MISC Israeli  ] woman and wounding her boyfriend , [PER Kuperwasser  ] stated . 
4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Hamas  ] involvement in the fighting was likely due to two factors , [PER Kuperwasser  ] assessed . 
First , [ORG Hamas  ] was unhappy with how [ORG PA President Abbas  ] translated the results of his recent meeting with [ORG Hamas  ] leader [ORG Khalid  ] al [PER Mashal  ] in [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[ORG Hamas  ] believed that [PER Abbas  ] had agreed to allow the " follow-up committee " composed of representatives from the opposition , including [ORG Hamas  ] , to participate in operational decisions in running the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] through disengagement prior to the PLC elections . 
[PER Abbas  ] , according [PER Kuperwasser  ] , may have left [PER Mashal  ] with that impression in [LOC Damascus  ] , but when [PER Abbas  ] returned home to strong criticism from his own party , advised opposition groups that they would only have an advisory role in [LOC Gaza  ] administration . 
[PER Kuperwasser  ] said he believes that [ORG Hamas  ] displayed its displeasure by " welcoming " [MISC Abbas'  ] arrival in [LOC Gaza  ] on the afternoon of July 14 with the attacks on [MISC Israeli  ] targets , thus sending a strong message to [PER Abbas  ] that it would act in any matter it felt appropriate without consulting him . 
The attacks placed [PER Abbas  ] under enormous pressure . 
[PER Kuperwasser  ] also acknowledged that [ORG Hamas  ] joined the fighting on Thursday afternoon in response to continued [ORG IDF  ] operations in the northern [LOC West Bank.  ] ---------------------------- [ORG PA-IDF Security Coordination  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) MGen [PER Kaplinsky  ] characterized overall security coordination with the [ORG PA  ] in recent weeks as very good . 
He stated that there have been three meetings with [ORG PA  ] MOI MGen [PER Nasir Yusif  ] 's deputy , [PER BGen Jamal  ] Abu Zayd ) one that he attended , and two attended by MGen " [MISC Haki  ] " [PER Harel  ] , the [ORG IDF  ] chief of [ORG Planning Branch  ] . 
The meetings have been good , he stated , very " sincere , " with wide representation from all of the [ORG PA  ] security organizations . 
The two sides agreed to meet every 10-14 days at the operational level , with each meeting followed up by meetings between field commanders . 
[PER Kaplinsky  ] said that coordination has been good , with both sides talking about specifics on the map . 
The two sides , he stated , have also agreed to conduct joint exercises ( scheduled for early August ) . 
[PER Kaplinsky  ] stated that the [ORG IDF  ] still intended to meet with [ORG PA  ] counterparts next week , despite the ongoing attacks. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Unfortunately , [PER Kaplinsky  ] stated , despite the good coordination , no results are apparent on the ground . 
This led him to conclude that the [ORG PA  ] counterparts with whom the [ORG IDF  ] is coordinating do not have power over forces on the ground . 
[PER Nasir Yusif  ] 's influence on the ground , he stated , is poor . 
During every meeting with the [ORG PA  ] , he said , the [ORG IDF  ] drives home the point that it will not disengage under fire . 
Disengagement , however , has begun and " we are under fire . 
" [PER Kaplinsky  ] gave credit to the [ORG PA  ] for its efforts against smuggling tunnels . 
The [ORG PA  ] 's inability , however , to arrest [PER Hassan Madhun  ] , the [MISC Fatah  ] cell leader responsible for numerous attacks against the [LOC Gaza  ] crossing facilities , underscored its overall ineffectiveness . 
The [ORG IDF  ] , he stated , will continue to talk and coordinate with the [ORG PA  ] , but it is not happy with the level of [ORG PA  ] activity on the ground. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador [PER Kurtzer  ] asked [PER Kaplinsky  ] what realistic steps he would counsel [PER Nasir Yusif  ] to take if he were [PER Yusif  ] 's advisor . 
[PER Kaplinsky  ] said he would would first advise [PER Yusif  ] to take action against [ORG PIJ  ] . 
[ORG PIJ  ] is a small group , without popular [MISC Palestinian  ] support . 
[PER Nasir Yusif  ] has the capability to challenge [ORG PIJ  ] , even with his divided forces . 
He should stop them from conducting attacks and arrest them . 
Second , [PER Kaplinsky  ] continued , the [ORG PA  ] leadership should provide support to commanders who undertake difficult actions against opposition groups on the ground . 
It is critical that the [ORG PA  ] leadership provide moral and verbal support to its commanders in the field . 
[PER Kaplinsky  ] 's third hypothetical suggestion was to strengthen the " determination " of [ORG PA  ] leaders to ensure that orders , once given , are fulfilled . 
LT Gen [PER Ward  ] concurred , stressing the need to verify that orders have been implemented. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Welch  ] commended the [ORG IDF  ] for its " huge " step forward in coordination with the [ORG PA  ] , and stressed the importance of continuing the coordination . 
[PER Ward  ] underscored that the types of attacks now occurring come as no surprise , because everyone expected opposition elements to attempt to derail disengagement . 
What matters is not playing into the hands of these elements. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Welch  ] asked if the [ORG PA  ] had contacted the [ORG IDF  ] for permission to transfer [ORG PIJ  ] member XXXXX from [LOC Tulkarm  ] to the [ORG PA  ] prison in [LOC Jericho  ] . 
[PER Kaplinsky  ] and [PER Kuperwasser  ] said they were not certain whether the [ORG PA  ] had made such a request , but stated that the [ORG IDF  ] normally authorized such transfers . 
[PER Kuperwasser  ] explained , however , that [PER Nasir Yusif  ] 's forces did not have control of [PER Saadi  ] . 
[ORG PA Special Forces  ] personnel under [PER Bashir Nafiah  ] were housing him and several other [ORG PIJ  ] members in his headquarters in [LOC Tulkarm  ] , to the consternation and protest of the local [ORG National Security Forces  ] commander. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to another [ORG PIJ  ] figure from [LOC Tulkarm  ] , [PER Kuperwasser  ] recounted that [ORG PIJ  ] leader [PER Louay al Saadi  ] was released from [MISC Israeli  ] prison in January 2004 as part of the [ORG Hizballah  ] prisoner exchange deal . 
[PER Saadi  ] returned to the [LOC Tulkarm  ] area and began organizing terror attacks . 
[PER Kuperwasser  ] said that [PER Saadi  ] is responsible for the February 25 suicide bombing at the [ORG Stage Club Tel Aviv  ] , the car bomb that exploded near [PER Mevo Dotan  ] following the [ORG Stage Club  ] attack , the killing of a [MISC Hermesh  ] resident in a shooting attack on his vehicle an attempt to send two bombers into [LOC Jerusalem  ] on May 31 , the July 12 suicide bombing in [LOC Netanya  ] and car bomb near [PER Shavei Shomron  ] . 
[PER Kuperwasser  ] said that the [ORG PA  ] security forces in [LOC Tulkarm  ] had close contacts with [PER Saadi  ] , in an attempt to recruit him and his cell members into the security forces . 
President [PER Abbas  ] , he said , was aware of the effort and was disappointed that [PER Saadi  ] refused to join , now realizing he cannot be integrated into the [LOC PA.  ] --------------- [LOC Netanya  ] Bombing --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kuperwasser  ] charged that [ORG PIJ  ] cells in the territories maintain close ties with [ORG PIJ  ] headquarters in [LOC Damascus  ] , which , for example , regularly provides funds , particularly following successful operations . 
He said that [PER Louay  ] al-Saadi received two payments of $15,000 each following the Stage attack . 
[LOC Damascus  ] also has provided operational guidance to the field . 
There was a debate within the [LOC Damascus  ] headquarters concerning whether it should support the " tahdiya , " or calm , [PER Kuperwasser  ] explained , but as far as he knew no instructions were ever sent to the field telling it to cease operations . 
A couple of days prior to the [LOC Netanya  ] bombing , [PER Kuperwasser  ] said that [PER Saadi  ] 's organization provided " hints " to the [LOC Damascus  ] leadership that it was planning an attack . 
The [ORG IDF  ] was not able to decipher the " hints " , but assumes that [LOC Damascus  ] did not object to the attack . 
Following the [LOC Netanya  ] attack , the [MISC Tulkarm-based  ] cell admitted to the attack in messages to [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[LOC Damascus  ] , he said , showed no dismay over the message , and in fact was pleased . 
In the meantime , the [LOC Tulkarm  ] [ORG PIJ  ] took responsibility for the attack publicly through [ORG Reuters/al Jazira  ] . 
The [MISC Damascus-based  ] [ORG PIJ  ] leadership instructed its leaders in [LOC Gaza  ] to " clarify " with the [ORG PA  ] that it was not/not behind the attack . 
Likewise , [PER Kuperwasser  ] stated , the [MISC Damascus-based  ] [ORG PIJ  ] headquarters ordered groups in [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Syria  ] not/not to talk. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Following the attack , [PER Kuperwasser  ] continued , President [PER Abbas  ] attempted to convince the [MISC Damascus-based  ] [ORG PIJ  ] leadership not to admit to being behind the attack . 
[PER Abbas  ] , according to [PER Kuperwasser  ] , made an enormous effort to reach the [LOC Damascus  ] leadership , arguing that admitting to the attack could lead to the collapse of the " cease-fire " . 
[ORG PIJ  ] leadership subsequently announced July 14 that it was bound to the " tahdiya " as long as [LOC Israel  ] refrained from targeting the group , essentially stating that it was not bound to the cease-fire , [PER Kuperwasser  ] commented . 
( [PER Note: Abbas  ] issued orders to arrest [PER Saadi  ] on the evening of July 14 . 
) -------------- Sensitive Time -------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER BGEN Dekel  ] commented that we are in a sensitive period , as disengagement has , for all practical purposes , already begun . 
Details are not important , he continued ; the [ORG PA  ] must take actions to stop the terror . 
[PER Kuperwasser  ] pointed out that [PER Abbas  ] had used the word " terror " in his denouncement of the [LOC Netanya  ] bombing , his first public use of the word in such a context since 2003 . 
No other [ORG PA  ] leaders , however , have followed his lead , he commented . 
The [ORG PA  ] must treat these attacks as terror , if progress is to be made , he said . 
[PER Kaplinsky  ] closed the meeting by reaffirming the [ORG IDF  ] commitment to continue to coordinate with the [ORG PA  ] in the hope that the process would lead to results on the ground .
