[LOC LISBON  ] 2596 Classified By: [PER Dana M. Brown  ] , Pol-Econ Officer , Embassy [MISC Lisbon Reason  ] 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [PER Hugo Chavez  ] visited [LOC Portugal  ] on September 27 , at the end of a trip that included stops in [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC France  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] has warmed towards [LOC Venezuela  ] recently and become the [ORG EU  ] nation most visited by [PER Chavez  ] over the past year . 
In addition to protecting the large [MISC Portuguese  ] population resident in [LOC Venezuela  ] , over the past year the [MISC GOP  ] has bolstered bilateral economic ties to include a wide range of " milk for oil , " " infrastructure for oil , " and " technology for oil " deals . 
[MISC Portuguese  ] Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] agreed to additional cooperation during [PER Chavez  ] 's latest visit and they will meet again in late October at the [ORG Ibero-American Summit  ] in [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
End summary. ------------------------------ Trade: On the Prowl for Energy ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] imports all of its oil and natural gas and , as part of its expanding energy diversification efforts , in May officially signed an " oil for milk " deal with [LOC Venezuela  ] involving exchange of [MISC Portuguese  ] dairy products for [MISC Venezuelan  ] oil . 
The [MISC GOP  ] quickly added other areas of cooperation including port infrastructure , housing , technology , law enforcement , and commercial aviation . 
Over the last year , the [MISC GOP  ] and [ORG GOV  ] have signed more than 40 agreements on new areas of cooperation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Some of the [MISC Portuguese  ] companies participating in the agreements include [MISC Montebravo  ] ( construction ) , [PER Sapropor  ] ( foodstuffs ) , Primor , [PER Cerealis  ] ( foodstuffs ) , [PER Ramirez  ] ( canned fish ) , [PER Cofaco  ] ( canned seafood ) and [PER Sovena  ] ( cooking oils ) . 
All the companies began sending shipments in April 2008 prior to PM Socrates' May visit to [LOC Venezuela.  ] --------------------- Protecting the People --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Despite the growing economic links , [MISC Portuguese  ] officials stress to us that the 600,000 [MISC Portuguese  ] residents in [LOC Venezuela  ] are the main reason for [LOC Portugal  ] 's close bilateral relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
MFA officials have told us , for example , that they believe that it is important to maintain a friendly relationship with [PER Chavez  ] to ensure that the [ORG GOV  ] does not persecute the [MISC Portuguese  ] in retaliation for bilateral tension . 
In fact , MFA Americas' Director [PER Helena Coutinho  ] mentioned that [LOC Portugal  ] would continue to be friendly to [PER Chavez  ] " unless he declares a war . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC GOP  ] has reason to be concerned about the conditions of [MISC Portuguese  ] citizens in [LOC Venezuela  ] , given the deteriorating security situation there , and many [MISC Portuguese  ] shopkeepers recently demanded more direct government protection . 
In late September , several [MISC Portuguese  ] businessmen sent an open letter to PM [PER Socrates  ] , demanding that he raise with [PER Chavez  ] the worsening security situation in [LOC Caracas  ] suburbs . 
This year , 20 [MISC Portuguese  ] businessmen were kidnapped , and another ten were murdered ( four in September alone ) . 
[PER Federico Ludovice  ] , PM Socrates' Diplomatic Advisor on [LOC Latin America  ] , told us that [PER Socrates  ] would raise the issue privately with [PER Chavez  ] , but noted that the security situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] is generally problematic and the [MISC Portuguese  ] were not a particular target . 
On September 30 , [PER Chavez  ] announced the creation of a special interlocutor with the [MISC Portuguese  ] community to address security concerns. ----------------------- Political Repercussions ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While the [MISC GOP  ] turned down two of [PER Chavez  ] 's requests to visit [LOC Lisbon  ] in 2005 because of unhappiness over [LOC Venezuela  ] 's detention of a [MISC Portuguese  ] pilot accused of drug trafficking , [PER Chavez  ] visited [LOC Lisbon  ] once in 2006 for a refueling stop and again in November 2007 for a dinner hosted by the Prime Minister . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's September 2008 visit marked the fourth visit between the two leaders this year . 
When we raise [LOC U.S.  ] concerns over policies implemented by the [PER Chavez  ] administration , our interlocutors regularly assure us that they understand our concerns and use the visits to deliver tough messages in private . 
President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] summed it up when he told Ambassador ( ref A ) that , " You have to understand our position . 
We have five hundred thousand ( sic ) [MISC Portuguese  ] there . 
We know--and I 've met him--that he 's a [LOC LISBON  ] 00002629 002 OF 002 crazy man , but.. . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite the benefits of increased trade with [LOC Venezuela  ] to [LOC Portugal  ] 's ailing economy , the Prime Minister did not win public support after [PER Chavez  ] 's July visit to [LOC Lisbon  ] , largely due to [PER Chavez  ] 's indiscretion . 
During that visit , [PER Socrates  ] reportedly confided his concerns about the lackluster [MISC Portuguese  ] economy to [PER Chavez  ] , who then related the comments on a [MISC Venezuelan  ] national broadcast . 
[PER Chavez  ] claimed [PER Socrates  ] had said the [MISC Portuguese  ] economy was " stagnant , " a diagnosis far grimmer than the optimistic analyses he shares with domestic audiences . 
Opposition parties [ORG PSD  ] and [ORG CDS  ] seized on the news and asked [PER Socrates  ] to clarify his statement before the Parliament but [PER Socrates  ] did not respond. -------------------- The Latest Encounter -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Chavez  ] 's September 27 visit to [LOC Lisbon  ] once again focused on increasing economic ties . 
He signed two deals with the [MISC Portuguese  ] government and [MISC Portuguese  ] companies - one to buy one million [MISC Portuguese-made  ] computers and the other to build 50,000 pre-fabricated houses in [LOC Venezuela  ] ) the latter worth two billion euros . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] media gave the visit high profile coverage and ran photos of the two leaders arm in arm. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Perhaps in response to the uptick in visits and [LOC Portugal  ] 's new status as the most visited [ORG EU  ] nation , local headlines asked , " What does [PER Chavez  ] want from us ? 
" [PER Chavez  ] told the press he was appreciative that [LOC Portugal  ] had " opened the door " to the world for [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He added that [LOC Portugal  ] was able to explain and defend [LOC Venezuela  ] to its [MISC European  ] partners and dispel the view that [LOC Venezuela  ] was a devil and that he was a tyrant . 
During [PER Chavez  ] 's impromptu speech , [PER Chavez  ] highlighted his political agenda , including the " silent revolution of true democracy . 
" In his comments , [PER Socrates  ] strictly focused on the [MISC GOP  ] 's concern about the well-being of the [MISC Portuguese  ] community in [LOC Venezuela  ] and on bilateral cooperation with [LOC Venezuela  ] on education with the computers . 
[PER Socrates  ] and [PER Chavez  ] are next slated to meet at the [ORG Ibero-American Summit  ] in [LOC El Salvador  ] later in October. ---------------------------- [MISC Comment: Rising Costs of Oil  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [MISC GOP  ] has heard our concerns about [LOC Venezuela  ] but defends its energy deals with [PER Chavez  ] by pointing toward [MISC US-Venezuela  ] oil trade . 
On the whole , [LOC Portugal  ] 's interest in finding new energy suppliers has received a mixed response -- the press and public appear divided between strengthening ties with petroleum producers like [PER Chavez  ] and unease over doing business with these new , controversial partners . 
Given Socrates' public discomfort over [PER Chavez  ] 's airing his private comments on TV , and [PER Chavez  ] 's propensity to use the bilateral relationship in ways that embarrass [PER Socrates  ] , the Prime Minister may pause before he agrees to yet another photo op with his " good friend [PER Chavez  ] . 
" End comment .
