( C ) Summary . 
The November visits by [MISC Israeli  ] President [PER Shimon Peres  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] , both shortly in advance of [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's visit ( ref A ) , led to few substantive results but helped [LOC Brazil  ] craft its narrative as a hopeful emerging player in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
During the [PER Abbas  ] visit , President [PER Lula  ] made separate comments criticizing the [LOC U.S.  ] role in the [LOC Middle East  ] and arguing that the [ORG United Nations  ] , not the [LOC United States  ] , should play a mediating role in the region . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy expressed satisfaction with the [PER Peres  ] visit but does not see [LOC Brazil  ] as a viable neutral third party in the region , given the [ORG GOB  ] 's lack of regional knowledge and its lean against [MISC Israeli  ] interests in efforts to accumulate supporters of a permanent [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat . 
Diplomats representing [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] 's neighbors with whom we have spoken welcome [LOC Brazil  ] 's interest in the region and generally support [LOC Brazil  ] 's goals , but see the current aggressive outreach as largely a product of [PER Lula  ] 's strong presidency , and expect little from [LOC Brazil  ] besides an emerging commercial relationship . 
End summary . 
Brief Summary of [PER Peres  ] and [PER Abbas  ] Visits --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) In his November 11-12 visit to [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Shimon Peres  ] met separately with President [PER Lula  ] and Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] , then addressed a joint session of [ORG Congress  ] , before departing to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] for meetings with business leaders ( including [ORG Petrobras  ] ) and the [MISC Jewish  ] community . 
Various minor commercial agreements were signed . 
In many ways the agenda for the visit -- the first by an [MISC Israeli  ] president since 1966 -- mirrored the November 23 agenda of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] was a consistent topic of discussion in [ORG Peres'  ] visits with [MISC Brazilian  ] officials , businessmen and politicians . 
Local press coverage was relatively limited and highly favorable ; nothing particularly interesting was said in the media during the visit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Lula  ] met [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Abbas  ] on October 20 in the state of [LOC Bahia  ] on [LOC Brazil  ] 's northeastern coast . 
[PER Abbas  ] was warmly supportive of a [MISC Brazilian  ] role in the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process . 
In the [LOC Bahia  ] press conference , [PER Lula  ] criticized the [ORG USG  ] role in the region , saying , " As long as the [LOC United States  ] is trying to negotiate peace in the [LOC Middle East  ] there won't be peace...The one who should oversee the negotiations is the [ORG United Nations  ] , and that 's why [LOC Brazil  ] wants to reform the [ORG UN  ] system . 
" The following day he made similar comments blaming the [LOC United States  ] for problems in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Despite this , [PER Lula  ] 's policy prescriptions for the region were nothing outside the mainstream , calling for a halt to new [LOC West Bank  ] settlements ( but not removal of existing ones ) , and preservation of current borders for a future [MISC Palestinian  ] state . 
Ministry of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] or [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) officials from both the [ORG Iran/Central Asia  ] and [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] desks later told poloff that Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] weighed in with [PER Lula  ] and his advisors right after the [PER Abbas  ] visit to get him to refrain from directly criticizing the [LOC United States  ] or other countries by name during the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit . 
This effort apparently proved to be successful ( ref A ) . 
[MISC Israeli  ] and other Perspectives ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Israeli  ] Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Raphael Singer  ] told poloff November 27 that he was happy with the [PER Peres  ] visit outcomes , and content with the [PER Abbas  ] visit outcomes . 
[ORG Peres'  ] joint session before [ORG Congress  ] was a particular point of pride , since it was difficult to set up , drew several dozen sympathetic senators and deputies from a wide range of parties , and contrasted sharply with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's relatively frosty courtesy call with the presidents of the [ORG Senate  ] and [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] . 
He was also proud of setting up a widely run photo of [PER Peres  ] with soccer star [PER Ronaldo  ] . 
[PER Singer  ] acknowledged concerns about [PER Lula  ] 's rhetoric during the [PER Abbas  ] visit but believed the visit was helpful at least to the extent that [PER Abbas  ] explained to [PER Lula  ] how [MISC Iranian  ] assistance to [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] undermines his position and peace in the region generally . 
Media reports assert that [PER Abbas  ] pressed [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001391 002.2 OF 003 [PER Lula  ] to push [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to stop such assistance . 
( Comment: Previous poloff discussions with [ORG MRE  ] indicate very little institutional [ORG Itamaraty  ] understanding of [LOC Iran  ] 's role in [LOC Israel/Palestine/Lebanon  ] . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG MRE  ] Israel/Palestine desk officer offered general pleasantries about the visits and had no comment on President [PER Lula  ] 's remarks in [LOC Bahia  ] concerning the [ORG USG  ] role in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He told poloff that [ORG MRE  ] has committed to providing additional support to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) , but allocation decisions won't be made until 2010 . 
[PER Singer  ] told poloff that the [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy has no problems with the [ORG GOB  ] providing funding to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , but would appreciate advance consultation with [ORG MRE  ] , which did not happen before [PER Amorim  ] 's March announcement that [LOC Brazil  ] would provide 20 million reais ( then USD 10 million ) to the [ORG PA  ] ( ref D ) . 
Getting in the Game ? -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Leading [MISC Brazilian  ] officials , including Undersecretary Jaguaribe , have described -- to us and to other diplomatic missions -- their initiatives in the [LOC Middle East  ] as an effort to " get in the game . 
" [PER Lula  ] took that metaphor literally in meetings with his counterparts , frequently calling for a soccer game between [MISC Israelis  ] , [MISC Palestinians  ] , and [MISC Brazilians  ] as a precursor to peace . 
Singer takes exception to [LOC Brazil  ] 's tendency to look at the [LOC Middle East  ] through this prism , arguing that it underscores the point that [LOC Brazil  ] 's involvement has to do more with burnishing its own self-image than being an honest broker in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
While he describes [MISC Israel-Brazil  ] relationships as amicable , [LOC Brazil  ] 's tendency to look at the region in terms of potential votes for a theoretical [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat consistently puts them against [MISC Israeli  ] interests . 
[PER Peres  ] , he said , was particularly annoyed with [PER Lula  ] 's " unserious " response to [ORG Peres'  ] inquiries about [LOC Brazil  ] voting consistently for anti-Israel resolutions in the [LOC UN.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Singer emphasized [LOC Brazil  ] 's lack of capacity in the region , a point also made by diplomats from neighboring states who are much more favorably inclined to [LOC Brazil  ] 's basic policy . 
The [MISC Jordanian  ] [ORG DCM  ] , who has been in [LOC Brasilia  ] nearly three years , told poloff recently that he has never spoken [MISC Arabic  ] with anyone at [ORG Itamaraty  ] in a work situation and said he doesn't know of anyone in [ORG MRE  ] not of [MISC Syrian-Lebanese  ] [MISC Christian  ] descent who can comfortably speak the language . 
( Note: [ORG MRE  ] admits it has no [PER Farsi speakers  ] , and the [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy counts one passable [MISC Hebrew  ] speaker in [ORG MRE  ] . 
End note . 
) There is also an awareness among many that [PER Lula  ] and his advisors in the Presidency are the driving force behind this effort , one that might have difficulty outlasting [PER Lula  ] 's presidency . 
In a mid-November conversation with poloff , the [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador and [ORG DCM  ] spoke in glowing terms of a recent [MISC Turkish  ] congressional visit to [LOC Brazil  ] and envisioned robust growth in [MISC Turkish-Brazilian  ] commercial relations . 
They also talked about how [PER Lula  ] 's personality draws world leaders into wanting a closer relationship , and joked about how there was no way that [PER Lula  ] 's handpicked presidential candidate [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] could be able to project herself the same way in the region . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG DCM  ] told us that [LOC Brazil  ] is " a long way from being a player in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
" While that may be true , the package of presidential visits -- [PER Peres  ] , [ORG Abbas  ] , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] -- helped [PER Lula  ] underscore his point both domestically and with certain [MISC Middle Eastern  ] leaders that [LOC Brazil  ] should be considered a rising player in the region . 
Return visits by [PER Lula  ] to [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Palestine  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , all planned for roughly March-April 2010 , will further advance his case . 
[PER Lula  ] 's expectations are rising rapidly , as seen in his November 26 reply letter to President [PER Obama  ] , which includes demands to involve new players ( [LOC Brazil  ] ) in [LOC Middle East  ] peace negotiations . 
The [ORG GOB  ] 's [LOC Middle East  ] strategy , designed to position [LOC Brazil  ] as a " leader of the [MISC South  ] " and one-day permanent [ORG UNSC  ] member , has led [PER Lula  ] and his advisors to pick at minor policy differences rather than play an overtly supportive role of efforts by the major players . 
This was seen clearly in the [ORG Abbas  ] visit , when [PER Lula  ] sharply criticized the [ORG USG  ] , then laid out policy recommendations for Israel/Palestine essentially identical to our own . 
Moving forward , our lack of serious visible policy differences on Israel/Palestine suggests ample room for cooperation with [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001391 003.2 OF 003 [LOC Brazil  ] , such as providing coordinated financial support to the [ORG PA  ] for purposes of improving negotiation prospects . 
Unfortunately , the current [MISC Brazilian  ] government may see the need to balance such coordination with needling statements aimed at maintaining its role as an independent player .
