Russell  ] for Reasons 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- Summary ------- 1 . 
( C ) In meetings on June 18 and 19 with [ORG TNK-BP  ] CEO [PER Robert Dudley  ] and [ORG Renaissance Capital  ] 's Deputy Chairman [PER Robert Foresman  ] ( both Amcits ) , visiting [ORG NSC  ] Senior Director for [LOC Russia  ] [PER Mary Warlick  ] and EUR/RUS Director [PER Kelly  ] heard first hand accounts of the complicated , opaque and increasingly acrimonious dispute over control of the world 's seventh largest oil company . 
[PER Dudley  ] said negotiations had largely broken down with [ORG BP  ] 's [MISC Russian  ] partners in [ORG TNK-BP  ] and with [ORG Gazprom  ] on a global partnership . 
He said the [MISC Russian  ] partners were resorting to ever more extreme tactics to gain control of the company , including the continued use of state administrative resources , and that [MISC Russian  ] government intervention was needed to broker a settlement . 
He expressed appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to encourage [ORG GOR  ] intervention . 
Separately , [PER Foresman  ] , whose company advises [ORG BP  ] , attributed the freeze in negotiations over the [MISC Gazprom-BP  ] global alliance to the influence of Deputy Prime Minister [PER Sechin  ] and suggested that [PER Sechin  ] 's company , [ORG Rosneft  ] ( where he serves as Chairman of the [ORG Board  ] ) , may ultimately emerge as [ORG BP  ] 's partner in [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
End Summary. ------------------- A Worsening Dispute ------------------- 2 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] told [PER Warlick  ] and [PER Kelly  ] that negotiations had largely broken down and that [ORG BP  ] 's partners , [PER AlfaAccessRenova  ] ( [ORG AAR  ] ) , were using increasingly extreme tactics in their efforts to take control of the company . 
He likened their tactics to the dark days of the 1990s , when [MISC Russian  ] businesses used " corporate raiding " methods to take control of assets at prices well below market . 
Although the [ORG GOR  ] claimed to be taking a " hands-off " approach to what it was describing as a " shareholder 's dispute . 
" In fact , according to [PER Dudley  ] , the [ORG AAR  ] partners were using their influence and wealth to enlist the administrative resources of state entities on their behalf . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Warlick  ] responded that the [ORG USG  ] was tracking the dispute closely and was concerned not only about [ORG BP  ] 's investment and the effect of the dispute on [LOC Russia  ] 's investment climate but also about [PER Dudley  ] 's personal safety . 
[PER Dudley  ] responded that because of the structure of the company , he was the focal point of the attacks . 
As the CEO , he had authority over all decision-making . 
He said that if he were taken out of the equation , the [ORG AAR  ] partners would achieve their objective of gaining control and would be able to do whatever they wanted with the company 's assets to the detriment of other shareholders , including [ORG BP  ] . 
He expected the attacks on him to continue in the form of law suits and the like but said that while the situation was wearing on him , he believed his profile was too great for there to be any physical threat against him. -------------------------- [ORG AAR  ] PR Campaign Succeeding -------------------------- 4 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] acknowledged that the [ORG AAR  ] public relations campaign was resonating within [LOC Russia  ] and especially within the [ORG GOR  ] . 
In particular , claims that [ORG BP  ] was holding [LOC Russia  ] back by inhibiting one of its largest companies from expanding abroad and competing directly with [ORG BP  ] appealed to [MISC Russian  ] nationalism and the country 's sense of itself as victims of the [LOC West  ] . 
Likewise , the claims that [ORG BP  ] had foisted large numbers of expatriate employees on [ORG TNK-BP  ] , in jobs that could be performed by [MISC Russians  ] , also appealed to [MISC Russian  ] nationalism . 
The success of this public relations campaign was likely to make the [ORG AAR  ] partners even less inclined to seek a compromise solution with [ORG BP  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] explained , however , that in fact there was little substance to [ORG AAR  ] 's claims . 
The number of expatriates in [ORG TNK-BP  ] was less than 250 out of a total of 66,000 employees . 
Of those , only 110 were permanent [ORG TNK-BP  ] employees and of those only 40 had ties to [ORG BP  ] . 
As to international expansion , it was true that [ORG BP  ] 's preference was to invest in [LOC Russia  ] and the [ORG FSU  ] , where [ORG TNK-BP  ] had competitive advantages . 
[PER Dudley  ] said the [ORG AAR  ] partners , by contrast , were interested in expanding to places like [LOC Myanmar  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , and [LOC Sudan  ] , which posed problems for [ORG BP  ] given [LOC U.S.  ] and other [MISC Western  ] sanctions . 
6 . 
( C ) In addition , [PER Dudley  ] said [ORG AAR  ] and , in particular , [MISC German  ] [PER Khan  ] , had been systematically using [ORG TNK-BP  ] resources to vet these projects xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
This particular dispute arose when [PER Dudley  ] said he had refused to allow [PER Khan  ] to continue to have these projects vetted by [MISC TNK-BP.  ] --------- Deadlines --------- 7 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] said there were two important approaching deadlines: June 26 , when a shareholders meeting was to be held for [ORG TNK-BP  ] holding , which included minority shareholders , and which was to approve the accounts for [MISC TNK-BPs  ] regional subsidiaries and renew the mandates of their [ORG Board  ] of Directors ; and , late July , when his work permit and those of the senior [MISC Western  ] managers in [ORG TNK-BP  ] were due to expire . 
He suspected that the [ORG AAR  ] partners might attempt to prevent the [ORG Board  ] meeting . 
If it were not held , the result would be two-fold: lawsuits from minority shareholders for failure to receive dividends and anarchy in the operations of the subsidiaries , which would allow their AAR-allied heads to begin stripping assets in the absence of any effective oversight . 
8 . 
( C ) As to the visas , [PER Dudley  ] said he had submitted a new list to the [ORG Federal Migration Service  ] ( [ORG FMS  ] ) , which included the senior [MISC Western  ] management and also restored the names of the [ORG BP  ] secondees that [PER Khan  ] had removed earlier . 
[PER Dudley  ] said he planned to meet soon with the [ORG FMS  ] and hoped to have the issue resolved at that time. ----------------------- [ORG GOR Intervention Needed  ] ----------------------- 9 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] said [MISC Russian  ] Government intervention was needed to convince the [ORG AAR  ] partners to negotiate in good faith . 
However , in that regard , he said he had heard rumors that to curry favor with the [LOC Kremlin  ] the [ORG AAR  ] partners had agreed to export [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's crude oil through a trading company close to the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
( Comment: He most likely meant [PER Gunvor  ] , whose head is reportedly a close personal friend of Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] . 
) In addition , [PER Dudley  ] indicated that [ORG BP  ] 's talks with [ORG Gazprom  ] about a global partnership had been put on hold because of a power struggle within the governing elite , with officials connected with [ORG Rosneft  ] objecting to the partnership . 
He said he had also heard that the [ORG GOR  ] was considering letting the two sides fight each other to exhaustion , like " Siberian tigers , " and then capture the survivor to create a third [MISC Russian  ] major oil company ( in addition to [ORG Rosneft  ] and [ORG Lukoil  ] ) . 
10 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] added that whatever the [ORG GOR  ] 's motivation , it seemed oblivious to the effect the dispute was having on the country 's reputation among foreign investors . 
He noted that at the recent [LOC St. Petersburg Economic Forum  ] the government had made all the right noises about creating a good investment climate , including by fighting corruption and improving the rule of law . 
However , the [ORG GOR  ] 's failure to address the dispute was undermining that message . 
[PER Dudley  ] said he was being constantly approached by current and prospective investors who were deeply disturbed by the government 's official inaction in the face of individual [MISC Russian  ] businessmen using state resources against a foreign partner. --------- [LOC U.S.  ] Role --------- 11 . 
( C ) [PER Warlick  ] noted that the reputational issue had been raised by Commerce Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] and that the [LOC U.S.  ] would look for other opportunities to raise our concerns , including meetings with [ORG GOR  ] officials this week . 
[PER Dudley  ] responded that Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] 's efforts on [ORG BP  ] 's behalf had been deeply appreciated . 
He hoped that the [MISC G-8  ] meetings in [LOC Japan  ] and [ORG Treasury Secretary Paulson  ] 's visit to [LOC Moscow  ] later in the month would provide additional senior-level opportunities to drive home USG concerns . 
[PER Warlick  ] responded that it would be important for all G8 leaders to reinforce the message with [PER Medvedev  ] . 
[PER Dudley  ] agreed and said [ORG BP  ] was approaching other [MISC Western  ] countries to weigh in as well. ----------------------------- RenCap: [ORG Rosneft  ] the Solution ? ----------------------------- 12 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting with [PER Robert Foresman  ] , [PER RenCap  ] 's Amcit Deputy Chairman said that his firm had been advising [ORG BP  ] for some time on its business activities in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Foresman  ] said the [MISC Gazprom-BP  ] partnership would have been extremely profitable for both companies and had been blessed at the highest levels of the [MISC Russian  ] Government , by [PER Putin  ] himself . 
What [ORG BP  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] had envisioned was an ambitious global partnership in which they would share equity stakes in specific [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG BP  ] assets , as well as a joint venture partnership in [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] would buy out [ORG AAR  ] 's 50 percent share of [ORG TNK-BP  ] and receive one additional share from [ORG BP  ] for a majority stake , but [ORG BP  ] would continue as the operating partner . 
[PER Foresman  ] 's view was that [ORG Gazprom  ] CEO [PER Miller  ] had been given responsibility for making this deal happen and that [PER Miller  ] had fumbled the ball by taking too long and failing to engage successfully with the [ORG AAR  ] partners about their stake . 
13 . 
( C ) [PER Foresman  ] said [ORG Gazprom  ] 's failure to move quickly had opened the door to the [ORG AAR  ] partners , who had seized control of the process of reconfiguring the company in an effort to extract maximum value if forced to sell . 
He said it was clear the [ORG AAR  ] partners were not negotiating in good faith . 
For instance , it had been [ORG Alfa  ] 's [PER Mikhail Fridman  ] who had initiated the discussion of [ORG AAR  ] trading its stake in [ORG TNK-BP  ] for shares in [ORG BP  ] . 
[PER Fridman  ] had then publicly attributed this idea to [ORG BP  ] in an effort to further discredit the company in [LOC Russia  ] . 
14 . 
( C ) [PER Foresman  ] said [ORG Gazprom  ] 's delay had also opened the door to [PER Igor Sechin  ] who , from his new perch as the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the energy sector , saw a chance to promote the fortunes of his company , [ORG Rosneft  ] , at the expense of its rival , [ORG Gazprom  ] . 
[PER Sechin  ] , according to [PER Foresman  ] , had seen [ORG Gazprom  ] 's expansion into the oil business via ownership of the [MISC Russian  ] half of [ORG TNK-BP  ] as a challenge to [ORG Rosneft  ] 's position as [LOC Russia  ] 's national champion for oil , and had moved to block the takeover and the broader [MISC Gazprom-BP  ] partnership. xxxxxxxxxxxx 15 . 
( C ) [PER Foresman  ] said [PER RenCap  ] had also run the numbers on a [ORG BP  ] partnership with [ORG Rosneft  ] . 
It was not as mutually profitable as the [ORG Gazprom  ] tie-in , nor as significant globally , but was looking increasingly attractive to [ORG BP  ] under the current circumstances . 
Moreover , [ORG BP  ] had bought a substantial stake in [ORG Rosneft  ] during its IPO two years ago , a stake that had already risen by 60 percent in the interval . 
[PER Foresman  ] predicted that a [ORG Rosneft  ] buy-out of the [ORG AAR  ] partners was now the most likely outcome of the dispute and the one most beneficial to [ORG BP  ] . 
[PER Foresman  ] added under that scenario [PER Dudley  ] would likely be out , replaced by someone acceptable to both sides such as [ORG Rosneft  ] 's current CEO , Amcit [PER Peter O'Brien  ] .
