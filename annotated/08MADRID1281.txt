MADRID  ] 1131 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
MADRID 751 Classified By: DCM [PER Arnold A. Chacon  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) This is an action request . 
See paragraph 5. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary: MOD [PER Carme Chacon  ] continues to voice , publicly and privately , her desire to see the [LOC U.S.  ] elevate the Agreement on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] ( [ORG ADC  ] ) to treaty status . 
[PER Chacon  ] describes this in terms of legal parity and equilibrium in the bilateral relationship and has hinted the current arrangement suggests the [LOC U.S.  ] does not value the agreement as [LOC Spain  ] does . 
Although the agreement runs through February 2011 ( and is automatically renewed in one-year increments thereafter ) , given the strategic importance of our use of the [MISC Spanish  ] bases at [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] , it is vital that we address the [ORG MOD  ] 's concerns quickly and try to get this issue off the media radar . 
This is particularly urgent given that the [ORG ADC  ] is also regularly in the news because of continual reporting of alleged detainee flights to [LOC Guantanamo  ] via the bases ( septel ) . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] entered into the current [ORG ADC  ] in 1988 , with additional protocols dating from 2002 . 
Unless one of the parties backs out earlier , the [ORG ADC  ] is in effect until February 2011 and is automatically renewed thereafter in one-year increments . 
On various occasions [MISC Spanish  ] officials ( e.g. , [ORG MOD  ] Secretary General for Policy [PER Luis Cuesta  ] ) have told us [LOC Spain  ] is very satisfied with the [ORG ADC  ] , but will seek various " improvements " in the context of renegotiating a long term extension of the agreement when the time comes . 
They invariably describe these improvements as minor and reiterate their overall satisfaction with the [LOC ADC.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) To our surprise -- and , from what we have been able to gather , also to her subordinates' surprise -- [PER Chacon  ] in October mentioned to [ORG SECDEF  ] that she wanted the [LOC U.S.  ] to elevate the [ORG ADC  ] to treaty status . 
This happened when the met very briefly on the margins of the [ORG NATO  ] ministerial . 
[PER Chacon  ] was convinced [ORG SECDEF  ] responded favorably and so advised the media . 
Thereafter , [PER Cuesta  ] suggested to us that [PER Chacon  ] believed an agreement ratified by the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senate  ] would underscore the importance of the [ORG ADC  ] and the bilateral relationship . 
Sources from the [MISC Spanish Section of  ] the joint [ORG Permanent Committee  ] which manages implementation of the [ORG ADC  ] have told us they did not know [PER Chacon  ] was going to push the idea of a treaty ( and they seemed to have reservations about the idea ) . 
The [ORG MOD  ] Director General for Policy has told this was something on which [LOC Spain  ] would not insist , and we understand the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG DATT  ] in [LOC Washington  ] has made similar statements to OSD contacts. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) However , whatever hope we may have harbored that the [ORG MOD  ] would soon back away from this idea has been shattered by subsequent conversations with the [ORG MOD  ] and by her public statements . 
The Ambassador has raised the matter with her twice in recent weeks , and it was clear that she remained interested in pursuing a treaty . 
During a November 25 appearance in congress , [PER Chacon  ] again announced that [LOC Spain  ] wanted to renew the [ORG ADC  ] and said that , while the agreement was being implemented " satisfactorily " in both countries , [LOC Spain  ] would propose that the [ORG USG  ] raise it to the level of a treaty . 
In answering hostile questions about whether the [ORG Zapatero  ] administration would continue to allow the [LOC U.S.  ] access to [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] , [PER Chacon  ] defended the [ORG ADC  ] . 
Nonetheless , she said the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] would in 2009 thoroughly examine the implementation of the [ORG ADC  ] in hopes of engaging the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration on suggested improvements . 
She referenced her October encounter with [ORG SECDEF  ] and described the [ORG ADC  ] 's renewal as " pending . 
" She said [ORG SECDEF  ] viewed positively her " formal petition that the weight of the agreement be exactly the same for both countries " and assured [MISC Spanish  ] legislators that the [ORG MOD  ] would work the issue with the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Chacon  ] is young and came to her position earlier this year with little experience in defense matters , but it would be a serious mistake to underestimate her or fail to respond substantively to her interest in this issue . 
She is a savvy politician and close to President [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
It is rumored that [ORG Zapatero  ] plans not to run again in 2012 and that he wants [PER Chacon  ] to be his successor . 
Whether or not that is true , [PER Chacon  ] is a power player here , and we can be sure that her interest in seeing the [LOC U.S.  ] make the [ORG ADC  ] a treaty is more than a whim . 
The news that Secretary Gates will stay on at DOD under the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] will only strengthen her determination to continue on the course she has set . 
We suspect she has calculated that a treaty enhances [LOC Spain  ] 's status ( and hers ) and also quiets the left in her party who are less than enthusiastic about the [LOC U.S.  ] military presence in [LOC Spain  ] , but who will be flattered by this evidence that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" takes [LOC Spain  ] seriously . 
" Whatever the case , we need to give [PER Chacon  ] a serious response and the sooner the better . 
We have of course pointed out that , as the [MISC Spanish  ] say , the [ORG ADC  ] has functioned very well for both countries . 
To the extent that the [MISC Spanish  ] want to seek improvements to the existing arrangement , we have made clear we are standing by to hear their suggestions ( so far , the only concrete example they have given us is that because the agreement lacks treaty status in the [LOC U.S.  ] , their personnel sometimes have problems with taxes , driver 's licenses , etc . 
) . 
We have also explained that treaty ratification in the [LOC U.S.  ] is far more complex than in [LOC Spain  ] , where the President of Government has much greater control over the legislative branch . 
In their most recent conversation , the Ambassador persuaded [PER Chacon  ] that it was time to push this issue back down below the ministerial level for further discussion , but in order to have that discussion , we need instructions we can use in explaining the position ( at least initially ) of the [ORG USG  ] regarding treaty status for the [ORG ADC  ] . 
The longer we wait , the more often [PER Chacon  ] is likely to raise the issue publicly , creating a situation in which it may become very difficult for the [ORG Zapatero  ] government to back down ( if indeed we do not intend to pursue treaty status ) . 
We of course defer to the experts in the [ORG Departments of State and Defense  ] , but we strongly recommend that in addition to providing at least a tentative reaction on the treaty issue , we also convey every disposition to look at possible improvements to the [ORG ADC  ] and specifically address ways in which we might alleviate the concerns the [MISC Spanish  ] have expressed regarding the treatment of their personnel in the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC AGUIRRE</pre></code>  ]
