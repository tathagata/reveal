Blome  ] , Minister Counselor , [LOC DOS  ] , [LOC Economic  ] and Political Affairs ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
Key Points: -- ( U ) Three senior leaders of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ( [ORG MB  ] ) in [LOC Egypt  ] including Deputy Supreme Guide [PER Mahmoud Ezzat  ] , Spokesman [PER Essam El Eryan  ] and [ORG MB  ] " [MISC Mufti  ] " [PER Abdel Rahman El Barr  ] were detained by security forces the morning of February 8 along with twelve other members of the [LOC MB.  ] -- ( C ) According to media reports the group is being held " under investigation " for an initial period of 15-days . 
[ORG MB  ] sources tell us that the group was originally detained , and their homes searched , under the Emergency Law but that their detention will likely be justified under an " investigative file " that will opened to their lawyers next week. -- ( C ) There are no formal charges against those detained . 
Media reports indicate that accusations under investigation include membership in a " banned " organization that threatens the " peace and security of the state " and spreading the " extremist ideas " of [PER Sayed Qutb  ] . 
The detainees are reportedly not cooperating with investigators. -- ( C ) The arrests come in the lead-up to the 2010 parliamentary elections and during the [ORG MB  ] 's own internal elections for its 100-man [ORG Shura Council  ] , its legislative body . 
They also follow recent internal [ORG MB  ] elections for a new [ORG Guidance Bureau  ] and a new Supreme Guide. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Members of the [ORG MB  ] 's [ORG Guidance Bureau  ] have been arrested several times in recent years . 
However , the detention of these leading figures , including the newly elected Deputy Supreme Guide , seems to represent an escalation . 
Most observers here see the move as part of a continuing [MISC GOE  ] campaign to suppress the [ORG NDP  ] 's only significant political challenge ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections . 
However , there is some danger that the move could backfire on the government , presenting an already weakened [ORG MB  ] in a sympathetic light , and highlighting [MISC GOE  ] insecurity ahead of elections. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment Continued: It is unclear how the [MISC GOE  ] will handle this case . 
There is precedent for both the transfer of [ORG MB  ] defendants to a military court and jail time in a military prison ( as in the 2008 case against Deputy Supreme Guide [PER Khariat El Shatter  ] ) , and the release of defendants on bail after several months in detention while the investigation against them remains on the books ( as in the November 2009 release of [ORG Guidance Bureau  ] member [PER Abdel Moneim Al Fotouh  ] ) . 
End Comment. --------------------------- New High Profile [ORG MB Arrests  ] --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Three high-ranking members of the [ORG MB  ] 's [ORG Guidance Bureau  ] ( the group 's 16-member administrative body ) were detained by [ORG State Security  ] forces with twelve other lower ranking members on the morning of February 8 . 
The group includes newly-named Deputy Supreme Guide [PER Mahmoud Ezzat  ] , [ORG MB  ] spokesman ( one of three recently-named spokesmen for the group ) [PER Essam El Eryan  ] , and [ORG MB  ] " [MISC Mufti  ] " ( or religious leader ) [PER Abdel Rahman El Barr  ] . 
A fourth member of the [ORG Guidance Bureau  ] , [PER Mohie Hamed  ] , avoided arrest . 
According to [LOC Ikhwanweb  ] , the [ORG MB  ] 's [MISC English-language  ] website , [PER Hamed  ] has been ordered to appear before the Supreme [ORG State Security Prosecutor  ] . 
One of the twelve other [ORG MB  ] detainees arrested along with them has reportedly been transferred to a hospital for heart [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000197 002 OF 003 surgery following a heart attack during his arrest . 
[ORG MB  ] sources have reported to the media that those detained have declined to give any statements to investigators . 
These latest high-profile arrests come amid continued reports of arrests of dozens of rank and file [ORG MB  ] members outside of [LOC Cairo  ] reportedly as they gather in preparation for elections of the [ORG MB  ] 's 100-man [ORG Shura Council  ] ( the group 's legislative body ) scheduled for April 2010. ------- Charges ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) No formal charges have been announced by the Public Prosecutor . 
[ORG MB Parliamentary Bloc  ] leader and Spokesman [PER Saad Katatni  ] told [LOC PolOff  ] on February 10 that the group was originally detained , and their homes searched , under the Emergency Law ( Ref A ) , but said he expected any " investigation " or " prosecution " would be conducted according to the criminal code . 
[PER Katatni  ] said lawyers for the detained have been told they will be given access by the [ORG Prosecutor  ] to the " investigative file " against the group next Tuesday February 16 . 
According to media reports the group remains in detention " under investigation " for the next 15 days ( this can be renewed several times for a period of up to six months by the [ORG Prosecutor  ] himself ) . 
Charges under investigation include belonging to a " banned " organization that threatens the " peace and security of the state , " a charge commonly made against detained members of the [ORG MB  ] . 
For the first time members of the group have been charged with participation in a faction of the [ORG MB  ] that adheres to the " takfiri " or " un-Islamic " doctrine of [PER Sayed Qutb  ] , which deems those who do not follow it " infidels " and thus , according to the Public Prosecutor , supports the formation of a military wing that would carry out armed resistance against the regime . 
( [PER Note: Qutb  ] was executed by former President [PER Nasser  ] in 1966 for having led an attempt to violently overthrow the regime . 
Both current Supreme Guide [PER Mohammed Badie  ] and now arrested Deputy Guide [PER Ezzat  ] were detained in 1965 along with [PER Qutb  ] . 
They were later released by President [PER Anwar Sadat  ] .

) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) There is a precedent for long detentions of [ORG MB  ] leaders while " under investigation . 
" Three other high-ranking members of the [ORG MB  ] 's [ORG Guidance Bureau  ] , including Dr. [PER Abdel Meneim Al Fotouh  ] , were detained for several months in 2009 while " under investigation . 
" ( Ref B ) While all three have been released on bail , the cases against them are still pending ( Ref C ) . 
( [PER Note: Fotouh  ] was released in November 2009 and subsequently lost his seat on the [ORG MB  ] 's [ORG Guidance Bureau  ] in December elections ( Ref D ) . 
End Note ) . ----------- [ORG MB Response  ] ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Reports of the arrests first surfaced the morning of February 8 on the [ORG MB  ] 's [MISC English-language  ] website [LOC Ikhwanweb  ] . 
The following day ( February 9 ) [LOC Ikhwanweb  ] published an [ORG MB  ] statement condemning the arrests . 
In the statement the group said it believed the arrests were linked to [ORG MB  ] support for " the resistance of the besieged people of [LOC Gaza  ] " and are intended to " undermine participation by the group ahead of the legislative elections later this year . 
" The [ORG MB  ] also affirmed that despite the arrests it will continue on its " missionary course " and the " path ( it has ) chosen for attaining the country 's welfare " through " peaceful reformist methods despite...restrictions paced to liberties . 
" [ORG MB  ] members were reportedly present in large numbers outside the offices of the Public Prosecutor on Tuesday February 9 . 
The group also staged a small protest in [LOC Suez  ] against the ongoing detention of other [ORG MB  ] members despite the end of their court-ordered detention period. -------------------------------------------- [ORG MB Arrests  ] as a [ORG Pre-emptive Political Strike CAIRO  ] 00000197 003 OF 003 -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG MB  ] lawyer [PER Abdel Menem Abdel Maqsoud  ] told the independent daily [ORG El Shorouk  ] that he believed the [MISC GOE  ] targeted [ORG MB  ] " organizational leaders " like former [ORG MB  ] Secretary General and now Deputy Guide [PER Mahmoud Ezzat  ] to hamper preparations for the [ORG Shura Council  ] elections in June 2010 and the [ORG People 's Assembly  ] elections in November 2010 . 
He added that the level of the arrests sent the message that no one was immune . 
[ORG Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies  ] analyst [PER Amr El Choubaki  ] called the arrests a " pre-emptive strike to foil " [ORG MB  ] election preparations. --------------------------------------------- --------- Prospects for [ORG MB Participation  ] in a [ORG National Coalition  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) According to political commentator , University Professor , and head of the " [ORG Coalition Against Succession  ] " [PER Hassan Nafaa  ] , the arrests also were part of an effort to stop any potential coordination between the [ORG MB  ] and other opposition political groups in the lead-up to the elections . 
Before the arrests , [ORG Democratic Front Party  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX confirmed to [LOC PolOff  ] press reports that he and others were working with various political movements , including the [ORG MB  ] , to form a unified national coalition under the banner of a " Conference for [MISC All Egyptians  ] . 
" XXXXXXXXXXXX was surprised the intended conference had surfaced in the media after he and fellow organizer , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , had taken pains to " quietly plan " for months . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed the [ORG MB  ] would be part of the effort . 
Reporting on plans for an " [MISC All Egyptians  ] " conference was included in press articles covering a February 3 event held by the [ORG Press Syndicate 's Freedom Committee  ] ( headed by known [ORG MB  ] member [PER Mohamed Abdel Quddous  ] ) entitled the " Future of [LOC Egypt  ] . 
" At the conference , which included among others an [ORG NDP  ] MP and [MISC Harb  ] , the now arrested [PER Essam El Eryan  ] reportedly told the group that the [ORG MB  ] was willing to " make compromises for the sake of having a national coalition " to pursue " comprehensive reform .
