Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy - [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( S ) This message contains an action request ( para 4 ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief June 17 that xxxxxxxxxxxx in [LOC Tripoli  ] assessed that the Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) was deliberately delaying the implementation of its commitments under the [ORG Chemical Weapons Convention  ] ( [ORG CWC  ] ) to destroy its remaining stockpile of declared chemical weapons ( approximately 25 MT of mustard agent and 860 MT of chemical agent precursor chemicals ) . 
The deadline established by the [ORG CWC Conference  ] of the [ORG States Parties for  ] the destruction of [LOC Libya  ] 's mustard stockpile is December 31 , 2010 ; destruction of the remaining inventory of precursor chemicals is to be completed no later than December 31 , 2011 . 
The [MISC Italian  ] company [ORG SIPSA  ] has been working with the [MISC Libyan  ] side to design and build the [ORG Rabta Toxic Chemicals Destruction Facility  ] at which the destruction is to take place ; however , the [ORG GOL  ] has repeatedly delayed signing a contract with [ORG SIPSA  ] . 
[ORG SIPSA  ] has continued its work , but recently told xxxxxxxxxxxx it judged that even if construction were to begin immediately , it was highly unlikely that the [ORG GOL  ] would meet the deadlines for destruction of its mustard agent and precursors . 
2 . 
( S ) xxxxxxxxxxxx told xxxxxxxxxxxx that al-Qadhafi wanted to " play cat and mouse " with the [ORG Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  ] ( [ORG OPCW  ] ) in an effort to secure further , unspecified compensation for [LOC Libya  ] 's decision to abandon its [ORG Weapons of Mass Destruction  ] ( [ORG WMD  ] ) programs. xxxxxxxxxxxx offered his assessment that [LOC Italy  ] and other [MISC European  ] states parties were inclined to view the delay in signing the [ORG SIPSA  ] contract as a strictly technical issue for the [ORG OPCW  ] , an approach he judged to be mistaken . 
He said the collective assessment of the xxxxxxxxxxxx in [LOC Tripoli  ] was that the [ORG GOL  ] was deliberately slow-rolling implementation of its [ORG WMD  ] commitments , including the [ORG SIPSA  ] contract ; however , xxxxxxxxxxxx had been reluctant to raise the issue with the [ORG GOL  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
3 . 
( S ) Comment: The [ORG GOL  ] has been credited with having largely met its [ORG WMD  ] commitments ; however , the recent track record is worrisome and suggests that it may be deliberately delaying implementation of commitments it has undertaken under the rubric of the [MISC U.S.-U.K.-Libya Tri-lateral Steering  ] and [ORG Coordination Committee  ] ( [ORG TSCC  ] ) and multi-lateral mechanisms such as the [ORG OPCW  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has delayed since November 2007 signing a [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] agreement for the return of spent nuclear fuel ( the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] agreement ) ; delayed signing a parallel [MISC Russia-Libya  ] agreement ; given no detail on plans to sell its uranium yellowcake stockpile ; delayed signing the [ORG SIPSA  ] contract and delayed providing greater detail on its proposed retention of the sandbag enclosure at the [LOC Rabta  ] facility . 
4 . 
( S ) Action request: Reftel instructs Post to demarche appropriate [MISC Libyan  ] officials to urge greater transparency with respect to the status of preparations to destroy its chemical weapons and its proposed retention of the sandbag enclosure . 
We have requested a meeting with Dr. [PER Ahmed Hesnawy  ] , head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National CW Authority  ] , to convey the demarche and related non-paper . 
Post requests guidance from the [ORG Department as  ] to whether and how to incorporate the information above on the [ORG SIPSA  ] contract and al-Qadhafi 's reported intervention into the demarche .
