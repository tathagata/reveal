( C ) [PER Skarphedinsson  ] also spoke about defense issues including the closure of the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) . 
Acknowledging the government 's focus on [LOC Icesave  ] , he nevertheless expressed optimism that a decision on [ORG IDA  ] 's future would come by year end . 
Some of the [ORG IDA  ] 's duties would likely transfer to the [ORG Coast Guard  ] , which falls under the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
He hoped , however , that most defense matters would remain with the [ORG MFA  ] . 
He stressed that , no matter how the reorganization turns out , [LOC Iceland  ] will continue to uphold its [ORG NATO  ] obligations . 
When speaking of [ORG NATO  ] commitments , the minister specifically stated that [LOC Iceland  ] intends to take part in the [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercise in 2010 . 
( Comment . 
This information contradicts rumors we heard earlier that [LOC Iceland  ] was considering postponing next year 's [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercise as a cost-saving measure . 
End comment .

( C ) The Minister said that [LOC Iceland  ] also remains committed to the effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said that , while he personally has concerns about the prospects for the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [MISC Icelandic  ] government understands its responsibility to contribute as a [ORG NATO  ] member . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has no intention , he said , of completely withdrawing its personnel from [LOC Afghanistan  ] and has never even discussed it as an option. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Noting the occasional activity of [MISC Russian  ] planes in [LOC Iceland  ] 's air space , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] said he could not overstate the importance of the [LOC High North  ] . 
The [MISC Russians  ] , he claimed , have specifically stated that the [LOC High North  ] is a top strategic priority . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] then , bluntly , used the [LOC High North  ] discussion as an opportunity to chastise the [LOC U.S.  ] for closing down the [LOC Keflavik Airbase  ] in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The decision , he said , was " a bloody mistake . 
" He noted that he understood the reasoning behind the decision and the need to reduce costs , but believes that the [LOC U.S.  ] should have maintained some sort of presence in [LOC Iceland  ] to protect its interests in the [LOC High North  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] Accession Process --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Iceland  ] 's bid to join the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Skarphedinnsson  ] said that everything is progressing smoothly . 
[LOC Iceland  ] should have answers for the [ORG EU  ] accession questionnaire by the [ORG EU  ] 's November 16 deadline . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] believes that this deadline was intentionally set to ensure that [LOC Iceland  ] 's candidacy cannot be evaluated at December 's [ORG European Council  ] summit . 
Delaying consideration until spring would avoid the perception that [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership is fast-tracked at the expense of other candidates . 
The most likely scenario , he opined , is that [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership application would be discussed at the March summit of the [ORG European Council  ] and that accession negotiations will begin soon afterwards .
