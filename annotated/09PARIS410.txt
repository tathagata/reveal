( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Key points: -- Your visit comes at a historic time .

[PER Sarkozy  ] wants to get off on the right foot with you and will respect your goals . 
End key points. --------------------------------------------- ------------- EARLY FOREIGN POLICY GOALS: RETURN TO [MISC EUROPEAN  ] LEADERSHIP AND THE ALLIANCE WITH THE [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Since the beginning of his Presidency in 2007 , [PER Sarkozy  ] has targeted his foreign policy efforts on re-establishing [LOC France  ] , s image as a leader in [LOC Europe  ] ( and the world ) , following the debacle of [LOC France  ] , s “no” vote on the [ORG EU  ] constitution in 2005 . 
Through personal intervention , often at the cost of ruffling the feathers of his [MISC German  ] and [MISC British  ] rivals , he sought to make the [ORG EU  ] a more dynamic and active world player . 
His personal intervention and leadership during the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis , the economic crisis , and the [LOC Gaza  ] fighting won grudging acceptance and even approval from [MISC European  ] leaders who , even though offended by his brash dominance of the limelight , recognized that he was making the [ORG EU  ] an effective player . 
He pursued a similar campaign to return to the heart of [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC Atlantic  ] alliance . 
He focused [MISC French  ] and [MISC European  ] attention on strengthening the [MISC European  ] Security and [ORG Defense Policy  ] ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) , taking advantage of crises in [LOC Africa  ] and off the [MISC Somali  ] coast to cobble together effective responses with a [MISC European  ] imprimatur . 
At the same time , he stage-managed a year-long review of [LOC France  ] , s security posture for the 21st century , which will re-allocate resources across the [MISC French  ] military and use money saved to modernize its equipment . 
These efforts culminated in a forced political march toward a domestic debate and a ( successful ) Parliamentary vote , not only on [LOC France  ] , s full reintegration into [ORG NATO  ] but on the totality of [PER Sarkozy  ] , s foreign policy. ----------------------------- MOVING FORWARD IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) With [LOC France  ] , s full return to [ORG NATO  ] assured , [PER Sarkozy  ] will want to want to show that [LOC France  ] and [LOC Europe  ] have a more effective voice in decisions , particularly on [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( where [MISC French  ] leadership can galvanize other allies to do more ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is a strong supporter of the allied action in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but there is little popular support for the policy or public understanding of the threat . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , s recent appointment of [PER Pierre Lellouche  ] to mirror the role of [PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] is a positive signal that [LOC France  ] will be engaged and active ; at [PER Sarkozy  ] , s behest , [PER Lellouche  ] is seeking to organize a gendarme training unit in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , in advance of the [ORG NATO  ] Summit . 
But [LOC France  ] is constrained by issues of operational tempo and the financial crisis , as well as by concerns about the strategy , goals , and time-line for success in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] , who plans to visit [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] in May , will likely delay any announcement of increased commitment , civilian or military , until after that trip . 
Ironically , announcement of increased [LOC U.S.  ] force participation has lifted some of the urgency from our allies , including [LOC France  ] . 
Your discussion will be important to help [PER Sarkozy  ] demonstrate to his public that the [LOC U.S.  ] is consulting with him before acting and that there is a new strategy that will be better coordinated and more effective . 
Addressing the summer [MISC Afghan  ] election plans -- and pledging better coordination among allies in theater , while pressing for a stronger civilian commitment -- will be key to securing increased [MISC French  ] participation . 
[MISC French  ] officials view [LOC Pakistan  ] as intrinsically linked with the challenges and issues in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , [LOC France  ] is a relative newcomer to [LOC Pakistan  ] and relies heavily on the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC United Kingdom  ] for information and analysis . 
[LOC France  ] has proposed regular trilateral consultations with [LOC France  ] , the [LOC UK  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] to better coordinate our policies in the region. ----------------------------------------- SEEKING A GREATER ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] shares most of our strategic objectives in the [LOC Middle East  ] , from achieving [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace to preserving [LOC Lebanon  ] , s independence and sovereignty to dissuading [LOC Iran  ] from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability . 
When he differs with us on tactics , he is not -- as was sometimes the case with previous [MISC French  ] leaders -- being difficult simply for the sake of appearing distinct from the [LOC U.S.  ] To the contrary , [PER Sarkozy  ] , s approach is fueled by pragmatism ; to get results , he has abandoned policies that , from his perspective , have outlived their usefulness and launched others ( e.g. , engaging [LOC Syria  ] ) that have sometimes put him out in front of [LOC Washington  ] . 
He views our own effort at talking to [LOC Damascus  ] with a certain sense of vindication and would respond well if you were to ask his assessment of [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] . 
Be prepared to hear that the glass is half-full . 
Although [PER Sarkozy  ] feels stung by [PER Asad  ] , s failure to send an ambassador to [LOC Beirut  ] as promised , he and his advisors have opted to downplay this failure and remain convinced that engaging [LOC Syria  ] has paid dividends . 
As for [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] hosted [MISC Lebanese  ] President [PER Sleiman  ] in [LOC Paris  ] March 16-18 for a state visit timed to bolster [PER Sleiman  ] in advance of [LOC Lebanon  ] , s parliamentary election . 
Whatever the election outcome , [LOC France  ] wants to see another unity government in [LOC Beirut  ] -- not out of love for [ORG Hizballah  ] and its allies , but to avoid subjecting [LOC Lebanon  ] to additional fighting that [ORG Hizballah  ] would almost certainly win and which could also spark a more serious regional crisis. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) By the same token , [PER Sarkozy  ] sees no credible alternative to [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation . 
He agrees with the ideals expressed in the [ORG Quartet Principles  ] , but assesses that the status quo hurts [PER Fatah  ] and the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] more than [ORG Hamas  ] . 
He would welcome any initiative to repackage the [ORG Quartet Principles  ] -- indeed , he allowed FM Kouchner to propose that the [ORG EU  ] take a less dogmatic approach on engaging [ORG Hamas  ] -- in a way that allows the international community to work with the next [MISC Palestinian  ] government . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] respects Special Enjoy [PER Mitchell  ] but may tell you , as he told Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , that [PER Mitchell  ] is &too wise.8 [PER Sarkozy  ] favors bold steps and has not abandoned his idea of convening a [LOC Middle East  ] peace summit . 
Though he understands that the timing is not optimal , you can expect him to press for action . 
He is also keen to take up President [PER Asad  ] , s offer that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] co-sponsor a resumption of [MISC Syrian-Israeli  ] negotiations . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] is the toughest of the [ORG EU  ] leaders , yet he harbors no illusions about the likelihood of further [ORG UNSC  ] movement at the moment ; he will likely suggest that you postpone engaging [LOC Tehran  ] until after Iran’s upcoming presidential election. -------------------------------- [LOC RUSSIA  ] - DIALOGUE , NOT ISOLATION -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] came to power determined to do away with the personal diplomacy of previous [MISC French  ] presidents and to take a hard look at [MISC French  ] interests in the relationship with [LOC Russia  ] . 
However , during the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis that erupted at the start of the [MISC French  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency , he fell back again on his penchant for personal engagement and testing the word of his counterparts . 
While wary of [MISC Russian  ] intentions in [LOC Georgia  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] has made clear his belief that [LOC Georgia  ] and other areas of disagreement with [LOC Russia  ] are best handled through diplomatic engagement and not through isolation . 
He has thus pushed for talks on a partnership accord between [LOC Russia  ] and the [ORG EU  ] to proceed ( they are currently on a very slow track ) as an inducement for better [MISC Russian  ] behavior . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has also sought to engage and cultivate [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] , over Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] , in the apparent hope of strengthening relative moderates in [LOC Moscow.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Like other [MISC French  ] officials , [PER Sarkozy  ] is looking for some indication of where we want to take [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relations and how we concretely intend to “reset” the relationship . 
While [PER Sarkozy  ] surprised aides and allies by responding positively to [PER Medvedev  ] , s initiative to renegotiate [LOC Europe  ] , s security architecture , his gambit that this should take place inside the [ORG OSCE  ] ( where the focus will be on [MISC Russian  ] behavior and not the structure of the western alliances ) seems to have won some traction . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] may warn of the political consequences , including in foreign policy terms , of a steady deterioration of socio-economic conditions in [LOC Russia  ] caused by the financial crisis . 
He might also couple any advocacy of sustained engagement with [LOC Moscow  ] with criticism of the feckless and divided leaderships , as he sees them , in [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine.  ] ---------- AND BEYOND ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is trying to activate [MISC French  ] policy and influence elsewhere but with less success . 
In [LOC Latin America  ] , he sees [LOC Brazil  ] , s [PER Lula  ] as a key partner with a shared interest in helping transform [LOC Cuba  ] . 
His [LOC Asia  ] policy is a shambles . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] are still seething that [PER Sarkozy  ] vacillated about attending the [MISC Olympics  ] last August and met with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] in [LOC Gdansk  ] in December . 
The [MISC Japanese  ] have told us they feel neglected , particularly compared with the attention lavished by [PER Sarkozy  ] , s predecessor . 
And [PER Sarkozy  ] , s determination to turn around [MISC French  ] Africa policy is still a work in progress ) - but one where we and [LOC France  ] can continue to cooperate closely . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] will also be interested in your onward travel to [LOC Turkey  ] , where bilateral relations have long been soured by [MISC France’s  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] , s opposition to full [ORG EU  ] membership. --------------- ECONOMIC ISSUES --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) President [PER Sarkozy  ] sees the current crisis as vindication of the [MISC French  ] model of state interventionism in the economy . 
Although domestically he has set in motion reforms designed to open the economy to more market-friendly forces , his Gaullist instincts , never dormant , have been on prominent display during the crisis . 
In the run-up to the [ORG G20 London Summit  ] , he and his government have used the [LOC United States  ] as public foil to rally support for tighter global regulation of the economy . 
He boasted repeatedly of having “imposed” the initial [ORG G20  ] meeting in November on [LOC Washington  ] and generally has downplayed [MISC U.S.-supported  ] work on crisis-related issues in the [MISC Financial Stability Forum  ] and elsewhere. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) With [ORG EU  ] partners , he has had mixed success in pushing for a more robust state role in defending industry , a case he often makes by invoking vague arguments that “the [MISC Americans  ] do it , so we should , too.” He gets more traction in [LOC Europe  ] from his government’s support for regulating trade based on &societal8 preferences ( against [LOC U.S.  ] agriculture for example ) or a priniciple of [MISC European  ] preference . 
You will have had the chance to discuss economic issues in [LOC London  ] , but a reminder to President [PER Sarkozy  ] that our economic relationship is central to our broader partnership would be timely. ------------ DOMESTICALLY ------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] dominates the [MISC French  ] political landscape . 
As in foreign policy , he is the driving force . 
He charged into office in 2007 pledging to reform everything from labor laws to the university system . 
But the sharp economic downturn has slowed many of these ambitious initiatives , and [PER Sarkozy  ] , s approval ratings languish between 40 and 45 percent , never having recovered from an early wave of bad publicity about his personal foibles . 
His energetic , occasionally impulsive leadership style has been a lightning rod for criticism , as has his propensity to rely on a relatively small group of advisors . 
Nonetheless , [PER Sarkozy  ] remains fully in command of the politics , policy , and direction of [LOC France  ] ; he will continue to do so at least until the 2012 presidential election. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Mr. President , everyone at [LOC Embassy Paris  ] ( and , indeed , all of [LOC France  ] ) looks forward with great excitement and profound pride to welcoming you to [LOC Strasbourg  ] next month .
