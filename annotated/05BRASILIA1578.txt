( C ) Summary . 
In separate meetings with President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's international affairs advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] on 8 June ( Ambassador and PolCouns with [PER Garcia  ] and his deputy , [PER Marcel Biato  ] ) and new foreign ministry ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Antonio de  ] [PER Aguiar Patriota  ] ( Ambassador , visiting WHA DAS Fisk and PolCouns with [PER Patriota  ] and [ORG MRE  ] [ORG UN  ] division chief [PER Glivania Oliveira  ] ) , mission made ref c demarche on [ORG USG  ] concerns regarding the situation in [LOC Haiti  ] .

) End summary . 
[PER LULA  ] FOREIGN AFFAIRS ADVISOR MARCO AURELIO GARCIA <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Using ref c guidance , Ambassador and PolCouns indicated [ORG USG  ] appreciation for [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership role in [ORG MINUSTAH  ] , but stressed that the [ORG USG  ] is increasingly concerned about a major deterioration in security , especially in [PER Port  ] au Prince . 
Referring candidly to information provided in refs a , Ambassador and PolCouns recounted [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about expansion of gang incursions in the city center and port area , the wave of kidnappings , and increasingly audacious attacks that are creating a climate of fear and instability . 
They noted the meeting between Secretary Rice and [PER FM Amorim  ] in [LOC Florida  ] on the margins of the [ORG OAS General Assembly  ] in which the Secretary cited the need for firm [ORG MINUSTAH  ] action and the possibility that the [LOC U.S.  ] may be asked to send troops at some point ( to which [PER FM Amorim  ] reportedly replied [LOC U.S.  ] forces would be welcome under [ORG UN  ] authorities ) . 
Ambassador and PolCouns also stressed continued [ORG USG  ] insistence that all efforts must be made to keep [PER Aristide  ] from returning to [LOC Haiti  ] or influencing the political process , and asked whether the [ORG GOB  ] also remains firm on that point. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] visited [LOC Haiti  ] for several days in October 2004 , and reiterated some views he had gleaned from that visit: i.e. , that security is a critical component , but must move in tandem with assistance efforts that create immediate and visible benefits for [MISC Haitians  ] , and with an inclusive political process . 
He said that the [ORG GOB  ] still believes some elements of [LOC Lavalas  ] are willing to become involved in a constructive dialogue and should be encouraged , but said the [ORG GOB  ] remains firm in the view that [PER Aristide  ] " does not fit in with a democratic political future " in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] seemed somewhat surprised by [ORG USG  ] views on the critical level of violence , and also seemed cautious on the issue of introduction of [LOC U.S.  ] forces , but would not be drawn into discussion . 
However , his deputy , [PER Marcel Biato  ] , followed up with a number of specific questions regarding [ORG USG  ] assessments of flashpoints and the potential for a broader outbreak of violence in the next few weeks . 
PolCouns and [PER Biato  ] undertook to stay in contact on developments. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PolCouns asked [PER Garcia  ] whether the [ORG GOB  ] is concerned that [MISC Brazilian  ] casualties could spark popular reaction in [LOC Brazil  ] that would affect the [ORG GOB  ] 's ability to maintain forces in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] replied that [LOC Brazil  ] 's mission in [LOC Haiti  ] " has no shortage of critics " in [LOC Brazil  ] , and " even one [MISC Brazilian  ] casualty " killed in violence ( as opposed to accident or health problems ) could cause turbulence . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that the situation is not unlike the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] , and he observed the [ORG USG  ] is not permitting regular release of images of returning [LOC U.S.  ] casualties/KIAs in the media . 
That said , [PER Garcia  ] did not indicate any weakening of [ORG GOB  ] resolve in continuing its presence in [ORG MINUSTAH  ] . 
Indeed , he said that [LOC Haiti  ] ( along with [LOC Bolivia  ] ) remains one of [LOC Brazil  ] 's most crucial foreign policy priorities , as it is the textbook case of the need for regional powers to work together in an effort to stabilize/democratize a potentially failing state . 
FOREIGN MINISTRY U/S FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS [PER ANTONIO  ] DE AGUIAR [PER PATRIOTA  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) WHA DAS [PER Dan Fisk  ] , in [LOC Brasilia  ] with the [ORG U.S. Global Forum IV  ] delegation ( see septels ) and accompanied by Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] and PolCounselor , called on newly appointed Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Antonio de  ] [PER Aguiar Patriota  ] on 10 June to discuss [LOC Haiti  ] . 
( Note: [PER Patriota  ] assumed his new duties on 10 June and was previously chief of staff to FM [PER Amorim  ] . 
End note . 
) Using ref c points , [PER Fisk  ] emphasized that the [ORG USG  ] is grateful for [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership in [ORG MINUSTAH  ] , but expressed [ORG USG  ] concern about growing violence , saying that the gangs are " losing their fear " of international PKO forces , creating violent instability and conditions for [PER Aristide  ] to exert his influence . 
He asked for [ORG GOB  ] views on how the international community could keep [PER Aristide  ] out of [MISC Haitian  ] affairs and assist [ORG MINUSTAH  ] in reestablishing credibility. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Patriota  ] acknowledged that the situation on the ground had become less stable in recent weeks , but opined that violence appears to be " cyclical " in [LOC Haiti  ] , with spikes and lulls . 
He understood that there are concerns being expressed that [ORG MINUSTAH  ] has not been sufficiently robust , but also observed -- and repeated -- that such criticisms , when made publicly , can further undermine the force 's credibility . 
( Note: Ambassador and DAS [PER Fisk  ] replied that there was little that could be done about negative media reports on [ORG MINUSTAH  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Patriota  ] also said it is important to send other clear signals of consistency and resolve , and in this context the [ORG GOB  ] hopes [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG UN  ] DPKO can arrive asap on decisions and announcements on both a 12 month mandate extension and a new [ORG MINUSTAH  ] military commander . 
On the latter point , [PER Patriota  ] noted that FM [PER Amorim  ] had spoken by phone with [PER SG Annan  ] in the past few days . 
[PER Patriota  ] confirmed [LOC Brazil  ] has a candidate ready , [MISC Brazilian  ] Army three-star General [PER Tella Amaral  ] , who currently heads [MISC Brazilian  ] army intelligence . 
Current [ORG MINUSTAH  ] commander [PER Heleno  ] is available to remain throughout the technical rollover of the mandate , [PER Patriota  ] affirmed , adding that [LOC Brazil  ] , as the main troop contributor , would expect to retain overall military command in a new mandate. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On [PER Aristide  ] , [PER Patriota  ] said that the mere fact of [PER Aristide  ] 's existence will always be problematic in terms of his influence on some elements of [MISC Haitian  ] society , however much the international community works to isolate him . 
That said , the [ORG GOB  ] had been encouraged by recent [MISC South African  ] Government commitments to [LOC Brazil  ] that the [ORG GSA  ] would not allow [PER Aristide  ] to use his exile there to undertake political efforts ( NFI ) . 
It always remains important to include in political dialogue those elements of [LOC Lavalas  ] that are willing to " leave [PER Aristide  ] behind them , " [PER Patriota  ] said . 
[PER Patriota  ] and [PER Fisk  ] agreed that accelerating and enhancing assistance projects that have direct impact on [MISC Haitians  ] remains a key priority , and that the [ORG GOB  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] should work together in this . 
[PER Patriota  ] observed that [LOC Brazil  ] has 10 assistance projects underway , in cooperation with [ORG IFI  ] 's , other countries or on its own. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Neither [PER Garcia  ] nor [PER Patriota  ] seemed seized with the same degree of urgency on the security situation in [LOC Haiti  ] as the [ORG USG  ] , as reflected in refs a and c . 
That said , we believe they will take our points into careful account and weigh them in the context of the Secretary 's conversation with FM [PER Amorim  ] at the [ORG OAS GA  ] and new information being brought back to [LOC Brasilia  ] from [LOC Haiti  ] this weekend by MRE envoy [PER Goncalo Mourao  ] . 
For now , the [ORG GOB  ] seems committed to its long-stated strategy: pursuing , in tandem , security , assistance and political dialogue as requisites for elections and stability , with a [MISC Brazilian  ] in command of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] .
