Reason: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[PER Angela Merkel  ] arrives in [LOC Washington  ] in an enviable position of political strength , both at home and in the [ORG EU  ] . 
However , she is conscious that her strength derives largely from the weakness of her counterparts and other factors beyond her control . 
Achieving her goals for the [ORG EU  ] - in the trans-Atlantic context these are focused on climate change and the [ORG Transatlantic Economic Initiative  ] - will reinforce her position at home and in the [ORG EU  ] , and serve as a springboard to success on the larger [MISC G-8  ] stage . 
A success for [PER Merkel  ] is also a success for the [LOC U.S.  ] Even after the [MISC German  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency , we will want the Atlanticist [PER Merkel  ] to remain a dominant force within the [ORG EU  ] . 
In [LOC Berlin  ] , a successful summit will strengthen her and other trans-Atlanticists against those who favor a policy of vocal , public antagonism . 
End Summary . 
Leading in the [ORG EU  ] ; Muddling Through at Home ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Angela Merkel  ] 's role as [LOC Germany  ] 's and [LOC Europe  ] 's leader is undisputed . 
No other leader of a large member state is politically fit enough to offer himself up as a leader . 
Her leadership of the [MISC G-8  ] and [LOC Germany  ] 's intrinsic weight and economic recovery are further boosts . 
At home , [PER Merkel  ] is not only riding high in opinion polls ( 70 percent popularity rating ) and enjoying the benefits of leadership at a time of long-sought economic growth , but has also wrong-footed her coalition partner [MISC Social Democrats  ] with reformist domestic social policies . 
However , in both cases her apparent strength is not entirely of her own making , but derives in large part from her office , the weakness of her counterparts , or from other factors beyond her control . 
She took the helm of the [ORG EU  ] at a time when progress on the [MISC European  ] project had largely come to a halt , when [MISC European  ] institutions were unsure of how or in which direction to move , and ( as noted ) no alternative leaders were present . 
In [LOC Berlin  ] , her coalition partner and rival , the [MISC Social Democrats  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) , are dealing with weak leadership , a vacuum of ideas , and a challenge from the left. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Merkel  ] has responded to these similar circumstances with quite different tactics . 
In the [ORG EU  ] , she has asserted [MISC German  ] and her personal leadership over the [ORG Council Secretariat  ] , especially with respect to her goal of SIPDIS developing a road map for furthering the [ORG EU  ] constitution . 
She has sidelined [LOC Brussels  ] by putting her own representatives on the road to discuss the constitution in other capitals and has weighed in personally as needed to find compromises that keep the constitutional project moving forward . 
Likewise , she has vigorously pursued the [ORG Transatlantic Economic Initiative  ] within the [ORG EU  ] to remove regulatory barriers , and has pushed for agreement on the new [ORG EU  ] climate change and energy initiatives . 
She has not succeeded in all her undertakings -- prospects for a new [ORG EU  ] Partnership and [ORG Cooperation Agreement  ] with [LOC Russia  ] remain distant , for example . 
Still , the view that we hear from [LOC Brussels  ] is of vigorous and effective leadership . 
In [LOC Berlin  ] , [PER Merkel  ] is known for her reticence to engage in aggressive politics , preferring to stay in the background until the " correlation of forces " is clear and then engaging to nudge the debate in her preferred direction . 
Though the [ORG SPD  ] is weak , [PER Merkel  ] has been reluctant to push it hard . 
Her strategy appears to be aimed at building and consolidating her own and her party 's dominance with a view toward a clear victory in 2009 elections , rather than attempting to score victories now that could alienate significant voter groups . 
Washington: What 's In It for [PER Merkel  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We sum up [PER Merkel  ] 's goal for the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] [ORG Summit  ] as being to achieve substantive progress in the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] relationship for its own sake and to build a lasting foundation for her leadership in the [ORG EU  ] and in [LOC Germany  ] . 
The substantive agenda is clear and we need not explore it in detail here . 
It is focused on our political cooperation in key areas - climate change and energy security as well as the [ORG Transatlantic Economic Initiative  ] . 
We recognize that in these and other areas , [MISC European  ] goals are not exactly aligned with our own . 
Nonetheless , success in these areas , the former a key concern of [MISC European  ] publics and the latter important to sustaining [MISC European  ] growth , after a long period in which trans-Atlantic relations were dominated by negative headlines and exchanges focused on other regions , would prove [PER Merkel  ] 's particular competence at succeeding in [LOC Europe  ] 's key external relationship . 
After success in [LOC Washington  ] , [ORG Merkel BERLIN  ] 00000802 002 OF 002 can count on maintaining her position in [LOC Europe  ] against any incoming [MISC French  ] President and [ORG UK Prime Minister-in-waiting Brown  ] . 
Success in [LOC Washington  ] will also strengthen her hand in the follow-on summits with [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , and [LOC Japan  ] and sets the stage for success in [MISC G-8  ] summit deliberations on climate change. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) At home , a [ORG Summit  ] success may enable [PER Merkel  ] to end the [ORG SPD  ] 's ability to use loud , public " principled " criticism of the [LOC U.S.  ] as a winning tactic . 
[PER Gerhard Schroeder  ] won the 2002 election with his public attacks on [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Iraq  ] policy , but if [PER Merkel  ] brings home meaningful agreements -- especially on issues with domestic resonance such as climate change and trans-Atlantic economic cooperation -- she will have shown the [MISC German  ] public that her policy of constructive engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] brings real benefits on issues of concern to it . 
Foreign policy , especially trans-Atlantic relations , is one of the few areas where the [ORG SPD  ] still enjoys greater public support than does the [LOC CDU/CSU  ] . 
Success in [LOC Washington  ] may undercut the [ORG SPD  ] on that theme , as the [LOC CDU/CSU  ] has already undercut it on many domestic social themes . 
A Note on Style --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Merkel  ] is pushing for a [ORG Summit  ] that is more than a predictable set-piece , quickly forgotten . 
She looks for real decisions to be made during the [ORG Summit  ] discussions . 
This does more than just ensure that she has something important to do . 
It emphasizes her personal commitment to restoring [MISC European-American  ] relations and her belief in face-to-face engagement . 
We recognize the difficulty of organizing discussions in this format , but believe we too stand to gain by such an approach . 
What 's In This for [LOC Washington  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Post has previously reported on [PER Merkel  ] 's risk-averse approach to foreign policy . 
We do not expect her to change her leadership style because of success in [LOC Washington  ] . 
The real benefits for the [LOC U.S.  ] lie in how success will affect the public understanding of how [LOC Germany  ] can best build a relationship with [LOC Washington  ] and its view of the [LOC U.S.  ] , the changing of which is a frequent theme in conversations with [MISC German  ] leaders and thinkers . 
A successful [ORG Summit  ] will also reinforce our message that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] are natural partners , closely bound by common interests . 
As a cautious conservative in a difficult coalition , [PER Merkel  ] will not run great risks for the [LOC U.S.  ] But , if she can show the public that cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] works , the effect will be to cut the risk she runs by cooperating with the [LOC U.S.  ] It is a more complex path to a closer and more effective relationship than we would perhaps like , but our observation of [PER Merkel  ] and our conversations with her advisors lead us to see it as the best path available .
