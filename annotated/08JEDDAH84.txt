Gfoeller  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) an d ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) BEGIN SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Since the [ORG OIC  ] 's 2004 election of [PER Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu  ] as Secretary General , one of his top priorities has been to combat misperceptions of [MISC Islam  ] . 
Unsurprisingly , he issued a strong statement condemning the February 13 re-publishing of caricatures from the 2006 [MISC Mohammad  ] cartoon crisis ( Reftels A and C ) . 
[PER Ihsanoglu  ] deemed the [MISC Danish  ] media decision to publish the cartoons " " irresponsible " " and " " insensible , " " arguing that the cartoons " " constituted an advocacy of hatred . 
" " He further warned of " " bigger conflict " " over the cartoons and called on [MISC Muslims  ] to protest peacefully . 
Of comparable offense , [ORG OIC  ] officials argued recently to Pol Chief , is the upcoming release of a [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MP  ] 's film on [MISC Islam  ] ( Reftel B ) . 
Given the [ORG OIC  ] 's focus on " " [PER Islamophobia  ] " " and recent protest of the caricatures , the film will undoubtedly roil the [ORG OIC  ] , prompting [PER Ihsanoglu  ] to issue equally strong remarks . 
Conversations with Post contacts and letters to [MISC Saudi  ] English-language dailies have presented a myriad of [MISC Saudi  ] opinions , from defense of [ORG Freedom of Speech  ] to outright anger toward the [MISC Danish  ] media . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT . 
[ORG OIC  ] CAMPAIGNS AGAINST " " [PER ISLAMOPHOBIA  ] " " <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In speeches around the World , [ORG Organization of the Islamic Conference  ] Secretary General [PER Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu  ] and other [ORG OIC  ] officials have been campaigning against " " [PER Islamophobia  ] ; " " a term [PER Ihsanoglu  ] has described as " " intolerance of and discrimination against [MISC Muslims  ] . 
" " [PER Ihsanoglu  ] believes that post-9/11 the [MISC Western  ] media has contributed to a rise in " " misrepresentations and stereotyping of [MISC Islam  ] . 
" " He argues that actions such as the publishing of the 2006 [MISC Mohammad  ] cartoons are " " islamophobic " " and do nothing more than foster hostility toward [MISC Muslims  ] . 
[ORG OIC  ] SYG WARNS OF BIGGER CONFLICT ; CALLS FOR PEACEFUL PROTEST <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Ihsanoglu  ] stated on February 16 that the [MISC Danish  ] media decision to re-publish the caricatures was " " irresponsible " " and " " insensible , " " and " " constituted an advocacy of hatred . 
" " He warned that by reprinting the cartoons , " " we are headed toward a bigger conflict and that shows that both sides will be hostages of their radicals . 
" " Condemning the use of violence , he called on [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Denmark  ] to protest " " peacefully and democratically . 
" " He added that the " " [MISC Muslim  ] world was waiting for an unequivocal stand " " from the [MISC Danish  ] government under the 1996 [ORG United Nations International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights  ] . 
[ORG OIC  ] CONCERNED ABOUT [MISC DUTCH  ] FILM ON [MISC ISLAM  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Citing the epidemic nature of " " [PER Islamophobia  ] , " " [ORG OIC  ] officials raised with Pol Chief their concern over [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MP  ] [PER Geert Wilder  ] 's soon-to-be released , 15-minute film on [MISC Islam  ] ( Reftel B ) . 
( NOTE: In a February 10 interview , [PER Wilders  ] said the film would be released in March . 
END NOTE . 
) They compared it to the 2006 [MISC Danish  ] cartoons scandal and stated that such actions did nothing but slander [MISC Islam  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] . 
( COMMENT: In previous meetings , Post has asked [ORG OIC  ] officials how such a claim does not infringe [ORG Freedom of Speech  ] . 
Their response is typically ambiguous , stating that they support [ORG Freedom of Speech  ] provided that people exercise that right with respect for other cultures . 
END COMMENT ) . 
They also expressed concern over a perceived increase in the negative perception of [MISC Islam  ] in the [LOC West  ] . 
They added that they believed the solution was for dialogue across civilizations . 
[MISC SAUDI  ] OPINION RUNS THE GAMUT <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Conversations with Post contacts and letters published in [MISC Saudi  ] English-language dailies over the past few days have presented an array of [MISC Saudi  ] opinions regarding the re-publishing of the cartoons . 
A few liberal , U.S.-educated Jeddawis believe that creating such caricatures is within the purview of [ORG Freedom of Speech  ] . 
More moderate individuals , such as some of Post 's [ORG OIC  ] contacts , argue that [ORG Freedom of Speech  ] should not include the right to propagate negative opinions about other cultures . 
Others have deemed such JEDDAH 00000084 002.2 OF 002 cartoons " " an insult to [MISC Islam  ] , " " and consider their re-publishing a blatant attack on [MISC Muslims  ] worldwide .
