LeBaron  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani  ] ( who serves concurrently as Foreign Minister ) of [LOC Qatar  ] will visit [LOC Washington  ] beginning January 4 to continue the strategic consultations that [LOC Qatar  ] and the [ORG USG  ] have pursued since June , when [MISC Near Eastern Affairs Assistant Secretary  ] [PER Feltman  ] first proposed them in [LOC Doha  ] . 
As part of those consultations , Minister of State for Foreign Affairs [PER Ahmed Al-Mahmoud  ] and Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs [PER Mohamad Al-Rumaihi  ] visited [LOC Washington  ] last fall. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Prime Minister travels to [LOC Washington  ] with the aim of laying the groundwork for visits in the first half of 2010 by [LOC Qatar  ] 's [ORG Heir Apparent  ] and the [ORG Amir  ] . 
We believe he will be prepared to discuss the gaps between the [ORG USG  ] and GOQ on [LOC Middle East  ] peace and counterterrorism cooperation , as well as to discuss setting the stage for joint cooperation on [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and other regional issues. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Suggested talking points for meetings with the [LOC PM:  ] -- We thank you for bringing with you to [LOC Washington  ] a commitment to fund the [ORG PA  ] . 
Your decision to do so is extremely important to us . 
We view it as a clear gesture of friendship to us and of a commitment to partner with us on [MISC Fatah-Hamas  ] reconciliation , just as the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] have partnered on [LOC Darfur  ] . 
-- As your ally and friend , we hope we can look to you to increase your cooperation with us on counterterrorism . 
We want to work particularly closely with you and enacting policies and programs that deter financial flows to [ORG Hamas  ] and the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
-- In this context , we applaud your work with the [ORG IMF  ] on making needed legal and procedural changes to curtail financing to terrorists . 
We are ready to help you with technical support and training once the [ORG IMF  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] have worked out an action plan . 
-- We especially value consultations with you on [LOC Iran  ] . 
We recognize your national need for a working relationship with [LOC Iran  ] , given the natural gas reserves you share with [LOC Iran  ] . 
How best do you think we can persuade [LOC Iran  ] to give up its military nuclear aims without military confrontation ? 
-- We understand that you are close to announcing a decision to open an Embassy in [LOC Baghdad  ] , but that much depends on resolving the issue of [LOC Iraq  ] 's debts to [LOC Qatar  ] . 
Is there anything we can do to help ? 
-- We encourage you to recognize an independent [LOC Kosovo  ] , as [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and others have now done . 
We certainly appreciate your votes in favor of [LOC Kosovo  ] in the [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] . 
They are important precursors to formal recognition , but when will you take that final step ? 
-- On [LOC Yemen  ] , we know that President [PER Saleh  ] asked [LOC Qatar  ] to stop its mediation between the central government and [MISC Huthi  ] rebels . 
Given your past involvement there , what thoughts do you have on bringing about stability on the [ORG Arabian Peninsula  ] ? 
-- We applaud [LOC Qatar  ] 's decision to make food security a priority , not just for itself but for the entire [MISC Arab  ] world . 
Food security is a priority for the [ORG USG  ] , as well , and we share [LOC Qatar  ] 's view that it must be addressed through a combination of commerce , investment , technical assistance , technology transfer , and direct aid . 
Addressing the [ORG Fatah-Hamas Split and Funding  ] the [ORG PA  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Hamad  ] bin [PER Jassim  ] ( [ORG HBJ  ] ) has told [ORG NEA A/S  ] [PER Feltman  ] that he will come with a financial commitment to fund the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] . 
This is an extremely important gesture by [LOC Qatar  ] to the [LOC United States  ] . 
He will also be prepared to discuss with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and others [LOC Qatar  ] 's view of [ORG Hamas  ] , continued contacts with whose leaders it sees as key to bringing about a stable and enduring [LOC Middle East  ] peace . 
We expect [ORG HBJ  ] to share what other steps [LOC Qatar  ] is prepared to take in support of the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) and , in particular , [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] , whose continued leadership [ORG DOHA  ] 00000733 002.2 OF 003 of the [ORG PA Qatar  ] 's leaders support . 
[ORG HBJ  ] is likely to bring with him new ideas to reconcile [ORG Hamas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] . 
Given [LOC Qatar  ] 's history of mediation efforts [ORG HBJ  ] will no doubt suggest that [LOC Qatar  ] can play a helpful role . 
[LOC Qatar  ] 's restoration of normal operations of the [ORG Israeli Trade Office  ] in [LOC Doha  ] would also give testimony to [LOC Qatar  ] 's willingness to help achieve [LOC U.S.  ] objectives , but we do not expect the Qataris to take this step absent some significant gesture from the [MISC Israelis  ] , such as much less restricted access to [LOC Gaza  ] for [LOC Qatar  ] 's humanitarian efforts. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Qatar  ] almost certainly will not be willing to break off ties or dialogue with [ORG Hamas  ] . 
If asked to do so , we think [ORG HBJ  ] will explain that the [ORG Amir  ] gave his word to both [ORG Hamas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] that he would financially support the winner of democratic elections in [LOC Palestine  ] . 
[ORG Hamas  ] won those elections , which the [ORG Bush Administration  ] pressed the [ORG Amir  ] to support actively . 
The [ORG Amir  ] believes that it would be dishonorable to isolate [ORG Hamas  ] after he convinced its leaders to participate in elections that were backed by the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG Greater Cooperation on Counterterrorism Needed  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) It is important to make clear to [ORG HBJ  ] that cooperation between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] on counterterrorism issues in general needs to be greatly improved . 
Officials should make known [ORG USG  ] concerns about the financial support to [ORG Hamas  ] by [MISC Qatari  ] charitable organizations and our concerns about the moral support [ORG Hamas  ] receives from [PER Yousef Al-Qaradawi  ] . 
It is also essential to stress that high-level [MISC Qatari  ] political support is needed , if financial flows to terrorists are to stop. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) An [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] ( [ORG IMF  ] ) employee began advising [LOC Qatar  ] 's Financial Intelligence Unit in October ( in a relationship expected to last three full years ) on making the necessary legal and procedural changes to address the 49 areas in which international experts have recommended changes to [LOC Qatar  ] 's procedures . 
We assess that the FIU is serious about making technical changes that will enhance [LOC Qatar  ] 's reputation as a global financial center , but we project that , absent political support from the top , the [MISC IMF/Qatari  ] partnership will fall short in achieving its goals . 
Need for [LOC Close Consultations  ] on [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Qatar  ] shares a mammoth natural gas field with [LOC Iran  ] . 
As a result , [LOC Qatar  ] carefully maintains with [LOC Iran  ] a high tempo of top-level contacts , which have increased since the protests following [MISC Iranian  ] presidential elections ) . 
[LOC Qatar  ] does this because it is convinced that such a close relationship with [LOC Iran  ] is key to safeguarding trillions of dollars in potential wealth . 
We are convinced that [LOC Qatar  ] will not be dissuaded from maintaining those ties. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) That said , [LOC Qatar  ] 's leaders -- while careful not to say it publicly -- do not trust [LOC Iran  ] ; and [LOC Qatar  ] does not want [LOC Iran  ] to have nuclear weapons. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Qatar  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] is important to us for another reason . 
[LOC Qatar  ] hosts the forward headquarters of [LOC CENTCOM  ] and allows us to use [MISC Al-Udaid Air Base  ] for unrestricted air operations over [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We pay no rent for these facilities , and the Qataris have funded about 60 percent of the improvements to [MISC Al-Udaid  ] since our partnership on that base began . 
While few , least of all [LOC Qatar  ] , want a military confrontation with [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG USG  ] no doubt would want to use these [MISC Qatari  ] facilities in any kinetic operations against [LOC Iran  ] . 
Right now , we anticipate that [LOC Qatar  ] would refuse to allow [MISC Qatari  ] soil to be used to attack [LOC Iran  ] , short of some sort of permanent [ORG USG  ] security guarantee to [LOC Qatar  ] , to include its offshore natural gas field shared with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Finding a [MISC Way Forward  ] on [LOC Iraq  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) For several months , [LOC Qatar  ] has expressed frustration with the current government of [LOC Iraq  ] , which it views as too [PER Shi'a  ] in orientation for its liking , but appears now to be prepared to consider investment offsets , provided by the Government of [LOC Iraq  ] , but owned by [LOC Qatar  ] , as a means for [LOC Iraq  ] [ORG DOHA  ] 00000733 003.2 OF 003 to repay the [ORG GOI  ] 's debt owed [LOC Qatar  ] . 
That would be an avenue for the resumption of a political relationship , to include an [ORG HBJ  ] visit to [LOC Baghdad  ] and the opening of a [MISC Qatari  ] Embassy in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
We should encourage [LOC Qatar  ] 's outreach to [LOC Baghdad  ] and also encourage [LOC Iraq  ] 's government to shore up its relations with [LOC Doha  ] . 
Recognizing [LOC Kosovo  ] ------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) MFA Assistant Minister [PER Mohamad Al-Rumaihi  ] told Ambassador December 20 that [LOC Qatar  ] 's [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] votes in favor of [LOC Kosovo  ] show [LOC Qatar  ] 's true sympathies on recognizing [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The [MISC Russian  ] President , however , has asked [LOC Qatar  ] to " go slow " in announcing recognition , he said . 
Out of sensitivity to [MISC Russian  ] concerns , [PER Al-Rumaihi  ] said , [LOC Qatar  ] has done so . 
He encouraged Secretary [PER Clinton  ] to ask [ORG HBJ  ] about the timing of [LOC Qatar  ] 's eventual recognition , noting that that [LOC Qatar  ] had been approached by organizers of a [LOC UK  ] project about using its good offices with the Government of [LOC Kosovo  ] to protect [LOC Kosovo  ] 's [MISC Christian  ] heritage once [LOC Qatar  ] formally recognizes its independence . 
Cool to [LOC Yemen  ] 's Approach on the [MISC Huthi  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Having attempted to mediate between [MISC Huthi  ] rebels in [LOC Yemen  ] and the central government there ( before President [PER Saleh  ] put an end to [LOC Qatar  ] 's involvement ) , [LOC Qatar  ] believes the [MISC Huthi  ] tribes have legitimate grievances that the central government must address in dialogue and negotiations . 
It can be expected that [ORG HBJ  ] will discourage a military approach to solving the [MISC Huthi  ] problem and claim that the role of [MISC Huthi  ] elements in supporting terrorism in the guise of [ORG Al-Qaida  ] is overstated . 
Food Security ------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) [LOC Qatar  ] will host March 3-4 , 2010 an international conference focused on food security in the [MISC Arab World  ] . 
IFAD ( [ORG International Fund for Agricultural Development  ] ) is a co-host , as is the [ORG Islamic Development Bank  ] . 
The conference will have a set of ambitious goals , to include a conference declaration establishing a permanent secretariat to address the food security issues of the poorer states of the [ORG Arab League  ] . 
According to officials of [ORG Texas A&M  ] 's [ORG Borlaug Institute  ] , this will be the first such conference on regional food security issues hosted by an [MISC Arab  ] government in the 50 years the institute has been active in the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In Embassy [LOC Doha  ] 's judgment , [LOC Qatar  ] 's food security policies and strategies reflect the rapidly growing intent by the [ORG Amir  ] and Crown Prince to make food security a key national priority for [LOC Qatar  ] , not just in terms of [LOC Qatar  ] 's own food security needs , but in terms of the food security needs of the [MISC Arab  ] region . 
( [ORG HBJ  ] supports having an active food security policy , as long as it has a strong commercial focus . 
) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) That judgment stems from our conversations with [LOC Qatar  ] government officials: -- While [ORG QNFSP  ] 's short-term focus is on the State of [LOC Qatar  ] and building the domestic agricultural sector to diminish reliance on imports , the strategic goal of [ORG QNFSP  ] is to export the technologies developed in [LOC Qatar  ] to countries throughout the [ORG MENA  ] region , and other areas with arid climates . 
-- Toward that end , some research results will be part of the public domain and available to everyone . 
Some technology transfer to poorer [LOC MENA  ] nations will be donor-based , through the activities of the offices of the State Minister for [ORG International Cooperation  ] . 
The third component of [LOC Qatar  ] 's strategic goal of exporting [ORG QNFSP  ] technology will be more commercially based , and will employ public/private partnerships .
