End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] convoked the Ambassador on May 2 for their first meeting since [PER Kusa  ] was appointed Secretary for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] in March ( Foreign Minister-equivalent ) . 
Ambassador was accompanied by DCM ; [ORG MFA Americas Desk  ] Director [PER Mohamed Matari  ] and a notetaker were also present . 
[PER Kusa  ] began by noting the positive direction of [MISC US-Libyan  ] relations and saying that the [ORG GOL  ] wanted to develop the bilateral relationship further through high-level visits , including by congressional delegations . 
Such visits would help introduce key [MISC Americans  ] to [LOC Libya  ] and were essential , as [LOC Libya  ] lacked an effective lobby in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG Sudan-Chad Reconciliation Key  ] to Solving [ORG Darfur  ] 3 . 
( C ) Turning to specific areas of potential cooperation , [PER Kusa  ] , who had recently returned from [MISC Darfur-related  ] meetings in [LOC Doha  ] , outlined [MISC Libyan  ] policy with respect to [ORG Darfur  ] . 
In the [ORG GOL  ] 's view , achieving reconciliation between [LOC Sudan  ] and [LOC Chad  ] was the key to solving the [ORG Darfur  ] conflict . 
[LOC Libya  ] was working closely with the Qataris on this . 
[PER Kusa  ] said he had had good meetings in [LOC Doha  ] with [LOC SE Gration  ] , and supported the [LOC US  ] efforts to achieve a [ORG Darfur  ] ceasefire , although this would be difficult to achieve without " calming " tensions between [LOC Sudan  ] and [LOC Chad  ] . 
Those two governments continued to level accusations against each other , and it was difficult for outsiders to judge their accuracy . 
In the [ORG GOL  ] 's view , further agreements between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] were of no use ; the focus should be on establishing a third-party border monitoring mechanism , similar to the one that [LOC Libya  ] had previously participated in . 
Neutral third-party monitors would be in a position to judge , for example , whether [ORG JEM  ] 's [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] was receiving weapons from [LOC Chad  ] . 
( [PER Kusa  ] said he had met with a number of [ORG Darfur  ] faction leaders while in [LOC Doha  ] , but only [ORG JEM  ] 's [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] had strength and influence , thanks to [PER Ibrahim  ] 's tribal , political and personal connections in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
) [PER Kusa  ] said that [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] personally supported the border monitoring initiative and that he , [PER Kusa  ] , had requested [LOC US  ] support through [LOC SE Gration  ] . 
Asked by the Ambassador what type of support [LOC Libya  ] sought , [PER Kusa  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] sought [LOC US  ] partnership in this effort , and would convey more specific requests later . 
[ORG Al-Qaeda Expanding in Africa  ] 4 . 
( C ) Another priority issue for [MISC US-Libyan  ] engagement , [PER Kusa  ] said , was combating [ORG al-Qaeda  ] in the [LOC Saharan  ] and [LOC Maghreb  ] regions . 
While the [LOC US  ] focused on the [MISC Taliban  ] , [ORG al-Qaeda  ] was expanding its influence in the [LOC Saharan  ] belt and north [LOC Africa  ] . 
There had been 8 kidnappings in the past six months , including the two [MISC Canadian  ] officials who were recently released in return for a ransom payment . 
Such payments were unfortunate and only increased the strength of al-Qaeda , he said . 
While many governments talked about cooperating with [LOC Libya  ] in combating terrorists in the region , only the [LOC US  ] was seriously engaged . 
He said he hoped bilateral cooperation would increase , to which the Ambassador responded urging the [ORG GOL  ] to participate in the [ORG Trans-Sahara Counter-terrorism Initiative  ] , noting that it would increase opportunities for [MISC Libyan  ] engagement with the [LOC United States  ] in this area . 
It would also be useful for the [ORG GOL  ] to invite General [PER Ward  ] , head of the [ORG US Africa Command  ] , to return to [LOC Libya  ] for a visit ( that invitation has now been conveyed ) . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] and POTUS in [LOC Italy  ] ? 5 . 
( C ) The [LOC US  ] and [LOC Libya  ] should also confer on the policies of " other governments " that are trying to " influence events on the [ [MISC African  ] ] continent , " [PER Kusa  ] continued ( in a possible reference to [LOC China  ] ) . 
The upcoming [MISC G-8  ] summit in [LOC Italy  ] would be an appropriate venue for " high-level discussions " between [LOC Libya  ] and the [LOC US  ] on these subjects . 
[PER Kusa  ] said he was personally committed to improving relations between our two governments . 
Noting the importance in [MISC Libyan  ] culture of personal relationships to building trust , [PER Kusa  ] said he hoped the [ORG State Department  ] could [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000362 002.2 OF 002 arrange a meeting between [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and President [PER Obama  ] at the summit . 
The Ambassador said the [LOC US  ] was committed to improving the relationship , as [ORG Libyan National Security  ] Adviser [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi had heard from several senior [ORG USG  ] officials during his recent visit in [LOC Washington  ] , and that he would convey the request to [LOC Washington  ] . 
As a concrete symbol of [MISC Libyan  ] commitment to the relationship , the Ambassador urged [PER Kusa  ] to support the [LOC US  ] proposal to purchase land to build a new Embassy , reminding him that the Secretary had personally made this request to [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi , and assuring him that the Embassy 's design would take into account the [MISC Libyan  ] environment and culture . 
[ORG Human Rights: Al-Jahmi  ] 6 . 
( C ) In a subsequent one-one-one meeting , the Ambassador pressed [PER Kusa  ] for the release of detained regime critic [PER Fathi  ] al-Jahmi , either to his home or abroad , emphasizing that the issue continued to be of great concern to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Noting al-Jahmi 's apparently deteriorating physical condition which made action all the more critical , the Ambassador said that in his view , al-Jahmi 's death in custody could lead to a setback in the bilateral relationship . 
[PER Kusa  ] said it was unfortunate that the [ORG USG  ] had publicized the issue during [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi 's visit , and that such publicity only caused the Leader to become more inflexible . 
The Ambassador told [PER Kusa  ] to focus on the fact that the [LOC White House  ] did not publicize the raising of the issue by [ORG NSA Jones  ] with [PER Mutassim  ] and that [ORG USG  ] officials , in raising the issue several times during the past several weeks in [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Washington  ] , had made every effort to keep discussions regarding al-Jahmi 's release private . 
[PER Kusa  ] said he understood the importance of the issue to the [LOC US  ] , said he would " do his best , " and suggested that al-Jahmi might be released after a meeting between the Leader and POTUS . 
The Ambassador strongly reiterated that the [ORG GOL  ] should not wait any longer to release al-Jahmi , given the precarious condition of his health . 
Comment 7 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Kusa  ] is one of the most influential figures in the regime , and has been a proponent of improved ties with the [LOC United States  ] . 
In his previous role as head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG External Intelligence Organization  ] , he was a key member of the [MISC Libyan  ] team that negotiated the restoration of diplomatic relations with the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] ( including the leadership 's decisions to renounce terrorism and relinquish [ORG WMD  ] ) , and he subsequently supported robust bilateral cooperation in combating al-Qaeda and stemming the flow of foreign fighters heading to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
In his new role as foreign minister , he apparently will continue to advocate for strengthening relations with the [LOC US  ] , focusing on areas of clear mutual interest such as [ORG Darfur  ] and al-Qaeda . 
Securing a meeting for [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi with the President is probably at the top of his list , given the importance al-Qadhafi places on such encounters . 
Interestingly , [PER Kusa  ] did not/not raise the matter of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber Abdelbassit al-Megrahi or the [ORG GOL  ] 's anticipated request that he be returned to [LOC Libya  ] under the recently-ratified [ORG Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] with the [LOC UK  ] .
