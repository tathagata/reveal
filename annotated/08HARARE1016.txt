McGee  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The CEO of a [MISC British  ] mining company described to us how high-ranking [MISC Zimbabwean  ] government officials and well-connected elites are generating millions of dollars in personal income by hiring teams of diggers to hand-extract diamonds from the [LOC Chiadzwa  ] mine in eastern [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
They are selling the undocumented diamonds to a mix of foreign buyers including [MISC Belgians  ] , [MISC Israelis  ] , [MISC Lebanese  ] , [MISC Russians  ] and [LOC South Africans  ] who smuggle them out of the country for cutting and resale elsewhere . 
Despite efforts to control the diamond site with police , the prospect of accessible diamonds lying just beneath the soil 's surface has attracted a swarm of several thousand local and foreign diggers . 
The police response has been violent , with a handful of homicides reported each week , though that number could grow as diggers arm themselves and attract police and army deserters to their ranks . 
END SUMMARY --------------------------------------- High-Ranking Officials Trading Diamonds --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On November 6 , poloff met with [PER Andrew Cranswick  ] , the CEO of [ORG African Consolidated Resources  ] ( [ORG ACR  ] ) , the publicly-traded [MISC British  ] firm that had its [LOC Chiadzwa  ] diamond claim in the [MISC Marange  ] district of [LOC Manicaland  ] seized by the government [ORG parastatal Minerals Marketing Corporation  ] of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] ( [ORG MMCZ  ] ) in 2006 ( reftel ) . 
According to [PER Cranswick  ] , there is a small group of high-ranking [MISC Zimbabwean  ] officials who have been extracting tremendous diamond profits from [LOC Chiadzwa  ] . 
[PER Cranswick  ] said that RBZ Governor [PER Gideon Gono  ] , [PER Grace Mugabe  ] , wife of President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] , Vice President [PER Joyce Mujuru  ] , [ORG Mines and Mining Development  ] Minister [PER Amos Midzi  ] , General [PER Constantine Chiwenga  ] and wife [PER Jocelyn  ] , CIO Director [PER Happyton Bonyongwe  ] , [LOC Manicaland  ] Governor [PER Chris Mushowe  ] , and several white [PER Zimbabweans  ] , including [PER Ken Sharpe  ] , [PER Greg Scott  ] , and [PER Hendrik O  ] , [PER Neill  ] , are all involved in the [MISC Marange  ] diamond trade. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On October 14 , econ specialist traveled to the periphery of the no-go area around the [LOC Chiadzwa  ] diamond site located about 60 km southwest of [LOC Mutare  ] in [LOC Manicaland  ] . 
Repeated inquiries about who was involved in the diamond trade elicited many of the same names mentioned by [PER Cranswick.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Econ specialist also met with [PER Manatsawani Mutasa  ] , a [ORG ZANU-PF Central Committee  ] member and [LOC Manicaland  ] resident , who added that Justice Minister [PER Patrick Chinamasa  ] , Women 's Affairs Minister [PER Oppah Muchinguri  ] , and [PER Sabina Mugabe--sister  ] of President Mugabe--have also been profiting from the purchase and sale of [LOC Chiadzwa  ] diamonds. ------------------------------------ How the [ORG Chiadzwa Diamond Trade Works  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOZ  ] possesses the diamond mining rights to [LOC Chiadzwa  ] , but the [ORG Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation  ] ( [ORG ZMDC  ] ) does not do any extraction itself . 
The [ORG ZMDC  ] brought in some mining equipment in 2006 after seizing the mining rights from [ORG ACR  ] , but their efforts were minimal and soon halted altogether . 
According to [LOC Cranswick  ] , all extraction is now being done by hand panners who merely sift the top meter of soil . 
Some of these panners operate in teams that sell [LOC HARARE  ] 00001016 002 OF 005 their diamonds to representatives of the above-named officials and connected elites . 
Other panners are individual operators who merely sell to the highest bidder . 
Often the panners who are affiliated with a particular regime buyer , will only sell a portion of their diamonds to that person 's representative , holding back the remainder to sell for higher prices to foreign buyers offering hard currency. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The diamonds that are sold to regime members and elites are sold for freshly printed [MISC Zimbabwean  ] notes issued by the RBZ . 
These diamonds are aggregated and resold to foreign buyers for [LOC US  ] dollars or rand in nearby [LOC Mutare  ] , in [LOC Harare  ] , over the border in the [MISC Mozambican  ] towns of [LOC Manica  ] and [LOC Chimoio  ] , or even in [LOC South Africa  ] . 
( NOTE: Econ specialist reported that [LOC Mutare  ] was awash with diamond money . 
The [ORG Holiday Inn  ] was booked with guests checking in for weeks at a time . 
Food prices in shops near [MISC Marange  ] were exorbitant , with meat prices four times higher than in [LOC Harare  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The diamonds that are not sold to regime members and elites , but instead are sold directly to foreign buyers , actually constitute the majority of the diamond trade in [LOC Chiadzwa  ] . 
[LOC Cranswick  ] said that around 85 percent of the diamonds extracted from [LOC Chiadzwa  ] are sold directly to foreign buyers . 
Even so , he conservatively estimated that [PER Mujuru  ] , [PER Gono  ] and the rest were probably each making several hundred thousand dollars a month. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Whether bought first by regime members or not , eventually the diamonds are sold to a mix of [MISC Belgians  ] , [MISC Israelis  ] , [MISC Lebanese  ] ( the largest contingent ) , [MISC Russians  ] , and [LOC South Africans  ] . 
A well-known buyer named [PER Gonyeti  ] fronts for [PER Gono  ] , as do two other buyers named [PER Tendai Makurumidze  ] and [PER Takunda Nyaguze  ] , according to [PER Mutasa  ] . 
Once sold to foreigners , the majority of the diamonds are smuggled to [LOC Dubai  ] and sold at the [ORG Dubai Multi Commodities Centre Authority  ] , a dedicated economic free-trade zone created in 2002 for the exchange of metals and commodities , most notably gold and diamonds . 
Although [LOC Zimbabwe  ] is a participant in the [LOC Kimberley  ] process , the diamonds from [LOC Chiadzwa  ] are undocumented and therefore are not in compliance with [LOC Kimberley  ] , which requires loose uncut diamonds to be certified. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The highest quality diamonds are not sent to [LOC Dubai  ] , but are shipped to [LOC Belgium  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , or [LOC South Africa  ] for cutting . 
Despite this wide dispersal , [LOC Chiadzwa  ] diamonds are very distinctive because of their age , color , and clarity and can easily be traced back to the [MISC Marange  ] mine , according to [LOC Cranswick  ] . 
He implicated [PER Ernie Blom  ] , president of [LOC South Africa  ] 's [ORG Diamond Merchants Association  ] in the illicit trade of [LOC Chiadzwa  ] diamonds , and said that [PER Blom  ] had been known to boast of his involvement in illegal [MISC Zimbabwean  ] diamonds . 
When asked why purportedly reputable diamond dealers would involve themselves in [LOC Chiadzwa  ] , [LOC Cranswick  ] said that the site was " massive " with tremendous profit potential that was attracting numerous buyers . 
One such group consisted of [MISC Russians  ] who had recently bought [MISC US$500,000  ] worth of diamonds at an [ORG MMCZ  ] auction , paying [MISC US$29/carat  ] . 
They bought eight to ten carat rough diamonds , five to ten percent of which were gem quality. -------------------------------- [ORG Diamond Trade a Violent Business  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The diamond frenzy in [LOC Chiadzwa  ] has led to hundreds and possibly thousands of homicides . 
Word of easy diamonds spurred a rush of [MISC Zimbabwean  ] and foreign diggers to the area including [MISC Angolans  ] , [MISC Congolese  ] , [MISC Mozambicans  ] , [LOC South Africans  ] and [MISC Zambians  ] , as well as diggers from as far away as [ORG Sierra HARARE  ] 00001016 003 OF 005 [MISC Leone  ] and [LOC Cote D'Ivoire Cranswick  ] estimated there are currently around three or four thousand diggers swarming over the 70 hectare [LOC Chiadzwa  ] site . 
The police have unsuccessfully tried to prevent the site from becoming overrun , and routinely use live fire to chase away diggers . 
Anyone trying to enter the area has to present a [MISC Zimbabwean  ] national identification card with a registration number that ends in " 75 " , signifying the person is a resident of the [LOC Mutare  ] region of [LOC Manicaland.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) During the first weekend of November , police killed at least five panners in [LOC Chiadzwa  ] , according to the on-line newspaper [ORG Zimbabwe Times  ] . 
While usually operating on foot with attack dogs , this time the police used a helicopter to shoot at panners . 
[PER Passmore Nyakureba  ] , a lawyer with the [ORG Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights  ] said , " This has become an everyday scenario . 
Up to five people die every week as a result of being shot at by police or after being bitten by dogs . 
" [LOC Cranswick  ] said that at the peak of the frenzy in 2007 , up to a hundred panners were shot in a week. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In response to aggressive police action , diggers began arming themselves with handguns and in some cases automatic weapons . 
They also formed loose gangs in an attempt to protect themselves as well as " claimed " areas . 
[LOC Cranswick  ] said that some members of the police and army have deserted in order to join the digging , and they typically brought their firearms with them . 
Some former police even still wear their uniforms as they search for diamonds. ------------------------------------- Police Corrupted ; Community Destroyed ------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Cranswick  ] said that the police were rotated into the area on two-week shifts to control the mining and keep unauthorized diggers out , but they were immediately corrupted . 
Police officers routinely charged 100 rand or [MISC US$10  ] a person for a day 's digging in [LOC Chiadzwa  ] . 
The military has largely avoided the area out of fear that commanding officers would lose control of their troops , according to [LOC Cranswick.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [LOC Cranswick  ] maintained that local chiefs were on [ORG ACR  ] 's side in its pending court battle to win back its claim . 
They realized that the " curse " of diamonds had wreaked havoc in the community . 
Children were no longer attending school , the environmental degradation was severe , lawlessness and violence reigned , and the community was not benefiting from the resource . 
According to an independent weekly newspaper , three quarters of the schools in [LOC Marange  ] , [LOC Buhera  ] , and [LOC Chimanimani  ] districts failed to open this term because teachers and students alike were digging for diamonds. ---------------- What 's At [LOC Stake  ] ? ---------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Chiadzwa  ] has the potential of being a major source of industrial and gem quality diamonds . 
What makes it so commercially valuable is that it possesses a diverse mix of different size and color stones , all within just a few meters of the surface . 
It also has a high carat per hundred tons ( CPHT ) ratio , a measure the industry uses to characterize the diamond concentration . 
[LOC Cranswick  ] told us he was confidentially shown a report prepared for the [ORG De Beers Corporation  ] by noted geologist [PER John Ward  ] . 
The report estimated that [LOC Chiadzwa  ] had a CPHT of over 1,000 . 
By comparison , the [ORG Rio Tinto/Rio Zimbabwe-owned Murowa  ] diamond mine near [LOC Zvishavane  ] in [LOC Midlands  ] province has a CPHT of 120 . 
[LOC HARARE  ] 00001016 004 OF 005 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Eye witnesses and panners told us that they were extracting both industrial and gem quality stones , but predominantly the former . 
[LOC Cranswick  ] believed that the site had 30 to 40 percent industrial diamonds and the rest gem quality , including very good quality five to 30 carat colored diamonds . 
In his view , the area could be commercially exploited for five to 25 years , including excavation of diamond yielding hard rock that ran deeper than the one meter depth currently being worked . 
Econ specialist also was told that another diamond field was discovered this year within five km of [LOC Chiadzwa  ] at the village of [LOC Chirasika  ] . 
Panners had begun working the site and it had not yet become a police-restricted area . 
We have no estimates for the potential of this new diamond discovery. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) On October 27 , [PER Gono  ] publicly declared that the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] economy could be turned around by stemming losses caused by illegal mining at [LOC Chiadzwa  ] . 
According to [PER Gono  ] , " A reliable estimate shows that [MISC US$1.2  ] billion per month would be realized from diamond sales in the country , enough to solve the economic challenges the country is currently facing . 
" [LOC Cranswick  ] said that while the estimate is probably exaggerated , [PER Gono  ] may be looking for a large one time dividend by selling a share of the mine or the mining rights to an outside investor . 
This would dwarf the relatively small profits he is now accruing from the mine. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [ORG ACR  ] has offered the government a deal in which [ORG ACR  ] would take a 49 percent share of all diamond proceeds and give the rest to the [ORG GOZ  ] , but [LOC Cranswick  ] did not seem optimistic that the government would accept the deal. ----------------------------- Two Other Major Diamond Mines ----------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Murowa  ] is a well-regulated mine operated by the [MISC British  ] multinational mining giant [ORG Rio Tinto  ] , which since 2004 has held a 78 percent share in the open-pit [ORG Murowa  ] diamond mine in [LOC Zvishavane  ] district , in southern [LOC Masvingo  ] province . 
[ORG Murowa  ] is a deep kimberlitic deposit that requires heavy machinery to extract the soil and rock. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC River Ranch  ] is partially owned by retired General [PER Solomon Mujuru  ] ( husband of Vice President [PER Joyce Mujuru  ] ) and is located in [LOC Beitbridge  ] in [LOC Matabeleland South  ] . 
[PER Mujuru  ] gained a 20 percent stake in the mine at the expense of a local company , [ORG Bubye Minerals  ] , which was pushed out to [PER Mujuru  ] 's benefit . 
[ORG Bubye Minerals  ] contested the ownership change , but was thwarted by the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] courts . 
It is unclear if [PER Mujuru  ] purchased his stake. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) In a country filled with corrupt schemes , the diamond business in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] is one of the dirtiest . 
Mining in general remains the largest single source of foreign exchange , but the potential of [LOC Chiadzwa  ] is being lost to [MISC Zimbabwean  ] corruption . 
While [PER Gono  ] talks about using diamonds to stabilize the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] economy , he would only do so if he thought he could personally make more in the process . 
At present , police trying to bring order to [LOC Chiadzwa  ] are benefiting [MISC Zimbabwean  ] officials who see the diamond field as a new source of illegitimate income ; the people of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] are seeing little return. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) It is also clear that [LOC Cranswick  ] is a businessman trying to find any pressure point he can through which to leverage his own claim . 
At the same time , he sheds light on [LOC HARARE  ] 00001016 005 OF 005 an industry that is enriching many of the same old corrupt [MISC Zimbabwean  ] elite--and causing violence and deaths that so far have received little attention .
