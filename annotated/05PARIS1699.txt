KUJAWINSKI-FRANCE DESK 3/11 E-MAIL Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR [PER JOSIAH ROSENBLATT  ] , FOR REAS ONS 1.4 B/D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary and comment: [PER Ridouane Khalid  ] and [PER Khaled Ben Mustafa  ] , two of the three ex-Guantanamo ( [ORG GTMO  ] ) detainees returned to [MISC French  ] custody on March 7 , were formally placed under investigation on " terrorist conspiracy " charges March 11 by terrorism investigating judges [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] and [PER Jean-Francois Ricard  ] . 
Later that evening , a " liberty and detention " judge upheld the terrorism judges' request that [PER Ben Mustafa  ] be sent to pretrial detention . 
Curiously , a few hours later on March 12 , the same " liberty and detention " judge examined [PER Ridouane Khalid  ] 's case and ordered him released pending trial . 
It is highly likely that the office of the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor will appeal the judge 's decision , but for the time being [PER Khalid  ] remains released on bail . 
The [PER Khalid  ] decision is the first setback for Judges [PER Bruguiere  ] and [PER Ricard  ] as they work on the " [MISC French  ] detainees in [LOC Guantanamo  ] " dossier . 
For the first time in this dossier , a defense lawyer won a victory for his client , a fact that would embolden the lawyers for the other five detainees still in pretrial detention . 
When reached March 14 , [PER Ricard  ] ( strictly protect throughout ) told [PER Poloff  ] that he was not optimistic regarding the dossier . 
He said the " liberty and detention " judge 's decision could impact the continued detention of the other five detainees . 
End summary and comment. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Poloff  ] spoke with Judges [PER Bruguiere  ] and [PER Ricard  ] on March 10 regarding the three ex-GTMO detainees returned to [MISC French  ] custody on Monday , March 7 . 
They confirmed that on March 11 , they would charge [PER Ridouane Khalid  ] and [PER Khaled Ben Mustafa  ] with " terrorist conspiracy , " which carries with it a maximum sentence of 10 years . 
They also revealed that the cases against the two would be more difficult than for the four original detainees returned to [LOC France  ] in the summer of 2004 . 
[PER Bruguiere  ] said that the DST had not uncovered any substantial additional information during the interrogation of [PER Khalid  ] and [PER Ben Mustafa  ] , which contrasts with the new information they had garnered from the original four detainees during their initial interrogation . 
[PER Ricard  ] confirmed this , and added that both [PER Khalid  ] and [PER Ben Mustafa  ] did not have substantial records of involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , in contrast to the original four . 
Regarding [PER Ben Mustafa  ] , [PER Ricard  ] said they had comparatively little information , due largely to the fact that [PER Ben Mustafa  ] had " barely enough time to set down his suitcase in [LOC Afghanistan  ] before 9/11 . 
" The [MISC French  ] have a little more on [PER Khalid  ] , but only because he was known to [MISC French  ] services as being active in underground [MISC Islamist  ] circles in [LOC Paris  ] as far back as 1998 . 
For these reasons , both judges said they personally considered the cases against [PER Khalid  ] and [PER Ben Mustafa  ] more difficult to prosecute. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Regarding the third detainee , [PER Mustaq Ali Patel  ] , [PER Bruguiere  ] confirmed March 10 that the [MISC French  ] had no derogatory information against him , and for this reason , he was released on March 9 ( reftel A ) . 
He also said that [PER Patel  ] has severe mental and physical problems , and [PER Bruguiere  ] believed these problems had been exacerbated during [PER Patel  ] 's multi-year imprisonment in [LOC Guantanamo.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Following the formal announcement of an investigation , [PER Khalid  ] and [PER Ben Mustafa  ] were brought before a " liberty and detention " judge whose role is to determine whether or not the defendant should be released on bail pending the trial or remanded to pretrial detention . 
[PER Ben Mustafa  ] went first and the judge ruled in favor of [PER Bruguiere  ] and [PER Ricard  ] 's requests that he be kept in pretrial detention . 
[PER Khalid  ] went before the same judge a few hours later and , surprisingly , given the similarity of the cases against the defendants , the judge ordered [PER Khalid  ] released pending trial . 
According to the Saturday ( March 12 ) edition of [ORG Le Monde  ] newspaper , the judge said [PER Khalid  ] 's long detention in [LOC Guantanamo  ] and the fact that the other five ex-GTMO detainees were in pretrial detention minimized [PER Khalid  ] 's flight risk. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Judge [PER Ricard  ] 's reaction March 14 reflected his surprise with the decision ; " Don't ask me for explanations ( for the judge 's decision ) because I don't have any . 
The ( liberty and detention ) judge 's reasoning makes no sense . 
" [PER Ricard  ] said he had been unsure of the two cases against [PER Khalid  ] and [PER Ben Mustafa  ] , but expected nonetheless that the judge would either approve the detention of both or reject the detention of both . 
[PER Ricard  ] said there were few differences in the cases against [PER Khalid  ] and [PER Ben Mustafa  ] . 
However , he speculated that the following three issues may have influenced the judge to order [PER Khalid  ] 's release: 1 ) [PER Khalid  ] 's lawyer , [PER Paul-Albert Iweins  ] , is a former president of the [ORG Paris Bar  ] and as such , is extremely skilled and reputable . 
This probably had a significant influence on the " liberty and detention " judge , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
2 ) [PER Khalid  ] is hepatitis-C positive and this , combined with other more minor medical issues , may have decreased the judge 's fear that [PER Khalid  ] was a flight risk ; and 3 ) [PER Khalid  ] was less talkative during the DST 's interrogation , said [PER Ricard  ] , which made compiling a dossier against him significantly more difficult. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Moving forward , [PER Ricard  ] said it was probable that the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor 's office , upon recommendation of the terrorism investigating judges , would appeal [PER Khalid  ] 's release this week . 
In addition , [PER Ben Mustafa  ] 's lawyer has filed two separate appeals for his release , one of which will be heard this week , and the other shortly thereafter . 
[PER Ricard  ] said the appeals were based largely on the fact that the cases against [PER Ben Mustafa  ] and [PER Khalid  ] were similar . 
The lawyer will argue , said [PER Ricard  ] , that if [PER Khalid  ] was released , [PER Ben Mustafa  ] must be released as well . 
[PER Ricard  ] said that the other four ex-GTMO detainees in pretrial detention since summer 2004 would undoubtedly resubmit petitions for their release based on the success of [PER Khalid  ] 's lawyer. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: In our dealings with [PER Ricard  ] and [PER Bruguiere  ] on the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees issue , [PER Ricard  ] has consistently evinced more uncertainty and his reaction to this first setback demonstrates that . 
The fact that the " liberty and detention " judge allowed bail for one defendant and not the other suggests that incarceration in [LOC Guantanamo  ] was not a decisive factor in deciding pretrial detention . 
[PER Ricard  ] and [PER Bruguiere  ] remain determined to pursue charges against six of the seven [MISC GTMO  ] detainees , although there is little doubt that their defense lawyers will redouble their efforts to obtain bail for the other detainees as a result of the " liberty and detention " judge 's decision . 
End comment .
