[LOC BAGHDAD  ] 289 Classified By: Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Patricia A. Butenis  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] - [ORG Quds Force  ] ( [ORG IRGC-QF  ] ) officers are active in [LOC Iraq  ] , conducting traditional espionage and supporting violent extremists as well as supporting both legitimate and malign [MISC Iranian  ] economic and cultural outreach . 
[MISC Iraqis  ] and their government have demonstrated increasing willingness to push back against malign [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the last year . 
Working with the [MISC Iraqis  ] , we have succeeded in stopping some [ORG IRGC-QF  ] activity through military operations and diplomatic engagement , while we prevented some [ORG IRGC-QF  ] officers from entering [LOC Iraq  ] through explicit warnings that we would target them unilaterally . 
However , under the [ORG Security Agreement  ] effective January 1 , all operations in [LOC Iraq  ] must be conducted in conjunction with [ORG Iraqi Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ISF  ] ) , and our previous unilateral warnings carry less weight . 
As [ORG Coalition Forces  ] continue the period of responsible drawdown , we will rely increasingly on the [MISC GOI  ] to keep the pressure on the [ORG IRGC-QF  ] . 
We intend to support the [MISC GOI  ] in these efforts through continued diplomatic engagement , intelligence sharing , and our security partnership of [ORG Coalition Forces  ] working by , with , and through the [ORG ISF  ] . 
End summary. ----------- Background: ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG IRGC-QF  ] leadership took advantage of the vacuum which surrounded the fall of [PER Saddam Hussein  ] and the entry of [ORG Coalition Forces  ] into [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 , using the opportunity to send operatives to [LOC Iraq  ] when little attention was focused on [LOC Iran  ] . 
In January 2007 , [ORG Coalition Forces  ] raided an unofficial [MISC Iranian  ] consulate in [LOC Erbil  ] , detaining five [MISC Iranians  ] who claimed to be diplomats but in reality held no diplomatic status . 
They were suspected of operations aimed at killing [ORG Coalition  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces ( refs A and B ) . 
The original targets of the raid , [ORG IRGC-QF  ] officers [PER Abbas Hoseyni  ] ( of the [LOC Erbil  ] office ) and [PER Hormat Faruqi  ] ( of the [LOC Sulaimaniyah  ] office ) , escaped and fled to [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] government immediately pulled back most [ORG IRGC-QF  ] officers from [LOC Iraq  ] and shuttered its " consulates " in [LOC Erbil  ] and [LOC Sulaymaniyah  ] until mid-2007 ; consulates in [LOC Basrah  ] and [LOC Karbala  ] remained open . 
Since 2007 , [LOC Iran  ] has submitted diplomatic visa applications for [PER Hoseini  ] and [PER Faruqi  ] to return to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
In 2008 the [MISC Embassy  ] and [MISC MNF-I  ] convinced the [MISC GOI  ] not to approve these applications , making it clear if they returned to [LOC Iraq  ] , they would be targeted by [ORG Coalition Forces.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Since 2008 , the [ORG MFA  ] has passed names of [MISC Iranians  ] applying for diplomatic visas to the [LOC US  ] [MISC Embassy  ] for vetting . 
Background checks have revealed that about 20 percent have possible ties to the [ORG IRGC  ] or [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Intelligence and Security  ] ( [ORG MOIS  ] ) ( ref C ) . 
The [ORG MFA  ] has informed us that it denies visas to all new suspected intelligence officers , but we have not been able to verify such claims . 
In January 2009 , the [ORG MFA  ] passed a list of 35 names to the [ORG USG  ] of [MISC Iranian  ] diplomats already in country before the vetting process began . 
Of those , eight had ties to [ORG IRGC  ] or [LOC MOIS.  ] -------- Strategy -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As [LOC U.S.  ] forces continue a period of responsible draw down , we will seek to ensure that the [MISC GOI  ] understands that [ORG IRGC-QF  ] activity harms [LOC Iraq  ] -- which should be self-evident if the [ORG IRGC-QF  ] continues to conduct malign activity that targets [MISC Iraqi  ] citizens and infrastructure . 
Qactivity that targets [MISC Iraqi  ] citizens and infrastructure . 
Engagements with political and security leadership at the national and provincial level , intelligence sharing , and security cooperation will be key to explaining the dangers of [ORG IRGC-QF  ] activity and providing [MISC Iraqis  ] the information they need to defend their own interests . 
The following are diplomatic , political , military , intelligence , and public information options which either the [MISC GOI  ] can pursue unilaterally , or in concert with the [ORG USG  ] , to target [ORG IRGC-QF  ] activity in [LOC Iraq.  ] --------- Diplomacy --------- [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00001103 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We intend to continue working closely with the [ORG MFA  ] to deny visas to [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence officers . 
We may also consider suggesting that the [ORG MFA  ] use another diplomatic tool , albeit one with more consequences -- the " persona non grata " designation . 
The [ORG MFA  ] may be reluctant to take this step because [MISC Iraqi  ] diplomats in [LOC Iran  ] would face retaliation and the dispute would inevitably become public . 
Since the fall of [PER Saddam  ] , the [MISC GOI  ] has avoided most public disagreements with [LOC Iran.  ] -------------------- [ORG Security Partnership  ] -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The role of the [ORG ISF  ] in countering [ORG IRGC-QF  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] is critical , yet complex . 
We can encourage the [MISC Iraqi  ] Army to take the lead on kinetic action against [ORG IRGC-QF  ] agents , with [MISC Iraqi  ] police monitoring and reacting to suspicious activity at the local level . 
We intend to continue to strengthen our partnership with the [ORG ISF  ] to counter pro-Iranian elements who have infiltrated the security forces such as [PER Kata'ib Hizbollah  ] and [PER Asa'ib Ahl  ] al-Haq . 
While the [LOC US  ] combat mission will end by August 31 , 2009 , we will continue to assist the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) with training , equipment , mentoring and other bilateral military-to-military programs and engagements . 
Military sales , such as the recent [MISC Iraqi  ] interest in purchasing [MISC F-16s  ] and plans to transition from [MISC AK-47  ] to [MISC M-4  ] rifles , will increase [LOC US  ] influence through training and support in [LOC Iraq  ] for years to come , although the [ORG MOD  ] will continue to consider weapons purchases from other sources as well. --------------- [ORG Border Controls  ] --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Department of Border Enforcement  ] ( [ORG DBE  ] ) can help limit [ORG IRGC-QF  ] activity by combating smuggling and scrutinizing people and cargo crossing legitimate routes from [LOC Iran  ] into [LOC Iraq  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX corruption at the ports of entry ( [ORG POEs  ] ) , unwillingness of inspectors to do their jobs , and poor leadership and professionalism at the supervisory level keep the [ORG DBE  ] from being fully effective . 
The [ORG USG  ] can assist , however . 
Personal Identification Secure Comparison and [ORG Evaluation System  ] ( [ORG PISCES  ] ) , which checks travelers' biographic data , is already in use at many land and air [ORG POEs  ] around [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Additional training at sea ports , airports , and land borders could help [MISC Iraqi  ] officials detect smugglers of cash , weapons , weapons components and other contraband . 
An [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG IRGC-QF  ] officer was briefly detained at [LOC Baghdad International Airport  ] in November 2008 when his name was flagged in [ORG PISCES  ] . 
In January 2009 , [ORG KRG  ] 's Minister of the [ORG Interior  ] [PER Karim Sinjari  ] praised [ORG PISCES  ] and asked for the system at two more land border entry points the [ORG KRG  ] shares with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] and [PER Hadjer Meran.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) As of April 2009 , there were 200 [ORG PISCES  ] units in operation at 15 different [ORG POEs  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Current guidance states that every traveler entering or exiting [LOC Iraq  ] is processed through [ORG PISCES  ] . 
On occasion however , travelers will pay a small " fee " to enter or exit without going through [ORG PISCES  ] . 
If a potential match is found to someone on the " stop list , " the screen freezes , and only [ORG INIS  ] can unlock the screen and conduct a secondary inspection . 
[ORG INIS  ] notifies the [MISC GOI  ] or [ORG USG  ] when the identity of a wanted person is confirmed . 
[ORG PISCES  ] is operated by Immigration officers assigned to the [ORG Department of Travel and Nationality  ] , and the [MISC GOI  ] will continue to use [ORG PISCES  ] after the military drawdown . 
Collection and storage of biometric data is another tool the [MISC QCollection  ] and storage of biometric data is another tool the [MISC GOI  ] is already using at [ORG POEs  ] , although [ORG Biometric Automated Toolset  ] ( [ORG BAT  ] ) system is run by [LOC U.S.  ] forces and will not stay in [LOC Iraq  ] after their departure. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A timely example of cooperation with [ORG DBE  ] in countering [MISC Iranian  ] lethal aid smuggling occurred April 14 . 
A [ORG DBE  ] brigade in [LOC Maysan Province  ] , partnered with Multi-National Division-South ( [ORG MND-S  ] ) forces , captured an unmanned boat carrying explosive devices floating in the [LOC Huwayza Marsh  ] . 
The patrol found three explosively formed projectiles ( EFPs ) and other military equipment . 
[ORG MND-S  ] said it was the first time the [ORG DBE  ] had reported success against this type of smuggling. -------------------- Intelligence Sharing -------------------- [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00001103 003 OF 003 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Coordinating with [MISC GOI  ] intelligence agencies to stop [ORG IRGC-QF  ] activity is complicated by the fact that the [MISC Iraqi  ] intelligence establishment is extremely fragmented . 
Intelligence offices affiliated with the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) , [ORG DBE  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of State for National Security Affairs  ] ( [ORG MSNSA  ] ) do not trust each other and often work in opposition . 
The [ORG USG  ] could further assist [MISC Iraqi  ] intelligence by negotiating and approving a bilateral [MISC US-Iraqi  ] intelligence sharing agreements and further providing the [MISC GOI  ] with intelligence that demonstrates the involvement of [ORG IRGC-QF  ] officers in lethal assistance to extremists . 
[ORG US Forces  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] have established positive relationships with their [ORG ISF  ] counterparts and are developing appropriate intelligence-sharing mechanisms . 
The [ORG USG  ] can also assist the [MISC GOI  ] to further develop its intelligence infrastructure to monitor malign [MISC Iranian  ] influence and counter the [ORG IRGC-QF  ] . 
[ORG INIS  ] currently interacts closely with the [ORG Office of Regional Affairs  ] ( [ORG ORA  ] ) . 
The establishment of a [ORG Defense Attach  ] 's [ORG Office  ] at the Embassy will also help facilitate intelligence sharing and is under consideration by Chief of [LOC Mission.  ] ------------------- Public Information ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Highlighting nefarious [MISC Iranian  ] activity to [MISC GOI  ] leadership and the [MISC Iraqi  ] public has had a significant impact on increasing [MISC GOI  ] willingness to confront [LOC Iran  ] , as well as public rejection of [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to dominate [LOC Iraq  ] 's political and economic sectors . 
Provincial elections demonstrated that perceived fealty to [LOC Iran  ] is a political liability for [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians , and they are increasingly sensitive to it . 
Continued [ORG USG  ] assistance in uncovering and publicizing [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to influence events in [LOC Iraq  ] will make the country a much more inhospitable environment for [ORG IRGC-QF  ] operatives. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Iranian  ] government may sense that the drawdown of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces in [LOC Iraq  ] presents an opportunity to expand [ORG IRGC-QF  ] activity , although the broader regional dynamic will undoubtedly also influence [MISC Iranian  ] decision making . 
Without the ability to conduct unilateral military action against [ORG IRGC-QF  ] operatives in [LOC Iraq  ] , we will leverage our evolving diplomatic , intelligence , security , and military partnerships with [LOC Iraq  ] to maintain pressure . 
Many [ORG USG  ] agencies will be involved in assisting the [MISC Iraqis  ] in this critical area , and must actively engage in order to counter [ORG IRGC-QF  ] officers and their lethal aid .
