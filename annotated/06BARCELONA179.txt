( [ORG SBU  ] ) In an emotional and dramatic November 28 ceremony , [PER Jose Montilla  ] received the medal signifying his position as President from out-going President [PER Pascal Maragall  ] and was formally decreed as the 128th President of the Generalitat , the high seat of [MISC Catalan  ] government . 
As his parents looked on , [PER Montilla  ] pronounced himself " the most humble servant of the [MISC Catalan  ] people . 
" Later , as he introduced his new government , it became clear there would be some continuity , but also a significant shuffling of responsibilities - further admission that this government would work hard not to repeat the mistakes of the one it was replacing . 
In remarks to the press , the new president repeated his vow to focus on social issues , and declared that his government would act with prudence and speak with one voice - yet another reflection of the weaknesses of the past government , which was reportedly rife with in-fighting between the three parties that made up the coalition ( Tripartit ) . 
Visibly emotional , [PER Maragall  ] fondly recalled his time in public service and wished the in-coming government well . 
Significantly , he noted that [PER Montilla  ] 's heritage did not make [LOC Catalonia  ] " less [MISC Catalan  ] " , but rather confirmed that " our new homeland is [LOC Europe  ] , " and later , " our new path is the [MISC Mediterranean  ] . 
" A New [MISC Era Begins~  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Montilla  ] , thus , becomes the first President of [LOC Catalonia  ] since the post-Franco era not to have been born in [LOC Catalonia  ] - he was born near [LOC Cordoba  ] - a fact focused on by the media . 
Opinions appear to fall into two broad categories on this issue: many believe [PER Montilla  ] 's " foreign " roots are a sign of growing social maturity in the region . 
Others are scarcely able to hide their discomfort with the fact that an " outsider " has taken over . 
( [PER Note: Montilla  ] , who comes from very humble beginnings , moved to [LOC Catalonia  ] as a child in 1971 . 
End note . 
) Heritage aside , a major reason [PER Montilla  ] 's ascent to the presidency stands out is the striking difference in demeanor from that man he is replacing . 
[PER Montilla  ] quickly named his new team - a mixture of carryovers from the previous government and some new faces - and projected a sense of unity , something the out-going government reportedly failed to do . 
Few doubt [PER Montilla  ] 's seriousness and work ethic , but clearly many are withholding judgment on his ability to keep vice president [PER Josep Carod Rovira  ] ( [MISC Republican  ] Left ) and Interior Counselor [PER Joan Saura  ] ( [ORG Green  ] ) in line. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) If body language is any indication , [PER Montilla  ] will not be able to count on a " honeymoon " period as he takes the helm . 
[ORG Convergence and Union  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] ) President [PER Artur Mas  ] , who sat stonily eyeing [PER Montilla  ] 's investiture , later dismissed the new government as the same as the old one , and predicted it would likely be just as ( un ) successful , in remarks to the press . 
And Another Ends <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pascal Maragall  ] 's [MISC Catalan  ] roots run deep and his shadow will loom large over [PER Montilla  ] 's presidency just as [PER Jordi Pujol  ] 's shadow continues even today . 
[PER Maragall  ] is the grandson of a famous poet of the region , and his brother , [PER Ernest Maragall  ] , will continue the family tradition of public service as Counselor for Education and also one of President [PER Montilla  ] 's closest advisors . 
[PER Maragall  ] 's emotional farewell speech recalled his years as mayor ( when he successfully brought the 1992 [MISC Olympics  ] to [ORG Barcelona  ] ) and president ( where he oversaw the growing economic and political strength of the region . 
) He also fondly made note of his close relationship with the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: While still early days , our sense is [PER Montilla  ] will have very little time to whip the reconstituted Tripartit into shape and show positive results . 
The media are already on the alert for any signs of discord . 
Naming the prickly [MISC Carod-Rovira  ] vice president and giving him the external affairs portfolio ( nominally in charge of implementing the statute ( [ORG Estatut  ] ) governing relations between [LOC Catalonia  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] ) will either prove to be a stroke of genius or a big mistake . 
[PER Carod  ] left [PER Maragall  ] 's government over the [ORG Estatut  ] negotiations , but has recently expressed some regret over that decision . 
Another test has already begun in the area of public security . 
In a surprise move , the head of the [ORG Mossos  ] d'Escuadra ( [LOC Catalonia  ] 's regional police force ) , [PER Joan Unio  ] , announced his resignation effective immediately before [ORG Green  ] party president [PER Saura  ] was named Interior Counselor . 
[PER Unio  ] was an extremely helpful Consulate General contact . 
There is speculation that [PER Unio  ] , who appeared to have a good relationship with the previous Interior head , did not think he could work as effectively with the new team . 
On the record , according to the [ORG Mossos  ] website , [PER Unio  ] is leaving to pursue other opportunities in the private sector . 
No word yet on a replacement .
