[ORG TD-314/054350-09 Classified By: CDA Thomas  ] P. [PER Kelly  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: [MISC Argentine  ] President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] 's ( [ORG CFK  ] ) promotion of former Justice Minister [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] ( [ORG AF  ] ) to Cabinet Chief puts in place someone with six years of experience working for the [ORG First Couple  ] , first as former president [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] 's Interior Minister and then as [ORG CFK  ] 's Justice Minister . 
By dint of his office 's physical proximity to the President 's as well as his portfolio 's constitutional responsibilities , [ORG AF  ] is in a position to wield significant power and influence , and is already playing a key role in shaping [PER Casa Rosada  ] politics , policy , and message. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG AF  ] has been the most accessible member of [ORG CFK  ] 's Cabinet for the [ORG Embassy  ] , but , unlike his two immediate predecessors , he has also not been shy about vociferously attacking the [ORG USG  ] ( or any other target ) in order to defend the Kirchners . 
Like many [MISC Argentine  ] politicians , he is dogged by corruption rumors , including ties to narcotrafficking , according to unsubstantiated press and intelligence reports ( ref A ) . 
Additionally , he is suspected of directing intelligence teams to clandestinely monitor the emails of the administration 's political opponents , according to separate intelligence reports ( refs B and C ) , and he has been linked to reported [ORG CFK  ] administration efforts to secure additional votes illegally in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] and [LOC Cordoba  ] provinces ahead of the June midterms . 
Despite the varied and persistent accusations of corruption lodged against him , however , there is no hard evidence . 
End Summary . 
[ORG CFK Rewards Fernandez' Loyalty  ] with [ORG Cabinet Chief Post  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Former Minister of Justice , [ORG Human Rights and Security  ] [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] ( [ORG AF  ] ) became [ORG CFK  ] 's third Chief of [ORG Cabinet  ] since she assumed office in December 2007 . 
A longtime Peronist and a close ally of former President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] ( [ORG NK  ] ) , [ORG AF  ] has worked over six years for the presidential couple , since the first day of [ORG NK  ] 's term . 
He has been one of the administration 's most outspoken public defenders , first while serving as [ORG NK  ] 's Interior Minister and later as [ORG CFK  ] 's Justice Minister . 
Many viewed [ORG AF  ] 's promotion to [ORG Cabinet  ] Chief as a reward for securing in his hometown of [LOC Quilmes  ] one of the few significant [PER Kirchner  ] victories in the June 28 mid-term elections ( ref E ) . 
Origins of the [ORG Cabinet Chief Post  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As [ORG Cabinet  ] Chief , [ORG AF  ] has considerable power and influence . 
The authors of the 1994 constitutional reforms intended the position to be a check on presidential power as a watered-down prime minister , although in practice the [ORG Cabinet Chief  ] has become a presidential chief of staff , spokesman , and all-purpose firefighter . 
The [ORG Cabinet Chief  ] is technically responsible for the collection of national taxes ; submitting the executive 's budget request to [ORG Congress  ] ; co-signing executive decrees ; appointing administration employees not designated by the President ; and overseeing the [ORG Cabinet  ] 's ministers . 
Additionally , the President 's [ORG Cabinet Chief  ] is expected to report at least monthly to [ORG Congress  ] , alternating between the [ORG Lower House  ] and the [ORG Senate  ] . 
( [LOC Note:  ] The last two cabinet chiefs , [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] and [PER Sergio Massa  ] , appeared before [ORG Congress  ] less than once a year ; [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] will make his first such appearance this week . 
) Under the [LOC Ks  ] , Cabinet Chief Influence Grew ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Under the [PER Kirchner  ] administration , the cabinet chief position has grown in influence beyond its constitutionally-proscribed powers . 
Since 2002 , the [MISC Argentine  ] [ORG Congress  ] has annually authorized economic " superpowers " for the executive branch . 
Originally enacted to address the 2001 financial crisis , these controversial superpowers enable the [ORG Cabinet Chief  ] to redistribute federal funds coming from export taxes and tax collections above and beyond budget estimates , at the President 's discretion. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Cabinet Chief  ] 's influence ultimately depends on his relationship with the [ORG First Couple  ] . 
[ORG AF  ] 's immediate predecessor , the media-friendly [PER Sergio Massa  ] , reportedly had differences with [ORG NK  ] over style and substance . 
Their tense relationship soured even further with [ORG NK  ] 's poor showing in [PER Massa  ] 's hometown in the June 28 midterm elections ( ref E ) . 
[PER Alberto Fernandez  ] ( not related to [ORG AF  ] ) , who served as [ORG CFK  ] 's and [ORG NK  ] 's first Cabinet Chief , was one of the few capable of moderating the temperamental [ORG First Couple  ] . 
But even he was unable to walk the Kirchners back from their take-no-prisoners approach to an extended conflict with the farm sector , and he resigned in July 2008 out of frustration ( ref F ) . 
Amid a cabinet that does not speak much to the media , [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] has long been one of the most visible spokesmen for the Kirchners , and his influence over policy and political decisions will likely grow in his new post . 
[ORG Embassy Interaction  ] with [PER Fernandez  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG AF  ] has been for us the most accessible and forward-leaning member of [ORG CFK  ] 's [ORG Cabinet  ] , welcoming [ORG USG  ] law enforcement training and cooperation ( ref G ) . 
Again and again , he has gone out of his way to rearrange his travel schedule to meet with visiting [LOC U.S.  ] officials and greet [ORG Embassy  ] officials at diplomatic events . 
Although he has frequently told us that he is the most " pro-American " member of [ORG CFK  ] 's [ORG Cabinet  ] , we think this reflects his deep-seated pragmatism rather than any abiding affinity for the [LOC United States  ] . 
Our positive working relationship with [PER Fernandez  ] , for example , did not stop him from criticizing the [LOC United States  ] to protect the Kirchners , as he did during the 2007-08 suitcase scandal ( ref H ) . 
Nonetheless , he was one of the first [MISC Argentine  ] officials to assure [ORG Embassy  ] officials that the suitcase scandal was " water under the bridge . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) More political hack than diplomat , [ORG AF  ] is a fiefdom-builder who loathes giving up control over strategic resources . 
When he moved from the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] to [ORG Justice  ] , for example , he took the internal security agencies with him . 
Many believe that even now , as Cabinet Chief , [ORG AF  ] retains operational control over the law enforcement forces. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Although [ORG AF  ] confided to the [ORG Embassy  ] 's former LEGAT that he was not in a position to micromanage the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] at first , he said he immediately centralized control once he got the lay of the land . 
As Chief of the internal security forces , including the [ORG Border Patrol/Paramilitary Police  ] ( [ORG Gendarmeria Nacional  ] ) , [ORG Coast Guard  ] , federal police , and special airport police , [ORG AF  ] quickly imposed a strict vertical hierarchy where he discouraged information sharing and commanded security chiefs to report directly to him . 
He has boasted to [ORG Embassy  ] officials that while his predecessor at [ORG Justice  ] , [PER Alberto Iribarne  ] , only signed a few ministerial decrees , he signed hundreds . 
Judicial contacts have told us that as Justice Minister , he even tried to pressure provincial judges to advise him of any judicial assistance requests from federal judges , but subsequently backtracked on that position after judges complained that the directive interfered with judicial independence . 
His micro-management over even routine matters in his portfolio resulted in bureaucratic backlogs for us . 
Naming participants to [LOC U.S.  ] training programs , the visits of [ORG Transportation Security Administration  ] teams to conduct airport/air carrier assessments , and clearance for [ORG U.S. Federal Air Marshals  ] all required his personal approval . 
Once , when the [ORG DCM  ] visited [PER Fernandez  ] 's Chief of Staff at [ORG Justice  ] , [PER Fernandez  ] got wind of the meeting while it was in progress , got into a car , and stormed into the office , taking over the meeting while the chief of staff clammed up. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) A pragmatic and politically savvy interlocutor , [ORG AF  ] prefers not to include his staff in meetings with [ORG Embassy  ] officials . 
Although he is always well-prepared , his speech and demeanor can sometimes be crass . 
On more than one occasion , he has taken obvious notice of an attractive translator during a meeting with visiting [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
Additionally , he has referred to the existence of local " demand for young genitals " when explaining the challenges his [ORG Ministry  ] faces in fighting human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation . 
[ORG AF Denies Drug Problem , Advocates Decriminalization  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Although he has not interfered with [ORG USG  ] CN activity here insofar as we can ascertain , [ORG AF  ] has frequently denied that drug trafficking is a major problem in [LOC Argentina  ] , despite evidence indicating that [MISC Colombian  ] and [MISC Mexican  ] drug cartels operate in [LOC Argentina  ] , and that [LOC Argentina  ] leads [LOC Latin America  ] in cocaine consumption . 
[PER AF  ] insists that [LOC Argentina  ] is merely a transit point and continues to deny the existence of drug labs in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
In an October 2008 workshop on [MISC Argentine  ] narcotics policy , [PER AF  ] described press reports claiming that drug cartels had established production facilities in [LOC Argentina  ] ( ref I ) as mere fiction . 
He is also a long-time advocate for the decriminalization of drug use , saying he dreams " of the day when drug addicts are sent to rehab instead of prison . 
" [PER AF  ] argues that the government should stop focusing on small-time carriers in order to focus on dismantling large drug trafficking networks ( ref J ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to late December 2006 intelligence reporting ( ref K ) , [PER AF  ] advised then [PER Vice-President Scioli  ] that he should not make counternarcotics his number one campaign issue when he ran for Governor of [LOC Buenos Aires  ] province . 
Reasoning that the narcotraffickers are well-organized with the capacity to frame politicians , [PER AF  ] suggested that [PER Scioli  ] pay only lip service to counternarcotics efforts . 
He argued that [PER Scioli  ] should not assume the risks since drug-related crimes would never be resolved . 
Ties to Drug Trafficking ? ------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Unsubstantiated press and intelligence reports ( refs A and M ) suggest that [PER AF  ] may be financially profiting from narcotrafficking . 
These reports state that [PER AF  ] 's ties to narcotrafficking date back to 1994 when [PER AF  ] was mayor of [LOC Quilmes  ] and allegedly directed a cocaine trafficking network . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] 's [ORG DEA  ] section has heard similar allegations from contacts at the [MISC Argentine  ] [ORG Counternarcotics Secretariat  ] ( [ORG SEDRONAR  ] ) , which has been at loggerheads with [PER AF  ] . 
[ORG SEDRONAR  ] contacts told poloff that [PER AF  ] personally called off an ongoing drug investigation in [LOC Salta  ] province near the [MISC Bolivian  ] border when he got wind of the investigation. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We have no information to corroborate these allegations , and we are unaware of any formal legal complaint against him on narcotrafficking charges . 
However , there are two formal legal complaints pending against former subordinates -- including [ORG Federal Police  ] officials -- for protecting or willfully ignoring various illegal brothels in the [LOC Monserrat  ] neighborhood ( within a five-block radius of [ORG Federal Police  ] headquarters ) in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] City where the sale of drugs is suspected . 
Spying on the Opposition ------------------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Intelligence reporting suggests that [PER AF  ] has not hesitated to resort to questionable means to keep tabs on political opponents . 
In mid-May 2007 , [PER AF  ] , as Interior Minister , allegedly directed a private intelligence team composed of retired military and intelligence officers to clandestinely monitor the emails of provincial and federal government officials , business executives and journalists suspected of working against [ORG NK  ] 's administration ( ref B ) . 
In September 2007 , he reportedly used a private , unofficial investigative team to read the emails and collect derogatory information on then-gubernatorial candidates for [LOC Buenos Aires  ] province , [PER Francisco de Narvaez  ] and [PER Juan Carlos Blumberg  ] , and [LOC Buenos Aires  ] province Minister of Security [PER Leon Arslanian  ] ( ref C ) . 
According to intelligence reporting in November 2007 , [PER AF  ] used two computer technicians to hack into high-level email accounts , including Chief [PER Justice Lorenzetti  ] 's email ( ref G ) . 
[LOC San Isidro  ] judge [PER Sandra Arroyo-Salgado  ] ( wife of [PER Alberto Nisman  ] , the Special Prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the [MISC Argentine Jewish Mutual Association  ] ( [ORG AMIA  ] ) ) is investigating [PER AF  ] 's relationship with the two technicians , according to press reports . 
( Note: These technicians in the past have been associated with [LOC Argentina  ] 's [ORG State Secretariat for Intelligence  ] ( [ORG SIDE  ] ) and sought asylum in [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG AF  ] reportedly may have played a tangential role in illegally bolstering voter registration ahead of the June 28 midterms , according to a June 2009 intelligence report . 
He supported efforts -- led by Interior Minister [PER Florencio Randazzo  ] and Secretary of Intelligence [PER Hector Icazuriaga  ] -- to illegally procure national registry identification numbers ( DNIs ) to register ostensible supporters and secure additional votes in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] and [LOC Cordoba  ] provinces ( ref L ) . 
Transparency ------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Although [PER AF  ] once bragged to the [ORG Embassy  ] 's former LEGAT that he has a " transparent and honest style , " he did little as Justice Minister to fortify his agency 's anti-corruption efforts or enhance governmental transparency . 
Admittedly , the [ORG MOJ  ] 's [ORG Anti-Corruption Office  ] ( [ORG ACO  ] ) was a weak unit to begin with , but it made no headway during [PER AF  ] 's tenure . 
Contacts who work for the Cabinet Chief 's government accountability and transparency unit have expressed concern that the [ORG GOA  ] will become even less transparent under his watch . 
They note that since [PER AF  ] took over as chief of the internal security forces , criminal statistics are no longer public information . 
Indeed , despite public alarm over rising insecurity , [PER AF  ] refuses to acknowledge a rise in robberies and kidnappings and instead has argued that insecurity is only " a sensation fed by the media . 
" Corruption ---------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Like many [MISC Argentine  ] politicians , [PER AF  ] has been dogged by rumors of corruption . 
In recent years , some [ORG Embassy  ] contacts have alleged that [PER AF  ] has a corrupt relationship with the [MISC Japanese  ] computer company , [ORG NEC  ] . 
When [PER AF  ] was mayor of [LOC Quilmes  ] ( 1991-1995 ) , he was charged with several counts of corruption , becoming a fugitive for 48 hours . 
Although he was later acquitted , he has continued to face accusations of corruption from the opposition , and the allegations remain fresh in the minds of some [MISC Argentines  ] . 
When CFK named him Minister of Justice , one judicial contact told us that many in the judicial system considered the appointment " ironic " and called [PER AF  ] the " fugitive from [LOC Quilmes  ] . 
" [ORG Bio Data  ] -------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER AF  ] began his political career in 1983 , working first as an advisor to the budget committee of the [LOC Buenos Aires  ] provincial [ORG Senate  ] . 
From 1985 to 1987 , he served as the administrative secretary for the [MISC Peronist  ] party ( [ORG PJ  ] ) in the [LOC Buenos Aires  ] provincial [ORG Senate  ] . 
He also simultaneously held positions in the municipal councils of [LOC Quilmes  ] and [PER Florencio Varela  ] . 
In 1991 , [PER AF  ] was elected mayor of [LOC Quilmes  ] . 
In 1995 , he won a provincial [ORG Senate  ] seat where he presided over the [ORG Commission  ] on [ORG Public Health and Control  ] over Addictions . 
He was named provincial government secretary in 1997 , labor secretary in 1999 , and the province , s first labor minister in 2001 . 
[PER AF  ] served in former President [PER Eduardo Duhalde  ] 's cabinet as secretary general of the presidency in January 2002 , and then as production minister in October of the same year . 
He switched allegiance to [ORG NK  ] in 2004 when the [MISC Peronist  ] party split into two factions - one that supported [ORG NK  ] and another that supported [PER Duhalde  ] . 
Since then , [PER Duhalde  ] supporters have called him a traitor and the " first [ORG Kirchner  ] convert . 
" In 2007 , CFK tapped him to serve as her Justice Minister and on July 7 she named him Cabinet Chief. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER AF  ] was born in [LOC Quilmes  ] , [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Province on January 9 , 1957 . 
A public accountant , [PER AF  ] received his law degree while serving as Interior Minister . 
Although the Kirchners stifled [PER AF  ] 's ambitions to run for Governor of [LOC BA  ] province in 2007 when they tapped then Vice President [PER Daniel Scioli  ] for the job , [PER AF  ] 's power and influence within the [ORG Kirchner  ] Cabinet has steadily grown . 
He accompanied CFK to the [LOC United States  ] in July when she went to the [ORG OAS  ] to discuss the political crisis in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
He also accompanied her in May 2007 when she addressed the [MISC American Jewish Committee  ] as Senator and [ORG First Lady  ] . 
During that visit , he met with the [ORG U.S. Attorney General  ] , [ORG FBI  ] officials , and [ORG State Department  ] officers on TIP-related issues . 
[PER AF  ] lives in the trendy waterfront [LOC Puerto Madero  ] neighborhood in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] City with his wife and one son . 
A fan of technology , he carries multiple cell phones and his office has six television sets permanently tuned in to every local news channel . 
He speaks limited [MISC English  ] . 
Comment: Handle with Care ------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( S ) For USG officials , [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] has long been the most readily accessible [ORG GOA  ] cabinet member . 
That has continued since he became Cabinet Chief , assuming more importance than ever . 
[PER Fernandez  ] has far better access to the ruling first couple than any other member of the Cabinet ; perhaps only reclusive [PER Casa Rosada  ] staffer [PER Carlos Zannini  ] has more influence with the Kirchners . 
Given [PER AF  ] 's importance , accessibility , and the absence of hard evidence to substantiate the allegations described above , we continue to meet and work with him . 
At the same time , there are enough rumors about [PER Fernandez  ] -- even in this rumor-plagued , conspiratorial society -- to approach interactions with him with some caution .
