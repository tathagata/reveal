( C ) SUMMARY . 
Recently arrived [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador [PER Jorge Dezcallar  ] made a courtesy call on Secretary [PER Rice  ] to discuss the bilateral relationship . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] opened by saying he was asked to personally deliver a message from the King of [LOC Spain  ] of his desire to improve relations . 
They discussed their shared concern over recent developments in [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , the need for real change in [LOC Cuba  ] under [PER Raul Castro  ] , [PER Moratinos'  ] positive role in the [LOC Middle East  ] , and differences over [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] closed by requesting the Secretary 's support for [LOC Spain  ] 's 2010 candidacy in the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] . 
The Secretary wished [LOC Spain  ] luck and commented on [LOC Spain  ] 's strong human rights record , but admitted that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not active in the [ORG Council  ] and doesn't view it as a functioning organization . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------------- Bilateral Relationship ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) Ambassador [PER Dezcallar  ] expressed his intention " to work very hard to improve relations during his tenure " as ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] . 
He relayed to the Secretary that he had spoken to both the King of [LOC Spain  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] in the past two days and both expressed their wish to strengthen the bilateral relationship . 
Both the Secretary and [PER Dezcallar  ] agreed that relations are good between the two countries , but there is room for improvement. ---------------------- [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Almost immediately , the conversation turned to recent events in [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] and the Secretary agreed that while both situations are domestic problems , they are developing into crises of international concern . 
The Secretary noted that while she sympathizes with the [MISC Bolivian  ] people , the [MISC Bolivian  ] regime is making it very difficult for the [LOC United States  ] to help them . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] agreed that the [MISC Bolivian  ] people are suffering , and that resolution is " through consultation , not violence . 
" Both agreed that [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] is " out of his league " in his attempts to govern the country. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On [LOC Venezuela  ] , Ambassador [PER Dezcallar  ] recounted how he was forced to wait three hours for a meeting with [PER Chavez  ] several years ago , then heard mindless chatter from [PER Chavez  ] for a few hours before being allowed to make his official request for [LOC Venezuela  ] to turn over 6 [ORG ETA  ] members wanted for killing 36 Spaniards . 
When [PER Dezcallar  ] was finally able to make his appeal , [PER Chavez  ] readily agreed . 
Only when [PER Dezcallar  ] got out of the meeting did he learn that [PER Chavez  ] stalled for enough time to let the [ORG ETA  ] members escape from detention . 
The Secretary responded that the [LOC United States  ] has found that ignoring [PER Chavez  ] is the best policy , and the lack of attention frustrates him more than admonition. ----- [LOC Cuba  ] ----- STATE 00100219 002 OF 002 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Secretary stated she remains unconvinced of the sincerity of minor post-Fidel changes in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
She emphasized the need to make real change , as opposed to cosmetic ones . 
For example , [MISC Cubans  ] should have access to cell phones and the [MISC Internet  ] . 
The Ambassador countered that GoS doesn't think that changes in [LOC Cuba  ] since [PER Raul  ] 's ascent to power have been cosmetic . 
He denied that [PER Raul  ] is another [PER Fidel  ] , but warned against being too heavy-handed and " scaring him off , or he will be even more difficult . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [PER Dezcallar  ] commented that [LOC Cuba  ] is going through hard times this hurricane season , and the Secretary confirmed that the [LOC United States  ] has already offered humanitarian aid. ------ [LOC Kosovo  ] ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Europe  ] , the Secretary asked if there was any chance [LOC Spain  ] would recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] demurred " not any time soon . 
" The Secretary replied that she hoped [LOC Spain  ] would not recognize the breakaway [MISC Georgian  ] provinces of [LOC South Ossetia  ] or [LOC Abkhazia  ] , and [PER Dezcallar  ] assured her they would not. ----------------- [LOC Middle East Peace  ] ----------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Secretary and Ambassador [PER Dezcallar  ] briefly discussed the [MISC Israeli/Palestinian  ] peace process and Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos'  ] whirlwind trip through the region September 12-17 . 
Secretary [PER Rice  ] said that [PER Moratinos  ] has been helpful in the [LOC Middle East  ] , and made reference to her trilateral meeting with [MISC Israeli  ] Foreign Minister [PER Livni  ] and the head of the [MISC Palestinian  ] negotiating team , [PER Abu Alaa  ] , on August 26 , 2008 . 
The Secretary and [PER Dezcallar  ] agreed that the situation was not all bad and noted that [MISC Palestinian  ] forces are taking on more responsibility. --------------------- [ORG Human Rights Council  ] --------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Mirroring FM [PER Moratinos'  ] request to the Secretary during their May 19 meeting , Ambassador [PER Dezcallar  ] again asked for the [LOC United States'  ] support of [MISC Spanish  ] candidacy to the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] in the next election ( 2010 ) . 
Similar to her response then , the Secretary said the [LOC U.S.  ] may not vote at all , as she considers the council a " disaster . 
" However , she noted that the council needed countries with good human rights records , like [LOC Spain  ] , to hold seats .
