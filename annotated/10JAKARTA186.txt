Action/funding request in paragraph 5 . 
2 . 
Summary: [ORG Mission Indonesia  ] requests immediate additional funding to use new media and social networking tools maximize online outreach for the POTUS visit scheduled for late March , 2010 . 
Already the leading [LOC U.S. Mission  ] in the world on [ORG Facebook  ] with nearly 50,000 “fans , ” and one of the leading Missions using [PER Twitter  ] , [ORG YouTube  ] and engaging local bloggers to promote USG messages and information , we are uniquely positioned to use these tools to amplify key topics and themes to support the upcoming visit by President [PER Obama  ] . 
We request $100,000 in funding from R to boost our [ORG Facebook  ] fan page membership to 1 million , and can accomplish this in 30 days . 
End Summary . 
Proven PD 2.0 Expertise <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[ORG U.S. Mission Indonesia  ] is on the forefront of Public Diplomacy 2.0 . 
With over 50,000 fans the most of any diplomatic mission worldwide , are gaining traction using social media in [LOC Indonesia  ] for PD . 
Our efforts were recently cited in an article on [LOC CNET Asia  ] , as “a great example of social media interaction in [LOC Indonesia  ] , ” prompting the author to wonder “how long will it take for other organizations and businesses to do the same ? ” We also have our own [ORG YouTube  ] channel with over 300 videos , almost 1,000 followers on [PER Twitter  ] , and -- for the last two years -- engaged positively with thousands of country’s most influential bloggers . 
[ORG Indonesia’s New Media Environment  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[ORG Indonesia’s  ] internet community is emerging , but recently has become a powerful political force for reform ( reftel ) . 
With roughly 10% of the population able to access the internet at least monthly , this represents over 25 million people , nearly half of whom are on [ORG Facebook  ] . 
In the seventh-largest and one of the fastest-growing [ORG Facebook  ] markets in the world , we will directly reach a young , urban population which does not rely on traditional media as information sources . 
In addition , Indonesians’ special connection to the 44th President means that interest in the visit is incredibly high . 
Our [ORG Facebook  ] post announcing the visit had interactions and comments from over 1,000 people in less than two weeks , and stories about the visit appeared in the media every day since the official announcement. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
By actively connecting the POTUS visit to our new media efforts , we have a unique chance to build a sustainable online platform to engage [MISC Indonesians  ] on USG issues and messages long after the visit . 
With enough funding to properly amplify and build on past our successes , [ORG Mission Indonesia  ] requests $100,000 immediately in order reach a goal of 1 million [ORG Facebook  ] fans in just 30 days -- just before POTUS visit . 
[ORG Action Plan and Implementation  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
This money would be used in three areas . 
First , it would increase direct advertising via [ORG Facebook  ] . 
Currently , Embassy [LOC Jakarta  ] spends less than $25 per day on advertising , and nets between 300-400 new fans daily . 
Increasing this tenfold over 30 days , results in a gain of 100,000 to 120,000 fans . 
The funds would also be used to promote the visit and our fan page as the place to learn more by extensively advertising on [MISC Indonesian  ] online portals , banner ads , [ORG YouTube  ] , [PER Twitter  ] , and other promotional efforts , including embedding bloggers , contests and giveaways , and using [ORG SMS  ] technology . 
With over 100 million mobile phone users in [LOC Indonesia  ] , texting is a powerful way to include a huge audience . 
Partnering with a major telecom provider , we can encourage [MISC Indonesians  ] to sign up for real-time updates via their cell phone -- a great way to reach those not yet online about the visit . 
[LOC Cost:  ] $60,000. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
Another key promotion strategy to generate interest will be offering a “golden ticket” via [ORG Facebook  ] . 
We propose making a dream come true for one lucky [MISC Indonesian  ] , by providing an opportunity to meet POTUS during his visit . 
If the [LOC White House  ] approves , we could invite fans to post why they should meet President [PER Obama  ] , and in doing so , use our social media platform to connect fans to the visit , as well as build excitement beforehand and follow-up coverage afterwards . 
In addition , we could partner with a local TV station to have a “finalist” show and increase coverage . 
[ORG RSO  ] would ensure any winner ( s ) are vetted for security issues . 
If the [LOC White House  ] would not agree to this , an alternate “dream prize” might be an educational trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Cost:  ] $15,000. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Third , in order to implement these ideas in this limited time-frame , we need short-term expert help on this promotion in the form of a qualified local digital marketing agency , who could assist the [MISC Embassy’s  ] new media team ( currently one officer and three [MISC FSNs  ] working on it part-time ) . 
[LOC Cost:  ] $25,000 .
