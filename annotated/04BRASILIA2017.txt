( C ) Summary . 
As a result of the 90-day extension announced on June 30 , 2004 for review of [LOC Brazil  ] 's trade benefits under the [ORG Generalized System  ] of Preferences ( [ORG GSP  ] ) , a bilateral [ORG IPR Working Group  ] held its inaugural session on August 5 in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] to discuss [ORG IPR  ] enforcement issues . 
The [ORG WG  ] was formed as part of the existing [MISC U.S.-Brazil Bilateral Consultative Mechanism  ] ( [ORG BCM  ] ) with the aim of identifying concrete steps the [MISC GoB  ] is undertaking to improve enforcement of copyright laws and combat piracy . 
Not unexpectedly , the [MISC GoB  ] offered no concrete commitments on new actions during this initial meeting . 
However , despite some push-back , the atmospherics for the meeting were generally positive and the tone of the discussion was constructive . 
The next [ORG WG  ] session will take place in [LOC Washington DC  ] the week of September 6 and will focus on producing a report , which will be presented later in the month to DUSTR [PER Peter Allgeier  ] and to U/S [PER Clodoaldo Hugueney  ] , as joint chairs of the [ORG BCM  ] process . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG GSP Committee  ] will review the [ORG WG  ] 's report as it considers further action regarding the [ORG International Intellectual Property Alliance  ] ( [ORG IIPA  ] ) petition to remove [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG GSP  ] benefits . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Within the [LOC United States-Brazil Bilateral Consultative Mechanism  ] process , [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] officials launched a bilateral [ORG Working Group  ] on [ORG IPR  ] enforcement during a five-hour session in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] on August 5 , 2004 . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation was led by [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] rep [PER Antonino Marques Porto  ] e [PER Santos  ] , Chief of the [ORG Department for Scientific and Technological Affairs  ] , who reports directly to [ORG MRE  ] 's Undersecretary for [ORG Economic and Technological Affairs  ] , Ambassador [PER Hugueney  ] . 
[PER Porto  ] was accompanied by [PER Otavio Brandelli  ] and [PER Henrique Choer Moraes  ] - Acting Chief and Advisor in [ORG MRE  ] 's [ORG Intellectual Property Division  ] , respectively ; Ambassador [PER Oswaldo Portella  ] - [ORG International Advisor  ] , [PER Valquiria Souza Teixera de Andrade  ] - Director General of the [ORG Federal Police  ] , and [PER Robson Robin da Silva  ] -Advisor to the [ORG National Secretariat for Public Security  ] from the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ; and [PER Ernani Checcucci  ] - Acting Director General of Customs in the [ORG Ministry of Finance.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Sue Cronin  ] , [ORG USTR  ] Senior Director for [LOC Brazil  ] and the [ORG Southern Cone  ] led the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation , which included [PER Linda Lourie  ] , [LOC Attorney-Advisor  ] , [ORG USPTO Office of International Relations  ] ; [PER David Edwards  ] , [ORG State Brazil  ] desk officer ; [PER Erin McConaha  ] , [ORG Consulate Rio Econoff  ] ; and [PER Janice Fair  ] , Embassy [LOC Brasilia  ] Econoff . 
USG participants for the afternoon session via teleconference were [PER Brian Peck  ] , Senior Director of [ORG Intellectual Property  ] , [ORG USTR  ] ; [PER Leslie Yang  ] , Director for MERCOSUR , [ORG USTR  ] ; [PER Caridad Berdut  ] , [LOC Attorney-Advisor  ] , [ORG USPTO Office of Enforcement  ] ; [PER Mary Rasenberger  ] , [ORG Policy Planning Advisor  ] , [ORG U.S. Copyright Office  ] ; [PER Jennifer Boger  ] , [ORG International Trade Specialist  ] , [ORG Commerce Department  ] ; and [PER Meg Ward  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] desk officer , [ORG Commerce Department.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG WG  ] on [ORG IPR  ] enforcement was formed as a result of discussions between DUSTR [PER Peter Allgeier  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Roberto Abdenur  ] , following [ORG USTR  ] 's announcement on June 30 , 2004 that the USG 's review of [LOC Brazil  ] 's continuing benefits under the [ORG Generalized System  ] of Preferences ( [ORG GSP  ] ) trade program had been extended by 90 days ( until September 30 ) . 
The review was prompted by a petition submitted in 2001 in which the [ORG IIPA  ] requested that [ORG GSP  ] benefits for [MISC Brazilian  ] products be removed on grounds the [MISC Brazilian  ] government does not provide adequate copyright protection . 
While providing a bilateral forum for discussion of [ORG IPR  ] enforcement issues in general , the [ORG WG  ] has as a specific objective the development of a report on the [MISC GoB  ] 's recent actions and work plan for improving the enforcement of copyright protection and combating piracy . 
This information will feed into [ORG GSP Committee  ] deliberations as it decides what action to take regarding the [ORG IIPA  ] petition. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Not surprisingly , no [MISC GoB  ] commitments emerged from this initial meeting . 
However , despite a pro-forma reiteration of the [MISC Brazilian  ] view that it is inappropriate to address [ORG IPR  ] enforcement under the [ORG GSP  ] program , the tone of the meeting was generally constructive , with [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors professing a sincere interest in resolving the [MISC GSP/IPR  ] issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In his opening remarks , Minister [PER Porto  ] cautioned against misrepresentations that imply the [MISC GoB  ] has done little in ( " lacks " ) [ORG IPR  ] enforcement . 
He emphasized that the [ORG WG  ] should work constructively to avoid negative repercussions in the otherwise broad and rich bilateral relationship . 
To deflect the focus from being solely on [MISC GoB  ] actions , [PER Porto  ] was also keen throughout the meeting to frame the discussion as a bilateral exchange and to emphasize that effective [ORG IPR  ] enforcement cannot be attained by [LOC Brazil  ] alone , but requires international cooperation. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) To ensure the [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors understood the seriousness of the situation , [PER Cronin  ] drew attention to the real risk posed by the [ORG GSP  ] review by noting the past withdrawal of [ORG GSP  ] benefits from [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Honduras  ] on [ORG IPR  ] grounds . 
[PER Cronin  ] stressed the USG preference to avoid such an outcome through a productive [ORG WG  ] process . 
[PER Cronin  ] also took pains to make clear that although the [ORG WG  ] is a bilateral forum , the [ORG WG  ] is charged with producing a report that identifies [MISC GoB  ] , not USG , actions to improve copyright enforcement ; the issue is piracy of [LOC U.S.  ] products in the [MISC Brazilian  ] market , not piracy of [MISC Brazilian  ] products in the [LOC U.S.  ] market. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Regarding possible [MISC GoB  ] actions , [PER Porto  ] stressed that the [ORG WG  ] process itself is important and that [LOC Brazil  ] won't accept guidelines imposed from abroad . 
[PER Porto  ] and his team said the [MISC Brazilian  ] executive branch is analyzing the recommendations contained in the June 23 report of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies' Parliamentary Investigative Commission  ] ( [ORG CPI  ] ) on Piracy and [PER Tax Evasion  ] , but it was not yet possible to identify those measures that will be implemented . 
They stressed the complexity of certain recommendations , particularly those involving different branches of the government , and cautioned that the [ORG CPI  ] report is not a cake recipe in which once the recommendations are implemented piracy is eliminated . 
[PER Cronin  ] suggested the [ORG CPI  ] recommendations be viewed more as a menu offering good suggestions on meaningful actions the [MISC GoB  ] can undertake to combat piracy. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Porto  ] and his delegation gave extensive reports on current [MISC GoB  ] enforcement efforts including those of the [ORG Federal Police  ] , Customs , and of the [ORG Secretariat of Public Security  ] . 
Some of the more interesting points included: - Admission that the [ORG Inter-ministerial Committee  ] on Piracy had not performed adequately and an indication the [MISC GoB  ] is looking at its reformulation , including possible inclusion of private-sector representatives and a more direct role with law enforcement activities. - Existence of [ORG Mercosul Agreement  ] #5 in 2003 to enhance regional security by strengthening intelligence exchange on piracy activities and [ORG GoB  ] plans to press for increased joint action in the [ORG Southern Cone  ] during [LOC Brazil  ] 's tenure as [ORG Mercosul  ] president pro tempore . 
Specifically , copyright violation will be a central topic of [ORG Interior Ministers  ] ( [ORG Mercosul  ] plus Associate members ) during a meeting this semester. - Existence of a [ORG Unified Public Security System  ] ( [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ) for integrating and standardizing crime information as a means of improving public security ( covers all types of crime ) . - With regard to a [ORG CPI  ] recommendation for increasing copyright infringement penalties , [PER Porto  ] noted that changes to [LOC Brazil  ] 's penal code in 2003 already increased the minimum sentence from one to two years ( Note: the increase in penalties does not apply to software piracy ) . - Seemingly high level of coordination with other government agencies by [LOC Brazil  ] 's Customs to combat smuggling at ports , airports , and along the frontier . 
Customs uses an integrated system of a trade database and intelligence information to determine inspections based on risk factor . 
To deter transshipment of pirated products or their base materials , Customs inspects all shipments of " sensitive " products - included virgin [ORG CDs  ] since 2000 ; list was expanded this year to now include all shipments of [ORG CDs  ] . 
Customs is also considering banning the transshipment of [ORG CDs  ] and blank CD-ROMs ( presumably to [LOC Paraguay  ] ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] officials on conference call from [LOC Washington  ] provided an overview of [LOC U.S.  ] procedures to combat piracy , in particular , [LOC U.S.  ] Customs' ability as a competent authority to determine infringement and dispose of merchandise without judicial action. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In speaking with [PER Porto  ] after the formal close of the meeting , [PER Cronin  ] emphasized the need for the [ORG WG  ] to show real results , and explained that the [ORG WG  ] report will be considered by the [ORG GSP Committee  ] in making its final decision on the 90-day [ORG GSP  ] review . 
[PER Cronin  ] also noted that the role of the judicial system had not been discussed and encouraged the [MISC GoB  ] to consider possible action in this area to further deter piracy. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The next [ORG WG  ] meeting will take place in [LOC Washington  ] DC. the week of September 6 , specific date to be determined , and will focus on producing a report . 
Working Group officials will present their report later in September to DUSTR [PER Peter Allgeier  ] and to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's Under Secretary for Economic and [ORG Technological Affairs  ] , [PER Clodoaldo Hugueney  ] , joint chairs of the [ORG BCM  ] , at a venue to be determined . 
Comment <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Considering the [MISC GoB  ] 's normal sensitivity regarding [ORG IPR  ] issues , the frank and serious exchange of this meeting is noteworthy . 
While [PER Porto  ] displayed some prickliness out of concern that the shorthand reference to " [LOC Brazil  ] 's lack of enforcement " evokes the misperception that [LOC Brazil  ] in no way provides [ORG IPR  ] protection , he refrained from using " lack of resources " and legalistic arguments ( recent [MISC WTO  ] case on [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG GSP  ] program ) to avoid entirely a discussion of the [MISC GSP/IPR  ] enforcement problem . 
This in part may reflect the less antagonistic attitude of Ambassador [PER Hugueney  ] , with whom [ORG USTR  ] works closely on [MISC WTO  ] issues , compared to those of his other [MISC MRE  ] counterparts . 
The timing may also be propitious , as the fanfare surrounding the [ORG CPI  ] report already creates pressure within [LOC Brazil  ] to improve [ORG IPR  ] protection , so that subsequent [MISC GoB  ] enactment of new measures need not be linked to USG pressure . 
These next weeks may clarify [MISC GoB  ] intentions as the [ORG CPI  ] formally wraps up on August 11 . 
The [MISC GoB  ] will likely give serious and careful consideration to [ORG CPI  ] recommendations in an effort to calibrate its response to the USG , searching for sufficient action to avoid losing [ORG GSP  ] benefits . 
It is impossible to know at this juncture if the [MISC GoB  ] is prepared to do what is necessary . 
The devil will be in the details when the [ORG WG  ] next meets and the discussion turns to the specifics of the report. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) This cable was cleared by [ORG USTR  ] and coordinated with Consulate Rio .
