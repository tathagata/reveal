( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
[LOC Israel  ] is deceptively calm and prosperous . 
The security situation inside [LOC Israel  ] is the best since the outbreak of the Second [MISC Intifada  ] , the economy has weathered the storms of the international economic crisis , and [PER Netanyahu  ] 's governing coalition is stable , for the time being at least . 
Yet outside the storm is gathering and [MISC Israelis  ] of many different political outlooks agree on the need to seize the initiative , even while they disagree about what exactly should be done . 
[MISC Israelis  ] see [LOC Iran  ] as the primary regional threat , both due to its nuclear program and its projection of power directly into [LOC Gaza  ] and southern [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] navy 's seizure of a ship loaded with a huge shipment of [MISC Iranian  ] arms November 3 has provided tangible proof of [LOC Iran  ] 's involvement in arming [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[MISC Syrian  ] intentions are also a source of concern , as [MISC Israeli  ] analysts see Asad moving closer to [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] even as [LOC Syria  ] improves its relations with the [LOC West  ] . 
The sharp decline in [LOC Israel  ] 's long- standing strategic relationship with [LOC Turkey  ] is adding a new element of instability into the picture . 
Prime Minister [PER Erdogan  ] 's rhetorical support for [PER Ahmedinejad  ] and his dismissal of the threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program is feeding the sense here of impending crisis , although the robust [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] security relationship is profoundly reassuring to [MISC Israeli  ] security officials and the general public alike . 
Finally , the failure to re-launch [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] negotiations and the political crisis in the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] is deeply disturbing to [MISC Israelis  ] who still believe in a two-state solution . 
Even GOI skeptics are worried that the lack of a political dialogue and talk of a collapse of the [ORG PA  ] are undermining the bottom-up approach they advocate as the alternative to a final-status agreement . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] insists that he is ready to start negotiations immediately without preconditions , but he will not negotiate on the basis of former PM [PER Olmert  ] 's offer of a year ago . 
The opposition [ORG Kadima Party  ] 's number two , former IDF Chief of Staff and former Minister of Defense [PER Shaul Mofaz  ] , has generated considerable attention with a new peace plan that is based on offering the [MISC Palestinians  ] a state with temporary borders in the next year or two , to be followed by intensive final status negotiations . 
Few here believe the [MISC Palestinians  ] will accept this idea , but it may serve to push [PER Netanyahu  ] toward offering a peace initiative of his own . 
End Summary . 
Calm Before the [LOC Storm ?  ] ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Israel  ] in the fall of 2009 is deceptively calm on the surface . 
[MISC Israelis  ] are enjoying the best security situation since the outbreak of the Second [MISC Intifada  ] , the result of [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence successes in destroying the suicide bombing network in the [LOC West Bank  ] as well as good security cooperation with the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] 's security forces . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] economy has successfully weathered the world economic crisis , with only a slight uptick in unemployment and no major impact on the financial system . 
PM [PER Netanyahu  ] 's center-right coalition is stable , and faces no significant challenge from the opposition [ORG Kadima Party  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] personally enjoys approval ratings over sixty percent , and appears to have benefited politically from the media obsession with reports of frictions with the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] so far has managed the more right wing elements of [MISC Likud  ] and other rightist elements in the coalition , although tensions with the far right are likely to reemerge over peace process issues , including a temporary settlement freeze or a decision to make good on [ORG Barak  ] 's pledges to evacuate illegal outposts . 
There are signs of a growing split within the [ORG Labor Party  ] , and Foreign Minister [PER Lieberman  ] continues to face the strong possibility of several criminal indictments for money laundering and obstruction of justice , but none of this threatens the stability of the coalition , at least not yet . 
The latest polls indicate that [MISC Likud  ] would gain three seats if elections were held now . 
And Looming Threats ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite this good news for the government , [MISC Israelis  ] are even more anxious than normal these days . 
Sixty-one years after the establishment of the State of [LOC Israel  ] , [MISC Israelis  ] sense a growing tide in the world challenging not just the occupation of territory seized in 1967 , but even against the existence of the [MISC Jewish  ] state within any borders . 
The GOI 's alarm and outrage over the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] was based on their view that the report represented an attempt to deny [LOC Israel  ] the right to react military to terrorist threats . 
[ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002473 002 OF 004 Security is indeed good and [LOC Israel  ] 's borders are generally the quietest they have been in years , but it is common knowledge that [ORG Hamas  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] both now possess rockets capable of hitting the greater [ORG Tel Aviv  ] area , [LOC Israel  ] 's main population and economic center . 
When discussing [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , sophisticated [MISC Israeli  ] interlocutors note that the issue is not just whether a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] would launch nuclear-tipped missiles at [LOC Israel  ] - although that possibility cannot be dismissed - but rather the regional nuclear arms race that would ensue and the impact of the resulting uncertainty on [MISC Israeli  ] elites and foreign investors alike . 
[LOC Israel  ] 's remarkable high-tech economy is a great achievement , but it also makes [LOC Israel  ] exceptionally vulnerable to a host of private decisions to live and invest elsewhere . 
Growing alienation among [LOC Israel  ] 's twenty-percent [MISC Arab  ] minority and the increasing domination of [MISC Israeli  ] [MISC Arab  ] politics by an elite that identifies with [MISC Palestinian  ] nationalism further complicates [LOC Israel  ] 's internal scene. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Painstakingly constructed relations with [LOC Israel  ] 's neighbors are also fraying . 
Even optimists about relations with [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] admit that [LOC Israel  ] enjoys peace with both regimes , but not with their people . 
The transformation of [PER Michel Aoun  ] into [ORG Hizballah  ] 's primary [MISC Lebanese  ] ally may be the final nail in the coffin of [LOC Israel  ] 's decades-old relations with [LOC Lebanon  ] 's [MISC Maronite Christians  ] . 
Finally , [MISC Israelis  ] are deeply alarmed by the direction of [MISC Turkish  ] foreign policy , and see [PER Erdogan  ] and [PER Davutoglu  ] as punishing [LOC Israel  ] for the [ORG EU  ] 's rejection of [LOC Turkey  ] while driving [LOC Israel  ] 's erstwhile strategic ally into an alternative strategic partnership with [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Gaza  ] Dilemmas ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Gaza  ] poses its own set of dilemmas . 
The IDF general responsible for [LOC Gaza  ] and southern [LOC Israel  ] , Major General [PER Yoav Galant  ] , recently commented to us that [LOC Israel  ] 's political leadership has not yet made the necessary policy choices among competing priorities: a short-term priority of wanting [ORG Hamas  ] to be strong enough to enforce the de facto ceasefire and prevent the firing of rockets and mortars into [LOC Israel  ] ; a medium-priority of preventing [ORG Hamas  ] from consolidating its hold on [LOC Gaza  ] ; and a longer-term priority of avoiding a return of [MISC Israeli  ] control of [LOC Gaza  ] and full responsibility for the well-being of [LOC Gaza  ] 's civilian population . 
[LOC Israel  ] appears determined to maintain its current policy of allowing only humanitarian supplies and limited commercial goods into [LOC Gaza  ] , while sealing the borders into [LOC Israel  ] . 
There are indications of progress in the indirect negotiations with [ORG Hamas  ] over the release of [PER Gilad Shalit  ] in return for the release of hundreds of [MISC Palestinian  ] prisoners , many of them hardened terrorists , but it is difficult to predict the timing of such a deal . 
[PER Shalit  ] 's release would likely result in a more lenient [MISC Israeli  ] policy toward the [LOC Gaza  ] crossings , but a large prisoner exchange would be played by [ORG Hamas  ] as a major political achievement and thus further damage the standing of [PER Abu Mazen  ] among [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
Security Cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] Reassuring --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Especially given the sense of growing threats from all directions , [MISC Israelis  ] from the Prime Minister on down to the average citizen are deeply appreciative of the strong security and mil-mil cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] The [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] security relationship remains strong , as indicated by the joint [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] missile defense exercise Juniper Cobra 10 in which over 1,400 [MISC American  ] personnel tested [LOC Israel  ] 's defense - and [LOC U.S.  ] support thereof - against ballistic missile threats in the region . 
The [LOC United States  ] remains committed to [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) , and has taken a number of steps to alleviate [MISC Israeli  ] concerns over some potential [LOC U.S  ] arms sales to the region , including the creation of four new [ORG QME  ] working groups to further discuss these arms transfers . 
These working groups will soon begin deliberations , focusing on previous arms transfer agreements , mitigation measures for the planned [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC F-15  ] sale to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , technical mitigation issues , and intelligence policy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Israel  ] may not agree on some [LOC U.S.  ] arms transfers to the region , these [ORG QME  ] working groups will ensure a transparent process so that [LOC Israel  ] is not surprised by any [LOC U.S.  ] potential transfer . 
As it does in assessing all threats , [LOC Israel  ] approaches potential [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales from a " worst case scenario " perspective in which current moderate [MISC Arab  ] nations ( [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002473 003 OF 004 [LOC Jordan  ] ) in the region could potentially fall victim to regime change and resume hostilities against [LOC Israel  ] . 
It is primarily for this reason that [LOC Israel  ] continues to raise concerns regarding the [MISC F-15  ] sale to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , especially if the aircraft are based at [LOC Tabuk  ] airfield near the [MISC Israeli  ] border . 
We have deflected [MISC Israeli  ] requests for additional information regarding the [MISC F-15  ] sale until we receive an official Letter of Request ( LOR ) from [LOC Saudi Arabia.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Finally , an argument can be made that [LOC Israel  ] has continued to raise concerns over the [MISC F-15  ] sale as leverage in its attempts to modify its purchase of the [ORG F-35 Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) . 
[LOC Israel  ] remains highly committed to the [ORG JSF  ] as a successor to its aging [MISC F-16  ] fleet , although budgetary considerations have raised some doubts how [LOC Israel  ] will be able to afford it . 
Nevertheless , [LOC Israel  ] continues to press for the inclusion of an [MISC Israeli-made  ] electronic warfare ( [ORG EW  ] ) suite , indigenous maintenance capacity , and a lower cost per aircraft into its [ORG JSF  ] purchase plans , and has repeatedly raised these issues with [ORG SecDef  ] . 
Impasse with the [MISC Palestinians  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Polls show that close to seventy percent of [MISC Israeli  ] Jews support a two-state solution , but a similar percentage do not believe that a final status agreement can be reached with the [MISC Palestinian  ] leadership . 
Expressed another way , [MISC Israelis  ] of varying political views tell us that after [PER Abu Mazen  ] spurned [PER Ehud Olmert  ] 's peace offer one year ago , it became clearer than ever that there is too wide a gap between the maximum offer any [MISC Israeli  ] prime minister could make and the minimum terms any [MISC Palestinian  ] leader could accept and survive . 
Sixteen years after [LOC Oslo  ] and the [ORG Declaration of Principles  ] , there is a widespread conviction here that neither final status negotiations nor unilateral disengagements have worked . 
While some on the left conclude that the only hope is a [MISC U.S.-imposed  ] settlement , a more widely held narrative holds that the [LOC Oslo  ] arrangements collapsed in the violence of the Second Intifada after [PER Arafat  ] rejected [PER Barak  ] 's offer at [LOC Camp David  ] , while [ORG Sharon  ] 's unilateral disengagement from [LOC Gaza  ] resulted in the [ORG Hamas  ] takeover and a rain of rockets on southern [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] effectively captured the public mood with his [ORG Bar Ilan University  ] speech last June , in which he expressed support for a two-state solution , but only if the [MISC Plestinian  ] leadership would accept [LOC Israel  ] as the ation-state of the [MISC Jewish  ] people and the [MISC Palestiian  ] state would be demilitarized ( and subject toa number of other security-related restrictions o its sovereignty that he did not spell out in deail in the speech but which are well known in [LOC Wahington  ] ) . 
[MISC Palestinian  ] PM Fayyad has recently temed [PER Netanyahu  ] 's goal a " [PER Mickey Mouse  ] state " due to all the limitations on [MISC Palestinian  ] sovereignty that it would appear to entail. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's stated intent not to seek another term is widely seen here as an effort to put pressure on [LOC Washington  ] to put pressure on [LOC Israel  ] to meet [MISC Palestinian  ] terms for starting negotiations . 
[PER Abu Mazen  ] 's statements have likely reinforced his image among [MISC Israelis  ] as a decent man , and certainly a different breed from [PER Arafat  ] , but a weak and unreliable leader . 
Yet even some of the [MISC Israeli  ] officials , including [PER Avigdor Lieberman  ] and [PER Sylvan Shalom  ] , who have been most skeptical about the prospects for a final status agreement in the near term , are now expressing concern at the lack of engagement with the [ORG PA  ] and the prospects of the [ORG PA  ] collapsing . 
Advocates of a bottom-up approach are finally realizing that without a political process , the security cooperation and economic development approach will become unsustainable . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] has told us that he considers [PER Abu Mazen  ] to be his negotiating partner , and in his latest public statements has stressed that he is not interested in negotiations for their own sake , but rather seeks a far-reaching agreement with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , but it remains unclear to us how far [PER Netanyahu  ] is prepared to go . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] is interested in taking steps to strengthen [PER Abu Mazen  ] , but he will not agree to the total freeze on [MISC Israeli  ] construction in the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC East Jerusalem  ] that [PER Abu Mazen  ] insists is a requirement for engaging with [PER Netanyahu  ] . 
[MISC Israeli  ] Choices --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Former Defense Minister and former IDF Chief of Staff [PER Shaul Mofaz  ] generated a lot of media attention this week when he announced a peace plan that calls for establishing a [MISC Palestinian  ] state with temporary borders on sixty percent of the [LOC West Bank  ] , then entering final status negotiations . 
[ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002473 004 OF 004 Mofaz' approach is similar to ideas that have been floated quietly over the past few months by Defense Minister [PER Barak  ] and President [PER Peres  ] , and [PER Mofaz  ] claims that both [PER Barak  ] and [PER Peres  ] support his plan . 
Mofaz' plan is in part an effort to undermine the political position of his rival for [ORG Kadima  ] party leadership , former Foreign Minister [PER Tzipi Livni  ] . 
[PER Livni  ] , presumably drawing on her experience negotiating with the [MISC Palestinians  ] during the [PER Olmert  ] government , says she opposes the idea of an interim solution , but instead supports intensive final status negotiations , perhaps this time with direct [LOC U.S.  ] involvement . 
[PER Livni  ] and [PER Mofaz  ] both stress that they are motivated by a sense of urgency and that time is not on [LOC Israel  ] 's side. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] still holds the political cards here , however , and we see no scenarios in which [PER Livni  ] or [PER Mofaz  ] become prime minister in the near future . 
As [PER Mofaz  ] told the Ambassador earlier this week , [PER Netanyahu  ] may wait until the [MISC Palestinian  ] elections , if they are in fact held in January , but the initiative is in his hands . 
If the [MISC Palestinians  ] continue to refuse to engage on terms that [PER Netanyahu  ] can accept , it is possible that [PER Netanyahu  ] could turn his attention to [LOC Syria  ] . 
Media reports that [PER Netanyahu  ] asked President [PER Sarkozy  ] to deliver a message to [MISC Asad  ] may turn out to be accurate , but as with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] will not resume talks with [LOC Syria  ] where they left off under [PER Olmert  ] , but will insist on negotiations without preconditions .
