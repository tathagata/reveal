( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] In a January 21 meeting , [MISC Brazilian  ] Presidential Senior Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that the GOB is very optimistic about relations with the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
He stressed that President [PER Lula  ] is eager to meet President [PER Obama  ] . 
Energy , climate change , and addressing the regional effects of the economic crisis are all potential areas for [MISC Brazil-U.S.  ] cooperation in [PER Garcia  ] 's view , but trade is not . 
Describing [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [ORG Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] as " complicated , " he cautioned that good regional relations would depend on a more collaborative style from the USG and , in particular , on an opening by the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] toward [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] thought energy would be the most promising area for cooperation at the upcoming [MISC Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] . 
He dismissed the [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [ORG OAS  ] ) as largely irrelevant to solving the region 's problems . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] opened by saying how pleased he was that both Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] and [ORG WHA A/S  ] [PER Tom Shannon  ] are staying on . 
" This ensures good relations with the [LOC United States  ] , " he said , adding that relations had been excellent with the previous [ORG U.S. Administration  ] because President [PER Lula  ] and President [PER Bush  ] " knew how to respect each other even when they disagreed . 
" Relations with the [LOC United States  ] , he said , " are fundamental " for [LOC Brazil  ] , and the GOB wants to maintain and increase the good relations built during the [ORG Bush Administration  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] is not always the most diplomatic in the way he speaks , he said , but he has a great fondness for President [PER Obama  ] , and this has been enhanced by his sense that President [PER Obama  ] 's views toward collective security , multilateralism , and the ways to address the economic crisis " coincide with ours . 
" Although personal relations with President [PER Bush  ] were always " warm and personal , " [PER Lula  ] is now " very optimistic . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked where [PER Garcia  ] saw possibilities for cooperation , particularly with the [MISC Summit of the Americas  ] coming up in April . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that energy is a natural basis for cooperation and should be deepened . 
He also said that [PER Lula  ] is committed to helping the smaller and poorer countries of the region withstand the economic downturn , explaining that they are especially vulnerable because they are dependent on the [LOC U.S.  ] economy , [LOC U.S.  ] remittances , or oil ( which , he added , is the key to [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] 's success ) . 
He suggested that one possibility for cooperation in this area would be to expand our " triangular " cooperation on biofuels , in which the [LOC United States  ] provides capital , [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] provide technical expertise , and recipient countries provide the labor and land to develop their own biofuel production . 
On climate change , [PER Garcia  ] said that an early discussion between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] " could change the world . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On the political side , [PER Garcia  ] began , " the two presidents will need to speak frankly . 
" Relations between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] are not easy , he said , and are as complicated with [LOC U.S.  ] friends in the region as they are with those countries hostile to the [LOC United States  ] . 
With regard to complications with [LOC U.S.  ] friends , [PER Garcia  ] mentioned [LOC Colombia  ] with a knowing nod , but without providing any details . 
( Note: GOB officials are cultivating relations with [LOC Colombia  ] in advance of an upcoming visit by President [PER Uribe  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
End note . 
) He then cited [LOC Mexico  ] , highlighting the surprise announcement made by President [PER Calderon  ] at the December summit of [MISC Latin American  ] and [LOC Caribbean  ] countries in [LOC Bahia  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , at which [PER Calderon  ] [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000095 002 OF 003 proposed a [ORG LAC  ] regional organization ( reftels A , C ) . 
On the " hostile " side , [PER Garcia  ] said that [LOC Bolivia  ] 's [PER Morales  ] wants to " re-establish " relations with the [LOC United States  ] after the January 25 referendum , and that [LOC Brazil  ] wants to help him do that . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] 's [PER Chavez  ] , likewise , will be ready to engage after the February 15 vote . 
" Until then , " he counseled , " silence is best " on the part of the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) With regard to cooperation specifically aimed at the [LOC Summit of the Americas  ] , [PER Garcia  ] cautioned that [LOC Brazil  ] " can't appear to be a country that wants to be the leader in the region . 
" ( Comment: This is an odd assertion in the wake of the [LOC Bahia  ] summits ( reftels ) , which have been widely interpreted as a not so subtle attempt to do just that . 
End comment . 
) [PER Garcia  ] thought energy held out the greatest hope as an issue around which the hemisphere could agree , but added that it will be difficult because each country faces different conditions and problems . 
The most important thing for the [LOC United States  ] , he said , will be to change the method and approach of engagement with the region , toward a more collaborative and consultative style. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about the possibility of addressing trade at a regional level . 
[PER Garcia  ] responded that it is hard to ponder trade issues outside of [LOC Doha  ] , as other initiatives all have serious problems . 
The Ambassador asked about trade facilitation measures . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that if the [LOC United States  ] had proposals , the region would listen , but was clearly doubtful ; he lamented that the last effort to conclude [LOC Doha  ] had failed , and expressed frustration that , in the view of the GOB , the [LOC United States  ] had thrown up the final road blocks. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Noting that [LOC Brazil  ] is taking on the rotating presidency of the [ORG OAS  ] , the Ambassador asked how [PER Garcia  ] viewed the possibility for initiatives in that forum and prospects for its renewal . 
[PER Garcia  ] responded that the there is " enormous doubt " in the region about the possibilities for having a real " hemispheric policy . 
" The relations are always asymmetric , he said , adding that , " When I was young , the [ORG OAS  ] was known as the 'Ministry of [LOC U.S.  ] Colonies , ' " although , he conceded , " this has changed a little bit . 
" [PER Garcia  ] said that the [ORG OAS  ] has proved ineffective in addressing regional crises , citing the [MISC Ecuador-Colombia  ] dispute and [LOC Bolivia  ] 's internal crisis which , he said , had been resolved outside the [ORG OAS  ] , by a few [MISC South American  ] countries and by [ORG UNASUL  ] , respectively . 
( When the Ambassador noted that the [LOC United States  ] had purposefully not inserted itself in these instances , [PER Garcia  ] remarked that " some of our best soccer players are those who can contribute to the team without ever touching the ball . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] will continue to participate in the [ORG OAS  ] , [PER Garcia  ] said . 
But , citing [MISC American  ] " 25th hour " support for [PER SYG Insulza  ] as an error , he stressed that change in the [ORG OAS  ] will depend on a change in [LOC U.S.  ] policy toward the region , and toward [LOC Cuba  ] in particular. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked how central discussion of [LOC Cuba  ] would be , in [PER Garcia  ] 's view , to establishing relations with the region . 
" You can't talk about [LOC Latin America  ] , " he responded , " without talking about [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" It has become a " sign " for the region . 
[PER Garcia  ] urged a " strong " [LOC U.S.  ] overture to [LOC Cuba  ] " without conditions , " such as removing the embargo . 
It would be , he said , a small price to pay for a large gain . 
On the one hand , he said , the [MISC Cubans  ] would be astounded and embarrassed , and the [LOC United States  ] would gain the moral high ground . 
On the other , he stressed that , on the basis of his long relationship with [LOC Cuba  ] and knowledge of [MISC Cuban  ] history , he was certain the [MISC Cubans  ] would never agree to a proposal that had explicit conditions attached . 
The Ambassador asked if [PER Raul Castro  ] 's proposal for a prisoner exchange , made during his December 18 visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] , was the [MISC Cubans'  ] own idea . 
[PER Garcia  ] said his impression was that it was [PER Raul  ] 's idea , that is was spontaneous and had not been vetted in [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000095 003 OF 003 [LOC Havana  ] . 
" [PER Raul  ] is a military man , " [PER Garcia  ] said . 
" He understands the correlation of forces . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised difficulties that had just cropped up getting [MISC Brazilian  ] visas for [ORG DEA  ] agents in [LOC Bolivia  ] to move from [LOC La Paz  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] ( see septel ) . 
[PER Garcia  ] knew nothing of the issue , but used it to make a " general comment " regarding [LOC U.S.  ] policy in the region . 
The [LOC United States  ] , he said , has a longstanding resistance to foreign and multilateral interference in its policies . 
For example , President [PER Bush  ] had told [PER Garcia  ] how difficult it was for the United States--and not just the [PER Bush  ] Administration--to deal with the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
This creates difficulties for both the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , because it limits the way cooperation can take place . 
There are many areas where we all share interests . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] wants to stem the drug problem because if they don't , cartels will threaten [PER Morales  ] ( just look at the problems [LOC Mexico  ] is having , he added ) . 
But " there are ways and there are ways , " he said , suggesting that [ORG DEA  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] more broadly , are too heavy-handed and need to be more consultative in our approach . 
" I 'm not a diplomat , though " he joked , " just an old leftist who has been placed at the President 's side . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As the meeting ended , [PER Garcia  ] made a point of saying that President [PER Lula  ] is greatly interested in meeting President [PER Obama  ] as soon as possible , whether at the bilateral CEO Forum in [LOC New York  ] in March , the [MISC G-20  ] meeting in [LOC London  ] in April , or the mid-April Summit of the [ORG Americas  ] . 
President [PER Obama  ] would be welcome in [LOC Brazil  ] , a visit which would be seen as " a great success and signal " for the region. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Garcia  ] , who is [PER Lula  ] 's closest foreign policy advisor , was remarkably frank and expansive in this discussion , sensing perhaps an opportunity to have an early influence on the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] is no friend of the [LOC United States  ] or [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy ; [PER Lula  ] 's emphasis on [MISC South-South  ] relations over those with the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] is largely his brainchild . 
But unlike some other senior GOB officials , [PER Garcia  ] has adopted [PER Lula  ] 's pragmatic approach to foreign policy . 
He values the close relationship [LOC Brazil  ] has cultivated with the [LOC United States  ] and enjoys comparing notes and working collaboratively with us on regional issues , which are generally his domain . 
[PER Garcia  ] 's care to note [PER Lula  ] 's affinity for President [PER Obama  ] and his interest in an early meeting echoes similar statements by [PER Lula  ] 's chief of staff , [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] , [ORG Strategic Planning Minister  ] [PER Roberto Mangabeira Unger  ] , and other senior GOB officials . 
At the same time , in a regional context , GOB officials including [PER Garcia  ] continue to view relations with the [LOC United States  ] through a " spheres of influence " prism . 
This makes them wary of working through the [ORG OAS  ] or the [ORG SOA  ] , and will likely make it challenging to work with them in defining concrete proposals for the hemisphere .
