( C/NF ) Summary: [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) renegotiated the terms of its production sharing agreements with [LOC France  ] 's Total and its partners in [LOC Libya  ] ( [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG Wintershall  ] and [LOC Norway  ] 's [ORG StatoilHydro  ] ) , adjusting the existing stand-alone contracts to bring them into compliance with the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) rubric . 
The renegotiation of Total 's contract is of a piece with the [ORG NOC  ] 's effort to renegotiate existing contracts to increase the [LOC Libya  ] 's share of crude oil production . 
An interesting corollary is that one of the affected fields is that from which [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , a son of [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , periodically obtains oil lifts , which he sells to finance his various activities . 
Depending on whether his lifts had been coming out of the [ORG NOC  ] 's production share or Total 's ( it 's not clear what the arrangement was ) , the renegotiated agreements could adversely impact his revenue stream . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG NOC  ] had already renegotiated its agreements with other international oil companies ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) producing in [LOC Libya  ] to align those contracts with the [MISC EPSA-IV  ] framework . 
Under [MISC EPSA-IV  ] terms , [ORG IOCs  ] commit to upfront signing bonuses to the [ORG NOC  ] , a lower share of produced oil and gas , technology transfers , training of local employees and investment to re-develop existing fields . 
[LOC Italy  ] 's [LOC Eni  ] , [LOC Canada  ] 's [ORG Petro-Canada  ] , a [MISC European  ] consortium headed by [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Repsol  ] , and a consortium headed by [ORG U.S. Occidental  ] ( " Oxy " ) signed renegotiated agreements under similar terms with the [ORG NOC  ] in June-July 2008 . 
Those companies cumulatively paid the [ORG NOC  ] [MISC USD  ] 5.4 billion in upfront bonus payments as part of the renegotiation process . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The renegotiated Total agreements cover production at the [LOC Mabruk  ] field ( jointly operated by Total and [ORG StatoilHydro  ] ) and the al-Jurf field ( jointly operated by Total and [ORG Wintershall  ] ) . 
Under the new agreement , the [MISC Total-Statoil  ] and [MISC Total-Wintershall  ] consortiums will pay a signing bonus of [MISC USD  ] 500 million to the [ORG NOC  ] - [MISC USD  ] 200 million at the signing and the remaining [MISC USD  ] 300 million when the viability of gas exploitation in al-Jurf field is confirmed . 
The consortiums also committed to develop more robust training programs for local employees . 
Exploration and development costs associated with increasing production capacity of the [LOC Mabruk  ] and al-Jurf fields will be shared equally by the [ORG NOC  ] and the consortiums . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Each consortium will take 27 percent of oil production , down from the 50 percent take they had under the previous agreement . 
For gas , the consortium will take a 40 percent share ( down from 50 percent ) , which will be reduced in the future to 30 percent . 
For the [LOC Mabruk  ] field , which is located in the Sirte basin and produces some 20,000 barrels of oil per day , the new production share is 73 percent for the [ORG NOC  ] , 20.25 percent for Total and 6.75 percent for [ORG StatoilHydro  ] . 
The contract 's expiration date has been extended from 2027 to 2032 . 
For the offshore al-Jurf field , which produces 45,000 barrels of oil per day , the new share is 73 percent for the [ORG NOC  ] , 20.25 percent for Total and 6.75 percent for [ORG Wintershall  ] . 
Natural gas produced at al-Jurf will be split as follows: 60 percent for the [ORG NOC  ] , 30 percent for Total and 10 percent for [ORG Wintershall  ] . 
The al-Jurf contract has been extended from 2017 to 2032 . 
5 . 
( C/NF ) Comment: The new production share percentage accepted by Total and its partners is still considerably larger than those obtained by other [ORG IOCs  ] in renegotiating their existing contracts . 
It is also larger than the production shares of companies who won contracts in the most recent [MISC EPSA-IV  ] bid rounds . 
The new agreement still guarantees Total , [ORG Wintershall  ] and [ORG StatoilHydro  ] longer access to existing [MISC Libyan  ] reserves and further field development opportunities , with the potential of increasing oil production . 
An interesting potential corollary is that al-Jurf is reportedly the field from which [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , a son of [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , periodically obtains oil lifts , which he sells to finance his various activities . 
It is not clear whether those allotments have come from the production share of the [ORG NOC  ] or Total ( [LOC Saif  ] has strong ties to senior [MISC French  ] business and government figures ) . 
If his take has been coming from Total 's production share , there could be a reduction in the number of lifts he is consigned and a TRIPOLI 00000438 002 OF 002 corresponding decrease in his bank account 's bottom line . 
The timing is particularly bad , coinciding with other recent setbacks for [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam that include the March cabinet shuffle that did not favor his reform efforts , his brother 's successful visit to [LOC Washington  ] ( viewed as a threat to his perceived primacy on the [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] account ) and the recent nationalization of his al-Libia satellite television channel .
