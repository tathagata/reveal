[ORG RIYADH  ] 118 [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000123 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: Ambassador [PER James B. Smith  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) SUMMARY: ---------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister [PER Yang Jiechi  ] met with [PER King Abdullah  ] and [ORG FM Prince Saud  ] Al-Faisal on January 13 , during the last stop of a five nation [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Middle East  ] tour . 
During the visit , [ORG FM Yang  ] discussed deepening [MISC Saudi-Chinese  ] ties in a variety of fields , emphasizing trade , in particular , with his [MISC Saudi  ] counterparts . 
Responding to statements made by [ORG FM Saud  ] , [PER Yang  ] also briefly discussed [MISC Chinese  ] support for [LOC Iraq  ] , concern about [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear ambitions , and hopes for the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
[ORG FM Yang  ] 's foray into regional political commentary appears to have been a result of [ORG FM Saud  ] 's prodding , both publicly and behind closed doors , and is a reflection of the developing [MISC Saudi-Chinese  ] relationship . 
END SUMMARY . 
TRADE TAKES PRECEDENCE ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [ORG FM Yang  ] arrived in [LOC Riyadh  ] on January 13 , the first high-level visit since [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu Jintao  ] 's February 2009 " Trip of Friendship and Cooperation . 
" [ORG FM Yang  ] 's visit coincided with the 20th anniversary of [MISC Saudi-Chinese  ] diplomatic relations , and followed three days after [MISC Chinese  ] Trade Minister [PER Chen Deming  ] co-chaired the 4th session of the [ORG Saudi-Chinese Joint Commission  ] in [LOC Riyadh.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister has traditionally made his first overseas trip of the new year to [LOC Africa  ] , visiting with [MISC African  ] leaders and expressing [MISC Chinese  ] goodwill and improvements in trade relations . 
This year , [ORG FM Yang  ] extended his visit to include not only major trading partners like [LOC Nigeria  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] , but also [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
In a January 13 statement to the press , [ORG FM Yang  ] stressed the importance of strengthening cooperation in " energy , infrastructure , finance and science and technology . 
" He said that both sides should carry out cultural and education exchanges to deepen the bilateral relationship and pressed the need for closer relations between [LOC China  ] and the [MISC GCC.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) These statements echoed similar announcements from [MISC Chinese  ] Trade Minister [PER Chen  ] who , in a January 10 press conference , called for finalizing the [MISC Chinese-GCC  ] free trade agreement and increasing bilateral trade by 50% , from a total annual value of $40 billion to $60 billion , over the next five years ( ref A ) . 
During the [ORG Joint Commission  ] meeting , [MISC Saudi  ] Minister of Finance [PER Ibrahim Al-Assaf  ] reportedly urged the [MISC Chinese  ] to participate in more joint ventures , noting that while bilateral trade increased 25 times over the past ten years , the two countries only have 19 joint projects . 
[PER Al-Assaf  ] also welcomed [LOC China  ] 's 44 billion riyal ( $11.7 billion ) worth of infrastructure projects in the [LOC Kingdom  ] . 
DUMPING CAUSES A BUMP --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) This call to increase [MISC Sino-Saudi  ] trade comes on the heels of a December 24 announcement that [LOC China  ] would impose anti-dumping tariffs of up to 13.6 percent on [MISC Saudi  ] and Taiwan-produced butanediol . 
[LOC Beijing  ] began a dumping probe on methanol and butanediol ( [ORG BDO  ] ) from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in July , which caused an unusually public trade spat between the two countries ( ref B ) . 
Methanol and butanediol make up 10 to 15 percent of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's $2 billion in annual non-oil exports to [LOC China  ] . 
A [ORG Ministry of Commerce and Industry  ] official told Econoffs on January 13 that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was able to convince the [MISC Chinese  ] not to impose tariffs on methanol , but said the [ORG BDO  ] case was still pending . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] recently appointed a new Deputy Minister for [ORG Technical Affairs  ] , Dr. [PER Hamad Al-Awfy  ] , who will handle all anti-dumping issues , he said . 
[PER Al-Awfy  ] previously complained to EconCouns that the [ORG SAG  ] was increasingly frustrated by the growing number of [MISC Saudi  ] companies complaining about [MISC Chinese  ] dumping in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
Other senior [ORG SAG  ] officials have caustically complained about the low quality of [MISC Chinese  ] construction and the " short-term , extractive " approach of [MISC Chinese  ] companies to investments in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[ORG RIYADH  ] 00000123 002.2 OF 003 A MATURING ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP ? --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] recently surpassed the [LOC U.S.  ] as the largest importer of [MISC Saudi  ] oil . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's investments in [LOC China  ] have increased significantly over the last few years , including a $3.5 billion refinery in [LOC Fujian  ] and a $2.86 billion joint-venture petrochemical complex in [LOC Tianjin  ] . 
[LOC Additionaly  ] , President [PER Hu Jintao  ] commemorated the opening of a cement plant when he visited [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in February 2009 . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , s more forward-leaning approach , including large-scale investments in [LOC China  ] , indicates a maturing of the bilateral relations and assumes a more pro-active , rather than reactive , role towards economic engagement . 
( Note: [LOC China  ] is now the [ORG SAG  ] 's number two trade partner after the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Saudi-Chinese  ] bilateral trade was estimated at $40 billion in 2008 , while [MISC Saudi-U.S.  ] trade was estimated at $67 billion during the same time period . 
End note . 
) [ORG FM SAUD  ] PRODS , [ORG FM YANG  ] RESPONDS ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) While trade issues dominated [ORG FM Yang  ] 's agenda , both he and [ORG FM Prince  ] Saud-Al [PER Faisal  ] commented on the regional political landscape in a press conference that followed their bilateral meeting . 
[ORG FM Saud  ] spoke out against [MISC Israeli  ] defiance of [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions and called on [LOC China  ] , as a permanent member of the [ORG Security Council  ] , to " deal with world disputes in accordance to international legitimacy...as stipulated in the [ORG Arab Peace Initiative  ] . 
" The meetings with [ORG FM Yang  ] were " part of a framework of coordination and consultation , " [ORG FM Saud  ] continued , that included not only the [MISC Palestinian  ] cause but also [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear file , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] . 
In particular , he emphasized [LOC China  ] 's role as a member of the [MISC P5  ] plus 1 group and their responsibility " to solve the ( [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear ) crisis through dialogue and peaceful means . 
" Our two nations are keen that the [LOC Middle East  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] should be free of all weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear weapons , " he stressed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) In response to [ORG FM Saud  ] 's comments , [ORG FM Yang  ] said [LOC China  ] called for serious negotiations between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] that would carry out the peace process and establish the [ORG State of Palestine  ] . 
" [LOC China  ] is ready for cooperation with the world community to work for stability in the [LOC Middle East  ] , " he added . 
In regard to [LOC Iraq  ] , he said that [LOC China  ] extended assistance by reducing [MISC Iraqi  ] debt obligations to [LOC China  ] and forging trade agreements between [MISC Iraqi  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] companies . 
With respect to [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG FM Yang  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] file should be solved through " political diplomatic channels which help stabilize the situation in the region . 
" [ORG FM SAUD: CHINA NEEDS  ] TO MORE ACTIVELY COUNTER [MISC IRANIAN  ] NUKES --------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. [PER Prince Torki  ] told visiting [ORG NEA A/S  ] Feltman on January 26 ( ref C ) that [ORG FM Saud  ] had pressed the [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister hard on the need to be more active in working with the rest of the international community and the [ORG UN Security Council  ] to counter the threat of [LOC Iran  ] developing a nuclear weapon . 
[ORG FM Saud  ] told [ORG FM Yang  ] that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was convinced [LOC Iran  ] intended to develop a nuclear weapon , despite its assurances , and that only concerted international action could stop that . 
While no explicit bargain was discussed , Dep [ORG FM Torki  ] explained that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] understood [LOC China  ] was concerned about having access to energy supplies , which could be cut off by [LOC Iran  ] , and wanted to attract more trade and investment . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was willing to provide assurances on those scores to [LOC China  ] , but only in exchange for tangible [MISC Chinese  ] actions to restrain [LOC Iran  ] , s drive for nuclear weapons . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Since King [PER Abdullah  ] 's historic visit to [LOC Beijing  ] in January 2006 , the [MISC Saudi-Chinese  ] relationship has focused predominantly on energy and trade . 
However , the relationship may be showing signs of political evolution . 
While the [MISC Chinese  ] would likely prefer to stay away from political controversy , their economic power and permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] has made it more and more difficult for them to avoid politics altogether. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) COMMENT CONTINUED: The incentives for the [MISC Saudis  ] to [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000123 003.2 OF 003 try and leverage their economic relationship with [LOC China  ] for political gain with respect to sensitive regional issues , such as [LOC Iran  ] and the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict , are significant and growing . 
After patiently focusing on building the economic relationsip since 2006 , [ORG FM Saud  ] , s public and private prodding of [ORG FM Yang  ] indicates the [MISC Saudis  ] are ready to try and cash in some political chips .
