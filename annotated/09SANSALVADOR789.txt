) End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told Charge and Emboffs August 21 that the Friends of [PER Mauricio  ] movement was moving to formalize its status and had just selected [PER Funes  ] himself as the President of the ( now renamed ) [ORG Citizen Movement for Change  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there were no immediate plans to convert the [ORG Citizen Movement for Change  ] into a political party but did not rule out that possibility . 
He said the near-term goal of the organization was to accompany President [PER Funes  ] as he governed and to provide him non-FMLN political support during his term . 
He said the Friends of [PER Mauricio  ] organization in the [LOC U.S.  ] would likely move to formalize its status , too. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Funes  ] and those in his inner circle were concerned about both his personal security as well as technical security of their communications . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also lamented the state of physical security around [LOC Casa Presidencial  ] , the presidential office compound . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he suspected elements in the ( left-wing ) [MISC FMLN  ] were monitoring phone calls of the President , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and other non-FMLN members of the Government . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Funes  ] would welcome [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in both areas . 
Charge offered to arrange a meeting with [PER Funes  ] and appropriate Embassy staff ; [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he and the President were disappointed in the new Director of the [MISC Salvadoran  ] [ORG State Intelligence Organization  ] ( [ORG OIE  ] ) , [PER Eduardo Linares  ] ( aka [PER Douglas Santamaria  ] ) . 
Despite high hopes initially , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said almost three months into the [PER Funes  ] administration , he was still not receiving daily briefings from [ORG OIE  ] . 
He recounted other instances where he felt [PER Funes  ] was ill-served by the [ORG OIE  ] under [PER Linares  ] , including the surprise arrival of substantial numbers of protesters at [LOC Casa Presidencial  ] , complete with portable toilets , with no advance warning . 
In another case , in the days following [LOC Zelaya  ] 's expulsion from [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] FM [PER Maduro  ] arrived in a [MISC BRV  ] plane in [LOC San Salvador  ] , met with senior , hard-line elements of the [MISC FMLN  ] , and [ORG OIE  ] never reported this [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
( Note: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] learned of the visit from a confidante at the airport . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also expressed hope that the [ORG USG  ] would be able to provide assistance for blocking mobile phone transmissions from [MISC Salvadoran  ] prisons ; Charge pointed out that assistance would be available , too , but through different channels , much of it part of [LOC Plan Merida  ] . 
However , he said , the complicating factor remained Minister of [ORG Public Security and Justice  ] [PER Manuel Melgar  ] . 
Charge said we expect to receive shortly instructions to meet with [PER Funes  ] on the subject . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Melgar  ] 's appointment was not taken to display any disrespect to the [LOC U.S.  ] , but had been a compromise with the [MISC FMLN  ] , which had sought appointment of [MISC FMLN  ] hard-liner [PER Jose Luis Merino  ] ( aka [PER Ramiro Vasquez  ] ) as [ORG Public Security Minister.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Funes  ] , he said , had pushed back and preferred to name [PER Melgar  ] to that position because he had developed a certain rapport with [PER Melgar  ] during the campaign . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described [PER Melgar  ] 's behavior around [PER Funes  ] during the campaign as compliant and loyal to [PER Funes  ] , characteristics he said would not have been the case with [PER Merino  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Funes  ] would consider new information on [PER Melgar  ] and take appropriate action , fully cognizant of [PER Melgar  ] 's linkage to the 1985 [LOC Zona Rosa  ] killings. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: The message from [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] on behalf of [PER Funes  ] was clear: we have great confidence in the [ORG USG  ] , real security concerns , and need your help . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment continued: The stress of the bifurcated [MISC Funes/FMLN  ] relationship continues to manifest itself in the [LOC GOES  ] . 
While mediocre performance by two [MISC FMLN  ] members in key positions may provide [PER Funes  ] the pretext for a cabinet shuffle , it does not guarantee the [MISC FMLN  ] will take their removal lying down . 
[MISC FMLN  ] leaders are likely to demand that their quota of positions in the [LOC GOES  ] remain stable , and have shown their ability to be disruptive when they don't get their way .
