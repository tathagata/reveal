[LOC MADRID  ] 1179 Classified By: DCM [PER Hugo Llorens  ] for reasons 1.4 b & d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG SUMMARY: Post  ] appreciates [ORG INR  ] 's careful attention to the evolving issue of [LOC Spain  ] 's engagement with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The Ambassador and DCM , as well as [LOC Washington  ] visitors , continue to take every opportunity to express to the [ORG GOS  ] our disagreement with its current policy . 
Additional information on the relationship , keyed to Ref A 's questions , is provided below . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Question A: Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] told the Ambassador that he and his Chief of [ORG Staff Javier  ] Sancho had initiated the [LOC Cuba  ] trip on their own and did not act on instructions from President [ORG Zapatero  ] 's office in [LOC Moncloa  ] . 
As we understand [ORG Moratinos'  ] decision-making and leadership style , he has a certain amount of autonomy and shares with [ORG Zapatero  ] a penchant for sudden , almost theatrical , announcements that are not widely consulted first . 
[PER Moratinos  ] is most likely to resort to these tactics when he feels that he is not getting the respect that he believes that he deserves . 
The specific timing of [ORG Moratinos'  ] visit to [LOC Havana  ] may have had to do with a sudden change in [ORG Moratinos'  ] calendar or the felt need to set a new course before the [ORG EU  ] 's then-upcoming [LOC Cuba  ] deliberations scheduled for June . 
Politically , the visit was timed on the eve of regional and municipal elections held on May 27 and intended to mobilize the more left-wing base of the ruling [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Question B: Although the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] has attempted to score domestic political points from [ORG Moratinos'  ] trip to [LOC Cuba  ] , the issue has not gained traction with the public . 
The Government has more or less successfully made the case that the previous policy of isolation was not providing results , and that it was worth trying something new . 
The far left supports engagement with [LOC Cuba  ] , and the center-left isnt focused on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Furthermore , most of the [MISC Spanish  ] public , including more right-wing elements , are opposed to [LOC US  ] sanctions against [LOC Cuba  ] and there remains an abiding affection and nostalgia for [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Spain  ] 's last major colony . 
Even right-of-center leaders like [PER Manuel Fraga  ] , a pillar of the conservative element in [LOC Spain  ] , have met [PER Fidel Castro  ] . 
The bottom line was that there was no political downside for the [ORG Zapatero  ] government in approving [ORG Moratinos'  ] initiative . 
It is true that most of the senior " [LOC Cuba  ] hands " in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , including Secretary of State for [MISC Latin American  ] Affairs [PER Trini Jimenez  ] , Political Director [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] and Director General for [ORG Latin America Javier Sandomingo  ] , opposed the Foreign Minister 's decision to travel to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
However , once the decision was made , these senior officials have loyally promoted the new policy approach. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Question C: The media splits along ideological lines , with conservative newspapers [PER La Razon  ] and [ORG ABC  ] harshly criticizing [ORG GOS  ] actions on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Even [PER El Pais  ] , which tends to support liberal policies and the current government , has been relatively critical of [PER Moratinos  ] trip , particularly the failure to meet with dissidents and the lack of discernible results. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Question D: For details on the first session of the bilateral human rights dialogue , please see ref B 's readout of DCM 's conversation on June 11 with [ORG MFA Political  ] Director [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] , who had just returned from leading [LOC Spain  ] 's delegation to [LOC Havana  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] professes that it will exert " strong pressure " on human rights issues through this dialogue , and has sought to persuade us that the [LOC US  ] can expect to see measurable results . 
The [ORG EU  ] has offered to [LOC Cuba  ] to a similar " comprehensive dialogue " and invited a [MISC Cuban  ] delegation to [LOC Brussels  ] to discuss details , but we are not aware that [LOC Cuba  ] has responded at this time. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Question D ( cont 'd ) : [ORG MFA  ] has announced that it will hold another dialogue session in September . 
[ORG MFA Deputy DG for  ] human rights [PER Fernando Fernandez-Arias  ] ( protect ) told poloff that the [MISC Cubans  ] proposed holding it in [ORG NYC  ] at the time of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] went along with this against the objections of [PER Fernandez-Arias  ] and the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador to [ORG UN  ] . 
[PER Fernandez-Arias  ] noted that the [MISC Spaniards  ] would face certain problems with a [LOC NY  ] meeting , including: where to hold the meeting ; how to keep the meeting from taking place between [PER Perez Roque  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] ; how to avoid being outsmarted by the [MISC Cubans  ] during the incredibly hectic week ; how to keep the [MISC Cubans  ] from creating a media circus ; and how to avoid the [MISC Spain-Cuba  ] meeting becoming the focus of any [MISC US-Spanish  ] bilateral talks . 
He also said that the [MISC Cubans  ] were irritated that [LOC Spain  ] issued a statement regretting the [LOC MADRID  ] 00001420 002 OF 002 loss of the [ORG UNHRC Special Rapporteur for  ] [LOC Cuba  ] , but that the [MISC Spanish  ] replied that they really did regret losing it . 
The [MISC Cubans  ] promised to make certain gestures , including opening access to the [ORG Red Cross  ] , once the [ORG UNHRC  ] mandate went away. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Question E: [ORG MFA  ] insists that it maintains a robust policy toward the dissidents , and notes that [ORG MFA DG for Latin America Sandomingo  ] met with [MISC Cuban  ] dissident groups in [LOC Madrid  ] on June 19 to explain [ORG GOS  ] policy . 
According to [ORG MFA  ] , he described the " frank and constructive " environment of [PER Dezcallar  ] 's meeting in [LOC Havana  ] and emphasized that " all issues " were on the table . 
Dissidents including [PER Raul Rivero  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] [MISC Democracia Ya  ] leader [PER Rigoberto Carceller  ] attended the meeting , but criticized the [ORG GOS  ] policy . 
[PER Carceller  ] said " I don't doubt that they have talked about everything in [LOC Havana  ] , but I don't think that they will achieve any results . 
" The [MISC Madrid-based  ] dissidents insisted that the [MISC Spanish  ] government meet with dissidents in [LOC Havana  ] whenever it meets with the [MISC Cuban  ] government. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Question F: Updated information on major [MISC Spanish  ] business interests in [LOC Cuba  ] is detailed in Ref [MISC C. Most  ] [MISC Spanish  ] businessmen , regardless of political persuasion , are interested in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
It is certain that [MISC Spanish  ] companies seek to influence [ORG GOS  ] decisions on [LOC Cuba  ] , but they do so discretely in order to avoid possible [MISC Helms-Burton  ] complications . 
It is likely that [MISC Spanish  ] companies limit their possible lobbying to the economic dimension of the relationship . 
As discussed above , the [ORG Zapatero  ] government is engaged with the [MISC Cuban  ] regime , so it is not likely that [MISC Spanish  ] firms are needed as conduits between [LOC Havana  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] . 
Press reports indicate that [ORG Repsol  ] has won the right to prospect for oil in a number of blocks off the coast of [LOC Cuba  ] , but there are no publicly available numbers on how much money , if any , [ORG Repsol  ] has spent on physical oil and gas exploration in [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Question G: The [ORG Ministry of Economy & Finance  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , [ORG Tourism  ] and Trade do influence the economic dimensions of [MISC Spanish  ] [LOC Cuba  ] policy , particularly with respect to debt forgiveness negotiations and export credits . 
These ministries prefer to use economic criteria in making [MISC Cuba-related  ] decisions but will bend to foreign policy considerations , particularly if the Office of the [LOC Presidency  ] insists . 
The Office of the [LOC Presidency  ] 's [ORG Economic Office  ] has not been active on [LOC Cuba  ] policy as far as we know , but it certainly could be. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Question H: On March 11 , 2007 , the [MISC Cuban  ] government formally asked the [ORG GOS  ] for debt relief negotiations , for the [ORG Spanish Export Credit Agency  ] ( [ORG Cesce  ] ) to grant export credits again for [MISC Spanish  ] exports to [LOC Cuba  ] , and to renegotiate a [ORG Bilateral Investment Treaty  ] . 
Since then , there has been little discussion on the status of these issues . 
We do know , however , that the [ORG Ministry of Economy  ] 's preference is to use [ORG Paris Club  ] criteria in determining how much [LOC Cuba  ] debt [LOC Spain  ] should forgive/renegotiate - we know that the [ORG Ministry  ] is prepared to deal on a portion of the debt . 
With respect to export credits , [ORG Cesce  ] reports to the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] . 
This [ORG Ministry  ] is so far not convinced that [LOC Cuba  ] meets the normal criteria for reestablishing export credits . 
It is worth noting , however , that despite the absence of export guarantees , [MISC Spanish  ] exports to [LOC Cuba  ] went from [MISC Euros  ] 489 million in 2005 to [MISC Euros  ] 692 million in 2006 . 
We do not know the status of the negotiations on a possible [ORG Bilateral Investment Treaty.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) Question I: [LOC Spain  ] considers itself the [ORG EU  ] opinion leader on issues related to [LOC Latin America  ] . 
It does not willingly take advice from any other country on [MISC Cuban  ] issues , but as the recent debate over the [ORG EU  ] Common Policy shows , it can be forced to back down by concerted action by other [ORG EU  ] members . 
It is useful , in [LOC Embassy Madrid  ] 's opinion , to develop alternative voices within the [ORG EU  ] to challenge alleged [MISC Spanish  ] leadership on [LOC Cuba  ] policy when this leadership appears in conflict with the [ORG EU  ] 's own common policy and broader stated goals of support for democracy and human rights. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Question J: As was widely reported in the press in early June , [LOC Spain  ] tried and failed to lift the [ORG EU  ] sanctions on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
It may try again in the future , particularly if it can show results from its engagement with the [PER Castro  ] regime .
