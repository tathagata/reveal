( C ) Summary . 
A well-briefed , confident [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) described her policy priorities to the Ambassador on September 20 , a few days before she departs for a five-day program in [LOC New York  ] . 
Although she defended [ORG GOA  ] positions on controversial economic issues , [ORG CFK  ] expressed a strong desire to promote foreign investment , increase scientific and educational exchange with the [LOC United States  ] , and " tell it like it is " with [MISC American  ] policymakers . 
The discussion 's conciliatory content and tone confirms our expectation that [ORG CFK  ] will prove a more reliable , trustworthy , and accessible partner of the [LOC United States  ] than her husband , [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG CFK  ] met with the Ambassador for 45 minutes at the [ORG Presidential Residence  ] in [LOC Los Olivos  ] on September 20 . 
[LOC Argentina  ] 's first lady and presumptive next president was in full command of her brief , speaking without notes on a broad range of topics . 
At one point , noting that she and the Ambassador were reviewing topics that would resurface throughout her [LOC New York  ] trip , she said ( referring to her travels and speeches ) , " This is good preparation , but hey , I 'm already prepared ! 
" She was gracious and relaxed throughout , not rushing through any part of the conversation and listening as well as talking . 
The meeting was [ORG CFK  ] 's second with the Ambassador ; in contrast , President [PER Kirchner  ] has never met privately with the Ambassador . 
She also went out of her way to ask the Ambassador to " send greetings to [PER Shannon  ] , " whom she recalled meeting early on in [LOC Washington  ] just before the Assistant Secretary was confirmed by the [ORG Senate  ] . 
[ORG Paris Club: Willing  ] to Deal " Without Preconceptions " ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After [ORG CFK  ] previewed her schedule in [LOC New York  ] ( ref A ) , the Ambassador noted the great international interest in her policy views . 
He commented that [ORG CFK  ] 's interest in the world and willingness to countenance policy changes , especially in the economic realm , were well-received abroad , including in the [LOC United States  ] , as is her evident openness to dialogue . 
The Ambassador also mentioned issues that may well draw questions from journalists , businessmen , and others during her program , including prospects for a deal with the [ORG Paris Club  ] , the investment climate , prospects for inflation , and the [ORG GOA  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG CFK  ] replied in great detail on economic themes , but refrained from commenting on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
On the [ORG Paris Club  ] ( [ORG PC  ] ) , she stressed [LOC Argentina  ] 's desire to reach an agreement , but reiterated the current government 's insistence that a deal not be conditioned on a [ORG GOA  ] accord with the [ORG IMF  ] . 
She said that [LOC Argentina  ] 's attitude stemmed not from a anti-IMF bias , but from a conviction that [ORG IMF  ] policies as currently constituted are anti-growth -- and therefore unacceptable . 
That is why , in her view , the [ORG IMF  ] had experienced a " serious loss of prestige in [MISC Latin American  ] societies . 
" " If we don't grow , " she continued , " we can't pay . 
You can't collect debts from the dead . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG CFK  ] characterized debt agreements reached by previous [MISC Argentine  ] governments as illusory , made by desperate governments that never intended to repay . 
The current government , and the one that she hopes to lead , sought to break what she called " a cycle of lies " and restructure [MISC Argentine  ] debt without inhibiting growth . 
Such a negotiation , she said , would need to occur " without preconceptions , " and both sides should come to the table with flexibility and an open mind . 
She claimed that , during his campaign swing through [LOC Argentina  ] ( ref B ) , [MISC French  ] candidate for [ORG IMF Managing Director  ] [PER Strauss-Kahn  ] had expressed sympathy for [LOC Argentina  ] 's approach and criticism of the [ORG IMF  ] 's track record in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
She acknowledged , however , that " he 's running for office , so maybe he was just telling us what we wanted to hear . 
" The Ambassador said that the [LOC United States  ] stands ready to engage constructively to move to a [ORG Paris Club  ] solution. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador mentioned the issue of bond-holdots as another potential topic that [ORG CFK  ] will face in [LOC New York  ] , noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] bondholders are carrying out a well-organized effort to win support for their cause . 
[ORG CFK  ] indicated awareness of the lobbying resources holdouts bring to bear and their negative attitude towards the current [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001888 002 OF 003 government . 
She said that she had encountered their publicity campaign during her recent trip to [LOC Germany  ] , and knew they were active in [LOC Japan  ] , too . 
At the same time , she offered little hope that the holdouts would get a deal anytime soon , noting that a law circumscribes what the government can offer them . 
She told the Ambassador that " I know this isn't what you want to hear , " but said that previous [MISC Argentine  ] leaders would tell foreign Ambassadors what their interlocutors wanted to hear , not what they really thought or intended to do . 
She and her husband were different , she insisted ; they told it straight . 
[ORG CFK  ] said that she understood that [MISC Americans  ] valued straight talk , and she hoped that this quality would earn her trust and respect in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Foreign Investment: Bring It On ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CFK  ] said that the [ORG GOA  ] 's main motivation in striking a deal with the [ORG Paris Club  ] was to entice foreign export credit agencies to go back on cover in [LOC Argentina  ] , facilitating her plans to bring more foreign investment here . 
She noted that foreign investment in certain sectors was already booming . 
Auto companies , including [ORG Mercedes-Benz  ] , [ORG Peugeot  ] , [ORG Ford  ] , and [ORG GM  ] were pumping tens of millions of dollars of new investment into their plants , with many adding new assembly lines and exporting much of their output. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [ORG CFK  ] reserved her greatest enthusiasm for [LOC Argentina  ] 's progress in attracting investment in the information technology sector as a means to expand [LOC Argentina  ] 's global economic role . 
She noted proudly that IT represented the fastest growing sector in the economy during her husband 's presidency . 
She expected great things from the sector in the future . 
" We have great soccer players in [LOC Argentina  ] because our kids play so much soccer , " she said . 
" Now they spend all their time on computers , so I know that there 's an [MISC Argentine  ] [PER Bill Gates  ] out there . 
We just have to find him . 
" The Ambassador agreed that this was an area of great potential . 
He noted the significant [LOC U.S.  ] investment in this sector , including the fact that [ORG IBM  ] is the largest [LOC U.S.  ] employer in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
He also made a pitch for quick approval of [ORG Turner Broadcasting  ] 's purchase of [LOC Claxion  ] , a local audiovisual company , which will lead to [MISC Argentine  ] creations being distributed throughout [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Playing [LOC Defense: Energy  ] , Inflation ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite her expression of enthusiasm for foreign investment , she was defensive about charges that the current government is attacking foreign investors in the [MISC Argentine  ] energy sector ( septel ) . 
She characterized [ORG Exxon  ] 's apparent exit from the [MISC Argentine  ] market as the result of a regional draw-down in [LOC Latin America  ] , and argued that " the energy sector is a problem everywhere right now . 
" She said that private companies miscalculated domestic energy demand over the past few years , failing to anticipate the government 's success in achieving extremely rapid rates of growth . 
Now , there was little idle capacity in [LOC Argentina  ] 's energy sector . 
The [ORG GOA  ] , she insisted , was doing its part , presiding over the construction of thousands of kilometers of new pipelines and seeking new sources of supply. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CFK  ] was also defensive when she responded to concerns that the [ORG GOA  ] was manipulating economic statistics to keep [MISC Argentine  ] inflation numbers down . 
She said that there were several biases in the way that the government 's statistical institute ( [ORG INDEC  ] ) had previously collected price data . 
She claimed that it did not account sufficiently for seasonal variations in price data ; collected food data in posh food emporiums rather than in the modest groceries where most [MISC Argentines  ] shop ; and focused on private school costs , while the vast majority of [MISC Argentines  ] sent their children to public schools . 
She said that [LOC Argentina  ] had revised its inflation methodology six times since the 1930s . 
The political opposition , she said , was behind the claims that current methodological changes reflected a government plot to understate inflation . 
She also blamed the opposition for the growing warnings about electoral fraud in [LOC Argentina  ] , which she dismissed as " bizarre . 
" [ORG CFK  ] did acknowledge that the [ORG GOA  ] needs to settle with clarity the methodological issues as well as to resolve the union problems troubling the statistical institute . 
Future Economic Goals --------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG CFK  ] returned to economic growth as the most [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001888 003 OF 003 important objective of the government that she intends to lead . 
She said that , if [LOC Argentina  ] achieves positive growth in 2007 and 2008 , it will represent the first time in a century that the country has grown for six straight years . 
If its economy continues to grow at rates of five to six percent for another decade , she continued , [LOC Argentina  ] would become " unbeatable . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A key sector for the country 's future , she said , was tourism , an area in which her country had enormous undeveloped potential . 
With the rise in ecotourism , the wealthiest tourists were looking for unspoiled , safe venues , which [LOC Argentina  ] had in abundance . 
She noted that [LOC Argentina  ] experienced a travel boom after the [MISC Asian  ] tsunami , as tourists sought safer places in which to experience nature . 
The Ambassador interjected that for the tourism sector to achieve its potential , [LOC Argentina  ] needed to address its dysfunctional domestic aviation sector . 
She agreed , identifying reform of domestic aviation as " one of our great challenges . 
" Without referring specifically to the strike-prone national airline Aerolineas Argentinas , she identified two specific problems in the sector: a need for more resources and a conflictive labor environment in which a handful of combative unions undermined all attempts to turn the sector around . 
Other Issues: Exchanges , TIP ---------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador raised trafficking in persons ( the need to pass a federal law ) and the importance of expanded educational and cultural exchanges , especially among youth . 
He asked for the [ORG Senator  ] 's support . 
CFK: -- expressed strong interest in cultural and educational exchanges with the [LOC United States  ] , including an upcoming [LOC Buenos Aires  ] summit of hemispheric women leaders organized by [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC NGO Vital Voices  ] ; -- told the Ambassador that [LOC Argentina  ] " must not fail to take advantage of your scientific resources ; they're the best in the world " . -- reassured the Ambassador that legislation to criminalize trafficking in persons would pass the [MISC Argentine  ] [ORG Congress  ] after the October elections " without any great difficulty . 
" Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The discussion 's conciliatory content and tone confirmed what we have observed in [ORG CFK  ] 's speeches and gestures with increasing frequency: [LOC Argentina  ] 's presidential front-runner seeks a rapprochement with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG CFK  ] seems to understand that a pragmatic , enmity-free relationship with [LOC Washington  ] will buy [LOC Argentina  ] leeway on a number of critical financial and geopolitical issues . 
At the same time , this forward-leaning attitude is unlikely to presage the next government 's repudiation of the current regime 's nationalist , populist policies . 
[ORG CFK  ] 's defense of [ORG GOA  ] positions on the [ORG IMF  ] , the investment climate , the energy sector , and inflation numbers during this private discussion suggests an unwillingness to break with the heterodox policies of her husband . 
But even if the charm offensive is calculated rather than heart-felt , there is no mistaking the opportunities that await the [ORG USG  ] beyond the [MISC Argentine  ] presidential election . 
[ORG CFK  ] 's conversation with the Ambassador confirms our expectation that she will prove a more reliable , trustworthy , and accessible partner of the [LOC United States  ] . 
That does not , however , take away from the challenges we will face in forging solutions to such issues as the [ORG Paris Club  ] or bondholders' outstanding debt .
