( C ) SUMMARY . 
[PER Carlos Torres  ] , Counselor for [ORG Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament  ] within the [ORG MFA  ] 's DG for [ORG Strategic Affairs and Terrorism  ] , on February 10 spoke with [ORG POLOFF  ] and Deputy ECONCOUNS on a nascent [ORG MFA  ] proposal regarding a year-long series of trilateral technical exercises with the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] , the reaction among key allies to the [ORG USG  ] 's reforms to Terms of Reference for the [ORG Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] ( [ORG GICNT  ] ) , and [LOC Spain  ] 's ongoing efforts to protect its domestic nuclear power plants from the terrorist threat . 
END SUMMARY . 
Proposed US-Spain-Morocco Technical Exercises on [ORG Nuclear Emergency Management  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] wants to secure buy-in from the [ORG U.S. Department of State  ] on a GOS proposal to conduct trilateral technical exercises on nuclear emergency management - to be held mainly in [LOC Morocco  ] - throughout 2011 , following extensive planning through 2010 . 
Additional , compatible exercises could be held in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] wants to cooperate with [LOC Morocco  ] , its southern neighbor , on nuclear terrorism exercises to improve regional and global security , but cooperation between the two on security issues is a sensitive topic bilaterally . 
[PER Torres  ] highlighted that the majority of the 2004 [ORG Madrid  ] train bombers were originally from [LOC Morocco  ] and some officials in the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) have expressed reservations about close cooperation with the [MISC Moroccans  ] . 
A bilateral exercise - without [LOC U.S.  ] participation - would be difficult , according to [PER Torres  ] . 
However , [LOC Spain  ] knows that the [ORG USG  ] has strong relations with [LOC Morocco  ] and , with the [ORG Department of State  ] 's presence to coordinate and provide political weight , believes that all three nations would likely see the utility in conducting trilateral exercises , similar to the table-top exercises that [LOC Spain  ] hosted for [ORG GICNT  ] partners in Spring <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MFA  ] would like to involve the [ORG IAEA  ] as well . 
[PER Torres  ] , who is known to [ORG Post  ] as a reliable , straight-shooting interlocutor , told [MISC Embassy  ] officials that [LOC Spain  ] has a 100 million euro budget that it can apply to this proposal , which he said has the support of the both [MISC Moroccan  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] MFAs . 
He said he realizes the [ORG Department of State  ] will need to evaluate this proposal and said he is available to discuss it. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Torres  ] outlined the genesis for this proposal by relating that while in [LOC Rabat  ] in mid-January observing a [MISC U.S.-Morocco  ] bilateral nuclear emergency management training exercise ( Ref A ) , he was encouraged by the technical cooperation he witnessed between the [ORG U.S Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration  ] ( [ORG DOE/NNSA  ] ) and its [MISC Moroccan  ] counterpart . 
He said that his DOE/NSSA contacts were amenable to working with the [MISC Spanish  ] , but the [MISC Moroccan  ] technical experts , despite having invited him , were a bit arms-length . 
[PER Torres  ] suggested that what was missing from the events he attended was representation by the [ORG Department of State  ] . 
He said that when he raised the issue at a [ORG GICNT  ] event in [LOC Budapest  ] a week later , his [LOC U.S.  ] contacts were unaware the exercise in [LOC Rabat  ] had taken place . 
He informed [MISC Embassy  ] officials that [LOC Rabat  ] would host a related event on March 22 and suggested it would be good for someone from the [ORG Department of State  ] to attend . 
Arguing for Continuing a Strong [LOC U.S.  ] Role in the [ORG GICNT  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Fleshing out misgivings originally conveyed to [ORG Post  ] in Ref B , [PER Torres  ] also stated that the GOS is worried by the [ORG USG  ] 's proposed reforms to the [ORG GICNT  ] 's Terms of Reference , which [LOC Spain  ] views as likely to put at risk the [ORG USG  ] 's political leadership of the [ORG GICNT  ] . 
He argued that the international community needs the [ORG GICNT  ] as a viable political forum on this issue and noted that the [ORG IAEA  ] cannot play that role . 
[PER Torres  ] also conveyed [LOC Spain  ] 's concern about the proposed voting policy within the [ORG GICNT  ] , which he thought could lead to the [ORG GICNT  ] becoming politicized by certain members . 
He also fretted that the voting policy could cause problems with [LOC Russia  ] , which he suggested was losing interest in the [ORG GICNT  ] . 
[PER Torres  ] said that the [MISC Spanish  ] delegation aired its concerns with [LOC US  ] counterparts during the [ORG GICNT  ] 's January 19 event in [LOC Budapest  ] and further stated that [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and [LOC South Korea  ] share [LOC Spain  ] 's concerns on this matter . 
He remarked that the general feeling among these allies is that following the successful launch of a very interesting initiative , it is being abandoned . 
He added that each of these countries believes they are " maxed out " and cannot step up with further contributions . 
Reviewing Physical Security Measures at [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Nuclear Plants  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the domestic front , [PER Torres  ] said that the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG MOI  ] continue to review the physical security of [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear facilities . 
Pointing to a four-inch-thick binder dated 1987 which presumably addressed lessons learned , he stated that he had recently met officials at the [ORG MOI  ] , where they had discussed the terrorist group [ORG Basque Fatherland and Liberty  ] 's ( [ORG ETA  ] 's ) 1977-1982 armed campaign against the nuclear plant then under construction in Lemoniz ( see Ref C ) . 
[PER Torres  ] described [ORG ETA  ] 's campaign as " fairly successful " and noted that terrorists managed to get fairly far into the facility . 
He described the current physical security measures at [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear facilities as " good " but suggested they all face one weakness: as currently configured , they do not protect against an insider with clearances who might want to stage an attack inside one of [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear facilities . 
The GOS is increasingly concerned about how to defend against this scenario , although [PER Torres  ] gave no indication that [LOC Spain  ] has concrete information that either [ORG ETA  ] or radical [MISC Islamists  ] are planning an attack using such tactics is being planned .
