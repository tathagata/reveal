RAY FOR REASONS 1.4 B , D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( SBU ) This cable includes an ACTION REQUEST , please see paragraph 8. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Prime Minister [PER Morgan Tsvangirai  ] said that while there was tremendous progress in 2009 as compared to 2008 , [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and its coalition government still faces challenges . 
Reforms must be implemented quickly , and there has been some progress , though none that affects the [MISC ZANU-PF  ] power structure . 
Implementation of the [ORG Global Political Agreement  ] ( [ORG GPA  ] ) has been slow and [PER Mugabe  ] has been using delay to maintain control . 
In 2010 there must be some progress to show the people , but it will require actions by all parties , including the [MISC Western  ] powers , to change the status quo . 
He expects the recently announced commissions to be installed in early 2010 , and is satisfied with their makeup . 
[ORG ZANU-PF  ] has implemented a strategy of reciprocity in the negotiations , using [MISC Western  ] sanctions as a cudgel against [ORG MDC  ] . 
He would like to see some quiet moves , provided there are acceptable benchmarks , to ‘give’ some modest reward for modest progress. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassadors of the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] , [MISC French  ] , and the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and a representative of the [ORG EU  ] were called to PM Tsvangirai’s residence at 0730 on December 24 for an update briefing on the current discussions among the principals in the coalition government and a request from him for some flexibility on the part of the West on the issue of sanctions . 
He said that there has been tremendous progress in restoring confidence of the people in government in 2009 as compared to 2008 . 
The people generally endorse the government , but the future holds both opportunities and challenges . 
The principal challenge is how to quickly embark on reforms . 
There has been a little progress on that front , but not what was expected . 
Implementation of the [ORG GPA  ] has been too slow , and he is not satisfied with it . 
[ORG ZANU-PF  ] has been using delay on the [ORG GPA  ] to maintain control . 
The negotiators have held 11 meetings up until the end of the year . 
On the issues of media , land , and corruption , there has been some progress , but none of it touches on the power structure . 
On the three stickiest issues , [PER Gono  ] , [PER Tomana  ] , and [PER Bennett  ] , there has been no progress . 
He is hopeful , however , that if some progress can be made on other issues , these too will be settled. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG ZANU-PF  ] seems to have introduced a new tactic in its agenda - reciprocity . 
What this means , he said , is that [PER Mugabe  ] is asking , “What’s in this for us ? ” If [ORG MDC  ] gets governorships , [PER Mugabe  ] asks , why can’t the sanctions against [ORG ZANU-PF  ] be lifted ? 
[PER Tsvangirai  ] said that it seems that [PER Mugabe  ] plans to use the governors as a trade-off against sanctions . 
He said he has repeatedly told [PER Mugabe  ] that [ORG MDC  ] has no control over sanctions . 
But , he added , lack of any flexibility on the issue of sanctions poses a problem for him and his party . 
In this he assured us that Deputy Prime Minister [PER Arthur Q  ] In this he assured us that Deputy Prime Minister [PER Arthur Mutambara  ] is in full agreement with him . 
He also acknowledged that his public statements calling for easing of sanctions versus his private conversations saying they must be kept in place have caused problems. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Tsvangirai  ] said the challenges for 2010 are: - Get the reforms moving on the constitutional process. - Open media space , national healing , and anti-corruption. - Prepare for elections in 2011. - Move from economic stability to growth. - Deal with human rights violations . 
He said the coalition government must expedite action in all these areas because , not only are [MISC Western  ] governments watching , but the people of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] will expect improvement . 
He said [ORG Security Sector Reform  ] will take center stage in [LOC HARARE  ] 00001004 002 OF 002 2010 , using a multilateral approach involving all parties here and [ORG SADC  ] . 
In early 2010 , [PER Tsvangirai  ] and [PER Mutambara  ] will take the diplomatic lead on the sanctions issue . 
The question before us , [PER Tsvangirai  ] said , is how to start moving on rewarding progress without giving the impression we are rewarding lack of progress or bad behavior . 
We need to establish acceptable benchmarks of progress , and determine what each involved party needs to do to change the status quo . 
If necessary , he said , he and [PER Mutambara  ] can quietly meet with [MISC Western  ] leadership to develop a plan on the issue of sanctions . 
He said that he and [PER Mutambara  ] have decided to take this issue out of the hands of the negotiators and handle it personally . 
What is needed is some kind of concrete roadmap that all can agree on , linking easing of sanctions with identifiable and quantifiable progress. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Tsvangirai  ] wants to go to [PER Mugabe  ] after the negotiators deliver their final report on January 15 , 2010 , with some idea of what the [MISC Western  ] position is on sanctions . 
He said that in order to change the status quo , all parties might have to take some risks , because maintaining the status quo only guarantees continued stalemate in the reform process . 
Economic recovery and democratic reform are the essential requirements in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] right now . 
The 2011 elections are a critical goal as well . 
Winning the election , he said , is not the problem , but a peaceful transfer of power is . 
The recently announced commissions will be installed early in 2010 , he said , and he is satisfied with their makeup . 
The heads of the [ORG Media  ] and [ORG Electoral Commissions  ] are honest men who he believes will put the interests of the country first . 
His goal is to have the [ORG Electoral Commission  ] hire its own staff and be independent . 
The key is to wrest control from the [LOC Securocrats.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On the subject of [PER Mugabe  ] himself , [PER Tsvangirai  ] said that in his recent meetings , though [PER Mugabe  ] seems mentally acute , he appears old and very tired . 
He comes to many meetings unbriefed and unaware of the content . 
It appears that he is being managed by hardliners . 
[PER Tsvangirai  ] said his goal now is to find a way to ‘manage’ [PER Mugabe  ] himself . 
One way , perhaps , would be to give him something to give his hardliners . 
Precisely what that something is , he said , is something he is still wrestling with. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST . 
We are skeptical of [MISC Mugabe’s  ] motives , and worried a bit at what appears to be naivete on Tsvangirai’s part . 
However , we believe that in one area he is correct: changing the status quo here will require some risk taking on everyone’s part . 
As we’ve previously discussed ( reftel ) , we think it might be in USG interests to consider some form of incremental easing of non-personal sanctions , provided we see actual implementation of some of these reforms . 
Post would appreciate Washington’s view on what would be acceptable benchmarks , and possible moves on our part . 
We also request guidance on what to tell Qmoves on our part . 
We also request guidance on what to tell [PER Tsvangirai  ] at our next meeting , which is expected early in the [MISC New Year  ] . 
END COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST .
