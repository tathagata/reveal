( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Summary: The Government of Iceland  ] announced on 29 September that it is taking a majority share in [ORG Glitnir Bank  ] , the country 's third largest bank . 
The move follows a frantic round of secret weekend consultations between Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] , the [ORG Central Bank  ] , the heads of all major political parties , and [LOC Iceland  ] 's leading banks . 
Under the agreement , the Government will purchase 75 percent of [ORG Glitnir  ] at roughly $878 million . 
This is the first significant government intervention in the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy during the recent crisis and comes after a week of harsh criticism for perceived inaction -- in particular , for not managing to include [LOC Iceland  ] in the 24 September exchange agreement between the [ORG U.S. Federal Reserve  ] and the central banks of the other [MISC Nordic  ] countries and [LOC Australia  ] . 
The immediate result of the bailout was the pre-filing for bankruptcy of a holding company which is interconnected to a large portion of businesses . 
It appears that [ORG Glitnir  ] will be saved , but the domino effect of weakened share prices could still damage the overall economy . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] announced on September 29 that it would buy a 75 percent share in the country 's third-largest bank , capping a tumultuous week in the economy here . 
On September 24 , the [ORG US Federal Reserve  ] announced it was making $30 billion available to the central banks in [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Norway  ] to ease money markets through an exchange agreement to improve global liquidity . 
The [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] came under immediate fire from [MISC Icelandic  ] financial experts and the media for not getting itself included in the agreement . 
After refusing comment for nearly 24 hours , the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] issued a statement saying that it had been engaged in talks with the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] in the past weeks . 
According to the statement , the [LOC U.S.  ] Fed did not see a reason to make such an agreement with the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] at this point , but the possibility of a future agreement has not been ruled out. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) For most of September , several well-respected economists and leading editorialists have publicly criticized the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's monetary policy and the [ORG GOI  ] 's handling of the ever worsening economic situation . 
Some even called for the resignation of the entire board of governors of the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
The rapid fall of the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona ( 40 percent since the beginning of 2008 ) and the news of the exclusion of [LOC Iceland  ] from the other [MISC Nordic  ] 's agreement with the [ORG U.S. Federal Reserve  ] only exacerbated the public outcry . 
This criticism has fueled a growing sentiment that [LOC Iceland  ] should explore joining the [ORG EU  ] and adopt the euro , with recent opinion polls showing for the first time majority support for exploring the possibility. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On September 27 , PM [PER Geir Haarde  ] called a meeting with the board of governors at the [ORG Central Bank  ] and his economic advisors . 
When asked , [PER Haarde  ] said he was only familiarizing himself with any developments that had taken place while he had been attending the [LOC UNGA  ] in [LOC New York  ] . 
After the meeting he said that such a meeting was normal and that no big news was about to break . 
On September 28 , [PER Haarde  ] and the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] 's board of governors held a late-night meeting with executives from [LOC Iceland  ] 's three main commercial banks , [ORG Kaupthing  ] , [ORG Landsbanki  ] , and [ORG Glitnir  ] and representatives from the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] -- the junior party in the coalition government -- and the opposition parties. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On Monday , September 29 the media announced that the [ORG GOI  ] was taking control of [ORG Glitnir  ] , the third largest [MISC Icelandic  ] bank , buying a 75 percent stake for 600 million euros ( approximately $878 million ) , more than 6 percent of [LOC Iceland  ] 's 2007 GDP . 
This move was a surprise to the general public . 
All parties involved quickly announced the problem was related to international financial markets and not the management or assets of the bank itself . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] said [ORG Glitnir  ] 's asset portfolio and capital position were solid and its loans were good quality ; it said it did not intend to keep its stake in [ORG Glitnir  ] for an extended period . 
The Prime Minister held a press conference to echo the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's sentiments and added that the government must safeguard financial stability . 
[ORG Glitnir  ] said its core operations were robust and CEO [PER Larus Welding  ] had been asked to stay . 
[ORG Glitnir  ] said it had been successful in raising funds this year despite very challenging market conditions , " nonetheless , the events unfolding in international financial markets in the past two weeks have had unforeseen consequences drastically changing the conditions of [ORG Glitnir  ] 's short-term funding , " the bank said in a statement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post 's contacts at [ORG Glitnir  ] confirmed that even bank employees had no idea this was coming . 
[ORG Glitnir  ] 's management has told employees that because the bank was very well run and management was not the problem , everyone will probably keep their jobs . 
The larger concern is for stockholders ; because the number of [ORG Glitnir  ] 's stock had to be increased to provide the state with 75 [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000213 002 OF 002 percent equity , [ORG Glitnir  ] 's stock lost even more value than market-induced declines and had dropped 88 percent of its value by the end of the day . 
The biggest shareholder of [ORG Glitnir  ] is Stodir ( formerly [ORG FL Group  ] and connected with [ORG Baugur Group  ] ) which just filed for pre-bankruptcy . 
The ripple effect of one of financial titan [ORG Baugur Group  ] 's major assets going bankrupt could set off other disruptions in the economy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Comment: Although  ] the main problem of [ORG Glitnir  ] was the inaccessibility to short term-credit caused by the global shortage of liquidity , resolving this has not cured all ills . 
The news on [ORG Glitnir  ] 's bailout sent the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona to a fresh record low against the euro and caused the value of [ORG Glitnir  ] 's stock to plunge . 
Given that in recent years [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic success has been largely based on leveraged buyouts , the plummeting value of stocks could have drastic consequences throughout the economy .
