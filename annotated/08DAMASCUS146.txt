( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: The February 21 designation of [PER Rami Makhluf  ] pursuant to [ORG E.O.  ] 13460 generated considerable discussion , but [MISC Syrian  ] media coverage has been minimal . 
Makhluf’s defiant announcement on [ORG BBC Arabic  ] radio that the designation was tantamount to a medal of honor was as close to an official reaction as we have seen . 
Human rights contacts overwhelmingly supported the action . 
A few [MISC Syrian  ] websites reporting the designation generated comments that generally denounced corruption and favored the action , but roughly 30 percent of the postings had positive things to say about [PER Makhluf  ] . 
Business and other reactions were mixed , with some saying the timing of the designation could not have been better , while others suggested the [ORG USG  ] action was a desperate political act that failed to achieve anything significant . 
We nonetheless detected uncertainty about what the designation could mean for [MISC Rami’s  ] partners and his foreign-based assets . 
End Summary ---------------------------------------- [PER MAKHLUF  ] REACTS WITH BRAVADO ON [ORG BBC  ] RADIO ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The February 21 designation of [PER Rami Makhluf  ] hit [LOC Damascus  ] on the eve of the [MISC Syrian  ] weekend and thus generated little initial media reaction . 
Two days after Washington’s announcement , [PER Rami  ] took to the airwaves of [ORG BBC Arabic Radio  ] to respond , calling the designation “a medal we hang on our chest” as part of a “political ploy aimed at undermining important ( [MISC Syrian  ] ) individuals.” He added , “They accuse us of corruption , while we are among the group that is working to invest the most in [LOC Syria.” Discounting  ] the impact of the designation , [PER Makhluf  ] claimed that he had no assets in the [LOC U.S.  ] “Only a fool would invest in [LOC America  ] , ” he said. “We were expecting such a decision to be issued over a year ago , but they were late.” Although FM [MISC Muallem  ] responded publicly when the [ORG E.O.  ] was first announced on February 13 , there thus far has been no official [ORG SARG  ] reaction to the [PER Makhluf  ] designation. --------------------------------------------- -- SERENDIPITOUS TIMING AMPLIFIES IMPACT ON REGIME --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Coming just a week after the assassination of [PER Imad Mughniyeh  ] , and during a period of rising tensions with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the [LOC West  ] , the timing of the [PER Makhluf  ] designation amplified its impact on the regime . 
Contacts report that [MISC Syrian  ] Military Intelligence ( [ORG SMI  ] ) and General Intelligence Directorate ( [ORG GID  ] ) officials are currently engaged in an internecine struggle to blame each other for the breach of security that resulted in [LOC Mughniyeh’s  ] death . 
In recent days , the [MISC Saudi-sponsored  ] Sharq al-Awsat published scathing articles suggesting that [LOC Syria  ] is not worthy of hosting the upcoming [MISC Arab  ] summit . 
Additionally , President [PER Mubarak  ] has publicly linked [MISC Syrian  ] policy in [LOC Lebanon  ] to Egypt’s [ORG DAMASCUS  ] 00000146 002 OF 004 participation in the [ORG Arab League  ] summit , and [MISC Syrians  ] are increasingly concerned about the direction [LOC Lebanon  ] is heading . 
Thus , in the conspiracy-fueled streets of [LOC Damascus  ] , our sources indicated that the [PER Makhluf  ] designation seemed to be a well-timed ratcheting-up of pressure on the regime. -------------------------------------------- EDUCATED SYRIANS AND [ORG CIVIL SOCIETY CELEBRATE  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The designation resonated on the [MISC Syrian  ] “street” among middle class followers of international media , many of whom quietly celebrated Makhluf’s public humiliation as a long-overdue comeuppance . 
The website “Syrianews” covered Makhluf’s response on [ORG BBC  ] , and approximately 70 percent of readers’ comments to the article were anti-Makhluf. “As for [MISC Santa Claus  ] [PER Makhluf  ] who is showering us with his deeds , ” wrote one , “could he explain to us where did he bring his first millions from ? ” Another commented , “Did [PER Rami  ] invest in any project which would support scientific research , develop the country , or do such projects that do not yield profits in the billions ? ” Still another opined , “Does anybody dare criticize the economic genius Professor [PER Rami  ] ? ” The human rights community was also very supportive , but expressed to [PER Poloff  ] their desire to see additional designations in the near future . 
Upon hearing the news at a meeting with [ORG Post’s TDY Press Attache  ] , a [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] dissident shouted and kissed the officer’s cheek. ------------------------------------- SOME BUSINESSMEN EXPRESS APPREHENSION ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Reaction from Embassy business contacts tended to fall into one of two categories , depending on the contact’s relationship with the regime . 
Apolitical businessmen reported that the designation had sent shockwaves through [MISC Rami’s  ] business partners who were now waiting nervously for any additional shoes to drop . 
Most were concerned about their potential liability due to their business relationship with [PER Makhluf  ] , especially those with assets in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
One contact predicted that if this designation was quickly followed by others , or even rumors of additional ones , [MISC Rami’s  ] foreign and local partners would completely divest out of self-preservation and absorb whatever regime criticism resulted. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a businessman [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued any corruption sanctions that did not include [PER Rami  ] would be meaningless . 
He predicted before the designation that most [MISC Syrians  ] were fully aware of [MISC Rami’s  ] corruption and would secretly applaud it . 
Some regime insiders would attempt to portray the designation as a personal matter between the [MISC Bush  ] administration and the [MISC Asad  ] family . 
While [PER Rami  ] had been expecting the sanction for some time , it was nonetheless important for the [LOC U.S.  ] to send a strong signal . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not think that sanctioning [PER Rami  ] alone would have much of an effect on Syria’s regional or domestic policies . 
More designations and tough implementation would be needed to convince the regime the [LOC U.S.  ] was serious. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A reporter for [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he [ORG DAMASCUS  ] 00000146 003 OF 004 wasn’t sure the details of the designation were well understood by [MISC Syrian  ] businessman and the average [MISC Syrian  ] in the street . 
How would the designation affect foreign investment prospects , for example ? 
Most [MISC Syrian  ] elites assumed that the absence of [MISC Rami’s  ] assets in the [LOC U.S.  ] would make this a moot case . 
If there were ripple effects on [MISC Rami’s  ] business partners , then that might cause people to pay closer attention. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] correspondent working on his own piece regarding [PER Makhluf  ] , passed along that he and other journalists had interviewed a former [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] employee of [MISC Rami’s  ] empire who had [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] knowledge of [MISC Rami’s  ] holdings . 
That source said the designation created many questions that had to be answered before one could assess the impact . 
Would all of [MISC Rami’s  ] partners be sanctionable ? 
Did [PER Rami  ] have to own a majority share in a company before [MISC Americans  ] and others were liable ? 
How would the designation affect ongoing negotiations regarding the sale of [MISC Rami’s  ] share of [MISC Syriatel’s  ] cell concession ? 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] supported the designation and reported that his contacts said that it was overdue . 
He believed more designations were desirable , arguing , “One a week for the next three months would pressure the [MISC Syrians  ] and force them to capitulate.” --------------------------------- WHILE OTHER ELITES ARE DISMISSIVE --------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Elites with a pro-regime bias characterized the designation as a purely symbolic gesture with no tangible economic repercussions . 
They viewed the designation as a feckless personal attack on the [MISC Asad  ] family from a [LOC U.S.  ] Administration with little remaining political leverage over [LOC Syria  ] . 
Regarding Makhluf’s many prominent business partners in [PER Cham Holding  ] , this group’s opinion was that no [MISC Syrian  ] would dare try to divest from [PER Rami  ] -- even if he wanted to -- for fear of being perceived as a coward in the face of [LOC US  ] pressure . 
Consequently , this line of thinking concluded , Makhluf’s designation will result in a “circling of the wagons” around the regime. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] admitted to Econoff that , after hearing about the designation on [PER Al Jazeera  ] , he had run his own name through [ORG Google  ] to see what public information might connect him to [PER Rami  ] . 
Claiming to have no affection for the Makhlufs or the regime , he said he still could not imagine divesting [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and remaining in [LOC Syria.  ] “I love the [LOC U.S.  ] , ” he explained , “but my entire life is in [LOC Syria  ] . 
What am I supposed to do , take my family to the [LOC U.S.  ] and get a job making 5000 dollars a month , or be my own boss and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a better life in [LOC Syria  ] ? ” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] would not put him in legal jeopardy , he finally shrugged his shoulders and said , “Whatever happens to [MISC Rami...happens  ] to all of us.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] assessed [ORG Rami’s  ] designation as an empty , desperate attempt by the outgoing [MISC Bush  ] administration to punish a member of Bashar’s inner circle . 
A marketing expert [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked , “What was the intended message ( of the designation ) ? 
I looked and looked , but could find very [ORG DAMASCUS  ] 00000146 004 OF 004 little . 
The time for such an action was two years ago.” Unless the [LOC U.S.  ] could sanction [ORG Rami’s Byblos Bank  ] ( five percent share ) or convince the [MISC Emiratis  ] to freeze [MISC Rami’s UAE-based  ] assets , he concluded that the designation would have very little teeth and would be regarded by most [MISC Syrians  ] as yet another “wayward arrow from the warped bow of [PER George Bush.”  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] characterized [ORG Rami’s  ] designation as a “mostly symbolic gesture” that would have little impact on the regime’s policies . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Bashar  ] had already put some distance between himself and his cousin and [PER Makhluf  ] had moved a great deal of his personal assets to [LOC Dubai  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] conceded that most [MISC Syrians  ] viewed [PER Rami  ] in a negative light and that his strong-arm business tactics had earned him many enemies . 
He nonetheless believed that a majority of [MISC Syrians  ] , at least the few who had heard about it on [ORG BBC  ] or read about it on the internet , would see the act as a last-ditch effort by the [MISC Bush  ] administration to punish [PER Bashar.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he had had several run-ins with [PER Makhluf  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] during his tenure , but that [PER Rami  ] had learned “the hard way” from [PER Bashar  ] that there was a limit to how much he could get away with on the basis of his family ties . 
He predicted that [PER Bashar  ] would secretly welcome any [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions against corruption , because corruption was rife in [MISC Syrian  ] government and society and had undermined the President’s credibility with the [MISC Syrian  ] people . 
Designating [PER Rami  ] , however , would have very little practical impact because [PER Rami  ] had diversified his many investments and it would be hard to identify majority share interests that he owned. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rami  ] Makhluf’s designation has generated the most reaction among Embassy contacts of any USG action vis-a-vis [LOC Syria  ] in the past three years . 
With increased murmurings casting a pall over the [ORG Arab League  ] summit , uncertainty about what will happen in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and never-ending conspiracy theories about the [LOC Mughniyeh  ] assassination , [ORG Rami’s  ] designation occurred at a time when the [ORG SARG  ] is facing pressure from multiple sources . 
Early indications are that the “business community , ” regardless of political affiliation , is definitely nervous about the potential implications of doing business with [PER Rami  ] .
