<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L HAVANA 000252 SIPDIS SIPDIS E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 03/15/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/KDEM_0.html'>KDEM</a> <a href='/tag/CU_0.html'>CU</a> SUBJECT: XXXXXXXXXXXXNEED A MILLION CUBANS IN THE STREETS Classified By: COM [PER Michael E. Parmly  ] ; Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told COM and Pol-Econ Counselor March 14 that she was withdrawing from her day-to-day running of the [ORG APCS  ] for health reasons and also to focus on the bigger picture . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] objective for the next few months is to plan for how to mobilize a million [MISC Cubans  ] to take to the streets to demand significant political and economic changes . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not provide any specific target date , although [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] acknowledged [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's funeral as one catalyst and the tenth anniversary of a seminal opposition document " The [ORG Nation Belongs  ] to All " ( " [PER La Patria  ] es de [MISC Todos  ] " ) that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] authored , landing them all in prison. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said she was worn down from having to act as leader and also [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] own secretariat for the [ORG APCS  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] last major event being the congress of independent libraries , that concluded at the end of February with a ceremony at our PAO residence . 
The recent release from prison of [ORG APCS  ] Vice-President [PER Rene Gomez Manzano  ] allowed [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] more leeway ; [PER Gomez Manzano  ] will now share the leadership with [PER Felix Bonne Carcases  ] , the [ORG APCS  ] 's other vice-president . 
[ORG MBR  ] would still , inevitably , be reachable to the thousands of members of the opposition , particularly families of political prisoners , who turn to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for help . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] would not continue the same pace of constituent services that she had delivered in the past. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The big picture , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , required time to reflect . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] admired [PER Oswaldo Paya  ] for his ability to think and write and strategize . 
" We have reached a new level of maturity and need to set aside rivalries , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that wherever [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is stopped by total strangers who say they recognize [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and respect what [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stands for . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has developed a network nationwide that , at the right moment , could very realistically put a million [MISC Cubans  ] in the streets . 
The trick was to aim for the mobilization at the exact point when its impact would be the most transformational. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: We agree with [ORG MBR  ] 's main point that the current repertoire of oppositionist activities has reached a certain limit that , while still worthy and necessary , does not add up to a sufficiently combustible mix to bring about regime change . 
In our view , only [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER Oswaldo Paya  ] have the nationwide name recognition to mobilize anything close to a million [MISC Cubans  ] . 
In this context it is encouraging to hear her speak favorably about [PER Paya  ] .
