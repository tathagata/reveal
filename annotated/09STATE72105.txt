USUN may draw on the points in paragraph 2 for the July 23 [ORG Security Council  ] consultations on [MISC UNOCI  ] and/or , as appropriate , experts' discussions of the [MISC French  ] draft resolution ( not yet circulated for comment as of the date of this cable ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[PER Begin  ] points: -- The [LOC United States  ] thanks Ambassador [PER Choi  ] for his briefing . 
We express our continuing support for the invaluable , tireless work being carried out by [MISC UNOCI  ] personnel . 
I would like also to express our appreciation to President Compaore for his facilitation of the [LOC Ouagadougou  ] political process . 
-- We continue to urge the [MISC Ivorian  ] parties to take the necessary steps to ensure that elections are held as scheduled in November . 
Another postponement would be disheartening for the people of [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , who deserve the best from their leaders , and for [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] 's many international friends and partners . 
The [LOC United States  ] echoes the call in the Secretary-General 's report for a detailed , endorsed timeline for key aspects of elections preparations . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] appreciates the critical contribution Licorne is making to stability in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
We note that the discussions are ongoing about Licorne support for the elections and the possibility that [ORG UNMIL  ] may be asked to reinforce [MISC UNOCI  ] . 
The Secretary-General 's June 10 report on [LOC Liberia  ] reported that once [ORG UNMIL  ] has completed the third phase of drawdown , in May 2010 , it will no longer be able to provide such contingency support . 
This lends additional weight to the need for elections to be held as scheduled in November . 
We hope that there will be more certainty by the time the next report is issued . 
-- While it is encouraging that the overall security situation remains stable , we remain concerned about violence , particularly against women and children . 
We echo the Secretary-General 's concerns about the fragile situation and community violence in the western part of the country . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] would appreciate clarification of what is meant in the discussion of disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and dismantling of the militias by " ... the role of the impartial forces in the supervision of weapons surrendered by the demobilized elements needs to be strengthened . 
" -- We would also be interested in additional details on the redeployment of a police officer apiece from [MISC UNOCI  ] and [ORG UNMIL  ] to provide expert advice to [ORG UNOWA  ] on crime and drug trafficking in the sub-region . 
Please confirm that these officers will be under [ORG UNOWA  ] 's command during their redeployment . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] supports extension of [MISC UNOCI  ] 's mandate until January 31 , 2010 , and looks forward to the Secretary-General 's recommendations on an exit strategy for the mission . 
End points .
