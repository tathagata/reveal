Shannon  ] . 
Reason 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) September 25 , 2009 ; 4:00 p.m. ; [LOC New York City  ] , [LOC NY  ] , [LOC USA.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC UNITED STATES  ] U/S [PER Willian J. Burns  ] DAS [PER Christopher J. McMullen Sara Mangiaracina  ] ( WHA Notetaker ) [LOC PERU  ] FM [PER Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde Luis Valdivieso  ] , [MISC Peruvian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] [PER Luis Chavez  ] , [MISC Peruvian  ] Deputy PermRep to the [ORG UN  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) SUMMARY . 
U/S [PER Burns  ] and [MISC Peruvian  ] FM [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] discussed the threat posed to [LOC Peru  ] by a resurgent [ORG Shining Path  ] movement working with narcotraffickers , internal political concerns , and the situation in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
Regarding [LOC Honduras  ] , [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] called for further action from the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG UN  ] ; he also cautioned that President [PER Zelaya  ] 's radical inner circle poses a problem in attempts to craft a viable solution to the crisis . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- -------- [ORG SHINING PATH  ] AND NARCOTRAFFICKERS POSE SERIOUS THREAT --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Highlighting concerns of collaboration between narcotraffickers and mercenary remnants of the [ORG Shining Path  ] ( [ORG SP  ] ) Movement , [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] raised the need for more equipment , training , and greater intelligence sharing . 
Narcotraffickers are using [ORG SP  ] mercenaries to bring chemical precursors into [LOC Peru  ] to produce cocaine , [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] explained . 
He said [LOC Peru  ] would be able to preempt a revival of the [ORG SP  ] threat within two or three years if increased bilateral cooperation were to begin now . 
Otherwise , the [ORG SP  ] movement will increase to 500 core members from the current 150-200. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] specifically requested helicopters and night vision goggles , as well as increased intelligence sharing and security training. ------------------------------------- [ORG BAGUA VIOLENCE:  ] " A TRAGEDY OF ERRORS " ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Touching upon the [LOC Bagua  ] deaths in June , [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] noted the incident was a tragedy , resulting from the lack of adequate information about the seriousness of social discontent in the indigenous community , which ultimately led to the deaths of 34 individuals , 24 of whom were policemen . 
He said [MISC Peruvian  ] forces are better prepared now for any new disturbances , and the dialogue with the indigenous community seems to have defused some of the prior discontent . 
In this regard , he said the [MISC GOP  ] had received threats of further uprisings for September but nothing had materialized , suggesting that the ongoing dialogue between the [MISC GOP  ] and the indigenous community was having a salutary effect. ------------------ UPCOMING ELECTIONS ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] noted President [PER Garcia  ] leaves office in two years but there is no clear front-runner to replace him . 
He said the opposition , including indigenous leader [PER Ollanta Humalla  ] , has not shown much strength in recent polls , indicating that the ruling [ORG APRA  ] party has a good chance of retaining power in the 2011 elections. ----------------------------------------- HONDURAS: " A FRANK AND OPEN CONVERSATION " ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Commenting that while the [ORG USG  ] has acted on principle and custom by not mixing trade issues and politics , [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] stated [PER Micheletti  ] has not felt the full pressure of the [LOC U.S.  ] dissatisfaction with the actions of the de facto regime . 
He indicated more needs to be done , on the part of the [LOC United States  ] as well as the [ORG UN  ] . 
9 . 
( S ) [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] said the situation in [LOC Honduras  ] has grown more complicated since President [PER Zelaya  ] returned . 
He stated that the [MISC Cubans  ] , [MISC Nicaraguans  ] , and [MISC Venezuelans  ] organized [PER Zelaya  ] 's return , hoping to bypass the [MISC OAS/Arias  ] mediation effort and thus force an alternative resolution to the crisis . 
[PER Garcia Belaunde  ] maintained that [PER Zelaya  ] 's original destination was the [ORG UN  ] office ; however , because that building was being observed , he went to the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy instead , which [PER Belaunde  ] said was an astute move on [PER Zelaya  ] 's part . 
[PER Garcia Belaunde  ] commended the [MISC Brazilians  ] for their admirable performance under difficult circumstances. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] also expressed concern over the resolution of the crisis , stating that while [PER Zelaya  ] seems willing to accept the [LOC San  ] [PER Jose Accords  ] ( [ORG SJA  ] ) , neither his VP nor his FM would likely do so . 
He said [PER Zelaya  ] 's weak personality is dominated by stronger forces around him , which is why FM [LOC Rodas  ] has called for the [ORG SJA  ] to require not only the return of [PER Zelaya  ] to office , but also the members of his cabinet. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] concluded by expressing [MISC Peruvian  ] support for the proposed [ORG OAS  ] mission to [LOC Honduras  ] . 
He indicated the [MISC Panamanians  ] need to be less vocal publicly in their approach , adding that the [ORG OAS  ] mission 's success would depend upon [PER Micheletti  ] 's ability to act independently of other sectors ( e.g. , the military , private sector , et al . 
) , which [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] thought might be problematic .
