( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
In his December 3 meeting with [ORG Israel Defense Intelligence  ] Director [PER Yadlin  ] , Representative [PER Robert Wexler  ] ( [ORG D-Florida  ] ) referred to his previous meeting with [ORG Likud Party  ] leader [PER Netanyahu  ] ( reftel ) and asked for [PER Yadlin  ] 's assessment of the possibility of [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinian  ] moving forward on the basis of an " economic peace . 
" [PER Yadlin  ] said [LOC Israel  ] 's relations with the [MISC Palestinians  ] need time ; the next [MISC Israeli  ] Prime Minister and perhaps the next [ORG PA President  ] will need the time to build trust . 
Trying to move directly to a solution will result in violence as in 2000 . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said the [MISC Palestinians  ] have established two entities . 
[PER Abbas  ] and [PER Fayyad  ] rule the [LOC West Bank  ] with [LOC Israel  ] 's support , while [ORG Hamas  ] has established a terrorist entity in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Yadlin  ] stressed that [LOC Israel  ] is on the right track in the [LOC West Bank  ] , while he advocates taking a " much tougher " approach to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said [LOC Israel  ] can find [ORG Hamas  ] officials where they live and work in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
If the firing of rockets and mortars from [LOC Gaza  ] continues , the [ORG IDF  ] will " use this card , " i.e. resume targetted assassinations , in order to " change the paradigm . 
" End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Representative [PER Robert Wexler  ] , accompanied by staffer [PER Jonathan Katz  ] , control officer and [MISC PolCouns  ] called on [ORG Israel Defense Intelligence  ] ( [ORG IDI  ] ) Director Major General [PER Amos Yadlin  ] in the Kirya December 3 . 
Noting that he had just come from a meeting with [ORG Likud Party  ] leader [PER Bibi Netanyahu  ] , Congressman [PER Wexler  ] noted the [PER Netanyahu  ] is talking about an economic plan for developing the [LOC West Bank  ] , while Prime Minister [PER Fayyad  ] says the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] dispute is not economic in nature . 
Proceeding from the assumption that [PER Netanyahu  ] is likely to form the next [MISC Israeli  ] government , [PER Wexler  ] asked whether [PER Yadlin  ] thought it would be possible to marry [PER Netanyahu  ] 's economic plan with [PER Fayyad  ] 's pragmatic approach of getting " deliverables " and reducing the [ORG IDF  ] 's role. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Yadlin  ] replied that the [MISC Palestinians  ] are only [LOC Israel  ] 's number four threat in the [ORG IDI  ] 's assessment , following [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
Although the [MISC Palestinians  ] are not the [ORG IDI  ] 's top concern , [PER Yadlin  ] said he would answer the question by noting that it will take time to marry [PER Netanyahu  ] 's approach to [PER Fayyad  ] 's . 
If the parties attempt to move straight to resolving the conflict , the attempt will collapse and result in violence as in the start of the Second Intifada after the 2000 [PER Camp David  ] summit . 
The key question is how can the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] control terrorism . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said the [ORG USSC General Dayton  ] is doing " a very good job " of training the [ORG PA Security Forces  ] , but [PER Yadlin  ] quoted [ORG Dayton  ] as saying that the PASF will need three to five years to build its counter-terrorist capabilities , including a functioning justice system. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Yadlin  ] said the [ORG IDF  ] is out of the [LOC Jenin  ] area unless it receives reports of a " ticking bomb . 
" The [ORG PA  ] , however , is ignoring [LOC Gaza  ] and [PER Fayyad  ] insists on paying salaries in [LOC Gaza  ] , which helps [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said this is a " big mistake . 
" [PER Yadlin  ] noted that the [MISC Palestinians  ] have created two entities . 
President [PER Abbas  ] and [PER Fayyad  ] condemn terrorism and stress that [MISC Palestinian  ] national goals can be achieved through negotiations . 
They rule in the [LOC West Bank  ] with [LOC Israel  ] 's assistance . 
In [LOC Gaza  ] , a terrorist organization is in power and [ORG Hamas  ] preaches that [MISC Palestinian  ] aspirations can be achieved through terrorism . 
This division provides [LOC Israel  ] with a " historic opportunity " to prove that Hamas' approach will fail. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Yadlin  ] insisted that [LOC Israel  ] must not withdraw from the [LOC West Bank  ] too soon or it would pave the way for a new wave of suicide bombings inside [LOC Israel  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] 's good security situation is a direct result of the [ORG IDF  ] and [PER Shin Bet  ] 's sustained effort to destroy terrorism in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
This efforts continues every night of the year . 
It will take time to build trust between the next [MISC Israeli  ] prime minister and perhaps the next [ORG PA  ] president as well . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said he is satisfied that [LOC Israel  ] is now on the right track in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
The [ORG IDF  ] has figured out how to remove obstacles that affect the [MISC Palestinian  ] economy while leaving in place the means to ensure [LOC Israel  ] 's security . 
In [LOC Gaza  ] , however , [LOC Israel  ] needs to be " much tougher . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Congressman [PER Wexler  ] asked why [PER Fayyad  ] wants to send money to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Yadlin  ] said [PER Fayyad  ] fears that if he does not , [ORG Hamas  ] will bring in money from [LOC Iran  ] , but [PER Yadlin  ] added that this concern was misplaced . 
Hamas' control of [LOC Gaza  ] provides an opportunity . 
Since the terrorists are now the government , [LOC Israel  ] knows which terrorist is sitting in what office and where their homes are . 
They have come out of hiding and into TEL AVIV 00002745 002 OF 002 the open , so the [ORG IDF  ] can identify and find them . 
[PER Yadlin  ] warned that if the shelling of [MISC Israeli  ] communities from [LOC Gaza  ] continues , [LOC Israel  ] can " use this card " against [ORG Hamas  ] . 
It will " change the paradigm , " he concluded. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment . 
While [PER Yadlin  ] did not use the phrase " targeted assassinations , " it was clear from the context that he is advocating this approach to countering the threat from [ORG Hamas  ] . 
It was also clear that he strongly opposes those in the GOI who advocate maintaining a base of currency flow into [LOC Gaza  ] . 
End comment. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
