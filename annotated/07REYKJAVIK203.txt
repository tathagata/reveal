( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC Iceland  ] 's Minister for Foreign Affairs announced on June 27 that her ministry will conduct an inquiry into allegations of [ORG CIA  ] detainee flights transiting [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The announcement comes in response to the June 27 [ORG Council of Europe  ] discussion of [ORG Special Rapporteur  ] [PER Dick Marty  ] 's latest report , and statements by [LOC Iceland  ] 's leading opposition parliamentarian , who attended the session in [LOC Strasbourg  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] officials have tried to minimize the inquiry 's significance in conversations with [ORG Post  ] , describing it as " an exercise in transparency " and an attempt to take the issue away from the opposition . 
They report that the inquiry 's form and scope are still yet to be defined , though [LOC Iceland  ] 's ambassador in [LOC Strasbourg  ] has approached the [ORG COE Human Rights and Legal Affairs Committee  ] for assistance . 
[ORG Post  ] has not been officially approached by the [ORG MFA  ] on the topic ; we would expect any such inquiry closer to the opening of the new parliamentary session in October . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On June 27 , [MISC Icelandic  ] state television 's evening news covered the [ORG Council of Europe  ] ( [ORG COE  ] ) Parliamentary Assembly ( [ORG PACE  ] ) session on [ORG COE Special Rapporteur  ] [PER Dick Marty  ] 's most recent report on alleged [ORG CIA  ] activities in [ORG COE  ] member states . 
The report prominently featured comments by [ORG Left-Green Party Chair  ] [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] , who was in attendance . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] , the head of [LOC Iceland  ] 's largest opposition party , said that while he was not surprised by most of the report 's findings , he was nonetheless concerned about the finding that [ORG NATO  ] had purportedly authorized such measures in October 2001 . 
He called for the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] to report on [LOC Iceland  ] 's role in any such [ORG NATO  ] decision. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In response , Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] ( traveling in [LOC Africa  ] ) instructed the [ORG MFA  ] to issue a press release that evening announcing that in light of the report 's findings , she had decided that " landings by certain aircraft at [LOC Keflavik  ] and/or [ORG Reykjavik Airports  ] should be taken under closer examination . 
" The press release further stated that the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] had fully answered all questions presented to it by the [PER Marty  ] inquiry , and that the [ORG MFA  ] " has no knowledge of any flights operated by the [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence services carrying prisoners or suspected terrorists in [MISC Icelandic  ] airspace or at [LOC Keflavik Airport  ] . 
The [ORG U.S. Government  ] has never requested overflight or landing permission for such aircraft . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] Counselor Finnur [PER Thor Birgisson  ] , who drafted the press release for the [ORG Ministry 's Political Department  ] , told [PER PolOff  ] on June 29 that things " are still at a very early stage " regarding the [ORG MFA  ] 's plans for looking into the issue . 
[ORG MFA Defense Department  ] Counselor [PER Fridrik Jonsson  ] , also present at the meeting , was quick to add that the announcement was mostly for domestic consumption as a move to " clip the wings " of [ORG LG Chair  ] [PER Sigfusson  ] before he had an opportunity to create further problems for the Minister . 
[PER Birgisson  ] agreed , saying the inquiry is the [ORG Ministry 's  ] effort to be seen as transparent on the matter . 
Questions may eventually be directed to the [ORG USG  ] , but for now " the important part is to be seen as doing something . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG MFA  ] 's Counselor for [ORG Human Rights  ] reiterated this message in a meeting with [PER PolOff  ] on July 3 , describing the ministry 's effort as " an exercise in transparency . 
" She drew [PER PolOff  ] 's attention to the specific language in the press release ( " examination " vice " investigation " ) , underscoring that the [ORG MFA  ] had no plans nor authority to conduct a formal investigation in a legal sense . 
She further reported that she had just finished speaking to [LOC Iceland  ] 's ambassador in [LOC Strasbourg  ] per FM [PER Gisladottir  ] 's instructions to approach the [ORG PACE Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee  ] for assistance in formulating the inquiry . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's impression is that the committee 's handling of the matter thus far has been [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000203 002 OF 002 " puzzling , " and the [ORG Ministry does  ] not hold high expectations that it will get much useful information from these discussions . 
( The FM 's [ORG Political Advisor  ] noted in the press on July 12 that the [ORG MFA  ] did not expect a substantive response in [LOC Strasbourg  ] until September , " after people 's summer holidays . 
" ) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Post  ] has not been formally approached by the [ORG MFA  ] on the matter thus far , and [ORG MFA  ] officials have said they do not know if or when that might happen . 
The [ORG Icelandic Government  ] last asked for a formal [ORG U.S. Government  ] response on the topic in fall 2005 , and Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] ( then Foreign Minister ) has on multiple occasions declared himself satisfied with Secretary [PER Rice  ] 's statement regarding detainee issues SIPDIS on December 5 , 2005 ( reftels ) . 
Embassy [ORG Reykjavik  ] last received a press inquiry on this issue in October 2006 , at which time we declined comment . 
Press reporting so far has been straightforward , though an editorial cartoon in leading daily Morgunbladid on July 4 lampooned the Foreign Minister 's intent to conduct the inquiry , depicting her at the airport with a pair of binoculars looking for planes with " prisoner stripes . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Comment: FM [PER Gisladottir  ] is in a difficult situation stemming from her party 's past criticism of the [ORG GOI  ] on the issue of detainee flights . 
During the campaign for the May 2007 parliamentary elections , she committed herself and her party to transparency and cooperation with the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) on foreign affairs and as such will need to demonstrate an effort to investigate the issue . 
Her quick decision to announce a further investigation of alleged detainee flights is a direct result of this pressure from her erstwhile allies in opposition , the [MISC Left-Greens  ] . 
Her announcement will effectively quash the issue until the [ORG Althingi  ] comes back into session in October . 
At that point , however , opposition parliamentarians will likely use the issue to snipe at the government and push for some results from the inquiry . 
We anticipate that press inquiries to the Embassy , if any , will ask us to comment on the allegations in the [ORG COE  ] reports as they pertain to [LOC Iceland  ] and to outline our response to any [ORG Icelandic Government  ] query on the matter . 
In such an event [ORG Post  ] intends to coordinate our response with appropriate [LOC Washington  ] offices .
