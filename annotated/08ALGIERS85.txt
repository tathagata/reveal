( C ) [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Bajolet  ] told the Ambassador on January 23 that he and the [MISC French  ] government are worried that [LOC Algeria  ] is gradually headed towards more instability , but they do not see an alternative to [PER Bouteflika  ] 's remaining in power for a third term beginning in 2009 . 
[PER Bajolet  ] , who served here in the 1980s , said that the [MISC French  ] strategic interest in [LOC Algeria  ] above all is stability and economic growth . 
Increased pressure on [MISC Algerians  ] to emigrate to [LOC France  ] because of a lack of opportunities in [LOC Algeria  ] weighs heavily on [MISC French  ] political sensitivities and ultimately on the social ties between the two countries . 
The [MISC French  ] government , he said , sees few positive developments in [LOC Algeria  ] now: -- municipalities , who are closest to the population , have no authority or resources to address needs locally ; -- there is an inability throughout the government to make hard decisions ; [PER Bajolet  ] called it a kind of immobilism ; -- the political parties have little space and seem ready to make short-term deals at long-term political loss ; -- public interest in the formal political system has diminished sharply , as seen in the two 2007 elections ; -- the business climate is difficult and not improving ; and investment and job creation are lacking ( [PER Bajolet  ] noted that a [MISC French  ] business association had prepared a white paper that detailed problems [MISC French  ] companies face in [LOC Algeria  ] and how to recitify them . 
[PER Bajolet  ] observed that the Interior Minister [PER Zerhouni  ] and the [MISC Algerian  ] government were anxious that it not be released publicly . 
) ; -- corruption , all the way up to the [PER Bouteflika  ] brothers , has reached a new level and is interfering with economic development ; BOUTEFLIKA'S THIRD TERM AMBITIONS --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Bajolet  ] said he understood that the security service leadership has given its approval for the constitution to be changed so that [PER Bouteflika  ] can run for election again in 2009 . 
[PER Bajolet  ] stated that [PER Bouteflika  ] 's health is better and that he might live several more years . 
His improved health and activity has given him more leverage over the army , he speculated . 
That said , [PER Bajolet  ] also opined that the consensus within the top security leadership to support a third term for [PER Bouteflika  ] resulted in part from the widespread view that [PER Bouteflika  ] will not finish his third term due to his his health problems . 
The relationship between the security services and [PER Bouteflika  ] is still ticklish . 
For example , the [MISC French  ] have concluded that the security services encouraged Minister of Veteran Affairs [PER Cherif Abbas  ] to criticize [PER Sarkozy  ] on the eve of the [MISC French  ] president 's visit in order to embarrass [PER Bouteflika  ] by provoking the [MISC French  ] to cancel the trip. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bajolet  ] said the [MISC French  ] are being extremely careful about what they say to the [MISC Algerians  ] about changing the constituton and enabling [PER Bouteflika  ] to run for the third term that everyone understands he will win . 
[PER Bajolet  ] sensed that the [MISC Algerians  ] clearly floated the idea publicly again right before [PER Sarkozy  ] 's visit in December to test whether the [MISC French  ] president would advise against it . 
He intentionally did not do so . 
[PER Bajolet  ] observed that the [MISC French  ] see no obvious successor to [PER Bouteflika  ] . 
Former Prime Minister [PER Hamrouche  ] , he noted , speaks of reform but the [MISC French  ] are unsure whether he could actually push through a reform program . 
Former Prime Minister [PER Ouyahia  ] , they believe , is yet another apparatchik and has little popularity in the country . 
[PER Bajolet  ] concluded that without an obvious successor , pushing against [PER Bouteflika  ] simply opens up new sources of instability . 
Instead , the [MISC French  ] have decided that the best message for them to deliver is that they are neutral on the issue of [PER Bouteflika  ] 's third term but that the government needs to start addressing [LOC Algeria  ] 's serious economic and political problems . 
( [PER Bajolet  ] is particularly interested in decentralization , for example . 
) SECURITY -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bajolet  ] expressed great concern about the security situation and asked numerous questions about our latest warden message . 
Our recommendations that [MISC Americans  ] avoid [LOC ALGIERS  ] 00000085 002 OF 002 [MISC Western  ] schools had put him in a difficult spot , he noted , since there are two official [MISC French  ] schools in [LOC Algiers  ] . 
[PER Bajolet  ] asserted that [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] in the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) appears to target the [MISC Algerian  ] government mainly and targets foreigners only as a means to embarrass the government . 
The Ambassador disagreed , expressing his view that [ORG AQIM  ] is targeting both but with different goals . 
It targets the [ORG GoA  ] to embarrass it and as a means of retaliating for [ORG AQIM  ] losses . 
It targets foreigners to drive them out of [LOC Algeria  ] ( and ultimately help destabilize the [ORG GoA  ] ) . 
[PER Bajolet  ] noted that there are multiple [MISC French  ] vulnerabilities , including [MISC French  ] cultural centers around [LOC Algeria  ] and scattered diplomatic residences . 
So far , however , the [MISC Algerian  ] security services have handled threats to the [MISC French  ] appropriately and have , he claimed , kept the [MISC French  ] authorities informed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Bajolet  ] opined that external pressure on the government here to try to force it to drop the [PER Bouteflika  ] third-term idea will not compel the [ORG GoA  ] to drop it . 
Instead , he thought , it would merely make working with the [MISC Algerians  ] more difficult , and the [MISC French  ] now perceive that on both security and economic/social issues they must work with [LOC Algiers  ] . 
He readily admitted that the medium- and long-term outlook here is not good unless the government really begins to fix the economy and the political system . 
He was not confident that it would , but he had no clear idea of what to do in that case .
