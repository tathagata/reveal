Godec  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] approached Ambassador and Pol/EconCouns [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to share with us [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the Ambassador gave him assurances that we would . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared a rare first-hand account of corruption from several years ago in which [PER Ben Ali  ] himself was described as asking for a 50 percent stake in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] private university . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ BOOK TITLE REDACTED ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On the margins of a networking event for aspiring and successful social entrepreneurs [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The book is extremely critical of the [PER Ben Ali  ] regime for , among other things , the " duality " between official discourse and the reality on the ground . 
Specifically [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] points to the " stifling " of political liberties and " omnipotent " controls on the media . 
He also charges that freedom of association is " illusory " and assesses that " the rule of law is more fiction than reality . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------------- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked that the US Embassy follow his case [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ; the Ambassador assured him that we would do so . 
Pol/EconCouns reviewed [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] some of the accounts of life in prison that we have heard from released political prisoners ; XXXXXXXXXXXX. ---------------------- Tale of [ORG Corruption I:  ] The [LOC French Connection  ] ? ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Asked whether he had also been in touch with other western embassies , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that he had not . 
He had avoided reaching out to the [MISC French  ] , in particular , arguing that Ambassador Degallaix is seen as [PER Ben Ali  ] 's Ambassador to [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] , not vice versa . 
In addition , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] alleged that the GOT has improperly given Ambassador Degallaix a villa , which is registered in his daughter 's name , on rue [PER Sidi Dhrif  ] , near the President 's own residence . 
He did not offer any evidence of this alleged corruption or explain how this knowledge came to him . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] -------------------------------------------- Tale of Corruption [PER II: Ben Ali  ] Seeks 50 Percent Stake [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] likened corruption to a dangerous cancer that is spreading in [LOC Tunisia  ] , spurred on by the corrupt practices of President [PER Ben Ali  ] and his extended family . 
When Pol/EconCouns responded by noting that most tales of corruption that we hear concern " The Family " rather than the President himself , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recounted an incident in which [PER Ben Ali  ] himself was involved . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Ben Ali  ] came off as " very uneducated " in the meeting , failing to grasp some of the key points [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] about the virtues [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Ben Ali  ] abruptly told him that he wanted a 50-50 stake in the enterprise . 
Fearful of responding in the negative , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he " played dumb , " pretending not to understand the President 's proposition. ------------------------------- Other Run-ins with " The Family " ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also reviewed the difficulties that lead to the closure [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] How [PER Suha Arafat  ] Got [LOC Into Trouble  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also offered a theory as to what was behind the GOT 's decision to revoke [PER Suha Arafat  ] 's [MISC Tunisian  ] citizenship in 2007 . 
( [PER Note: Reftel  ] also reports on this incident . 
) He said that he had heard that [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] at that time had been scheming to marry off an 18 year-old niece ( NFI ) to UAE Prime Minister and [ORG Dubai Ruler  ] Sheik [PER Mohamed bin Rashid al-Maktoum  ] , one of whose wives is the half-sister of the King of [LOC Jordan  ] . 
According to this rumor , [PER Suha Arafat  ] warned [MISC Jordanian  ] Queen [PER Rania  ] about [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] 's plans . 
Word of [PER Arafat  ] 's intervention got back to the [MISC Tunisian  ] First Lady , who turned against [PER Arafat  ] and soon forced her out of [LOC Tunisia.  ] --------------------- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is extremely well respected and considered an upstanding member of the community . 
While we might doubt the veracity of some of the rumors that he shared with us , we have no reason to doubt his account of his conversation with President [PER Ben Ali  ] , in which he described the President as seeking a 50 percent stake in his private university . 
We routinely hear allegations of corruption , and such allegations are inherently difficult to prove . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] anecdote strikes us as credible . 
It is also significant in that it implicates [PER Ben Ali  ] himself , while so many other reported incidents of corruption involve his extended family. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
