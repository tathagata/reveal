Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Deputy Secretary [PER Zoellick  ] told [ORG FM Amorim October  ] 6 that the international community needs to engage strongly in [LOC Bolivia  ] during the elections to guarantee transparency , and must remain engaged following elections to guarantee some degree of governability . 
[ORG Amorim  ] urged [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility in dealing with [PER Evo Morales  ] , something the Deputy Secretary said would be difficult to do given [MISC Morales'  ] ties [ORG SIPDIS  ] to the drug trade . 
[ORG FM Amorim  ] said he would look at using President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG PT Party  ] 's ties with leftists to urge the [MISC Sandinistas  ] and others in [LOC Nicaragua  ] to engage with [PER Lewites  ] and put pressure on [PER Ortega  ] . 
He urged that [LOC Valdez  ] 's replacement in [LOC Haiti  ] be from [LOC South America  ] . 
The Deputy Secretary agreed that [ORG Amorim  ] 's proposals for broadening [ORG SIPDIS U.S.-Brazilian  ] dialogue to the areas of science , technology , education and fighting racism were worth looking into , but he also proposed deepening the bilateral dialogue on democracy and development by identifying areas where democracy and development intersect . 
[ORG FM Amorim  ] pledged to take action on that proposal . 
End Summary ------- [LOC BOLIVIA  ] ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] noted that there had been much concern expressed about the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] during the September 29-30 Summit of the [MISC Community of South American Nations  ] ( [ORG CASA  ] ) . 
He said that all of the leaders attending the summit agreed that postponing the [MISC Bolivian  ] elections would be a bad idea . 
[PER Amorim  ] said he believed that [LOC Quiroga  ] is currently in the lead , but there remained the possibility that the vote would end up in a virtual draw , leaving [LOC Bolivia  ] in a [MISC German-like  ] situation , but without the strong institutions that [LOC Germany  ] has . 
The Foreign Minister asserted that if [PER Morales  ] wins a plurality , it would be almost impossible to deny him the presidency. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Regarding [PER Morales  ] , [ORG FM Amorim  ] said that through [MISC Brazilian  ] engagement with [PER Morales  ] , he appears to be changing a little and is tending toward moderation except when there occur instances of street mobilization or other popular unrest . 
Opining that [PER Morales  ] and his party are not as far left as radicals such as [PER Quispe  ] , [PER Amorim  ] said that when there is popular mobilization on any issue , [PER Morales  ] has to radicalize to prevent the more radical parties from outflanking him . 
The Foreign Minister added that President [PER Lula  ] has had a positive influence on [PER Morales  ] during times of crisis. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] might need to think about being more flexible with [PER Morales  ] , to which the Deputy Secretary replied that it would be hard to be more flexible [ORG SIPDIS  ] with someone that has the kind of ties to " Cocaleros " that [PER Morales  ] maintains , and given uncertainties about [MISC Morales'  ] commitment to democracy . 
Noting that much of the coca grown in [LOC Bolivia  ] passes through [LOC Brazil  ] , and that it has fomented a drug problem for [LOC Brazil  ] , he said [MISC Morales'  ] ties to the cocaleros should be of concern in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] responded that " There are cocaleros and then there are cocaleros , " and added that [LOC Brazil  ] was addressing the coca problem by looking for ways to buy more from [LOC Bolivia  ] as part of the crop substitution process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary told [PER Amorim  ] that in the short term , [LOC Bolivia  ] needs a strong international presence during the election to guarantee a degree of transparency . 
In addition , the international community needs to work with [LOC Bolivia  ] after the election to guarantee some degree of governability . 
He said it would be useful for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , among others , to work with the [ORG OAS  ] to figure out how to create a political compact to run the country . 
At the same time , Bolivians need to address the same kinds of issues , including , for example , what the role of a constitutional assembly should be. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG FM Amorim  ] said he believed that kind of discussion could be useful , but added that the international community had to act very carefully in [LOC Bolivia  ] because there is growing radicalization on all sides . 
In addition , there is some sensitivity in [LOC Bolivia  ] regarding the [ORG OAS  ] because the head of the [ORG OAS  ] is a [MISC Chilean  ] . 
He noted that [LOC Brazil  ] is moving cautiously and that he had personally worked to ensure that [MISC Petrobras'  ] investment disputes are not pressed for the moment. --------- [LOC NICARAGUA  ] --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Much of the Deputy Secretary 's presentation on [LOC Nicaragua  ] was new to FM [PER Amorim  ] , who appeared not to be aware of the extent of [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG PLC  ] 's effort to undermine the legitimate government of the country . 
However , he did note that President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) had good relations with the [MISC Sandinistas  ] and other leftist parties and he could ask prominent [ORG PT  ] members to talk with the leftists in [LOC Nicaragua  ] and thereby engage with [PER Lewites  ] and put additional pressure on [PER Ortega.  ] ----------- POTUS VISIT ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Foreign Minister said he wanted to make sure something valuable could be extracted from the upcoming visit of the President to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He suggested creating additional bilateral working groups on science , technology , education and fighting racism . 
He also suggested looking for ways to increase bilateral cooperation on [LOC Africa  ] , adding his hope that cooperation would go beyond [LOC Guinea Bissau  ] . 
He then noted the creation of the [LOC IBSA  ] ( [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] ) fund that promotes cooperation on development programs in different parts of the world . 
[PER Amorim  ] said it might be useful if the [LOC U.S.  ] could find a way to cooperate with the [LOC IBSA  ] fund , and so diminish the [MISC South-South  ] aspect of its work and make the effort look more like that of large multi-racial democracies cooperating on development. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary said he believed the [ORG FM  ] 's ideas were interesting and worth looking at . 
Noting that he had earlier planted some seeds on bilateral issues with Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] and President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG International Affairs Advisor Garcia  ] , the Deputy Secretary said he wanted to share them with [ORG FM Amorim  ] . 
He noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had started strategic talks with [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] , and it struck him as odd that the [LOC U.S.  ] strategic dialogue with [LOC Brazil  ] lagged behind that with [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
Given that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are democracies that share common political values , the two countries should be able to do more. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) One way to enhance dialogue is to broaden discussions as the [ORG FM  ] had suggested . 
Another way , the Deputy Secretary pointed out , is to deepen dialogue around several [ORG SIPDIS  ] specific topics centered on democracy and development in the [ORG Americas  ] . 
With new leadership at the [ORG OAS  ] and [ORG IDB  ] , and with the Summit of the [ORG Americas  ] approaching , this might be a good time to start deepening our dialogue. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Specifically , the Foreign and Finance Ministries of the two countries could meet to discuss how democracy and development issues intersect and use the intersections as a point of departure . 
[ORG FM Amorim  ] said that was a good idea and said he would work to identify appropriate interlocutors and determine when such discussions could take place. ----- [LOC HAITI  ] ----- 12 . 
( C ) [PER FM Amorim  ] told the Deputy Secretary that the replacement for [PER Juan Gabriel Valdez  ] should be someone from [LOC South America  ] in order to maintain the link between the political and military side of [ORG UN  ] engagement in [LOC Haiti.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC Brazil  ] Side: Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] [LOC U.S.  ] Side: The Deputy Secretary Ambassador [PER Danilovich NSC Senior Director Shannon  ] D Chief of Staff [PER Padilla  ] 14 . 
( U ) The Deputy Secretary 's party has cleared this message .
