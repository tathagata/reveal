He called for new elections to produce leaders who would work for [LOC Iraq  ] 's interests .

" END SUMMARY 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senator [PER Lieberman  ] , along with the Ambassador , [LOC Consul General  ] , codel staff members and ConGen staff met [ORG MbR  ] at the [LOC Zabeel Palace  ] in [LOC Dubai  ] on 29 May . 
Joining [ORG MbR  ] were [PER Mohammad  ] al-Gergawi , his principal aide and [LOC UAE  ] Minister for [ORG Cabinet Affairs  ] ; Major General [PER Dhahi Khalfan  ] al-Tamim , Commander of the [LOC Dubai  ] Police ; Brigadier [PER Mohammad  ] al-Qemzi , Director of the [ORG Dubai General Department of State Security  ] ; Sheikh [PER Ahmed  ] bin [PER Saeed al-Maktoum  ] , head of [LOC Dubai  ] Civil aviation and [ORG Emirates Airlines  ] ; and a number of [ORG MbR  ] 's sons , including Sheikh [MISC Rashid  ] bin [PER Mohammad  ] , Sheikh [PER Mohammad  ] 's eldest son ; and Sheikh [MISC Hamdan  ] bin [PER Mohammad  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Dubai Executive Council  ] and Sheikh [PER Mohammad  ] 's heir apparent . 
Iraq: Any plan B ? ------------------ 3 . 
( C ) [ORG MbR  ] restated the [LOC UAE  ] 's support for the [LOC US  ] in the region , noting " the [LOC UAE  ] is the only country that is 100 percent with the [LOC US  ] . 
" [ORG MbR  ] said [LOC UAE  ] support for the [LOC US  ] effort remained firm , but asked what is " plan B " should the current [LOC US  ] approach not stabilize [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] quoted the Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff  ] as saying " plan B is to make plan A work . 
" Alternative Approaches: New Elections in [LOC Iraq  ] ? --------------------------------------------- - 4 . 
( S ) Asked by the Senator for his advice on steps to move the situation in [LOC Iraq  ] forward , [ORG MbR  ] commented that he has little confidence in [MISC Iraqi  ] PM al [PER Maliki  ] , and believes his loyalties lie elsewhere , i.e . 
[LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MbR  ] suggested the way ahead would be improved by new elections , which he believes would now yield a better leader who is loyal to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] noted he thought that al [PER Maliki  ] and his allies would oppose new elections . 
The Problem of [PER Al-Sadr  ] ---------------------- 5 . 
( S ) [ORG MbR  ] said that at the moment [PER Muqtada al-Sadr  ] is the single most powerful person in [LOC Iraq  ] ; the [LOC US  ] should act against him , i.e. arrest and imprison him . 
Asked if new elections might not yield a al-Sadr victory , [ORG MbR  ] made clear he thought [MISC Sunnis  ] would now turn out in large numbers and that al-Sadr would not be able to win - were the election fair . 
( Comment: Reflecting commonly-held thinking by [LOC UAE  ] seniors , he clearly implied that al-Maliki had been elected through rigging in the last [MISC Iraqi  ] vote . 
End comment . 
) Progress in [LOC Anbar Province: Look  ] to the Tribes --------------------------------------------- - 6 . 
( C ) Commenting on the improved security situation in western [LOC Iraq  ] , [ORG MbR  ] voiced strong support for closer cooperation with the tribal sheikhs . 
As has been proven , if the tribal leaders can be co-opted to work with the [LOC US  ] , they have the ability to defeat or suppress [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] . 
He stressed the importance of working with the tribes without regard to their being [PER Sunni  ] or Shia . 
Sheikh [PER Mohammad  ] on [LOC Iran  ] ----------------------- 7 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Lieberman  ] asked [ORG MbR  ] for his views on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC US  ] policies vis-`-vis [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MbR  ] stated [LOC Iran  ] is a large country with great ambitions , a historic sense of its importance , and a desire to dominate the region culturally and politically . 
[LOC Iran  ] has a long-term strategy for the region , and would like to recreate the [LOC Persian Empire  ] and spread [PER Shi'a Islam  ] throughout area . 
Rehearsing themes often heard by [LOC US  ] senior visitors , [ORG MbR  ] said [LOC Iran  ] " can make trouble throughout the region " if it is [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000355 002.2 OF 003 provoked . 
While he suggested that [LOC Iran  ] is the cause of the deteriorating situations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , he also noted that [LOC Iran  ] could make the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , for example , " explode " should chose to do so . 
[LOC Iran  ] Promises a [ORG Peaceful Nuclear Program  ] ---------------------------------------- 8 . 
( C ) [ORG MbR  ] told the Senator that the [LOC UAE  ] does not want [LOC Iran  ] to acquire nuclear weapons . 
He said that during the recent visit of [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to the [LOC UAE  ] that the [MISC Iranians  ] had promised their nuclear program is only to help meet domestic energy needs -- quipping " how much can we believe what the [MISC Iranians  ] say is another question . 
" [ORG MbR  ] seemed perplexed about the work of the [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors and believed that they could provide an objective view of the program . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] reminded [ORG MbR  ] that [LOC Iran  ] has blocked the inspectors and they have only been able to conclude that [LOC Iran  ] will have the capacity to produce enriched uranium on a sufficient scale to either generate power or create a nuclear weapon within the next three to eight years . 
Negotiations - the [ORG Best Course of Action  ] ---------------------------------------- 9 . 
( C ) [ORG MbR  ] and the Senator briefly discussed the recent meeting in [LOC Baghdad  ] between the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MbR  ] saw this as a very positive move , recommending negotiations as the best way forward with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that threatening [LOC Iran  ] encourages the [MISC Iranian  ] leaders to be defiant . 
[MISC Iranians  ] are proud and the current extremist leadership would not only endure , but benefit from an attack by the [LOC US  ] . 
Such attacks would ensure the continuing power of the current government ( note: presumable by rallying all [MISC Iranians  ] behind it in the face of a foreign enemy ) . 
10 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Lieberman  ] commented would maintain the stick even while it considered the carrot , and that the two carrier battle groups now in the [LOC Gulf  ] were sending a message to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MbR  ] responded that everyone in the region knows the [LOC US  ] is powerful and can fight two wars simultaneously . 
He said that part of the problem " is the way you ( the [LOC US  ] ) talk . 
" After making a demand , " you ( the [LOC US  ] ) should take two steps back before your next action . 
" Everyone in the region needs to avoid the dangerous cycle of action and reaction . 
The [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] problem has worsened because actions are followed immediately by reactions without thought . 
11 . 
( S ) Brigadier [PER Mohammad  ] al-Qemzi , who heads [ORG State Security  ] in [LOC Dubai  ] added that the [MISC Iranians  ] are traditionally great game players . 
He said that the [LOC US  ] should play the game of negotiation and diplomacy ( to contain [LOC Iran  ] ) rather than engaging in hostilities . 
Al-Qemzi recommended working for the longer term , and believes that there will be a cultural and leadership change in [LOC Iran  ] -- over time , [LOC Iran  ] would change for the better . 
[ORG UAE Support for Counter Proliferation  ] ------------------------------------- 12 . 
( S ) [ORG MbR  ] reiterated the [LOC UAE  ] 's continued support of the [MISC US'  ] counter proliferation efforts in the region . 
Brigadier al-Qemzi added that the previous day and in the previous week the [LOC UAE  ] had stopped [MISC Iranian  ] vessels at [LOC US  ] request suspected of carrying goods proscribed by the [ORG UN  ] sanctions regime . 
The [LOC UAE  ] , he said , would continue to work with us to stringently enforce [ORG UN  ] sanctions . 
[LOC Dubai  ] , the Region , and [ORG Transformation via Education  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ 13 . 
( C ) Noting [LOC Dubai  ] appeared to be a model of tolerance and opportunity for the region , Senator [PER Lieberman  ] asked [ORG MbR  ] to talk about his goals for the emirate . 
[ORG MbR  ] said bluntly " we want to be number one . 
" But , he said that [LOC Dubai  ] has only taken the first step on a journey of 1000 miles . 
He said that if [LOC Dubai  ] plays it right , the whole region can develop like [LOC Dubai  ] . 
14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MbR  ] indicated that [LOC Dubai  ] has succeeded because it is a place where all people can enjoy health , wealth , security , and the opportunity to succeed . 
Commenting on his recent announcement at the [ORG World Economic Forum  ] in [LOC Jordan  ] of a new $10 billion [PER Mohammed Bin Rashid Foundation  ] for education and job creation ( septel ) , he said " [PER God  ] gave us wealth and we must give it back to the people in the region . 
" [ORG MbR  ] sees [LOC Dubai  ] as the leading city of a wide region and he commented " I am serving 1.5 billion [ people ] in the region . 
" [ORG MbR  ] underscored that education is the key to regional modernization and moderation . 
In [LOC Dubai  ] , he noted , " we are trying to teach people how to fish and not just giving a fish to our neighbor . 
" [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000355 003.2 OF 003 15 ( [ORG SBU  ] ) He also called for more [LOC US  ] universities in [LOC Dubai  ] , and asked for Senator [PER Lieberman  ] 's help in resurrecting the possibility of the [ORG University of Connecticut  ] building a sizeable campus here ( note: this deal was put on hold by [ORG UCONN  ] leadership after [LOC Connecticut  ] state legislators and others objected to the [LOC UAE  ] regulation which prevents the entry of [MISC Israeli  ] passport holders ) . 
16 . 
( U ) Senator [PER Lieberman  ] has cleared this cable .
