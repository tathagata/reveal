( S ) Following up our earlier demarche ( refs ) , Political Minister Counselor reiterated [LOC U.S.  ] concerns regarding arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] in a September 13 meeting with [PER Anatoliy Antonov  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Director for Disarmament and [ORG Security Affairs  ] . 
Focusing on [ORG MANPADS  ] , [PER Antonov  ] replied that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government had not to date requested them . 
[PER Antonov  ] said that he and his [ORG Department 's  ] experts had carefully considered the points we had presented and had shared them with [MISC Russian  ] services . 
[PER Antonov  ] noted the [ORG MFA  ] would take the [LOC U.S.  ] points into account , along with the evaluations of [MISC Russian  ] services , when a determination on [ORG MANPADS  ] sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] was needed. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Nonetheless , [PER Antonov  ] stressed that there was no international restriction on selling arms , including [ORG MANPADS  ] , to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] also recognized the [LOC U.S.  ] as a competitor in the international arms trade , with the motivation of restricting [LOC Russia  ] 's market access . 
[LOC Russia  ] respected the [LOC U.S.  ] right to determine [LOC U.S.  ] policy on arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] , but " that is your decision , not ours ; we have our own policy . 
" [PER Antonov  ] said that if U/S [PER Joseph  ] raises this issue with Deputy FM Kislyak , Kislyak " will say the same . 
" PolMinCouns noted that the issue of military sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] remained of great concern to the [LOC U.S.  ] , and this would be a continuing subject of bilateral discussion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Regarding sales of [MISC AK-103  ] rifles , [PER Antonov  ] confirmed that the sale was indeed moving forward . 
He maintained that [LOC Venezuela  ] was a legitimate market for [MISC Russian  ] arms , and that [LOC Russia  ] intends to remain active in this market . 
He also commented that the tone in parts of ref A points was demeaning to [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should not " speak to us like we are [LOC Gabon  ] or [LOC Mali  ] , " he remarked . 
[PER Antonov  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] does not and will not give out specific information , such as serial numbers of [MISC AK-103  ] rifles , to others. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Comment: There was an explicit rejection of the [LOC U.S.  ] position with regard to the [MISC AK-103  ] rifles , but a less categorical response on the possibility of a [ORG MANPADS  ] sale . 
While [PER Antonov  ] 's general response on arms sales gave little grounds for optimism in the event that [LOC Venezuela  ] does request to purchase [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] , there may have been enough of a difference in the tone of his remarks on [ORG MANPADS  ] to constitute a possible opening that can be further explored .
