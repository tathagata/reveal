( C ) [ORG Summary: The Government of Sierra Leone  ] 's judicial system completed its landmark narcotics case ( reftel A ) on April 20 , finding all defendants guilty . 
The first case tried using the national [ORG Narcotics Control Act of 2008  ] , this creates valuable legal precedent , while also sending a message to narcotraffickers that [LOC Sierra Leone  ] will not allow itself to become another [MISC West African  ] country overrun by the global drugs trade . 
Of particular note were the convictions for the foreign defendants , three of whom were expelled into [LOC U.S.  ] custody following the conclusion of the trial . 
Despite [LOC Sierra Leone  ] 's general lack of capacity and infrastructure , the collaborative efforts between the President and the judicial and security sectors to bring this case to a strong and dramatic conclusion demonstrates that political will exists here to effectively combat the issue . 
The [ORG USG  ] should stand firmly behind President [PER Koroma  ] and the Government of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] to encourage further counternarcotics efforts , and enable them to not only interdict drugs within their borders , but set a positive example for other nations in the sub-region that the war on drugs is one worth fighting . 
End Summary. --------------- CASE BACKGROUND --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The July 13 , 2008 , bust of an aircraft carrying over 700kg of cocaine ( reftel A ) created shockwaves in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , where many citizens and government representatives believed that their country had escaped the narcotics transiting trend growing in [LOC West Africa  ] . 
In the reactive and somewhat ramshackle investigation that followed , scores of people were arrested or questioned in connection with the case , with 18 people ultimately being charged with narcotics-related offenses under the [ORG Narcotics Control Act.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The arrest of [PER Ahmed Sesay  ] , a close relative of the then Minister of [ORG Transportation  ] [PER Ibrahim Kemoh Sesay  ] , left the government open to criticism that it was complicit in the trafficking , highlighting the importance of strong government action to retain its credibility and commitment to law and order . 
A group of foreigners were also arrested , including the pilot and crew of the aircraft that brought in the cocaine , and others in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] who were here to facilitate the onward movement of the drugs. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Harvey Steven Perez  ] , an [MISC American-Colombian  ] dual national , was considered the key trafficker in the ring . 
On September 15th ( reftel B ) , President [PER Koroma  ] requested the [ORG USG  ] to assist in the removal of all of the suspected narcotraffickers , as well as [ORG Sierra Leoneans  ] who could be indicted in the [LOC U.S.  ] The President noted that he wanted rule of law to prevail , and was concerned that the narcotraffickers would undermine the judicial system . 
The President said he had encountered difficulties with the process but was determined to see the case to the end . 
On September 26 , 2008 , accompanied by U.S Ambassador , GoSL Foreign Minister and [LOC Sierra Leone  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Washington  ] , President [PER Koroma  ] met in [LOC Virginia  ] with senior [ORG DEA  ] officials and [ORG USG  ] intelligence agency representatives. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Subsequently , federal attorneys from the southern district of [LOC New York  ] , assisted by [ORG DEA  ] agents who had been asked by the government of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] to help with the investigation , succeeded in securing indictments against two of the traffickers , [PER Harvey Steven Perez  ] and [PER Gerardo Quistana Perez  ] . 
On November 24th , ( reftel C ) , the [ORG US Embassy  ] presented a diplomatic note to the government of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] concerning the indictments . 
In line with [PER Koroma  ] 's request of September 15th , the [ORG Embassy  ] informed the GoSL that we were prepared to accept the transfer of both indictees . 
In February , the [ORG Embassy  ] presented a second diplomatic note asking for the transfer of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] as a material witness ( note: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was acting as a [ORG DEA  ] informant when swept up in the arrests ) . 
In subsequent meetings , the president was informed that if he provided a 5-day notification , the [LOC U.S.  ] was willing and able to remove the three individuals as per his earlier request . 
On 15 April , the president met with the [ORG FREETOWN  ] 00000152 002 OF 003 Ambassador , informing her that the cocaine trial would end on 20 April , and the three individuals would be placed in our custody for removal . 
A presidential aide , who was concerned that the [PER Attorney General  ] would not follow through with the President 's intent , arranged for a face-to-face meeting between the President , the Ambassador , and the [PER Attorney General  ] on April 18 . 
The [PER Attorney General  ] assured the assembled group that the prisoners would be released to the [LOC United States  ] on April 20 . 
Subsequently , the [ORG DEA  ] chartered an aircraft and employed agents to effect the transfer. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Late in the afternoon of April 20 , with the trial lasting well past the projected timeline , the [PER Attorney General  ] approached [PER PolOff  ] and informed her that [LOC Sierra Leone  ] would have to collect fines from the individuals before they could be released to the [ORG USG  ] . 
A presidential aide hinted that if the [LOC U.S.  ] would pay the fines it would expedite the transfer of the prisoners , but the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] noted that it could not do so . 
The court case was adjourned later that evening , without a final judgment . 
The [ORG DCM  ] and Ambassador were in 24 hour contact with the Foreign Minister , Presidential Aides , and the [ORG UN  ] Representative ( who arranged helicopter transport to the [ORG DEA  ] plane ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Determined to see the process through , the [ORG DEA  ] and the [ORG Embassy  ] held meetings with the [PER Attorney General  ] and discussions with other senior officials to impress upon them the importance of backing their president 's promises . 
The [ORG DEA  ] noted that assets may in fact be seized through the investigation of these individuals , and that there may be ways to share some of these assets with the government of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] . 
This cleared the way for more progress the next day. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Court reconvened at 11am April 22 , with judgments being read but not an expulsion order . 
Negotiations between the [ORG Embassy  ] and the government of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] continued throughout the afternoon , with the judge announcing the sentences around 4pm . 
The accused were then returned to the prison , rather than being turned over to the [LOC United States  ] government as initially promised . 
It was alleged by one of the defense attorneys that the foreigners had paid a 75,000 [MISC Euro  ] bribe to the judge for a more lenient sentencing. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As negotiations continued through the night , the government of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] provided a diplomatic note to the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , stating that the three accused would be turned over to the [LOC U.S.  ] At 10:30pm the accused were in fact remanded to the [ORG DEA  ] agents , who flew with them to the [LOC United States  ] ( the expulsion is technically not a judicial action , but a presidential decision , but it does require the judge to recommend expulsion as part of the sentence ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The following penalties were imposed: 1st [MISC Accused: George  ] Aritstizabel Archilla: [LOC U.S.  ] $6.5M and 5 years imprisonment 2nd [MISC Accused: Victor Manuel  ] [PER Aranjo Lastreto  ] ( Jnr ) : $4M and 5 years imprisonment 3rd [ORG Accused: Julio Caesar Morales-Cruz: U.S.  ] $3M and 5 years imprisonment 4th [MISC Accused:  ] [PER Mohamed Bahil Sesay  ] ( alias [PER Ahmed Sesay  ] ) : Le300M and 5 years imprisonment 5th [MISC Accused:  ] [PER Hassan Karim Mansaray:  ] Le100M and 5 years imprisonment 6th [MISC Accused:  ] [PER Patrick Moriba Johnson: Le25M  ] and 2 years imprisonment 7th [MISC Accused: Chernor Momodu Bah:  ] [PER Le150M  ] and 5 years imprisonment 8th [MISC Accused:  ] [PER Harvey Steven Perez:  ] [LOC U.S.  ] /$5M and 5 years imprisonment 9th [MISC Accused:  ] [PER Gerardo Quistana Perez: U.S  ] $2M and 5 years imprisonment 10th [MISC Accused: Eimy Fernandez  ] [PER Leandro: US.  ] $3M and 5 years imprisonment 11th [MISC Accused: Alex Romeo:  ] [LOC U.S.  ] $1.5M and 5 years imprisonment 12th [ORG Accused: Ibrahim Mohamed Manley: Le150M  ] and 5 years imprisonment 13th [MISC Accused: Released  ] earlier in trial 14th [MISC Accused: Released  ] earlier in trial 15th [MISC Accused:  ] [PER Alimamy Kabia: Le150M  ] and 5 years imprisonment 16th [MISC Accused: Sadjo  ] Sarr: [LOC U.S.  ] $1.5M and 5 years imprisonment 17th [MISC Accused: Released  ] earlier in trial 18th [MISC Accused:  ] [PER Mohamed Musa Kamara: Le50M  ] and 3 years [ORG FREETOWN  ] 00000152 003 OF 003 imprisonment The fines for foreigners were in [LOC U.S.  ] dollars , and for [MISC Sierra Leoneans  ] in [ORG Leones  ] ( at about 3000 [ORG Leones  ] to the dollar ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The expulsion is not only a significant diplomatic victory for the [LOC United States  ] , but an internal victory for President [PER Koroma  ] , who demonstrated that he has the leadership capacity to overcome resistance within his own government ( including , perhaps , his own attorney general ) to assert the supremacy of the rule of law in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] . 
While the corruption accusations were troubling , with a steady stream of rumors insinuating that drug money has been a factor in the legal case from the start , any underhanded activity proved inadequate in saving the traffickers from their ride to [LOC New York  ] . 
Narcotics trafficking clearly poses an increasing threat to the sub-region , and it is a great relief that [LOC Sierra Leone  ] possesses the capacity to arrest , try , convict , and imprison narcotraffickers , as well as overcome internal issues in order to cooperate at a very high level with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC Sierra Leone  ] has the potential to be a significant partner in the regional war on drugs and to serve as a platform for other counternarcotics activities in [LOC West Africa  ] .
