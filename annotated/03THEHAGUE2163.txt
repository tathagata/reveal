( U ) Secretary of Energy [PER Spencer Abraham  ] met with [ORG Dutch Economics  ] ( also energy and telecommunications ) Minister [PER Laurens Jan Brinkhorst  ] on August 13 in The [MISC Hague  ] . 
In response to a question from [PER Brinkhorst  ] , the Secretary described the factors that led to the [LOC California  ] electricity shortages - explaining that there was no link between lack of supply and deregulation . 
[PER Brinkhorst  ] was gratified that the first [LOC U.S.  ] bilateral agreement on installing radiological monitors at a megaport was with [LOC Rotterdam  ] ( septel ) but suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] may now want to engage the [ORG European Commission  ] on making a broader agreement with the [ORG EU  ] rather than further bilateral agreements with [ORG EU  ] member states . 
The Secretary and Minister agreed to explore opportunities for [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] collaborative research on carbon-emission reducing technologies . 
The Secretary expressed the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's deep concern over [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
The Minister urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] ensure a level playing field for energy companies in [LOC Iraq  ] - specifically for [LOC Royal Dutch/Shell  ] . 
The Secretary expressed interest in participating in the May 2004 International Energy Forum , which will be hosted by the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
End summary . 
Energy Deregulation --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Minister [PER Brinkhorst  ] told the Secretary that [LOC California  ] is always raised in [LOC Europe  ] as the example of why energy deregulation is a bad idea . 
He supports deregulation himself and asked what happened in [LOC California  ] . 
The Secretary explained that [LOC California  ] 's electricity SIPDIS shortfalls resulted from a series of factors unrelated to deregulation: inadequate transmission lines from north to south [LOC California  ] , below average precipitation in the [LOC US  ] northwest , political factors which obstructed construction of new power plants , a prohibiton on long-term power purchases , and a half-way deregulation whichfreed wholesale prices while maintaining caps on retail prices . 
He said that not only [MISC Europeans  ] , but other [LOC U.S.  ] states have examined the [LOC California  ] example . 
He recommended that the Minister look at much more successful examples of electricity deregulation , in [LOC Pennsylvania  ] and [LOC Texas  ] , for example . 
Amb . 
[PER Sobel  ] offered to provide information on [LOC Pennsylvania  ] to Minister [PER Brinkhorst.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Brinkhorst  ] said that the Secretary 's description of strong local autonomy in the energy sector in the [LOC U.S.  ] also applies to [LOC Europe  ] . 
Not only the [ORG EU  ] member states , but regions within the member states prefer to run their own energy fiefdoms , making a cohesive [MISC European  ] electricity strategy very difficult . 
[ORG Radiological Monitors  ] at [LOC Rotterdam  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Minister [PER Brinkhorst  ] lauded the [MISC U.S.-Netherlands  ] bilateral agreement ( which the Secretary signed during his trip to the [LOC Netherlands  ] , septel ) to install radiological monitors at [LOC Rotterdam  ] , but wondered whether it wouldn't be better to negotiate further agreements with the [ORG European Commission  ] . 
He suggested that , as the trailblazer , the [MISC Dutch  ] government might be able to help facilitate talks with the [ORG Commission  ] - particularly with Commissioner [PER De Palacio  ] . 
The Secretary noted his many meetings with [ORG EU  ] Commissioner . 
[PER De Palacio  ] . 
He and the Ambassador replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] is open to speaking with anyone and every one if the effect would be to speed implementation of radiological monitoring. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Comment: [PER Laurens Jan Brinkhorst  ] worked for a long time in the [ORG European Commission  ] , finishing his career there as Director-General in the Environmental Directorate . 
He is more predisposed towards deferring to the [ORG Commission  ] than other [MISC Dutch  ] Ministers . 
End Comment Research Collaboration ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Brinkhorst  ] said , that as someone who worked directly on the [MISC Kyoto  ] negotiations , he regretted the failure of the [LOC U.S.  ] to sign the agreement , but added that that is water under the bridge . 
He said the point now is to discuss mutual efforts to reduce carbon emissions . 
The Secretary described [LOC U.S.  ] policy in detail , and pointed out SIPDIS the ambitious [ORG Bush Administration  ] program to reduce carbon intensity and eventually to reduce emissions <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) When the Secretary described the importance of advanced technologies in reducing carbon emissions , the Minister said that the [MISC Dutch  ] government completely agrees . 
Even while reducing government spending in almost all areas , the research and development budget for energy technologies will be increased . 
He suggested that should the Secretary be able to come to the [LOC Netherlands  ] for the May 2004 International Energy Forum , they spend time further discussing energy research . 
The Secretary and Minister agreed to have [ORG Department and Ministry  ] officials talk in the meantime about possible collaboration . 
Other topics -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The Secretary told the Minister that he could not let the meeting end without highlighting deep concern over issues regarding [LOC Iran  ] , in particular [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
The Minister took note and said , for his part , he similarly needed to raise [MISC Dutch  ] government interest in urging the [LOC U.S.  ] to ensure a level playing field for energy company operations in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He noted that [LOC Royal Dutch/Shell  ] is as much an [MISC American  ] as a [MISC European  ] company , and understands that [ORG Shell  ] is interested in applying its regional expertise in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The Secretary replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] is committed to letting [LOC Iraq  ] make its own decisions about its resources. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In a brief discussion of potential drilling in the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Waddensee  ] ( a major environmental dispute in the [LOC Netherlands  ] ) , [PER Brinkhorst  ] said that he wants the issue to be resolved quickly and in favor of beginning horizontal drilling . 
The new government 's attitude is that the focus should be on how to maintain the sea bottom level and mussel fields , not on whether drilling should proceed .
