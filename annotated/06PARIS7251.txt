Please protect accordingly. ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy [LOC Paris  ] has been reviewing and recalibrating its media strategy for the 2006-2007 to determine the appropriate attention to keep on traditional print media while pivoting to expand our efforts with radio and TV media , as well as with the new [MISC Internet  ] media . 
This analysis of [MISC French  ] daily print press is the first in a series of cables analyzing the particularities of the [MISC French  ] media environment . 
Future cables will examine [LOC France  ] 's influential news weeklies , its broadcast media , and the dynamic [MISC French  ] blogo-sphere. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Today 's [MISC French  ] daily print press scene is characterized by illustrious national mastheads ( [ORG Le Monde  ] , [ORG Le Figaro  ] , [ORG Liberation  ] ) losing money and readership as they are challenged by increasingly credible upstarts . 
There also remains a powerful regional print press network , mostly controlled by old newspaper families . 
Embassy [LOC Paris  ] maintains its own contacts with the regional press -- whose leadership gathers in [LOC Paris  ] at least quarterly -- but we coordinate most of our regional outreach efforts through the two [MISC Consulates  ] and five [MISC American  ] Presence Posts. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Lively  ] and competitive print media still exercise significant influence on [MISC French  ] public opinion , despite a lasting and serious crisis affecting the traditional daily newspapers . 
Twenty-seven national dailies of general interest were available in [LOC France  ] before [MISC World War II  ] ; only six are still available today . 
Some still exist thanks only to financial help from the [MISC French  ] state , others because of private investment . 
Since 2004 there has been growing [MISC French  ] interest in free daily publications such as " 20 Minutes " and " [ORG Metro  ] " ( in the morning ) and , more recently , " [ORG Direct Soir  ] " ( in the evening ) . 
Seventy-five percent of the [MISC French  ] people reading one of these free newspapers do not and would not buy and read any other daily publication. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In terms of reach , radio and television are the main [MISC French  ] sources of news . 
The [MISC French  ] spend an average of 3 hours 40 minutes per day watching television ( versus only 35 minutes spent reading the press ) . 
Nevertheless , there are 75 daily titles across [LOC France  ] ( national and regional ) , served by 5,000 journalists , and read by more than 18 million readers . 
End Summary. ----------------------------- [ORG LE MONDE  ] , [LOC CIRCULATION  ] 372,310 ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

Influential in government , business and intellectual circles , the editorial line is left-of-center .

" Despite [ORG Le Monde  ] 's critical assessment of [MISC American  ] foreign policy since the beginning of the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , it has been more moderate since the departure of controversial deputy director [PER Edwy Plenel  ] in December 2004. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .

( U ) As most [MISC French  ] dailies , [ORG Le Monde  ] suffers from a decline in readership and advertising revenue .
