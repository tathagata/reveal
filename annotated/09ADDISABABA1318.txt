SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) In a rare meeting with the elusive head of the [ORG Ethiopian National Intelligence and Security Service  ] ( [ORG NISS  ] ) and main hardliner within the powerful executive committee of the ruling [MISC Ethiopian  ] [ORG People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front  ] ( [ORG EPRDF  ] ) party , Ambassador and [ORG NISS  ] chief [PER Getachew Assefa  ] discussed a wide range of regional and bilateral issues . 
[PER Getachew  ] made clear during the four hour private meeting that [LOC Ethiopia  ] sought greater understanding from the [LOC U.S.  ] on national security issues vital to [LOC Ethiopia  ] , especially [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] concerns over domestic insurgent groups like the [ORG Oromo Liberation Front  ] ( [ORG OLF  ] ) and [ORG Ogaden National Liberation Front  ] ( [ORG ONLF  ] ) . 
He spoke at length about former [ORG Addis Ababa  ] Mayor-elect [PER Berhanu Nega  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX ; VOA’s biased reporting ; the dangers of former defense minister [PER Seeye Abraha’s  ] growing authority within the opposition ; [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] views on democracy and human rights ; Eritrea’s role as a rogue state in the region ; and regional issues including the importance of supporting the [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] and a rapprochement with [ORG Alhu Sunna Wal Jama’a  ] ( [ORG ASWJ  ] ) as the only option for Somalia’s survival ; and the need for [LOC U.S.  ] reconciliation with [LOC Sudan  ] . 
End Summary . 
TOWARD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Through the arrangements of former [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [LOC Ethiopia  ] , [PER Irv Hicks  ] , Ambassador met with [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] national intelligence chief , [PER Getachew Assefa  ] , for a four hour private meeting on June 4 . 
[PER Getachew  ] , noted for his eccentric behavior and elusiveness , explained to the Ambassador that he welcomes greater dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy , but underscored the importance of deeper [LOC U.S.  ] understanding of [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] security concerns . 
Characterizing the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship as sound and expressing appreciation for the cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on special projects on counterterrorism , [PER Getachew  ] emphasized that [LOC Ethiopia  ] shares [LOC U.S.  ] views on high value targets ( [ORG HVT  ] ) like [PER Robow  ] and al-Turki as threats to regional stability . 
But domestic insurgent groups , like the [ORG OLF  ] and [ORG ONLF  ] , should also be treated as terrorists because they have safe haven camps in extremist-held areas in [LOC Somalia  ] and receive support and assistance from the very same HVTs that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] are trying to neutralize . 
Such support makes the [ORG ONLF  ] and [ORG OLF  ] accomplices with international terrorist groups , [PER Getachew  ] argued . 
Just as [LOC Ethiopia  ] would not meet with domestic [LOC U.S.  ] insurgent groups , referring to individuals and groups who would conduct bombings of [LOC U.S.  ] government offices , abortion clinics and advocates of racial and gender hate , [LOC Ethiopia  ] would not want [LOC U.S.  ] officials to meet with [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] domestic insurgents who bomb and kill [MISC Ethiopian  ] officials and citizens. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Getachew  ] added that the [ORG GOE  ] does conduct talks with the [ORG ONLF  ] and [ORG OLF  ] and there are groups , like the [MISC Ethiopian  ] elders , who reach out to the membership in an effort to end the violence . 
[PER Getachew  ] stressed that this is an [MISC Ethiopian  ] process by [MISC Ethiopians  ] and should remain an [MISC Ethiopian-led  ] , Ethiopian-directed and Ethiopian-coordinated process . 
Ambassador made clear that the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] does not meet with the [ORG ONLF  ] and that the [LOC U.S.  ] is in close consultations with [MISC Ethiopian  ] authorities on their views on the [ORG ONLF  ] and [ORG OLF  ] , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] supports the work of the [MISC Ethiopian  ] Elders to end the violence . 
[PER Getachew  ] noted the visit to [MISC European  ] [ORG Capitals  ] and [LOC Washington  ] of [ORG ONLF  ] senior leaders and said they met with staffers in the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Vice President’s  ] office . 
The Ambassador said that we had no evidence that a meeting took place with the [MISC Vice President’s  ] staff and stressed that the [ORG State Department  ] did not meet with the [ORG ONLF  ] group . 
Further , the [LOC U.S.  ] military no longer meets with alleged [ORG ONLF  ] supporters in the volatile [LOC Ogaden  ] region of eastern [LOC Ethiopia  ] because of security concerns . 
The Ambassador stressed that such meetings in the past was for force protection of [LOC U.S.  ] military civil affairs team working in the dangerous [LOC Ogaden  ] region near [LOC Somalia  ] , but in the last few years there has been no contact . 
The Ambassador added that there should be closer discussion between he [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] on this issue . 
[LOC U.S.  ] GIVES EXTREMISTS A VOICE AND LEGITIMACY -------------------------------------------- [ORG ADDIS ABAB  ] 00001318 002 OF 004 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Getachew  ] complained pointedly that [ORG Voice of America  ] ( [ORG VOA  ] ) is biased and gives a platform for extremist elements . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Getachew  ] also discussed the [ORG VOA  ] reports covering former [ORG State Department  ] official [PER Greg Stanton  ] of [ORG Genocide Watch  ] , who charged Prime Minister Meles of crimes against humanity as a result of [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] incursion into [LOC Somalia  ] in 2006 . 
[PER Getachew  ] complained that [ORG VOA  ] Amharic reporting was biased and not even handed . 
He did note that [ORG VOA  ] [MISC English  ] was fine . 
[ORG VOA  ] Amharic service does not interview [MISC Ethiopian  ] officials who can refute “false assertions” espoused in the [ORG VOA  ] interviews . 
[PER Getachew  ] praised [ORG Germany’s Deutsche Wella  ] service for its balanced and yet hard hitting reporting . 
[PER Getachew  ] underscored that if the [ORG GOE  ] is doing something wrong or does not have the support of the people , news services have an obligation to highlight such problems . 
[PER Getachew  ] said [ORG VOA  ] , however , seeks to report only what is anti-government or lend support for the opposition . 
[PER Getachew  ] concluded that the [LOC U.S.G.  ] , because of [ORG VOA  ] Amharic service is an official arm of the [LOC U.S.G.  ] , lacks neutrality in its support for the opposition and this undercuts relations between the two countries . 
The Ambassador replied that [ORG VOA  ] is a very independent media and the [LOC U.S.G.  ] does not have oversight and control over the content of the reporting. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) XXXXXXXXXXXX THE OPPOSITION -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Getachew  ] commented on [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] opposition leadership underscoring that he wishes to see a vibrant opposition movement , but currently , the [MISC NGO  ] community and foreign missions support the opposition blindly without critical analysis . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [ORG ADDIS ABAB  ] 00001318 003 OF 004 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) XXXXXXXXXXXX DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Getachew  ] echoed common themes advocated by the ruling [ORG EPRDF  ] party stalwarts from the Prime Minister to the party faithful . 
He stressed that the [ORG EPRDF  ] supports democracy and that it is the goal for the ruling party to eventually give way to other parties of common vision in fighting poverty and a commitment to support the process of democratization . 
[PER Getachew  ] said he would support opposition parties if they have a better message to help [LOC Ethiopia  ] overcome poverty , improve health care and education , and raise the standard of living of the [MISC Ethiopian  ] people . 
He added that the [LOC U.S.  ] and others should look at [MISC Ethiopia’s  ] democracy efforts and human rights record as a work in progress . 
It will take time but [LOC Ethiopia  ] is moving in the right direction that will make [LOC Ethiopia  ] a democratic state . 
FOREIGN POLICY: [LOC ERITREA  ] , [LOC SOMALIA  ] , AND [LOC SUDAN  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Getachew  ] described [MISC Eritrean  ] President [PER Isaias Afwerki  ] as “no martyr , ” who sought to survive and establish himself as the predominate leader in the [LOC Horn of Africa  ] . 
[LOC Ethiopia  ] stands in the way of [MISC Isaias’  ] grand design and it is his goal to divide [LOC Ethiopia  ] and weaken it through terrorism . 
[PER Getachew  ] remarked that one of [MISC Isaias’  ] bodyguards was in [LOC Dubai  ] and then defected to [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
The bodyguard remarked that [PER Isaias  ] was a recluse who spent his days painting and tinkering with gadgets and carpentry work . 
[PER Isaias  ] appeared to make decisions in isolation with no discussion with his advisors . 
It was difficult to tell how [PER Isaias  ] would react each day and his moods changed constantly . 
[PER Getachew  ] added that [LOC Eritrea  ] trains over 30 rebel groups at [PER Camp Sawa  ] near the [LOC Sudan  ] border and graduates are infiltrated into [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Ethiopia  ] and [LOC Somalia  ] to enhance instability and target [MISC Ethiopian  ] interests . 
[PER Getachew  ] expressed dismay with [LOC Kenya  ] in allowing [MISC Eritrean  ] intel officers and military trainers who support al-Shabaab in [LOC Somalia  ] , to bribe their way out of [LOC Kenya  ] and return to [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
He explained the activities of [PER Abraha Kassa  ] , [ORG Eritrea’s  ] elusive intel chief who directs [ORG Eritrea’s Somalia  ] operations. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) On [LOC Somalia  ] , [PER Getachew  ] said the only way to support stability was through support for the [ORG ASWJ  ] which attracts a wide range of support from all the clans , especially those groups in conflict with each other . 
The [ORG ASWJ  ] has been effective in countering al-Shabaab and is ideologically committed to [ORG Sufism  ] and the defense of [MISC Islam  ] against the extremist salafists which form al-Shabaab . 
[PER Getachew  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] can best help by supporting the [ORG ASWJ  ] and [ORG TFG  ] to cooperate , to pay salaries of [ORG TFG  ] troops and support the [ORG IGAD  ] and [ORG African Union  ] which are seeking to sanction [LOC Eritrea  ] , implement a no fly zone , and close ports used by extremist elements. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) On [LOC Sudan  ] , [PER Getachew  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to engage [PER Bashir  ] and the [MISC Sudanese  ] leadership . 
[LOC Sudan  ] , more than [LOC Somalia  ] , poses the greatest threat to regional security and stability , [PER Getachew  ] argued . 
The prospects for a civil war which destabilizes the region would be devastating . 
The only country that would benefit would be [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) It is interesting that [MISC Getachew’s  ] description of President [PER Isaias  ] mirrors [MISC Getachew’s  ] own character , as well . 
[ORG ADDIS ABAB  ] 00001318 004 OF 004 [PER Getachew  ] avoids speaking with foreigners and few foreigners really know him . 
He is not well liked within his own agency for decisions he makes in isolation which , at times , make little sense and are not discussed in consensus with his staff . 
His apparent hot temper and reclusive habits have made it difficult for his staff to gauge his moods and understand his thought process . 
The Prime Minister himself and other [ORG EPRDF  ] leaders have remarked to the Ambassador that it is difficult to talk with [PER Getachew  ] and to meet with him , but that his loyalty to the [ORG EPRDF  ] is never in question . 
Despite his poor reputation , [PER Getachew  ] is regarded as a strong [ORG EPRDF  ] hardliner and commands considerable authority and influence within the powerful [ORG EPRDF  ] executive committee which lays down the policy for the ruling party and the government . 
While relations with [ORG NISS  ] officials below [MISC Getachew’s  ] rank are extremely cordial and , depending on the unit , very close , the Ambassador has met with [PER Getachew  ] only twice in the past three years , and other Embassy staff have also met with little success in engaging him . 
Even visiting senior [LOC U.S.  ] intel officers have not been successful in meeting [PER Getachew  ] . 
Ambassador will pursue future meetings with [PER Getachew  ] but he will never be a close contact . 
End Comment .
