This message was coordinated with [ORG DAO  ] , [ORG MLO  ] , and [ORG POL.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over the next few months , [LOC Brazil  ] will host a number of military exercises , including [LOC PKO South  ] and [MISC Patriot  ] [PER Angel SAR  ] . 
While the [ORG GOB  ] has provided its usual written assurances concerning protections for [LOC US  ] personnel participating in these exercises , post understands [ORG Department of State and Department of Defense  ] want to standardize the protections offered . 
We should note that in the decades that the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] have been collaborating on military exercises , the [ORG GOB  ] has always respected all norms and immunities concerning our personnel involved in those exercises -- and we are unaware of any incidents affecting [LOC US  ] personnel that the [ORG GOB  ] did not promptly resolve to our benefit . 
We understand [LOC Washington  ] concern with the lack of a [ORG SOFA  ] with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
While the [ORG GOB  ] has told us that it will not sign a [ORG SOFA  ] , it has also affirmed it would accord to the maximum extent of its laws all necessary privileges to our personnel in [LOC Brazil  ] on military exercises. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) For [LOC Washington  ] guidance , mission offers following comments on draft [LOC Brazil  ] SOFA: Each military exercise should be addressed individually with a separate dipnote . 
We are concerned that [LOC Brazil  ] will interpret a group dipnote as a backdoor [ORG SOFA  ] and will reject it . 
Until now all [LOC US  ] personnel , including military , entering [LOC Brazil  ] use passports with valid visas , except those on port visits who are on limited duration liberty . 
We do not believe that [LOC Brazil  ] will allow personnel entry on military [LOC ID  ] or military orders . 
[LOC Brazil  ] already recognizes [LOC US  ] drivers licenses and allows rental of vehicles for all personnel , including military . 
Although there is no need to stipulate such a requirement for these exercises , the [ORG GOB  ] likely will not object to its inclusion in a dipnote . 
[LOC Brazil  ] already allows [LOC US  ] military personnel to wear uniforms . 
We know of no [MISC Brazilian  ] law that prevents this . 
[LOC US  ] military personnel in country on exercises wear uniforms all the time . 
[LOC Brazil  ] does not authorize the importation or carrying of weapons . 
For the exercises at hand , this issue is irrelevant as it has been for all military exercises held on [MISC Brazilian  ] territory for many years since they do not involve any activities involving weapons . 
Because the right to carry firearms would require [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congressional  ] approval , this issue is a real exercise killer . 
[LOC Brazil  ] already allows duty free and inspection free importation of all equipment required for military exercises , through all entry points including commercial airports . 
To date , this has not been an issue with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Personal effects and baggage are treated the same as above and enter free of inspection and duties . 
[LOC Brazil  ] already allows removal or local disposal of all [LOC US  ] movable property and supplies , including personal effects , free of export duties , taxes or other charges . 
[LOC US  ] military aircraft landing at [MISC Brazilian  ] military bases are not charged any landing fees , etc . 
[LOC US  ] military aircraft utilizing civilian airfields pay reasonable charges . 
This has been common practice for decades . 
The [LOC US  ] military has never imported vehicles into [LOC Brazil  ] for exercise support . 
All vehicles , if required , are locally contracted . 
The listed exercises do not require importation of [LOC US  ] military vehicles . 
While the [ORG GOB  ] may have no problem with this clause , we do not want to put existing favorable treatment in jeopardy . 
The recognition or acceptance of [LOC US  ] professional licenses for the [ORG Medical Readiness Training Exercise  ] ( [ORG MEDRETE  ] ) rests with the [MISC Brazilian  ] military in internal [ORG GOB  ] coordination as a precondition to the exercise . 
While there is no need to include such a clause within the [ORG MEDRETE  ] note , the [ORG GOB  ] will likely not object to its inclusion . 
It is not a relevant issue to the other exercises . 
Use of radio communications and frequencies is handled on a case-by-case basis with both militaries during the exercise planning/survey phase . 
If properly worded , the [ORG GOB  ] will not likely object . 
However , its inclusion could delay things as the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] seeks to consult with technical experts . 
We believe it is not relevant to the upcoming exercises . 
[LOC US  ] military planners already utilize local contractors with Embassy support . 
The [ORG GOB  ] will not receive well a demand that it accept full responsibility on all claims . 
[LOC Brazil  ] expects that the USG will pay reasonable costs for any damages sustained in an exercise , including injury or death . 
To date , this has not been an issue . 
Nor do we anticipate it will become an issue during the upcoming exercises . 
Heavy equipment that could cause infrastructure damages is not a component of any of the exercises . 
[LOC Brazil  ] already accords de facto A&T status for [LOC US  ] personnel participating in military exercises .
