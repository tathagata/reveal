( C ) SUMMARY: In a solid show of support , both the [ORG Federation Council  ] and the [ORG Duma  ] voted unanimously to urge that President [PER Medvedev  ] recognize [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] as independent states . 
[MISC Parliamentarians  ] blasted [LOC Georgia  ] for having launched a military campaign against [LOC South Ossetia  ] , and pointed the finger at the [LOC U.S.  ] as having planted the seeds for the aggression by arming and training the [MISC Georgian  ] military . 
Having ratcheted up expectations of imminent [MISC Russian  ] action , some observers now believe [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] will wait to see if the international community meets [LOC Russia  ] 's demands: [ORG UN  ] confirmation of [LOC Russia  ] 's peacekeeping role and condemnation of [PER Saakashvili  ] . 
[PER Medvedev  ] can be expected to proceed cautiously , taking advantage of a situation that , at the moment , he perceives to be in [LOC Russia  ] 's favor . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Federation Council  ] , meeting August 25 , unanimously approved an appeal to President [PER Medvedev  ] that he immediately recognize the independence of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
In a remarkably organized and disciplined one-hour session , [ORG Council  ] leaders and 45 members quickly delivered statements pillorying [LOC Georgia  ] for having attacked [MISC Tskhinvali  ] August 7 . 
[MISC Abkhaz  ] and [LOC South Ossetian  ] leaders [PER Bagapsh  ] and [PER Kokoity  ] also addressed the session , proclaiming the support of residents of those territories for independence from [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The [MISC Abkhaz  ] leader also confirmed his readiness to sign a agreement on military cooperation with [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following smartly on the heels of that session , the [ORG Duma  ] convened to consider a similar appeal to [PER Medvedev  ] . 
In that larger body , popularly elected legislators took their time to score rhetorical points . 
The resolution calling for recognition was introduced by [ORG CIS Committee  ] Chairman [PER Ostrovskiy  ] . 
International relations [ORG Committee  ] Chairman [PER Kosachev  ] introduced a companion appeal to the [ORG UN  ] and to parliaments of [ORG UN  ] member states urging them also to recognize the two entities . 
Once again , [PER Bagapsh  ] and [PER Kokoity  ] led off discussion of the appeal , charging that steps by " western states " to arm [LOC Georgia  ] emboldened leaders in [LOC Tbilisi  ] to launch its attack against [LOC South Ossetia.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Speeches by [ORG Duma  ] party faction leaders took on a very anti-Georgian and anti-American tone . 
[MISC Communist  ] leader [PER Zyuganov  ] and [ORG LDPR  ] leader [ORG Zhirinovskiy  ] specifically accused the [LOC U.S.  ] of having precipitated the attack on [LOC South Ossetia  ] by arming and training [MISC Georgian  ] military forces , and that [LOC U.S.  ] motives included destabilizing [LOC Russia  ] and controlling energy transit routes from the [LOC Caucasus  ] and the [MISC Caspian  ] regions . 
Vice President [PER Cheney  ] was accused of coordinating the anti-Russian , pro-Georgian campaign . 
[ORG Zhirinovskiy  ] alleged that [LOC Israel  ] had intended to attack [LOC Iran  ] just prior to the [LOC U.S.  ] elections , and that the [MISC Georgian  ] military strike now disrupted that plan . 
In the end , the lower house also adopted the appeals to [PER Medvedev  ] ( for [MISC Russian  ] recognition ) and to the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG UN  ] member states unanimously . 
Not So Fast ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the days just prior to the special session of Parliament , experts and academicians filled newspapers and airwaves with concern for the political consequences of recognition . 
While conceding that public sentiment has been affected by the events in [LOC South Ossetia  ] , esteemed figures including former Ambassadors Adamishin and Lukin urged [PER Medvedev  ] to hold off on recognition . 
They argued that [LOC Moscow  ] 's diplomatic hand has been strengthened as a result of " [MISC Georgian  ] aggression " and [LOC Russia  ] 's decisive victory in the war , and that now was not the time to consign the two entities to the same fate as [LOC Northern Cyprus  ] , i.e. to being recognized by only one other country . 
Now What ? --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) There was little doubt that the legislative moves were coordinated by the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
The question remains , though , for what purpose ? 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the same [ORG Duma  ] that had said nothing during the war , and had also not been called back earlier from its August recess , was now being used by the [LOC Kremlin  ] to further muddy international waters and to give the [LOC Kremlin  ] another card to play with [MISC European  ] mediators . 
The [ORG Federation Council  ] and [ORG Duma  ] were already on record ( as of March , 2008 ) as supporting independence for [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
By orchestrating a solid show of support for independence from the parliament , she contended , the [LOC Kremlin  ] can take a tougher line with respect to drawing back [MISC Russian  ] forces to pre-August 7 lines of demarcation . 
Expecting that disputes over interpretation and implementation of [ORG Point  ] 6 of the [MISC Medvedev-Sarkozy  ] cease-fire agreement will continue with [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [LOC Kremlin  ] can now either move to recognize , declaring that it cannot stand in the way of strong public sentiment , or it can argue for acceptance of its interpretation of [ORG Point  ] 6 . 
In either case , [PER Medvedev  ] will be able to demonstrate to the world and to the [MISC Russian  ] public that , having weathered the storm of world criticism , he took quick action before opportunities created by military action faded away . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested that factors that might restrain [PER Medvedev  ] from immediately recognizing included positive signals from [LOC Europe  ] , and a desire to await the outcome of [LOC U.S.  ] presidential elections . 
Even if he chooses to wait , the parliamentary show will still give [MISC Russian  ] diplomats enough cover to take tough positions on the future of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] at the [ORG OSCE  ] and the [ORG UN  ] for months to come. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not anticipate [PER Medvedev  ] approving recognition in the immediate term . 
Acknowledging that supporting independence was not in [LOC Russia  ] 's objective interests , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Medvedev  ] 's decision would be driven by other factors . 
[PER Medvedev  ] , he argued , would use the vote to build pressure for an international mechanism that met [LOC Russia  ] 's bottom line . 
In particular , he argued that [LOC Russia  ] sought a [ORG UNSCR  ] confirming its status as peacekeeper in [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] , and expected the international community to halt its unqualified support for President [PER Saakashvili  ] . 
Otherwise , he intimated , recognition of the two entities might be expedited . 
He cited an interview given by [PER Saakashvili  ] in recent days in which the [MISC Georgian  ] leader reportedly declared that he would strive not to convince [MISC South Ossetians  ] to " come back to [LOC Georgia  ] , " but that " [LOC Georgia  ] would come to them ( e.g. , militarily ) . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] charged that this only further confirmed [PER Saakashvili  ] 's future military intentions against [LOC South Ossetia  ] and the need to ensure that the [MISC Georgian  ] military never launches a military attack against the region again. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG Duma  ] and [ORG Federation Council  ] 's actions will be used by the [LOC Kremlin  ] and the [ORG MFA  ] in dealings with foreign intermediaries to demonstrate strong broad support for even tougher measures regarding the two regions , and to further ratchet up pressure against the [PER Saakashvili  ] government . 
Despite the unanimous votes , [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] can play the recognition game out further , increasing pressure on [MISC European  ] allies to compromise on a [MISC Russian-preferred  ] UNSC draft resolution while avoiding a step that - [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's bravado aside - could have unpredictable consequences in [MISC Russian  ] domestic terms .
