REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [LOC Libya  ] 's newly-constituted [ORG National Security Council  ] continues to experience growing pains . 
A shortage of skilled staff , questions about its mandate , and friction between [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi and some senior [ORG GOL  ] officials have limited the [ORG NSC  ] 's organizational effectiveness , although al-Qadhafi remains " ambitious " and continues to work to expand his area of influence . 
End summary . 
STAFFING CHALLENGES 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) xxxxxxxxxxxx of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Security Council  ] ( strictly protect ) , told P/E Chief that the [ORG NSC  ] , formed earlier this year ( reftel ) , was experiencing growing pains . 
Noting that the [ORG NSC  ] 's staff had grown in size , cited a continuing shortage of skilled , trained individuals as an impediment to greater organizational effectiveness . 
The [ORG NSC  ] had to date pulled most of its staff from other [ORG GOL  ] entities , including the [ORG External Security Organization  ] , [ORG Internal Security Organization  ] , [ORG General People 's Committee  ] for [ORG Foreign Cooperation  ] and [ORG International Liaison  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) and [ORG Ministry of Justice.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that training and skill sets among staff drawn from other organizations varied considerably . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Other organizations were initially more willing to provide staff , in part because they feared repercussions if they refused requests from a son of Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] ; however , the [ORG NSC  ] 's policy of aggressively identifying and attempting to lure quality staff had begun to engender resentment and a sense that the [ORG NSC  ] was pursuing its staffing needs at the expense of other [ORG GOL  ] agencies. xxxxxxxxxxxx mentioned that the [ORG MFA  ] had successfully resisted an attempt in late November by the [ORG NSC  ] to request that a well-regarded [ORG MFA  ] employee be detailed to the [ORG NSC  ] ( [ORG NFI  ] ) . 
[ORG NATIONAL SECURITY TRAINING ACADEMY  ] IN THE WORKS ? 4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Noting a lack of basic professional skills , xxxxxxxxxxxx specifically mentioned a shortage of employees who could take notes in meetings and draft memoranda of conversations . 
Describing [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi as a " dynamic " individual given to holding many meetings , she complained that the dearth of qualified working-level employees meant that more senior staff members were often pressed into service as notetakers. al-Qadhafi , responding to suggestions from his advisers , is moving to establish a [ORG National Security Training Academy  ] that would train staff for the [ORG NSC  ] and other [ORG GOL  ] entities with national security and foreign policy equities . 
Pointing to the poor quality of [LOC Libya  ] 's educational system , conceded that the [ORG NSC  ] and other [ORG GOL  ] entities were " suffering " from the fact that comparatively few [MISC Libyans  ] were able to engage in critical thinking and writing of a sort that lent itself to more sophisticated exercises such as drafting analytical reports . 
( Note: We understand that the [LOC UK  ] Embassy in [LOC Tripoli  ] has discussed possible training opportunities in the [LOC UK  ] for [ORG NSC  ] terrorism analysts . 
End note . 
) MUTASSIM'S AMBITION CREATES FRICTION WITH SOME 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the [ORG NSC  ] as an organization is still trying to define its role within the [ORG GOL  ] . 
It remains " a bit unclear " whether the [ORG NSC  ] is to serve as an interagency coordinating mechanism , or as a formulator and implementer of policy in its own right . 
Responding to a question about whether the principal 's personality might have something to do with that , she conceded that [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi is " ambitious " and said he is still working to " create a space " in which to work cooperatively with other senior [ORG GOL  ] officials. xxxxxxxxxxxx implied that doubts among some senior members of the [ORG GOL  ] 's old guard about whether [PER Mutassim  ] was substantively qualified for his position , [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001056 002 OF 002 together with his increasingly obvious desire to grow his fiefdom , had created friction with unnamed others in the leadership . 
Indicating that the [ORG MFA  ] and " some security organizations " had been particularly resistant to the [ORG NSC  ] 's attempts to expand its brief , xxxxxxxxxxxx said the [ORG Ministry of Public Security  ] ( [ORG MinInterior-equivalent  ] ) and armed forces had been less recalcitrant . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , the [ORG NSC  ] 's membership is as follows: PM al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi ( chairman ) ; [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi ; Foreign Minister [PER Abdulrahman Shalgham  ] ; Minister of [ORG Public Security  ] ( [ORG MinInterior-equivalent  ] ) [PER Rajib Saleh  ] ; Minister of [ORG Economy and Trade Essawi  ] ; Minister of Finance [PER Muhammad Ali  ] al-Hweij ; and Chief of [ORG Defense Major General Abubakr Yunis Jafr  ] . 
It is believed that [ORG Jafr  ] encumbers the seat reserved for a " representative of the [ORG Temporary General People 's Committee  ] " per Law [ORG Number Four of 2007  ] , which established the [ORG NSC  ] . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: xxxxxxxxxxxx suggestion that [PER Mutassim  ] 's ambitions have caused friction with others in the leadership accords with the view of some local observers that [PER Mutassim  ] is an increasingly important player in the political firmament . 
Determining how he is perceived as a potential successor to his father , particularly by key members of his father 's cohort of contemporaries , remains something of an open question , however . 
There are reports that putative heir apparent [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi is out of favor with some segments of the leadership , due to his public participation in the messy denouement of the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses' case , and his championing of economic reforms .
