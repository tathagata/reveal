( C ) [MISC Summary: Calling  ] the situation " worrisome , " [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy Assistant  ] Secretary for Petroleum , [ORG Natural Gas  ] and [ORG Renewables  ] , [PER Limo Neto  ] , shared with [PER Econoff  ] the breaking news that gas flow from [LOC Bolivia  ] was decreasing , although the majority of the supply to [LOC Brazil  ] remains unaffected thus far . 
Given the [MISC Brazilian  ] dependence on [MISC Bolivian  ] gas , a long-term disruption in supply could have serious economic consequences , particularly with respect to industrial output . 
[ORG Lima Neto  ] reported that [ORG Petrobras  ] had been contacted by the opposition actors in [LOC Bolivia  ] to say that they had nothing against [ORG Petrobras  ] or [LOC Brazil  ] and , despite the threat to [PER Morales  ] , would try to avoid taking actions that would be damaging . 
[ORG Lima Neto  ] said his next task would be to convene a group for contingency planning . 
According to [ORG Lima Neto  ] , there are already draft plans in place for how to compensate for a sudden loss of gas supply , which includes using alternate fuels to power some electrical stations , for instance liquid fuels , as well as increasing production in some of the coal powered thermal plants . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has weathered a disruption in gas supply as recently as October 2007 and some additional energy sources have come online since that time . 
[ORG Lima Neto  ] noted that despite some existing contingency plans , a protracted disruption in the natural gas flow from [LOC Bolivia  ] could lead to rationing . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) According to [MISC Brazilian  ] press reports , the [MISC Bolivian  ] opposition is using [LOC Brazil  ] as a pawn in a dispute with President [PER Evo Morales  ] and threatening the [MISC Brazilian  ] industrial production and electrical supply in the process . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] newspapers characterize the [LOC Bolivia  ] domestic political dispute as centering around tax funds taken from the states of [PER Santa Cruz  ] , [LOC Beni  ] , [LOC Tarijia  ] , and [PER Pando  ] , apparently for the purposes of funding a pension system , as well as the contested constitution being proposed by a Morales-backed [ORG Congress  ] . 
During the night and early morning of September 10 , in what the President of the [LOC Bolivia  ] state gas company , [PER Santos Ramirez  ] , is quoted in press reports as calling a " terrorist act " protesters attempted to shut off the valves , but have thus far not succeed in completely turning off the supply , despite multiple tries . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is a major purchaser of [MISC Bolivian  ] natural gas exports , which bring in between $6-9 per million [ORG BTU  ] ( Reftel F ) . 
Fifty percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's natural gas comes from [LOC Bolivia  ] , with 60 percent of that coming from the [LOC Tarijia  ] province . 
( Note: Protesters may have believed that [PER Morales  ] would be particularly vulnerable to the threat of disruption of the commercial agreements with [LOC Brazil  ] having learned how reliant [LOC Bolivia  ] is on its [MISC Brazilian  ] market when he nationalized [MISC Petrobras'  ] plants in [LOC Bolivia  ] and tried to unilaterally negotiate the contracts , resulting in a severe loss of income .

( C ) The [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] 's Secretary of Petroleum , [ORG Natural Gas  ] , and [ORG Renewables  ] , [PER Jose Lima Neto  ] , told [PER Econoff  ] that the situation was very worrisome . 
Given the [MISC Brazilian  ] dependence on [MISC Bolivian  ] gas , a disruption in supply could have serious economic consequences . 
[ORG Lima Neto  ] reported that [ORG Petrobras  ] had been contacted by the opposition actors in [LOC Bolivia  ] to say that they had nothing against [ORG Petrobras  ] or [LOC Brazil  ] and , despite the threat to [PER Morales  ] , would try to avoid taking actions that would be damaging . 
[ORG Lima Neto  ] agreed that the fact that the initial efforts to turn off the gas flow had not cut off the supply entirely could be reflective of the opposition 's efforts to threaten [PER Morales  ] without causing undue damage to their neighbors and business partners . 
[ORG Lima Neto  ] noted that any disruption would be harmful not only for [LOC Brazil  ] but for the [MISC Bolivian  ] economy as well , and said he hoped that fact would make the situation self-limiting. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During the meeting with [PER Econoff  ] , at approximately 1:00 ( noon [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] time ) September 10 , [ORG Lima Neto  ] took a call conveying the news that [LOC Brazil  ] had just experienced a 2 million cubic meters decrease from the normal natural gas flow from [LOC Bolivia  ] of 30 million cubic meters ( Note: this coincides with reports about an explosion connecting a major [ORG Petrobras  ] field to the pipeline in [LOC Tarijia  ] , see Reftel H on same subject . 
News reports on September 11 say the flow has now decreased by three million cubic meters and suggest the decrease could last for ten to fifteen days . 
The situation remains fluid and Congen [LOC Sao Paulo  ] is now hearing rumors of a fifty percent reduction in flow . 
End Note ) . 
He said his next task would be to convene a group for contingency planning . 
According to [ORG Lima Neto  ] , there are already draft plans in place for how to compensate for a sudden loss of gas supply , which includes using alternate fuels to power some electrical stations , for instance liquid fuels , as well as increasing production in some of the coal powered thermal plants . 
As a result of a shortage in available gas in October of 2007 , [LOC Brazil  ] has already had an opportunity to put some of these plans into practice but [ORG Lima Neto  ] was less than sanguine about the ability of the existing plans to compensate for a continued interruption in the gas flow . 
While noting that [LOC Brazil  ] could weather a short term decrease in supply without too much economic disruption , he admitted that a more drawn out scenario could result in rationing . 
( Note: One mitigating factor in a potential electrical crisis could be that following an abundant rainy season , [LOC Brazil  ] 's reservoirs are better prepared to meet demand . 
Over 80 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's electrical supply comes from hydro power , with ten percent coming from natural gas . 
The fact the oil prices have gone down recently and that the threat comes at during the seasonal decline in energy usage might help on the electrical supply side as well . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Were the interruption in gas supply to be serious , it would be industrial output that would suffer the most . 
In [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , nearly 100% of industrial production requires gas and in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] itself , the number is close to 60% . 
The 2007 annual survey by the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State Industry Center of its 551 company members conducted in November 2007 showed that more than 38 percent of natural gas consumption is used by [LOC Sao Paulo  ] industry . 
The study showed that the lack of natural gas would boost production costs by about 10 percent on average . 
Furthermore , the [ORG Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) reported that an eventual natural gas shortage would totally interrupt 19 percent of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] industries , 20 percent of industries would be partially affected with the absence of natural gas , and 61 percent could substitute another fuel for natural gas if there was a shortage . 
( See Reftel B for more information on natural gas in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
) Several industries including chemicals ( 30 percent ) , textiles ( 28 percent ) , and ceramics ( 26 percent ) rely heavily on natural gas as their primary energy source. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT:  ] Since Evo Morales' attempts to nationalize [MISC Petrobras'  ] gas investments in [LOC Bolivia  ] and dictate a contract price , [LOC Brazil  ] has been aware of the need to move away from dependence on [MISC Bolivian  ] gas , as well as diversify their energy matrix . 
For primarily political reasons , [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] has committed to an additional $1 billion dollars worth of gas investments in [LOC Bolivia  ] over the next five years . 
It is unclear whether recent events will have an impact on future plans . 
Last year , [LOC Brazil  ] launched plans to build three liquefied natural gas ( [ORG LNG  ] ) regasification terminals , the first of which [ORG Petrobras  ] inaugurated in August at the Port of [LOC Pecem  ] , which is capable of supplying 7 mm3/d of natural gas . 
The terminal adds another 11 percent to [LOC Brazil  ] 's natural gas supply and equals about half of the natural gas consumption destined to [LOC Brazil  ] 's gas-fired power plants and more modest increases in capacity are expected for 2009 . 
The new discoveries of oil and gas reserves at pre-salt levels ( more than 4000 meters below the surface ) in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] , provide hope for a larger increase in the long term . 
In the near term , [LOC Brazil  ] will hope that the current interruption is limited and short-lived . 
Ample water reserves and new [ORG LNG  ] and bioelectricity capacity ( Reftel G ) will help them avoid shortages in electrical supply but [LOC Brazil  ] will need to ensure that the disruption is limited to avoid damage to industrial output . 
We also expect that this will provide added incentive for [LOC Brazil  ] to continue to try to develop sources such as bioelectricity so as not to be subject to the whims of [PER Morales  ] and now , his opposition .
