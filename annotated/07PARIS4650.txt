( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) SUMMARY . 
Franco-Colombian hostage [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] 's " proof of life " letter had a profound impact on President [PER Sarkozy  ] and only reinforced his personal engagement , according to [ORG Presidential Advisor  ] for the [MISC Americas'  ] [PER Damien Loras  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is reviewing options following a December 1 telephone call with President [PER Uribe  ] , who rejected [PER Sarkozy  ] 's suggestion that Senator [LOC Cordoba  ] serve as mediator and instead renewed a request for [MISC French  ] mediation . 
While [PER Sarkozy  ] declined such a role without first having access to [ORG FARC  ] leaders and potential leverage such as prisoner releases , [PER Loras  ] noted the [MISC French  ] President is set to do something " spectacular " in the coming days , foreshadowing [PER Sarkozy  ] 's broadcast messages to [PER Betancourt  ] and the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] attributes the long sought " proof of life " to [PER Chavez  ] 's intervention , a view he shared with [PER Uribe  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is considering how to discreetly use [PER Chavez  ] 's influence with the [ORG FARC  ] to [MISC French  ] ( [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] ) advantage . 
Comment: Given [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal involvement , we must stay in as close as possible contact with the [MISC French  ] as this process unfolds -- a judgment that we are told [PER Sarkozy  ] shares . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) On December 4 [ORG Presidential Advisor  ] for the [ORG Americas  ] [PER Damien Loras  ] reported that [PER Sarkozy  ] is redoubling his efforts on behalf of [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] following receipt of her " proof of life " ( [ORG POL  ] ) letter addressed to her mother . 
[PER Loras  ] said that [PER Sarkozy  ] is set to do something " spectacular " and noted that the [MISC French  ] President had considered meeting [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Manuel Marulanda  ] , but ultimately decided otherwise . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is ready to act " in the coming days . 
" [PER Loras  ] welcomed a close dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] on this issue adding [PER Sarkozy  ] intends to discuss the hostage situation with President [PER Bush  ] . 
[PER Loras  ] alerted us late December 5 that [PER Sarkozy  ] was about to record for radio broadcast a " compassionate message " to the hostages , letting them know the international community is mobilized to seek their freedom , along with a video message to the [ORG FARC  ] appealing for the humanitarian release of [PER Betancourt  ] . 
[PER Loras  ] stated that the Presidency was concerned that her physical and psychological state had deteriorated to the point that her life was in danger. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) [PER Loras  ] reported that on the December 1 phone call between [PER Sarkozy  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] told [PER Uribe  ] that [ORG POL  ] now exists -- which he attributed to [MISC Chavez'  ] intervention . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] did not ask [PER Uribe  ] to reconsider his decision on [PER Chavez'  ] mediation , proposing instead that [PER Uribe  ] consider authorizing Senator [LOC Cordoba  ] . 
According to [PER Loras  ] , [PER Uribe  ] was negative , asking [PER Sarkozy  ] instead to resume [LOC France  ] 's own mediation . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] replied that he would not -- at least until [PER Uribe  ] provides: a ) access to all [ORG FARC  ] leaders , and b ) negotiating leverage , in the form of [ORG FARC  ] prisoner releases or other such bargaining tools. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) [PER Loras  ] made clear that [PER Sarkozy  ] is not pushing the [ORG GOC  ] to reinstate [PER Chavez  ] as chief negotiator , understanding that this is politically impossible for [PER Uribe  ] . 
At the same time , the [ORG GOF  ] believes [PER Uribe  ] purposely unraveled [PER Chavez  ] 's efforts precisely because they appeared to be working ; the [MISC Colombians  ] feared [PER Chavez  ] was making the negotiations too political and too public . 
[PER Loras  ] professed understanding of why [PER Chavez  ] 's methods are unacceptable to [PER Uribe  ] , but warned ( without elaboration ) that there will be problems if [PER Uribe  ] attempts to unravel [ORG GOF  ] efforts . 
[PER Loras  ] said the [MISC French  ] are still trying to decide how to discreetly use [PER Chavez  ] 's demonstrated influence with the [ORG FARC  ] to the [MISC French  ] ( and [LOC US  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] ) advantage , in such a way that is not counter-productive with [LOC Bogota.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) [PER Loras  ] highlighted the importance of working with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC Colombians  ] on this issue . 
He added that [PER Sarkozy  ] would make this point directly to President [PER Bush  ] during their next phone conversation . 
Noting that [PER Sarkozy  ] will not refrain from asking for help , he reported that [PER Sarkozy  ] will ask President [PER Bush  ] to use our influence to prevail on [PER Uribe  ] to give [LOC France  ] space to work on hostage release and to intensify intelligence exchange on the issue . 
[PER Loras  ] admitted that [LOC France  ] 's intelligence in the region is quite minimal ; [LOC France  ] wants to increase its knowledge of the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Loras  ] noted specifically that some [ORG FARC  ] leaders reportedly have family in [LOC Europe  ] , which could be useful leverage at an appropriate time .
