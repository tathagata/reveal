( U ) Summary . 
Following the informal [ORG FTAA  ] discussions in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] March 31-April 1 , which ended without agreement ( reftel ) , [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) officials launched an aggressive media campaign to get the word out that [LOC U.S.  ] intransigence was to blame for the impasse . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] was widely quoted , claiming a [LOC U.S.  ] pullback from the compromise achieved in the [ORG FTAA Ministerial  ] in [LOC Miami  ] last November . 
Although the level of public outrage was lower than that following the [LOC Trinidad  ] & [LOC Tobago  ] [ORG TNC  ] meeting last year , the private sector and other ministries have apparently communicated to [ORG Itamaraty  ] their consternation regarding its negotiating posture . 
Despite headlines heralding an end to the [ORG FTAA  ] , high-level officials from the [ORG Ministry of Development  ] , [ORG Industry and Trade  ] ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) informed Ambassador that the [ORG GoB  ] has not abandoned the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations and is formulating new proposals , including improved market access offers . 
End Summary. ---------- Blame Game ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Immediately following adjournment of the informal [ORG FTAA  ] discussions in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] , [ORG Itamaraty  ] launched a media blitz to assign blame for the impasse that prevented progress in negotiating a common set of rights and obligations under the new [ORG FTAA  ] framework . 
[LOC U.S.  ] , and to a lesser extent [MISC Canadian  ] , intransigence was identified as the main culprit . 
In interviews and in discussions with members of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] accused the [LOC U.S.  ] of trying to reopen the [ORG Miami Ministerial  ] compromise , most probably in reference to a proposal to allow for additional provisions in the common set in the future . 
He reiterated [MISC Brazilian  ] claims that the [LOC U.S.  ] is unwillingly to provide real market access for [MISC Brazilian  ] agricultural products , specifically in addressing domestic support and export subsidies , while it is trying to reintroduce new rules in [LOC Brazil  ] 's sensitive areas of services , investment , [ORG IPR  ] and government procurement . 
As in the past , [PER Amorim  ] argued for moving on from the " philosophical " discussion on rules and instead beginning market access negotiations ; he reaffirmed that [LOC Brazil  ] will not negotiate services market access in any format other than bilateral . 
On April 7 and 8 , there was widespread reporting on the contents of a letter Minister [PER Amorim  ] sent to USTR [PER Zoellick  ] on April 5 , outlining [ORG GoB  ] concerns with [LOC U.S.  ] positions within the common set negotiations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Similar commentary was attributed to [PER Regis Arslanian  ] and [PER Tovar  ] da [PER Silva Nunes  ] , Director General of [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's Trade Negotiations Department , and Head of its [ORG FTAA Division  ] , respectively . 
In addition to bemoaning the lack of [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility , [PER Nunes  ] asserted to journalists that the outcome of the [LOC Buenos Aires  ] talks had prompted [ORG Itamaraty  ] to shift its trade policy focus toward negotiation of agreements with some 30 developing countries , with the [ORG EU  ] , and toward [ORG WTO  ] trade talks . 
Negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] were singled out as exemplifying a more collaborative process than the [ORG FTAA  ] and a higher probability of success , a questionable assertion . 
Striking a more balanced tone , [PER Amorim  ] told [MISC Brazilian  ] Deputies on April 6 that the [ORG GoB  ] plans to focus more on the [ORG WTO  ] negotiations , unwilling to concede anything within the regional [ORG FTAA  ] or bi-regional [ORG EU  ] agreements that would undermine [LOC Brazil  ] 's interests within the global trade talks. ---------------------------------------- Not Everyone is On Board with [ORG Itamaraty  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Despite [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's best efforts , not everyone appeared to accept its characterization of the problems besetting the negotiations nor its supposed readjustment in policy focus . 
While less public than after the contentious Trade Negotiations Committee ( [ORG TNC  ] ) meeting in [LOC Trinidad  ] & [LOC Tobago  ] last September , press reports cited divergent positions within the [ORG GoB  ] , and private sector demands that [ORG Itamaraty  ] demonstrate more flexibility in the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
In addition , an " O Estado " editorial last weekend refused to play the blame game and called for [ORG Itamaraty  ] flexibility , pointing out how much [LOC Brazil  ] stands to lose from failure of [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG MDIC  ] 's more forward leaning position on the [ORG FTAA  ] was confirmed in informal discussions with Minister [PER Furlan  ] and staff during a dinner hosted by Ambassador April 7 . 
[ORG DCM  ] , Deputy Senior Commercial Officer and Econoff also attended . 
[PER Mario Mugnaini  ] , Executive Secretary of Camex , the [ORG GoB  ] 's formal decision-making body for trade policy , rejected assertions that the [ORG GoB  ] does not want to negotiate the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
However , he conceded that subsequent to the informal [LOC Buenos Aires  ] talks , [ORG Itamaraty  ] is being forced to moderate its positions . 
He was adamant that pressure from , among others , Minister [PER Furlan  ] would ensure a more pragmatic approach by [MISC Brazilian  ] negotiators in the future , and argued that [ORG TNC  ] Co-Chars should meet soon to consider how to get the process moving again. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Expressing optimism on an eventual successful outcome for the [ORG FTAA  ] , [PER Mugnaini  ] pressed the [MISC Brazilian  ] line that the current impasse on the common set language would more easily be overcome if market access negotiations could proceed immediately . 
At least part of [PER Mugnaini  ] 's optimism seems to flow from his expectations of a positive response by the [LOC U.S.  ] toward improved Mercosul market access offers in goods , services and investment , which he intimated would be unveiled soon . 
( Note , one press report admitted that Mercosul 's initial goods market access offer was the " worst " of any [ORG FTAA  ] delegation . 
) Ambassador insisted that [LOC Brazil  ] must work seriously according to the directions from Ministers in [LOC Miami  ] and negotiate the common set before market access talks could begin . 
[PER Mugnaini  ] made references to [ORG Itamaraty  ] moving " in the right direction " regarding positions on common set issues , but provided no further detail . 
Articles the same day reported a lack of support within the [ORG Ministries of Development  ] , [ORG Agriculture  ] , and Finance , as well as within the private sector , for [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's insistence on including within the common set a mechanism to compensate for agricultural domestic support within the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Canada.  ] ------- Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Recent events and statements would seem to confirm [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's lack of commitment toward the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations . 
That being said , there remain pro-FTAA forces within the [MISC Brazilian  ] government and private sector that make it very difficult for [ORG Itamaraty  ] to just walk away . 
There is plenty of room for continued mischief , however . 
The [ORG GoB  ] will likely continue to press for four-plus-one market access talks to begin forthwith . 
Eventually , [ORG Itamaraty  ] may present a reformulation of some of its positions within the common set talks , but these may not prove useful in bridging the gaps that currently exist between [ORG FTAA  ] delegations . 
We suspect that representatives from other ministries and from the private sector who are pushing for more flexibility by [ORG Itamaraty  ] , may not prove as effective checks on [ORG Itamaraty  ] excesses as would be hoped , due to a less than full appreciation of the nuances within the common set text negotiations. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Post recommends a continued neutral posture regarding blame for an inability to reach consensus on the common set elements so that domestic interests will have the space to make their own case for a change in [ORG GoB  ] posture . 
However , reinforcement of the message that what we are seeking is a " balanced " common set would be helpful in keeping the focus on revising or eliminating the more problematic [ORG GoB  ] positions .
