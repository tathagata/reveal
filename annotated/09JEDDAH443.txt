JEDDAH  ] 0292 B. [LOC JEDDAH  ] 0079 [LOC JEDDAH  ] 00000443 001.2 OF 002 Classified [ORG By: Consul General Martin R. Quinn  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] Behind the facade of [PER Wahabi  ] conservatism in the streets , the underground nightlife for [MISC Jeddah’s  ] elite youth is thriving and throbbing . 
The full range of worldly temptations and vices are available -- alcohol , drugs , sex -- but strictly behind closed doors . 
This freedom to indulge carnal pursuits is possible merely because the religious police keep their distance when parties include the presence or patronage of a [MISC Saudi  ] royal and his circle of loyal attendants , such as a Halloween event attended by [PER ConGenOffs  ] on . 
[ DETAIL REMOVED ] Over the past few years , the increased conservatism of [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s external society has pushed the nightlife and party scene in [LOC Jeddah  ] even further underground . 
End summary . 
Elite party like the rest of the world , --------------------------------------- just underground ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Along with over 150 young [MISC Saudis  ] ( men and women mostly in their 20’s and early 30’s ) , [PER ConGenOffs  ] accepted invitations to an underground Halloween party at PrinceXXXXXXXXXXXX residence in [LOC Jeddah  ] on [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Inside the gates , past the [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] security guards and after the abaya coat-check , the scene resembled a nightclub anywhere outside the [MISC Kingdom:  ] plentiful alcohol , young couples dancing , a [ORG DJ  ] at the turntables , and everyone in costume . 
Funding for the party came from a corporate sponsor , [PER XXXXXXa U.S.-based  ] energy-drink company as well as from the princely host himself . 
Royalty , attended by “khawi , ” keep religious police at bay --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Religious police/CPVPV ( Commission for the [ORG Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice  ] ) were nowhere to be seen and while admission was controlled through a strictly-enforced guest list , the partygoers were otherwise not shy about publicizing the affair . 
According to a young [MISC Saudi  ] from a prominent [LOC Jeddah  ] merchant family , the [MISC Saudis  ] try to throw parties at princes’ houses or with princes in attendance , which serves as sufficient deterrent to interference by the [ORG CPVPV  ] . 
There are over 10,000 princes in the [LOC Kingdom  ] , albeit at various levels and gradations -- “Royal Highnesses” ( “Saheb [PER Al Sumou Al Maliki”  ] ) signified by direct descent from King [PER Abdulaziz  ] , and mere “Highnesses” ( “Saheb [PER Al Sumou”  ] ) from less direct branches of the [PER Al Saud  ] ruling family . 
Our host that evening , xxxxxx ( protect ) , traces his roots to [MISC Thunayan  ] , a brother of [MISC Mohammad  ] , [ORG Amir  ] of [LOC Diriyyah  ] and Nejd ( 1725-65 ) , King Abdullah’s direct ancestor , six generations back . 
Although PrinceXXXXXXXXXXXX is [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] not in line for the throne , he still enjoys the perks of a mansion , luxury car , lifetime stipend , and security entourage . 
( [PER Note: Most  ] of the prince XXXXXXXXXXXX’s security forces were young [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] men . 
It is common practice for [MISC Saudi  ] princes to grow up with hired bodyguards from [LOC Nigeria  ] or other [MISC African  ] nations who are of similar age and who remain with the prince well into adulthood . 
They are called “khawi , ” derived from the [MISC Arabic  ] word “akh , ” meaning “brother.” The lifetime spent together creates an intense bond of loyalty . 
End note . 
) Availability of black market alcohol , prostitutes , and drugs --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Alcohol , though strictly prohibited by [MISC Saudi  ] law and custom , was plentiful at the party’s well-stocked bar , well-patronized by Halloween revellers . 
The hired [MISC Filipino  ] bartenders served a cocktail punch using “sadiqi , ” a locally-made “moonshine.” While top-shelf liquor bottles were on display throughout the bar area , the original contents were reportedly already consumed and replaced by sadiqi . 
On the black market , a bottle of [PER Smirnoff  ] can cost 1,500 riyals when available , compared to 100 riyals for the locally-made vodka . 
It was also learned through word-of-mouth that a number of the guests were in fact “working girls , ” not uncommon for such parties . 
[LOC JEDDAH  ] 00000443 002.2 OF 002 Additionally , though not witnessed directly at this event , cocaine and hashish use is common in these social circles and has been seen on other occasions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: [MISC Saudi  ] youth get to enjoy relative social freedom and indulge fleshly pursuits , but only behind closed doors -- and only the rich . 
Parties of this nature and scale are believed to be a relatively recent phenomenon in [LOC Jeddah  ] . 
One contact , a young [MISC Saudi  ] male , explained that up to a few years ago , the only weekend activity was “dating” inside the homes of the affluent in small groups . 
It is not uncommon in [LOC Jeddah  ] for the more lavish private residences to include elaborate basement bars , discos , entertainment centers and clubs . 
As one high society [MISC Saudi  ] remarked , “The increased conservatism of our society over these past years has only moved social interaction to the inside of people’s homes.” End comment .
