Stewart  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [PER Mohamed Farnawany  ] , senior advisor to Gamal [PER Mubarak  ] , told poloff on August 27 that the [ORG GOE  ] is not happy that the [ORG USG  ] never responded to the [ORG ESF  ] proposal to create an endowment . 
Poloff reminded [PER Farnawany  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] did respond , explaining the difficulties with the concept . 
[PER Farnawany  ] said that [LOC Egypt  ] nonetheless feels that the [LOC U.S.  ] is making assistance decisions unilaterally , without substantive engagement with [ORG GOE  ] officials , and said [LOC Egypt  ] would like to discuss the direction of both [ORG ESF  ] and [ORG FMF  ] . 
When poloff noted that the proposed ten-year [ORG FMF  ] package was exactly what [LOC Egypt  ] requested , [PER Farnawany  ] said [ORG MoD  ] concern stems from the decision to increase [LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG FMF  ] , thereby moving away from the 3:2 assistance ratio that previously existed . 
He noted that the " [ORG MoD  ] Generals " used to be the [ORG USG  ] 's " staunchest allies , " but now " things are different . 
" He said he believes the [ORG MoD  ] officials want more engagement with [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC DoD  ] counterparts. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Poloff told [PER Farnawany  ] that the current focus on [LOC Egypt  ] 's counter-smuggling efforts will likely continue . 
The advisor said that [LOC Egypt  ] needs a new approach with the [LOC Hill  ] -- a point he said he had raised recently with Ambassador [PER Fahmy  ] . 
He thought that [ORG MoD  ] 's receptivity to [LOC U.S.  ] proposals on enhancing border security ( particularly technical support and training ) may be linked to the degree to which [ORG MOD  ] perceives that the administration is vigorously defending [ORG FMF  ] .
