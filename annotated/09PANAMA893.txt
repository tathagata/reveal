A year in review CLASSIFIED [PER BY: Stephenson  ] , Ambassador ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>Â¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Summary: [ORG Tocumen International Airport  ] captures the [MISC Panamanian  ] zeitgeist in a concentrated dose . 
[ORG Tocumen  ] 's legitimate status as a crux of [LOC Latin America  ] 's passenger and cargo traffic is tainted by a seamy underside of alien smuggling , money laundering , narcotics trafficking and corruption . 
Explosive growth , a result of organizational changes and the expansion and modernization of facilities in the last six years , has made [ORG Tocumen  ] a major regional air hub for both passengers and cargo . 
[LOC Panama  ] 's geographical position and transactional business culture have fostered [ORG Tocumen  ] 's emergence ; however , these advantages mask institutional weaknesses in the customs , immigration and security services . 
Money laundering , narcotics trafficking and alien smuggling have grown apace with airport commercial operations and are a blemish on [ORG Tocumen  ] 's success . 
USG agencies at post have significant resources directed at [ORG Tocumen  ] and enjoy good working relationships with [MISC Panamanian  ] authorities , yet [LOC Panama  ] lacks a strategy or a systematic approach to addressing the problems at the airport . 
Helping the [MISC GOP  ] develop and implement an integrated approach to customs , immigration and security at [ORG Tocumen  ] will require fomenting [MISC Panamanian  ] political willpower . 
[LOC Panama  ] has tackled such high-stakes tasks before and has good examples to follow in both its banking sector and its administration of the crown jewel - the [LOC Panama  ] Canal . 
End Summary . 
Dramatic Ascent - But Turbulence Ahead ? --------------------------------------------- 2 . 
( U ) [ORG Tocumen  ] is the busiest airport in [LOC Central America  ] and a crucial link for travel between [LOC North  ] and [LOC South America  ] . 
It served 4.5 million passengers in 2008 , up 19.5% from 2007 , and double the number of passengers served in 2004 . 
This lift-off has been fueled by the conversion of the airport in 2003 to a government owned company known as [ORG Tocumen S.A.  ] , and an $80 million expansion project completed in 2006 . 
Another $80 million expansion currently underway is expected to be complete by 2011 , and should double passenger capacity again to approximately 10 million per year . 
The new north terminal will be capable of handling the [MISC Airbus A380  ] , the world 's largest passenger aircraft . 
[ORG Copa Airlines  ] , with one of the youngest fleets in the [ORG Americas  ] , has been a major driver of growth as well . 
The busiest international route out of [ORG Tocumen  ] is [LOC Bogota  ] , with [LOC Miami  ] following close behind . 
There is also a growing air freight facility which in 2008 handled over 86,000 tons of cargo , up 5% from the prior year . 
4 . 
( U ) [LOC Panama  ] 's geographical advantages and open business climate have spurred [ORG Tocumen  ] 's growth . 
However , those same advantages have also facilitated a culture of corruption which has accompanied [ORG Tocumen  ] 's physical and commercial development . 
Money laundering , alien smuggling , and narcotics trafficking are proliferating . 
Customs , immigration and police authorities are uncoordinated , undertrained and inadequate to meet current demand , much less the challenges associated with another doubling in traffic in the coming years . 
5 . 
( C ) Mission attachC ) s with ongoing involvement at [ORG Tocumen  ] include [ORG Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ] ( [ORG ICE  ] ) , Customs and [ORG Border Protection  ] ( [ORG CBP  ] ) , the [ORG Federal Aviation Administration  ] ( [ORG FAA  ] ) and the [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration  ] ( [ORG DEA  ] ) . 
For [ORG CBP  ] , alien smuggling presents the most serious problem . 
Passengers enter [ORG Tocumen  ] on arriving flights without customs or immigration inspection and are free to wander about the duty free " sterile area " as they wait to catch connecting flights . 
According to post 's [ORG CBP  ] attachC ) , smugglers regularly fly into [ORG Tocumen  ] , meet their charges in the transfer area and give them fraudulent travel documents and airline tickets before both parties depart on connecting flights . 
In effect , it is possible for someone to depart their country of origin , transit [LOC Panama  ] , and not have to face any kind of inspection until they show up at a [LOC U.S.  ] border post . 
A common route is for migrants to transit [ORG Tocumen  ] on their way to [LOC Mexico  ] and ultimately , an illegal entry across the [LOC U.S.  ] southern land border . 
In the short term , [ORG CBP  ] is working to augment the [ORG Advance Passenger Information System  ] ( [ORG APIS  ] ) , which would provide [LOC U.S.  ] authorities a passenger manifest for all flights inbound to [ORG Tocumen  ] . 
In the longer term , the [MISC Panamanian  ] customs service needs organizational reform . 
Unlike [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG CBP  ] officers , who combine full law enforcement authority with their customs and immigration enforcement mandate , [MISC Panamanian  ] immigration and customs officials have extremely limited enforcement authority and ability . 
They must turn to [MISC Panamanian  ] [ORG National Police  ] for help when detaining or seeking to investigate immigration or customs violators - a function for which the police are not well trained . 
6 . 
( C ) The flow of illicit [LOC U.S.  ] dollars , both smuggled and openly declared , represents another threat . 
[ORG DEA  ] estimates that a single bulk cash smuggling operation of four individuals , including the President 's second cousin , [PER Ramon Martinelli  ] , moved up to $30 million per month through [ORG Tocumen  ] last year . 
( Note: post has no information linking President [PER Martinelli  ] to money laundering ) . 
Meanwhile , customs seizures of undeclared cash amounted to only $4.5 million in 2008 . 
Record keeping at customs is entirely paper based , leading to an inevitable loss of documentation and plentiful opportunities for bribing customs officials . 
While customs officials are routinely bribed to let through suitcases full of cash , it is not uncommon for travelers to bring in declared amounts of $250,000 . 
Legitimate large cash transfers can be partly explained by the proximity of the [ORG Colon Free Zone  ] ( [ORG CFZ  ] ) , where a significant percentage of transactions are on a cash basis . 
Even here , however , crime , corruption and free enterprise mix . 
[ORG CFZ  ] businessmen have related to embassy officers instances in which travelers who declare large amounts of cash are robbed after departing [ORG Tocumen  ] - the robbers having been tipped off by corrupt customs officials . 
In the long term , [ORG ICE  ] cites a systemic lack of standardized customs reporting methods , and a lack of checks and balances as a major problem for [MISC Panamanian  ] customs at [LOC Tocumen  ] . 
Finally , drug trafficking is a major problem at the cargo terminal , where [ORG DEA  ] has seen an increase in 200 to 300 kilogram shipments moving via established cargo carriers . 
Such large shipments are impossible without the complicity of corrupt customs and law enforcement officials , and most likely cargo company employees as well . 
7 . 
( U ) The [ORG Federal Aviation Administration  ] placed a regional attachC ) at post in December 2009 , with the mission in [LOC Panama  ] of assisting the [MISC GOP  ] in improving the oversight of civil aviation . 
[ORG FAA  ] seeks to accomplish this by working with [LOC Panama  ] 's [ORG Civil Aviation Authority  ] in adopting [ORG FAA  ] best practices and standards . 
Up in the Air --------------- 7 . 
( U ) Despite the growing problems , [LOC Panama  ] has shown a typical reluctance to peel back the lid on an enterprise which appears to be benefiting all parties involved . 
The duty-free zone at [LOC Tocumen  ] is a good example of the kind of live-and-let live attitude permeating the airport . 
The duty free zone has few rules and little oversight , and is controlled by the [MISC Waked  ] and [PER Motta families  ] , who paid $173 million for a ten-year concession . 
In the same manner as alien smugglers exploit the transfer area , it is possible for transferring passengers to enter the duty free zone without inspection , carrying virtually any amount of cash . 
This cash can then be laundered through the duty free shops , which are not subject to serious regulatory scrutiny . 
Anecdotally , the traveler at [LOC Tocumen  ] looking for food or something to read will find that the options are restricted to one [ORG Dunkin Donuts  ] , one coffee shop , and zero bookstores ; at the same time , it is impossible to avoid the polo shirts , jewelry , electronics and perfume available at every turn . 
8 . 
( S ) Comment: There are signs that the [MISC GOP  ] understands the importance of [LOC Tocumen  ] to their status as a regional center for transit of goods and people . 
The board of directors at [LOC Tocumen  ] includes the Deputy Finance Minister [PER Frank De Lima  ] and the Deputy Minister of the [LOC Presidency  ] , [PER Maria Fabrega  ] , both of whose bosses are among the most powerful leaders in the [PER Martinelli  ] administration . 
Yet the board also includes Tourism Minister [PER Salomon Shamah  ] , suspected of links to drug traffickers . 
[LOC Panama  ] needs to find the political will to address the problems facing [LOC Tocumen  ] in the same manner that they have administered another national treasure which gives them their distinct status as a bridge of the [ORG Americas  ] and a regional transportation hub - The [LOC Panama  ] Canal . 
There has always been a bright line drawn around the canal , fencing it off from the corruption which is so damaging to the rest of the country . 
In the last 10 years this has become true of certain sectors of the banking industry here as well ; [LOC Panama  ] 's steps in addressing the problems in its banking sector can serve as an inspiration for reform of the airport . 
Such reform will benefit [LOC Panama  ] and the [LOC United States  ] as we seek to secure our extended borders and strengthen institutions and the rule of law here .
