( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: Since January , Post has experienced increasing difficulties in obtaining visas for incoming [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] visitors , both for educational and cultural programs . 
The Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) has canceled some programs outright , and has simply not approved visas for others . 
These recent difficulties appear to be the result of an intentional decision by elements within the [ORG GOL  ] , rather than the routine difficulties of navigating the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy . 
End summary . 
RECENT HISTORY OF CANCELED PROGRAMS 2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Prior to January , Post experienced several months of relatively successful [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] ( [ORG PAS  ] ) programming , particularly educational programs . 
We brought in our first [MISC English Language Fellow  ] , conducted successful [MISC English Language Specialist  ] workshops , and gained routine access for the first time to students and faculty at [MISC Libyan  ] public universities . 
However , since January several programs have been canceled by the [ORG GOL  ] . 
While the [MISC Embassy  ] has successfully secured visas for other visitors during the same time period , [ORG PAS  ] visitors have been singled out for denial . 
Failure to issue visas to [ORG PAS  ] visitors is not a reciprocity issue , as Post has expedited and issued more visas more quickly in response to [MISC Libyan  ] official requests than the [ORG GOL  ] has done for [MISC Embassy  ] official requests ( see reftel ) . 
3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In early January , DAS [PER Tom Farrell  ] , accompanied by other [ORG ECA  ] staff and 4 representatives of [MISC American  ] universities and higher education , planned to come to [LOC Libya  ] to meet with representatives of [MISC Libyan  ] universities and government officials . 
Despite prior agreement to the visit and assurances that visas would be approved , the visas were not approved . 
The General People 's Committee for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG GPCFLIC  ] , or MFA-equivalent ) blamed the snafu on their internal bureaucracy . 
4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In mid-January , the [ORG GOL  ] canceled the planned performance of a musician following a [LOC U.S.  ] court decision awarding compensation to families of victims of the [LOC UTA  ] bombing . 
The [ORG GPCFLIC  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] that it was not the right time for such performances , stating that it would be " confusing " for the [ORG GOL  ] to facilitate concerts by a [LOC U.S.  ] musician in the wake of the court decision , and suggesting that the [LOC U.S.  ] postpone it . 
Shortly thereafter , the musician 's visa , which had previously been approved , was canceled . 
5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In early February , the [ORG GOL  ] abruptly canceled an event that the [ORG GPC  ] for Higher Education ( [ORG GPCHE  ] ) had requested of the [MISC Embassy  ] - an information session for recipients of [MISC Libyan  ] scholarships for post-graduate study in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Expecting to brief several hundred students , [ORG CAO  ] and visiting [ORG Regional Education Advising Coordinator  ] were notified of the event 's cancellation minutes before it was scheduled to begin . 
Despite [MISC Embassy  ] efforts to provide information to scholarship recipients , [ORG PAS  ] still frequently receives complaints about the [MISC Libyan  ] students' lack of preparation for applying to and studying at [LOC U.S.  ] universities . 
6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In mid-April , the [ORG GOL  ] canceled the performance of a second musical group . 
[ORG PAS  ] had taken precautionary steps to confirm that the musical performance would be permitted , and obtained approval from various government bodies . 
Our local partners had also obtained approval to host performances . 
In early April , our local partners contacted us to let us know they received instructions to cancel the scheduled performances , and were told that given the state of the bilateral relationship , such programs were not a priority for the [MISC Libyan  ] government . 
In subsequent conversations , [MISC Libyan  ] officials told the P/E Chief that public programming was not appropriate because the bilateral relationship was " not fully normalized " . 
7 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) In April , Post expected an [MISC American  ] Fulbright grantee to come to [LOC Libya  ] to work with professors at [ORG Garyounis University  ] . 
Despite written approval of the Program and numerous assurances , the visa has not been issued . 
The Head of the [ORG Protocol Office  ] told a Post employee that he wished that [ORG Public Affairs  ] programs would simply go away . 
( Comment: We believe that the [ORG Protocol Office  ] has instructions not to issue visas to [MISC Embassy  ] visitors who will engage the public , and that excuses blaming lack of visa issuance on bureaucratic snafus is merely a dodge . 
End comment . 
) 8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In late April , Post expected the publishers of [ORG MEPI  ] 's My [ORG Arabic Library  ] program to come to [LOC Libya  ] to meet with the [ORG GPC  ] for TRIPOLI 00000372 002 OF 003 Basic Education to discuss implementation of the program , which [MISC Libyan  ] authorities have approved . 
The visas were not approved , much to the disappointment of officials at the [ORG GPC  ] for Basic Education , who , in addition to the My [ORG Arabic Library  ] program , are eager to meet with [MISC American  ] publishers to discuss using [MISC American  ] textbooks in public schools . 
9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) During the first week of May , Post planned to host Dr. [PER Steve Morrison  ] of [LOC SAIS  ] . 
The [ORG Green Book Society  ] , the [ORG National Center for Disease Control  ] , and [ORG Al Fatah University Medical School  ] had all agreed to host Dr. [PER Morrison  ] for events . 
His visa was not approved . 
CONFLICTING MESSAGES 10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) It is clear that our [MISC Libyan  ] education and cultural partners want [MISC Americans  ] to come to [LOC Libya  ] to implement joint programming . 
They are greatly disappointed when [MISC Americans  ] do not receive their visas , and complain of conflicting points of view they hear behind the scenes . 
The [ORG GPC  ] for Basic Education is tasked with finding the best textbooks possible , and has been advised by some government parties to use [MISC American  ] textbooks . 
Without being able to host [MISC American  ] publishers , however , they cannot find a way to practically implement that plan . 
[MISC Libyan  ] universities are tasked by the highest levels to send their students to the [LOC U.S.  ] for study . 
University administrators , however , are blocked from bringing [MISC American  ] professors and representatives to [LOC Libya  ] to establish the relationships necessary to achieve that objective . 
11 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) At a recent meeting at [ORG Al Fatah University Medical School  ] , the dean complained about the inability of [MISC Libyan  ] academic administrators to achieve the unrealistic and frequently contradictory goals of [MISC Libyan  ] politicians . 
He described how " politicians " have told him that he has to send 2,000 students to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , and [LOC Great Britain  ] for medical school next year . 
When he explains that [MISC Libyan  ] students will not be accepted into medical schools in those countries , he is viewed as a nay-sayer . 
When he introduces plans to improve the quality of [LOC Libya  ] 's medical education ( such as bringing [MISC American  ] medical school representatives here to discuss curriculum development and establishing joint programs , meeting [MISC American  ] accreditation standards , and sending [MISC Libyan  ] students to [LOC U.S.  ] schools for undergraduate degrees followed by medical school ) , " the politicians " criticize him for his suggestions that will take too long to implement . 
( Note: A key part of a proposed [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] project being implemented with USG assistance involves sending [MISC Libyans  ] to [LOC U.S.  ] medical schools for advanced training . 
End note . 
) 12 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) The new Educational Attachi to the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] recently expressed to us his nervousness that the goals he is tasked with achieving are unattainable . 
While [MISC Libyan  ] officials have repeatedly stressed that they want [MISC Libyan  ] students to return to [LOC U.S.  ] universities by the thousands , the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy , and to a large extent , [MISC Libyans  ] themselves , remain intransigent in terms of their willingness to meet the requirements necessary to matriculate in [LOC U.S.  ] schools . 
MORE DIFFICULTIES AHEAD 13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) While for the past two years [MISC American  ] universities have given [MISC Libyan  ] students substantial benefit of the doubt in accepting them , there are already rumblings from those universities about [MISC Libyan  ] students . 
Universities have recently remarked about the high level of complaining from [MISC Libyan  ] students and the intense bureaucratic support they and their families require . 
They also note that while some [MISC Libyan  ] students have done exceptionally well academically , others are performing terribly . 
A number of [ORG GOL  ] scholarship students reportedly have paid more than 1000 [MISC Libyan  ] Dinars each to poorly-qualified local " educational agencies " for assistance in completing university admissions forms ( typically [ORG Colorado State  ] and [ORG Oklahoma State  ] ) and visa applications . 
The universities have found that many such admissions forms contain inaccurate information and essays they suspect the students themselves did not write . 
Universities are now reviewing applications from [MISC Libyans  ] with more intense scrutiny to try to better screen them . 
14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In addition to more intense scrutiny by [MISC American  ] universities , [MISC Libyan  ] students hoping to study in the [LOC U.S.  ] may also begin to experience more intense scrutiny during their visa interviews . 
Post 's Consular Officer recently learned that at [ORG Oklahoma State University  ] , 50% of [MISC Libyan  ] students have applied for public benefits . 
It is not clear yet whether that indicates TRIPOLI 00000372 003 OF 003 that [ORG GOL  ] scholarship funds are insufficient , and/or that [MISC Libyan  ] students budget such funds poorly . 
Another possibility is that [MISC Libyan  ] students are seeking to inappropriately exploit public benefits , even if they have sufficient funds from other sources . 
( Note: [MISC Egyptian  ] Embassy officials recently told P/E Chief that [MISC Libyan  ] university students in [LOC Egypt  ] , who number in the thousands , routinely abuse public benefits reserved for [MISC Egyptian  ] students . 
) 15 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) Comment: As the bilateral relationship has grown more tense during the past several months as a result of outstanding compensation issues and human rights issues , [ORG GOL  ] officials who oppose reengagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] have gained ground in putting a halt to PAS programs in [LOC Libya  ] . 
While [MISC Libyan  ] government officials still desire reengagement with the [MISC American  ] academic community , their lack of understanding of the academic environment coupled with the recent trend of refusing [MISC American  ] visitors prevents [MISC Libyan  ] academic officials from achieving those goals . 
Post will continue to push in particular for educational programs and visitors .
