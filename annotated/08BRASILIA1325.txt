( U ) [MISC Summary: The  ] relationship between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] is as productive and broad-based as it has ever been , with an excellent relationship between President [PER Bush  ] and President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] and new cooperation mechanisms on private sector priorities ( CEO Forum ) , commercial policy matters ( [ORG Commercial Dialogue  ] ) , economic policy matters ( [ORG Economic Partnership Dialogue  ] ) , and biofuels ( March 7 2007 [ORG MOU  ] ) , as well as a June civil aviation agreement that will permit expanded passenger flights and cargo services . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] share the goals of fostering hemispheric stability , promoting democracy , developing a consensus on next steps regarding climate change , and achieving a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the [LOC Doha  ] round of [ORG WTO  ] negotiations in the near-term . 
Energy is increasingly becoming a key element in the bilateral relationship as [LOC Brazil  ] takes center stage on biofuels commercialization and oil exploration . 
Regarding CEO Forum priorities , [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] have had Bilateral Tax Treaty discussions and continued discussions on bilateral investment issues . 
[ORG USG  ] has supported workforce development initiatives and other exchanges , helped organize venture capital events , made significant progress on reducing visa wait times , and advanced infrastructure cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] ; we are now working on a full time [ORG USTDA  ] presence in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Your visit is an important part of an overall strategic plan for developing and highlighting the bilateral energy relationship . 
Building on the success of our bilateral [ORG MOU  ] on biofuels , we believe it is critical that we expand and deepen [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] energy relations as [LOC Brazil  ] looks to become a global energy player . 
Your visit is the third in a series of three high-profile visits to build these relationships and to call public attention to the joint efforts . 
DOE Acting Deputy Secretary [PER Kupfer  ] 's August 4-7 visit laid the broad groundwork for expanded energy cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER U/S Jeffery  ] 's October 2 ( Rio ) and 3 ( [LOC Brasilia  ] ) visit focused on facilitating [MISC American  ] involvement in the exploration and exploitation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's newly discovered deep water oil resources , next steps in our successful cooperation on biofuels , and how to continue to deepen our cooperation on the broad spectrum of economic engagement with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Your visit will include the CEO Forum in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and a day in Rio to explore opportunities to expand commercial interests , especially in the energy area . 
We expect the Deputy Minister of [ORG Mines and Energy  ] to travel to the [LOC US  ] for further meetings in October , laying the groundwork for the [ORG Mines and Energy  ] Minister to visit the [LOC US  ] in the spring . 
We believe these visits are critical in demonstrating to the [MISC Brazilians  ] that we are strong economic partners in multiple areas , as they chart their course in developing their newly discovered oil resources and possibly play a larger role in ensuring global energy security. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Your trip also provides a special opportunity to shape the future of the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] broader economic relationship . 
Our bilateral relationship has been extremely strong in recent years and [MISC Brazilians  ] are acutely aware of the upcoming change of administrations and want to know what it means for them . 
We expect that your meetings will include questions about the transition . 
Particularly in the wake of the stalled [PER WTO Ministerial  ] , affirming our commitment to the [MISC US-Brazil  ] economic relationship and exploring the path forward on trade an other economic issues will be an important focu for your trip . 
End Summary. ----------------- [ORG Financial Crisis  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Though your trip is primarily focused on indentified priorities of the CEO Forum , the fact that timing coincides with the escalating financial crisis means this will be an inescapable topic in many of your meetings . 
In response to the financial crisis , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] has partially reversed its hawkish anti-inflationary policies by adding 13.2 billion reais to the financial system in hopes of freeing up credit and has indicated that future interest rate hikes are unlikely given the diminishing threat of inflation due to a global slowdown and falling commodity prices ( that said , analysts widely expect GOB to raise interest rates again at the end of October above the current 13.75% SELIC rate ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's Finance Minister continues to assert that [LOC Brazil  ] is well-positioned to weather the crisis while he and [ORG Central Bank  ] contacts confirm moves to try to mitigate the effects of the crisis . 
President [PER Lula  ] continues to criticize the [LOC United States  ] for a lack of financial regulation , claiming that a global regulatory body is needed to address the sitution . 
[PER Lula  ] acknowledged publicly for the first time very recently , that the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy may be adversely impacted by the crisis , drawing widespread criticism for not having a real grasp on the potential of the crisis . 
Although [MISC Brazilian  ] markets have taken a beating in recent days and the real [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001325 002 OF 007 has seen an erosion of its strength from earlier this year , large [MISC Brazilian  ] companies are confident that they will weather the storm , though there are worries about the effect of a tightened credit market for smaller enterprises. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Shared [ORG Interests: Biofuels Cooperation  ] -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] signed a Memorandum of Understanding in March of 2007 to cooperate on the development and deployment of biofuels through a three-pronged approach: bilateral , third countries , and global . 
The most recent meeting of the bilateral [ORG Steering Committee  ] under the [ORG MOU  ] was held October 3 , with [PER U/S Jeffery  ] leading the meeting for the [LOC U.S.  ] side . 
We continue to make steady progress under all three pillars and post believes that [LOC Brazil  ] is newly invigorated to move more rapidly toward achieving our joint priorities , in part to due to new leadership at the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and in part due to the desire to show progress at the November 17 - 21 biofuels conference being hosted by [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Under each of the pillars of the [ORG MOU  ] we are moving forward . 
Bilaterally , we are working to advance the research and development of next-generation biofuels technology . 
We have had two exchange visits between our scientists who have submitted a cooperative work plan and developed an [ORG MOU  ] between our [ORG National Renewable Energy Laboratory  ] ( [ORG NREL  ] ) and Petrobras'research laboratory- CENPES which will be announced at the November conference . 
Under the third country pillar , we are working jointly to bring the benefits of biofuels to select third countries through feasibility studies and technical assistance aimed at stimulating private sector investment in biofuels . 
We have thus far done studies and identified funding for 21 projects in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [LOC St. Kitts  ] and [LOC Nevis  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] , and [LOC El Salvador  ] . 
At last week 's meeting of the [ORG Biofuels Steering Committee  ] , we confirmed our intention to expand the program to five more countries ( most likely [LOC Gutamala  ] , [LOC Hondorus  ] , [LOC Jamaica  ] , [LOC Guinea  ] Bisseau , and [LOC Sengal  ] , with announcement pending notification of those countries ) . 
Globally , to advance the commoditization of biofuels , the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [ORG European Commission  ] ( [ORG EC  ] ) , working through the [ORG International Biofuels Forum  ] ( [ORG IBF  ] ) , fast-tracked a process with their respective standards organizations improving the compatibility of bioethanol and biodiesel standards and codes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition to the three pillars of the [ORG MOU  ] , we have reached out to the private sector via the [ORG Private Sector Advisory Group  ] to elicit their input , interests , and concerns . 
The [ORG Advisory Group  ] , which is made up of private sector experts from both countries , was informed of activities under the [ORG MOU  ] and has begun the process of providing input and advice to the [ORG Steering Group  ] . 
The [ORG Advisory Group  ] recently prepared a well-received proposal to help fast track critical certifications in [LOC Brazil  ] to facilitate the entry of [LOC U.S.  ] firms into the market . 
The proposal is currently under consideration by the [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
The [ORG Private Sector Advisory Group  ] is also making plans for a meeting on the margins of [LOC Brazil  ] 's November 17-21 biofuels conference. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On sustainability of ethanol , the [MISC Brazilians  ] have agreed to work with us to define indicators and criteria for global use via the [ORG Global Biofuels Energy Partnership Together  ] we are leading the process to ensure sustainability is discussed on a scientific basis and to avoid having the issue used as a trade barrier . 
Hopefully this type of cooperation will help to ensure that [LOC Brazil  ] will not repeat the type of unfortunate remarks President [PER Lula  ] made at the [ORG FAO  ] meeting in [LOC Rome  ] several months ago differentiating corn and sugar ethanol . 
We are assured by MRE that this is not their plan . 
Continuing to engage with the GOB is likely the best assurance that it will not veer down that path. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One area where [LOC Brazil  ] has been seeking our engagement is the upcoming biofuels conference November 17 -21 in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
GOB participants may press you on POTUS attendance and also look for assurances of high level participation regardless . 
We are told 24 countries will be represented at the Ministerial level , while the [LOC Philippines  ] and [LOC Australia  ] will be represented at the [LOC Head of State  ] level . 
The GOB is using the conference as an opportunity to establish leadership in the field but is open to our ideas on topics and outcomes . 
We view the conference , in part , as an opportunity to leverage their interest in producing conference deliverables to carry some of our goals forward. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) The ethanol industry in [LOC Brazil  ] continues to grow . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] just announced the formation of a new multibillion dollar biofuels subsidiary to manage Petrobras' entry into the production side of the ethanol market . 
In the coming year alone , [LOC Brazil  ] 's production of sugarcane-based ethanol is projected to increase 14.8 percent . 
On the demand side , [LOC Brazil  ] 's use of modest tax breaks have led new car purchasers to opt overwhelmingly for " flex-fuel " cars that can [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001325 003 OF 007 run on either gasoline , ethanol , or any combination of the two . 
This year ethanol surpassed gasoline as the major automotive fuel . 
Domestic demand consumes 85 percent of all production . 
The other 15 percent is exported , primarily to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The ethanol private sector is increasingly partnering with international companies in building production facilities , as well as addressing the internal logistics problems that undermine the profitability of ethanol exports . 
These include infrastructure bottlenecks in [LOC Brazil  ] as well as various international tariff regimes. --------------------------------------------- ---------- Beyond Biofuels: Other [ORG Energy Cooperation Opportunities  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During his visit here August 4-7 , [ORG Energy Acting Deputy Secretary Kupfer  ] engaged in some very productive conversations with GOB officials seeking to identify potential areas of cooperation . 
He heard from the various departments of the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] ( [ORG MME  ] ) a laundry list of things we might do together , including cooperating on reinvigorating our respective civil nuclear programs , alternative energy sources such as solar and wind , clean coal , interconnectivity , energy efficiency , and shale exploration , as well as oil exploration . 
Under the 2003 [ORG MOU  ] , we have the mechanism for such cooperation but it is important that now [ORG DOE  ] and [ORG MME  ] establish working groups to move the process forward . 
Post and [ORG DOE  ] are working to set up a [ORG DVC  ] to further pursue this collaboration . 
[ORG Brazilian Mines and Energy Minister  ] [PER Lobao  ] has expressed interest in travelling to the [LOC United States  ] this spring to continue to deepen this cooperation. - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - An Emerging Player in the [ORG Oil Sector  ] - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The discovery of potentially massive offshore reserves of oil and gas estimated to contain between 30-80 billion barrels of oil equivalent could put [LOC Brazil  ] within the top ten oil countries by reserves . 
Though the possibilities have generated a great deal of excitement , industry observers caution that the technological challenges involved with ultra-deepwater drilling are extensive , including a worldwide shortage of equipment such as drilling rigs , meaning that developments will probably be slow in coming . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] appears to be overextended internationally and is hamstrung by limited equipment resources . 
However , it has launched a multi-billion dollar procurement initiative and is reexamining its international priorities so that it can focus on domestic opportunities . 
[LOC U.S.  ] oil companies are poised and ready in many cases to take on more exploration opportunities - a message that we do not believe industry has adequately conveyed to the GOB . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has expressed interest in having [LOC U.S.  ] companies involved in the exploitation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's oil reserves as well as in receiving high-level [LOC U.S.  ] visitors with the intention of developing closer bilateral ties. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Lula  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Energy Policy Council  ] are expected to announce a regulatory reform plan later this year , likely proposing a small , new non-operational state-owned oil company to manage the new pre-salt reserves . 
Such a company would maintain the ownership rights for oil reserves and partner with private oil companies through production sharing agreements to explore and produce oil in the pre-salt area , possibly following the [MISC Norwegian  ] model . 
Other possible models include increasing the government 's share in [ORG Petrobras  ] , or increasing the government 's take through higher concessions . 
In response to criticisms that the process to rewrite the current Petroleum law would be too time consuming , Energy Minister [PER Lobao  ] has told us that the Executive has fast track legislative measures available to it that should enable the legislation to be enacted early in 2009 , though [ORG Ministry contacts  ] have told us that looks increasingly unlikely due to concerns over how to handle distributions to states and municipalities . 
The national oil regulatory agency , industry , and analysts believe such a change of legislation would be much more complicated , possibly lasting years , thus their interest in maintaining the current concession contract model with increased royalties. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) Meanwhile , further leasing of all offshore exploration blocks has been suspended pending the [ORG National Energy Policy Council  ] 's deliberations ; an auction of on-shore blocks is planned for December 2008 . 
According to Minister [PER Lobao  ] , there will be no new development of offshore reserves for the near future as the GOB defines its approach to the presalt finds , focusing instead on on-shore and shallow water exploration . 
This is a very sensitive sovereignty issue for the government , featuring minefields of bureaucratic infighting . 
We have tended to approach the topic by offering the observations of our industry and willingness to share our experiences in this field , if so desired . 
[ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001325 004 OF 007 - - - Trade - - - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilians  ] have made a valiant effort to resurrect the [LOC Doha  ] negotiations and at least publicly have not given up hope that the round can still be salvaged . 
This is an optimal time to discuss the future of trade , regardless of the results of [LOC Doha  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has traditionally cited the need to maintain coherence with its [MISC Mercosul  ] partners and its role as a leader of the [MISC G-20  ] as constraining its flexibility in trade negotiations . 
[MISC Mercosul  ] is an economic mechanism created for political reasons . 
However , during what looks now to have likely been the end-game of the [LOC Doha Round  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] calculated that the benefits to [LOC Brazil  ] of agreeing to compromise in an attempt to achieve a carefully balanced agreement of industrial and agricultural liberalization outweighed the political cost of moving beyond [LOC Argentina  ] 's preferred negotiating position . 
This decision drew the praise of industry as well as the think tank/academic community , which has generally assessed that [LOC Brazil  ] 's move will not have a long-term negative effect on [LOC Brazil  ] 's position within the [MISC G-20  ] or [MISC Mercosul  ] . 
It has however drawn criticism from [LOC India  ] which in recent days blamed [LOC Brazil  ] 's position in [LOC Doha  ] on efforts to try to curry favor with the [LOC U.S.  ] The [PER Lula  ] government has continued to try to bring about a resolution to the round , while still cultivating its bonds with longtime allies such as [LOC Argentina  ] through trade missions and development of a currency exchange mechanism for bilateral trade. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although [LOC Brazil  ] has made clear it will negotiate FTAs or other trade agreements only together with its [MISC Mercosul  ] partners , its leadership in [MISC Mercosul  ] is key to concluding any agreement ( REFTELS F and G ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's continuing emergence as a country willing to engage on trade and other economic issues in its national interest may indicate further potential for expanded interest in economic cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
GOB has made clear its continued interest in concluding a [LOC Doha  ] agreement in the near term. - - - - - - - - - - Bilateral Tax Treaty - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Treasury  ] 's [PER Michael Mundanca  ] and [PER Tom Ralph  ] concluded a round of talks September 30-October 2 with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Receita Federal  ] toward an eventual Bilateral Tax Treaty . 
Participants made good progress in gaining mutual understanding of each others' systems regarding limitation of benefits , capital gains , permanent establishment , and withholding taxes and agreed compromises can be found on these issues . 
[ORG Receita  ] was able to accept [ORG Treasury  ] 's proposed language on information exchange , and briefed that the [ORG TIEA  ] is unlikely to move forward before the end of the year . 
Regarding transfer pricing , all [LOC US  ] treaties incorporate the arm 's length standard and all [LOC US  ] treaties provide for competent authority resolution of transfer pricing ( and other ) disputes . 
Due to [MISC Brazilian  ] legislative constraints unlikely to change in the foreseeable future , a treaty with [LOC Brazil  ] would not provide for either . 
Similarly , it would not be possible for [MISC Receita  ] to include an arbitration clause in a treaty . 
We can explore with the CEO Forum whether there is industry interest in concluding a Bilateral Tax Treaty that would not include arms length transfer pricing or dispute resolution. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding the [ORG TIEA  ] , within the business community , congress , and even among ministries' officials , ambivalence exists on the issue . 
Distrust in [MISC Receita Federal  ] 's ( the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG IRS  ] ) ability to safeguard information and suspicions among some that tax authorities mis-collect and mis-use information ( fueled by long memories here of scandals past ) may impact willingness to press for further information exchange , depending on the types of information requested . 
This ambivalence regarding information exchange is currently playing out in the [ORG Congressional  ] ratification process for the [ORG TIEA  ] . 
This more limited " down payment " on the BTT which provides for information exchange subject to domestic law constraints , has drawn opposition from congressional representatives , legal experts and some in the business community as allegedly violating the [MISC Brazilian  ] constitution . 
Prospects for passage are uncertain. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Bilateral Investment Treaty - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It remains unlikely that [LOC Brazil  ] would be willing to commit to binding arbitration at the federal , state or municipal level for investor-state disputes . 
[LOC Casa Civil  ] ( [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] ) to date believes contract provisions can govern dispute resolution and that an international arbitration mechanism is unnecessary . 
Discussions with [LOC Casa Civil  ] , [LOC MRE  ] , Finance , [ORG MDIC  ] ( [ORG Commerce  ] ) and [ORG CAMEX  ] ( roughly TPRG ) consistently indicate that , for strategic reasons to increase [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001325 005 OF 007 [ORG GoB  ] and [ORG Congressional  ] confidence in negotiating investment agreements , [LOC Brazil  ] prefers to start discussions first with [LOC Argentina  ] , where [MISC Brazilian  ] companies have major investments and have experienced significant investment problems , according to our interlocutors . 
While ministries confirm that the [MISC CAMEX-agreed  ] framework that [LOC Brazil  ] will use to start its conversation with [LOC Argentina  ] does not currently contain any reference to investor-state dispute settlement , some interlocutors are hopeful this element could be introduced over time into this dialogue . 
We view willingness to engage with [LOC Argentina  ] as a positive sign that [ORG GoB  ] is beginning to tackle investment agreement conversations ; however , we believe both [MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC US  ] business as well as USG will need to continue to press in order to convince [ORG GoB  ] to engage substantively with us on the provisions of a bilateral investment treaty in the near term . 
We plan a side meeting to discuss investments on the margins of the October 30 State/MRE led [ORG Economic Partnership Dialogue.  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ORG Infrastructure Cooperation  ] - - - - - - - - -- - - <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) The [ORG USTDA Regional Director  ] for [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] had an excellent series of meetings in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and Rio with [LOC Casa Civil  ] , [ORG BNDES  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Development Bank  ] ) , state governments , and other interlocutors this spring . 
[ORG USTDA  ] developed a preliminary list of possible projects with potential for [MISC American  ] investment and/or participation ( ideas include areas like port dredging , oil platform water discharge , urban waste management , transportation projects ) . 
[ORG USTDA  ] led seven definitional missions to [LOC Brazil  ] ( aviation , oil and gas , surface transportation - rail and intermodal , environment - wastewater and solid waste treatment , and information technology ) . 
The head of [ORG USTDA  ] visited [LOC Brazil  ] September 15-17 to further pursue these projects and signed three grant agreements . 
[ORG USTDA  ] Director Walthers has expressed his readiness to add a permanent [ORG USTDA  ] person in [LOC Brazil  ] in [LOC FY09  ] . 
In addition , the [ORG Treasury  ] DAS for [LOC Latin America  ] recently visited [LOC Brazil  ] to continue dialogue with [LOC Casa Civil  ] , [ORG Planning Ministry  ] and [ORG BNDES  ] officials on how best to structure infrastructure cooperation. - - - - - - - - Civil Aviation - - - - - - - - <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) We recently succeeded in significantly expanding civil aviation opportunities . 
Negotiations in [LOC Washington  ] in June ( following the first round of civair negotiations in ten years in December 2007 ) yielded a June 26 agreement on a package of significant liberalization measures . 
The agreement , phased in over four years , will permit weekly flights to be expanded from 105 to 154 for each country . 
The agreement will , for the first time , permit carriers to provide some services on a codeshare basis with third-country partner airlines . 
Under the agreement , [LOC U.S.  ] carriers are permitted to serve five new cities in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The June agreement will expand weekly cargo flights from 24 to 35 immediately and to 42 in 2010 . 
Cargo charter flights will increase from 700 to 1000 , and to 1250 by 2010 . 
Airlines are already moving to take advantage of expanded access . 
On August 8 , [LOC Delta  ] and [MISC American  ] 's applications to begin using 21 new frequencies to north/northeast destinations were approved . 
This agreement represents a significant new area of cooperation between the [LOC US  ] and the recently re-organized [MISC Brazilian  ] civil aviation authority and lays the foundation for increased tourism and investment links between our countries , including to the previously underserved north and northeast of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The agreement provides for further negotiations by 2010 , and we understand [MISC CEOs  ] may press for further liberalization negotiations in the near-term. ----- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Development and [ORG Corporate Social Responsibility  ] ( [ORG CSR  ] ) - - --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( U ) Despite progress toward consolidating democracy and stabilizing the economy , [LOC Brazil  ] remains unequal in income distribution , with over 50 percent of the nation 's wealth concentrated in 10 percent of the population . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is home to 50 percent of the people who live in extreme poverty in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
In this context , microenterprise development and increased corporate social responsibility can serve as important mechanisms to improve [LOC Brazil  ] 's economic development , social stability and equity . 
In 2006 , [LOC U.S.  ] companies in [LOC Brazil  ] employed 321,477 people and invested a total of 205 million reais ( approximately $128 million ) in corporate social responsibility projects in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The companies supported more than 800 projects and engaged 15,513 individuals in volunteer programs . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] was instrumental in founding the [ORG Mais Unidos  ] ( More [MISC United  ] ) a partnership of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] , [ORG USAID  ] , and a group of 105 [LOC U.S.  ] companies operating in [LOC Brazil  ] , joining forces in promoting social partnerships to develop [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001325 006 OF 007 innovative solutions to reach underserved populations , to fight poverty and inequality , and to promote sustainable social and economic development . 
[ORG USAID  ] Administrator Fore made a successful trip in August through which she greatly expanded the visibility of public-private partnerships and [LOC U.S.  ] efforts in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Mais Unidos  ] has now established a private sector Board that includes several CEO Forum members ( [ORG Cummins  ] , [ORG Intel  ] and [ORG Citibank  ] ) as well as [ORG Microsoft  ] , [ORG Dow  ] and [PER Bedmon Dickinson.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( U ) Microenterprises account for 99 percent of all formal business , employ up to 60 percent of the formal workforce , and account for 20 percent of the country 's GDP . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's extremely complex business regulatory environment , however , has contributed to a high rate of business failure , inhibiting the development and sustainability of microenterprises . 
USAID-funded economic development assistance is focused primarily on strengthening microenterprise development and productivity , while challenging large corporations operating in [LOC Brazil  ] to assume even greater corporate social responsibility. -------------------------- BASIC ECONOMIC BACKGROUND -------------------------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] is the tenth largest economy in the world , and received investment grade from [LOC Standard  ] and [ORG Poor 's  ] and [ORG Fitch  ] this year . 
While [LOC Brazil  ] is major producer and exporter , exports make up only 14 percent of this domestic services-led economy . 
Agriculture makes up 36 percent of exports and 13 percent of GDP . 
[LOC Brazil  ] also distinguishes itself as a major exporter of civilian aircraft , steel , and petrochemicals . 
The [LOC United States  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's top trading partner and [LOC China  ] has just moved in position as number two . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is both an overseas investor and an FDI destination point , as well as being both an assistance donor and recipient . 
Having recently become technically self-sufficient in oil production ( they export some but also have to import due to the type of crude [LOC Brazil  ] currently produces ) , [LOC Brazil  ] boasts a diverse energy matrix and they look to become a net oil exporter in coming years . 
For all the economic progress of recent years ( stemming from the stabilizing [MISC Plan Real  ] implemented in 1994 ) , [LOC Brazil  ] remains a relatively closed economy encumbered by many structural obstacles , and one in which some 40 percent still live in poverty , though the expanding middle class has been the largest economic story here in the past year. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( U ) Annual GDP growth was 5.4 percent for 2007 , and inflation approximately 4 percent . 
GOB 's inflation target for 2008 is 4.5 percent ( current estimated inflation is 6.54 percent-the high end of the target band ) and the government has taken a hawkish approach to managing interest rates . 
The [ORG SELIC  ] benchrate now stands at 13.75 percent and market forecasts expect the [ORG SELIC  ] could go as high as 15 percent by early 2009 . 
The currency , the real , has appreciated strongly , though the financial crisis has caused it to lose ground in just the past two months . 
The global slowdown has had an impact on [LOC Brazil  ] 's trade surplus - for the first seven months of 2008 , [LOC Brazil  ] posted a surplus of 14.65 billion [MISC USD  ] , down from 23.92 billion the same period in 2007 . 
While the export sector has been dampened , the strong currency has permitted [MISC Brazilian  ] companies to ramp up investment in capital equipment .
