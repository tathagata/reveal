( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Russia-Georgia  ] conflict , according to [ORG BP  ] , may be forcing [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to re-examine needs for regional stability and security , perhaps with leaders concluding that a large foreign presence in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and the region is necessary to create an environment of greater security , predictability and dependability . 
Azerbaijan’s overland pipelines are relatively well protected ; offshore assets are much more vulnerable . 
The GOAJ is not well coordinated internally or with regional partners to address emergencies . 
[ORG BP  ] reports that , in their view , the [MISC Russians  ] did not target the [ORG BTC  ] or [ORG Baku-Supsa  ] pipelines in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
However , terrorists were responsible for the [ORG BTC  ] explosion earlier this month in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Future oil and gas projects in the region depend on security of existing infrastructure , particularly [ORG BTC  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] must now act constructively and come to terms with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] on [ORG Shah Deniz Phase  ] I pricing and [ORG Shah Deniz Phase II  ] volumes for purchase . 
The Nabucco project may be more realistically pursued on a piecemeal basis , with existing infrastructure patched together in [LOC Europe  ] , fed by a “two-country inter-connector” across the [LOC Caspian Sea  ] . 
In BP’s analysis , there is a great deal of natural gas in the [LOC South Caspian  ] , but “Nabucco may be ten years too early.” End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] briefed Senator [PER Richard Lugar  ] and staff on developments in [LOC Caspian  ] energy August 25 , highlighting the current status of offshore operations and regional transport in light of the ongoing [MISC Russia-Georgia  ] conflict and previous disruption of the [MISC Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan  ] ( [ORG BTC  ] ) pipeline . 
[ORG BP External Affairs Vice  ] President [PER Seymour Khalilov  ] and [ORG BP  ] Vice President for Pipelines and Terminals [PER Rashid Javanshir  ] were also present . 
Ambassador Derse accompanied Senator [PER Lugar  ] ; [ORG DCM  ] and Pol-Econ Chief also attended . 
[ORG Georgia Crisis Changes Azerbaijan’s Tune  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] noted that [ORG BP Managing  ] Director [PER Andy Inglis  ] visited [LOC Baku  ] from [LOC London  ] the previous week , meeting with President [PER Aliyev  ] , the [ORG State Oil Company of Azerbaijan  ] ( [ORG SOCAR  ] ) and others . 
The purpose of that visit was supposed to be discussions on [ORG BP  ] reinvestment in Azerbaijan’s economy ; instead , given the ongoing crisis in the [LOC Caucasus  ] , regional security concerns dominated the talks . 
[PER Schrader  ] said that previously Azerbaijan’s leadership had been sounding increasingly self-confident -- even arrogant , at times -- and had downplayed the need for foreign investment in the next generation of projects . 
With events in [LOC Georgia  ] , and heightened [MISC Russian  ] activity in the [LOC Caucasus  ] , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] “may now be changing its tune.” [PER Schrader  ] suggested that the [MISC Russia-Georgia  ] conflict is forcing [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to re-examine needs for regional stability and security , with leaders apparently coming to an early conclusion that a large foreign presence in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and the region creates an environment of greater security , predictability and dependability . 
Security Concerns Resonate ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Javanshir  ] said that overland pipeline routes within [LOC Azerbaijan  ] are reasonably well protected , with [ORG BP  ] leading efforts to monitor . 
The offshore sector is more vulnerable , as it is much more difficult to protect . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Azerbaijan  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Javanshir  ] said that the [ORG BTC  ] explosion and [LOC Georgia  ] crisis served as a “wake-up call” for [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , which finds itself with few transport options and mounting losses in export revenues . 
In the opinion of [ORG BP  ] , the time has come for [LOC BAKU  ] 00000815 002 OF 003 “less gamesmanship and chess playing” and more serious cooperation among [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX Criticism of [LOC Turkey  ] , Acts of Terror ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] was also highly critical of Turkey’s [ORG BOTAS  ] , which built the [ORG BTC  ] on [MISC Turkish  ] territory as a turn-key project . 
Construction was delayed and over-budget and [ORG BP  ] has always suspected quality-control issues . 
Moreover , the [LOC Turks  ] are responsible for pipeline security , including protection against illegal tapping and terrorism . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [LOC Turkey  ] Must Cooperate on [ORG Shah Deniz  ] I , II ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Javanshir  ] said that future gas projects , like the trans-Caspian and Nabucco pipelines , “are now dependent on [ORG BTC  ] security . 
If [ORG BTC  ] cannot be protected , governments and private investors will not come forward to promote additional [LOC Southern Corridor  ] projects.” [PER Schrader  ] emphasized that there is “lots of gas in the [LOC South Caspian  ] region , ” between [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
Time , however , is needed to bring this gas to markets . 
The Nabucco project “may be ten years too early , ” [PER Schrader  ] and [PER Javanshir  ] said . 
In the nearer term , the [LOC Turks  ] must realize that they “cannot be greedy.” [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is willing to sell [LOC Turkey  ] approximately 4 billion bcm of [ORG Shah Deniz Phase II  ] gas , but a minimum 6-8 bcm , as demanded by [LOC Ankara  ] , is not possible. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] reported that [ORG Shah Deniz Phase II’s  ] “technical path” is still on target for 2014 . 
All depends , however , on a commercial deal with [LOC Turkey  ] on transit and sales . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] , rather than [ORG StatoilHydro  ] , will have the lead on that front . 
Complicating the matter , however , is ongoing negotiations on sales price under the current ( [ORG Shah Deniz Phase  ] I ) contract . 
[ORG BP  ] underscored the need for [LOC Turkey  ] to reach agreement with suppliers on pricing as soon as possible , as contractual terms expired in April. “SOCAR is now selling gas to [LOC Turkey  ] at $130 per thousand cubic meter ( tcm ) , while the [MISC Russians  ] are shipping gas through [ORG Blue Stream  ] at $450/tcm.” In all likelihood , [LOC Turkey  ] is amassing large debts to [ORG SOCAR  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] stressed that negotiations on this issue must be completed by the first quarter of 2009 . 
[ORG ACG Deep Gas Could Be Developed  ] ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Following the visit of [PER Andy Inglis  ] , [ORG BP  ] now sounds relatively optimistic about an extension of the [ORG ACG BAKU  ] 00000815 003 OF 003 production sharing agreement , which would allow the [ORG AIOC  ] consortium to extend production of oil at offshore fields ( and book the reserves to increase company values ) . 
[ORG BP  ] also retains hopes of clinching a separate agreement to develop non-associated or “deep gas” at the [ORG ACG  ] fields . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] had been holding a firm line in negotiations on [ORG PSA  ] extension and “deep gas , ” criticizing [ORG BP  ] for [ORG Shah Deniz  ] production delays [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Recent  ] events in [LOC Georgia  ] , however , may be causing [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to reconsider its line , according to BP’s representatives . 
More on Nabucco -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Schrader  ] noted that Nabucco , as a grand vision , is still rather hard to imagine . 
A single pipeline -- “a 48-inch pipe” -- running from [LOC Turkmenistan  ] to [LOC Vienna  ] , may never be realized . 
Rather , it is more constructive to look at the Nabucco project as a piecemeal project , with “capillaries” connecting existing infrastructure . 
This could begin in the [LOC Caspian  ] , with a “two-country inter-connector” sufficing as a “Trans-Caspian [LOC Pipeline.”  ] Much of this work has already begun in [LOC Central Europe  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] , which has interest in investing in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] , now worries that [LOC Ashgabat  ] may “get scared off” from such a project because of [MISC Russia’s  ] actions in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Returning to the “10 years too early” comment , [PER Schrader  ] and [PER Javanshir  ] expressed confidence that “substantial volumes of gas” would be moving from [MISC Turkmenistan’s  ] and Azerbaijan’s offshore to the West by 2030 . 
Comment --------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The crisis in [LOC Georgia  ] , and the myriad of oil and gas transport problems that resulted from it , has caused Azerbaijan’s leadership to reconsider security and energy issues . 
Aliyev’s expressed intention to re-open discussion with [ORG BP  ] on [ORG PSA  ] and [ORG ACG  ] deep gas , after a long period of inaction , is significant , and likely a result of a new appreciation for the security benefits of a significant western presence in the energy sector in the wake of regional developments . 
Still , we expect [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to maintain a tough negotiating line on [ORG ACG PSA  ] extension and access to [ORG ACG  ] deep gas , as well as natural gas pricing , supply and transit with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Embassy agrees with BP’s assessment that the future of energy projects in the region depends critically on improving the security of existing infrastructure , and on visibly heightened cooperation in this respect among Caspian/Caucasus states .
