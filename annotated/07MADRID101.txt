( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy officials from [LOC Legat  ] , the [ORG Consular Section  ] , and the [ORG Political Section  ] met with [ORG National Court Chief Prosecutor  ] Javier [PER Zaragoza  ] on 1/18 to review developments in the [MISC Spanish  ] court case charging three [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen with murder and war crimes in the April 2003 death of [MISC Spanish  ] cameraman [PER Jose Couso  ] during the takeover of [LOC Baghdad  ] ( [ORG REFS A  ] and B ) . 
Poloff noted that they were not acting under instruction and simply wanted to meet informally with [PER Zaragoza  ] to review a case of great sensitivity to the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Emboffs  ] noted the rapid decision of Examining Magistrate [PER Santiago Pedraz  ] to re-issue international detention orders against the three accused servicemen ( REF B ) and asked whether [MISC Spanish  ] authorities intended to submit bilateral extradition requests to the [LOC U.S.  ] as well for the three servicemen. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Zaragoza  ] said that he was not yet in a position to determine whether or not bilateral extradition requests would be filed because he had not reviewed the case himself sufficiently to establish the best course of action ( [PER Zaragoza  ] was not working at the [ORG National Court  ] at the time the [PER Couso  ] case was reviewed and dismissed ) . 
He noted that the [PER Couso  ] case had moved swiftly at a time when he was preoccupied with the recent handover of [ORG ETA  ] terrorist suspects to [LOC Spain  ] by [MISC French  ] authorities , which involved new legal ground for the [MISC Spanish  ] authorities . 
However , [PER Zaragoza  ] said that he was aware of [MISC Spanish  ] Attorney General [PER Candido Conde Pumpido  ] 's interest and involvement in the case ( REF C ) and assured [PER Emboffs  ] that his office would carefully study all aspects of the case and would proceed at a deliberate pace . 
He said that the existence of a [LOC U.S.  ] investigation of the incident was understood to be an important consideration , but left open the possibility that the Prosecutor 's Office would seek additional information from [ORG USG  ] authorities. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Consular Section  ] 's legal adviser asked [PER Zaragoza  ] whether he could confirm news reports that the Examining Magistrate had requested that his office prepare a report on whether [LOC U.S.  ] assets could be embargoed ( frozen ) as part of a civil component of the [PER Couso  ] family 's suit against the [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] scanned the Examining Magistrate 's request and said that the magistrate 's order merely transmitted this request by the plaintiffs ; the [ORG National Prosecutor  ] 's office had to undertake a careful review of [MISC Spanish  ] case law before responding to the request. //COMMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our objective in this initial meeting with [PER Zaragoza  ] was to sensitize him to the [ORG USG  ] 's concerns in this case , since he had no involvement in this case when it first came before the [ORG National Court  ] . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] is a seasoned prosecutor with a clear understanding of the political implications of this case and we anticipate that he will proceed as carefully as he said he would . 
As soon as [PER Zaragoza  ] informs us how he intends to proceed , we will convey this information to interested [LOC Washington  ] agencies . 
We will also follow up at higher levels in the [MISC Spanish  ] Government to reinforce the implications of this case for bilateral relations and on international law .
