End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a December 3 meeting [MISC Australian  ] Ambassador [PER Martin Quinn  ] recounted to Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] that earlier that day FM [PER Spanta  ] told him that GIRoA is still unhappy about the [LOC London  ] conference . 
[PER Quinn  ] also said that during [MISC Australian  ] PM [PER Kevin Rudd  ] 's November 11 visit with [MISC Australian  ] troops in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , [PER Rudd  ] had delivered ( by phone ) a tough message to [PER Karzai  ] . 
According to [PER Quinn  ] , [PER Karzai  ] had blamed POTUS for [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's current problems in a rambling incoherent response . 
[PER Quinn  ] did not elaborate but noted that the Government of [LOC Australia  ] was unhappy about comments [PER Karzai  ] made in his November 9 NPR interview with [PER Margaret Warner  ] in which [PER Karzai  ] said the [LOC West  ] is not in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for the sake of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but to fight the war on terror. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Observers , perspectives of the political and security situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] had been more optimistic in early 2008 , but attitudes have swung from too optimistic to too pessimistic , opined [PER Quinn  ] . 
Policy shouldn't be determined based on optimism or pessimism , assessed [PER Quinn  ] , we just need to keep working at it . 
[LOC Uruzgan  ] had been a mess a couple of years ago , troubled by lots of tribal problems , but with good efforts , today it is much more stable and secure . 
[LOC Australia  ] plans to continue to increase its development projects in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and is moving into less controlled areas such as [PER Dai Kundi  ] , where new projects include construction of a gravel road . 
Tribal Interest in Reintegration ; Expansion of [ORG Development Assistance and Increasing Civilian Contributions  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Quinn  ] said his key message is that [LOC Australia  ] is in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for the long haul . 
The [MISC Australians  ] have been talking to [MISC Afghans  ] living in tribal areas who are tired of fighting and are interested in reintegration -- and want to benefit from development assistance programs , continued [PER Quinn  ] . 
On the military side the [MISC Australians  ] had increased their troops contributions from 1100 to 1550 this year , but also plan to increase contributions of civilians and will increase the number of police advisors from three to twenty-five . 
[ORG AUSAID  ] is now in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and will undertake new initiatives . 
The [MISC Australian  ] military is moving away from reconstruction and focusing increasingly on training . 
Although the [MISC Australian  ] Special Ops task force will continue to work closely with the [ORG US Special  ] Ops forces , a large part of the [MISC Australian  ] focus will be moving toward new initiatives and deployment of civilians . 
Keeping Up Pressure on the [MISC Dutch  ] to Stay ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Australians  ] are complying with requests that they keep pressure on the [MISC Dutch  ] to keep a battle group in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , confided [PER Quinn  ] . 
He predicted that the [LOC Netherlands  ] will probably keep a PRT , but noted The [PER Hague  ] is under tremendous pressure to withdraw their troops - especially from one of the ruling coalition partners . 
New [MISC Australian  ] Ambassador to Arrive in Late December --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
