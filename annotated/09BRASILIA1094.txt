( C ) SUMMARY . 
At the same time that [ORG National Security Advisor Jones  ] highlighted the importance of [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] partnership ( reported septel ) , Under Secretary of State for [ORG International Security and Arms Control  ] [PER Ellen Tauscher  ] and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition , Technology and [ORG Logistics  ] [PER Ashton Carter  ] held extensive meetings August 4-6 with [MISC Brazilian  ] leadership , including the ministers of Defense and External Relations , the President 's [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor  ] , and the [ORG Air Force  ] commander , in support of the [LOC U.S.  ] bid to provide [LOC Brazil  ] , s next generation fighter aircraft . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] provided a letter from Secretary [PER Clinton  ] to her [MISC Brazilian  ] counterparts assuring them of [ORG State Department  ] support . 
As noted in ref a and other cables , [LOC Brazil  ] has long been concerned about [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to transfer technology . 
The visit of the two [ORG USG  ] officials responsible for technology release came at an opportune time as the [ORG GOB  ] prepares for a final decision . 
As a result , [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] Chief [PER Saito  ] announced that the decision would be delayed into mid-September , a key date as [MISC French  ] President [ORG Sarkozy  ] plans to visit [LOC Brazil  ] September 7 , when conventional wisdom expected a decision in favor of the [MISC French  ] aircraft as a deliverable . 
While the Under Secretaries , visit has increased momentum in favor of the [MISC Boeing Super  ] Hornet , there is still considerable political support for the [MISC French  ] , and a major lobbying effort associated with the [ORG Sarkozy  ] visit is expected . 
Getting the F18 across the finish line will require continued [ORG USG  ] efforts . 
Post recommends additional high level approaches to key [MISC Brazilian  ] decision makers -- including President [PER Lula  ] -- and preparing a public affairs strategy to counter possible misinformation as the decision approaches . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) According to [MISC Brazilian  ] contacts , the July 9 discussion between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Lula  ] on [LOC Brazil  ] , s fighter purchase energized the [LOC U.S.  ] bid . 
While [LOC Brazil  ] had previously been skeptical about [LOC U.S.  ] support for transfer of technology , the President , s assurance opened the door for the [ORG USG  ] to make its case . 
While [ORG NSA Jones  ] provided much of the big picture vision of a [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] partnership , Under Secretaries [PER Tauscher  ] and [PER Carter  ] took on the task of making the case for [ORG Boeing  ] , s bid . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] , s role was vital as it was the first time that [MISC Brazilian  ] officials who will be making the decision of which plane to buy heard from a senior [ORG State Department  ] official that the [ORG USG  ] had approved the necessary transfer of technology ( see ref b for discussion of [LOC Brazil  ] doubts about State ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In their meetings with [MISC Brazilian  ] leaders , [PER Tauscher  ] and [PER Carter  ] , s message was consistent: the [LOC U.S.  ] is interested in a partnership with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The fighter sale is only one aspect of this , although greater interoperability resulting from the use of [LOC U.S.  ] fighters will advance cooperation . 
[PER Tauscher  ] made the point that the [LOC United States  ] prizes its relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] , as evidenced by the unprecedented nature of some of the decisions in relation to the [ORG Super Hornet  ] , in particular the authorization to integrate [MISC Brazilian  ] manufactured weapons . 
As the official ultimately responsible for export controls , [PER Tauscher  ] said that future decisions regarding [LOC Brazil  ] would receive careful consideration in terms of how to help a friendly government . 
Regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to deny retransfer of [LOC USML  ] controlled parts of [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Super Tucano  ] aircraft to [LOC Venezuela  ] , she pointed out that the decision had been made by the previous administration to deny aircraft to [LOC Venezuela  ] , but without consideration of its effect on [LOC Brazil  ] . 
She stated that future decisions regarding [LOC Brazil  ] would take [LOC Brazil  ] , s interests more into account and would include consultations with the [ORG GOB  ] as appropriate . 
[PER Tauscher  ] noted that national security and economic security are inseparable and a deal between [ORG Boeing  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] would not only improve [LOC Brazil  ] , s security but would entail important economic benefits . 
The [ORG Super Hornet  ] , she said , is the best multi-role fighter in the world and meets or exceeds [LOC Brazil  ] , s requirements while providing a sound basis for the key [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] partnership. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) USD/ATL [PER Carter  ] highlighted the growing closeness of [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001094 002 OF 003 the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] defense industries . 
As industry becomes more interdependent , such partnerships bring added benefits to all sides . 
Noting that [LOC Brazil  ] , s defense strategy ( ref c ) linked defense modernization to national development , [PER Carter  ] said that partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] would help [LOC Brazil  ] achieve its strategic goals . 
[PER Carter  ] told the [MISC Brazilians  ] that he had chaired the committee making key tech release decisions . 
Because [LOC Brazil  ] was a friendly country , with a well-developed aviation sector and a good record of technology security , there was no reason not to approve transfers to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Boeing  ] was offering a large workshare in the project that would create an opportunity for [LOC Brazil  ] to participate in ongoing F18 development , sustaining jobs for [MISC Brazilian  ] industry over the life cycle of the aircraft . 
Finally , [PER Carter  ] noted that tech transfers to [LOC Brazil  ] would grow easier with time and experience. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] said that the information provided by the Tauscher/Carter team was important and merited careful review while repeating his view ( see ref a ) that tech transfer would be the key for a [MISC Brazilian  ] decision . 
[PER Jobim  ] told [PER Tauscher  ] privately that he believed [ORG Boeing  ] should have &first refusal8 on the sale and that he viewed the [LOC U.S.  ] as [LOC Brazil  ] , s &main partner.8 He also cautioned that the final decision would be made by President [PER Lula  ] and that he did not know what [PER Lula  ] , s position would be , a point he underlined in an August 7 conversation with Ambassador [PER Sobel.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Air Force  ] Chief [PER Saito  ] called the high-level assurances on tech transfer &music to my ears.8 His objective in the competition is to position the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] ( and [LOC Brazil  ] aviation industry ) for a &technological leap.8 [PER Saito  ] praised President [PER Obama  ] , s efforts with President [PER Lula  ] to provide assurance of [ORG USG  ] support . 
He also laid down a marker that [LOC Brazil  ] expected that a significant amount of the work of integrating [MISC Brazilian  ] weapons on the [MISC FX2  ] would be done in [LOC Brazil  ] , a requirement that will create practical difficulties for any manufacturer . 
EMBASSY COMMENT: [PER Saito  ] is a former fighter pilot , and it is increasingly clear that he will favor the most capable aircraft -- the [ORG Super Hornet  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) During the meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] hand-delivered a letter from the Secretary assuring that State had approved all necessary technology transfer in furtherance of the propoased sale . 
In response to [PER Amorim  ] , s concern about the &ban8 on [MISC Brazilian  ] re-sale of [ORG Super Tucanos  ] , she assured him that there was no ban , that the previous administration had made a &gaffe8 in not considering [LOC Brazil  ] , s interests when denying the sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] , and that in the future such decisions would be made on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward its significance to our growing bilateral partnership . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] also met with [ORG Embraer  ] President [PER Frederico Currado  ] and briefed him about the Secretary , s letter and the [ORG USG  ] commitment to meeting all [MISC Brazilian  ] tech transfer requirements . 
[PER Currado  ] was clear that he believed a partnership with [ORG Boeing  ] was in [ORG Embraer  ] , s interests and would carry significant long-term benefits for the company . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Senator [PER Heraclito Fortes  ] , a supporter of [ORG Boeing  ] , s bid and the second in the [ORG Senate  ] leadership , also believed that [ORG USG  ] assurances of tech transfers would be important but refused to speculate on [ORG Boeing  ] , s chances for the final decision , noting that there was little confidence in the [LOC United States  ] among President [PER Lula  ] , s advisors. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] , s visit received strongly positive coverage in the [MISC Brazilian  ] media . 
A feature story in Estado [LOC Sao Paulo  ] August 6 highlighted the importance of the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] partnership and the Secretary , s assurances on tech transfer . 
These points were picked up by a number of other news outlets , although the coverage was somewhat eclipsed by reporting on the supposed [LOC U.S.  ] bases in [LOC Columbia  ] . 
There remains strong interest from the media in seeing the text of the Secretary , s letter . 
At the same time , we are seeing the beginnings of a counter attack from [ORG Boeing  ] , s competitors in the press on two fronts: first that the [ORG Super Hornet  ] , although highly capable , would be too expensive , and second that , because the F18 is currently operational , its technology is &frozen , 8 not leaving [LOC Brazil  ] an opportunity to participate in technological development . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001094 003 OF 003 COMMENT: -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The combination of the President , s intervention with [PER Lula  ] , the Secretary , s letter and the visit of Under Secretaries [PER Tauscher  ] and [PER Carter  ] has created a strong momentum in favor of the [ORG Super Hornet  ] . 
As noted by [PER MOD Jobim  ] , however , the final decision will be political and will be made by President [PER Lula  ] , probably in September . 
With a [MISC Swedish  ] lobbying team subsequently visiting and the early September [ORG Sarkozy  ] visit on the horizon , further [ORG USG  ] efforts will be needed for a successful conclusion . 
Post recommends continued high-level approaches to [PER Saito  ] , [PER Jobim  ] and [PER Lula  ] to underline the Tauscher/Carter message on the importance of our partnership and the mutual benefits of a fighter sale . 
This message could be reinforced from the [LOC White House  ] as appropriate . 
We should also be prepared to see our commitment to tech transfer questioned . 
[ORG Folha de Sao Paulo  ] has already printed an op-ed ( probably inspired by the [ORG MRE  ] ) suggesting that despite the Secretary , s letter , the [ORG State Department  ] may block technology transfer . 
On August 12 , [ORG Valor Economico  ] quoted the text of the Secretary , s letter and its categorical support for the transfer . 
Despite this helpful development , the [ORG USG  ] will need to be able to respond to doubts as to the Secretary 's sincerity . 
Post will also continue to brief [MISC Brazilian  ] leaders as appropriate on the [ORG USG  ] approval of technology transfer . 
[ORG Boeing  ] leaders reinforced this message during their August 12-13 visit to [LOC Brasilia.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Under Secretaries [PER Tauscher  ] and [PER Carter  ] have cleared this message .
