END SUMMARY PRESS SPOTLIGHTS INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS AND COOPERATION --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) On Friday , June 17 , after eleven months of investigation , [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] arrested 17 members of a [MISC Lebanese-organized  ] drug ring operating in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and southern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Extensive press reports on the operation highlighted the transnational scope of the drug ring as well as international law enforcement cooperation with the [ORG DPF  ] investigating the group . 
The press reports indicated that authorities believe that the ring , which comprises five [MISC Lebanese  ] families , typically sends approximately 120 kilos of cocaine per month from [LOC Brazil  ] to [LOC Europe  ] and launders the proceeds by purchasing real estate and expensive luxury automobiles in [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
( Note: The reports differ on the quantity smuggled each month . 
End Note ) Authorities reportedly believe that the drugs enter [LOC Brazil  ] from [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] through the border city of [LOC Foz  ] do [LOC Iguacu  ] in the [LOC Brazil-Paraguay-Argentina  ] tri-border region and from [LOC Ponta Pora  ] on the border of the southwestern state of [ORG Mato Grosso  ] do Sul State and [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
Ring members reportedly transported the drugs to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , where they contracted [MISC Brazilian  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC Canadian  ] , [MISC Nigerian  ] and [MISC South African  ] couriers to smuggle the drugs to [LOC Frankfurt  ] , [LOC Lisbon  ] and locations in the [LOC Middle East  ] , passing through the airports of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [LOC Salvador  ] , and [LOC Recife  ] . 
Press reports indicate that the authorities first became aware of the drug-smuggling operation in June 2004 , when three [MISC Americans  ] were arrested on drug charges in [LOC Istanbul  ] , after disembarking from a flight from [LOC Sao Paulo.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Press reports indicate that the drug ring is believed to comprise several families of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent who , having fled [LOC Lebanon  ] during the 1980s , settled in [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
The press reports describe the confiscation of documents written in [MISC Arabic  ] and a large , framed picture of the leader of [ORG Hezbollah  ] , [PER Hassan Nasrallah  ] , in one of the apartments of the ring members . 
The press indicated that [MISC USD  ] 190,000 was found in the apartment of one of the ring members . 
4 . 
( U ) [ORG Folha  ] do [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , s largest circulation daily , reported that in addition to dismantling the drug ring , the [ORG DPF  ] , s objective is to identify members of [ORG Hezbollah  ] operating in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The same press article claims that [ORG Hezbollah  ] has 140 members in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
According to press statements , documents confiscated during Operation 8Tamara8 will be passed to international intelligence agencies for evaluation . 
POST PERSPECTIVE ON THE OPERATION --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG DEA  ] personnel working with [ORG DPF  ] agents note that a possible [ORG Hezbollah  ] connection was not a focus during the course of the investigation . 
It should be noted that the GOB has consistently denied that any [ORG Hezbollah  ] agents or agents of any other [MISC Middle Eastern  ] terrorist organization operate in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Operational aspects of the case are being reported through [ORG DEA  ] channels . 
Post [ORG DEA  ] reports that the amount seized in the raid was closer to [MISC USD  ] 300,000 , not [MISC USD  ] 190,000 , as reported in the press. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [ORG DEA  ] began investigating the ring in cooperation with [ORG DPF  ] after the three [MISC Americans  ] were arrested in [LOC Istanbul  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] and one in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] in 2004 . 
In addition , two other [MISC Americans  ] were arrested in [LOC Madrid  ] and [LOC Amsterdam  ] in early 2004 with links to this ring . 
Currently , [ORG DEA  ] authorities in [LOC Florida  ] are conducting investigations on these [MISC Americans  ] and the [MISC Lebanese-Brazilian  ] involved. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) COMMENT: [ORG DEA  ] notes that one of the outstanding questions from this operation is the final destination for the profits of this lucrative cocaine trade . 
Past experience has been that [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities lack effective tools to track the profits of illicit drug operations ; coordination between financial officials and counter-narcotics agents has not been good . 
While [ORG DEA  ] , [ORG DPF  ] and [ORG German Federal Police  ] were arresting members of the [MISC Brazilian  ] drug ring in 8Operation [PER Tamara  ] , 8 [MISC Ecuadorian  ] authorities reportedly arrested seven operatives in a drug smuggling/Hezbollah ring in [LOC Quito  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] in 8Operation [MISC Damascus.8  ] [ORG BBC On-Line  ] indicates that organizers of the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] ring were sending seventy percent of profits to [MISC Hezbollah.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG Regional Security Office  ] ( [ORG RSO  ] ) [LOC Sao Paulo  ] is coordinating with [ORG DEA  ] to determine whether any of the documents obtained in these , or other recent arrests include [LOC U.S.  ] passports or visas . 
[ORG RSO  ] is investigating any possible repercussions against post or personnel from these recent arrests , or from the press reports identifying [ORG DEA  ] , s participation in the investigation . 
Post is attempting to determine whether any of the arrested [MISC Lebanese-Brazilians  ] have connections to [ORG Hezbollah  ] , or any other middle-eastern terrorist network . 
So far we have not found any evidence of such a connection .
