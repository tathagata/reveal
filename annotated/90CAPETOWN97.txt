MANDELA MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT HE FULLY EXPECTS CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL PAGE 03 CAPE T 00097 01 OF 03 182017Z PRESIDENT FW DE KLERK TO MAKE SEVERAL MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS IN HIS FEBRUARY 2 SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT . 
DE KLERK WILL ANNOUNCE: -- [ORG THE UNBANNING  ] OF [ORG THE ANC  ] , [ORG PAC  ] AND OTHER POLITICAL - ORGANIZATIONS ; -- [ORG THE END  ] OF [ORG THE STATE  ] OF EMERGENCY ; -- [ORG THE RETURN  ] OF POLITICAL EXILES TO [LOC SOUTH AFRICA  ] ; -- [ORG THE RELEASE  ] OF A NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS , - INCLUDING [PER NELSON MANDELA.  ] - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ALL [ORG THE ITEMS  ] LISTED WILL TAKE EFFECT AS OF [ORG THE TIME  ] OF [ORG THE SPEECH  ] . 
BUT FIRM PLANS AND A COMMITMENT TO CARRY THEM OUT SWIFTLY WILL BE PART OF [ORG THE ANNOUNCEMENT.  ] ------------------------------- WHERE WILL MANDELA BE RELEASED ? ------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
MOOSA SIDESTEPPED A QUESTION ABOUT WHERE MANDELA'S HOME BASE WOULD BE UPON HIS RELEASE . 
HE ONLY REMARKED THAT MANDELA CAN TELL [ORG THE SAG  ] WHERE HE WANTS TO BE RELEASED AND WHERE HIS FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE WOULD THUS TAKE PLACE . 
SENTIMENTALLY , SAID MOOSA , [LOC PAARL  ] ( WHERE MANDELA IS NOW IN PRISON ) SEEMED TO APPEAL TO MANDELA . 
( COMMENT: BUT POLITICALLY AND PRACTICALLY THIS MAKES LITTLE SENSE . 
[LOC JOHANNESBURG  ] SEEMS BY FAR [ORG THE MOST SUITABLE VENUE  ] . 
END COMMENT .

WHEN HE MET SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WITH MANDELA , DE KLERK PROVIDED A SET OF PROPOSALS AND ASKED FOR [ORG THE ANC'S  ] RESPONSE . 
MANDELA HAS NOT DISCUSSED THOSE PROPOSALS IN ANY DETAIL WITH PEOPLE HERE ( AT LEAST HE DID NOT DO SO WITH [ORG THE LAWYERS' GROUP  ] OF WHICH MOOSA WAS A MEMBER ) BUT HE DID TRANSMIT THEM TO ALFRED NZO AND THABO MBEKI . 
MOOSA BELIEVES ( PIECING TOGETHER STRAY REMARKS WHERE AND THERE ) THAT THE PROPOSALS RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO THE NEED TO ALLAY WHITE FEARS . 
SPECIFICALLY , HE THINKS ONE ISSUE WAS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE [ORG ANC  ] TO [ORG THE SACP  ] ( [MISC SOUTH AFRICAN  ] COMMUNIST PARTY ) AND ANOTHER WAS THE DEFINITION OF ONE MAN ONE VOTE. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
ASIDE FROM BEING AN EFFORT TO SEIZE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND BY PUBLICLY DEMONSTRATING FLEXIBILITY , [ORG THE ANC'S  ] RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT IS PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE EVEN WHILE APARTHEID LAWS LIKE [ORG THE GROUP  ] AREAS ACT REMAIN IN PLACE MAY BE PART OF [ORG THE ORGANIZATION'S  ] REPLY TO DE KLERK. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
MOOSA UNDERSTANDS MANDELA TO HAVE WORKED OUT A GAME PLAN FOR " NEXT STEPS " IN A NEGOTIATION WITH DE KLERK SO AS TO ENSURE THAT HE IS NOT RELEASED FROM PRISON INTO A VACUUM. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
MANDELA HAS TOLD VARIOUS VISITORS THAT HE HAS A GOOD OPINION OF DE KLERK AS A SINCERE INDIVIDUAL EVEN THOUGH HE REGARDS HIM AS STILL THE LEADER OF [ORG THE NATIONAL PARTY  ] AND NOT MORE THAN THAT. --------------------------------------------- --------- COMMITMENT ON SAG AND MDM SIDE TO REDUCE CONFRONTATION --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
MOOSA AGREED THAT [ORG THE ATMOSPHERE  ] IS MUCH LESS TENSE THAN EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO . 
FOR EXAMPLE , LAST YEAR THE RETURN TO SCHOOL RESULTED IN [ORG THE USUAL  ] ACCUSATIONS AND PHYSICAL CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING ( DET ) , AIDED BY [ORG THE POLICE  ] , AND STUDENTS SUPPORTED BY PARENTS , TEACHERS AND THE MDM . 
THIS YEAR THERE IS AN EVEN WORSE CRISIS DUE TO LACK OF SPACE IN BLACK SCHOOLS AND THE FAILURE OF OVER 100,000 STUDENTS TO PASS THEIR " MATRIC EXAMS . 
" YET THERE IS A NEW SPIRIT OF DIALOGUE AT THE DET AND ACTIVISTS ARE THEREFORE ABLE TO CHANNEL STUDENT FRUSTRATIONS IN A CON- STRUCTIVE MANNER. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
[ORG THE SAG'S  ] NEW " TACTIC " OF ALLOWING DISSENT AND ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF STONEWALLING " IS WORKING FOR THEM , " MOOSA SAID . 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED , HOWEVER , THAT IT COULD ALSO , IF DEALT WITH POSITIVELY , WORK FOR THE MDM AND [ORG ANC  ] . 
THOUGH AN ABSENCE OF DIRECT CONFRONTATION IS " DEMOBILIZING FOR THE MASSES , " FEWER RAW NERVES AMONG ACTIVISTS COULD MAKE THEM MORE AMENABLE TO THE ANC'S INCREASINGLY PRAGMATIC STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THE SAG . 
THAT STRATEGY , MOOSA SAID , IS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY MANY ACTIVISTS , ESPECIALLY YOUTH , WHO FEAR A SELL-OUT OF THEIR CAUSE . 
THERE REMAINS A LOT TO DO TO EXPLAIN THE VIRTUES OF FLEXIBILITY TO THEM. -------------------------------- [ORG PAC  ] AND [LOC BC  ] -- A THORN IN THE SIDE -------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
MOOSA DESCRIBED THE CONFERENCE ON A DEMOCRATIC FUTURE AS " NOT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IN COOPERATION . 
" HE OPINED THAT THE [ORG PAC  ] AND [LOC BC  ] COULD TURN OUT TO BE A REAL PROBLEM . 
HE EXPECTS THEM TO REMAIN ALOOF , SNIPING AT THE ANC'S POSITIONS FROM THE SIDELINES AND STIRRING UP YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR. ---------------------- JESSE JACKSON VISIT ---------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
MOOSA INQUIRED ABOUT THE DATES FOR JESSE JACKSON'S VISIT AND EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT JACKSON HAD MET WITH THE PRESS AT [LOC SOUTH  ] AFRICAN AMBASSADOR KOORNHOF'S RESIDENCE . 
MOOSA FEARED THAT THE SAG WAS GOING TOO GOOD A JOB OF CULTIVATING JACKSON AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN TO THE US AND ANNOUNCE THAT SANCTIONS SHOULD BE LIFTED . 
MOOSA APPEARED TO HAVE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN KOORNHOF'S PERSUASIVE ABILITY THAN IN THAT OF THE SACC LEADERSHIP WHICH IS HOSTING THE JACKSON VISIT .
