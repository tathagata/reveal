No identifiable , consistant fraud patterns involving [LOC U.S.  ] passports or immigrant visas currently exist in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
This cable updates the country fraud summary for [LOC Iceland  ] per ref [PER A. COUNTRY  ] CONDITIONS: As a prosperous , democratic country with an extensive and generous social welfare sytem , [LOC Iceland  ] is not generally characterized by the political , economic , and social conditions which create widespread fraud . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has a large foreign-born population of approximately 8 percent . 
This group consists of both naturalized [MISC Icelandic  ] citizens and permanent residents . 
Integration into [MISC Icelandic  ] society by non-native populations can vary widely depending on individual circumstances and factors such as language , culture , employment and housing . 
[LOC Iceland  ] participates in the [MISC Visa Waiver Program  ] . 
Most [MISC Icelandic  ] passports and national IDs are machine-readable and [LOC Iceland  ] will start producing biometric passports in 2006 . 
Obtaining fraudulent birth certificates or other registry items is difficult since all records are computerized , centrally stored , and easy to verify . 
At the same time , [LOC Iceland  ] has a large number of asylum seekers who have not been able to document their identity . 
Most of them are able to obtain restricted [MISC Icelandic  ] alien passports . 
In some cases , these insufficently identified persons can even obtain [MISC Icelandic  ] citizenship and passports , allowing them to travel on the [MISC Visa Waiver Program  ] . 
The overall adjusted refusal rate was 6.3 percent , down slightly from last year . 
A part-time FSN NIV specialist manages fraud prevention efforts at post . 
During FY2005 post focused its anti-fraud efforts on information sharing , training and management. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
NIV FRAUD: Although petty NIV fraud is minimal , post pays careful attention to applicants seeking visas for extended visits ( often in connection with unauthorized employment ) , young [MISC Icelandic  ] applicants applying for a B1/B2 ( with the intention of working as baby sitters ) , " new Icelanders " ( who only recently obtained [MISC Icelandic  ] citizenship ) , third-country nationals resident in [LOC Iceland  ] , and non-resident NIV applicants . 
During FY2005 , post received NIV applications from citizens from 44 countries . 
The most significant third country national groups are citizens of [LOC Poland  ] ( 15 applications ) , [LOC Norway  ] ( 12 applications ) , [LOC Lithuania  ] ( 9 applications ) , [LOC Romania  ] ( 6 applications ) , [LOC Denmark  ] ( 6 applications ) and [LOC Great Britain  ] ( 6 applications ) . 
Post receives approximately 2 turnaround reports each month , mainly for previous overstays on the [MISC Visa Waiver Program  ] or evidence of intended illegal employment . 
Post had two NIV applicants that were suspected to have fraudulent passports . 
After taking these passports to the [ORG Icelandic Immigration Authorities  ] and using their equipment to examine these passports post was assured that these passports where genuine , just in bad condition . 
One of the applicants obtained a new passport and qualified for a [MISC Visa  ] . 
The other applicant was refused under 214b. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[ORG IV FRAUD:  ] The [ORG IV  ] units 's main fraud concern is family based IV applications from third-country nationals with foreign birth , marriage and police certificates . 
During this period there was one suspected case . 
In that case there was a concern if a marriage between an [MISC American  ] citizen husband and an [MISC Icelandic  ] citizen wife was solely for Immigrant [MISC Visa  ] purposes . 
The wife had an overstay in the [LOC U.S.  ] and there was a concern if the marriage was genuine . 
A DHS officer from [LOC London  ] came to [LOC Iceland  ] to interview the couple and approved the petition . 
The case will be finished here in [LOC Iceland.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[ORG DV FRAUD: Post  ] did not uncover any cases involving [ORG DV  ] fraud during FY2005 . 
The majority of [ORG DV  ] applicants in [LOC Iceland  ] are [MISC Icelandic  ] citizens . 
That makes it easier for the post to examine documents. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
ACS FRAUD: [LOC U.S.  ] passport fraud is minimal at post . 
During this period there was one suspected case . 
The case involved an [MISC American  ] soldier stationed in [LOC Bahrain  ] whose [MISC Ethiopian  ] wife obtained fraudulent documents for employment in [LOC Bahrain  ] . 
Their child was born in [LOC Bahrain  ] with the mother 's fraudulent name on the birth certificate . 
The case is still open . 
False claims to [LOC U.S.  ] citizenship and photo- substituted identification documents are the main fraud concerns in the ACS unit . 
Lost or stolen passport cases occur frequently as many tourists come to [LOC Iceland  ] and lose their passports. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
[ORG ADOPTION FRAUD: Post  ] does not handle any adoption documents. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
ASYLUM AND OTHER DHS BENEFITS FRAUD: Post did not uncover any cases involving asylum fraud during [LOC FY2005.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
[ORG COOPERATION WITH HOST GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES: Cooperation  ] between post and the [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities issuing passports and investigating fraud is very good . 
The [ORG Border Police  ] have excellent equipment to investigate fraudulent documents and have willingly assisted post whenever post has requested it. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
AREAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN: [LOC Iceland  ] is a transit point for alien traffickers and refugees from [LOC China  ] , [LOC Africa  ] and [ORG Eastern Europe  ] . 
It is relatively easy to obtain [MISC Icelandic  ] refugee travel documents or alien passports even when the identity of the applicant is not clearly established . 
Some refugees become naturalized [MISC Icelandic  ] citizens within three to seven years , and thus are eligible for travel on the [MISC Visa Waiver  ] program . 
Post has also seen an increased number of media reports about alien smugglers trafficking [MISC Chinese  ] women through [LOC Iceland  ] to other countries in [LOC Western Europe  ] and potentially to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
STAFFING AND TRAINING: We do not have a [ORG Fraud Prevention Unit  ] at post . 
All consular [MISC LES  ] staff are cross- trained in basic fraud prevention tools and tactics . 
One of the [MISC LES  ] staff received the [ORG Fraud Prevention  ] training at [LOC FSI  ] and held an information session at post sharing what she had learnt at [LOC FSI  ] for the [ORG Consular Section  ] and the [ORG Regional Security Office  ] . 
The [ORG Consular Section  ] used the [ORG Consular Leadership Day  ] in January 2005 to strengthen the relationship between the section and the [ORG Icelandic Border Police  ] at the airport . 
They showed post their equipment and how they make use of it . 
They also informed post of the kinds of cases with which they had been dealing and how they had been able to detect these cases . 
Post recommends additional fraud prevention training for the [ORG Consular Officer  ] .
