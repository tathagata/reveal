END SUMMARY . 
The [ORG Petroleum Industry  ] ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador met with [ORG Chevron  ] and visited a manufacturing facility owned by leading [LOC U.S.  ] oil field services company [ORG Baker Hughes  ] . 
Their comments on a number of issues affecting the oil industry follow. <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
( C ) PROFITS AND FINANCE: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER ChevronXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the company’s two [LOC Maracaibo  ] joint ventures ( JV ) [ORG Petroboscan  ] and [PER Petroindependiente  ] ) with [ORG PDVSA  ] are profitable ) especially since [ORG Chevron  ] is not investing new funds . 
He confided that although the JVs owe over $100 million to various service companies , [ORG Chevron  ] is withdrawing profits through a deal to take crude oil shipments from [ORG Petroboscan  ] to its [LOC Pascagoula  ] refinery in [LOC Alabama  ] . 
In contrast to [MISC Chevron’s  ] perspective , [ORG Baker HughesXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided to the Ambassador that [ORG PDVSA  ] continues to owe the company $100 million , even though it paid $70 million in early September ( Ref B ) . 
Of $12 million in foreign exchange requests pending with [LOC CADIVI  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , s foreign currency control board , [ORG BHI  ] has received approvals for only $700,000. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
( C ) OPERATIONS: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that BHI’s strategy continues to be to minimize its exposure ; it is not investing in [LOC Venezuela  ] ( Ref A ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had , in fact , received a congratulatory message from [ORG BHI  ] corporate headquarters for not growing the business ( and increasing its risk exposure ) . 
He explained how [ORG BHI  ] has been able to maintain [LOC Maracaibo  ] as a regional production center , in spite of the challenges created by the Government of the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] , s ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) economic policies and regulatory environment . 
As an example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG BHI  ] buys all of its steel from its [LOC Houston  ] headquarters , but is not charged for it , effectively providing local operations with a subsidy to support operations . 
In [LOC Chevron  ] , s case , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [ORG PDVSA  ] is pressuring the company to reduce the number of [ORG Chevron  ] secondees assigned to the [ORG Petroboscan  ] and [ORG PetroIndependiente  ] JVs as each one of them costs five times the amount of a locally hired [MISC Venezuelan  ] . 
He added that [ORG Petroboscan  ] used to have five maintenance drill rigs operating , but today has only two ) effectively limiting its ability to maintain crude production levels . 
Additionally , [ORG Petroboscan  ] only has one rig drilling new wells. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
( C ) OIL FIELD SERVICES: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the situation in regards to oil services in western [LOC Venezuela  ] has changed significantly . 
Equipment conditions have deteriorated drastically since the May expropriations of nearly 80 service companies . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recounted that two weeks before he had taken a barge out to supervise the repair of a couple of offshore wells ; he was surprised at the terrible state of safety and maintenance issues on the now PDVSA-operated vessel . 
In addition , some well maintenance services are no longer available . 
He attributed this to an internal [ORG PDVSA CARACAS  ] 00001333 002.2 OF 003 dynamic ( i.e. , [ORG PDVSA Exploration  ] and Production has contractually locked up any available service providers before [ORG PDVSA  ] CVP ) the entity that manages the joint ventures ) is able to secure services ) . 
[ORG Baker Hughes  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared that doing business in [LOC Venezuela  ] is increasingly difficult , noting that where there used to be seven steps required to export a container from [LOC Venezuela  ] , there are now over thirty steps imposed by [ORG GBRV  ] agencies . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that [ORG BHI  ] has removed higher-technology assets from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
As an example , [ORG BHI  ] has exported seven high-technology pumps ( leaving three in country ) , each valued at $500,000 , from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[ORG BHI  ] also exported a coiled tubing unit from [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
( C ) PRODUCTION: Reflecting on the January 2009 GBRV-ordered [ORG OPEC  ] quota production cuts at [ORG Petroboscan  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared that the JV has lost upwards of 15,000 b/d of production since being ordered by [ORG PDVSA  ] to re-activate the field to pre-cut production levels of 115,000 b/d . 
He stated that [MISC Chevron’s  ] internal estimate for [MISC Venezuelan  ] crude production is between 2.1 and 2.3 million b/d , with approximately 1.3 million b/d going to the [LOC U.S.  ] , 800,000 b/d consumed in [LOC Venezuela  ] , and 300-400,000 b/d ( of crude petroleum and refined product ) exported to [LOC Cuba  ] and [ORG Petrocaribe  ] members . 
Responding to a question from the Ambassador about whether [ORG PDVSA  ] is aware of the negative impact on production that expropriations and mismanagement missteps are bound to have , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered that crude oil production is no longer the standard by which [ORG PDVSA  ] judges performance ( Ref C ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A tour of “Fire [ORG School de Venezuela  ] , ” a private academic institution ( affiliated with the [ORG Texas A&M University System  ] ) that provides both municipal firefighters and oil company and oil service company personnel with firefighting and other emergency service training , provided the Ambassador with additional insight on [ORG PDVSA  ] operations . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that [ORG PDVSA  ] sends employees to the school for certification courses . 
However , both [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The [ORG Business Sector  ] ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Members of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that the private sector’s inability to repatriate dividends and increasing security concerns impede efforts to attract foreign direct investment . 
The board members added that it is difficult to maintain current investment as the rules of the game are constantly changing . 
They asked the Ambassador for help in developing programs based on best practices from [LOC U.S.  ] cities that have overcome similar problems ( such as crime ) , and specifically programs that involve local government partnership with the private sector and civil society . 
The Ambassador offered that there are many examples in [LOC U.S.  ] cities , such as [LOC Boston  ] , [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] , [LOC New York  ] , and [LOC Atlanta  ] and that the [MISC Embassy  ] would pursue with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador also attended a dinner hosted by the [ORG Zulia  ] chapter of the [ORG Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce  ] . 
The [ORG Chamber participants  ] echoed well-known concerns regarding the difficulties with the [LOC CADIVI  ] foreign exchange controls and voiced caution regarding the use of the parallel permuta rate because they do not want to be seen as possibly operating on the margins of [MISC Venezuelan  ] law . 
A [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] manufacturer mentioned that he is no longer able to import material from [LOC Europe  ] using [LOC CADIVI  ] . 
He fears his production [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001333 003.2 OF 003 costs will significantly erode his company’s competitiveness if he imports the fabric using the permuta exchange market . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed to know people who had been victims of extortion or kidnapping plots by [MISC Colombian  ] guerrillas . 
8 . 
( C ) COMMENT: This was the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] first trip to [ORG Zulia  ] since returning to [LOC Venezuela  ] after being declared persona non grata in September 2008 . 
The one-year gap in visits provided a dramatic snapshot of the deteriorating economic situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The two perspectives on doing business in [LOC Venezuela  ] presented by [ORG Chevron  ] and [ORG BHI  ] underline the private sector’s difficult situation -- faced with increased risk , companies are not investing in operations but are seeking ways to maintain a market presence given the tremendous opportunities that may yet exist in [LOC Venezuela  ] , s oil sector . 
END COMMENT .
