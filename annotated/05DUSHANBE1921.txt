<code><pre>S E C R E T DUSHANBE 001921 SIPDIS STATE FOR P , [PER EUR/CACEN  ] , [PER EUR/RUS  ] , SA , S/P [ORG NSC  ] FOR MERKEL EO 12958 DECL: 12/2/2015 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PINR , MARR , RS , [ORG TI SUBJECT: MEETING  ] WITH PRESIDENT RAHMONOV: HIS VIEWS ON [LOC RUSSIA  ] REF: STATE 214783 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Richard E. Hoagland  ] , Ambassador , [ORG EXEC  ] , Embassy Dushanbe . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The Ambassador met with President [PER Emomali Rahmonov  ] on December 1 for two and a half hours . 
We report the meeting in three cables . 
This is two of three . 
The other two cover Rahmonov’s views on ( 1 ) the [MISC U.S.-Tajikistan  ] bilateral relationship and [MISC Tajik  ] politics , and ( 2 ) [LOC Uzbekistan.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: President [PER Rahmonov  ] judges that new [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Ramazan Abdulatipov  ] is “not very diplomatic , but not a bad guy.” Though [PER Rahmonov  ] has to work closely with [LOC Russia  ] he made clear he keeps both eyes wide open . 
He alleged that he kicked the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Border Guards  ] out of [LOC Tajikistan  ] because they were plotting with former [ORG Presidential Guards  ] Commander Gaffor [PER Mirzoyev  ] to overthrow him . 
Although some of what [PER Rahmonov  ] said may have been calculated for [LOC U.S.  ] consumption , much of it has a ring of truth.” END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Rahmonov  ] expressed gratitude for the [ORG State Department’s  ] non-paper about [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] consultations ( reftel ) , and said that [LOC Tajikistan  ] will do everything possible to promote good relations in the region between [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
He said [LOC Russia  ] has natural historic , cultural , and security interests in the region and will always be a major force that cannot be ignored , but it is important for the international community to moderate [PER Russia’s  ] worst instincts and help it become a positive force . 
It is especially important for [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC United states  ] to develop common positions in the region , including in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , to promote sustainable stability and prosperity . 
[MISC RUSSIAN  ] AMBASSADOR “NOT A BAD GUY , ” JUST NOT VERY DIPLOMATIC <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Rahmonov  ] , abandoning his notes as he usually does , paused and smiled. “You know , ( [MISC Russian  ] political-appointee Ambassador ) [PER Ramazan  ] ( [PER Abdulatipov  ] ) is not really a bad guy , even though he complains to me about you all the time . 
He’s a politician , philosopher , and intellectual . 
Because he’s from [LOC Dagestan  ] , we have very interesting discussions about the history of [MISC Russia’s  ] Muslims and [MISC Persian  ] culture . 
But he’s just not a diplomat . 
He doesn’t understand nuances and niceties . 
He’s certainly no [PER Peshkov  ] ! ( [ORG NOTE: Previous  ] [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Maksim Peshkov  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) But he’s open and friendly with me personally . 
He understands [LOC Russia  ] creates a lot of problems here , and knows it’s his job to try to solve them.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rahmonov  ] added , “Actually , It’s the [MISC Russian  ] special services who cause trouble here , and [PER I’ve  ] told [PER Ramazan  ] it’s his job to keep them under control . 
And it’s not just here , it’s coming from the [LOC Kremlin  ] , and some of it comes from the top . 
We can never forget that [PER Putin  ] himself is a ‘chekist’ ( career intelligence officer ) at heart.” WHY [PER RAHMONOV  ] KICKED OUT THE [MISC RUSSIAN  ] [ORG BORDER GUARDS  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rahmonov  ] said , “I want to tell you a secret why I insisted that the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Border Guards  ] had to leave [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
You know they’re part of the [ORG KGB  ] . 
I had credible information they and ( jailed General Gaffor ) [PER Mirzoyev  ] were plotting a coup against me . 
That’s why I pushed [PER Mirzoyev  ] out of the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] , disbanded the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] , and told [PER Putin  ] forcefully his [ORG Border Guards  ] had to go . 
This had been building for a long time , and I had frequently discussed it with [PER Putin  ] , but he wouldn’t do anything about it . 
Only after I moved against [PER Mirzoyev  ] did [PER Putin  ] finally understand that their game was up . 
To make amends , he agreed that his [ORG Border Guards  ] would leave . 
You know who helped me with this ? ( [ORG Federal Service on Control of Narcotics  ] Chairman [PER Victor  ] ) [PER Cherkesov  ] . 
He was here at that time studying our [ORG Drug Control Agency  ] , and he realized that the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Border Guards  ] were more involved in trafficking heroin than in stopping it . 
He went to [PER Putin  ] on my behalf.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Having warmed to this issue , [PER Rahmonov  ] said , “This constant propaganda in the [MISC Russian  ] media about how [LOC Tajikistan  ] is failing to control its borders now that the [MISC Russians  ] have left - you know where that comes from ? 
From the [MISC Russian  ] generals who want to come back here with their mafia buddies . 
Look what they got here - they put in two-year tours , and then went back to [LOC Moscow  ] and bought [MISC Mercedes  ] 600s and elite apartments . 
You think they did that on their salaries ? 
Why do you think the generals lined up in [LOC Moscow  ] all the way across [ORG Red Square  ] and paid enormous bribes to be assigned here - just so they could do their patriotic duty ? ” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) “And another thing , ” [PER Rahmonov  ] continued heatedly , “why do you think I got rid of the 50 [MISC Russian  ] generals who used to be advisers in our [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] . 
They never did anything for us . 
They never helped us build a professional military , never gave us any military-technical assistance , because they wanted to keep us weak so their buddies could play games and make fortunes dealing drugs . 
I got fed up , said thanks but now it’s time for you to go home . 
That’s one reason they eventually came up with the plot to overthrow me.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT: [PER Rahmonov  ] seldom misses a chance in extended conversations with the Ambassador to assert Tajikistan’s independence from [LOC Russia  ] and occasional unhappiness with their friendship-of-convenience . 
His revelation of why he asked the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Border Guards  ] to leave [LOC Tajikistan  ] is an amplified version of what he told us last year . 
Although it may be highly edited and spun for our consumption , we note a coincidence of timing . 
The [PER Mirzoyev  ] drama played out at the end of January 2004 . 
By the end of February 2004 , [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Peshkov  ] confided to us that the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Border Guards  ] would leave [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
END COMMENT .
