END SUMMARY . 
[PER SALEH: HELICOPTERS  ] , [PER HELICOPTERS  ] , [PER HELICOPTERS  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG CENTCOM  ] Commander General [PER David Petraeus  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , [ORG CENTCOM  ] aides , the Embassy DATT , and EconOff note taker , congratulated President [PER Saleh  ] on successful operations against [ORG AQAP  ] during a January 2 meeting . 
The General told [PER Saleh  ] that he had requested [MISC USD  ] 150 million in security assistance for 2010 , a substantial increase over the 2009 amount of [MISC USD  ] 67 million . 
Also present were Minister of [ORG Defense MG Muhammed Nasser Ahmad Ali  ] and Deputy Prime Minister for [ORG Defense and Security Affairs  ] [PER Rashad  ] al-Alimi . 
Raising a topic that he would manage to insert into almost every item of discussion during the hour and half-long meeting , [PER Saleh  ] requested that the [LOC U.S.  ] provide the [ORG ROYG  ] with 12 armed helicopters . 
Possessing such helicopters would allow the [ORG ROYG  ] to take the lead in future [LOC CT  ] operations , " ease " the use of fighter jets and cruise missiles against terrorist targets , and allow [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Special Operations Forces  ] to capture terrorist suspects and identify victims following strikes , according to [PER Saleh  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] could convince [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the UAE to supply six helicopters each if the [MISC American  ] " bureaucracy " prevented quick approval , [PER Saleh  ] suggested . 
The General responded that he had already considered the [ORG ROYG  ] 's request for helicopters and was in discussions with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] on the matter . 
" We won't use the helicopters in [LOC Sa'ada  ] , I promise . 
Only against al-Qaeda , " [PER Saleh  ] told General [PER Petraeus.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saleh  ] agreed to General Patraeus' proposal to dedicate [MISC USD  ] 45 million of 2010 security assistance funds to help establish and train a [ORG YSOF  ] aviation regiment , allowing [ORG YSOF  ] to focus on al-Qaeda targets and leaving [LOC Sa'ada  ] air operations to the [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Air Force  ] . 
Without giving much detail , [PER Saleh  ] also requested that the [LOC U.S.  ] equip and train three new [MISC Republican  ] Guard brigades , totaling 9,000 soldiers . 
" Equipping these brigades would reflect upon our true partnership , " [PER Saleh  ] said . 
The General urged [PER Saleh  ] to focus first on the [ORG YSOF  ] aviation regiment . 
[ORG AQAP  ] STRIKES: CONCERN FOR CIVILIAN CASUALTIES --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saleh  ] praised the December 17 and 24 strikes against [ORG AQAP  ] but said that " mistakes were made " in the killing of civilians in [LOC Abyan  ] . 
The General responded that the only civilians killed were the wife and two children of an [ORG AQAP  ] operative at the site , prompting [PER Saleh  ] to plunge into a lengthy and confusing aside with Deputy Prime Minister [PER Alimi  ] and Minister of [ORG Defense Ali  ] regarding the number of terrorists versus civilians killed in the strike . 
( [PER Comment: Saleh  ] 's conversation on the civilian casualties suggests he has not been well briefed by his advisors on the strike in [LOC Abyan  ] , a site that the [ORG ROYG  ] has been unable to access to determine with any certainty the level of collateral damage . 
End Comment . 
) [ORG AQAP  ] leader [ORG Nassr  ] al-Wahishi and extremist cleric [PER Anwar al-Awlaki  ] may still be alive , [PER Saleh  ] said , but the December strikes had already caused al-Qaeda operatives to turn themselves in to authorities and residents in affected areas to deny refuge to al-Qaeda . 
[PER Saleh  ] raised the issue of the [ORG Saudi Government  ] and [ORG Jawf  ] governorate tribal sheikh Amin al-Okimi , a subject that is being reported through other channels . 
SHIFTING AIRSTRIKE STRATEGIES ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Obama  ] has approved providing [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence in support of [ORG ROYG  ] ground operations against [ORG AQAP  ] targets , General [PER Petraeus  ] informed [PER Saleh  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] reacted coolly , however , to the General 's proposal to place USG personnel inside the area of operations armed with real-time , direct feed intelligence from [LOC U.S.  ] ISR platforms overhead . 
" You cannot enter the operations area and you must stay in the joint operations center , " [PER Saleh  ] responded . 
Any [LOC U.S.  ] casualties in strikes against [ORG AQAP  ] would harm future efforts , [PER Saleh  ] asserted . 
[PER Saleh  ] did not have any objection , however , to General Petraeus' proposal to move away from the use of cruise missiles and instead have [LOC U.S.  ] fixed-wing bombers circle outside [MISC Yemeni  ] territory , " out of sight , " and engage [ORG AQAP  ] targets when actionable intelligence became available . 
[PER Saleh  ] lamented the use of cruise missiles that are " not very accurate " and welcomed the use of aircraft-deployed precision-guided bombs instead . 
" We'll continue saying the bombs are ours , not yours , " [PER Saleh  ] said , prompting Deputy Prime Minister [PER Alimi  ] to joke that he had just " lied " by telling Parliament that the bombs in [LOC Arhab  ] , [LOC Abyan  ] , and [LOC Shebwa  ] were [MISC American-made  ] but deployed by the [ORG ROYG  ] . 
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN MIL-MIL RELATIONS ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) General [PER Petraeus  ] praised cooperation between the Embassy and the [ORG NSB  ] , [ORG YSOF  ] , [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG YCG  ] ) , and [ORG Counterterrorism Unit  ] ( [ORG CTU  ] ) , but singled out relations with the [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Air Force  ] as problematic . 
Only four out of 50 planned [ORG U.S. Special Operations Forces Command  ] training missions with the [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Air Force  ] had actually been executed in the past year , he said . 
[PER Saleh  ] said he would personally instruct Minister of Defense to improve the situation . 
The General also urged [PER Saleh  ] to stop [MISC Yemeni  ] Customs' habit of holding up Embassy cargo at the airport , including shipments destined for the [ORG ROYG  ] itself , such as equipment for the [ORG CTU  ] . 
[PER Saleh  ] laughed and made a vague pledge to have the customs issue " taken care of . 
" [PER Saleh  ] complained that the [ORG ROYG  ] had not yet received the necessary training to operate 17 [ORG Iraqi Light Armored Vehicle  ] ( [ORG ILAVs  ] ) provided by the USG in 2008 , saying that [ORG YSOF  ] needed the training in order to use the [ORG ILAVs  ] for [LOC CT  ] operations . 
The General said he would look into having [ORG U.S. Special Operations Forces  ] personnel conduct the training. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Pointing to the [ORG ROYG  ] 's problems in combating rampant drug and arms smuggling , [PER Saleh  ] told General [PER Petraeus  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] maritime security assistance was insufficient to cover [LOC Yemen  ] 's nearly 2,000 km of coastline . 
" Why not have [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Holland  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , [MISC Saudi  ] , and the UAE each provide two patrol boats ? 
" [PER Saleh  ] suggested . 
The General told [PER Saleh  ] that two fully-equipped 87-foot patrol boats destined for the [MISC Yemeni  ] [ORG Coast Guard  ] were under construction and would arrive in [LOC Yemen  ] within a year . 
[PER Saleh  ] singled out smuggling from [LOC Djibouti  ] as particularly troublesome , claiming that the [ORG ROYG  ] had recently intercepted four containers of [MISC Djibouti-origin  ] TNT . 
" Tell ( [MISC Djiboutian  ] President ) [PER Ismail Guelleh  ] that I don't care if he smuggles whiskey into [LOC Yemen  ] -- provided it 's good whiskey ) but not drugs or weapons , " [PER Saleh  ] joked . 
[PER Saleh  ] said that smugglers of all stripes are bribing both [MISC Saudi  ] and [MISC Yemeni  ] border officials . 
[PER SALEH  ] WELCOMES [LOC LONDON  ] CONFERENCE -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saleh  ] told the General that he welcomed PM [PER Gordon Brown  ] 's announcement of the [LOC London  ] conference and said that the cooperation on [LOC Yemen  ] between the [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and the UAE would be benefitial . 
[LOC Qatar  ] should not be involved , however , because " they work with [LOC Iran  ] . 
" In this regard , [PER Saleh  ] also identified [LOC Qatar  ] as one of those nations working " against [LOC Yemen  ] , " along with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , and [LOC Eritrea.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) General [PER Petraeus  ] did not have an opportunity to clear on this cable .
