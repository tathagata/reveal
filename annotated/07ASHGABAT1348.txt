ASHGABAT 1047 Classified By: XXXXXXXXXXXXX for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG SUMMARY: Corruption  ] and nepotism remain problems in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] , and [MISC Turkish  ] firms and [ORG Bouygues  ] have done particularly well in the lucrative construction industry because they have mastered the business environment here . 
[ORG Bouygues  ] CEO [PER Martin Bouygues'  ] close and direct relationship to the president of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] is an open secret . 
A well-connected member of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] 's international diplomatic community alleged that the price for introductions to the president have risen from ten to 15 percent since [PER Niyazov  ] 's death . 
He also alleged that construction contract prices are so high because construction companies must add 20 or 30 percent to their bids just to cover bribes -- and that President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] is engaging in more construction contracts in order to amass more personal wealth , of which [ORG Avaza  ] ( Ref . 
A ) is a part . 
With all agreeing that corruption is as much a part of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] 's business environment as ever , the need to compete with firms not bond by [LOC U.S.  ] anti-corruption laws adds a new layer of complexity and uncertainty for [LOC U.S.  ] firms wishing to do business here . 
END SUMMARY . 
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY: MOST VISIBLY CORRUPT INDUSTRY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At a dinner on December 4 , a group of ambassadors lamented that the Government of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] awards construction contracts only to [MISC Turkish  ] firms , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] alluded to the " special " arrangement that [MISC French  ] construction firm [ORG Bouygues  ] holds with [LOC Turkmenistan  ] 's government . 
When questioned directly about the veracity of the rumor that [ORG Siemens  ] is encouraging the government of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] on the idea of installing one main satellite dish per building , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] acknowledged [ORG Siemens'  ] corrupt business practices . 
On December 5 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] gave a wide-ranging account of his views of corruption in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
The source said that " [ORG Bouygues  ] has not done $1.2 billion in work over the past years only on the basis of the quality of their work , " and added that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's comment about [ORG Bouygues  ] probably was in reference to the direct , personal relationship that CEO [PER Martin Bouygues  ] has had with the former and current heads of state of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
PRICE HIKE FOR PRESIDENTIAL INTRODUCTIONS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recently estimated that , based on current rumors , bribes to senior officials for meetings with the president have risen from ten percent under former President [PER Niyazov  ] to 15 percent under President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized , however , that bribing is a private affair , which only very few people in any given firm aware of it . 
Whatever happens between [ORG Bouygues  ] and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] 's president -- former or current -- in all likelihood stays between them . 
BRIBES AREN'T FREE -- SOMEONE PAYS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also gave one explanation for what seem to be very high construction project costs in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
Alleging that the Government of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] owes everyone money , [MISC Turkish  ] construction firms and [ORG Bouygues  ] begin work only after receiving a down payment . 
( NOTE: According to the source , [PER John Deere  ] distributor [ORG IPC  ] just started taking unconfirmed letters of credit . 
END NOTE . 
) Because it is very likely that the Government of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] won't pay the last ten percent , ASHGABAT 00001348 002 OF 003 companies routinely add an additional ten percent to the final negotiated price . 
Because corruption runs all the way down to subcontractors , construction companies usually tack on another 20 or 30 percent to the project price to make up for the bribes that the various parties have to pay along the way . 
TEXTILE MINISTRY DETERMINED [MISC TURKISH  ] MANAGERS OVERCHARGED <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The source said that the [ORG Ministry of Textiles  ] became suspicious and began checking on the actual prices of spare parts bought by [MISC Turkish  ] co-managers at joint-venture factories . 
[ORG Ministry  ] officials verified that the [MISC Turkish  ] partners grossly overcharged the [ORG Ministry for parts  ] -- but as the source explained , the managers " have " to add on surcharges/bribes anywhere they can , including spare parts , because they have to pay off [ORG Ministry  ] officials to stay in partnership at the factory . 
( COMMENT: This story about the [ORG Ministry of Textiles  ] seems to be consistent with the rumor that [PER Ahmet Chalik  ] may have played a significant role in the imprisonment of Minister of [ORG Textiles Jemal Goklenova  ] under President [PER Niyazov  ] because she favored eliminating [MISC Turkish  ] managers from the textile factories in order to let [MISC Turkmen  ] manage the factories themselves ( Ref . 
B ) . 
END COMMENT . 
) MORE RUMORS ON THE BIG [MISC TURKISH  ] CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Formerly prominent [MISC Turkish  ] construction firms such as Nursel , headed by [PER Ibrahim Kollek  ] , are out of favor . 
Rumors of a falling out between [PER Kollek  ] and the Government of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] abound in [LOC Ashgabat  ] , as well as a rumor that [PER Kollek  ] filed a lawsuit against the government of [LOC Turkmenistan  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
PRESIDENTIAL CORRUPTION... <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) According to the source , there is an understanding that higher-up officials should dole out a portion of these bribes to their minions , and former President [PER Niyazov  ] reportedly cracked down on those taking bribes who didn't share the wealth with others down the food chain . 
From all appearances , President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] is engaging in the same behavior , as [LOC Turkmenistan  ] watchers and experts such as this source have the impression that [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] 's desire to accumulate wealth is the motivating factor behind the many large contracts the government engages in . 
Also , rumors persist that provincial governors have to pay a bribe of $100,000 for their jobs. ...PERHAPS AN EXPLANATION FOR THE MYSTERY THAT IS [ORG AVAZA  ] ? <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The source mentioned the [ORG Avaza Tourism Zone  ] ( Ref . 
A ) as an example of corruption -- and lack of any understanding of infrastructure development -- in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
Depending on the moment , the project plays the role of a free economic zone , a touristic zone , or a port development project . 
As the source pointed out , in a properly organized port development project , studies on traffic and passenger flows and architects' studies should precede work , and planners would allocate approximately ten percent of the entire budget to pay these technical experts before work began . 
As far as anyone can tell , none of these studies have been done or planned for in the [ORG Avaza  ] budget , but planners expect to spend $2.8 billion to upgrade the completely dilapidated jetties and wharfs at the port alone -- including $212 million for a seven-kilometer canal alone . 
THE " RIGHT SORT " OF COMPANY <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The source said that a company offered one of his contacts a 2.5% commission for introducing the " right sort " ASHGABAT 00001348 003 OF 003 of [MISC European  ] contractor -- i.e. , a contractor with a sterling reputation -- with the ability to disguise bribes from auditors . 
The source refused to give any sort of identifying information about his contact , but said that " people who studied in [LOC Moscow  ] have the right contacts , " adding that " not everyone has access " ( to [MISC Russians  ] in the know and who have ties to [LOC Europe  ] . 
) WHERE IS THE MONEY KEPT ? 
NO ONE KNOWS. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) All of this being said , no one knows the precise mechanics of corruption due to anti-money laundering procedures currently in place in the [LOC United States  ] and [ORG European Union  ] , which require various proofs of identity and residency in order to open a legitimate bank account . 
However , the source said that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] -- a former deputy minister -- has an account at [ORG Citibank  ] in [LOC New York  ] . 
Some also suspect that , despite the [MISC Baltic  ] countries' ascension to the [ORG EU  ] , [MISC Baltic  ] banks are not following anti-money laundering procedures , since many [MISC Turkmen  ] citizens have [MISC Baltic  ] bank accounts. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Although [LOC Turkmenistan  ] is in a period of reform , corruption is here to stay , at least for the foreseeable future . 
Nevertheless , this aspect of doing business in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] is not dissuading others from wanting to enter the market , since there still seems to be a common acceptance that bribes are an integral part of the bidding and pricing system . 
But for [LOC U.S.  ] firms wishing to enter [LOC Turkmenistan  ] 's business environment , the need to compete with firms not bound by [LOC U.S.  ] anti-corruption laws adds a new layer of complexity and uncertainty . 
END COMMENT .
