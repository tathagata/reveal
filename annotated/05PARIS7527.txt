[LOC PARIS  ] 7525 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
OCTOBER 25 [LOC PARIS  ] [MISC POINTS Classified  ] By: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR [PER JOSIAH ROSENBLATT  ] , FOR REAS ONS 1.4 B/D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) During a conversation November 3 with terrorism investigating judge [PER Jean-Francois Ricard  ] , [PER Poloff  ] asked for his analysis of recent violence in the suburbs ( ref A ) . 
[PER Ricard  ] began by saying that no one in the [MISC French  ] government should be surprised by what has happened . 
Successive governments have tried and failed to integrate suburbs with high immigrant populations . 
For " the last twenty years , " said [PER Ricard  ] , the [ORG GOF  ] has known that the suburbs have become areas where respect for the state has dried up . 
As a result of this inattention , the suburbs with high immigrant populations have lost their [MISC French  ] identity and have built up an identity based on the " cites , " ( similar to the " projects " ) . 
[MISC French  ] symbols of authority , like the fireman and policeman , are considered to be " assassins " and worthy of being targeted . 
In addition , gangs and radical [MISC Islamic  ] groups have an interest in keeping the cites free of [ORG GOF  ] influence to maintain their freedom of operation . 
[MISC French  ] intelligence can only do so much , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
The areas need a substantial [ORG GOF  ] presence , i.e. , police and gendarmerie. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [PER Ricard  ] criticized many current [MISC French  ] analyses as " tired leftist critiques " uttered by those who have no understanding of the world of the cites . 
He said they focused only on socio-economic problems , viewing the cites inhabitants as victims of precarious living situations -- young people who are unemployed and uneducated , with poor prospects for the future . 
When he had been an ordinary investigating judge in the northern suburb of [LOC Bobigny  ] , [PER Ricard  ] said people were relatively well-off . 
They had cars and televisions and other material possessions . 
Other areas of [LOC France  ] , such as the north near [LOC Belgium  ] , were much poorer , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
The real problem was the [ORG GOF  ] 's failure to be present in these areas . 
Inhabitants developed a sense of being apart from [MISC French  ] society , and over time , became proud of this . 
The combination of setting oneself apart , real and/or imagined grievances against the [ORG GOF  ] , state inattention , and the interest of gangs and other groups , including [MISC Islamists  ] , to accentuate this divide , has led to the current unrest , said [ORG Ricard.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) If the unrest dies out " very quickly , " this would be bad news , said [PER Ricard  ] . 
It would mean that gangs and other groups in the cites exert a powerful control over those currently burning cars and assaulting police . 
These gangs have no interest in triggering a massive [ORG GOF  ] response , because it would mean the long-term " occupation " of the cites . 
If the unrest goes on for much more than a week , [PER Ricard  ] said it would signify that the cites have become completely anarchic . 
He speculated that one reason for the riots might have been [PER Sarkozy  ] 's announcement in late October of an increased [ORG GOF  ] security presence in the cites , including 17 companies of [ORG CRS  ] ( specialized crowd control police ) and 7 platoons of specialized gendarmes ( ref B ) . 
( Note: In a strangely prescient interview with [ORG Le Monde  ] on October 25 about his plan to increase security in the cites , [PER Sarkozy  ] said that , since the beginning of 2005 , " 9000 police vehicles " in [LOC France  ] have had stones and other projectiles thrown at them . 
Every night , [PER Sarkozy  ] continued , " between 20 and 40 " vehicles ( presumably not only police vehicles ) are burned or otherwise set on fire .
