( C ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] Minister of Finance [PER Steingrimur J. Sigfusson  ] predicted difficult times for [LOC Iceland  ] in the year ahead at a June 3 meeting with the [ORG CDA  ] . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] promised significant tax hikes and budget cuts , with much of the pain to come in the fall . 
Negotiations with labor and capital to map out a consensual road ahead have been unusually calm and understanding , particularly with often contentious government unions . 
He noted that agreements on loans from the [MISC Nordic  ] countries and [LOC Poland  ] are nearly finalized , but that promised support from [LOC Russia  ] is not nailed down . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] was confident that a mid-July review by the [ORG IMF  ] would go well . 
The Minister noted the government 's delicate balancing act regarding interest rate levels . 
He said that the " bleeding " [MISC Icelandic  ] business sector and considerable public clamor to relieve the debt burden of [MISC Icelandic  ] consumers argue for lowering rates . 
On the other hand , he is well aware of the [ORG IMF  ] 's concerns that quick and drastic reductions in rates could erode efforts to stabilize the kronur . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] confided that talks are underway again to resolve the [ORG Icesave  ] accounts issue . 
He said the " [LOC UK  ] is sending mixed messages , " while talks with the [MISC Dutch  ] are going better . 
Although not a supporter of joining the [ORG EU  ] himself , [PER Sigfusson  ] believes the [ORG Parliament  ] will agree to begin membership negotiations in the next few weeks . 
He believes that vote will be close , and that a " no " vote would bring down the current government . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On June 3 , at the [ORG Embassy  ] 's first meeting with Minister of Finance [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] since [LOC Iceland  ] 's April 25th elections , the Minister described the government 's May 28th sin tax hikes on alcohol , tobacco , and gasoline as " the first of many cold showers . 
" He said the taxes were raised without notice because of rumors that such an action was imminent and because it was a necessary measure that the government could take in the middle of the financial year without Parliamentary approval . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] said more unpopular announcements will come in the next week and that there will be a huge effort to raise revenues and cut expenditures before the start of the next fiscal year . 
These plans will be debated in the next [ORG Parliament  ] , which opens in [MISC October.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The government is trying to build a consensus for drastic actions by negotiating with key social partners ( business , government unions , and private sector unions and associations ) . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] said these discussions have proceeded with unusual calm and understanding . 
He noted that this was particularly the case with the government employee unions , which have been traditionally contentious negotiators . 
The unions are intent on saving jobs and are willing to forego wage increases for two years to do so . 
The Minister said that some private sector unions , particularly outside of [LOC Reykjavik  ] , have been reluctant to compromise on wage increases. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Sigfusson  ] was upbeat about the [ORG IMF  ] loan package . 
He said he expected a mid-July [ORG IMF  ] review , which he thought would go well . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] shared that all was on track with the loans from the [MISC Nordic  ] countries , which he suggested would be finalized soon . 
He was delighted that the [MISC Poles  ] were likely to provide the full $250 million that they had pledged last fall . 
They will be given a copy of the [MISC Nordic  ] paper work as a model ( " with the interest rate whited out " ) . 
The [MISC Russian  ] commitment of $500 million is less certain , but negotiations continue . 
A meeting with a high level [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Treasury  ] official is scheduled soon . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] admitted that if the [MISC Russian  ] funds fall through , [LOC Iceland  ] will be facing a gaping hole in their package . 
If this happens , he indicated they would go knocking on other doors , including [LOC Canada  ] , the [LOC United States  ] , other [MISC European  ] countries , and perhaps [LOC China.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG CDA  ] raised [ORG U.S. Treasury Department  ] concerns about the [LOC Iceland  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] 's recent steep interest rate cuts . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] noted that the government is feeling real political heat to lower rates . 
He said , " The business community is bleeding . 
" Lower rates are particularly important to revive the profitability of the banking sector , he said , which needs to reduce the gap between what they pay depositors and what they earn on their foreign loans . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] is very aware of the capital flight risks of lower rates , but feels that current controls to keep capital in the country are working effectively . 
The Minister said that he thought the risk posed by lower rates was worth it to preserve suffering [MISC Icelandic  ] businesses ( and the jobs they provide ) . 
He said that in the end that neither side would be happy . 
( Comment: The [ORG Central Bank  ] announced a rate cut of 1 percent on Thursday , well below the 6% cut that some advocated ) . 
When asked about whether the government was exerting more control over the [ORG Central Bank  ] , [PER Sigfusson  ] said that they have no real influence , but do exchange a lot of information. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Regarding the [ORG Icesave  ] negotiations , [PER Sigfusson  ] confided that " secret " talks are underway . 
He said , " We will announce the talks if progress is made . 
" ( Comment: A local daily carried a story on the talks in today 's paper . 
) [PER Sigfusson  ] reiterated that the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] will live up to its obligation to reimburse [ORG Icesave  ] depositors for their losses , as required by [ORG EU  ] regulations . 
However , he said the reimbursement scheme considered by the previous [LOC REYKJAVIK  ] 00000101 002 OF 002 government last year ( in which [LOC Iceland  ] would take loans from the [LOC U.K.  ] and [LOC Holland  ] for the full amount of the deposit guarantees it owes ) was not tenable . 
In its place , the government envisions a new payback plan: the assets of the banks would be liquidated over the next several years ( [PER Sigfusson  ] said it could take up to seven years ) and the returns from the assets would be turned over to the [LOC UK  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments to pay back [LOC Iceland  ] 's debt . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] estimated that these assets could cover up to 75% of the [LOC Iceland  ] government 's debt to the [LOC U.K.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The remaining debt would be paid back by a loan with terms to be determined after the final obligation is known . 
The advantage of this plan , according to [PER Sigfusson  ] , is that [LOC Iceland  ] would not be saddled with a huge loan on its books , which would affect the country 's financial ratings. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sigfusson  ] admitted that the [LOC Netherlands  ] is more open to this plan than are the [MISC British  ] . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] understand that there were faults with the [LOC EFTA  ] deposit insurance system and are sympathetic to the hard situation in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
On the other hand , [PER Sigfusson  ] stated , " The [LOC UK  ] government is sending mixed messages , and have delayed a few meetings . 
" He speculated that local [MISC British  ] politics , as well as the instigation of [MISC Anti-Terrorism  ] legislation and the loss of charity organization deposits , also contribute to [MISC British  ] reluctance to endorse the plan. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sigfusson  ] is clearly aware that the [ORG Icesave  ] negotiations will not likely be resolved before the anticipated [ORG IMF  ] review in July . 
In discussions with [ORG IMF  ] representative [PER Mark Flanagan  ] last week , the Minister asked [PER Flanagan  ] if [LOC Iceland  ] could proceed with the review if everything else was in order except an agreement with the [MISC British  ] . 
[PER Flanagan  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] had a right to ask for the review to proceed . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] indicated that [LOC Iceland  ] would ask other [ORG IMF Executive Committee  ] board members to prevent a [LOC UK  ] block of the review , should the [MISC British  ] seek to stop it. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Minister predicts that the [ORG Parliament  ] will approve a resolution to begin negotiations to join the [ORG European Union  ] before its summer recess . 
The vote will be close , as some of the opposition parties are milking the decision for political gain . 
He says the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) [ORG Party  ] has much riding on this vote , and that should it fail , the [LOC SDA/Left-Green  ] coalition government would likely fall . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] , himself skeptical of [ORG EU  ] membership , fears that many , especially in the [ORG SDA  ] , see the [ORG EU  ] as a panacea for all of [LOC Iceland  ] 's ills . 
He says , " Our priority should be fixing things here and now . 
The benefits of [ORG EU  ] membership are at least a decade away . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment: To the surprise of some , [PER Sigfusson  ] is proving to be a serious and responsible Minister of Finance . 
Although many in his [ORG Left-Green Party  ] have been suspicious of the [ORG IMF  ] loan from the start , the Minister has acknowledged to [LOC Emboffs  ] on several occasions the importance of the [ORG IMF  ] package and his commitment to ensure its success . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] has resisted ( probably while gritting his teeth ) most temptations to outright blame the current crisis on the excesses of capitalism . 
He does not hesitate , however , to take an occasional swipe at the rightist opposition and remind voters that [LOC Iceland  ] 's present economic mess is not of his doing . 
We are somewhat skeptical of the Minister 's read out on the status of the [ORG Icesave  ] negotiations . 
The [MISC British  ] Ambassador painted a much bleaker picture in conversations with [LOC Emboffs  ] a fortnight ago , saying the Icelanders have not been serious about addressing the issue , and that they were offering up naive " hair-brained " schemes of little substance to pay back the [MISC British  ] loans .
