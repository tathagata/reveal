REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) On October 28 , [LOC Libya  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] signed the bilateral agreement for the transfer from [LOC Libya  ] to [LOC Russia  ] of [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Highly-enriched Uranium  ] ( [ORG HEU  ] ) . 
The Ambassador signed for the [LOC U.S.  ] , and Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Atomic Energy Establishment  ] signed on behalf of [LOC Libya  ] . 
No press was in attendance , and there was no public statement made by either side , at the request of the [MISC Libyans.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Libyans  ] strongly objected to any public profile or press release for the event , stating that the issue of transferring nuclear fuel from [LOC Libya  ] was too sensitive to report before it actually took place . 
As reported reftel , the shipment is planned to take place on November 21 , 2009 . 
Based on updates from the DOE experts who have been traveling to [LOC Libya  ] to prepare the shipment , we are confident that the shipment will take place as planned . 
The Ambassador agreed with [PER Gashut  ] to revisit the press issue once the fuel transfer has been completed. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Comment: The signing of the [ORG HEU Agreement  ] is an important step on [LOC Libya  ] 's part towards fulfilling its commitments to dispose of its WMD . 
While it would have been a positive story to report , we are more interested in ensuring that the fuel transfer takes place with no problems , rather than to insist on press at this juncture . 
Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] 's [ORG Public Affairs Office  ] has been in touch with [ORG State and Department of Energy  ] counterparts to request that any public acknowledgement of the agreement signing be embargoed until after the shipment has taken place . 
End comment .
