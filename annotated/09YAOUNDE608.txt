( C ) Summary . 
Senior [MISC Gabonese  ] officials in the [ORG Bank of Central African States  ] ( [ORG BEAC  ] ) colluded to embezzle more than 18.3 billion [ORG CFA  ] ( about $36 million ) from the pooled reserves of the six states of the [ORG Central African Economic and Monetary Community  ] ( [ORG CEMAC  ] ) over the past five years , according to a senior [MISC Embassy  ] contact at the bank .

Audit Reveals Deeper Issues --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG BEAC  ] official asked [MISC Poloff  ] to meet on June 12 to discuss " a sensitive issue that I want the [LOC U.S.  ] to hear about from me , before it appears in the media . 
" Recalling the political tensions created by the revelation that [ORG BEAC  ] Governor and [MISC Gabonese  ] national [PER Philip Andzembe  ] had , in violation of [ORG BEAC  ] regulations and unbeknownst to the [ORG BEAC  ] board , placed 500 million euro of [ORG BEAC  ] deposits in a high-risk investment with [MISC French  ] bank [ORG Societe Generale  ] ( Reftel ) , the [ORG BEAC  ] official said the consequent review of [ORG BEAC  ] 's accounts had revealed even broader and more brazen malfeasance linked to a hierarchy of [MISC Gabonese  ] officials throughout [ORG BEAC  ] . 
( Note: Under the agreement that created [ORG BEAC  ] in 1972 it was decided that , in light of their relative economic predominance in the region , [LOC Cameroon  ] would host [ORG BEAC  ] 's headquarters while [LOC Gabon  ] would maintain exclusive power to appoint the [ORG BEAC  ] Governor .

) The [ORG Easy Way  ] to [ORG Rob  ] a [ORG Bank --------------------------  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG BEAC  ] official explained that [MISC Gabonese  ] President [PER Bongo  ] 's control of [ORG BEAC  ] was more extensive than the Governor 's office ; the Director of Accounting , the Deputy Director of Accounting , the officials overseeing international wire transfers , and the accountant in [ORG BEAC  ] 's [LOC Paris  ] branch have all been [MISC Gabonese  ] nationals appointed by [PER Bongo  ] . 
Working in concert , these officials were able to subvert [ORG BEAC  ] 's safeguards . 
The [LOC Paris  ] accountant was , until recently , [MISC Gabonese  ] national [PER Armand Brice Nzamba  ] , who is a close personal friend of [PER Ali Bongo  ] , according to Post 's contact at [ORG BEAC  ] . 
The [ORG BEAC  ] official said [ORG BEAC  ] had contacted the [LOC Paris  ] " financial police " who were investigating [PER Nzamba  ] until he fled [LOC France  ] earlier this year . 
[MISC Gabonese  ] national [PER Maurice Moutsinga  ] served as the Director of Accounting in [ORG BEAC Headquarters  ] for 20 years until his retirement in <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The embezzlement moved through three main Channels , according to the official: --in checks made out in the names of the [ORG BEAC  ] officials themselves ; [ORG BEAC  ] 's investigations have already tracked 18.3 billion [ORG CFA  ] ( $36.6 million ) that were embezzled in checks made out in the name of [MISC Gabonese  ] officials . 
As a result , [PER Nzamba  ] accumulated personal wealth of more than of more 1 billion [ORG CFA  ] ( $2 million ) on an annual salary of about $36,000 ; --in checks made payable to shell companies ; the main recipients were [PER Papieterie Classique  ] and [ORG Tour  ] 55 in [LOC France  ] and [LOC Chaiab  ] in [LOC Morocco  ] , and ; --in checks made out to [MISC Gabonese  ] politicians , including the wife of [PER Leon Mebiane  ] , who was [LOC Gabon  ] 's Prime Minister from 1975-1990 . 
Did [MISC French  ] Politicians Benefit ? ------------------------------- [ORG YAOUNDE  ] 00000608 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Asked what the officials did with the stolen funds , the [ORG BEAC  ] official responded , " sometimes they kept it for themselves , sometimes they funneled it to [MISC French  ] political parties . 
" Asked who received the funds , the official responded , " both sides , but mostly the right ; especially [MISC Chirac  ] and including [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
" The [ORG BEAC  ] official said " [PER Bongo  ] was [LOC France  ] 's favorite President in [LOC Africa  ] , " and " this is classic [LOC France  ] [ORG Afrique  ] . 
" He said technocrats from the [ORG French Treasury  ] were relatively progressive in encouraging the francophone governments to be more autonomous , but that the [ORG Banque de France  ] continued to exert an outsized influence . 
[ORG CEMAC  ] Presidency 's React ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG BEAC  ] official said the [ORG CEMAC  ] Heads of State were understandably upset to learn about the deeper governance problems at [ORG BEAC  ] . 
In a January 2009 meeting to discuss Anzembe 's deal with [ORG Societe Generale  ] , [PER Biya  ] had called for [PER Andzembe  ] 's immediate dismissal . 
According to the official , [PER Biya  ] pounded the table during a recent meeting with his [ORG CEMAC  ] counterparts and asked , in reference to his own anti-corruption campaign , " Don't you read the press ? 
We throw people like this in jail in my country ! 
" Equato-Guinean President [PER Obiang  ] , long-frustrated that his deposits at [ORG BEAC  ] exceeded his influence in the institution , was more " patient , " calling for audits because , according to the [ORG BEAC  ] official , " he knew what the audits would find [ regarding [PER Andzembe  ] 's malfeasance ] and that the resulting pressure to institute a Presidency that rotates among the member states would be inevitable . 
" Audit of [ORG SG Placement Continues  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG Audit Committee  ] includes representatives from the six [ORG CEMAC  ] economies plus a representative from the [ORG French Treasury  ] . 
The Heads of [MISC States  ] agreed to conduct two audits , a general review of internal accounts and a specific investigation into [PER Andzembe  ] 's unauthorized placement of funds at [ORG Societe Generale  ] . 
According to the [ORG BEAC  ] official , the investigators have yet to understand fully the details of the [ORG SG  ] account . 
" Even [ORG SG  ] tells us that they are unable to determine the structure of the investment that Anzembe made ! 
" he marveled . 
The official theorized that [ORG SG  ] had used the [ORG BEAC  ] funds to help " plug the hole " created by the [LOC Kerviel  ] rogue trader scandal , but that the financial crisis had overwhelmed [ORG SG  ] and swallowed [ORG BEAC  ] 's funds . 
Jail for Some ; End of [LOC Gabon  ] 's Monopoly ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG BEAC  ] official said his own government and others would seek jail time for some of the officials , but that there would be pressure to deal delicately with the new [MISC Gabonese  ] Government . 
[PER Ali Bongo  ] , he said , is close personal friends with [ORG BEAC  ] Governor Anzembe . 
Institutionally , he predicted , these scandals will mean the end of [LOC Gabon  ] 's monopoly on the [LOC Governorship  ] , which will now rotate among the member states , and will lead to revisions to internal controls . 
[ORG Comment: A Governance Lesson Learned  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) This tale of grand-scale corruption is unfortunate , especially coming as it does during an economic crisis that has depleted the region 's resources , but the strong reaction from [PER Biya  ] and [PER Obiang  ] suggests [LOC Gabon  ] 's foul play might result in better management--more transparency and autonomy--of [ORG BEAC  ] 's resources . 
Our hope is that [ORG CEMAC  ] leaders internalize the lesson that secretive management of public resources is a recipe for waste and abuse and apply it to [ORG BEAC  ] and their domestic institutions . 
Post is unable to assess the veracity of the allegation that [MISC French  ] politicians benefitted from [ORG BEAC  ] 's loss , but it is the type of claim--that [LOC France  ] encourages and preys upon corrupt leaders in the region--that will gain currency in popular opinion if , as the [ORG BEAC  ] official predicted , the story leaks to the press .
