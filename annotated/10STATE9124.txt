BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With its [ORG P5+1  ] partners , the [LOC U.S.  ] has been pursuing a policy towards [LOC Iran  ] that includes engagement STATE 00009124 002 OF 006 and incentives , as well as pressure . 
Since the 1 October 2009 meeting of the [ORG P5+1 Political Directors  ] and representatives from [LOC Iran  ] , the [LOC United States  ] has been working closely with its partners to engage with [LOC Iran  ] to build international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program . 
Based on the agreement in principle reached with [LOC Iran  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] , we have focused on supporting the [ORG IAEA  ] 's proposal for refueling the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) , facilitating the [ORG IAEA  ] 's investigation of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at [LOC Qom  ] , and pressing for a follow-on meeting between [ORG P5+1 Political Directors  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] representatives explicitly on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The results since October 1 have been disappointing . 
[LOC Iran  ] has not accepted the [ORG IAEA  ] 's [ORG TRR  ] proposal ; instead , [LOC Iran  ] has rejected a series of updated and more flexible proposals from the [ORG IAEA  ] and our partners on some terms of the proposal ( REF A ) , and has offered a substantially different counterproposal which fails to address the concerns about its nuclear program , does not fulfill the objective of building confidence in [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear intentions , and , as [ORG EU  ] High Representative [PER Lady Ashton  ] described , in effect rejects the [ORG IAEA  ] 's proposal . 
[LOC Iran  ] has also announced its intent to expand its nuclear program , including its intention to start enriching uranium to higher levels to make its own [ORG TRR  ] fuel if its terms are not accepted on the fuel deal . 
Although [LOC Iran  ] granted [ORG IAEA  ] access to the facility at [LOC Qom  ] , its cooperation was limited and there remain serious questions about [LOC Iran  ] 's intentions for the facility , which is in open defiance of five [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions . 
Finally , [LOC Iran  ] to date has gone back on its earlier commitment to meet again with the [ORG P5+1  ] to discuss its nuclear program. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER El-Baradei  ] released his latest report on [LOC Iran  ] on November 16 , 2009 , and the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] ( [ORG BoG  ] ) adopted a resolution on [LOC Iran  ] on November 27 , 2009 . 
The resolution notes the [ORG Board of Governors'  ] serious concern that [LOC Iran  ] continues to defy the requirements and obligations contained in [LOC UNSC  ] resolutions and [ORG IAEA  ] resolutions . 
The [ORG Board of Governors  ] also expressed its serious concern that contrary to the request of the [ORG Board of Governors  ] and requirements of the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , [LOC Iran  ] has neither implemented the Additional Protocol nor provided the access necessary for the [ORG IAEA  ] to provide assurance as to the absence of additional undeclared nuclear activities. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) President [PER Obama  ] , Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , and other [ORG P5+1  ] leaders identified the end of 2009 as a key period for assessing [LOC Iran  ] 's responsiveness . 
While the offer of engagement remains on the table , we have begun to work with partners to prepare new measures to increase pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
DIPLOMATIC POLICY NARRATIVE --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER Begin  ] talking points: Overview: Where We 've Been , and Where We Are -------------------------------------------- -- The President made clear his readiness to open a new page in our relations with [LOC Iran  ] , based on mutual respect . 
This new approach featured our offer to engage [LOC Iran  ] directly , as well as our readiness to become a full and active participant in the [ORG P5+1  ] 's efforts to resolve international concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program through negotiations . 
-- We stated clearly our support for [LOC Iran  ] 's right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy provided [LOC Iran  ] meets its STATE 00009124 003 OF 006 international obligations and carries out its responsibilities within the NPT framework . 
-- When we met with the [MISC Iranian  ] delegation in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 , along with our [ORG P5+1  ] partners , we sought [LOC Iran  ] 's commitment to three concrete actions , which would demonstrate its intentions for its nuclear program: -- support the [ORG IAEA  ] 's proposal for refueling the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ; -- facilitate the [ORG IAEA  ] 's full investigation of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at [LOC Qom  ] ; -- agree to a follow-on meeting between [ORG P5+1 Political Directors  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] representatives by the end of October , explicitly focused on nuclear issues but also open to discussion of any issues raised by any party . 
-- Each of these agreed actions presented [LOC Iran  ] with an important opportunity to begin to assure the international community about its intentions for its nuclear program and to pursue together a diplomatic resolution to our differences . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] has not followed through on any of these three commitments . 
-- President [PER Obama  ] also stated last year that we would continually assess [LOC Iran  ] 's responsiveness to these offers , and that the end of the year would present a key period of assessment . 
-- It is increasingly clear that [LOC Iran  ] has not taken advantage of the opportunities we have offered . 
-- A year into the [PER Obama  ] administration , [LOC Iran  ] has not taken practical , concrete steps that would begin to create confidence in its nuclear intentions . 
Iran: -- Continues to enrich uranium despite [ORG UNSC  ] requirements that it suspend such operations ; -- Revealed it had been building a secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base near [LOC Qom  ] , in violation of its safeguards agreement and [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions ; -- Continues to refuse cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] in addressing the full range of [ORG IAEA  ] questions about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program ; -- Has not accepted the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal to refuel the [ORG TRR  ] , which was a response to an [MISC Iranian  ] request , despite [LOC U.S.  ] and our partners' significant efforts to be flexible and address [MISC Iranian  ] concerns with the deal ; and -- Since meeting with representatives of the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 , has refused all subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to discuss its nuclear program . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] has not been able to say " yes " to a balanced [ORG IAEA  ] proposal that would provide fuel for its [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] and begin to build mutual trust and confidence , notably by transferring 1,200kgs of its low enriched uranium abroad as an indication of [LOC Iran  ] 's peaceful nuclear intent . 
-- Underscoring the significance of the [ORG IAEA  ] 's [ORG TRR  ] proposal , in November 2009 , former [ORG IAEA  ] DG [PER ElBaradei  ] said that the proposal had " extensive built-in guarantees...the [MISC Russians  ] are guaranteeing implementation . 
STATE 00009124 004 OF 006 The [MISC Americans  ] are ready for the first time to guarantee the implementation . 
The [ [ORG IAEA  ] ] will take custody of [LOC Iran  ] 's material so the international community as a whole will guarantee " implementation . 
-- On [LOC Iran  ] 's desire to retain possession of its nuclear material under delivery of the fuel ( which is the basis of [LOC Iran  ] 's counterproposal ) , Dr. [PER ElBaradei  ] rejected this approach , saying publicly in November after [LOC Iran  ] first raised this idea that this would " defeat the whole purpose of the [ORG IAEA  ] 's agreement...this is not a solution . 
" ; -- While it allowed [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors to visit its newly revealed enrichment site near [LOC Qom  ] , it did not provide the [ORG IAEA  ] with the full access the organization requested , notably by agreeing to the [ORG IAEA  ] 's request for access to specific [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear officials and answering [ORG IAEA  ] questions regarding the history and purpose of the facility . 
The clandestine construction of this facility was inconsistent with [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG IAEA Safeguards Agreement  ] , and is in open defiance of [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions . 
-- As the [ORG IAEA  ] reported in November 2009 , [LOC Iran  ] continues to develop its nuclear program regardless of international concerns and [ORG IAEA  ] , NPT , and [ORG UNSC  ] requirements - most starkly in its construction of a secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base near [LOC Qom  ] . 
As former Director General [PER El-Baradei  ] 's report on November 16 outlines , this facility and the circumstances surrounding it raises the persistent question of additional such undeclared facilities . 
-- The [ORG IAEA  ] report makes clear that [LOC Iran  ] has failed to cooperate fully and transparently with the [ORG IAEA  ] , answering questions about the use of this facility and the possibility of other facilities . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] has failed to take advantage of the creative [ORG TRR  ] proposal , engage with us constructively on other elements of its nuclear program , and cooperate fully with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
It also still defies [ORG UNSC  ] requirements that it suspend its enrichment program , instead announcing an expansion of its nuclear program . 
Even more , it is threatening to begin enriching its [ORG LEU  ] to higher levels of enrichment if the international community does not accept a [ORG TRR  ] deal on its terms , terms that would not build confidence as they would reduce and delay transfers of [ORG LEU  ] from [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] 's continued nuclear activities and its refusal to engage meaningfully with the international community risks a possible arms race in the region and undermines the global international nonproliferation regime as a whole . 
-- As you know , [LOC Israel  ] has stated that an [LOC Iran  ] with nuclear weapons poses a great threat to its security and that it reserves the right to defend itself . 
We believe [LOC Iran  ] 's continued non-compliance with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program poses serious threats to stability in the region . 
Presenting [LOC Iran  ] with a united global front is the best avenue to resolve the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue through diplomatic means . 
-- In addition to its disregard of its nuclear-related obligations , [LOC Iran  ] continues to support terrorist organizations like [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] , and militant groups in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It also provides some support to the [MISC Taliban  ] to facilitate attacks against ISAF forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
-- Also of deep concern to the international community is the dramatic uptick in repression inside [LOC Iran  ] . 
As Secretary [PER Clinton  ] said recently , we are deeply disturbed STATE 00009124 005 OF 006 by the ruthless repression that [LOC Iran  ] is exercising against its citizens who seek to exercise their universal right to free expression and assembly . 
The Pressure Aspect of the [MISC Strategy: Making the Case  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- -- The two elements of the P5+1 strategy - engagement/incentives and pressure -- were always intended to run in parallel , because without a credible threat of consequences , it is unlikely that [LOC Iran  ] will make a strategic or even tactical change in direction . 
-- For that reason , we have always recognized the possibility that we would need to increase pressure to sharpen the choice that [LOC Iran  ] faces in order to persuade [LOC Iran  ] that the international community is serious . 
-- Still , our emphasis over the course of this year has been on outreach and engagement rather than pressure . 
Unfortunately , to date , [LOC Iran  ] has failed to respond constructively . 
-- Pressure is not an end in itself ; it is a means to encourage [LOC Iran  ] to recalculate costs and benefits , and to return to a course of constructive engagement at the negotiating table . 
But without unmistakable and meaningful consequences , there seems little prospect for such a return . 
-- The international community has already imposed strict measures on [LOC Iran  ] via various multilateral fora to demonstrate that [LOC Iran  ] cannot ignore its responsibilities without cost . 
We believe a more aggressive enforcement of this existing and robust international framework , along with the application of significant additional pressure , will illustrate to [LOC Iran  ] the sharp choices it faces should it continue to rebuff efforts to resolve our differences diplomatically . 
-- Unity among members of the international community is absolutely essential to demonstrate to [LOC Iran  ] that there are serious consequences for its continued refusal to engage constructively with the international community over its nuclear program . 
Such unity was clear when the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] adopted its [LOC Iran  ] resolution in November . 
It was also clear in the [ORG European Council  ] 's declaration on [LOC Iran  ] issued in December . 
Both were useful and immediate opportunities to increase pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- We believe [LOC Iran  ] 's continued non-compliance regarding its nuclear program deserves the full and urgent attention of the international community . 
Next Steps ---------- -- We stand behind our offer to engage with [LOC Iran  ] , but we are rapidly approaching the moment when we will have to give full meaning to all elements of our strategy . 
We , along with our partners , believe that the time has come to increase pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Such pressure is necessary to uphold the integrity of the [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] , and demonstrate that continued non-compliance has consequences . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] believes that multilateral pressure would be best achieved through new [ORG UN Security Council  ] action and swift implementation of that action . 
-- However , [ORG UN  ] action alone may not be sufficient to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to change course . 
There is much more that can and should be done immediately to implement measures already required under the existing international sanctions framework . 
We therefore ask our partners to STATE 00009124 006 OF 006 ensure that we are collectively enforcing all those measures that are already in place as comprehensively as possible . 
-- We regret that [LOC Iran  ] has missed repeated opportunities for meaningful engagement . 
Our intent is not to escalate a conflict , but to press for a diplomatic resolution . 
Inaction is what the [MISC Iranians  ] are hoping for , as they draw closer to achieving a nuclear weapons capability . 
-- On January 16 , we and our P5+1 partners met to take stock and discuss next steps regarding [LOC Iran  ] . 
As the Chair 's statement reflects , we agreed that [LOC Iran  ] has failed to follow up on the key understandings reached in our meeting with the [MISC Iranian  ] delegation on October 1 , <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
We are united and remain committed to our approach - while we will continue to seek a negotiated diplomatic solution , we believe it is time for consideration of appropriate further measures . 
-- We are here today to intensify our consultations with you , as one of our partners in the international community , on next appropriate steps aimed to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with its international obligations . 
-- We urge these steps with steady determination that we must do everything we can , including applying greater pressure , to encourage [LOC Iran  ] to return to a constructive course of engagement . 
FOR [ORG EU  ] MEMBER STATES , USEU , AND [LOC TOKYO  ] ONLY: -- As we move ahead with and beyond the [ORG UN  ] process , we also will want to work with you to agree on additional actions we could take on a coordinated , national basis to magnify the impact of a new [ORG Security Council Resolution and  ] demonstrate to [LOC Iran  ] our seriousness of purpose .
