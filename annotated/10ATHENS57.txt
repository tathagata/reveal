END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On January 22 Ambassador [PER Speckhard  ] met for 45 minutes with the [MISC Greek  ] Minister of [ORG Citizen Protection  ] , [PER Michalis Chrysochoidis  ] . 
This was the third in a series of meetings by the ambassador to hear from senior [MISC Greek  ] officials about the ongoing reorganization of [MISC Greece’s  ] security , intelligence , and law enforcement agencies under the umbrella of the [ORG Ministry of Citizen Protection  ] ( [ORG MCP  ] ) , which was formed after the election of the center-left [ORG Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement  ] ( [ORG PASOK  ] ) government in October 2009 . 
This meeting was intended to obtain a status report on the ambitious plan that [PER Chrysochoidis  ] discussed with the ambassador at their previous meeting on November 12 , 2009 ( Ref A ) . 
The meeting was held in [LOC Chrysochoidis’  ] office in the headquarters of the [ORG MCP  ] . 
The ambassador was accompanied by the [ORG DCM  ] , the [ORG RAS  ] chief , [PER Legatt  ] , and the ICE chief , while [PER Chrysochoidis  ] was unaccompanied. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Chrysochoidis  ] began the meeting by noting that he had just returned from [LOC Toledo  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , where he had been with the Secretary of [LOC Homeland Security  ] on 21 January . 
He said that the two main issues that he had taken away from the conference were the challenges for [MISC EU  ] countries of internally coordinating authorities and sharing intelligence and of cooperating effectively with the [LOC United States  ] in counterterrorist initiatives . 
He remarked that it was pointless for each country to amass large amounts of information and intelligence but not to share that body of data to produce results. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The ambassador said that in the two previous days he had held meetings with the commandant of the [ORG Hellenic Coast Guard  ] ( Ref B ) and the chief of the [ORG Hellenic National Police  ] ( [ORG HNP  ] ) ( Ref C ) and had noted their focus on creating an atmosphere of interagency cooperation . 
He asked [PER Chrysochoidis  ] for an update on how his reorganization under the [ORG MCP  ] was proceeding and how successfully were agencies cooperating inside of the [ORG MCP  ] . 
The ambassador informed [PER Chrysochoidis  ] that he had proposed to [ORG HNP  ] Chief Ikonomou the creation of a local [MISC MCP-Embassy  ] working group on counterterrorism , so that the [LOC U.S.  ] side could best reinforce and support the [MISC Greek  ] side’s efforts. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Regarding the [ORG Hellenic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG HCG  ] ) , [PER Chrysochoidis  ] said that his goal was to organize its functions around its natural missions , namely protection of [MISC Greece’s  ] maritime borders and ports . 
At the end of January he will propose a bill in the parliament to create a new [ORG Coast Guard  ] , whose changed role will be reflected in its new name . 
Currently its name in [MISC Greek  ] means [ORG Harbor Corps  ] ( limeniko soma ) , but henceforth its name in [MISC Greek  ] really will mean [ORG Coast Guard  ] ( aktofylaki ) . 
It will be modeled very closely on the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] and oriented to fighting crime and protecting [MISC Greece’s  ] maritime borders . 
[PER Chrysochoidis  ] predicted that the new [ORG HCG  ] would be up and running by [MISC April.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Chrysochoidis  ] severely criticized the state of [LOC EYP  ] , [MISC Greece’s  ] domestic security and intelligence service . 
He said bluntly , “EYP is nothing.” It does not serve its mission of protecting [LOC Greece  ] and in fact is dangerous to national security because of its many shortcomings , not the least of which is a unionize d labor force . 
As a result , [PER Chrysochoidis  ] declared , he intends to “collapse and rebuild it” via a draft law that is in the process of being drawn up . 
ATHENS 00000057 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) As for the [ORG HNP  ] , he repeated his many public comments that [MISC Greece’s  ] police force is not up to task of safeguarding society . 
As a result , he is restructuring it and trying to instill in it a new attitude toward its duties . 
Part of that drives includes creation of a new agency to fight cyber crime , organized crime , etc . 
Vacancy notices already have gone out for 100 new positions to be filled by economists , computer specialists , etc. , who will bring new , modern skills to the [ORG HNP  ] . 
These 100 new hires will be merged with other officers and located in a new building , so that a fresh modern agency can be built . 
[PER Chrysochoidis  ] announced that this plan would be rolled out by the end of February , so that it can begin work in [LOC March.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chrysochoidis  ] said of the [ORG Firefighting Service  ] , which now falls under the [ORG MCP  ] , that it has enjoyed good cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts but that he was open to all suggestions about increasing collaboration and training. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) On domestic terrorism , [PER Chrysochoidis  ] said that the police know the identities of almost all the members of the current terrorist-anarchist groups , but they lack the evidentiary basis for arresting and imprisoning them . 
He cited the recent example of a bombing on [LOC Syngrou Avenue  ] , saying that the police know who carried it out but do not have the concrete evidence to move against them . 
He said that the great challenge for the police is collecting the information necessary to prosecute terrorists . 
He repeated earlier claims ( Ref C ) that there are links between some domestic terrorist groups and the [LOC Middle East  ] , including [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Chrysochoidis  ] expressed optimism that if his newly invigorated counterterrorist teams at [ORG EYP  ] and [ORG HNP  ] did their work well , especially their technical collection operations , they would succeed in wrapping up all of the main terrorist groups in the first half of 2010. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Chrysochoidis  ] expressed full support for the ambassador’s proposal for a local counterterrorist working group consisting of [ORG HNP  ] , [ORG EYP  ] , and [ORG HCG  ] on the [MISC Greek  ] side and [ORG FBI  ] , [ORG DEA-ICE  ] , and [ORG RAS  ] on the [MISC American  ] side . 
He said that he would call the embassy in the near future to get the idea started . 
He stated forcefully that he wanted outstanding cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and that the [ORG MCP  ] did not want to have any secrets from the [MISC American  ] side when it came to work against terrorists . 
He welcomed training across the MCP’s agencies as each underwent fundamental reform. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chrysochoidis  ] had just started to respond to the ambassador’s question about [MISC Greek  ] work against human trafficking , especially child labor and the sex industry , when he received a call that summoned him to the prime minister’s office . 
As he was getting ready to leave , he did say that [LOC Greece  ] was taking active steps to deal with the problems associated with illegal immigration , including passage of a law on citizenship that would grant legal status to many immigrants . 
In addition , [MISC Greek  ] authorities were trying to end the demand for smuggling rings by closing the exit points to [LOC Europe  ] , including the ports of [LOC Patra  ] and [LOC Igoumenitsa  ] . 
[LOC Greece  ] also wanted to draw a line in the eastern [MISC Aegean  ] , but needed the support of [LOC Turkey  ] .
