( C ) [PER Rob Swartbol  ] ( PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's diplomatic advisor ) ( [ORG STRICTLY PROTECT  ] ) told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] late December 6 he was alarmed about efforts by [LOC France  ] , [LOC Austria  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] to promote a third way/privileged partnership alternative for [LOC Turkey  ] . 
He said that the [MISC Dutch  ] were working to get [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC UK  ] together to counterbalance them . 
[PER Balkenende  ] may travel to the [LOC UK  ] to meet PM [PER Blair  ] on Friday . 
He will meet [MISC Erdogan  ] in [LOC Brussels  ] on Thursday night and plans to see [PER Schroeder  ] and [MISC Chirac  ] next week in capitals. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
In a separate conversation with the [ORG DCM  ] , [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] ( MFA , [ORG European Integration  ] ) ( [ORG STRICTLY PROTECT  ] ) said he believed the [LOC Turkey  ] accession talks are still on track for a positive result December 17 although they need careful steering by the [MISC Dutch  ] to keep them there . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] had reassured the [LOC Turks  ] that there was nothing to rumors of [MISC Dutch  ] willingness to support movement toward a third way . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will keep holding the line on accession talks leading to full membership , [PER de Gooijer  ] promised . 
[LOC CYPRUS  ] AND [LOC GREECE  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[PER Swartbol  ] insisted the [LOC Turks  ] needed to make a serious gesture on or before December 17 by agreeing to sign the [ORG Ankara Protocol  ] before the start of negotiations . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] continued to work hard to prevent others packaging this as a pre-condition for [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that [LOC Turkey  ] has signaled very clearly they can live with the [LOC Cyprus  ] language as it now stands , that is , they tacitly agree to promise on December 17 that they will sign the protocol before the starting date . 
PM [PER Balkenende  ] flies to [LOC Greece  ] and [LOC Cyprus  ] tonight to meet [MISC Karamanlis  ] Tuesday morning and [MISC Papadopolous Tuesday  ] afternoon . 
He intends to push hard against any threatened [LOC Cyprus  ] veto . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] repeated that some Member States have been pushing for language about the [ORG UN Cyprus Settlement  ] . 
The [LOC Turks  ] had adamantly opposed it , the [ORG GOC  ] had not indicated how they feel and the [MISC Dutch  ] continued to work hard to kill it . 
Finally , on [LOC Greece  ] , [PER Swartbol  ] told the Ambassador that the [MISC Dutch  ] have resisted [LOC Greece  ] 's push for stronger language on cross border issues . 
( Note: the new draft text adds a reference to referral of disputes to the [ORG ICJ  ] in paragraph 20 ; see text below . 
) PERMANENT SAFEGUARDS ON LABOR - PROBLEM OR CLEVER STRATEGY ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Swartbol  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that [LOC Sweden  ] , [LOC Finland  ] and even the [LOC UK  ] might be willing to accept permanent safeguard language stronger than [LOC Turkey  ] would accept . 
[PER Swartbol  ] seemed very concerned that these countries were taking such a problematic position . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] separately explained that the [LOC UK  ] had not rejected safeguards outright . 
He took this to mean the [LOC UK  ] was taking a softer position on this issue to bring problem countries along and to help ensure [LOC Turkey  ] gets an unqualified yes with a date . 
The [MISC British  ] reportedly think some flexibility on safeguards would make a difference in negotiations . 
[ORG REDRAFTED COUNCIL  ] CONCLUSIONS PRESENT NO NEW PROBLEMS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER De Gooijer  ] shared the redrafted [ORG Council Conclusions  ] that will be circulated to member states for the December 8 COREPER meeting ( full text faxed to [ORG EUR/ERA  ] ) . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] said he and the [MISC Dutch  ] had been accused by the [MISC French  ] and others of deliberately leaking the previous version to create favorable momentum for [LOC Turkey  ] . 
On an optimistic note , he observed that only [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Denmark  ] came back with new language after the last COREPER , where the [MISC Dutch  ] circulated original draft language for the [ORG Council  ] decision . 
He took this to mean the other 22 Member States could live with what they had seen , a positive sign for a positive result on December 17. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At first glance , non-trivial changes include: para 17: new language re [ORG EU  ] integration and absorption capacity ; para 18: new language referring to specific [MISC Turkish  ] legislation , close monitoring by the commission , and a zero-tolerance policy on torture ; para 20: new language on neighborly dispute resolution including reference to the [ORG ICJ  ] ; para 22: tic one: new language describing how the acquis chapters will be handled ; tic five: revised language on qualified majority voting on the brake ; and a new reference to the [ORG European Parliament  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) BEGIN TEXT OF DRAFT CONCLUSIONS ON TURKEY: Quote [LOC Turkey  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
The [ORG European Council  ] recalled its previous conclusions regarding [LOC Turkey  ] , in which at a first stage it agreed that [LOC Turkey  ] was a candidate state destined to join the [ORG Union  ] on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate states and , subsequently , concluded that , if it were to decide at its December 2004 meeting , on the basis of a report and recommendation from the [ORG Commission  ] , that [LOC Turkey  ] fulfills the [LOC Copenhagen  ] political criteria , the [ORG European Union  ] will open accession negotiations with [LOC Turkey  ] without delay . 
It also recalled its previous conclusions that the [ORG Union  ] , s capacity to absorb new members , while maintaining the momentum of [MISC European  ] integration , is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the [ORG Union  ] and the candidate countries. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
The [ORG European Council  ] welcomed the decisive progress made by [LOC Turkey  ] in its far-reaching reform process and reiterated its determination to enable [LOC Turkey  ] to join the [MISC European  ] community of values , confident that [LOC Turkey  ] will sustain the process of reform to that end . 
Furthermore , it expects [LOC Turkey  ] to actively pursue its efforts to bring into force the six specific items of legislation identified by the [ORG Commission  ] . 
To ensure the irreversibility of the political reform process and its full implementation , notably with regard to fundamental freedoms and to full respect of human rights , that process will continue to be closely monitored by the [ORG Commission  ] , which is invited to continue to report regularly on it to the [ORG Council  ] , addressing all identified points of concern , including the implementation of the zero-tolerance policy relating to torture and ill-treatment. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
The [ORG European Council  ] welcomed [LOC Turkey  ] , s ( decision ) to sign the protocol regarding the adaptation of the [ORG Ankara Agreement  ] , taking account of the accession of the ten new Member [LOC States.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
The [ORG European Council  ] welcomed the improvement in [LOC Turkey  ] , s relations with its neighbours and [LOC Turkey  ] , s unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations and its readiness to continue to work with Member States towards resolution of border disputes , in conformity with the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the [ORG United Nations Charter  ] . 
In accordance with its previous conclusions , the [ORG European Council  ] reviewed the situation relating to outstanding disputes ; in this connection it reaffirmed its view that unresolved bilateral issues , which might have repercussions on the accession process , should if necessary be brought to the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] for settlement. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
The [ORG European Council  ] noted the resolution adopted by the [ORG European Parliament  ] on ( ( ) December 2005 . 
( PM: decision , date , process ) Framework for negotiations <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
The [ORG European Council  ] agreed that accession negotiations with individual candidate states will be based on a framework for negotiations . 
Each framework , which will be established by the [ORG Council  ] on a proposal by the [ORG Commission  ] , taking account of the experience of the fifth enlargement process , will address the following elements , according to own merits and specific situations and characteristics of each candidate state: -- As in previous negotiations , the substance of the negotiations , which will be conducted in an [ORG Intergovernmental Conference  ] where decisions require unanimity , will be broken down into a number of chapters , each covering a specific policy area . 
The [ORG Council  ] , acting by unanimity on a proposal by the [ORG Commission  ] , will lay down benchmarks for the provisional closure and , where appropriate , for the opening of each chapter ; depending on the chapter concerned , these benchmarks will refer to legislative alignment and a satisfactory track record of implementation of the acquis as well as obligations deriving from contractual relations with the [ORG European Union  ] . 
-- Long transition periods , derogations , specific arrangements or permanent safeguard clauses may be considered . 
The [ORG Commission  ] will include these , as appropriate , in its proposals for each framework , for areas such as freedom of movement of persons , structural policies or agriculture . 
Furthermore , the decision-taking process regarding the eventual establishment of freedom of movement of persons should allow for a maximum role of individual Member States . 
Transitional arrangements or safeguards should be reviewed regarding their impact on competition or the functioning of the internal market . 
-- The financial aspects of accession of a candidate state must be allowed for in the applicable [MISC Financial Framework  ] . 
Hence , accession negotiations yet to be opened with candidates whose accession could have substantial financial consequences requiring financial reform can only be concluded after the establishment of the [MISC Financial Framework  ] for the period from 2014. -- ( PM: paragraph regarding goal and outcome of negotiations ; ref . 
COM line: &open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand8 ) -- In the case of a serious and persistent breach in a candidate state of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which the [ORG Union  ] is founded , the [ORG Commission  ] will , at its own initiative or on the request of the Members States , recommend the suspension of negotiations and propose the conditions for eventual resumption . 
The [ORG Council  ] will decide by qualified majority on such a recommendation , after having heard the candidate state , whether to suspend the negotiations and on the conditions for their resumption . 
The Member States will act in the [ORG IGC  ] in accordance with the [ORG Council  ] decision , without prejudice to the general requirement for unanimity in the [ORG IGC  ] . 
The [ORG European Parliament  ] will be informed . 
-- Parallel to accession negotiations , the [ORG Union  ] will engage with every candidate state in an intensive political and cultural dialogue . 
With the aim of enhancing mutual understanding by bringing people together , this inclusive dialogue also will involve civil society .
