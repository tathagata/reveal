( C ) SUMMARY: Greece’s new [MISC PASOK-led  ] government has placed migration and asylum policy reform high on its agenda , announcing new measures to combat organized human smugglers , ease naturalization requirements for immigrants born in [LOC Greece  ] , provide status to illegal economic migrants , and transfer Greece’s asylum process to a new independent authority . 
This flurry of activity , all coming during PASOK’s first two months in office , reflects the deep importance [MISC Greek  ] officials and voters attach to immigration and its social , economic , and security implications for [LOC Greece  ] . 
Prime Minister [PER George Papandreou  ] and his cabinet are acutely aware of the criticism leveled at Greece’s asylum process and migrant detention centers by human rights organizations . 
The new [MISC Greek  ] strategy involves not only domestic policy reforms but also “Europeanizing” the issue of migration enforcement: putting pressure on the [ORG EU  ] to provide more support on border security , urging [LOC Turkey  ] to crack down on human smuggling in the [LOC Aegean  ] and to take back deportees , and revamping the [ORG Dublin II  ] agreement , which saddles [LOC Greece  ] with responsibility for all migrants entering [LOC Europe  ] through its borders . 
Despite some success in placing migration on the broader [ORG EU  ] agenda , however , the government faces daunting challenges in toughening migration enforcement and implementing a comprehensive , effective migration policy . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------------------------------- Migration: A Key Geopolitical and Social Challenge ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Greece  ] has become the [ORG EU  ] entry point of choice for illegal migrants and refugees , many of whom seek residence in [LOC Western Europe  ] and seek only to transit through [LOC Greece  ] . 
Since 2004 , the number of illegal immigrants arrested has surged by 325 percent , from 44,987 to 146,337 in 2008--and this number is only a fraction of the true number of migrant arrivals . 
Greece’s long coastline and the proximity of its islands to [LOC Turkey  ] makes the country particularly attractive to maritime human smugglers , many of whom have shifted their operations away from more heavily patrolled [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Italian  ] waters . 
The undersized and ill-equipped [ORG Greek Coast Guard  ] has struggled to keep up . 
Even if the migrants move on to other [MISC European  ] destinations , under the [ORG Dublin II  ] protocol , [LOC Greece  ] is responsible for their asylum applications as the [ORG EU  ] country of first entry--a situation neither the [MISC Greeks  ] nor the immigrants like. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While nearly half of all illegal migrants come from neighboring [LOC Albania  ] , the more visible surge in immigrants from conflict zones in the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC South Asia  ] , and [LOC Africa  ] has [MISC Greeks  ] particularly worried . 
Migrants participated in the violent protests in [LOC Athens  ] between December 2008 and March 2009 ( see REF A ) , and immigrant squatters have taken over some [LOC Athens  ] neighborhoods and exacerbated “Greek flight” from downtown areas . 
Without legal status , lacking opportunities for economic and social integration , and chafing under [MISC Greek  ] refusals to build an official mosque , [MISC Muslim  ] illegal migrants--especially young men from [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and Somalia--may be vulnerable to [MISC Islamic  ] radicalization in the underground prayer rooms that have proliferated throughout major cities ( see REF A ) . 
Until recently , [LOC Greece  ] was an immigration sending country , and the rapid transition to receiving migrants has been jarring--many [MISC Greeks  ] see uncontrolled waves of illegal immigration as a major economic and social destabilizer . 
In fact , there are key political implications as well: public dissatisfaction with the [ORG previous New Democracy  ] government’s handling of migration policy and enforcement likely contributed to its October electoral loss , and [LOC LAOS  ] , a far-right party , has surged in recent elections on a nationalist , anti-immigration platform . 
[ORG ATHENS  ] 00001685 002 OF 004 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The large number of migrants entering [LOC Greece  ] also poses risks . 
As an example , in July , [MISC Greek  ] authorities deported [MISC Iraqi  ] citizen [PER Mu’ammar Latif Karim  ] ( a.k.a . 
[PER Abu Sajjad  ] ) , a [LOC Sh’ia  ] insurgent commander , back to [LOC Iraq  ] ( see REF B ) . 
Other reporting indicates that multiple travel facilitators for special interest aliens continue to operate in [LOC Athens  ] . 
A recent operation by [PER DHS/ICE  ] demonstrated that a smuggling organization run by an [MISC Iraqi  ] national could easily smuggle special interest individuals from [LOC Greece  ] to [LOC Central America  ] and then into the [LOC United States.  ] ---------------------------------------- [LOC Greece  ] to [ORG Reform Much-Criticized Asylum Policies  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For the last several years , international organizations and regional and domestic [ORG NGOs  ] have roundly criticized [LOC Greece  ] for its treatment of refugees and its failed asylum processes . 
Human rights organizations ranging from [ORG Amnesty International  ] and Doctors Without Borders ( [ORG MSF  ] ) to the [ORG UN Human Rights Council  ] and [MISC European  ] monitoring bodies have condemned squalid detention centers , a lack of separate facilities for women and unaccompanied minors , and alleged nighttime summary deportations to [LOC Turkey  ] without due process . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] and the [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] ( [ORG IOM  ] ) have criticized Greece’s 0.03 percent first-instance asylum approval rate , the lack of an independent appeals process , and rampant corruption and inefficiencies during application intake . 
Some [MISC European  ] countries have even suspended the return of migrants and asylum seekers to [LOC Greece  ] under the [ORG Dublin II  ] protocol . 
During the last two years , [LOC Sweden  ] , [LOC Norway  ] , and the [LOC Netherlands  ] have intermittently halted returns to [LOC Greece  ] , citing human rights concerns . 
In September 2009 , [ORG UNHCR  ] reiterated its recommendation that [ORG EU  ] member states not return asylum seekers to [LOC Greece.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Greece’s new [LOC PASOK  ] government has committed to addressing many of these concerns , and has moved quickly to revamp asylum processes and take measures that should improve the government’s ability to interdict migrants . 
It has consolidated law enforcement agencies ( the [ORG National Police  ] , fire service , port police , and [ORG Coast Guard  ] elements ) into the new , [ORG DHS-like Ministry  ] for [ORG Citizen’s Protection  ] . 
This should help the government better coordinate among security services on combating illegal migration . 
Fulfilling a [LOC PASOK  ] campaign promise , Minister for [ORG Citizen’s Protection  ] [PER Michalis Chrysochoidis  ] formed an asylum experts’ committee to propose reforms . 
The committee , composed of representatives from [ORG UNHCR  ] , [ORG NGOs  ] , academics , and officials , first met on November 26 . 
NGO and government insiders expect new legislation to take up to six months to formulate , and are looking at stopgap measures to address pending asylum applications . 
[ORG NGOs  ] have largely welcomed the government’s proposals to create a new , independent asylum authority separate from the police , and have lauded promises to raise Greece’s asylum approval rate to the “European average.” However , they note that the situation on the ground hasn’t changed at all , detention centers are still filled beyond capacity , and asylum processing by the [ORG Aliens Police  ] has all but stopped pending new guidelines. ---------------------------------------- [ORG New Migration Policies  ] and “Europeanizing” Enforcement ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The government’s dire fiscal straits may politically [LOC ATHENS  ] 00001685 003 OF 004 hamstring the government’s broader agenda to reshape enforcement and asylum policy , so officials have proposed additional specific migration reforms . 
[LOC PASOK  ] leaders recently reaffirmed their campaign pledge to provide citizenship to children of immigrants , and Minister of Interior [PER Giannis Ragousis  ] told Ambassador [PER Speckhard  ] that the government was considering a new round of amnesties for illegal migrants . 
Officials admitted that it would take time to pass new legislation , but committed to allowing immigrant children born and raised in [LOC Greece  ] to apply for full citizenship . 
( NOTE: [MISC Greek  ] citizenship is difficult to obtain for individuals of non-Greek descent ; citizenship criteria are not revealed to the public . 
END NOTE . 
) Over the last decade , [LOC Greece  ] has had three rounds of amnesties , providing temporary residence permits to large tranches of illegal migrants , and [PER Ragousis  ] said a new amnesty might apply to up to 200,000 immigrants . 
To prevent an amnesty from attracting even more migrants , officials claim border enforcement would be strengthened . 
However , [MISC Greek  ] law enforcement agencies , despite the recent ministerial reorganizations , remain woefully underprepared for large-scale interdiction of smugglers , and investigators and courts lack the expertise and patience to pursue the leaders of the organized criminal networks that profit most. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Because of these domestic shortfalls in migration enforcement , the [MISC Greeks  ] have also focused on “Europeanizing” the issue , using a three-pronged approach: putting pressure on the [ORG EU  ] to provide more border security support , urging [LOC Turkey  ] to crack down on maritime human smuggling and to take back deportees , and pressing for changes to the [ORG Dublin II  ] agreement . 
To raise awareness on migration issues , [LOC Greece  ] hosted the [LOC Global Forum  ] for Migration and Development , an informal conference bringing together governments and [ORG NGOs  ] , in November ( see REF D ) . 
Over the last six months , [MISC Greek  ] leaders have tried multiple tactics to pressure the [MISC EU:  ] signing a four-way enforcement cooperation agreement with [LOC Malta  ] , [LOC Cyprus  ] , and [LOC Italy  ] and jointly submitting an illegal migration whitepaper ; bilateral meetings with [ORG EU  ] border states focusing on enforcement and migration burden-sharing ; raising migration issues at [ORG EU  ] gatherings of foreign and interior ministers ; pressing the [ORG EU  ] to forge readmissions agreements with migration sending countries ; and inviting [ORG FRONTEX  ] , the [ORG EU  ] border agency , to increase its presence in the [ORG Aegean  ] ( see REF C ) . 
[MISC Greek  ] officials have tried to use the [ORG EU  ] to pressure [LOC Turkey  ] to live up to its 2001 bilateral protocol to readmit third-country aliens. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Greeks  ] have been successful at gaining the attention of [ORG EU  ] leaders . 
In July , [ORG EU  ] Justice Commissioner [PER Jacques Barrot  ] noted that uncontrolled immigration risked “destabilizing [MISC Greek  ] democracy” and called on [LOC Turkey  ] to do more to stop migration flows . 
[PER Gil Arias-Fernandez  ] , deputy director of [ORG FRONTEX  ] , stated during an October visit that [LOC Turkey  ] was uncooperative in stanching illegal immigration . 
[ORG FRONTEX  ] has increased the number of air patrols and maritime observers in the [ORG Aegean  ] during the year . 
However , the [MISC Greeks  ] haven’t been able to change the dynamics on the ground . 
[MISC Western European  ] officials have told us there is no chance that the [ORG Dublin II  ] agreement will be revised according to [MISC Greek  ] wishes . 
[PER Papandreou  ] has tried to foster more positive atmospherics with [LOC Turkey  ] and has refrained from harsh criticism on migration . 
In November , [MISC Turkish  ] PM [ORG Recep Tayyip Erdogan  ] sent a letter to [PER Papandreou  ] with an offer to cooperate on migration ; a response is expected soon. ---------------------------------------- COMMENT: Not Just a [MISC Greek  ] Issue , but a [MISC European  ] One ---------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As the migration doorway into [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Greece  ] shoulders a disproportionate burden of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers . 
However , the broader political challenges posed by these waves of migration , especially from conflict zones in the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC South ATHENS  ] 00001685 004 OF 004 [LOC Asia  ] , and [LOC Africa  ] , are applicable to all [MISC European  ] nations . 
Migration is a key crosscutting political , national security , human rights , and socioeconomic phenomenon , and has already had a strong effect on politics throughout [MISC European  ] countries this year--for example , right-wing , anti-immigration parties surged in June 2009 [MISC European  ] Parliament elections . 
In our view integration programs are of crucial importance ; in the aftermath of the economic crisis , immigration and labor policies are under increased scrutiny ; and the EU’s commitment to human rights for refugees and asylum seekers is being tested by the political reality of voters fed up with illegal migration .
