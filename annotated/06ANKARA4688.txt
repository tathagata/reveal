( [LOC C  ] ) The long-standing split between the professional [ORG MFA  ] diplomats and the tight circle of advisers around PM [PER Erdogan  ] has widened noticeably in recent weeks . 
This gap has existed under [PER Erdogan  ] , s [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Development Party  ] ( [ORG AKP  ] ) government , largely because of the close links that both PM [PER Erdogan  ] and FM Gul have with PM adviser [PER Davutoglu  ] , who has been willing to undertake numerous initiatives . 
Until recently , however , such strains have usually been more effectively papered over . 
This internal debate now affects every step the [MISC GOT  ] takes on the international stage . 
2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC Turkish  ] diplomatic corps is highly educated and well attuned to what will sell in the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Europe  ] ; less so on the domestic political front . 
PM [PER Erdogan  ] , s core of [ORG AKP  ] advisers , including [PER Davutoglu  ] and the [ORG AKP  ] vice chairs , understand what will play well with their constituencies . 
Their sense of how policy will play outside of [LOC Ankara  ] is handicapped , however , by their [MISC Turkey-  ] and [MISC Islam-centric  ] vision of how they want the world to operate. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Decoupling [ORG MFA  ] from the PM , s advisers can produce a greater willingness to take chances . 
At the same time , it can also create greater room for misunderstandings or wrongfooted efforts . 
In the run-up to the February 2006 [ORG Hamas  ] visit to [LOC Ankara  ] , for example , [ORG MFA  ] was kept in the dark . 
The AKPers who dealt with the visit did so in a haphazard and uncoordinated manner . 
[ORG MFA  ] , uninformed , was unable to preview it with us . 
The backlash from the [LOC U.S.  ] in particular truly took [ORG AKP  ] aback . 
It took weeks - ) even months - ) before limited understanding dawned on the depth of the displeasure the [ORG Hamas  ] venture had spawned , and why . 
It did not ( and still does not ) fit within their frame of reference. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Most startling , perhaps , to [ORG AKP  ] were those in the [LOC U.S.  ] and elsewhere who , in the aftermath of the [ORG Hamas  ] visit , asked how [ORG AKP  ] would feel if we met with [ORG PKK  ] leaders . 
For [PER Erdogan  ] , s circle , it is not analogous: for them , terrorism equals the [ORG PKK  ] . 
It is difficult for PM [PER Erdogan  ] to believe that his philanthropist [MISC Islamic  ] friend [PER Al Kadi  ] could be involved in terrorist financing , just as it is alien to their frame of reference to view specific [MISC Islamic  ] groups as terrorists . 
[ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] are the result of western policies gone awry , a response from desperate people ) - not truly terrorists . 
Allow them to talk reason to these people , exert [MISC Turkish  ] influence , and the Hamases of the world will change . 
This has been evident in other [MISC Turkish  ] efforts throughout the region as well -- with [LOC Iran  ] ( FM [MISC Mottaki  ] , s visit here ; [PER Erdogan  ] , s talks with [PER Ahmedinejad  ] on the margins of international conferences ) ; with [LOC Syria  ] ( the [LOC Turks  ] believe they were instrumental in getting [LOC Syria  ] , s [ORG Asad  ] to agree to pull troops out of [LOC Lebanon  ] , and to certain aspects of the [PER Hariri  ] investigation ) ; with the current conflict in [LOC Lebanon  ] and the [LOC Gaza  ] strip . 
5 . 
( C/NF ) A more recent example of the PM circle-MFA disconnect involved [PER Davutoglu  ] , s trip to [LOC Damascus  ] the first week of July , where he met not only with [ORG Asad  ] but [PER Misha  ] , al as well . 
The [ORG MFA  ] was cut out and furious ( their Ambassador to [LOC Damascus  ] reportedly cooled his heels outside while [PER Davutoglu  ] met with [ORG Asad  ] ) . 
6 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) As the [MISC Israel-Lebanon  ] crisis intensified , so has this tendency within [PER Erdogan  ] , s small circle . 
[ORG AKP  ] sees own its back to the public opinion wall . 
Instead of exercising leadership , [PER Erdogan  ] -- in populist pre-election mode -- has followed . 
He is playing to [ORG AKP  ] , s constituency ; to those within the party who have never been positively inclined toward [LOC Israel  ] ; and to the greater regional [MISC Sunni  ] audience that he is trying to court . 
Two early results , aimed at these audiences , were ( 1 ) the PM , s participation in the August 3 extraordinary [ORG OIC  ] executive council meetin in [LOC Kuala Lumpur  ] , where he again met with [MISC Irnian  ] president [PER Ahmedinejad  ] and uttered strong anti-Israeli statements ; and ( 2 ) FM Gul , s August 3 op-ed piece in the [ORG Washington Post  ] , which aired [MISC GOT  ] ire in an unhelpful way and blindsided the professional [MISC Turkish  ] diplomats in [LOC Washington  ] . 
7 . 
( C/NF ) Complicit or not ( we believe the former ) , Gul has had his name sullied by a number of these efforts . 
He will have to decide whether to give the [ORG MFA  ] renewed weight - ) [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials could be key in bridging certain delicate issues , particularly [LOC Cyprus  ] , with both the government and the military , for example - ) or go with the PM , s circle .
