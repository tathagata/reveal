( C ) Summary . 
In a volatile political climate leading up to regional/municipal elections in late May , the ruling [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) and far left political allies have ramped up criticism of the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , in part to counteract opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) attacks on the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] 's controversial policies on the [ORG ETA  ] issue . 
The [ORG Madrid Regional PSOE  ] joined the far left " [MISC United Left  ] " ( [ORG IU  ] ) , unions , and pacifist groups staged mass demonstrations against the war on March 17 - though the turnout was lower than for the anti-ETA march . 
On March 20 , high profile magistrate [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] published an editorial in the left leaning " [ORG El Pais  ] " saying that the time had arrived to investigate " criminal responsibility " for the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , to include possible charges against former President [PER Aznar  ] , [PER PM Blair  ] , and President [PER Bush  ] ( Spaniards frequently refer to the " Picture of the [LOC Azores  ] " in 2003 of the three leaders as the moment in which the decision to go to war was made , thus linking [PER Aznar  ] not just with the [MISC Spanish  ] troop deployment , but with full responsibility for the war ) . 
[ORG PSOE  ] Secretary [PER Jose Blanco  ] said in a March 20 television interview that " someone must pay " for the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , and that if someone could demonstrate criminal culpability on the part of political leaders , [PER Blanco  ] said he was " all for it . 
" The Ambassador contacted [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Carles Casajuana  ] on March 21 to convey his deep concern regarding the direction and tenor of [ORG PSOE  ] statements on [LOC Iraq  ] , which could only harm bilateral relations . 
[PER Casajuana  ] discussed the heated political context of the statements and said he expected them to abate soon , but assured the Ambassador that he would convey the Ambassador 's concerns to President [PER Zapatero  ] immediately . 
The DCM is following up with [ORG PSOE  ] Secretary [PER Blanco  ] to insist that the [ORG PSOE  ] avoid dragging the [ORG SIPDIS USG  ] into its domestic conflict with the [ORG PP  ] . 
End summary. //HEATED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the runup to May 27 regional and municipal elections , the political environment in [LOC Spain  ] has become increasingly aggressive . 
The [ORG PP  ] has not gained in most opinion polls , but its criticism of President [PER Zapatero  ] 's controversial policies in the [ORG Basque Region  ] has steadily eroded electoral support for the [ORG PSOE  ] . 
In a show of strength , the [ORG PP  ] led an anti-ETA , anti-Zapatero demonstration on March 10 in [LOC Madrid  ] that drew at least 1 million people . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] stormed back the following week , refocusing public attention on former President [PER Aznar  ] 's unpopular decision to commit [MISC Spanish  ] forces to the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG Madrid Region PSOE  ] , joined by the [ORG PSOE  ] Secretary for International Relations [PER Elena Valenciano  ] , organized a smaller mass rally on March 17 against the [LOC Iraq  ] war and against the [LOC U.S.  ] detention of enemy combatants at [LOC Guantanamo.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG PSOE  ] Parliamentary group joined the fray on March 20 , negotiating a non-binding resolution with the far left [ORG IU  ] that sharply criticized the " illegal " war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The resolution passed with the unanimous support of all parties except the [ORG PP  ] . 
The resolution condemned the " illegal , immoral , and unjust " decision to go to war in [LOC Iraq  ] , for having " destabilized the region , and encouraged jihadist terrorism , which most affects the [MISC Iraqi  ] people themselves . 
" The resolution further states that the war was launched on false pretenses , " as has been recognized by President [PER Bush  ] and Prime Minister [PER Blair...  ] the ( mismanagement ) of the conflict has undermined the credibility of fundamental universal values , in the face of brutal realities at [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] , [LOC Guantanamo  ] , and the execution of [PER Saddam Hussein  ] . 
" ( [ORG NOTE:  ] The [ORG PSOE  ] version of the resolution removed [ORG IU  ] language calling on the [ORG USG  ] to hand over three [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen accused of killing [MISC Spanish  ] TV cameraman [PER Jose Couso  ] . 
END NOTE ) . //GARZON , [ORG PSOE  ] LEADER WEIGH IN// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Judge [PER Garzon  ] published an editorial in the leading daily " [ORG El Pais  ] " on March 20 that lambasted [PER Aznar  ] for declining to " heed [ORG UN  ] inspectors... and instead lending himself , along with a few other leaders , to provide cover and support for this illegal action . 
[PER Garzon  ] went on to suggest that the time had come to study whether " criminal responsibility " should be assigned to [PER Aznar  ] , Prime Minister [PER Blair  ] , and President [PER Bush  ] . 
Spaniards frequently refer to the " Picture of the [LOC Azores  ] " in 2003 of the three leaders as the moment in which the decision to go to war was made , thus linking [PER Aznar  ] not just with the [MISC Spanish  ] troop deployment , but with full responsibility for the war . 
Late on March 20 , a television news crew asked [ORG PSOE  ] Secretary [PER Jose Blanco  ] ( effectively the number two [ORG PSOE  ] leader after [ORG Zapatero  ] ) whether [PER Aznar  ] should be prosecuted for having involved [LOC Spain  ] [ORG MADRID  ] 00000520 002.2 OF 002 in the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Blanco  ] said that " someone must respond in the face of this horror , and if there are reasons and grounds from the legal point of view , then I would be all for it . 
" //AMBASSADOR CALLS PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador contacted [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Carles Casajuana  ] on March 21 to express his concern regarding the increasingly shrill rhetoric on [LOC Iraq  ] on the part of the ruling [ORG Socialist Party  ] and its allies . 
The Ambassador said that the [ORG PSOE  ] was dragging the [ORG USG  ] into [LOC Spain  ] 's domestic political arena , a fact that could only harm bilateral relations . 
The Ambassador said that he was aware of the political context , but that he was running out of patience with unfair Government and [ORG PSOE  ] statements regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Casajuana  ] said that the political environment was " highly polarized " at the moment and blamed the [ORG PP  ] for having stirred the pot on the [ORG ETA  ] issue in an inflammatory manner . 
He acknowledged that the [ORG PSOE  ] had judged that it could counter attack by resurfacing the [LOC Iraq  ] issue and going after [PER Aznar  ] himself , particularly since the timing coincided with the fourth anniversary of the start of the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Casajuana  ] said he understood that the " spillover " of the debate had impacted [ORG USG  ] sensitivities , but said he expected the [LOC Iraq  ] issue to run its course in the next couple of days . 
[PER Casajuana  ] said he would relay the Ambassador 's concerns immediately to President [PER Zapatero  ] , emphasizing the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] 's desire to keep this issue under control . 
The Ambassador asked that President [PER Zapatero  ] act to tamp down the matter and avoid fueling anti-American sentiment as the political campaign continued. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The DCM will follow up with a similar message to other officials and has requested meetings with [ORG PSOE  ] Secretary [PER Blanco  ] and [ORG PSOE International Relations  ] Secretary [PER Elena Valenciano  ] to ask that they leave the [LOC U.S.  ] out of their political campaign .
