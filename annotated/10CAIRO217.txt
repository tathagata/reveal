Blome  ] , Minister-Counselor , State , [LOC ECPO  ] ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
KEY POINTS -- ( U ) The [ORG GOE  ] maintains that [PER NGOs  ] are legally obligated to register with the [ORG Ministry of Social Solidarity  ] ( [ORG MOSS  ] ) . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] law gives the [ORG GOE  ] broad oversight over MOSS-registered [PER NGOs  ] , and the [ORG GOE  ] can dissolve these [PER NGOs  ] for receiving foreign funding without permission , and for other violations. -- ( SBU ) Faced with these restrictions , many [PER NGOs  ] - mostly those focused on sensitive human rights issues - choose not to register with [ORG MOSS  ] , and instead operate as non-profit organizations or under the cover of law firms . 
Some MOSS-registered human rights [PER NGOs  ] have complained about the requirements imposed on them. -- ( U ) According to our information , the [ORG GOE  ] has not moved to close any [PER NGOs  ] since two cases in 2007 and 2008. -- ( C ) According to one human rights lawyer , the [ORG GOE  ] stopped rejecting [MISC NGOs'  ] registration applications in 2008 , believing it is easier to register [PER NGOs  ] and thereby control their activities . 
We are aware of only one pending lawsuit challenging the [ORG GOE  ] 's refusal to register an [ORG NGO  ] , and the [ORG NGO  ] in question is not pressing the case as it does not want to be registered. --------------------------------------------- --------------- Law 84: The [ORG Framework  ] for [ORG NGO Registration  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Law 84 ( 2002 ) sets out requirements for [PER NGOs  ] engaged in non-profit work , and empowers the [ORG Ministry of Social Solidarity  ] ( [ORG MOSS  ] ) to oversee the implementation of these regulations . 
Law 84 requires [PER NGOs  ] ( defined as organizations working on " permissible activities " such as constitutional and legal rights , social defense , human rights and advocacy ) to apply for [ORG MOSS  ] registration , and allows [ORG MOSS  ] to reject applications on the basis of an [ORG NGO  ] conducting " prohibited activities , " including " threatening national unity " and " violating public order or morals . 
" The law requires registered [PER NGOs  ] to receive [ORG MOSS  ] approval to receive domestic and foreign funds , or to send funds abroad . 
Law 84 allows [ORG MOSS  ] to dissolve an [ORG NGO  ] for receiving foreign funding or sending funds abroad without permission , as well as for various other violations . 
Under Law 84 , [ORG MOSS  ] can enter an [ORG NGO  ] 's premises to review its records , and can remove and add personnel on an [ORG NGO  ] 's board of directors. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , an academic specializing in civil society issues , there are currently about 27,800 MOSS-registered [PER NGOs  ] in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] understood that 99 percent of all [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] - registered with [ORG MOSS  ] and unregistered - work on issues unrelated to human rights , such as philanthropy , social services and development . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed the vast majority of [PER NGOs  ] working on issues unrelated to human rights are registered with [ORG MOSS  ] . 
While many human rights [PER NGOs  ] choose not to register with [ORG MOSS  ] because of Law 84 obligations , some [ORG NGOs  ] working on sensitive issues such as prison conditions , interfaith dialogue and political participation are registered with [PER MOSS.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In 2007 , the [ORG GOE  ] shut down the offices of the [ORG Center for Trade Union and Workers Services  ] ( [ORG CTUWS  ] ) in three cities for operating as an [ORG NGO  ] without [ORG MOSS  ] registration . 
[ORG MOSS  ] had rejected CTUWS' registration application . 
In March 2008 , a court ruled that [ORG MOSS  ] should register [ORG CTUWS  ] , and the offices re-opened following a June 2008 [ORG MOSS  ] decree . 
In September 2007 , the [ORG GOE  ] dissolved the [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000217 002 OF 003 MOSS-registered [ORG Arab Human Rights Legal Assistance  ] ( [ORG AHRLA  ] ) [ORG NGO  ] for receiving foreign funds without authorization . 
In October 2008 , a court overturned the [ORG GOE  ] 's decision , and [ORG AHRLA  ] was able to resume its operations. -------------------------------- [ORG Options Outside  ] Law 84 -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Due to the requirements imposed by Law 84 , many [ORG NGOs  ] especially those working on human rights or other sensitive political issues - choose to register with various [ORG GOE  ] entities other than [ORG MOSS  ] . 
Some [ORG NGOs  ] apply for and receive tax-exempt status as " civil companies " from the government tax authority , and then use this status to open a bank account . 
Contacts tell us that [ORG Interior Ministry State Security  ] ( [ORG SSIS  ] ) has sometimes interceded to prevent the tax authority from issuing certain organizations tax-exempt status . 
In addition , contacts say [ORG SSIS  ] has pressured banks not to allow a particular [ORG NGO  ] to use its tax exempt status to open an account. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU ) Other [ORG NGOs  ] operate under the auspices of for-profit law firms registered as " civil companies " under law 17 ( 1983 ) and with the [ORG Bar Syndicate  ] . 
Contacts tell us that [ORG NGOs  ] operating within for-profit law firms do not face official [ORG GOE  ] requirements , but need to negotiate their activities with [ORG Interior Ministry State Security  ] . 
Other [ORG NGOs  ] are registered as " civil companies " with the [ORG Ministry of Trade and Investment  ] ; one contact told us this registration only requires an organization to be non-profit. --------------------------------------------- ----------- Challenging [ORG MOSS Registration Rejections  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Since the passage of law 84 in 2002 , a handful of [ORG NGOs  ] have successfully filed suit to challenge MOSS' rejection of their registration applications , and have eventually gained registration . 
The vast majority of [ORG NGOs  ] that are not registered with [ORG MOSS  ] have chosen not to apply for registration to avoid the restrictions imposed by Law 84 . 
Attorney [PER Negad El-Borai  ] told us that since 2008 , the [ORG GOE  ] has largely stopped denying [ORG MOSS  ] registration to [ORG NGOs  ] , believing it is easier to register [ORG NGOs  ] and control their activities . 
We are aware of one pending suit to challenge a registration rejection . 
[ORG Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights  ] ( [ORG EIPR  ] ) Director [PER Hossam Bahgat  ] told us his organization applied for [ORG MOSS  ] registration in 2004 , and was rejected in 2005 for allegedly violating one of the prohibitions on [ORG NGO  ] activities . 
According to [PER Bahgat  ] , [ORG EIPR  ] subsequently brought a lawsuit against the [ORG GOE  ] , which is still pending in court . 
[PER Bahgat  ] said [ORG EIPR  ] does not want to face the restrictions imposed on a MOSS-registered organization , and is therefore not actively pursuing the lawsuit. --------------------------- The Law [ORG Firm Option  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Since its establishment in 2002 , [ORG EIPR  ] has operated as a civil company registered with the tax authority . 
[ORG EIPR  ] focuses on religious freedom , health , discrimination , and multilateral human rights . 
When [ORG EIPR  ] 's bank sent an October 2009 letter inquiring into its tax-exempt status , [ORG EIPR  ] became worried the [ORG GOE  ] could shut it down , and decided to seek [ORG Bar Syndicate  ] registration as a for-profit law firm . 
[PER Bahgat  ] said he is working with lawyers to establish [ORG EIPR  ] as a law firm to provide cover for its human rights activities . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000217 003 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Director of the [ORG United Group Negad XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has received USG funding for work on torture , corruption , franchising and restrictions on [ORG NGOs  ] . 
As an attorney , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has represented defendants in freedom of expression cases . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that to avoid the " obstacles " of [ORG MOSS  ] registration under law 84 , he does his human rights work under the auspices of his for-profit law firm , which is registered with the [ORG Bar Syndicate  ] and as a civil company under law 17 ( 1983 ) . 
He believed his [ORG Bar Syndicate  ] registration provides " cover " for his human rights work . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he spends 70 percent of his time on commercial work , and 30 percent on human rights cases and projects . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that he still faces obstacles from [ORG Interior Ministry State Security  ] , especially outside [LOC Cairo  ] , but he is usually able to reach an accommodation with them. ----------------------------- [ORG Civil Company Options  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Some activists operating MOSS-registered [ORG NGOs  ] have found law 84 requirements obtrusive , and have subsequently opened civil companies to avoid [ORG GOE  ] restrictions . 
[ORG Activist XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] runs human rights programs from both her MOSS-registered [ORG NGO  ] and an [ORG NGO  ] registered with the [ORG GOE  ] as a " for-profit company . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed that because MOSS-registered [ORG NGOs  ] receive benefits under law 84 such as tax exemptions and discounts on utilities , it is fair for these [ORG NGOs  ] to submit to control by the [ORG GOE  ] . 
She rejected the legitimacy of tax-exempt civil companies operating free of [ORG GOE  ] constraints . 
Her for-profit company pays taxes on the grants it receives , she said , and she considered this 20 percent payment as her " price for freedom . 
" Director of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us she is registered with the [ORG Ministry of Trade  ] as a representative office of the [LOC U.S.  ] organization [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
She did not want to be subject to " difficult " [ORG MOSS  ] restrictions as an [ORG NGO  ] registered under law 84 , and noted that her [ORG Ministry of Trade  ] registration only obligates [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to function as a non-profit organization in [LOC Egypt.  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- Playing by the [ORG Rules: MOSS Registration  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG Activist XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who focuses on freedom of expression and corruption told us he applied for [ORG MOSS  ] registration in January 2005 to " work within the system " for change . 
As a lawyer committed to the rule of law working for human rights advances through legal changes , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed he needs to work within the law . 
XXXXXXXXXXX told us the process was bureaucratic and time-consuming . 
Chair of the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us she registered to " work within the system , " and in response to [ORG GOE  ] promises that the requirements would not be onerous . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed registering was " the worst mistake we could have made , " saying that her [ORG NGO  ] spends " half its time " dealing with [ORG MOSS  ] intrusions and red tape , and that [ORG MOSS  ] routinely delays approving [ORG ECWR  ] 's foreign grants , once for over one year. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The MOSS-registered [ORG Egyptian Organization for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG EOHR  ] ) , one of the country 's oldest and most prominent human rights [ORG NGO  ] , received a letter from [ORG MOSS  ] in April 2009 reminding it of the [ORG GOE  ] 's authority to dissolve [ORG EOHR  ] for receiving unauthorized foreign funding . 
[ORG EOHR  ] had received funds from a [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG NGO  ] for a January 2009 conference on press freedom , and had requested [ORG MOSS  ] approval , but never received a response . 
[ORG MOSS  ] sent [ORG EOHR  ] a letter in May 2009 saying it was not attempting to dissolve the [ORG NGO  ] . 
At the time , [ORG EOHR  ] then-President [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us [ORG EOHR  ] operated as an unregistered organization from 1985 to 2003 , and would be prepared to do so again " if the [ORG GOE  ] shut them down " ( refs B , C , D ) .
