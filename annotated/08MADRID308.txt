Post is seeking clarification on various points . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Treasury  ] Deputy Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] raised in several of his meetings and public appearances in [ORG Madrid  ] March 5-7 ( reftels ) the danger to [MISC Spanish  ] banks of maintaining links with [MISC Iranian  ] banks . 
According to the February edition of [LOC Bankers Almanac  ] , two [MISC Spanish  ] banks , [ORG Santander  ] and [ORG Sabadell  ] , maintained correspondent relationships with [MISC Iranian  ] banks: [ORG Santander  ] with the [ORG Export Development Bank of Iran  ] , [ORG Bank Melli  ] ( cited in [LOC UNSCR  ] 1803 ) , and [ORG Bank Sepah  ] ; and [ORG Sabadell  ] with the [ORG Export Development Bank of Iran and Bank Refah.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) In Deputy Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] 's March 5 meeting with [ORG Bank of Spain  ] ( central bank ) Deputy Governor [PER Jose Vinals  ] ( ref a ) , [PER Vinals  ] promised to have the [LOC Bank  ] 's banking supervision office discuss with [ORG Santander  ] and [ORG Sabadell  ] their relationships with [MISC Iranian  ] banks . 
At a March 6 lunch , the President of [ORG Sabadell  ] confirmed to the Deputy Secretary that the central bank had spoken with his bank that morning . 
On March 7 , the [ORG Bank of Spain  ] provided post with a document summarizing information that [ORG Sabadell  ] and [ORG Santander  ] conveyed to the [ORG Bank of Spain  ] concerning their ties with [MISC Iranian  ] banks. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) This document contains information that is more recent than information post has from other sources , and is fully or almost fully consistent with the earlier information in refs e-f . 
[ORG Santander  ] says it has almost entirely closed down its operations in [LOC Iran  ] , save for an account with [LOC Iran  ] 's central bank ( [ORG Markazi  ] ) and other residual activities . 
Post is pursuing clarification on these residual activities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Bank Sabadell  ] provided the [ORG Bank of Spain  ] extensive detail on its controls and its interactions with [MISC Iranian  ] banks , including correspondent relationships with more banks than those named in [LOC Bankers Almanac  ] , one of which ( [ORG Melli  ] ) was cited in [LOC UNSCR  ] 1803 . 
[ORG Bank Sabadell  ] continues to operate a representative office in [LOC Iran  ] to assist its [MISC Spanish  ] clients in their export/import activities , but with what it says are very stringent controls to guard against interaction with prohibited entities . 
Post is following up to further clarify [ORG Sabadell  ] 's relationships with [MISC Iranian  ] banks. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The informal translation of the [ORG Bank of Spain  ] document follows: INFORMATION COMMUNICATED BY BANK SANTANDER ( TO BANK OF [LOC SPAIN  ] ) 1 ) For 25 years , [ORG Bank Santander  ] has maintained a small Representative Office in [LOC Tehran  ] with three or four employees . 
Currently , the work of the said office is practically null based on the [ORG Santander Group  ] 's decision in the fall of 2007 to sever business relations with [MISC Iranian  ] banks . 
However , the office has not yet been closed , among other reasons because the representative is still helping them ( note: it is not clear who " them " is ) to end the activity in an orderly manner . 
2 ) All the accounts with [MISC Iranian  ] banks , except [ORG Markazi  ] ( the central bank of [LOC Iran  ] ) have been closed . 
The accounts with [ORG Banks Sepah  ] and [ORG Saderat  ] were closed down in April , 2007 , and the rest of the accounts were closed before the end of 2007 . 
In the case of [ORG Bank Sepah  ] , [ORG MADRID  ] 00000000 002.2 OF 004 [ORG Sepah  ] 's funds were frozen , based on [MISC EC Rules  ] 423/2007 of April 19 and 441/2007 of April 20 . 
[ORG SEPBLAC  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG FIU  ] ) and the [ORG Ministry of Economy and Finance  ] , s [ORG Directorate General  ] of the [ORG Treasury  ] were promptly notified of these actions . 
3 ) In the past , ( [ORG Santander  ] ) operations were always entirely commercial in nature and practically all covered by [PER CESCE  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] 's official export credit guarantee company ) . 
Additionally , there were interbank deposits primarily from bank [ORG Markazi  ] with [ORG Santander  ] 's treasury in [ORG Madrid  ] . 
[ORG Santander  ] 's decision taken the last quarter of 2007 was to reduce to zero commercial activity with [LOC Iran  ] , including deposits and any other services . 
The deposits , including those from bank [ORG Markazi  ] , have not been renewed past their expiration dates . 
Operations were always subject to money laundering and terrorism finance prevention procedures . 
Currently , supervision of residual banking activities is being undertaken with extreme care . 
4 ) There are some long-term operations that still exist that were initiated before the decision to cut ties with [MISC Iranian  ] banks were made and that cannot be cancelled . 
5 ) Between August 2006 and April 2007 , [ORG Santander  ] exchanged numerous letters with the [ORG SEC  ] ( [ORG Division of Corporate Finance  ] - Office of [ORG Global Security Risk  ] ) in which [ORG Santander  ] gave detailed information about its representative office and about its activities in [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG SEC  ] initially requested that [ORG Santander  ] 's 20-F include a warning notice about its relationship with certain ( [MISC Iranian  ] ) banks . 
Finally , when [ORG Santander  ] decided to cut relations and shut down the accounts of [ORG Sepah  ] and [ORG Saderat  ] , the [ORG SEC  ] appeared satisfied with this action and it was deemed unnecessary that [ORG Santander  ] include a notice in its 20-F . 
INFORMATION COMMUNICATED BY BANK SABADELL Representative Office in [LOC Iran  ] [ORG Banco Sabadell  ] has a representative office in [LOC Iran  ] , located at [PER Ahmad Ghasir  ] , [PER Bucarest Ave  ] , [LOC Tehran  ] . 
On October 2 , 1998 , [ORG Bank Sabadell  ] applied to [ORG Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran  ] to open the office , and it was approved on November 2 , 1998 . 
The office was officially inaugurated on November 1 , 1999 . 
The mission of the branch is to assist solvent and well- known [MISC Spanish  ] businesses - businesses that are clients from ( [ORG Bank Sabadell  ] 's ) domestic network in [LOC Spain  ] - in their efforts to develop foreign trade with [LOC Iran  ] . 
( following sentence underlined ) A representative office does not undertake any type of banking operations . 
The office develops commercial activities with: - [MISC Spanish  ] businesses with affiliates in [LOC Iran  ] - [MISC Spanish  ] businesses exporting products and/or services to [LOC Iran  ] - [MISC Spanish  ] businesses importing [MISC Iranian  ] products or services - [MISC Spanish  ] businesses without a permanent physical presence in [LOC Iran  ] during their business trips to [LOC Iran  ] The services offered are: - Advising clients on their official credit projects - Assistance with commercial financing - Banking advice related to foreign investment - Local support to [MISC Spanish  ] businesses participating in sectoral or multi-sectoral commercial missions - Monitoring and coordination of business of clients in [LOC Iran  ] Type of Operations Conducted by [ORG Bank Sabadell Based  ] on a very restrictive framework of the operations that any relationship with [LOC Iran  ] can have , [ORG Bank Sabadell  ] has limited its operations to those transactions ( following phrase underlined ) in which at least one of the parties involved is a direct and known client of [ORG Bank Sabadell  ] itself . 
In other words , [ORG Sabadell  ] does not carry out any kind of operation between persons or entities if none of [ORG MADRID  ] 00000000 003.2 OF 004 them are its clients . 
The funds movements the [ORG Bank can  ] carry out consist solely of debiting or crediting the account of a client . 
( following sentence underlined ) This restriction is applied rigorously to the correspondence regime , and [ORG Sabadell  ] rejects payment orders to non-client third parties . 
Of those client activities centered on export and import , the majority ( about 92 percent during 2007 ) ( following phrase underlined ) are import payments for petroleum from a large [MISC Spanish  ] petroleum company . 
Controls The following controls are applied to all operations: 1 ) Comparison of the parties involved in a given operation with the lists of blocked persons and entities . 
The lists used for this purpose are the [ORG OFAC  ] , [ORG UN  ] , and [ORG EU  ] lists , which are periodically updated . 
[ORG Sabadell  ] 's [ORG Compliance Office  ] monitors on a daily basis new measures and legislative actions relating to [LOC Iran  ] at both the national and international ( [LOC United States  ] , [ORG EU  ] , and [ORG UN  ] ) levels . 
Any type of relationship with entities on the abovementioned lists were cancelled whenever they occurred . 
2 ) For each documented operation , a certification is required from the client of the [ORG Bank that  ] is the importer or exporter , in which it is expressly stated that the said merchandise is not subject to any restrictions or limitations , nor on the list of merchandise prohibited by regulations published by the [ORG European Union  ] and other international organizations . 
3 ) Additionally , a new control was recently added and is already in the execution phase: for clients that maintain relationships with [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG Bank Sabadell  ] applies heightened scrutiny and attention with regards to the following areas: ( i ) knowledge about the [ORG Banco Sabadell  ] client ( ii ) knowledge about its [MISC Iranian  ] counterpart , ( iii ) knowledge about the commercial relationship and the destination of any goods that may be exported ; and ( iv ) knowledge by our client is aware of the applicable norms related to commercial operations with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Periodically , [ORG Bank Sabadell  ] conducts a follow-up on clients that have had operations with [LOC Iran  ] for an amount greater than 15,000 euros ( annually ) and ensures that these clients have been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny discussed in the paragraph above . 
4 ) The [ORG SIOPEIA  ] anti-money laundering system of investigating suspicious operations also provides a greater penalty for all those operations in which an [MISC Iranian  ] person or entity ( national or resident ) may be involved . 
All these measures are subjected to constant review to update them in compliance with new developments or new legislative measures .
