( C ) SUMMARY: [PER PolOff  ] visited [LOC Dharamsala  ] February 3-7 to meet a cross section of the [MISC Tibetan  ] community upon the conclusion of the ninth round of dialogue in [LOC Beijing  ] between the [MISC Tibetan  ] government-in-exile , known as the [ORG Central Tibetan Administration  ] ( [ORG CTA  ] ) , and [MISC Chinese  ] officials . 
During meetings with members of CTA’s Parliament , the [MISC NGO  ] community , journalists and activists , [PER Poloff  ] detected growing [MISC Tibetan  ] frustrations over the lack of progress through the dialogue and with the [ORG Middle Way  ] approach . 
Many interlocutors pointed to the widely-anticipated meeting between the [PER Dalai Lama  ] and President [PER Barack Obama  ] with excitement but also expected few , if any , tangible outcomes . 
They argued that the international community , particularly the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC India  ] , needs to engage more on the [MISC Tibetan  ] movement to curb rising frustration after over 50 years in exile . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC TIBET  ] TALKS: POSITIVE SIGNS , OR EXERCISES IN FUTILITY ? ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER PolOff  ] visited [LOC Dharamsala  ] to gauge the [MISC Tibetan  ] community’s reaction to outcomes from the ninth round of dialogue between the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] special emissaries and the [MISC Chinese  ] government , held Jan 26-31 in [LOC Beijing  ] . 
Interlocutors expressed mild hope mixed with intense concern for the future of the [MISC Tibetan  ] movement . 
The emergence of this dialogue in 2002 was taken as a positive sign by [ORG NGOs  ] , such as the [ORG Tibetan Women  ] , s [ORG Association ( TWA )  ] , which works with the [ORG CTA  ] government . 
Most interlocutors argued that the talks , though producing no substantive change in relations between [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Tibetan  ] officials , convey to those residing in [LOC Tibet  ] that ‘’something is happening.’’ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Tibetan  ] envoy [PER Lodi Gyari’s  ] February 2 statement pointed out that the [MISC Chinese  ] delegation provided a detailed briefing on results of the January 18-20 Fifth [LOC Tibet  ] Work Forum , an internal [MISC Chinese  ] government-run discussion of [LOC China  ] , s [LOC Tibet  ] policy . 
[LOC Gyari  ] noted that many of the issues the Forum prioritized ( such as the focus on rural livelihood development projects and [LOC China  ] , s shift in verbiage from the ‘’Tibet Autonomous Region’’ to the geographically-larger ‘’greater Tibet’’ ) are also mentioned in the [LOC Memorandum  ] on Genuine Autonomy for All [MISC Tibetans  ] , a document submitted by the envoys during the eighth round of the dialogue in 2008 and resubmitted during the latest round. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Yet prominent members of the [ORG CTA  ] , including Speaker of Parliament [PER Penpa Tsering  ] and Minister of the [ORG Department of Information and International Relations  ] Kesang [PER Takla  ] , expressed frustration to [PER PolOff  ] with what they termed as the ‘’arrogant’’ display by the [MISC Chinese  ] officials who listed the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] return to [LOC Tibet  ] as the sole issue on the dialogue’s agenda . 
[MISC Tibetan  ] envoys attempted , but were unsuccessful , in pushing substantive discussion on guidelines within [LOC Tibet  ] that would precipitate the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] return to [LOC Tibet  ] , namely a guarantee of the autonomy of the rights and welfare needs of the [MISC Tibetan  ] people , as stated in the [LOC Memorandum  ] . 
[LOC Takla  ] argued that China’s recent economic boom has negatively impacted the international community’s ability to pressure the regime on its human rights record. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Deputy Speaker of Parliament [PER Gyari Dolma  ] highlighted to [PER PolOff  ] four key human rights issues that [ORG CTA  ] would like resolved in [LOC Tibet  ] . 
First , [MISC Chinese  ] accusations that the [PER Dalai Lama  ] is engaging in separatism must stop . 
[PER Dolma  ] contended such accusations cause [MISC Tibetans  ] to lose confidence in the [MISC Chinese  ] delegation , which ought to bring ‘’real’’ issues to the talk . 
Second , [LOC China  ] must allow [MISC Tibetans  ] living in [LOC China  ] to freely meet the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , so that he understands their thinking ( [PER NOTE: Dolma  ] mentioned that [ORG CTA  ] currently has little access to the opinions of those living in [LOC Tibet  ] due to [MISC Chinese  ] controls on telecommunications and the media censorship ; most of their information comes from refugees . 
END NOTE ) ; [LOC China  ] should also allow a delegation from [ORG Parliament  ] to visit [LOC Tibet  ] with neutral observers ( i.e. , from the [ORG UN  ] , [ORG US Embassy  ] in [LOC Beijing  ] , the media , or other impartial organizations ) and guarantee the safety of those who speak with observers as NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000290 002 OF 004 they examine the internal situation and make recommendations for solving the [MISC Tibetan  ] issue . 
Third , [LOC China  ] should allow [ORG Amnesty International  ] or another credible human rights organization access to the Tibetan-recognized [PER Panchen Lama  ] , who has been missing from the public eye since shortly after being named the [PER Panchen Lama  ] by the [PER Dalai Lama  ] in 1995 . 
Finally , on the issue of both political prisoners and prisoners in general , [LOC China  ] should allow greater transparency of its judicial processes ( [PER NOTE: Dolma  ] contends that [MISC Tibetans  ] receive no legal representation and have no clear trial dates , making it very difficult to monitor trial outcomes . 
She noted a recent positive change on this issue stemming from international pressure on China’s ‘’punishment to death’’ sentence , stating that now the [MISC Chinese  ] government follows clear procedures to officially record trials in the law book , with only the [ORG High Court  ] , upon review of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , holding the power to deliver a death sentence , which has reduced the number of executions imposed . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested to [PER PolOff  ] that [MISC Tibetans  ] have little hope for the dialogue as it currently exists , stating that talks are ‘’still at the zero point.’’ He suggested two reforms to the dialogue process . 
First , [MISC Tibetans  ] with [MISC Mandarin  ] language skills should be included in the delegation along with neutral observers to record the discussion between both sides . 
Second , the location for talks should alternate within and outside [LOC China  ] ( [PER NOTE: Even  ] when discussions were held in [LOC Geneva  ] , both sides met at the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
END NOTE ) . 
Both [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that ‘’hope is always there’’ amongst the [MISC Tibetan  ] exile community . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that as [MISC Tibetans  ] become more adept in using the [MISC Internet  ] , they must use their own hopes to inspire activism over the [MISC Tibetan  ] movement within [LOC Tibet  ] and the international community at large . 
A MILITANT SHANGRILA ? ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Although [MISC Western  ] journalists often ask who the face of the [MISC Tibetan  ] movement would be after the [PER Dalai Lama  ] passes away , [MISC Tibetans  ] seemed remarkably unconcerned because they see a clear succession path . 
Speaker [PER Tsering  ] noted to [PER PolOff  ] that the democratically-elected [PER Kalon Tripa  ] ( Prime Minister ) of CTA’s [ORG Parliament  ] would serve as a figurehead for the movement while officials search for the reincarnated 15th [PER Dalai Lama  ] . 
[ORG CTA  ] , s [ORG Charter  ] also provides for the election of a three-person regency to be chosen by members of [ORG Parliament  ] in the event of the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] death or inability to take political charge of [ORG Parliament  ] . 
( [PER Note:  ] The [MISC Dalai Lama  ] continues to sit in [ORG Parliament  ] meetings , despite statements that he is a spiritual , not political , leader of the [MISC Tibetans  ] . 
END NOTE ) . 
Tsering contends that , depending on the strength of the three members of the regency , this body could also serve as the voice of the [MISC Tibetan  ] movement . 
The issue that interlocutors disagreed on was the future actions of [MISC Tibetans  ] when faced with a movement no longer headed by the [PER Dalai Lama.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PolOff’s discussions with most interlocutors gravitated towards mention of the March 2008 uprising in [LOC Tibet  ] , noting , as representatives from [ORG TWA  ] did , that it projected a united [MISC Tibetan  ] front against [MISC Chinese  ] rule to the world . 
All remarked that conditions inside [LOC Tibet  ] have gone from bad to worse in recent years . 
Deputy Speaker [PER Dolma  ] noted that faith in the [MISC Dalai Lama’s  ] leadership had led many [MISC Tibetans  ] to believe in the [LOC Middle Way  ] , yet there is a growing skepticism of this approach . 
[PER Dolma  ] said that many view the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] and [ORG CTA  ] , s demand for autonomy within , and not total independence from , [LOC China  ] as too great a compromise. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed out that protestors in both the 1997 and 2008 uprisings within [LOC Tibet  ] were typically young , had never lived in exile , and - most importantly - had never met the [PER Dalai Lama  ] . 
( [PER NOTE: Interestingly  ] , according to statistics obtained from the [ORG Dharamsala Refugee Reception Center  ] , of the 87,096 refugees that were taken in by Center from 1980 to November 2009 , over half - NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000290 003 OF 004 46,620 people - returned to [LOC Tibet  ] after a short pilgrimage in [LOC India  ] and audience with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] . 
END NOTE ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] affirmed to [PER PolOff  ] that the presence of the [PER Dalai Lama  ] has provided the [MISC Tibetan  ] community at large with peace while soothing unrest among the [MISC Tibetan  ] youth . 
[ORG TYC  ] is the [MISC Tibetan  ] community-in-exile’s largest NGO , comprising members whose primary aim is achieving an independent , not merely an autonomous , [LOC Tibet.  ] ‘’Tibetans would rise up if the time comes , ’’ stated [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , while noting that the large assemblies of [MISC Tibetan  ] youth , outside of audiences with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , gather together when the [ORG TYC  ] discusses independence . 
Minister [PER Takla  ] also bluntly informed [PER PolOff  ] that if the international community fails to adequately support the [MISC Tibetan  ] people in their struggle against [LOC China  ] , people residing inside [LOC Tibet  ] could become desperate enough to desert the [MISC Tibetan  ] movement , s historically non-violent path . 
[PER Takia  ] said that ‘’we in the free world would be responsible for the resulting violence’’ and all would fail as human rights authorities should [MISC Tibetans  ] become militant. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In this context , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted approximately 6,000 [MISC Tibetans  ] now serve , and over 30,000 [MISC Tibetans  ] have been trained , in [ORG Establishment  ] 22 , a joint [MISC Tibetan-Nepali  ] border force within the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Army  ] that reportedly emerged in 1962 following a failed [MISC Tibetan  ] uprising in [LOC China  ] . 
Membership in [ORG Establishment  ] 22 was compulsory for [MISC Tibetan  ] students graduating from [MISC Tibetan Children  ] , s [ORG Village  ] ( [ORG TCV  ] ) schools until the late 1980s , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [MISC Tibetans  ] have never been given an opportunity to fight the [MISC Chinese  ] , despite begging for the opportunity ; they fought in the [MISC Indo-Pakistan War  ] of 1971 that created [LOC Bangladesh  ] and in [MISC Operation Meghdoot  ] during the 1999 [MISC Indo-Pakistan  ] fighting in [LOC Kargil  ] . 
THE AUDACITY OF HOPE ----- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The widely-anticipated meeting between the [PER Dalai Lama  ] and President [PER Obama  ] in [LOC Washington  ] was a frequent topic of conversation among [LOC Dharamsala  ] residents . 
There appeared to be reasonable consensus that the [PER Dalai Lama  ] is not traveling to the [LOC US  ] with a specific agenda for this meeting . 
[PER Dolma  ] noted that this will be a meeting between fellow [MISC Nobel Laureates  ] who believe in non-violence , stating that the ‘’U.S. government already knows our need , ’’ and the [PER Dalai Lama  ] understands that there is no need to pressure or embarrass the President into action . 
Minister [PER Takla  ] , noting President [PER Obama’s  ] recent stronger statements about [MISC China’s  ] trade practices , articulated that there is already international awareness about [LOC Tibet  ] - ‘’everyone knows that [MISC Tibetans  ] and the [PER Dalai Lama  ] want genuine autonomy for [MISC Tibetans  ] in [MISC Tibet’’  ] - but the question now is how do we put this desire into action and pressure [LOC China  ] to act on the dialogue ? 
[PER Takla  ] believed that failing to hold a meeting between President [PER Obama  ] and the [PER Dalai Lama  ] would ‘’increase [LOC China  ] , s arrogance , ’’ while [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted [MISC China’s  ] pressures on the [LOC United States  ] and the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , stressing that the latter faced possible threats of executions of political prisoners in [LOC Tibet  ] should the meeting proceed. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Dolma  ] and [PER Takla  ] both argued that other members of the international community , particularly [LOC India  ] , must take a more proactive role on the [LOC Tibet  ] issue . 
[PER Takla  ] stated that [LOC Tibet  ] has historically served as a peaceful buffer zone between [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] , noting that [LOC India  ] now has to spend large amount of money on defense and be wary of [MISC Chinese  ] activities that may adversely affect rivers flowing downstream into [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Dolma  ] commented that [LOC India  ] and [ORG CTA  ] are natural allies , noting that Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] has a clear understanding of the [MISC Tibetan  ] problem , and now appreciates the [LOC Middle Way  ] approach , versus the opinion intimated through many of the government’s earlier statements to ‘’go back or get independence already.’’ COMMENT: FRUSTRATION LIKELY TO GROW ABSENT ANY REAL PROGRESS IN DIALOGUE ----- NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000290 004 OF 004 <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Growing frustration among [MISC Tibetans  ] , displayed during the March 2008 uprising , is likely to lead to future outbursts so long as the dialogue fails to progress . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] government , s international credibility on human rights will continue to decline as [MISC Tibetans  ] gain further access to media tools to disseminate this growing frustration . 
Their frustration’s effect on the [MISC Tibetan  ] movement could be exacerbated by the passage of time , as the [MISC Dalai Lama’s  ] increasing age inevitably slows down his grueling travel schedule and his potential ability to continue to capture the world’s attention on his people’s plight .
