End Summary . 
WHALING DEAL IS NO DEAL ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Garrett  ] told Ambassador [PER Bleich  ] he appreciated the " robust " exchange between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Australia  ] on whaling and felt he could speak frankly . 
In [PER Garrett  ] 's view , the current agreement being negotiated in the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) and its associated small groups would , in the end , be unacceptable to the [MISC Australian  ] government as it fell short in several areas . 
[PER Garrett  ] said the negotiating process had largely ground to a halt , with no " real " proposals on the table . 
He said legislation pending in the [MISC Australian  ] parliament ( introduced by the [ORG Green Party  ] on February 4 to examine the role of " spy flights " in [LOC Japan  ] 's planning for this year 's whaling season ) would strengthen anti-whaling sentiment in [LOC Australia  ] , making it difficult for the government to accept the current proposals . 
[PER Garrett  ] said the February 22 [ORG IWC  ] Small Working Group briefings , which will alert the NGO and global community to the state of discussions , will be key for [LOC Australia  ] 's policy on the negotiations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) In separate discussions on February 5 , [ORG GOA  ] officials confirmed significant concerns with the whaling negotiations but stopped short of [PER Garrett  ] 's complete rejection . 
PM Rudd 's [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor Scott Dewar  ] confirmed that there had not yet been any cabinet decision on whether to continue to work for a deal in the [ORG IWC  ] . 
At the same time , he told [MISC Pol-Econ  ] Counselor that the current notional deal ( on which there is no agreement in the [ORG IWC  ] ) is impossible to accept in the current political environment . 
[ORG DFAT  ] 's [PER Paula Watt  ] said that entreaties to [PER Garrett  ] and his [ORG DEWHA  ] staff that the deal is a necessary step to reforming the [ORG IWC  ] have " bounced off " [PER Garrett  ] and other negotiators . 
[PER Watt  ] said that the most likely chance for a cabinet meeting is on February 15 , and that strong messages before that date may be needed to shore up support for a deal . 
[PER Watt  ] further indicated that the current assessment is that [MISC Japanese  ] FM [PER Okada  ] 's visit will be too close to the February 22 NGO briefings to present any opportunity to get further with the [LOC GOJ.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Garrett Chief  ] of Staff [PER David Williams  ] told econoff that the [ORG GOA  ] could accept a compromise that delivers a much [MISC Qthat  ] the [ORG GOA  ] could accept a compromise that delivers a much lower level of whaling , but it has to be accompanied by signals of commitment to address other key issues - sustaining the commercial moratorium , keeping whaling out of the southern sanctuary areas and [MISC Australian  ] antarctic waters , bringing all whaling under the control of the [ORG IWC  ] , and preventing future scientific whaling . 
Absent any signals on these areas , [PER Garrett  ] and other political leaders will be under consistent attack on a deal that only addresses numbers , however low . 
[PER Williams  ] was careful to say that [LOC Australia  ] would not act precipitously and would signal its intentions clearly . 
[MISC Pol-Econ  ] Counselor and Econoff both echoed Commissioner [LOC Medina  ] 's message ( ref email ) on the importance of staying at the table to [ORG Dewar  ] , [PER Williams  ] and [PER Watt  ] . 
[MISC CORAL TRIANGLE INITIATIVE  ] [LOC CANBERRA  ] 00000093 002 OF 002 ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Garrett  ] said that as the two major donors in the [MISC Coral Triangle Initiative  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Australia  ] should work more closely on coordinating efforts to ensure effective outcomes . 
He noted that [MISC Indonesian  ] President [PER Yudhoyono  ] had been a driving force behind the [ORG CTI  ] , and was hosting the [ORG CTI  ] secretariat in [LOC Indonesia  ] . 
[PER Garrett  ] said the challenge for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Australia  ] is to ensure participating countries understand that outcomes need to be regional , not national . 
He pointed to the secretariat 's use of national action plans instead of a regional plan as a concern , and said he sought further discussions with NOAA Administrator [PER Lubchenco  ] on the [ORG CTI  ] . 
[PER Garrett  ] felt a strong signal could be sent on these issues during the President 's planned visit to [LOC Indonesia  ] in March . 
[LOC ANTARCTICA  ] ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On [LOC Antarctica  ] , [PER Garrett  ] felt the success of the 2009 [MISC International Polar Year  ] events highlighted the importance of the region in environmental and climate terms . 
[PER Garrett  ] pointed to the availability of air transport from [LOC Australia  ] in only four hours ( compared to eight hours for [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft based in [LOC New Zealand  ] ) as a strong incentive to travel there , and suggested senior [ORG USG  ] officials interested in traveling in [LOC Antarctica  ] could use [LOC Australia  ] as a base vice the existing infrastructure in [LOC New Zealand  ] . 
The Ambassador noted his personal interest in [ORG Antarctic  ] exploration and the interest of senior officials , including the Secretary and Speaker of the [ORG House  ] in traveling to the polar region . 
[PER Garrett  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for participating in the [LOC Southern Ocean Research Program  ] and hoped to hear more from the [LOC U.S.  ] on its participation this year , including possible funding for projects under the partnership. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Garrett  ] seemed eager to establish a good relationship with the Ambassador but was less relaxed in this meeting than we have seen him in the past . 
While he was consistent with his positions on whaling , [ORG CTI  ] and other conservation issues , he appeared less willing to push hard on those issues than in previous discussions both here and in [LOC Washington  ] .
