<code><pre>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 [LOC LONDON  ] 001176 SIPDIS SENSITIVE SIPDIS EO 12958 N/A TAGS EAID , EAGR , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC UK  ] SUBJECT: [LOC UK  ] FOOD SUMMIT HIGHLIGHTS PM BROWN’S CONCERN <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: At an April 22 , PM Brown-hosted meeting to address increases in food prices , participants disagreed about future trends and the impact of biofuels , agreed that action needed to be taken both for immediate social protection and longer-term agricultural investment , and that care should be taken not to talk up a “crisis.” The [LOC UK  ] press release following the meeting included a broad range of proposed actions that the [LOC UK  ] plans to pursue both domestically and internationally , ranging from increased assistance to a [ORG WTO  ] trade deal and improved [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG IMF  ] effectiveness . 
[ORG DFID  ] also announced a new GBP 455 million ( $910 million ) five-year assistance package . 
In DFID’s view , the current crisis is being caused by high and rising food prices , not a shortage of food . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On April 22 , PM [PER Brown  ] hosted a one and a half hour meeting to discuss ways the international community could respond to the growing global food price crisis . 
[ORG Overseas Development Institute  ] ( [ORG ODI  ] ) Director [PER Simon Maxwell  ] , who was called on to set the stage at the meeting , told us he was surprised that the meeting , which was originally intended to be a small private event , was publicized and expanded to include more international players . 
Participants included [LOC UK  ] government ministers , international organizations such [PER Josette Sheeran  ] from the [ORG World Food Program  ] , business , academics and others . 
For the full list , see paragraph 16. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PM [PER Brown  ] opened the meeting , introducing the list of action areas he had asked the [MISC Japanese  ] Prime Minister to put on the [MISC G8  ] agenda , including short tern measures to deal with immediate hardship and long term structural measures as outlined in paragraph 13 . 
( see also www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page15321.asp ) . 
[ORG UK Development  ] Secretary [PER Douglas Alexander  ] concluded the meeting by SIPDIS emphasizing the need for the international architecture to keep up . 
He noted that this had been a key theme at the [ORG World Bank Development Committee  ] in [LOC Washington  ] earlier in April . 
He also expressed surprise there had not been more discussion about concluding a [ORG WTO  ] trade deal as a means to address food price concerns . 
Food Prices and Biofuels ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Participants disagreed about likely food price trends and the impact of biofuels . 
[ORG UK Environment  ] Secretary [PER Hilary Benn  ] noted that the futures market for wheat showed the price falling more than 25 percent from current levels by next year . 
Cargill’s [PER Ruth Rawling  ] predicted that wheat prices would come down quite quickly , noting that there is a harvest somewhere on the planet every sixty days , except for rice . 
[ORG ODI  ] estimated that prices would fall back from their current peak to roughly what they had been in the early 1990s . 
( See ODI’s discussion paper on the topic at http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/briefing/ bp37-april08-rising-food-prices.pdf ) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the other hand , [PER Stefan Tangermann  ] from the [ORG OECD Trade & Agriculture Directorate  ] said their modeling showed maize prices for the next ten years would be 60 percent higher than during the past decade and that half of this increase was due to biofuels . 
[PER Joachim Von Braun  ] , Director General , [ORG Inter Food Policy Institute Research  ] ( [ORG IFPRI  ] ) suggested a moratorium on maize for biofuels . 
Their modeling showed it would reduce maize prices by 20 percent immediately and wheat prices by 10 percent , with further reductions because it would discourage speculation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Others defended biofuels . 
[PER Benn  ] wanted to see hard facts and analysis on biofuels . 
[PER Mike Bushell  ] , from agri-business company [ORG Syngenta  ] , argued against demonizing biofuels . 
[PER Rawling  ] argued against rigid mandates and in favor of buy-out clauses for biofuels . 
She also noted that flexibility is essential since biofuel targets are fixed in terms of fuel markets not food markets , and 2.5 percent of the fuel market can represent as much as 20 percent of a food market . 
Causes and Remedies ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Maxwell  ] told us the headline messages about social protection in the short run and agricultural investment in the long run were clear to the participants , but everything else about causes and remedies was contested . 
[PER Paul Collier  ] , [ORG Oxford University  ] , argued that the main cause was growth in [LOC China  ] , which no one wants to reduce . 
He also pointed to “follies” that he wanted to undo , specifically [LOC U.S.  ] biofuels subsidies , and the [ORG EU  ] refusal to accept genetically modified [LOC LONDON  ] 00001176 002 OF 004 crops . 
[PER Collier  ] wanted to see large-scale farming in [LOC Africa  ] along the lines of the [MISC Brazilian  ] model . 
( For details , see Collier’s April 15 article in the [ORG Times: Food Shortages: Think Big.  ] www.timesonline.co.uk ) On April 24 , [PER Malcolm Bruce  ] , [ORG MP  ] and chairman of [ORG Parliament’s International Development Committee  ] ( [ORG IDC  ] ) , speaking at an [ORG IDC  ] evidence session dismissed Collier’s suggestion that [MISC African  ] countries adopt the [MISC Brazilian  ] model as a “professorial point of view , not a politician’s.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the meeting , [PER Maxwell  ] stressed that the crisis had macro-economic as well as humanitarian dimensions . 
Low [ORG Income Food Deficit  ] countries face import bills some $20bn higher this year , and food price increases are resulting in double-digit inflation in many countries . 
[PER Donald Kaberuka  ] , President , [ORG African Development Bank  ] , also focused on macroeconomic impacts , as governments could respond to higher prices by increasing subsidies and wages , which would lead to higher budget deficits. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Josette Sheeran  ] , [ORG World Food Program  ] ( [ORG WFP  ] ) director , made a case for the importance of the humanitarian case load . 
She said the additional cost of maintaining [ORG WFP  ] , s operations this year has now risen to $700 million , compared to $500 million in February . 
( [ORG WFP  ] has had to pay up to $1000 per ton for rice ) . 
She raised concerns about low planting in poor countries , constrained in part by high input costs ( e.g. planting in [LOC Kenya  ] is one third down ) . 
She also said [ORG WFP  ] is transitioning from being an agency that deals only with food aid logistics to one that addresses the broader causes and remedies to address hunger itself , a project which is slowly gathering donor support . 
[PER Jacques Diouf  ] , [ORG UN Food and Agriculture Organization  ] , talked about the Food Summit he is convening from 3-5 June in [LOC Rome  ] . 
He said the priority was the current growing season , and endorsed [PER Sheeran  ] , s points about the negative impact of high fertilizer and seed prices. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several participants focused on the need for immediate social protection for those in need . 
[PER Phil Bloomer  ] from [ORG Oxfam  ] argued against food subsidies for and in favor of targeted social protection for those in need . 
[PER David Mepham  ] from [ORG Save the Children  ] talked about the need to scale up existing social protection programs ( e.g [LOC Ethiopia  ] ) , but noted that there are countries where the issue is building programs rather than scaling them up . 
[PER Bruce  ] was also concerned that small farmers would buy more inputs because food prices were high , and then be unable to cover these costs if prices fell . 
He wanted to see some kind of insurance to prevent this outcome. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kaberuka  ] said the regional development banks were working on a harmonized approach to support agriculture . 
Speaking in a Parliamentary committee meeting on April 24 , [ORG DFID  ] Parliamentary Secretary of State [PER Gillian Merron  ] outlined [ORG DFID  ] views on the [ORG African Development Bank’s  ] role to address the food crisis . 
She praised Kaberuka’s participation in the summit , noting that it showed a willingness to adapt the AfDB’s role to fit the situation . 
She stressed that the [ORG AfDB  ] is not set up to lend directly to farmers , nor should it be , but there is the potential for [ORG AfDB  ] to play a role in agricultural infrastructure projects . 
She said [ORG DFID  ] would work with [ORG AfDB  ] toward this goal . 
Messaging --------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Maxwell  ] urged participants to get the messaging right , so as not to talk up a crisis , and instead present this as a manageable problem with short and long term solutions , with implications for the international system . 
Tangerman endorsed the point about messaging and said there was a danger of talking up the bubble . 
He pointed to recent unhelpful remarks from [ORG IMF Managing  ] Director , [PER Dominique Strauss-Kahn  ] , about prices going even higher . 
[ORG UK Food Crisis Announcement  ] --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) A [LOC UK  ] statement -- apparently not coordinated with the other participants -- following the meeting said it had addressed the short and longer-term factors causing increased food prices at home and abroad and possible policy solutions . 
It noted the following issues were discussed at the meeting: -- We will work in the [ORG G8  ] for an international strategy . 
An international strategy will need to include: more and better support for agricultural and rural development in the poorest countries ; more and better research into methods for increasing yields and productivity ; a review of the wider economic and environmental impacts of biofuel production ; [LOC LONDON  ] 00001176 003 OF 004 commitment to increase social protection programs which take people out of long-term dependency on food aid ; consideration on how to maximize the effectiveness of [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] support ; and reform of relevant international institutions . 
-- We will increase support to the poorest . 
In addition to the [MISC GBP  ] 50 million per year we already spend on social protection and safety net programs in [LOC Africa  ] , the [LOC UK  ] has today pledged an extra [MISC GBP  ] 30 million to support the [ORG World Food Program  ] , and extra [MISC GBP  ] 25 million to [LOC Ethiopia  ] for their national safety net program . 
We will work to encourage other donors to make additional humanitarian assistance available and monitor the need to step up support . 
-- We will work together to address domestic price rises . 
The Government has called on consumer groups , food producers , manufacturers and retailers to consider how we can collectively meet the challenges posed by the global food crisis . 
-- We will increase research into improving yields . 
The [LOC UK  ] has today announced new funds for agricultural research over the next five years . 
This will be critical if agricultural production is to keep pace with increased demands for food . 
-- We will work to achieve a successful [ORG WTO  ] deal , including a substantial ‘aid for trade’ package to help build the trading capacity of the poorest countries . 
The [ORG WTO  ] round offers a major opportunity to increase trade flows in agricultural ( and other ) goods , particularly for developing countries . 
We want a [ORG WTO  ] deal which reduces significantly reduces agricultural tariffs and trade distorting subsidies . 
High transport costs also push up local food prices and restrict trade in [LOC Africa  ] . 
-- We will work within the [ORG EU  ] to further reform the [MISC EU’s Common Agricultural Policy  ] ( [ORG CAP  ] ) , through the [ORG CAP Health  ] check and the [ORG EU  ] budget review . 
It is estimated that the [ORG CAP  ] costs [LOC UK  ] consumers [MISC GBP  ] 3.5 billion ( 2005 ) through higher prices . 
Reductions in [ORG EU  ] agricultural tariffs and [ORG CAP  ] reform would reduce the cost of food to [ORG EU  ] consumers and increase the capacity of developing countries to produce and export agricultural commodities . 
-- We will review our approach to biofuels . 
We need to look closely at the impact on food prices and the environment of different production methods and to ensure we are more selective in our support . 
If our [LOC UK  ] review shows that we need to change our approach , we will also push for change in [ORG EU  ] biofuels targets . 
[ORG DFID Assistance  ] --------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) Also on April 22 , [ORG DFID  ] announced a [MISC GBP  ] 455 million ( $910 million ) five-year aid package to address rising global food prices . 
The package is designed to address both short term needs and long term solutions . 
The [LOC UK  ] aid package includes: $60 million in support of recent appeals by the [ORG World Food Programme  ] for countries most at risk ; $800 million ( [MISC GBP  ] 400 million ) over five years devoted to agricultural research , that will double DFID’s current spend and help poor countries grow more food for themselves ; and $50 million ( [MISC GBP  ] 25 million ) this year to boost the incomes of the poorest people in [LOC Ethiopia.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) In DFID’s view , the current crisis is being caused by high and rising food prices , not a shortage of food . 
The solution is to improve access to food for poor people . 
Prices are rising because of increasing demand for food due to population growth , and increasing oil prices and their impact on the cost of food production , processing and distribution. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) Participants at the April 22 event were: Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] ; [PER Rt Hon Douglas Alexander MP  ] , Secretary of State for [ORG International Development  ] ; [PER Rt Hon Alistair Darling  ] , [ORG Chancellor of the Exchequer  ] , [PER Rt Hon  ] [PER Hilary Benn MP  ] , Secretary of State for Environment , Food and [ORG Rural Affairs  ] ; [ORG SIPDIS Rt  ] Hon [PER Malcolm Bruce MP  ] , Chairman , [ORG International Development Committee  ] ; Prof [PER John Beddington Chief Scientist  ] ; [PER Phil Bloomer  ] , [ORG Oxfam  ] ; Dr [PER Mike Bushell  ] , [ORG Syngenta  ] ; [PER Paul Collier  ] , [ORG Oxford University  ] ; Professor [PER Ian Crute  ] , [ORG Rothamsted Research Institute  ] ; [PER Jaqcues Diouf  ] , Food and Agricultural Organisation , [ORG UN  ] ; [PER Andrew Dorward  ] , School of [ORG Oriental and African Studies  ] ; [PER Lawrence Haddad  ] , [ORG Institute of Development Studies  ] ; [PER Paul Hodson  ] , [ORG European Commission Transport & Energy  ] ; [PER Donald Kaberuka  ] , [ORG African Development Bank  ] ; [PER Reijo Kemppinen  ] , [ORG Head of Mission  ] , [ORG EC Rep  ] of the [LOC UK  ] ; [PER Peter Kendall  ] , [ORG National Farmers Union  ] ; [PER Justin King  ] , [ORG Sainsbury’s  ] ; [PER Simon Maxwell  ] , [ORG Overseas LONDON  ] 00001176 004 OF 004 [ORG Development Institute  ] ; [PER Jill Johnstone  ] , [ORG National Consumer Council  ] ; [PER David Mepham  ] , [ORG Save the Children  ] ; [PER Kanayo Felix Nwanze  ] , Vice President ) [ORG IFAD  ] ; [PER Ruth Rawling  ] , [ORG Cargill  ] plc ; [PER Josette Sheeran  ] , [ORG World Food Program  ] ; [PER Stefan Tangermann  ] , [ORG OECD Trade & Agriculture Directorate  ] ; [PER Goran Trapp  ] , [ORG Morgan Stanley  ] ; and [PER Joachim von Braun  ] , Director General [ORG IFPRI Inter Food Policy Institute Research.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Brown’s hastily arranged “summit” had no other government leaders represented . 
It came at a time of unremittingly bad political news for the PM and offered him a chance to assert leadership on a widely supported international issue .
