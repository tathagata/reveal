REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: In an August 14 meeting , [PER CODEL McCain  ] told [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi that the possible release of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi from a [MISC Scottish  ] prison is a very sensitive issue for the [MISC American  ] public , and strongly urged the [MISC Libyan  ] Goverment to handle the release - if it happens - in a way that would strengthen the growing relationship between our two countries , rather than hinder its progress . 
While [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi bristled at the message , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi calmly made the point that [PER Megrahi  ] was , in the eyes of several international organizations , a " political captive " who was gravely ill . 
Both Qadhafis likened [PER Megrahi  ] 's case to that of the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses , who were released from a [MISC Libyan  ] prison last year , and also argued that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government could not control popular reaction to [PER Megrahi  ] 's potential release . 
We believe the [ORG CODEL  ] 's message was helpful to our goal of laying down a marker for a measured GOL response to [PER Megrahi  ] 's release . 
Other topics discussed in the meetings will be reported septel . 
End Summary . 
[PER MUATASSIM  ] INSISTS [PER MEGRAHI  ] IS INNOCENT 2 . 
( C ) During an August 14 meeting with [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , [PER CODEL McCain  ] conveyed the message that the decision that is expected to be made in [LOC Scotland  ] next week regarding the release of [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi will be very sensitive to the [MISC American  ] public . 
The [MISC Senators  ] emphasized that , as friends , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Libya  ] must address the issue openly . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] explained that [LOC Libya  ] 's official response to the possible release of [PER Megrahi  ] would influence bilateral relations - positively or negatively - and could represent a step backwards if [LOC Libya  ] offers [PER Megrahi  ] a hero 's welcome . 
[PER Muatassim  ] reacted defensively , telling the [ORG CODEL  ] that [PER Megrahi  ] " is an innocent man , and we believe it . 
" [PER Muatassim  ] then compared [PER Megrahi  ] 's case to that of the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses convicted in [LOC Libya  ] of intentionally infecting 400 [MISC Libyan  ] children with the [MISC HIV  ] virus , arguing that they had been welcomed in [LOC Bulgaria  ] as returning heroes even though they had been sentenced to life in prison ( Ref A ) . 
He stressed that the [MISC Libya-EU  ] [ORG MOU  ] involving the transfer of the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses specified that they would complete their life sentences in prison . 
" They were released even before they arrived at the airport , " he lamented ( Ref B ) . 
Regarding [PER Megrahi  ] 's potential homecoming , [PER Muatassim  ] stressed that the people govern [LOC Libya  ] and as such , " they will express their will in whichever way they like . 
" He stated that [MISC Libyan  ] officials " cannot stop the people if they celebrate in freedom . 
" QADHAFI SAYS THE [MISC LIBYAN  ] PEOPLE WILL DECIDE HOW TO RESPOND ON [PER MEGRAHI  ] 3 . 
( C ) Stressing that they were raising the issue in the strongest spirit of friendship and respect , the [MISC Senators  ] addressed the potential release of [PER Megrahi  ] with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi during their follow-on meeting with him . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] forecasted that a hero 's welcome for [PER Megrahi  ] would represent the first crisis in the renewed [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] relationship and that both sides would have to work hard to ensure that it does not damage the relationship . 
The elder [PER Qadhafi  ] 's reaction to the [ORG Senators'  ] comments regarding [PER Megrahi  ] was much more measured than that of his son , though his words were similar . 
He began by commenting that all of the decisions made by international organizations and groups - including the [ORG Arab League  ] , the [ORG Organization of the Islamic Conference  ] , the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] , and the [ORG African Union  ] - regarding [PER Megrahi  ] described him as a " political captive , " who had taken the fall - in a political verdict - in place of the " real culprit . 
" Stating that [PER Megrahi  ] was at the disposal of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] , he calmly argued that [PER Megrahi  ] had not been given the chance to see a doctor regularly and was now " gravely ill , " explaining that he was serving out his death sentence in the most literal sense . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] , who remained relaxed throughout Senator [PER Lieberman  ] 's remarks and pointedly shushed [PER Muatassim  ] when he tried to intervene , told the [ORG CODEL  ] that he understood the [ORG Senators'  ] need to speak on behalf of the [MISC American  ] people . 
Noting that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government also must be responsive to public opinion , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi proceeded to compare [PER Megrahi  ] 's case to the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses , reiterating his son 's remark that the nurses were released from their sentences even before they reached the airport to return to their home country . 
Calling them murderers , he remarked in a tone of disbelief that they were welcomed home by the [MISC Bulgarian  ] President himself . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] emphasized that if [PER Megrahi  ] was released , neither he nor any other [MISC Libyan  ] official could control the manner in which the [MISC Libyan  ] people reacted . 
" They could even demonstrate against me , " [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000661 002.2 OF 002 he said . 
[PER Lieberman  ] noted [PER Qadhafi  ] 's views but stressed that he hoped the two sides could manage this issue . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] ended the conversation by stating that " we have to accept the challenge and face it . 
" [ORG CODEL  ] PRESS STATEMENT 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CODEL  ] later echoed these remarks in its August 14 press availability . 
( Note: The [ORG CODEL  ] 's written statement , delivered by Senator [PER McCain  ] , was sent by email to NEA/MAG and NEA/PPD . 
End note . 
) In his remarks , Senator [PER Lieberman  ] further underscored the [PER Megrahi  ] message , noting that this " possibly could be the first crisis in our bilateral relationship . 
" He had prefaced this statement with very positive comments about the bilateral relationship that praised [LOC Libya  ] 's decision to abandon its WMD programs , highlighted ongoing cooperation , and expressed hope for the possibility of expanded security cooperation . 
COMMENT 6 . 
( C ) Comment: To the best of our collective knowledge , this is the first time that any [LOC U.S.  ] official has raised [PER Megrahi  ] 's potential release with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi . 
Senior MFA contacts had strongly urged [ORG CDA  ] to encourage the [ORG CODEL  ] not to raise the issue with [PER Qadhafi  ] , arguing that the issue was extremely sensitive and could have negative repercussions for the relationship . 
( Note: We had advised the [ORG CODEL  ] that this was indeed a sensitive issue , but that it was entirely their call as to whether and how to raise the issue . 
End note . 
) Judging from his body language , [PER Qadhafi  ] did not appear to take any immediate offense to the discussion , and the meeting continued for another 10-15 minutes without any discernable change in tone . 
7 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment  ] continued: Both Qadhafis seemed to appreciate the need for the [ORG CODEL  ] to share the views of the [MISC American  ] people , and made it clear that [LOC Libya  ] 's response to any potential [PER Megrahi  ] release would in turn be determined by the [MISC Libyan  ] people . 
Left unspoken , of course , was the huge role that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government plays in orchestrating popular opinion and churning out the masses for public rallies . 
We believe the [ORG CODEL  ] 's message was very helpful to our goal of laying down the marker for a measured GOL response to [PER Megrahi  ] 's release , and it could be a useful buildling block for any future messages from the [ORG Department .  ] 
8 . 
( U ) [ORG CODEL  ] [PER McCain  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this message prior to departure .
