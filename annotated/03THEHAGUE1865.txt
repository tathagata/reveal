[PER RUSSEL  ] FOR REAS ONS 1.5 ( B AND D ) ( C ) 1 . 
In a visit to The [MISC Hague  ] , July 15-16 , [PER A/S Jones  ] met with senior officials from [ORG MFA  ] , MoD , and [MISC MoJ  ] , parliamentarians , the [ORG National Rapporteur for Trafficking  ] , and with Mission personnel . 
This cable reports her discussions on foreign and economic policy . 
Trafficking in people , counter-narcotics , [ORG OSCE  ] , and [MISC French-German  ] security ideas are reported septels. -------------------------------- Transatlantic Relations and [LOC Iraq  ] -------------------------------- ( C ) 2 . 
[ORG MFA Deputy Political  ] Director [PER Schaper  ] raised [LOC Iraq  ] , noting that the [MISC Dutch  ] would need a political voice once its troops were deployed . 
He referred to gaining a political voice as a warranted return on their offer of blood and treasure , and necessary domestically , particularly if something were to happen to their troops . 
The disadvantage of a coalition of the willing , compared to operations run by [ORG NATO  ] , include lack of a clear political structure for contributors . 
( C ) 3 . 
[PER Schaper  ] also noted the effect [LOC Iraq  ] has had on the [ORG EU  ] [ORG CFSP  ] . 
The [ORG Dutch Government  ] supports [ORG CFSP  ] Chief [PER Solana  ] 's call for increased [MISC European  ] focus on terrorism and nonproliferation , and also agrees that [LOC Europe  ] is not doing enough to modernize its defenses . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] government favors the development of [ORG CFSP  ] , it sees no basis for a [MISC European  ] foreign policy based on drawing distinctions between [LOC Europe  ] and the [ORG U.S. A/S Jones  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] considered the [LOC Iraq  ] debate an intra-European rather than transatlantic dispute . 
She noted that in crafting [ORG UNSCR  ] 1483 , the [LOC U.S.  ] sought to facilitate consensus on next steps in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
She said [LOC Washington  ] was keenly aware that [MISC European  ] participation in stabilizing [LOC Iraq  ] was essential . 
[PER Schaper  ] noted the [LOC Netherlands  ] will be the fourth largest troop contributor to the stabilization force in [LOC Iraq  ] and that as such , the [ORG Dutch Government  ] is nervous about its involvement in the wider debate over the political process in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
For the [MISC Dutch  ] part , [PER Schaper  ] said [LOC Iraq  ] illustrates the continuing relevance of multilateral institutions . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] favored [ORG NATO  ] 's new out-of-area role . 
Another example of this is that Foreign Minister [PER de Hoop Scheffer  ] supports a [ORG NATO  ] role in an eventual [LOC Middle East  ] peacekeeping effort . 
[PER A/S Jones  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] strongly supported [ORG NATO  ] 's new out-of-area role and that she would share with [LOC Washington  ] colleagues the [MISC Dutch  ] desire for enhanced consultations among troop contributing countries . 
( C ) 4 . 
In separate meetings with parliamentarians from [MISC Democrats-66  ] ( D-66 ) and the [ORG Labor  ] party ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , [PER A/S Jones  ] refuted the notion that the [LOC U.S.  ] is trying to divide [LOC Europe  ] . 
On the contrary , she said , the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to maximize cooperation with the [ORG EU  ] , including in [LOC Iraq  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Africa  ] and in combating terrorism and HIV . 
She cited recent achievements , including the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] summit and the [ORG ESDP  ] agreement that paved the way for the [ORG EU  ] to lead the [LOC Macedonia  ] mission . 
D-66 parliamentarian [PER Bert Bakker  ] , who chaired parliament 's investigation into [LOC Srebrenica  ] , said the deployment to [LOC Iraq  ] is the first real test of procedures the [MISC Dutch  ] put into place to avoid the sort of debacle that occured in [LOC Srebrenica  ] . 
He also commended [ORG UNSCR  ] 1483 , saying the [LOC U.S.  ] had done a great job and that for most in parliament , including those opposed to the attack , the resolution turned the page. ----------- The [LOC Balkans  ] ----------- ( C ) 5 . 
[PER Schaper  ] observed that the process that had led to the [ORG EU  ] 's takeover of peacekeeping in [LOC Macedonia  ] had gone well . 
He raised [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about a possible transition of [ORG SFOR  ] from [ORG NATO  ] to the [ORG EU  ] and asked if there were any link to the debate over [LOC Iraq  ] . 
A/S [PER Jones  ] expressed [LOC U.S.  ] satisfaction with the negotiations leading to the [ORG EU  ] takeover in [LOC Macedonia  ] . 
She stressed that [LOC U.S.  ] reticence about an [ORG EU  ] takeover of [ORG SFOR  ] in [LOC Bosnia  ] was not related to differences of opinion on [LOC Iraq  ] ; rather , it is too early for such a step . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has noted [ORG High Rep Ashdown  ] 's view that continuing law enforcement concerns , such as combating terrorism and organized crime , are being handled well by [ORG SFOR  ] , and that until the [ORG EU  ] police force is capable of managing these issues [ORG NATO  ] should remain . 
[ORG MFA Security Policy  ] Director agreed that a proper transition in [LOC Bosnia  ] was important and asked what the future of the [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Kosovo  ] would look like . 
[PER A/S Jones  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] position remains in together out , together , and noted that force levels in the [LOC Balkans  ] were a [ORG NATO  ] decision. ---- MEPP ---- ( C ) 6 . 
Michiel den Hond , [ORG MFA  ] Director General for [LOC North Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , said the [ORG Dutch Government  ] appreciates recent progress on the peace process , thanks to President [PER Bush  ] 's involvement . 
[PER Schaper  ] said that within the [ORG EU  ] the [LOC Netherlands  ] is seen as the most pro-Israel and , along with the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Germany  ] , argues for a balanced approach within [ORG EU  ] councils . 
A/S [PER Jones  ] stressed the importance of support for [PER Abu Mazen  ] -- if he is more credible , then [ORG Sharon  ] can take more steps , and the [ORG EU  ] must lend its support to him rather than [PER Arafat  ] . 
Curbing [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hezballah  ] 's ability to disrupt the peace process is also important . 
Den Hond said the biggest help to [PER Abu Mazen  ] would be positive steps by PM Sharon. ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- ( C ) 7 . 
[ORG Labor  ] party defense spokesperson [PER Timmermans  ] described a recent trip to [LOC Iran  ] with members of the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament 's foreign relations committee . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] is especially interested in enhancing cooperation with the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament because the [LOC Netherlands  ] is the most critical of [LOC Iran  ] within the [ORG EU  ] . 
In reviewing his trip , [PER Timmermans  ] said the human rights situation is depressing . 
[MISC Parliamentarians  ] commited to reform are powerless and expect the situation to get worse . 
Despite support in [LOC Tehran  ] and among elites for reform , rural people tend to support the religious leaders . 
[PER Timmermans  ] saw a glimmer of hope in [MISC Iranian  ] comments on the peace process . 
While the [MISC Iranians  ] were not persuaded by the [MISC Dutch  ] to actively support the peace process , they claimed that if ( the road map ) is what the [MISC Palestinians  ] want , then we will not stop it . 
On terrorism , [MISC Iranian  ] officials expressed interest in working with the [LOC U.S.  ] on al-Qaeda but said other terrorist movements they support are actually liberation movements . 
They claimed willingness to address proliferation problems , as well . 
A/S [PER Jones  ] cited [PER El Baradei  ] 's disappointing visit to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] responded that the only way ahead is for [LOC Iran  ] to build relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG EU  ] can facilitate a dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] but only a [MISC U.S.-Iranian  ] relationship would lead to reform. -------------- Trade Disputes -------------- ( U ) 8 . 
A discussion of trade disputes and their effect on relations revealed a divergence of views at the lunch hosted by [ORG MFA  ] deputy Political Director [PER Herman Schaper  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] voiced their concern over the cases filed at the [ORG WTO  ] . 
They said they don't want trade disputes to hurt relations , but the reality is that we are on a downward spiral . 
The [ORG EU  ] is increasingly willing to retaliate . 
The [ORG EU  ] has on hand a pre-approved list of [LOC U.S.  ] products to target in response to any future trade row . 
To illustrate his point , [PER Schaper  ] asked his [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts to Imagine what would happen if the [ORG EU  ] placed sanctions on [LOC Florida  ] oranges in an election year . 
( U ) 9 . 
[PER A/S Jones  ] voiced confidence in dispute resolution mechanisms , and said she sees fewer problems than in the past . 
[PER A/S Jones  ] noted good [MISC U.S.-EU  ] collaboration at the [LOC Doha Round  ] and in preparations for [LOC Cancun  ] , and highlighted the [LOC White House  ] 's commitment to making sure developing countries are not forgotten . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] said they had high hopes for [LOC Cancun  ] and agreed that this is a good potential area for [MISC U.S.-EU  ] cooperation . 
In a separate meeting , [ORG Labor  ] party [ORG MP  ] [PER Frans Timmermans  ] expressed the urgency of a successful [LOC Doha  ] round and of ensuring that developing countries get something out of it , too. ------------ Other Issues ------------ ( SBU ) 10 . 
[PER Schaper  ] stressed the importance that the [LOC Netherlands  ] attaches to multilateral institutions , though this will prove hollow if they do not produce results . 
He noted a renewed [MISC Dutch  ] emphasis on bilateral relations , especially with new [ORG EU  ] members , and with the the [LOC U.S.  ] A/S [PER Jones  ] observed that the [LOC U.S.  ] had sought to bring all issues of importance to multilateral institutions such as the [ORG UNSC  ] , [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG OSCE  ] and the [ORG WTO  ] . 
( U ) 11 .
