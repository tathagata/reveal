( S ) SUMMARY . 
Ambassador [PER Alexander Vershbow  ] , Assistant Secretary of Defense for [ORG International Security Affairs  ] , led a [LOC U.S.  ] delegation to [LOC Warsaw  ] for the first-ever [MISC U.S.-Poland  ] High [ORG Level Defense Group  ] ( [ORG HLDG  ] ) . 
[MISC Polish  ] Undersecretary of Defense for Policy [PER Stanislaw Komorowski  ] led the [MISC Polish  ] delegation . 
The discussion on the first day of the [ORG HLDG  ] focused on providing more details for [ORG U.S. Missile Defense  ] plans and a prospective [MISC Polish  ] role in the new concept as well as additional aspects for the deployment of a [ORG U.S. Patriot  ] battery to [LOC Poland  ] for training and exercises . 
Additionally , the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation laid out three potential alternative presence options which , if [LOC Poland  ] chose , could replace a [MISC Patriot  ] garrison as a post-2012 permanent presence of [ORG U.S. Armed Forces  ] . 
Day 2 of the [ORG HLDG  ] focused on strategic discussions , including [MISC U.S.-Poland  ] bilateral defense cooperation , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and NATO’s new strategic concept . 
In addition , the [MISC Polish  ] side provided reaction to the possible alternative presence options the [LOC U.S.  ] outlined the previous day . 
[MISC Polish  ] reaction to the BMD proposal was positive , though they were disappointed that the [MISC SM-3  ] site would not become operational until 2018 , and they sought more information about how early preparations for the deployment could begin . 
The response to alternative presence options was very positive , both in plenary session and in a small two-on-two dinner meeting the night before . 
The questions about the [MISC Patriot  ] presentation focused on timing and interoperability . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation included [MISC USAF MG  ] [PER Paul Schafer  ] , EUCOM Director , Strategy , Policy , and Assessment ; [ORG USAF  ] BG [PER John Hesterman  ] , [ORG Joint Staff Deputy  ] Director for [ORG Politico-Military Affairs  ] ; Ambassador [PER Lee Feinstein  ] , [ORG U.S. Embassy Warsaw  ] ; DAS [PER Pamela Quanrud  ] , [ORG Bureau of  ] [MISC European  ] and [ORG Eurasian Affairs  ] ; DAS [PER Frank Rose  ] , Verification , Compliance , and Implementation ; and Ms. [PER Nancy Morgan  ] , MDA Director for [ORG International Affairs  ] . 
The [MISC Polish  ] side included Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Jacek Najder  ] ; [ORG MG Mieczyslaw Gocul  ] , Chief of [ORG Strategic Planning Directorate  ] , General Staff of the [ORG Armed Forces  ] ; and [PER Piotr Pacholski  ] , MOD Director of the [ORG Missile Defense Office  ] . 
NEW BMD ARCHITECTURE IN EUROPE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Undersecretary [PER Komorowski  ] began by explaining that [LOC Poland  ] understood the reasoning for the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to change direction on a [ORG European Ballistic Missile Defense  ] program , but that more detail on the threat and the potential [MISC SM-3  ] deployment in [LOC Poland  ] would be welcome . 
[PER Komorowski  ] underscored that [LOC Poland  ] wanted to take its responsibility for the decision on whether to take part in the new system seriously and was looking for further details on the system to inform that decision. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Ambassador [PER Vershbow  ] opened by stating that we know the September 17 briefing on the new [LOC U.S.  ] approach had raised many questions . 
We welcomed this opportunity to explain this approach in greater detail , and why we felt it was a better approach for [MISC U.S.-Polish  ] relations and for [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Nancy Morgan  ] of the [ORG Missile Defense Agency  ] briefed the [MISC Polish  ] side on the [ORG U.S. Missile Defense Phased Adaptive Approach  ] ( [ORG PAA  ] ) plan . 
The brief laid out the objectives for each of the four phases , described the potential role that [LOC Poland  ] could play , and illustrated the differences between the [MISC Ground Based Interceptors  ] ( [ORG GBI  ] ) and the [ORG Standard Missile  ] ( [ORG SM  ] ) -3 program . 
Following the brief , the [MISC Polish  ] delegation asked many questions about the importance of Poland’s location for the program , other ways [LOC Poland  ] might be able to participate in the system beyond hosting a land-based [MISC SM-3  ] system , and the timing necessary for Poland’s decision . 
The [MISC Poles  ] also asked how the [MISC SM-3  ] system , if deployed in [LOC Poland  ] , could become a [ORG NATO  ] system , and finally , a series of hypothetical questions on the adaptive nature of the system vis-a-vis the changing threat. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) ASD [PER Vershbow  ] said that with regard to location , [LOC Poland  ] was given “right of first refusal” because of its previous commitments and because [LOC Poland  ] was a very good site for defending all of [LOC Northern Europe  ] . 
That said , [LOC Poland  ] was not the only possibility for a northern [MISC European  ] interceptor site . 
ASD [PER Vershbow  ] said that the timing of activating the [MISC Polish  ] site in 2018 rather than 2015 was driven by analysis of the threat , but also by the development timeline of the [ORG SM-3 Block  ] IIA interceptor , which was key to providing wide-area protection to allies in [LOC Northern Europe  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Vershbow  ] stressed , however , that preparation of the site could begin well in advance of activation , possibly in 2013 , but that we would need to work with [ORG Congress  ] to get funding for early site preparation . 
With regard to how [ORG NATO  ] might defend itself from missiles coming from elsewhere than [LOC Iran  ] or [LOC Syria  ] , BG [PER John Hesterman  ] of the [ORG Joint Staff  ] said that sea-borne platforms could provide surge capability against threats from an unforeseen direction , land-based sites could be upgraded with more interceptors if the scale of the threat were increased , and radars could be reoriented . 
The [MISC Poles  ] asked whether proceeding with [ORG Phase III  ] when [ORG SM-3 Block  ] IIA would be deployed to [LOC Poland  ] was firm or would die if perception of the threat receded . 
ASD [PER Vershbow  ] reassured the [MISC Poles  ] of [LOC U.S.  ] commitment on this point . 
[MISC PATRIOT  ] [ORG PHASE  ] 1 WILL NOT BE OPERATIONAL <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Following delivery of the [MISC Non-Paper  ] providing further definition to the [LOC US  ] policy regarding [MISC Patriot  ] rotations , [PER LTC Sean Gainey  ] from [LOC U.S.  ] Army [LOC Europe  ] briefed the concept for the [ORG Phase  ] 1 rotations of a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Patriot  ] battery to [LOC Poland  ] . 
In response to a direct question from [PER Komorowski  ] following the brief , ASD [PER Vershbow  ] emphasized that the rotations will be solely for training and exercises and would not add to [MISC Polish  ] air defense capabilities , and Maj Gen [PER Schafer  ] reinforced the point made by the interagency cleared [MISC Patriot  ] non-paper that the [MISC Patriot  ] battery would not be operational at any time . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation asserted that the [LOC U.S.  ] is committed to doing quarterly rotations in [LOC Poland  ] through 2012 . 
However , it was made clear that training opportunities would be limited to basic familiarization training due to current disclosure restrictions unless [LOC Poland  ] decided to buy [MISC Patriot  ] systems . 
ASD [PER Vershbow  ] also reiterated that a deployment of a [MISC Patriot  ] battery would not take place without a ratified [ORG Supplemental Status of Forces Agreement  ] ( [ORG SSA  ] ) . 
However , the [LOC U.S.  ] would , on the basis of continued progress on [MISC SOFA  ] negotiations , move forward with bilateral planning for a March 2010 deployment in good faith that the [ORG SSA  ] would soon be brought into force . 
ALTERNATIVE PRESENCE OPTIONS IN PLACE OF [MISC PATRIOT  ] GARRISON <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Near the end of Day 1 discussions , ASD [PER Vershbow  ] presented new options for potential cooperation which the [LOC U.S.  ] believed may be more useful to [LOC Poland  ] than [MISC Patriot  ] rotations . 
He explained that we looked at other alternative programs that would be affordable for both countries , would assist in the modernization of the [ORG Polish Armed Forces  ] , would help [LOC Poland  ] better meet its [ORG NATO  ] force goals , and would be sustainable by the [LOC U.S.  ] military . 
The three options presented were: 1 ) a quarterly rotation of [MISC F-16s  ] , and the establishment of a small permanent support detachment , which would focus on enhancing [MISC Polish  ] fighter capabilities , increasing sortie readiness and meeting [ORG NATO  ] commitments ; 2 ) quarterly [MISC C-130  ] rotations from [LOC Ramstein AFB  ] , also with a small permanent support detachment in [LOC Poland  ] with the goal of increasing [MISC Polish  ] readiness and ability to support own and [ORG NATO  ] operations ; 3 ) the relocation of a [ORG U.S. Naval Special Warfare  ] unit from [LOC Stuttgart  ] to [LOC Gdansk  ] or [LOC Gdynia  ] . 
The [MISC Polish  ] delegation accepted [LOC U.S.  ] unwillingness to discuss [MISC Patriot  ] [ORG Phase  ] 2 and the garrison until after consideration of the alternate presence options , and the atmosphere in the room was positive and constructive . 
[PER Komorowski  ] also said both in a small meeting preceding the [ORG HLDG  ] and in plenary that the Patriot’s contribution to [MISC Polish  ] air defense is minimal , though important symbolically. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) At the start of Day 2 , the [MISC Polish  ] delegation presented its initial reactions to the alternative presence proposals . 
Undersecretary [PER Komorowski  ] said he believed the proposal for [MISC F-16  ] rotations was his favorite . 
The reactions from the [MISC Polish  ] experts included many questions of detail: when could the rotations arrive , how many planes would each rotation have , how many people would be in the permanent support unit , would the [LOC U.S.  ] be able to provide tanker and [MISC AWACS  ] support , and would the rotation only operate in [LOC Poland  ] , or would it be allowed to train [MISC Polish  ] ground and air crews ? 
EUCOM pledged to follow up with more detailed discussions on these proposals at a later date . 
To the three proposals , Undersecretary [PER Komorowski  ] added a fourth for the [LOC U.S.  ] to consider - as an additional rather than a replacement for any of the [LOC U.S.  ] proposals . 
Noting that [MISC Polish  ] Minister of Defense [PER Bogdan Klich  ] planned to sign an agreement with his [MISC Ukrainian  ] counterpart that very day establishing the framework for a combined [MISC Polish-Ukrainian-Lithuanian Brigade  ] that would be stood up for international deployments by 2013 , [PER Komorowski  ] asked if it would be possible for [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in this brigade , either assigning some forces or stationing officers at the permanent headquarters to be located in [LOC Lublin  ] . 
DEFENSE COOPERATION <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Undersecretary [PER Komorowski  ] defined the [MISC Polish  ] approach to defense cooperation by dividing proposals for new programs into two categories: [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment assistance and programs funded through Foreign Military Financing ( [ORG FMF  ] ) . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Komorowski  ] detailed a “wishlist” for [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation including better help on UAVs and other sensors , giving [LOC Poland  ] access to “Four Eyes”-level intelligence by making it a [MISC Fifth Eye  ] , increased [LOC U.S.  ] provision of [ORG Mine Resistant Ambush Protected  ] ( [ORG MRAP  ] ) vehicles , and the building of a runway in [LOC Ghazni  ] to support [MISC C-130  ] flights . 
On [ORG FMF  ] , [PER Komorowski  ] stated that [LOC Poland  ] wishes to focus mainly on C4ISR purchases to increase the interoperability of [MISC Polish  ] military equipment . 
BG [PER Hesterman  ] of the [ORG Joint Staff  ] related that the Chairman has a lot of empathy for [MISC Poland’s  ] [ORG MRAP  ] issues based on our own experiences with [MISC IEDs  ] and that the Chairman remains fully engaged in assisting [LOC Poland  ] in this critical area . 
On the runway question , [PER Hesterman  ] reiterated what the Chairman told the [MISC Polish  ] CHOD in June that the [LOC U.S.  ] is willing to assist with contracting support coordination to build the extension . 
He added that with the [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy and resourcing under review and decisions pending in our capital and others , that there could be more developments in this area . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] POLITICAL CHALLENGES <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Jacek Najder  ] , the [MISC Polish  ] Plenipotentiary for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , provided a [MISC Polish  ] strategic overview for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He concurred with COMISAF’s assessment that the Alliance had lost the strategic initiative and that [ORG NATO  ] was not keeping pace with the insurgents . 
In [LOC Ghazni  ] province , where [LOC Poland  ] is focusing most of its attention , voting irregularities were high . 
While [LOC Poland  ] is also disappointed with the way the election played out , [PER Najder  ] asserted that regardless of whether there is a run-off , the challenge will be in incorporating the lessons learned from the August election so that the 2010 Parliamentary elections in [LOC Afghanistan  ] function better . 
[PER Najder  ] also called for a greater regional focus to expand to both [LOC India  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
Finally , [PER Najder  ] stressed that [LOC Poland  ] remained in [LOC Afghanistan  ] because of [ORG NATO  ] and the importance that [ORG NATO  ] has to [MISC Poland’s  ] national security . 
However , he believed that [ORG NATO  ] should delink success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] with evaluations of [LOC NATO’s  ] overall success . 
[PER Komorowski  ] emphasized that [LOC Poland  ] was committed to the pledge of “in together , out together” on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , he noted the difficulty for [MISC Polish  ] politicians in reconciling the high public support for [MISC Polish  ] membership in [ORG NATO  ] with public support for consequences and responsibilities such as operation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which come with [ORG NATO  ] membership. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) ASD [PER Vershbow  ] noted that President [PER Obama  ] was still reviewing the recommendations of [LOC COMISAF  ] and his resource requests , but emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] would not turn away from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which was a test of [LOC NATO’s  ] credibility . 
He agreed that it would be better to expand the discussion with [LOC Iran  ] to encourage better behavior , but said that this was unlikely to succeed in the short term . 
In response to questions on the role of [LOC Russia  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , ASD [PER Vershbow  ] recalled that [LOC Russia  ] also wants to contain many of the threats to [LOC Russia  ] , including terrorism and narcotics trafficking , but was also sensitive about the [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Central Asia  ] . 
Recalling the July agreement for air transit of lethal goods through [LOC Russia  ] , ASD [PER Vershbow  ] stated his belief that [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] could find additional ways to partner with [LOC Russia  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG NATO  ] STRATEGIC CONCEPT: DEFENSE OVER SECURITY <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Komorowski  ] declared that it was time for a new document , not just the alteration of the 1999 [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
He said that the most important aspect of the new strategic concept for [LOC Poland  ] will be the reaffirmation of [ORG Article  ] 5 of the [ORG North Atlantic Treaty  ] as the most important agreement between the Allies , and that [ORG Article  ] 5 shall take precedence over expeditionary operations . 
Noting that the strategic environment had changed , he stated his belief that a new doctrine was needed that would expand [LOC NATO’s  ] capabilities to deal with its members’ obligations under [ORG Article  ] 5 . 
[PER Komorowski  ] explained that while out-of-area operations were valid [ORG NATO  ] missions , that the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] must clearly state that [LOC NATO’s  ] door remained open as well as introduce clarity into how [ORG NATO  ] deals with its international partners , especially [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Komorowski  ] related that [MISC Poland’s  ] member of the “wise persons” group , [PER Adam Rotfeld  ] , was consulting with other central [MISC European  ] countries to give them the sense that their input was taken in the process . 
Minister [PER Najder  ] concluded by simply stating that [ORG NATO  ] remained a defense alliance , not a security organization. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) ASD [PER Vershbow  ] remarked that both countries came at the issue from a similar perspective . 
[ORG NATO  ] , in his opinion , needed a shorter , crisper document which would be more accessible to both parliaments and public and better made the case for an increase in resources to meet [LOC NATO’s  ] full mission set . 
There was a need to find the proper balance between [ORG Article  ] 5 and expeditionary missions . 
Observing that [ORG Article  ] 5 may need to be viewed more broadly to encompass non-military threats like cyber-attacks . 
ASD [PER Vershbow  ] cautioned that we would need to have a strategy with real meaning , backed up by planning , exercises , and capabilities . 
He said it was clear that zero growth of the [ORG NATO  ] budget was unsustainable with the expansion of [ORG NATO  ] missions and we needed to look at common funding and other reforms and get more value for money. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) COMMENT . 
In marked contrast to September 17 , the mood of the two days of HLDG discussions was positive and constructive . 
The [MISC Polish  ] delegation listened to [LOC U.S.  ] proposals on BMD and [MISC Patriot  ] , and both sides conveyed a sense that real progress was made . 
Concerns exist on the [MISC Polish  ] side at having to wait until 2018 for SM-3 site activation , but the possibility raised by ASD Vershbow of early site preparation helped mitigate the concern . 
The [MISC Poles  ] asked specific questions in an effort to determine whether [ORG Phase  ] 1 [MISC Patriot  ] rotations would have any operational capacity , but seemed to accept the fact that they would not and that this was the established [LOC U.S.  ] position ( despite the public comments of [PER Komorowski  ] following the meeting ) . 
The [MISC Polish  ] side was prepared to defer discussion of the [ORG Phase  ] 2 [MISC Patriot  ] garrison , and the alternative presence options generated favorable interest . 
The question moving forward is the extent to which this constructive progress will be felt higher in the [MISC Polish  ] government , particularly by Foreign Minister [PER Radoslaw Sikorski  ] . 
END COMMENT <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) ASD [PER Vershbow  ] has reviewed and cleared this cable .
