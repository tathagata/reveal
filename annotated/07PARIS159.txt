( C ) [PER Poloff  ] delivered reftel demarche on January 16 to [ORG MFA Iran Desk  ] Officer [PER Arnaud Pescheux  ] , who indicated that [LOC France  ] had not budgeted any funds for democracy promotion in [LOC Iran  ] . 
" If we were to do something , it would undoubtedly be via [LOC Brussels  ] , " [PER Pescheux  ] said . 
He noted that [LOC France  ] " anticipated supporting " a proposal by [PER Javier Solana  ] for the EU to expand its own [LOC Farsi  ] broadcasting capabilities , although he said that details of that proposal have yet to be worked out . 
While the [ORG MFA  ] does not currently partner with any [MISC French  ] [ORG NGOs  ] operating in [LOC Iran  ] , in the past a few [ORG NGOs  ] ( e.g. , [ORG Reporters Without Borders  ] ) had brought members of [MISC Iranian  ] civil society to [LOC France  ] to participate in programs . 
[MISC French  ] Envoy to [LOC Tehran  ] ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Citing a press report in the January 16 edition of [ORG Le Monde  ] , [PER Poloff  ] asked whether it was true that [LOC France  ] planned to send a presidential envoy to [LOC Tehran  ] in the near future . 
Choosing his words with care , [PER Pescheux  ] said that the [ORG Le Monde  ] report was " not false " but stressed that a final decision had not yet been taken . 
[PER Pescheux  ] said that the envoy would not engage on the nuclear file but would instead discuss regional issues and , in particular , would seek to " find a solution on [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Poloff  ] said he was shocked that [LOC France  ] , which had steadfastly rejected entreaties to negotiate [LOC Lebanon  ] 's future with the [MISC Syrian  ] regime , apparently found the prospect of conducting similar negotiations with [LOC Tehran  ] less objectionable . 
Had the [MISC Iranians  ] given the [MISC French  ] some indication that they would be more forthcoming than [LOC Damascus  ] ? 
No , [PER Pescheux  ] admitted , the [MISC Iranians  ] had not tipped their hand ; they had merely indicated that they were willing to talk . 
Supreme Leader Still on Top --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to the results of [LOC Iran  ] 's recent elections , [PER Pescheux  ] indicated that the [MISC French  ] were pleasantly surprised by the outcome ( immediately prior to the election , their reporting from [LOC Tehran  ] suggested that President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's supporters were poised to make significant gains in the Assembly of Experts ) . 
The [ORG Quai  ] 's interpretation of the election results is that the axis between Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] and former President [PER Rafsanjani  ] ( i.e. , the traditional conservatives ) has been strengthened , with [PER Khamenei  ] remaining the supreme arbiter of [LOC Iran  ] 's political balance of power . 
In an aside , [PER Pescheux  ] claimed that notwithstanding the [MISC French  ] diplomatic presence in [LOC Tehran  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] has virtually no insight into the inner workings of the [MISC Pasdaran  ] .
