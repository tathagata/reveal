( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Comment:  ] The promotion of [PER Sugheir  ] follows the prediction of diplomats in [LOC Tripoli  ] that a technocrat would be named to replace [PER Shokri Ghanem  ] , a prominent politician and former prime minister ( 2003-2005 ) . 
However , some industry insiders believe that the announcement is not the permanent appointment and is simply a resolution confirming [PER Sugheir  ] as interim Chair . 
They expect [PER Ghanem  ] , who is reportedly close to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , to make a return to politics .
