<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MADRID  ] 002282 SIPDIS SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 12/20/2017 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PTER , SP SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR’S MEETING WITH SPAIN’S CELEBRATED AND CONTROVERSIAL JUDGE BALTASAR GARZON REF: MADRID 2251 [LOC MADRID  ] 00002282 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Eduardo Aguirre Jr.  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( c ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The Ambassador met on December 14 with Judge [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] , a high-profile investigative magistrate in Madrid’s powerful [ORG National Court  ] ( [ORG Audiencia Nacional  ] ) . 
[PER Garzon  ] was upbeat in his comments and said that he has a good understanding of [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement and counterterrorism policy , even though he does not always agree with it . 
He appreciates the close contact he has with the [ORG Embassy  ] and said he considers the [LOC U.S.  ] a friend . 
He also believes we have much to gain from continued collaboration . 
In his view however , the [LOC U.S.  ] is missing opportunities to cultivate relationships with his five colleagues , all fellow investigative magistrates ( [MISC Jueces  ] de Instruccion ) . 
[PER Garzon  ] explained to the Ambassador that judges in [LOC Spain  ] are a hybrid of a [LOC U.S.  ] prosecutor and judge , and can lean more to one side or the other depending on their inclination . 
The six investigative magistrates that preside over [ORG National Courts  ] 1-6 are ( respectively ) : [PER Santiago Pedraz  ] , [PER Ismael Moreno  ] , [PER Fernando Grande-Marlaska  ] , [PER Fernando Andreau  ] , [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] , and [PER Juan Del Olmo  ] . 
The Ambassador informed [PER Garzon  ] that our [ORG Embassy Legal Attache  ] did indeed have good working relationships with some of the other investigative magistrates ( including [PER Del Olmo  ] , who was lead investigator on the March 11 , 2004 , [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings ) , but that we were always interested in ways to work more closely together . 
In that spirit , and because [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] judicial laws are quite different , [PER Garzon  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] should have a judicial attache in [LOC Washington  ] to streamline cooperation on key cases , similar to relationships his country already has in the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Mexico  ] . 
( [ORG Embassy  ] comment: We continue to work closely with the [ORG U.S. Justice Department  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] government to gain mutual approval for the position of a judicial attache based out of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
End Comment . 
) //THE [PER AL-KASSAR EXTRADITION//  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Garzon  ] then provided the Ambassador with his thoughts on the pending extradition of [MISC Syrian  ] arms dealer [PER Monzer al-Kassar  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] ) . 
He said that the judicial part of the extradition had been settled in favor of the [LOC U.S.  ] , but that the [ORG Spanish Council of Ministers  ] still had to give its final approval . 
[PER Al-Kassar  ] would appeal to the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] on the grounds that his human rights had been violated , but the court may not order a halt to the extradition during the approximately 30 days it will take to render its decision . 
[PER Garzon  ] said it was therefore vital that the Council have the chance to decide on the case at its next meeting , scheduled for December 28 , so that [PER Al-Kassar  ] could be transferred to [LOC U.S.  ] custody as soon as possible . 
[PER Garzon  ] reminded the Ambassador that he had prosecuted [PER Al-Kassar  ] in the past , and that he regrets not being able to put him away . 
He believes [PER Al-Kassar  ] will “start singing like a canary” the moment he is in [LOC U.S.  ] custody to try and cut whatever deal he can . 
[PER Garzon  ] clearly has no love lost for [PER Al-Kassar  ] and said “I hope you get him.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Judge [PER Garzon  ] ended the meeting by giving the Ambassador a brief readout of his recent visits to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] press has reported that [PER Garzon  ] is working with [MISC Spanish  ] public television to put together a documentary for broadcast in January that will focus on the current situation in those two countries . 
[PER Garzon  ] told the Ambassador he was grateful for the treatment and level of access he was given by [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
He said the security situation in [LOC Iraq  ] has improved , but he gives the credit more to the willingness of [MISC Iraqi  ] sheikhs and tribal leaders to work with [ORG Coalition  ] forces against the terrorists than to the surge in [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
Although [MISC Spanish  ] press reports have speculated the Garzon’s documentary would be critical of [LOC U.S.  ] CT policy , the Judge did not share specifics on what might be covered in the program. //COMMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Judge [PER Garzon  ] has been a storied and controversial figure in recent [MISC Spanish  ] history , whose ambition and pursuit of the spotlight may be without rival . 
He has investigated everything from corruption in the former [MISC Spanish  ] government of [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] to alleged [MISC Dirty War  ] atrocities committed by past [MISC Argentine  ] governments , and even went after General [PER Augusto Pinochet  ] for genocide , terrorism , and torture . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 00002282 002.2 OF 002 However , he has never prosecuted anyone associated with crimes committed during the [MISC Franco  ] dictatorship . 
He clearly has an anti-American streak ( as evidenced by occasional scathing editorials in the [MISC Spanish  ] press criticizing [ORG Guantanamo  ] and aspects of what he calls the “U.S.-led war on terror” ) , and we are certainly under no illusions about the individual with whom we are dealing . 
There is a very good chance that his documentary next month will indeed be a hatchet job on the [LOC U.S.  ] However , [PER Garzon  ] has also doggedly pursued many important terrorist cases and there have been and will continue to be numerous areas where our interests overlap . 
For instance , [PER Garzon  ] is very active in investigating terrorist pipelines based in [LOC Catalunya  ] that feed would-be suicide bombers to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
One of these individuals was recently detained in [LOC Iraq  ] before committing a terrorist act and [PER Garzon  ] will soon take his deposition . 
This [ORG Embassy  ] has a good working relationship with [PER Garzon  ] and his door has always been open to the Ambassador and members of our [ORG Country Team  ] . 
[ORG Embassy Legat  ] has tried to foster relationships with all six of the investigative magistrates , with varying degrees of success . 
Some are responsive to our outreach and attend [MISC Embassy-organized  ] conferences and events , others do not . 
We will continue to explore ways to deepen our cooperation with these individuals , as [PER Garzon  ] is correct that they all wield significant authority and latitude to investigate and prosecute cases of interest to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC AGUIRRE</pre></code>  ]
