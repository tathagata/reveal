( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] On July 14 , Poloffs met with MFA Deputy [ORG EU  ] Correspondent [PER Jonas Wendel  ] to discuss the July 27-8 [ORG GAERC  ] agenda . 
He said that , as the [MISC Swedes  ] intended , the agenda is short to focus discussion on the most important international issues . 
Currently , there are three B items: conclusions on formulating a political strategy for [LOC Somalia  ] ; extending the mandates of [ORG EU Monitoring Mission  ] ( [ORG EUMM  ] ) and [ORG EU  ] Special Representative ( [ORG EUSR  ] ) [PER Pierre Morel  ] in [LOC Georgia  ] ; and the way forward with [LOC Iran  ] ( at lunch ) . 
The possible A items are: support for the [PER Kofi Annan  ] reconciliation process in [LOC Kenya  ] ( at the request of the [MISC Dutch  ] ) ; [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership application ( if submitted on time ) ; widening sanctions on [LOC Burma  ] ; and UNSCR 1874 on extending sanctions on [LOC North Korea  ] . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Somalia:  ] [ORG EU  ] 's Political Strategy -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Wendel  ] said the [ORG EU  ] intends to give conclusions on the comprehensive political strategy that [PER HiRep Solana  ] began in June . 
The draft strategy , written by the [ORG Commission and Council Secretariat  ] , is currently under review by [ORG EU  ] members . 
[PER Wendel  ] said [LOC Somalia  ] is nearing a breaking point , and [LOC Sweden  ] wants to sharpen the strategy to include a set of concrete contingencies should a crisis emerge . 
[PER Wendel  ] thinks the strategy will be ready by the September [ORG GAERC  ] . 
In the discussion of [LOC Somalia  ] , [PER Wendel  ] said that [ORG EU  ] members are aware that [LOC Eritrea  ] is " meddling " with [LOC Somalia  ] , but it is too early to look at sanctions against [LOC Asmara  ] . 
[ORG Georgia:  ] Extending Mandates --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Extending the [ORG EUMM  ] and [ORG EUSR  ] 's [PER Morel  ] 's mandates are both up for discussion , said [PER Wendel  ] . 
FM [PER Bildt  ] wants to focus on the technical aspects of extending the mandates , and avoid opening up the discussion to broader , political items , including the [LOC South Caucasus  ] . 
Nonetheless , a political rational is needed to prolong the mandates . 
[LOC Sweden  ] wants the conclusions to clearly state that [LOC Russia  ] has not fulfilled all of its commitments since last August , and that [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] are part of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Other Member States want weaker language that does not name [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Wendel  ] said FM [PER Carl Bildt  ] will not " throw out " national interests and " will hold out as long as possible " to get stern language in the conclusions , although the " usual members " do not support the specific mention of the two regions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) FM [PER Bildt  ] is traveling to the [LOC Caucasus  ] on 16 July for a week as part of a [MISC Troika  ] visit . 
There are sensitivities to meeting with President [PER Saakashvili  ] , [PER Wendel  ] said , and [LOC Sweden  ] does not support including him in the [ORG EUMM  ] mandate discussions . 
[PER Bildt  ] is hesitant about what can really be accomplished . 
Iran: Contingencies ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The discussion topics for this lunch item are still being determined , as the [ORG EU  ] is waiting to see if the last local [MISC British  ] Embassy employee is released . 
[PER Bildt  ] has been in frequent contact with FM [PER Mottaki  ] , who , according to [PER Wendel  ] , is playing the " good guy . 
" However , failed attempts over the weekend to set up a call between [PER Bildt  ] and [PER Mottaki  ] have raised concern in [LOC Sweden  ] . 
If the [MISC British  ] employee is not released by Thursday , the [ORG PSC  ] meeting on Friday will be consumed with discussing the way ahead with [LOC Iran  ] . 
One option includes " complicating " the issuance of visas for [MISC Iranian  ] diplomats and officials , and a public announcement of such . 
But visa restrictions would have " shaky legal grounds " because a handful of [ORG EU  ] members do not require [MISC Iranian  ] diplomats to have visas to travel . 
The [MISC Swedes  ] hope that the threat would be enough to push the [MISC Iranians  ] to release the employee , but the [MISC Iranians  ] are " experts at finding legal loopholes " , according to [PER Wendel  ] . 
The [MISC British  ] might not be content with only complicating visa issuance , he added , noting that [LOC London  ] still advocates pulling all [ORG EU Heads of Mission  ] out of [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Sweden  ] opposes this , as do other Member [LOC States.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) If the employee is not released by July 26 , then the [MISC Swedes  ] anticipate the discussion to focus on withdrawing [ORG EU  ] diplomats from [LOC Iran  ] , even if temporarily . 
The [MISC Swedes  ] do not support this because " there might not be other cards to play " and they , along with other [ORG EU  ] members , are concerned that their local employees in [LOC Tehran  ] could be targeted in [LOC STOCKHOLM  ] 00000428 002 OF 002 retaliation . 
Solidarity among [ORG EU  ] members is strong , and if the discussion is emotionally charged , then the ministers might agree to a withdrawal . 
[PER Wendel  ] added that the [MISC British  ] are pleased with how [LOC Sweden  ] has handled the situation. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) If the [MISC British  ] Embassy hostage situation is resolved , then ministers will discuss the nuclear &crisis . 
" [PER Wendel  ] said that [LOC Sweden  ] was happy with the [ORG G8  ] statement on [LOC Iran  ] , especially because [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] supported it . 
The [LOC UK  ] wants a list of sanctions against [MISC Iranian  ] entities to be prepared now , [PER Wendel  ] said , but [LOC Sweden  ] would prefer to keep discussion at a general level because if the [MISC Iranians  ] ( or the [MISC Russians  ] or the [MISC Chinese  ] ) became aware of the [ORG EU  ] doing " specific " and " legal " work on additional sanctions , then they would complain that the [ORG EU  ] was never serious about giving [LOC Iran  ] time to respond to the [ORG P5  ] 1 offer . 
We realize , [PER Wendel  ] continued , that we have used this argument for two years now and " for our own credibility " [LOC Sweden  ] might now have to go along with the consensus view of Member [LOC States.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Wendel  ] noted that [LOC Sweden  ] assesses [MISC Iranian  ] leaders have " not really made up their minds about where they want the process to end . 
" Will they settle for a break-out capability , or do they want to demonstrate their possession of a nuclear deterrent like [LOC North Korea  ] has done ? 
Because [LOC Sweden  ] thinks the [MISC Iranians  ] are still trying to decide this , [PER Wendel  ] said that the " crunch time " will not come during their Presidency but rather during the follow-on [MISC Spanish  ] Presidency . 
[PER Wendel  ] added that [PER Bildt  ] has looked at the " assessments of many different countries " relating to the pace of [MISC Iranian  ] enrichment activity and has concluded that it will be " three or four years " before [LOC Tehran  ] will have a nuclear capability . 
A Items: [LOC Kenya  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] , [LOC Burma  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] ------------------------------ -- ( U ) [MISC Kenya:  ] At [MISC Dutch  ] request , there will be conclusions in support of the [PER Kofi Annan  ] reconciliation process surrounding post-2008 elections. -- ( U ) Iceland: Applicant [ORG EU  ] members are required to submit applications 14 days in advance of a [ORG GAERC  ] , which was July 13 in [LOC Iceland  ] 's case , said [PER Wendel  ] . 
The [ORG Icelandic Parliament  ] is " unsettled " on the issue , so the application might be delayed until September . 
In addition , [LOC Iceland  ] has not consulted beforehand with member countries , as is customary . 
[ORG EU  ] members have warned [LOC Sweden  ] not to give preferential treatment to [LOC Iceland  ] because it is a " [MISC Nordic  ] brother . 
" [LOC Sweden  ] , and [PER Bildt  ] , would very much like [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership to be one of the accomplishments of its [ORG EU  ] Presidency , but [LOC Iceland  ] 's glacial movement on its application is dampening expectations. -- ( U ) [MISC Burma:  ] The verdict in the trial of [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] might be known on July 24 . 
In this case , the [ORG EU  ] will need to respond . 
In the event of a guilty verdict , then the only response all [ORG EU  ] members unanimously support , according to [PER Wendel  ] , is to blacklist the four trial judges . 
Other ideas being floated , but lacking consensus , are to expand the list of banned luxury items and to limit sectoral investments by [ORG EU  ] businesses . 
If there is no verdict , then the [ORG EU  ] will issue a statement. -- ( U ) [MISC North Korea:  ] The [ORG GAERC  ] will produce a paper regarding the new set of sanctions under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1874 . 
Normally , a [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution should be adopted by the [ORG EU  ] within 45 days , said [PER Wendel  ] . 
There already is some agreement on the core set of new sanctions under [ORG UNSCR  ] 1874 , but the [ORG Council  ] must agree whenever a common position is changed . 
[PER Wendel  ] noted that [LOC Sweden  ] opposes [LOC France  ] 's proposed expansion of the list of luxury goods banned for export to the [LOC DPRK  ] , but discussion on that topic is ongoing .
