( C ) SUMMARY: [ORG Chevron  ] and [MISC Repsol-led  ] consortia won the rights to negotiate mixed company deals with the [ORG Ministry of Energy and Petroleum  ] ( [ORG MENPET  ] ) in the [ORG Carabobo  ] bid round . 
In its first major heavy oil bid round since President [PER Chavez  ] assumed power in 1999 , the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) offered three [ORG Carabobo  ] projects and received bids on two . 
While not signing any agreements , the winning international consortia may now move ahead to negotiate more favorable contract terms before signature of a joint venture contract and the initial bonus payment . 
[ORG Chevron  ] said that first oil might come on line in 2014 but could well be delayed . 
The Ambassador was not invited to the [ORG Carabobo  ] ceremony to accompany his colleagues representing the governments of the other international oil companies that bid . 
Nevertheless , at the ceremony , [PER Chavez  ] said he wants dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] END SUMMARY . 
[MISC Carabobo Winners Announced  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) PROJECT 3: The February 10 ceremonial event to announce the winners in the [ORG Carabobo  ] bid round started several hours late and was televised in a mandatory national cadena ( broadcast ) . 
The [MISC Chevron-led  ] consortia , including [LOC Japan  ] 's [ORG Mitsubishi  ] , [ORG Inpex  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG Suelopetrol  ] , won project 3 , which includes blocks C5 , C2 [LOC South  ] , and [LOC C3 North  ] . 
[ORG Chevron  ] 's share in the ultimate joint venture will be 34% , the [MISC Japanese  ] participants will have 5% , and [ORG Suelopetrol  ] will have a 1% share . 
[ NOTE: [ORG Chevron  ] 's [ORG Latin America Business Unit  ] President [PER Wes Lohec  ] ( protect ) told the Ambassador on February 12 that [LOC Japan  ] 's [ORG JOGMC  ] has an option to back into a share of the [MISC Japanese  ] 5% . 
The [MISC Japanese  ] participation in the consortium is particularly important , as it will open the door to possible [ORG JBIC  ] financing for [ORG PDVSA  ] 's portion of the project costs . 
END NOTE ] Minister [PER Ramirez  ] stated that the mixed company ( 60% [ORG PDVSA  ] , 40% [ORG Chevron  ] consortia ) should eventually produce between 400,000 and 480,000 barrels of crude petroleum per day . 
When half of the production is run through an upgrader and mixed with the other half of production , the mixed company will ultimately take 400,000 barrels of 22-degree [ORG API  ] crude to the market . 
[PER Ramirez  ] stated that the [ORG Chevron  ] consortium offered a bonus of $500 million , a billion dollars of financing for [ORG PDVSA  ] 's portion of the project , and an upgrader to be constructed in [LOC Soldedad  ] . 
[PER Lohec  ] informed the Ambassador on February 12 that cold crude oil production could begin as soon as four years from the date a mixed company is formed and that [ORG MENPET  ] had committed to provide 300 million barrels of blending stock for the first seven years of the project or until an upgrader is constructed . 
[PER Lohec  ] added that he doubted whether [ORG PDVSA  ] would achieve any new petroleum production from any of the various heavy oil projects it has initiated with national oil companies before 2014. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) PROJECT 1: [PER Ramirez  ] also announced that the consortium led by [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Repsol  ] , including [LOC India  ] 's [ORG ONGC  ] , [ORG Videsh Limited  ] , [ORG Oil Indian Corporation  ] , the [ORG Indian Oil Corporation  ] , and [LOC Malaysia  ] 's [ORG Petronas  ] , won [ORG Carabobo  ] 's project 1 . 
This includes the blocks [LOC C1 North  ] , and [ORG C1 Central  ] . 
According to [PER Ramirez  ] , [ORG Repsol  ] 's consortium offered a bonus of $1.050 billion , $1.0 billion in financing for [ORG PDVSA  ] 's portion of the project , and an upgrader in [LOC Soledad  ] . 
[PER Ramirez  ] stated that this mixed company would also produce up to 480,000 barrels/day of upgraded petroleum at 22 degrees [ORG API  ] . 
[ORG Repsol  ] 's proposal included plans to send some of the upgraded petroleum to a refinery in [LOC Bilbao  ] , [LOC Spain  ] and " other plants in other countries . 
" [PER Ramirez  ] stated that the mixed company agreements now to be negotiated with the two consortia would be sent to the [ORG Venezuelan National Assembly  ] for approval on March 25 . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00000193 002 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) PROJECT 2: According to [PER Ramirez  ] , the [ORG GBRV  ] did not receive any offers on project 2 and that it would be up to President [PER Chavez  ] whether [LOC Venezuela  ] would develop it on its own or put it back out to bid in the future. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) BONUS ? : [ORG Chevron  ] 's consortium offered the minimum bonus for project 3 ( the other two projects had a minimum bonus of $1 billion ) . 
[ORG Repsol  ] 's consortium offered $50 million more than the minimum bonus payment . 
Given that project 3 ( [ORG Chevron  ] ) contained three blocks and project 1 ( [ORG Repsol  ] ) contained two blocks , the consortia respectively offered $167 million/block and $500 million/block . 
By contrast , in the bilateral deals announced by the [ORG GBRV  ] for heavy oil projects in the [LOC Junin  ] area of the [LOC Orinoco  ] heavy oil belt , the press has reported that [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG Eni  ] offered a $646 million bonus for [ORG Junin  ] 5 , [ORG PetroVietnam  ] offered a bonus between $500 and $600 million , and the [MISC Russian  ] oil consortium ( [ORG Rosneft  ] , [ORG Lukoil  ] , [ORG Gazprom  ] , [ORG TNK-BP  ] , and [ORG Surgutneftegaz  ] ) offered $1 billion for [ORG Junin  ] 6 . 
Embassy contacts reiterate that , regardless of the [ORG GBRV  ] announcements , no company has yet made a bonus payment to the [ORG GBRV  ] . 
The [ORG Carabobo  ] terms require the first installment of the bonus payment 14 days after the mixed company documents are approved by the international consortia 's boards of directors and by the [ORG Venezuelan National Assembly  ] . 
Thus , the [ORG GBRV  ] will not receive any bonus funds from the [ORG Repsol  ] or [MISC Chevron-led  ] consortia until the mixed companies have been negotiated and approved. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Mixed Company Formation: On February 11 , [ORG Chevron  ] President for [LOC Africa  ] and [ORG Latin America Ali  ] [PER Moshiri  ] clarified for the Ambassador that the winning consortia had not won blocks or projects , but rather the right to negotiate an agreement to form mixed companies to produce crude oil . 
He described the February 10 ceremony presided over by President [PER Chavez  ] as a " symbolic event " and said that meeting the March 25 deadline for submission of the mixed company agreement to the [ORG National Assembly  ] would be " magic . 
" He noted that on [ORG Chevron  ] 's part , any agreement would have to be approved by its [ORG Executive Committee and Board of Directors  ] . 
Given that its Board of Directors meets monthly , it would be unrealistic for [ORG Chevron  ] to approve a mixed company deal before March 25 . 
Many unresolved issues remain to be negotiated , including royalty and tax rates , windfall profits taxes , shadow tax payments , etc . 
( see Reftel ) . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] wants the upgraders constructed in [LOC Soledad  ] , but [PER Moshiri  ] said that the geographic location of [LOC Soledad  ] makes the economics of the upgrader untenable . 
He noted that he has talked to [PER Chavez  ] privately about this issue. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) To Bid or Not to [PER Bid: Lohec  ] described [ORG Chevron  ] 's basic calculus on whether or not to bid on [ORG Carabobo  ] as an assessment of the likelihood of success in future negotiations with the [ORG GBRV  ] . 
[ORG Chevron  ] believes " it has a strong hand to play to get to where we need to be , " said [PER Lohec  ] , a decision that other companies could not make . 
He added that [ORG Chevron  ] is confident it will successfully negotiate favorable terms for the formation of a mixed company with [ORG PDVSA  ] . 
[PER Lohec  ] added that [ORG MENPET  ] has already agreed to allow the new mixed company to lift crude petroleum shipments as dividend payments ( a scheme [ORG Chevron  ] has developed over the past year in its mixed company operating [MISC PetroBoscan  ] ) . 
He noted that due to the phased payment plan for the bonuses , [ORG Chevron  ] will only pay [ORG MENPET  ] $100 million upon signing the documents to form a mixed company and that the other four installment payments are linked to project milestones , effectively limiting risk exposure . 
[PER Lohec  ] underlined that the [ORG GBRV  ] needs [ORG Chevron  ] 's expertise because it " is headed down a path that is disastrous for them . 
" In the end , the [MISC Venezuelans  ] need to produce oil to generate revenue . 
Finally , [PER Lohec  ] noted that [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000193 003 OF 003 new projects in [LOC Iraq  ] likely played into [ORG BP  ] and [ORG Shell  ] 's calculus not to bid in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Since [ORG Chevron  ] does not have any projects in [LOC Iraq  ] and is " already big in [LOC Venezuela  ] , " it decided to continue forward here . 
Separately , [PER Lohec  ] told Petroleum [ORG AttachC  ] ) that [ORG BP  ] and [ORG Shell  ] might decide to shut down operations in [LOC Venezuela  ] - that it all depends on whether limited operations here are profitable or not and how long a timeline they are working with , noting that [ORG Shell  ] usually works with a 20-year timeframe . 
[PER Lohec  ] added as an aside that [ORG Chevron  ] continues negotiations to convert an exploration and certification project in the [ORG Ayacucho  ] 8 block of the [LOC Faja  ] into a production expansion adjacent to its current PetroPiar mixed company . 
[ NOTE: [ORG Ayacucho  ] 8 does not appear on recent [ORG PDVSA  ] maps . 
END NOTE ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Chevron  ] 's View on [MISC U.S.-Venezuelan Bilateral Relations:  ] [PER Moshiri  ] expressed surprise that the Ambassador did not receive an invitation to the [ORG Carabobo  ] announcement ceremony . 
[ NOTE: Ambassadors or other diplomats from the home countries of the other winning oil companies attended the event . 
END NOTE ] In his opening remarks in the televised portion of the event , President [PER Chavez  ] stated his desire to establish a dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] administration . 
On the margins of the event , he noted to [PER Moshiri  ] his desire to see the [ORG Houston Astros  ] play in [LOC Texas  ] , but added that political realities make a visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] impossible . 
[ NOTE: In response , [PER Moshiri  ] offered a courtesy invitation for [PER Chavez  ] to visit [ORG Chevron  ] in [LOC Houston  ] . 
END NOTE ] [PER Moshiri  ] told the Ambassador that [ORG Chevron  ] would press the [ORG GBRV  ] to extend an invitation to the Ambassador to attend any future signing ceremony for the mixed company deal . 
He also said he would raise the [ORG GBRV  ] 's failure to invite the Ambassador to the [ORG Carabobo  ] ceremony the next time he spoke with Ambassador [PER Alvarez  ] . 
[PER Moshiri  ] noted , however , that he believes that [PER Alvarez  ] now has less access to [PER Chavez  ] . 
Finally , [PER Moshiri  ] said that [PER Alvarez  ] had made it clear that all decisions regarding the bilateral relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] are elevated to [PER Chavez  ] . 
The Ambassador underlined to [PER Moshiri  ] that the USG has made every effort to re-establish a dialogue with the [ORG GBRV  ] . 
In fact , he said , the Embassy had been waiting for months for a response from the [ORG GBRV  ] to Diplomatic Notes responding to [ORG GBRV  ] interest in a dialogue on energy issues as well as the invitation from Energy Secretary [PER Chu  ] to attend the April Energy and [ORG Climate Ministerial  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] . 
[PER Moshiri  ] commented that Energy Minister [PER Ramirez  ] would not take the risk of responding to these initiatives without a decision from [LOC Chavez.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: The [ORG GBRV  ] and media portrayals of the [ORG Carabobo  ] ceremony are misleading as no deals were signed . 
With the leverage the international companies now have in negotiations with the [ORG GBRV  ] , we would not expect to see any deals signed by late March as the companies will take the time they need to secure favorable terms . 
A potential new [ORG Chevron  ] deal would solidify its position as the [ORG GBRV  ] 's largest and most important international partner . 
[ORG Repsol  ] has been a relatively minor partner with [ORG PDVSA  ] and the [MISC Indian  ] companies are not currently involved in any projects in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Their lack of experience raises questions about the potential success and ability to move project 1 forward . 
In the event that new mixed companies are formed , it will be the first time the [PER Chavez  ] administration and its [ORG Energy Ministry  ] and [ORG PDVSA  ] have developed , executed , and operated a production project of this magnitude . 
Many here are skeptical about their ability to do so . 
In the past , [LOC Venezuela  ] allowed the major international oil companies to engineer , build , and operate the projects . 
Since nationalization of the sector in 2007 , [ORG PDVSA  ] has failed to maintain and or expand production . 
END COMMENT .
