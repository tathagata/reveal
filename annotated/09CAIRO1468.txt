Blome  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
KEY POINTS -- ( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG NDP  ] insider and former minister Dr. [PER Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki  ] dismissed public and media speculation about succession . 
He said [MISC Egyptian  ] military and security services would ensure a smooth transfer of power , even to a civilian. -- ( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dessouki  ] called opposition parties weak and democracy a " long term goal . 
" He said that the [ORG MB  ] had no legitimate political role , adding that mixing religion and politics in [LOC Egypt  ] was not wise and would not be permitted. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [PER Dessouki  ] is an [ORG NDP  ] insider who has held a number of key positions . 
His assurances that the [MISC Egyptian  ] military and security services would ensure a smooth succession to a civilian ( by implication [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] ) were unusually straightforward and blunt . 
The idea that the military remains a key political and economic force is conventional wisdom here . 
However , other observers tell us that the military has grown less influential , more fractured and its leadership weaker in recent years ( reftel ) . 
They suggest that in a succession scenario in which President [PER Mubarak  ] is no longer present , outcomes are less predictable . 
End comment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On July 22 , [PER PolOff  ] met with [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) Media Secretary , and member of the influential [ORG NDP Policies Committee  ] Dr. [PER Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki  ] . 
Without prompting , he offered newly-arrived [PER PolOff  ] advice on how to approach political issues in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
He counseled [PER PolOff  ] not to " run around " town asking questions about [LOC Egypt  ] 's next leader , suggesting that most offered only opinions not facts . 
He said that this kind of wide-ranging engagement " by our friends " demonstrated a certain " naivete . 
" [PER Dessouki  ] suggested that [PER PolOff  ] also steer clear of the many uncorroborated reports and misguided analysis in the local media . 
He also underscored a common [ORG NDP  ] refrain that [LOC Egypt  ] 's opposition political parties were weak and self-serving. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Dr. [PER Dessouki  ] 's most important message , he said was to always keep in mind that " the real center of power in [LOC Egypt  ] is the military , " a reference he said included all security forces . 
[PER Dessouki  ] noted that while the military did not intervene directly in matters of day to day governance , it leaders were determined to maintain order and that the importance of a " legal transition " should not be underestimated . 
[PER Dessouki  ] did acknowledge that the military is concerned about maintaining its " corporate interests , " but was emphatic in his declaration of their commitment to a " constitutional " transition of power . 
[PER Dessouki  ] went on to say that the military has " no objection to a civilian " as the next president ( a remark that can be interpreted as a pointed reference to [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] ) . 
[PER Dessouki  ] then reiterated that the [ORG NDP  ] has not yet selected its candidate for the 2011 presidential elections ( a point [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] himself has made to us ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dessouki  ] acknowledged there would be some violence around the upcoming 2010 parliamentary and 2011 presidential elections , but suggested security forces would be able to keep it under control . 
Widespread politically-motivated unrest , he said , was not likely because it was not part of the " [MISC Egyptian  ] mentality . 
" Threats to daily survival , not politics , were the only thing to bring [MISC Egyptians  ] to the streets en masse . 
[PER Dessouki  ] said the [ORG NDP  ] focus on economic reform would continue up to the elections and after any transition of power . 
He added that [LOC Egypt  ] was moving towards democracy , but that a transition from a " pharoanic " political system would take a long time. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Disdainful of its political import , [PER Dessouki  ] said the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ( [ORG MB  ] ) was not a credible political organization . 
As evidence of their pure self-interest , he cited the [ORG MB  ] 's refusal to " integrate " and become a part of the mainstream political process despite invitations from the last three [MISC Egyptian  ] presidents . 
[PER Dessouki  ] referred to recent arrests of [ORG MB  ] members ( septel ) as evidence they operated extra-legally . 
( [PER Note: Separately  ] , on July 26 [PER Dessouki  ] publically denied press reports that the [ORG NDP  ] is pursuing a deal with the [ORG MB  ] that would promise an end to the arrests in exchange for a stop to [ORG MB  ] " internal and external " activities . 
End note . 
) [PER Dessouki  ] warned that because [MISC Egyptians  ] are very religious people , politics and religion is a volatile mix . 
In a more strident tone , [PER Dessouki  ] went on to say that he , and President [PER Mubarak  ] , " would not tolerate " the existence of [LOC CAIRO  ] 00001468 002 OF 002 political parties with a religious agenda whether [ORG Muslim  ] or [PER Christian  ] and suggested that there was no such thing as a " moderate [MISC Islamist  ] .
