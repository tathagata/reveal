( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a March 7 lunch with [MISC Spanish  ] Minister of Interior [PER Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  ] , Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] heard the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's defense of its recent controversial decision to allow convicted [ORG ETA  ] assassin [PER Inaki De Juana Chaos  ] to serve out the rest of his sentence under house arrest ( see REFTEL for Embassy analysis on this issue ) . 
[PER De Juana  ] was close to death due to a 4-month hunger strike , and Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] said that the decision was the correct one because it allowed the [ORG GOS  ] to prevent [PER De Juana  ] from becoming a " decades-long martyr for radical [ORG ETA  ] youth . 
" He said the [ORG GOS  ] was solely responsible for the decision , without any discussion with or pressure from [ORG ETA  ] . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] also said that [ORG ETA  ] had the power to put the opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) " in the driver 's seat " by assassinating one or more individuals of consequential [ORG PP  ] rank or position , but was unsure if [ORG ETA  ] leaders would want to do this . 
The Interior Minister said , responding to our request , he was closely following developments on the [PER Couso  ] case and the [ORG CIA  ] flights issue , and was eager to see a cooling of [MISC Spanish  ] emotions in both cases . 
Finally , [PER Rubalcaba  ] asked the Ambassador for further reasons behind the postponement of the proposed March visit to [LOC Madrid  ] by Secretary Rice . 
The Minister expressed appreciation for his meetings with the Ambassador , as opportunities to exchange ideas and gain perspective . 
End Summary. //GOS Decision Saved Lives// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Rubalcaba  ] told the Ambassador that the decision to allow convicted [ORG ETA  ] assassin [PER Inaki De Juana Chaos  ] to serve the remaining 18 months of his sentence at home under house arrest was the correct one . 
( Embassy Note: On March 1 , incarcerated [ORG ETA  ] member [PER Inaki De Juana Chaos  ] was released from the [LOC Madrid  ] hospital where he was being treated for a hunger strike and was transferred to a hospital in [LOC San Sebastian  ] . 
When he has recovered from the affects of the 4-month hunger strike , he will be allowed to complete his sentence at home under police surveillance . 
[PER De Juana  ] had almost completed 17 years of a 30-year sentence for the murder of 18 individuals when he became eligible for early release in 2005 . 
A [ORG National Court  ] magistrate blocked [PER De Juana  ] 's release in 2005 by charging him with writing letters threatening prison officials , and [PER De Juana  ] was later sentenced to an additional 12 years behind bars . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] in February 2007 reduced that sentence to 3 years , leaving only 18 months remaining due to time already served , and setting the stage for the government 's decision to release him ) . 
Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] said that his government knew the decision would be controversial , but that government officials had not done a good job explaining to the [MISC Spanish  ] people that [PER De Juana  ] had already served his time for the murders , and remained in prison only on the lesser charge of making threatening statements . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] confided to the Ambassador that as the end of [PER De Juana  ] 's murder sentence drew near in 2005 , the Minister of Justice at that time did not want to see the convicted assassin go free . 
He thus sought to slap on an additional charge--albeit an obscure one with flimsy merits--that would continue the [ORG ETA  ] member 's incarceration . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] said that in hindsight , it would have been better to allow [PER De Juana  ] to go free in 2005 and that now the [PER Zapatero Government  ] was " paying the price " for that decision. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Rubalcaba  ] said that at the time of [PER De Juana  ] 's release , the [ORG ETA  ] member was just hours away from suffering medically irreversible damage due to his hunger strike , and would have died in a short time if the [ORG GOS  ] had not acted . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] 's view is that the decision to release [PER De Juana  ] saved [MISC Spanish  ] lives by avoiding his transformation into a " decades-long martyr for radical [ORG ETA  ] youth . 
" [PER Rubalcaba  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] was solely responsible for the decision , without any discussion with or pressure from [ORG ETA  ] . 
The Minister told the Ambassador that despite the [PER De Juana  ] case becoming a rallying cry for [ORG ETA  ] members in recent weeks , current [ORG ETA  ] leaders have no use for him in the organization and will not want anything to do with him once he is freed . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] posited that [PER De Juana  ] will likely retire to [LOC Morocco  ] upon his release. //ETA Could Put [ORG PP  ] in Driver Seat// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to broader [ORG ETA  ] issues , the Minister discussed the virulent reaction to the [PER De Juana  ] decision by the main opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] told the [ORG MADRID  ] 00000449 002.2 OF 003 Ambassador that the [ORG GOS  ] knows [ORG ETA  ] could " put the [ORG PP  ] in the driver 's seat " in advance of regional elections in May and national elections in early 2008 by assassinating one or more individuals of important [ORG PP  ] rank or position . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] quickly said his government is unsure whether current [ORG ETA  ] leaders would risk taking this step , but the fear is that any [ORG ETA  ] sympathizer would have the power to change the political calculus in [LOC Spain  ] with one rash act . 
In discussing the December 30 [ORG ETA  ] bombing at [LOC Madrid  ] 's [LOC Barajas  ] airport that killed two individuals , [PER Rubalcaba  ] said that act proved the [ORG ETA  ] hard-liners had won out over those favoring moderation , and derailed the peace process . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] said that [ORG ETA  ] 's political front group [ORG Batasuna  ] is still working every angle to try and gain permission to run in [MISC Basque  ] municipal elections in May , but the [LOC Barajas  ] bombing has made that scenario even more problematic. //Bilateral Issues// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador expressed his appreciation to Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] for the strong level of counterterrorism cooperation , specifically the development of the Bilateral [ORG Counterterrorism Working Group  ] . 
He said the working group is an effective vehicle to improve judicial efforts against terrorism in both countries . 
The Ambassador also reiterated USG support for [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts in fighting terrorism and said that the ongoing trial of individuals allegedly involved in the March 11 , 2004 [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings highlights the continued threat facing both of our countries . 
When the Ambassador conveyed continued [ORG Department and National Security Council  ] interest in the possible terrorist designation of [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] , [PER Rubalcaba  ] replied that he was aware that this was still a pending issue between our governments and knows that it needs to be addressed . 
The Minister told the Ambassador that responding to our request , he was also following developments on the [PER Jose Couso  ] case ( the [MISC Spanish  ] TV cameraman killed in the [LOC Palestine Hotel  ] incident in [LOC Iraq  ] ) and the [ORG CIA  ] flights issue that have been the subject of much sensational press coverage in [LOC Spain  ] in recent weeks . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] said that although the [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary was fiercely independent and would do what it thought was right , [PER Rubalcaba  ] had instructed his staff to avoid any inflammatory rhetorical comments in an attempt to lower the temperature on these issues. //S Visit to [MISC Madrid//  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] pressed the Ambassador for the " real reason " why the Secretary postponed her proposed March visit to [LOC Spain  ] . 
The Ambassador replied that the postponement was purely for scheduling reasons due to the Secretary 's planned travel and had nothing to do with any problems in the bilateral relationship . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] noted that the Secretary 's recent phone call with Foreign Minister [PER SIPDIS Moratinos  ] , informing him that she needed to testify in [ORG Congress  ] on March 28 , confirmed what the Ambassador had said . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] seemed satisfied with the answer . 
The Ambassador reminded [PER Rubalcaba  ] that if sectors of the [MISC Spanish  ] Government continue to insist that there are signs of a deteriorating bilateral relationship when no signs exist , they run the risk of reversing some of the improvements made in the relationship over the past two years . 
Although the [ORG GOS  ] has not confirmed the Secretary 's new proposed visit date of June 1 , [PER Rubalcaba  ] raised the possibility of the [ORG GOS  ] eventually making some kind of statement confirming the visit . 
The Ambassador suggested to [PER Rubalcaba  ] that for security and logistical reasons , it was probably not wise to confirm the exact date of such a visit three months out , and the Minister agreed with the reasoning . 
( Note: [MISC Embassy  ] is working with [LOC Washington  ] , at the request of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MFA  ] , to develop some kind of public statement indicating that S had planned to visit in March , is committed to coming to [LOC Spain  ] , and that dates are being worked out . 
[ORG MFA  ] would like to publicize a precise date for a rescheduled visit , but this issue is under discussion between the Embassy and [LOC Washington  ] . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] said he was weighed down with the issues currently facing him and remarked that he " felt the weight of [LOC Spain  ] on his shoulders . 
" He is currently living above the Ministry due to repairs and refurbishment occurring at his house and said that living so close to the office made it hard to " disconnect " : that he is having trouble sleeping at night . 
Although he shows no outward signs of stress , the events since the December 30 [ORG ETA  ] bombing have clearly taken a toll . 
The Minister said that he appreciated opportunities such as these to exchange ideas and gain perspective and hopes they will continue .
