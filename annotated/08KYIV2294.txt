( C ) Summary . 
[PER Dmitry Firtash  ] , one of [LOC Ukraine’s  ] most wealthy and notorious oligarchs , plans to buy a controlling stake in [LOC Nadra Bank  ] , [LOC Ukraine’s  ] seventh largest bank . 
The acquisition of [ORG Nadra  ] , which will join [MISC Firtash’s  ] international holding company ( Group DF ) when the deal is final , would be [MISC Firtash’s  ] first foray into [LOC Ukraine’s  ] banking sector . 
The purchase of [LOC Nadra Bank  ] continues a recent trend on [MISC Firtash’s  ] part to diversify his asset base beyond [LOC Ukraine’s  ] politically risky energy sector . 
He may also hope to use [ORG Nadra  ] to service Group DF subsidiaries , or he may simply see the bank as a financial investment , bought on the cheap in a time of crisis , that can be sold once economic conditions improve . 
Before establishing himself as a billionaire gas trader in the late 1990s , [PER Firtash  ] managed a failing food processing company . 
He later broke into the gas trade and established himself as an intermediary through connections to key [MISC Ukrainian  ] officials and reportedly to [MISC Russian  ] organized crime figure [PER Semyon Mogilevich  ] . 
As co-owner of gas intermediary [ORG RosUkrEnergo  ] ( [ORG RUE  ] ) , [PER Firtash  ] is widely believed to be serving as a front man for far broader interests . 
In the case of [ORG Nadra  ] , [PER Firtash  ] is sufficiently cash-rich to finance the purchase on his own , but the suspicion remains that in his major business dealings he remains at least politically indebted to the forces that helped him rise so quickly . 
End Summary . 
Despite Crisis , [PER Firtash  ] Moves Into Banking ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Firtash’s  ] international holding company Group [PER Dmitry Firtash  ] , or Group DF , in early November announced intentions to acquire a controlling stake in [LOC Nadra Bank  ] , marking [MISC Firtash’s  ] first bank acquisition . 
The [ORG National Bank of Ukraine  ] ( [ORG NBU  ] ) propped up [ORG Nadra  ] with a [MISC UAH  ] 3.6 billion ( $609 million ) loan after a run on its deposits ostensibly caused a liquidity crisis at the bank . 
Various explanations as to the cause of [MISC Nadra’s  ] problems have circulated in the media , but an [MISC Embassy  ] contact told us on November 17 that [LOC Nadra Bank  ] did not actually have any liquidity problems until its competitors began spreading rumors about [MISC Nadra’s  ] financial stability . 
In any case , a liquidity crunch at [ORG Nadra  ] ensued and the [ORG NBU  ] pressured [ORG Nadra  ] to sell a controlling stake of its shares . 
No final terms of the Group DF deal have been concluded -- it is scheduled to be completed within the next few weeks -- but Group DF reportedly could pay as little as $50 million for an 86.7 percent stake in [ORG Nadra  ] . 
According to one [LOC Nadra Bank  ] stakeholder , [LOC Nadra Bank  ] could have been sold for [MISC UAH  ] 21.3 billion ( $4.23 billion ) before Ukraine’s recent financial problems began. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Nadra  ] is the second [MISC Ukrainian  ] bank after [PER Prominvestbank  ] ( Ref B ) to change hands in the weeks since the financial crisis erupted in [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
In both cases , stakeholders in the banks and many other market participants claim that the runs on the banks were orchestrated . 
In addition , in both cases cash-rich [MISC Ukrainian  ] business interests with no significant banking holders got the [ORG NBU  ] nod to take a controlling stake in the bank ( brothers and [ORG Party of Regions  ] deputies [ORG Sergei  ] and [PER Andriy Kluyev  ] are universally assumed to have bought [PER Prominvestbank  ] , although they have yet to openly acknowledge the purchase . 
) While many market commentators question whether such investors are ideally suited to introduce the management and banking know-how that the banks need to restructure in difficult times , it is acknowledged that the [ORG NBU  ] did not have much choice if it wanted to sell the banks quickly . 
Other banks , both foreign and domestic , are struggling with their own problems , and foreign banks in particular would have needed far more time to conduct a thorough due diligence . 
Many of our banking contacts also criticize what they say is the non-transparant manner in which the [ORG NBU  ] sold off the two banks. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Group DF’s CEO , [PER Robert Shelter-Jones  ] , has said that [ORG Nadra Bank  ] complements Group DF’s strategy to diversify its asset base and that Group DF’s businesses probably will become important [ORG Nadra Bank  ] customers . 
[ORG Nadra Bank  ] could also help [PER Firtash  ] develop his [MISC Ukrainian  ] businesses . 
Although [ORG Nadra  ] mainly is geared toward retail business , it could be restructured to service corporate clients , such as Group DF’s current subsidiaries , according to some experts . 
Others , however , contend that because [ORG Nadra  ] specializes in servicing small clients , Group DF is unlikely to use [ORG Nadra  ] for Group DF subsidiaries . 
It is also possible that [PER Firtash  ] sees [ORG Nadra Bank  ] as a pure financial investment , bought on the cheap at a time of crisis in the hope of reselling it once conditions in [LOC Ukraine’s  ] banking sector improve . 
What Exactly is Group DF ? ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Established in June 2007 , Group DF is an international holding company comprising energy , chemicals , real estate , and construction firms in [LOC Eastern  ] and [LOC Central Europe  ] . 
Combined revenues of Group DF’s subsidiaries in 2006 totaled $4.6 billion . 
The most infamous of Group DF’s assets is [ORG RosUkrEnergo  ] ( [ORG RUE  ] ) , the non-transparent natural gas intermediary that handles gas transactions for [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
Gas intermediaries , such as [ORG RUE  ] and its predecessors EuralTransGas ( [ORG ETG  ] ) and [ORG Itera  ] , have benefited well-connected businessmen such as [PER Firtash  ] and have not always served an obvious economic purpose . 
( Note: In 2002 , [ORG ETG  ] was established with four employees in a [MISC Hungarian  ] village . 
[ORG ETG  ] that same year replaced [ORG Itera  ] and secured exclusive rights to supply [MISC Turkmen  ] gas to [LOC Ukraine  ] , reportedly clearing $760 million in profits in 2003 ; [PER Firtash  ] later claimed to be ETG’s founder . 
[ORG RUE  ] replaced [ORG ETG  ] and reportedly generated more than $7 billion in 2006 . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Gazprom  ] owns 50 percent of [ORG RUE  ] , while [PER Firtash  ] and fellow [MISC Ukrainian  ] businessman [PER Ivan Fursin  ] -- through Group DF company [ORG Centragas Holding AG  ] -- control 45 and 5 percent stakes , respectively . 
[MISC Ukrainian  ] media have reported , however , that [PER Semyon Mogilevich  ] , a [MISC Russian  ] organized crime ( [ORG ROC  ] ) figure wanted by the [ORG FBI  ] and currently in custody in [LOC Russia  ] , has long been linked to [MISC Firtash’s  ] business activities . 
[PER Firtash’s Ascent  ] , the [ORG Mogilevich Connection  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Ukrainian  ] media have reported widely on how [PER Firtash  ] got his start in energy through a network of personal connections to some of the biggest players in [LOC Ukraine’s  ] gas sector . 
These included [PER Ihor Bakay  ] , founder and former Chairman of [ORG Naftohaz Ukrainy  ] , [PER Yuriy Boyko  ] , the [ORG Party of Regions  ] deputy and former Fuel and Energy Minister , and [PER Oleksandr Volkov  ] , a former Prime Minister and [PER Kuchma  ] advisor . 
Before entering the gas trade business [PER Firtash  ] with his spouse reportedly owned a canned food company called [ORG KMIL  ] . 
By the end of the 1990s [ORG KMIL  ] was in deep financial trouble . 
[PER Firtash  ] subsequently broke into the gas trade business as “food for gas” barter schemes between [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] increased when [LOC Ukraine  ] did not have sufficient foreign exchange to pay for its gas imports . 
[MISC Firtash’s  ] firms delivered food products to [MISC Central Asian  ] suppliers and received gas in return . 
They subsequently sold the gas on [LOC Ukraine’s  ] domestic market for domestic currency , or through other , often complex barter schemes. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This barter business established [PER Firtash  ] as a gas trader , and the subsequent growth in the business brought to light his reported ties with [PER Mogilevich  ] . 
The two have been linked through ostensible joint holdings in off-shore vehicles , and through mutual personal relationships . 
In May 2000 , for example , Firtash’s [ORG KMIL  ] received a license to sell natural gas at unregulated prices . 
A company called [ORG Highrock Holding Ltd  ] was registered in [LOC Cyprus  ] in 2001 to facilitate this business . 
[PER Firtash  ] and his spouse together reportedly owned 33 percent of [ORG Highrock  ] . 
About 34 percent of [ORG Highrock  ] was owned by a firm called [ORG Agatheas Trading Ltd  ] . 
[PER Semyon Mogilevich’s  ] ex-wife , [PER Galina Telesh  ] , reportedly was the director of [ORG Agatheas Trading  ] from 2001 to 2003 . 
[PER Firtash  ] in 2003 became the director of [ORG Agatheas Trading  ] . 
In addition , [PER Firtash  ] and [PER Mogilevich  ] also have shared the same lawyer , [PER Zeev Gordon  ] , also known as [PER Vladimir Averbukh  ] , to represent their business and personal interests . 
Moreover , [MISC Ukrainian  ] media report that former [MISC Hungarian  ] Minister of Culture [PER Andras Knopp  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX became business partners with the [MISC Firtashs  ] when [PER Dmitry Firtash  ] periodically resided in [LOC Germany  ] during the 1990s . 
[PER Knopp  ] reportedly is the managing director of EuralTransGas . 
Group DF’s Assets , Besides [ORG RUE  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) After establishing a presence in [LOC Ukraine’s  ] non-transparent gas trade , [PER Firtash  ] and his associates began acquiring assets outside of [LOC Ukraine’s  ] energy sector . 
Group DF probably recognized that while the gas intermediary business is very lucrative , the need for diversification in [LOC Ukraine  ] is key , given that the political risks involved are very high . 
Prime Minister [PER Yuliya Tymoshenko  ] , for example , has called for the elimination of all gas middlemen and [ORG Gazprom  ] Press Secretary [PER Sergei Kuprianov  ] on November 17 said that [ORG Gazprom  ] next year would supply gas to [LOC Ukraine  ] directly , suggesting gas intermediaries could be on their way out. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In [LOC Ukraine’s  ] chemicals sector , Group DF subsidiary [ORG OstChem Holding AG  ] owns a little less than half of [LOC Crimean Titan  ] , one of [LOC Europe’s  ] largest titanium dioxide producers that has distributors throughout the world , including [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Belarus  ] , [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG OstChem  ] this year has struggled with the [MISC Ukrainian  ] [ORG State Property Fund  ] -- the owner of the controlling stake in [LOC Crimean Titan  ] -- for management control . 
In August , however , [ORG OstChem  ] on [LOC Crimean Titan’s  ] behalf successfully secured a 31 million euro ( $45.7 million ) loan from [ORG Commerzbank  ] ( with a guarantee from the [MISC German  ] state export insurance agency ) to build a new sulfuric acid plant . 
[PER Firtash  ] also reportedly owns the [ORG Kyiv Basketball Club  ] and television channels K1 , K2 , and Megasport ; his real estate assets in central [ORG Kyiv  ] alone include the [MISC Arena  ] business complex and the [LOC Mandarin  ] shopping center , both high-end commercial objects in prime locations. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Like other [MISC Ukrainian  ] oligarchs , [MISC Firtash’s  ] holdings are doubtless suffering from the severe economic downturn . 
The purchase of [LOC Nadra Bank  ] , however , indicates that he remains sufficiently cash rich to expand in spite of [LOC Ukraine’s  ] economic and financial troubles . 
The extent to which [ORG Kyiv  ] powerbrokers or underworld figures benefit from [MISC Firtash’s  ] business empire is unclear , but Embassy interlocutors have told us that [ORG Party of Regions  ] recently has turned to close [PER Firtash  ] associates , instead of [MISC Ukrainian  ] oligarch and [ORG Regions  ] deputy [PER Rinat Akhmetov  ] , to finance Regions’ political campaigns ( Ref A ) . 
Given [MISC Firtash’s  ] swift ascent from failing canned foods company manager to multi-billionaire dollar gas magnate , he might still be beholden to the forces that helped him rise so quickly .
