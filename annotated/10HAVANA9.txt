( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
Over the course of the last month the tone coming out of [ORG Havana  ] seems a regression to the hostile language that kept [LOC U.S.  ] - [LOC Cuba  ] relations on ice for much of the last 50 years . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] press is playing it that way , and both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] observers are publicly throwing their hands up in the air in frustration . 
The reality is far more complex , and possibly less pessimistic . 
The most vitriolic language was the result of [LOC Cuba  ] 's , and more specifically [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's , sense of humiliation at being excluded from the negotiating table at [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] would like nothing more than to firewall its civil society from foreigners , but its grumblings over [LOC U.S.  ] observance of [ORG Human Rights Day  ] were par for the course . 
Much more threatening to the regime are our overtures to and complaints of mistreatment of bloggers , a group that frustrates and scares the [ORG GOC  ] like no other . 
The arrest of an Amcit , publicly denounced by President [PER Raul Castro  ] , remains a wild card that could further complicate progress . 
The [ORG GOC  ] remains interested in improving relations and extracting what benefits it can but harbors no unrealistic expectations about a radical shift in [LOC U.S.  ] policy . 
That interest wanes and is subject to the whims of [LOC Cuba  ] , s rulers . 
This gerontocracy would rather abandon improved relations if it feels its political authority undermined . 
END SUMMARY . 
HEATED WORDS OVER CLIMATE CHANGE -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The language coming out of [LOC Havana  ] after the Climate Summit was as incendiary as it has been over the last year and a half . 
[ORG Communist Party  ] boss and former President [PER Fidel Castro  ] railed about the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" deceit " and " arrogance " and his Foreign Minister , upon his return from [LOC Copenhagen  ] , duly repeated the charges at a press conference ( Septel ) . 
The atmosphere became so charged , that retired General [PER Barry McCaffrey  ] called off a 2010 visit to [LOC Cuba  ] in disgust over the " shallow and vitriolic " language that " made the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership appear non-serious , polemical amateurs . 
" The head of the [ORG National Assembly  ] , [PER Ricardo Alarcon  ] , said that he had given up too , and did not expect " big changes in the near future . 
" The international press was quick to declare that the [MISC U.S.-Cuba  ] " honeymoon " was over . 
VERBAL WARMING A STAND-ALONE ISSUE ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Other [MISC Cuban  ] leaders and the official media , however , have refrained from regurgitating , as they often do , the vitriolic language of the elder [PER Castro  ] . 
Many interlocutors , both foreign and [MISC Cuban  ] , believe that [PER Castro  ] 's ( and by extension his Foreign Minister 's ) words constitute a stand-alone tantrum , and are not necessarily reflective of the state of relations between [LOC Cuba  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] The [MISC British  ] and [MISC Danes  ] , for instance , were targeted just as fiercely . 
[PER Castro  ] 's topical obsessions are notorious , and climate change is certainly one of them ( Septel ) . 
Adding insult to injury is the palpable sense of humiliation at seeing the [MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister , and wannabe world leader and surrogate [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , excluded from the final negotiations ( where [LOC Grenada  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] took part ) . 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE [PER CASTRO  ] GERONTOCRACY ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The former President is widely blamed in the island for the regime 's obstinate refusal to change its old ways . 
[ORG HAVANA  ] 00000009 002.2 OF 003 According to many of our contacts , the political and policy paralysis in [LOC Cuba  ] is a reflection of the sway that [PER Castro  ] and his generation of " historicos " ( including his brother and current President [PER Raul  ] ) have over the [ORG GOC  ] . 
According to a [MISC Spanish  ] colleague , [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's word is final on the fate of [LOC Cuba  ] 's political prisoners and the [MISC Spanish  ] had a hard time overcoming [PER Castro  ] 's reluctance to release an ailing 60-year old inmate last fall ( Ref A ) . 
His aim , the [MISC Spaniard  ] claims , is to seek the release of the five [MISC Cuban  ] spies in [LOC U.S.  ] jails . 
The [ORG GOC  ] thus far has refrained publicly from linking the five [MISC Cuban  ] spies to the release of an Amcit detained on December 5 ( Ref B ) . 
EXPLAINING THE ARREST --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Raul Castro  ] himself was the first [MISC Cuban  ] official to have acknowledged the arrest . 
( The only other public statement by officials or in the official press was a January 6 remark about his treatment by [ORG National Assembly  ] President [PER Alarcon  ] in response to questions from the press . 
) Theories about the arrest abound , from an attempt to force high-level attention from [LOC Washington  ] a la [LOC North Korea  ] , to a move to counter the blogger movement ( see paragraph 7 ) . 
However , at his [ORG National Assembly  ] speech on December 20 , President [PER Castro  ] linked the detention to [LOC U.S.  ] democracy programs on the island , deriding the very notion of a [MISC Cuban  ] " civil society " ( Ref C ) . 
Whether that was [PER Castro  ] 's intent or not , the arrest has chilled the atmosphere for democracy programs in [LOC Cuba  ] , especially those that hinged on unfettered and hassle-free travel to the island . 
Thus , the arrest has already served the interests of the authoritarian ruling class . 
It is not clear how the [ORG GOC  ] intends to exact more mileage from the arrest , but if theories about the elder [PER Castro  ] are accurate , he could throw a gigantic wrench in the relationship if he insists on holding the man as a bargaining chip . 
OBJECTIONS OVER [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A third oft-cited example of a deteriorating climate was the [ORG GOC  ] complaints about the diplomatic presence at the [ORG Human Rights Day  ] marches where peaceful protesters were assaulted by state-organized mobs ( Ref D , E ) . 
Although the [ORG GOC  ] would prefer that the international community stay away from civil society engagement , and sometimes it tries to bully nations into silence , it has grown accustomed to the [LOC U.S.  ] and other countries observing these events . 
It could hardly claim surprise when we did , and its " complaints " were delivered in a matter-of-fact manner that belied its purported ire . 
BLOGGER XXXXXXXXXXXX ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The conventional wisdom in [LOC Havana  ] is that [ORG GOC  ] sees the bloggers as its most serious challenge , and one that it has trouble containing in the way that it has dealt with traditional opposition groups . 
The " old guard " dissidents mostly have been isolated from the rest of the island . 
The [ORG GOC  ] doesn't pay much attention to their articles or manifestos because they have no island-wide resonance and limited international heft . 
For a while , ignoring the bloggers too seemed to work . 
But the bloggers' mushrooming international popularity and their ability to stay one tech-step ahead of the authorities are causing serious headaches in the regime . 
The attention that the [LOC United States  ] bestowed on XXXXXXXXXXXX , first by publicly complaining when she was detained and roughed up and later by having the President respond to her questions , further fanned the fears that the blogger problem had gotten out of control . 
OPPORTUNITIES TO WORSEN RELATIONS NOT TAKEN ------------------------------------------- [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000009 003.2 OF 003 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Despite the challenges to the [ORG GOC  ] , s authority , its economic mismanagement and its unwillingness to adapt with the times , the [ORG GOC  ] remains confident and in control . 
A less hostile [LOC United States  ] has helped allay real or imaginary fears that the regime will come under fire if it retreats from the dogmatic stance of years past . 
President [PER Castro  ] acknowledged in December that domestic change was needed , but asked for more time for consultations . 
And , despite his criticism of [LOC U.S.  ] democracy programs , he again called for improved relations ( Ref C ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Moreover , thus far , [LOC Cuba  ] has refrained from going on the warpath . 
Aside from President [PER Castro  ] 's remarks , it has not turned the Amcit 's arrest into an issue of public debate , or taken the elder [PER Castro  ] 's hostile route . 
On at least two recent occasions , the [ORG GOC  ] has passed up opportunities to heighten hostilities . 
In November and again this January , the [ORG GOC  ] complained about [LOC U.S.  ] policies without resorting to hyperbolic language. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In December , the [ORG GOC  ] complained about maritime and airspace incursions ( Ref F ) . 
[ORG Interior Ministry  ] officials were genuinely incensed at the [ORG Coast Guard  ] rescuing of the [MISC American  ] crew of a sailboat that ran aground on alleged [MISC Cuban  ] waters , but in the weeks since the early December incident , cooperation in this area ( perhaps , the most effective and closest of [MISC U.S.-Cuba  ] engagement ) has continued unaffected . 
Likewise , in January , protestations over new flight screening rules affecting all [MISC Cubans  ] did not stop the [ORG GOC  ] from granting access to legal teams from the [LOC U.S.  ] to depose [MISC Cuban  ] witnesses in a TIP case or from continuing to review a full agenda of meetings , including the [MISC Migration Talks  ] in February . 
RESTRAINT LIKELY , BUT PROGRESS LIMITED -------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOC  ] has no reason to eschew the prospect of better relations in the current state of play . 
However , political control is paramount to the current regime , and it will not hesitate to shut the door if it feels its authority undermined . 
The key for the [LOC United States  ] is to continue promoting reform and greater space for [MISC Cubans  ] , while keeping the [ORG GOC  ] engaged and interested in areas where it is of benefit to us .
