[PER EL-HIMMA  ] GOES TO PARLIAMENT: AMBASSADOR'S CALL ON CHAMBER FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HEAD FOUAD ALI EL-HIMMA Classified By: Ambassador [PER Thomas T. Riley  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In a February 13 meeting , prominent parliamentarian and royal confidante [PER Fouad Ali El-Himma  ] discussed with the Ambassador his efforts to better coordinate local , regional and national governance in the poor constituency he represents . 
[PER El-Himma  ] asserted that [LOC Morocco  ] 's legislature has " all the legal authority it needs " and complained bitterly about mismanagement of resources and lack of vision among the parliamentary leadership . 
Interestingly , [PER El-Himma  ] declined to engage on issues like [LOC Western Sahara  ] ( in which he was intimately engaged as Deputy Interior Minister ) and did not even mention his " [MISC All Democrats Movement  ] , " an initiative which has prompted clamorous speculation in the domestic media about his political ambitions . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador met on February 13 with [PER Fouad Ali El-Himma  ] , Chairman of Parliament 's Foreign Affairs , [MISC Islamic Affairs  ] , and [ORG Defense Committee  ] . 
El [PER Himma  ] is also leader of the parliamentary bloc with provides lynch-pin support to Prime Minister [PER El-Fassi  ] 's minority government . 
The former Deputy Interior Minister and childhood friend and confidante of King [PER Mohammed VI  ] , is still commonly viewed as perhaps the most influential person in [LOC Morocco  ] , after the monarch . 
In a 90-minute , one-on-one meeting , [PER El-Himma  ] talked at length about his efforts to help [PER Skhour Rhamna  ] , the poor constituency north of [LOC Marrakech  ] he was elected to represent in September 2007 . 
[PER El-Himma  ] said he had been leading a continuing dialogue between local officials , [ORG NGOs  ] , and private sector leaders to discuss ways to attract investment , generate employment , and upgrade economic development activities in the district. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER El-Himma  ] claimed that [PER Skhour Rhamna  ] was the poorest district in [LOC Morocco  ] and lamented that it had not been selected as a beneficiary for [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] projects , the first of which are being launched in early <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
[PER El-Himma  ] urged that the [ORG USG  ] look closely at [LOC Skhour Rhamna  ] as it planned future assistance activities , pledging that he would make sure the [ORG USG  ] received the full cooperation of all levels of the [ORG GOM  ] in such an endeavor . 
If you invest in [PER Skhour Rhamna  ] , " we will give you your success story , " he asserted . 
One potential asset he mentioned was the air base at [LOC Ben Guerir  ] , the former [ORG NASA  ] alternate landing site. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Asked about his perspective as a new parliamentarian , [PER El-Himma  ] complained bitterly about the mismanagement of staff resources at the institution . 
Upon arrival , [PER El-Himma  ] discovered , to his dismay , that he could not hire even one staff member of his own choosing . 
Parliament 's entire human resources budget was already tapped out , with 600 persons on the staff payroll , of whom " maybe 30 or 40 actually do something , " he complained . 
He directly criticized former lower house speaker [PER Abdelouahed Radi  ] ( now Minister of Justice ) for having allocated jobs as political party favors and paybacks rather than on merit . 
[PER El-Himma  ] also clearly implied that his relations with [PER Radi  ] 's successor , speaker [PER Mustapha Mansouri  ] , were chilly . 
( Comment: We had heard this from independent sources . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER El-Himma  ] challenged the widely held view that parliament was a weak institution because its powers were circumscribed by the constitution . 
The existing legal framework provides all the power it needs to effect change , he argued . 
The problem has been the myopic vision of the political parties in the parliament , he contended . 
If parliament got together and presented effective legislation based on strong consensus , the [ORG GOM  ] could not and would not say no , he argued. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Returning to the theme of helping his district , [PER El-Himma  ] told the Ambassador he had decided to step down from his post as Minister-Delegate for the Interior ( i.e . 
Deputy Minister ) to go back to a quieter life in his home town and focus on his family and his community . 
Once there , he decided he needed not to rest but to work hard to improve his community , concluding that he could best do so by representing his district in parliament. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: As Deputy Minister of the Interior from 2002 to the summer of 2007 , he overshadowed the actual Minister ( [PER Chakib Benmoussa  ] ) and was widely considered , mainly because of his proximity to the King , to be the second most influential man in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
Many still believe this is the case . 
It is hard not to think him disingenuous in claiming that he stepped down from his ministerial post in the summer of 2007 , not to enter parliament but to return to his dusty and rural hometown to spend time with his family. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment continued: Perhaps most significant in the conversation was what [PER El-Himma  ] did not say . 
He ignored the Ambassador 's question on [LOC Western Sahara  ] , an issue on which he worked in the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] and as a leader of numerous diplomatic missions to press [LOC Morocco  ] 's case in world capitals and the first [LOC Manhasset  ] meeting . 
[PER El-Himma  ] also declined to say anything about his leadership of the " [MISC All Democrats Movement  ] " ( reftel ) , an initiative which has provoked clamorous speculation in the domestic media about his possible plans to form a new political party that would seem well placed to steamroll its rivals and transform the political landscape . 
Instead , with the Ambassador , [PER El-Himma  ] clung to his pose as a newly minted parliamentarian who has come to the capital determined to do something good for his district. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment continued: This is doubtful , at least in part . 
[PER El-Himma  ] 's proximity to the King has apparently not been diminished . 
In fact , we have heard that he was called to join the King on his early February skiing vacation in [LOC France  ] . 
We think more plausible the commonly held view that [PER El-Himma  ] has been tasked by the King with going into parliament , seeing why it doesn't work well , and ultimately fixing it . 
Perhaps by forming a dominant new party , or perhaps through more indirect approaches . 
We are reminded of the 1980 [PER Robert Redford  ] film " Brubaker , " in which the newly appointed warden enters a corrupt and brutal prison disguised as an inmate , to see for himself what the problems are from the ground level . 
[PER El-Himma  ] watching will continue to be a major sport for observers of [LOC Morocco  ] 's domestic political scene and will likely yield interesting results in the months to come .
