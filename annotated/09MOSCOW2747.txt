( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Russian  ] media and officials are concerned with [MISC Polish  ] FM [PER Radoslaw Sikorski  ] 's November 4 comments to the [ORG Center for Strategic and International Studies  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
In particular , they noted [PER Sikorski  ] 's request for [LOC U.S.  ] forces on the ground in [LOC Poland  ] to " protect against [MISC Russian  ] aggression " and his characterization that the recent " [MISC Zapad-2009  ] " exercises were directed against [LOC Poland  ] . 
Some [MISC Russian  ] officials were quick to point out that [PER Sikorski  ] 's comments undermined not only improved [MISC Polish  ] relations ( Ref A and B ) , but harmed [MISC Russian-U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian-NATO  ] relations as well. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MFA  ] has not yet issued a formal statement , FM [PER Sergey Lavrov  ] told the press that he did not believe that [PER Sikorski  ] had actually made the remarks . 
[PER Lavrov  ] commented , however , that if proved true , " it throws me into deep astonishment because we had talked in a detailed manner about the problems that needed to be addressed in the context of [MISC European  ] security . 
" [MISC Russian  ] Permanent Representative to [ORG NATO  ] Dmitry Rogozin called [PER Sikorski  ] 's remarks " absurd " and a u-turn in [MISC Polish  ] policy toward [LOC Russia  ] and its engagement with [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
[ORG Duma International Relations Committee Chair  ] [PER Konstantin Kosachev  ] told the press that [PER Sikorski  ] 's statements " directly contradicted " the improvement in [LOC Russia-U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia-NATO  ] relations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S/NF ) Unfortunately , the [MISC Polish  ] government had seeded some of this [MISC Russian  ] response through their sponsorship of and statements in support of the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Eastern Partnership Initiative  ] ( Ref C ) and show of support to [LOC Georgia  ] during the 2008 [MISC Russia-Georgia War  ] . 
Further , the [MISC Polish  ] [ORG MFA  ] has established a [ORG Bureau of European Security  ] , which [MISC Polish  ] diplomats jokingly refer to as the " Office of Threats from the [LOC East  ] . 
" According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] diplomat [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( [ORG PROTECT  ] ) , who was recruited to work in this bureau while serving in [LOC Moscow  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG MFA  ] threw this new moniker back at him during a meeting . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed to us that the only way the [ORG MFA  ] could have known about the reference was to have been listening in on his phone conversations with [LOC Warsaw  ] while he was interviewing for the job. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] The [ORG GOR  ] will take some time to digest [PER Sikorski  ] 's comments , and evaluate whether or not to alter the current positive trend in bilateral relations . 
[LOC Russia  ] has many levers , including delaying the approval of a pending gas deal ( Ref D ) . 
[PER Sikorski  ] has given anti-western elements in [LOC Russia  ] ammunition against improved [MISC Russian  ] relations with [ORG NATO  ] and even with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Beyrle</pre></code>  ]
