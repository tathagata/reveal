( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Unrealistic public expectations for the outcome of [MISC COP-15  ] and initial confusion over how to interpret the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] led to intense media and opposition questioning of [LOC Denmark  ] 's role as host of the conference , in particular focused on PM Lars [PER Loekke Rasmussen  ] 's performance as President of the [ORG COP  ] . 
In response , the [ORG Government has  ] defended the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] as the best outcome possible at [MISC COP-15  ] and a positive step forward toward a legally binding agreement , and public interest appears to be shifting to other issues. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While it remains publicly committed to pursue a legally binding accord under its [ORG COP  ] presidency ( which ends in December when [LOC Mexico  ] assumes that role at the next [ORG COP  ] in [LOC Cancun  ] ) , we note signs that the Government seeks to play a less exposed role in international negotiations this year , preferring to work privately with the [LOC UN  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] in search of a way forward . 
[LOC Denmark  ] will continue to be a useful partner on climate , especially on [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] implementation , and we will continue to work closely with the [ORG Government  ] and others in pursuit of shared interests . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Danish  ] Government ( like the [ORG USG  ] ) admits that the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] did not fulfil all its hopes for [MISC COP-15  ] , but defends the [ORG Accord  ] as an important outcome of the [MISC COP-15  ] climate conference . 
Critics , including the parliamentary opposition , have criticized the [ORG Accord  ] for its non-binding nature and criticized PM Lars [PER Loekke Rasmussen  ] for a weak performance as President of the 15th Conference of Parties ( [MISC COP-15  ] ) climate conference held in [LOC Copenhagen  ] December 7-18 , 2009 ( for a complete description of the [MISC COP-15  ] endgame and results , see Ref A ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) National media have fully aired opinions about the handling and results of this historic event for [LOC Denmark  ] , to the point where public interest is beginning to reach saturation levels . 
Most awkward for the [ORG Government has  ] been a focus on the PM 's performance during [MISC COP-15  ] . 
[MISC Danish  ] conservative daily 'Berlingske Tidende' cites an unnamed [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] source who reportedly witnessed an angry Prime Minister dressing down his leading climate advisor , [PER Bo Lidegaard  ] , in front of [MISC Danish  ] delegates during COP15 after feeling himself humiliated by foreign diplomats when he assumed the chair of the conference as it entered the crucial final days . 
Press have also highlighted procedural errors made by [PER Rasmussen  ] while in the chair , and the opposition has criticized the [ORG PM  ] for " throwing in the towel " by giving up the chair in the waning hours of the conference after being thwarted by stubborn opposition from the [LOC ALBA  ] countries to [ORG COP  ] approval of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
One anonymous analyst charged that the [ORG PM  ] was unprepared to assume leadership over this international event , and letting him do so was equivalent to " throwing him to the sharks . 
" Defending the [ORG Accord  ] -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In several public appearances since [MISC COP-15  ] , [PER PM Rasmussen  ] and new Climate Minister [PER Lykke Friis  ] have answered pointed questions from the press and the opposition on the significance of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] and the way ahead before Parliament . 
While freely admitting the [ORG Accord  ] was not ideal , they have defended it as the best agreement possible at [MISC COP-15  ] , and an important step forward towards a binding international agreement to address climate change. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In an appearance before Parliament on January 26 , the [ORG PM  ] was faulted by the opposition for his inability to push through a legally binding agreement . 
Social [MISC Democrat  ] climate spokesperson [PER Mette Gjerskov  ] criticized a " much too close " [MISC Danish  ] alliance with the [LOC U.S.  ] in the lead-up to the [ORG COP  ] , saying " it was not enough just to get [PER Obama  ] to town and hope to then buy the votes of developing nations . 
" [PER Gjerskov  ] said the [ORG PM  ] had chaired [MISC COP-15  ] " as though it was a village hall discussion , not a gathering of world leaders , " and urged the government to admit its mistakes and assume greater responsibility for the negotiating process in the lead-up to [LOC COP-16  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
Continuing , she declared that " it is now over a month since delegates saw their COP15 chairman throw in the towel and walk out of the conference and nobody has seen or heard from him since . 
No meetings have been called , no strategy has been laid out . 
Where 's the leadership ? 
Our Prime Minister seems to be suffering from a climate coma . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response , [ORG PM Rasmussen  ] defended the accord as the best possible outcome and a reflection of " the art of the possible " and " the reality of the situation . 
" The [ORG PM  ] said the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] was an important step forward towards a binding agreement that remains the end goal of the Government . 
While acknowledging the [LOC COPENHAGEN  ] 00000069 002.4 OF 003 opposition had a right to try to label the outcome of the [ORG COP  ] a 'd isaster , ' the [ORG PM  ] said that view displayed " a very modest understanding of what was--and is--at stake in the international climate debate . 
" On forming alliances , the [ORG PM  ] dismissed the criticism and indicated that he sees a much broader alliance behind the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
The accord , he said , was supported by countries responsible for more than 80 percent of global [MISC CO2-emissions  ] . 
[PER Friis  ] to the [MISC Front--Still Ambitious  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Climate and Energy Minister [PER Lykke Friis  ] , who assumed her ministerial duties when her predecessor , [PER Connie Hedegaard  ] , stepped down just before [MISC COP-15  ] ( see Ref B ) , told Parliament on January 26 that [LOC Denmark  ] was committed to pursuing international collaboration on climate change along all tracks ( i.e . 
[LOC UN  ] , [LOC Kyoto  ] , [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To do so , she said , [LOC Denmark  ] will specifically: --Work with [ORG EU  ] and other developed countries on delivering the finance outlined in the accord ; --coordinate its efforts with the [LOC UN  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Germany  ] ( for the June [ORG UNFCCC  ] meeting in [LOC Bonn  ] ) ; --keep working through diplomatic channels , via its embassy climate attaches in strategic countries ( adding a new one in [LOC Mexico City  ] and extending its current attache in [LOC South Africa  ] , in anticipation of [LOC South Africa  ] 's hosting of [MISC COP-17  ] in 2011 ) ; --the Minister said she would attend the [ORG World Economic Forum  ] in [LOC Doha  ] January 26-27 , and would subsequently visit [LOC Delhi  ] ( Feb 5-6 , coupled with a visit to [LOC Beijing  ] ) . 
( [PER Note: Friis'  ] staff told REO on January 26 that she is also considering whether and when to continue her predecessor 's " [ORG Greenland Dialogue  ] " process . 
) But Not [MISC Too Ambitious  ] --------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PM [PER Rasmussen  ] has flatly rejected calls from the opposition and - intriguingly - from some within the governing coalition ( specifically from the [ORG Conservative Party  ] of former Climate Minister and [ORG EC  ] Commissioner-designate [PER Connie Hedegaard  ] ) , for more ambitious international leadership by [LOC Denmark  ] on climate issues in the wake of [MISC COP-15  ] . 
On January 13 during another appearance before Parliament , the PM was denounced by Social [ORG Liberal Party  ] leader [PER Margrethe Vestager  ] for " trying to lead from the back seat . 
" Instead , she said , " [LOC Denmark  ] could do something on its own . 
We should say: first we will go for 30 percent , and we are willing to go even further . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rasmussen  ] responded that " we could say 100 percent . 
We could declare that we will end the consumption of fossil fuels by the end of the year , then we would have made a marginal , marginal contribution to the fight against global warming . 
Because even if we did , even if the whole [ORG EU  ] did , even if all developed nations of the world did it , it would still not be enough to reach the 2 degrees target . 
We would then probably have set ourselves some challenges that are...very challenging financially . 
It 's about balance . 
And I accept that there is a positive competitive effect of being a frontrunner , but there is also a competitive disadvantage by being too much of a front-runner , and therefore the right place for this discussion right here and now is ( within ) the [ORG EU  ] . 
" Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG COP-15  ] was certainly a disappointment to the [MISC Danish  ] Government in that it did not provide the public relations boost it had hoped for . 
Yet neither was it a bust--the opposition has not been noticeably boosted , and recriminations over [MISC COP-15  ] seem to be losing public interest , especially as implementation of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] gathers steam . 
Instead , [MISC Danes  ] seem eager to leave the mixed results of [ORG COP-15  ] behind , choosing to move on to focus political debate on other issues . 
Polls show a slight opposition lead over the government , but that edge was not significantly affected by [ORG COP-15  ] . 
That said , emerging disagreements within the governing coalition and with the opposition over international climate negotiations have the potential to play out further , with electoral implications. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the outcome of [MISC COP-15  ] is not directly destabilizing the [ORG Rasmussen Government  ] in the short term , the [ORG PM  ] appears chastened by his experience and unlikely to risk further high-stakes appearances on the international stage . 
We expect Minister [PER Friis  ] to now assume a more visible role enunciating [MISC Danish  ] climate policy , as [LOC Denmark  ] transitions to a more modest role in international negotiations . 
As [MISC COP-15  ] president for the remainder of 2010 , however , [LOC Denmark  ] will remain an important player in international climate negotiations , and we will continue to work together with the [LOC COPENHAGEN  ] 00000069 003.4 OF 003 Government on shared interests in encouraging full implementation of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] and building support for an effective international agreement . 
In coordination with the [ORG Department ,  ] we will engage with Minister [PER Friis  ] to exchange views on the best way forward .
