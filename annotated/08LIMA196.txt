REF: [PER A. LIMA  ] 2560 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC LIMA  ] 3707 <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
[LOC LIMA  ] 3764 Classified By: CDA [PER James D. Nealon  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The terrorist organization " [ORG Shining Path  ] " ( [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] or [ORG SL  ] ) is currently comprised of two distinct groups , according to analysts . 
One consists largely of long-time [ORG SL  ] members and " true believers " in the [MISC Maoist  ] ideology who are reportedly working within civic organizations and universities to revitalize the movement . 
While this group finds fertile ground in [LOC Peru  ] 's still pervasive poverty , there are intrinsic obstacles to its joining forces with other actors in [LOC Peru  ] 's anti-systemic opposition . 
The second group , itself comprised of two smaller factions , has increasingly involved itself in the drug trade to the exclusion of any political agenda , an evolution akin to that of the [ORG FARC  ] in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
While each group separately poses a threat , observers believe that the threat would expand significantly if the two groups reunited . 
The Government of [LOC Peru  ] has a multi-faceted security and civic action plan to end the [ORG SL  ] terrorist threat definitively . 
While there have been some security successes , the plan so far has delivered few tangible civic benefits . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The status of [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] ( [ORG Shining Path  ] -- [ORG SL  ] ) , the [MISC Maoist-inspired  ] terrorist group that threatened the viability of the [MISC Peruvian  ] state in the late 80s , continues to concern many [MISC Peruvians  ] , particularly those with responsibilities for internal defense and security . 
The capture of [ORG SL  ] founder and leader [PER Abimael Guzman  ] in 1992 ended the urgency of the threat but did not definitively eliminate [ORG SL  ] from [LOC Peru  ] 's political landscape . 
Not long after [PER Guzman  ] 's capture , the organization split into two factions . 
One favored [PER Guzman  ] 's attempts to reach a negotiated political settlement with the government ( " [MISC Acuerdistas  ] " ) . 
The other vowed to continue [ORG SL  ] 's political and military struggle ( " Proseguir " ) . 
The core of those seeking a negotiated settlement happened to be imprisoned with [PER Guzman  ] and remain focused on securing his release , while those still on the outside , free from the autocratic leader 's immediate influence , began circling in more autonomous political orbits . 
[MISC Acuerdistas  ] ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The current ranks of " [MISC Acuerdistas  ] " have been fed largely by prison releases . 
Hundreds of [ORG Sendero  ] 's former core members , after completing their sentences , were freed between 2001 and 2007 . 
According to sensitive sources , [PER Guzman  ] , from his prison cell , retains a significant measure of control and influence over this " [MISC Acuerdista  ] " coterie , whose principal objective is to negotiate and secure [PER Guzman  ] 's eventual release . 
( [PER Guzman  ] has been sentenced to life in prison without any possibility of parole or release . 
He received an additional life sentence January 2 for his role in the massacre of 69 persons in [LOC Ayacucho  ] region in 1980 , in addition to 26 assassinations and 14 car bombings in 1980 and 1981 . 
) While observers acknowledge that most former [MISC Senderistas  ] released from prison have sought to integrate themselves as ordinary citizens into [MISC Peruvian  ] society , they also estimate that several hundred retain their ideological commitments and that 50 or more have the political and organizational experience to fill leadership roles in the movement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to some analysts , these leaders are now using their positions in civic organizations and union groups to foment social unrest . 
One contact told poloffs of a recent community event in [LOC Ayacucho  ] during which he sat across the table from known former [MISC Senderistas  ] who now work for the teachers' union SUTEP and are involved in regional politics . 
Other " [MISC Acuerdista  ] " [ORG SL  ] members reportedly have resumed their posts as high school and university instructors , where analysts believe they are working below the radar to proselytize new members of student groups supporting [MISC Marxist-Leninist-Maoist  ] philosophies ( ref A ) . 
As an example , some sources refer to the [ORG University of San Marcos  ] in [LOC Lima  ] -- the oldest and among the largest public universities in [LOC Peru  ] -- as a " factory of radicalism " that produces large numbers of semi-educated graduates , typically in " social science , " with few prospects for gainful employment . 
This pattern is reportedly replicated to varying degrees in other public universities around the country . 
Recent media reports have highlighted more broadly the return of [ORG Sendero  ] elements to places of vulnerability such as rural schools in poor regions , but many of these reports lack specificity , and government officials , including the Minister of Education , have taken issue with them. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Even in the absence of hard evidence , the revitalization of [ORG SL  ] is seen by many observers as at least theoretically plausible because the underlying social conditions that facilitated its initial rise remain mostly unchanged . 
Notwithstanding [LOC Peru  ] 's much-touted macroeconomic advances of recent years , poverty , marginalization , unemployment and lack of opportunity in general , particularly but not only in [LOC Peru  ] 's [LOC Sierra  ] region such as [LOC Ayacucho  ] ( the birthplace of [ORG SL  ] ) , remain stubbornly persistent . 
According to some analysts , as long as this remains so the country will continue to provide fertile terrain for radical groups . 
At the same time , however , [ORG SL  ] rarely collaborated with mere fellow travelers in radicalism , and often fought bitter and even deadly battles with ideological and political rivals on the left . 
Many anti-systemic opposition groups , including , for example , [PER Ollanta Humala  ] 's [ORG Nationalist Party  ] , are sworn enemies of [ORG Sendero  ] for this reason . 
In a 2007 meeting , [PER Humala  ] told us he opposed violence as a political instrument because had seen the devastation wrought upon [LOC Peru  ] by [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] . 
[ORG SL  ] 's use of savage and indiscriminate violence , sometimes against whole communities , elicited widespread popular revulsion , a sentiment that remains prevalent today . 
For this reason , any association with [ORG SL  ] can be a kiss of death for groups seeking to forge a political future in [LOC Peru  ] 's sizable and diverse anti-systemic camp , which often causes them to steer clear . 
Proseguir --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Following [PER Guzman  ] 's 1992 capture , the [ORG Sendero  ] organization crumbled and authorities swept the countryside in search of its remnats . 
Those [ORG Sendero  ] members who became members of the " Proseguir " group sought refuge separately in two remote areas of the country . 
One faction -- led by " [PER Comrade Artemio  ] " -- hid in the [ORG Upper Huallaga River Valley  ] , primarily in the [LOC Huanuco  ] region , the other -- led by " [PER Comrade Alipio  ] " -- in the [ORG VRAE  ] ( Apurimac and [LOC Ene River Valley  ] ) in the northern [LOC Ayacucho  ] region . 
Security officials soon gave up the difficult search , thinking ( or hoping ) the remnant groups would fade away . 
During the last 15 years , both groups have clung to survival on the jungle margins , adapting themselves to a political condition characterized by the absence of outside leadership or guidance . 
Concretely , this means that each group retained a [MISC Maoist  ] veneer and the explicit commitment to continuing the armed struggle while , in practical terms , gradually deepening and expanding their involvement in the drug trade. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In both cases , [ORG SL  ] 's involvement in the trade began by charging traffickers " protection money " to ensure the safety of their enterprises and cargo . 
Over time , it expanded across the narcotics chain , and has come to include growing coca , processing coca leaf into cocaine paste and recently -- particularly in the [ORG VRAE  ] -- producing refined cocaine hydrochloride . 
Analysts believe that [PER Alipio  ] 's organization , for example , has hundreds of " micro-labs " scattered throughout the [ORG VRAE  ] area . 
Some observers have remarked on the similarity of this pattern to [LOC Colombia  ] 's experience with the [ORG FARC  ] ( ref C ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG VRAE  ] 's inaccessibility and virtual absence of any state presence , including security forces , makes it a quasi-ungoverned area dominated by narcotics traffickers . 
According to many analysts , this is one reason why the [ORG VRAE  ] faction of Proseguir appears to be flourishing . 
( Note: It is also the reason there are no eradication or alternative development programs in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
End Note . 
) While core [ORG SL  ] membership there is probably fewer than 100 , according to sensitive reports , part-time or contract membership relating to carrying out specific tasks and responsibilities in the narcotics trade may be twice that number . 
By contrast , observers see [PER Artemio  ] 's group in the [ORG Upper Huallaga  ] as being on the defensive for the past two years . 
At the height of its strength , the [ORG Upper Huallaga SL  ] group reportedly numbered approximately 150 militants . 
Operational successes by government security forces caused the group significant losses in 2007 , and authorities claim that [PER Artemio  ] 's arrest may be imminent ( ref B ) . 
If that happens , many analysts predict the remaining [ORG SL  ] structure in the [ORG Upper Huallaga  ] could collapse . 
Efforts to Reunite ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) While each of the above groups separately represent varying degrees of immediate and potential threat now ( even if nothing like the critical threat to the viability and survival of the [MISC Peruvian  ] state that [ORG SL  ] did in the late 1980s ) , observers focused on a worst-case outlook are concerned about their possibly reuniting . 
This concern is fueled in part by reports that such a move is afoot . 
For example , some analysts claim evidence that [PER Guzman  ] 's long-time companion and now-wife , [PER Elena Iparraguirre  ] ( [ORG AKA  ] " [PER Comrade Miriam  ] " , also imprisoned ) , is leading efforts to mend the rift in the [ORG Sendero  ] organization . 
There were reports in October 2007 that the head of [ORG Sendero  ] 's [ORG Lima Metropolitan Committee  ] , [PER Emilio Robero Mera  ] , had recently traveled to the [ORG VRAE  ] to consult with that area 's leadership . 
Perhaps more impactful than anecdotal reports , however , is a larger speculative concern that the combination of Proseguir 's narco-dollars and paramilitary capabilities with the [MISC Acuerdistas'  ] ideological fervor and political machine could produce a terrorism challenge reminiscent of the 1980s . 
( [ORG Comment:  ] A reuniting of the two groups or significant reblossoming of the pre-Fujimori [ORG SL  ] seems to us unlikely for a number of reasons , among them passage of time , irreconcilable differences and a transformed national and international context . 
End Comment . 
) [ORG Comment:  ] GOP Priority to End Terrorism Definitively --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) President [PER Garcia  ] has two priority goals for his second term in office , both relating to resurrecting his reputation from his disastrous first term ( 85-90 ) . 
The first goal is to ensure economic stability and growth . 
The second is to end definitively [LOC Peru  ] 's terrorist threat -- a threat widely perceived as having exploded out of control on his first watch . 
The [MISC GOP  ] has laid out a comprehensive plan -- with economic development , social and civil , intelligence , and security components -- to do this . 
It has a subordinate plan to take on the challenges particular to the [ORG VRAE  ] , with similar component elements . 
But that plan has only been partially implemented , both in geographic and functional terms . 
Expanding the presence of the state to emergency zones such as the [ORG VRAE  ] and pushing out the benefits of economic growth to impoverished regions such as [LOC Ayacucho  ] -- difficult challenges in the best of cases -- have not yet meaningfully happened . 
In that sense , apart from punctuated operational successes in the [ORG Upper Huallaga  ] region , the [MISC GOP  ] 's plan to eliminate [ORG SL  ] from [LOC Peru  ] 's landscape once and for all has yielded few results so far .
