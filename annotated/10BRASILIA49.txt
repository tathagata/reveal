( C ) Summary . 
Late January polling indicates that likely [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) presidential candidate [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , President [PER Lula  ] 's chosen successor , has closed much of the gap with front-running opposition [ORG Brazilian Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) candidate [PER Jose Serra  ] , and now trails by less than ten points in a two-way race for October 's election . 
The narrowing of the race was widely expected ; the campaign now enters a zone where predictions are more difficult , as both [PER Rousseff  ] and [PER Serra  ] struggle to overcome public perceptions that have limited their respective voter preference ratings . 
Some observers see the latest polls as giving her an advantage , while others attribute the surge to hard campaigning by President [PER Lula  ] and suggest that his star power will not be sufficient to maintain the momentum once the intense glare of campaign TV reveals weaknesses in [PER Rousseff  ] 's candidacy . 
[PER Rousseff  ] 's rise has increased pressure on [PER Serra  ] to announce his candidacy and on [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] to accept a slot as [PER Serra  ] 's VP running mate . 
Meanwhile , [ORG PT  ] and its primary coalition partner the [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  ] ( [ORG PMDB  ] ) continue to argue about which party gets to run for which state and congressional races , excluding and alienating smaller coalition parties to the extent that [ORG PSDB  ] may be able to recruit new allies from within coalition ranks . 
End summary . 
State of [LOC Play:  ] An Expected Rise , A Long Way to Go <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Two late January national polls - [ORG Vox Populi  ] and CNT - yielded very similar results , indicating a slight decline in preference for [PER Serra  ] and a significant rise for [PER Rousseff  ] . 
The [ORG Vox Populi  ] poll shows [PER Serra  ] beating [PER Rousseff  ] 34 to 27 percent with [ORG Brazilian Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSB  ] ) candidate [PER Ciro Gomes  ] included in the race , and 38 to 29 percent without him . 
In both categories , this represented a nearly 15-point net gain for [PER Rousseff  ] from December . 
CNT shows that [PER Serra  ] leading [PER Rousseff  ] by a slim 33 to 28 percent in a race with [PER Gomes  ] included , and a much wider 41 to 29 percent lead without him . 
In both polls [PER Gomes  ] slipped from the previous month 's poll , falling from 17 to 11 percent , while [ORG Green Party  ] ( [ORG PV  ] ) candidate [PER Marina Silva  ] maintains ratings in the high single digits . 
[PER Gomes  ] is pulling slightly more votes from [PER Serra  ] than from [PER Rousseff  ] , while [PER Silva  ] 's vote comes entirely at [PER Rousseff  ] 's expense. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) These outcomes were not unexpected . 
As Sen. [PER Sergio Zambiasi  ] ( [ORG Brazilian Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PTB  ] ) -Rio [LOC Grande  ] do Sul ) joked to poloff on February 2 about the polls , " Maybe the only surprise is that ( [PER Rousseff  ] 's rise ) happened exactly when everybody thought . 
" [PER Lula  ] 's aggressive presentation of [PER Rousseff  ] as the centerpiece of domestic legislation ( including pre-salt oil ) and international negotiations ( [LOC Copenhagen  ] ) has managed to boost her name recognition , in the process bringing home much of [ORG PT  ] 's natural electoral base . 
[ORG PT  ] contacts are encouraged and confident but they also recognize that [PER Rousseff  ] 's rise is only an early step in the process . 
[PER Candido Vaccarezza  ] ( [LOC PT-Sao Paulo  ] ) , leader of the governing coalition in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , acknowledged to poloff that , due to [PER Lula  ] 's strong advocacy , most of the low-hanging electoral fruit has already been picked for [PER Rousseff  ] . 
The challenge , he said , will be to get her to 40 percent - which he acknowledged would take some work . 
( [PER Vaccarezza  ] strongly supports [PER Ciro Gomes  ] as a third-party candidate in order to lower the threshold for [PER Rousseff  ] . 
) [MISC Rousseff:  ] The [ORG Start of Something Big  ] or the [ORG Best She'll Get  ] ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] 's rise in the polls creates a positive narrative for her heading into [ORG PT  ] 's national congress , to be held in late February , where she is widely expected to announce her candidacy officially . 
Third-party observers offered divided opinion about how much higher [PER Rousseff  ] can rise from here . 
Two competing [MISC Brasilia-based  ] analysts told us in the past week that the race now tips toward [PER Rousseff  ] , because the economy will continue to be strong and because at this point , she only needs the support of a small fraction of the 80 percent of the electorate who approve [PER Lula  ] 's performance . 
[PER Humberto Saccomandi  ] , International News Editor of [ORG Valor Economico  ] and political analyst [PER Rafael Cortez  ] of [PER Tendencia Consultoria  ] told Consulate General [LOC Sao Paulo  ] much the same . 
Most of these analysts added , however , that [PER Rousseff  ] repels many with her uncharismatic performance on television and she still has to prove she can hold her own in debates and public appearances. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Rousseff  ] 's harshest critics most often emphasize that television and public speaking will kill her candidacy . 
Journalist [PER William Waack  ] described to CG [LOC Sao Paulo  ] a recent business forum in which [PER Serra  ] , [PER Rousseff  ] , [PER Neves  ] and [PER Gomes  ] all participated . 
According to [PER Waack  ] , [PER Gomes  ] was the strongest overall , [PER Neves  ] the most charismatic , [PER Serra  ] detached but clearly competent , and [PER Rousseff  ] the least coherent . 
Other critics take a more subtle tack , arguing somewhat counterintuitively that [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire for continuity after years of progress and prosperity actually benefits [PER Serra  ] , because he is seen by many as more likely to follow the economic path laid out by [PER Cardoso  ] and followed by [PER Lula  ] . 
[PER Helio Gurovitz  ] , News Director at [LOC Epoca  ] magazine , described [LOC Brazil  ] as similar to [LOC Chile  ] , arguing that the social base of the country has developed to the extent that it would prefer to alternate parties in power in order to retain continuity , rather than keep one party in power long-term , thereby facilitating a hard shift to that party 's side of the political spectrum . 
Others just see her as the wrong candidate at the wrong time . 
The [ORG Chiefs of Staff  ] for [MISC Senators  ] [PER Osmar Dias  ] ( [ORG Democratic Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PDT  ] ) -Parana ) and [PER Alvaro Dias  ] ( [LOC PSDB-Parana  ] ) - who are brothers representing the same state but opposite sides of the political fence - met poloff together on February 5 and were united on one point: [PER Rousseff  ] will suffer among reachable voters because she is clearly not [PER Lula.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) If [PER Rousseff  ] 's personal lack of charisma were not enough of a worry , [ORG PT  ] also is having problems keeping [ORG PMDB  ] , its primary coalition partner and the largest party in [LOC Brazil  ] , happy in the state-level races , which may have adverse effects on [PER Rousseff  ] 's campaign . 
[ORG PMDB  ] has already committed itself to support [PER Serra  ] in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , the country 's largest block of votes by far . 
PT-PMDB infighting also continues over which candidates to support in many other gubernatorial and legislative races , without signs of resolution in virtually every major state , including [ORG Minas Gerais  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [LOC Bahia  ] , [LOC Pernambuco  ] , [LOC Parana  ] , and [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul . 
[ORG PT  ] may have little choice other than to resolve most of these impasses by supporting [ORG PMDB  ] candidates , leaving little space to support aspirants from smaller coalition parties . 
Sen. [PER Zambiasi  ] , whose [ORG PTB  ] is one of those smaller parties , confirmed to poloff that his party , among others , has been offered very little from [ORG PT  ] to stick with [PER Rousseff  ] in the 2010 campaign . 
While declaring himself a [PER Lula supporter  ] ( he spoke diplomatically of [PER Rousseff  ] , who is from his home state ) , [PER Zambiasi  ] more-or-less confirmed local rumors that [ORG PTB  ] is strongly leaning toward backing [PER Serra  ] , bringing the party 's advertising time with them . 
He added that no decision would be made during the upcoming legislative session , adding that [ORG PTB  ] is in no hurry to be " the first to jump off the roof . 
" Pressure Grows for [PER Serra  ] and [PER Neves  ] to Declare <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Serra  ] meantime has maintained a relatively low national profile while [ORG PSDB  ] surrogates such as ex-President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] and Senator [PER Sergio Guerra  ] draw headlines for sniping with President [PER Lula  ] and the government . 
[PER Rousseff  ] 's rise has set off another round of speculation that [PER Serra  ] may decide to withdraw from the presidential race and run again for Governor of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[ORG Presidential International Relations Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] suggested as much in a February 8 meeting with the Ambassador , as has virtually every [ORG PT  ] elected official in meetings with embassy officers over the past few months . 
While [ORG PT  ] has an interest in pushing this line , it also comes from third-party sources and from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , including [ORG Valor Economico  ] 's [PER Saccomandi  ] . 
Others , including senior [ORG Sao Paulo-based PSDB  ] contacts such as Mayor [PER Kassab  ] 's Chief of Staff [PER Clovis Carvalho  ] and [ORG PSDB State Party  ] President and Federal Deputy [PER Antonio Carlos Mendes Thame  ] , have told CG [LOC Sao Paulo  ] officers that [PER Serra  ] will run . 
At this point , [PER Serra  ] is still not expected to announce his candidacy until March. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Media speculation continues on the possibility of [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] joining the [ORG PSDB  ] ticket as VP . 
[LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's [ORG O Globo  ] reported recently that [PER Neves  ] is finding the pressure unhelpful in political management of his own state , where [PER Neves  ] is trying to shore up other state [ORG PSDB  ] candidates , and where he continues to avow that he plans to run for [ORG Senate  ] . 
Two [ORG PSDB  ] staff sources in the Federal [ORG Senate  ] also told poloff that [PER Rousseff  ] 's rise is ratcheting up the pressure on Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] to accept a slot as [PER Serra  ] 's vice - a position [PER Neves  ] has previously indicated he does not want ( reftel ) . 
Both see an [PER Aecio  ] vice-presidential nomination as an opportunity to regain momentum in the race , a vote-winner in [LOC Minas  ] and surrounding states , and as the best possible vice presidential option in the quest to attract smaller parties from the governing coalition to [ORG PSDB  ] 's side . 
Interestingly , neither [ORG PSDB  ] source considered himself a [PER Neves  ] fan . 
Both considered him to be more image than substance , easy for [ORG PT  ] to attack for his lifestyle , and a poor potential substitute for [PER Serra  ] at the front of a presidential ticket . 
Former [PER Cardoso  ] Finance Minister and [ORG PSDB  ] senior figure [PER Pedro Malan  ] told [ORG Rio Principal  ] Officer February 5 that , while he believes [PER Neves  ] as VP candidate would strongly boost the [ORG PSDB  ] 's prospects for victory , it is now unclear to [PER Malan  ] whether [PER Neves  ] will ultimately take the decision to join [PER Serra  ] 's ticket . 
" The calculus he has to make in terms of maintaining his influence and prestige in [ORG Minas Gerais  ] over the long term and this upcoming election is more complex than some think , " [PER Malan  ] said . 
As for [PER Neves  ] himself , it appears he hasn't entirely shut out the VP option: he told [ORG Rio Principal  ] Officer on February 10 that , " Sometimes you have to give time to time-let 's wait and see how things develop . 
" [MISC Comment: The Race  ] Is About to [PER Begin  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) After months revving their engines , [LOC Brazil  ] 's two most likely presidential contenders are poised at the starting line , both standing at poll positions most analysts anticipated for them at this point . 
[PER Rousseff  ] 's expected official announcement , planned for shortly after Carnaval ( approximately February 20 ) , will lead to yet another round of speculation on [PER Serra  ] 's plans until the moment when [PER Serra  ] finally announces ( or doesn't ) in March , marking the de-facto start of the campaign . 
The race from that point forward becomes very difficult to predict , both because of measurable " x factors " such as the candidacies of [PER Ciro Gomes  ] and [PER Marina Silva  ] , and because of variables almost impossible to predict - such as the impact of [PER Serra  ] 's as-of-yet-undefined campaign strategy or whether the [ORG PT  ] 's difficulties in holding its coalition together in state and congressional races will have any real effect on voter choices in October 's presidential contest . 
At this point , assuming that [PER Serra  ] runs , [LOC Brazil  ] 's presidential race is the definition of a toss-up .
