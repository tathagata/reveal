( [LOC S NF  ] ) Military operations against the [ORG Lord  ] 's [ORG Resistance Army  ] ( [ORG LRA  ] ) continue to make progress . 
Between June 15 and 29 , the [ORG Ugandan Peoples Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG UPDF  ] ) killed four and captured six [ORG LRA  ] fighters and rescued 26 abductees . 
( Note: Other information sources suggest the numbers of [ORG LRA  ] killed and captured may be higher . 
End Note . 
) [MISC Ugandan  ] Defense Minister [PER Crispus Kiyonga  ] estimates that 50% of the [ORG LRA  ] 's senior leadership and 25% of its fighting force have been killed during the military operations . 
[PER Kiyonga  ] puts the number of remaining [ORG LRA  ] fighters at 300 . 
The [ORG U.N. Mission  ] in [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG MONUC  ] ) provides similar figures , estimating that the [ORG LRA  ] 's fighting force currently numbers 300-400 and its abductees number 600-1,000 . 
( Note: We believe [ORG MONUC  ] 's numbers of abductees in captivity is high . 
End Note . 
) Recent reports show that [ORG LRA  ] leader [PER Joseph Kony  ] is moving toward [LOC Bokoya  ] , [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) in line with earlier reports that [ORG LRA  ] leadership was believed to be moving west towards the [LOC Central African Republic  ] ( [ORG CAR  ] ) border . 
Meanwhile , his deputy , [PER Okot Odhiambo  ] , continues to make moves to divert attention away from [PER Kony  ] 's group . 
[ORG MONUC  ] also reports an emerging trend among [MISC Congolese  ] youth imitating [ORG LRA  ] tactics and generating false reports of " [ORG LRA  ] activities " and attacks on civilians. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Browning  ] attended a " Friends of [ORG MONUC  ] " meeting on June 22 . 
[ORG MONUC  ] briefed the group on the [ORG Chiefs of Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG CHOD  ] ) meeting in [LOC Kisangani  ] . 
The CHODs from [ORG DRC  ] , [LOC Uganda  ] , and [ORG CAR  ] agreed that military operations are putting pressure on the [ORG LRA  ] and should continue . 
[ORG MONUC  ] discussed its ability to provide logistical support to [ORG CAR  ] and/or [LOC Uganda  ] should its area of operations expand , but says it would need a new mandate from the [ORG U.N. Security Council  ] to do so . 
Notably , [ORG MONUC  ] did not mention the possibility of expanding operations into southern [LOC Sudan  ] . 
( Note: Our sources speculate that this is because the [ORG LRA  ] does not seem to be moving towards southern [LOC Sudan  ] . 
End Note . 
) The meeting 's participants noted that there also seems to be confusion regarding recent rumors of [ORG LRA  ] activity in southern [LOC Sudan  ] and possible [LOC Khartoum  ] support for these activities spurred by comments from a southern [MISC Sudanese  ] politician from [LOC Western Equatoria Province  ] that appeared in the [MISC Ugandan  ] press . 
The group recognized that these rumors are unconfirmed and cautioned operators in the region to exercise restraint in perpetuating such rumors. - - - - - - - - - - - POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Government of Uganda  ] formally charged [ORG MEGA  ] FM journalist [PER Patrick Otim  ] and eleven others with treason for their association with the [ORG Peoples Patriotic Front  ] , a nascent rebel group in northern [LOC Uganda  ] ( ref A ) .

( [LOC S NF  ] ) [ORG UPDF  ] Spokesman [PER Felix Kulayigye  ] told P/E Chief on June 25 that [MISC Kenyan  ] Prime Minister [PER Raila Odinga  ] may be making common cause with the [MISC Acholi  ] opposition in [LOC Uganda  ] and diaspora elements in [LOC Nairobi  ] to advocate on behalf of [ORG LRA  ] leader [PER Joseph Kony  ] . 
[PER Odinga  ] reportedly has written a letter to [LOC U.S.  ] President [PER Barack Obama  ] requesting that the [LOC U.S.  ] stop its operations against the [ORG LRA  ] . 
[PER Odinga  ] , an ethnic [MISC Luo  ] , reportedly is attempting to unite the [MISC Luo-speaking  ] communities of western [LOC Kenya  ] , southern [LOC Sudan  ] , and northern [LOC Uganda  ] . 
( Note: The [MISC Acholi  ] people in northern [LOC Uganda  ] are [MISC Luo  ] speakers .

) [PER Kulayigye  ] said the [ORG Government  ] suspects [PER Odinga  ] of supporting [ORG KAMPALA  ] 00000679 002 OF 002 the [MISC Ugandan  ] opposition because President [PER Museveni  ] supported [MISC Kenyan  ] President [PER Kibaki  ] during the [MISC Kenyan  ] elections . 
[MISC Ugandan  ] Government sources allege that [PER Odinga  ] met with [ORG Government of Southern Sudan  ] President [PER Salva Kiir  ] and Vice President [PER Riek Machar  ] with a similar request .

[ORG LRA  ] chief negotiator [PER David Matsanga  ] grabbed the opportunity to claim in the press that he persuaded [PER Chissano  ] to delay the report . 
[PER Matsanga  ] 's claims are " a lie , " according to [PER Nuno Tomas  ] , the head of [PER Chissano  ] 's office in [LOC Kampala  ] . 
[PER Chissano  ] had other commitments in [LOC Madagascar  ] and could not travel to [LOC New York  ] until mid-July. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
