Grappo  ] per 1.4 ( B and D ) . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Minister of the [ORG Royal Office  ] and head of the [ORG Office of the Supreme  ] Commander of the [ORG Armed Forces , Lieutenant General  ] [PER Ali  ] bin [PER Majid  ] al-Ma'amari , reviewed [LOC Oman  ] 's view on [LOC Iran  ] from a security perspective , highlighting [MISC Omani  ] awareness of [LOC Iran  ] 's deceptive tactics and expansionist ideological desires in the region . 
During an introductory meeting with [MISC NAVCENT  ] commander VADM [PER William Gortney  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , General [PER Ali  ] addressed the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear file , security in the [ORG Strait of Hormuz  ] , and [MISC Iranian  ] interference in the region . 
[PER Ali Majid  ] 's suspicious view of [LOC Iran  ] stands in stark contrast to conciliatory if not obsequious public comments of [MISC Omani  ] Minister Responsible for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] Yusuf bin 'Alawi regarding [LOC Iran  ] and its role in the region . 
End summary . 
Won't Oppose Further Sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Characterizing [LOC Oman  ] 's preference for " frankness and clarity , " General [PER Ali  ] began his comments on [LOC Iran  ] by noting the reality of [LOC Iran  ] as a nearby neighbor , which influenced [LOC Oman  ] 's relations with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Toward the end of the discussion , he compared [LOC Oman  ] 's normal relations with [LOC Iran  ] to the relations of other [ORG GCC  ] members with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Throughout the meeting , he frequently touched on the theme of how different [LOC Oman  ] was from other [ORG GCC  ] member states , whose real intentions and positions often eluded [MISC Omani  ] comprehension. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue stood at the forefront of the General 's mind . 
He described the nuclear file as an international issue , noting that resolution of this issue should be dealt with through international bodies such as the [ORG UN Security Council  ] and the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) . 
[LOC Oman  ] would respect decisions of these groups and play its role in the international community . 
[LOC Oman  ] would not oppose imposition of further measures against [LOC Iran  ] by the international bodies ; however , [LOC Oman  ] did not want to play an active role in advocating for such measures itself . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Intentions Clear: Stall for Time ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ali Majid  ] stated that [LOC Oman  ] was aware of [MISC Iranian  ] stall tactics in the talks over the nuclear issue . 
Instead of responding by the August 5 deadline , the [MISC Iranian  ] side offered a new initiative for talks , confirming reports from the [LOC U.S.  ] and others that [LOC Iran  ] indeed is trying merely to buy time . 
Letting the 5 August deadline pass in responding positively to the [ORG P5  ] 1 proposal made the [MISC Iranian  ] intention to stall " very clear to [LOC Oman  ] . 
" The Ambassador noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] has been working with allies around the world , and especially within the [ORG EU  ] , to further restrict [MISC Iranian  ] economic activity in an effort to influence [LOC Iran  ] 's position on the nuclear file . 
General [PER Ali  ] agreed that sanctions to date were having an impact on the [MISC Iranian  ] economy , despite [LOC Iran  ] 's public denials . 
Moreover , he said , [LOC Iran  ] believed the [LOC U.S.  ] would never attack [LOC Iran  ] , a belief that encouraged [LOC Iran  ] to persist in its stall tactics . 
Nevertheless , he advocated a non-military solution as the best option for the [LOC U.S.  ] , and suggested that over the long term , establishment of [LOC U.S.  ] relations at some level with the [MISC Iranian  ] government might enable the [LOC U.S.  ] to better influence the [MISC Iranian  ] government and people . 
Empty Threats Against the [ORG Strait --------------------------------  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Responding to the Ambassador 's question about recent [MISC Iranian  ] statements threatening the [ORG Strait of Hormuz  ] , [PER Ali Majid  ] dismissed the threats as " empty words " and perhaps a feeble attempt to up its bargaining leverage vis a vis the [ORG P5  ] 1 . 
VADM Gortney echoed the Ambassador 's comments that such rhetoric negatively impacted the world 's view of [LOC Iran  ] and ultimately would undermine [LOC Iran  ] 's standing in the international community . 
On this same issue , the General expressed his pleasure with the [LOC White House  ] press statement on August 5 responding to the [MISC IRGC  ] commander 's comments regarding closure of the [ORG Strait ,  ] agreeing that [MISC Iranian  ] closure of the strait would be suicide ( i.e. , more harmful to [LOC Iran  ] 's own economic interests ) . 
He also commended the [LOC U.S.  ] for not escalating the rhetoric but instead putting [LOC Iran  ] 's comments into proper perspective . 
[LOC Iraq  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] Expansionism MUSCAT 00000565 002 OF 003 ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Prior to delving into the nuclear issues , [PER Ali Majid  ] acknowledged that [MISC Iranian  ] interference in [LOC Iraq  ] prevented achievement of a stable security environment there . 
He allowed that , at a minimum , [LOC Iran  ] indirectly supported [MISC Shi'a  ] militia in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Elaborating on his theme of " [MISC Iranian  ] expansionist " ideology , he noted that the [MISC Iranian  ] national radio broadcast commenced with the prelude " the voice of the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] from [LOC Tehran  ] . 
" Focusing on " from [LOC Tehran  ] , " he astutely raised [MISC Omani  ] concerns that such language revealed [LOC Iran  ] 's true intentions: a " greater [LOC Islamic Republic  ] " with [LOC Tehran  ] at its center . 
He further speculated that [LOC Iran  ] wanted to give the impression that the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] might already encompass " [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and even the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ali Majid  ] linked the nuclear issue and the interference in [LOC Iraq  ] by speculating that a resolution might entice [LOC Iran  ] into ceasing its interference in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He offered a rhetorical question on whether [LOC Iran  ] was serious about challenging the major powers or is it posturing in the media for domestic consumption . 
He conceded that he truly did not know the answer , but that with [LOC Iran  ] 's continued attitude on the nuclear issue , the security situation in [LOC Iraq  ] would remain unresolved . 
Citing [LOC Oman  ] 's preference for a non-military solution , he nevertheless acknowledged that a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] as opposed to war with [LOC Iran  ] posed " an extremely difficult dilemma for all of us . 
" Playing to Their Domestic Audience ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Acknowledging [LOC Iran  ] 's revolutionary zeal , the General attempted to put [MISC Iranian  ] public statements in perspective when he described as exaggerations those comments by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmud Ahmed-I Nejad  ] or other [MISC Iranian  ] figures , particularly regarding military capabilities . 
" Countries that believe they have some specific military weapons advantages usually keep them secret , " he averred . 
He asserted that in the end , all power resided with Supreme Leader [PER Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ali Majid  ] portrayed [MISC Shi'a  ] ideology as another factor complicating possible military conflict with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Iranian  ] leaders would not balk at sacrificing a quarter of their 60 million citizens in a military conflict . 
The [MISC Shi'a  ] tradition of martyrdom spanned 14 centuries . 
The annual self-flagellation of [MISC Shi'a  ] over 1,400 years served as an example of this martyr psychology . 
Beyond its [MISC Shi'a  ] ideology , pride in its Persian national identity compelled [LOC Iran  ] to demand international recognition and respect. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Returning back to comments about [ORG GCC  ] countries , General [PER Ali  ] singled out [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Bahrain  ] , and [LOC Qatar  ] as three [LOC Gulf  ] countries that probably would want the [LOC U.S.  ] to strike [LOC Iran  ] . 
However , he urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to determine whether such voices were speaking on the basis of logic or emotion . 
He likened private entreaties of these countries to the [LOC U.S.  ] for military action on [LOC Iran  ] to the [MISC Iraqi  ] opposition in exile providing the [LOC U.S.  ] false information on [LOC Iraq  ] that led to the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
At the beginning of the meeting , [PER Ali Majid  ] had noted that , in contrast to [LOC Oman  ] , other [ORG GCC  ] members did not always speak with candor or clarity , leaving [LOC Oman  ] to question the real motivations or intentions of its [ORG GCC  ] brethren. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Punctuating his comments about [LOC Iran  ] 's irrationality , [PER Ali Majid  ] pointed to [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Colonel Mu'ammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's recent comment that " [LOC Iran  ] is crazy " not to pay attention to the history of [LOC Yugoslavia  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , whose ignoring of [LOC U.S.  ] pressure resulted in their collapse . 
Interestingly , he referred to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's transformation from pariah to emerging member of the international community by noting that [PER Qadhafi  ] had once been " our enemy . 
" [LOC Oman  ] in a " [MISC Strategic Relationship  ] " with the [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) Shifting from [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Ali Majid  ] underscored [LOC Oman  ] 's " strategic relationship " with the [LOC U.S.  ] and highlighted [LOC Oman  ] 's cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on counterterrorism issues . 
He described [LOC Oman  ] 's zero tolerance for extremism and refusal to negotiate with terrorists as a policy established at least since 1970 ( the year of the [PER Sultan  ] 's assumed power ) . 
[LOC Oman  ] has been and continues to prepare itself to confront terrorism , he said , as it is not exempt from the plotting of terrorists . 
While [LOC Oman  ] is " encircled by problems " -- specifically mentioning [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] -- MUSCAT 00000565 003 OF 003 [LOC Oman  ] remains vigilant in preventing such problems from reaching the [PER Sultanate  ] . 
On the topic of [LOC Oman  ] 's partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] , he harkened back to when the [MISC Soviets  ] had sought a warm water port during the time of their invasion of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and were rebuffed by [PER Muscat  ] as an example of how " [LOC Oman  ] has stood at the side of the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" He also highlighted the irony that now the world faced " not the [MISC Soviets  ] but the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
" He quickly followed this by noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] would be wise to support talks with moderate members of the [ORG Taliban  ] , which [LOC Oman  ] encouraged as a way toward achieving security in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Participants in the meeting included [PER VADM Gortney  ] , the Ambassador , the admiral 's executive officer , Embassy [PER Muscat  ] 's OMC Chief , and [ORG GRPO  ] ( notetaker ) . 
[PER Sayyid Munthir  ] bin [PER Majid  ] al-Sa'id , head of the [ORG Royal Office Liaison and Coordination Service  ] participated as notetaker and translator for General [PER Ali  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In light of recent , more conciliatory statements by Minister Responsible for foreign Affairs Yusuf bin 'Alawi , [PER Ali Majid  ] 's blunt assessment of [MISC Iranian  ] intentions comes as refreshing reassurance of the official [MISC Omani  ] position on [LOC Iran  ] . 
While careful to flag [LOC Oman  ] 's longstanding preference for a non-military solution to the [LOC Iran  ] question and , less directly , [LOC Oman  ] 's inability to actively confront [MISC Iranian  ] obstinacy , the [LOC Sultanate  ] nevertheless maintains a clear-eyed view of [LOC Iran  ] , its increasingly threatening behavior and the potential repercussions for the region . 
His comments regarding attitudes and perceptions of fellow [ORG GCC  ] members were startling as they would appear to confirm oft stated views of [ORG GCC  ] counterparts of [LOC Oman  ] as the sometimes " odd man out " in the [ORG GCC  ] . 
[PER Ali Majid  ] 's comments suggest that while not entirely comfortable with this , the [MISC Omanis  ] acknowledge it . 
[PER Ali Majid  ] , as the [PER Sultan  ] 's top security official and advisor , is known for taking a more hard-line view of matters relating to regional security . 
However , given his closeness to the [PER Sultan  ] and his status as a member of the inner-most circle of the [PER Sultan  ] 's confidants , such views to a senior [LOC U.S.  ] officer can be assumed to accord with those of [ORG Qaboos  ] .
