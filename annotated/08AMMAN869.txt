End Summary . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] Threat ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Opening up the meeting , the [PER King  ] said that he believes that in the post-Annapolis peace talks , the parties will at some stage need [LOC U.S.  ] intervention to close gaps on core issues , as the parties will be unable to do so on their own . 
He urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] look at the [MISC Israeli/Palestinian  ] issue in its regional context . 
" Failure ( of the peace talks ) will give [LOC Iran  ] and its proxies exactly what they're looking for , " the [PER King  ] asserted . 
He stated his belief that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime is playing for time , working to block a solution to the [MISC Palestinian  ] problem before the end of the [MISC Bush  ] presidency , in order to strengthen the hands of militants throughout the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] was also advising the [MISC Syrian  ] leadership to wait for a new administration before embarking on any [LOC Golan  ] initiative . 
The [PER King  ] referred to the " [MISC Iranian  ] nemesis " and noted its " signature " in the conflicts of the region , and its presence by proxy on the [MISC Mediterranean  ] , as evidence of its growing influence and confidence . 
The [PER King  ] stressed that we should " connect the dots " between regional stability and [MISC Iranian  ] influence , and avoid compartmentalizing [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and the peace process . 
The [PER King  ] said failure on the peace process would make [LOC Iran  ] even more aggressive , compel a [PER Sunni Arab  ] response , and thus deepen conflict in [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
A lot was at stake in the peace process this year to preserve [LOC U.S.  ] interests in the region , he said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Queen Rania  ] chimed in on the issue as well , saying that success for moderate [MISC Arab  ] states was critically important in order to defeat [LOC Iran  ] 's agenda . 
She said that [LOC Jordan  ] was trying to become a model , a place where people say , " this is the kind of country we want to live in . 
" The Queen said this is the only strategy that will ultimately work in countering [MISC Iranian  ] influence - " this is what they're afraid of . 
" [LOC Jordan  ] 's economic reforms and support for education are part of that overall effort , but the going is tough - the Queen said that " sometimes it feels like we're swimming against the current . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S/NF ) Asked about direct [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Iran  ] , the [PER King  ] replied , " it depends on what you're trying to achieve . 
" He sees [LOC Iran  ] as a revolutionary power first and foremost . 
As such , it will either continue to expand ( both in terms of territory and in terms of influence ) , or it will implode . 
In this context , the [PER King  ] wondered , " are they willing to deal sensibly with you ? 
" If a mutually beneficial dialogue is started , the [PER King  ] said it should be behind the scenes , and at a low level . 
Any expansion to a more formal relationship would have to be accomplished with constant consultations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and its allies - it is not something that [MISC Arab  ] leaders should learn about from the press . 
In the end , however , the [PER King  ] betrayed his underlying skepticism that direct contact with [LOC Iran  ] would be fruitful . 
Youth and Opportunity --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [PER King  ] and Queen both touched briefly on outreach to youth in [LOC Jordan  ] . 
Citing a recent poll , the [PER King  ] indicated that the younger generation is concerned less with politics and more with jobs . 
He believes that building a solid middle class in [LOC Jordan  ] is the key to keeping radicalism under wraps . 
" If the youth have hope , they'll be a stabilizing factor , " added the Queen . 
In the end , they both cited supply and demand in the job market as the critical factor in [LOC Jordan  ] 's [ORG AMMAN  ] 00000869 002 OF 002 future . 
The [PER King  ] noted his recent visit to the poor rural town of [LOC Shobak  ] , in which he encountered a seamstress in a garment factory who was college-educated . 
Investing in education is a worthy goal , he noted , but jobs must be waiting for those trained workers if the economy is to advance as a whole . 
Visit Feedback -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [PER King  ] told the staffdel how pleased he was with his recent trip to the [LOC United States  ] . 
" It 's the best visit I 've had in seven and a half years . 
I left extremely optimistic , " he said .
