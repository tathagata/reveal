MAIER  ] - [ORG QUINN EMAIL  ] MAIL 06 MARCH 06 B. [PER B. LAMBERT  ] - ENGLEKEN EMAIL 21 FEB 06 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Ryan C. Crocker  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After reviewing the time line presented in ref A and B for moving forward with the [ORG UN  ] 1267 and domestic terrorism finance designation of [LOC Jamaat-ud-Dawa  ] ( JuD ) as an alter-ego of current terrorism finance designee [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyba  ] ( LeT ) , Ambassador requests a two-week delay in pre-notificaion , presentation to the [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG Committee  ] and in the domestic designation . 
[ORG Post’s  ] preferred timeline is: -- pre-notification: no earlier than 30 March -- request to [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG Committee:  ] no earlier than 15 April -- domestic action: no earlier than 15 April <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Post’s  ] reasoning for requesting this delay is based solely on force-protection considerations . 
[MISC DAC-PAK  ] personnel will continue flying helicopter sorties in [LOC North West Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) and Pakistan-administered [ORG Kashmir  ] ( [ORG AJK  ] ) until the end of March ; ground support personnel will be deployed in [LOC Muzaffarabad  ] , [ORG AJK  ] as long as the helicopters are flying . 
By the end of the first week of April , [LOC U.S.  ] military personnel will have redeployed from [ORG NWFP  ] and [ORG AJK  ] to the [LOC Islamabad  ] area , awaiting onward tranport out of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
In order not to increase the risk to our military personnel as they conclude their successful mission to [LOC Pakistan  ] , post recommends that no action on the JuD designation be taken until all [MISC DAC-PAK  ] operations have concluded and [ORG DAC  ] personnel are in the [LOC Islamabad  ] area .
