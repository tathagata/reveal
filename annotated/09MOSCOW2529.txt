( C ) SUMMARY: During consultations with [ORG GOR  ] officials on September 30 , Assistant Secretary of Defense ( [ORG ASD  ] ) for [ORG International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow  ] discussed ways to implement bilateral cooperation in a number of key areas of mutual interest . 
Both sides praised progress since the " reset " in [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relations during the first [MISC Obama-Medvedev  ] meetings , though both agreed that concrete actions are necessary to realize true cooperation . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] emphasized that the reset needs to be reciprocal and noted that [LOC Iran  ] would be a critical test case . 
Both sides expressed interest in further cooperation on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , especially in the sphere of counternarcotics . 
While the [MISC Administration 's missile  ] defense announcement has met with a generally positive reaction in the [MISC Russian  ] media , [ORG Duma  ] and [ORG Security Council  ] representatives made clear they had questions about the later phases of the new [LOC U.S.  ] plan and questioned whether the [LOC U.S.  ] would be prepared for cooperation going beyond information exchange . 
[MISC Russian  ] interlocutors acknowledged the dangers posed by [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , but stressed [LOC Moscow  ] 's skepticism about sanctions . 
Throughout the meetings , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] emphasized that [LOC Russia  ] 's efforts to assert a regional sphere of influence posed a threat to the reset in bilateral relations , and reiterated the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the sovereignty , independence , and territorial integrity of [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] and other partners in the region . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) OVERVIEW OF MEETINGS: [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] met with the following [ORG GOR  ] officials: [PER Viktor Mikhaylovich Zavarzin  ] ( [ORG Defense Committee  ] Chairman of the State [ORG Duma  ] ) , [PER Aleksandr A. Gorbunov  ] ( Chief of the [ORG Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation  ] of the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ) , General [PER Yuriy Nikolayevich Baluyevskiy  ] ( Deputy Secretary of the [ORG Security Council  ] and former Chief of [ORG Defense  ] ) , [PER Aleksey Nikolayevich Borodavkin  ] ( Deputy Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ) , and [PER Grigoriy Borisovich Karasin  ] ( First Deputy Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and State Secretary ) . 
He also met informally with academic experts and pundits and gave an interview to [ORG Interfax.  ] --------------------------------------------- --- [MISC U.S.-RUSSIAN  ] COOPERATION -- WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) At all meetings , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] and his [MISC Russian  ] interlocutors noted that [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] relations since the " reset " have been moving in the right direction , with opportunities for increased bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest . 
The [ORG Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] and associated working groups will be useful to inject momentum into our work . 
However , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] stressed that words alone or mere information exchanges are not enough , and the reset must be reciprocal . 
Both sides need to take action to implement agreements already concluded and to pave the way for additional areas of work and to identify concrete projects for cooperation . 
Mechanisms for enabling these efforts need to be established ( e.g. , the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] is currently undergoing a major organizational reform , which has hampered efforts for implementing the previously approved 2009 military-to-military work plan , and both sides need to ensure that planned events are conducted ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] agreed that next steps must be taken in other areas where we have agreed to cooperate previously ( e.g. , implementing a ballistic missile joint threat assessment , a [ORG Joint Data Exchange Center  ] , and the lethal transit overflight in support of efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that was agreed to at the July summit ) . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] must be united in addressing common threats , such as the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During his meeting with [ORG MOD International Military Cooperation  ] Chief [PER Gorbunov  ] , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] emphasized that transparency should be a major aspect of cooperation . 
[PER Vershbow  ] observed that [PER DoD  ] has been very open with the [MISC Russians  ] about sensitive issues . 
For example , [PER DoD  ] has shared information about efforts to help prepare [MISC Georgian  ] troops for deployment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in support of [ORG ISAF  ] efforts ; however , the [MISC Russians  ] have not reciprocated in this vein ( e.g. , their Zapad 2009 and Ladoga exercises ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Both [ORG Duma Defense Committee  ] Chair [PER Zavarzin  ] and [ORG Security Council  ] Deputy Secretary [PER Baluyevskiy  ] stressed that they are ready to work on all areas of mutual interest on the BILATERAL COOPERATION , [LOC IRAN  ] , [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] , MISSILE DEFENSE , MILITARY/DEFENSE COOPERATION condition that [LOC Russia  ] 's voice be heard . 
In particular , [PER Zavarzin  ] cited the [ORG NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council  ] ( 1997-2002 ) in which [LOC Russia  ] claims its views were ignored , the [ORG NATO-Russia Council  ] ( the [ORG PJC  ] 's successor ) in which [LOC Russia  ] " still did not have a full say , " and [LOC Russia  ] 's interest in working on anti-missile defense since 2000 which " did not pan out . 
" [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] acknowledged that both [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Russia  ] bore responsibility for areas where cooperation was not successful , but suggested that we need to look ahead rather than debate the past. --------------------------------------------- ------ [MISC RUSSIAN  ] DEFENSE MINISTRY REFORM POSES CHALLENGES TO MIL-TO-MIL COOPERATION --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russian  ] Ministry of Defense ( [ORG MOD  ] ) is in the midst of major reform . 
[ORG International Military Cooperation  ] Chief [PER Gorbunov  ] described the main goal of the reform as the creation of the " most effective military force in the world , " despite existing limitations ( e.g. , demographics , large landmass and borders , resources , and various threats along the borders ) . 
He identified two distinct processes as part of the reform -- building of the armed forces and control of the forces . 
Today , [LOC Russia  ] is focusing on building the forces , including a large influx of civilian personnel in management and specialist roles , improving pay/benefits of service members , improving quality of equipment , and trying to change decision-making processes at all levels . 
[PER Gorbunov  ] emphasized that these changes are intended to make [LOC Russia  ] a strong competitor , but also a reliable partner. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Gorbunov  ] explained that the reform process is having a significant impact on the [ORG Main Directorate  ] for [ORG International Military Cooperation  ] ( [ORG GUMVS  ] ) at the [ORG MOD  ] . 
The [ORG Foreign Liaison Directorate  ] ( [ORG UVS  ] ) is being closed on October 1 , and a new [ORG International Liaison Directorate  ] is being created . 
Because of these changes , correspondence will be slow over the next six weeks or so , which will impact the [ORG Attache Corps  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Gorbunov  ] offered his personal assistance during this period. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] raised the [ORG Bilateral Defense Consultations  ] ( [ORG BDC  ] ) which the [LOC U.S.  ] had proposed for November , and suggested the possibility of a broader dialogue between the [ORG MOD  ] and [PER DoD  ] on policy and strategy issues to complement State-MFA exchanges . 
Vershbow explained that [PER DoD  ] 's proposed [ORG BDC  ] topics ( including confidence-building measures and transparency , risk reduction and notification procedures , expanded military technical cooperation , etc . 
) were carefully considered , but we welcomed [LOC Russia  ] 's suggestions for additional topics . 
[PER Gorbunov  ] responded that the [ORG MoD  ] agrees with the general notion of the [ORG BDC  ] , but stipulated that the General Staff needs to identify the right experts to address topics to be discussed , and they plan to propose other topics for consideration . 
He gave no indication as to when a response would be provided. --------------------------------------------- -------------- [PER AFGHANISTAN: NARCO-TRAFFICKING  ] , [ORG TERRORISM  ] , ILLICIT FINANCE --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] 's meetings with Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Borodavkin  ] and [ORG MOD International Cooperation  ] Chief [PER Gorbunov  ] particularly focused on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Borodavkin  ] mentioned that [LOC Russia  ] views [LOC Afghanistan  ] not only as a threat , but as an opportunity for cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other countries ( e.g. , [ORG NATO  ] ) , and suggested that [ORG ISAF  ] could play an important role in fighting illegal drug trafficking . 
He recalled that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] had participated in the March 2009 conference held in [LOC Moscow  ] at which counternarcotics was a top priority. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) When asked by [PER Borodavkin  ] about whether more [LOC U.S.  ] troops will be sent to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] explained that General [PER McChrystal  ] 's assessment is being reviewed at the highest levels . 
He noted that while the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has not gone as well as hoped over the past six months , the [LOC U.S.  ] cannot allow the [MISC Taliban  ] to regain control . 
Expansion and training of the [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) , improving governance , and economic assistance are all still essential components of the [LOC U.S.  ] strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and we will continue to seek cooperation in these areas. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Borodavkin  ] introduced a number of proposals for increased [MISC Russian  ] contribution . 
He said that [LOC Russia  ] would like to launch cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the economic rehabilitation of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and referred to a clause in the July [MISC Summit Joint Statement  ] that without economic improvement , terrorism and other threats cannot be eliminated . 
[PER Borodavkin  ] suggested tripartite cooperation ( Russia-U.S.-Afghanistan ) to reconstruct the [ORG Soviet-era Salang Tunnel  ] to provide a much needed reliable transportation route . 
The [MISC Russians  ] have already undertaken a technical study on this project and [PER Borodavkin  ] said that with adequate resources , it would be a useful cooperative effort . 
( [PER Note: Borodavkin  ] 's staff confirmed that the [ORG MFA  ] has submitted a proposal to the [ORG State Department  ] on the [ORG Salang Tunnel  ] . 
) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] considers narco-trafficking to be its highest priority vis-a-vis [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Borodavkin  ] said [LOC Russia  ] is ready to help the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) and [ORG Interior Ministry  ] in these efforts . 
He noted that [LOC Russia  ] is already providing counternarcotics training to the [MISC Afghans  ] at the [ORG Domodedovo Center  ] , and mentioned [MISC Russian  ] counter-narcotics chief [PER Ivanov  ] 's statement that he is ready to provide increased assistance on bilateral and multilateral levels such as [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG OSCE  ] . 
Both Borodovkin and [ORG Vershbow  ] agreed that while the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] are currently working together on this and the related issue of threat financing through the [ORG Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] , we need to address these problems more forcefully . 
Illicit financing has been raised at [ORG Shanghai Cooperation Organization  ] ( [ORG SCO  ] ) and [ORG OSCE  ] meetings , offering one area of possible cooperation. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) At his meetings at the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC Russia  ] 's expression of interest in providing weapons and equipment to the [ORG ANSF  ] , and requested that any such help be made in the form of donations with no fees attached , as those charges would have to be paid for by the [LOC U.S.  ] He underscored that some of the equipment/weapon donation requests provided to [LOC Russia  ] are intended to support counter-narcotics efforts , so the [LOC U.S.  ] hopes [LOC Russia  ] will be able to provide this support . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] also asked that [LOC Russia  ] work with the [ORG Combined Security Transition Command  ] - [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( CSTC-A ) to ensure that [ORG ANSF  ] priority requirements are met and provided a list of requirements. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Borodavkin  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] will be able to supply limited numbers of weapons to the [ORG ANP  ] as aid and will consider selling more weapons to the [ORG ANP  ] and the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) . 
He also expressed concern that there are unlicensed ( counterfeit ) [MISC Russian  ] weapons on the market , which are of inferior quality . 
[PER Gorbunov  ] explained that donating equipment and weapons to [LOC Afghanistan  ] is a presidential decision , which would entail President [PER Medvedev  ] asking the military services to donate items from current stocks. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Borodavkin  ] also asked [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] 's perspectives on the [MISC European  ] proposal for a conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] after the new [MISC Afghan  ] government is established . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] saw merit in this idea as a means of seeking additional international support for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but noted that the timing of the initiative will depend on [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's domestic politics ; given the problems with the Presidential elections , conditions were not yet right. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Borodavkin  ] mentioned the work of the [LOC Afghanistan  ] sub-working group under the [ORG Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] and stated that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is hoping that Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] can reschedule his planned visit to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Borodavkin  ] requested that [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] pass on the invitation to Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] also raised the lethal transit agreement signed at the July summit in his meetings with [PER Gorbunov  ] , [PER Borodavkin  ] , and [PER Zavarzin  ] . 
He underscored the importance of a timely [ORG Duma  ] decision now that the General Authorization has been delivered . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] expressed hopes that the inaugural flight of the agreement could take place prior to Secretary of [ORG State Clinton  ] 's visit to [LOC Moscow  ] on October 12-14 . 
[PER Zavarzin  ] thought the [ORG Duma  ] would approve the agreement without any problem ; [PER Borodavkin  ] confirmed that the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] is working on the request , but warned that they do not have the sole voice on this matter. --------------------------------------------- MISSILE DEFENSE DECISION: NEITHER CONCESSION NOR THREAT TO [LOC RUSSIA  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] discussed the recent [LOC U.S.  ] missile defense decision during each of his consultations . 
In his meeting with [ORG Duma Defense Committee  ] Chairman [PER Zavarzin  ] , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] observed that the [MISC Russian  ] press may have been overly positive in its assessment of the September 17 announcement , focusing on the cancellation of the [ORG Program of Record  ] rather than the new [LOC MD  ] architecture . 
While the new phased adaptive approach to [LOC MD  ] does not pose a threat to [LOC Russia  ] , there will likely continue to be missile defense elements in central-eastern [LOC Europe  ] , with an [MISC SM-3  ] site in [LOC Poland  ] if the Government of [LOC Poland  ] agrees . 
However , the physical characteristics of the new system are different from the old , and the [LOC U.S.  ] believes [LOC Russia  ] has no basis for concern that the system could threaten its strategic forces . 
The new architecture will be more effective and be able to provide protection to vulnerable parts of [LOC Europe  ] more quickly . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] intends to be open about the new architecture , citing information available through congressional testimony and other open sources . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] aim is to make this a project for [ORG NATO  ] because the system is designed to protect all of [ORG NATO  ] 's territory ( starting in southeastern [LOC Europe  ] , where the current threat is , but eventually covering all of [ORG NATO  ] ) . <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] affirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] also views missile defense as an opportunity for cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] against a common threat , noting Secretary of Defense Gates' support for cooperation on missile defense . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] emphasized to [PER Zavarzin  ] and [ORG Security Council  ] Deputy Secretary [PER Baluyevskiy  ] that we should begin by implementing the [ORG Joint Data Exchange Center  ] ( [ORG JDEC  ] ) , on which the [MISC Russians  ] had postponed a decision until after the [LOC U.S.  ] missile defense announcement . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] told [PER Zavarzin  ] and [PER Baluyevskiy  ] that linking radars could follow , which could then lead to broader areas of cooperation that could be implemented either bilaterally or within the [ORG NATO-Russia Council  ] ( [ORG NRC  ] ) framework . 
He suggested that [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] experts explore concrete ways to implement military technical cooperation , noting that such cooperation would be mutually beneficial and would send a strong signal to [LOC Iran  ] that could help in resolving the nuclear issue. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Zavarzin  ] acknowledged that the [MISC Russian  ] political elite has no illusions about missile defense and understands this was a [LOC U.S.  ] decision with no quid pro quo expected from [LOC Russia  ] . 
[ORG Security Council  ] Deputy Secretary [PER Baluyevskiy  ] noted that the system 's planned capability to intercept ICBMs does raise some of the same concerns [LOC Russia  ] has had before . 
[PER Zavarzin  ] agreed that we need to identify specific projects to work on together , but that [LOC Russia  ] wants to ensure its voice will be heard . 
Both [PER Zavarzin  ] and [PER Baluyevskiy  ] stressed the need to develop bilateral cooperation methods , potentially by linking existing [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] early warning systems to gather and share information about threats . 
They also asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to go even farther , to include joint technology projects , which would of greater interest to [LOC Russia  ] than information exchange. --------------------------- [MISC U.S.-RUSSIAN  ] UNITY ON [LOC IRAN  ] ? --------------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] discussed the serious test that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program will pose to both [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] in the coming months , noting that our interests coincide in many ways , even if they are not identical . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , he stated , wants to see if diplomacy can succeed , but we need to be realistic and be prepared for tougher measures if diplomacy fails . 
Citing the recently exposed covert nuclear facility and the recent missile tests , [ORG Vershbow  ] described the situation as urgent , and said that the [LOC U.S.  ] was encouraged by President [PER Medvedev  ] 's recent comment that sanctions might become necessary. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] mentioned that the [MISC Islamic  ] world is very concerned about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program ( e.g. , several of its [MISC Arab  ] neighbors have asked the [LOC U.S.  ] for [MISC Patriot  ] missiles and other measures to protect them against [MISC Iranian  ] attack ) . 
The ability of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] to work together on the [LOC Iran  ] challenge over the next few months will be just as important as our work on missile defense will be over the next few years . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] stressed that if we fail to stop [LOC Iran  ] 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , we could have a " volatile , possibly explosive , " situation in the [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) In their respective meetings , [ORG Duma Defense Committee  ] Chairman [PER Zavarzin  ] and [ORG Security Council  ] Deputy Secretary [PER Baluyevskiy  ] agreed that [LOC Iran  ] is a concern , but said that [LOC Russia  ] continues to work closely with them and that sanctions cannot be pursued until after diplomatic efforts have been made . 
Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Borodavkin  ] expressed concern that sanctions could be ineffective ( citing past experience in [LOC Iraq  ] ) and could have a negative impact on the wider [MISC Islamic  ] world. ---------------------------------------- RUSSIA'S " SPHERE OF PRIVILEGED INTEREST " ---------------------------------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] stated in several meetings that our interaction in the [MISC post-Soviet  ] space continues to be a sensitive issue and , if not handled carefully , could undermine recent gains in bilateral relations . 
In this regard , President [PER Medvedev  ] 's proposed amendment to the law on use of [MISC Russian  ] forces overseas has raised many questions . 
[ORG Duma Defense Committee  ] Chairman [PER Zavarzin  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] will not interfere with the [LOC U.S.  ] as it engages with nations in the region , and that there is no cause for concern regarding the legislation about use of [MISC Russian  ] forces -- it is intended to protect [MISC Russian  ] citizens living in those countries and that other countries have similar provisions. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) UKRAINE: [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] spoke of his visit to [LOC Ukraine  ] immediately preceding his arrival in [LOC Moscow  ] , and cited [MISC Ukrainian  ] concerns about [MISC Russian  ] respect for [LOC Ukraine  ] 's sovereignty and borders . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] stated that the [LOC U.S.  ] continues to support the 1994 [LOC Budapest Memorandum  ] on [ORG Security Assurances  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] 's freedom to choose its security relationships , and encourages [LOC Russia  ] to reaffirm its adherence as well . 
He suggested that President [PER Medvedev  ] 's open letter to [LOC Ukraine  ] had been counter-productive . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] favors close and mutually beneficial [MISC Russian-Ukrainian  ] relations -- this is not a zero-sum game. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Karasin  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] is [LOC Russia  ] 's closest neighbor , and is a " key partner " in international activities . 
[LOC Russia  ] is not trying to influence [LOC Ukraine  ] , but wants a stable [LOC Ukraine  ] and a secure neighborhood . 
He also said that [LOC Russia  ] cannot ignore attempts to depict it as a major threat to [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] will be visiting [LOC Ukraine  ] this week to meet with [MISC Ukrainian  ] Acting Foreign Minister [PER Khandogiy  ] and there even is a possibility that [PER Medvedev  ] and [MISC Ukrainian  ] President [PER Yushchenko  ] will meet at a summit of [MISC CIS  ] countries shortly after that . 
[PER Karasin  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] wants to deal with [LOC Ukraine  ] in a normal way and that [MISC Ukrainian  ] citizens are the ones to decide what they want. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) [ORG GEORGIA: Security Council  ] Deputy Secretary [PER Baluyevskiy  ] , [PER Zavarzin  ] , and [PER Karasin  ] asked why the [LOC U.S.  ] is providing military assistance to [LOC Georgia  ] when it threatens stability in the [LOC Caucasus  ] region . 
This causes concern and [LOC Russia  ] cannot allow renewed aggression against [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] explained that as a matter of principle , the [LOC U.S.  ] will help [LOC Georgia  ] protect its sovereignty and independence , but stated that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not rearming [LOC Georgia  ] , as [LOC Russia  ] has repeatedly alleged . 
Since the August 2008 war , there has been no [LOC U.S.  ] lethal assistance to [LOC Georgia  ] ; DoD funds were transferred to the [ORG State Department  ] for humanitarian purposes . 
In the short term , the [LOC U.S.  ] is proceeding with great care and focusing on training , education , and helping prepare [LOC Georgia  ] to participate in [LOC Afghanistan  ] under the command of [LOC U.S.  ] Forces . 
At the same time , [LOC Georgia  ] is a sovereign state with the right to self-defense . 
We do not accept any arms embargo , and we may provide weapons to [LOC Georgia  ] in the future. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) [PER Zavarzin  ] made a point of saying that [LOC Russia  ] does not dispute [LOC Georgia  ] 's sovereignty , but it cannot allow new acts of aggression ; a regional consensus is necessary . 
[PER Karasin  ] said that , in [LOC Russia  ] 's view , the current [MISC Georgian  ] leadership is irresponsible . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] reiterated that the [LOC U.S.  ] had made clear to [LOC Georgia  ] that there is no military option regarding [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] and that the [MISC Georgians  ] need to take a long view on reintegration of the territories . 
[PER Karasin  ] noted some successes in repairing relations since last August , including the [LOC Geneva  ] talks that enable the [MISC Georgians  ] to talk directly to the [ORG Abkhaz  ] and [MISC Ossetians  ] . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] said that stability in the [LOC Caucasus  ] and creating conditions to help improve [MISC Georgian-Russian  ] relations is very important to the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) [PER Karasin  ] mentioned the [ORG EU  ] independent report on the August 2008 conflict in [LOC Georgia  ] , which had just been released on the afternoon of September 30 . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] mentioned that he looked forward to reading the report and stressed that even if we do not agree completely on the report 's findings , we need to look ahead and promote stability in the region , including an international presence in the territories . 
[PER Karasin  ] said that international presence in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] must be discussed with the [ORG Abkhaz  ] and the [MISC Ossetians  ] ( not the [MISC Russians  ] ) . 
[LOC Russia  ] has " bilateral agreements " with them , and [MISC Russian  ] border guards are protecting them to help restore stability. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) [PER Karasin  ] asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] intends to establish a military presence in [LOC Georgia  ] by contributing personnel to the [ORG EU  ] Monitoring Mission ( [ORG EUMM  ] ) . 
This would be a serious problem for [LOC Russia  ] , as they believe it would send the wrong message to President [PER Saakashvili  ] that he could use force again . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said there has been lots of speculation on this subject that was not based on fact . 
If the [ORG EUMM  ] did make such a request in the future , the [LOC U.S.  ] would consider it , but this would likely involve civilian monitors . 
[ORG Vershbow  ] added that [LOC Russia  ] needs to fully withdraw its forces from positions beyond the line of the outbreak of hostility , per the [MISC Medvedev-Sarkozy  ] agreement , since this non-compliance was a continuing source of tension . 
[PER Karasin  ] insisted that [LOC Russia  ] was in compliance , while acknowledging that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not see it that way. ------------ OTHER ISSUES ------------ <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) [ORG EUROPEAN SECURITY TREATY:  ] In response to [PER Baluyevskiy  ] 's inquiry about President [PER Medvedev  ] 's proposed [ORG European Security Treaty  ] , [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] acknowledged there could be ways to improve the effectiveness of existing conflict-prevention mechanisms , but that the [LOC U.S.  ] and most of our allies did not see a need for new structures or a new treaty . 
However , the [LOC U.S.  ] is ready to engage with [LOC Russia  ] on this issue in the [LOC Corfu  ] process and other fora. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( C ) CENTRAL ASIA: [PER Karasin  ] inquired about the [ORG Manas Transit Center  ] and the numbers of [LOC U.S.  ] military personnel that would be deployed under the new arrangement . 
[ORG ASD Vershbow  ] said that he did not have precise figures . 
However , in contrast with the previous agreement , security for the facility is now being provided by the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] , which reduced the [LOC U.S.  ] presence somewhat. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( U ) [ORG ASD Vershbow  ] has cleared this cable .
