( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a February 4-5 visit to [LOC Madrid  ] , Assistant USTR for [LOC Europe  ] met with government officials , private sector representatives , and an opposition politician to discuss [ORG USG  ] concerns over [MISC Internet  ] piracy in [LOC Spain  ] and the government 's legislative proposal . 
Content industry representatives described in some detail how piracy is hurting their business . 
They support the government 's proposal as a step in the right direction but are unanimous that further action is required . 
The rights-holders are very concerned that the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) may defeat or hold up the legislation for political gain , and urged the [ORG USG  ] to continue to reach out to the [ORG PP  ] on this issue . 
On the government side , State Secretary Ros and [ORG DG Corral  ] underscored the government 's commitment to get the legislation passed but asked for [ORG USG  ] help not only with the [ORG PP  ] but with two smaller parties whose votes could affect the outcome . 
[ORG PP  ] Deputy [PER Alvaro Nadal  ] told [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] that his party might be able to support the anti-piracy provisions with amendments to give the judiciary a more prominent in the process of shutting down websites , but noted that the politics of the issue were complicated and that the [ORG PP  ] vigorously opposes other provisions of the Law for a [ORG Sustainable Economy  ] ( [ORG LES  ] ) . 
[PER AUSTR Wilson  ] also met with Trade and [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials to discuss [MISC EU Presidency  ] trade issues and [LOC WTO/Doha Round  ] negotiations . 
He also gave an interview for a major newspaper 's Sunday economic supplement . 
End Summary . 
THE [ORG COALITION  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At a lunch hosted by the [ORG Coalition of Creators  ] and Content Industries , [PER AUSTR  ] outlined the [ORG USG  ] approach to promoting worldwide intellectual property protection and the Special 301 process . 
Representatives of the film , music , electronic and video games , and book publishing industries attended , as well as officials representing major copyright management entities ( collecting societies ) . 
[ORG Coalition  ] president [PER Aldo Olcese  ] explained how the [ORG Coalition  ] had come up with the " [MISC Spanish  ] model " to combat piracy , which involves targeting commercial-scale pirate websites instead of individual users . 
Cultural industries , he said , do not want to make enemies of millions of [MISC Internet  ] users by threatening them with punishment . 
Depriving them of unauthorized content by shutting down or blocking websites is a more practical method , in his view. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Not all [ORG Coalition  ] members agree fully with this approach . 
[PER Antonio Guisasola  ] of the Music Producers of [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG Promusicae  ] ) and [PER James Armstrong  ] of [ORG Sony Computers  ] ( on behalf of the digital games industry ) expressed concern that the government 's initiative would leave much peer-to-peer ( P2P ) activity undisturbed . 
The " [MISC Spanish  ] model " is essentially a watered-down version of an earlier proposal by the [ORG Coalition  ] in negotiations with [ORG Internet Service Providers'  ] ( [ORG ISP  ] ) association , [PER Redtel  ] . 
Those negotiations were suspended in April 2009 and most [ORG Coalition  ] members now believe that [PER Redtel  ] never had any intention of entering into an agreement . 
Now that the government has submitted its legislative proposal , [PER Redtel  ] is no longer interested in negotiating . 
[PER Guisasola  ] confirmed that [LOC Spain  ] 's music industry favors moving [LOC Spain  ] to the Priority Watch List in this year 's Special 301 review . 
[PER Armstrong  ] indicated that the computer games industry is of similar mind. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Like the GOS itself , industry representatives are concerned about prospects for the legislation 's passage . 
On January 20 , a collection of small blocs in [ORG Congress  ] held a press conference demanding that the government withdraw its proposal and threatening to boycott deliberations in the subcommittee on culture . 
At the last minute the main opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) disassociated itself from this initiative , as did the smaller [MISC Catalan  ] party , [ORG Convergencia i Unio  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] ) . 
Nevertheless , government and rights-holders remain concerned that the [ORG PP  ] will defeat or stall the legislative proposal . 
[PER Aldo Olcese  ] noted that the [ORG PP  ] has advocated for an entirely judicial proceeding , as opposed to the government 's mixed administrative-judicial proceeding , to shut down or block websites . 
While in principle this seems not unreasonable , in light of experience with [LOC Spain  ] 's judiciary it would likely be unsustainably slow and cumbersome . 
[ORG Coalition  ] members urged [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] and the Embassy to remind [ORG PP  ] legislators of their ideological interest in protecting private property and their strong bond with the [LOC United States  ] . 
OPPOSITION MEMBER OF CONGRESS [LOC MADRID  ] 00000179 002.3 OF 004 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Assistant USTR [PER Wilson  ] met February 5 with [PER Alvaro Nadal  ] , a [ORG PP  ] Deputy who is one of his party 's experts on economic issues . 
[PER Wilson  ] outlined the purpose of his visit and the concerns of [LOC U.S.  ] government and private industry about the [ORG IPR  ] situation in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He characterized the government 's proposal as encouraging while noting that it won't entirely solve the piracy problem . 
He also acknowledged that the relationship between the [MISC Internet  ] and [ORG IPR  ] protection is controversial in the [LOC United States  ] ; in that context , the vocal opposition of the [MISC Internet  ] users' community in [LOC Spain  ] to the government 's proposal is not so surprising . 
[PER Wilson  ] recognized that the [ORG PP  ] will be influential in the legislative process and asked for [PER Nadal  ] 's views on how the bill will fare and how the [ORG USG  ] can be most constructive. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nadal  ] divided the issue into two parts: policy and politics . 
With respect to policy , he said the [ORG PP  ] is not far from the government on the website shut-down provisions in the draft [ORG Sustainable Economy  ] Law ( [ORG LES  ] ) . 
The [ORG PP  ] supports strong IP protection and agrees that something must be done about pirate websites . 
It makes sense to deter and punish illicit activity . 
But the government proposes a mixed administrative-judicial process , whereas the [ORG PP  ] wants a 100 percent judicial process , which [PER Nadal  ] said the [MISC Constitution  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] legal tradition require . 
He argued that an administrative body - in this case an [ORG Intellectual Property Commission  ] affiliated with the [ORG Culture Ministry  ] - cannot play a decisive role in an enforcement action that touches on fundamental rights such as communications and freedom of expression . 
The [ORG PP  ] 's objection is purely legal , and this is its only area of contention with the proposal. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Politically , however , there are other issues . 
The [ORG PP  ] led the opposition in 2006 to the " digital canon , " under which computers , blank disks , and other media are taxed with to compensate rights-holders with a " private copy levy . 
" ( [MISC Note:  ] The canon is an entirely separate issue from P2P and piracy concerns , though they are often confused and conflated in the public mind . 
) As a result , the [ORG PP  ] is close to the [MISC Internet  ] technology and service provider community . 
On the other hand , relations between the [ORG PP  ] and [LOC Spain  ] 's cultural establishment and elites are not good . 
From the [ORG PP  ] 's perspective , movie stars , directors , prominent authors , and other cultural icons always work on behalf of the ruling [ORG PSOE  ] and against the [ORG PP  ] . 
Thus , some voices in the party want to oppose the content providers by holding up the bill which so many artists and entertainers - the same ones who campaigned for President [PER Zapatero  ] - are lobbying for . 
Some also believe that the legislation would mainly benefit foreign industry . 
The [ORG PP  ] , which hopes to return to power in the near future , has to be accountable to its voters. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A complicating factor is that many other provisions of the draft [ORG LES  ] are anathema to the [ORG PP  ] , which believes they represent a philosophically misguided approach to restructuring the economy . 
Even if the party can support the anti-Internet piracy provisions , it will not easily swallow the law as a whole . 
However , [PER Nadal  ] said , the [ORG PP  ] strongly supports fair trade , open business relations , the free market , and protection of private property . 
It also cherishes strong its ties to the [LOC U.S.  ] and close affinity with the [LOC United States  ] , regardless of which party is in power there . 
[PER Nadal  ] suggested the [ORG USG  ] not overtly or publicly express support for the law , since so many of its advocates are leftists and some are even anti-American in their orientation . 
In the end , he intimated , the government may round up enough votes from small parties to pass the legislation without [ORG PP  ] support . 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] also met February 5 with State Secretary for [ORG Telecommunications  ] and the [ORG Information Society Francisco Ros  ] , whom he had seen two weeks earlier during [PER Ros  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Ros  ] reiterated that the GOS is strongly committed to passing the legislation but noted that public and industry reaction had not been entirely positive . 
The previous day , content providers , service providers , consumer groups , and labor unions met with the [ORG Advisory Committee on Telecommunications  ] and the [ORG Information Society  ] ( [ORG CATSI  ] ) , one of the many consultative committees that must weigh in on the bill before [ORG Congress  ] can begin debating it . 
The [ORG Coalition  ] expressed support for the government 's proposal , but most other participants called for its withdrawal . 
According to press reports , [MISC Internet  ] users' groups ( " [MISC Internautas  ] " ) presented a petition signed by 22,000 citizens opposing the measures. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ros  ] stressed the importance of digital content to all [MISC European  ] countries and said that in his [ORG EU  ] Presidency-related MADRID 00000179 003.3 OF 004 meetings in [LOC Brussels  ] , he has called on other [ORG EU  ] Member States to coordinate and develop a common approach to [MISC Internet  ] piracy , because no one country can succeed on its own in this battle . 
He said that as more economic activity moves online , there will be a " very difficult " 5-10-year transition period . 
New business models are needed to take advantage of the [MISC Internet  ] 's potential . 
With respect to piracy , the important thing is to decide on a course of action that can be implemented , he emphasized ; putting in place ineffective or inappropriate measures would be counter-productive. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ros  ] said his meetings in [LOC Washington  ] had gone very well . 
Within the [ORG International intellectual Property Alliance  ] ( [ORG IIPA  ] ) , which is preparing its recommendations for the [ORG USG  ] 's Special 301 review , he identified several different opinions . 
The [ORG Motion Picture Association of America  ] ( [ORG MPAA  ] ) , he said , is very pleased with the government 's proposal . 
( Comment: This may be a slight overstatement of the [ORG MPAA  ] 's position . 
) The [ORG Business Software Alliance  ] ( [ORG BSA  ] ) is satisfied with the [ORG GOS  ] , with whom its members partner on a " legal software " campaign that has been effective . 
The computer games industry , he acknowledged , is " not happy , " a circumstance that surprised [PER Ros  ] . 
And the biggest problem is the music industry , which he said " doesn't give any value to [ the [ORG GOS  ] 's ] decision and commitment , " or to the political realities that complicate the government 's task. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ros  ] expressed disappointment that private sector groups have not given [LOC Spain  ] credit for its efforts . 
The music industry suffers the most from digital piracy , he acknowledged , and is ahead of the other industries in offering legal content online , but there still isn't enough legal content available . 
The government can encourage , support , and even help fund portals for legitimate content , he said , but industry has to take the lead . 
[PER Wilson  ] cited industry arguments that services offering legal content haven't prospered in [LOC Spain  ] due to competition from free downloads . 
Both dissuasive measures and legal offer need to move forward together. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] assured State Secretary [PER Ros  ] that the [ORG USG  ] does not pick models and does not favor any one specific approach to combating piracy . 
Our concern is that [LOC Spain  ] implement measures that will be effective . 
[LOC Spain  ] is under the spotlight in this years' Special 301 review , he said . 
Some industry associations may want [LOC Spain  ] moved to the Priority [MISC Watch List  ] , though others may believe it would be a mistake to increase pressure on [LOC Spain  ] when it has begun to act . 
The [ORG USG  ] 's decision will be informed by industry 's recommendation , but will also consider the full range of views within the [LOC U.S.  ] Government . 
Understanding the sensitivities , the [ORG USG  ] will be careful about how it announces the ultimate result . 
Stressing that the [ORG USG  ] 's Special 301 review process is only just under way and without prejudging outcomes , [PER Wilson  ] sought to downplay any expectation of [LOC Spain  ] being removed from the [MISC Watch List  ] in 2010 given the size of the problem and the fact that the legislation will not have passed by late April. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] described briefly to [PER Ros  ] his meeting with [ORG PP  ] Deputy [PER Nadal  ] . 
He asked whether the [MISC PP-proposed  ] 100 percent judicial process could be problematic given constraints on judicial resources . 
[PER Ros  ] noted that the purpose of a mixed administrative-judicial process is to speed things up . 
Judges take a long time to investigate and decide . 
A panel of independent experts will not be biased and will work faster . 
[PER Ros  ] stressed that the [ORG GOS  ] cannot do any more than it is doing , changing the law to make the system work better . 
He closed by saying that [LOC Spain  ] 's highest [MISC Internet  ] priorities for its [ORG EU Presidency  ] are [ORG IPR  ] protection and cyber-security. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At a lunch hosted by the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( see paragraph 20 ) , [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] spoke with [PER Guillermo Corral  ] , [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] Director General for [ORG Cultural Policy and Industries  ] , who accompanied State Secretary [PER Ros  ] on his [LOC Washington  ] visit in late January . 
[PER Corral  ] indicated that the ruling [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) is having trouble with some of its own Deputies and regional party officials over the proposed legislation . 
In light of perceptions that the [ORG GOS  ] is being pressured by the [ORG USG  ] to toughen its anti-piracy regime , [PER Corral  ] thought it would probably be counter-productive for the [MISC Embassy  ] to approach [ORG PSOE  ] opponents of the initiative . 
He did , however , suggest that the [MISC Embassy  ] talk to Deputies from the regional [ORG Convergencia i Unio  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] - [ORG Cataluna  ] ) and [ORG Basque National Party  ] ( [ORG PNV  ] - [ORG Basque Country  ] ) about the legislation . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG PNV  ] joined the January 20 call for the government to withdraw the legislation ; [ORG CiU  ] did not . 
Post will follow up . 
End Note . 
) [PER Corral  ] also expressed concern that the upcoming Special 301 decision might affect the legislative debate ; [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] said he understood this concern and said [ORG USG  ] wanted the Special 301 review MADRID 00000179 004.3 OF 004 for [LOC Spain  ] to be constructive. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) In a follow-up conversation with Econoff , [PER Corral  ] sought to clarify his comments in [LOC Washington  ] on how the [ORG GOS  ] legislative proposal might affect some P2P activity . 
He acknowledged that many music files are transferred from one individual [MISC Internet  ] account to another without passing through a website that can be blocked , but said that some other P2P traffic passes through sites , and there are indexation and linking pages , which he characterized as " P2P crossroads . 
" Judges in [LOC Spain  ] have declined to sanction owners or managers of such sites due to lack of a clearly defined profit motive as required by the [ORG Penal Code  ] and the Prosecutor General 's 2006 Circular , but if an administrative body were to order them blocked , he believes judges would probably authorize it . 
[PER Corral  ] also commented that there is a trend for more music to be downloaded from streaming sites , which would be subject to shut-down or blocking under the proposed legislation . 
TRADE AND THE [ORG EU  ] PRESIDENCY <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] also discussed a range of trade issues , especially related to [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU Presidency  ] , with Secretary General for Trade [PER Alfredo Bonet  ] , and again at a lunch hosted by MFA Director General for [ORG EU Affairs Alfonso Diez Torres  ] . 
[PER Bonet  ] commented on some of the challenges of implementing the [LOC Lisbon Treaty  ] , especially the [ORG European Parliament  ] 's ( [ORG EP  ] ) role in approving legislation and international agreements . 
The [ORG EP  ] , he said , is not happy that the [ORG European Council  ] can apply new agreements provisionally while waiting for the [ORG EP  ] to approve them . 
There are a number of issues that need to be deconflicted of the [ORG EP  ] is to approve the [MISC Free Trade Agreement  ] with [LOC South Korea  ] and other important legislation. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] praised the very positive and helpful role [MISC Spanish  ] officials played in recent negotiations in [LOC Guadalajara  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] towards an [MISC Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement  ] ( [ORG ACTA  ] ) . 
Thanks to [LOC Spain  ] 's leadership , negotiators made progress on the Agreement 's criminal enforcement chapter . 
[PER Bonet  ] cited [ORG ACTA  ] as another area where the [ORG EP  ] is skeptical , criticizing a lack of transparency. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On [LOC Doha Round  ] negotiations , [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] cited a difficult trade policy environment in the [LOC U.S.  ] , but noted President [PER Obama  ] 's reference to [LOC Doha  ] and [LOC FTAs  ] in the State of the Union address as a positive sign . 
Priority [LOC FTAs  ] include [LOC Panama  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , and [LOC South Korea  ] . 
[PER Bonet  ] said [LOC Spain  ] as [ORG EU Council  ] President would keep pressing on [LOC Doha  ] . 
[PER Bonet  ] noted the [ORG EU  ] also has issues to be resolved with [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[ORG FTA  ] negotiations with [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , and now [LOC Ecuador  ] remain difficult . 
He also discussed briefly implementation of the banana agreement and [ORG FTA  ] negotiations with [LOC Central America  ] , which have been suspended since July . 
On the [ORG Transatlantic Economic Council  ] ( [ORG TEC  ] ) , [PER Bonet  ] said that even though there will be no [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] in May as [LOC Spain  ] had hoped , the [ORG GOS  ] still wanted a [ORG TEC  ] meeting during its Presidency , though definition of objectives , schedule , and other details remain to be worked out . 
[PER AUSTR Wilson  ] noted that [ORG NSC  ] and the [ORG European Commission  ] are discussing what to do about the [LOC TEC.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) MFA DG [ORG Diez Torres  ] covered some of the same issues in his February 5 lunch with [PER AUSTR Wilson  ] . 
He said he would soon accompany MFA State Secretary for [MISC Latin American  ] de [MISC Laiglesia  ] on a trip to the region to try to progress on the [LOC FTAs  ] . 
He noted also that during a recent visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] , a [ORG European Commission  ] DG had sensed reduced interest on the part of [ORG USG  ] officials in engaging with the [ORG EU  ] on trade issues , even before the announcement that President [PER Obama  ] would not attend a proposed [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] . 
[PER Wilson  ] responded by noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] regards the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] trade relationship as uniquely mature and well-functioning , and suggested that [MISC European  ] trade officials should have greater confidence in existing channels for dialogue and communication on trade issues . 
COMMENT <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOS  ] remains committed to getting its legislative proposal on [MISC Internet  ] piracy through [ORG Congress  ] , but at this time the outlook is uncertain . 
Post will escalate its engagement with government , opposition , and other stakeholders throughout the Special 301 process and beyond . 
End Comment. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 .
