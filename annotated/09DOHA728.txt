( C ) The Deputy Secretary extended USG appreciation to the Prime Minister for [LOC Qatar  ] , s support for the victims of Hurricane [PER Katrina  ] . 
The PM observed in response that " We might have our own [PER Katrina  ] , " an apparent reference to security concerns arising from [LOC Qatar  ] , s relationship with [LOC Iran  ] .

( S ) [PER DepSec Poneman  ] asked [ORG HBJ  ] for his views on [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear program . 
The Deputy Secretary noted that the USG had entered into recent discussions with [LOC Iran  ] not out of naivet , but as an effort to address a humanitarian concern ( the need for medical isotopes ) while also attempting to remove a meaningful amount of special nuclear material . 
Even though the effort had not to date resulted in [MISC Iranian  ] agreement , it had borne fruit in the form of [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] support for the most recent resolution of the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] in [LOC Vienna  ] . 
The PM expressed his skepticism that the [LOC West  ] would be able to reach a deal with [LOC Iran  ] , s leaders , saying " I , d be surprised and shocked if the [MISC Iranians  ] do a deal . 
You always think you have a deal with them and then you don , t . 
" He continued , " The [ORG EU  ] , [ORG Chirac  ] , and Solana...they all thought they had a deal.. . 
[PER Solana  ] said two weeks ; I advised him it would take two years . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Asked for his advice on how best to approach the [MISC Iranians  ] , [ORG HBJ  ] said it is imperative that the [MISC Iranians  ] commit to draft any deal , including a timetable . 
He reiterated that it is important to " make them tell you ( what they will do ) . 
Otherwise they will say 'yes , but...' and the 'but' will be worse than a 'no.' 
" The Deputy Secretary countered that , " They don , t want to make a proposal . 
" To which [ORG HBJ  ] responded , " You don , t understand . 
Even [MISC Mousavi  ] can , t make a deal ! 
" [PER Poneman  ] pressed the issue , saying the [LOC U.S.  ] would not be offering a better deal than what is currently on the table . 
The Prime Minster said , " I know , but this is the way they are . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Referring to the current proposal on the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) , Deputy Secretary [PER Poneman  ] stressed: " This is a fleeting opportunity . 
If they don , t take this deal , what comes next is worse . 
" The PM noted that the [MISC Iranians  ] frequently press the [MISC Qataris  ] to have dialogue on their shared natural gas field and attempt to expand the dialogue to include other subjects . 
[ORG HBJ  ] said that the [MISC Qataris  ] " are always throwing cold water on their ideas . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) On [LOC Qatar  ] , s close ties with [LOC Iran  ] , the PM added that he knows the [LOC U.S.  ] becomes upset at times by what it hears about the [MISC Qatar/Iran  ] relationship . 
However he characterized the relationship as one in which " They lie to us , and we lie to them . 
" [PER Poneman  ] replied by underscoring that " It would be helpful if everywhere they went , they ( the [MISC Iranians  ] ) heard the same thing . 
" The PM said for [LOC Qatar  ] , s part , he had told [LOC Iran  ] that it should " listen to the [LOC West  ] , s proposal or there will be military action . 
If not by the [LOC U.S.  ] , then by the [MISC Israelis  ] by the middle of next year . 
" [PER Poneman  ] observed that the [MISC Russians  ] had pressed the [MISC Iranians  ] hard during the [LOC Vienna  ] negotiations , reinforcing the view that [MISC Iranian  ] failure to accept the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] deal would lead back to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
The PM asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] believes the [MISC Russians  ] were in agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the possibility of harsher measures . 
[PER Poneman  ] replied that , for now , the [MISC Russians  ] appear to be holding a similar line to the USG on the [ORG TRR  ] deal and we remain in close contact with [LOC Moscow.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
