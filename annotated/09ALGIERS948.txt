( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: [MISC Algerian  ] Minister [PER Delegate  ] for [ORG Defense Guenaizia  ] told visiting Deputy Assistant Secretary of [ORG Defense  ] ( [ORG DASD  ] ) Ambassador [PER Vicki Huddleston  ] October 19 that the [MISC Algerian  ] , [MISC Mauritanian  ] , [MISC Nigerien  ] and [MISC Malian  ] chiefs of staff had agreed to set up a regional command for joint counter terrorism operations at [LOC Tamanrasset  ] in southern [LOC Algeria  ] . 
He indicated the command could eventually be expanded to include [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Burkina Faso  ] and [LOC Chad  ] . 
For its part , [LOC Algeria  ] was determined that terrorists not be allowed to set up logistics , training and supply bases along its frontiers , i.e. , in neighboring countries , with the intent of delivering weapons and explosives to [LOC Algeria  ] . 
[LOC Algeria  ] has taken the lead in sensitizing its southern neighbors to the nature of the threat and the need for combined action . 
[PER Huddleston  ] asked how the [LOC U.S.  ] and others could support this effort . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] replied that intelligence-sharing was fundamental . 
So was provision of certain technical means , like IED jammers . 
A delegation from [ORG Northrop Grumman  ] was coming to [LOC Algeria  ] this week to discuss the capabilities of a [ORG Boeing  ] 737 aircraft with a modified [MISC AWACS  ] array . 
But the [LOC U.S.  ] could perhaps assist most before the impending [LOC Bamako  ] summit by helping secure the requisite top-level political will among [LOC Sahel  ] countries that would make the summit a success and facilitate effective military cooperation . 
Here , he contended , the biggest problem was the [MISC Malian  ] political leadership . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] could help by talking to [LOC Mali  ] and others with influence in [LOC Mali  ] to ensure the necessary level of political will was there . 
[PER Huddleston  ] said she expected the [LOC U.S.  ] would indeed be engaging [LOC Mali  ] and its neighbors to help make the summit a success . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] welcomed the expected visit of General [PER Ward  ] of [ORG Africa Command  ] in late November . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC U.S.  ] RECOGNIZES [MISC ALGERIA’S  ] LEADING ROLE -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Visiting Deputy Assistant Secretary of [ORG Defense  ] ( [ORG DASD  ] ) Ambassador [PER Vicki Huddleston  ] met October 19 with [MISC Algerian  ] Minister [PER Delegate  ] for [ORG Defense Abdelmalik Guenaizia  ] and other senior generals , including [ORG Defense Ministry  ] ( [ORG MND  ] ) [ORG SG Major General Ahmed Senhadji  ] , [ORG MND  ] Director of [ORG External Relations and Cooperation General Mekri  ] , [ORG MND  ] Director of the [ORG Directorate of Documentation  ] and [ORG External Security  ] ( [ORG DDSE  ] ) Major General [PER Lallali  ] and Colonel [PER Mohamed Benmousset  ] , Project Manager for [ORG Major General Senhadji  ] . 
She told [PER Guenaizia  ] that the [LOC United States  ] recognized [MISC Algeria’s  ] leadership in [LOC Africa  ] , including [MISC Algeria’s  ] history of support to [MISC Africa’s  ] independence movements , promotion of economic and social development , and on security matters . 
[PER Huddleston  ] acknowledged [MISC Algeria’s  ] own experience in combating terrorism and underscored USG appreciation for [MISC Algeria’s  ] lead on efforts to secure the [LOC Sahel  ] region and prevent terrorism from taking root in neighboring countries . 
She recalled her cooperation with [LOC Algeria  ] when she was ambassador in [LOC Mali  ] to confront the [ORG Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat  ] ( [ORG GSPC  ] ) , forerunner of al-Qa’ida in the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) , after the [ORG GSPC  ] captured [MISC European  ] tourists and brought them to northern [LOC Mali  ] from [LOC Algeria  ] in 2003 . 
[MISC Algeria’s  ] commitment to combat [ORG GSPC  ] in the region was clear , she said , and its engagement with [LOC Mali  ] was impressive . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] played its part through training to increase Mali’s military planning capacity . 
In the end , [PER Huddleston  ] concluded , we were successful . 
[ORG GSPC  ] fled [LOC Mali  ] to [LOC Niger  ] and then to [LOC Chad  ] , where [ORG GSPC  ] leader “al-Para” was captured and returned to [LOC Algeria  ] . 
[PER Huddleston  ] noted the regional military chiefs of staff meeting held in [LOC Tamanrasset  ] in July and the planned regional heads of state summit in [LOC Bamako  ] demonstrated that [LOC Algeria  ] understood once more the importance of a coordinated regional response to combat terrorism in the [LOC Sahel  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recognized [MISC Algeria’s  ] commitment to working with the countries of the region , she stressed , and [MISC Algeria’s  ] leading role in that effort . 
She explained the goal of her visit was to learn how the [LOC U.S.  ] can support [MISC Algeria’s  ] effort. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Guenaizia  ] thanked [PER Huddleston  ] for focusing her discussion on counterterrorism . 
Terrorism , he emphasized , was not a local phenomenon in the region . 
It was brought from outside with all its horrors , he said , and it is a phenomenon the people of the region reject . 
When the threat ALGIERS 00000948 002.2 OF 004 first emerged in [LOC Algeria  ] , the international community misunderstood the scope of the problem and left [LOC Algeria  ] alone to fight in the 1990s . 
[LOC Algeria  ] faced an international embargo in its time of need , he said . 
Despite this embargo and the challenge of protecting an area of 2.3 million square kilometers and a population of 34 million , he said , [LOC Algeria  ] became self-reliant and prevailed with the overwhelming support of the [MISC Algerian  ] people the security services and the army . 
MUST MAINTAIN PRESSURE ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Guenaizia  ] said today the situation had improved considerably , but terrorism remains a serious threat , and [LOC Algeria  ] will maintain the same level of pressure and dedication to its counterterrorism efforts . 
He stressed , however , that terrorism was not only a threat to [LOC Algeria  ] , it threatened the entire region and beyond . 
[ORG AQIM  ] , he argued , wants to embed itself in the region and , therefore , [LOC Algeria  ] intended to take the fight beyond [MISC Algeria’s  ] borders . 
Like a skilled boxer , he said , the key is to keep pressure on your opponent and increase your room for maneuver . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] made it clear that [LOC Algeria  ] will not tolerate a situation in which [ORG AQIM  ] or other armed groups are able to establish camps for logistics and training along [MISC Algeria’s  ] frontier in neighboring countries with the intent of facilitating the entry of trained insurgents , weapons and explosives into [LOC Algeria.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Guenaizia  ] said the situation in northern [LOC Mali  ] presented the greatest obstacle to combating terrorism . 
The nexus of arms , drug and contraband smuggling in northern [LOC Mali  ] created an enabling environment , [PER Guenaizia  ] argued , and provided a source of logistical and financial support . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] added that terrorists will use any means available to finance their activities , including corruption and hostage-taking . 
Thus , he underlined , fighting terrorism requires “implacable” political will to neutralize all avenues of support terrorists can exploit . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] asserted that increased drug trafficking represented a critical problem in this regard . 
Thousands of tons of drugs now cross through the region , he said . 
Based on clashes with [MISC Algerian  ] security forces , [PER Guenaizia  ] assessed that those involved in drug trafficking were well organized and had military training . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] said that [LOC Morocco  ] was a major smuggling route for cannabis and hashish and was not doing enough to interdict traffickers . 
[PER Huddleston  ] told [PER Guenaizia  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] was equally concerned with drug trafficking in northwest [LOC Africa  ] , particularly [MISC Colombian  ] drugs transiting west [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Sahel  ] en route to [LOC Europe  ] . 
The drug trade added another source of finance for terrorists , and its destabilizing effect on local populations could expand the geographic scope of terrorist recruitment efforts , she said , citing the example of the [PER Boko Haram  ] in [LOC Nigeria.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Guenaizia  ] cautioned that the terrorist network in the [LOC Sahel  ] is a sophisticated organization. “These are not simple warlords we are facing , ” he emphasized . 
They use the best explosives , have honed their bomb-making expertise and use sophisticated means to deploy explosives against their targets , [PER Guenaizia  ] underscored . 
He added that information to build highly sophisticated IEDs is easily obtainable from the [MISC Internet  ] . 
No country is safe , he went on ; “We need to remain vigilant.” [LOC TAMANRASSET  ] REGIONAL COMMAND ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Guenaizia  ] noted that regional chiefs of staff met in the southern [MISC Algerian  ] city of [LOC Tamanrasset  ] in July to create a mechanism to allow militaries in the region to coordinate efforts against terrorist threats while at the same time respecting each country’s sovereignty . 
Military leaders of [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Mali  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] and [LOC Niger  ] , he said , agreed to establish a regional command in [LOC Tamanrasset  ] that will host military representatives from each country and coordinate joint operations against [ORG AQIM  ] targets . 
Joint military efforts , [PER Guenaizia  ] elaborated , are necessary to prevent [ORG AQIM  ] from implanting itself in the region . 
He called this the fundamental challenge . 
Regional military leaders are ALGIERS 00000948 003.2 OF 004 now sensitized to the problem , he asserted , and are willing to wage a common [LOC CT  ] campaign . 
He indicated that the command could eventually be expanded to include [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Burkina Faso  ] and [LOC Chad  ] . 
For its part , [LOC Algeria  ] will provide resources to optimize the command center’s capacity. “What we can’t obtain among ourselves , ” he added , “we will seek from our friends.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Guenaizia  ] cautioned that , although the regional command in [LOC Tamanrasset  ] was an important first step , he didn’t expect immediate results . 
The meeting in [LOC Tamanrasset  ] , he noted , concerned military coordination , but successful action hinged on two operational aspects: military readiness and political will . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] said regional military leaders had done their job , now it was up to the civilian leaders of the region to demonstrate the political will to act. “We are waiting for the [LOC Bamako  ] summit , ” [PER Guenaizia  ] stressed . 
HOW THE [LOC U.S.  ] CAN HELP --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As to how the [LOC U.S.  ] and others could support the regional effort , [PER Guenaizia  ] emphasized ( repeating himself three times to make the point ) that sharing intelligence was fundamental . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] reminded [PER Huddleston  ] that [LOC Algeria  ] once agreed to [LOC U.S.  ] surveillance overflights years ago , but the experience yielded few positive results for [LOC Algeria  ] even though the intelligence collected related directly to [MISC Algeria’s  ] national security and used [MISC Algeria’s  ] sovereign airspace . 
[PER Huddleston  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] were already sharing a lot of intelligence . 
There would be a willingness to conduct overflights , but she underlined that any overflight mission would have to be linked to direct action on the ground . 
The cost of one mission , she emphasized , was around USD 50,000 , so we had to be sure of the result . 
[PER Huddleston  ] suggested [PER Guenaizia  ] could raise this matter during [ORG AFRICOM Commander General Ward’s  ] expected visit in November. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The provision of technical means was also key . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] complained that in many ways [LOC Algeria  ] still faced an embargo in regards to the provision of technical equipment , including counter-IED measures and sensors for intelligence gathering . 
He informed [PER Huddleston  ] that a [ORG Northrop Grumman  ] delegation will arrive in [LOC Algeria  ] this week to discuss the capabilities of an [MISC AWACS-type  ] platform based on a [ORG Boeing  ] 737 airframe . 
[LOC Algeria  ] also needed sophisticated IED jammers , he said . 
Insurgents use cell phones to detonate IEDs remotely , he stressed , resulting in huge casualties for [MISC Algerian  ] forces . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] lamented that despite this critical need , [MISC Algeria’s  ] partners had been slow in responding to [MISC Algeria’s  ] request to purchase jammers . 
He did not refer directly to [LOC U.S.  ] end-use-monitoring rules , but he shared an anecdote about [MISC Algeria’s  ] difficulties purchasing jamming technology from [LOC Portugal  ] , a request , he continued , that has been pending for more than a year with no response. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) He said the [LOC U.S.  ] and others could perhaps assist most before the [LOC Bamako  ] heads of state summit by helping secure the requisite top-level political will among [LOC Sahel  ] governments needed to make the summit a success and facilitate effective military action . 
[ORG DDSE Major General Lallali  ] said the key to securing commitment for effective cooperation rested with top-level leaders in [LOC Bamako  ] . 
[PER Lallali  ] said Mali’s political leadership was the biggest problem. “We need a signal from [LOC Bamako  ] that shows their commitment , ” [PER Lallali  ] stated . 
[MISC Malians  ] are suffering from terrorism , he said , yet when local populations try to fight back , the authorities crack down on those populations. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lallali  ] complained that [MISC Malian  ] officials have alerted insurgents that their cell phone calls were being monitored and leaked sensitive intelligence . 
[PER Lallali  ] also accused [LOC Mali  ] of facilitating ransom payments for hostages . 
He called [LOC Mali  ] a favorable business environment for terrorists and believed many wealthy and powerful families in [LOC Mali  ] benefited from illegal trafficking . 
He termed the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the “Terrorist [ORG Bank”  ] and said , “we need to suppress that bank , ” noting the connection between drug trafficking and support for terrorist finance and logistics . 
[PER Lallali  ] commented that [MISC Algeria’s  ] effort in the [ORG UN  ] to criminalize ALGIERS 00000948 004.2 OF 004 ransom payments aimed to curb corruption’s role in facilitating terrorism . 
He implored [ORG DASD Huddleston  ] to “please do something with them.” <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Guenaizia  ] agreed that trust was an issue with [LOC Mali  ] . 
Although [LOC Algeria  ] has provided materiel and training support to [LOC Mali  ] to help resolve the [MISC Tuareg  ] issue , it was not inclined to give [LOC Mali  ] weapons and communications gear because of concerns that such equipment might be trafficked to [LOC Ivory Coast  ] or [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] said there was a “double language” in Mali-- its political leadership did not share the commitment Mali’s military leaders demonstrated . 
In order to succeed in the fight , [PER Guenaizia  ] affirmed , [LOC Mali  ] had to cooperate fully . 
The [LOC Bamako  ] summit has to deliver a clear political commitment . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] could help by talking to [LOC Mali  ] and others with influence in [LOC Mali  ] to ensure the necessary level of political will was there . 
[PER Huddleston  ] agreed that complicity in [LOC Mali  ] regarding the desire to share in the spoils of illegal trafficking seemed to have become worse since her tenure as ambassador . 
She concurred that Mali’s cooperation was essential but said that engaging [LOC Mali  ] was a task for the entire region , not only [LOC Algeria  ] . 
[PER Huddleston  ] cited the potential role of other partners in the region with influence in [LOC Mali  ] , like [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Burkina Faso  ] . 
She also suggested involving the AU to press for a general statement on fighting terrorism in the [LOC Sahel  ] that would not single out [LOC Mali  ] but rather deliver a broad message that countries in the region should act in concert and not allow terrorists to operate with impunity . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , she said , will engage [LOC Mali  ] and others in the region to play a constructive role in the region’s fight against terrorism . 
BETTER COMMUNICATION -------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Huddleston  ] told [PER Guenaizia  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] military assistance in the region aimed to improve the capacity of militaries in [LOC Mali  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] and [LOC Chad  ] through training and equipment . 
President Tandja’s bid for a third term in office , she regretted , probably meant the [LOC U.S.  ] will not be able to assist [LOC Niger  ] , but we will extend our assistance to [LOC Burkina Faso  ] soon . 
It was important , she stressed , that [LOC U.S.  ] efforts were in step with regional efforts already underway . 
In this regard , [PER Huddleston  ] emphasized that communication among regional governments and other partners , like the [LOC U.S.  ] , was essential . 
[PER Huddleston  ] referred to recent talks between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] allies on security in the [LOC Sahel  ] , during which the [ORG European Commission  ] and [LOC France  ] mentioned plans for assistance . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] noted [MISC Europe’s  ] interest in getting involved and said that some [MISC European  ] governments had tried to insert themselves into the [LOC Tamanrasset  ] meeting . 
He bluntly stated that [LOC Africa  ] had already endured a period of colonialism . 
[PER Lallali  ] interjected that [MISC European  ] participation could complicate matters. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Huddleston  ] clarified that outside partners did not have to be involved directly but needed to be apprised of future steps and planning in order to provide support . 
[PER Huddleston  ] suggested regular meetings by the [ORG MOD  ] with the Ambassador and DATT in [LOC Algiers  ] . 
[PER Guenaizia  ] said he had no objection , both with the [LOC U.S.  ] and others . 
The threat concerns all . 
But cooperation had to advance gradually . 
We should review progress in stages , he added . 
Immediate efforts , he reiterated , should focus on pressuring [LOC Mali  ] and achieving a successful summit in [LOC Bamako  ] . 
The next step was to allow time for standing up the regional command in [LOC Tamanrasset  ] and determining equipment needs . 
He suggested in two to three months we might be able meet and take stock of that effort . 
In this regard , [PER Guenaizia  ] welcomed the expected visit of General [PER Ward  ] of [ORG Africa Command  ] in [ORG November.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [ORG DASD Huddleston  ] did not clear this cable. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) [LOC Tripoli  ] minimize considered .
