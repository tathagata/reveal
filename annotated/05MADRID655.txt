Summary . 
[ORG Embassy Madrid  ] supports the establishment of a new [ORG CSI  ] program in [LOC Spain  ] . 
This program would enhance [ORG Mission  ] 's [ORG MPP  ] goal of prevention and response to terrorism . 
In order to effectively meet the duties required of [ORG CSI Spain  ] , [ORG Embassy  ] requires personnel and operational control changes to the proposed [ORG DHS NSDD  ] 38 . 
[ORG Embassy  ] has determined that eight permanent [MISC Americans  ] are warranted at ports in [LOC Spain  ] , but the proposed criminal investigator and intelligence positions in [LOC Madrid  ] are only authorized a three month TDY status to evaluate their contribution to the initiative . 
[ORG Embassy  ] has also determined an additional locally engaged support staff will be required for [ORG DHS Madrid  ] to meet the needs of this program . 
Operational control for [ORG CSI  ] in [LOC Spain  ] must be based with the Chief of [ORG Mission  ] and staff in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
The program cannot move forward until the government of [LOC Spain  ] signs a Memorandum of Understanding that allows [ORG DHS  ] personnel status as [ORG Administrative  ] and [ORG Technical Staff  ] . 
End Summary . 
Personnel --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[ORG Embassy  ] has reviewed Reftel ( A ) [ORG NSDD  ] 38 request and approves establishment of eight new , full-time , permanent ( [ORG FTP  ] ) , [MISC American  ] direct-hire ( [ORG USDH  ] ) , [ORG DHS/CBP Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) positions at these locations in [LOC Spain: Algeciras  ] ( 2 ) , [LOC Barcelona  ] ( 3 ) , and [LOC Valencia  ] ( 3 ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
However , for [LOC Madrid  ] , embassy approves two ( 2 ) positions requested in reftel ( A ) on a three-month TDY basis , and reiterates a request for one ( 1 ) [ORG Mission Support Specialist  ] position ( Locally Engaged Staff ) , on a permanent basis . 
Total positions approved equal eleven ( 11 ) , eight ( 8 ) of which are permanent , direct hires ; one ( 1 ) of which is permanent , locally engaged ; and two ( 2 ) of which are [MISC TDY.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Post 's decision on the [LOC Madrid  ] positions is based on the interest of remaining lean and reducing layers of personnel who might duplicate work . 
[ORG Mission  ] is therefore limiting the criminal investigator and intelligence positions to a TDY trial period . 
At present , post remains unconvinced of the need for additional criminal investigators or analysts due to the ample presence of [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement personnel currently in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
The evaluation period will allow [ORG DHS  ] to justify the positions without increasing the overlapping jurisdictions of agencies already at post . 
Operational Control ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[ORG Mission  ] seeks to clarify [ORG DHS/CBP  ] 's justification for placing operational control under [ORG CBP Headquarters  ] . 
[ORG Mission  ] believes that operational control should reside with the Chief of [ORG Mission  ] through the [ORG DHS  ] chief in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
Overall program direction can remain with Office of [LOC International Affairs  ] , [ORG CBP  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG Administrative Support  ] ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[ORG Administrative  ] support for the proposed [ORG DHS/CBP Container Security Initiative  ] is dependent first and foremost on the successful negotiation of a bilateral agreement or Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) with the Government of [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG GOS  ] ) that resolves two primary issues: the official status , privileges and immunities of deployed personnel and family members , and the provision of adequate and secure office space within the designated port areas . 
Official Status -- Privileges and Immunities -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
It is [ORG Mission Spain  ] 's intention to negotiate an [ORG MOU  ] in which the [ORG GOS  ] affords the proposed [ORG DHS/CBP  ] CSI personnel and their family members a status equivalent to that given to the [ORG Administrative  ] and [ORG Technical  ] staff members of the [ORG Embassy  ] and their family members in accordance with the [ORG Vienna Convention  ] on [ORG Diplomatic Relations  ] of April 18 , 1961 , or consular employees in accordance with the [ORG Vienna Convention  ] on [ORG Consular Relations  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] is a signatory to the [LOC Vienna  ] convention , and has signed a similar bi-lateral agreement regarding [ORG Mission Spain  ] 's [ORG NASA  ] representative . 
In addition , the [ORG USG  ] has afforded [ORG Administrative  ] and [ORG Technical  ] status to the Educational Counselors of the [ORG GOS  ] currently deployed in 23 different states in the [LOC U.S.  ] Thus , there is both precedence and reciprocity to support our request for [ORG DHS/CBP  ] CSI . 
This agreement must be signed before DHS/CSI personnel can apply for visas to deploy to [LOC Spain  ] to fill any permanent positions approved by this NSDD-38 process . 
Prior to this agreement , [ORG DHS/CBP  ] CSI personnel deployed to [LOC Spain  ] will be subject to individual country clearance approval and restricted to three-month temporary duty ( TDY ) assignments as governed by the maximum length of official visas for temporary visits . 
Provision of Office Space ------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
As the [LOC Algeciras  ] pilot project has shown , [ORG DHS/CBP  ] CSI personnel must have office space within the port in order to perform their duties effectively . 
Commercial office space outside the port areas will be significantly less effective , and will be very difficult and expensive to lease and make-ready to meet security standards . 
Therefore , it is vitally important that the [ORG MOU  ] with the [ORG GOS  ] include provision of office space within the port areas . 
If successful , this will limit start-up costs to procurement/shipping of office furnishings and equipment , and installation of commercial voice and data links. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
Office space in [LOC Madrid  ] can be made available for the permanent support position within the [ORG CAA  ] adjacent to other [ORG DHS  ] and law enforcement agency personnel . 
For the two TDY positions in [LOC Madrid  ] , office space can be made available on a temporary basis . 
Should the positions become permanent , an estimate of dislocation and make-ready costs will be prepared . 
Provision of Housing -------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
Post recommends that proposed [ORG DHS/CBP  ] CSI positions be authorized [MISC Living Quarters Allowance  ] ( [ORG LQA  ] ) for residential accommodations in [LOC Algeciras  ] , [LOC Valencia  ] and [LOC Barcelona  ] , plus full shipment of household effects and personally owned vehicles. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
Should the two TDY positions in [LOC Madrid  ] become permanent , they could join the embassy 's short-term leased housing pool , appliance pool , and residential maintenance services . 
[ORG ICASS Services and Costs  ] ------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
The eight proposed permanent [ORG DHS/CBP  ] CSI positions in [LOC Algeciras  ] , [LOC Valencia  ] and [LOC Barcelona  ] would be eligible to receive the following [ORG ICASS  ] services from [ORG Mission Spain: Basic Package  ] , [ORG Security Services  ] , [ORG Health Services  ] , [ORG CLO Services  ] , [ORG Procurement  ] , [ORG Customs/Shipping  ] , [ORG Vouchering  ] , [ORG Accounts  ] and [ORG Records  ] , [ORG Pouch  ] and [ORG Mail  ] , and [ORG Leasing Services  ] . 
Many of these services would be modified to less than full services due to the geographical distance between these cities and the service providers in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
We believe sufficient administrative support can be provided as long as [ORG DHS/CBP  ] CSI personnel have daily access to the embassy through commercial [MISC Internet  ] and telephone . 
The current- year ( [MISC FY-05  ] ) [ORG ICASS  ] charge for the CSI pilot project TDY personnel is $38,300 . 
This NSDD-38 request would affect service subscriptions and workload counts for next fiscal year ( [MISC FY-06  ] ) . 
Cost estimates are highly dependent on currently unknown variables such as the number of family members . 
However , an estimated cost for minimal [MISC FY-06  ] [ORG ICASS  ] services is about $100,000 . 
Pending [ORG ICASS Council  ] approval , [ORG Mission Spain Management Section  ] would utilize these resources to establish one new locally engaged staff position . 
Security -------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
[ORG Mission  ] believes that additional staff can be justified and do not offer unnecessary security risk providing [ORG DHS  ] personnel posted at satellite locations carefully observe security issues relevant to outside of [ORG Embassy  ] locations . 
In addition to the mandatory pre-assignment security briefing , [ORG Mission  ] RSO recommends careful attention to office , residential and personal security measures . 
[ORG DHS  ] personnel located at satellite posts will need to take greater responsibility for their own security awareness . 
Residences and offices will require security evaluation by [ORG Mission  ] security personnel . 
[ORG DHS  ] must be cognizant that locating [MISC Americans  ] in port areas creates an additional target. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
Mandatory Personal Security Training . 
All personnel transferring to an overseas location under COM authority must complete appropriate overseas personal security training prior to their travel . 
Please refer to reftel ( B ) for details . 
Additionally , the CSI personnel should schedule a security briefing with [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] RSO as soon as possible after arrival . 
[ORG Embassy  ] ID card will be issued and personnel will receive briefing on current threat levels in [LOC Spain  ] as well as appropriate residential and personal security measures. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
The NSDD-38 Decision . 
1 ) Is the need for the proposed staffing change reflected in the most recent MPP ? 
If so , under which goal ? 
If not , what circumstances have changed to justify the [ORG NSDD  ] 38 proposal ? 
Yes . 
Goal One - Prevention and Response to Terrorism . 
The CSI program fits within Strategy 2: Strengthen bilateral law enforcement , judicial , military , financial and intelligence cooperation and information sharing related to the War on Terror ( including [ORG ETA  ] ) . 
2 ) If the agency proposes to add staffing based on workload , are there other resources already present at post that are performing or could perform the function ? 
No. This is a new initiative . 
The new staff will be integrated into the mission hierarchy by reporting to [MISC DHS'  ] ICE Attache in [LOC Madrid  ] and to the Chief of Mission . 
3 ) Could the function be accomplished through the use of TDY , Foreign National , contract , or other local hire personnel ? 
During the pilot phase , the program requires management and development by an [MISC American  ] staff . 
These positions will be privy to secret and possibly top secret information . 
It is possible that the program will continue to require involvement of cleared [MISC Americans  ] to deal with classified information . 
However , we will review the program once it is established , to determine if some of the staffing could be taken over by locally hired or contract employees . 
4 ) Identify the specific administration support , space , and funding arrangements that have been made for the increase in staffing . 
Provision of space - see paragraph 5 [ORG ICASS  ] services and costs - see paragraph 9 5 ) Do the benefits of increasing the staff outweigh the inherent security risks associated with additional personnel ? 
Yes . 
The mission of DHS/ICE includes oversight of the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] , a program designed to preclude the introduction of weapons of mass destruction in the [LOC U.S.  ] via commerce and achieve a key y MPP Goal . 
CSI personnel can also limit additional security risk by being cognizant of their security needs and cooperation with [LOC Madrid  ] 's [ORG Regional Security Office.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
Approval is subject to [ORG DHS/CBP  ] acceptance of above conditions and [ORG ICASS  ] charges .
