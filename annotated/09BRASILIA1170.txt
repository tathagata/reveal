STATE 91633 D. [LOC BRASILIA  ] 1038 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001170 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: Charge [PER D'Affaires Lisa Kubiske  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] MRE Undersecretary for Political Affairs [PER Roberto Jaguaribe  ] , recently returned from a diplomatic mission to [LOC Tehran  ] , told Charge [PER D'Affaires  ] on September 16 that additional dialogue rather than sanctions will be most the most effective means of pressuring [LOC Iran  ] to develop a responsible nuclear program . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] emphasized that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program enjoys broad internal support and will not ultimately be stopped , so the goal should be to push [LOC Iran  ] to follow international nuclear guidelines . 
He said that top [MISC Iranian  ] officials draw a distinction between [ORG IAEA  ] directives , which they are attempting to follow , and [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions , which they view as unfair and in some cases illegitimate . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] said he told the [MISC Iranians  ] they are still not meeting their [ORG IAEA  ] responsibilities , but he believes they are making progress . 
The Undersecretary did not discount the possibility of [LOC Brazil  ] making a statement on [LOC Iran  ] at [LOC UNGA  ] but said any such remarks would be " balanced , " referencing [LOC Iran  ] 's lack of full compliance along with [LOC Brazil  ] 's basic skepticism toward sanctions as a motivating tool . 
End summary . 
Back from [LOC Tehran  ] ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Upon returning from his September 9-10 visit to [LOC Tehran  ] , Undersecretary [PER Jaguaribe  ] took great care in his meeting with [ORG CDA  ] to give not only the [MISC Brazilian  ] but also the [MISC Iranian  ] perspective to the points made in reftels A , B , and [PER C. While  ] in [LOC Iran  ] , he met with Foreign Minister [PER Manouchir Mottaki  ] , [ORG National Security Council  ] official [PER Said Jalili  ] , and Parliamentiary Foreign Policy Chair [PER Aladdin Bourojerdi  ] , among others . 
He issued joint press statements in [LOC Iran  ] with each of these men to the effect that dialogue , not sanctions , was the key to solving the dispute at hand . 
In his meeting with [ORG CDA  ] , [PER Jaguaribe  ] 's core message was not substantively different , but he went into greater detail on areas in which he had pressed [LOC Iran  ] , areas where he saw [LOC Iran  ] as non-compliant , and thoughts on how to influence them toward compliance . 
The Undersecretary 's basic view of post-election [LOC Iran  ] had not changed . 
He characterized the nation a compromised democracy , but with a robust civil society that will make them ultimately open to substantive negotiation . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's Message to [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jaguaribe  ] was careful to point out that , despite the friendly press conferences and the desire to schedule an [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] in December , he raised specific criticisms with [MISC Iranian  ] officials about their nuclear program . 
Most notably , he said that he told [PER Mottaki  ] and others that [LOC Iran  ] was still not carrying out all its [ORG IAEA  ] responsibilities , despite the late August decision to allow inspectors at [LOC Natanz  ] and [LOC Arak  ] . 
He also viewed the September 9 proposal to the [ORG P5  ] 1 by the [MISC Iranian  ] government , which was forwarded to him by the [MISC Iranians  ] , as far too general to be an effective point of departure for further discussion . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] said he had asked the [MISC Iranians  ] to be more specific in their dialogue , and he told us that he thought the [MISC Iranians  ] could be brought around to the point where they would make more specific proposals . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Views on [ORG IAEA Report  ] and [ORG Amcit Demarches  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During the meeting , [PER Jaguaribe  ] agreed with the [LOC U.S.  ] interpretation of the main points of the [ORG IAEA  ] report ( ref C ) , i.e. , that [LOC Iran  ] has refused to suspend proliferation-senstive nuclear activities as required by the [ORG UNSC  ] , has refused to implement the additional protocol , and has only partially cooperated with [ORG IAEA  ] inspection demands . 
At times he reflected [MISC Iranian  ] views without endorsing them , such as his reference to [ORG IAEA  ] questions about past weaponization-related activities as " alleged reports . 
" [PER Jaguaribe  ] had no immediate response to our demarche concerning Amcits detained in [LOC Iran  ] ( ref B ) but sounded favorably disposed . 
During his meetings in [LOC Tehran  ] , [LOC Iran  ] gave [PER Jaguaribe  ] their own list of complaints/demands toward the [LOC U.S.  ] These included complaints about " three [LOC U.S.  ] Army personnel detained last month in [LOC Kurdistan  ] , " extradition of several [MISC Iranians  ] , and disappearance of [MISC Iranians  ] in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001170 002.2 OF 003 [MISC Brazilian  ] Engagement Strategy ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While trying to outline an overall engagement strategy toward [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Jaguaribe  ] emphasized repeatedly that [LOC Iran  ] will never give up its nuclear enrichment program , though it may be pressured into suspending it for periods of time . 
He argued that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program is broadly popular across all segments of society , including most government opponents and members of the exile community . 
Therefore , he continued , sanctions should not be used because the pain caused by them would push [MISC Iranians  ] " with alternative views " toward supporting the current regime on a rare issue in which they are in general agreement . 
( He believed that oil import sanctions would be especially damaging to [LOC Iran  ] 's economy -- and especially effective in rallying popular [MISC Iranian  ] support for its nuclear program . 
) [PER Jaguaribe  ] believed that the [MISC Iranian  ] government was ultimately persuadable to follow international protocols , if pressured by both the international community and its civil society . 
He praised earlier [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to initiate dialogue on the issue , and said that continued dialogue , even if not immediately successful , strengthens the hand of the more liberal elements of [MISC Iranian  ] society . 
[MISC Iranian  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] Views on [ORG IAEA  ] , [ORG UNSC  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Iranians  ] pressed upon [PER Jaguaribe  ] their view that [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards ( and related directives ) constitute broadly agreed upon international technical norms that the [MISC Iranians  ] can follow , and will work to adhere to in the future . 
The [LOC Arak  ] and [LOC Natanz  ] inspections were cited as cases in point . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] left convinced that the [MISC Iranians  ] fully believe they are following [ORG IAEA  ] guidelines -- a point of view that the Undersecretary characterized to [ORG CDA  ] as " delusional . 
" [LOC Tehran  ] drew a distinction between the [ORG IAEA  ] and the [ORG UNSC  ] , which they view as a body issuing political decisions that are " not legitimate . 
" [PER Jaguaribe  ] did not endorse this view but said of the [MISC Iran-UNSC  ] relationship , " there needs to be some movement on both sides . 
" ( [ORG Note: Brazil  ] has long held the position that nuclear matters are best dealt with in the [ORG IAEA  ] , and not in the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
End note . 
) He added that a [ORG UN  ] proposal related to nuclear disarmament would be helpful to resolve the impasse . 
He praised recent [LOC U.S.  ] efforts in this regard and hoped more would be forthcoming . 
Expanding the [MISC Chorus: Statement  ] at [ORG UNGA  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Regarding the request outlined in ref A , [PER Jaguaribe  ] said there was a possibility that [LOC Brazil  ] would consider addressing [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program in its [ORG UNGA  ] statement . 
He said that any such mention would be a balanced reference , mentioning both [LOC Iran  ] 's need to meet [ORG IAEA  ] and [ORG UNSC  ] responsibilties while expressing skepticism toward [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions as a motivating tool . 
He also said that [LOC Brazil  ] would not shy away from saying that [LOC Iran  ] 's September 9 response to the [ORG P5  ] 1 needs to be more robust to be effective . 
( Comment: We believe it is very doubtful that [LOC Brazil  ] will actually reference [LOC Iran  ] in its [ORG UNGA  ] statement . 
End comment . 
) Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Having returned from [LOC Tehran  ] less than a week earlier , [PER Jaguaribe  ] focused on the approach he believed would work best in resolving the disconnect between [LOC Iran  ] 's confidence that it has given satisfactory answers about its nuclear program and the sense in the international community that the [MISC Iranians  ] must be moved toward compliance . 
In general , [LOC Brazil  ] can be expected to continue a cautious approach to the issue , keeping in mind its sometimes-competing desires to increase commercial relations with [LOC Iran  ] , to develop [MISC Brazilian  ] nuclear military technology for non-weaponmaking purposes without drawing international attention , and to gain a permanent [ORG UNSC  ] seat -- with the last goal being most important . 
In the short run , the easiest way for the GOB to massage the various interests is to call for increased multilateral dialogue and adherence to [ORG IAEA  ] standards in order to forestall having to take a firm position in the [ORG UN  ] on sanctions once [LOC Brazil  ] assumes its temporary seat on the [ORG UNSC  ] in January 2010 . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is aware , however , that [MISC Iranian  ] compliance with [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards would not necessarily equal [LOC Iran  ] becoming a responsible nuclear power -- as [PER Jaguaribe  ] mused during the meeting . 
In light of its traditional hesitance to take firm positions on contentious country-specific issues , and with visits by [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] and top [MISC Brazilian  ] officials [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001170 003.2 OF 003 to [LOC Iran  ] being planned for the next few months , [LOC Brazil  ] will have a soft voice in the chorus -- but may prove useful nonetheless if senior GOB officials can be encouraged to whisper into [LOC Iran  ] 's ear the idea that negotiation and compliance are its best option .
