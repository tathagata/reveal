[PER AbZ  ] said that he is delighted with the progress on the agreement . 
He added that the UAE’s goal is to create a gold standard for a nuclear power program .

[PER AbZ  ] said the [LOC UAE  ] bid to host the [ORG International Renewable Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IRENA  ] ) headquarters would be very difficult to achieve if the [LOC UAE  ] is locked out of the [ORG MEF  ] preparatory meeting in [LOC Washington  ] and promised “we will remember your help.” ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .

She noted the value of the [ORG GCC  ] plus 3 mechanism not only for furthering [MISC Arab  ] engagement with the [MISC Iraqi  ] government during a time of transition , but as a way to send a message to [LOC Iran  ] that [LOC Iraq  ] has broad support in the [MISC Arab  ] world. -------------------- Afghanistan/Pakistan -------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The Secretary told [PER AbZ  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] needs help to stem the flow of funds from the [LOC Gulf  ] to the [ORG Taliban  ] .

[PER Feltman  ] noted a pattern of [MISC Saudi  ] behavior of withholding financial assistance - not supporting March 14 in [LOC Lebanon  ] , not sending funds to the [ORG PA  ] , and not planning a pledge for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Otaiba  ] added that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] also failed make a commitment at the [MISC G20  ] meeting. ------- [LOC Lebanon  ] ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The Secretary noted the need to support [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG LAF  ] ) in the run up to the elections with concrete displays of support .

( [ORG S  ] ) [PER AbZ  ] said that in addition to financial support for the [ORG PA  ] it is important that the new [MISC Israeli  ] government reach out to President [PER Abbas  ] . 
[PER AbZ  ] said that the Secretary should expect the [MISC Qatari  ] Prime Minister to request an [ORG Arab League  ] meeting with the Quartet focused on settlements and [LOC East Jerusalem  ] . 
[PER AbZ  ] said the Quartet will need to use the same standards for the new [LOC Israel  ] government as already applied to the [MISC Palestinians  ] regarding respecting previous agreements . 
The Secretary agreed . 
[PER AbZ  ] said that it is important to create a road map of [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] actions towards an end game . 
The Secretary agreed on the importance of simultaneous reinforcing actions in support of negotiations . 
[PER AbZ  ] said that the [LOC UAE  ] candidacy to host [ORG IRENA  ] could yield political benefits , if successful . 
[LOC Israel  ] is already a signatory to the agreement , so it would have a representative [ORG IRENA  ] mission in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] should the [LOC UAE  ] be chosen to host headquarters .
