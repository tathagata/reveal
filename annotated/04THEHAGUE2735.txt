( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] government has officially characterized the October 6 [ORG European Commission  ] report on [LOC Turkey  ] , including its recommendation that a date be set for accession negotiations , as " " a good basis for decision making by the [ORG European Council  ] in December . 
" " Parliament also received the report favorably , with all major parties in favor of starting negotiations -- albeit disagreeing on when . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] public , however , remains skeptical about [LOC Turkey  ] 's [MISC European  ] credentials , although calls for a referendum on [MISC Turkish  ] accession have so far gained no momentum . 
The government will continue to tread cautiously on [LOC Turkey  ] , seeking to balance its [ORG EU  ] Presidency obligations against the mixed feelings of [MISC Dutch  ] citizens while trying to avoid divisions within the ruling coalition . 
End summary . 
Government 's public reaction ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Immediately following the October 6 publication of the [ORG EC  ] report on [LOC Turkey  ] , acting [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Gerrit Zalm  ] described the report as " " thorough and balanced " " and " " a good basis " " for decision making in December . 
" " [PER Zalm  ] , who had formerly been highly critical of [MISC Turkish  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] , stopped short of endorsing beginning negotiations , but stressed that [MISC Dutch  ] citizens should be " " reassured " " by [ORG Commission  ] proposals for an extended transition period for [MISC Turkish  ] migrants after accession and the condition that accession not drain the [ORG EU  ] budget . 
He also stressed that " " positive developments " " in the areas of human rights , freedom of speech , and religious freedom " " must continue . 
" " Perhaps anticipating domestic criticism of the government 's response to the report , [PER Zalm  ] emphasized that the [MISC Netherlands'  ] " " mouth is gagged " " while it holds the [ORG EU  ] Presidency as other member states monitor [MISC Dutch  ] comments closely. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A few days later on October 15 , the [ORG GONL  ] sent a letter to parliament reiterating [PER Zalm  ] 's earlier comments . 
Again finding the Report to be " " a good basis for decision making in December , " " the letter stated that " " The decision on whether or not to open negotiations will have to take into account the suggestions and issues raised by the [ORG Commission  ] " " -- again stopping short of an outright endorsement of beginning negotiations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Explaining the government 's letter to the press , acting Prime Minister [PER Zalm  ] hinted that the [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet was itself divided on how soon negotiations with [LOC Turkey  ] should begin . 
He was confident , however , that the cabinet would have a clear position on the matter by the time of the December [ORG European Council  ] . 
[PER Zalm  ] described Foreign Minister Bot 's public speculation that negotiations could probably start in the second half of 2005 ( and could not be put off until 2008 , as some suggested ) as premature . 
Parliament 's reaction --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Commission  ] report was well received in the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament . 
All the main political parties supported starting negotiations with [LOC Turkey  ] on the conditions proposed by the [ORG Commission  ] . 
They remain divided , however , as to when these negotiations should begin . 
Spokesmen for the coalition [PER Christian Democratic  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) and [MISC Liberal  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) parties urged caution ; [ORG CDA  ] floorleader [PER Verhagen  ] , for example , argued against setting a date until [LOC Turkey  ] is in full compliance with the [LOC Copenhagen  ] criteria on respect for human rights and the rule of law . 
[PER Verhagen  ] and the spokesmen for the other major parties , however , also made clear that they would not bind the government 's hands , and that they would support an [ORG EU  ] consensus decision . 
Public opinion skeptical but can be won over -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Large elements of public , and some smaller parties in parliament , remain skeptical about the benefits of [MISC Turkish  ] accession . 
[PER Geert Wilders  ] , the former [ORG VVD  ] ( [MISC Liberal  ] ) party member who recently split with the party leadership on this issue , continues to attract followers from those worried about inflows of [MISC Turkish  ] workers . 
Several recent polls indicate that if a referendum on [MISC Turkish  ] accession ( as proposed in [LOC France  ] ) were held today , a majority would oppose . 
On the other hand , although some politicians , including [ORG VVD  ] leader [PER van Aartsen  ] , have called for a such a referendum , so far there has been no obvious momentum for it. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While skeptical , the [MISC Dutch  ] public does not come out strongly opposed to starting negotiations on [MISC Turkish  ] accession . 
According to an October 5 poll , 53 percent support starting negotiations , and 61 percent support future accession if [LOC Turkey  ] has complied with a clear set of criteria . 
Supporters list among [LOC Turkey  ] 's advantages that it would be a bridge to the [MISC Arab  ] world , that membership would enhance [MISC European  ] security , and that [LOC Turkey  ] would benefit to the [ORG Union  ] 's economy . 
COMMENT: ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although skeptical , the pragmatic [MISC Dutch  ] seem prepared , in the main , to go along with an [ORG EU  ] consensus decision to begin negotiations on [MISC Turkish  ] accession on a date to be determined by the [ORG European Council  ] in December . 
That said , underlying doubts about [MISC Turkish  ] accession -- and suspicions about the [ORG EU  ] in general -- still have the potential to create domestic political challenges for the coalition , especially if [PER Wilders  ] or others are able to mobilize this dissatisfaction into an effective political force . 
For now , the government is treading cautiously rather than aggressively preparing the population for a positive decision in December .
