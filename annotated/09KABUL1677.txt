<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC KABUL  ] 001677 NOFORN SIPDIS STATE FOR S/RAP HOLBROOKE , SCA/FO , SCA/A STATE PASS USAID EO 12958 DECL: 06/16/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , AF SUBJECT: HELMAND GOVERNOR [PER MANGAL  ] UPBEAT , HOPEFUL IN MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR Classified By: Ambassador [PER Karl W. Eikenberry  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( c ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Helmand Governor [PER Gulabuddin Mangal  ] was upbeat , yet realistic during a June 16 call on Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] at the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] . 
The Ambassador gave [PER Mangal  ] a set of photos taken during last month’s grand opening of the [ORG Bost Commercial Airfield  ] in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Mangal  ] thanked the Ambassador and promised to share the photos with [LOC Helmand  ] leaders . 
[PER Mangal  ] said many [MISC Helmandi  ] leaders had sent messages of support for the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] speech , and that local media had rebroadcast the speech several times . 
The Ambassador was encouraged by this news , telling [PER Mangal  ] that he wrote the speech himself based on both his knowledge of the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and his desire to bolster the confidence of [MISC Helmand’s  ] residents in the [LOC United States  ] and the international community. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mangal  ] offered a brief overview of the security situation in [LOC Helmand  ] since he was appointed in early 2008 , describing security throughout the province as bad , and pointing specifically to the complete lack of security in provincial capital [LOC Lashkar Gah  ] . 
He said fear among [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) , both the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) and [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) , led them to fire shots randomly in the streets . 
He added there was a complete lack of coordination with coalition forces . 
[PER Mangal  ] said narcotics traffickers operating with impunity lived within 100 meters of the police station in the capital . 
Mangal’s arrest of these characters was met with strong resistance from the local Chief of Police and [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) chief , who had warned him that taking on drug traffickers was too dangerous . 
[PER Mangal  ] said he proceeded anyway , because he “knew that they were not stronger than the law.” [PER Mangal  ] admitted that the crackdown on narcotics traffickers in the city had created problems , and that his effectiveness as governor has suffered because of it . 
Nevertheless , he said he would never give up on maintaining security - and by extension - prosperity , in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Mangal  ] also said coordination between [ORG ANSF  ] and [ORG NATO  ] forces had improved greatly under his watch . 
He reported a good relationship with RC-South Deputy Commanding General [PER Nicholson  ] , and said he senses commitment from the [LOC United States  ] to continuing coordination against drug trafficking . 
[PER Mangal  ] thanked the [LOC United States  ] for its continuing counter narcotics support. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mangal  ] spoke of the success of the [ORG Food Zone Program  ] , which he hopes will be renewed for a second year . 
He reported he has achieved buy-in from many community leaders , including the line minister of health , tribal elders , and religious leaders , who issued a fatwah reminding [MISC Helmandis  ] that drugs are prohibited in [LOC Islam  ] . 
He also touted his public awareness campaign , which has included posters telling youth of the dangers of drugs , and informing farmers of alternative livelihood options . 
[PER Mangal  ] assured the Ambassador that poppy production would fall to zero this year. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Mangal  ] reminded the Ambassador that five districts in [LOC Helmand  ] are currently under control of enemy forces . 
He expressed hope that those would soon be under [MISC GIRoA  ] control , with help from the incoming [ORG Marine Expeditionary Brigade  ] ( [ORG MEB  ] ) . 
He recalled successful Marine operations in [LOC Garmsir  ] last year , which is now a secure district , and said elders at [LOC Bost  ] were very complementary about the [LOC U.S.  ] efforts . 
However , when the Ambassador asked him to assess the [MISC British  ] , [PER Mangal  ] said people are not optimistic . 
[PER Mangal  ] stressed he admires [MISC British  ] sacrifices and what they have done , but that the public is not happy because of unfulfilled goals . 
[PER Mangal  ] said [LOC Sangin  ] district looks like a “military compound” due to the high number of [LOC UK  ] troops , and opined this should not be necessary to maintain security there . 
He also complained that the [LOC UK  ] has done nothing to advance reconstruction goals in the province . 
He qualified these observations by saying that he admires the new techniques of [MISC British  ] special forces and hoped they would “change everything” by continuing to fight narcotics traffickers. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Referring to the successful counter narcotics operation at [LOC Marja  ] last month , [PER Mangal  ] told the Ambassador that some people had misinformed President [PER Karzai  ] . 
( [PER Note: Mangal  ] was referring to tribal leaders who reportedly misinformed [PER Karzai  ] that the operation had resulted in civilian casualties , rather than supporting the success of the operation . 
End note ) . 
[PER Mangal  ] proudly said he told [LOC KABUL  ] 00001677 002 OF 002 [PER Karzai  ] directly that the operation had targeted enemies and accomplished a major success . 
He also said civilian casualties had , in fact occurred , but not as many as [ORG Karzai’s  ] friends reported . 
[PER Mangal  ] said [ORG Karzai’s  ] friends - of which there are many in [LOC Helmand  ] , [LOC Kandahar  ] and Urugzan - often tell him the “wrong things.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Mangal  ] at first deflected the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] inquiry on the status of his relationship with [PER Karzai  ] , saying only that “I am working hard at doing my job.” He added that [PER Karzai  ] had attempted to replace him with Sher [PER Mohammed Akhunzada  ] , a known warlord and criminal , only three months after Mangal’s appointment last year . 
[PER Mangal  ] described a discussion he had with [PER Karzai  ] at the time , in which he said to [PER Karzai  ] “If you trust me , you must give me three more months to prove myself.” [PER Karzai  ] , according to [PER Mangal  ] , backed down , telling [PER Mangal  ] his anger was really directed at [LOC British Forces  ] . 
[PER Mangal  ] opined that [PER Karzai  ] remains jealous of his good relationship with [ORG ISAF  ] and coalition forces , but recognizes that [PER Mangal  ] is the best pick to make progress in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Mangal  ] admitted that his relationship with [PER Karzai  ] has suffered since he was governor of [LOC Laghman  ] . 
The Ambassador said the fact that [PER Karzai  ] assigned [PER Mangal  ] to such an important province was a signal of confidence and trust , but recognized that tensions would always exist due to [ORG Karzai’s  ] personal connections . 
The Ambassador said he can see Mangal’s strong relationship with leaders in [LOC Helmand  ] and reaffirmed that [MISC British  ] confidence in [PER Mangal  ] is very high . 
He also reassured [PER Mangal  ] that [LOC United States  ] sees him as a superb governor in a dangerous role , who is both wise and brave . 
He said [MISC Afghans  ] and the international community alike see [PER Mangal  ] among the rising generation of leaders in a new [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador told [PER Mangal  ] that new [ORG ISAF  ] Commander , General [PER Stanley McChrystal  ] , is a long-time professional colleague and personal friend , and promised to brief General [PER McChrystal  ] on the history of [LOC Helmand  ] before his first visit . 
For the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Helmand  ] is one of the top two or three provinces for our strategy in the next year , which is reflected in the deployment of our [MISC Marines  ] there . 
The Ambassador said in his new civilian role , he would increase the focus on reconstruction , governance and development , including programs that increase capacity and reduce unemployment . 
He stressed that in order to combat unemployment , we will work hard on agricultural productivity and programs that help farmers bring those products to market road development . 
Small scale irrigation systems will also be emphasized . 
At the same time , we will take all measures we can to reinforce programs to establish better governance and to increase communication with [PER Karzai  ] . 
The Ambassador encouraged [PER Mangal  ] not to lose faith . 
He invited [PER Mangal  ] to stop by any time he is in [LOC Kabul  ] , and said on his next visit to [LOC Helmand  ] , they would walk through the bazaar together . 
[PER Mangal  ] thanked the Ambassador for his kind words and vowed to keep pushing forward change in [LOC Helmand  ] .
