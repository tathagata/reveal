( [ORG S  ] ) EmbOff met March 10 with [PER Kees Jan Steenhoek  ] , [ORG Senior Policy Advisor , Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] , to discuss reftel points . 
[PER Steenhoek  ] is responsible for the [ORG GONL  ] 's export control process . 
He appreciated the information as he said the [ORG GONL  ] had not been aware of [MISC AMT Netherlands'  ] exports to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Steenhoek  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] would most likely use a catch-all procedure under the [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] that will require [LOC AMT Netherlands  ] to obtain a license for all exports of UAV engines to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Steenhoek  ] said he did not suspect [LOC AMT Netherlands  ] was aware of the possible connection between its customer ( [ORG Parilla Company  ] ) and [LOC Iran  ] 's UAV program , in which case he predicted the company would likely back away from this commercial relationship . 
[PER Steenhoek  ] said he would also share reftel points with the [ORG Dutch Intelligence and Security Services  ] ( [ORG AIVD  ] ) as well as generic lookout information with the [ORG Dutch Customs Administration  ] .
