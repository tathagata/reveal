( U ) On February 11 , Econoffs delivered reftel points on the second stage of the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] [ORG Air Transport Negotiations  ] to [PER Hans de Jong  ] , [ORG Special Advisor  ] and Chief Negotiator for aviation issues , and [PER Janneke Kolk  ] , [ORG Policy Advisor  ] , at the [ORG Ministry of Transport  ] , [ORG Public Works  ] , and [ORG Water Management  ] . 
[PER De Jong  ] , who has served as a senior aviation negotiator for the [LOC Netherlands  ] for many years , believes that the time has come for [MISC European  ] transport ministers to take a political decision on whether the [ORG EU  ] wants to move forward in the negotiations , particularly given that the [LOC U.S.  ] cannot commit to changing our laws on ownership and control of [LOC U.S.  ] carriers before the end of 2010 . 
[PER De Jong  ] would view the upcoming negotiations in [LOC Madrid  ] as successful if the [LOC U.S.  ] could express at least a political commitment to make progress on the outstanding issues ( the priorities in paragraph 2 of Article 21 of the first stage agreement , which includes the issue of [LOC U.S.  ] ownership and control ) . 
[PER De Jong  ] supported the [LOC U.S.  ] emphasis on pragmatism ; he suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] could display such pragmatism by providing reciprocity on the issue of wet leasing , or short-term contracts for use of aircraft , personnel , and maintenance services . 
( The [ORG EU  ] allows [LOC U.S.  ] carriers to engage in wet leasing in the [ORG EU  ] , but the [LOC U.S.  ] does not reciprocate . 
) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER De Jong  ] believes the top priority for the [ORG EU  ] going into [LOC Madrid  ] remains [LOC U.S.  ] foreign ownership and control laws , although this is not as significant an issue for the [MISC Dutch  ] specifically . 
[PER De Jong  ] noted that [ORG EU  ] negotiators need to demonstrate progress on this issue to [MISC European  ] transport ministers . 
He recognized , however , that the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] will be unable to persuade [ORG Congress  ] to pass legislation to relax [LOC U.S.  ] ownership/control rules , particularly given the fierce opposition of Rep. [PER James Oberstar  ] ( [ORG D-MN  ] ) on the [ORG House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  ] . 
[PER De Jong  ] added that this is now an even more difficult issue for the [ORG Administration  ] after the loss of the [MISC Democrats'  ] super majority in the [ORG Senate  ] . 
He suggested the [MISC EU-Canada  ] arrangement of a phased-in approach could serve as a model in striking a compromise. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER De Jong  ] believes the two sides are within reach of compromise on the problematic [ORG EU  ] decision-making process on noise restrictions at [ORG EU  ] airports - if they can find the right wording to use in the [ORG Air Transport Agreement  ] . 
According to [PER de Jong  ] , however , the [MISC Dutch  ] will never accept [MISC EU-wide  ] measures governing aviation noise , because local circumstances - including environmental , community development , and political considerations - must always be taken into account in this area .
