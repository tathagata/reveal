THE HAGUE 174 Classified By: CDA [PER Andrew Schofer  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Per reftels , [ORG MFA Senior Advisor for Nonproliferation and Nuclear Affairs  ] Ceta [PER Noland  ] told polmiloff March 6 that the [MISC Dutch  ] firm [ORG Inter Connection Technologies  ] ( [ORG InCo Tech  ] ) had contacted the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] on December 17 , 2007 , regarding the planned export of connectors to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Noland  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] determined at that time that the connectors in question did not pose a [ORG WMD  ] risk ; she suggested the connectors were quite ordinary and run-of-the-mill . 
As such , she said no objections were raised against this planned export. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Noland  ] doubted but could not confirm if the shipment of connectors had already been exported to [LOC Iran  ] . 
She said it typically takes several months after an export approval for the export to occur . 
[MISC Dutch  ] customs officials can check whether an export has taken place , but [PER Noland  ] explained that due to an e-system output delay , there is typically a three-month delay between the date of the export and the export 's appearance in the [MISC Dutch  ] customs' database . 
Thus , she noted that even if the export had occurred immediately following the export approval , it would not yet be listed in the database . 
[PER Noland  ] welcomed any additional information from [LOC Washington  ] regarding the specifications of the connectors , and how they might pose a [ORG WMD  ] risk -- if the shipment has not gone forward , then the [ORG GONL  ] might be able to reexamine the case .
