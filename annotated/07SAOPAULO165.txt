( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: In his February 6 meeting in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] with senior [MISC Brazilian  ] energy experts , Under Secretary [PER R. Nicholas Burns  ] emphasized the tremendous potential of [MISC U.S.-Brazilian  ] cooperation on ethanol , and solicited his interlocutors' views on developing this partnership . 
Discussion centered on the foreign policy and market-building potential of this cooperation . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] was accompanied by WHA Assistant Secretary [PER Tom Shannon  ] , [ORG International Energy Coordinator  ] [PER Greg Manuel  ] , SIPDIS S/P Member [PER William McIlhenny  ] , and P Special Assistant [PER Heide Bronke  ] . 
Following briefings and meetings in the Consulate , [PER U/S Burns  ] and his delegation , along with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] , [PER FAS Attach Alan Hrapsky  ] , ATO Director [PER Morgan Perkins  ] , and econoff [PER Valerie Wheat  ] ( notetaker ) , met with [MISC Brazilian  ] experts in the energy field to discuss avenues of mutual cooperation . 
The discussion focused mostly on [LOC Brazil  ] 's experiences with ethanol . 
Participants included [PER Luis Carvalho  ] , agronomist and Chairman of the [ORG National Chamber  ] for Ethanol and Sugar ; [PER Plinio Nastari  ] , Agricultural Economist and consultant ; and [PER William Lee Burnquist  ] , agronomist at the [ORG Cane Technology Center.  ] ------------------------------ [ORG BILATERAL BIOFUELS COOPERATION  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER U/S Burns  ] opened the discussion by referring to the potential for tremendous growth opportunities for both countries in the area of ethanol and asking the speakers to explore the possibilities for strengthening the [MISC U.S.-Brazilian  ] relationship based on cooperation in the ethanol sector . 
How , he asked , could the world 's two largest ethanol-producing countries , working together , impact on the global ethanol market ? 
Is there a possibility for cooperation in science and technology and joint research to stimulate alternative fuel production ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nastari  ] described how [LOC Brazil  ] is currently producing two types of ethanol: a blend of 20-25 percent , and pure fuel for dedicated fleets . 
[LOC Brazil  ] produces ethanol cars and flex-fuel engine automobiles . 
Currently 82 percent of new automobile sales are flex-fuel cars . 
40.4 percent of fuel consumed in [LOC Brazil  ] is ethanol. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] , using sugarcane technology , is currently converting molasses to ethanol , and this activity is expanding rapidly . 
The basis for good ethanol production is agriculture . 
Cost-efficient sugar cane production yields cheap sugar cane . 
Sixty percent of the cost of producing ethanol is the raw material . 
[LOC Brazil  ] produces high-yield sugar cane inexpensively and can share its expertise and technology with the rest of [LOC Latin America  ] and extend outward after that . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has already begun to work with other countries , e.g. , [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
Industry contacts noted that with widespread sugar production throughout [LOC Latin America  ] , development of a regional ethanol industry would provide a broadly-based energy supply . 
However , in order for this sector to develop in countries not currently producing ethanol even though they have large quantities of molasses , a regulatory framework is needed . 
[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000165 002 OF 003 ------------------------ FOREIGN POLICY POTENTIAL ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Burnquist  ] stressed ethanol 's enormous potential for foreign policy . 
Development of an alternative fuel source could help counter-balance [LOC Venezuela  ] 's influence , for example , in the [LOC Caribbean  ] . 
[PER Post-Castro Cuba  ] could become an important producer . 
[LOC Brazil  ] could build on President [PER Lula  ] 's " south-south " initiative by expanding to [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Asia  ] , and other parts of the developing world . 
Ethanol technology for [LOC Latin America  ] could fulfill the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] goals of 1 ) phasing out lead , and 2 ) phasing out use of [LOC MTBE.  ] -------------------------- MAKING ETHANOL A COMMODITY -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Carvalho  ] , seventy-five percent of all ethanol produced worldwide comes from the [LOC United States  ] or [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The two countries are natural partners , able to push sustainability with biofuels . 
They can produce clean energy , increase their incomes , and establish stronger commercial ties . 
Ethanol should be considered a commodity , with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] working together , able to establish reference prices . 
This could reduce ethanol costs , aid with mechanization in collection of raw materials ( tractor companies such as [PER John Deere  ] ) , and assist in increasing trade in ethanol along the entire production chain . 
[LOC Japan  ] is very interested in maintaining a supply adequate to its needs , increasing mandatory ethanol use from 3 to 10 percent . 
There are great investment opportunities in this area , with profits virtually guaranteed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Carvalho  ] further elaborated that technologically , [LOC Brazil  ] is very advanced . 
Today it can produce more sugarcane per acre due to the development of high-yield crops . 
Although not yet economically feasible , cellulosic enzyme processing makes it possible to produce 50 percent more ethanol with the same input as currently used , if it can be transformed to sugar base. ----------------- CREATING A MARKET ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With the [LOC United States  ] targeting greater use of ethanol ( 35 billion gallons per year ) , the prospects for the market are good , [PER Burnquist  ] said , the more so because a growing problem in the [LOC U.S.  ] is the amount of water available for the [MISC US-corn  ] based ethanol production . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is not a direct competitor , [PER Burnquist  ] continued , because its production is sugar-based . 
Growing domestic demand for ethanol will make it a challenge for [MISC Brazilian  ] producers to supply enough ethanol for its own needs ; they will not immediately need to seek markets outside [LOC Brazil  ] . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] has good R&D , technology , and expertise , and has developed cane varieties . 
It can share this knowledge to assist other nations to become economically viable using sugar cane technology , as it has already done in [LOC Paraguay  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Peru  ] and [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER U/S Burns  ] asked how the Governments of [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] could come together to work more closely on ethanol . 
[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000165 003 OF 003 The sugar cane industry in [LOC Brazil  ] is traditionally private , replied [PER Burnquist  ] , with no formal role for the GoB , which is still formulating its policy . 
This would be a propitious moment for the two governments to work together , using ethanol as a trade incentive and reaping the foreign policy benefits . 
However , there needs to be careful joint planning to develop a proper regulatory framework. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The roundtable provided a useful overview of the issues and challenges involved in developing alternative energy sources . 
During his subsequent encounters with political leaders and media , and in his well-attended and well-received speech , [PER U/S Burns  ] repeatedly called on the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] to work together to develop the regulatory infrastructure and technical capacity to create an international market for ethanol . 
End Comment. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) This cable was coordinated with [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] and cleared by [PER U/S Burns  ] 's delegation and Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] .
