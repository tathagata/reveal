Sanderson  ] , reason 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
Summary and Introduction ------------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Haitian  ] President [PER Rene Preval  ] has now completed three years of his five year presidential mandate . 
Widely touted as the " transitional president " poised to lead [LOC Haiti  ] into a new era of democracy and economic prosperity , he has had only modest success thus far . 
[LOC Haiti  ] 's problems are indeed daunting , and redressing them will take much more than a five-year term . 
However , [PER Preval  ] 's particular world view , his personality and often indecisive and uncommunicative leadership style , coupled with [LOC Haiti  ] 's deeply divided political class and the devastating events of 2008 , have conspired to defer , if not derail , forward movement here. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) That being said , [PER Preval  ] remains [LOC Haiti  ] 's indispensable man . 
Legitimately elected , still moderately popular , and likely the only politician capable of imposing his will on [LOC Haiti  ] - if so inclined - [PER Preval  ] 's role over the next 18 months is critical . 
Dealing with [PER Preval  ] is a challenge , occasionally frustrating and sometimes rewarding . 
He is wary of change and suspicious of outsiders , even those who seek his success . 
Managing [PER Preval  ] will remain challenging during the remainder of his term yet doing so is key to our success and that of [LOC Haiti  ] . 
We must continue to find creative ways to work with him , influence him , and encourage him to recapture the activism of his first year in office . 
Until he does , political change and economic progress , so necessary to [LOC Haiti  ] 's future , is likely to be incremental at best . 
The Politics of Personality ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's attitude towards his presidency has been shaped by both experience and personality . 
As [PER Aristide  ] 's Prime Minister and successor , he was overshadowed by the more charismatic ex-priest . 
At our first meeting , [PER Preval  ] recounted that he was " the last stop after Tabarre ( where [PER Aristide  ] lived ) when visitors came " , bitterly reminding me that many USG visitors barely had time to see him when he was president . 
Those slights still rankle . 
A retiring , complex personality , the president shares little . 
His inner circle has greatly constricted during the past two years , with key advisors including [PER Bob Manuel  ] , all but dropping out . 
His involvement with his fiancee , financial advisor [PER Babette Delatour  ] has colored many of his other relationships , according to friends , and caused an estrangement of sorts with his sister and one of his daughters. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Even those close to [PER Preval  ] concede that his chameleon-like character makes dealing with the president difficult . 
One close advisor calls it " the roller coaster that is [PER Rene Preval  ] . 
" Personally engaging - even seductive - when he so wishes , [PER Preval  ] can be equally harsh with colleagues and others . 
Ministers , close advisors and others have felt the sting of his tongue , both in public and in private . 
Stubbornly holding to ideas long past their shelf life , he rarely welcomes dissenting opinions . 
His courting of [LOC Taiwan  ] in 2006 , which almost led to the [MISC Chinese  ] blocking renewal of the [MISC MINUSTAH  ] mandate in 2006 , is a case in point . 
[PER Preval  ] is highly disinclined to delegate power or authority and even the smallest detail comes to his office for decision , a situation which has caused stress in his relationships with both his current and former prime ministers . 
Planning Minister Bellerive described to me a recent Cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister and the Cabinet presented a development plan for the long-suffering northern tier of the country . 
[PER Preval  ] ridiculed the idea and when confronted by a united ministerial front , walked out of the cabinet meeting and told his advisors to strike the proposal from the agenda. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Uncomfortable in formal settings such as summits and international conferences , [PER Preval  ] seeks personal " relationships of trust " with his interlocutors . 
Often unable to articulate exactly what he wants - except in the broadest of terms - [PER Preval  ] tends to view issues in black and white . 
Nonetheless , he expects a positive - and prompt response . 
That is particularly true of his dealings with the international community . 
He remains skeptical about the international community 's commitment to his government 's goals , for instance telling me that he is suspicious of how the [ORG Collier  ] report will be used . 
He measures success with the international community - and the [LOC U.S.-  ] in terms of positive response to his priorities , rather than according to some broader international benchmarks of success. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , [PER Preval  ] 's stubborn and cautious nature has sometimes borne fruit . 
In his first year in office , he was widely praised for reaching out to [MISC Haitians  ] of all political stripes and for attempting to bridge [LOC Haiti  ] 's massive political divides . 
He has shrewdly coopted major political rivals into his personal cabinet over the past two years and has , through patient diplomacy managed to get fractious parliamentary groupings to sit around the table working on issues ranging from the budget to privatization to the current minimum wage crisis . 
He believes strongly that without his intercession , the international community would have ignored the impact of the 2008 hurricanes on [LOC Haiti  ] , and that his early efforts at negotiation and discussion with the gangs of [PER Cite Soleil  ] ( which he often reminds me that I criticized at the time ) set the stage for the successful [MISC MINUSTAH  ] operation to clear the area . 
A Narrowing Circle ? ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's seeming isolation in the palace during the past year is striking . 
Close friends report that they have little contact - and even less influence - with him . 
A businessman who was key to [PER Preval  ] 's election said the last time that he talked to [PER Preval  ] , the president brushed him off . 
Shunning newspapers and radio , he has a friend in [LOC New York  ] do a daily press summary for him ; otherwise he freely admits that he neither reads nor listens to the news , either local or international . 
He uses one or two cell phones but rarely shares the numbers with his colleagues . 
He uses his email to communicate with family and close friends , but prefers to talk on the telephone . 
He seldom leaves the palace except to travel to his residence each evening and to the retreat he has bought for his fiancee in the mountains above [LOC Port  ] au Prince . 
The [ORG Health Issue ----------------  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's occasionally erratic behavior over the past year has again sparked widespread rumors that he is suffering from the effects of his past prostate cancer or that he has resumed drinking . 
There is no indication that he is taking medicine that affects his judgment or temperament , but he has ignored suggestions from his inner circle , including that of [PER Delatour  ] , that he do complete medical check-up in the [LOC U.S.  ] He has not been to [LOC Cuba  ] for follow-up tests in more than a year . 
[PER Preval  ] has increased his alcoholic consumption and often attends a [ORG Petionville  ] night club with friends , but during our social interaction I have never seen him drink to excess . 
Nonetheless , reports of heavy drinking are circulating widely . 
An Agenda deferred: Elections , [ORG Constitutional Reform  ] , and Drugs --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] has said that his agenda for his remaining years in office focuses on three interconnected issues: elections , constitutional reform , and drugs . 
He came late to the election issue , originally suggesting that the partial [ORG Senatorial  ] elections be combined with the lower house polls scheduled for fall . 
He backed down in the face of international pressure , but also as he came to realize that he would have little success - or support - if he moved on constitutional reform without a fully functioning senate . 
Given the delays in moving this election forward , he no longer believes that he will see an overhaul of the constitution . 
He now expects to focus on two critical constitutional issues , dual nationality and government decentralization . 
He has angrily denied charges that he manipulated the electoral process through the [ORG CEP  ] and its decision to exclude Lavalas to undermine an already weak legislature. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's focus on comprehensive constitutional reform over the past year raised concerns about his ulterior motives . 
Many in [LOC Haiti  ] 's political class drew the conclusion that [PER Preval  ] was seeking a third term . 
The President 's refusal to explicitly reject that possibility created confusion and uncertainty , but I view this development as highly unlikely . 
Nonetheless , concerns about [PER Preval  ] 's intentions , coupled with deteriorating relations with parliament , and his cavalier treatment of major political parties has undermined consensus on constitutional reform and he seems now resigned to more limited changes. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's fixation on drug trafficking reflects both a growing frustration with the inflow of drugs into the country 's political process and irritation that his government is unable to address something that could indeed pose a personal threat to his future after the presidency . 
Shunning all GOH responsibility for the problem , he looks to hand it over to us . 
He has yet to believe that we take his concerns seriously , and that has colored much of his dealings with us beyond the counternarcotics agenda . 
A not-always-helpful world view ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Although [PER Preval  ] 's presidency started off well , with the new president reaching out across the political spectrum in an effort to create a new political culture in the country , those efforts have now essentially stalled . 
The President , whether by inclination or design , has not fully developed a vision of [LOC Haiti  ] 's future . 
By turns determined or distracted , [PER Preval  ] is often reluctant to use the levers of power given to him by the office of the presidency . 
In one telling instance , he held off going public in the April riots until the presidency appeared to hang in the balance . 
Skeptical of friends from abroad , and cynical about his own political class 's ability to effect change , [PER Preval  ] believes that it is best only to speak out after the deals are done . 
Pressing him to be more expansive and communicative has been , in my experience , counterproductive . 
At the same time , he is reluctant to let anyone else pick up the slack , and as a result , the political vacuum in [LOC Haiti  ] is often filled by those who do not necessarily have the nation 's best interests at heart. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) There are those who argue that the April , 2008 riots so badly shook [PER Preval  ] 's world view that he has become reluctant to act . 
We believe this is too simplistic an explanation . 
[PER Preval  ] was indeed unprepared for the riots in the street , but he used them to press some key objectives , including the removal of then-Prime Minister [PER Jacques-Edouard Alexis  ] . 
More to the point , I believe that the President 's own style and outlook , his often unilateral decision-making style , his propensity to micromanage , and his essentially cynical ( and often justified ) view of the [MISC Haitian  ] political process were , I believe , reinforced by what he saw in April , and he is looking for ways to ensure he is not caught unawares again. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] 's old friends suggest that in many ways he remains the radical student who broke with his conservative father and spent his university days in the political maelstrom of 1960s [LOC Europe  ] . 
While this may overstate the case , [PER Preval  ] remains essentially a nationalist politician in the [MISC Haitian  ] sense of the word - suspicious of outsiders intentions and convinced that no one understands [LOC Haiti  ] like he does . 
He often takes actions , such as publicly dismissing the results of the [ORG Washington Donors Conference  ] or stalling elections , which could be construed as working at cross purposes with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Preval  ] clearly believes that he can walk a fine line without losing [LOC U.S.  ] or international community support . 
Here , however , he runs a risk . 
Although he briefly lived in the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Preval  ] does not truly understand [MISC Americans  ] or the [LOC Washington  ] policy environment - and he often ignores advisors who do . 
The [MISC After-Life  ] -------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Close friends speculate that many of [PER Preval  ] 's actions during the past year - his rapprochement with [PER Alexis  ] and the [MISC Neptune  ] faction of Lavalas , his obsession with constitutional reform , his anger over drug trafficker [PER Guy Philippe  ] , even his reactions to the April riots - stem from his very real fear that politics will prohibit him from returning to private life in [LOC Haiti  ] after his presidency . 
Thus , they argue , his overriding goal is to orchestrate the 2011 presidential transition in such a way as to ensure that whoever is elected will allow him to go home unimpeded . 
Based on our conversations , this is indeed a matter that looms large for [PER Preval  ] . 
He has said to me on various occasions that he is worried about his life after the presidency , that he would not survive in exile . 
His concerns seem real , given [LOC Haiti  ] 's history , albeit somewhat overblown at this point in time . 
What It Means for Us --------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Preval  ] and I entered on duty in our respective positions at pretty much the same time and we have enjoyed an interesting , if not always harmonious , relationship during the past three and a half years . 
During that period , I have found him somewhat isolated , less open to ideas and advice , and more reluctant to use the tools of his office to advance his agenda than in his first year in office . 
Some say that he is reverting to the do-nothing persona of his first term as president . 
Like much about [PER Preval  ] , the reality is somewhat more complicated . 
What is clear to me , however , is that [PER Preval  ] has yet to truly provide the strong , consistent leadership that [LOC Haiti  ] 's current circumstances demand . 
In other places , we could find ways to circumvent or overcome these weaknesses . 
Not so in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Given [LOC Haiti  ] 's strong tradition of presidential rule , the blurred constitutional lines of authority , and his own reluctance to delegate authority , I believe that [PER Preval  ] - and only [PER Preval  ] - will continue to set the rhythm and scope of change in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
And while we may argue with him about pace and priorities , we will have to adapt to his rhythm . 
Dealing with [PER Preval  ] has never been easy . 
Yet he remains [LOC Haiti  ] 's indispensable man and he must succeed in passing this country to a new leadership in 2011 . 
We therefore must continue to find creative , consistent ways to reinforce and maintain our engagement - at all levels of the USG - with [PER Preval  ] and to press him to move forward the important agenda of change that remains as yet unrealized here .
