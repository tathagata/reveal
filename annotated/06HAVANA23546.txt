( C ) Summary: An unprecedented opposition youth forum brought together young [MISC Cuban  ] pro-democracy activists and counterparts from [LOC Monterrey  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] on November 24 in [LOC Havana  ] . 
The three-hour-long event , held at the [ORG PAO Residence  ] , saw participants engage in open debate after watching an inspirational documentary on the fall of [PER Milosevic  ] . 
Many of the participants agreed on the need to coordinate the activities of the country 's three biggest opposition youth groups . 
They acknowledged that they are much weaker than the [MISC Yugoslav  ] youth groups ( especially [ORG OTPUR  ] ) depicted in the documentary . 
[MISC Cuban  ] authorities prevented at least 11 young activists from taking part , but did not interrupt the event or launch an immediate crackdown against participants . 
Retaliatory action could be harsh . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Sixty-three young pro-democracy activists from three of [LOC Cuba  ] 's most influential opposition youth groups gathered in [LOC Havana  ] on November 24 for a landmark forum aimed at finding common ground . 
The event , held in the back yard of the [ORG PAO Residence  ] , drew members [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX Also  ] present were young members of other groups from [LOC Bayamo  ] , [LOC Camaguey  ] , [LOC Ciego  ] de [LOC Avila  ] , [LOC Havana  ] , [LOC Pinar  ] del [LOC Rio  ] , [LOC Matanzas  ] , [LOC Santa Clara  ] , [LOC Santiago  ] and [LOC Trinidad  ] . 
Two young [MISC Mexican  ] pro-democracy activists from [LOC Monterrey  ] brought messages of support . 
Several USINT officials were also present . 
One would-be [MISC Cuban  ] participant was detained and police prevented at least ten others from attending ( mainly by confiscating their ID cards ) , but the [ORG GOC  ] did not launch an immediate crackdown after the event . 
" RESISTANCE " ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After brief welcoming remarks by [LOC Poloff  ] , the three youth-group leaders addressed the crowd and then turned the microphone over to the [MISC Mexicans  ] , who spoke passionately about " solidarity " and the inevitable triumph of democracy in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Participants then watched a stirring , 70-minute documentary on the fall of [MISC Yugoslavian  ] dictator [PER Milosevic  ] , which emphasized the role of youth group [ORG OTPOR  ] ( " Resistance " ) in precipitating change , through rallies , outreach and biting sarcasm . 
Among the scenes that resonated most with participants were those in which the regime labeled [ORG OTPOR  ] activists as " terrorists . 
" ( [MISC Note: Virtually  ] all of the viewers have been branded " mercenaries , " " terrorists " or " traitors . 
" End Note . 
) On the other hand , it was clear to the [MISC Cubans  ] that [ORG OTPOR  ] had more room to maneuver in [LOC Yugoslavia  ] and that [MISC Cuban  ] groups are far behind in terms of influence and organizational capacity . 
ONGOING HARASSMENT ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) For the ensuing 90 minutes , participants took turns addressing the group in an open debate . 
Topics included the intense , ongoing harassment of activists , particularly those in eastern [LOC Cuba  ] ; horrific prison conditions and attacks by guards ; a project to press the [ORG GOC  ] to allow the reopening of a [MISC Catholic  ] university ; and the problematic situation of [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] sufferers , thousands of whom are unable to receive the medicines they require . 
A common theme at the forum was the need to coordinate the activities of the key youth groups , and to network with university groups in a way that avoids a [ORG State Security  ] crackdown . 
HEAVY STATE SECURITY PRESENCE ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG State Security  ] presence around the venue , in [LOC Havana  ] 's [LOC Miramar  ] district , was heavy , and police patrol cars passed by the site frequently . 
Two large vans of the [MISC Cuban  ] telecom , [ORG ETECSA  ] , were parked next door . 
However , the [ORG GOC  ] made no obvious effort to interrupt the event , either through power cuts or blocked street access . 
( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us November 25 that they were not aware of any of their groups' participants being detained after the event . 
) There was only one incident involving a possible [ORG GOC  ] provocateur . 
An uninvited " independent journalist " who showed up and gained entry after asking a youth-group leader to vouch for him addressed the group and rejected the messages of the [MISC Mexicans  ] and the documentary , saying " the problems of [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Yugoslavia  ] are not the problems of [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" [LOC HAVANA  ] 00023546 002.3 OF 002 PRISONER QUILT DISPLAYED ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A centerpiece of the forum was the vertical display of the " prisoners of conscience " quilt , a paneled work honoring the 75 peaceful pro-democracy and human rights activists jailed in the " [ORG Black Spring  ] " crackdown of 2003 . 
( Sixty of the 75 remain behind bars . 
) The imprisoned activists' names are embroidered on the quilt , which was created in [LOC Boston  ] by members of the group [MISC Cuban  ] Flag . 
The quilt drew attention and generated considerable buzz . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) That 63 young " opositores " would travel long distances , at substantial personal expense and with no assurance that they would not be subsequently imprisoned , shows the hunger among some [MISC Cuban  ] youth not only for change , but for action to set that change in motion . 
As thought-provoking as the documentary and debate were , the true success of the November 24 event lay in the networking that occurred on the sidelines , with small groups of like-minded young [MISC Cubans  ] meeting each other , most for the first time . 
The event also went a long way toward building bridges between the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , which have for years suffered from mutual mistrust and bad blood , some of it personality-driven . 
For one evening , at least , the leaders of these groups focused on their common objectives. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) One key value in the event was that it was a grass-roots , Cuban-generated activity . 
It would not have happened without USINT providing the venue and facilitating contacts . 
It is one small but important counterpoint to the regime 's boast that since July 31 , all [MISC Cubans  ] have been quiet and accepting of [PER Fidel  ] 's " proclama . 
" We anticipate that the [MISC Cuban  ] Government will retaliate harshly , both against the young dissidents and against USINT , which helped sponsor the event at their request . 
The regime will likely use state media and mass-based communist organizations to label the youth leaders as [ORG USG  ] agents , and mobilize militant thugs and [ORG State Security  ] officials to punish them with " acts of repudiation , " citations , brief detentions , and possibly expulsions from workplaces and universities . 
We will be working just as intently to encourage actions in the other direction , particularly more/better networking among university students who oppose the regime .
