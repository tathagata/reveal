Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [PER Summary: Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's speech at [ORG UNGA  ] , and TV footage of him scribbling " We are here " on a piece of paper while seated at [LOC Libya  ] 's chair at an empty UNSC chamber during a private tour , are on regular repeat in [MISC Libyan  ] press today . 
Official accounts highlighted the historic importance of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's trip to [LOC New York  ] after 40 years in power - and 30 in isolation . 
Several contacts , however , worried that the 100-minute speech and accompanying theater endangered both his objective ( [ORG UN  ] reform ) and [LOC Libya  ] 's international stature . 
Proponents of [LOC Libya  ] 's re-engagement with the international community were left worrying that the speech would stunt progress with the [LOC West  ] . 
Locals reported that chatter among normal [MISC Libyans  ] focused on [PER Qadhafi  ] 's antics and his re-asserting his supremacy over [MISC Libyan  ] politics after months of succession rumors . 
End summary . 
OFFICIAL REACTION FOCUSED ON HISTORIC MOMENT 2 . 
( C ) [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's trip to the [ORG UN  ] and his September 23 speech at the [ORG UN General Assembly General Debate  ] were covered in a media blitz on state-run outlets . 
All satellite television stations interrupted normal broadcasts to carry the September 23 speeches , starting with [ORG UNGA  ] President and veteran [MISC Libyan  ] diplomat [PER Ali Treiki  ] , [ORG POTUS  ] , and [MISC Libyan  ] leader al-Qadhafi 's 100-minute speech . 
All returned to normal programming before [MISC Ugandan  ] President [PER Yoweri Museveni  ] took the dais . 
Twenty-four hours later , excerpts from the speech , along with footage of [PER Qadhafi  ] at [LOC Libya  ] 's seat at an empty UNSC chamber writing " We are here " on a piece of paper , ran at regular intervals on state-run media , accompanied by commentary highlighting the historic nature of the [MISC Libyan  ] Leader 's inaugural trip to the [LOC United States  ] after 40 years in power . 
Radio stations have replayed the speech several times , and the official [ORG Jamahiriya News Agency  ] has what it purports is the full text of the speech , parsed over 20 different pages of its website . 
3 . 
( C ) Both state-run and quasi-independent media outlets expressed the view that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's trip was a milestone in his efforts to achieve a more just international order and applauded the " wisdom " he demonstrated during the unprecedented event . 
Following the speech , [MISC Libyan  ] mobile phone provider [PER Al Madar  ] ( owned by [PER Qadhafi  ] 's eldest son [MISC Muhammed  ] ) sent a text message to select subscribers proclaiming " [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi: Conscience of the World . 
" xxxxxxxxxxxx [MISC Arab-language  ] blogs made reference to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's assuming the mantle of [PER Gamal Abdel Nasser  ] due to his candor and comportment while championing the rights of smaller states . 
MOST CONTACTS PRIVATELY DISAPPOINTED , [ORG EMBARRASED  ] 4 . 
( C ) For many [MISC Libyans  ] , [PER Qadhafi  ] 's [ORG UNGA  ] address marks the culmination of [LOC Libya  ] 's decade-long re-engagement with the [LOC West  ] . 
Some ordinary citizens seemed excited and proud that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's first visit to the [ORG UN  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] would mark [LOC Libya  ] 's full return to the international community . 
Others seemed to recognize that [LOC New York  ] represented a personal triumph vice a broader [MISC Libyan  ] one . 
5 . 
( C ) The Leader 's lengthy speech , however , engendered embarrassment and concern among embassy contacts. xxxxxxxxxxxx While several contacts supported [PER Qadhafi  ] 's argument for [ORG UN  ] reform , a self-described " proud nationalist " xxxxxxxxxxxx worried that the manner in which the points were delivered would undercut [PER Qadhafi  ] 's objectives . 
Others seemed disappointed at [PER Qadhafi  ] 's lost opportunity to start a substantive discussion on what they see as genuine concerns with the [ORG UN  ] 's structure , and seemed shamed by [PER Qadhafi  ] 's antics in [LOC New York.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx Several foreign-educated [MISC Libyans  ] worried that the speech could have a negative impact on [LOC Libya  ] 's relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx 6 . 
( C ) Diplomatic contacts commented that the performance was vintage [PER Qadhafi  ] and entirely expected . 
While [PER Qadhafi  ] was more energetic and animated than he has been at recent Summits , he [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000762 002.2 OF 002 was clearly tired from travel and " waking up at four in the morning . 
" [ Note: [PER Qadhafi  ] prefers evenings and is prone to unpredictable behavior when tired ; an [MISC Egyptian  ] diplomat wrote-off [PER Qadhafi  ] 's recent tiff with [LOC Sudan  ] over partition to his lack of sleep around the September 1 holiday . 
End note . 
] While [PER Qadhafi  ] employed an improvisational style - clearly speaking beyond the content of the handwritten notes - all of his central themes ( and several rhetorical flourishes ) had been previewed in remarks over the past several years . 
I AM ( STILL ) HERE: ORDINARY [MISC LIBYANS  ] SEE SUCCESSION MESSAGE 7 . 
( C ) Local contacts report that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's speech set [LOC Tripoli  ] abuzz with conversation . 
While many educated [MISC Libyans  ] are cynical regarding [PER Qadhafi  ] 's leadership , they also appreciate the importance of his role to ensure continued engagement with the outside world . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] 's comments suggesting that the [ORG UN  ] headquarters move to [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , or a " middle hemisphere " and add seats to the [ORG Security Council  ] for multinational alliances , such as the [ORG Non-aligned Movement  ] and the [ORG African Union  ] ( of which [PER Qadhafi  ] is the chair ) , added fuel to a persistent local rumor that , in the near future , the Leader would assume a more international role and hand off authority to his second son , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi . 
[ Note: [PER Saif  ] 's brother and potential rival , [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , along with FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] and Protocol Chief [PER Nuri Mismari  ] , accompanied the Leader to [ORG UNGA  ] . 
End note . 
] Diplomats and [MISC Libyans  ] both commented that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's major success in [LOC New York  ] was in his mere presence - reminding the world , and specifically the [MISC Libyan  ] people , that he was the undisputed leader of his country . 
8 . 
( C ) Comment: The Leader 's speech was classic [PER Qadhafi  ] and undoubtedly won him global attention . 
During the speech , two spelling variants of his name breached the top ten trending items on Twitter at the same time ( suggesting he was the most-tweeted topic ) , and international outlets that had passed on UNSG [PER Ban Ki-Moon  ] 's address made a special point to broadcast most of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's remarks live . 
However , his likely extemporaneous remarks and apparent disregard for protocol played into the narratives of critics and foreign media on the most prominent stage [PER Qadhafi  ] has yet graced . 
While he avoided fanning flames on bilateral topics ( mention of the [MISC Megrahi  ] affair was notably absent ) , his performance proves that he has not yet been chastened by international complaints on his [ORG Summit  ] pontifications . 
We expect [PER Qadhafi  ] and his entourage will find a way to be most pleased with what they will surely term the Leader 's long-awaited " apotheosis .
