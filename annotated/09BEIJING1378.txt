SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The book " Unhappy [LOC China  ] , " a nationalistic rant against the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] 's own supposedly [MISC West-worshipping  ] elite , sold briskly in [LOC China  ] following its release in March , but sales appear to have tapered off . 
[LOC China  ] 's official media have been largely critical of the book . 
Only a " small minority " of [MISC Chinese  ] citizens subscribes to the authors' nationalism and anti-Americanism , numerous contacts have told [PER PolOffs  ] . 
The book 's radicalism was largely a " ploy " to boost sales , but will not sway a sophisticated and internationally oriented [MISC Chinese  ] public , many contacts said . 
[LOC America  ] 's image has improved significantly , including among recent university graduates , thanks to President [PER Bush  ] 's attendance at the 2008 [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Olympics  ] opening ceremony and the election of President [PER Obama  ] . 
While most Embassy interlocutors downplayed the idea that " Unhappy [LOC China  ] " enjoyed high-level Party support , two pro-democracy scholars theorized that " leftist " leaders find the work " useful " for nudging the [MISC Chinese  ] public away from [MISC Western  ] economic and political models . 
The only contact who warned us that nationalism was on the rise was one of the book 's authors , [PER Wang Xiaodong  ] . 
[PER Young  ] , educated urban [MISC Chinese  ] are " extremely nationalistic , " and the government is wary of them , [PER Wang  ] told [PER PolOff  ] . 
End Summary . 
[ORG UNHAPPY CHINA  ] , HAPPY PUBLISHER ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The book " Unhappy [LOC China  ] " ( [PER Zhongguo Bu  ] Gaoxing ) has been billed as a follow-on to the 1996 book " [LOC China  ] Can Say No . 
" [PER Song Qiang  ] , one of the five authors of Unhappy [LOC China  ] , contributed to the 1996 volume . 
After its release in [LOC China  ] on March 12 , " Unhappy [LOC China  ] " hit the best-sellers list with over 600,000 copies sold the first month , according to dangdang.com ( one of [LOC China  ] 's most popular online bookstores ) . 
An April 13 report in [LOC China  ] Newsweek ( [PER Zhongguo Xinwen Zhoukan  ] ) put the book 's first month 's sales at a more modest 470,000 , though the story notes this was enough to net each of the book 's five authors RMB 1.4 million ( USD 206,000 ) in royalties . 
Two months after its release , however , sales have apparently fallen substantially . 
As of May 11 , the book failed to register in the top 100 best-sellers on amazon.cn . 
[ORG PRC MEDIA LARGELY CRITICAL  ] -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC China  ] 's [MISC English-language  ] media have mostly panned the book . 
On March 25 , the [ORG Xinhua News Agency  ] 's [MISC English-language  ] service issued a report stating the book had " failed to strike a chord among average [MISC Chinese  ] " and was selling " poorly " at [LOC Beijing  ] bookstores . 
Chinese-language media , while still critical of the book 's tone , have been less dismissive of its impact . 
The [ORG China Youth Daily  ] ( [ORG CYD  ] ) , the paper of the [ORG Communist Youth League  ] , published a scathing essay on April 8 that was widely reprinted on the [MISC Internet  ] . 
The [ORG CYD  ] piece drew the distinction between " healthy nationalism , " such as that championed by [PER Sun Yat-sen  ] or [PER Gandhi  ] , to the " narcissistic " ( zilian ) and " bellicose " ( haozhan ) nationalism espoused by the Unhappy [LOC China  ] authors , who brag about [LOC China  ] 's cultural superiority and the need for [LOC China  ] to take over the [ORG United States'  ] role as world leader . 
A March 30 [ORG Xinhua  ] story headlined " Unhappy [LOC China  ] Shakes the [MISC West  ] " noted the great attention the book had received abroad . 
Though the [ORG Xinhua  ] article quoted [MISC Chinese  ] scholars who denounced the book 's extremist rhetoric , it also devoted substantial space to the authors' defense of their work . 
People 's [ORG Daily  ] , the mouthpiece of the [ORG Communist Party Central Committee  ] , has largely ignored Unhappy [LOC China  ] , although on April 8 the paper quoted a scholar as saying that while the views in the book were irrational , [LOC China  ] should allow different voices to be heard . 
At least one [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001378 002 OF 004 paper , the [ORG Beijing Evening News  ] ( [ORG Beijing Wanbao  ] ) , which is published by the [ORG Beijing Municipal Party Committee  ] , has defended Unhappy [LOC China  ] . 
On April 10 the paper ran a blistering editorial accusing [LOC Hong Kong  ] 's [ORG Phoenix Television  ] of pro-Western bias because many of the station 's guests and commentators had denounced the book . 
[MISC INTERNET  ] REACTION LESS HOSTILE ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Though Unhappy [LOC China  ] has met with mostly harsh reviews in the mainstream media , [MISC Internet  ] reaction has been more favorable . 
An on-line opinion poll conducted by the web portal [ORG Sina.com  ] showed that 70 percent of the survey 's 19,000 participants believed Unhappy [LOC China  ] discussed important domestic and international issues and problems " worthy of deep thought . 
" Twenty-one percent described the book as " too extreme " and " opportunistic . 
" FRINGE APPEAL ONLY ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Beijing-based  ] contacts universally criticized the book in discussions with [PER PolOffs  ] . 
Most described it as representing only a " small fringe " of [MISC Chinese  ] society and urged the [ORG USG  ] not to pay too much attention to the tome 's anti-Americanism . 
Some journalist contacts ( ref B ) saw the book as a " joke " whose radical tone was meant to shock and sell books . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that his first complaint about the book was the poor quality of the writing . 
To produce the book , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , the authors merely recorded a series of conversations that were then edited into essays . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said even a bad review by the [ORG Economic Observer  ] would have given the book more publicity than it deserved , so his paper had ignored the book altogether . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) , told [PER PolOff XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that Unhappy [LOC China  ] did not represent mainstream views . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] public was now much more globalized and had a better understanding of the world than was the case in 1996 , when " [LOC China  ] Can Say No " hit the shelves . 
Unhappy [LOC China  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued , thus did not have the same traction as the earlier book . 
Nevertheless , in a nod to the high level of public interest , the [ORG Beijing News  ] had devoted a full page to Unhappy [LOC China  ] in its March 28 edition , including an interview with author [PER Wang Xiaodong  ] and critical commentary by a scholar . 
UNITED [MISC STATES'  ] IMAGE ON THE RISE -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a conversation with [PER PolOff XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , likewise said Unhappy [LOC China  ] represented a minority view and that , at most , " 20 percent " of the [MISC Chinese  ] public subscribed to the kind of nationalism espoused by the authors [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said Unhappy [LOC China  ] was mainly a " commercial exercise , " with the book' extremism merely a " ploy " to boost sales . 
Nevertheless , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , the book did appeal to " less educated [MISC Chinese  ] . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the book had not received support from any individual or faction within the [ORG CCP  ] leadership . 
The book also did not reflect an overall rise in nationalism or anti-Americanism in [LOC China  ] . 
The image of the [LOC United States  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXX  ] said , was actually quite good thanks to President [PER Bush  ] 's attendance at the [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Olympics  ] opening ceremony and the generally warm feeling [MISC Chinese  ] have toward President [PER Obama.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , echoed [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's analysis , saying that the [ORG United States'  ] image on college campuses had improved since the election of President [PER Obama  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said Unhappy [LOC China  ] tapped into the " natural pride " young [MISC Chinese  ] felt at their country 's growing power , which seemed even more evident since the global financial crisis threw most [MISC Western  ] economies into recession . 
When the [LOC United States  ] was booming economically , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued , many [MISC Americans  ] [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001378 003 OF 004 showed the same air of superiority and sense of power hat the authors of Unhappy [LOC China  ] now displayed . 
A TOOL OF LEFTISTS ? ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In contrast , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] saw greater political significance in Unhappy [LOC China  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that given [LOC China  ] 's tight censorship , such a book could not have been published without support from high-level leaders , possibly including President [PER Hu Jintao  ] himself . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that most of the criticism of Unhappy [LOC China  ] had come from urban professionals , but the book did resonate with the wider population . 
Nationalism , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , remained a potent force in [LOC China  ] even though society as a whole was Becoming more mature . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed that left- leaning members of the leadership did not necessarily like or agree with the contents of the book , particularly its foreign policy prescriptions , but saw it as " useful " for pushing the public more to the left and reducing popular support in general for [MISC Western  ] economic and political models . 
[PER Hu Jintao  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued , was not necessarily pushing the book but , due to his background , tended to accept " leftist " ideas as " normal . 
" [PER WANG  ] XIAODONG SPEAKS -------------------- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] AUTHORS' PRO-DEMOCRACY VIEWS CENSORED ------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] repeatedly asserted that nationalists were supportive of democracy and human rights . 
When sovereignty issues were not involved , ordinary [MISC Chinese  ] were not opposed to outside criticism and agreed that human rights should be improved . 
" Only [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001378 004 OF 004 the [MISC Chinese  ] central government is irritated with foreign criticism of [LOC China  ] 's human rights situation . 
" [PER Wang  ] described himself as a " pro-reform intellectual , " saying his contributions to the book " clearly " stated his support for " democracy . 
" Censors , however , deleted most passages in the original draft regarding democracy or involving criticism of Chairman [PER Mao Zedong  ] , [PER Wang  ] claimed . 
Even so , [PER Wang  ] said , overall he had been surprised at how much the censors let through . 
( [PER Note: Song Qiang  ] , in an interview with [ORG Xinhua  ] , also noted that parts of Unhappy [LOC China  ] dealing with domestic politics were cut in order to ensure publication . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In person as in his writing , [PER Wang  ] seemed especially incensed at the behavior of " so-called liberals " in [LOC China  ] who , he asserted , were really " reverse racists . 
" These iberals , [PER Wang  ] said , point to the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] as proof that [MISC Chinese  ] people were inherently mean and wallowed in a self- loathing view of [LOC China  ] 's inferiority compared to the [LOC West  ] . 
Far from secretly supporting the book , [PER Wang  ] asserted , [LOC China  ] 's government had a " hostile reaction " to Unhappy [LOC China  ] , and the [ORG CCP Propaganda Department  ] had ordered official media to criticize it . 
The book , he added , was also " very unpopular at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] . 
" Despite the hostility of the central government , [PER Wang  ] claimed , the book was selling well , especially among military officers , local government cadres , and young people . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The high sales of Unhappy [LOC China  ] show that there is a reservoir of nationalistic sentiment in [LOC China  ] , even though it may not be as large as [PER Wang Xiaodong  ] describes . 
Some of this can be attributed to [LOC China  ] 's education system , which continues to stress the " bullying " and " humiliation " [LOC China  ] endured at the hands of [MISC Western  ] powers in centuries past . 
That the [ORG CCP  ] 's [ORG Propaganda Department  ] encouraged negative press coverage of the book indicates the Party remains wary of nationalism getting out of hand . 
Nationalists , as [PER Wang  ] argued , do not necessarily support the Party . 
However , most of our contacts believe that [MISC Chinese  ] society has , thanks to increasing contact with the outside world , undergone change over the last decade that is causing nationalism to give way to a more positive sense of national pride . 
According to these contacts , the [MISC Chinese  ] who warmly welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] women 's volleyball coach [PER Lang Ping  ] at the 2008 [MISC Olympics  ] ( despite the fact that she previously played and coached for [LOC China  ] -- see ref C ) now greatly outnumber " unhappy " nationalists .
