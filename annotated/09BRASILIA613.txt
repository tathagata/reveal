Reason: 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
The April 14-17 [MISC Latin America Aerospace  ] and Defense ( [ORG LAAD  ] ) show in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] provided evidence that despite the downturns in the economies of [LOC Brazil  ] and its neighbors , defense manufacturers still see opportunities for business . 
As a result of [LOC Brazil  ] 's recently published a new defense strategy committing the government to modernization of the armed forces , notably through a multi-billion dollar purchase of fighter aircraft , [ORG LAAD  ] 09 featured almost fifty percent more exhibitors than the , 07 version and received attention from [LOC Brazil  ] , s leaders , including President [PER Lula  ] . 
In addition to foreign vendors , [ORG LAAD  ] , 09 included displays from a large number of [MISC Brazilian  ] manufacturers , and [PER Lula  ] and Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] devoted significant portions of their visits to the show to promoting [MISC Brazilian  ] business . 
[LOC U.S.  ] firms participating in the show expressed concern that the [ORG USG  ] overcome GOB perceptions that the [LOC U.S.  ] is reluctant to transfer technology and showed appreciation for [ORG USG  ] support to [LOC U.S.  ] exports . 
The competition for [LOC Brazil  ] , s next generation fighter ( known locally as the [ORG FX2  ] ) was the big story of the show , with [ORG Boeing  ] receiving positive coverage for its offer of the [ORG F18 Super Hornet  ] , although doubts remained about [ORG USG  ] commitment to the program . 
Its competitors , [LOC France  ] , s [ORG Dassault  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] , s [ORG Saab  ] , made energetic efforts to promote their aircraft . 
The [MISC French  ] ( incorrectly ) hyped their entry , s " one hundred per cent " [MISC French  ] content as an advantage of their entry . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG LAAD  ] , 09 featured over 100 exhibitors showcasing aerospace , defense and security products . 
While much of the focus was on big ticket items such as aircraft and naval systems , there was also considerable interest in police equipment , firearms and surveillance systems . 
Organizers estimated that the show was fifty percent larger than that of two years ago . 
The major reason for the increased interest was the perception that [LOC Brazil  ] , the region , s largest economy , will be increasing defense spending as it modernizes its armed forces . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] exhibitors occupied approximately twenty percent of the exhibit space , promoting sales of vehicles , aircraft , weapons and ammunition . 
Both President [PER Lula  ] and Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] made it a priority of their visits to [ORG LAAD  ] to highlight the [MISC Brazilian  ] exhibitors . 
The highlight of the show for the [MISC Brazilian  ] press was that [PER Jobim  ] signed an agreement with [ORG Embraer  ] for the eventual purchase of [LOC C390  ] transport aircraft , ostensibly to replace [LOC Brazil  ] , s [MISC C130  ] fleet . 
This focus on [MISC Brazilian  ] business was consistent with the recommendations of the December 2008 Defense Strategy Document which stated that [MISC Brazilian  ] procurement should be from [MISC Brazilian  ] manufacturers and that purchase of military items from foreign sources would only be justified to obtain technology that would allow for eventual domestic production. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the hype for products made in [LOC Brazil  ] , much of the real attention at the show was on [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] products . 
Exhibitors from [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC UK  ] made a splash with impressive displays ( and free espresso from the [MISC Italians  ] ) as did an extensive [MISC Israeli  ] area . 
[LOC U.S.  ] participants included [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] , [ORG Boeing  ] , [ORG Northrup Grumman  ] , [ORG Hughes  ] , [ORG Raytheon  ] and many smaller firms . 
[ORG Mission Brazil  ] officers spent much of the four day show meeting with the [LOC U.S.  ] participants to discuss doing business with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The most common concern of the [LOC U.S.  ] forms was whether the slowdown in [LOC Brazil  ] , s economy would affect defense modernization plans . 
Most believed that while the scope of some projects might be reduced , overall there would be significantly more funding for defense projects than in the past . 
[LOC U.S.  ] businesses also echoed [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns that restrictive [ORG USG  ] export control policies could put them at a disadvantage to foreign competitors . 
[ORG Mission  ] members pointed out that there were no specific export restrictions toward [LOC Brazil  ] and recent approvals of technology for the [ORG FX2  ] competition could provide skeptical [MISC Brazilians  ] an example that [LOC U.S.  ] export controls , though rigorous , will not block business with our partners . 
Several [LOC U.S.  ] exhibitors also commented that they had heard from [MISC Brazilian  ] partners that [LOC Brazil  ] is predisposed to purchase [MISC French  ] products because of the personal friendship between Presidents [PER Lula  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
The presence of [ORG Mission  ] personnel from [LOC FCS  ] , [LOC MLO  ] , [LOC DAO  ] and State elicited a strongly positive response from [LOC U.S.  ] participants , as did Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] , s remarks at the [ORG Foreign Commercial Service  ] 's April 14 breakfast for [LOC U.S.  ] businesses . 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR [ORG U.S. BUSINESS  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000613 002 OF 002 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC U.S.  ] firms saw several strong opportunities to make sales to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
As noted in paragraph 2 , the [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] made a splash by announcing a deal with [ORG Embraer  ] for transport aircraft . 
[ORG Lockheed  ] representatives , however , were quick to point out that developing a cost effective replacement for the [MISC C130  ] has not been easy , citing [ORG EADS  ] , difficulties . 
Furthermore , the proposed [ORG Embraer  ] transport will have difficulty operating on some of [LOC Brazil  ] , s more remote airfields , requiring either large expenditures for upgrades or the retention of the more versatile [MISC C130  ] . 
[ORG Raytheon  ] saw the potential for providing electronics systems to the [MISC Brazilian  ] navy as part of a deal with [MISC Korean  ] shipbuilders to construct new coastal patrol vessels in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Hughes  ] conducted discussions with the [MISC Brazilian  ] army on a field communications system that will enhance security and reliability , while allowing for interoperability with allied forces . 
[ORG Lockheed  ] also saw potential for sales of electronic equipment to [LOC Brazil  ] as part of its purchase of four [MISC French-made  ] submarines. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The most important single upcoming purchase for [LOC Brazil  ] will be the next generation fighter . 
The centerpiece of [ORG Boeing  ] , s exhibit was a simulator for the [ORG Super Hornet  ] that allowed [MISC Brazilian  ] pilots and aviation fans some hands on experience of operating the aircraft . 
[ORG Boeing  ] Vice President [PER Robert Gower  ] and SOUTHCOM Deputy Commander Lt. Gen. [PER Glenn Spears  ] held a joint press conference in which [PER Gower  ] underlined the industrial partnership [ORG Boeing  ] hopes told build in [LOC Brazil  ] , and [PER Spears  ] confirmed that the [LOC U.S.  ] has approved relevant transfers of technology . 
While the press conference produced a good response , the perception among [MISC Brazilian  ] remains that the [ORG Super Hornet  ] trails in the competition , in part because [ORG Boeing  ] is relying on the plane , s superior capabilities to sell itself and in part because of the lower level of [LOC U.S.  ] government engagement when compared to its competitors , particularly [LOC France  ] . 
This has made [ORG USG  ] efforts to assure the [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] that tech transfers will be made more difficult. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The other [ORG FX2  ] finalists , [ORG Dassault  ] and [ORG Saab  ] , pulled out all the stops to sell their aircraft . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] case rested on the fact that they are submitting a new version of the [MISC Gripen  ] , giving [MISC Brazilian  ] firms the opportunity to participate in almost all areas of production from the beginning . 
[ORG Saab  ] also focused on the positive capabilities of its entry , including the ability to use short runways as a selling point , overlooking the [MISC Gripen  ] , s overall less capable performance . 
The [MISC Swedes  ] have also begun an advertising campaign touting [LOC Sweden  ] as the " independent choice , " seeking to appeal to [MISC Brazilian  ] aspirations to be a military power free from reliance on allied militaries . 
The [MISC French  ] display was among the largest at the show , but unlike [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG Saab  ] , focused on a single product: the [MISC Rafale  ] fighter . 
Glossy displays on the aircraft , s capabilities surrounded a model of the [MISC Rafale  ] that was bigger than some of the UAVs on display in other exhibits . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] members attending and at least two journalists speaking with [ORG Mission  ] members reported that the [MISC French  ] were portraying the [MISC Rafale  ] as [LOC Brazil  ] , s safest choice because it had 100 per cent [MISC French  ] content ( and therefore would be presumably free of meddlesome [LOC U.S.  ] export controls ) . 
According to [ORG Mission  ] information , this is untrue and all three competitors will be subject to the [ORG ITAR  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] also presented a display on the [LOC SU35  ] , for which [MISC Russian  ] officials have appealed to [PER MOD Jobim  ] for reinstatement into the [ORG FX2  ] competition . 
There was no indication , however , from the [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] that the [MISC Russians  ] would be reconsidered .
