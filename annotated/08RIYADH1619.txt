( S ) SUMMARY . 
The [ORG Joint Commssion on Critical Infrastructure Protection  ] and [ORG Border Security  ] ( [ORG JCCIP  ] ) initiative in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] made significant progress this week . 
On October 27 , a [ORG Department of Energy  ] delegation led by [ORG DOE  ] DAS Wm . 
[PER Bryan  ] , with [ORG AmEmbassy Riyadh  ] Charge’ d’Affaires in attendance , presented a three-hour [ORG Vulnerability Assessment  ] ( [ORG VA  ] ) of the [LOC Abqaiq  ] oil facility ( Reftel A ) to [MISC Saudi  ] Ministry of Interior senior-level and working staff , which included a 40-minute briefing/discussion with Assistant Minister for [ORG National Security Affairs  ] Prince [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Naif  ] ( [ORG MBN  ] ) . 
DOE’s recommendations were enthusiastically accepted by [ORG MBN  ] , with further [ORG JCCIP  ] work agreed to . 
Concurrent with the [ORG VA  ] presentation , the deployed [ORG CENTCOM  ] representative in [LOC Riyadh  ] presented the draft Letter of Request ( LOR ) to [ORG MBN  ] to establish the Office of the [MISC Program Manager - Facilities Security Force  ] ( [MISC OPM-FSF  ] ) , which will be responsible to train and equip the [MISC Saudi  ] security forces being formed to protect [MISC Saudi  ] energy production facilities , desalination plants and future civil nuclear reactors . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] remain highly concerned about the vulnerability of their energy production facilities and reaffirmed their strong desire for a long-term USG commitment to implement the [ORG JCCIP  ] agreement . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------------- [ORG FULL  ] SPEED AHEAD ON ASSESSMENTS ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [ORG DOE  ] presented a two-day , thorough , highly-technical evaluation of [MISC Abqaiq’s  ] security capability to [ORG MOI  ] , [ORG FSF  ] and [ORG ARAMCO  ] officials on Oct. 27 and 28 , with the introductory briefing consisting of a three-hour presentation . 
The conclusion is that the [LOC Abqaiq  ] facility’s safety standards are world-class and its current security measures would counter a repeat of the Feb. 2006 failed [ORG Al Qaeda  ] VBIED attack , but [LOC Abqaiq  ] remains highly vulnerable to other types of sophisticated terrorist attacks . 
[ORG DOE  ] provided concrete steps for the [MISC Saudis  ] to enhance and harden [MISC Abqaiq’s  ] security architecture. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG MBN  ] was impressed with DOE’s [LOC Abqaiq  ] [ORG VA  ] and expressed his appreciation for [MISC DOE’s  ] work . 
He ordered his staff to immediately implement DOE’s recommendations to improve [MISC Abqaiq’s  ] security and requested [ORG DOE  ] to perform further [ORG VAs  ] . 
The [LOC Ras Tannurah  ] oil facility was named as the next site to be assessed , with its [ORG VA  ] to be conducted as soon as possible . 
It was agreed [ORG DOE  ] would establish three [ORG VA  ] teams dedicated solely to evaluating [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s critical infrastructure sites , which number approximately 100 . 
These [ORG DOE  ] teams would be joined by [ORG MOI  ] members who would learn the necessary skill sets from [ORG DOE  ] to then perform their own individual [ORG VAs  ] of sites . 
The goal would be [ORG MOI  ] to eventually take the lead in [ORG VAs  ] of all remaining sites , with [ORG DOE  ] supporting the [ORG MOI  ] [ORG VA  ] teams . 
This would maximize the number of sites able to be assessed in the shortest time period . 
[ORG DOE  ] also invited [ORG MOI  ] , [ORG ARAMCO  ] and [ORG CENTCOM  ] to join them at [ORG Sandia Labs  ] to wrap up the [LOC Abqaiq  ] assessment and demonstrate the models used in formulating their recommendations . 
This visit is expected to [LOC RIYADH  ] 00001619 002.2 OF 003 be conducted by the end of 2008. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) It was noted during the presentation that the [ORG ARAMCO  ] officials were uneasy with [ORG MOI  ] encroaching onto their territory . 
[ORG ARAMCO  ] expressed concern that “Too much security will make it too hard for us ( [ORG ARAMCO  ] ) to do our jobs in producing oil.” While it was telling to see firsthand some the interagency disputes within the SAG , an [ORG MOI  ] official in a sidebar confided in us that ARAMCO’s concerns would be addressed , but that [ORG MBN  ] , who reportedly has the final say in the protection of [MISC Saudi  ] critical infrastructure , would not allow [MISC Saudi  ] oil facilities to be left vulnerable , regardless of ARAMCO’s complaints. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) This same [ORG MOI  ] official mentioned that the protection of [MISC Saudi  ] critical infrastructure is expected to eventually be 25% of [LOC MOI’s  ] budget . 
[LOC MOI’s  ] current annual budget is approx . 
[ORG USD  ] 1 billion . 
The protection of [MISC Saudi  ] critical infrastructure will likely lead to a significant increase in [LOC MOI’s  ] budget as the [ORG FSF  ] alone will be 35,000 strong , minimum , with an additional 20 per cent more forces for port and border security . 
DOE’s security projects and future to-be-determined [ORG JCCIP  ] programs with other USG agencies will add even more to [LOC MOI’s  ] budget requirements. -------------- [MISC OPM-FSF  ] STARTS -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) The draft LOR for [MISC OPM-FSF  ] prepared by [ORG CENTCOM  ] was presented to [ORG MBN  ] . 
This draft explicitly lays out on one page the exact wording for the [MISC SAG’s  ] formal request to the USG to establish [MISC OPM-FSF  ] . 
[ORG MBN  ] directed his staff to prepare such a letter for his signature . 
Once we receive this letter , [ORG CENTCOM  ] will then respond with a Letter of Acceptance ( [ORG LOA  ] ) which will allow [ORG CENTCOM  ] to begin building up [MISC OPM-FSF’s  ] personnel and equipment structure . 
[ORG MOI  ] indicated they plan to present the formal [MISC Saudi  ] LOR to GEN [PER Petraeus  ] when he visits the [LOC Kingdom  ] , currently scheduled for Nov. 8. -------------------- [ORG JOINT WORKING GROUPS  ] -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) A related discussion item was the role of the [ORG Joint Working Groups  ] ( [ORG JWG  ] ) . 
It was previously established there would be three JWG: [ORG FSF  ] , [ORG Industrial Security and Internal Security  ] ( Reftel B ) . 
During our recent meetings , it was clarified and agreed to that “Joint” will refer to [MISC USG-SAG  ] only , not inter-agency . 
When these working groups meet , it will be a single USG voice in dialogue with a single SAG voice . 
Inter-agency USG discussions will take place at the [ORG JCCIP  ] Cell in [LOC Riyadh  ] or in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) DAS [PER Bryan  ] , in discussions with [ORG MOI  ] officials , requested clarification on MOI’s view and scope of the [ORG Industrial Security Joint Working Group  ] . 
The “Industry” of focus is the oil industry and all other industries that support the oil sector . 
This also includes interdependencies on other utilities , in particular electricity and water . 
This will enable [ORG DOE  ] to better perform the system level analysis as opposed to individual site assessments . 
Additionally , this insight enables [ORG DOE  ] to staff the [ORG Industrial Security JWG  ] with appropriate USG representation. ----------------------------- [LOC RIYADH  ] 00001619 003.2 OF 003 “WE MUST PROTECT IT TOGETHER” ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) In a private meeting between [ORG MBN  ] and the [MISC Charge’  ] , [ORG MBN  ] conveyed the [MISC SAG’s  ] , and his personal , sense of urgency to move forward as quickly as possible to enhance the protection of [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s critical infrastructure with the priority being its energy production sites . 
[ORG MBN  ] related how his grandfather , [PER King Abdulaziz  ] , had the vision of forming a lasting strategic partnership with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG MBN  ] stressed he shared this vision , and wants the USG’s help to protect [MISC Saudi  ] critical infrastructure . 
He commented that neither the [LOC Kingdom  ] nor the [LOC U.S.  ] would be comfortable with the “French or [MISC Russians”  ] involved in protecting [MISC Saudi  ] oil facilities. “We built [ORG ARAMCO  ] together , we must protect it together.” [ORG MBN  ] also confirmed his travel dates to [LOC Washington  ] will be Nov. 5 to 7. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [ORG MOI  ] officials queried us on the exact date U/S Wm . 
[PER Burns  ] , P , would travel to the [LOC Kingdom  ] for the meeting of the [ORG Joint Commission  ] on [ORG Critical Infrastructure Protection and Border Security  ] . 
The SAG expects it to be in mid-December after the Eid al-Adha ( set to end Dec. 12 ) , and request confirmation as soon as possible of [MISC P’s  ] exact travel date so they can prepare the appropriate agenda . 
Post requests the [MISC Department’s  ] confirmation of [MISC P’s  ] exact travel dates to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] for the next [ORG JCCIP.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) The [MISC Saudis  ] now feel energized by DOE’s [ORG VA  ] , DOE’s subsequent proposals and CENTCOM’s assistance in establishing [MISC OPM-FSF  ] . 
Likewise , they recognize many of their energy facilities remain at risk from [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and other terrorists who seek to disrupt the global economy , and vigorously urge we continue assisting them to counter this threat .
