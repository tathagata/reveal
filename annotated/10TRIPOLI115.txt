( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In a February 9 meeting with the Ambassador , the head of [MISC Libya’s  ] [MISC Scud B  ] destruction program , General [PER Ahmed Azwai  ] , insisted that the [ORG USG  ] was mostly responsible for [MISC Libya’s  ] delayed fulfillment of [MISC Scud B  ] destruction commitments . 
[PER Azwai  ] blamed the [ORG USG  ] for hampering [MISC Libyan  ] efforts to find a [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG MTCR  ] ) -compliant alternative weapons system to replace its [MISC Scud B  ] stock and refused to discuss a destruction timeline until [LOC Libya  ] acquires a replacement system . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] passionately believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] committed to assisting in the search for an alternative weapons system , and they want the [LOC U.S.  ] to fulfill that commitment . 
[PER Azwai  ] indicated that [LOC Libya  ] still wants to purchase the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Iskander  ] missile that [LOC Libya  ] originally proposed ( ideally at the originally stipulated purchase price ) , but said that it is up to the [LOC U.S.  ] to decide whether that is acceptable -- if not , then he believes the [LOC U.S.  ] should find an acceptable alternative . 
[PER Azwai  ] made no mention of the [MISC French  ] [ORG Scalp  ] missile or any other proposed alternatives during the meeting , suggesting that the [ORG Scalp  ] proposal may have been an independent move by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi . 
[PER Azwai  ] requested [LOC U.S.  ] support for [MISC Libya’s  ] bid for [ORG MTCR  ] membership .

AZWAI: THE [LOC U.S.  ] COMMITED TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM FOR [LOC LIBYA  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Ahmed Azwai  ] , head of [MISC Libya’s  ] [MISC Scud B  ] destruction program , met with the Ambassador , accompanied by Pol/Econ Chief , on February 9 to reiterate [MISC Libya’s  ] expectations that the [ORG USG  ] identify a suitable alternative to the [MISC Scud B  ] system . 
( Note: The meeting was scheduled in response to a September 2009 Embassy request for a status update on [LOC Libya’s MTCR-related  ] commitments . 
End note . 
) [PER Azwai  ] , joined by [MISC Tajuri  ] al-Shiradi of the [ORG MFA’s International Organizations  ] office , as well as [ORG Libya’s “Rocket Committee  ] , ” reviewed the history of [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] negotiations on the elimination of [MISC Libya’s Scud  ] Bs and insisted that the 2004 trilateral agreement included “promises by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] to find a replacement for the [MISC Scud B  ] system.” Referencing an [MISC English  ] language version of the agreement that [PER Azwai  ] provided , the Ambassador explained that the wording did not commit the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC UK  ] to find a replacement system , but noted that we had in fact suggested alternative missile systems in the past , which [LOC Libya  ] refused. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Azwai  ] insisted that the language of the agreement obligates the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] to help [LOC Libya  ] find a suitable replacement system . 
[PER Azwai  ] argued that instead of helping [LOC Libya  ] fulfill its commitments , the [LOC U.S.  ] had thrown obstacles in [MISC Libya’s  ] way , first by initially rejecting [MISC Libya’s  ] request to purchase [ORG Iskander  ] missiles from [LOC Russia  ] and then by delaying the sale by stalling the approval process . 
[PER Azwai  ] noted that [LOC Libya  ] had already signed a contract with [LOC Russia  ] to purchase the [ORG Iskander  ] missiles when the [LOC U.S.  ] objected ( he asserted that the [LOC UK  ] had assented to the sale ) . “The process dragged on for two years , and we could not wait that long~and now , we still do not have an acceptable alternative , ” he said . 
According to [PER Azwai  ] , the two other systems the [LOC U.S.  ] suggested -- one from [LOC Ukraine  ] and another from [LOC Russia  ] -- were both “unacceptable alternatives” due to the technical and range specifications needed to guarantee [MISC Libya’s  ] national security. “We must have a replacement system , ” he stated. “I will not allow 12,000 [MISC Libyan  ] soldiers to remain unarmed and vulnerable . 
If I give up their weapons before I have a replacement , they will turn on me.” He argued that [LOC Libya  ] had already given up some of its rocket systems and codes and did not intend to give up any more until it could replace its current stock . 
[ORG ISKANDER  ] STILL BEST ALTERNATIVE TO [MISC LIBYAN  ] [MISC SCUD B  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While [PER Azwai  ] told the Ambassador that [LOC Libya  ] was “actively looking” for an alternative system , he believes that the [ORG Iskander  ] system originally proposed by the [MISC Libyan  ] side is still the best alternative to [MISC Libya’s Scud  ] Bs . 
However , according to the [ORG Rockets Committee  ] , the price of that system has increased by one hundred percent . 
[PER Azwai  ] expressed [MISC Libya’s  ] continued desire to purchase the [ORG Iskander  ] missile at a lower price than that which the [MISC Russians  ] were currently offering , and he sought [LOC U.S.  ] approval for such a purchase. “In the beginning , ” he commented , “we were hoping for a [LOC U.S.  ] system , but you said there was none.” He continued that “the only friend for [LOC Libya  ] is [LOC Russia  ] on [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000115 002.2 OF 002 weapons sales.” ( [PER Azwai  ] did not mention the [MISC French  ] [ORG Scalp  ] system that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi’s staff raised with Emboffs in November 2009 , suggesting that the proposal may have been an independent move by [PER Saif  ] . 
) [PER Azwai  ] emphasized that he expected the [LOC U.S.  ] to suggest viable alternatives , and for those suggestions to be offered either in writing or in the context of another meeting with him. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador asked whether [LOC Libya  ] had begun to develop a timeline for the destruction of its [MISC Scud B  ] missiles and suggested that a [LOC U.S.  ] technical team come to [LOC Tripoli  ] to discuss destruction plans . 
Per reftel guidance , the Ambassador offered that the [ORG USG  ] could support [MISC Libya’s  ] [MISC Scud B  ] destruction with technical and financial assistance . 
Initially [PER Azwai  ] refused to discuss destruction plans until an alternative system has been identified , but as the Ambassador reiterated his points , [PER Azwai  ] asked that the [ORG Rocket Committee  ] make note of the [LOC U.S.  ] offer . 
He asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] would fund destruction “one hundred percent , ” or partially , snidely remarking that “we [MISC Libyans  ] need to be careful about what the [MISC American  ] offers really mean.” He underscored that [LOC Libya  ] “will not think about destruction until you [ the [LOC U.S  ] . 
] fulfill your commitment.” [PER Azwai  ] said that he would not be willing to discuss destruction until after a contract for a replacement system was signed . 
Furthermore , since the [MISC Libyans  ] perceive the delays in meeting [MISC Libya’s  ] [ORG MTCR  ] commitments as rooted in [LOC U.S.  ] inaction on the issue , [PER Azwai  ] demanded that [LOC Libya  ] receive an extension on its MTCR-commitment deadline . 
[MISC LIBYA’S  ] BID FOR [ORG MTCR  ] MEMBERSHIP <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Azwai  ] further complained that the [LOC United States  ] had not supported [MISC Libya’s  ] recent bids to become a full [ORG MTCR  ] member . 
Members of the [ORG Rocket Committee  ] specified that they had requested support from several embassies in [LOC Libya  ] , with the exception of the [LOC United States  ] , but had also requested support in [LOC Paris  ] , at the most recent [ORG MTCR  ] meetings . 
[PER Azwai  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] had fulfilled the stipulations the [ORG MTCR  ] committee required for membership , including adopting new legislation , but still could not obtain full membership . 
He inferred that the [LOC U.S.  ] was part of the reason Libya’s membership was blocked . 
The Ambassador highlighted that the [ORG USG  ] could not act on a request that was not directly raised with us and advised the [ORG Rocket Committee  ] to send an official request for [LOC U.S.  ] support of [MISC Libya’s  ] membership in order for it to be considered in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Azwai  ] agreed to do so . 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S/NF ) This meeting revealed what appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding regarding the terms and obligations of the involved parties of the 2004 trilateral [MISC Scud B  ] disposition agreement . 
[PER Azwai  ] was adamant that the [LOC U.S.  ] was obliged to help [LOC Libya  ] identify a [MISC Scud B  ] replacement system and made it clear that , unless we do , he has no intention of moving forward on destruction . 
It is unclear whether Azwai’s position is based on a concrete [MISC Libyan  ] legal interpretation of the 2004 agreement or a purely political assessment that [LOC Libya  ] has gotten less than it was promised during the 2003-2004 negotiations regarding its WMD programs . 
We have been hearing the latter with increasing frequency from the highest levels of the [MISC Libyan  ] government , including [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
It is clear that further discussions -- either at the expert or political level -- will be required in order to make progress on the replacement and destruction issues . 
The [MISC Department’s  ] guidance on next steps on these issues , as well as Libya’s [ORG MTCR  ] membership bid , is requested .
