( C ) Summary: [PER Francois Hollande  ] , First Secretary of [LOC France  ] 's deeply fragmented [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) , on June 30 presented his take on a variety of [MISC French  ] , [ORG EU  ] and foreign policy issues to an informal " Circle of [MISC Ambassadors  ] " group , attended by Charge . 
[PER Hollande  ] 's analysis impressed participants as sound and insightful . 
His lack of a clear program of action to contend with [MISC French  ] socio-economic difficulties , however , left his audience asking if he is capable of projecting himself as a candidate with a clear message and a winning program . 
On display were both [PER Hollande  ] 's questionable viability as a candidate in the 2007 elections and the [ORG PS  ] 's lack of unity and coherent vision . 
End Summary . 
[ORG EU  ] Constitution and the [ORG PS  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC France  ] 's [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) hosted , for the first time , a " Circle of [MISC Ambassadors  ] " group to hear party First Secretary [PER Francois Hollande  ] give an overview of key issues SIPDIS and answer participants' questions . 
While his general presentation was unremarkable , [PER Hollande  ] proved more insightful in answering questions . 
Addressing the failed [ORG EU  ] Constitutional referendum , [PER Hollande  ] noted there were a number of reasons for the 'no' outcome , including the need for a collective effort earlier in the campaign to better explain the content of the treaty . 
Part of the problem , [PER Hollande  ] reasoned , was in the prevailing view of the [ORG EU  ] ; whereas it had previously been seen as a protective institution , issues such as the [PER Bolkestein  ] proposal to create a single services market and " liberal " ( free-market ) labor laws have sparked fear and concern . 
[PER Hollande  ] also saw rising nationalism as a factor . 
Rather than seeing the [ORG EU  ] as the guarantor of peace and stability , citizens are asking what is in it for them . 
[PER Hollande  ] expressed his disappointment in the lack of discipline within the [ORG PS  ] in support of the [MISC Constitution  ] adding that just as lack of party discipline had had consequences for the future of [LOC Europe  ] , it should also have consequences for those party members who broke ranks . 
The split within the Socialists over the [ORG EU  ] Constitution was a key factor in its defeat , according to [PER Hollande  ] . 
The divide legitimized both the [ORG PS  ] 'yes' and 'no' camps , as supporters of either could point to a [ORG PS  ] leader championing their cause . 
[PER Hollande  ] took a swipe at [ORG PS  ] no-camp leader [PER Laurent Fabius  ] , stating that his support of the 'no' was not based on the merits of the [MISC Constitution  ] , but on " ulterior motives " -- that is , [PER Fabius  ] 's ambition to make himself the [ORG PS  ] candidate in the 2007 presidential election . 
[PER Hollande  ] announced that the [ORG PS  ] would decide on its candidate for 2007 at the party congress in mid-November , and added that party members who , afterwards , presented themselves as an alternative candidate would be expelled from the party . 
Future of the [ORG EU  ] ---------------- 3. . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) All elections within [LOC Europe  ] have an [ORG EU  ] dimension , according to [PER Hollande  ] , who added that domestic and [ORG EU  ] policy were becoming difficult to separate . 
[PER Hollande  ] noted that , over the medium-to-long term , politics in [MISC European  ] countries tend towards regular alternation in power between center-left and center-right -- which should currently favor the center-left , as many [MISC European  ] countries ( among them [LOC France  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and [LOC Italy  ] ) are currently led by the center-right . 
[PER Hollande  ] said that the center-left parties of [LOC Europe  ] needed to work together and develop a coordinated , common approach . 
[PER Hollande  ] also remarked that [LOC Europe  ] was facing a crisis of confidence and identity . 
The [MISC French  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] rejections of the [ORG EU  ] [MISC Constitution  ] laid bare this crisis in [LOC Europe  ] and would have the effect of prolonging it . 
First among the concerns was the issue of [ORG EU  ] borders . 
An EU-wide debate was necessary to discuss how big the [ORG EU  ] should become and what its purpose should be . 
These comments struck many as intimating re-consideration by the [ORG PS  ] of its position favoring [LOC Turkey  ] 's inclusion in the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Hollande  ] also noted that the [ORG EU  ] shouldn't wait for any new constitutional initiatives to secure several essential goals , such as a common foreign minister and voting weights and other decision-making changes . 
[MISC French  ] Politics and 2007 Presidential Race ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hollande  ] asserted that victory in the presidential election in 2007 would go to the party that provides solutions to the problems of [LOC France  ] . 
If the Socialists can't engender confidence , he stated , they risk resorting to populism and the " us against them " mentality that showed itself during the [ORG EU  ] Constitutional debate in the guise of the [MISC Polish  ] plumber . 
[PER Hollande  ] stated that reforms in [LOC France  ] were difficult to effect and often the result of legislation imposed by the majority party rather than compromise among stakeholders -- a system [PER Hollande  ] characterized as ineffective . 
[PER Hollande  ] cited job creation as a most urgent challenge facing [LOC France  ] , and pointed out that 70 percent of jobs in [LOC France  ] are short term or of a fixed duration . 
( Note . 
This is largely a result of the [MISC French  ] employment laws that make it inordinately difficult to fire full-time employees . 
End Note . 
) [PER Hollande  ] observed that the vaunted " [MISC French  ] social model " ( often invoked by President [ORG Chirac  ] ) was a recent idea , and added that he did not know what it meant . 
The [ORG PS  ] , he stated , speaks of an [ORG EU  ] social model , but the current [MISC French  ] government touts a model no one wants to follow. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hollande  ] made several predictions regarding the 2007 presidential elections , notably that [ORG Chirac  ] would not be a candidate . 
[ORG Sarkozy  ] would leave the government before the elections , likely under protest so he could criticize [ORG Chirac  ] and [ORG Villepin  ] . 
The Socialists would reunify before 2007 , unless an opposition candidate rose to challenge the official flag-bearer . 
[PER Hollande  ] foresaw the [ORG UMP  ] candidate making the second round of elections , with the [ORG PS  ] candidate representing the left . 
Ultimately , [PER Hollande  ] reiterated , the winner would be the candidate offering the most credible promise of change . 
( Paradoxically , his presentation inspired no such impression . 
) [LOC Asia  ] and [LOC Africa  ] --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Describing [LOC Asia  ] as a dynamic , competitive , and important region , [PER Hollande  ] similarly noted that it was causing economic unease in [LOC France  ] . 
It was not constructive to simply tell people to work harder , he said . 
[PER Hollande  ] stated that regulations were needed to protect economic interests , but was careful to underline that he did not support protectionism , just the guarantee that all parties should play by the same rules . 
Touching briefly on [LOC Africa  ] , [PER Hollande  ] remarked that [LOC France  ] had a unique responsibility to the continent . 
The [ORG EU  ] is seen as the panacea to [MISC African  ] problems and aid to [LOC Africa  ] should be increased , he added . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hollande  ] is right that the next President of [LOC France  ] is likely to be the candidate who offers the most credible promise of change . 
[PER Hollande  ] , however , seems unlikely to be that candidate . 
[PER Hollande  ] does not project as a leader implementing a clear program of action . 
He has often been criticized for his diffidence and lack of " political punch . 
" True to that image , he did not demonstrate the confidence or talent for galvanizing others to action that voters look for in a candidate . 
His comments on issues focused on general diagnoses , not concrete remedies . 
His vision for the party made the Socialists appear adrift . 
Interestingly , every positive example of Socialist leadership that [PER Hollande  ] outlined came under [ORG Jospin  ] , which raises the question as to whether [PER Hollande  ] is preparing [ORG Jospin  ] 's return , even if unconsciously .
