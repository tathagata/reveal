Godfrey  ] , [ORG A/DCM  ] , Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a visit to [LOC Cairo  ] January 1 , Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] reportedly discussed his recent trip to [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] , [LOC Darfur  ] , the repatriation of 24 [MISC Egyptians  ] currently on death row in [LOC Libya  ] , and the possibility that he may seek to travel to [LOC New York  ] to attend a session of the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] . 
End summary . 
[PER QADHAFI  ] SEES EUROPEAN COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AS POLITICAL SYMBOLS 2 . 
( C ) [MISC Egyptian  ] Charge d'Affaires [PER Ahmed Abdel-Halim  ] told [ORG A/DCM  ] January 6 that al-Qadhafi 's visit was overdue , noting that President [PER Mubarak  ] had visited [LOC Libya  ] three times in 2007 ( in January , May and September ) and three times in 2006 . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] gave [PER Mubarak  ] a readout on his visits to [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] in December . 
[PER Abdel-Halim  ] 's information was that [PER Qadhafi  ] emphasized the importance of commercial contracts and agreements concluded during the trip , stressing their value as a tangible symbol of [LOC Libya  ] 's reintegration into the international community after the lifting of sanctions and removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism . 
[LOC DARFUR  ] - INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT HINDERS RATHER THAN HELPS 3 . 
( C ) [PER Mubarak  ] and [PER Qadhafi  ] also discussed the situation in [LOC Darfur  ] at length . 
Reading from an [MISC Egyptian  ] MFA report on the trip , [PER Abdel-Halim  ] said [PER Mubarak  ] had tried to persuade al-Qadhafi that the latter 's recent remarks criticizing the " internationalization " of the conflict ( a reference to external mediation and deployment of the hybrid [MISC AU-UN  ] peacekeeping force ) were not helpful . 
Al-Qadhafi apparently maintained his argument that the conflict was " merely tribal " and could be resolved more quickly absent international mediation . 
[PER Mubarak  ] and al-Qadhafi reviewed 1,200 [MISC Egyptian  ] troops set to deploy to [LOC Darfur  ] to join the [MISC AU-UN  ] hybrid peacekeeping force . 
[ORG GOL  ] DRAGS FEET ON REPATRIATING [MISC EGYPTIAN  ] PRISONERS 4 . 
( C ) [PER Mubarak  ] asked that 24 [MISC Egyptians  ] sentenced to death by [MISC Libyan  ] courts for various crimes be repatriated to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Abdel-Halim  ] explained that families of the victims of crimes perpetrated by the 24 had accepted " blood money " . 
Under [MISC Libyan  ] law , their death penalty sentences were commuted to 25-year prison sentences ; [MISC Egyptian-Libyan  ] bilateral legal cooperation agreements provided for the return of such prisoners to their home country to serve out their sentences , but the [ORG GOL  ] had balked at effecting their transfer . 
[PER Abdel-Halim  ] said the issue has been widely covered in [MISC Egyptian  ] press and is seen by the [ORG GOL  ] as a bilateral irritant . 
[PER Mubarak  ] raised it during his September 2007 visit to [LOC Libya  ] and was assured that the [ORG GOL  ] would follow up ; however , [PER Qadhafi  ] denied knowledge of the issue during his recent trip and asked for more time to " study " it , angering [PER Mubarak  ] . 
[PER Abdel-Halim  ] noted the [ORG GOE  ] 's irritation with increased [MISC Libyan  ] " arrogance " in bilateral dealings , which it attributes to increased oil prices and the [ORG GOL  ] 's perception that its hand has been strengthened . 
BROTHER LEADER TO VISIT THE BIG APPLE ? 5 . 
( C ) Reading again from a report from [LOC Cairo  ] , [PER Abdel-Halim  ] said [PER Mubarak  ] and al-Qadhafi discussed [ORG UNSC  ] issues , particularly a possible third sanctions resolution against [LOC Iran  ] ( NFI ) . 
According to [PER Abdel-Halim  ] , al-Qadhafi told [PER Mubarak  ] he " may " seek to travel to [LOC New York  ] this month to attend sessions of the [ORG UNSC  ] during [LOC Libya  ] 's month-long presidency . 
Post understands from Embassy [LOC Cairo  ] that [ORG Arab League Chief  ] of Staff [PER Hisham Yousef  ] told [PER Poloff  ] there that [ORG AL SYG Moussa  ] urged al-Qadhafi in their meeting on January 1 to use [LOC Libya  ] 's seat on the [ORG UNSC  ] to advocate for and represent broader [MISC Arab  ] interests in the way [LOC Qatar  ] had successfully done . 
[PER Hisham  ] expressed doubt that [LOC Libya  ] would prove to be as dependable as [LOC Qatar  ] in this regard . 
( Note: Consistent with [PER Qadhafi  ] 's shift of attention from [MISC Arab  ] to [MISC African  ] issues , the [ORG GOL  ] has stressed that it intends to focus on [MISC African  ] , vice [MISC Arab  ] issues , and will represent [MISC African  ] consensus views . 
End note . 
) 6 . 
( C ) Comment: Post heard a number of rumors in the immediate aftermath of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's visit to [LOC Cairo  ] suggesting he might seek to travel to [LOC New York  ] to attend sessions of the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
Those seem to have diminished in the wake of Foreign Minister [PER Shalgham  ] 's subsequent visit to [LOC Washington  ] , suggesting that the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000014 002.2 OF 002 mixed media reaction to [PER Shalgham  ] 's visit may have given the [ORG GOL  ] pause to consider whether now is really the right time for [PER Qadhafi  ] to seek to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] End comment .
