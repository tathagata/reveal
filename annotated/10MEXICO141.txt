( C ) Summary: Mexico’s ambitious plan to use its final [ORG Rio Group Presidency Summit  ] ( Cancun 22-23 February ) to create a new more operational forum for regional cooperation failed dramatically . 
The two-day event was dominated by press accounts of [ORG ALBA  ] country theatrics and their usual proclivity towards third world , anti-imperialist rhetoric . 
Nothing practical was achieved on the two pressing regional priorities - [LOC Haiti  ] ( President Preval did attend but the discussion was an obscured footnote ) and [LOC Honduras  ] ( Pres . 
[PER Lobo  ] was not even invited in deference to [MISC Venezuela/ALBA  ] ) - and [LOC Brazil  ] and the [ORG ALBA  ] countries outmaneuvered the [MISC Mexicans  ] , leaving the details of the new organization in the hands of a [MISC Latin American  ] and [ORG Caribbean Summit  ] ( [ORG CALC  ] ) structure that will be managed by [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] in 2011 . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding President [PER Calderon’s  ] best intentions to create a more practical regional forum for regionally dealing with [MISC Latin American  ] priorities ( ref A ) , Mexico’s [MISC Latin American  ] Unity summit in the tourist resort of Cancun ( 22-23 February ) was poorly conceived , inadequately managed , and badly executed . 
The Cancun Declaration presents a long laundry list of issues without specifying any details on how they will be operationally translated into effective international action . 
The meeting did not agree on a name for the new organization ( see below ) , on a date for when it will be launched , or on any practical details ( secretariat , funding , etc . 
) that would indicate how the new organization would develop . 
Worse yet was the press play and unofficial commentary from informed sources , that were downright derisive of the meeting and the contradictory message it sent about Mexico’s interests and foreign policy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Already at the ceremonial opening on Monday ( 22 February ) it was clear that things were not going well . 
Negotiations on the declaration had ground down on the operational details of the communique and [LOC Brazil  ] and the [ORG ALBA  ] countries were firmly resisting Mexico’s proposal that the new forum be constituted immediately with agreement on institutional details . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] did not want to see the [ORG CALC  ] be subsumed before the end of his Presidency and [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] wanted to leave his [ORG CALC Summit  ] ( [LOC Venezuela  ] assumes the [ORG CALC Presidency from Brazil  ] in 2011 ) on schedule , and available for a grand launching of the new forum that , as he said to the press , would commemorate the realization of the [MISC Bolivarian  ] themes of [MISC Latin American  ] solidarity in the birthplace of the “Great [PER Liberator.” Chavez  ] was his usual , over the top self in proclaiming the death of the [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [ORG OAS  ] ) , in lending a hand to [MISC Argentine  ] President [MISC Kirchner’s  ] protest against [MISC British  ] drilling for oil in the [LOC Malvinas  ] , and in almost coming to blows with [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] over the latter’s protest of [MISC Venezuela’s  ] economic embargo against [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] played the supporting role as [PER Chavez’  ] factotum , parroting [PER Chavez’  ] speeches and lavishing praise and compliments on [PER Raul Castro’s  ] [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[MISC Ecuadorian  ] President [PER Correa  ] used the meeting to try and divert money laundering allegations leveled against [LOC Ecuador  ] , by suggesting the need for a new “more balanced” regional mechanism to address the issue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Even Calderon’s own [ORG PAN  ] party officials were privately dismissive of the event . 
[ORG PAN  ] international affairs coordinator [PER Rodrigo Cortez  ] characterized the meeting as a “sad spectacle that does nothing to project our party’s views on international priorities and the importance of the relationship between [LOC Mexico  ] and the [MISC United States.” He  ] decried the public images of [LOC Calderon  ] “hugging and cavorting” with [PER Chavez  ] , [PER Morales  ] and [PER Castro  ] and was pessimistic from the start that anything practical would come from the meeting. “We did not even invite [LOC Honduras  ] , leaving them out of the meeting in order to ensure [ORG ALBA  ] participation - a decision that turned the meeting upside down with regard to our concrete security and other interests.” [LOC MEXICO  ] 00000141 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The low point of the meeting was the verbal exchange between [PER Uribe  ] and [PER Chavez  ] at the opening day official lunch . 
[PER Uribe  ] raised [MISC Venezuela’s  ] economic embargo on [LOC Colombia  ] , terming it unhelpful and inconsistent with the region’s economic interest and at odds with [MISC Venezuela’s  ] strong criticism of the [LOC U.S.  ] Embargo on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Colombia’s Ambassador in [LOC Mexico  ] , [PER Luis Camilo Osorio  ] , told the polmincouns that , contrary to press accounts , [PER Uribe  ] raised the issue in a non-confrontational way . 
According to [PER Osorio  ] and press accounts , [PER Chavez  ] reacted emotionally accusing [LOC Colombia  ] of having sent assassination squads to kill him and ended a verbal and physical tirade with “You can go to hell ; I am leaving ( the lunch ) .” [PER Uribe  ] responded , “Don’t be a coward and leave just to insult me from a distance.” Verbal and body language continued to escalate , until [PER Raul Castro  ] stepped in to urge civilized discussion . 
Outside of the dining room , [MISC Venezuelan  ] security officials were scuffling with [MISC Mexican  ] security guards in an attempt to assist their President. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Osorio  ] was very critical of the [ORG Summit  ] , terming it the worst expression of [ORG Banana Republic  ] discourse that blames all of the regions problems on others without any practical solutions of their own . 
[PER Osorio  ] said the [MISC Colombians  ] had proposed working jointly on a concrete agenda during [PER Calderon’s  ] recent visit to [LOC Colombia  ] . 
The [MISC Mexicans  ] , he said , were not interested , confident that they had everything under control . 
[PER Osorio  ] opined that “Calderon had simply put a bunch of the worst types together in a room , expecting to outsmart them . 
Instead , [LOC Brazil  ] outplayed him completely , and [LOC Venezuela  ] outplayed [MISC Brazil.” There  ] was no practical planning , there was no management of the agenda , and there was none of the legwork that would have been needed to yield a practical and useful outcome. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] DCM [PER Antonio Francisco Da Costa E Silva Neto  ] conveyed his country’s view that [LOC Brazil  ] had done a better job of managing the summit than the [MISC Mexican  ] hosts . 
[LOC Brazil  ] was able to ensure that the new [ORG Rio Group  ] would emerge , not from the [ORG Summit  ] , but from ongoing discussions in the [ORG Rio Group  ] and the [ORG CALC  ] , where [LOC Brazil  ] could exert its influence . 
The [ORG CALC  ] survived and [LOC Brazil  ] would be managing that process as part of the troika when it turned over the presidency to [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) We heard similar themes from ex-Ambassador [PER Jorge Montano  ] , a [MISC PRI-connected  ] , former respected senior [MISC Mexican  ] diplomat . 
He echoed Cortez’ criticism , channeling it into an elegant but critical op-ed in [LOC Mexico  ] daily Universal ( Feb 26 ) . 
Montano’s piece , entitled “With or Without the [ORG OAS  ] , ” reviewed briefly the history of [MISC Latin American  ] regional forums , also criticizing [LOC U.S.  ] lack of attention to the region ( e.g . 
[ORG Summit  ] of [ORG Americas  ] ) but noting the practical achievements realized in the [ORG OAS  ] . 
He called the [ORG Summit  ] unnecessary and inconsistent with Mexico’s interests and called for immediate damage control . 
[PER Montano  ] told us that he received separate calls from [LOC Calderon  ] and from Foreign Secretary [PER Espinoza  ] , irate over his criticism. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The media coverage did not in any way suggest a practical forum and there was a good supply of criticism , in addition to Montano’s piece , which was respectful in its choice of words . 
The most damning criticism was a political cartoon in the leading daily [ORG Reforma  ] ( Feb 24 ) which depicted a large [PER Chavez  ] gorilla , with a small [PER Castro  ] perched on his back playing an accordion labeled “CanCubaZuela Group” with a small image of [LOC Calderon  ] dancing to the music and waving marimbas . 
[PER Osorio  ] told us at a same day [ORG Central Bank  ] event with leading [MISC Mexican  ] businessmen that there were abundant references to the cartoon and its apt characterization of the Summit’s result . 
Comment ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In the end [LOC Mexico  ] was limited to agreement on a new forum but without any specific commitments on institutional details . 
The [MISC Cancun  ] declaration is a bulging rhetorical exercise [LOC MEXICO  ] 00000141 003 OF 003 that reflects the lack of agreement with its general and non-specific language . 
The press play leaned towards the critical side and even those who recognized Calderon’s well-mentioned effort focused more attention on the paltry results . 
Even on the issues that [LOC Mexico  ] argued to us before the summit were reasons for bolstering the [ORG Rio Group  ] -- success on Colombia-Venezuela-Ecuador problem - the [ORG Summit  ] result was directly contrary to hopes for a new more operational mechanism in the region. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) We have not had yet received the official [ORG GOM  ] post-Summit read-out from our [ORG SRE  ] and Presidency sources - they have been busy finishing the Declaration and doing follow up work with the [MISC Latin American  ] Missions . 
We will be shortly following up with their analysis and comments on the way ahead , and their plans for deepening trade and investment through a new arrangement with [LOC Brazil  ] , announced at the end of the [ORG Summit  ] . 
Whatever their read out , this is not playing here as a “diplomatic success , ” except in some very general sense of raising the need for more effective regional action . 
Unfortunately , the [MISC Cancun Latin American Unity  ] [ORG Summit  ] was not an example of a new and bold step into the future but rather a reminder of Mexico’s at times conflicting message on how it sees the future of the region and Mexico’s role as one of its leaders .
