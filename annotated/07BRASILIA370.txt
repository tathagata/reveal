End summary . 
BILATERAL RELATIONS AND BIOFUELS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] outlined for FM [PER Amorim  ] the evolution of [LOC U.S.  ] global strategy away from the [MISC Cold War  ] 's [MISC Euro-centric  ] paradigm toward the current focus on building strategic partnerships with key regional powers , including [LOC India  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] is eager to intensify its dialogue with [LOC Brazil  ] , and the prospect of two presidential meetings in March -- in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and later in the [LOC United States  ] -- offer great opportunities to move in that direction. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] offered as an example the new and dynamic [LOC U.S.  ] relationship with [LOC India  ] , in which the bilateral agreement on civil nuclear energy has served as the " backbone " for improving political , commercial and cultural links between [LOC India  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
Praising [LOC Brazil  ] 's regional leadership ( e.g. , in [LOC Haiti  ] ) and its strong commitment to democracy , [PER U/S Burns  ] indicated the [ORG USG  ] 's desire to turn now toward deepening its strategic relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Noting the critical geopolitical , environmental and energy consequences of over-reliance on oil , [PER U/S Burns  ] stressed the [ORG USG  ] 's heightened interest in establishing alternative energy options , and said this augured well for building a partnership with [LOC Brazil  ] with cooperation in development of biofuels technologies and markets as the centerpiece . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] indicated the [ORG USG  ] will be working with the [ORG GOB  ] to conclude a biofuels agreement with [LOC Brazil  ] -- based on a draft [ORG MOU  ] provided by [LOC Brazil  ] -- with a view to making the accord a deliverable for the March pr esidential meetings. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) FM [PER Amorim  ] noted the generally positive state of [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations and personal friendship between Presidents [PER Lula  ] and [PER Bush  ] . 
He said [LOC U.S.  ] enthusiasm for close cooperation in biofuels has a resonant echo throughout the [ORG GOB  ] , starting with [PER Lula  ] himself , who is seized with the potential of biofuel as a transformational agent not only in energy but in effecting social change . 
[PER Amorim  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] is receptive to utilizing cooperation on biofuels as a [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000370 002 OF 004 central element for strengthening ties with the [LOC United States  ] , but also issued a caveat against " ethanolizing " the entire bilateral relationship , which is more diverse and complex than any single issue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] and [PER U/S Burns  ] discussed the component of the draft biofuels [ORG MOU  ] which addresses [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation in third country economic and social development projects , and [PER U/S Burns  ] presented the [ORG USG  ] preference for a multi-country approach , including projects in [LOC South America  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] reiterated [LOC Brazil  ] 's stated preference for commencing [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation in third countries with pilot projects in [LOC Central America  ] or the [LOC Caribbean  ] . 
Pressed by [PER U/S Burns  ] as to [LOC Brazil  ] 's reasoning on this point , [PER Amorim  ] said that [ORG GOB  ] concerns include reactions within Mercosul to an initial biofuel project in a [MISC South American  ] country that would certainly be outside of that regional group . 
In the case of [LOC Colombia  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] would not rule out cooperation at some point , but it would be necessary to create a clear line between [MISC Brazilian  ] efforts on biofuels and any connection to [LOC Plan Colombia  ] , which is controversial in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Moreover , [PER Amorim  ] noted that the [ORG GOB  ] has not attempted a broad international effort of this complexity before , and is concerned about " scattering its energy too widely . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] prefers to focus initially on a single pilot project in a relatively small country where there is good potential for a transformative effect on a near-term horizon . 
Such a success would establish a positive precedent for [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation , and subsequent joint projects -- including in [LOC South America  ] and [LOC Africa  ] -- would then become seen by all as " routine , " he said . 
RECIPROCITY ISSUES <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Amorim  ] again asked the [ORG USG  ] to relax its current restrictions on leasing or purchasing of properties for the [MISC Brazilian  ] bilateral and [ORG UN  ] missions in the [LOC United States  ] , which the [ORG USG  ] has linked to resolution of property and social security problems the [ORG USG  ] continues to confront with its mission in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] noted that the foreign ministry has submitted an accord for congressional approval which will resolve the [LOC U.S.  ] problems in [LOC Brazil  ] , but that in light of the fact that congressional approval could take " perhaps the rest of the year , " a loosening of restrictions on [LOC Brazil  ] would be a good will gesture in the bilateral relationship . 
[PER Amorim  ] implied that [ORG GOB  ] receptivity to a [ORG USG  ] request to base an Embassy C-12 aircraft in [LOC Brasilia  ] is now linked to a [LOC U.S.  ] show of flexibility . 
( Note: In a press interview on 2 February , [PER Amorim  ] complained that the [ORG USG  ] is " retaliating " against [LOC Brazil  ] because of the [LOC U.S. Mission  ] 's problems in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
End note . 
) [LOC HAITI  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] affirmed that the [ORG GOB  ] has assumed its role in [LOC Haiti  ] as " a long-term commitment . 
" [PER Amorim  ] said the [LOC Haiti  ] experience has been a positive example of [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation , even though the two governments have sometimes differed on specific aspects of the mission . 
[LOC Haiti  ] now has an elected national government , and it is imperative for the international community to avoid " the vicious circle " of not donating resources to a government that is not perfect , thereby ensuring that the government and country can never improve to a point of deserving donations , [PER Amorim  ] said . 
In addition , it continues to be crucial , in the [ORG GOB  ] 's view , that the population perceive tangible improvements in their daily lives in the near term . 
[ORG MINUSTAH  ] can secure [PER Bel Aire  ] and other crime-ridden areas , but the local populations will grow disillusioned and restive if there is no follow-up in basic services and social programs , [PER Amorim  ] said . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000370 003 OF 004 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] agreed that President Preval is mounting a serious effort at governance and deserves support ; the [ORG USG  ] is now sending resources for security and development in [LOC Cite Soleil  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] and [PER U/S Burns  ] agreed that the [ORG USG  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] should continue pressing the [MISC Chinese  ] Government to support the 12 month extension for [ORG MINUSTAH  ] , and [PER Amorim  ] instructed his staff to call the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador in [LOC Brasilia  ] in immediately to receive a new demarche on the issue . 
[LOC Beijing  ] 's Ambassador in [LOC Brasilia  ] is a good channel to [LOC PRC  ] on the issue because he had served in [LOC East Timor  ] and " had seen first-hand what happens when the [ORG UN  ] leaves too soon , " [PER Amorim  ] noted . 
[LOC VENEZUELA  ] AND [LOC BOLIVIA  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] said [PER Hugo Chavez  ] 's political path is not that of [LOC Brazil  ] , but [LOC Brazil  ] " does not feel threatened " by [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's military build-up is part of a quest for prestige , and his rhetorical excesses are primarily for internal consumption in [LOC Venezuela  ] -- " his bark is worse than his bite , " [PER Amorim  ] opined . 
Isolation is not a solution with [PER Chavez  ] , since it would only serve to make him " more radical and self-righteous , " [PER Amorim  ] said . 
[LOC Brazil  ] tries to be a positive influence in ameliorating [PER Chavez  ] 's behavior , and has had some successes , but with his electoral victories and the strength of oil prices consolidating [PER Chavez  ] 's position , " there is only so much we can do . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] has vital interests with [LOC Venezuela  ] -- infrastructure and energy investments , for example -- and it has to be careful. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] said the [ORG USG  ] has taken [PER Lula  ] 's advice and does not respond to [PER Chavez  ] 's constant provocations . 
" We don't want to isolate him , we want to talk to him , but he won't deal with us , " [PER U/S Burns  ] emphasized . 
[PER Amorim  ] replied that the [ORG GOB  ] had urged the [MISC Venezuelans  ] to open a dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] , to no avail , and [PER Amorim  ] had also intervened personally with [PER Chavez  ] in the [ORG Sumate  ] human rights case . 
[PER Amorim  ] also complained that the removal of former [MISC Venezuelan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ali Rodriguez  ] was a bad thing . 
He described [PER Rodriguez  ] as an intelligent and reliable interlocutor . 
He complained that the current Foreign Minister , [PER Nicolas Maduro  ] , seems " insecure . 
" [PER Amorim  ] has tried to persuade [PER Maduro  ] to come alone to [LOC Brasilia  ] for discussions , but he refuses to travel apart from [PER Chavez  ] " because he is afraid of him . 
" [PER Amorim  ] suggested that continued efforts be made to engage [PER Chavez  ] in a broad dialogue on the region , since focusing on [LOC Venezuela  ] 's internal situation is unlikely to yield results . 
He also complained that the disunity and in-fighting in the opposition had only helped [PER Chavez  ] , and reiterated his standing complaint that [LOC Brazil  ] 's ability to influence [PER Chavez  ] had been undercut by the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to block export of [MISC Embraer Super  ] Tucano aircraft to [LOC Venezuela  ] by refusing export licensing of [LOC U.S.  ] content in the planes. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] and [PER U/S Burns  ] touched briefly on [LOC Bolivia  ] , and agreed on the continuing need to reach out to [PER Morales  ] wherever possible . 
Patience and perseverance are needed , " so that he does not fall into [PER Chavez  ] 's arms , " [PER Amorim  ] said . 
The [ORG GOB  ] further doubts that the military ties [PER Morales  ] appears to be establishing with [PER Chavez  ] will be fruitful for [LOC Bolivia  ] , and appear to be causing a significant political backlash . 
On [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Amorim  ] noted that [PER Lula  ] and President [PER Uribe  ] enjoy a good relationship , and that [LOC Brazil  ] is watching with interest the disarmament process with paramilitaries . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] and [PER Amorim  ] agreed that the process must proceed with care and rigor , as the experience with the paramilitaries will set the standard for any future effort with the [LOC FARC.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
