Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . 
SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) A group of five [ORG ROK  ] opinion leaders and experts on [LOC North Korea  ] issues told A/S [PER Kurt Campbell  ] on February 3 it was difficult to predict whether [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] youngest son [PER Kim Jong-un  ] would be able to succeed his father without sparking instability in the [LOC North  ] . 
Of the five experts , one thought the younger [PER Kim  ] might succeed and one argued his lack of leadership experience made it unlikely he would win the support of the ruling elites . 
They agreed that [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] brother-in-law [PER Jang Song-taek  ] would prove a strong rival for the younger [PER Kim  ] and would probably be tempted to challenge him . 
[PER Kim Jong-il  ] had used draconian controls and international aid to discourage coups after having foiled three such attempts in the late 90s . 
China’s strategic interests were fundamentally at odds with [MISC U.S.-ROK  ] interests in [LOC North Korea  ] . 
End Summary . 
Succession in Progress but Success in Doubt ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Kurt Campbell  ] met on February 3 with [MISC Korean  ] opinion leaders with a keen interest in [LOC DPRK  ] issues to hear their views on the future of [LOC North Korea  ] . 
The experts agreed that regime succession was fully underway and that the [MISC North Korean  ] people had accepted the process . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said a [MISC North Korean  ] diplomat based in [LOC Beijing  ] had told him over the phone that morning that the [ORG DPRK Foreign Ministry  ] had instructed all of its overseas missions to “lay the foundation for leadership change in [LOC Pyongyang.” Most  ] of the experts believed the challenge for [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] youngest son and designated heir , [PER Kim Jong-un  ] , would most likely come after his father died . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] recalled the [ORG Chosun Dynasty’s  ] 500 year history in which political intrigue and tension might simmer for years , but tended to erupt only after the king died . 
3 . 
( C ) The group agreed that [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] brother-in-law and right-hand man [PER Jang Song-taek  ] was spearheading the succession drive and would be a rival for power once [PER Kim Jong-un’s  ] father died , but the group was split on the younger Kim’s prospects for holding onto power . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed it would be difficult for [PER Jang  ] to wrest power from the younger [PER Kim  ] once the succession process was complete . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested it was unclear whether [PER Jang  ] would be content to control the younger [PER Kim  ] from behind the curtain , or would challenge him directly for outright control . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] Doubts About Younger Kim’s Experience ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) There were many reasons to doubt that [PER Kim Jong-un  ] would be able to successfully fend off challenges to his control after his father died . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [PER Kim Jong-il  ] had twenty years of experience as an official of the [ORG Korean Workers’ Party  ] before his father died . 
Furthermore , [PER Kim Jong-il  ] had the benefit of years of guidance from his father after he had been officially anointed in 1980 to eventually succeed him . 
By contrast , [PER Kim Jong-un  ] had very limited experience and might not get much direct guidance before [PER Kim Jong-il  ] dies . 
Even now , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] it was not clear that [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] health was good enough to exercise the faculties necessary for day-to-day management of state affairs . 
Given the limited opportunity the younger [PER Kim  ] had to gain experience , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] doubted his ability to solidify his position in the [ORG Party  ] and win the unwavering support of Pyongyang’s power elites . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] recalled the tumultuous state of affairs in the [ORG ROK  ] following the death of President [PER Park Chung  ] Hee in 1979 and suggested the [ORG DPRK  ] succession would be “100 times more troublesome.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] Tight Control and Aid [ORG Kept Regime Afloat  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] opined that brutal repression and international aid had been the secrets of [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] ability to fend off challenges . 
After three separate coup attempts in the 90s , [PER Kim Jong-il  ] had implemented very strict controls and sent a stern warning to would-be plotters by executing anyone who had been even remotely involved in the plots . 
Therefore , only the military could even dare consider rising up , but the [ORG Security Services  ] had successfully kept the military in check . 
XXXXXXXXXXXwent on to suggest that the “indulgence” of the international community over the past ten years had also helped sustain the regime . 
The large-scale assistance provided to the regime by the [ORG ROK  ] , [LOC China  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Japan  ] and others had been intended in part to avoid a hard landing , and indeed had kept the regime afloat , he said . 
[ Name removed ] suggested that [LOC North Korea  ] had skillfully played [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] off one another.XXXXXXXXXXX believed that the [LOC DPRK  ] had exploited large amounts of assistance from [LOC China  ] , taking advantage of a situation in which [LOC Beijing  ] was presumed by [LOC Washington  ] to have significant influence over [LOC Pyongyang  ] . 
[LOC China  ] Complicates the Endgame ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The experts agreed that China’s obsession with [LOC DPRK  ] stability at all costs , was clearly and fundamentally at odds with [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG ROK  ] interests . 
Given a choice between reaching out to [LOC Seoul  ] or [LOC Beijing  ] , [ name removed ] believed that [ORG Pyongyang  ] elites would reflexively look to [LOC China  ] for support if they believed they needed help in maintaining stability . 
The [LOC Seoul  ] option would be unacceptable because of the [MISC U.S.-ROK  ] alliance and concerns over becoming subservient to [LOC Seoul  ] . 
[LOC China  ] , on the other hand , would gladly provide support with few or no strings attached , just to maintain the [LOC DPRK  ] as an independent entity , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] maintained. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXnoted that although [LOC Washington  ] had a keen interest in both denuclearization and human rights , the [LOC U.S.  ] stake in [LOC North Korea  ] was minimal compared to that of [LOC China  ] by virtue of its proximity to the [LOC North  ] . 
[LOC China  ] did not share [MISC American  ] perspectives on these two key issues , considering them somewhat abstract . 
Rather , [LOC Beijing  ] was concerned about what it considered to be more concrete issues , such as a potential flood of “economic migrants” and broader social unrest on its immediate border . 
Reaching the People and [ORG Close Cooperation  ] are Key --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Negating [MISC Chinese  ] influence over the long term , [ Name removed ] observed , would involve close [MISC U.S.-ROK  ] cooperation in winning the hearts and minds of the [MISC North Korean  ] people .
