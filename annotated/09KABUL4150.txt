( C ) Summary: Paktya Governor [PER Juma Khan Hamdard  ] has the skills and charisma to be a successful politician . 
However , his [ORG Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin  ] ( [ORG HiG  ] ) connections , alleged meddling in political affairs in [LOC Balkh Province  ] , leadership of a province-wide corruption scheme , and suspected contacts with insurgents make him detrimental to the future of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Through an investigation of corruption involving a local ( [MISC Afghan  ] ) engineer assigned to the [MISC U.S.-led  ] Provincial Reconstruction Team ( PRT ) in the province , [ORG Patkya’s National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) Chief informs that [PER Hamdard  ] is the central point of a vast corruption network involving the provincial chief of police and several [MISC Afghan  ] ministry line directors . 
Alleged skimming of [ORG USG  ] development funds occurs at four stages of a project: when contractors bid on a project , at application for building permits , during construction , and at the ribbon-cutting ceremony . 
These allegations of corruption hamper [ORG USG  ] relations with [MISC GIRoA  ] officials , as well as contractors , and are being reviewed by [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy law enforcement officials . 
As with other corruption cases , a major challenge to successful prosecution will be the [MISC Afghan  ] legal system’s limited institutional capacity -- the [ORG Major Crimes Task Force  ] ( [ORG MCTF  ] ) currently has four vetted prosecutors and a limited number of vetted investigators to work this and numerous other pending corruption cases from all over the country . 
End Summary . 
GOVERNOR’S PEDIGREE AS HIG COMMANDER ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Governor [PER Hamdard  ] was born in 1954 and is an ethnic [MISC Pashtun  ] from [LOC Balkh Province  ] . 
He is a member of the [LOC Wardak  ] tribe from [LOC Mazar-i-Sharif  ] . 
He supposedly completed high school , but has poor reading and writing skills . 
During the war with the [MISC Soviets  ] , [PER Hamdard  ] fought under [PER Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s  ] leadership and was a [ORG HiG  ] commander . 
In 1994 , he fought with General [PER Dostum  ] against the [ORG Taliban  ] until he defected to the Taliban’s side and assisted in their victory over [PER Dostum  ] in 1997-98 . 
Following the [MISC U.S.-led  ] coalition’s invasion in 2001 , [PER Hamdard  ] rejoined Dostum’s forces , although relations were uneasy . 
Following the war , he served as Number 8 Corps Commander in [LOC Balkh  ] . 
[PER Hamdard  ] was later appointed governor of [LOC Baghlan  ] and then [MISC Jowzjan  ] provinces . 
He became governor of [LOC Paktya  ] in December 2007 . 
[PER Hamdard  ] also is one of President [PER Karzai’s Tribal Advisors  ] . 
He is affiliated with [ORG Hezb-i-Islami Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG HiA  ] ) , a political party , and is its leader in northern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Sensitive reporting indicates that [PER Hamdard  ] is still serving as a [ORG HiG  ] commander and leads a faction of [ORG HiG  ] fighters in the north . 
He often signs memos with the military title “Lieutenant General.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In [LOC Paktya  ] , [PER Hamdard  ] has shown himself to be a very charismatic leader . 
Nevertheless , he spends more time outside the province than in it , leaving most governance responsibilities to Deputy Governor [PER Abdul Rahman Mangal  ] . 
Prior to the August 2009 elections , he stated on several occasions to [LOC U.S.  ] representatives that he expected to leave [LOC Paktya  ] for a governorship in another province or a national position following the elections . 
Rumors in [LOC Gardez  ] and [LOC Jalalabad  ] place him as a top candidate for the governor of [LOC Nangarhar  ] . 
( Comment . 
As [MISC Nangarhar’s  ] governor , he would have access to significant revenues generated at the [LOC Torkham Gate  ] border crossing with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
End comment . 
) THREATENING THE USE OF FORCE DURING ELECTION CAMPAIGNING --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During the pre-election period for both the August 20 elections and the subsequent planned run-off , [PER Hamdard  ] spent a significant amount of time outside of [LOC Paktya  ] reportedly campaigning for President [PER Karzai  ] . 
According to [MISC Afghan  ] and international press , his activities in [LOC Balkh Province  ] during this period created potential for armed conflict . 
[PER Abdullah Abdullah  ] supporters claimed that [PER Hamdard  ] abused his government position by campaigning in the northern provinces and distributing weapons to [MISC Balkh’s Pashtun  ] districts in order to destabilize the province . 
[PER Hamdard  ] denied these charges and armed clashes were avoided because the run-off was canceled , but his activities in [LOC Balkh  ] demonstrated the strong support base that he continues to maintain in the north . 
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR 2007 DEATHS OF DEMONSTRATORS [LOC KABUL  ] 00004150 002 OF 003 --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Hamdard’s own comments on his governorship in [LOC Paktya  ] leave the impression he was “banished” to this southeastern province . 
In May 2007 he was forced to resign as governor of [MISC Jowzjan  ] when thousands demonstrated against him . 
Forces under his command shot at demonstrators in the [MISC Uzbek  ] town of [LOC Shibirghan  ] , killing thirteen and injuring more than thirty , reportedly further straining relations with [PER Dostum  ] because many of the demonstrators were [MISC Junbesh  ] party members and [PER Dostum  ] supporters . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX informed us that the [ORG Ministry of the Interior Administration  ] Deputy requested his assistance in arresting Governor [PER Hamdard  ] and bringing him to trial for the charges . 
No action has been taken to carry out this request . 
CENTER OF [MISC PAKTYA CORRUPTION SCHEME  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) On August 23 , the [LOC Paktya  ] office of the [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) arrested PRT Paktya’s local national engineer [PER Jawid Khairudeen  ] , an [MISC Afghan  ] citizen , for engaging in corrupt contract practices . 
Investigations surrounding the [PER Jawid  ] case reveal an extensive network of corruption throughout the province of which [PER Hamdard  ] and his [ORG Office Director/Chief of Staff  ] [PER Hashmatullah Yousifi  ] are allegedly at the center . 
[LOC Paktya  ] [ORG NDS  ] Chief [PER Ali Ahmad Mubaraz  ] and eyewitnesses have accused [PER Hamdard  ] of soliciting bribes from contractors by having contractors arrested at job sites and held until the bribes are paid . 
[ORG NDS  ] also accuses [PER Hamdard  ] of being an active member of [ORG Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin  ] ( [ORG HiG  ] ) in [LOC Balkh Province  ] , funneling money he receives from bribes and smuggling ( drugs and jewels ) to [ORG HiG  ] operations in his home province of [LOC Balkh  ] . 
He allegedly has illicit contacts with insurgents in [LOC Parwan  ] , [LOC Kunar  ] , and [LOC Kabul  ] provinces , as well as [MISC Pakistani  ] intelligence ( ISI ) and [MISC Iranian  ] ( affiliation unknown , possibly [ORG IRGC  ] ) operatives , through his business in [LOC Dubai  ] ; he is allegedly a business partner with [PER Gulbaddin Hekmatyr’s  ] son in [LOC Dubai  ] . 
Evidence collected in the case points to corruption involving [LOC U.S.  ] funds and actively undermining [MISC GIRoA  ] counter-insurgency policy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On October 29 XXXXXXXXXXXX came to [LOC Forward Operating Base  ] [LOC Gardez  ] to speak with the [ORG PRT  ] about corruption in Governor Hamdard’s office . 
According to XXXXXXXXXXXX , there are four opportunities at the provincial level for illegally skimming [ORG USG  ] funds during the life cycle of a [ORG PRT  ] development project: the first is during the bidding/selection process . 
At this stage [MISC Afghan  ] ministry line directors , who are part of the contractor selection process , receive payments to rig the scores assigned to contractors so that they will receive the highest scores and qualify for the contract . 
The second opportunity occurs when the contractor requests a permit to start work . 
The Governor’s signature is needed for the permit , so payments are made to intermediaries to secure the governor’s signature . 
The third occasion occurs during the quality assessment/quality control ( [ORG QA/QC  ] ) process . 
At this stage , workers may be arrested at the construction site and held until the requesting [ORG QA/QC  ] government official is paid a bribe ; the other possibility is that the contractor must pay off the public works official conducting [ORG QA/QC  ] on the project in order to receive a positive report . 
The final opportunity for graft occurs at the ribbon-cutting ceremony where significant sums of money are sometimes passed during the gift-giving part of the ceremony . 
STRONG SENSE OF IMPUNITY --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Based on evidence collected , [PER Hamdard  ] and his accomplices allegedly act with complete impunity , blatantly placing themselves above the law . 
Contractors have informed the [ORG PRT  ] that [PER Hamdard  ] told them he does not care about possible repercussions of his corrupt practices “because he’s under investigation already ; ” if contractors “complain to the [ORG PRT  ] about him , he will have them chained and dragged to his office.” Adding salt to the wound , on October 19 , the Governor called [ORG PRT  ] leadership and the maneuver commander to his office to confront them with an e-mail [PER Hamdard  ] obtained in which a [ORG PRT  ] officer asked a contractor constructing border police checkpoints questions about corruption involving Paktya’s chief of police and [PER Hamdard  ] . 
( Note: The e-mail was apparently leaked to [PER Hamdard  ] although he stated he received it from a [LOC GIRoA  ] source . 
End Note . 
) During the meeting [PER Hamdard  ] waxed indignant and , in a memo dated soon after , [LOC KABUL  ] 00004150 003 OF 003 proscribed ministerial line directors from meeting further with [ORG UNAMA  ] or [ORG PRT  ] officials , or answering queries from them . 
Word has consequently spread about the corruption investigations ; and interlocutors are reluctant to talk to [ORG NDS  ] and [ORG Coalition Forces  ] representatives -- many stating that their lives are threatened . 
COMMENT ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Allegations of corruption surrounding Governor [PER Hamdard  ] have come from all quarters including the private sector , public employees , and XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
[MISC Afghans  ] throughout the province generally regard him as corrupt . 
Hamdard’s ham-fisted approach to intimidate international partners and the [ORG PRT  ] , while not an admission of guilt , illustrates his contempt for the international donor community , [MISC GIRoA  ] , the lawful processes for development within ministry line directories in particular , and the rule of law . 
His reported statement that he wants to “declare a jihad against the [MISC PRT”  ] is illustrative of the strained relations with the [ORG PRT  ] . 
Somewhat fortunately , Governor [PER Hamdard  ] is often away in [LOC Kabul  ] or [LOC Balkh Province  ] and Deputy Governor [PER Mangal  ] is a capable administrator and thoughtful intermediary. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) If Hamdard’s case comes to trial , his political influence and [ORG HIG  ] ties make it possible or perhaps likely that corruption among other high-ranking government officials in the [ORG Province  ] and beyond will be exposed . 
The [ORG PRT  ] has briefed this case to the embassy via appropriate channels and will share the investigative documentation to date . 
[LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement officers based in [LOC Kabul  ] will work with the [MISC Afghan  ] Attorney General’s office to develop this case further . 
As with other corruption cases , a major challenge to successful prosecution will be the [MISC Afghan  ] legal system’s limited institutional capacity . 
The [ORG Major Crimes Task Force  ] ( [ORG MCTF  ] ) currently has four vetted prosecutors and a limited number of vetted investigators to work this and numerous other pending corruption cases from all over the country .
