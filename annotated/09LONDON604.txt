( C/NF ) Summary and comment: Emboffs attending the [ORG Liberal Democrats’  ] ( [ORG Lib Dems  ] ) Spring Conference heard much in corridor conversations about the Party’s strategy for the next general election ( which must occur no later than June 2010 ) and whether participation in an electoral coalition made strategic sense for the [MISC Party:  ] - The [ORG Coalition Calculus  ] - [ORG Labour  ] is “competition , ” but the [MISC Conservatives  ] are “opposition:” Most [ORG Lib Dems  ] are instinctively hostile to the [MISC Conservatives  ] and would not agree to join a [MISC Tory-led  ] governing coalition , should the next election produce a hung parliament or an offer from either party to join in a governing coalition . 
Propping up an “exhausted” [ORG Labour  ] party led by [PER Gordon Brown  ] is seen by most [ORG Lib Dems  ] as “political suicide” because it undercuts the [ORG Lib Dems’  ] appeal as a party of political change . 
For now , an informal arrangement that does not commit the party to working with either [ORG Labour  ] or the [MISC Tories  ] in a future government is seen as the approach likely to give the [ORG Lib Dems  ] the most policy influence , although a formal coalition with [ORG Labour  ] under new , non-Brown leadership has not been ruled out. - [ORG Amplify Cable’s Voice  ] on the [ORG Economy: Party  ] members are pleased [ORG Lib Dem  ] Deputy [PER Vince Cable  ] has become a national voice on the economic downturn and is now garnering retroactive praise for his [MISC Churchillian  ] warnings over the past few years about the instability of the [LOC UK  ] financial system . 
The [ORG Lib Dems  ] are now working to broaden his credibility so it spills over to the party as a whole and translates into electoral gains. - The Death of [ORG Cameron’s Son Changes Election Strategy:  ] The [ORG Lib Dem  ] counter-Conservative strategy in the next election was to attack [MISC Tory  ] leader [PER David Cameron  ] as “fake” and “out of touch” with real life . 
The passing of [ORG Cameron’s  ] son [PER Ivan  ] has eliminated the ability to use that line of attack , according to [ORG Lib Dem  ] members , as well as muted the willingness of the [LOC UK  ] media to discuss “character attacks” against [PER Cameron  ] . 
Attacks on the [MISC Conservatives  ] will now have to take a different course and most likely be about the issues . 
On [MISC UK-U.S.  ] relations , the [ORG Lib Dems  ] welcome the [ORG USG’s  ] recent “constructive engagement” with [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] . 
Several party members saw allowing Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] to be the first [MISC European  ] -- though not the first world leader -- to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] was a way “to let the ( [LOC UK  ] ) down lightly” in favor of what they expect will be a more multilateral [LOC U.S.  ] approach to foreign affairs under the [MISC Obama  ] administration and one less focused on bilateral relationships with traditional allies . 
[ORG Lib Dems  ] supported new [ORG USG  ] focus on climate change and hoped that it will translate into deliverables in [LOC Copenhagen.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Summary and comment con’t . 
Although the [ORG Lib Dems  ] do not have an electoral issue that can strongly define them as a [ORG Party for UK  ] voters in the next election , as the party’s opposition to the [LOC Iraq  ] war did in the 2005 election , the [ORG Party also  ] does not come to the next election with the same baggage that [ORG Labour  ] and the [MISC Tories  ] both carry with many voters . 
Distrust over the Conservatives’ ability to handle the economy while ensuring social equality remains strong with many voters , and discontentment with Labour’s failure to stop the economic downturn continues to grow . 
Against this backdrop , the [ORG Lib Dems  ] hope to gain electoral ground as a party of change , especially amongst blue-collar workers who are frustrated with [ORG Labour  ] and distrustful of the [MISC Tories  ] . 
End summary and comment . 
[ORG Coalition Calculus: Labour is Competition  ] , [MISC Conservatives  ] are Opposition --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG Lib Dems’  ] agenda-light , March 7-8 Spring Conference in [LOC Harrogate  ] garnered a brief up-tick in national media coverage for the party ; conversations outside the conference hall focused heavily on the party’s electoral strategy in the next general election . 
[ORG Lib Dem  ] front bencher [PER Norman Lamb  ] explained to [PER Poloff  ] the party’s thinking about participation in any possible governing coalition , should neither [ORG Labour  ] nor the [MISC Conservatives  ] win an outright majority in the next election: “We see [ORG Labour  ] as our competition , and the [MISC Conservatives  ] as our opposition.” Most [ORG Lib Dems  ] , he said , are instinctively and ideologically against a coalition with the [MISC Conservatives  ] , including “right-wing members of the party like myself.” On the other hand , “propping up” [ORG Labour  ] under Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] - after an election in which the [LOC LONDON  ] 00000604 002 OF 003 voters have significantly reduced its number of seats - is “political suicide , ” especially since the [ORG Lib Dems’  ] main campaign message is a call for change . 
If there is no clear majority in Parliament after the next elections , [PER Lamb  ] said the [ORG Lib Dems  ] stand to gain the most by an informal arrangement whereby the [ORG Lib Dems  ] could select and negotiate support for various policies , as they do not see the benefit of a more formal coalition arrangement . 
[PER Lamb  ] admitted , however , that a coalition with [ORG Labour  ] under new , non-Brown leadership had not been ruled out . 
And Our Leaders Just [MISC Don’t Get Along  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Lamb  ] said that [ORG Lib Dem  ] leader [PER Nick Clegg  ] and [MISC Tory  ] chief [PER David Cameron  ] do not get along personally . 
[PER Lamb  ] said [PER Clegg  ] thinks [PER Cameron  ] is dismissive of him and [PER Clegg  ] refused an “aggressive” invitation to dine at [ORG Cameron’s  ] house . 
Upgrading [PER Cable  ] --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) Chief Economic Advisor and Speech Writer [PER Chris Saunders  ] told us that [ORG Lib Dem  ] Deputy leader [PER Vince Cable  ] has become a national voice on the economy , in part because he is now seen as one of the few [LOC UK  ] political leaders who warned about the weaknesses in the [LOC UK  ] financial regulatory system before the downturn began , but acknowledged that it is unclear if the broader public associates [PER Cable  ] with the [ORG Lib Dems  ] or sees him as a lone voice . 
In order to translate the public’s recent faith in [LOC Cable’s  ] views on the economy into support for the broader party , the [ORG Lib Dem  ] leadership plans to work improving [ORG Cable’s Lib Dem  ] “branding.” A New Strategy Is Required to Attack [PER Cameron  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Both [PER Saunders  ] and [PER Nick Clegg’s Speechwriter  ] and [ORG Policy Manager Polly Mackenzie  ] said that [ORG Cameron’s  ] clear vulnerability was the public perception that he is “fake” and “out of touch” with real life . 
The [ORG Lib Dems  ] strategy had been to attack [PER Cameron  ] on these lines and make much of his insulated , upper class persona . 
However , the death of [ORG Cameron’s  ] son [PER Ivan  ] not only eliminated these vulnerabilities in the eyes of the public but also made the media skittish about character attacks that [PER Cameron  ] does not have experience of real life . 
[PER Mackenzie  ] said the [ORG Lib Dems  ] are still recalculating , but their attacks on the [MISC Conservatives  ] will have to be focused on the issues , especially the enduring perception that the [MISC Conservatives  ] cannot be trusted to run the economy and ensure social equality . 
[PER Saunders  ] and [PER Mackenzie  ] agreed that [ORG Labour  ] would like to hold off calling for general elections until Spring 2010 in the hope that the media’s undeclared but apparent gentle approach with [PER Cameron  ] after his son’s death will have subsided . 
[LOC U.S.  ] - [ORG UK Relations  ] ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Lib Dem Foreign Affairs  ] Spokesperson [PER Ed Davey  ] , his Deputy [PER Jo Swinson  ] , and Development Spokesperson [PER Michael Moore  ] all welcomed the [ORG USG’s  ] “new constructive engagement” in foreign policy , especially with regards to [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Swinson  ] said the appointment of a [ORG Presidential Climate Change Envoy  ] was “a good thing” and hoped it would mean serious deliverables at the [LOC Copenhagen  ] conference. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Moore  ] said the [ORG USG’s  ] decision to host Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] as the first [MISC European  ] leader in [LOC Washington  ] was a way “to let the ( [LOC UK  ] ) down lightly” in favor of a new Administration preference for multilateralism . 
[PER Moore  ] thought relations between the [MISC U.S.-UK  ] would remain very warm , but that the [ORG USG  ] would likely pursue foreign policy objectives through multilateral institutions rather than through coalition building and its traditional partners . 
( Embassy comment: Former [MISC Democratic Party  ] chairman [PER Howard Dean’s  ] presence at the [ORG Lib Dem  ] conference , as well as his delivery of a keynote address on liberal politics , gave the conference a decidedly more pro-American tone than past [ORG Lib Dem  ] conferences have had . 
End comment . 
) Focused on Domestic Issues , but [MISC No Clear Message Yet  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) With [LOC UK  ] voters’ focusing on education , health care , and the [MISC UK’s  ] sharp economic downturn , the focus of this year’s conference was on domestic issues , not foreign policy , in stark contrast to previous conferences where the [ORG Lib Dems  ] have been able to raise their profile , and their support among [LOC UK  ] voters , by defining themselves in opposition to [LOC LONDON  ] 00000604 003 OF 003 Labour’s foreign policy on [LOC Iraq  ] and involvement in the rendition of terror suspects . 
Party leader [PER Clegg’s  ] main speech closing the conference appealed directly to voters dissatisfied with [ORG Labour  ] and the [MISC Conservatives  ] , telling them they should look to the [ORG Lib Dems  ] for change and new answers: “If you feel let down by [ORG Labour  ] and see the [MISC Conservatives  ] will never be a party of change , turn to the [ORG Liberal Democrats.” Clegg  ] positioned the [ORG Lib Dems  ] as an alternative party that would replace the “failed policies of [LOC Thatcher  ] , Major , [PER Blair  ] , and [ORG Brown.” Commenting  ] on the current financial crisis , [PER Clegg  ] called on [LOC Britain  ] to break with the past and embrace a new political order - though a new order he never successfully defined -- by supporting the [ORG Lib Dems  ] , the only party , [PER Clegg  ] said , open to new thinking on how to guide the country out of economic ruin . 
[PER Clegg  ] ended by calling on voters to take a “leap of faith” with the [ORG Lib Dems  ] . 
A leap , however , that the [LOC UK  ] media’s reporting on the conference argued might still be a jump too far for most voters as long as the [ORG Lib Dems  ] continue to lack a galvanizing issue or policy that demonstrates “new thinking” and would justify turning away from the [MISC UK’s  ] two main parties .
