( C ) [MISC SAUDIS  ] UNHAPPY WITH ZARDARI: Echoing [MISC Pakistani  ] interlocutors in [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] , in an introductory call with [MISC PolCouns  ] , [MISC Pakistani  ] DCM [PER Sarfraz Khanzada  ] ( protect ) characterized [MISC Saudi-Pakistani  ] relations as “under strain.” This was due , he said , to a lack of [MISC Saudi  ] confidence in the [PER Zardari  ] government . 
He cited a sharp reduction in [MISC Saudi  ] financial assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] , and said that the [MISC Saudis  ] had not provided “a single drop” of oil at the concessionary terms promised last year ( refs c & d ) . 
Instead , during 2008 , the [MISC Saudis  ] had provided assistance in the form of a single $300 million check , considerably less than in previous years , but “beggars can’t be choosers , ” he lamented . 
[PER Khanzada  ] opined that the [MISC Saudi  ] government appeared to be “waiting for the [PER Zardari  ] government to fall.” <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER NAWAS  ] FAVORED: [PER Khanzada  ] said the [MISC Pakistanis  ] are convinced that [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdallah  ] would prefer to see [LOC Pakistan  ] run by former PM [PER Nawas Sharif  ] , and were cutting back assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] to hasten this eventuality . 
[PER Nawas  ] “practically lives” in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [PER Khanzada  ] declared , claiming that [PER Nawas  ] had even been favored with reserved prayer space in the [LOC Prophet’s Mosque  ] in [LOC Medina  ] . 
Because Nawas’ daughter is married to a grandson of King Fahd , he has “become a member of the [MISC Saudi  ] royal family.” ( Comment: Embassy is not able to confirm whether this is true .

) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC AFGHAN  ] MEDIATION: [PER Khanzada  ] claimed that the [MISC Pakistani  ] government was not directly informed about the [MISC Saudi  ] [MISC Afghan  ] mediation effort , though they suspected that [PER Nawas  ] had been present , since he was in [LOC Mecca  ] at the same time . 
While the [MISC Pakistani  ] government did not oppose such talks in principle , they believe they have little chance of succeeding without [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] participation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Khanzada’s remarks track with reporting from [LOC Islamabad  ] and [LOC Washington  ] regarding [MISC Pakistani  ] concerns about deteriorating relations with the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
While our [MISC Saudi  ] interlocutors tend to be less forthcoming , they’ve made no secret of their reservations regarding [PER Asif Zardari  ] . 
Nevertheless , officials continue to insist that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] supports efforts to stabilize [LOC Pakistan  ] , and we expect that [MISC Saudi  ] officials will participate in the next round of meetings of the Friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
End comment .
