REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] often speaks out publicly against government corruption , but the politically-connected elite has direct access to lucrative business deals . 
This commercial access can easily be cut off when individuals fall out of favor . 
The [PER Qadhafi  ] family and other [LOC Jamahiriya  ] political favorites profit from being able to manipulate the multi-layered and regularly shifting dynamics of governance mechanisms in [LOC Libya  ] . 
They have strong interests in the oil and gas sector , telecommunications , infrastructure development , hotels , media distribution , and consumer goods distribution . 
The financial interests of [PER Qadhafi  ] and his key allies present both opportunites and challenges for reform efforts in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Any reform is likely to be cyclical over the long-term . 
END SUMMARY --------------------------------------- Saif’s Call For Freedom of the Press Equals Net Profit --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As with many other regimes , politically-connected members of the [MISC Libyan  ] elite have direct access to lucrative business contracts . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] often speaks out publicly against government corruption and sometimes dismisses officials who are caught in gross improprieties . 
In some cases , it appears that falling out of favor politically can trigger the discovery of improprieties in business dealings that might not otherwise come to public attention . 
As reported reftel , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam’s [ORG One-Nine  ] group will reportedly start marketing foreign publications in [LOC Libya  ] in the near future . 
The [ORG Qadhafi Foundation  ] , Saif’s quasi-NGO , is hailing the move as an example of freedom and reform in the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The [PER Qadhafi  ] family will clearly accrue significant financial gains from having exclusive rights to distribute foreign press in [LOC Libya  ] , as well as effective censorship over any troubling articles that might appear . 
The [MISC One-Nine  ] group gets it name from the September 1 , 1969 anniversary of the [MISC Muammar Qadhafi-led  ] military coup that overthrew King [PER Idris.  ] ---------------------------------------- Oil and Gas Revenues Channeled to [MISC Qadhafis  ] and Political Elite ------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) All of the [PER Qadhafi  ] children and favorites are supposed to have income streams from the [ORG National Oil Company  ] and oil services subsidiaries . 
[PER Saif  ] is involved in oil services through [ORG One-Nine Petroleum  ] and other [PER Qadhafi  ] family members and associates are believed to have large financial stakes in the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Tamoil  ] oil marketing company based in [LOC Europe  ] and Oil Invest . 
[PER AbdelMagid al-Mansuri  ] , the former “director” of [ORG One-Nine Petroleum  ] , was responsible for the ill-executed [ORG “U.S.-Libya Economic Forum”  ] held at the [LOC Corinthia Hotel  ] December 2004 . 
The [ORG Forum  ] was viewed as a blatant attempt to tie up lucrative percentage deals for [MISC Libyan  ] elites looking for representative relationships with [LOC U.S.  ] companies . 
During 2004 , the internet-based publication [LOC Libya  ] al-Yown distributed information tracing a large number of sweetheart deals to [ORG One-Nine’s Oil and Gas  ] division [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in [LOC Scotland  ] , home to a well-connected [MISC Libyan  ] expatriate community . 
It is believed that millions of dollars are distributed to politically connected [MISC Libyans  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] expatriates via the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- [PER Aisha Competes  ] with [PER Saif  ] on [ORG Charitable Activities and Broad Commercial Interests  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Aisha Muammar Al-Qadhafi  ] , General Secretary of the [ORG Wa’atassemo Charity Society  ] , is patron of the December 4-7 , 2006 [ORG Infrastructure Libya: The International Exhibition and Forum  ] for [ORG Libya’s Infrastructure and Economic Development  ] implemented by the [LOC UK  ] conference organizer [ORG Montgomery and Associates  ] . 
Also listed as cooperating organizations are the General [ORG People’s Committee for Planning  ] , the General Board of [ORG Infrastructure  ] and [ORG Urban Development  ] , and the Inspector General of Housing and Utilities . 
At the same time , there will be a [ORG U.S.-Libya Oil  ] , Gas and [ORG Energy Exhibition and Forum  ] at the same [LOC International Fairgrounds  ] , also under [ORG Wa’atassemo  ] sponsorship , and coordinated by [LOC U.S.  ] company [PER Nathan  ] and Associates . 
Until recently , [PER Aisha  ] has been in the public eye based on charitable activities , sponsoring human rightsseminars and the situation in [LOC Iraq  ] ( with a distinct focus on the negative effects of the presence of [LOC U.S.  ] and foreign troops ) , signing up for the international advisory board for [MISC Saddam Hussein’s  ] defense strategy , and promoting social welfare for women and children . 
She now appears to be branching out into areas that will give her more direct connections with the energy and construction sectors , especially since the government has announced that housing development will the major focus of the 2006 budget distributions . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Aisha  ] was actively looking to branch out into other areas , perhaps because of her recent marriage to a Qadhaf al-Dam with additional business interests . 
[PER Aisha  ] is also reported to have financial interests in the private [LOC St. James Clinic of Tripoli  ] , one of the two most trustworthy medical facilities that supplement the unreliable health care available through public facilities . 
In addition to health care management and referrals to hospitals to [LOC Malta  ] and elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] , the clinic has an extensive aesthetic surgery practice. --------------------------------------------- ------ Competition Between Siblings led to Takeover of [ORG Coca Cola Plant  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The recent controversy over the [ORG Coca Cola  ] plant in [LOC Tripoli  ] also highlighted [PER Qadhafi  ] family involvement in commercial enterprise . 
While three different sons [PER Saadi  ] , [PER Mohammed  ] and [PER Mutassim  ] , were all rumored to be fighting at different points over who had the right to the representative license , the dispute was supposedly argued before the courts and resolved through mediation . 
The very twisted tale of the [ORG Coke  ] franchise , reported in [LOC Tripoli  ] 53 , continues to confound the local business and diplomatic community attempts to ascertain exactly what interests are in play . 
One well-connected consumer goods distributor said that Qadhafi’s son [PER Mutassim  ] was involved in setting-up the [LOC Coca-Cola  ] franchise held by the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG Ka’Mur  ] group during the late 1990s . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Supposedly  ] , [PER Mutassim  ] lost control of many of his personal [MISC Libyan  ] business interests during the period of 2001 to 2005 when his brothers took advantage of his absence to put in place their own partnerships . 
[PER Mutassim  ] was recently spotted by Pol/Econ Chief arriving on a [MISC British  ] Air flight at [ORG Tripoli International Airport  ] , greeted by a small group of well wishers and protocol assistants with bouquets of flowers , then whisked off to the VIP arrivals lounge and into his vehicles without passing through customs or immigration . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] son [PER Mohammed  ] heads the [ORG Libyan Olympic Committee  ] that now owns 40% of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Beverage Company  ] , currently the [MISC Libyan  ] joint venture [LOC Coca-Cola  ] franchisee . 
The [MISC British  ] Ambassador to [LOC Libya  ] reported his sources attributed the resolution to a deal whereby [PER Mohammed Al-Qadhafi  ] was prevailed upon to relinquish his/Libyan [MISC Olympic  ] Committee’s share of the joint venture and sign it over to the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Pensions Fund  ] . 
Another Ambassador chimed in that he heard it was sister [PER Aisha Al-Qadhafi  ] who mediated the dispute between the two brothers and got [PER Mohammed  ] out of the soda business . 
If [MISC Libyan  ] government officials are asked about the [ORG Coca Cola  ] case , the standard response is that the government was making sure that all the proper licenses and registrations were in place. ---------------------------------------- [ORG Telecommunications Controlled  ] by [PER Mohammed  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Mohammed  ] , who has plenty to keep him busy through his control of the General Post and [ORG Telecommunications Committee  ] , has major input over any telecomm or internet service . 
Frequent [ORG USLO  ] requests over the last two years to meet with the [ORG GPTC  ] have been ignored by the [MISC Libyan  ] government , even requests for meetings with senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials and [ORG Congressional  ] delegations . 
Several [LOC U.S.  ] companies are actively pursuing contracts to provide a much-needed upgrade to the local telecommunications network , but the [MISC Libyan  ] government rejects any trade promotion activities for telecom through official government channels . 
Based on Colonel Qadhafi’s experience overthrowing King [PER Idris  ] and the recognized importance of controlling radio broadcasts in 1969 , and the role of mobile phone networking during the 2006 [LOC Benghazi  ] riots , the family would definitely want to preserve its strong control over the telecom sector. ------------------------------------ [ORG New City Planned  ] by [PER Saadi  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Saadi  ] is also branching out into infrastructure development . 
His functionaries contacted [ORG USLO  ] public affairs section for publications in [MISC Arabic  ] language on economic and commercial issues . 
Saadi’s staff then notified [ORG USLO  ] that he planned to establish “a new city in the west of the country , in the area between [LOC Zwara  ] and the [MISC Libyan-Tunisian  ] border . 
The new city will be under the management and supervision of the Engineer al-Saadi al-Qadhafi.” As Saadi’s staffers frame the interest , “he wants information on how the [LOC U.S.  ] can help with this matter.” That general area of coastline has an island that has been slated for tourist development in the last couple years without any subsequent action , perhaps because a large oil processing facility mars the view from the island , and also because outside investors can not get liquor licenses for hotels populated by foreign tourists . 
The [PER Qadhafi  ] family is already in the tourism business through the large percentage of ownership in the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------------------------------------- Consumer [ORG Goods Distribution Controlled  ] by [ORG Few Family Holding Groups  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Food distribution is also reportedly controlled by only four or five politically-connected families . 
There are no large western-style food markets in [LOC Libya  ] . 
There is small western-style market in [LOC Tripoli  ] and some smaller shops in the city that carry more imported items , but most of the neighborhood shops go to the distribution warehouses controlled by the people with strong government ties . 
The consumer products distribution are largely controlled by three merchants , including the [ORG Husni Bey Group  ] , a diversified holding company that runs a range of operations under the direction of [ORG Husni Bey’s  ] children . 
Bey does not characterize his company as politically well-connected , but has learned to expand operations through key alliances and he knows how to work the system to his benefit . 
More importantly , he knows how to recover when his businesses get caught up in the financial interests of the more connected political elite . 
The [ORG Akida Group  ] , run by the Akak family , is rumored to have close ties to the ruling regime and it runs a virtual monopoly over air conditioning equipment , heating units , and small appliances as the local [MISC LG  ] agent. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The government attempts during the 80s to instigate large socialist-style department stores failed ; the shells of the state enterprises sit empty around [LOC Tripoli  ] and other [MISC Libyan  ] cities . 
( At least one is rumored to soon be rehabilitated as a modern shopping mall for privately owned stores . 
) Starting in the mid 90s , people were once again allowed to open small businesses . 
During Eid holidays , [MISC Libyan  ] families buy new clothing to wear during the celebration and treat children to toys and sweets from small stores . 
The men tend to wear traditional embroidered wool robes produced locally or in [LOC Egypt  ] or [LOC Syria  ] , while women may indulge in new fashions imported from [MISC European  ] or [MISC Asian  ] manufacturers . 
During the January 2006 Eid , local women complained that the clothing variety available in the local shops was limited . 
Rumors circulating in [LOC Tripoli  ] claimed that Qadhafi’s second wife , as well as his daughter [PER Aisha  ] , own or have financial interests in many of the new clothing stores opened in the post-sanctions era . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Most  ] of the garments in local stores are imported from [LOC China  ] , [LOC Malaysia  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
Small boutiques have a limited supply of expensive goods imported from [LOC Europe  ] , and these enterprises in particular seem to have the financial backing of people with strong ties to the ruling elite. ------------------------------------------ [MISC Qadhafi Incorporated Lifestyle  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] himself keeps a low profile in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
The [MISC Bab  ] al-Azizia compound has facilities for banquets and other public events , but it is not lavish in any way compared with the ostentation of the [LOC Gulf  ] oil state families or [PER Hariri  ] clan . 
Qadhafi’s wife travels by chartered jet in [LOC Libya  ] , with a motorcade of [MISC Mercedes  ] waiting to pick her up at the airport and take her to the destination , but her movements are limited and discrete . 
She hosted a banquet for diplomatic women in the [MISC Bab  ] al-Azizia compound on the occasion of the al-Fatah ( Revolution ) holiday in September that was festive but not extravagant . 
Since the family keeps a tight control on the media and most of the [MISC Qadhafi  ] children spending excesses take place outside [LOC Libya  ] , there is not much public reaction to the coffers of [ORG Qadhafi Inc  ] . 
Compared to egregious pillaging of State coffers elsewhere in [LOC Africa  ] , or the lavish spending of [MISC Gulf Arabs  ] , the [MISC Libyans  ] don’t see much to complain about in their leader’s lifestyle , as long as he does a good job of making sure other people get a piece of the pie . 
And when [MISC Libyans  ] do complain , they are removed from access to financial rewards. ------------- Comment ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) The financial interests of [MISC Qadhafi  ] and his key allies present opportunites and challenges for reform efforts in [LOC Libya  ] . 
At a minimum , it seems safe to say that reform will have its ups and downs over the long-term , as individual , regime and national interests come into play . 
If and when foreign publications do become available in [LOC Libya  ] , there will be a financial gain for [LOC Saif  ] . 
At the same time , the family will still have control over monitoring what information is released to the public . 
Over the long term , demand for more outside information would inevitably create pressure for open access and more press freedom . 
Similarly , [LOC Libya  ] has a stated commitment to moving forward with [ORG WTO  ] accession and joining international financial organizations . 
But it is doing so on its own timetable , a slow timetable . 
Reported septel , the General People’s [ORG Congress  ] just passed in April 2006 new agency and representation rules that run counter to [ORG WTO  ] principles . 
While the General General [ORG People’s Committee for Economy and Trade  ] has working groups actively revising legislation to prepare for [ORG WTO  ] accession , it will take some time to reconcile all the different structures of the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] government ( translation: “State of the [MISC Masses”  ] ) . 
[MISC Libyan  ] government officials have been telling P/E Chief for 10 months that the [ORG WTO  ] accession will be presented in [LOC Geneva  ] “in a few weeks , that only the translation has to be finished.” Institutional development is very primitive and the [MISC Libyans  ] have a cultural and social preference for elements of distributive economy , placing great value on financial rewards that flow from affiliation with regime leadership , security services etc . 
There was a shipment of BMWs delivered to the government in early 2006 , for example , and it seems likely that the young men driving them around town got the vehicles “distributed” through their affilation with different government entities . 
With regard to reform partnership efforts , there are the greatest opportunities to promote positive change by engaging in the [LOC Central Bank’s  ] efforts to establish banking controls and standards , partnering with the General [ORG People’s Committee  ] for [ORG Manpower  ] and Training on civil service reform , and cooperating with the General [ORG People’s Committee for Economy and Trade  ] in its [ORG WTO  ] accession efforts .
