End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On May 8 , Ambassador [PER Brownfield  ] met with [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Army Commander  ] General [PER Oscar Gonzalez  ] . 
The Ambassador voiced concern over extrajudicial killings and reiterated our interest in working with the [ORG Army  ] to eliminate human rights abuses . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] said the [ORG Army  ] is committed to strengthening respect for human rights . 
The [ORG Army  ] 's [ORG Human Rights Directorate  ] is focused on receiving human rights complaints and directing them to the appropriate offices , tracking and verifying human rights cases , managing human rights training for officers and rank-and-file soldiers , and facilitating cooperation with the [ORG Fiscalia  ] in investigations . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] said the [ORG Directorate  ] is not involved in the legal defense of military personnel accused of human rights violations , leaving this task to a non-governmental organization funded by voluntary contributions from military officers and headed by a retired officer . 
The Ambassador agreed that the legal defense of military personnel is an important issue , but said it should not be handled by the [ORG Directorate.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Gonzalez  ] said the [ORG Army  ] tries to maintain transparency on human rights issues , citing the [ORG International Committee  ] of the [ORG Red Cross  ] 's regular meetings with military field commanders and its semi-annual human rights reports to the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] and service commanders . 
He noted that the [ORG UN Office  ] of the High Commissioner on [ORG Human Rights  ] ( [ORG UNHCHR  ] ) also regularly visits divisional commanders to review reports of extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] said the [ORG Army  ] is extending operational legal advisors to the battalion level and is encouraging these advisors to meet with their [ORG Fiscalia  ] counterparts to familiarize them with military planning and operations . 
The [ORG Army  ] is also assigning liaison officers to both the [ORG Fiscalia  ] and the [ORG Inspector General  ] 's office ( [LOC Procuraduria  ] ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gonzalez  ] acknowledged that the [LOC Soacha  ] killings last September did " incalculable damage " to the [ORG Army  ] 's image . 
Still , President [PER Uribe  ] 's dismissal of 27 officers and non-commissioned personnel last October has led to a sharp drop in reports of extrajudicial killings , with the [ORG Center for Research and Popular Education  ] ( [ORG CINEP  ] ) reporting only one case since then ( see reftel A ) . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] added that he had just dismissed a battalion commander in [LOC Covenas  ] , [LOC Sucre  ] , for failure to exercise proper controls in an extrajudicial killing case . 
He noted that the [ORG Fiscalia  ] had just ordered the detention of seven soldiers in the killing of the husband of indigenous activist [PER Aida Quilcue  ] last December ( see reftel B ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador underscored our interest in promoting more effective rules of engagement and in strengthening the [ORG Army Inspector General  ] 's investigative capacity . 
Both measures would help eliminate human rights abuses . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] agreed these steps would be useful in improving the [ORG Army  ] 's human rights record , and said he would welcome other suggestions in this regard . 
[PER Gonzalez  ] actively participated in a May 11 meeting chaired by Vice Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Sergio Jaramillo  ] and [ORG Armed Forces Commander General  ] [PER Freddy Padilla  ] to discuss new rules of engagement and develop an effective training program . 
The meeting adopted the two rules of engagement ( [ORG ROE  ] ) concept--a more permissive set ( red card ) which allows for use of lethal force as a first option , and a more restrictive set ( blue card ) which allows for use of lethal force only in self-defense or as a last resort . 
The group called for the ROEs to be finalized by the end of May .
