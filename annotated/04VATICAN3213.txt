( C ) [ORG Holy See Acting Foreign Minister  ] equivalent [PER Parolin  ] told Charge August 18 that the [ORG Holy See  ] was on the same page with the [LOC U.S.  ] on most [ORG UNGA  ] initiatives . 
On cloning , Charge emphasized the [ORG Holy See’s  ] potential to influence [MISC Catholic  ] countries to support a ban on human cloning . 
[PER Parolin  ] emphasized the [ORG Holy See’s  ] agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] position and promised to support fully [ORG UN  ] efforts to ban embryonic cloning . 
He rejected the suggestion that the [ORG Holy See’s  ] [ORG UN  ] mission had sent mixed messages on the issue last year , insisting that their widely disseminated position paper was strongly behind a complete ban . 
[PER Parolin  ] suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] do more to make the scientific case for the possibilities of adult stem cell research as an alternative to embryonic stem cells as a means to build support for the ban . 
On human trafficking , [PER Parolin  ] expressed support for the [LOC U.S.  ] initiative to increase focus on child sex tourism , and suggested that [ORG Permanent Observer  ] Migliore might make a statement on the issue in his [ORG UNGA  ] intervention . 
Turning to economic issues , [PER Parolin  ] agreed with Charge that developing nations had to take responsibility for their own economic and social development , but insisted that internal initiatives had to be bolstered by aid from a reformed international system . 
End Summary. ------------------------------------ [LOC Holy See  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] on Same [PER Page  ] for [ORG UNGA  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Charge reviewed the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG UNGA  ] priorities with the [ORG Holy See’s Acting Foreign Minister  ] equivalent Monsignor [PER Pietro Parolin  ] August 18 , drawing on ref ( a ) points . 
[PER Parolin  ] offered strong support for [LOC U.S.  ] priorities on cloning , trafficking , and democracy , and support with caveats on the global development and [LOC Middle East  ] priorities . 
Embassy had shared points prior to the meeting , and [PER Parolin  ] offered the following comments. --------------------- Banning Human Cloning --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Charge began by thanking [PER Parolin  ] for the [ORG Holy See’s  ] recent strong statement against all forms of human cloning issued in the wake of the recent [LOC UK  ] decision to permit expanded cloning for therapeutic purposes . 
[PER Parolin  ] responded that the [ORG Holy See’s  ] unequivocal position on the issue was well-known , and noted the close agreement between the [LOC Vatican  ] and USG on the issue . 
Charge raised points from ref ( b ) , emphasizing the opportunity the [ORG Holy See’s  ] [ORG UN  ] mission had , particularly among predominantly [MISC Catholic  ] countries , to expand support for the [MISC Costa Rican  ] resolution banning all forms of embryonic human cloning . 
Charge stressed that an active role by [ORG Permanent Observer  ] Archbishop [PER Migliore  ] could be crucial to several countries , not least of all [LOC Poland  ] . 
After last year’s lobbying efforts , Charge noted , some countries appear to have been left with the impression that the [LOC Holy See  ] was willing to accept the [MISC Belgian  ] compromise on the issue . 
As it happened , the closeness of the vote showed that any such misconception may have been decisive. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) ( Comment: A [MISC Polish  ] diplomat accredited to the [LOC Holy See  ] subsequently told us that he had found the [ORG Holy See’s  ] diplomacy on the cloning issue last year “strange.” He said that in 2003 , the [LOC Nuncio  ] to [LOC Poland  ] had passed the [LOC Vatican  ] paper on the subject not to the [MISC Polish  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , but to the [ORG Bishops’ Conference  ] . 
This approach did not ensure maximum exposure for the document . 
Our contact was unaware of the extent of lobbying by the Nunciature this year ; in fact , before we spoke to him he had not been aware that the issue was to be taken up again . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Parolin  ] acknowledged that there had been some internal discussion within the [LOC Holy See  ] at the outset of the [ORG UN  ] deliberations last year on whether to support the [MISC Belgian  ] compromise , but he insisted that the [LOC Vatican  ] had rejected that position and gone full speed ahead for the total ban . 
He maintained that Archbishop [PER Migliore  ] at the [ORG UN  ] had been committed to the [ORG Holy See’s  ] position , and may have simply adopted “tactics” that were misunderstood . 
[PER Migliore  ] , he added , had hoped to avoid dividing the international community on the issue . 
[PER Parolin  ] stressed that there had been “constant communication” on the issue between [PER Migliore  ] and the [ORG Secretariat of State  ] . 
The [ORG Permanent Observer  ] continuously updated the [LOC Vatican  ] on his lobbying efforts in [LOC New York  ] , and advised which countries the [ORG Secretariat  ] should approach at the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
[PER Parolin  ] said he expected continuing close cooperation this year , and welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] suggestions on countries that might be most susceptible to [LOC Vatican  ] pressure. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Parolin  ] observed that while the [LOC Holy See  ] would concentrate on the moral side of the argument , the [LOC U.S.  ] might be able to sway some missions by being more aggressive in making the scientific case for alternatives to embryonic stem cell research . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] continues to believe that the scientific argument will likely be the most compelling for countries on the fence , and if alternatives to embryonic research can be shown to be credible , these countries will then have an acceptable foundation for supporting a ban on embryonic research. ----------------- Human Trafficking ----------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Parolin  ] , who represented the [LOC Holy See  ] and spoke at [LOC Post’s  ] recent anti-trafficking conference ( ref c ) , wanted to know more on how TIP would fit into the [ORG UNGA  ] agenda and what specific initiatives we would be pursuing . 
He expressed support for the [LOC U.S.  ] goal of increasing the international focus on child sex tourism , and suggested that Archbishop [PER Migliore  ] might make a statement on the issue . 
Charge encouraged this idea and went on to discuss further collaboration between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Holy See  ] on the issue . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] plans to increase outreach to seminarians studying in [LOC Rome  ] to raise the profile of the “demand” aspect of TIP -- an aspect of the problem that priests might well be able to address from the pulpit or in their mentoring/pastoral roles . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Charge also suggested that pastoral guidance from the [LOC Vatican  ] on trafficking could be a big boost for anti-TIP efforts around the world . 
He noted the usefulness of a 2002 anti-TIP document put out by the [ORG Nigerian Bishops’ Conference  ] , and guidance that [ORG Pontifical Councils  ] had published on other subjects ( e.g. , the [ORG Council for Health Care  ] on the pastoral response to drug addiction and abuse ) . 
[PER Parolin  ] seemed intrigued , and promised to speak to the [ORG Council  ] for [ORG Migrants  ] and Itinerants ( nominal lead organization on TIP at the [LOC Vatican  ] ) to explore ways of expanding [LOC Holy See  ] engagement against trafficking. -------------------------- Advancing Economic Freedom -------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to economic issues , [PER Parolin  ] agreed that developing nations had to take responsibility for their own economic and social development and focus on good governance and anti-corruption initiatives . 
In the Vatican’s view , however , there had to be a balanced approach to the issue , in which these internal initiatives were bolstered by expanded aid from a reformed international system. “The international community has a duty to help these countries , ” [PER Parolin  ] insisted. “They cannot do it alone.” Charge agreed that a balanced approach was needed , but suggested that [ORG UN  ] debates had not reflected this balance , focusing almost exclusively on the international institutions and largely ignoring the critical steps countries needed to take domestically to promote economic growth. ------------------------ Democracy , [MISC Anti-Semitism  ] ------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In reference to our other [ORG UNGA  ] priorites , [PER Parolin  ] said the [LOC Holy See  ] agreed fully with [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to promote democracy and build a greater voice for democratic countries within the [ORG UN  ] . 
He also indicated that the [LOC Holy See  ] would be supportive of a [ORG UNGA  ] resolution on anti-Semitism , noting that the [LOC Holy See  ] had supported the OSCE’s anti-Semitism declaration and believed a similar resolution at the [ORG UN  ] would be useful . 
Charge reviewed [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about anti-Israel resolutions and committees . 
[PER Parolin  ] acknowledged [LOC U.S.  ] concerns , but said there was an urgent need to revitalize the [LOC Road Map  ] and restart some form of peace process in the region .
