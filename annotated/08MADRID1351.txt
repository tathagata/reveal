Meanwhile , the country 's largest copyright management society has come under fire for its aggressive and allegedly deceptive practices in enforcing its members' rights . 
Recent GOS actions and declarations concerning internet piracy have attracted widespread media and public attention and prompted a small demonstration by anti-regulation internet users December 20 . 
The amount of recent activity on the internet piracy front appears to reflect growing expectations that some sort of regulatory change is in the offing . 
End Summary . 
IPR ENFORCEMENT MANUAL UNVEILED <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On December 11 , [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] Director General for Policy and [ORG Cultural Industries Guillermo Corral  ] [PER Van Damme  ] unveiled a [ORG Manual of Best Practices  ] for the Pursuit of Crimes Against [ORG Intellectual Property  ] . 
Coordinated by the [ORG Culture Ministry  ] , the [ORG Manual includes  ] input from the [LOC Interior  ] and [LOC Justice Ministries  ] , the Prosecutor General 's Office ( [ORG Fiscalia  ] ) , the [ORG National Police  ] , [PER Guardia Civil  ] , [ORG Judicial Council  ] , [ORG Tax Authority  ] , the [ORG Federation of Provinces  ] and [ORG Municipalities  ] , and copyright management entities . 
The [ORG Manual provides  ] background on the phenomena of [ORG IPR  ] and piracy in [LOC Spain  ] and provides statistics and charts on enforcement actions . 
It also provides a series of guidelines on how to investigate complaints , obtain and preserve evidence , and bring offenders to justice . 
While it refers to " crimes against intellectual property , " the [ORG Manual  ] is devoted specifically to copyrighted cultural content , without reference to patent or trademark protection . 
It addresses " top manta " - the sale of pirated or counterfeit merchandise on sidewalks and in informal street markets , concealed under blankets - as well as digital piracy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In addition to [ORG DG Corral  ] , [PER Jose Antonio Robles Garrido  ] , Chief Inspector of the IPR Crimes unit of the [ORG National Police  ] ; [PER Joaquin Delgado Martin  ] of the [ORG Central Secretariat of the National Judicial Conference  ] ; and [PER Jose Luis Perez Quintero  ] of the investigations and anti-fraud department of the Music Producers of [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG PROMUSICAE  ] ) spoke at the launch of the [ORG Manual  ] . 
In his remarks , [ORG Corral  ] said the [ORG Manual  ] presents the most common piracy problems , with suggested and recommended solutions to those problems and especially ways to coordinate among all affected and interested parties , from owners , rights-holders , and intermediaries to technical experts , police , prosecutors , and judges. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Perez  ] of [ORG PROMUSICAE  ] expressed appreciation on behalf of rights-holders for the government 's work in preparing the [ORG Manual  ] and its efforts to improve protection . 
He noted with satisfaction that the [ORG Manual  ] stipulates that peer-to-peer ( [MISC P2P  ] ) file-sharing and downloading without permission of the rights-holder of the material always constitutes some sort of infringing activity . 
The [ORG Manual  ] specifically lists , as a legitimate investigative practice , a police agent 's registering on-line with a false identity in order to gather evidence of unauthorized [MISC P2P  ] file-sharing. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG Fiscalia  ] 's [ORG Circular  ] 1 of May 5 , 2006 on Crimes Against [MISC Intellectual  ] and [ORG Industrial Property  ] in Light of the [ORG Reform of Organic Law  ] 15/2003 states that alleged IPR infringers are subject to criminal prosecution only when they act " with a profit motive and to the detriment of a third party , " a provision which many internet users and law enforcement officials have read as essentially decriminalizing [MISC P2P  ] downloads . 
Rights-holders complain that one consequence of the [ORG Circular  ] 's language is a reluctance on the part of police and prosecutors to act against unauthorized [MISC P2P  ] activity . 
Furthermore , numerous judges have rejected criminal complaints involving [MISC P2P  ] file-sharing on the grounds of no established profit motive . 
The GOS has thus far shown little interest in amending or clarifying the [LOC MADRID  ] 00001351 002.2 OF 003 [ORG Circular  ] , arguing that it is legally correct and leaves open to rights-holders the option of civil litigation when criminal prosecution fails . 
While the [ORG Manual  ] does not correct or even contradict the [ORG Circular  ] , rights-holders hope its unambiguous characterization of unauthorized [MISC P2P  ] downloads as always infringing may spur authorities to pursue such behavior more vigorously , and judges to punish offenders more often .

[ORG COPYRIGHT MANAGEMENT SOCIETY CRITICIZED  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Clara Mapelli  ] , [ORG Ministry of Culture Deputy  ] Director General for [ORG Intellectual Property  ] , the [ORG Ministry plans  ] to undertake a campaign to improve the public image of copyright management societies . 
These societies , which collect royalties on behalf of artists , entertainers , and other creators and producers , are widely perceived as rent-seeking social parasites . 
Many ordinary [MISC Spaniards  ] resent them for the " private copy levy " ( " canon digital " ) on blank recording media and recording and playing devices , which emerged briefly as an issue in national elections earlier this year. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The largest copyright management society , the General Society of Authors and Publishers ( [ORG SGAE  ] ) , has some 91,000 members and reported revenues in 2007 of approximately 380 million euros . 
[ORG SGAE  ] has come under critical media attention recently for an incident in late 2007 in which the society allegedly paid an undercover detective to crash and surreptitiously video-record a private wedding party in [LOC Sevilla  ] to gather evidence that the organizers were having copyrighted music performed without having paid the required fees . 
This led in turn to an expensive judgment against [ORG SGAE  ] for violation of the newlyweds' privacy rights , and to a series of articles in major media , led by daily of record " [ORG El Pais  ] , " aiming to expose [ORG SGAE  ] 's aggressive enforcement practices. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) At the unveiling of the [ORG Best Practices Manual  ] , [ORG DG Corral  ] was asked whether [ORG SGAE  ] 's methods of enforcing its members' rights constituted the sort of good practice the [ORG Manual  ] strove to encourage . 
He replied that enforcement of the law is the sole competence of duly constituted authorities , and that while private entities like [ORG SGAE  ] may provide the authorities with information and ask for their help in protecting their rights , they may not take the law into their own hands . 
Culture Minister [PER Molina  ] , likewise queried about [ORG SGAE  ] at his press breakfast ( ref A ) , noted that it is a legitimately established and well-respected entity with a long history , and which is entitled to defend its members' interests , so long as it conforms to the law in so doing ; otherwise , he averred , it may expose itself to legal problems . 
SPOTLIGHT ON DIGITAL PIRACY AND POSSIBLE REMEDIES <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) A series of recent GOS actions and statements ( see refs [MISC A-B  ] ) - e.g. , the launch of the [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] 's public awareness campaign ; Culture Minister [PER Cesar Antonio Molina  ] 's announcement that new anti-piracy regulations may be coming soon ; and Minister of Industry , Tourism , and Trade [PER Miguel Sebastian  ] 's remarks at the late November digital content conference ( [ORG FICOD  ] ) on the importance of IPR protection - have generated increased media attention to the internet piracy issue and possible remedies . 
Following its critical expose of [ORG SGAE  ] 's activities , [ORG El Pais  ] published an [MISC IPR-related  ] news article or op-ed piece every day during the week of December 15 . 
Contributors included [PER Jose Manuel Tourne  ] of the [ORG Federation for the Protection of Intellectual Property  ] ( [ORG FAP  ] ) , laying out the rights-holders' perspective ; [PER Miguel Perez Subias  ] , president of the [ORG Internet Users' Association  ] , arguing for total legalization of [MISC P2P  ] activity ; [PER Jesus Nunez  ] Banegas of the [ORG Information and Communications Technology Business Association  ] ( [ORG AETIC  ] ) , warning of the complications and perils implicit in graduated response regimes ; [PER Javier Ribas  ] of business law firm [ORG Landwell-PWC  ] , outlining legal underpinnings of a graduated response system ; and Secretary of State for [LOC Telecommunications  ] and the [ORG Information Society Francisco Ros Peran  ] , reiterating the government 's position that [ORG Internet Service Providers  ] ( [ORG ISPs  ] ) and rights-holders need to reach a mutually acceptable agreement that recognizes the competing rights and responsibilities of the different stake-holders . 
On December 21 , [ORG El Pais  ] published an inverview in which [PER Didier Lombard  ] , worldwide president of [ORG France Telecom  ] - which operates in [LOC MADRID  ] 00001351 003.2 OF 003 [LOC Spain  ] under the name " [LOC Orange  ] , " one of the four members of the [ORG ISP  ] association Redtel - expressed support for the implementation in [LOC Spain  ] of a graduated response regime similar to one currently contemplated in legislation under consideration by [LOC France  ] 's parliament. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) On November 20 , a group estimated at about 30 " cyber-activists " held a brief demonstration outside the [LOC Madrid  ] headquarters of the [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] - ruling party ) in favor of free , legal [MISC P2P  ] downloads . 
The demonstrators set up two computers on which they downloaded copyrighted material . 
Activists unfurled banners and waved signs with such messages as " Digital culture should be free " and ( playing on the [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] campaign slogan , " If you're legal , you're all right " ) " Be legal: Create , copy , share , modify . 
" The demonstrators' choice of the party headquarters was reportedly a reaction to the possibility of a more vigorous government response to internet piracy . 
COMMENT <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Fellow members of the [ORG Anti-Piracy Coalition  ] recognize that the copyrights management societies' bad public image sometimes hurts rights-holders' efforts to secure better IPR enforcement . 
According to [PER Jose Manuel Tourne  ] , the election-related flap earlier this year over the digital canon - in which [ORG SGAE  ] and similar organizations were portrayed as heavies - made the societies nervous about possibly losing significant revenues and thus reluctant to press the government too hard to amend the [ORG Fiscalia  ] 's [ORG Circular  ] . 
The most recent spate of bad publicity involving [ORG SGAE  ] could potentially damage the rights-holders' cause in the court of public opinion and strengthen the hand of the telecoms and the internet users' associations . 
At the same time , the lively debate in the pages of [LOC Spain  ] 's largest circulation daily newspaper and the demonstration may be seen as signs of expectations that some sort of regulatory change is in the offing .
