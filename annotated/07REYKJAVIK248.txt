[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
( C ) Pol Chief called the [ORG Icelandic Ministry  ] for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) on August 20 to alert the [ORG Ministry  ] to the rollout of a proposed Adapted Treaty on Conventional Forces in [LOC Europe  ] ( [ORG CFE  ] ) timetable in [LOC Washington  ] that day , and delivered reftel points and timetable in a follow-up meeting on August 21 . 
[ORG MFA  ] Minister [PER Counsellor Nick Hannigan  ] noted his appreciation for [LOC Washington  ] 's efforts to find a way forward on the issue of the [ORG CFE  ] and [LOC Russia  ] 's unmet [LOC Istanbul  ] Commitments , though noting that " the [MISC Russians  ] don't seem to be in a constructive mood of late . 
" He added that [LOC Iceland  ] 's delegation to the September 13 HLTF meeting would be prepared to discuss the timetable. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Post notes that [MISC Icelandic  ] ratification and entry into force of the original [ORG CFE Treaty  ] took over a year , though most of this delay involved translation of the proposed treaty into [MISC Icelandic  ] . 
The [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) opened its session that year on October 1 , <a id='par1991' href='#par1991'>¶</a>1991 . 
The actual time from the introduction of the treaty in the [ORG Althingi  ] [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] on November 25 , 1991 to its approval by the full [ORG Althingi  ] on December 14 , 1991 and ratification by the government on December 24 , 1991 , was comparatively short . 
Barring a need to completely re-translate an Adapted [ORG CFE  ] , it would be plausible that the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] could push through ratification during the upcoming October 1 - May 31 [ORG Althingi  ] session. van Voorst</pre></code>
