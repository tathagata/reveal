( U ) Please deliver the following letter from Deputy Secretary [PER Negroponte  ] . 
There will be no signed original . 
Embassy should also propose discussions with the Government of [LOC Armenia  ] in coming weeks . 
Suggested dates and team composition will be provided septel . 
Embassy [LOC Yerevan  ] is requested to report response. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( Secret/Rel [LOC Armenia  ] ) [MISC Begin Letter: Dear Mr. President:  ] We value our positive relationship with your government , as we explore a range of shared interests , especially an agreement on [ORG Nagorno Karabakh  ] and normalization of [LOC Armenia  ] 's relations with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
At the same time , we are dismayed by a serious and , indeed , deadly - arms re-export case . 
Secretary Rice , Assistant Secretary Fried , Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Bryza  ] , and Ambassador [PER Yovanovitch  ] have raised with you our deep concerns about [LOC Armenia  ] 's transfer of arms to [LOC Iran  ] which resulted in the death and injury of [LOC U.S.  ] soldiers in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Notwithstanding the close relationship between our countries , neither the [ORG Administration  ] nor the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] can overlook this case . 
By law , the transfer of these weapons requires us to consider whether there is a basis for the imposition of [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions . 
If sanctions are imposed , penalties could include the cutoff of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance and certain export restrictions . 
To avoid such sanctions , it is essential that you present compelling evidence that your government is now in partnership with us to ensure such transfers do not occur in the future . 
To convince the [LOC United States  ] that this will not happen again , we seek a written agreement from [LOC Armenia  ] , memorializing its intent to implement measures that will prevent [LOC Armenia  ] from becoming a source of weapons for [LOC Iran  ] or other states or groups involved with terrorism and/or weapons proliferation . 
Such measures include: -- Reform the [ORG Armenian Export Control Commission  ] so its members are full time employees who exclusively work on export controls ; -- [MISC Establish  ] , at each point of entry into [LOC Armenia  ] , [MISC Armenian  ] teams dedicated to detecting and interdicting dual-use commodities and other contraband ; -- Periodically accept unannounced visits by [LOC U.S.  ] experts to assess the work of the teams ; -- Harmonize [LOC Armenia  ] 's export control legislation with that of the [ORG EU  ] ; -- Update and make public [MISC Armenian  ] export control lists , incorporating the control lists of the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] , [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] , and other international control regimes ; -- Ensure that [MISC Armenian-based  ] brokers do not facilitate arms related transfers ; and -- Consult with the [LOC United States  ] on transfers to countries that are not member states of [ORG NATO  ] or the [ORG EU  ] , or participating states of the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] . 
We are prepared to send a team as early as possible in the [MISC New Year  ] to discuss this proposal further . 
It is my hope that we can work together to forge a positive outcome which provides your government the opportunity to strengthen [LOC Armenia  ] 's export controls and for my government to assist you in this effort . 
Sincerely , [PER John D. Negroponte End  ] text of letter. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Background: In 2003 , [LOC Armenia  ] facilitated [LOC Iran  ] 's purchase of rockets and machine guns . 
In 2007 , some of these weapons were recovered from two [LOC Shia  ] militant attacks in which a [LOC United States  ] soldier was killed and six others were injured in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The Secretary discussed our concerns with President [PER Sargsian  ] on the margins of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] , but he denied any transfer occurred . 
The direct role of high-level [MISC Armenian  ] officials and the link of the weapons to an attack on [LOC U.S.  ] forces make this case unique and highly troubling . 
These transfers may provide a basis for sanctions pursuant to [LOC U.S.  ] legal authorities . 
We propose a series of steps that [LOC Armenia  ] will need to take to prevent future transfers , which will be weighed in the consideration of sanctions . 
We hope to use the threat of sanctions as a tool to generate [MISC Armenian  ] responsiveness so that we will not be forced to impose sanctions measures. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The Deputy Secretary is writing to President [PER Sargsian  ] and indicating that a team will be sent to [LOC Armenia  ] to seek written agreement that [LOC Armenia  ] will take steps to ensure that it does not become a source of weapons for [LOC Iran  ] or other states or groups of concern . 
The team will also present additional information that will make clear why the [LOC United States  ] is convinced that the transfers happened and make it unreasonable for [PER Sargsian  ] to continue his denials . 
We anticipate that the team will travel to [LOC Yerevan  ] in the coming weeks , to provide sufficient time for the incoming [ORG Administration  ] to be briefed on the situation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Objective: Our objective is to prevent [LOC Armenia  ] from becoming a source of weapons for [LOC Iran  ] or other states or groups of concern , without derailing a possible [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] settlement . 
Embassy [LOC Yerevan  ] should seek to convey the seriousness with which the [LOC United States  ] views this issue and emphasize that the transfer of arms to [LOC Iran  ] and subsequently to terrorists in [LOC Iraq  ] , in particular transfers that resulted in the death of an [MISC American  ] serviceman , cannot be overlooked by the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Please contact EUR/PRA [PER Matt Hardiman  ] and ISN/CATR [PER Margaret Mitchell  ] with any questions or follow-up issues related to this case and slug any reporting on this issue for ISN and EUR .
