( C ) Summary . 
Ever since its victory in the 2002 general elections , rumours and suspicion have swirled around the ruling Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] 's ( [ORG AKP  ] ) " secret " [MISC Islamist  ] agenda . 
After more than four years in power , some doubters are relieved to find an [ORG AKP  ] that appears conservative , [MISC Western-  ] as well as Islam-oriented , reform minded and democratic . 
Others remain convinced that [ORG AKP  ] is determined to impose [ORG Sharia  ] law in [LOC Turkey  ] and undermine the country 's secular system once it gains control of the triple crown - the presidency , prime ministry and parliament - in this year 's double elections . 
The evidence either way is circumstantial , but the issue is central to [LOC Turkey  ] 's future . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's traditional secularists ( including the civil service , judiciary and military ) , opposition parties and even ultra and neo-nationalists are resorting to increasingly desperate maneuvers , including rumour and innuendo , to counter the perceived " threat " of an [MISC AKP-dominated  ] triumverate . 
Their concern is undoubtedly heightened by the realization that [ORG AKP  ] 's reform agenda threatens the established elite 's traditional , top-down control . 
To keep the public 's trust and minimize tension as [MISC Turkish  ] society evolves , [ORG AKP  ] leaders will need to continue to employ broad-reaching , moderate , balanced rhetoric . 
End summary . 
The Origins of Suspicion ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Those looking to brand the [ORG AKP  ] as [MISC Islamists  ] determined to undermine the [MISC Turkish  ] Republic point first to the [ORG AKP  ] 's religious origins and PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's political roots . 
[ORG AKP  ] evolved from [PER Necmettin Erbakan  ] 's [ORG Welfare Party  ] ( [ORG RP  ] ) , an [MISC Islamist  ] party founded in 1993 . 
Critics focus on [PER Erdogan  ] , who in 1994 as [LOC Istanbul  ] 's mayor , called himself the " imam of [LOC Istanbul  ] " and praised [PER God  ] that he was a servant of [ORG Sharia  ] . 
Later , in 1998 , [PER Erdogan  ] served four months of a 10-month sentence for inciting religious hatred by reading a religious poem at a rally . 
When the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] outlawed the [ORG RP  ] in 1998 , [PER Erdogan  ] and other [ORG RP  ] members formed the [ORG Islamic-oriented Virtue Party  ] ( [ORG FP  ] ) . 
When [ORG FP  ] was banned in 2001 for unconstitutional anti-secular activities , [PER Erdogan  ] split off from [PER Erbakan  ] and formed [ORG AKP  ] with more pragmatic members willing to work within the existing political system . 
[PER Erbakan  ] and more hardcore [MISC Islamists  ] formed Saadet ( [PER Felicity  ] ) Party . 
[PER Erdogan  ] moderated his rhetoric , making it easier for voters to turn to [ORG AKP  ] in the 2002 elections as an alternative to traditional parties , mired in scandals , corruption and an economic crisis . 
[ORG AKP  ] surged to power with 34 percent of the vote , one of the largest parliamentary majorities in [LOC Turkey  ] 's history . 
For the Defense --------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Those who view [ORG AKP  ] as reform-minded and democratic are quick to cite AKP-backed reforms that strengthened freedoms and democracy . 
[ORG AKP  ] legislation that reduced the military 's influence in the [ORG National Secuity Council  ] ( [ORG MGK  ] ) and eliminated military membership in the security courts and the [ORG Board of Higher Education  ] ( [ORG YOK  ] ) , among others , improved the civil-military equilibrium that had been heavily skewed toward military control . 
They cite as evidence of the party 's western-oriented , free market approach [ORG AKP  ] 's liberal economic policies , which have stimulated the private sector , increased foreign investment , reduced inflation and stabilized the currency . 
[ORG AKP  ] supporters argue that [LOC Turkey  ] 's traditional power centers ( the military , judiciary , bureacracy ) feel threatened by [MISC EU-linked  ] human rights and rule of law reforms that enhance individual freedoms . 
By promoting [ORG EU  ] membership , the [ORG AKP  ] is slowly introducing more balance into [LOC Turkey  ] 's strictly secular , statist society . 
Supporters maintain that [PER Erdogan  ] 's appointment of [ORG AKP  ] loyalists to influential positions previously held by secularists has generated resentment against the [ORG AKP  ] , further fueled by the party 's popularity . 
They frame attacks against the party as desperate measures by entrenched secularists who fear that further democratization will undermine their traditional control and the economic benefits they derived from state intervention in the economy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Opponents charge that [ORG AKP  ] only pushed a reform agenda [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000648 002 OF 004 as far as necessary to convince the [ORG EU  ] to begin accession talks . 
Even then , [ORG AKP  ] focused on those reforms needed to dilute the military 's power rather than those that might interfere with the party 's [MISC Islamic  ] agenda . 
They note [PER Erdogan  ] 's support for greater freedom to express [MISC Islamic  ] practices ( such as wearing the headscarf ) , and point to his failure to allow [MISC Alevis  ] , [MISC Kurds  ] , [MISC Armenian  ] and [MISC Greek  ] Orthodox communities similar freedoms . 
Suspicious that the accession process is just a cover for the [ORG AKP  ] 's anti-secular [MISC Islamic  ] agenda , some in the military and opposition are reconsidering the merits of [ORG EU  ] membership . 
[ORG AKP  ] officials admit reform efforts have slowed , but explain that [LOC Turkey  ] 's bureaucracy needs time to absorb and implement significant changes , such as the complete overhaul of the [ORG Penal Code  ] , [ORG Criminal Procedure Code  ] and [ORG Punishments Law  ] passed between 2002 and <a id='par2004' href='#par2004'>¶</a>2004 . 
They also note that parliament passed in November 2006 much of another major reform package , including legislation relating to minority foundations and schools , military audits , military courts and political party funding . 
In some cases , parliament has had to re-approve the legislation to overcome President [PER Sezer  ] 's veto . 
Circumstantial Evidence ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Conspiracy theorists and concerned secularists alike build the case against [ORG AKP  ] using persuasive but largely circumstantial evidence . 
Many claim that [PER Erdogan  ] has used [ORG AKP  ] 's parliamentary majority to weaken [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular educational , financial and judicial institutions . 
They warn that an [ORG AKP  ] troika of president , PM and parliament speaker would control the appointments process , transforming [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular system into something approaching an [MISC Islamic  ] republic . 
They point to [MISC AKP-sponsored  ] changes in the strictly secular education system to allow graduates of religious high schools ( imam hatip ) to compete for limited university seats and qualify for government jobs . 
Previously , imam hatip , like other vocational school graduates , advanced to the clergy or other appropriate professions . 
In addition , opponents charge that [ORG AKP  ] has undermined state regulation of private [MISC Koranic  ] schools by lifting age limits and extending hours of attendance . 
As a result , the number of [MISC Koranic  ] schools has increased significantly , with correspondingly less government oversight. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] is also frequently accused of trying to infiltrate the higher education system with [MISC Islamist-minded  ] professors and administrators . 
After some university rectors resisted [ORG AKP  ] efforts to introduce more [PER Islam  ] into the curriculum , [ORG AKP  ] opponents claimed the government began a harrassment campaign . 
Police arrested one obstinate rector in [MISC Van  ] twice in 2006 ; both times he was reinstated by court decision . 
Legislation creating 15 new universities gave the government authority to appoint the new rectors , rather than the usual procedure of approvals by [ORG YOK  ] and the president . 
The law , pushed through over President [PER Sezer  ] 's veto , is viewed as an end-run to allow [PER Erdogan  ] to select 15 new rectors of his mindset . 
Parliament currently is considering a proposal to establish another 17 new universities . 
[ORG Green Money Seeping In  ] ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While many acknowledge [ORG AKP  ] economic successes , some doubters flag the alleged influx of " green " money from [MISC Islamic  ] sources as proof of the real direction [ORG AKP  ] is taking [LOC Turkey  ] 's economy . 
[ORG AKP  ] opponents note that [MISC Islamist  ] capital is hard to track and question whether it is ultimately tied to more [MISC Islamist  ] policies . 
Increased investments from the [LOC UAE  ] and a promised doubling of trade with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] after the [MISC Saudi  ] King 's unprecedented 2006 visit raised suspicions among some western-oriented investors . 
The overall trend of increased foreign investor inflows actually counters insinuations of an [MISC Islamist  ] take-over of [LOC Turkey  ] 's financial sector , however . 
Investments from [MISC Islamic  ] sources pale in comparison to total foreign inflows and do not seem to be of economic or political significance. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Erdogan  ] reputedly has manipulated the political appointments process to place [MISC Islamist  ] bankers in key economic positions . 
Along with Finance Minister [PER Kemal Unakitan  ] - a former board member of one of [LOC Turkey  ] 's leading [MISC Islamic  ] banks ( al-Baraka ) - [ORG Erdogan  ] 's appointment of seven other al-Baraka officials to key positions in [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG Savings Deposit Insurance Fund  ] is cited as support for an [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000648 003 OF 004 [MISC Islamist  ] take-over theory . 
In 2006 , the PM virtually paralyzed financial policy when he tried to appoint an [MISC Islamist  ] as head of the [ORG Central Bank  ] against President [PER Sezer  ] 's firm opposition . 
( The compromise candidate has demonstrated independent decision-making since his appointment . 
) To round out the " damning " evidence , critics cite FM Gul 's background as a specialist at the [ORG Islamic Development Bank  ] in [LOC Jeddah  ] from 1983 to 1991 and his reported objections to state scrutiny of [MISC Islamic  ] enterprises . 
Packing the [ORG Court ------------------  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Erdogan  ] is also accused of staging a take-over of the judiciary . 
The [ORG AKP  ] pushed through legislation to lower the mandatory retirement age for technocrats , opening the way for [ORG Erdogan  ] to name almost 4,000 of 9,000 judges and prosecutors . 
In a stand-off with the judiciary , [ORG AKP  ] has threatened to refuse to implement high court rulings against the government for obstructing [MISC AKP-sponsored  ] legislation . 
Similar struggles between [ORG AKP  ] and President [PER Sezer  ] have caused [PER Sezer  ] to veto over 3,000 [ORG AKP  ] appointments and send over 100 AKP-backed laws to the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] for review . 
But for [PER Sezer  ] , [ORG Erdogan  ] would already be implementing his " secret " agenda , worried secularists claim . 
Economic reformers , including the [ORG IMF  ] , for their part , would be only too happy to see an [MISC AKP-inspired  ] change in the judiciary , which has consistently blocked forward-looking economic reforms. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG Erdogan  ] rebutted the secularists' charges in 2006 by noting that the [ORG AKP  ] hadn't been in power long enough to reshape the judiciary . 
Rigid bureaucratic controls on promotions and a 15-20 year career path for judges limit the influence of any particular government on the judiciary 's orientation . 
But critics note that [ORG Justice Ministry  ] budgetary control over the [ORG Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors  ] , which oversees assignments within the judiciary , gives the [ORG AKP  ] indirect influence that can have a long-term impact . 
The president appoints five of the seven council members . 
The [ORG Justice Minister  ] , however , heads the council and controls its funding , which could discourage council members from voting against the Minister 's proposed appointees . 
The most recent charge is that the Minister , by not attending [ORG Supreme Council  ] sessions , is preventing 29 judicial positions from being filled . 
[MISC Small Changes  ] -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] 's strategy to infiltrate its [MISC Islamist  ] agenda into [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular institutions extends to the municipal level and beyond , according to [ORG AKP  ] opponents . 
The party controls four of [LOC Turkey  ] 's five largest cities ( [LOC Ankara  ] , [LOC Istanbul  ] , [LOC Bursa  ] and [LOC Konya  ] ) . 
Measures by some [ORG AKP  ] mayors to ban alcohol on municipal property , establish women-only parks or equip ferries with prayer rooms are seen as [MISC Islamic  ] encroachments on the secular system . 
[ORG Erdogan  ] and other party leaders explained the alcohol restrictions as consistent with the state 's obligation to protect children from alcohol , drugs and gambling , rather than a religious proscription . 
Municipalities are authorized to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol on municipal property and near schools , religious sites and related locations . 
Of the 62 provincial capitals that have such a ban , 18 have non-AKP mayors . 
Of the 19 without alcohol bans , 14 have [ORG AKP  ] mayors . 
As another often-cited example of small but telling changes , critics note that employees at the [ORG Health Ministry  ] and state-owned [ORG Turkish Airlines  ] reported being questioned about their religious beliefs and attitudes toward the [MISC Koran  ] , an unprecedented practice . 
Internal Balancing Act ---------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG Erdogan  ] has performed a delicate balancing act to maintain unity within the [ORG AKP  ] , despite the sometimes conflicting interests of its competing factions . 
Many party faithful are pious ; keeping their allegiance is central to the [ORG AKP  ] 's hold on power but [ORG Erdogan  ] has won them few tangible successes . 
He has not upheld earlier pledges to lift the ban on headscarves in public buildings , though his strong objections when the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] upheld the ban in public schools resonated with the party 's more devout members . 
[ORG AKP  ] 's more conservation faction was disappointed by the failed attempt to criminalize adultery in 2004 . 
[ORG Erdogan  ] 's attempts to put loyalists into government jobs can also be viewed through the prism of rewarding the party [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000648 004 OF 004 faithful . 
The [MISC Jury Is Out  ] --------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment . 
To date , [ORG AKP  ] critics can only muster circumstantial evidence of an [ORG AKP  ] [MISC Islamist  ] agenda . 
Opposition leaders , some media outlets , the military and extreme nationalists have used this to play up fears that an [ORG AKP  ] triumvirate will allow [ORG Erdogan  ] to make significant , perhaps irreversible , changes that would undermine [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular system . 
Using dramatic ad campaigns and threatening rhetoric , they warn that [LOC Turkey  ] may soon have an [MISC Islamist  ] president with a head-scarf wearing wife ready to take the country back to the pre-republic " dark ages " . 
President [PER Sezer  ] , military leaders and the MGK chief have all warned [ORG Erdogan  ] against unconstitutional moves that might change [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular identity . 
The secular establishment 's concern that [ORG AKP  ] poses a genuine threat to [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular system is undoubtedly heightened by the realization that [ORG AKP  ] 's reform agenda threatens the established elite 's traditional , top-down control. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Those not convinced of a nefarious [ORG AKP  ] plan contend that more than four years in power have matured the party . 
[ORG Erdogan  ] has had to moderate his message to balance factions within [ORG AKP  ] and lessen tensions with secularists threatened by [ORG AKP  ] reforms . 
Much of the party 's success stems from its image as being less corrupt ( " [LOC AK  ] " in [MISC Turkish  ] means " clean " , a dubious claim for any party here ) and more effective than the opposition . 
Its record to date describes a center-right , conservative party with [MISC Islamic  ] roots that has modestly advanced [PER Kemal Ataturk  ] 's core principles of westernization and modernization . 
Some of the changes tied to that process will inevitably transform the traditional power balance and strengthen civilian leaders . 
To keep the public 's trust and minimize tension as [MISC Turkish  ] society evolves , [ORG AKP  ] , and [ORG Erdogan  ] in particular , will need to continue to employ broad-reaching , moderate , balanced rhetoric .
