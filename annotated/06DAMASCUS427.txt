He also noted that [ORG SARG  ] authorities now seem intent on identifying a few scapegoats to be blamed for the incidents . 
The [MISC Danish  ] Ambassador confirmed to us separately that the [ORG Minster of the Awqaaf  ] had inflamed the situation the day before the rioting , with his remarks at Friday prayers in a mosque . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , head of the [ORG Abu Noor Islamic Institute  ] and one of the most influential [MISC Sunni  ] religious figures in [LOC Damascus  ] , provided PolChief February 6 with his assessment of [ORG SARG  ] involvement in the run-up to the violent February 4 demonstrations ( and its reaction in their aftermath ) . 
He noted that PM Naji al-Otri several days before the demonstrations instructed the [MISC Grand Mufti  ] Sheikh [PER Hassoun  ] to issue a strongly worded directive to the imams delivering Friday sermons in the mosques of [LOC Damascus  ] , without setting any ceilings on the type of language to be used . 
[PER Hasson  ] complied with the order . 
( Note: Several [MISC Muslim  ] contacts have confirmed that sermons based on these instructions were delivered , criticizing the publishing of the caricatures of the Prophet [PER Mohammed  ] , and condemning the actions of the [MISC Danish  ] , [MISC Norwegian  ] , and [MISC French  ] governments . 
An [MISC Egyptian  ] diplomat reported that the sermon he heard was critical but not inciteful . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) PM Otri also instructed [PER Hassoun  ] and Minister of the [PER Awqaf Ayoubi  ] that if diplomatic representatives from the [MISC Danish  ] and [MISC Norwegian  ] Embassies attempted to deliver apologies to them and to seek their assistance in defusing the situation , they were to take a hard line and insist that the only way forward was for the PM 's of the two countries to issue official apologies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The banners put up in [LOC Rawda Square  ] were obviously put up with [ORG SARG  ] permission . 
When [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had attempted to put up banners in that area on a previous occasion , to announce some [MISC Muslim-Christian  ] dialogue effort , they were removed immediately and he was told it was a " security area " and he needed permission from the governorate of [LOC Damascus  ] to put up such banners because of all the diplomatic missions and protective security forces in the area. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that one of the key organizers of the march was [PER Ammar Sahloul  ] , a wealthy businessman ( money trader ) with close ties both to the regime and to the [MISC Grand Mufti  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suspects him of being an agent for the [ORG SARG  ] . 
He said that [PER Sahloul  ] had been one of the people involved in sending out text messages a few days before the demonstrations , inviting people to come. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) After the [MISC Danish  ] [ORG Embassy  ] was attacked ( along with the [MISC Swedish  ] and [MISC Chilean  ] missions housed in the same building ) and the [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] was torched , [MISC Syrian  ] security officers acted much more resolutely to prevent damage at the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's friend [PER Ayoubi  ] , the Minister of the [LOC Awqaaf  ] , was on the scene trying to calm the demonstrators and get them to disperse . 
[PER Ayoubi  ] told [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the senior [MISC Syrian  ] security officer then informed him " That 's it . 
Tell them to disperse or we will use live ammunition " to stop the rioting and to prevent them from storming the [ORG Embassy.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] assessed that the [ORG SARG  ] allowed the rioting to continue for an extended period and then , when it felt that " the message had been delivered , " it reacted with serious threats of force to stop it . 
He described the message to the [LOC U.S.  ] and the broader international community as follows: " This is what you will have if we allow true democracy and allow [MISC Islamists  ] to rule . 
" To the [MISC Islamic  ] street all over the region , the message was that the [ORG SARG  ] is protecting the dignity of [MISC Islam  ] , and that the [ORG SARG  ] is allowing [MISC Muslims  ] freedom on the streets of [LOC Damascus  ] they are not allowed on the streets of [LOC Cairo  ] , [LOC Amman  ] , or [ORG Tunis.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) After the rioting , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he was visited by representatives of several [ORG SARG  ] security agencies , including [ORG Political Security  ] and [ORG Syrian Military Intelligence  ] . 
He was summoned by director of the [ORG General Intelligence Directorate  ] [PER Ali Mamluk  ] . 
The tone of all the questioning indicates the [ORG SARG  ] is now energetically looking for scapegoats to blame for the rioting , said , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He said he surprised [PER Mamluk  ] by acknowledging that a number of students from his institute had participated in the early stages of the demonstrations but had withdrawn before the violence started at the [MISC Danish  ] [ORG Embassy.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Danish  ] Ambassador told Emboffs February 6 that he had met with the Minister of the [LOC Awqaaf  ] on February 2 ( and separately with the [MISC Grand Mufti  ] ) to explain the [MISC Danish  ] position and ask for help in cooling tempers . 
He noted that the while the [MISC Mufti  ] issued a helpful statement , the ministers reported comments on Friday in a mosque in the upscale [LOC Malki  ] neighborhood only served to inflame the situation . 
His repeated efforts to with the [ORG MFA  ] the days before the rioting to get beefed up security for the [ORG Embassy  ] proved fruitless , he noted .
