( C ) Sheikh Fayedh al-Shimerri , the Chairman of [LOC Najaf  ] 's [ORG Provincial Council  ] , a religious cleric turned politician and member of [ORG Maliki  ] 's [ORG State of Law  ] coalition asserted that [MISC Iraqis  ] throughout the country were growing increasingly frustrated with foreign interference , notably from [LOC Iraq  ] 's neighbors . 
He singled out [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] as the biggest culprits , but noted that a " mental revolution " was underway among [MISC Iraqi  ] youth against foreign agendas seeking to undermine the country 's stability , pointing to such trends in [LOC Anbar  ] against the [MISC Saudis  ] , [LOC Najaf  ] against the [MISC Iranians  ] , and [ORG Mosul  ] against the [LOC Turks.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Shimerri  ] echoed other interlocutors' concerns about a premature [LOC U.S.  ] departure from [LOC Iraq  ] and risks of a political and security vacuum . 
He noted that [LOC Iran  ] had formed the [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] ( [ORG INA  ] ) political coalition comprised of the [ORG Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) and the [MISC Sadrists  ] , among others , in an effort to bolster [ORG ISCI  ] 's image as the pan-Shia party of choice in the elections. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

END NOTE ) . 
Keeping the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Bogged Down  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Major [PER Uday  ] , a provincial military intelligence officer and [ORG Maliki  ] supporter , described [LOC Iran  ] as a threat to [MISC Iraqi  ] stability , commenting that the [MISC Iranian  ] government 's ( [LOC IRIG  ] ) goal is to keep the [LOC U.S.  ] bogged down in [LOC Iraq  ] in order to discourage [LOC U.S.  ] military reprisals against the [LOC IRIG  ] for its nuclear program . 
He commented that [LOC Iran  ] fears [LOC Iraq  ] 's potential influence in the region , and will continue to support local proxies to exert its influence and undermine [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" [LOC Iran  ] does not offer its support for free , " [PER Uday  ] noted , there will be a price to pay for each proxy in exchange for [MISC Iranian  ] support. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .

Joining the [ORG INA  ] will only undermine the integrity of [MISC Iraqi  ] security institutions as ISCI/Badr and the [MISC Sadrists  ] will try to fill key security positions with their own supporters , many of whom are unprofessional and sectarian , [PER Uday  ] cautioned . 
The [ORG Badr Organization  ] , heavily influenced by [LOC Iran  ] , continued to maintain a very effective intelligence arm , according to [PER Uday  ] . 
Many former [MISC Iraqi  ] fighter pilots who flew sorties against [LOC Iran  ] during the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war were now on [LOC Iran  ] 's hit list ( NOTE: According to [PER Uday  ] , [LOC Iran  ] had already assassinated 180 [MISC Iraqi  ] pilots . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Uday  ] also noted that [MISC Jaysh  ] al-Mahdi ( JAM ) elements often resort to bribes ( USD 10-20K ) to secure the release of supporters in [MISC GOI  ] detention and that the [LOC Najaf  ] anti-terrorism unit regularly receives cash offers to release detainees . 
He asserted that [LOC Najaf  ] 's police chief , [PER Abd Al-Karim  ] ( aka [ORG Abu Ahmad Al-Miyahi  ] ) , is a " former " member of [ORG Badr  ] with dubious loyalties . 
[LOC Najaf  ] 's chief justice , [PER Kareem Faroon  ] , a well-respected judge also alleged that the [MISC Iraqi  ] police were responsible for placing an [PER IED  ] close to the PRT base in November . 
" He ( police chief ) is a bad guy . 
After all , he is still part of the militia ( [ORG Badr  ] ) , " Judge [PER Faroon  ] asserted . 
Sistani: " What Do the [MISC Americans  ] Want ? 
" ----QDI>RpQd%'MkQQto pulse the cleric on his views about matters of political consequence . 
[PER Kelanter  ] explained that [PER Sistani  ] 's son , [PER Muhammad Ridha  ] , serves as the main conduit of information between his father whenever a religious/political message needs to be conveyed to [LOC Shia  ] imams in the country. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Sistani  ] does not allow [MISC Iranian  ] students to enroll in the howzeh ( religious seminary ) in order to prevent [LOC IRIG  ] infiltration , [PER Kelanter  ] asserted .

The [MISC Sadrists  ] ------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Regarding the [MISC Sadrists  ] , [PER Kelanter  ] recalled fondly his time as a student of the late [PER Muhammad Sadiq  ] al-Sadr ( [PER Moqtada Al-Sadr  ] 's father ) , commenting that , unlike his radical son , the late cleric was admired and respected by many [MISC Iraqis  ] . 
He Qthe late cleric was admired and respected by many [MISC Iraqis  ] . 
He criticized [PER Moqtada  ] for failing to capitalize and build on his father 's legacy . 
Al-Shimmeri also praised the efforts of [ORG Sadr  ] 's father and sought to distinguish between " good " and " bad " [MISC Sadrists  ] ; the former being adherents of [ORG Sadr  ] 's father . 
Major [PER Uday  ] believes the [MISC Sadrists  ] are politically weak and continue to splinter as former JAM elements form their own groups . 
( NOTE: Major [PER Uday  ] believes [PER Al-Shimmari  ] is a closet Sadrist despite his public alliance with [ORG Maliki  ] 's coalition . 
[PER Al-Shimmari  ] commented that the [MISC Iranians  ] had told the wayward [PER Moqtada  ] to stay-put in [LOC Iran  ] for the time being . 
END NOTE ) . 
Farmers: [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] Waging Economic Warfare --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Jabar Al-Garawi  ] , the head of [LOC Najaf  ] 's [LOC Farmers' Union  ] commented that most farmers support PM [PER Maliki  ] for his increasingly non-sectarian political message and success in improving security . 
However , he complained that [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] were waging economic warfare on [MISC Iraqi  ] farmers by flooding provincial markets with low cost/quality produce that are heavily subsidized by their respective governments. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Iraq  ] 's neighbors were pursuing such measures in order to prevent economic development , thereby forestalling the continued success of [LOC Iraq  ] 's new democracy , [PER Al-Garawi  ] alleged . 
These problems were further aggravated by water shortages due to the ongoing drought , the high cost of fuels , outdated farming techniques , and power shortages , he noted . 
[PER Al-Garawi  ] confirmed that the [ORG Najaf Provincial Council  ] had recently voted to ban the import of foreign tomatoes into [LOC Najaf  ] in an effort to bolster local producers . 
( NOTE: 60 percent of [LOC Najaf  ] 's labor force works in agriculture . 
The sector is the province 's most important revenue generating industry , followed by religious tourism . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Samira Al-Halawi  ] , an outspoken female member of the [ORG Najaf Chamber of Commerce  ] , having recently returned from a [MISC USG-sponsored  ] visitors program in the [LOC U.S.  ] , railed against [LOC Iran  ] 's pervasive commercial influence in [LOC Najaf  ] , noting that many Iranian-owned companies secure favorable contracts in the province by capitalizing on ties with local politicians . 
She also criticized [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians " for being ignorant and overly-reliant on clerics " for their political welfare . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [LOC Najaf  ] , as the epicenter of [PER Shia Islam  ] , carries significant importance for [LOC Iran  ] and its overall campaign to expand its sphere of influence in [LOC Iraq  ] and the region . 
The city is home to many [MISC Iranian  ] pilgrims and traders eager to profit spiritually and financially from the city 's religious and commercial offerings . 
There is general awareness and acknowledgment among many [MISC Iraqis  ] that [LOC Iran  ] 's influence , albeit a historic reality , does not always translate into mutual benefit for [MISC Najafis  ] . 
Many also acknowledge that [LOC Iran  ] will continue to capitalize on its ties to the city in order to foster greater socio-economic dependencies . 
The extent of its ability to influence the ways of the [PER Marja'iyyah  ] are more limited , particularly during [PER Sistani  ] 's tenure , given the clerical establishment 's unrivaled theocratic and geographic prominence when compared to its " sister city " [LOC Qom  ] .
