( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: The Government of Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) plans to take two steps - each quite pragmatic - to address the serious problem of settlers illegally clearing the [LOC Amazon Forest  ] and the challenge of settlers occupying public land in the [MISC Amazon:  ] The first measure - currently a proposal - would reduce mandatory reforestation of illegally cleared land along two major highways . 
The second , a provisional measure ( [ORG No.  ] 458 ) , establishes a program to grant legal title to occupiers of small and medium plots of public land . 
These measures could be an important start in transforming the [LOC Amazon  ] from a region where the vast majority of farmers are currently without legal title and/or are in violation of the environmental code . 
In this way , the [ORG GOB  ] can concentrate on the more predatory practices and actors who threaten the standing forest , rather than settling scores with the majority of farmers working land cleared years ago and not likely to ever return to forest . 
END SUMMARY . 
GREATER REALISM ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR REFORESTATION <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After months of disagreement among government officials , including Agriculture Minister [PER Reinhold Stephanes  ] and Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] ) , a committee made up of representatives from 13 ministries unanimously approved a proposal to change the rules concerning reforestation along two of the [LOC Amazon  ] region 's main highways ( [MISC BR-163  ] and [MISC BR-230  ] ) . 
This proposal would reduce the areas protected known as the legal reserve ( in which native forests must be conserved or reforested if previously cleared ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The proposal would apply to those farmers along these two roads who have cleared more than 20% of the native forest on a plot of land and so violated the current 80% legal reserve requirement . 
In such cases , those who have deforested too much will no longer have to reforest up to the 80% level , but instead just up to the 50% level . 
Under this proposal , approximately 700,000 total hectares will no longer need to be reforested with native trees and can be used instead for agricultural purposes . 
The total area affected by the change could potentially reach approximately ten million hectares . 
The proposal now goes to the [ORG National Environmental Council  ] ( [ORG CONAMA  ] ) for consideration and approval . 
The final step is for the proposal to be presented to President [PER Luiz Inacio  ] " [PER Lula  ] " da [PER Silva  ] for his approval , so that it can be promulgated as a [ORG Presidential Decree  ] . 
[ORG CONAMA  ] should have its final response by the end of [ORG March.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The proposal has drawn mixed reactions . 
[ORG Greenpeace Brazil  ] 's representatives have condemned the proposal stating that " it legitimizes environmental crime . 
" The [ORG Ministry of Environment  ] has responded that the change is the only way to shift from the current predatory model to a sustainable one . 
" We are giving more opportunities for farmers to comply with environmental rules , " said [PER Roberto Vizentin  ] , Director of Land Zoning at the [ORG Ministry of Environment  ] . 
STARTING TO UNTANGLE THE AMAZON LAND TITLE MESS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In another action intended to address deforestation in the [LOC Amazon  ] region , President [PER Lula  ] on February 10 signed [ORG Provisional  ] Measure [ORG No.  ] 458 for the resolution of land title issues in the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
This measure creates the Federal program called " [MISC Terra Legal  ] " ( [ORG Legal Land  ] ) , which will be managed by the [ORG Ministry of Agrarian Reform  ] ( [ORG MDA  ] ) . 
The [ORG MDA  ] takes over responsibility for land title registry in the [LOC Amazon  ] from the [ORG National Land Resettlement Agency  ] ( [ORG INCRA  ] ) , which has had a very poor record in this area ( See [ORG REFTEL  ] ) . 
Under this measure , [ORG MDA  ] will assume responsibility for land title registration in the Legal [LOC Amazon  ] region , which represents a total of nine states and 436 municipalities . 
It is expected that approximately 297,000 titles will be issued and titles for 67 million hectares of land will be legalized . 
[ORG MDA  ] expects to finish the process in a three-year time span. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The program only applies to individuals who have occupied public land ( other than those included in protected areas or indigenous reserves ) prior to December 1 , 2004 . 
Farmers occupying plots up to 100 hectares in size will have the title granted free of charge . 
A flexible criterion will be used for plots between 100 and 400 hectares in area , whereby the title will either be donated or sold to the occupier at a price set by [ORG MDA  ] . 
If sold , the land occupier will receive a three-year grace period before paying off the purchase price over a period as long as twenty years . 
For plots [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000244 002.2 OF 002 from 400 to 1,500 hectares in area , [ORG MDA  ] will sell them to the current occupiers at the market price , with payments stretched out over a 20-year period . 
For plots between 1,500 and 2,500 hectares , the occupier can opt to claim a part of the plot up to 1,500 hectares or compete for the whole plot at public auction . 
Plots over 2,500 hectares in area will remain with the [ORG GOB  ] , which may or may not decide to hold a public auction . 
Also , the occupier cannot sell or transfer title to another person for a ten-year period. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) All properties will have to comply with the environmental laws at the time of transfer and thereafter . 
A key requirement will be compliance with the requirement to preserve 80% of most lands in the [LOC Amazon Region  ] as a legal reserve for native forests . 
Environment Minister [PER Minc  ] said that this program is not just land registering , but is " environmental land registering . 
" [PER Minc  ] emphasizes the part of the measure that says that if the [ORG Forest Code  ] is not respected , the occupier of the land will automatically lose title . 
Occupiers will only receive their land title after they have complied with their environmental responsibilities , including the legal reserve requirement . 
Any indigenous lands , national forests or protected areas that were illegally-invaded will be taken back by the government . 
The new measure also guarantees that all the registered titles will be electronically monitored to verify whether or not the legislation is being followed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The first actions have already been taken by [ORG MDA  ] to start this program . 
Representatives from the [ORG MDA  ] are meeting with the governors of each of the nine states in order to establish the actions that will be taken to register the land titles . 
For the state of [LOC Para  ] , the state with the most ongoing deforestation , a specific state office for the program will handle this program . 
The [ORG GOB  ] estimates that the public auction process for these [LOC Amazon  ] land titles could generate up to [MISC USD30  ] billion over time. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT . 
[LOC IMAZON  ] , a respected [ORG NGO  ] , estimates that 53% of the land in the [LOC Amazon Region  ] lacks clear title . 
Straightening out land title in the region is widely viewed as a prerequisite for addressing the deforestation problem . 
However , [LOC IMAZON  ] criticizes [ORG Provisional  ] Measure [ORG No.  ] 458 because it rewards farmers with grants of small , illegally occupied plots rather than encouraging them to make use of already cleared and now abandoned lands in the [LOC Amazon Region  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: These two measures signal a more practical approach to addressing the underlying problems in the [LOC Amazon  ] , where a majority of the farmers are occupying public land and/or have cleared more than the 20% of their land permitted by the [ORG Forest Code  ] . 
The first measure should create an incentive for farmers along two major highways to at least keep a 50% legal reserve , which is certainly easier to comply with than an 80% reserve . 
The second provides a trade off , the pre-2004 occupiers will receive title to the land , but now must meet the [ORG Forest Code  ] requirements . 
Land title registration has been a historical problem in the [LOC Amazon Region  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] shows a new flexibility and willingness to solve the problem . 
Both these measures will require better monitoring and enforcement of environmental rules to make a significant change in the culture of predatory practices . 
The government 's weak monitoring and enforcement to date has given farmers in the [LOC Amazon Region  ] little reason to care whether they have legal title or are complying with environmental rules . 
END COMMENT .
