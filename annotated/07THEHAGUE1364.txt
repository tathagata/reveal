( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During his meetings with [MISC Dutch  ] officials on July 13 , Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for [MISC European  ] and [ORG NATO Policy  ] Daniel [PER Fata  ] discussed the [MISC Dutch  ] decision on whether to extend in some capacity its [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] officials were receptive to [PER Fata  ] 's suggestion of an [ORG ISAF  ] " " campaign plan " " to better link [MISC Afghan  ] Government priorities with [ORG ISAF  ] 's [ORG Operations Plan  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] officials expressed appreciation for the extension of [LOC U.S.  ] helicopter support to January 2008 , and [PER Fata  ] stressed the importance for the [MISC Dutch  ] and other Allies to solve this potential helicopter support shortfall . 
Other issues discussed included [MISC OEF/ISAF  ] command and control issues , the importance of strategic communication , and the [ORG EU  ] training mission to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , as well as [LOC Kosovo  ] and [ORG NATO  ] AWACS aircraft re-engining . 
[MISC Dutch  ] officials also raised a draft letter from [MISC Regional Command-South  ] contributors to the [MISC Afghan  ] Government requesting increased access to detainees for the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Independent Human Rights Council  ] . 
End summary . 
Meeting with [ORG MFA Deputy Political  ] Director ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Fata  ] met with [ORG MFA Deputy Political  ] Director [PER Wim Geerts  ] on July 13 . 
Per reftel , [PER Geerts  ] reported that the six key ministers closely involved with the debate over whether to extend the [ORG Dutch ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] gave [MISC Dutch  ] officials the " " greenlight " " to begin informal consultations with [ORG NATO  ] on extension options . 
Meeting with Vice CHOD ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Fata  ] met with the [MISC Dutch  ] Vice Chief of Defense ( [ORG VCHOD  ] ) , Lieutenant General [PER Rob Bertholee  ] on July 13 . 
The Director for Plans and [ORG Policy  ] , [ORG Rear Admiral  ] [PER Matthieu Borsboom  ] , and the Deputy Chief for [ORG International Military Cooperation  ] , Colonel [PER Arie Vermeij  ] also were in attendance. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) AWACS re-engining: [PER Fata  ] said [MISC Dutch  ] MOD State Secretary [PER Cees van der Knaap  ] recently raised with Deputy Secretary of Defense [PER Gordon England  ] the issue of re-engining [ORG NATO  ] AWACS aircraft based out of [LOC Geilenkirchen  ] , [LOC Germany  ] to reduce noise pollution in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
[PER Fata  ] reiterated that the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Air Force  ] has no requirement to re-engine these aircraft ; a surplus of original engines makes re-engining even less cost-effective . 
[PER Fata  ] added , however , that if the [MISC Dutch  ] could successfully make the case at [ORG NATO  ] that the aircraft must be re-engined in order to reduce noise complaints , then the [LOC U.S.  ] would not stand in the way . 
[ORG VCHOD  ] understood the [LOC U.S.  ] position , but said the issue was of high interest in [LOC Parliament  ] , and therefore would not go away. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG ISAF Extension  ] in Afghanistan: [ORG VCHOD  ] emphasized the decision to extend was " " political " " in nature ; there is no reason not to extend from the military perspective . 
He explained that in the [MISC Dutch  ] political process , [LOC Parliament  ] wants to be " " deeply involved " " before , during , and after a decision has been made . 
[ORG VCHOD  ] emphasized that the current two-year mandate until August 2008 will not be affected by the current debate . 
But the possibility of extending beyond the current mandate must be debated and decided now in order for requisite military and financial planning to take place in the event of a decision to extend. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG VCHOD  ] mentioned four basic extension options: withdrawal following termination of the current mission 's mandate , with [ORG NATO  ] determining who will take over ; partnering with other Allies and stepping down as the lead ; remaining in [LOC Uruzgan  ] as the lead but in a more limited capacity with contributions and support from other countries ; or remaining in [LOC Uruzgan  ] as currently deployed . 
[ORG VCHOD  ] said he favored the third option to remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] as the lead nation with additional support from other countries ; he did not consider feasible the option to move the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to another location in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , such as in [MISC Regional Command-North  ] or East . 
He described the prevailing opinion within the government as " " uncertain , " " but was confident wide government support could be gained for an extension. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG ISAF Campaign Plan: Fata  ] argued the need for an " " [ORG ISAF Campaign Plan  ] , " " which he envisioned as a three- to five-year plan for how [ORG ISAF  ] helps the [MISC Afghan  ] Government achieve its goals . 
Such a document could be used to help explain the mission to host nation governments , plan for future supporting force structure , set benchmarks , and act as a blueprint for action . 
By providing a clear explanation of the mission and goals , it might also encourage other non-NATO nations to come in with contributions . 
[PER Fata  ] said that [ORG SACEUR  ] had already tasked [PER JFC Brunssum  ] and [ORG COMISAF  ] to work up a draft . 
[ORG VCHOD  ] supported the idea , and pointed out that it would provide better continuity within [ORG ISAF  ] , rather than having the mission description and goals change every time there was a new lead nation. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Helicopter Support: [ORG VCHOD  ] expressed appreciation for the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to extend its helicopter support in [LOC Afghanistan  ] until January 2008 . 
[PER Fata  ] replied that this is an important issue for [ORG SecDef  ] , and that [ORG SecDef  ] told Allies at the June [ORG NATO Ministerial  ] he expected the Alliance to develop a plan to generate the required helicopter support by the time of the next [ORG NATO  ] Defense Ministerial in October . 
[PER Fata  ] asked what steps the [MISC Dutch  ] were taking to alleviate this gap . 
[ORG VCHOD  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] supports the call for more helicopter support , but he did not think the helicopters could or should come from the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
In addition to Apache attack helicopters , he said the [MISC Dutch  ] have three [MISC Chinooks  ] permanently deployed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , while two additional [MISC Chinooks  ] had been lost in the deployment . 
The [ORG GONL  ] has agreed to purchase six new [MISC Chinooks  ] , but these will not be available until 2009 . 
The [ORG VCHOD  ] recently approved an increase in flying hours , but cannot raise the number of airframes . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] are looking at lease options , including for [MISC Russian  ] helicopters and fixed wing aircraft , but aircrews are limited . 
He added that " " eighty percent " " of all [MISC Dutch  ] helicopter missions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] are flown in support of other Allies . 
[PER Fata  ] emphasized that the [MISC Dutch  ] should be working with Allies to address this potential shortfall ; [ORG VCHOD  ] suggested [ORG NATO  ] was working to address it now. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) OEF/ISAF Issues: [ORG VCHOD  ] raised [ORG ISAF Command and Control  ] ( C2 ) , noting he was " " happy at this time . 
" " Previously there had been concerns about " " dual-hattedness " " blurring the distinction between [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG OEF  ] , but he could " " live " " with the current arrangement . 
From an [ORG ISAF  ] perspective , he said , there must be coordination , not command and control , with [ORG OEF  ] missions . 
[ORG VCHOD  ] stressed [MISC European  ] sensitivities to linking [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG OEF  ] -- a C2 structure might make perfect military sense but is politically problematic . 
He also commented that the [ORG COMISAF  ] headquarters structure is too large , and does not function as well as it could due to the lack of fluent [MISC English  ] capability by many officers on the staff . 
That said , all operational slots are filled by the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , which he claimed was a [MISC Dutch  ] concern . 
He emphasized that the [LOC Netherlands  ] is making a major contribution in the south , and therefore wants to have a general officer in an operational billet at [ORG COMISAF  ] headquarters , such as Chief of Staff or Deputy Chief of Staff for [MISC Operations.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Kosovo: [PER Fata  ] raised the necessity of contributing troops should the political process in [LOC Kosovo  ] continue to deteriorate , and asked if the [MISC Dutch  ] could make such a contribution . 
[ORG VCHOD  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] have only a few officers in billets in the headquarters . 
He was unsure of the [MISC Dutch  ] reaction should [ORG UN Security Council  ] discussions prove unable to resolve the situation . 
He suggested that if other countries are pulling out of [ORG KFOR  ] due to the inability to obtain a [ORG UN  ] mandate and subsequent [ORG EU  ] mission , it would be unlikely that the [ORG GONL  ] would make a decision to contribute additional troops . 
Interagency Lunch ----------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER Fata  ] attended a [MISC Dutch  ] interagency lunch hosted by MOD Director for General Policy Affairs [PER Lo Casteleijn  ] on July 13 . 
[MISC Dutch  ] attendees included MFA Director of Security Affairs [PER Robert  ] de [PER Groot  ] , and [ORG Rear Admiral  ] Borsboom. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG ISAF Campaign Plan: Fata  ] suggested a " " [ORG ISAF Campaign Plan  ] " " as a means to link the [MISC Afghan  ] government 's national strategy with the [ORG ISAF Operations Plan  ] . 
This relatively short document could provide a blueprint of goals and priorities for the next three to five years , while at the same time , provide a method to measure achievements and demonstrate success . 
The plan should be made public , and used to help explain to both [MISC Afghan  ] and [ORG Allied  ] parliaments and public what [ORG ISAF  ] is trying to accomplish . 
The plan could also help focus forces and resources , and pinpoint areas in which forces could be stepped up or down . 
Finally , the plan might provide interested countries a better sense of where and in what capacity they might make a positive contribution. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Casteleijn  ] supported the proposal , noting benefits from the perspective of the [MISC Dutch  ] extension debate . 
[PER De Groot  ] also expressed interest , but cautioned the plan not include explicit reference to reconstruction -- " " that is not [ORG ISAF  ] 's responsibility , " " he said . 
Focusing on [MISC Afghan  ] Security Force benchmarks , he suggested , would be appropriate . 
[ORG OSD  ] [ORG ISAF Coordinator  ] [PER COL Vogl  ] suggested reconstruction operations be included in some capacity , especially as many [MISC European  ] allies are making the case to their respective parliaments that [ORG ISAF  ] is providing a supportive role for reconstruction operations . 
[PER De Groot  ] said the campaign plan could be interpreted as an " " exit strategy , " " with eventual turnover to [MISC Afghan  ] authorities . 
He agreed with [PER Casteleijn  ] that the plan would make a " " political statement " " -- as such , it should also address collateral damage . 
[PER Fata  ] suggested that the [ORG NATO Senior Civilian  ] Representative might act as the plan 's " " validator , " " and work with President [PER Karzai  ] to articulate his goals in the plan. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Strategic Communication: [PER Casteleijn  ] raised the importance of [ORG NATO  ] improving strategic communication and public outreach . 
He said that press conferences are frequent in [LOC Kabul  ] , but such information is lost before it ever reaches capitals . 
He called for better [ORG ISAF  ] guidelines regarding reporting casualties -- for example , [ORG ISAF  ] confirmed that [ORG NATO  ] soldiers had been the target of a suicide attack in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] before [MISC Dutch  ] authorities were able to contact their families . 
While [ORG ISAF  ] had not disclosed the nationality of the soldiers involved , " " all family members know that the [MISC Dutch  ] are serving in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] -- we need time to break the news to the families . 
" " At the same time , de [PER Groot  ] said , the [MISC Dutch  ] understand that [ORG ISAF  ] needs to act quickly to counter the message of the [ORG Taliban  ] in the press -- these pressing needs conflict with one another. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Fata  ] mentioned the need to get the message out on reconstruction projects , and noted [ORG ISAF  ] laminate cards contain the latest facts on reconstruction efforts -- such cards could be better used . 
[PER De Groot  ] said " " data alone " " seldom does the trick ; the [ORG GONL  ] sends the latest figures on their reconstruction efforts to the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament , but such information is often dismissed as propaganda . 
Instead , he said the [ORG GONL  ] is working with film crews to interview " " ordinary " " [MISC Afghans  ] who are willing to express gratitude for the [MISC Dutch  ] mission , and hope that [ORG NATO  ] will stay . 
[PER De Groot  ] said President [PER Karzai  ] also has to do more to publicly commend [ORG ISAF  ] . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] have tried to tabulate over the past month how many times [PER Karzai  ] had spoken positively about [ORG ISAF  ] and could not find many instances . 
[PER De Groot  ] said [PER Karzai  ] often commends [ORG ISAF  ] in private , but never in public. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Helicopter Support: [PER Fata  ] reiterated [ORG SecDef  ] 's challenge that [MISC Allies  ] develop a plan to generate the necessary helicopter support by the October [ORG NATO  ] Defense Ministerial . 
He understood the [MISC Dutch  ] have limited capabilities , but questioned what the [MISC Dutch  ] were doing to work with others to solve the potential helicopter shortage . 
[PER Fata  ] noted that [ORG SecDef  ] may likely raise this issue with [MISC Dutch  ] Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] during his trip to [LOC Washington  ] in September . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] acknowledged the message -- " " we are carefully listening , " " but suggested this was a [ORG NATO  ] problem , and not just a [MISC Dutch  ] one . 
[PER Fata  ] argued the [MISC Dutch  ] should be taking an active role in talking to [MISC Allies  ] who are not risking forces in the south -- if these countries will not commit helicopters , then perhaps they might contribute financially for helicopter maintenance and support. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG EU  ] Training Mission: [PER De Groot  ] commented on the planned [ORG EU  ] training mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- while the mission may appear " " very little " " in comparison to [LOC U.S.  ] efforts , it represents a step in the right direction that could potentially grow . 
[PER Fata  ] related a phone call from [PER Robert Cooper  ] , the [ORG EU  ] 's Director for [ORG External  ] and [ORG Politico-Military Affairs  ] , requesting [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in providing intelligence and leasing NATO-interoperable radios . 
[PER Fata  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not want the [ORG EU  ] mission to fail , but the request was " " awkward " " when one considers how many [ORG EU  ] members are also members of [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER De Groot  ] suggested that the request could be viewed as an attempt to get the [ORG USG  ] involved with the [ORG EU  ] mission. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) [PER De Groot  ] passed to [PER Fata  ] a draft letter from [MISC Regional Command-South  ] contributing countries to the [MISC Afghan  ] Government requesting greater access to detainees for the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Independent Human Rights Council  ] . 
[PER De Groot  ] noted that all [MISC RC-South  ] contributors had approved the letter , except the [LOC United States  ] , and asked if any progress had been made in [LOC Washington  ] on reviewing the letter. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) DASD [PER Fata  ] has cleared on this cable .
