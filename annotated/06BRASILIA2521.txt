( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Traffic  ] Controllers' continued " work to rule " operation , which reduces the number of aircraft each controller handles to the maximum allowed by [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] standards ( 14 ) , has made flight delays routine in [LOC Brazil:  ] on November 27 , according to the press , almost a quarter of all flights nationwide were delayed by at least 30 minutes . 
The situation was worse over recent holidays , when the great majority of flights faced delays . 
The press also has reported the existence of radar blind spots and communication gaps in the area where [LOC Brazil  ] 's worst aviation disaster occurred: the September 29 mid-air collision between a U.S.-registered [ORG ExcelAire  ] executive jet and a [ORG Gol Airlines Boeing  ] 737 over [ORG Eastern Matto Grosso  ] state . 
The commander of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] , which is responsible for [ORG Air Traffic Control  ] ( [ORG ATC  ] ) , and the Defense Minister were forced to acknowledge during a [ORG Congressional  ] hearing that [ORG ATC  ] errors may have been contributing factors in the September 29 tragedy . 
In addition , the press has made sensational new revelations about four near-misses between aircraft in flight since May 2006 , two of which occurred since September 29 , which easily could have resulted in collisions and fatalities . 
All this has created a palpable public sense that [LOC Brazil  ] 's air traffic control system is in " crisis . 
" [ORG Air Force General  ] Paulo [PER Roberto Vilarinho  ] was relieved as Director of the [ORG Department of Airspace Control  ] due to the ongoing problems . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Flight delays have become the rule in [LOC Brazil  ] over the last two months as air traffic controllers have instituted a " work-to-rule " operation in the workplace , reducing the number of flights each controller handles . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] press has started reporting on flight delays along with traffic congestion reports in the morning . 
According to one source , a quarter of all flights in [LOC Brazil  ] were delayed by at least 30 minutes on November 27 . 
The work-to-rule operation was instituted primarily in response to the September 29 mid-air collision and controllers' longstanding complaints that they were over-worked ( reftel ) . 
That tragedy , along with subsequent troubles , has resulted in at least one bureaucratic victim . 
On November 26 , GOB spokespersons confirmed that [ORG Air Force General  ] Paulo [PER Roberto Vilarinho  ] , the head of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Air Traffic Control  ] , has been reassigned from his post as Director of the [ORG Department of Airspace Control  ] . 
Equipment Failures and Limitations ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Air traffic controllers have been voicing their complaints vociferously in the press , recently stating that equipment failures are quite normal . 
They have stated that all problems are reported to their commanders . 
Reportedly , one of the controllers on duty on September 29 and who was tracking the [ORG ExcelAire Legacy  ] 's flight from [LOC Brasilia  ] said that his computer screen was showing the jet 's altitude to be at 36 thousand feet when it really was flying at 37 thousand feet . 
The controller then passed the incorrect information to his replacement on the next shift . 
Both [LOC Brasilia  ] and [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [ORG Campos  ] air traffic controllers have rejected the possibility of human error. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Controllers unanimously pointed out that there are blind spots and communication failures in the area where the September 29 accident occurred . 
In this case , equipment for the [ORG Center for Air Defense and Airspace Control-1  ] ( [ORG CINDACTA-1  ] ) , which controls air traffic in [LOC Brazil  ] 's central-east region , where the crash occurred , [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002521 002 OF 003 very often indicates incorrect aircraft positions , and communication gaps also are frequent . 
In contrast , the [ORG Air Force  ] commander and the [ORG National Agency of Civil Aviation  ] , [ORG ANAC  ] , denied any gaps in [MISC Brazilian  ] radar systems. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The flight controllers reportedly said that they had problems communicating that same day with two other planes that were flying the same route as the [ORG Legacy  ] jet , one from [MISC Spanish  ] airline " [ORG Iberia  ] " and the other from [MISC Brazilian  ] airline , [ORG Tam  ] . 
However , after receiving a distress signal from the [ORG Legacy  ] 's transponder after the collision , an [MISC American  ] airplane from [ORG Polar Air  ] helped relay communications between air traffic control and the [ORG Legacy  ] , directing it to its ultimately safe landing at [LOC Serra  ] do [ORG Cachimbo Air Force Base  ] . 
The [ORG Polar Air  ] aircraft was also flying in the same region as the other flights , but at an altitude of 32 thousand feet . 
Four Previously Un-reported Near-Misses --------------------------------------- 5 . 
( U ) 22 in-flight " incidents " in [MISC Brazilian  ] airspace between from January to June 2006 , ( as compared to 80 such incidents for all of 2005 and 82 for all of 2004 ) . 
Other accounts note that there have been four in-flight near misses between aircraft since May 2006 . 
One occurred two weeks after the September 29 crash near [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
The press reported , based on interviews with air traffic controllers , that on October 15 , [ORG Gol  ] flight 1805 was approaching [PER Tom Jobim International Airport  ] in [LOC Rio  ] at the same time that [ORG Tam  ] 's flight 3831 was taking off with a destination in the region of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
The planes , flying in opposite directions , almost collided , passing within 60 meters' distance of each other . 
( International regulations reportedly mandate that 300 meters be the minimum distance between planes . 
) [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] are both within the [ORG CINDACTA-1  ] area of responsibility. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On May 19 , a [ORG Gol Boeing  ] 737 received permission from the air traffic control at [LOC Curitiba  ] airport to descend to a lower altitude . 
Unfortunately , a small plane was doing parachute exercises in the same place and the aircraft almost collided . 
This was considered a high-risk event by [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities . 
Another episode related by the [MISC Brazilian  ] magazine " Epoca , " involved a [MISC Varig  ] aircraft flying in the area of [LOC Manaus  ] . 
After the pilot completed a right turn , the [LOC Manaus  ] air traffic control tower advised him to keep his flight level . 
Seconds later , another plane 's shadow crossed the [MISC Varig  ] aircraft 's windshield , startling everyone . 
The other plane passed within 50 meters of the [MISC Varig  ] flight , according to these accounts . 
INVESTMENT IN FLIGHT SECURITY AND EQUIPMENT ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Lack of resources has been a contributing factor to the current crisis . 
During the past four years , a period over which [MISC Brazilian  ] air space saw a marked increase in flights , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] reduced the budget for airspace management and air traffic security by 25% . 
Between 2003 and 2005 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government invested 460.9 million reais ( approximately 223 million [LOC US  ] dollars ) annually in aviation . 
This was a significant reduction from the 2000 to 2002 period , when the average amount spent on aviation each year was 612.5 million reais . 
The non-governmental organization [PER Contas Abertas  ] ( " [ORG Open Accounts  ] " ) has also criticized the government for failing to invest the full amounts authorized for aviation in the budget . 
The draft 2007 budget for aviation , which already had been sent to [ORG Congress  ] before the present crisis started , calls for an eight percent reduction in resources allotted to the sector . 
The passenger volume , however , has been growing between 15 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002521 003 OF 003 and 20 percent per year over the last two years. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: Despite several initiatives announced to address the crisis , including the emergency hiring of new air traffic controllers , the recalling of retired air traffic controllers to serve on an interim basis , and making air traffic control a civilian rather than military profession ( once implemented , this would allow higher pay ) , this is a problem that will take a long time to resolve . 
It would also appear that the [ORG Air Force  ] will in time lose its control over the [ORG ATC  ] system . 
Meanwhile , passengers in [MISC Brazilian  ] airports will need to exercise a great degree of patience and all travelers , including our [ORG USG  ] colleagues , should be prepared for delays .
