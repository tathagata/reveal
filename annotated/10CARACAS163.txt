( C ) SUMMARY: Italy’s [ORG Eni  ] stands to become possibly the second largest international oil company operating in [LOC Venezuela  ] as a result of deals signed at the end of January , according to [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador [PER Luigi Maccotta  ] . 
It has agreed to develop the extra heavy crude [ORG Junin  ] 5 block , to build an upgrader and a 1,000 MW power plant , and to transfer proprietary heavy oil technology to the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) . 
The [MISC Italian  ] government is interested in the [LOC U.S.  ] perspective on Venezuela’s growing ties with [LOC Iran  ] and Eni’s CEO plans to brief [MISC NSA Jones  ] on the [MISC Italian  ] company’s activities in [LOC Iran  ] in a March visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador [PER Luigi Maccotta’s  ] ( protect ) request , the Ambassador met him February 4 to discuss the January 28 visit of [ORG Eni  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Maccotta  ] stated that the press generally covered all the points regarding the various energy deals agreed to by the [ORG Ministry of Energy and Petroleum  ] ( [ORG MENPET  ] ) and [ORG Eni  ] , which included: B7 A memorandum of understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) for the development of the [ORG Junin  ] 5 extra heavy oil block in the [LOC Orinoco  ] heavy oil belt ( and the creation of a mixed company ( 60% PDVSA/40% [ORG Eni  ] ) . o The mixed company expects to produce approximately 240,000 b/d of extra heavy crude ( 8.5B0 [ORG API  ] ) . 
B7 An [ORG MOU  ] to create a mixed company to refine production from [ORG Junin  ] 5 and the [ORG PetroMonagas  ] joint venture ( a 60-40 split mixed company involving [ORG PDVSA  ] and [ORG BP  ] ) ( 350,000 b/d ) with an investment of $9.3 billion . 
The basic engineering would begin this year with operational startup slated for 2016 . 
B7 An [ORG MOU  ] for the development of a 1,000 MW combined cycle power plant at the [ORG CIGMA  ] complex in [LOC Guiria  ] . 
B7 An [ORG MOU  ] on the transfer of proprietary [ORG Eni  ] heavy oil production technology . 
B7 [PER Maccotta  ] disputed press reports that [ORG Eni  ] had paid a $646 million bonus to [ORG PDVSA  ] , saying that [ORG Eni  ] had agreed to a $300 million bonus , which will not actually be paid given that [ORG PDVSA  ] owes [ORG Eni  ] nearly $1 billion . 
[PER Maccotta  ] speculated that once these projects move forward , with the exception of [LOC Chevron  ] , [ORG Eni  ] will be the international oil company with the largest operations in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Maccotta  ] told [ORG Petroleum AttachC  ] ) following the meeting that Italy’s OPIC-equivalent agency , SACE , is not involved in the financing of the [ORG Eni  ] deals. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Maccotta  ] shared that the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] trip was originally scheduled for [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , but then “Honduras happened” and [LOC Italy  ] found itself on the “wrongside” of the [ORG GBRV  ] . 
At Minister [PER Ramirez’s insistence  ] , the signing ceremony was rescheduled for January 26 , but [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] changed it to January 28 to reinforce the GBRV’s need for [ORG Eni  ] . 
[PER Maccotta  ] shared that the [ORG GBRV  ] had rejected Eni’s proposed changes to the terms and conditions of the oil deals , but 30 minutes before the ceremony was supposed to begin , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER Ramirez  ] , “take it or leave it , I can get on my plane and move on.” [PER Ramirez  ] apparently used that half an hour to convince President [PER Chavez  ] to accept all of Eni’s proposed changes or risk losing the deal . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00000163 002 OF 002 [ORG Venezuelan-Italian Mixed Commission  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Maccotta  ] also previewed Italy’s agenda for the May [ORG Venezuela-Italian Mixed Commission  ] meetings . 
Of the 76 oil services companies located in [LOC Zulia  ] state that were expropriated on May 8 , 2009 , roughly 30 were owned by [MISC Italian  ] citizens or descendents of [MISC Italian  ] immigrants . 
( [MISC Note: No  ] compensation has yet been paid for these expropriations . 
End Note ) Additionally , [LOC Italy  ] wants to discuss [ORG GBRV  ] land seizures and approximately $1.2 billion in pending foreign exchange approvals for Italian-owned companies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassadors also shared current perspectives on the economic-political situation of [LOC Venezuela  ] and [MISC U.S.-Venezuelan  ] bilateral relations . 
[PER Maccotta  ] inquired as to [LOC U.S.  ] perspectives on the growing relationship between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] and noted that [ORG ENI  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX is expected to meet with [MISC NSA Jones  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] in March to discuss Eni’s activities in [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT: It is unclear what bonus [ORG Eni  ] really paid [ORG PDVSA  ] , but it is interesting that regardless of the figure , [ORG PDVSA  ] likely will not see any cash flow in the immediate future due to its $1 billion debt to the [MISC Italian  ] company . 
The timing of the [MISC Eni-GBRV  ] ceremony was also curious as it fell on the same day [ORG MENPET  ] received bids in the [LOC Carabobo  ] bid round . 
Perhaps Minister [PER Ramirez  ] needed to close a high-profile deal following the GBRV’s January 20 announcements of its failure to move the [MISC Total/Statoil  ] oil projects in [ORG Junin  ] 10 forward and the failed [LOC Mariscal Sucre  ] natural gas bid round . 
END COMMENT .
