( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Defense Secretary [PER Galvan  ] raised recently the possibility of invoking [ORG Article  ] 29 of the constitution to declare a state of exception in certain areas of the country that would provide more solid legal grounds for the military 's role in the domestic counternarcotics ( [ORG CN  ] ) fight . 
Secretary of Government [PER Gomez Mont  ] has alternately provided a different view , citing a [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision as sufficient precedent for providing the military the legal basis for its domestic [ORG CN  ] activities . 
Our analysis suggests that the legal benefits to invoking a state of exception are uncertain at best , and the political costs appear high . 
While the possibility of such a declaration cannot be discounted at some future date , the [ORG GOM  ] seems far from settled on the efficacy or need for such an immediate move . 
End Summary . 
Background and Context ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In an October 19 meeting with Director for [ORG National Intelligence Dennis Blair  ] ( ref a ) , Secretary of Defense ( [ORG SEDENA  ] ) General [PER Guillermo Galvan Galvan  ] lamented the lack of legal basis for the military 's domestic counternarcotics deployment as key to shaping the public 's perception that the Armed Forces lack the appropriate authorities to conduct such operations . 
He noted that [ORG SEDENA  ] is working to pass the [ORG National Security law  ] ( ref b ) , proposed by President [PER Calderon  ] in the final days of the last congressional session , to help shore up these legal foundations . 
Additionally , he mentioned that [ORG Article  ] 29 of the [MISC Mexican  ] constitution would permit the President to declare a state of exception in specific areas of crisis and give the military greater juridical scope to maneuver . 
In a later meeting , Secretary of Government [PER Fernando Francisco Gomez Mont  ] responded to questions by [LOC U.S.  ] officials on the [ORG Article  ] 29 issue . 
He contradicted [PER Galvan  ] 's view that the military does not have legal basis for its domestic [ORG CN  ] activities and cited a [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision as having already set precedent ( [PER Note: Gomez Mont  ] is almost certainly referring to a 1996 [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision that ruled the military has the authority to operate at the request of local authorities in support of policing operations . 
End note . 
) He implied that the invocation of [ORG Article  ] 29 does not have the legal urgency or necessity [PER Galvan  ] suggested , but did admit that the state of exception in places such as [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] " had been discussed . 
" He said that no decision had been reached . 
[ORG Article  ] 29 Text --------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The translated text of [ORG Article  ] 29 of the constitution reads: " In the event of invasion , serious disturbance , or any other event which may place society in great danger or conflict , only the President of the [LOC Mexican Republic  ] , with the consent of the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] and with the approval of the [ORG Federal Congress  ] , and during adjournments of the latter , of the [ORG Permanent Committee  ] , may suspend throughout the country or in a determined place the guarantees which present an obstacle to a rapid and ready combating of the situation ; but he must do so for a limited time , by means of general preventive measures without such suspensions being limited to a specified individual . 
If the suspension should occur while the [ORG Congress  ] is in session , the latter shall grant such authorizations that it deems necessary to enable the Executive to meet the situation . 
If the suspension occurs during a period of adjournment , the [ORG Congress  ] shall be convoked without delay in order to grant them . 
" What Would [ORG Article  ] 29 Look Like ? -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The terms of the state of exception detailed in [ORG Article  ] 29 are vague and offer little insight into how its [LOC MEXICO  ] 00003101 002 OF 003 invocation would play out on the ground . 
There appears to be a great deal of leeway for the President -- with the approval of [ORG Congress  ] -- to determine what kinds of guarantees to suspend given the nature of the emergency at hand . 
To paint a scenario: the [ORG GOM  ] could elect to apply the article in a zone of perceived crisis , such as [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] , for the period of one year . 
The decree could potentially suspend rights guaranteed in the first chapter of the constitution , including freedom of expression , freedom of press , freedom of assembly , freedom of passage , or some tenets of legal due process . 
The military , for example , might be granted broader detention authorities . 
The law does not explicitly call for greater military involvement , and [PER Gomez Mont  ] told [LOC US  ] officials that it is not martial law " in the way that you know it . 
" [PER Galvan  ] 's interest in the state of exception suggests two possibilities: that he envisions a potentially broader role for the military ( at the expense , perhaps , of cooperation with other insitutions ) , or that he is seeking a stronger legal framework and additional legal protections to back up the military 's current domestic operations . 
[PER Calderon  ] has already put the military in charge of municipal police in [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] and other areas in [LOC Chihuahua State.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The discussion of [ORG Article  ] 29 's application is highly theoretical . 
[PER Gomez Mont  ] , when asked whether a state of exception would imply the federalization of municipal authorities , acknowledged a " constitutional gray area . 
" He admitted that municipal governments could " be limited , " but said that [LOC Mexico  ] 's signature to the [ORG UN Human Rights Charter  ] limits how far the [ORG GOM  ] could go in suspending rights . 
The Limits ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOM  ] does not take lightly its use of [ORG Article  ] 29 . 
The [ORG GOM  ] has not , in fact , invoked it since when it declared war on [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , and [LOC Japan  ] during [MISC World War II  ] . 
The [ORG GOM  ] has even abstained from employing the measure during times of cataclysmic internal strife such as the 1968 student protests , the 1985 [LOC Mexico City  ] earthquake , the 1990s fight against armed uprisings in [LOC Chiapas  ] , or the 2006 [LOC Oaxaca  ] protests. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOM  ] 's hesitation so far to invoke the article is due to a number of factors , which are particularly relevant given the democratic context in which [LOC Mexico  ] now operates . 
Perhaps most critical , the article clearly stipulates that [ORG Congress  ] -- meaning both Chambers -- must approve the measure and its various permissions , circumvention of rights , geographic application , and time frame , suggesting that the President 's ability to achieve a state of exception under his terms would be uncertain , at best . 
Such a move would not be seen solely as a law enforcement procedure but as a carefully calculated move with significant political implications . 
President [PER Calderon  ] lacks an absolute majority in either the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] or the [ORG Senate  ] , and it is unlikely that his opponents would approve carte blanche significantly expanded authorities for the military or federal government . 
Indeed , [PER Calderon  ] instead might run the risk of having his hands tied by [ORG Congress  ] , depending on the vote and final details of how [ORG Article  ] 29 would be invoked . 
For example , the legislature might vote to allow the federal government to declare a limited state of exception in a crisis zone for a short period of time , asking that [PER Calderon  ] then return to [ORG Congress  ] to renew the mandate . 
This would give [ORG Congress  ] at least nominal oversight over the military 's counternarcotics operations , a role it has sought but not had up to this point . 
[ORG Congress  ] could also reject wholesale the article 's invocation , which would be an embarrassing public blow to the [MISC GOM.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Moreover , [PER Calderon  ] is negotiating with [ORG Congress  ] on other legislation that will better serve his counternarcotics goals . 
Proposed in late April , reforms to the [ORG National Security Act  ] would provide a firmer legal framework for the military 's domestic counterdrug fight , give the President the power to declare a threat to domestic security and deploy the military without congressional approval . 
It would also provide the military with greater intelligence authorities and powers over the state and local forces in the area . 
[LOC MEXICO  ] 00003101 003 OF 003 [ORG Institutional Revolutionary Party  ] ( [ORG PRI  ] ) contacts have indicated that they would prefer to limit presidential authority than expand it , and PRD Senator and member of the [ORG Justice Committee  ] , [PER Tomas Torres  ] , has told [PER Poloff  ] that the reform as written is unlikely to pass . 
Nevertheless , such legislation permanently codifying the military 's role and the President 's authority to deploy it would certainly be of greater use to [PER Calderon  ] than would be a watered down state of exception. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Gomez Mont  ] told [LOC U.S.  ] officials during the October 19 exchange that the invocation of [ORG Article  ] 29 would be " highly controversial , " and downplayed its immediate necessity . 
The public relations cost of declaring a state of exception in places like [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] would likely be high , and almost certainly would draw increased scrutiny from the international and domestic human rights community . 
Moreover , a defeat by [ORG Congress  ] of an [ORG Article  ] 29 proposal would be seen as a public rejection of [PER Calderon  ] 's counternarcotics strategy . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Benefits to an [ORG Article  ] 29 strategy would be limited . 
If written correctly and approved by [ORG Congress  ] , it could give the military a temporary legal cover for its activities and perhaps allow it to focus more on operations and less on its critics . 
[LOC Notable Mexico  ] legal experts have envisioned the employment of [ORG Article  ] 29 only in the case of a " firestorm , " such as local or state governments rejecting military assistance in areas where the [ORG GOM  ] sees it as badly needed . 
[PER Galvan  ] 's views are more reflective of the military 's desire for legal protections on human rights and other grounds , than of any imminent legal or political challenges to the military 's current domestic counternarcotics role . 
Clearly , [PER Calderon  ] is looking for new tools with which to fight increased levels of violence in places like [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] , but any benefits he would gain with an [ORG Article  ] 29 state of exception would be undermined by the high political costs of such an approach . 
With questionable support in [ORG Congress  ] and limited political capital , he would put at risk popular and congressional support that has given the military broad room to maneuver in the current legal framework . 
While the possibility of the declaration of a state of exception cannot be discounted at some future date , the [ORG GOM  ] seems far from settled on the efficacy or need for such an immediate move .
