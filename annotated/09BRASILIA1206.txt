( U ) [MISC Summary:  ] The head of the [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] , s ( [ORG DPF  ] ) intelligence division admitted publicly during a [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , hearing on terrorism July 7 that an individual arrested in April on hate crimes-related charges was in fact linked to al [PER Qaeda  ] ( [ORG AQ  ] ) , the first time a [MISC Brazilian  ] government official has gone on record admitting this link . 
The admission followed earlier denials by non-DPF [MISC Brazilian  ] government officials responding to press reports that the individual was linked to the terrorist group . 
During the hearing , Minister [PER Jorge Felix  ] , head of the Office of the Presidency , s [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] ( a combination [ORG DNI  ] , [ORG ONDCP  ] , with some [MISC NSC-like  ] attributes ) , stuck to the usual script , despite the admission , and denied there was any evidence that terrorists had or would be interested in establishing a presence in [LOC Brazil  ] , even as he asserted that [LOC Brazil  ] remained vigilant to the threat . 
As part of this vigilance , [PER Felix  ] reported during the hearing that [ORG GSI  ] had created a new counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) -focused entity within its structure as well as an interagency working group to draft a new national security law , which could end up addressing [LOC Brazil  ] , s single biggest inadequacy when it comes to its [LOC CT  ] efforts: lack of [LOC CT  ] legislation . 
While [PER Felix  ] , the [ORG DPF  ] , and members of [ORG Congress  ] agreed on the need for [LOC CT  ] legislation , there is a lack of will in the GOB to expend the political capital to do push it , as a result of ideological and historical concerns that such legislation might be used against legitimate opposition and social movements . 
Concerned to maintain [LOC Brazil  ] , s position as a racially , ethnically , and religiously harmonious society , the GOB is hesitant to engage in what it thinks might be perceived as provocative foreign and domestic policy . 
Nonetheless , post believes that the good operational cooperation on [LOC CT  ] between our law enforcement agencies enjoy and [LOC Brazil  ] , s general commitment to international counterterrorism norms provide a basis to engage the GOB and spur gradual change in [LOC Brazil  ] , s mindset . 
In light of [LOC Brazil  ] , s growing global clout , this could pay dividends well beyond [LOC Brazil  ] .

( SBU ) During a 7 July hearing of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies Organized Crime and Public Security Committee  ] , [PER Daniel Lorenz  ] de [PER Azevedo  ] , head of the [ORG DPF  ] , s intelligence division publicly admitted for the first time that the [ORG DPF  ] believed the individual arrested on April 26 for hate crimes in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [PER Khaled Hussein Ali  ] was , in fact , believed by the [ORG DPF  ] to be closely linked to al [PER Qaeda  ] . 
As global head of the [ORG Jihad Media Battalion  ] , [PER Lorenz  ] noted during the hearing that [PER Ali  ] had performed duties for the terrorist group , from propaganda to logistics , recruitment , and other activities . 
( Note: In late May , the press started reporting on the 26 April arrest of the then unidentified [PER Ali  ] , s links to [ORG AQ  ] , which were followed by quick statements by the prosecutor denying that the individual had any ties to terrorism . 
That same week , during a meeting with [PER CODEL Thompson  ] , General [PER Felix  ] categorically denied the terrorism and [ORG AQ  ] connection , even as he noted that it was a [ORG DPF  ] matter .

) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Lorenz  ] further stated that [PER Ali  ] was not the first or only AQ-linked individual to have lived in or transited through [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He mentioned [PER Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  ] , s trip to [MISC Foz  ] de Iguacu in 1995 ( subject of a cover story in [LOC Veja  ] magazine several years ago ) . 
He further noted that the [ORG DPF  ] has monitored several other " extremists " that have transited through [LOC Brazil  ] or had taken up residence in the country. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - General [PER Felix:  ] We will never admit anything - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) During the hearing , [PER Felix  ] testified that it was the government , s belief that terrorists could potentially use [MISC Brazilian  ] territory for transit , to exploit its resources , or for safehaven . 
He further added that , even as [LOC Brazil  ] has maintained an aggressive posture to prevent such activity [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001206 002 OF 005 from taking place , " we haven , t seen any confirmation that such activity has ever taken place , even if the media claims otherwise . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Faced with questions from Members of [ORG Congress  ] who were keying off of [PER Lorenz  ] testimony , [PER Felix  ] added that [LOC Brazil  ] , s public stance regarding the presence of terrorism is part of a deliberate strategy on the part of [ORG GSI  ] and an assessment of what is in [LOC Brazil  ] , s best long-term interest . 
[PER Felix  ] noted that over the years he has had the opportunity to meet with officials from various countries at all levels , including those who affirm that there may be terrorists in [MISC Foz  ] de Iguacu and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , and to date none of these countries that make these statements , going back to the [ORG AMIA  ] bombing , have ever provided [LOC Brazil  ] with evidence that this is the case . 
He further added , with emphasis , that " even if a problem were to appear , we won , t admit that the problem exists . 
" According to [PER Felix  ] , this " denialism " is a posture that he believes will " protect " [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He observed that modifying this language could provoke actions by unwelcome elements and could set back a policy that , while it repudiates terrorism , seeks to avoid inviting or importing threats. - - - - - - - - - - Yet , Threats Abound - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Felix  ] characterized the theoretical risks [LOC Brazil  ] faces as pretty low . 
He added that , " because of our external policy , our domestic characteristics , our international projection , our image of a positive peaceful country with various ethnicities and religions interacting peacefully in harmony " there is little risk of attacks against [LOC Brazil  ] . 
At the same time , [PER Felix  ] recognized that the risks are not the same when discussing foreign structures within [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The situation in those cases is different , particularly when it comes to ideological or religious terrorism , which does not respect frontiers . 
He cited [LOC Argentina  ] , s experience , which suffered two attacks in the 1990 , s against its [MISC Jewish  ] community . 
It shows , according to [PER Felix  ] , that even in a country that faces reduced risks against its own interests , it can suffer attacks against foreign interests in that country . 
[PER Felix  ] also added that , because of [LOC Brazil  ] , s vast territory and porous borders , it can be difficult to monitor the movement or activities of terrorists within [MISC Brazilian  ] territory. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Lorenz  ] disagreed with [PER Felix  ] , s characterization of the level of risk [LOC Brazil  ] faces . 
He noted that the [ORG DPF  ] has followed terrorism since 1995 , a year after the [ORG AMIA  ] bombing . 
In that time , [ORG DPF  ] has seen several phases in the evolution of the terrorist threat in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
First , [ORG DPF  ] began with the notion that terrorists could be transiting or hiding in [LOC Brazil  ] , but that there was no threat of attacks in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Lorenz  ] used KSM , s travel through [MISC Foz  ] de Iguacu in December of 1995 to illustrate this phase . 
Then the [ORG DPF  ] started noticing that some of those who were transiting or hiding were beginning to establish residency in [LOC Brazil  ] by marrying [MISC Brazilian  ] women and adopting [MISC Brazilian  ] children . 
In a third stage , [ORG DPF  ] began seeing that some [MISC Brazilians  ] began to be captivated by extremist ideology and the idea of martyrdom . 
Some [MISC Brazilians  ] have left [LOC Brazil  ] for what the [ORG DPF  ] believes is extremist religious instruction in [LOC Iran  ] and other places in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Finally , the [ORG DPF  ] has begun to see some of those foreigners that achieved permanent residency start preparations for acts outside the country and helping terrorist groups with recruitment , training , logistics support , and reconnaissance for terrorist actions not in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
This last stage , added [PER Lorenz  ] , was what the [ORG DPF  ] saw in [PER Ali  ] , s case . 
He added that the [ORG DPF  ] , s perception is that things are evolving and that in this continuing evolution of activity , which still remains outwardly focused , could perhaps evolve in a different direction eventually. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Consensus on one thing: [ORG TBA  ] not a problem - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001206 003 OF 005 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) While offering differing views in some areas , both [PER Lorenz  ] and [PER Felix  ] agreed that the [LOC Triborder Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) is not a problem anymore . 
According to [PER Lorenz  ] , the question of financing for groups for [MISC Islamic  ] groups out of the [ORG TBA  ] is a non-issue , adding that " we have found that Zakat is a normal thing . 
" He criticized attacks on [LOC Brazil  ] from foreign countries , including the [LOC United States  ] , that accuse [LOC Brazil  ] of ignoring this fundraising , especially after the [ORG DPF  ] has found that most of the money that goes from the [ORG TBA  ] passes through the [LOC United States  ] on its way to [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
" We have told the [MISC Americans  ] , I can guarantee that this money that goes to [LOC Lebanon  ] passes through the [LOC United States  ] , I can prove it " if you think this money is for terrorism , why won , t you stop it yourselves , " adding , we can give you the names and bank accounts. , " [PER Lorenz  ] continued , " people who know [ORG TBA  ] in the 1990s , like I did , know that it is not now what it once was . 
It is now the [MISC Chinese  ] criminal networks who are the most active there , not the [MISC Arabs  ] . 
" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Lack of Legislation a Problem - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Federal Deputy [PER Raul Jungmann  ] ( [ORG PPS  ] , Socialist [ORG People 's Party  ] , opposition ; of [LOC Pernambuco  ] ) questioned [PER Felix  ] on [LOC Brazil  ] , s failure to pass terrorism legislation . 
He told the story of talking to an advisor to Minister of Justice [PER Tarso Genro  ] who told [PER Jungmann  ] that passing anti-terrorism legislation could actually invite terrorism into [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He finally asked [PER Felix  ] if [LOC Brazil  ] could condemn terrorism in its constitution and various other laws , sign all 13 international conventions against terrorism , have anti-terrorism divisions in the [ORG DPF  ] and [ORG ABIN  ] , why couldn , t it have it legislation dealing with terrorism ? 
Without directly answering [PER Jungmann  ] , both [PER Felix  ] and [PER Lorenz  ] acknowledged that the lack of terrorism legislation is a limitation for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [ORG DPF  ] acts , noted [PER Lorenz  ] , via connected crimes . 
[PER Lorenz  ] stated that the [ORG DPF  ] looks to see if terrorists are committing crimes related to terrorism , such as preparatory acts . 
For example , he noted , a terrorist could enter the country to commit a terrorist act and the [ORG DPF  ] would look at whether he used fraudulent documents or had immigration violations ; if he were to use a car bomb , they would see if he stole a car . 
In some cases , he added , the [ORG DPF  ] has already used this approach to neutralize people with [MISC Islamic  ] extremist leanings. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) In the case of [PER Ali  ] , he used the [ORG LAN  ] house ( or cybercafe ) he ran to lead and coordinate the activities of [ORG Jihad Media Battalion  ] . 
At the beginning , noted [PER Lorenz  ] , he used it for to perform propaganda on behalf of [LOC AQ  ] , s cause . 
Later it turned ito a space for recruitment , support , training , communications , operational security , and battle orers for actions outside [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [ORG DPF  ] started te investigation after the [ORG FBI  ] passed them an [MISC IP  ] ddress used by a person in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
But , [PER Lorenz  ] dded , we arrested him not because of these activities , and not because of the battle orders to case places for actions outside [LOC Brazil  ] , but through technical surveillance to decipher and break encryption his messages , which allowed us to find instances of hate crime , such as anti-Semitism and preaching hate against West . 
[PER Ali  ] was not just engaging in hate crimes , [PER Lorenz  ] hastened to add , but that was enough to charge him for a crime , even if it was a lesser crime with low penalties. - - - - - - - - - - - - Building new structures - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Responding to [ORG Congressional  ] questions of what measures [LOC Brazil  ] has taken to prevent terrorist activities in [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Felix  ] responded that in addition to signing all 13 [ORG UN  ] and [ORG OAS  ] conventions on the topic , which require actions by GOB , [LOC Brazil  ] has cooperative relations with police and intelligence units with many countries . 
In addition , he added , [LOC Brazil  ] has been active in monitoring entry points and has progressively improved capabilities in this area . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has also focused on of military , federal police , and state police forces focused on combating terrorism . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001206 004 OF 005 according to [PER Felix  ] , has closely studied the [MISC Spanish  ] model , particularly in the area of responding to attacks . 
[PER Felix  ] noted that the [MISC Spanish  ] response to the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings was very effective , as the trains were running shortly after the attacks. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] is also , according to [PER Felix  ] , currently elaborating a bill for the " defense of sovereignty " , which will update the old national security law . 
The [ORG GSI-chaired Council on Foreign Relations  ] and [ORG National Defense  ] is working with MoJ on this proposal . 
( Note: the [ORG Council on Foreign Relations  ] and [ORG National Defense  ] , or [ORG CREDN  ] , is a [ORG National Security Council-like  ] body not to be confused with the [ORG Foreign Relations  ] and [ORG National Defense Committees  ] in [ORG Congress  ] which also use [ORG CREDN  ] for their initials . 
End Note . 
) . 
According to [PER Felix  ] , the [ORG CREDN  ] working group is going to try to come up with a list of crimes that constitute terrorism , and noted that " eventual punishments are less important ; more tricky is which crimes should be included . 
" He added that there were still some weeks to go before the working group finishes up its work , but that they would soon submit the proposal to the ministries and after that to the President for approval before being introduced before [ORG Congress.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [PER Felix  ] also discussed the newly created Nucleus of the Center for the [ORG Coordination of Activities  ] for the [ORG Prevention and Combat of Terrorism  ] , to be housed within [ORG GSI  ] . 
According to [PER Felix  ] , this nucleus emerged from discussions the GOB had in 2004-05 as part of a project to create a national counterterrorism authority , which would have created a national agency to prevent and combat terrorism . 
In the end , noted [PER Felix  ] , they concluded that the attributes of an anti-terrorism " agency " would render it unworkable within the [MISC Brazilian  ] system , so [ORG GSI  ] decided on creating a " center . 
" However , because of bureaucratic difficulties in creating such a center , [ORG GSI  ] went ahead and proposed the creation of this nucleus. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) The problem for [ORG GSI  ] in creating a " center " is that it does not have its own personnel . 
[ORG GSI  ] officials are all seconded from other agencies . 
According to [PER Felix  ] , [ORG GSI  ] will be sending proposal to [ORG Congress  ] to allow [ORG GSI  ] to have its own personnel . 
It will be staffed on a part-time basis by the officers that are detailed to [ORG GSI  ] . 
The nucleus will follow actions related to terrorism ; promote threat assessment studies ; and provide coordination among the various ministries . 
( Comment: The " center " [PER Felix  ] referred to does not exist . 
[ORG GSI  ] needs statutory authority to be able to create a center that will have its own staff . 
The newly created " nucleus " is in essence a proto-center , similar to the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Terrorist Threat Integration Center  ] , that could , after gaining statutory authority , eventually morph into a " center " , or something somewhat equivalent to the [LOC U.S.  ] , s [ORG National Counterterrorism Center  ] . 
End comment . 
) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Comment: Long-Term Engagement Needed - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Lorenz  ] , s admission represented a rare instance in which a [MISC Brazilian  ] public official admits that AQ-linked individuals are either in , or have transited through , [LOC Brazil  ] . 
That it was admitted publicly by one of [LOC Brazil  ] , s top authorities on the subject of terrorism should give the [LOC United States  ] some cover when engaging in counterterrorism-related dialogues with [LOC Brazil  ] , including at the 3 Plus 1 . 
It will also be helpful as we engage [MISC Brazilian  ] audiences on the issue of passing [LOC CT  ] legislation . 
In a surprising public admission , [PER Felix  ] , [PER Lorenz  ] , and members of [ORG Congress  ] present at the hearing all agreed on the need to pass anti-terrorism legislation , with [PER Lorenz  ] stating point blank that the reason the [ORG Jihad Media Battalion  ] , s [PER Ali  ] could not be charged with a more serious crime was inadequacy of current laws. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Unfortunately , the admission appears unlikely to change [LOC Brazil  ] , s public posture . 
While there appears to be an agreement in the GOB on the need to pass [LOC CT  ] legislation , there is a lack of will to expend the political capital to do so . 
General [PER Felix  ] stuck to the script even as he was being [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001206 005 OF 005 contradicted , a script we have also heard from interlocutors at [LOC Brazil  ] , s foreign ministry . 
Revealingly , [PER Felix  ] admitted that no matter what evidence is presented [LOC Brazil  ] , s posture is deliberate and will not change . 
The argument boils down to this: [LOC Brazil  ] is a racially , ethnically , and religiously harmonious society that engages in a correct and un-provocative foreign policy . 
As a result , [LOC Brazil  ] is not a target of terrorists . 
In order to maintain this position , [LOC Brazil  ] must do nothing that will make it a target , such as taking a higher-profile or more confrontational approach to counterterrorism efforts or actively looking to pass anti-terrorism legislation. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) To further complicate matters , many senior officials in both the government and the opposition were labeled terrorists and suffered exile , prison , or in some cases torture , under the military regime that ended in 1985 . 
This is the case , for example , of the two most prominent presidential candidates to replace [PER Lula  ] in 2011 , [PER Lula  ] , s minister of the [MISC Civil Household  ] [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , s opposition governor [PER Jose Serra  ] . 
In addition , many in the current government fear that members of what they consider to be legitimate social movements fighting for a more just society might be branded terrorists . 
Finally , [MISC Brazilians  ] express concern that anti-terrorism legislation would be viewed as directed at [MISC Arab-Brazilians  ] or Foz do [MISC Iguacu  ] , and thus would become a divisive issues . 
As a result , many [MISC Brazilian  ] officials are uncomfortable with giving the state greater authority to fight terrorism. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) This mindset presents serious challenges to our efforts to enhance counterterrorism cooperation or promote passage of anti-terrorism legislation . 
At the same time , with good operational cooperation on the issue between our law enforcement agencies , [LOC Brazil  ] , s stated commitment to international anti-terrorism regimes , and work underway to draft a new national security law , there is every reason to enhance our engagement with the [MISC Brazilian  ] government on this issue . 
Although there is little chance of an immediate change in posture or that a new national security law will be seriously considered in [ORG Congress  ] before the 2010 presidential elections , we should begin engaging the GOB now on this issue . 
Securing passage of anti-terrorism legislation , changing the mindset of senior officials with regard to the threat that terrorism poses , and finding acceptable ways to cooperate on terrorism will be a long-term effort requiring commitment and creativity on our part . 
In light of [LOC Brazil  ] , s role as a regional leader and its growing role as a global power , the investment will likely pay dividends well beyond [LOC Brazil  ] .
