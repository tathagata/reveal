DURING A NOVEMBER 30-DECEMBER FCS-ORGANIZED GOLD KEY MISSION , BOEING VICE PRESIDENT [PER THOMAS PICKERING  ] , ACCOMPANIED BY [PER ALEXANDER WATSON  ] ( A CONSULTANT FOR [ORG THE FIRM  ] ) , [PER JOHN WOJICK  ] ( LATAM VP FOR SALES ) , AND [PER JEFF JOHNSON  ] ( VP FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OF INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS ) , MET WITH A SERIES OF [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR OFFICIALS IN VARIOUS MEETINGS IN SAO PAULO , SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS AND [LOC BRASILIA  ] . 
TOPICS DISCUSSED DURING [ORG THE VISIT  ] INCLUDED [ORG THE UPCOMING  ] SHAKEOUT IN BRAZIL'S CIVAIR SECTOR , DEBT OWED TO BOEING BY VARIG , POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL FIRMS , AND POTENTIAL AIRCRAFT SALES . 
IN ADDITION , IN THEIR TALKS WITH MFA INTERLOCUTORS , PICKERING AND [PER WATSON  ] OFFERED THEIR VIEWS ON ONGOING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN [ORG THE U.S  ] , AND [ORG THE EU  ] ON AIRCRAFT SUBSIDIES AS WELL AS [ORG THE STATE  ] OF U.S.-BRAZIL BILATERAL RELATIONS . 
END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION . 
CIVAIR RESTRUCTURING <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) IN THEIR DECEMBER 2 MEETINGS WITH MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT , INDUSTRY , AND COMMERCE FURLAN AND OTHER GOB OFFICIALS , [PER PICKERING  ] , [PER WATSON  ] , AND [PER WOJICK  ] OUTLINED THEIR THINKING ABOUT [ORG THE LIKELY  ] FACTORS [ORG THE GOB  ] WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO BAIL OUT [ORG THE AILING BRAZILIAN CARRIER  ] VARIG . 
VARIG'S TREMENDOUS DEBT BURDEN , THEY MADE CLEAR , WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SAVE [ORG THE AIRLINE  ] . 
( [ORG THE BOEING  ] TEAM'S OVERALL ANALYSIS ALONG [ORG THE LINES  ] OF THAT CONTAINED IN REFTEL ) OVERALL , BOEING'S GOB INTERLOCUTORS WERE RELUCTANT TO COMMENT ON WHAT THEIR GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKELY DO , THOUGH THEIR BODY LANGUAGE INDICATED THAT VARIG WAS YET ANOTHER HEADACHE WHICH SOONER OR LATER THEY WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) GOB VICE-PRESIDENT ( AND ALSO DEFMIN ) ALENCAR HAD MORE TO SAY ABOUT [ORG THE VARIG  ] PROBLEM . 
IN HIS DECEMBER 2 MEETING WITH PICKERING , [PER WATSON  ] ET . 
[LOC AL.  ] , ALENCAR MADE [ORG THE FOLLOWING  ] KEY POINTS: -- [ORG THE GOB WANTS  ] VARIG TO SUCCEED , BUT [ORG THE SITUATION  ] IS " VERY DIFFICULT . 
" ALENCAR SAID THAT HE HAD EXAMINED [ORG THE COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE  ] , AND IT WAS " A HORROR . 
" UNFORTUNATELY , [ORG THE COMPANY  ] PRESIDENT AND [ORG THE FOUNDATION  ] THAT GOVERNED VARIG WERE IN DENIAL , INSISTING THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND REFUSING TO ENGAGE SUBSTANTIVELY ON POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS WITH GOB , CREDITORS , EMPLOYEE UNION AND GOL/TAM REPS . 
IN A RECENT MEETING HOSTED BY [ORG THE GOB  ] , VARIG MANAGEMENT REPS DID NOT SHOW UP . 
-- [ORG THE GOB  ] CONTINUED TO BELIEVE THAT [ORG THE WAY  ] OUT COULD WELL INVOLVE TEAMING VARIG UP WITH LOCAL CARRIERS GOL AND/OR TAM , WITH A PRACTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ROUTES AND OTHER RIGHT-SIZING MEASURES . 
ALENCAR SAID [ORG THE SITUATION  ] HAD REACHED A LEVEL OF GRAVITY WHERE IT MIGHT WELL BE NECESSARY TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW SUCCESSOR COMPANY TO VARIG . 
[ORG THE  ] " OLD VARIG " WOULD REMAIN AS [ORG THE VEHICLE  ] FOR JUDICIAL SETTLEMENTS AND LIQUIDATIONS , WHILE [ORG THE NEW  ] COMPANY WOULD BECOME OPERATIONAL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ONE/BOTH OF [ORG THE OTHER AIRLINES  ] , THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE TO CARRY ON WITH SOME OF [ORG THE OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS  ] . 
-- [ORG THE EMPLOYEE UNIONS AND MANAGEMENT MUST  ] BECOME ENGAGED WITH EACH OTHER REALISTICALLY ON SUCH ISSUES AS TRANSFER OF POSITIONS FROM OLD COMPANY TO NEW , DOWNSIZING/BUY-OUT PROGRAMS , EMPLOYEE RIGHTS , ETC. , AND ALENCAR THOUGHT THAT WAS NOT HAPPENING . 
-- ALENCAR WAS SURPRISED BY [ORG THE SIZE  ] OF VARIG'S DEBT TO BOEING , AND STRONGLY URGED BOEING TO USE ITS LEVERAGE WITH VARIG MANAGEMENT TO URGE THEM TO BECOME SERIOUSLY ENGAGED IN A NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH GOB , UNIONS , TAM/GOL WITH A VIEW TO FINDING A SOLUTION . 
PICKERING AND [PER WATSON  ] UNDERTOOK TO DO SO . 
-- [ORG THE GOB  ] , TOGETHER WITH ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK ( [ORG BNDES  ] ) , WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP BROKER A DEAL AND THEN PROVIDE FINANCING IF [ORG THE PROJECT LOOKED VIABLE  ] . 
[ORG THE GOB  ] COULD MOVE WITH ALACRITY IF VARIG MANAGEMENT WOULD ONLY GET ENGAGED , ALENCAR SAID . 
BUT [ORG THE GOB  ] DID NOT/NOT INTEND AN OUTRIGHT BAIL-OUT OF VARIG JUST TO SAVE A GLORIOUS AVIATION NAME AND SYMBOL OF [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] PRIDE , HE ADDED. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) NOTE: BASED UPON RECENT PRESS REPORTING AND POST'S SUBSEQUENT CONTACTS WITH LULA'S CASA CIVIL , IT NOW APPEARS THAT [ORG THE GOB  ] WILL MOVE WITH RESPECT TO VARIG SOON AFTER [ORG THE BEGINNING  ] OF [ORG THE YEAR  ] . 
OUR CONTACTS WITHIN [ORG THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  ] TELL US THAT [ORG THE GOB  ] IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES . 
[ORG THE FIRST  ] WOULD BE ISSUANCE OF A PRESIDENTIAL DECREE ALLOWING [ORG THE GOB  ] TO INTERVENE IN VARIG , BREAKING UP [ORG THE COMPANY  ] AND DISPOSING OF ITS ASSETS . 
ANOTHER OPTION UNDER CONSIDERATION , WE WERE TOLD , WAS A PRIVATE TAKEOVER , WITH TAM AND GOL DIVIDING UP AS MUCH OF [ORG THE COMPANY  ] AS POSSIBLE . 
STILL UNCLEAR IS WHETHER TAM/GOL WOULD INHERIT [ORG THE VARIG PENSION FUND  ] ( WHICH ITSELF IS IN DEFICIT ) AND WHO WOULD PAY VARIG'S OUTSTANDING DEBT . 
YET A THIRD VARIANT WOULD BE [ORG THE INVOLVEMENT  ] OF A FOREIGN INVESTOR . 
OUR SOURCE TOLD US THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING WITH AN UNNAMED MAJOR EUROPEAN CORPORATION WHICH IS INTERESTED IN PURCHASING AN INTEREST IN [ORG THE CARRIER  ] . 
PRESUMABLY THIS WOULD BE A MINORITY STAKE AS 20 PERCENT IS [ORG THE MAXIMUM  ] FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF AN AIRLINE ALLOWABLE UNDER [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] LAW . 
WHILE ONE RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ASSERTED THAT PORTUGUESE CHARTER AIRLINE EURO ATLANTIC WAS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH [ORG BNDES  ] FOR [ORG THE PURCHASE  ] OF 20 PERCENT OF VARIG , GOB SPOKESMEN TELL US THAT EURO ATLANTIC IS NOW OUT OF [ORG THE PICTURE  ] . 
MEANWHILE , A LOCAL COURT HAS JUST RULED IN FAVOR OF VARIG IN [ORG THE LATTER'S  ] 2.5 BILLION REAIS LAWSUIT AGAINST [ORG THE FEDERAL  ] GOVERNMENT , ALTHOUGH [ORG THE GOB  ] IS APPEALING THIS DECISION . 
( VARIG'S TOTAL DEBT IS NEAR 7 BILLION REAIS ) . 
AIRCRAFT SUBSIDIES <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) ON DECEMBER 2 , [ORG THE BOEING  ] DELEGATION HAD A FRIENDLY , INFORMAL BREAKFAST AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS . 
PRESENT FOR [ORG THE GOB  ] SIDE WERE AMBASSADOR RUY NOGUEIRA ( U/S FOR COOPERATION AND COMMUNITIES ABROAD ) , AMBASSADOR [PER ANTONIO  ] DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA ( [ORG THE FOREIGN  ] MINISTER'S CHIEF OF STAFF ) , AMBASSADOR [PER MARIO VILALVA  ] ( HEAD OF [ORG THE BUSINESS PROMOTION OFFICE  ] ) , MINISTER PAULO CESAR DE MEIRA DE VASCONCELLOS ( U/S NOGUEIRA'S DEPUTY ) , COUNSELOR RALPH PETER HENDERSON ( CHIEF OF [ORG THE IMMIGRATION DIVISION  ] ) , AND FABIO MENDES MARZANO ( ADVISOR TO U/S NOGUEIRA ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) PICKERING MADE [ORG THE CASE  ] FOR ELIMINATION OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS ( I.E. , [ORG AIRBUS  ] ) AND URGED [ORG THE GOB  ] TO JOIN TALKS ON A MULTILATERAL OECD ACCORD ON AIRCRAFT SUBSIDIES . 
SUCH AN ACCORD , PICKERING STATED , WOULD HELP FILL [ORG THE VOID  ] LEFT AFTER [ORG THE USG'S  ] RECENT ABROGATION OF A 1992 BILATERAL 1992 U.S.-EU UNDERSTANDING ON THIS ISSUE . 
( ABROGATION OF THE 1992 ACCORD COMES IN [ORG THE WAKE  ] OF A 1994 WTO DECISION BANNING AIRCRAFT SUBSIDIES AND A WTO CASED FILED BY [ORG THE USG  ] THIS YEAR AGAINST EU SUBSIDIES IN VIOLATION OF THAT DECISION . 
) PICKERING MADE CLEAR THAT BOEING HAD HAD EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS WITH USTR ZOELLICK ON THIS ISSUE AND THAT [ORG THE USG  ] HAD BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF BOEING'S CONCERNS . 
NOGUEIRA STATED THAT [ORG THE GOB  ] WANTED TO BE AT [ORG THE TABLE  ] IF ANY MULTILATERAL ACCORD IS TO BE NEGOTIATED , ADDING THAT [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] OFFICIALS WERE PRESENT AT RECENT MULTILATERAL/BILATERAL TALKS IN PARIS ON THIS ISSUE . 
U.S.-BRAZIL TRADE RELATIONS AND UNSC SEAT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) SPEAKING PERSONALLY , PICKERING EXPRESSED GENERAL SUPPORT FOR [ORG THE GOB'S  ] CAMPAIGN TO GET A PERMANENT UNSC SEAT AND NOTED THAT , BASED UPON HIS EXPERIENCE AS USUN PERM REP , HE THOUGHT THAT UNSC EXPANSION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN AGREEMENT ( [ORG FORMAL OR INFORMAL  ] ) THAT NO UNSC MEMBER WOULD VETO A RESOLUTION NOT INVOLVING ITS OWN COUNTRY UNLESS AT LEAST THREE UNSC MEMBERS WERE PREPARED TO ALSO VOTE NO. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) WITH RESPECT TO TRADE , PATRIOTA MADE CLEAR THAT [ORG THE GOB'S  ] CURRENT PRIORITY WAS SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDING [ORG THE DOHA ROUND  ] . 
HE SAID THAT PRIOR TO [ORG THE GENEVA  ] MEETING EARLIER THIS YEAR , MANY WERE LOOKING AT [MISC THE G-20  ] AS AN OBSTRUCTIONIST ELEMENT -- BUT THAT VIEWS HAD CHANGED IN [ORG THE WAKE  ] OF [ORG THE KEY  ] ROLE THAT BRAZIL PLAYED IN ACHIEVING CONSENSUS ON [ORG THE GENEVA  ] FRAMEWORK . 
TURNING TO [ORG THE FTAA  ] , PATRIOTA NOTED THAT TALKS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT UP TO THIS POINT . 
HE OPINED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL VIEWS WITHIN [ORG THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AS  ] TO NEXT STEPS , BUT ADDED THAT [ORG THE PRESIDENT'S  ] VIEW ( AND [ORG THE VIEW  ] THAT WOULD PRESUMABLY PREVAIL ) WAS THAT [ORG THE FTAA  ] AS IT CURRENTLY WAS SHAPING UP SIMPLY DID NOT OFFER BRAZIL ENOUGH . 
IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM PICKERING ABOUT THE STATUS OF [ORG THE MERCOSUR-EU TALKS  ] , PATRIOTA SAID THAT THE SAME WAS TRUE WITH RESPECT TO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS . 
PATRIOTA CLOSED BY NOTING THAT REPORTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN [ORG THE VARIOUS GOB  ] MINISTRIES ON TRADE POLICY ( I.E. , [ORG THE MINISTRIES  ] OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT/COMMERCE VS . 
[ORG THE MFA  ] ) WERE A BIT OVERBLOWN . 
TO [ORG THE EXTENT  ] THAT DIFFERENT AGENCIES HAD DIFFERENT POSITIONS , HE SAID , THIS SIMPLY MIRRORED [ORG THE SITUATION  ] IN [ORG THE U.S.  ] DANILOVICH</pre></code>
