( C ) Summary . 
On 12/21 , [PER Poloff  ] met with [PER Rafael Rubio  ] , head of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NGO  ] " [LOC Cuba  ] en [LOC Transicion  ] " ( [LOC Cuba  ] in Transition ) , a human rights organization dedicated to raising public awareness in [LOC Spain  ] about human rights abuses in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Rubio  ] , who generally works with the [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) but has also sought to expand his links to the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , said that his organization is pressing the [ORG GOS  ] to take concrete measures in support of [MISC Cuban  ] civil society , " since the only concrete measure they 've taken so far is to exclude dissidents from national day events . 
" [PER Rubio  ] said that , despite public claims of a victory for [MISC Spanish  ] policy in [LOC Brussels  ] , the [ORG GOS  ] has opened the door for [ORG NGOs  ] such as his to lobby for higher-profile [ORG EU  ] support for the [MISC Cuban  ] opposition . 
He has made little headway with [ORG Socialist Party  ] leaders , some of whom cling to a romantic vision of the [MISC Cuban  ] revolution , and is now focused on influencing the [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Rubio  ] said he is perplexed by the [LOC UK  ] 's support for easing [ORG EU  ] measures against [LOC Cuba  ] and asked about the importance of [LOC Cuba  ] in [LOC GOS-USG  ] relations . 
[PER Poloff  ] responded that [LOC Cuba  ] is an important issue at the highest levels of the [ORG USG  ] and that [LOC Spain  ] 's change in tack towards the [ORG GOS  ] over the last year had not helped bilateral ties . 
[PER Rubio  ] 's organization is small , but working with allied [ORG NGOs  ] , it may manage to rein in Socialist desires to further ease [MISC Spanish  ] and [ORG EU  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] . 
End Summary. //PREACHING TO THE UN-CONVERTED// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Cuba  ] in Transition is a small , but well-connected [ORG NGO  ] ( www.cubaentransicion.com ) that is unusual in that it has no [MISC Cuban  ] exiles in its membership . 
It receives a small [MISC USAID  ] grant through the [ORG Washington-based Center  ] for a Free [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Rubio  ] said he has attempted to work through the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) before approaching the government . 
His objective is to sensitize [ORG PSOE  ] to the massive scale of [LOC Cuba  ] 's repression in an effort to eliminate a lingering sense of political affinity for [ORG Castro  ] among some elements of the [ORG Socialist Party  ] . 
He has made little headway , primarily because the [ORG PSOE  ] remains wary of publicly criticizing the [ORG Castro  ] regime and because the Socialists have determined that so-called " moderate " dissidents [PER Gutierrez Menoyo  ] and [PER Manuel XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] are the only dissidents worth listening to . 
[PER Rubio  ] said the " moderates' " message of working with the [ORG Castro  ] regime to encourage gradual change was seductive to [ORG EU  ] left wing parties such as the [ORG PSOE  ] ( NOTE: [ORG PSOE  ] has brushed aside dissident suspicions that xxxxxxxxxxxx is in fact a [MISC Cuban  ] Government agent . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Rubio  ] said he was taken aback to hear [ORG PSOE  ] members criticize Project Varela leader [PER Oswaldo Paya  ] as " too conservative " and as " a tool of the [LOC Miami  ] exile community , " especially given [PER Paya  ] 's well-known differences with [LOC Miami  ] groups . 
This echoes [ORG PSOE  ] comments to a visiting [ORG National Democratic Institute  ] representative that [PER Paya  ] 's anti-abortion stance and good relations with former President [PER Aznar  ] had alienated the [LOC PSOE.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Rubio  ] said he had inundated [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador to [LOC Cuba  ] [PER Carlos Saldivar  ] with information regarding [ORG GOC  ] abuses for many months . 
He believed he had managed to at least get [PER Saldivar  ] , a former [ORG Spanish Communist Party  ] member , to question his preconceptions about [ORG Castro  ] . 
However , [PER Rubio  ] said [PER Saldivar  ] " remains a [MISC Marxist  ] in his basic world view " and may be fundamentally incapable of conducting an objective evaluation of conditions in [LOC Cuba.  ] //MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Having determined that the [ORG PSOE  ] is not likely to veer from its cautious stance towards aiding the opposition , [PER Rubio  ] has gone directly to the Socialist Government . 
He recently approached the [ORG MFA  ] to encourage them to take specific steps to comply with [LOC Spain  ] 's claim that it intends to ramp up contact with the dissidents to offset their dis-invitation from [ORG EU  ] national day events . 
Specifically , [PER Rubio  ] is urging the [ORG GOS  ] to: - Raise the public profile of the regular [MISC EU-Cuban  ] opposition exchanges the [ORG GOS  ] has pledged to activate in [LOC Havana.  ] - Create public space in the [MISC Spanish  ] Embassy in [LOC Havana  ] for civil society , similar to the [ORG USINT Havana  ] media center. - Distribute books and information materials to [MISC Cuban  ] citizens , including both political and non-political literature. - Create an official [MISC Spanish  ] " human rights officer " position in [LOC Havana  ] to act as a [ORG POC  ] for democracy activists and for human rights [ORG NGOs  ] overseas. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Rubio  ] said he had told [ORG MFA  ] DG for [MISC Latin America  ] [PER Javier Sandomingo  ] that the opposition could not accept having its relations with the [ORG EU  ] downgraded , since this implied that [LOC Europe  ] did not consider the activists to be legitimate political actors . 
[PER Rubio  ] asked [PER Sandomingo  ] to support a human rights conference he is trying to organize in [LOC Madrid  ] two days prior to the January 31 review/approval by [ORG EU  ] foreign ministers of the [ORG COLAT  ] experts recommendation to modify the [ORG EU  ] restrictive measures . 
The goal of the conference would be to provide concrete recommendations to the [ORG EU  ] on how to structure assistance to [MISC Cuban  ] civil society , based on the [ORG EU  ] 's experience supporting democracy activists in other countries. //INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Rubio  ] expressed his consternation that the [LOC UK  ] had " turned its back " on [LOC Cuba  ] 's human rights activists , saying it was inconceivable to him that a country with the [LOC UK  ] 's tradition of support for human rights would have agreed to weaken [ORG EU  ] measures against the [ORG GOC  ] given the lack of progress in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
With respect to the [LOC U.S.  ] , he asked whether the [LOC Cuba  ] issue was a genuinely important issue in bilateral relations with [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER Poloff  ] replied that [LOC Cuba  ] was a very important matter to the [ORG USG  ] and that we were very skeptical regarding [LOC Spain  ] 's current approach . 
While we have good working relations with the [ORG GOS  ] on many issues , [LOC Cuba  ] developments were not helping the bilateral relationship. //COMMENT// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Rubio  ] 's close association with the opposition PP complicates his efforts to influence the ruling Socialists . 
He is aware of this and focuses on basic human rights issues in order to avoid becoming ensnarled in the politics surrounding [MISC Spanish  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] in Transition is a small organization with limited objectives , but its members are genuinely committed to the issues and are capable of keeping [LOC Cuba  ] human rights in the public eye . 
The best we may be able to hope for over the near term is that activists such as [PER Rubio  ] will manage to keep alive the domestic debate over [LOC Cuba  ] policy , preventing the [ORG GOS  ] from going too far in easing pressure on [ORG Castro  ] .
