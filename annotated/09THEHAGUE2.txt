( C/NF ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] government agrees that doing business with [LOC Iran  ] poses risks for [MISC Dutch  ] companies , and it will continue to discourage new investments there . 
[ORG Shell  ] has again pushed back its investment decision on the [ORG Persian LNG  ] project , this time until late 2010 . 
However , [ORG Shell  ] 's go-slow approach in [LOC Iran  ] belies seething frustration at the perceived ineffectiveness of sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
The company sees [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear activities continuing while [MISC Chinese  ] and other firms seal long-term energy deals in [LOC Iran  ] at the expense of [MISC Western  ] energy security interests . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ------- GONL WARNING [MISC DUTCH  ] FIRMS ON RISKY BUSINESS WITH [LOC IRAN  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) EconOffs delivered ref A points during a December 8 meeting with [PER Simon Smits  ] , Director of [ORG Economic Cooperation  ] at the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
( Note: In summer 2008 , [PER Smits  ] , a career diplomat , completed a two-year secondment at [ORG Shell  ] where he focused on government relations in the company 's hot zones . 
The secondment was part of an ongoing program in which a [MISC Dutch  ] diplomat works at [ORG Shell  ] 's headquarters in The [LOC Hague  ] and a [LOC UK  ] diplomat works at [ORG Shell  ] 's [LOC London  ] offices . 
End note . 
) [PER Smits  ] reiterated what he had told us before: although [ORG Shell  ] maintains a footprint in [LOC Iran  ] , the company cares immensely about its reputation and has therefore backed off its [MISC Iranian  ] ventures . 
He added that [ORG Shell  ] would never want to jeopardize its huge investments in the [LOC U.S.  ] by violating the [LOC Iran  ] Sanctions Act , which factors into all its decisions on [LOC Iran  ] . 
As for [ORG Philips  ] , [PER Smits  ] was not as familiar with its business interests in [LOC Iran  ] but he would be surprised if they were active there . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] government repeats over and over to [MISC Dutch  ] companies that they must stick to the international regime on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Smits  ] assured us that in light of our demarche and national measures efforts , the [MISC Dutch  ] government would continue to exert pressure on the private sector to abstain from clinching new deals with [LOC Iran  ] . 
EconOffs also shared ref A points with [ORG Philips  ] and with trade and export control officials at the [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] ; reporting on [MISC Philips'  ] reaction will follow septel. ------------------------------ [ORG SHELL OFFERS DETAILED RESPONSE  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) EconfOff met December 15 with [PER John Crocker  ] ( protect ) , [ORG Shell  ] 's [ORG Head of International Government Relations  ] , and his colleague [PER Roelof van Ees  ] to discuss ref A points . 
[PER Crocker  ] , who briefs the Department regularly , stressed [ORG Shell  ] 's commitment to its international obligations and its opposition to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear activities . 
He also described [ORG Shell  ] 's frustration with the current approach to [LOC Iran  ] sanctions , which it sees as both ineffective in stopping [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions and detrimental to [MISC Western  ] energy interests. --------------------------------------------- ------- SHELL: WITHDRAWAL FROM [LOC IRAN  ] WILL REDUCE TOTAL OUTPUT --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) From [ORG Shell  ] 's perspective , shutting down completely international oil companies' ( IOCs ) engagement with [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector is counterproductive . 
[PER Crocker  ] attributed this to the [MISC Iranian  ] regime 's absolute focus on the short-term , they pay attention to consequences that will hit tomorrow at the latest . 
Drawing on [ORG Shell  ] 's experience , he described [PER Qthe  ] latest . 
Drawing on [ORG Shell  ] 's experience , he described opposing methods to develop [LOC Iran  ] 's gas fields . 
For IOCs , developing a new field today would require a $10-25 billion investment using advanced technology . 
This would maximize the field 's long-term recovery rate and profitability , but output would be lower in the first decade as a result and the field might not generate positive cash flows until 2025 . 
On the other hand , if the [MISC Iranians  ] develop a new field on their own or with a [MISC Chinese  ] partner , they will use poorer technology . 
This would accelerate near-term recovery -- the overriding concern of [LOC Iran  ] 's leadership -- but limit the field 's total output to only 20 percent of recoverable gas reserves. -------------------------------------- STATUS OF SHELL'S LNG INTEREST IN [LOC IRAN  ] -------------------------------------- THE HAGUE 00000002 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Crocker  ] provided an update on the [ORG Persian LNG  ] ( [ORG PLNG  ] ) project in [LOC Iran  ] . 
( Note: [ORG Shell  ] has a 25 percent stake in the project , [ORG Repsol  ] 25 percent , and [ORG National Iranian Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NIOC  ] ) owns 50 percent . 
End note . 
) [ORG Shell  ] and the other parties signed an initial agreement in 2004 . 
A final investment decision ( [ORG FID  ] ) had been expected at the end of 2006 , which then slipped to mid-2008 . 
According to [PER Crocker  ] , [ORG Shell  ] 's [ORG FID  ] is now delayed until late 2010 . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] blames the delay on [ORG Shell  ] 's backtracking for political reasons . 
[PER Crocker  ] agreed [ORG Shell  ] had dragged its feet on purpose but added that [LOC Iran  ] bore responsibility for its operational incompetence and its attempts to change the agreement 's terms . 
He said the additional two-year delay from 2008 to 2010 stems largely from changes in how the project 's construction will be contracted -- instead of having one large subcontractor build the multi-train terminal , the contract will be split up into several components . 
[PER Crocker  ] said [ORG Shell  ] , [ORG Repsol  ] , and [ORG NIOC  ] continue to work on the design and evaluation phases of their respective parts of the [ORG PLNG  ] project . 
He said [ORG Shell  ] would make its [ORG FID  ] in late 2010 taking all factors , including political ones , into account . 
If the project moves ahead after that point , [PER Crocker  ] said [ORG LNG  ] deliveries would commence by 2015-16 at the earliest. --------------------------------------------- - [ORG SHELL  ] DISMISSIVE OF CATALYTIC CONVERTER THREAT --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Crocker  ] was skeptical that the supply of catalytic converters to [LOC Iran  ] 's refineries was a significant issue . 
He was unaware of [ORG Shell  ] 's sales of catalytic converters in [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] should know that it is not in the regime 's interest to upgrade its refineries , as well-placed individuals profit handsomely from the export of [MISC Iranian  ] crude oil at market prices and re-import of refined products at heavily subsidized rates . 
[PER Crocker  ] suggested that because of this lucrative arbitrage scheme , it was in the interest of [LOC Iran  ] 's rulers for the refining sector to remain incompetently managed. ---------------------------- SHELL'S FRUSTRATIONS IN [LOC IRAN  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Crocker  ] vented several frustrations [ORG Shell  ] has concerning [LOC Iran  ] 's behavior and the international sanctions against it: -- [MISC Iranian  ] Indecision: [PER Crocker  ] said the [MISC Iranians  ] are not clear on what they want for their natural gas ; their strategy depends on whom one speaks with in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
Some key officials want to export [ORG LNG  ] , others want to export gas via pipeline , and others still want to keep all the gas for future domestic use . 
He said this internal confusion created an uncertain environment for IOCs . 
-- [ORG Double Standard for China: Crocker  ] said [ORG Shell  ] was dismayed by the lack of [LOC U.S.  ] government criticism of [LOC China  ] after [ORG Sinopec  ] signed its 2007 deal with [LOC Iran  ] to develop the [MISC Yadavaran  ] field . 
According to [PER Crocker  ] , this underscored [ORG Shell  ] executives' fear that western IOCs will get shut out of [LOC Iran  ] long-term to the benefit of [MISC Chinese  ] , [MISC Russian  ] , and even [MISC Indian  ] firms who disregard [MISC American  ] and [MISC European  ] pressure and make lucrative investments in [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector with impunity . 
He claimed that [LOC Tehran  ] was crawling with [MISC Chinese  ] eager to do business with [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- Level Playing [PER Field: Crocker  ] said [ORG Shell  ] would welcome another [ORG UNSC Resolution  ] on [LOC Iran  ] that levels the playing field by imposing broader trade sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] and forcing [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russian  ] firms to comply . 
In [PER Crocker  ] 's Qforcing [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC Russian  ] firms to comply . 
In [PER Crocker  ] 's view , this would be more effective than just targeting the finance and energy sectors in bringing pressure against the [MISC Iranian  ] regime and it would also reduce the [MISC IOCs'  ] competitive disadvantage . 
-- [LOC U.S.  ] Holds the Key: [PER Crocker  ] lamented that P5-plus-1 overtures would not be attractive to [LOC Iran  ] unless they included the carrot of a clear timetable for better relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] He said the [MISC Iranians  ] don't want better relations with [LOC Europe  ] , nor do they want ten years of talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Despite [ORG Shell  ] 's fraught experience in [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Crocker  ] concluded this has not deterred the company from a long-term presence there . 
He compared [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , and [LOC Iraq  ] -- other potentially unstable and dangerous places where [ORG Shell  ] and other IOCs do business . 
THE HAGUE 00000002 003 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) Biographical Note: [PER Crocker  ] worked with the [ORG UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] for several years , mainly in the [LOC Middle East  ] , before moving to [ORG Shell  ] ten years ago . 
He gained operational experience managing [ORG Shell  ] 's business in [LOC Oman  ] before coming to headquarters to oversee government relations. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) In our dialogue with the [MISC Dutch  ] government and private sector on finance and trade measures to combat [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear activities , they express frustration that international sanctions are only as strong as their weakest link , i.e. , [LOC Russia  ] , the [LOC Gulf  ] states , and -- especially -- [LOC China  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] think they are doing their fair share to implement sanctions effectively ( and they see far higher trade volumes with [LOC Iran  ] coming from [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and [LOC France  ] ) . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will continue to be a dependable partner on [LOC Iran  ] sanctions , but excluding them from the national measures dialogue ( as occurred in early December ) undercuts their ability to support our position on a bigger stage . 
END COMMENT .
