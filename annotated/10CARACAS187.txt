Meyer  ] , Political Counselor , DOS , POL ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Harassment of [MISC Cuban  ] Medical parolees has increased significantly since December 2009 . 
Recent media coverage has exacerbated difficulties experienced by parolees attempting to exit [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
These [MISC Cuban  ] medical professionals who staff President [PER Chavez  ] 's flagship medical service program for the poor , [PER Barrio Adentro  ] , report that they inflate their patient numbers and are required to conduct political work . 
[MISC Cubans  ] who have abandoned their [PER Barrio Adentro  ] clinics find it difficult to legalize their presence and benefit from basic services . 
Most parolees do make it out of [LOC Venezuela  ] , but some undergo a harrowing ordeal before being able to exit . 
End Summary . 
HARASSMENT OF [ORG CUBAN MEDICAL PAROLEES  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the last two months , [MISC Cubans  ] approved for humanitarian parole through the [ORG Cuban Medical Professionals Program  ] ( [ORG CMPP  ] ) at [ORG Embassy Caracas  ] have experienced increased difficulty leaving [LOC Venezuela  ] through the [LOC MaiquetC-a  ] ( [LOC Caracas  ] ) airport . 
Almost all experience some sort of harassment , ranging from passports being confiscated to physical and verbal abuse . 
Many of those who are allowed to board their flights to [LOC Miami  ] are only able to do so after paying sizeable bribes ( generally $700-$1000 ) to [MISC Venezuelan  ] immigration officials or [MISC Cuban  ] officials who are said to be working at the airport . 
From 2009-2010 , more than 20 parolees have been detained for extensive questioning , which has reportedly included verbal and physical abuse , confiscation of official and regular passports , strip search , and threats of deportation . 
Most of those [MISC Cubans  ] detained are not allowed to proceed to their flights . 
However , there have been no reports of these parolees actually being deported to [LOC Cuba  ] , and they have all been released after several hours of detention . 
In fact , most parolees eventually make it out on a subsequent attempt . 
MEDIA COVERAGE MAKES IT WORSE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The problem has been exacerbated by January 2010 news coverage of the [ORG CMPP  ] in [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Venezuelan  ] , and [MISC Colombian  ] media outlets . 
Harassment has increased significantly since the first article was published in the [ORG Miami Herald  ] on January 7 and was subsequently picked up by [MISC Globovision  ] and other media outlets in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Some CMP parolees have chosen to transfer their cases to [LOC Colombia  ] rather than take the risk of leaving via [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Others have simply traveled to [LOC Colombia  ] and departed using the travel documents issued in [LOC Caracas  ] . 
Since 2009 , 10 of those unable to fly have crossed the border to [LOC Colombia  ] and have flown to [LOC Miami  ] from [LOC BogotC  ] ! 
. 
There are no reports of harassment once parolees are in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
FAKE STATISTICS AND POLITICAL WORK <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Post collected the following anecdotal evidence recounting the difficulties applicants encounter during and after the mission . 
While in the mission , applicants live off a very a meager stipend ( 967 [PER Bolivares Fuertes  ] per month , approximately $372 USD at the official exchange rate ) and work six days a week . 
Doctors are required to see 50-70 patients daily , a number unattainable for most doctors who , in reality , average 10-20 patients . 
Almost all applicants claim they are forced to doctor their statistics to meet these requirements . 
Many applicants also describe mandatory political work , especially around elections , when applicants are instructed to read propaganda in clinics and gather potential voters . 
In addition , they are often required to staff politically charged health drives on Sundays . 
( Note: Some [MISC Venezuelans  ] have accused [PER Barrio Adentro  ] of being primarily a political program . 
See Ref A for more details . 
End Note . 
) CUBANS' PLIGHT AFTER ABANDONING THE MISSIONS [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000187 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Applicants encounter severe difficulties once they abandon the mission . 
At this point , the applicants are considered illegal immigrants and are subject to deportation . 
Most find it difficult to ever legalize their stay in [LOC Venezuela  ] or benefit from basic services . 
One applicant gave birth the day after her parole was accepted but has been unable to get a [MISC Venezuelan  ] passport for her child . 
Officials told her that they are forbidden to give passports to " deserters . 
" Other [MISC Cubans  ] have not been able to legally marry in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
While there is no confirmed deportation of a parolee , an applicant was recently sent back to [LOC Cuba  ] as a precautionary measure when his girlfriend abandoned the mission . 
[ORG CMPP  ] NUMBERS TO DATE <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) From 2006 to 2007 , 497 [MISC Cubans  ] applied for parole through the [ORG CMPP  ] at [ORG Embassy Caracas  ] . 
407 of those applicants were approved , 70 were denied , and 8 cases are still pending . 
In 2008 , there were 201 applicants , 154 approvals , 28 denials , and 8 cases are still pending . 
In 2009 , [ORG Embassy Caracas  ] received 237 applications , 161 of which were approved , 36 denied , and 40 still pending . 
There have not been any approvals or denials yet in 2010 . 
Since Post began to use YY foils instead of transportation letters in March 2009 ( due to fraud concerns ) , 277 of such foils have been issued . 
It should be noted that the vast majority of our approved [ORG CMPP  ] applicants actually do successfully leave [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Most successfully leave on their first attempt flying out of [LOC Venezuela  ] with a visa foil or travel letter . 
Those that are initially detained have apparently often been able to bribe their way out on a subsequent attempt . 
The rest , as noted above , have made the trek to [LOC Colombia  ] and been able to get on a flight to [LOC Miami.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Post generally receives [ORG CMPP  ] approvals in large batches . 
Given the parole requirements of traveling within 21 days of YY foil issuance , many parolees attempt to exit [LOC Venezuela  ] during the same time period . 
This creates a situation whereby these applicants will travel in waves . 
Post is unaware whether harassment is the result of deliberate Government of the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) guidance or based on the actions of individual immigration officers . 
Certainly , the recent publicity about [MISC Cuban  ] doctors bribing [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] officials has put an unwelcome spotlight on the program . 
Yet it does seem clear that the [ORG GBRV  ] does not yet systematically attempt to detain all parolees . 
Finally , the information provided by the applicants during the interview process appears to corroborate claims from many [MISC Venezuelans  ] that the [PER Barrio Adentro  ] program is as focused on political propaganda as it is on improving health .
