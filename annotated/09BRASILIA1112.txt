( C ) Summary . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] or [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) has no immediate response to our request in ref A to provide $10 million in direct budget support to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) . 
The relevant [ORG MRE  ] department heads were receptive to the idea of a further [MISC Brazilian  ] contribution but noted that the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] still has not approved the $10 million that [ORG Itamaraty  ] promised the [ORG PA  ] for [LOC Gaza  ] reconstruction in March . 
[ORG MRE  ] officials who have previously criticized the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] negotiations offered praise for our current strategy , especially increased discussions with [LOC Syria  ] and pressure on [LOC Israel  ] to halt construction of settlements . 
[ORG Brasilia  ] wants to raise its profile on Israel-Palestine issues generally , and intends to host separate visits from [MISC Israeli  ] President [PER Shimon Peres  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] , both in November . 
September 4 newspaper reports also suggested that a long-planned visit by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] might be scheduled for December . 
[ORG MRE  ] also asked for our help in setting up a a meeting between between Special Envoy [PER Mitchell  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's top envoy on [LOC Middle East  ] issues , Ambassador [PER Affonso Ouro Preto  ] . 
End summary . 
Enthusiastic but Non-Committal ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a September 3 meeting with poloff at [ORG Itamaraty  ] , [LOC Middle East  ] division directors [PER Claudio Nascimento  ] ( Israel-Palestine , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Syria  ] ) and [PER Roberto Abdalla  ] ( [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Gulf States  ] ) , discussed at length [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] relations and their desire for [LOC Brasil  ] to have a larger role -- but could not give an immediate answer to the question in reftel A . 
( They said that the Minister had received reftel letter in early August , but that their section had not become aware of it until recently . 
) While [PER Nascimento  ] in particular sounded enthusiastic about the concept of providing funding for the [ORG PA  ] in advance of peace negotiations , they acknowledged that an earlier $10 million promised for [LOC Gaza  ] reconstruction ( ref B ) by Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] in advance of the March 31 Arab-South [MISC American  ] summit still had not been authorized by [ORG Congress  ] . 
No one in either division knew anything about the status of the $10 million in [ORG Congress  ] . 
Later in the day , poloff called the [ORG Senate Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] and learned from staff that the legislation still has not been assigned a lead sponsor ( " relator " ) -- meaning that it would take weeks at a minimum before the funding could be approved and released . 
Supportive of [ORG New Direction  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In contrast to previous meetings with the [ORG Embassy  ] , in which [ORG Itamaraty  ] has generally criticized [LOC U.S.  ] policy in the [LOC Middle East  ] ( refs B , C ) , feedback for the overall [LOC U.S.  ] approach to [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] issues was quite positive . 
They specifically praised President [PER Obama  ] and Special Advisor [PER Mitchell  ] for taking a different and hands-on approach . 
[PER Nascimento  ] , who has emphasized in previous meetings the importance of better [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC Syria  ] as part of [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] negotiations , noted the increased level of outreach to [LOC Damascus  ] in recent months . 
[ORG MRE  ] hoped to learn more about the specifics of our policy toward [LOC Syria  ] . 
( Note: [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Arab  ] community is largely of [MISC Christian Syrian  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] origin . 
End Note . 
) [PER Nascimento  ] also cited our emphasis on asking [LOC Israel  ] to halt construction of settlements " as a really noticeable and positive change . 
" The directors also latched on to [ORG Hamas  ] chief [PER Khalad Meshal  ] 's statement last month that it could accept a [MISC Palestinian  ] state based on 1967 borders as a hopeful sign for future talks . 
Raising the [MISC Brazilian  ] Profile ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While non-committal about [ORG PA  ] funding , [PER Nascimento  ] mentioned ways in which [LOC Brazil  ] is trying to raise its profile on [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] issues . 
In addition to a projected visit by [PER Peres  ] on November 11 , [ORG MRE  ] is also in the process of organizing a visit by [PER Abbas  ] two weeks later . 
Ambassador [PER Ouro Preto  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's top envoy to the [LOC Middle East  ] , is attempting [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001112 002 OF 002 to meet with both men before the prospective visits . 
The original idea was to meet with [PER Peres  ] and [PER Abbas  ] at a planned [LOC Moscow  ] conference but , since [ORG Itamaraty  ] is not sanguine about propects for that conference happening anytime soon , [PER Ouro Preto  ] plans to visit them in their respective offices . 
There are no plans on the immediate horizon for President [PER Lula  ] to reschedule his trip to [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] , which was canceled earlier this year for security reasons. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Nascimento  ] also requested assistance in setting up a meeting between Ambassador [PER Ouro Preto  ] and Special Envoy [PER Mitchell  ] . 
He said that [PER DAS Kelly  ] 's office had reached out to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] about setting up a meeting but that no further contact has been made recently . 
Such a meeting could be held on the margins of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] in late September , he said . 
No specific subject matter for the meeting was mentioned . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The guarded enthusiasm expressed by [ORG Itamaraty  ] about the [LOC U.S.  ] role in the [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] peace process represents a welcome change of pace , but it will be difficult to convert this into immediate deliverables from the [ORG GOB  ] . 
The delay in approving the $10 million for the [ORG PA  ] promised in March does not preclude additional [ORG Itamaraty  ] commitments for additional budget assistance but the March commitment is already an extremely large contribution for [LOC Brazil  ] and any new contribution will also have to be cleared by [ORG Congress  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is determined to play a larger role , however , and additional contact with the [ORG GOB  ] on this issue would be helpful both to inform and influence what is still a relatively unrefined policy toward the region and the [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] peace process in particular .
