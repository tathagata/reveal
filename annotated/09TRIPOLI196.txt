End summary . 
[ORG SAIF  ] AL-ISLAM ANNOUNCES NEW [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS  ] ORGANIZATION 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG International  ] media reported on the margins of the recent [ORG World Economic Forum  ] in [LOC Davos  ] that [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , son of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi and Chairman of the quasi-governmental [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , had announced his intention to establish a human rights organization whose mandate would include tracking human rights abuses in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
The [ORG QDF  ] 's Executive Director , [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] , told the [LOC DCM  ] on February 22 that the new organization had been established and was " ... up and running " . 
The new entity , named the [ORG Arab Alliance for Democracy , Development and Human Rights  ] ( [ORG AADDHR  ] ) , was headquartered in [LOC Tripoli  ] and was separate from the [ORG QDF  ] . 
An initial meeting , attended by NGO representatives from more than 20 countries , was held in [LOC Tripoli  ] in mid-February . 
[ORG Saif  ] al-Islam was elected Chairman of the [ORG AADDHR  ] , an honorary position , and Dr. [PER Ali Said Ali  ] , a professor from [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Gar Younis University  ] , was appointed General Coordinator . 
[ORG Saif  ] al-Islam also recently announced that he intends to open a democracy research institute in [LOC Europe  ] ( [LOC London  ] and [LOC Vienna  ] , two cities he knows well , have been mentioned ) , which could afford a more removed platform from which to pursue issues still deemed neuralgic by some in [LOC Libya  ] . 
WHICH WILL PURSUE A " NAME AND SHAME " POLICY AND IS IN TOUCH WITH WESTERN [ORG NGOS  ] 3 . 
( C ) In his announcement at [LOC Davos  ] , [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam said that among the new organization 's goals was an initiative to develop a mechanism to identify individuals who had perpetrated human rights abuses , maintain a database listing details of those acts and target those individuals for sanctions . 
[PER Sawani  ] confirmed that organizations in attendance at the mid-February meeting had endorsed the " name and shame " policy , and said it would be initiated " soon " . 
Before [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam 's announcement in [LOC Davos  ] , contacts at the [ORG QDF  ] and the affiliated [ORG Human Rights Society of Libya  ] ( [ORG HRSL  ] ) told P/E Chief they were concerned that [LOC Libya  ] could open itself to considerable criticism if the new organziation actually implemented the plan . 
Externally-based [MISC Libyan  ] opposition groups have been carefully collecting information about the [ORG GOL  ] 's human rights abuses and would likely submit copious listing requests . 
Those contacts also expressed concern that [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam , who has had a series of disagreements in recent months with his brother , [PER Muatassim  ] ( the [ORG National Security Adviser  ] ) , and conservative regime elements ( some of whom would likely be eligible for listing as human rights abusers ) , could be giving his opponents within [LOC Libya  ] another cudgel with which to beat him . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sawani  ] said the [ORG AADDHR  ] had been in touch with [ORG Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch  ] about how to be an effective human rights organization . 
Following up on meetings between [MISC U.S.-based  ] human rights [ORG NGOs  ] and [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam during the latter 's visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] late last year , the [ORG AADDHR  ] has invited HRW , the [ORG National Democratic Institute  ] and [ORG International Republican Institute  ] to visit [LOC Libya  ] . 
In addition , [PER Sawani  ] and [PER Ali  ] applied for [LOC U.S.  ] visas on February 25 and expect to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] in the next several days to continue discussions with [LOC U.S.  ] human rights [ORG NGOs  ] . 
EFFICACY MAY DEPEND IN PART ON [ORG SAIF  ] AL-ISLAM'S STRUGGLE WITH CONSERVATIVE [MISC LIBYAN  ] REGIME ELEMENTS 5 . 
( C ) The announcement of the new organization at [LOC Davos  ] coincided with the arrest of Dr. [PER Juma'a Atiaga  ] , who was detained on allegations that he was involved in a banned political organization and had a hand in the 1984 assasination of [LOC Libya  ] 's former Ambassador to [LOC Rome  ] , [PER Ammar Daw  ] . 
In interviews with al-Sharq al-Awsat at the time , [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam decried the arrest as " ridiculous " . 
The [ORG QDF  ] issued a statement on its website calling for [PER Atiaga  ] 's release and criticizing [ORG GOL  ] authorities for having arrested [PER Atiaga  ] while ignoring other cases involving allegations of human rights abuses that the [ORG QDF  ] had brought to [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000196 002.2 OF 002 the attention of prosecutors . 
Well-informed contacts in [LOC Libya  ] have reported that Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , who has been engaged in a quiet struggle with [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam , ordered the Prosecutor General for north [LOC Tripoli  ] to make the arrest . 
Other reports suggest that [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi orchestrated the arrest through the Prime Minister 's office in retaliation for [ORG Saif  ] 's encroachment on a business deal [PER Muatassim  ] was trying to broker . 
[PER Atiaga  ] was released on February 16 , but the investigation against him continues . 
6 . 
( C ) Comment: Human rights remains one of the most sensitive issues in [LOC Libya  ] , particularly for conservative regime elements , many of whom personally played a part in the most serious transgressions of the late 1970 's and 1980 's . 
Most human rights initiatives backed by [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam and the [ORG QDF  ] ( the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses , families of victims of the 1996 Abu [PER Salim  ] prison massacre , the release of former [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Islamic Fighting Group  ] members ) have downplayed personal responsibility and focused on compensation as a means to resolve old grievances . 
Identifying and seeking to hold accountable specific individuals would be a significant evolution . 
While the [ORG AADDHR  ] is formally focused on events throughout the region , the fact that it is headquartered in [LOC Tripoli  ] and operating under [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam 's auspices will make it hard for old guard elements to swallow . 
The extent to which it is able to effectively operate - particularly with respect to allegations of abuses involving [MISC Libyan  ] officials - remains to be seen . 
[ORG Saif  ] al-Islam has a reputation for making sensational public announcements about new initiatives and then not following through . 
In that regard , the [ORG QDF  ] 's fitful role as a mediator in the case of detained human rights activist [PER Fathi el-Jahmi  ] ( ref A and previous ) , and the involvement of a senior lieutenant of [ORG Saif  ] 's in recent attacks against [PER Berbers  ] ( ref B ) , afford cautionary tales with respect to how much we can reasonably expect from the new-constituted [ORG AADDHR  ] . 
Nonetheless , the new organization could present a useful portal for USG and foreign NGO engagement with [LOC Libya  ] on human rights issues .
