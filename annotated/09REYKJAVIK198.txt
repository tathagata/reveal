( C ) With the [ORG Icesave  ] issue seeming on track , the government has directed its attention to completing the 2010 budget by the November 30 deadline under [MISC Icelandic  ] law . 
In an effort to address record deficits , the government is considering implementing significant budget cuts and tax increases , while also balancing the need to attract foreign investment ( reftels A and B ) . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] acknowledged that the goals in the 2010 budget are ambitious , due in part to the larger than expected drop in consumption .
