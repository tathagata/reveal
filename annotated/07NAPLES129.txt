( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: A series of law enforcement successes in [LOC Sicily  ] , including the arrest of a major mafia boss in November and a raid that netted 70 suspects on December 4 , has the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] reeling . 
Business owners have increasingly banded together , refusing to pay the protection money that has traditionally been a major source of mafia income . 
The success in combating organized crime in [LOC Sicily  ] stands in stark contrast to the general lack thereof in other regions of southern [LOC Italy  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) A string of law enforcement successes , combined with a rebellion by businesses against the payment of protection money , has the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] on the defensive . 
The latest round of government victories started with the November 5 arrest near [LOC Palermo  ] of powerful Mafia boss [PER Salvatore Lo Piccolo  ] and three of his associates . 
Police believed that [PER Lo Piccolo  ] had taken over the top post in the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] after the April 2006 arrest of [PER Bernardo Provenzano  ] , " the boss of all bosses . 
" The police and [PER Carabinieri  ] followed up with a joint raid on December 3 on the home in [LOC Gela  ] ( a heavily mafia-influenced town on the island 's southern coast ) of another local boss , [PER Daniele Emmanuello  ] . 
[PER Emmanuello  ] , wanted for murder and racketeering , was shot to death by police as he tried to flee . 
The next day , the [LOC Carabinieri  ] detained 70 people , including alleged mob boss [PER Vincenzo Santapaola  ] , in [LOC Catania  ] . 
[PER Santapaola  ] 's father , [PER Benedetto  ] , is serving a life sentence and is considered one of the [MISC Sicilian  ] mafia 's most feared leaders. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Business owners have been emboldened by the continuing string of law enforcement victories , with more and more reportedly refusing to pay extortion money ( known in [MISC Italian  ] slang as the " pizzo " ) , particularly since [PER Provenzano  ] 's arrest . 
According to the recent annual report issued by the [ORG National Traders Association  ] ( [ORG Conferescenti  ] ) , up to 80 percent of businesses in [LOC Palermo  ] and [LOC Catania  ] paid protection money in the past year , and the cost of extortion is higher in [LOC Sicily  ] than any other part of the country . 
Several anti-racket associations have been formed , reportedly with good results . 
The most prominent is " [PER Addio  ] pizzo " ( " Goodbye , pizzo " ) , formed in 2004 , which counts 210 traders and entrepreneurs as members and over 9,000 consumers committed to buy only at shops belonging to the " pizzo-free " list . 
[LOC Palermo  ] police and the prefect have agreed to discreetly look after the member shops . 
" [PER Addio  ] pizzo " has organized programs in more than 90 schools and educational institutes , with the participation of prosecutors and police , and also conducted a " pizzo-free " festival in one of [LOC Palermo  ] 's main plazas in May 2006 . 
( One of the association 's leaders has been selected for a [ORG State Department International Visitor  ] program in 2008 , which will focus on awakening public opinion to rule of law and supporting [ORG NGOs  ] who fight organized crime . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In September of this year , the [MISC Sicilian  ] branch of the industrialists' federation ( [ORG Confindustria  ] ) voted unanimously to expel any of its members who continue to pay the Mafia 's tax . 
The vote came in support of [PER Andrea Vecchio  ] , a well-known construction company owner who told the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] he would no longer pay . 
Since taking this bold decision , he has received four death threats and two of his building sites have been sabotaged . 
[PER Vecchio  ] and his family are now living under police protection. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) On November 11 , forty [MISC Sicilian  ] business owners launched a new " anti-pizzo " association to assist entrepreneurs who refuse to pay extortion money . 
The group is called " [PER Libero Futuro  ] , " which translates " Free Future , " but also pays homage to [PER Libero Grassi  ] , a [MISC Sicilian  ] businessman who was murdered in 1991 for refusing to pay the " pizzo . 
" In response to the organization 's founding , [LOC Palermo  ] mayor [PER Diego Cammarata  ] promised 50,000 euros to assist merchants who have been victims of extortion . 
The association 's inauguration was attended by national political leaders ; in fact , the auditorium was packed , whereas when a similar launch was attempted two years ago , only around 30 people showed up. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) During the night of November 26 , the offices of [ORG Confindustria  ] in the central [MISC Sicilian  ] city of [LOC Caltanissetta  ] were broken into , and computer disks containing confidential details of business owners backing a campaign against the payment of protection money were stolen . 
[ORG Confindustria  ] leaders immediately blamed the Mafia and declared that they would not be intimidated by the act. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The stunning law enforcement successes and a [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000129 002 OF 002 vocal public campaign against extortion have left the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] with its back to the wall . 
Most of the organization 's top-level bosses have been captured , but national anti-Mafia prosecutor [PER Piero Grasso  ] has stated that he has no intention of declaring the war over . 
According to [PER Grasso  ] , total victory requires a " cultural revolution , " in addition to arrests . 
Unfortunately , the success in [LOC Sicily  ] stands in stark contrast to the rest of southern [LOC Italy  ] , where significantly less progress has been made in fighting the [LOC Camorra  ] in [LOC Campania  ] and the 'Ndrangheta in [LOC Calabria  ] ( although there has been good success combating the [ORG Sacra Corona Unita  ] in [LOC Puglia  ] ) . 
Our local contacts in the anti-mafia prosecutor 's office tell us that it is hard to apply the [MISC Sicilian  ] model to these regions because these other groups consist of clans , many of which compete with each other , while the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] has more of a pyramid structure . 
Nonetheless , the disparity between the success in combating the [MISC Sicilian  ] mafia and the lack thereof elsewhere is striking .
