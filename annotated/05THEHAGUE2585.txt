( C ) Your trip to the [LOC Netherlands  ] comes at a time when Prime Minister [PER Jean-Pieter Balkenende  ] 's coalition government faces the lowest poll figures in [MISC Dutch  ] history . 
Much of the public and parliamentary criticism focuses on the government 's ambitious economic reform programs , but [MISC Dutch  ] military deployments overseas ( including in [ORG ISAF III  ] and [ORG NTM-I  ] ) and the government 's commitment to the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] program are also controversial . 
The national budget released on September 20 provides moderately increased funds for the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] , reversing a decade-long decline . 
Under Defense Minister [PER Henk Kamp  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] has recently reorganized to streamline decision-making and to increase the deployability of [MISC Dutch  ] forces . 
Your [ORG Defense  ] and [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) interlocutors are likely to seek your views on proposals for [ORG NATO  ] transformation . 
Should your schedule allow a visit to the [LOC HMS Van Amstel  ] , you will want to thank Defense Minister [PER Kamp  ] and the frigate 's crew for their hard work and timely assistance in support of [MISC Hurricane Katrina  ] relief efforts . 
[ORG Unpopular Balkenende Government  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Balkenende  ] government has fallen on tough times . 
A September 16 poll indicated that if national elections were held today , [ORG Balkenende  ] 's coalition would poll only 23.9 percent , down from 28.6 percent in 2003 . 
At the same time , the popularity of the opposition party [ORG Labor  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) is increasing , drawing 31.2 percent of today 's voters ( up from 27.3 percent in 2003 ) . 
With the national elections scheduled for May 2007 , many assume a new government will come to power headed by a more [ORG Euro-centric Labor  ] party . 
[ORG Labor  ] was highly critical of [MISC Dutch  ] participation in [LOC Iraq  ] , and has raised difficult questions in parliament regarding the deployment of special forces in support of the [MISC Afghan  ] elections . 
They are generally supportive of [MISC Dutch  ] participation in [LOC ISAF  ] . 
[ORG Labor  ] also actively opposed the [MISC Dutch  ] government 's involvement in developing the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) , although it does not necessarily oppose the purchase of the finished aircraft . 
[ORG Balkenende  ] 's government has pinned its hopes on turning around the struggling [MISC Dutch  ] economy through an ambitious -- and controversial -- economic reform program , but many observers consider this a long shot . 
All parties are now gearing up for municipal elections scheduled for March 2006 , which are widely viewed as a preview of the 2007 national elections . 
2006 [ORG Defense Budget Plans  ] ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] came out fairly strong in the September 20 presentation of the 2006 defense budget plans . 
Since 1994 , the [ORG MOD  ] has given up approximately 1.2 billion [MISC Euros  ] in cuts . 
This year 's budget sees a slight raise from 2005 ( 7.67 to 7.78 billion [MISC Euros  ] ) and includes funds to procure new equipment . 
This follows a massive ministry reorganization involving service command consolidation and staff cuts ( ref A ) . 
During a September 20 press conference , Defense Minister [PER Kamp  ] emphasized the need to continue to adapt to a changing security situation or risk becoming vulnerable . 
[ORG MOD  ] State Secretary [PER Cees van der Knaap  ] announced plans to buy two [MISC C-130s  ] ( 54 million [MISC Euros  ] ) and five new Chinook helicopters adapted for special forces missions from the [ORG USG  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] also intend to develop their armed forces into a " " full-fledged national security organization , " " including making 3,000 troops permanently available for civil authorities in response to crisis situations . 
The [ORG MOD  ] also will develop counter-terrorism plans to protect airspace and harbors . 
[ORG ISAF Stage III  ] -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As reported ref B , the [MISC Dutch  ] government is expected to make a positive decision by the end of October to deploy 1,000 - 1,2000 troops to [LOC Uruzghan  ] province in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in support of [ORG ISAF Stage III  ] . 
[ORG MOD  ] contacts hope parliamentary approval of the decision will follow shortly thereafter . 
Prior fulfillment of certain " " pre-conditions " " will help convince parliament , especially given concerns recently raised by the [ORG Labor Party  ] . 
Such pre-conditions include securing [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence and logistics support , establishing a [ORG PRT  ] partnership with [LOC Australia  ] , and cost-sharing to renovate [LOC Kandahar  ] airport . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have suggested that a pitch by the [ORG USG  ] might help convince [LOC Australia  ] to team with the [LOC Netherlands  ] in [LOC Uruzghan  ] , and may raise this and possible [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence and logistics support to the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG PRT  ] during your meetings . 
[ORG NATO  ] Transformation ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As reported ref C , Defense Minister [PER Kamp  ] took seriously [ORG NATO  ] SYG de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] 's request to think outside the box on [ORG NATO  ] transformation issues . 
During the recent informal [ORG NATO  ] defense ministerial in [LOC Berlin  ] , [PER Kamp  ] presented an 11-point paper that emphasized an expanded role for the [ORG NATO Response Force  ] ( [ORG NRF  ] ) , a greater [ORG NATO  ] role in maritime security , a major policy change in favor of [MISC European  ] missile defense , and increased [ORG NATO  ] coordination with the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG UN  ] , and the [ORG African Union  ] . 
Foreign Minister Bot has expressed similar views in recent public speeches on the need to transform [ORG NATO  ] into a more effective political decision-making entity . 
[MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors have been generally supportive of [LOC Washington  ] 's " " two summit " " approach focusing a first mini-summit in 2006 on transformation and a second in 2008 on enlargement . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have gently pushed for a greater [LOC US  ] role in the [ORG NRF  ] , and may raise this during your meetings . 
[ORG Force Protection for NTM-I  ] -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As reported reftel ref D , the [MISC Dutch  ] are willing to contribute up to 100 persons to participate in the [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission in [LOC Iraq  ] provided other Allies and partners also are willing to increase their participation . 
To date , the [MISC Dutch  ] have offered 25 persons for [ORG NTM-I  ] ; only 15 persons are currently deployed in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] contacts have indicated that the possibility of [MISC Dutch  ] contributions to force protection for [ORG NTM-I  ] is a non-starter , especially given the expected contentious debate in parliament over [MISC Dutch  ] participation in [ORG ISAF Stage III  ] . 
[ORG JSF  ] --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG JSF  ] is one of the most important issues we face in the [LOC Netherlands  ] ; your [MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors may raise it during your meetings . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have agreed to contribute $800 million to participate in the system development and demonstration phase , and now face a decision next year to purchase the fighter . 
The current government and the [ORG Air Force  ] wholeheartedly support the purchase , but [ORG Labor  ] is dragging its heels . 
Questions involving program delays and the [ORG Quadrennial Defense Review  ] have complicated the issue . 
The CEO of [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] will visit the [LOC Netherlands  ] the first week of October , officially " " to strengthen the trans-Atlantic relationship " " but also to build the case in favor of the purchase . 
HMS [ORG Van Amstel  ] -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The HMS van [LOC Amstel  ] is planning to return to the [LOC Netherlands  ] the day of your visit . 
The [ORG Van Amstel  ] has been at sea for six months on counter-narcotics operations in the [LOC Caribbean  ] , and was on its way back the [LOC Netherlands  ] when Hurricane [PER Katrina  ] struck . 
The [ORG Van Amstel  ] changed course , heading toward the hurricane-affected area , and was key in providing timely assistance to the [LOC Biloxi  ] area . 
The [ORG Van Amstel  ] had considerable press coverage here in the [LOC Netherlands  ] ; Charge hosted a press conference on [MISC Dutch  ] hurricane assistance in which he described the personnel aboard the [ORG Van Amstel  ] as heroes . 
Your participation in the small ceremony greeting the return of the [ORG Van Amstel  ] 's crew will go a long way in showing our appreciation to the [MISC Dutch  ] for their hard work and timely assistance . 
It also presents an opportunity to meet Defense Minister [PER Kamp  ] . 
Other Meetings -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) We also have scheduled meetings with [MISC Pieter  ] de [PER Gooijer  ] ( Deputy Director-General for Political Affairs , [ORG MFA  ] ) , and [PER Lo Casteleijn  ] ( Director , General Policy Affairs , [ORG MOD  ] ) . 
We are awaiting word from [PER Rob Swartbol  ] 's office ( Advisor to the Prime Minister ) regarding his availability . 
[ORG Van Der Knaap Trip  ] to [LOC Washington  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) MOD State Secretary [PER Van Der Knaap  ] plans to travel to [LOC Washington  ] next month . 
[PER Lo Casteleijn  ] has described van der [PER Knaap  ] as politically savvy , and influential on the [ORG JSF  ] decision . 
You should ask [PER Casteleijn  ] for his views on how to engage with [ORG Van Der Knaap  ] during his trip to [LOC Washington  ] .
