( U ) During the [ORG Summit of the Americas  ] in [LOC Trinidad and Tobago  ] April 17 - 19 , [MISC Surinamese  ] President [PER Ronald Venetiaan  ] reportedly complained to [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] about the alleged interference of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] into [LOC Suriname  ] 's internal domestic politics . 
On April 24th , local media reported that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Suriname  ] , [PER Francisco Simancas  ] , had left [LOC Suriname  ] for an unspecified period . 
The Ambassador denied that he was recalled and indicated that he was returning to [LOC Venezuela  ] for vacation. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT . 
Locally there is a wide-spread perception that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] strongly supports the [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) , the main opposition to the government 's ruling New Front-plus coalition of political parties . 
The [ORG NDP  ] is led by [PER Desi Bouterse  ] , former military strongman and main suspect in the trial of the 1982 murder of fifteen political opponents . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] staff consistently and openly attend [ORG NDP  ] events . 
Reportedly the [MISC Venezuelans  ] are far less enthusiastic in their support for other political parties . 
Rumors abound that the [MISC Venezuelans  ] may also be providing financial support to the [ORG NDP  ] -- all actions potentially perceived to oppose the current ruling coalition . 
END COMMENT .
