09 SECSTATE 31102 Classified By: [MISC Politcial-Economic  ] Counselor [PER Andrew C. Mann  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This cable follows up on post 's " " [LOC Netherlands  ] /Afghanistan: Getting to YES post-2010 " " ( reftel C ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] consensus-based political process for post-2010 commitments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] remains on track for a Cabinet decision in the fall followed by a parliamentary review in late 2009 or early 2010 . 
We understand [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) leader/Deputy PM/Finance Minister [PER Wouter Bos  ] is the only cabinet member not in agreement with the details of a continued role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] consider this an internal decision ; overt lobbying will likely provoke greater resistance to our desired goal . 
Therefore , discreet , coordinated engagement is necessary to assist committed [MISC Dutch  ] leaders in gaining consensus from [PER Bos  ] and later approval by Parliament . 
END SUMMARY. ---------- The Stakes ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] ( [MISC Christian Democrats  ] - [ORG CDA  ] ) , Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) and Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] ( [ORG Christian Union  ] - [ORG CU  ] ) reportedly agree the [MISC Dutch  ] should support most of the " " [LOC Afghanistan  ] Asks " " ( reftel E ) . 
Specifically they want to retain the [ORG Provisional Reconstruction Team  ] ( [ORG PRT  ] ) in [LOC Uruzgan  ] with a force protection of up to 500 personnel , and provide [MISC F-16  ] 's , intelligence assets , airlift and attack helicopters , military trainers and mentors , police mentors , medical units , special operations forces , support for counter-narcotics initiatives , agricultural development , and increased support for governance and development programs . 
[PER Bos  ] , however , is highly skeptical and he has failed to tip his hand as to his actual position yet . 
We understand he may be supportive of most " " asks " " except the [ORG PRT  ] and helicopter assets. ------------------- The Critical Player ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Verhagen  ] recently expressed great concern about the [ORG Labor Party  ] and specifically [PER Bos  ] , who continues to balk at the [MISC Dutch  ] presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , particularly in [LOC Uruzgan  ] post-2010 . 
Privately , [PER Verhagen  ] stated the [ORG Labor Party  ] could support " " staying in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in some roles but not continue in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
" " This contrasts with confidential comments from the [ORG Labor Party  ] defense spokesperson , [ORG MP Angelien Eijsink  ] , who favored continuing the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] because of the investments to date in time , effort , funds and lives . 
Additionally , she stated that as a member of [ORG NATO  ] the [MISC Dutch  ] have a commitment to remain a viable part of the mission . 
However , for the [ORG Labor Party  ] to support continuing with the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , she said there must be a clear understanding and commitment that the mission is solely dedicated to " " stabilization and reconstruction . 
" " <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The poor showing of the [ORG Labor Party  ] in the June [MISC European  ] Parliament elections ( dropping from 23.7% of the vote in 2004 to 12% , its all time lowest vote percentage in any election ) has put [PER Bos  ] under pressure from the rank and Qany election ) has put [PER Bos  ] under pressure from the rank and file supporters , who generally oppose the military mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
His leadership of the party is questioned regularly in the press - [ORG Labor Party  ] faithful complain [PER Bos  ] gave in on authorizing the purchase of a JSF test aircraft earlier this year even in this difficult economic environment and they are concerned the party leadership will support raising the retirement age in Cabinet deliberations this autumn . 
Still , as the party leader , he is key to the future of the [MISC Dutch  ] engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] beyond 2010 . 
THE HAGUE 00000418 002 OF 003 -------------------- Engagement Strategy -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Our outreach plan and talking points detailed in reftel C remain the basis for our engagement with the [MISC Dutch:  ] - We appreciate the long-standing and significant contribution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , specifically in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , that the [MISC Dutch  ] have made. - The [MISC Dutch  ] are a valued partner in [ORG NATO  ] 's efforts to address a common threat in a dangerous region. - While it is an internal decision by the [MISC Dutch  ] whether they will stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , we hope they will continue with other [ORG NATO  ] allies and other countries in [ORG ISAF  ] as it implements its new strategy. - We hope the [MISC Dutch  ] will continue their stability and development efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] to build upon the considerable [MISC Dutch  ] achievements there. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Bos  ] , as Finance Minister and party leader , does not deal directly with [LOC Afghanistan  ] on a regular basis . 
[PER Bos  ] is extremely skeptical of any discussion on this subject by [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
He considers any discussion about post-2010 [LOC Afghanistan  ] engagement to be an internal [MISC Dutch  ] political decision . 
Reportedly , [PER Bos  ] " " was not surprised " " but " " not pleased " " when [LOC Afghanistan  ] was brought up in his June 29 meeting with Secretary [PER Geithner  ] . 
He argued the [LOC Netherlands  ] was a small country which had already been doing its fair share in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He also suggested other , bigger countries were not pulling their weight. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Success in getting the [MISC Dutch  ] to keep their [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] will hinge upon the [ORG Labor Party  ] 's recognition that the [LOC Uruzgan  ] mission is developmental in nature and sustained commitment is needed to ensure the success of their peacebuilding and development investments there . 
The [ORG Labor Party  ] could also be influenced by how much other countries are " " stepping up to the plate " " in support of [ORG ISAF  ] 's new strategy. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Cabinet has started its summer break , until mid-August . 
When it returns , it will focus on the budget which must be agreed on and presented to Parliament by September 15 ( Prinsjesdag ) . 
Since [PER Bos  ] is Finance Minister , he will be pre-occupied until then. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) MFA Deputy Director General [PER Robert de Groot  ] discussed a plan with POLMILOFF on July 2 for engaging [PER Bos  ] in forums considered to be " " inclusive " " - to avoid the appearance of outside pressure . 
He suggested a cascade of visits/forums/meetings involving USNATO Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] , SRAP Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] , and perhaps [ORG UN Special Representative Kai  ] [PER Eide  ] . 
Obviously , we will take our cue from the discussions PM [PER Balkenende  ] has with the President in [LOC Washington  ] July 14 . 
After that , we suggest using the courtesy call on [PER Bos  ] by the new [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to the [LOC Netherlands  ] ( whenever confirmed and credentials presented ) to find out what his concerns are , with an offer to put [PER Bos  ] in contact with those senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials who can respond to them . 
We anticipate having USNATO Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] give a public address on the new [ORG NATO  ] strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the autumn . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] , CENTCOM Commander , is planning to visit the [LOC Netherlands  ] in mid/late September to participate in commemoration activities for [ORG WW II  ] 65th anniversary Qcommemoration activities for [ORG WW II  ] 65th anniversary liberation events . 
We hope to have him speak to a small group of parliamentarians , if his schedule permits . 
Likely at the invitation of FM [PER Verhagen  ] or [ORG Development Cooperation Minister Koenders  ] ( both of whom he has met ) , SRAP Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] could then follow up with a visit and talk effectively about the new strategy , the importance of [MISC Dutch  ] 3D efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] and the contributions other countries are making. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We continue to be on the lookout for opportunities to engage with decision makers locally as well as having [LOC Washington  ] leaders meet with senior [MISC Dutch  ] officials . 
Furthermore , we continue to engage other members of the [ORG Labor Party  ] who may be able to exert influence on [PER Bos  ] in the run-up to the cabinet decision . 
[ORG Development Cooperation Minister  ] THE HAGUE 00000418 003 OF 003 [ORG Koenders  ] , [ORG Defense Spokesperson Eijsink  ] , Floor Leader [PER Mariette Hammer  ] , and [ORG Foreign Affairs Spokesperson MP  ] Martijn van Dam to name a few . 
It will take teamwork and coordinated engagement with the [MISC Dutch  ] at all levels to ultimately obtain their commitment post-2010 .
