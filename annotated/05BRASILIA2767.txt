STATE  ] 183800 B. [LOC BRASILIA  ] 1396 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Officer [PER Bisola Ojikutu  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action cable . 
Please see paragraph four for action request. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On October 13 , poloff delivered reftel talking points to [PER Marcelo Bohlke  ] at [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of External Relations United Nations Division  ] ( [ORG DNU  ] ) . 
Poloff also provided points to [PER Marcia Ramos  ] at the [ORG Ministry  ] 's [ORG Human Rights Division  ] ( [ORG DDH  ] ) and [PER Marcelo Fagundes  ] at the [ORG International Organizations Division  ] ( [ORG DOI  ] ) on October 14. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ramos  ] told poloff that the [ORG GOB  ] cannot accept [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] migrants because it is illegal to designate someone not on [MISC Brazilian  ] soil a refugee . 
According to the [MISC Brazilian National Committee  ] for Refugees ( [ORG CONARE  ] ) , refugee status in [LOC Brazil  ] for an applicant abroad is not usually granted until after the refugee has received refugee status from the country where the refugee is located when petitioning for status in [LOC Brazil  ] ( in this case , the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) . 
The [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG CONARE  ] believe that the migrants at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] do not fit into this category because the [ORG USG  ] has not " formally recognized " them as refugees . 
If they were formally recognized , the [ORG USG  ] would allow resettlement in the [LOC U.S.  ] , a [ORG CONARE  ] representative told poloff during a similar discussion in May . 
[ORG CONARE  ] also told poloff that the [ORG GOB  ] 's position on accepting refugees from [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] , regardless of nationality , has not changed since 2003 and will likely not change in the foreseeable future. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action Request: [PER Bohlke  ] said he understood the urgency of our request , he told poloff that the [ORG GOB  ] would " probably not " be able to resettle the [ORG Uighurs  ] due to [MISC Brazilian  ] regulations . 
However , [PER Bolhke  ] told poloff that before providing a definitive response to our request , he would like an explanation as to why [ORG Uighurs  ] are not eligible for refugee status or resettlement in the [LOC U.S.  ] Post would appreciate guidance from the [ORG Department regarding Bohlke  ] 's request . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Post has discussed the resettlement of [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detainees on numerous occasions and at a variety of levels , including [PER U/S Grossman  ] , since 2003 . 
Given [MISC Brazilian  ] legislation and [ORG CONARE  ] 's and the [ORG GOB  ] 's comments , it does not appear that the [ORG GOB  ] will accept [ORG Uighurs  ] detainees if they are not granted refugee status by the [ORG USG  ] . 
And , even if the [ORG Uighurs  ] were granted such status by the [LOC U.S.  ] , we expect the [MISC Brazilians  ] would argue that they should then be resettled in the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC DANILOVICH</pre></code>  ]
