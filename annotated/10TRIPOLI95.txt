REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
According to a local political observer [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the family has been in a tailspin lately , trying to put a stop to one rumor or another , in the name of defending the family 's honor . 
From [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi 's headline-grabbing [LOC St. Bart  ] 's [MISC New Year  ] 's Eve bash to [PER Hannibal  ] 's latest violent outburst , the [MISC Qadhafi  ] family has provided local observers with enough dirt for a [MISC Libyan  ] soap opera . 
Meanwhile , as his brothers , sister , and mother scurry to cover-up scandals , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam seems to be strategically disengaged , traveling in [LOC New Zealand  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] , and focusing on [LOC Haiti  ] relief efforts . 
The widening contrast between the respectable , cultured image that [PER Saif  ] has taken on and the spoiled , boorish image his siblings project has local audiences rallying behind [PER Saif  ] as the next heir to the [MISC Qadhafi  ] throne . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A local political observer [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the [MISC Qadhafi  ] family has been consumed in recent weeks by efforts to control the damage from [PER Mutassim  ] and [PER Hannibal  ] 's recent headline-grabbing behavior . 
[ORG National Security Advisor Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi kicked off 2010 in the same way he spent 2009 -- with a [MISC New Year  ] 's Eve trip to [LOC St. Bart  ] 's -- reportedly featuring copious amounts of alcohol and a million-dollar personal concert courtesy of Beyonce , Usher , and other musicians . 
[PER Mutassim  ] seemed to be surprised by the fact that his party was photographed and the focus of international media attention . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , his carousing and extravagance angered some locals , who viewed his activities as impious and embarrassing to the nation . 
Others took the events and rumors surrounding it as further argument that [PER Mutassim  ] -- often considered to be a rival of brother [PER Saif  ] al-Islam to succeed his father -- is not fit to be the next leader of the country . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] ambassador recently told the Ambassador that the [MISC Egyptians  ] had been bracing for retribution after an [MISC Egyptian  ] newspaper published the report of [PER Mutassim  ] 's carousing. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Days before [PER Mutassim  ] 's extravagant display , international press reported that his brother [PER Hannibal  ] had physically abused his wife , [PER Aline  ] , in a [LOC London  ] hotel room over [MISC Christmas  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Aline  ] had threatened to leave [PER Hannibal  ] a few weeks before the incident and had fled to [LOC London  ] . 
When [LOC Safiya  ] , [PER Hannibal  ] 's mother , heard the news , she pleaded with [PER Aline  ] by phone to return to [LOC Tripoli  ] , promising to give her " whatever she desired , " in exchange . 
[PER Hannibal  ] pursued [PER Aline  ] in [LOC London  ] , and the encounter ended in assault . 
When [LOC Safiya  ] and [PER Hannibal  ] 's sister , [PER Ayesha  ] al-Qadhafi ( at that time many months' pregnant ) , heard the news , [PER Ayesha  ] traveled to [LOC London  ] to intervene . 
Both [MISC Qadhafi  ] women -- [LOC Safiya  ] by phone and [PER Ayesha  ] in person -- advised [PER Aline  ] to report to the police that she had been hurt in an " accident , " and not to mention anything about abuse . 
[LOC London  ] press reported that [PER Hannibal  ] was allowed to leave the [LOC UK  ] discreetly , on diplomatic immunity. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the meantime , heir-apparent [PER Saif  ] al-Islam has been opportunely disengaged from local affairs . 
According to his staff and press reports , [PER Saif  ] celebrated the [MISC New Year  ] far away from [LOC Tripoli  ] in a small [LOC New Zealand  ] town of 8,000 people , on a hunting trip . 
He spent a week in mid-January hunting as well , in [LOC Western Algeria  ] , according to [MISC Algerian  ] press . 
[PER Saif  ] 's [ORG Qadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation  ] has recently been active in the [LOC Haiti  ] relief effort , sending hundreds of tons of supplies . 
[PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's inner circle has been officially dismissive of any reports that he may accept the " General Coordinator " position to which he was appointed by his father in early October . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Saif  ] did not want to be " tainted " by the current political environment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Young [MISC Libyan  ] contacts have repeated over the last few weeks that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam is the " hope " of " [LOC Libya  ] al-Ghad " ( [LOC Libya  ] of tomorrow ) , with men in their twenties saying that they aspire to be like [PER Saif  ] and think he is the right person to run the country . 
They describe him as educated , cultured , and someone who wants a better future for [LOC Libya  ] . 
By comparison , when asked about the prospects of [PER Mutassim  ] , [PER Hannibal  ] , or the other brothers as leaders of country , young contacts shake their heads and point to their famously irresponsible behavior as more reason to hope that [PER Saif  ] will succeed his father. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Amidst the [MISC Qadhafi  ] family antics , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam has wisely distanced himself from the local drama . 
While no stranger to the playboy lifestyle himself , [PER Saif  ] has managed to keep international press coverage of his activities benign . 
[PER Saif  ] seems to be making progress in casting himself as a humanitarian , philanthropist , and reformer . 
In so doing , [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000095 002.2 OF 002 [MISC Libyans  ] cannot help but to contrast his brothers' spoiled behavior with the mature , respectable image that [PER Saif  ] projects . 
If [PER Saif  ] al-Islam does intend to accept an official role in the near future , domestic audiences -- particularly among [LOC Libya  ] 's swelling ranks of young adults -- may welcome him as [LOC Libya  ] 's knight in shining armor . 
End comment .
