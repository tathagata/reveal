The controllers reached an agreement with airport authorities almost immediately and the strike ended after just two hours . 
The agreement includes a 4.75 percent increase in pay with an additional increase of 3 percent to be added in February 2009 . 
Cumulatively , this will result in an 11 percent increase in wages for air traffic controllers . 
Air traffic controller instructors are also to receive an increased fee of .5 percent for each student taught . 
To address working hours , the agreement calls for the hiring of more air traffic controllers. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 .

[PER Ragnhildur Hjaltadottir  ] , Permanent Secretary of the [ORG Ministry of Communication  ] , confirmed the terms of the agreement to Pol Intern and also stressed that there was no official involvement of the government in the agreement .
