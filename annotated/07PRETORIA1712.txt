Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
[PER PolOff  ] and PolAsst’s trip to [LOC Limpopo Province  ] on 24 April confirmed press reports that Zuma’s camp has made inroads in gaining provincial support for [ORG Zuma  ] as [ORG ANC  ] President , but the province remains split and difficult to call . 
As expected , Zuma’s supporters were fervent but short on substance , never making a case for what [ORG Zuma  ] would bring to the party as [ORG ANC  ] President . 
Instead , they emphasized that the [ORG ANC  ] as an institution is greater than the sum of its members , dismissing the importance of leadership in the process . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------------------------- A LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT WAS TO COME ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER PolOff  ] and PolAsst traveled to [LOC Limpopo Province  ] on 24 April to gauge support for the upcoming [ORG ANC  ] presidential election . 
Though several officials agreed to meet , some refused . 
[PER Joshua Matlou  ] , [ORG ANC Youth League  ] ( [ORG ANCYL  ] ) Provincial [PER Chairperson  ] , told PolAsst that “it would be useless for both of us since I would only talk about things that are in the newspaper.” [PER Matlou  ] added that [ORG ANC  ] members do not trust [MISC American  ] diplomats because “they have seen what the [LOC U.S.  ] government does to elections in other countries when they do not like the locally preferred candidate.” [PER Matlou  ] believes this attitude cuts across the spectrum of [ORG ANC  ] members . 
( NOTE: With almost 53,000 [ORG ANC  ] members , [ORG Limpopo  ] is the [ORG ANC  ] , s fourth-largest province after [ORG Eastern Cape  ] , [LOC Gauteng  ] , and [ORG KwaZulu-Natal  ] . 
At the 2002 national conference , it fielded 324 candidates , almost twice those of the smallest province , the [ORG Northern Cape  ] , but half that of the largest , [ORG Eastern Cape  ] . 
[ORG Limpopo  ] will host the December 2007 [ORG ANC  ] conference where the next [ORG ANC President  ] will be chosen . 
END NOTE ) ------------------------------- [ORG ANC  ] LARGER THAN LIFE , LITERALLY ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG ANC  ] Provincial Secretary [PER Cassel Mathale  ] refused to be drawn into a conversation about who he supports for [ORG ANC  ] President , even though he is widely reported to be pro-Zuma . 
Instead , [PER Mathale  ] , who was polite , persistent , and yet unpersuasive , argued that the [ORG ANC  ] as a party is so strong that it does not matter who becomes President . 
He added that the [ORG ANC  ] would soon be finishing what it started in 1994 -- building strong institutions so that no one person would have too much power . 
( COMMENT: This is likely a reference to next month’s [ORG ANC  ] policy conference which will debate transferring some powers from the [ORG ANC President  ] to the [ORG ANC  ] Secretary General ( septel ) . 
END COMMENT ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Rosina Semenya  ] , Provincial Minister for [ORG Public Works  ] and the [ORG ANC Women’s League’s  ] ( [ORG ANCWL  ] ) Provincial [PER Chairperson  ] , echoed Mathale’s comments that the [ORG ANC  ] as a party , institution , and culture is more important than any individual leader . 
When asked how the [ORG ANCWL  ] and [ORG ANCYL  ] work together at the provincial level given the [MISC ANCYL’s  ] outspoken support of [ORG Zuma  ] , [PER Semenya  ] surprisingly asked what was wrong with [ORG Zuma  ] . 
She added that “people should be willing to overlook certain qualities if someone was brought up in [ORG ANC  ] culture and tradition . 
That is what is most important.” To maintain and enrich this tradition , she told us the [ORG ANC  ] is creating a policy institute to inculcate its members in [ORG ANC  ] policies and that former controversial [LOC Limpopo Premier  ] [PER Ngoako Ramathlodi  ] , who fell out of favor with [PER Mbeki  ] last year , is in charge of the project . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX END NOTE ) ------------------------------------ YOUTH LEAGUE: YOUR WORST BEST FRIEND ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG ANCYL  ] Provincial Secretary [PER Julius Malema  ] , who was frank and friendly , started the conversation with stories of his “young pioneer” days when the [ORG ANC  ] taught him how to use a gun 17 years ago , at the tender age of 9 . 
He then boasted that Limpopo’s [ORG ANCYL  ] has more members than any other province and is “100 percent united” in its support of [ORG Zuma  ] . 
[PER Malema  ] never explained why he or the league supports [ORG Zuma  ] , but did [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00001712 002 OF 002 admit that [ORG Zuma  ] would likely not have been picked up by the [ORG ANCYL  ] “if [PER Mbeki  ] hadn’t gone after him.” [PER Malema  ] stated matter of factly that [ORG Zuma  ] is “a victim of a conspiracy similar to what would happen in [MISC American  ] politics.” When [PER PolOff  ] politely challenged him about his analogy , he backed off and said , “Well , that’s how it’s portrayed in movies.” When asked what triggered the loss of Mbeki’s support from the [ORG ANCYL  ] , he replied that “Mbeki thinks he’s too clever for all of us and he won’t engage with us.” In a subsequent aside , [PER Malema  ] admitted that [ORG ANCYL  ] President [PER Fikile Mbalula  ] did not want to support [ORG Zuma  ] during the rape trial but that the regional leadership insisted , arguing that if the [ORG YL  ] defended [ORG Zuma  ] on corruption charges , they could defend him on rape charges since both acts are immoral . 
He also hinted that [PER Fikile  ] was told his position depended on his support of [LOC Zuma.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER PolOff  ] was shut down every time she tried to turn the discussion to other potential candidates . 
When asked about the possibility of a female successor , [PER Malema  ] dismissed the idea , saying [LOC South Africa  ] needs a “man who is ahead on issues , but who can walk with the masses.” He also dismissed [PER Tokyo Sexwale  ] saying he had his chance . 
When asked if Tokyo’s involvement in big business soured the [ORG ANCYL  ] , he said that he is not against the rich , just capitalists , but that [PER Sexwale  ] is not a capitalist “because he only owns shares of companies , not actual means of production.” ( COMMENT: [PER Malema  ] wore a sweatshirt with [ORG NIKE  ] emblazoned on it and also complained about the bank’s right to repossess his [ORG Audi  ] if he does not make payments . 
END COMMENT ) When asked what the league plans on doing if [ORG Zuma  ] goes to jail , he said they would accept the decision and throw their support behind [ORG ANC  ] Secretary General [PER Kgalema Motlanthe  ] . 
However , he added that SIPDIS though “Motlanthe is brilliant , you can’t understand anything he says.” --------------------------------------- [ORG LIMPOPO  ] UNLIKELY TO LAY CARDS DOWN SOON --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Mathale  ] told us that [ORG Limpopo  ] will hold its provincial conference to declare its candidate for [ORG ANC  ] President in late November or early December , but admitted that the province will know long before the conference where the regions stand . 
In fact , soon after the June policy conference , the [ORG ANC  ] will send out a communiqu urging regions to start sending in their preferred names and delegates . 
[PER Semenya  ] also said that Limpopo’s [ORG ANCWL  ] has not yet set a date for its provincial conference , but will wait until after June’s policy conference as to not “distract from [ORG ANC  ] policymaking.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Malema  ] could not say when [ORG Limpopo  ] would hold its regional conference , but did mention that the national [ORG ANCYL  ] would not be holding a conference at all this year ( in violation of its constitutional requirement to do so every three years ) , having already decided to support [ORG Zuma  ] . 
[PER Malema  ] justified the position by echoing Fikile’s statements that the league “already has leaders in place who can influence the outcome and that they want to keep it that way.” When asked how this strategy differs from the [ORG ANC’s Eastern Cape  ] youth league , which was “officially” disbanded in part because they had not held their regional conference in time , [PER Malema  ] said with a straight face that [ORG Eastern Cape  ] postponed for a year , while the national level is only postponing six months . 
( COMMENT: [ORG Eastern Cape’s  ] [ORG ANCYL  ] branch was disbanded unofficially because of its support of [ORG Eastern Cape’s  ] call for a third term for [PER Mbeki  ] . 
END COMMENT ) ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite the fact that most of those free ( or willing ) to talk with us were pro-Zuma , we should not overestimate his supporters’ bark nor discount the pro-Mbeki camp within the province . 
The [ORG ANCWL  ] and [ORG ANCYL  ] will have approximately 53 votes each for the entire country in December , likely a third to a quarter of Limpopo’s vote as a province . 
Moreover , heavyweights like Limpopo’s Premier [PER Sello Moloto  ] , [ORG ANC Regional  ] Secretary [PER David Magabe  ] , and [ORG ANC Regional  ] [PER Chairperson Dickson  ] Masemola are pro-Mbeki , having publicly declared their continuing support to the current elected leadership .
