( C ) Summary: [LOC China  ] has made great efforts to improve the situation in [LOC Burma  ] , stretching the boundaries of its policy of non-interference , [ORG MFA  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] think tank interlocutors told [ORG HFAC  ] and [ORG SFRC  ] staff members January 10-11 . 
[ORG MFA  ] says [LOC China  ] is contemplating next steps to address the current “standstill” in [LOC Burma  ] , but [MISC Chinese  ] scholars said domestic events and other international issues will draw [ORG China’s  ] attention away from [LOC Burma  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] officials and the scholars continue to encourage direct talks between the [LOC United States  ] and the [MISC Burmese  ] regime . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MFA Asia Department  ] Counselor [PER Yang Jian  ] and [ORG Ministry of State Security-affiliated China Institutes for Contemporary International Relations  ] ( [ORG CICIR  ] ) [ORG Asia  ] scholars [PER Zhai Kun  ] and [PER Zhang Xuegang  ] met [ORG HFAC  ] professional staff members [PER Eric Richardson  ] and [PER Dennis Halpin  ] and [ORG SFRC  ] professional staff member [PER Frank Januzzi  ] on January 10-11. “Bold Measures” Necessary to Prevent Further Turmoil --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Counselor [PER Yang Jian  ] told the [ORG HFAC  ] and [ORG SFRC  ] staff members January 11 that [LOC China  ] would like to see the [MISC Burmese  ] Government take “bold measures” to improve the livelihood of the [MISC Burmese  ] people and achieve national reconciliation through dialogue with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] and democracy supporters as well as ethnic minority groups . 
Counselor [PER Yang  ] stated that the [MISC Chinese  ] accept the [MISC Burmese  ] regime’s so-called “roadmap” to democracy as the best route to democracy and national reconciliation in [LOC Burma  ] . 
[ORG CICIR  ] scholar [PER Zhai  ] said the [MISC Burmese  ] government exerts control over society only on the surface and the potential for “lots of trouble” persists . 
[PER Zhai  ] said the regime’s inept handling of the economy costs it legitimacy . 
Even if the [MISC Burmese  ] generals and [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] undertook a healthy dialogue , economic problems could throw the country into turmoil . 
Encouraging Signs but Current Standstill ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Yang  ] said despite the potential for further trouble , the [MISC Chinese  ] government is encouraged by a number of developments since the disturbances in August and September , including the visits of [ORG UN Special Advisor Ibrahim Gambari  ] , the appointment of Labor Minister [PER Aung Kyi  ] ( who [PER Yang  ] believes is “close to the core” of the [MISC Burmese  ] regime ) as a liaison with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , and the release of detainees . 
[PER Yang  ] said that during [PER VFM Wang  ] Yi’s November 2007 visit to [LOC Burma  ] ( reftel ) , [PER Wang  ] shared with senior [MISC Burmese  ] leaders [ORG China’s  ] analysis , again suggesting more attention to the livelihood of the [MISC Burmese  ] people , dialogue with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , and more interaction with [ORG ASEAN  ] . 
[PER Yang  ] said that , based on the regime’s positive language about the dialogue , [LOC China  ] had been optimistic it would succeed . 
In light of the current “standstill” in [LOC Burma  ] , however , [LOC China  ] is thinking about what other steps now to take with the regime . 
[ORG China’s  ] “Extraordinary” Efforts ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Yang  ] recounted [ORG China’s  ] efforts to improve the situation in [LOC Burma  ] . 
She said that after [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] in January 2007 vetoed a [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution condemning [LOC Burma  ] , State Councilor [PER Tang Jiaxuan  ] traveled to [LOC Burma  ] in February to hold “extraordinary” discussions with the regime’s senior leaders . 
[PER Tang  ] suggested that Senior General [PER Than Shwe  ] and other [MISC Burmese  ] leaders improve Burma’s domestic and international situation . 
[PER Yang  ] said lower level [MISC Burmese  ] officials , hesitant to approach senior leaders with critical advice , were pleased with [ORG China’s  ] approach to [PER Than Shwe.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Scholars [PER Zhai Kun  ] and [PER Zhang Xuegang  ] January 10 separately echoed the view that [LOC China  ] is making great efforts to influence [LOC Burma  ] positively while adhering to its policy of non-interference . 
[PER Zhai  ] said [LOC China  ] has delivered indirect but clear signals to [MISC Asian  ] countries and the [LOC United States  ] on the need for greater openness in [LOC Burma  ] . 
[PER Zhai  ] highlighted Premier [PER Wen Jiabao’s  ] November 19 speech at the [ORG National University of Singapore  ] . 
( [PER Note: Wen’s  ] speech included the following: “Only an open and inclusive nation can be strong and [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000125 002 OF 003 prosperous ; cutting off contacts with the outside world can make a country backward.” ) Direct [ORG U.S.-Burma Dialogue  ] -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) During the [PER Wang Yi  ] visit , [MISC Burmese  ] leaders expressed interest in more discussions with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Noting that USG officials have suggested [MISC Burmese  ] officials contact our Embassy in [LOC Rangoon  ] , [PER Yang  ] said [LOC Burma  ] preferred the format of the June 2007 talks in [LOC Beijing  ] . 
[LOC China  ] views the June meetings between the [MISC Burmese  ] delegation and [ORG State Department  ] officials as a “bilateral confidence building measure , ” [PER Yang  ] said . 
Continued Support for [ORG Gambari  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Yang  ] said [LOC China  ] will continue to support [ORG UN Special Advisor Gambari’s  ] mission , though she noted that the [MISC Burmese  ] Government is unhappy with [ORG Gambari  ] because [MISC Burmese  ] leaders believe they followed [ORG Gambari’s  ] suggestions during his first visit but then received only further opprobrium . 
[PER Yang  ] said [MISC Burmese  ] leaders are unhappy about the [ORG UN  ] “Group of [LOC Friends”  ] on [LOC Burma  ] . 
While [LOC China  ] is open to multilateral means to address the situation in [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC China  ] believes Burma’s acceptance of these means is the key to success . 
For example , [LOC China  ] would like [ORG ASEAN  ] to play a more constructive role , [PER Yang  ] said , but [ORG ASEAN  ] is divided over how to address [LOC Burma  ] . 
Older [ORG ASEAN  ] member countries , such as [LOC Indonesia  ] , [LOC Malaysia  ] , [LOC Thailand  ] and [LOC Singapore  ] , favor a hard-line approach . 
Newer [ORG ASEAN  ] members , such as [LOC Cambodia  ] , [LOC Laos  ] and [LOC Vietnam  ] , support a more moderate stance towards [LOC Burma  ] . 
No Sanctions ------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) MFA’s [PER Yang  ] reiterated that [LOC China  ] remains opposed to additional sanctions , which she said will not spur further dialogue , but instead make the regime look further inward and give it an excuse for hard-line polices . 
Despite [ORG China’s  ] opposition to sanctions , [PER Yang  ] stressed that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] have similar goals for [LOC Burma  ] , including stability , democracy and development . 
Therefore , [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] should show unity , particularly in the [ORG UN  ] , in addressing the situation in [LOC Burma  ] . 
[ORG CICIR  ] scholar [PER Zhai  ] said that because [LOC China  ] foremost values stability in [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC China  ] does not wish to see a sudden change in the [MISC Burmese  ] regime . 
In that light , [LOC China  ] fears the pressure of more sanctions may only bring further civil unrest . 
[ORG China’s  ] attention drawn away from [LOC Burma  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) CICIR’s [PER Zhai  ] said [LOC China  ] would like to see [ORG ASEAN  ] play a larger role on [LOC Burma  ] partly because domestic events in [LOC China  ] , including the [ORG National People’s Congress  ] in March and the [MISC Olympics  ] in August , are increasingly consuming [ORG China’s  ] attention . 
[PER Zhai  ] said recent protests in [LOC Vietnam  ] over the [ORG South China Sea  ] and the turmoil in [LOC Pakistan  ] have also drawn [ORG China’s  ] and international attention away from [LOC Burma  ] . 
Including democracy supporters slows down roadmap --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Zhai  ] said that including the democratic opposition and ethnic groups in the so-called roadmap to democracy at this stage would slow down the process , yet [PER Zhai  ] asserted that “if Senior General [PER Than Shwe  ] is rational , ” he will include the democratic opposition to increase the legitimacy of the current regime . 
USG should assure safe future for [MISC Burmese  ] generals --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) CICIR’s [PER Zhang  ] said that the [LOC United States  ] should “play two hands” with the [MISC Burmese  ] Government . 
[PER Zhang  ] said the [LOC United States  ] has been sufficiently critical of the regime and now should send messages , via [LOC China  ] if necessary , to reassure [MISC Burmese  ] military leaders that their personal security would not be imperiled in a democratic transition . 
[PER Zhang  ] said that guaranteeing the safe future of the current military leadership is the key to “unlocking the deadlock.” <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [ORG HFAC  ] and [ORG SFRC  ] staff members did not have an opportunity to clear this cable .
