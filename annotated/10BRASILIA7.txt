( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] broke with normal protocol and practice to meet with incoming Ambassador [PER Thomas Shannon January  ] 8 . 
The Ambassador had earlier presented copies of his credentials to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
He will present his credentials officially to President [PER Lula  ] on February 4. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] welcomed the Ambassador 's arrival , calling it an important and necessary step in deepening the bilateral relationship and [LOC Brazil  ] 's dialogue with the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
He noted with frustration the several month delay in the confirmation process , asserting that both countries had " lost precious time . 
" He affirmed his commitment to working to build a more extensive and more strategic dialogue that would capture the increasingly global nature of our relationship . 
He expressed hope that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] could visit soon , and welcomed the upcoming visit of Under Secretary [PER Burns.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] said areas of convergence in our relationship far outweighed the differences . 
He noted that the differences were " manageable , " but said they would be exploited by the press and the political opposition to create the impression of a more serious divide . 
He urged the Ambassador to help fashion an " intense and robust " process of consultation that would promote transparency and understanding as both countries addressed pressing global concerns. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador welcomed [PER Amorim  ] 's call for deeper dialogue . 
He noted the overarching importance of transnational issues and indicated that the future of the [MISC US-Brazil  ] relationship was " global . 
" The Ambassador highlighted the extensive nature of our existing structure of dialogues , and asserted his and the Embassy 's commitment to working with all interested agencies to support their success . 
At the same time , the Ambassador recognized the need for a deeper and more strategic dialogue between the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He said that such a dialogue , especially in anticipation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's upcoming presidential elections could serve two useful purposes: first , to manage differences and protect our relationship during a time of intense political activity in [LOC Brazil  ] , and second , to act as a source of continuity and ensure the longevity and success of existing initiatives. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] then shared his views on global and regional issues . 
Regarding economic cooperation , he said it was important to broaden the umbrella of bilateral issues , moving past the [ORG Free Trade Agreements  ] ( FTAs ) model and instead focusing on concrete measures to promote increased economic cooperation and technology exchange . 
He said the [ORG GOB  ] was pleased that a good compromise was reached on climate change in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , praising the role of the President and Secretary . 
He lamented that the press had misrepresented the agreement , calling the compromiQ " the best possible outcome ; it kept the talks alive . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] offered that a visit by the Secretary would be a good opportunity to discuss [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] can contribute and be a positive voice on issues in the [LOC Middle East  ] and with [LOC Iran  ] , he said . 
[PER Amorim  ] had spoken with [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] during the trip to [LOC Brazil  ] in November and had raised human rights and the need to abide by international agreements . 
He had also urged the [MISC Iranians  ] to delay work on new processing installations in order to open a space for negotiations . 
The government in [LOC Iran  ] " is repressive but not totalitarian and they want to negotiate . 
" [PER Amorim  ] urged caution in dealing with [LOC Iran  ] , saying that trying to " hurry up " [LOC Iran  ] would produce a domestic backlash and stiffen its resolve. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Speaking of regional issues , [PER Amorim  ] downplayed the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] and the political crisis in [LOC Honduras  ] as bilateral problems , but said they still rankled in [LOC South America  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] use of military bases in [LOC Colombia  ] will cause the region some discomfort . 
He wished there had been greater consultations with the region on the [ORG DCA  ] and commented that countries in the region would watch very closely how the bases are used , and make further evaluations based on what they see . 
He commented that more intensive dialogue must be undertaken on the issue because it is a political , not technical , one . 
On [LOC Honduras  ] , [PER Amorim  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] was not yet ready to consider the recent elections legitimate ; however , [LOC Brazil  ] is done harping on this point and recognizes the elections as a fact it must accommodate . 
He said [LOC Brazil  ] 's priority is now securing an honorable exit for [LOC Zelaya.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --------------------------------------------- - OTHER FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS ALSO WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEEPEN RELATIONS --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .

He also met with Minister [PER Carlos Sergio Duarte  ] , Director for [ORG International Organizations  ] , who was filling in for the vacationing Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Vera Machado.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Ambassador and [PER Duarte  ] agreed that this is an important time for [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] because there are many new opportunities to discuss and move forward on the bilateral and multilateral realm . 
[PER Duarte  ] emphasized that this is a time for creative thinking especially in the international arena and that even though the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] do not always share the same position , the nature of the bilateral discourse is always mature and beneficial. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Duarte  ] went through [LOC Brazil  ] 's priorities in the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , first listing [LOC Haiti  ] , which he noted appeared to be an issue of great interest to the [LOC United States  ] as well . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has been in [LOC Haiti  ] for five or six years and is interested in gradually reconfiguring the mission to [LOC Haiti  ] 's changing needs . 
The mission in [LOC Haiti  ] has done well but now there is a need for investments to capitalize on the country 's human capital . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is working to mobilize business interests to invest in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Duarte  ] continued to explain that while [LOC Haiti  ] is the main regional concern , [LOC Brazil  ] is also looking to work on [LOC Guinea Bissau  ] . 
On larger issues to address in the [ORG Security Council  ] , [PER Duarte  ] noted [LOC Brazil  ] wants to discuss the nature of peacekeeping operations in conflict zones , such as [LOC Congo  ] . 
The Ambassador noted that the [LOC United States  ] had done an extensive review of our [LOC Haiti  ] policy , and that we were ready for a larger discussion with partners like [LOC Brazil  ] on [LOC Haiti.  ] ---------------- COMMENT ---------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) This wasn't the usual welcome given to a new ambassador . 
It is clear that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is eager to launch the next phase of [MISC US-Brazilian  ] relations . 
From a [MISC Brazilian  ] perspective , dialogue across not just regional , but global issues , will be important , and the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] looks forward to doing this both with the [LOC US  ] Ambassador and his team , and , hopefully , with Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] and the Secretary .
