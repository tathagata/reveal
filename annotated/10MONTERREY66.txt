( [ORG SBU  ] ) . 
Late in the evening of February 27 , hooded men conducted simultaneous grenade attacks against the facilities of five municipal police forces within the [LOC Monterrey  ] metro area . 
At police stations in the working class suburbs of [LOC San Nicolas  ] and [LOC Cadereyta  ] , the grenades exploded , injuring two and causing significant property damage ; in [LOC Guadalupe  ] , [LOC Escobedo  ] , and [LOC Apodaca  ] the devices did not detonate . 
Law enforcement sources , but not the press , report a sixth attack in the city of [LOC Santiago  ] , south of [LOC Monterrey  ] , and there are sketchy indications of a seventh attack in [LOC Sabinas-Hidalgo  ] , about an hour north of [LOC Monterrey  ] . 
The authorities have arrested two attackers and recover three unexploded grenades and one grenade spoon . 
[ORG ATF Monterrey  ] is in the process of obtaining access to the recovered physical evidence . 
Although there were civilian witnesses to the [LOC San Nicolas  ] explosion , no one is likely to come forward to present evidence or testify . 
Law enforcement sources report that the police present when the stations were attacked fled their posts . 
It is now clear that the ongoing war between the [LOC Gulf  ] and [LOC Zeta  ] drug trafficking organizations ( DTOs ) has reached [LOC Monterrey  ] . 
[LOC Nuevo  ] [MISC Leon Spin Control  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) . 
While [LOC Nuevo  ] Leon Secretary General [PER Javier Trevino Cantu  ] has characterized the coordinated attacks as a reaction by organized crime to the state government 's security efforts , this explanation is not persuasive as the state 's programs are still notional at best . 
Neither the recently-announced military/federal/state plan to install roadblocks ( 68 checkpoints in 19 cities ) along the [LOC Monterrey  ] to [LOC Reynosa  ] , [LOC Tamaulipas  ] corridor nor the state 's new plan to install checkpoints in 11 [LOC Monterrey  ] metro area municipalities to stem car theft have begun . 
Given the thorough penetration by the [ORG Zetas  ] of the police forces in those municipalities that were hit , a much more likely explanation is that the attacks were a signal from the [LOC Gulf  ] cartel to the police to cease/desist their support of the [ORG Zetas  ] and switch sides . 
Other plausible theories exist as well -- such as the attack was an attempt to " heat up " the [LOC Monterrey  ] plaza -- but none involve organized crime responding to " effective " state government enforcement efforts . 
Public Worried and Distrustful ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Locally , the [LOC Monterrey  ] public is worried as citizens fear that if the war between the cartels were to hit the city in earnest , [LOC Monterrey  ] could experience the rampant violence seen at the border . 
The continuing wave of car-jackings/car thefts -- the DTOs appear to be using the stolen cars to fulfull their transportation needs -- has many on edge . 
Citizens are curtailing trips to the border , and several bus companies are cancelling runs to outlying cities in the state . 
Indeed , if high-value targets fleeing [LOC Tamaulipas  ] take up residence in [LOC Monterrey  ] and nearby [LOC Saltillo  ] , [LOC Coahuila  ] , violence here between the cartels and between the cartels and the military ( both army and navy ) will increase . 
During the previous week reliable witness reported carloads of gunmen , with automatic weapons hanging out the window , retreating to [LOC Monterrey  ] along the highways linking the city to [LOC Reynosa  ] . 
Indeed , [ORG DEA  ] confirms a rolling confrontation between the military and retreating [ORG Zetas  ] on February 27 in the [LOC Nuevo  ] [MISC Leon  ] municipalities of [LOC Zuazua  ] and [LOC Pesqueria  ] , both to the north and east of [LOC Monterrey.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) . 
A recent poll done by the [MISC Monterrey-based  ] [ORG Grupo Reforma  ] -- publishers of the influential local daily " [MISC El Norte  ] " -- revealed that 58 percent of [LOC Tamaulipas  ] respondents had seen or heard gun battles or violent acts that the media/government had not made public . 
From here , it looks as if [LOC Nuevo  ] [MISC Leon  ] residents share this view . 
Indeed , post law enforcement has learned that six died during the [MISC Zuazua/Pesqueria  ] shoot-out , an incident which has not been reported in the local press . 
The rumor that Tamaulipas Governor [PER Eugenio Hernandez  ] had been kidnapped flew around among [LOC Monterrey  ] elites at light speed on February 26 . 
The comparative silence of [LOC Nuevo  ] Leon Governor [PER Rodrigo Medina  ] on security issues in general has only heightened suspicions . 
February 26 [ORG EAC Meeting  ] and February 28 Follow-up --------------------------------------------- ------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Prior to the grenade attacks , Consulate General [LOC Monterrey  ] 's [ORG Emergency Action Committee  ] ( [ORG EAC  ] ) met on February 26 , 2010 to discuss the current wave of narco-related violence and its potential impact on Consulate security and operations . 
The [ORG EAC  ] was chaired by Consul General with the presence of [ORG MGT  ] , [ORG RSO  ] , [ORG CONS  ] , [ORG POL  ] , [ORG CLO  ] , [ORG FBI  ] , [ORG ATF  ] , [ORG DEA  ] , [ORG ICE  ] , [ORG PD  ] and [ORG OPAD  ] . 
Among items discussed was the continued increase in car-jackings and stolen cars . 
During the previous evening , a local car lot was hit by a [ORG DTO  ] and as many as 10 SUVs were taken . 
The group also kidnapped the owner and two other family members . 
It was reported that local police seen in the area did not respond to distress calls from the family. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] relayed [ORG Unclass  ] reporting that the [ORG Los Zetas  ] leader , [PER Miguel Heriberto  ] Lazcano-Lazcano is believed to be hiding in [LOC Monterrey  ] and was planning for counter-offensive strikes against the [ORG Gulf Cartel  ] in [LOC Tamaulipas  ] . 
This information dovetailed with reporting from other sources and the members of post 's [ORG Law Enforcement Working Group  ] elaborated that [LOC Saltillo  ] , [LOC Coahuila  ] would likely be considered a safehaven by the [ORG Zetas.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CG  ] and [ORG RSO  ] discussed obtaining further protective equipment for the [ORG Local Guard Force  ] . 
[ORG RSO  ] will submit a request for an emergency shipment of ballistic helmets and rifle grade body armor from [LOC DS/PSP/DEAV.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At a February 28 follow-up session of the [ORG Law Enforcement Working Group  ] , committee members discussed the probabilities of further [ORG Gulf Cartel  ] retributions against [LOC Zeta  ] controlled police departments in the [LOC Monterrey  ] area . 
Various [ORG EAC  ] members believe that the next targets of attack by the [LOC Gulf  ] cartel might be the [LOC Monterrey  ] and [PER Santa Catarina  ] police or [LOC Nuevo  ] Leon state police facilities . 
On February [ORG RSO  ] office distributed a security notice to Consulate employees reminding them of the need to remain vigiliant .
