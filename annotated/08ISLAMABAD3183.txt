<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L ISLAMABAD 003183 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 08/04/2018 TAGS PREL , PTER , PGOV , PREF , PK SUBJECT: TASKINGS FOR [ORG IDP/REFUGEE INFORMATION Classified  ] By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is a joint cable from [ORG Embassy Islamabad  ] and [ORG Embassy Kabul.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In recent weeks , [ORG Embassy Islamabad  ] and the [LOC Regional Refcord  ] in [ORG Embassy Kabul  ] have received requests , both orally and through e-mails , from the [ORG DAO  ] and [ORG USSOCOM  ] ( and its XXXXXXXXXXXX contractor ) requesting information on camps along the [MISC Pakistan-Afghanistan  ] border which are housing [MISC Afghan  ] refugees and/or Internally Displaced [MISC Persons  ] ( IDPs ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The requests apparently are in response to a ‘Coliseum tasker’ from [ORG SOCOM  ] regarding [ORG IDP/Refugee  ] camps and NGO activity . 
They have requested information on camp names and locations , camp status , number of IDS/refugees and ethnic breakdown , and [MISC NGO/humanitarian  ] relief organizations working in the camps . 
[ORG DAO  ] apparently has been instructed to reach out to [ORG UNHCR  ] ( which is not an agency of the [ORG USG  ] but of the [ORG United Nations  ] ) , [ORG USAID  ] , and State . 
The purpose of the request for information remains unclear ; some e-mails have suggested that agencies intend to use the data for targeting purposes ; others indicate it would be used for “NO STRIKE” purposes. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We are concerned about providing information gained from humanitarian organizations to military personnel , especially for reasons that remain unclear . 
Particularly worrisome , this does not seem to us a very efficient way to gather accurate information. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Posts  ] would appreciate clarification of the origin and purpose of this tasker . 
Regardless , [ORG SOCOM  ] , [ORG DIA  ] or anyone else desiring such information should send a front channel cable to the appropriate Embassy or to DNI’s representative , the [ORG COS  ] in [LOC Embassies Islamabad  ] and/or [LOC Kabul  ] .
