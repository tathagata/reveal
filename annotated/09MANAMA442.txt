END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) King [PER Hamad  ] warmly welcomed Ambassadors [PER Vershbow  ] and [PER Ereli  ] and began the meeting by thanking the [LOC United States  ] for the staunch support we provide [LOC Bahrain  ] . 
He reminded the Ambassadors that [LOC Bahrain  ] is a long-time [LOC U.S.  ] ally , remains firm in its support of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts in the [LOC Gulf  ] , and greatly values our bilateral relationship that is of significant importance to [LOC Bahrain  ] 's interests . 
He said [LOC Bahrain  ] will do anything to work together with the [LOC U.S.  ] He was particularly praiseworthy of the bilateral defense relationship , commenting that the superb advice [LOC Bahrain  ] 's Defense Forces ( [ORG BDF  ] ) receive from the [LOC U.S.  ] has resulted in the [ORG BDF  ] being one of the cleanest organizations in [LOC Bahrain  ] 's government . 
The [PER King  ] also noted that the equipment received through the [ORG Foreign Military Financing  ] ( [ORG FMF  ] ) process was of high quality and operationally effective , and he was also proud of the strong relations established with [LOC U.S.  ] 5th [MISC Fleet.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Vershbow  ] thanked His Majesty for hosting the [ORG Military Consultative Committee  ] that was currently meeting in [LOC Manama  ] and for his country 's support to [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
He noted that the [MISC U.S.-Bahraini  ] relationship was very strong and mutually beneficial and affirmed to the King that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Bahrain  ] shared a similar vision in the region despite its many challenges. -------------------- [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER King Hamad  ] said the upcoming deployment of [LOC Bahrain  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [LOC MoI  ] ) security unit to provide fixed site security in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would provide great experience to [LOC MoI  ] personnel and allows [LOC Bahrain  ] to show its flag and demonstrate support for the [ORG Coalition .  ] 
He stated that [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] provided a golden opportunity for the [MISC Afghan  ] people to build their country 's security forces as well as their education , medical , science and trade programs and ministries . 
The [PER King  ] added that [LOC U.S.  ] efforts should be touted more in the media . 
He quoted President [PER Eisenhower  ] , saying the " [LOC U.S.  ] is soldiering for peace and not waging war " and he understood that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not seeking to rule over [LOC Afghanistan  ] or [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He is convinced that the [LOC U.S.  ] is in both places to help the [MISC Afghan  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] people and he was appreciative of our armed forces personnel performing their duties in places so far from home . 
[PER King Hamad  ] noted some instability in [LOC Iraq  ] , but thought overall , [LOC Iraq  ] was on a positive slope . 
ASD Vershbow thanked the [PER King  ] for his comments and said it was important that the world hears his , as well as similar explanations , of [LOC U.S.  ] policies in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Commenting on [LOC Bahrain  ] 's participation in coalition maritime operations and efforts against terrorism and piracy , [PER King Hamad  ] said he had recently told his Parliament that , " Ships are sailing to defend the region and why don't we join them ? 
If we don't join , we will miss an opportunity . 
" His remarks acknowledged [LOC Bahrain  ] 's past and current participation in Combined [LOC Task Force  ] ( [ORG CTF  ] ) 152 and its anticipated participation in [ORG CTF  ] 151. --------------------------------- Annoyed and Concerned about [LOC Qatar  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [PER King  ] voiced concern about what is happening in the region and stated that he would like to see a stronger [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] ( [ORG GCC  ] ) as a deterrent against future threats and to provide more security in the region . 
[PER King Hamad  ] flatly stated that [LOC Bahrain  ] is not happy with [LOC Qatar  ] . 
He took particular exception to the recent visit to [LOC Iran  ] by [LOC Qatar  ] 's Chief of Staff , [PER MG Hamad  ] al [PER Attiyah  ] . 
He noted that during the visit , the two sides released a statement agreeing to joint training exercises , intelligence exchange and [LOC MANAMA  ] 00000442 002 OF 002 reciprocal visits of military staff and units . 
" This is going too far , " [PER King Hamad  ] fumed . 
It 's one thing to have trade and commercial exchanges , he noted , but to welcome [MISC Iranian  ] military units on the territory of a [ORG GCC  ] member state is " a strategic matter . 
" He went on to say that [LOC Iran  ] is the number-one threat in the region ; any country should be cautious about exchanging military information with [LOC Iran  ] , and no [ORG GCC  ] country should allow an [MISC Iranian  ] military unit or personnel to land on its shores . 
The [PER King  ] stated that he would like to show [LOC Qatar  ] some type of unhappiness for its actions with [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [PER King  ] said it is rumored that [ORG MG  ] al-Attiyah may retire as the [MISC Qatari  ] [ORG CHOD  ] and perhaps this influenced his decision to visit [LOC Iran  ] . 
( NOTE: In a separate meeting with ASD Vershbow and State P/M Assistant Secretary [PER Shapiro  ] , during their July 20-21 visit to [LOC Doha  ] , [ORG MG  ] al-Attiyah did state that his visit to [LOC Iran  ] was long planned but perhaps ill-timed to coincide with recent post-election activities in [LOC Tehran  ] ; since it was previously planned , he had not wanted to cancel his visit . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER King Hamad  ] added that [LOC Qatar  ] 's behavior " is an annoyance , but it was too early to be angry at them . 
" [PER King Hamad  ] went on saying he " would like our brother in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to send a note telling [LOC Qatar  ] not to play like this . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) ASD Vershbow affirmed [LOC U.S.  ] displeasure with [MISC Iranian  ] behavior , particularly its nuclear program , and stated the [LOC U.S.  ] would not tolerate [MISC Iranian  ] pursuit of nuclear weapons . 
He told the [PER King  ] we were disappointed with the timing of the [MISC Qatari  ] [ORG CHOD  ] 's visit , but hoped the [MISC Qataris  ] could persuade [LOC Iran  ] to engage with the [LOC U.S.  ] to end its nuclear program , rather than seeking a confrontation with the international community. ------------------------- Plug for the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) ASD Vershbow said he appreciated the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] 's recent op-ed published on the [LOC Middle East  ] which he understood bore the [PER King  ] 's stamp . 
He said the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] 's points about [MISC Arab  ] countries seizing the opportunity at hand and setting aside past differences to move forward on the peace process was right on mark . 
[PER King Hamad  ] responded that [LOC Bahrain  ] supported [MISC U.S.-led  ] efforts to make peace and agreed that the [MISC Arab  ] world needed to contribute positively to this effort . 
Returning to [LOC Qatar  ] , [PER King Hamad  ] noted that [PER Abdul Bari  ] al [PER Atwan  ] , the editor-in-chief of the pan-Arab daily " [MISC Al Quds al Arabi  ] , " had written a widely-read article critical of the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] 's op-ed . 
[LOC Qatar  ] is a major financial backer of [MISC al Quds al Arabi  ] , the [PER King  ] remarked , and he clearly saw the hand of [LOC Doha  ] behind [PER Abdul Bari  ] 's attack . 
Continuing on this theme , [PER King Hamad  ] said there were two major issues that made him angry with regard to [LOC Qatar  ] . 
The first was the [LOC Iran  ] issue ; the second was gas . 
For years , [LOC Bahrain  ] has been asking to buy [MISC Qatari  ] gas , but their response has always been that [LOC Qatar  ] exports were maxed out and it was not prepared to enter into new supply contracts . 
These rejections notwithstanding , the [PER King  ] asserted that he had recently learned that [LOC Qatar  ] has inked a new supply deal with [LOC Mexico  ] and will increase gas supplies to [LOC England  ] . 
He was at a loss to understand [MISC Qatari  ] behavior. --------- On [LOC Israel  ] --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Commenting on [MISC Bahraini  ] initiatives with [LOC Israel  ] , [PER King Hamad  ] said [LOC Bahrain  ] continues to do its best to make [LOC Bahrain  ] 's position clear to [LOC Israel  ] and the world , and expressed thanks for President [PER Obama  ] 's recent detailed letter . 
He was taking his time in drafting a similarly detailed response , and would share his response with Ambassador [ORG Ereli  ] when it was ready . 
[PER King Hamad  ] said he looks forward to cooperating more with the [LOC U.S.  ] on key regional issues and specifically referenced the soon to be executed moves of P-3 aircraft to [LOC Isa Air Base  ] and DoD 's location of its forward [LOC Near East South Asia  ] ( [ORG NESA  ] ) Center to [LOC Manama  ] . 
ASD Vershbow and AMB [ORG Ereli  ] thanked the [PER King  ] for his strong support for [LOC U.S.  ] policies and encouraged [LOC Bahrain  ] to continue its constructive behavior and leadership in the [LOC Gulf.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) ASD Vershbow has cleared this message .
