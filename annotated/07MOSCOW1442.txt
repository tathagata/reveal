Burns  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The rise of corporate statism in [LOC Russia  ] has been significant . 
Since 2004 , the government has taken over the world 's largest titanium business , consolidated its position in [ORG Gazprom  ] , merged 10 aviation businesses into a state-owned conglomerate , and taken controlling positions in other firms . 
No less fascinating has been the mix of greed , politics , and business behind the expansion of the state into the economy . 
Looking ahead , our contacts are strongly divided . 
Some see troubling signs of continued state ambition . 
Others believe the process is essentially plateauing , and will stabilize at lower levels of state ownership in the economy after two-three years . 
In our view , the current trendline may quickly approach some rather natural limits , and the [LOC Kremlin  ] will eventually have to bow to the market . 
In the meantime , we should reinforce market-driven approaches and the cadre of [MISC Russian  ] policy-makers who doggedly keep these ideas in play . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This cable is based on dozens of conversations with contacts in industry and banking over the past six weeks , supplemented by [MISC Embassy-based  ] research . 
The Breadth of State Ownership ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The march of the state into parts of the [MISC Russian  ] economy over the past few years has been significant , with control of swaths of the natural resource , defense , and select other sectors consolidated in state hands . 
Annual revenues of [LOC Russia  ] 's ten largest state-owned or controlled companies reached an estimated 20 percent of GDP in 2006 . 
State-owned or controlled companies account for one-third of the [MISC Russian  ] stock market 's capitalization , and in just the last year , the value of these equity holdings has almost doubled to an estimated USD 369 billion . 
And the process continues: [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] is rumored to be in line to buy [LOC Russia  ] 's fifth largest steel producer , [ORG Mechel  ] ; further consolidation in the energy sector favoring [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG Rosneft  ] is likely ; a new shipbuilding national champion is in the works ; and diamond giant [ORG Alrosa  ] has its eye on [ORG Norilsk Nickel  ] , a USD 30 billion company with more than the half the world 's palladium and one-fifth of global nickel output . 
Looking Behind This Latest [MISC Great Grab  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The grab for [LOC Russia  ] 's resources is an old story , but contacts agree that traditional motives ( greed , power ) have been supplemented in this round with a nationalistic brand of commercial considerations . 
Greed in [LOC Russia  ] shocks no one , but the rising value of [LOC Russia  ] , Inc . 
( on the back of high energy prices ) has made the current grab particularly profitable for some . 
Power considerations -- both geopolitical ( as in the case of [ORG Gazprom  ] ) and in the context of [LOC Russia  ] 's domestic succession process -- are evident as well . 
New to this paradigm is the surprisingly strong role business considerations seem to be playing -- as the [MISC Russian  ] Government tries to salvage a select few decrepit remains of [MISC Soviet  ] industrial prowess before it is too late . 
Our contacts have a lot to say about all three motives ; we summarize what we 've heard here. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Greed: The [LOC Kremlin  ] leadership in the economy is in no small part about money , and the [ORG Sibneft  ] takeover by [ORG Gazprom  ] is perhaps the most blatant example of this ( only about a quarter of the $12b selling price for the firm is said to have actually gone to owner [PER Abramovich  ] ) . 
In general , the insider offtake from M&A deal flows is said to be so large now that [MISC Swiss  ] banks have told [LOC Kremlin  ] cutouts ( like gas-trader [PER Timchenko  ] ) that they cannot accept further deposits without knowing the source of the money . 
The most lucrative transfers to the state ( usually involving natural resources ) may be wrapped in patriotic rhetoric , but include a healthy dose of financial opportunism . 
Yet , as ugly as it looks , our contacts remind , it is not so different than what happened in [LOC Indonesia  ] and [LOC South Korea  ] - and [LOC Mexico  ] too . 
As one contact points out , " the bureaucrats got rich there too . 
" [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001442 002 OF 004 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Power:  ] Creating national champions and projecting a strong image for [LOC Russia  ] abroad has been a leading factor in many state-connected takeovers and consolidations , including the removal of the [ORG Gazprom  ] ring fence , the [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] makeover , the [MISC RUSAL-SUAL  ] deal , and the anticipated takeover of [ORG Norilsk Nickel  ] by [ORG Alrosa  ] . 
Some of what we are seeing is also is part of the ongoing succession process , putting individuals into deal flows and thus providing campaign finance and enhancing their public profile . 
The decision to put military hardware exports under [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] is seen in some quarters as buttressing dark horse presidential hopeful and [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] Chairman [PER Sergey Chemezov  ] . 
Recent portfolio changes are seen by some as giving First Deputy Prime Minister [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] a cash-laden institutional base like that enjoyed by his chief rival for the presidency , First Deputy Head of the [ORG Presidential Administration  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] Chairman of the [ORG Board of Directors  ] [PER Dmitriy Medvedev.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Nationalistic-Driven Commercial Considerations: Many believe that [PER Putin  ] and those around him are also driven by a sincere desire to right the excesses of the 1990s , or oligarchic plundering of once-proud , though ruinously inefficient , [MISC Soviet  ] companies . 
The examples here are truly varied . 
In the case of [ORG Avtovaz  ] , [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] 's move to take over the firm last year may be the only thing saving the car-giant from complete collapse in the face of global competition . 
The emerging [ORG Norilsk Nickel  ] story is said to be as much about saving [ORG Alrosa  ] ( which experts say will run out of diamonds in ten years' time ) as it is about keeping [ORG Norilsk  ] 's palladium and nickel output in [MISC Russian  ] hands . 
And , as driven by national security concerns as the formation of the [ORG United Aircraft Company  ] might be , also at play is a long-overdue consolidation of an industry largely on the verge of collapse . 
These examples are more about saving jobs and communities and creating viable competitive companies than personal enrichment . 
Although making money is not precluded here , both [ORG Avtovaz  ] and [ORG UAC  ] , not to mention plans to create a new shipbuilding national champion , sound more like cash sinks than cash cows . 
What Next ? ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Looking ahead , our contacts are divided about what to expect next . 
" Statist " believers argue that there are troubling signs that the trend is far from contained: state-owned companies are straying farther from their core business , eyeing the telecom and IT sectors , and expanding beyond traditional financial services . 
They point to [ORG Gazprom  ] 's movement into electricity ; Svyazinvest 's significant stake in privately-held telecom provider Comstar ; and [ORG VneshTorgBank  ] 's overtures to brokerage house [ORG Troika Dialog  ] ( ultimately rebuffed ) . 
While no one is predicting another [MISC Yukos-style  ] approach , there is a sense that the authorities can and will come up with new pretexts for control. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In contrast , others argue the state 's reach is plateauing , and the current mix of state-private ownership could start to reverse itself before long . 
They say national champions in the sectors that make sense have been created , and industries such as telecom and IT do not lend themselves to over-centralization . 
In gas and electricity , given supply shortfalls , the [ORG GOR  ] has to promote private investment to meet demand and introduce efficiencies . 
A shrinking current account balance ( on the back of lower oil prices ) and the drive to diversify the economy only heighten the need for private capital and better corporate governance ( which implies a move away from state ownership and control ) . 
The [LOC Kremlin  ] will also find it increasingly difficult to control emerging interest groups , from the consumer sector to regional governments . 
Integration into the [ORG WTO  ] and other western economic institutions will require greater transparency , better and more equal market access , and lower protectionist barriers - which will temper the state 's ambition. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Some take this latter argument one dark step further . 
They say that current [ORG GOR  ] leadership , its successors and supporters , will need to find outlets for their accumulated wealth , much of which is said to be held in liquid assets abroad . 
The theory goes that these funds will start making their way back to [LOC Russia  ] over the next two-three years , and that the target of the return flows will most likely be the [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001442 003 OF 004 same assets that have been carefully squirreled away in state hands over the past few years -- thus spurring share offerings by [ORG Rosneft  ] , spin offs at [ORG Gazprom  ] , etc . 
These assets are profitable , and equity ownership in [LOC Russia  ] carries less risk for this particular group of investors than the prying eyes of regulatory authorities abroad . 
Likewise , coming into [LOC Russia  ] from an [MISC European  ] investment platform , as one contact cynically noted , may make it less likely that zealous law-enforcement officials abroad would pursue criminal or civil cases for fear a [LOC U.S.  ] or [MISC European  ] firm could get tangled up in the investigation . 
Where We Come Out ----------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Looking at the three motives most obviously at play , two of them -- greed and nationalistic commercial considerations -- suggest equally valid reasons why we might see the state pulling back from its commanding heights over the next few years . 
Greed will tend to push those who have accumulated shares in state companies towards share cash-outs , just as it will push those who have accumulated " private " cash abroad to buy back into [LOC Russia  ] 's safest investments . 
[ORG Rosneft  ] is a perfect example . 
We are watching to see who in the government argues the loudest for [ORG Rosneft  ] 's further privatization -- they more than likely stand to benefit from either the sell or the buy opportunity . 
For industries that are less obvious moneymakers , exemplified by [ORG Avtovaz  ] and [ORG UAC  ] , the state is even more likely to divest ( wholly , in the case of [ORG Avtovaz  ] ) as the firms become commercially viable and need investment capital and strategic partners , and as they become less social land mines and resemble more the typical day-to-day slog of the business world. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) But pulling back does not mean exiting the field . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] does not expect the state ever to relinquish its control of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Nor will the [ORG GOR  ] allow its stake in [ORG Gazprom  ] to drop again below 50% , although many predict it will shed non-core assets in the coming years . 
Nor will the diamond trade or trade in metals likely see a repeat of the halcyon days of private ownership in the wake of loans-for-shares . 
[ORG UAC  ] will likely never be more than 30% privately-owned. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) But even if every firm in the natural resources sector ends up in state hands , as significant as that would be , it would account for around 12% of the [MISC Russian  ] economy . 
Add in state monopolies in the transport and communications sector , defense industries , and space , and state control over the economy rings in around 25% of GDP . 
As disturbing as this figure might seem , it is not wildly out of line with other market economies rich in natural resources . 
As recently as two years ago , the [MISC Norwegian  ] state owned approximately 32% of the companies listed on the [ORG Oslo Stock Exchange  ] , and still holds shares in 10-15 percent of [MISC Norwegian  ] industry , including controlling shares in oil , telecoms , and the national airline . 
In [LOC Mexico  ] , the state fully controls the oil , gas , and nuclear power industries and has reserved for the state in whole or part the telecommunications , air travel , and postal sectors. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) And these back of the envelope estimates ignore important counter trends to the movement toward greater state control . 
Whole swaths of the economy , our interlocutors again and again confirm , lie fully outside the ambitions of the state -- and are thriving . 
One seasoned businessman ( who has had his hat handed to him on more than one occasion over the past 15 years ) is back in [LOC Russia  ] and growing fast , and he chalks up his current success to the booming service and retail sector , a place where he says he never comes in contact with the designs of the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
There are also instances , like with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , where , despite the new ownership structure , the state has left the firm to run the business without [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] grabbing off profits or instructing where production should go . 
Lastly , it would be irresponsible to ignore the progress being made toward the break-up and privatization of both the electricity and rail sectors . 
When all is said and done , these massive reforms will move some 2-3 percent of GDP from state to private hands. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) There is another reason why more of this economy will likely move into the private sector . 
Economic modernizers , as they have come to call themselves here , may still [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001442 004 OF 004 ultimately get the upper hand . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and others recognize that only through greater private sector participation in the economy will [LOC Russia  ] be able to attract the capital needed to sustain growth over the long run . 
This is also where working to bring [LOC Russia  ] into international institutions will help drive policy here in the direction we favor . 
Locking the [MISC Russian  ] Government into such institutions and exposing [MISC Russian  ] companies to the discipline of the global market will reinforce the trends we seek to encourage . 
Doing so this year , before the election process starts to create new winners and losers , is a bet on the modernizers worth taking.</pre></code>
