End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Special Representative for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] , accompanied by Ambassador , met February 16 with [MISC Indian  ] Foreign Secretary [PER Shivshankar Menon  ] . 
Also in attendance from the [LOC U.S.  ] side were [PER Paul Jones  ] , Deputy for [PER Holbrooke  ] ; [PER Ashley Bommer  ] , Representative [MISC Holbrooke’s  ] assistant ; and an Embassy notetaker ; the [MISC Indian  ] side also included Joint Secretary ( [ORG Americas  ] ) [PER Gaitri Kumar  ] and Joint Secretary ( [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] ) [ORG TCA  ] Raghvan . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] explained his responsibilities as Special Representative and emphasized the importance of [MISC Indian  ] views in the formulation of the new administration , s [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] policy . 
He also provided [PER Menon  ] with a brief readout of his trip to [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] cited the numerous times he had worked both publicly and privately with [PER Holbrooke  ] in the past , and said he was very happy to see [PER Holbrooke  ] in his new incarnation . 
The [MISC Indian  ] government , too , was pleased with [MISC Holbrooke’s  ] appointment , he stated , adding “We have a huge stake in your success in this role.” He agreed with [MISC Holbrooke’s  ] assessment that in regard to the problems in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] “you can’t solve one without the other.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Indian  ] government was aware of the suspicions the media had created about Special Representative [MISC Holbrooke’s  ] mandate ( i.e. , that it included [LOC Kashmir  ] ) , [PER Menon  ] said . 
While the media would always speculate , [PER Menon  ] promised that the [ORG GOI  ] would publicly support [MISC Holbrooke’s  ] efforts , adding that it would repeat the message “India has a huge stake in your success” in its public comments. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Menon  ] observed that the mood there had deteriorated over the past year , saying it had gone from euphoria after the return of a civilian government to worries over security and the economy . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has influence , however , “where it matters most , ” [PER Menon  ] said , referring to the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army , arguing that most of the problems in [LOC Pakistan  ] can be traced to the capacity and intentions of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] military . 
Not only must [MISC Pakistan’s  ] army shift its attention from east to west , [PER Menon  ] asserted , but it must also cut its links to jihadi organizations , who have gone global over the past five years . 
Supporting [MISC Pakistan’s  ] army is not the answer , he said , suggesting that changing its operating assumptions would be more effective . 
[PER Menon  ] noted that the [MISC Indians  ] had felt last week’s meeting at the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] between [ORG National Security Advisor MK Narayanan  ] and General [PER Petraeus  ] had been especially productive. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] pointed out that in the wake of the [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorist attacks , [LOC India  ] had consciously not attempted to take any measures to destabilize [MISC Pakistan’s  ] civilian government , and had made every effort to continue trade and travel relations . 
However , [MISC Pakistan’s  ] Army continued to make things difficult for [LOC India  ] , through ceasefire violations , infiltrations and continued support for terrorist groups . 
NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000288 002 OF 002 [PER Menon  ] noted that [LOC India  ] , in the wake of the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks , had consciously not built up troops on the border with [LOC Pakistan  ] , as it had following the 2001 attack on its Parliament. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Holbrooke  ] noted that the focus now was on the elections . 
He lauded [LOC India  ] for the effective contribution it had made to [LOC Afghanistan  ] reconstruction , which [PER Menon  ] said is now up to $1.5 billion . 
[PER Menon  ] acknowledged [MISC Pakistani  ] suspicions about [LOC India  ] , s intentions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and explained that [LOC India  ] has made numerous efforts over the past few years to try to allay [MISC Pakistan’s  ] concerns , only to be rebuffed . 
[PER Menon  ] said that he , as High Commissioner , had offered to President [PER Musharraf  ] to sit down and explain exactly what [LOC India  ] was doing in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , without even asking for a reciprocal explanation from [LOC Pakistan  ] , but that [LOC Pakistan  ] officials -- not just [PER Musharraf  ] -- “have avoided it in every way.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC India  ] has no interest in any specific candidate in [MISC Afghan  ] elections , [PER Menon  ] stated , but believes the upcoming election process should not add to instability . 
Equally important is that the election process is credible , therefore making [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] democracy credible . 
[PER Menon  ] noted that [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Lower House  ] Speaker [PER Mohammad Yunis Qanuni  ] was currently in [LOC Delhi  ] , and said [LOC India  ] supported the [ORG Election Commission  ] , s proposal for August 20 polling . 
[PER Menon  ] stated that the [ORG GOI  ] was also planning to tell [PER Qanuni  ] that controversy over the exact date of the election should not be allowed “to bring the house down , ” adding that to do so would only be in the Taliban’s interest . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] urged [PER Menon  ] to tell [PER Qanuni  ] to accept the August 20 election date . 
( [PER Note: Menon  ] offered to brief Post on the [MISC Qunani  ] meeting , and Post will report septel on any readout provided . 
End Note .

( C ) Responding to [PER Holbrooke  ] , s brief of the [LOC Afghanistan  ] policy review currently underway in the [ORG USG  ] , [PER Menon  ] said he would consult with his government on what would be the best way for [LOC India  ] to provide input . 
He suggested that , after consultations , he would like to travel to [LOC Washington  ] for high level talks with the new team . 
[PER Menon  ] assured [PER Holbrooke  ] , that on the issue of [MISC Indian  ] cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , we could be assured that [LOC India  ] wished to work closely with us. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] was considering including [LOC Iran  ] in a [ORG Core Group  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] referred to his interview with [MISC Tolo  ] TV where he emphasized the need for all of [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] neighbors to be part of the solution , but said no policy decisions had been made . 
[PER Menon  ] said he believed a contact group did not have to be formally set up yet , but rather if we “let it cook , ” it would form itself . 
[PER Menon  ] noted the interest [LOC China  ] has had in such a group for the past two years , and added that [LOC Iran  ] has been signaling to [LOC India  ] for the last four months that it was interested. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] offered an initial [ORG GOI  ] assessment of the [MISC Pakistani  ] response to [MISC India’s  ] dossier on the [LOC Mumbai  ] terror attacks . 
Saying that it was “remarkable that we got this far , ” [PER Menon  ] thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for its role in pressing [LOC Pakistan  ] to act . 
Still , [PER Menon  ] maintained , [LOC Pakistan  ] has further to go to bring justice to the perpetrators of the attack , and it is not clear whether [LOC Pakistan  ] will continue on this positive track or , citing the [PER Daniel Pearl  ] case , recede when public pressure wanes . 
[PER Menon  ] also speculated that many of the “30 questions” submitted by [LOC Pakistan  ] were added after the investigation by politicians in response to domestic pressures. “We haven’t reached the point of no return yet” for [MISC Pakistan’s  ] government to positively conclude the investigation , [PER Menon  ] stated . 
[PER Menon  ] also offered that he did not believe the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks themselves would play a major role in [MISC India’s  ] upcoming elections , because efforts to capitalize politically on such a heinous event would likely backfire on any political party. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] has cleared this message .
