( C ) Summary: [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) recently convoked the major international oil companies ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) in [LOC Libya  ] and presented a new law establishing a fund for charitable contributions . 
While the stated purpose of the law is to gather contributions to support charitable , social and humanitarian aid programs , [ORG NOC  ] officials - including Chairman [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] - openly conceded that the new law was the government 's latest attempt to prompt [ORG IOCs  ] to make " voluntary " contributions to the fund established under the [ORG U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Compensation Agreement  ] , which is to compensate victims of terrorism and their families . 
Citing concerns about potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt [ORG Practices Act  ] ( [ORG FCPA  ] ) , [ORG IOC  ] heads here told the Ambassador and emboffs they do not plan to make any contributions to the new fund . 
[ORG IOCs  ] in [LOC Libya  ] are already obligated under the terms of their contracts to spend a certain amount on social programs and have initiated programs to fight diabetes ( a growing problem in [LOC Libya  ] ) , and promote road safety . 
End summary . 
[ORG LIBYAN NATIONAL OIL COMPANY CALLS INTERNATIONAL OIL  ] COMPANIES TO CARPET <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On May 4 , the [ORG National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) convoked the [MISC Libyan  ] deputy managers of [ORG IOCs  ] to a presention on a new law establishing a charitable contribution fund ( Decision number 148-2009 ) . 
( [LOC Note:  ] In [LOC Libya  ] , the deputies of [ORG IOCs  ] must be [MISC Libyan  ] nationals . 
End note ) . 
The stated purpose of the law is to gather donations to support charitable , social and humanitarian aid programs . 
The fund would manage and monitor charity contributions coming from all foreign companies and would encourage them to contribute grants , donations , and support to the fund . 
The fund is to be managed by a [ORG Management Committee  ] comprised of a General Manager and four members nominated by the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( cabinet-equivalent ) . 
In addition to " voluntary " contributions , 40 per cent of environmental fines paid by foreign companies , including oil companies , would go into the fund . 
NEW " CHARITY FUND " A THINLY-VEILED VERSION OF [ORG OLD CLAIMS COMPENSATION FUND  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG NOC  ] officials chairing the meeting admitted the law was the government 's latest attempt to spur the [ORG IOCs  ] to make " voluntary " contributions to the fund created under the [ORG U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Compensation Agreement  ] ( see refs A and B ) . 
The deputy managers were told their companies would get 'better treatment' if they made early contributions to the charity fund . 
In discussing potential consequences if they declined to make such contributions , it was suggested that the companies could be fined for infringing [LOC Libya  ] 's environmental laws , or their employees could be stopped by police for ( alleged ) traffic infractions . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The latter is a common practice here . 
Police frequently stop vehicles with foreign commerical license plates and fine their drivers on the spot . 
End note . 
) Since the meeting , the major [ORG IOCs  ] have remained resolute and have not contributed to either the old compensation fund or the new charity fund . 
There are persistent rumors , however , that [ORG Gazprom  ] and a few small oil services companies have contributed to the compensation fund and possibly to the new charity fund as well . 
( [ORG Note: Gazprom  ] Chairman [PER Alexei Miller  ] announced publicly earlier this week that [ORG Gazprom  ] expected to conclude an agreement with the [ORG NOC  ] in the near future to develop a large gas field . 
End note . 
) SHUKHRI GHANEM TO MARATHON: BE A " GOOD NEIGHBOR " AND GIVE TO THE NEW FUND <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a recent meeting , xxxxxxxxxxxx admitted xxxxxxxxxxxx that the [ORG GOL  ] had simply renamed the old compensation fund and presented it as a charity fund . 
Noting that neither the [MISC Libyan  ] government nor the [ORG USG  ] had wanted to contribute to the fund , he said it had become apparent that [ORG IOCs  ] were not inclined to contribute to it , either . 
He blamed the refusal of [MISC American  ] companies to pay for the reluctance of other [ORG IOCs  ] to contribute. xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that the new charity fund would give companies an opportunity to show they are " good neighbors " by supporting charitable , social and humanitarian aid programs . 
The issue of [ORG IOCs  ] contributing to the fund had been elevated to the highest levels and went beyond just the [ORG NOC  ] , he said , in an implicit reference to Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
Separately , senior xxxxxxxxxxxx executives and a [MISC Libyan  ] contact with excellent ties to xxxxxxxxxxxx recently told [LOC Emboffs  ] that xxxxxxxxxxxx and the [ORG NOC  ] were TRIPOLI 00000413 002.2 OF 003 under pressure from [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and Prime Minister al-Baghdad al-Mahmoudi . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The latter was tasked immediately after finalization of the [ORG U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Compensation Agreement  ] with " accreting " contributions to the fund for victims of terrorism . 
End note . 
) xxxxxxxxxxxx <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx told the Ambassador his company did not see any way it could participate in the new fund since its lawyers assessed that contributions could violate the Foreign Corrupt [ORG Practises Act  ] ( [ORG FCPA  ] ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx was worried that if they contributed to the fund this time , it would establish a dangerous precedent for further solicitations in [LOC Libya  ] and elsewhere . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] read with interest ref C , which suggests the [MISC Qataris  ] and [MISC Libyans  ] may be using the same play book . 
End note . 
) The [ORG Oasis Group  ] ( also known by its [MISC Arabic  ] name as the [ORG Waha Group  ] ) , which includes [LOC Marathon  ] , [ORG Amerada Hess  ] , and [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] , already paid [LOC Libya  ] USD 1.8 billion in signing bonuses to re-enter [LOC Libya  ] . 
The request for additional payment to the charity fund is not something xxxxxxxxxxxx is in a position to do . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , the company is strongly committed to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility obligations , but is unwilling to simply hand out cash to a less-than-transparent charity fund . 
Some provisions in the new law call for using the fines paid by companies for breaching environmental codes to fund sustainable development programs . 
Contacts at xxxxxxxxxxxx said this would not affect xxxxxxxxxxxx or its xxxxxxxxxxxx since they are only investors ( vice operating companies ) . 
In addition , xxxxxxxxxxxx 's operations are xxxxxxxxxxxx and therefore less prone to environmental infractions . 
THE VIEW FROM OTHER [ORG IOCS  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed that the new fund is simply a new name for the old compensation claims fund . 
He noted xxxxxxxxxxxx is already devoting resources to social programs in [LOC Libya  ] , including a diabetes awareness and treatment project with experts affiliated with [ORG Harvard University  ] . 
To require the company to " voluntarily " pay into a new fund would be a non-starter for xxxxxxxxxxxx. xxxxxxxxxxxx wondered why the government did not simply levy a new tax on the [ORG IOCs  ] rather than create the new fund . 
While the companies would not have liked this , it would have simplified collecting the funds and provided a more tenable approach with respect to [ORG FCPA  ] issues. xxxxxxxxxxxx told the Ambassador he was concerned by the [ORG NOC  ] 's decision to convoke [MISC Libyan  ] national deputy [ORG GM  ] 's , an approach he viewed as " targeting " [MISC Libyan  ] colleagues in the belief that they would be more susceptible to strong-arm tactics . 
( Note: He personally assessed that his locally-engaged staff were even more loyal to the [ORG IOCs  ] than the expatriate staff . 
End note . 
) He noted that the [ORG NOC  ] typically convoked expatriate general managers . 
Even though xxxxxxxxxxxx in [LOC Libya  ] was not directly impacted by the [LOC Lockerbie  ] compensation issue , xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed the [ORG IOCs  ] needed to " hold rank " and not succumb to pressure to pay into the new fund . 
As xxxxxxxxxxxx is only involved in xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx , its susceptibility to potential environmental fines is also slight . 
He noted xxxxxxxxxxxx is already supporting several social programs in [LOC Libya  ] . 
They are proud of their road safety program and believe this program could be partly credited with the government 's recently-enacted requirement that drivers wear seat-belts not only on highways but also within [LOC Tripoli.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx Payments into the new fund would be very difficult to justify to xxxxxxxxxxxx shareholders and lawyers , who are concerned with the bottom line and [ORG FCPA  ] issues , respectively. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: Efforts to solicit contributions under the new law reflect the intense pressure xxxxxxxxxxxx the [ORG NOC  ] are under from the most senior levels - likely including [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] himself- to generate money for the claims compensation fund . 
If the law for the new charity fund had been rolled out a few months from now and had not been blatantly connected to the compensation fund , [ORG IOCs  ] may have been able to seriously consider contributing . 
In addition to the fact that the [ORG NOC  ] didn't bother to try to maintain the fiction that the new fund was different from the claims compensation fund , slumping oil prices , the global recession and disappointment with meager oil and gas discoveries in [LOC Libya  ] by [ORG IOCs  ] to date make it difficult to impossible for [ORG IOCs  ] to seriously entertain TRIPOLI 00000413 003.2 OF 003 this latest demand .
