( C ) Senior GOP Officials have expressed doubts to the Embassy and to members of a visiting [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congressional  ] delegation about the ability of the [ORG GUPC Consortium  ] led by [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Italian  ] firms [ORG Sacyr  ] and [ORG Impregilo  ] to carry out the work on the expansion of the [LOC Panama  ] [ORG Canal.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At a December 29 lunch with the Ambassador , Vice President/Foreign Minister [PER Juan Carlos Varela  ] expressed serious concerns about [ORG GUPC  ] , raising the topic by saying dramatically , " The [ORG Canal  ] expansion project is a disaster . 
" He described the companies that are leading the consortium as being in deep financial trouble and expressed his dismay that the same companies that cannot do the [ORG Canal  ] expansion are now trying to win the bid for the [ORG Panama City Metro  ] project . 
" In two or three years , " he continued , " it will be obvious this was all a failure . 
" ( Note: VP [PER Varela  ] is sensitive to possible failures with the [ORG Canal Expansion and Metro Projects  ] , because his aspiration to be elected President in 2014 is currently highly dependent on a successful on-time completion of the projects .

) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Varela  ] again voiced his concerns on January 3 in a conversation with [ORG DCM  ] and visiting [ORG CODEL  ] member [LOC U.S.  ] Rep. [PER Pedro Pierluisi  ] of [LOC Puerto Rico  ] . 
[PER Varela  ] told [PER Pierluisi  ] that the consortium was " very weak " and he had " real doubts " about their ability to perform . 
Separately , [PER Varela  ] said to [ORG DCM  ] , " You don't mess around with something as important as the [ORG Canal  ] . 
When one of the bidders makes a bid that is a billion dollars below the next competitor , then something is seriously wrong . 
Of course I hope for the best , but I 'm afraid that [PER Alberto  ] [ [ORG Canal  ] administrator [PER Alberto Aleman  ] ] has made a big mistake . 
" See reftel. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) President [PER Martinelli  ] expressed similar doubts in a conversation with Ambassador on the margins of a GOP presentation to the [ORG CODEL  ] on January 4 . 
When the Ambassador asked how he thought the [ORG Canal  ] expansion project was going , [PER Martinelli  ] grimaced and indicated he was a bit worried . 
He said that he feared that [ORG Canal  ] Administrator [PER Aleman  ] might have tipped the bid toward the consortium that included [LOC CUSA  ] , which is run by his cousin [PER Rogelio Aleman.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: While  ] we at the embassy have heard rumblings of tussles within the winning consortium as the lead contractor tries to squeeze subcontractors to bring costs down to the low winning bid , we have not thought the expansion project to be in any real trouble . 
Certainly [ORG Canal  ] Administrator [PER Aleman  ] remains very upbeat about the project , both in public and in private , and we have always regarded him as a highly capable manager with unimpeachable integrity . 
Given that the Vice President is now raising his concerns with visiting [MISC Codels  ] , however , we though it best to let [LOC Washington  ] know that there are concerns and there may possibly be real trouble . 
Post provided relentless advocacy for the [ORG Bechtel  ] bid on the [ORG Canal  ] expansion and understands through our continuing close contacts with [ORG Bechtel  ] that they , with their reputation for coming in to clean up messes , are keeping a close eye on how the project is advancing ( or not ) . 
End comment .
