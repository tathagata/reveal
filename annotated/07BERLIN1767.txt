Summary <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The September 4 arrests of three terrorist suspects , two of whom are [MISC German  ] citizens who converted to [MISC Islam  ] , has given [LOC Germany  ] its first high-profile case of homegrown [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism and focused attention on the southern [MISC German  ] area of [LOC Ulm/Neu-Ulm  ] , which authorities have long identified as a hotbed of radical [MISC Islam  ] . 
The arrests of [PER Gelowicz  ] and [PER Schneider  ] , both ethnic [MISC Germans  ] and life-long residents of [LOC Germany  ] , have changed public perceptions concerning the threat of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism in [LOC Germany  ] and raised questions within political circles as to what potential measures should be taken to more closely monitor extremists . 
Furthermore , the news that the three suspects received instructions from [MISC Pakistan-based  ] [ORG Islamic Jihad Union  ] ( [ORG IJU  ] ) leadership has generated a new awareness and recognition of the need to increase surveillance capabilities as well as enhance cooperation with international partners . 
The Interior and [ORG Justice Ministries  ] are preparing legislation to strengthen the capabilities of prosecutors and increase the investigative powers of security officials to counter the homegrown terrorist threat . 
End Summary [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG First Homegrown Islamic Terrorists  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The September 4 arrests of three suspects planning large-scale attacks in [LOC Germany  ] has sent shockwaves through [LOC Germany  ] , given that two of the alleged terrorists , [PER Fritz Gelowicz  ] and [PER Daniel Martin Schneider  ] , were [MISC German  ] citizens with non-immigrant backgrounds who converted to [MISC Islam  ] as teenagers ( Ref A ) . 
Previous terrorist cases over recent history have typically involved individuals with immigrant backgrounds and/or dual nationalities who were generally raised as [MISC Muslims  ] from birth . 
Although there has been at least one previous instance in which a [MISC German  ] convert has taken up arms in the cause of [MISC Islam  ] ( e.g. , [PER Thomas  ] " [PER Hamza  ] " Fischer who died fighting in [LOC Chechnya  ] in 2003 ) , the current case is the first in which such converts were planning their attacks on [MISC German  ] soil against [MISC German  ] ( and [LOC U.S  ] . 
) targets. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Media coverage and editorials immediately following the arrests have expressed shock at how [PER Gelowicz  ] and [PER Schneider  ] , who had been raised in unremarkable typical [MISC German  ] circumstances , managed to adopt an [MISC Islamic  ] extremist ideology and plan violence against their fellow citizens . 
There has been much hand-wringing and anxious speculation on how many other potential homegrown terrorists in [LOC Germany  ] might be planning similar attacks . 
A poll ( by the national polling firm [ORG Emnid  ] ) taken shortly following the arrests indicated that 85 percent of the public believe the threat of terrorist attacks in [LOC Germany  ] has increased . 
This same poll showed that 56 percent of the public believe a strengthening of security legislation is the best response to the new threat. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As the arrests have highlighted the homegrown terrorist threat , there have been calls for government monitoring of [MISC German  ] converts to [MISC Islam  ] , who number in the thousands each year . 
Though not likely to see the legislative light of day ( see Septel ) , this proposal is a reaction to the perception that converts often tend to be more zealous believers in their new faith compared to those born into the religion . 
Minister Schaeuble , who leads the [ORG Federal government  ] 's " [MISC German  ] [ORG Islam Conference  ] " initiative , which attempts to promote an intercultural dialogue with the [MISC Muslim  ] community , commented that " One thing is certain: fighting the abuse of [MISC Islam  ] and exaggerated fundamentalism is , above all , a task for the [MISC Muslims  ] themselves . 
" [LOC Ulm/Neu-Ulm  ] - [ORG Centers of Radicalization  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Federal Prosecutors Office  ] has identified a number of [MISC German  ] cities as centers of [MISC Islamic  ] associations and potential sites for extremism , including [LOC Ulm  ] , [LOC Neu-Ulm  ] , [LOC Braunschweig  ] , [LOC Cologne  ] , [LOC Berlin  ] and [LOC Muenster  ] . 
Of these , the neighboring cities of [LOC Ulm  ] and [LOC Neu-Ulm  ] have figured the most [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001767 002 OF 003 prominently over the past decade as breeding grounds for [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
[LOC Ulm  ] , a mid-sized city ( population 120,000 ) in [LOC Germany  ] 's relatively conservative southern state of [LOC Baden-Wuerttemberg  ] , is a leading center for scientific research and birthplace of [PER Albert Einstein  ] . 
[LOC Ulm  ] was rated as [LOC Germany  ] 's most healthy city by the health-oriented magazine " [ORG Healthy Living  ] " in a nationwide survey last month . 
[LOC Neu-Ulm  ] ( population 51,000 ) is located on the eastern side of the [LOC Danube  ] river in [LOC Bavaria.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The cities received an influx of [MISC Muslim  ] refugees from [LOC Bosnia  ] in the mid 1990s , adding to their existing [MISC Muslim  ] communities which came mainly from [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Despite their traditionally moderate take on [MISC Islam  ] , [MISC Bosnian Muslims  ] developed ties with international extremists who were often viewed as the first to respond in [LOC Bosnia  ] 's hour of need . 
During the 1990s , the region was seen as a staging point for [MISC Muslim  ] extremist fighters going to [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
More recently , [LOC Ulm  ] and [LOC Neu-Ulm  ] have both hosted organizations that have played central roles in [LOC Germany  ] 's radical [MISC Islamist  ] spheres. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [LOC Multicultural House  ] ( [ORG MCH  ] ) in [LOC Neu-Ulm  ] was founded in 1996 and in the nine years that it was open attracted a series of noteworthy individuals and [MISC Islamic  ] extremists including: -- [PER Mahmoud Salim  ] , [PER Osama Bin Laden  ] 's chief of financial operations who visited in September 1998 . 
-- [PER Reda Seyam  ] , alleged to be one of the planners of the [LOC Bali  ] attacks of 12 October 2002 . 
-- Dr. [PER Yehia Yousif  ] , an [MISC Egyptian  ] who first came to [LOC Germany  ] in 1988 as a researcher but later became a jihad recruiter and hate preacher who took on a leading role at the [ORG MCH  ] . 
[PER Yousif  ] left [LOC Germany  ] in 2002 as investigations of his activities increased . 
[PER Yousif  ] 's oldest son , who is alleged to have spent time in a [LOC Pakistan  ] terrorist training camp , was deported after investigators found bomb-making instruction manuals in his apartment . 
-- [PER Khaled al-Masri  ] was a visitor to the [ORG MCH  ] . 
-- [PER Mohammed Atta  ] , one of the 9/11 terrorist pilots , is reported to have visited the [ORG MCH  ] . 
-- [PER Fritz Gelowicz  ] is reported to have been a frequent visitor of the [LOC MCH.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Following prolonged observation and investigation , [MISC Bavarian  ] officials finally closed the [ORG MCH  ] on 28 December 2005 and banned it on grounds that it promoted activities hostile to the constitution . 
[MISC Bavarian  ] authorities indicate that [ORG MCH  ] members had used the facility as a recruiting station for global jihad and distribution source of extremist literature . 
The ban was subsequently confirmed by the courts in January 2007 ( Ref C ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG Islamic Information Center  ] ( [ORG IIC  ] ) , founded in 1999 and located in [LOC Ulm  ] , has developed into a center of extremist activity particularly following the closure of the [ORG MCH  ] . 
Given its location in a different federal state , Baden-Wuerrtemberg security officials monitoring the [ORG IIC  ] have needed to overcome coordination issues with their counterparts in [LOC Bavaria  ] to ensure that extremists cannot escape observations by merely crossing the [LOC Danube  ] river . 
[LOC Baden-Wuerttemberg  ] authorities have listed the [ORG IIC  ] as an extremist center since 2003 . 
[PER Fritz Gelowicz  ] is reported to have joined the center in 2005 under the name [PER Abdullah  ] after following an introduction by his co-worker [PER Tolga Duerbin.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Authorities searched the [ORG IIC  ] in conjunction with the September 4 arrests and hope that materials collected will enable them to close the center . 
Baden-Wuerrtemberg Minister of Interior [PER Heribert Rech  ] commented that he is confident that these materials will be sufficient to close the [ORG IIZ  ] permanently . 
[LOC Ulm  ] 's mayor has also expressed the desire to close the center . 
Links to International Networks ------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) All three of the terrorist suspects arrested [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001767 003 OF 003 September 4 are believed to have trained in [ORG Islamic Jihad Union  ] ( [ORG IJU  ] ) camps in [LOC Pakistan  ] , and shortly following the arrests [ORG IJU  ] leadership issued a statement confirming that the three had indeed been operating under [ORG IJU  ] direction . 
The confirmation of this connection between an overseas terrorist organization and the [MISC Germany-based  ] suspects demonstrates that the terrorist threat to [LOC Germany  ] had reached a new level . 
Previous [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism cases in [LOC Germany  ] have not reached this level of sophistication and organization. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The arrests in [LOC Pakistan  ] and subsequent deportations back to [LOC Germany  ] of multiple [MISC German  ] citizens , or those with [MISC German  ] residency permission , in the past few months has proven just how potentially widespread the links are between [MISC Germany-based  ] [MISC Islamic  ] extremists and overseas terrorist leadership . 
Some of these individuals , such as [PER Tolga Duerbin  ] , have been arrested on their return to [LOC Germany  ] while others , such as [PER Aleem Nasir  ] and [PER Nihad C.  ] , have been permitted to remain free . 
In any case terrorist training camp returnees are cause for concern among security officials . 
Government Responses -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In a September 16 interview Minister [PER Schaeuble  ] summed up how the arrests had changed the political debate , saying: " We now know better than before that we are very much in the focus of [MISC Islamist  ] terrorists . 
" Since the arrests , [PER Schaeuble  ] has increased his calls for quick cabinet agreement on a number of legislative proposals to enhance the powers of the [ORG Federal Criminal Police  ] ( [ORG BKA  ] ) in counterterrorism investigations , as well as to permit the surveillance of the computers of terrorism suspects ( Ref B ) . 
This proposal for on-line computer investigations has been particularly controversial due to privacy concerns but [PER Schaeuble  ] has remained adamant , stating " We will not submit a [ORG BKA  ] bill without including the option of on-line searches . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Separately , the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] has drafted a proposal that would significantly increase prosecutorial powers aimed at those who train in foreign terrorist camps as well as permit authorities to take earlier action against those in the planning stages of a terrorist attacik ( see Septel for analysis ) . <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) This cable has been coordinated and developed jointly with [ORG Consulates General Munich  ] and [LOC Frankfurt  ] .
