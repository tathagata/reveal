GOVERNMENT OF [LOC CUBA  ] MAY ACCEPT [LOC U.S.  ] OFFER OF POST-HURRICANE ASSISTANCE REF: HAVANA 500 & 511 Classified By: CDA JAMES WILLIAMS FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) & ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary: On 3 September  ] 2009 , the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist  ] ( [ORG DIS  ] ) assigned to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Interests Section  ] ( [ORG USINT  ] ) in [LOC Havana  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , engaged in a candid conversation with a [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MINREX  ] ) official who provided insight into the possible Government of [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) response to any [ORG USG  ] offers of post-hurricane assistance to the [ORG GOC  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A [ORG MINREX  ] officer ( " officer " ) in the [ORG Ministry 's North American Division  ] , [PER Rodney  ] , who attends repatriations somewhat infrequently ( [ORG DIS  ] has had contact with this official on approximately 5 occasions- [ORG USINT  ] consular officers have also met this officer on other occasions while attending repatriations ) , exchanged pleasantries with the [ORG DIS  ] at the outset of the repatriation . 
During the boat ride to the receiving pier , the officer almost immediately directed the conversation towards what seemed to be a pre-planned discussion . 
Offering up the usual &in my personal opinion8 while placing a firm hand on his chest and gesturing towards himself , the officer stated: " I have been reading a lot of [LOC U.S.  ] press reports about possible [LOC U.S.  ] hurricane assistance and I think the [ORG GOC  ] would be willing to accept that assistance . 
" [ORG DIS  ] stated to the officer that that approach would be different than last year 's [ORG GOC  ] response to the multiple [ORG USG  ] offers of post-hurricane assistance . 
The officer went on to say that " ( political ) conditions this year are very different than they were last year this time , " an apparent reference to the recent re-establishment of [ORG USINT  ] access to [ORG MINREX  ] ( reftels ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DIS  ] stated to the officer that it was common and prudent practice to offer a disaster assistance response team ( DART ) to locations following natural disasters to assess the damage and the necessary level and type of assistance . 
The officer responded by saying that: " the level of damage to [LOC Cuba  ] during last year 's hurricane season was evident and the team was a precondition to providing post-hurricane assistance to [LOC Cuba  ] ; the [LOC U.S.  ] should not impose preconditions and should allow the [ORG GOC  ] to determine how assistance is used . 
" In turn , the [ORG DIS  ] responded that the [ORG USG  ] is not in the business of writing blank checks to foreign governments to which the officer seemed to be at a loss for words . 
The officer and the [ORG DIS  ] cordially agreed that this was an ideological difference between both nations , and agreed that while neither of us wanted to see any hurricane affect [LOC Cuba  ] , should the opportunity arise for the [ORG USG  ] to offer hurricane assistance to the [ORG GOC  ] , it would be interesting to see how the scenario unfolds. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) This officer is a young ( 29 years old ) , cordial , well-spoken [ORG MINREX  ] officer who utilizes repatriations as an opportunity to practice what might already be considered polished [MISC English  ] . 
He studied economics , is well versed in international political ideology , and appears to be a voracious reader . 
Like his more senior [ORG MINREX  ] counterparts , he makes a point during each repatriation to discuss recent [LOC U.S.  ] press reporting relative to [MISC U.S.-Cuba  ] relations , and uses each repatriation as an opportunity to elicit a response from the [ORG DIS  ] on a wide scope of [MISC U.S.-Cuban  ] matters , always under the guise of being a personal opinion or interest . 
He does not balk when given the chance to prop-up and support the tenets of the [MISC Cuban  ] revolution , and especially , in his government 's opinion , the harsh treatment the [ORG USG  ] has afforded the [MISC Cuban  ] people throughout the course of the revolution . 
He is able to support and speak to the major [ORG GOC  ] talking points ( i.e. the embargo , [MISC Cuban-Americans  ] , etc . 
) , and is likely to rise in the [LOC GOC.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: Yet again , [ORG MINREX  ] has utilized the [ORG DIS  ] and the repatriation process as a forum to air out a current [ORG GOC  ] focus , and float the idea by a [LOC U.S.  ] officer who the [ORG GOC  ] is aware works in the political-economic section at [ORG USINT  ] . 
The typical " this is my opinion " approach from this [ORG MINREX  ] officer is an opening gesture , whereafter he and each [ORG MINREX  ] officer then communicates a willingness , need , or current focus of the [ORG GOC  ] that they have decided to communicate to the [ORG Mission  ] and [ORG USG  ] at large . 
This may well be a concerted effort on the part of [ORG MINREX  ] to engage in one-on-one communication , at a relatively low-level , as a circuitous approach to [MISC GOC-U.S.  ] communications in lieu of direct or over-publicized talks . 
By communicating in this manner , the [ORG GOC  ] can communicate with the [ORG USG  ] , in this case over the issue of hurricane assistance , and still maintain its public image and propaganda campaign that lambaste the [ORG USG  ] for its approach towards [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Interestingly , [ORG DIS  ] cannot recall any recent press reporting having to do with possible post-hurricane assistance to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Further Comment: [ORG DIS  ] was extremely surprised by the hurricane assistance-related comments made by the [ORG MINREX  ] officer . 
Having spent a significant amount of time working and traveling with [MISC Cuban  ] MININT and [ORG MINREX  ] officers over the past year , [MISC Cubans  ] are extremely proud people , and almost never admit that there is a flaw in their system , even when the flaw is a glaring one . 
For a [ORG MINREX  ] officer to admit that his country may be willing to accept assistance from the [LOC U.S.  ] should a hurricane ravage this island again , ventures well beyond the perceived pride level of [ORG GOC  ] officials . 
More than anything , the [ORG GOC  ] does not like to be embarrassed , and taking handouts from the [ORG USG  ] may well be a point of embarrassment for the [ORG GOC  ] should they choose to accept . 
As such , any genuine post-hurricane assistance offer should be extended quietly ; however , the [ORG USG  ] should be wary that the [ORG GOC  ] may be expecting a blank check , not a calculated offer of pragmatic post-hurricane assistance . 
End Comment .
