( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: Secretary of Defense [PER Robert Gates  ] ( [ORG SecDef  ] ) met with [MISC Turkish  ] Minister of [ORG National Defense Mehmet Vecdi Gonul  ] ( [ORG MND Gonul  ] ) and the Chief of the [MISC Turkish  ] Genral Staff General [PER Ilker Basbug  ] ( Gen [PER Basbug  ] ) in separate meetings during his bilateral visit to [LOC Ankara  ] on February 6 , 2010 . 
[ORG SecDef  ] thanked [ORG Gonul  ] and [PER Basbug  ] for [LOC Turkey  ] 's valuable contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG Gonul  ] stressed [LOC Turkey  ] 's important role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a [MISC Muslim  ] country in the [ORG Alliance  ] and [PER Basbug  ] hailed continuing [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Turkish  ] support to [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG National Security Force  ] training and assistance to the [MISC Pakistani  ] Armed Forces . 
[ORG SecDef  ] and [ORG Gonul  ] discussed the importance of a [MISC Turkish  ] role in [ORG European Missile Defense  ] . 
On combating the [ORG PKK  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] , [ORG SecDef  ] agreed with [PER Basbug  ] that the key to further progress is greater [MISC Iraqi  ] cooperation with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] highlighted to [ORG Gonul  ] opportunities to increase military capability and gain economic benefits through choosing [ORG Sikorsky  ] helicopters or [MISC Raytheon Patriot  ] PAC-3 systems in ongoing tenders. ---------------------- Bilateral Relationship ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MND Gonul  ] stressed the importance of the [ORG SecDef  ] 's visit , noting that it built on the Prime Minister 's December meeting in [LOC Washington  ] with President [PER Obama  ] in December . 
[ORG SecDef  ] agreed on the importance of the bilateral relationship , and recalled that [MISC Turkish-American  ] solidarity extended from the [MISC Korean War  ] through the present in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] said he believed that [LOC Turkey  ] was undervalued as an [PER Ally  ] by many [MISC Europeans.  ] ----------- [LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In both meetings [ORG SecDef  ] conveyed [LOC U.S.  ] appreciation for [LOC Turkey  ] 's contributions to [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- including providing troops , OMLTs , POMLTs , a [ORG PRT  ] , commanding [MISC RC-Capital  ] , providing access through the [LOC Incirlik  ] air base , and allowing the transit of non-lethal goods to [LOC Afghanistan  ] through [MISC Turkish  ] air space . 
Regarding [LOC Turkey  ] 's contributions to [LOC ISAF  ] , GEN [PER Basbug  ] said that " we are trying to do our best " with the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Wardak  ] province and command of [MISC RC-Capital  ] . 
He observed that the hardest aspect of the fight against the [ORG Taliban  ] was differentiating between the real [ORG Taliban  ] and those that merely helped or supported the [ORG Taliban  ] or even indigenous forces not aligned with the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
However , [PER Basbug  ] was hopeful that Allies could win over some of those who were sympathetic to the [ORG Taliban  ] through a reintegration strategy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Gonul  ] emphasized that [LOC Turkey  ] had a " special connection " with the people of [LOC Afghanistan  ] due to common [MISC Islamic  ] roots . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's involvement in [LOC ISAF  ] offered a way of refuting insurgents' attempts to use [MISC Islam  ] as ideological justification for their efforts . 
[ORG SecDef  ] agreed that having [MISC Muslim  ] soldiers participate in [LOC ISAF  ] drives home the fact that the fight in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is not against [MISC Islam  ] but rather against terrorists who " pervert [MISC Islam  ] . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Basbug  ] was upbeat about prospects for success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , noting that the positive tone of GEN [PER McChrystal  ] 's brief at the [ORG NATO  ] CHODs conference had inspired more optimism among his colleagues than had his original September brief on his assessment . 
[ORG SecDef  ] said he agreed with [PER McChrystal  ] 's latest assessment that the situation was serious but no longer deteriorating , but warned that no one should exaggerate how well things were going . 
At the [ORG Istanbul Ministerial  ] as well , he said , there had clearly been a change in mood among the Ministers present . 
Significantly , Defense Minister [LOC Wardak  ] had told him that for the first time he had begun to hope for a successful outcome in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Basbug  ] described the terrorist attacks in [LOC Kabul  ] on January 18th as serious , but said that the ANSF response ultimately offered an " outstanding " example of how to manage a very complex operation . 
Nine terrorists were killed and two were captured , and the terrorists did not ultimately achieve their objectives . 
Describing post-attack operations as " a cause for optimism , " [PER Basbug  ] said that the [MISC Afghan  ] forces involved showed they were motivated , well disciplined , and well prepared for the fight . 
[PER Basbug  ] then reviewed [LOC Turkey  ] 's plans for training the [ORG ANA  ] and the [ORG ANP  ] , stressing that the priority was to provide unit training both in [LOC Turkey  ] and in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
So far , he said , [LOC Turkey  ] had trained three [MISC Afghan  ] companies and would open a training center in [LOC Kabul  ] to do battalion-level training soon. -------- [LOC Pakistan  ] -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Basbug  ] also raised [LOC Pakistan  ] , recalling his October visit at the invitation of General [PER Kayani  ] . 
During his visit to [LOC Swat  ] province he had witnessed a hundred-fold improvement in security since his previous visit , citing the return of civilian populations to the region as a clear success for [MISC Pakistani  ] forces . 
Sec Def agreed , observing that the degree of success by [MISC Pakistani  ] forces ran counter to all of our intelligence predictions. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Basbug  ] highlighted the [ORG TGF  ] 's support for [LOC Pakistan  ] 's armed forces - especially on logistics and maintenance of equipment , including spare parts for their [ORG Air Force  ] . 
He said that although overall relationships with [LOC Pakistan  ] were sometimes difficult , cooperation remained solid at the military level. ---------------- Counterterrorism ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Basbug  ] raised the issue of [LOC Turkey  ] 's protracted fight against the [ORG PKK  ] , highlighting progress over the past year due to the elimination of key leaders , divisions within [ORG PKK  ] ranks , and dwindling morale of [ORG PKK  ] fighters . 
This progress , [PER Basbug  ] said , was the result of increased [MISC U.S.-Turkish  ] cooperation since the end of 2007 , including intelligence sharing , provision of [ORG ISR  ] support , and use [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG UAV  ] assets in Northern [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Basbug  ] concluded by requesting additional support from the [LOC United States  ] government , [MISC Iraqi  ] government , and [ORG KRG  ] . 
Drawing a parallel to [LOC U.S.  ] actions in the cross-border region of [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Basbug  ] said that in order to continue to eliminate the [ORG PKK  ] threat , [LOC Turkey  ] needs more support from all stakeholders to pursue the top [ORG PKK  ] leadership. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Addressing [LOC Turkey  ] 's outstanding Reaper [ORG UAV  ] requests , [ORG SecDef  ] reaffirmed to [PER Basbug  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] is committed to the sale of Reapers to [LOC Turkey  ] , but offered the caveat that the sale would first have to be approved by [ORG Congress  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] added that the [ORG Pentagon  ] is also looking at additional reconnaissance capabilities in addition to the [MISC Predators  ] currently flown by the [LOC U.S.  ] The [LOC U.S.  ] he said , is considering some UAVs with shorter dwell times , which have proven to be effective in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Regarding current [ORG UAV  ] support -- which already provides an average of 16-17 hours of coverage daily -- [ORG SecDef  ] said that Gen Odierno will look at ways to surge up to 24-hour coverage when necessary , e.g. for operations involving high-value targets. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] emphasized that [LOC Turkey  ] 's dialogue with [ORG KRG  ] was very important . 
In his meeting the previous week with [ORG KRG  ] President [PER Barzani  ] , [ORG SecDef  ] said he pressed him once again to work with the [ORG PKK  ] to persuade them to abandon violence . 
[PER Basbug  ] agreed and said [LOC Turkey  ] 's dialogue with the [ORG KRG  ] was particularly important as a measure to persuade the [ORG KRG  ] to take a more proactive approach to the [LOC PKK.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Basbug  ] expressed concern about the [LOC U.S.  ] drawdown of forces from [LOC Iraq  ] , lamenting that while [LOC Turkey  ] has been successful in reducing the [ORG PKK  ] threat , it will be difficult to finish off the threat after [LOC U.S  ] forces leave . 
He concluded that [LOC Turkey  ] would need to " finish the problem " before the [LOC U.S.  ] drawdown was complete. ------------------------ Missile Defense and [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MND Gonul  ] said he considered the new [ORG US Phased  ] Adaptive approach better than the previous Administration 's approach , since the previous system did not cover [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG SecDef  ] agreed , noting that the [MISC Polish  ] and [MISC Romanian  ] agreement to host [MISC SM-3  ] missiles . 
He further emphasized that without a radar based in [LOC Turkey  ] , significant areas in the eastern part of the country would not be covered by the system. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Gonul  ] told [ORG SecDef  ] that discussions about the radar were ongoing within the [MISC Turkish  ] government and inquired about what alternate sites the [LOC U.S.  ] was considering . 
[ORG SecDef  ] responded that other countries in [MISC Southeast Europe  ] might be interested in hosting the radar , but reiterated that [LOC Turkey  ] was the optimal site . 
[ORG SecDef  ] explained that one of the reasons why he had embraced the new administration 's approach was that it provided protection for Allies and troops earlier than the previous program without reducing protection of the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Gonul  ] cited the enrichment program and acknowledged that [LOC Ankara  ] is " concerned about the [MISC Iranian  ] threat , " but said that the international community does not yet have evidence that there is a weapons program . 
[PER Gonul  ] said that even though [LOC Turkey  ] does not expect an attack from [LOC Iran  ] , the threat from [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC Turkey  ] 's [MISC European  ] allies would make an air defense capability important . 
( Comment: His acknowledgement of an [MISC Iranian  ] threat to [LOC Europe  ] diverges from previous [MISC Turkish  ] statements underplaying such a threat . 
) He repeated that the system would be designed to defend all of [LOC Europe  ] , and not solely [LOC Turkey.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] counseled that if [LOC Iran  ] goes forward with a nuclear weapons program , other states in the region were likely to proliferate as well . 
Additionally , there was a good chance [MISC Israelis  ] would at some point decide that military action was necessary . 
As [LOC Turkey  ] would inevitably be unable to sit out on any conflict in the region , it is important to be prepared militarily and [LOC Ankara  ] should not hesitate to acquire defensive systems , even as the international community works to stop [LOC Iran  ] 's efforts. -------------------- [ORG Acquisition Advocacy  ] -------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C//NF ) During his meeting with [PER Gonul  ] , [ORG SecDef  ] advised that [LOC Turkey  ] had opportunities to increase its military capabilities while gaining economic benefits by selecting [LOC U.S.  ] companies in currently open tenders . 
First , [PER Sikorsky  ] , was prepared to guarantee that for every helicopter produced in [LOC Turkey  ] and bought by [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Sikorsky  ] would produce a second helicopter in [LOC Turkey  ] for export . 
[ORG SecDef  ] explained that in addition to providing modern equipment for [LOC Turkey  ] , this offer would provide hundreds of millions of dollars in export revenue . 
[PER Gonul  ] replied that [PER Sikorsky  ] had told him [LOC Turkey  ] was the largest consumer of [PER Sikorsky  ] helicopters after the [LOC U.S.  ] and that [LOC Turkey  ] already was buying 70 [PER Sea Hawk  ] helicopters ( as well as 14 heavy lift helos ( CH-47s ) from [ORG Boeing  ] ) . 
The tender for the new project had been running for two years and the short list included [PER Sikorsky  ] and an [MISC Italian  ] company . 
[PER Gonul  ] believes [PER Sikorsky  ] has a good chance to win. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/NF ) A second opportunity involves the co-production of [ORG Raytheon  ] PAC-3 Patriot systems . 
Demand for these systems in the [LOC Gulf States  ] could potentially yield hundreds of millions of dollars in export revenue . 
[ORG SecDef  ] stressed that " nothing can compete with the [MISC PAC-3  ] when it comes to capabilities . 
" These opportunities are a chance for [LOC Turkey  ] to earn revenue while simultaneously enhancing capabilities and creating jobs. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Gonul  ] said this competition right now was between the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] , but noted that [MISC French  ] MoD [PER Morin  ] had indicated in [LOC Istanbul  ] that the [MISC French  ] would also make a bid including co-production arrangements . 
[PER Gonul  ] observed that as this was an expensive project and he had limited familiarity with the [MISC PAC-3:  ] he needed to be careful to make the right choice . 
[ORG SecDef  ] pointed out that the [ORG Raytheon  ] package would be easier to integrate with the command and control of the [LOC U.S.  ] and others using the same system. -------------------- [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] -------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Gonul  ] said [LOC Turkey  ] was pleased to be part of the joint [ORG Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program and noted his belief that it was important for [LOC Turkey  ] to have maintenance facilities in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[LOC SD  ] remarked that because the program was recently restructured , cost estimates were now realistic . 
[ORG SecDef  ] noted he had directed the [ORG JSF  ] program manager to put additional funding in the [LOC FY2011  ] and [LOC FY2012  ] budget for [ORG JSF  ] . 
However , because of contractor delays , the timeline had slipped about a year . 
In conclusion , [PER Gonul  ] raised [LOC Turkey  ] 's [MISC F-16  ] modernization program and expressed concern that new upgrades precluded [MISC Turkish  ] access to computer systems and software modification previously allowed . 
[MISC Turkish  ] Under Secretary for Industry [PER Bayar  ] told [ORG SecDef  ] he would pursue this issue in greater detail with Under Secretary of Defense for [ORG Acquisition Ash Carter.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG SecDef  ] has cleared this cable .
