End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG GoB  ] hosted the first preparatory meeting of the [LOC Ethanol Forum  ] on September 5 at the [LOC Itamaraty Palace  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER U/S Patriota  ] of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MFA  ] hosted the meeting on behalf of [PER Tereza Campello  ] , a member of the [ORG Casa Civil  ] and [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] 's deputy Chief of Staff . 
[PER Patriota  ] opened by emphasizing the intergovernmental nature of the proceedings and the benefits of ethanol , including environmental friendliness , third-world development , energy security and job creation . 
He also made clear that [LOC Brazil  ] 's objective in creating the [LOC Ethanol Forum  ] is not to sell anything , but to promote an idea . 
Moreover , he identified as the underlying driver for this forum , the [ORG GoB  ] belief that an international market for ethanol would not develop as expeditiously as the [ORG GoB  ] would like without government intervention . 
True to its free-form beginnings , [PER Patriota  ] clarified that the [ORG GoB  ] had no view on how to structure the debate except to bring together producers and consumers to promote economic expansion and map a path to make biofuels available on a global scale . 
The meeting produced neither minutes nor a statement . 
The ultimate goal was to have each of the parties present their views on the subject and agree to meet again before the end of the year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In opening the debate , the [ORG Casa Civil  ] 's [PER Tereza Campello  ] and [PER Ricardo Dornelles  ] of the [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] each gave brief presentations outlining [LOC Brazil  ] 's current biofuel outlook from a political and technical standpoint . 
[PER Campello  ] highlighted that the Forum is key to [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy strategy and that an interministerial group composed of the [ORG Ministries of Agriculture  ] , Science and Technology , [ORG Mines  ] and [ORG Energy  ] and [ORG External Relations  ] was created to discuss the issue . 
It is important to note that [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and the [ORG Casa Civil  ] are and will continue running [LOC Brazil  ] 's biofuel/ethanol strategy . 
[PER Dornelles  ] , for his part gave a view of [LOC Brazil  ] 's biofuel matrix , emphasizing Ethanol , [ORG Biodiesel  ] and [ORG H-Bio  ] . 
The [ORG GoB  ] 's current energy policy is to guarantee internal supply of ethanol , stimulate private investment , provide a tax model to promote increased use and production , and to maintain free prices throughout the production and supply chain. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Following this overview , [PER Patriota  ] proffered four questions with which to structure the discussion: 1 ) In which way can our governments cooperate to create an international market for biofuels taking into consideration environmental and food security aspects ; 2 ) What should be the scope of an intergovernmental partnership to promote an international market for ethanol ; 3 ) Which are the core elements of a common agenda ; 4 ) Agreement on a date and venue of an additional meeting ( before the end of 2006 ) to pursue further dialogue . 
Minister [PER Antonio Simoes  ] , director of the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Energy Division  ] , opened the dialogue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Simoes  ] posited that each of the representatives needed to think about production to ensure adequate supply of fuel , while taking into account environmental and food security . 
He reiterated the concept that [LOC Brazil  ] is promoting an idea on renewable fuels and not trying to sell anything . 
Noting each country 's unique environment and experience he emphasized the need to democratize the production process and create more producers , making money available to help developing countries via AID agencies , technical assistance bilateral and trilateral means . 
He also highlighted the [ORG GoB  ] desire to focus on rules and regulations and to define concrete standards . 
In terms of the intergovernmental scope , [LOC Brazil  ] would like to work on this project bilaterally , trilaterally , and plurilaterally ( through multiple governments outside the fora of the [ORG UN  ] ) . 
Finally , the [ORG GoB  ] deems an ideal core agenda to include an analysis of ethanol production aspects , its current and potential use as a fuel and a presentation of perspectives of promoting ethanol in an international market . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001934 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG EU  ] represented by Ambassador [PER Pacheco  ] followed , agreeing to the concept of an ethanol forum and to the commoditization of ethanol . 
The [ORG EU  ] reiterated the need to discuss technological standards and proposed that the conference adopt a more holistic [ORG Biofuel Forum  ] . 
This would , according to [PER Pacheco  ] , more adequately address the unique situation in a variety of countries/regions . 
In closing , the Ambassador added that the [ORG EU  ] will host an international [ORG Biofuel Conference  ] in early 2007 ( invitations will be sent shortly ) and will also host a more technical conference in January of 07 to discuss biofuel technical standards. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC India  ] , represented by Ambassador [PER Puri  ] welcomed the initiative as timely and overdue . 
He underscored the need to shore up ethanol supplies , noting that while [LOC India  ] produces nearly as much sugar as [LOC Brazil  ] , it needs to import additional sugar to support its immense population . 
[PER Puri  ] proffered that the principal mechanism to affect public policy change on a global scale is to make raw materials available . 
Under core concepts , [LOC India  ] agreed with the [ORG EU  ] proposal to expand the focus of the forum from ethanol to biofuels. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC South African  ] delegation , led by Ambassador Zulu , declared itself a nation with a biofuels program in its infancy . 
As its program develops , [LOC South Africa  ] 's principal concern will be to ensure that biofuel development is somehow tied into food security , and the delegation emphasized the import of creating ethanol from food sources . 
[LOC South Africa  ] also recommended focusing on the electricity generating potential of biofuels and the need to harmonize standards in order to facilitate increased trade . 
The delegation asserted that the Forum 's core concepts must include sustainable production and job creation in developing countries . 
It also underlined the need to evaluate current biofuel endeavors so as to not duplicate existing efforts. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC China  ] , for its part , agreed verbatim to the talking points set forth by the [ORG GoB  ] and [PER Simoes  ] , agreed to expand the breadth of the Forum to include biofuels and agreed to cooperate with the consensus decision regarding a time to meet before the end of the year. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Greg Manuel  ] rounded out the discussion elaborating on the [ORG USG  ] 's two key principals: 1 ) any cooperation that promotes production and consumption benefits collective interests and 2 ) the private sector should be involved in the discussion early and often . 
He posited that the immense economic opportunity represented by biofuels mean that the private sector will be the natural engine driving the globalization of the product . 
[PER Manuel  ] underscored this , alluding to the fact that the private sector in the [LOC U.S.  ] is responsible for the large majority of investment into biofuels . 
He also emphasized tool sets with which the collective could obtain the Ethanol Forum 's goal . 
The [ORG USG  ] perspective is that governments should play a strong role in orienting and assembling public and private institutions toward production and consumption , and should utilize diplomatic persuasion and foreign assistance to assist transitional economies via development assistance , technology transfer , etc. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Following the aforementioned comments , [PER Patriota  ] stepped back into the fray . 
Noting the convergence of body as a whole , he suggested holding the next meeting in the second half of November . 
He also presented the delegations with a list of taskers to finish by October 30 . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] 's [ORG Energy Division  ] will act as a clearing house for the collection and dissemination of the aggregate data . 
The tasks include creating a 5-6 page paper outlining each delegation 's view of intergovernmental action especially in light of the [ORG USG  ] view that future modalities should include the private sector . 
Other tasks include mapping current research to avoid repetition , drawing up a survey of national and international institutions relevant to the discussion ( generating resources for country development ) , and outlining each countries own structure and procedure in dealing with biofuels: i.e. who generates policy , responsible for execution. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [LOC Brazil  ] 's own internal debate or struggle to formulate policy was the most salient factor to come out of this meeting . 
From U/S [PER Patriota  ] 's deferential treatment of the [ORG Casa Civil  ] 's [LOC Campello  ] , to his allusion that a policy shake-up is due , it is clear that [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and the [ORG Casa Civil  ] are in charge [LOC Brazil  ] 's biofuel policy . 
It is also obvious that the exact nature of the [ORG GoB  ] 's biofuel executing mechanism is not yet certain . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001934 003.2 OF 003 [PER Patriota  ] was unwilling to divulge [LOC Brazil  ] 's organic make-up noting that [LOC Brazil  ] is still deciding how to organize and noting that a change is likely following [LOC Brazil  ] 's October election. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On a whole , the meeting produced no substance . 
It did , however , provide a backdrop for the [ORG USG  ] to present its views on the Forum ; most importantly , the necessary role that the private sector needs to play in its development . 
It also proved that , at least initially , tariff and trade would not be incorporated into the Forum 's substantive discussions . 
In a side conversation with [PER Patriota  ] and [PER Simoes  ] , the [ORG USG  ] expressed concern about the existence of two international biofuel forums , [LOC GBEP  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's Ethanol Forum . 
The [ORG USG  ] stressed the need for [LOC Brazil  ] to find a way to reconcile the two groups in terms of scope and purpose , perhaps by talking with the [MISC Italians  ] . 
Otherwise , the [ORG USG  ] would have difficulty participating in the Ethanol Forum . 
The ultimate achievements of the meeting were the universal agreement that the Ethanol Forum should include biofuels , opening more doors to develop regions unsuitable for ethanol production and greater private sector participation , and the decision to meet prior to the end of the year .
