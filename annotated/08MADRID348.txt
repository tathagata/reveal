( [ORG U  ] ) The absentee votes are in , and recounts have taken place in the most contested districts of [LOC Spain  ] . 
The final electoral numbers for [LOC Spain  ] 's 350-seat [ORG Congress  ] are as follows . 
The ruling Socialist party of President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) - 169 , the main opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) - 154 , the [MISC Catalan  ] centrist party [ORG Convergence and Union  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] ) - 10 , the [ORG Basque Nationalist Party  ] ( [ORG PNV  ] ) - 6 , the [MISC Catalan  ] [LOC Republican Left  ] ( [ORG ERC  ] ) - 3 , the [LOC United Left  ] ( [ORG IU  ] ) - 2 , the [ORG Canaries Coalition  ] ( [ORG CC  ] ) - 2 , the [ORG Galician Nationalist Bloc  ] ( [ORG BNG  ] ) - 2 , the [ORG Navarran/Basque  ] party ( [MISC Na-Bai  ] ) - 1 , and the new party [ORG Union  ] , [ORG Progress and Democracy  ] ( [ORG UPD  ] ) - 1. //TIMELINE TO FORM THE NEW GOVERNMENT// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The new [ORG Congress  ] will meet for the first time on April 1 and President [PER Zapatero  ] will be given the opportunity to form a government . 
As his party fell seven seats short of an absolute majority , [PER Zapatero  ] will look to enter into a pact with one or more of the smaller parties to put him over the top . 
Depending on the demands of each of the smaller parties , there remains the chance that [PER Zapatero  ] may feel he has enough of a plurality to preclude having to forge a formal pact , choosing instead to form pacts " a la carte " as each new piece of legislation comes up for a vote . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has consistently stated his preference to lead a stable government , making an " a la carte " situation less likely . 
The investiture debate is due to occur on April 7-8 , and if all goes as planned and the King swears in [PER Zapatero  ] on April 9 , the new cabinet of ministers would then be sworn in on April 10 , and the first meeting of the new [ORG Council of Ministers  ] would be held on April 11. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) No one doubts that [PER Zapatero  ] will end up being [LOC Spain  ] 's next president , but he may have trouble gaining the necessary 176 votes during the first round of investiture voting . 
This could change in the coming days , pending the results of [ORG PSOE  ] negotiations with the smaller parties . 
At this time , the most likely scenario appears to be a pact with the [ORG PNV  ] and their six seats , with the final vote to gain a majority in Parliament coming from any one or several of the numerous smaller parties that make up what is known as the " [ORG Mixed Group  ] " ( [ORG CC  ] , [ORG BNG  ] , [ORG IU  ] , [MISC Na-Bai  ] , [ORG ERC  ] ) . 
As the leftist parties [ORG IU  ] and [ORG ERC  ] lost much of their power and influence with respect to the previous legislature , they probably would be willing to join [PER Zapatero  ] for a very small price . 
Reports surfaced in the press in the days following the March 9 election suggesting that the [ORG PSOE  ] 's natural partners in this new legislature were the [MISC Basque  ] nationalists . 
[ORG PNV  ] leaders visited the Embassy on March 12 and told us that they would be favorably disposed to an alliance with the [ORG PSOE  ] . 
Contrary to post-election statements in the press , the [ORG PNV  ] leaders told us there was some flexibility in their demands for a controversial referendum on the political status of the [MISC Basque  ] people . 
The officials said that the [ORG PNV  ] realizes that it suffered a severe electoral setback on March 9 , and is in no position to make unrealistic demands if it wants to repeat its participation in a [PER Zapatero  ] government . 
These sentiments appeared to be confirmed by [ORG PNV  ] President [PER Inigo Urkullu  ] on March 17 , when he said publicly that his party would be willing to cooperate with the Socialists over the coming months and would consider standing down on its plans for a referendum in October of this year , provided that President [PER Zapatero  ] make sincere efforts to discuss the status of [MISC Basque  ] autonomy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Although [ORG CiU  ] could put the [ORG PSOE  ] over the top without having to turn to the [ORG PNV  ] and the [ORG Mixed Group  ] , the [ORG PSOE  ] 's allies in [LOC Catalonia  ] handily defeated [ORG CiU  ] in almost every [MISC Catalan  ] province , and there would be some pushback from these allies were [PER Zapatero  ] to consider forming a pact . 
In addition , [ORG CiU  ] 's demands for senior leadership roles in both the [ORG Congress  ] and [ORG Senate  ] ( [LOC Spain  ] 's upper house ) may be a deal breaker . 
Finally , [PER Zapatero  ] could gain a majority by forming a broad alliance exclusively with the remaining smaller parties ( most are nationalist and/or leftist ) , but most analysts have ruled this out as a repeat of the weak and unwieldy coalition the president formed during the last legislature. //PARTIDO POPULAR LOOKS TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND MOVE ON// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) Despite external speculation and pressure for his resignation after a second straight national election loss , [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] announced on March 11 during a meeting of the [ORG MADRID  ] 00000348 002.2 OF 003 [ORG PP  ] 's executive council that he would not resign as president of the [ORG Partido Popular  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said he would again present his candidacy for this position during the [ORG PP  ] 's National [ORG Congress  ] in June , and the party 's executive committee immediately expressed their support for the decision . 
Although [PER Rajoy  ] appears set to lead the party for the foreseeable future , he probably will look to reshuffle his team in efforts to improve the party 's image . 
On March 13 , [ORG PP  ] Congressional spokesman [PER Eduardo Zaplana  ] announced that he would not remain in the post for a second term , in a move pundits and political leaders immediately signaled as the first casualty of the electoral defeat . 
Speculation has since arisen that the Secretary General of the party , [PER Angel Acebes  ] , may be on his way out as well . 
[PER Zaplana  ] and [PER Acebes  ] are considered right-wing members of the [ORG PP  ] old guard , closely linked both to the [ORG Aznar  ] administration and the controversial handling of the aftermath and investigation of the 2004 [MISC Madrid  ] train bombings. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a separate announcement on March 13 , centrist [MISC Madrid  ] Mayor [PER Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon  ] said he had no plans to leave his position and would work for the good of the party in the coming years . 
After the Mayor had a public dispute with party leaders in January over his possible candidacy as [PER Rajoy  ] 's number two , he said he would wait until after the elections to make a decision about his political future . 
[PER Ruiz-Gallardon  ] is seen as a more moderate member of the [ORG PP  ] and has often had public disagreements with the party 's more conservative members . 
The Mayor previewed this announcement in a private meeting with the Ambassador on March 12 . 
[PER Ruiz-Gallardon  ] confirmed that he would be staying in office , and said that he would be taking steps to mend his relationship with [PER Rajoy  ] and hopefully return to the party 's good graces . 
The Mayor and [PER Rajoy  ] were due to have lunch this week . 
The Mayor confirmed for the Ambassador that [PER Rajoy  ] was the [ORG PP  ] 's leader , as there were simply no other credible options . 
He said that someone like he or [MISC Madrid  ] regional President [PER Esperanza Aguirre  ] could try and take over the party , but at the risk of splitting it right down the middle . 
He said that [PER Rajoy  ] staying put was the best way to minimize damage to the [ORG PP.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Ruiz-Gallardon  ] said that [PER Rajoy  ] would now take concerted steps to mold the party more in his image and decouple it from the strong influence of [ORG Aznar  ] . 
As an example , the Mayor said that [PER Rajoy  ] had asked Anzar not to participate in the March 11 executive council meeting . 
The departure of [PER Zaplana  ] and potentially [PER Acebes  ] may be further signs of [PER Rajoy  ] trying to distance himself from the [ORG PP  ] 's controversial past . 
[PER Ruiz-Gallardon  ] also told the Ambassador that [PER Rajoy  ] would take steps over the coming months to appear more " statesmanlike , " and would temporarily cease his constant criticism of every [PER Zapatero  ] policy initiative . 
The Mayor also mentioned that [PER Rajoy  ] is considering a strategy whereby he would tell [PER Zapatero  ] that the [ORG PP  ] will support him for 12 months , voting for his budget proposal and any other policy issue that does not cross [ORG PP  ] " redlines , " so that [PER Zapatero  ] would not need the support of the other parties . 
At some point the pact would dissolve and [PER Rajoy  ] would be free to make a public announcement saying that his party had supported the president in good faith , but that his policies were leading [LOC Spain  ] over a cliff and they could not in good conscience continue their support. //COMMENT// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Both main candidates departed for separate vacations on March 14 and will return after Easter to prepare for the new legislature . 
We will work closely with the new government ( we expect several holdovers and a few new faces ) to build on the progress we have made over the past three years . 
President [PER Bush  ] 's phone call to President [PER Zapatero  ] and reported plans for the two to chat at the [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Bucharest  ] are receiving positive play among our [MISC Spanish  ] counterparts and the local press , and will serve as a positive base to our relations with the new government . 
We also will maintain good relations with our friends in the [ORG PP  ] , while reminding them that it is in both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] interests that we work well with the government in power . 
It will be interesting to see whether [PER Rajoy  ] actually pledges his support to the government as the Mayor suggested , but we doubt that [PER Zapatero  ] would accept this proposition with anything but the utmost caution . 
[PER Rajoy  ] may find himself walking a fine line between acting statesmanlike and changing the tone of political discourse in [LOC Madrid  ] , while also remaining faithful to his traditional [ORG PP  ] supporters , over 55 percent of whom want him to lead an even harder opposition to [PER Zapatero  ] in the new government , according to a recent poll [ORG MADRID  ] 00000348 003.2 OF 003 from [LOC Sigma Dos  ] .
