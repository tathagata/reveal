Minister [PER Amado  ] said that he needed to check with the Prime Minister who would be difficult to convince , but that he would push hard for [MISC Portuguese  ] cooperation so long as there was total transparency . 
Details would need to be worked out ; there would need to be a clear political approach .

[PER Amado  ] commented that the media had misquoted him when it said that he had acknowledged [ORG CIA  ] flights . 
All he said was that he had the same list of flights as [ORG Eurocontrol  ] had. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] agitation on this issue , [PER Amado  ] expressed a need to control his own [ORG Socialist Party  ] .

( C ) Ambassador [PER Hoffman  ] assured [PER Amado  ] that the [LOC US  ] was very careful to abide by all its agreements with [LOC Portugal  ] - in word and in spirit - and that the Ambassador had shared all the information he had on the subject with [PER Amado  ] .

[ORG EU  ] 's [ORG New Role  ] ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Amado  ] commented that at the beginning of August , the [ORG EU  ] had " nothing to say " on developments in the [LOC Middle East  ] , and that many member-states were afraid that the conflict in [LOC Lebanon  ] would spiral out of control . 
A month later , the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] had met three times and agreed to pursue a greater political and military role - beyond the traditional role of providing development and humanitarian assistance . 
[PER Amado  ] underscored that there was a strong desire within the [ORG EU  ] to coordinate initiatives with the [LOC US  ] so as not to open a new rift in the transatlantic relationship .

[PER Amado  ] says - Engage [LOC Syria  ] , Isolate [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Amado  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] posed the greatest threat since WWII - alluding to the country 's growing influence in the [LOC Middle East  ] , the spread of [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalism , and its nuclear program - and underscored the need for all sides to work together on solving the problem . 
( Note: He did not offer any concrete examples . 
) He agreed with the [ORG USG  ] 's four basic principles on [LOC Syria  ] . 
However , he added , the [ORG EU  ] thought it was important to engage [LOC Syria  ] , and that by doing so , the [LOC West  ] would be in a better position to isolate [LOC Iran  ] . 
On the other hand , if the [LOC West  ] isolated [LOC Syria  ] , it would push the country further into [LOC Iran  ] 's sphere of influence . 
He noted that officials from [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC Greece  ] , [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Spain  ] had recently met with [MISC Syrian  ] officials , and he encouraged the [LOC US  ] to have greater political contact with [LOC Syria  ] . 
He said that he had agreed to meet with [MISC Syrian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bilal  ] after learning that several [ORG Socialist Party  ] members had already agreed to do so ( ref c ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Amado  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] wanted to isolate [LOC Iran  ] by enhancing the role of the [ORG Arab League  ] in drawing a distinction between [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Islamic  ] identity . 
Limiting the spread of [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalismhe declared , could limit [LOC Iran  ] 's influence in the [MISC Muslim  ] world . 
He did not buy into any of the claims by [MISC Syrian  ] Information Minister [PER Bilal  ] that the [LOC US  ] was to blame for all the [LOC Middle East  ] 's woes , underscoring to [PER Bilal  ] the strong [MISC US-Portuguese  ] alliance and the strong role the [LOC US  ] played in the global arena . 
He urged [LOC Syria  ] to focus on the issues , not play the blame game . 
Urging the [ORG CPLP  ] to support [LOC Guatemala  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Ambassador encouraged [LOC Portugal  ] to reach out to the Lusophone community to urge support for [LOC Guatemala  ] 's election to the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
[PER Amado  ] said he planned to do so when he meets with members of the Community of [MISC Portuguese  ] Speaking Nations ( [ORG CPLP  ] ) in [LOC New York  ] later this month . 
[PER Amado  ] would not confirm an official visit by [PER Hugo Chavez  ] to [LOC Portugal  ] later this year ( ref d ) . 
While admitting that they could not hold him off forever , [PER Amado  ] commented that no arrangements had been made to receive [PER Chavez  ] . 
He added that he had recently met with [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] , who he thought could offer useful insight into dealing with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC Portugal  ] planned to have greater dialogue with [PER Lula  ] should he win reelection . 
He emphasized the need for strong [LOC US  ] engagement with [LOC Brazil  ] to manage the [LOC Venezuela  ] situation . 
Comment ----------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S/NF ) As usual , this was a very friendly and broad-ranging discussion . 
[PER Amado  ] is very pro-American and extremely accessible . 
He was strongly supportive of our request to use Lajes as a refueling/transit point for [MISC Gitmo  ] detainees being returned to their home countries and was prepared to press the Prime Minister for an expeditious and positive response , so long as we continue to be fully transparent with the [ORG GOP  ] about the flights .
