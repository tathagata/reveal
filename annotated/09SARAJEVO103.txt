( C ) SUMMARY: Amid resurgence over the past two years of politics dogged by nationalist rhetoric , some [MISC Bosniak  ] ( [MISC Muslim  ] ) political actors have sought to portray themselves as more capable of protecting [MISC Bosniak  ] interests than their opponents . 
One aspect of this tussle is an increasingly-visible rift in the [MISC Bosniak  ] community that centers on what it means to be a " good " or " bad " [MISC Bosniak  ] . 
" Good [PER Bosniaks  ] , " according to this sentiment , are those who espouse conservative political and religious ideals . 
More moderate and secular ideals are , by implication , held by " bad [PER Bosniaks  ] . 
" Statements from the [ORG Islamic Community  ] , particularly its leader , [PER Reis Ceric  ] , that label those who criticize [ORG Islamic Community  ] as " [MISC Islamophobic  ] " have sharpened this polarization among [PER Bosniaks  ] . 
[LOC Bosnia  ] 's largest-circulation and most influential pro-Bosniak daily , [ORG Dnevni Avaz  ] , has also increasingly championed " good [MISC Bosniak  ] " causes and unscrupulously attacked [PER Bosniaks  ] and [MISC Bosniak  ] institutions ( including a rival , more secular [MISC Bosniak  ] daily ) that disagree with it . 
This press war , sparked largely by [ORG Avaz  ] 's business interests , has helped the intra-Bosniak debate gain traction more quickly and more broadly than it might otherwise . 
Depending on the path the debate takes , it has the potential , over the longer-term , to steer [MISC Bosniak  ] politics in a more conservative direction , which would complicate efforts to forge the compromises among [PER Bosniaks  ] , [MISC Serbs  ] , and [MISC Croats  ] necessary to secure [LOC Bosnia  ] 's future . 
END SUMMARY . 
Protectors of [MISC Bosniak  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a time of international reluctance to engage heavily in [LOC Bosnia  ] -- coupled with [MISC Bosnian Serb  ] and [MISC Croat  ] attempts to establish maximal autonomy for themselves -- [MISC Bosniak  ] fears of isolation and abandonment have escalated . 
The perception of the risks to the [MISC Bosniak  ] community among average [PER Bosniaks  ] is genuine , grounded largely in the fact that [PER Bosniaks  ] were the most aggrieved ethnic group during the 1992-95 war and that their plight was ignored by the international community . 
Reflecting these fears , many [MISC Bosniak  ] political leaders over the past two years have campaigned on the idea that they are better able to protect [MISC Bosniak  ] interests than their rivals . 
At the same time , they have framed debate on specific policies within their [MISC Bosniak  ] constituency in existential terms . 
[MISC Bosniak  ] member of the [MISC Tri-Presidency  ] [PER Haris Silajdzic  ] has been the [MISC Bosniak  ] political leader most willing to appeal to these fears -- in fact , he has often deliberately stoked them - ) but others , including [ORG Party for Democratic Action  ] President [PER Sulejman Tihic  ] and [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] leader [PER Zlatko Lagumdzija  ] at times have also done so . 
[PER Reis Ceric  ] Helps Mold [MISC Bosniak  ] Identity -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) At the same time , the Head of the [ORG Islamic Community  ] , [PER Reis Ceric  ] , has sought to promote a [MISC Bosniak  ] political identity rooted in " victimization . 
" He has regularly reminded [PER Bosniaks  ] that they are victims of genocide and that they suffered more than any other group in the 1992-95 war . 
In a Hayat TV interview on January 11 , the [PER Reis  ] claimed that following the break-up of the [LOC Ottoman Empire  ] , [MISC Bosnian Muslims  ] had been variously subjected to " phobias " against [LOC Turkey  ] , [MISC Islam  ] , and [LOC Bosnia  ] itself . 
He also alleged that media coverage of the alleged threat of [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism in [LOC Bosnia  ] is , itself , motivated by " [MISC Islamophobic  ] " media and " is , in a way , a preparation for a new genocide on [PER Bosniaks  ] . 
" The [PER Reis  ] has , by all accounts , succumbed to the political fray , criticizing or praising [MISC Bosniak  ] leaders as he feels appropriate . 
His public comments about [MISC Bosniak  ] identity and [MISC Bosniak  ] suffering have clearly been aimed at shaping [MISC Bosniak  ] political discourse as well as the positions adopted by the country 's leading [MISC Bosniak  ] political parties. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [PER Reis  ] has also sought to define [MISC Bosniak  ] identity in religious terms and has publicly implied that to be a " good [MISC Bosniak  ] " one must be a " good [MISC Muslim  ] . 
" He has supported policies that are controversial among more secular [PER Bosniaks  ] , such as introducing religious education into kindergarten classes . 
[PER Ceric  ] has also made use of his public profile and media access to attack critics of his agenda , often implying that his position places him above criticism . 
In one [LOC SARAJEVO  ] 00000103 002.3 OF 003 interview , [PER Ceric  ] claimed that while he personally welcomed constructive criticism , criticism of [MISC Islam  ] itself was impermissible . 
( [PER Note: Ceric  ] clearly intends to be the sole judge of when criticism of him or his administration becomes a criticism of [MISC Islam  ] . 
His past responses to other critics inside and outside the [ORG Islamic Community  ] suggest as much . 
End Note . 
) " Islamophobes " are Everywhere ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Islamic Community  ] has increasingly condemned attacks against itself as anti-Islamic , and as undermining [PER Bosniaks  ] in [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
A November op-ed in the [MISC Sarajevo-based  ] daily [ORG Oslobodjenje  ] touched on some controversial projects undertaken by the [ORG Islamic Community  ] , particularly the [MISC Reis'  ] new offices -- now under construction -- which are rumored to be extremely costly . 
The article also criticized the [PER Reis  ] , as the head of the [ORG Islamic Community  ] . 
In response , the [ORG Islamic Community  ] was quick to demonize its critics and imply that their opposition made them " bad [PER Bosniaks  ] . 
" An [ORG Islamic Community  ] statement declared the paper 's stance to be , " ...nothing but a continuation of the genocidal politics designed to wipe the BiH [MISC Muslim  ] off the face of the [MISC Earth...  ] the [MISC Reis'  ] office is very much surprised by the [MISC Islamophobic  ] editorial policy of [ORG Oslobodjenje  ] . 
" ( [PER Note: Ceric  ] and the [ORG Islamic Community  ] may be using the " heavy artillery " of insinuating [MISC Islamophobia  ] to defend a weak spot , specifically , the widespread perception that his administration has been fiscally irresponsible . 
End Note . 
) [MISC Santa Claus  ] Didn't Come to [LOC Town  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Even [MISC Bosniak  ] children are not immune to political efforts to shape the [MISC Bosniak  ] identity . 
There has been a push to introduce [MISC Islamic  ] religious education in all kindergartens , a move that one respected professor ( known to be an outspoken critic of the [PER Reis  ] ) from the [ORG Faculty of Islamic Sciences  ] defined as a " crime against children . 
" Similarly , the director of [LOC Sarajevo  ] 's state-funded preschools attempted to ban [PER Djeda Mraz  ] ( [PER Grandfather Frost  ] ) in 2007 , arguing that [LOC Sarajevo  ] is predominantly [MISC Muslim  ] and that [PER Djeda Mraz  ] is not part of the [MISC Muslim  ] tradition . 
( [PER Note: Modeled  ] on [MISC Santa Claus  ] , [PER Djeda Mraz  ] emerged in [LOC Yugoslavia  ] after [MISC World War II  ] as a secular figure who gave gifts to children of all religions . 
End Note ) Secular-minded [LOC Sarajevo  ] citizens saw the snubbing of [PER Djeda Mraz  ] as an attempt to define for children what it means to be " good " [MISC Muslims  ] and organized protests and petitions against the proposed ban . 
The outrage of [LOC Sarajevo  ] citizens was best captured in the editorial comment of [ORG FTV  ] 's news program 60 Minutes . 
The show 's host , [PER Bakir Hadziomerovic  ] , characterized the director of the public institution " Children of [LOC Sarajevo  ] , " [PER Razija Mahmutovic  ] , as the fiercest opponent of [PER Djeda Mraz  ] . 
Taking on an ironic tone , [PER Hadziomerovic  ] sarcastically proposed that [PER Mahmutovic  ] introduce the figure of " [PER Santa Alija  ] , " in reference to the elder [PER Izetbegovic  ] . 
In both cases mentioned here ( early religious education and banning of [PER Djeda Mraz  ] ) , the secular position lost out . 
[ORG Popular Paper Religiously  ] Pursues [LOC Bosniak Interests  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The definition of a " good [MISC Bosniak  ] " as one who is politically and religiously conservative has also been increasingly propagated by the country 's largest-circulation , pro-Bosniak daily , [ORG Dnevni Avaz  ] . 
Over the past several months , [PER Fahrud Radoncic  ] , owner of [ORG Avaz  ] and its associated businesses , has engaged in a crusade to " protect [MISC Bosniak  ] interests , " primarily as part of an effort to undercut its opponent , the more secular [ORG Oslobodjenje  ] . 
While [ORG Avaz  ] and [ORG Oslobodjenje  ] have had a long-running rivalry centered more on business competition than ideology , [PER Radoncic  ] 's recent statements represent a clear raising of the stakes . 
In a TV interview on November 30 , [PER Radoncic  ] accused his opponents -- including a number of media outlets -- of " destroying [PER Bosniaks  ] " through attacks on , as he put it , the three key pillars of [MISC Muslim  ] faith in [LOC Bosnia:  ] the [ORG Islamic Community  ] and [PER Reis Ceric  ] ; the memory of [PER Alija Izetbegovic  ] , as personified by his son [PER Bakir  ] ; and [ORG Avaz  ] itself . 
On December 30 , [ORG Avaz  ] labeled [PER Ceric  ] a true representative of the [MISC Bosniak  ] people , adding " ...those who attack [PER Reis Ceric  ] would like to see a situation like before , when the state was appointing the [PER Reis SARAJEVO  ] 00000103 003.2 OF 003 so that he would listen to the state , thus destroying the institution of [MISC Islam  ] and the [ORG Islamic Community  ] . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Radoncic  ] has also not shied away from exploiting his position as owner to influence how [ORG Avaz  ] presents issues . 
The December 29 edition of [ORG Avaz  ] carried a front page article that slammed those who opposed the construction of a new administrative building for the [ORG Islamic Community  ] and accusing them of seeking to put the [ORG Islamic Community  ] under their political control , to diminish its power , or to destroy it . 
[ORG Avaz  ] plainly misrepresented facts related to the project , and made use of extensive purple prose in negatively characterizing opposition to the project . 
The following day , [ORG Avaz  ] continued its offensive against " the enemies of [MISC Islam  ] " with a full-page interview with [PER Enver Imamovic  ] , a professor of history at the Philosophy Faculty in [LOC Sarajevo  ] . 
[PER Imamovic  ] condemned public attacks against the [ORG Islamic Community  ] and [PER Reis Ceric  ] , declaring , " Let us not forget what the [ORG Islamic Community  ] meant to our people in the past war . 
This was the institution around which [MISC Bosniak  ] people gathered . 
" Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In an atmosphere of pessimism , created and fueled by a lack of political or economic progress in the country , insisting on the importance of being a proper [MISC Bosniak  ] is gaining momentum as a political tool . 
Lending credence to , and most likely feeding , this discourse is increasingly audacious nationalism among [MISC Bosnian Serbs  ] and , to a lesser extent , [MISC Bosnian Croats  ] . 
A growing fear of isolation appears to be providing fodder for political actors , which they can exploit to urge [PER Bosniaks  ] to rally around their leadership and agenda , which some politicians , the [PER Reis  ] and the opportunist [PER Radoncic  ] , have sought to define in conservative and more religious terms . 
Depending on how this debate plays out , [PER Bosniaks  ] politics could take an increasingly conservative political trajectory . 
The outcome of this intra-Bosniak debate will likely take considerable time to play out , but its outcome will almost certainly shape public perceptions of who is fit to lead and to speak for [PER Bosniaks  ] , an ethnic group whose sense of identity is still in flux . 
With all three sides of the ethnic divide retreating to ethnic-based politics , the prospects of compromises necessary for [LOC Bosnia  ] 's future become much dimmer .
