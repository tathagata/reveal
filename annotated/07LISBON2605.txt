End summary . 
[ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Home Affairs Informal Ministerial  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[ORG European Union Justice  ] and [ORG Home Affairs  ] ( [ORG JHA  ] ) Ministers held an informal ministerial in [LOC Lisbon  ] October 1-2 , chaired by [MISC Portuguese  ] Minister of [ORG Internal Administration  ] [PER Rui Pereira  ] and Minister for Justice [PER Alberto Costa  ] . 
Representatives from relevant [ORG EU  ] institutions , Vice President of the [ORG European Commission  ] [PER Franco Frattini  ] , and the [MISC Turkish  ] Minister for [ORG Justice Mehmet  ] [PER Ali Sahin  ] also participated . 
An embassy officer attended the proceedings to hear public statements first-hand and to engage attendees on the margins. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
As a lead-in to the meetings , on September 30 participating member states formally signed the protocol to establish the [ORG Maritime Analysis and Operations Center  ] - [ORG Narcotics  ] ( [ORG MAOC-N  ] ) . 
[LOC Portugal  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Ireland  ] , [LOC Netherlands  ] , and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] founded the center to share intelligence and coordinate counternarcotics efforts . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , though not formally a member , has liaison officers assigned to the [LOC MAOC.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Also on the agenda but in advance of the informal ministerial meetings , the [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Portuguese  ] Interior Ministers held a bilateral meeting in which they established a task force to coordinate counterterrorism investigations and prosecutions . 
[PER Pereira  ] noted that although bilateral cooperation had long existed , the task force was established to be more proactive in regard to investigations and cooperation . 
During the proceedings , [LOC Portugal  ] also signed a bilateral agreement with [LOC Malta  ] to resettle refugees in [LOC Portugal  ] that are currently resident in [LOC Malta  ] . 
[ORG Home Affairs  ] - Prevention of [MISC Terrorism  ] and [LOC Border Management  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[PER SIS/VIS: Frattini  ] and [PER Pereira  ] both noted that by [MISC Christmas  ] , all land and sea barriers in the [LOC Schengen  ] area will be removed for nine participating [LOC Schengen  ] states , [LOC Cyprus  ] having requested an extension . 
Air travel barriers , he said , would be removed in March . 
Noting that the [ORG Schengen Information System  ] ( [ORG SIS  ] ) has succeeded in its testing phase , [PER Frattini  ] suggested that the formal decision to implement the new rules will be taken in November . 
[PER Frattini  ] also suggested that the [ORG EU  ] must have an entry-exit register complete with biometric identifiers . 
This would , he opined , help manage overstays as well as be a useful data source for security services . 
Additionally , he noted that various databases and security systems need to be integrated and expanded to include travelers without visas . 
Moreover , such a [MISC European  ] surveillance system must be accessible to local law enforcement . 
An aide to [PER Frattini  ] said that this package of proposals would be submitted to the college of Commissioners in [LOC February.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[PER PNR/ETA: Frattini  ] said he would submit a terrorism package to the Commissioners November 6 that includes a proposal to establish formally an [MISC EU-wide Passenger Name Recognition  ] ( [ORG PNR  ] ) system . 
He noted that the requirements demanded by [LOC U.S.  ] negotiators convinced him that the [MISC European  ] security services should have access to the same kind of information . 
[PER Pereira  ] and [MISC German  ] Minister [PER Schauble  ] suggested that , in addition to the intelligence value , a [ORG PNR  ] system would allow the [ORG EU  ] to negotiate with the [LOC U.S.  ] on an equal footing and would allow for balanced cooperation . 
[PER Pereira  ] said he would also support a [ORG PNR  ] for intra-European flights . 
[PER Schauble  ] said further discussion on that point would be needed . 
[PER Frattini  ] and [PER Schauble  ] both noted that electronic travel authorizations ( [ORG ETA  ] ) are useful not just for improving security , but also improving the customer service at airports . 
With ever increasing crowds at airports , [PER Schauble  ] noted that it is in a traveler’s interest to participate in a voluntary [ORG ETA  ] program. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
[PER Internet: Frattini  ] will also submit a proposal to punish misuse of the internet . 
This will not , he stressed , be a limit on the freedom of expression . 
[PER Pereira  ] noted that the proposal would be limited to taking down sites that specifically incite terrorism or provide instruction in how [LOC LISBON  ] 00002605 002 OF 002 to commit terrorist acts . 
Indeed , added [PER Frattini  ] , the [ORG EU  ] already has a regulation that prohibits transfer of illegal data on the internet , without causing concerns of limitation of freedom of speech . 
This proposal , he continued , would only add the specific mention of terrorism . 
Such an update , he opined , is a good example of why the [ORG EU  ] needs regularly to review and update its bodies of law. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Conspiracy: [PER Pereira  ] noted that [MISC Italian  ] Minister [LOC Amato  ] suggested that the ministers consider developing an [ORG EU  ] agreement to incorporate conspiracy statutes into existing law . 
Current legislation is directed towards formal terrorist organizations , which does not adequately address current realities . 
[LOC Italy  ] , and a few other states , punish conspiracy without being part of a formal organization ; [PER Pereira  ] and [PER Frattini  ] each enthusiastically supported the idea that the [ORG EU  ] consider the question. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
[ORG Pruhm Treaty: Slovenian Interior Minister  ] [PER Dragutin Mate  ] suggested that , agreement being reached , it was incumbent on [LOC Slovenia  ] to develop the technical handbooks for implementation . 
[ORG Justice  ] ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10. e-Justice Portal: [PER Costa  ] issued a statement that ministers agreed that the [ORG EU  ] should have an information technology system to facilitate access to member states’ judicial systems and registry systems . 
Member states will compile best practices on IT and regularly review performance. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
Missing Children [PER Alert: Frattini  ] used the well-known case of [PER Madeleine McCann  ] , a missing [MISC British  ] girl , to lay out his intention to develop an [ORG EU  ] wide alert system for missing children . 
[PER Frattini  ] specifically and repeatedly mentioned the [ORG Amber Alert  ] system in the [LOC U.S.  ] as the model that the [ORG EU  ] needed to copy . 
In addition , the e-Justice [ORG Portal  ] , according to [PER Costa  ] , will include a list of missing children and direct users to appropriate [ORG Hague Convention  ] resources. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
Child Protection: [PER Costa  ] also noted that the ministers agreed to expand the role of the [MISC European  ] Mediator for international child abductions and to support the strengthening and implementation of laws related to child protection .
