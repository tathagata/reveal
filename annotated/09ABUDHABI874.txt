( S ) The responses in para 3 are keyed to reftel request . 
Post notes that reftel was not addressed to Embassy [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , resulting in delayed response . 
Post requests that all cables requiring action/information on [LOC UAE  ] issues be sent to Embassy [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] . 
OVERVIEW -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Structurally , the [LOC UAE  ] is a relatively open economy with the most vibrant financial sector in the [LOC Gulf  ] ; its federal structure also gives much economic autonomy to the various emirates , which impose varying levels of regulation and due diligence on economic activity . 
Characteristic of the region , the use of cash is common for legitimate financial transactions . 
High volumes of cash and electronic funds flow both to and from [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , the vast majority of which is derived from legitimate trade and remittances . 
The lack of effective border controls on cash is no doubt exploited by [MISC Taliban  ] couriers and [MISC Afghan  ] drug lords , camouflaged among traders , businessmen and migrant workers . 
Systemically approaching this issue both in the [LOC UAE  ] and in the broader [LOC Gulf  ] region to disrupt [MISC Taliban  ] finances , while protecting commerce and economic activity , is an important , though challenging task . 
At the suggestion of the [ORG UAEG  ] , we have established joint [MISC US/UAE  ] task force ( composed of interagency elements on both sides ) to combat illicit financial flows to and from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , specifically bulk cash smuggling. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Begin  ] reftel responses: <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
( C ) HOW MUCH MONEY DO EXPATS SEND BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY IN ANNUAL REMITTANCES ? 
As the [ORG UAEG  ] does not break down remittance statistics by country , it is difficult to ascertain the total value of funds transferred . 
Anecdotal information suggests some expatriates transfer as much as 50 percent of their salary , although there is significant variance . 
1 ) ( C ) BY WHAT CHANNELS ? 
HOW OFTEN ? 
Most expatriate residents -- of all nationalities -- who remit funds to their home country do so through formal exchange houses ( like [ORG Western Union  ] and its local competitors ) or informal hawala mechanisms . 
As most employees are paid monthly , workers generally transfer funds on a monthly basis . 
2 ) ( S ) DOES THE HOST GOVERNMENT MONITOR THE MONEY FLOWS ? 
IF SO , HOW ? 
The [ORG UAE Central Bank  ] maintains records of all financial transactions facilitated by banks , exchange houses and registered hawalas . 
This information includes names , addresses , phone numbers , and visa details of the sending party as well as information on the receiving party abroad . 
Similar information is required by Police and Customs officials for physical cash imports exceeded 40,000 AED ( approximately USD 10,900 ) . <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
( C ) WHAT ARE THE METHODS WHEREBY SOUTH ASIANS ARE RECRUITED AND/OR RADICALIZED BY GULF-BASED EXTREMISTS ? 
Post has limited evidence [MISC South Asian  ] expatriates are being recruited or radicalized in the [LOC UAE  ] . 
There are anecdotal reports that one [MISC Pashtun Afghan  ] community in the [LOC UAE  ] may have tribal or religious ties to the [MISC Taliban  ] . 
[LOC UAE  ] authorities are known to observe this group 's activities and occasionally disrupt gatherings. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
( U ) DESCRIBE [MISC AFGHAN  ] AND [MISC PAKISTANI  ] EXPATS AND LOCAL NATIONAL DONATIONS TO CHARITIES THAT MAY SEND MONEY TO [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] OR [LOC PAKISTAN  ] . 
Charitable giving ( " zakat " ) is one of the five pillars of [MISC Islam  ] , and , as such , is pervasive in [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
Donation jars , boxes , ATMs and pledge cards for the major [LOC UAE  ] charities ( see 1C ) are found throughout the country . 
The [ORG UAEG  ] does not directly regulate donations , but rather oversees the establishment and registration of charitable organizations , disbursal of collected funds and goods donations . 
[LOC UAE  ] charities primarily make donations abroad in the form of goods and development projects , not cash . 
1 ) ( C ) WHICH CHARITIES MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH EXTREMIST GROUPS , TERRORISTS , OR THE [MISC AFGHAN  ] OR [MISC PAKISTANI  ] GOVERNMENTS ? 
All legal charitable organizations in the [LOC UAE  ] are associated with [LOC UAE  ] government officials and entities .

There is no evidence any of these groups have ties to extremist groups . 
In fact , the [ORG UAEG  ] actively works to channel zakat from nationals and expatriates to the [ORG Red Crescent Authority  ] , whose activities and employees it monitors closely . 
2 ) ( C ) DESCRIBE EXPAT AND LOCAL NATIONAL DONATION LEVELS TO THOSE CHARITIES . 
WHICH ONES ARE MOST POPULAR ? 
WHICH ONES ARE MOST SUSPECTED OF HAVING EXTREMIST , TERRORIST , OR GOVERNMENT TIES ? 
The major [LOC UAE  ] charities receive significant cash and in-kind donations from senior ruling family members , wealthy [ORG Emirati  ] nationals and small donations from other citizens and expatriates . 
Post does not have comprehensive statistics that reveal which charities are most popular , although the three largest are the only ones authorized to disburse funds overseas . 
Ajman-based Human Appeal is suspected of ties to [ORG Hamas  ] . 
3 ) ( U ) PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON ANY CHARITIES RUN BY [MISC AFGHAN  ] AND [MISC PAKISTANI  ] EXPATS .

While it can be assumed that the [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC Afghani  ] populations in the [LOC UAE  ] represent a wide range of political views , political activism among expatriates is discouraged by [LOC UAE  ] authorities. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) WHO ARE THE KEY LEADERS WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES ?

Others , particularly those with political ties , are committed to eventually returning home to help re-build their countries , but choose to temporarily live in [LOC Dubai  ] out of concern for their families' safety. <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
( S ) PLEASE DESCRIBE ANY STEPS THE HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN OR PLANS THEY MIGHT HAVE TO MONITOR OR INFLUENCE THESE EXPAT POPULATIONS .
