( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy [LOC La Paz  ] warmly welcomes [ORG CODEL Nelson  ] to [LOC Bolivia  ] February 21 . 
Shortly after indigenous coca leader [PER Evo Morales'  ] one-year anniversary as president , [MISC Bolivians  ] find themselves again facing the social unrest that has plagued their country since 2003 , but which had subsided after [PER Morales  ] took office . 
The fourth president in as many years , [PER Morales  ] rose to power promising a " revolution " that would deliver a more inclusive society , a new constitution , nationalization of natural resources , and land reform . 
[PER Morales  ] has delivered on some of his promises , but is facing increasing difficulties governing [LOC Bolivia  ] , which he himself has exacerbated this year by condoning and even encouraging street protests against those who oppose him . 
While we support [PER Morales'  ] stated goal of social inclusion , serious questions exist about his commitment to democracy and to the rule of law--our top priorities here-- particularly given his demonstrated impatience with compromise . 
[MISC Cuban  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] advice , interference , and assistance are an additional area of concern. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary continued: Although [LOC Bolivia  ] 's macro-economic outlook remains strong in the short term , [PER Morales'  ] nationalization of hydrocarbons and the February 9 move against non-U.S. interests in the mining sector will threaten new investment . 
Trade should be key to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's future , and [MISC Congress'  ] extension of [ORG ATPDEA  ] benefits was well-received here . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has shown little real interest in a long-term trade agreement . 
On counter-narcotics , the [PER Morales  ] government 's mixed results on counter-narcotics reflect its confused strategy -- encouragement of coca cultivation ( and thus , more cocaine ) coupled with increased interdiction efforts . 
Your visit provides an opportunity to encourage [PER Morales  ] to follow a democratic path and to respect [LOC U.S.  ] mining interests ; to take counter-narcotics issues more seriously and to become a true partner in fighting the flow of illegal drugs ; and to take advantage of free trade and other opportunities , including the [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] ( [ORG MCA  ] ) . 
End summary. ---------------------------- BOLIVIA: BACKGROUND NOTES ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Landlocked [LOC Bolivia  ] is the highest and most isolated of the [MISC Latin American  ] republics . 
Once over 780,000 square miles , [LOC Bolivia  ] lost large chunks of its land to [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] , leaving it with some 424,000 square miles , roughly three times the size of [LOC Nevada  ] . 
[LOC Aymara  ] indigenous groups dominate [LOC La Paz  ] and the highlands ; the Quechuas populate the cities of [LOC Sucre  ] and [LOC Cochabamba  ] and surrounding areas . 
The rich lowlands , known as the " half-moon " states , tend to be less influenced by indigenous cultures . 
The government recognizes 38 different indigenous groups and over 60 percent of [MISC Bolivians  ] identify themselves as indigenous , making [LOC Bolivia  ] the most indigenous country in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] is a country of contrast , with a small prosperous minority of its population immersed in modern business and technology and the overwhelming poor majority still mired in poverty and living relatively unchanged by progress. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Rapidly urbanizing [LOC Bolivia  ] is the second poorest country in [LOC Latin America  ] , with poverty afflicting two-thirds of its population . 
In 2005 , its GDP was approximately USD 8.5 billion . 
Agriculture accounts for roughly 14.5 percent of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's GDP , and soybeans grown in eastern [LOC Bolivia  ] are the major cash crop . 
Extraction of minerals and hydrocarbons make up an estimated 10 percent of GDP , with manufacturing accounting for another 12 percent . 
Lack of economic opportunities has fueled mass migration to [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] , as well as rural-to-urban and western-to-eastern migration within the country. -------------- SOCIAL UNREST -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Shortly after indigenous coca leader [PER Evo Morales'  ] one-year anniversary as president , [MISC Bolivians  ] find themselves again facing the social unrest that has plagued their country since 2003 , but which had subsided after [PER Morales  ] took office . 
The fourth president in as many years , [PER Morales  ] rose to power promising a " revolution " that would deliver a more inclusive society , a new constitution , nationalization of natural resources , and land reform . 
A sharp political strategist , [PER Morales  ] has delivered on some of his promises , and has maintained high popularity rates . 
However , his first year in office has brought [PER Morales  ] to terms with the difficulties of governing [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He has exacerbated the challenge by condoning street protests against those who opposed him . 
A cocalero ambush of [MISC Bolivian  ] anti-drug forces in the [LOC Chapare  ] , a mining clash in [LOC Huanuni  ] , a 500,000-person strong demonstration in favor of regional autonomy in eastern [LOC Bolivia  ] , January riots in [LOC Cochabamba  ] , and a February 7 protest by miners in [LOC La Paz  ] have presented [PER Morales  ] with serious challenges. ----------------------- DEFENDING DEMOCRACY ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While we support [PER Morales'  ] stated goal of social inclusion , serious questions exist about his commitment to democracy and to the rule of law--our top priorities here-- particularly given his demonstrated impatience with democratic rules and compromise . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] convened a constitutional convention in August 2006 , which to date has failed to make any progress , largely due to executive branch interference and [PER Morales'  ] opposition to [MISC Bolivian  ] constitutional norms and traditions . 
Before the convention may begin its work , it must decide what vote will be required to approve constitutional changes . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has taken a hard-line approach , repeatedly refusing to compromise with the opposition . 
[PER Morales  ] has packed the [ORG Supreme Court  ] using recess appointments , instructed his party to pass a questionable land reform law and a military treaty with [LOC Venezuela  ] in a late-night senate session November 28 , and permitted violence against opposition hunger strikers , as well as the kidnapping of an opposition prefect . 
Most recently , the [ORG GOB  ] is widely thought to have instigated the January protests in [LOC Cochabamba  ] aimed at sacking an opposition prefect . 
( Despite [ORG GOB  ] denials , evidence exists that the administration paid , transported and fed armed cocaleros who were bussed to [LOC Cochabamba  ] to riot against an opposition-led local government ) . 
In addition to frequent public attacks on the opposition , [PER Morales  ] also has targeted [LOC Bolivia  ] 's prefects ( governors ) , eastern [LOC Bolivia  ] ( because it seeks regional autonomy ) , the judiciary , and the press. ---------------------------------------- ONE PLACE WHERE WE'RE NOT BIG BROTHER ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition to internal pressures , [MISC Cuban  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] advice , interference , and assistance continue to be a serious concern . 
[MISC Cuban  ] doctors and newly-inaugurated hospitals bring medical care to isolated communities . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] has agreed to purchase [MISC Bolivian  ] soy , has provided micro credit financing to small businesses , has donated tractors to [MISC Bolivian  ] farmers , and has funded community radio stations to broadcast the [ORG GOB  ] 's messages . 
Most recently , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government has agreed to buy essentially all of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's tainted beef , otherwise quarantined by an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease , as well as its industrialized coca . 
These [MISC Venezuelan  ] programs receive frequent public acclaim from [LOC Bolivia  ] 's poor . 
On the other hand , middle class [MISC Bolivians  ] resent [LOC Venezuela  ] 's growing presence and influence , and have balked at the [MISC Bolivian  ] military singing the [MISC Venezuelan  ] national anthem and depending on Venezuelan-donated helicopters to transport their president . 
[LOC Regionally  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] has strengthened ties with [LOC Chile  ] , but has alienated [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] at various points over the past year , largely because of its nationalistic but incoherent hydrocarbons policy. ----------------------------------------- NATIONALIZATION OF RESOURCES AND TRADE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although [LOC Bolivia  ] 's macro-economic outlook remains strong in the short term , [PER Morales'  ] nationalization of hydrocarbons and moves against non-U.S. interests in the mining sector ( where the bulk of [LOC U.S.  ] investments lie ) threaten new investment . 
On May 1 , 2006 , [PER Morales  ] announced [ORG GOB  ] nationalization of the hydrocarbons sector . 
Despite the presence of [MISC Bolivian  ] troops in hydrocarbons fields , the reality was less dramatic . 
Instead of a traditional nationalization , the [ORG GOB  ] required companies to sign new contracts under duress and gave [LOC Bolivia  ] 's state oil company [ORG YPFB  ] control over the entire hydrocarbons chain . 
The main impact has been to halt new investment in the sector , which [LOC Bolivia  ] needs to meet domestic demand and fulfill contractual obligations to [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
As a political measure , however , the " nationalization " remains wildly popular. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With respect to the mining sector , high-level [ORG GOB  ] officials have given repeated assurances that the [PER Morales  ] administration will respect existing [LOC U.S.  ] mining interests . 
However , the [ORG GOB  ] has reiterated threats to nationalize the mining industry , and on February 9 took over a smelter owned by [MISC Swiss  ] company [ORG Glencore  ] ( which had been sold by ex-President [PER Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  ] ) . 
We continue to urge the [ORG GOB  ] to respect existing mining concessions and to limit tax and royalty hikes. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Trade is the key to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's future . 
Congress' extension of [ORG Andean Trade Promotion  ] and [ORG Drug Eradication Act  ] ( [ORG ATPDEA  ] ) benefits was well-received here , ensuring the continuity of thousands of jobs . 
However , high-level [ORG GOB  ] officials refuse to take serious steps toward a free trade agreement , instead advocating the extension of the unilateral trade preferences . 
We have explained that " fast track " trade promotion authority expires in June , and that the new [ORG U.S. Congress  ] is not likely to extend it . 
The [PER Morales  ] administration , however , continues to want something for nothing. --------------------- COCA CASTS SHADOW --------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Morales  ] government 's mixed results on counter-narcotics reflect its confused strategy-encouragement of coca cultivation coupled with increased interdiction efforts . 
Despite the Embassy 's attempts to focus the relationship elsewhere , counter-narcotics is often the negative focal point of the bilateral relationship . 
Given President [PER Morales'  ] leadership of the [MISC Chapare-based  ] coca federations , this is not surprising . 
[ORG Morales  ] repeatedly called for " zero cocaine , not zero coca , " drawing a distinction between illegal drugs and legal use of coca leaf , which is also chewed or brewed as tea . 
It should be noted that [MISC Bolivian  ] coca production vastly exceeds licit demand , as the [ORG GOB  ] tacitly accepts , having refused to proceed with a market study funded by the [ORG EU  ] which would show just that. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Per capita rates of illegal drug use in urban [LOC Bolivia  ] approach [LOC U.S.  ] levels , confirming that [LOC Bolivia  ] is a consumer country and not merely a producer . 
[ORG Narcotics Affairs Section  ] ( NAS ) -supported demand reduction efforts focus on local and regional partners due to central government indifference . 
NAS- and [MISC DEA-supported  ] interdiction programs have been successful under the [ORG Morales  ] government . 
Comparing 2006 to 2005 , cocaine seizures were up 23 percent . 
Destruction of base labs and maceration pits were up 55 and 54 percent respectively . 
While [MISC Bolivian  ] CN forces have improved coordination and efficiency , the increased seizures are due in part to increased supply. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Anecdotal evidence suggests that coca plantings have grown dramatically since [PER Morales'  ] election , edging out other licit and less-profitable crops . 
And just as coca planting has increased , eradication is down . 
The [ORG GOB  ] achieved its goal of eradicating 5,000 hectares in 2006 , but has gotten off to a slow start in 2007 . 
The [ORG Morales  ] government has been unwilling to enforce [MISC Bolivian  ] law ( or informal agreements limiting coca cultivation ) , has stalled the launch of the licit demand study required by [MISC Bolivian  ] law , and now is considering raising legal limits from 12,000 to 20,000 hectares nationwide ( to include the [LOC Chapare  ] ) . 
This increase would place [LOC Bolivia  ] in violation of its own law and treaty obligations . 
In an attempt to justify increased coca growth , the [ORG GOB  ] has announced plans to legalize and industrialize coca for use in products such as toothpaste , demand for which is notional , at best. ---------- COMMENT ---------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Your visit presents an opportunity to further our strategy of engagement with the [ORG GOB  ] . 
We have expressed serious concerns about the [ORG Morales  ] government 's commitment to a democracy that includes separation of powers , checks and balances , an active political opposition and a free press . 
We continue to emphasize that what [ORG Morales  ] says matters as much as what he does in terms of his attacks on the [LOC United States  ] . 
On counter-narcotics , we have continued to support interdiction and eradication efforts , demand reduction programs , and capacity building , while engaging in frank discussions about the [ORG GOB  ] 's shortcomings and redirecting our support where it has greatest impact , i.e. , to interdiction . 
[PER Via USAID  ] , we're spending about $90 million annually to further social and economic inclusion of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's historically marginalized indigenous groups and to support democratic institutions and processes , including decentralized governance . 
In addition , [PER USAID  ] encourages economic growth for the poor through exports and trade , and also provides assistance in the areas of health , alternative development , and environmental protection . 
Your visit provides an additional opportunity to encourage [ORG Morales  ] to follow a democratic path and to respect [LOC U.S.  ] mining interests ; to take counter-narcotics issues seriously and to become a true partner in fighting the flow of illegal drugs ; and to take advantage of free trade and other opportunities , including the [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] ( [ORG MCA  ] ) .
