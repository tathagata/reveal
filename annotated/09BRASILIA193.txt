( C ) On February 6 , 2009 , Environment , Science and Technology , and Health ( [ORG ESTH  ] ) Counselor and Assistant Air Attache delivered the [ORG USG  ] response ( [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) to the [MISC Ukrainian  ] proposal ( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) to help the [LOC United States  ] obtain [MISC Brazilian  ] congressional approval of the 2000 [ORG U.S.-Brazil Technology Safeguards Agreement  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) . 
[MISC Ukrainian  ] Ambassador [PER Volodymyr Lakomov  ] and [PER Rustam Akhunov  ] , First Secretary , went over the matter twice to make sure they had the message right . 
By the end of the meeting , while disappointed , they clearly understood that the [ORG USG  ] did not want [LOC Ukraine  ] to seek to persuade members of the [MISC Brazilian  ] congress to support ratification of the 2000 [MISC TSA.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) NOTE . 
A dispute with a local community , called a " quilombo " composed of descendents of runaway slaves , over land at the [ORG Alcantara  ] site has led to delays in the plans of [ORG Alcantara Cyclone Space  ] ( a [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] joint venture ) to begin launches by 2011 . 
In the past , the [MISC Ukrainians  ] have suggested that the [ORG USG  ] might be responsible for stirring up the quilombo with the aim to thwart their joint venture . 
In a similar vein , at the February 6 meeting they asked whether the [ORG USG  ] was behind some buoys that had been recently discovered near [ORG Alcantara  ] that supposedly had electronic equipment in them , which could possibly be used to collect telemetry information from any space launch vehicles launched from [ORG Alcantara  ] . 
END NOTE .
