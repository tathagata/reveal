STATE 180283 [PER B. BRASILIA  ] 1045 [PER C. BRASILIA  ] 1221 [PER D. BRASILIA  ] 1069 [PER E. BRASILIA  ] 909 [PER F. BRASILIA  ] 1005 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Counselor [PER Dennis Hearne  ] , reason 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Poloff  ] delivered ref A talking points to [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations Sensitive Technologies and Disarmament Division  ] ( [ORG MRE/DDS  ] ) Deputy Director [PER Manuel Montenegro  ] , who is well versed on [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( [ORG NSG  ] ) matters . 
[LOC Montenegro  ] had participated in the recent [ORG NSG  ] plenary meeting in [LOC Sweden  ] and his comments likely reflect the thinking of his superiors within [ORG Itamaraty  ] . 
[ORG Poloff  ] also exchanged brief pleasantries with Ambassador [PER Sergio Duarte  ] , President of the 2005 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] , and his assistant [PER Jandyr Ferreira  ] dos [LOC Santos.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Responding to the [LOC Brazil  ] specific points in ref A , [LOC Montenegro  ] sought to clarify the [ORG GOB  ] position on conclusion of the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] ( [ORG AP  ] ) . 
[LOC Montenegro  ] stressed that the [ORG GOB  ] does not have any " conceptual " problem with the [ORG AP  ] and " would get there eventually , " implying a [MISC Brazilian  ] disposition to sign the protocol at some point in the future . 
However , [PER Montenegro  ] said he was certain that [LOC Brazil  ] could not complete its internal policy consideration of the issue in time to adhere to the [ORG AP  ] prior to the 2005 [ORG NPT Revcon  ] . 
In that regard , he noted that [LOC Brazil  ] 's congress had issued a " caveat " to the [ORG MRE  ] that the congress wants to see " concerted effort towards nuclear disarmament " among weapons states if it is to consider approval of the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
( [MISC Note:  ] Under [MISC Brazilian  ] law , the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] would almost certainly have to be approved by [LOC Brazil  ] 's congress , as it is a substantive addendum to an international treaty . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Responding further to ref A points , [LOC Montenegro  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] continues to oppose implementation of the [ORG AP  ] as a Condition of Supply ( [ORG COS  ] ) for trigger list transfers in the [ORG NSG  ] . 
[LOC Montenegro  ] was surprised that the [ORG USG  ] was continuing to press for the [MISC UK/Austrian  ] proposal to establish [ORG AP  ] implementation as a [ORG COS  ] since , following the [ORG NSG  ] Plenary and after [ORG GOB  ] delegation discussions with the [LOC UK  ] and [MISC Austrian  ] delegations , it was [LOC Montenegro  ] 's understanding that the [MISC UK/Austrian  ] text was " dead . 
" [LOC Montenegro  ] further said that the [ORG GOB  ] is against the use of the [ORG NSG  ] as a kind of " cheerleader for the [ORG AP  ] . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: [LOC Montenegro  ] is a candid [ORG MRE  ] specialist in non-proliferation issues , and we suspect he is offering a realistic assessment of the deliberate pace the [ORG GOB  ] will take toward the [ORG AP  ] , even as senior [MISC Brazilian  ] officials continue to indicate a disposition to eventually sign on . 
His assessment reinforces views expressed earlier this year by FM [ORG Amorim  ] and Defense Minister [PER Viegas  ] to visiting Energy Secretary [PER Abraham  ] and former [ORG NP A/S Wolf  ] ( refs E and F ) . 
The public statements in April by Science and Technology Minister [PER Campos  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] would sign the [ORG AP  ] in time for the 2005 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] now seem isolated and too optimistic . 
We believe the [ORG GOB  ] 's reservations probably continue to include: ( 1 ) reluctance to appear to bow to external pressures , from the [ORG USG  ] , [ORG IAEA  ] or in the context of the [ORG NSG  ] ; ( 2 ) concern with perceptions that the [ORG AP  ] pressure on [LOC Brazil  ] in some fashion lumps [LOC Brazil  ] in the suspect company of [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , when the [ORG GOB  ] feels [LOC Brazil  ] ought to be seen as a model citizen in non-proliferation ; ( 3 ) concern that the [ORG GOB  ] needs an " air-tight " case on the merits of the [ORG AP  ] before taking the matter to [LOC Brazil  ] 's congress , which only reluctantly ratified the [ORG NPT  ] and may renew its criticisms of a perceived lack of disarmament progress among the weapons states . 
We will continue to try to gain more clarity on the thinking within the [ORG GOB  ] on these issues .
