( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Shadow Foreign Secretary [PER William Hague  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] the [MISC Tories  ] are “more likely to win than lose” the next general election . 
High approval ratings in the polls allow the [ORG Conservative  ] Leader [PER David Cameron  ] a “latitude to maneuver” that he does not possess when the polls are running against him . 
Referring to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Hague  ] said the party “would be hard pressed to part with [ORG HMG  ] policy where [MISC British  ] troops are concerned.” [PER Hague  ] asserted that he , [PER Cameron  ] , and Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne  ] are all “children of [LOC Thatcher”  ] and staunch [MISC Atlanticists  ] but acknowledged that the network of ties once binding the [MISC British  ] public to [LOC America  ] may not be as thick for all citizens of [LOC Britain  ] . 
End summary . 
Saved by “Near [ORG Death” Experience  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER William Hague  ] and [ORG DCM  ] , accompanied by [ORG Hague’s Senior Advisor  ] [PER Arminka Helic  ] and [PER Poloff Kirsten Schulz  ] , met in [LOC Hague’s House  ] of [MISC Commons  ] office March 19 . 
[PER Hague  ] was upbeat about the [ORG Conservatives’  ] prospects , arguing that the “near death experience” of actively contemplating a snap general election last August when [PER Cameron  ] was down in the polls had forced party members and leaders to unite . 
Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] having “bottled it ( lost his nerve ) , ” after a strong [ORG Conservative Conference  ] and a well-regarded performance by [PER David Cameron  ] , had left the [MISC Tories  ] with an “internal confidence” previously lacking , said [ORG Hague.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) When the [MISC Conservatives  ] are leading in the polls as they are now , [PER Cameron  ] has more latitude to attack the Government , said [PER Hague  ] , and their proposals are taken as genuine possibilities for the future , rather than carping against the majority . 
He said the [MISC Conservatives  ] are “more likely to win than lose” the next general election which he suspects will be called in fall 2009 or spring 2010 . 
From the [ORG Conservatives’  ] point of view , added [PER Hague  ] , later was better . 
The longer [PER Brown  ] stayed in office , the more the public would tend to the view that it was time for a change and a 2010 election date would mean the [ORG Labour  ] government will have been in power for thirteen years . 
[PER Hague  ] said the state of the economy would play a role and he suspected Brown’s strategy would be to cast an economic downturn as international in nature and not the product of any of his actions . 
[PER Hague  ] said the polls showed the [MISC British  ] public is “less hostile” to the [ORG Conservative Party  ] and , while he is optimistic about [MISC Cameron’s  ] chances , said it is also likely the [MISC Conservatives  ] will come to power as a minority government . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The [ORG DCM  ] asked [PER Hague  ] how the [MISC Conservatives  ] viewed [LOC Afghanistan  ] , recognizing that [PER Cameron  ] believes policy toward that country will be at the top of his agenda . 
[PER Hague  ] said there was no great difference between the [MISC Conservatives  ] and [ORG HMG  ] when it came to foreign policy . 
There were skirmishes about the [ORG EU  ] but otherwise there was agreement . 
The [MISC Conservatives  ] , said [PER Hague  ] , “would be hard pressed to part with [ORG HMG  ] policy where [MISC British  ] troops are concerned.” Thus any criticism of current [LOC Afghanistan  ] policy would be muted . 
[PER Hague  ] said there was concern about marrying [ORG NATO  ] and political goals . 
He mused that some expert on the country suggested that , at some future date , administrative control of [LOC Kabul  ] and the [LOC North  ] would be separated from the less plausible goal of administering the [LOC South  ] , but he was not advocating such a shift at this , or any near , date . 
[ORG National Security  ] ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The [ORG DCM  ] asked [PER Hague  ] what he thought of Brown’s national security strategy , which had been released the day before . 
[PER Hague  ] said it was “more a worthy list of goals than a strategy.” Without having studied it in detail , there was little in it with which the [MISC Tories  ] would disagree , said [PER Hague  ] . 
He thought [PER Brown  ] had not gone far enough . 
The [MISC Conservatives  ] themselves are in the process of conceiving a national security strategy . 
They will call for an [ORG American-style National Security Council  ] , not just the creation of a panel of senior advisors to inform the Prime Minister . 
[PER Hague  ] added that other domestic security initiatives launched by [PER Brown  ] , like the creation of a [ORG Border Service  ] , were also thin . 
He said the [MISC Conservatives  ] wanted to stop spending money on the creation of a national identity card , for example , and use that money to build a “real border and customs police where we actually track who leaves the [LOC LONDON  ] 00000930 002 OF 002 country.” Is the Relationship Still Special ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The [ORG DCM  ] asked [PER Hague  ] whether the relationship between the [LOC UK  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] was “still special.” [PER Hague  ] said he , [PER David Cameron  ] and [PER George Osborne  ] were “children of [LOC Thatcher”  ] and staunch [MISC Atlanticists  ] . 
Speaking more broadly , [PER Hague  ] acknowledged that this was a hard question to answer . 
Politicians , in his view , “sit at the top of the pyramid” of the general public and it is unclear whether the [MISC British  ] people will maintain the network of ties to [LOC America  ] that has sustained the special relationship . 
For his part , said [PER Hague  ] , he has a sister who is [MISC American  ] , spends his own vacations in [LOC America  ] , and , like many similar to him , considers [LOC America  ] the “other country to turn to.” Asking his [ORG Senior Advisor  ] her views , [PER Helic  ] ( who is [MISC Bosnian  ] ) , said , “America is the essential country.” [PER Hague  ] said whoever enters 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister soon learns of the essential nature of the relationship with [LOC America  ] . 
He added , “we want a pro-American regime . 
We need it . 
The world needs it.” Visit London’s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/london/index. cfm Tuttle</pre></code>
