BOGOTA  ] 2409 B. STATE 81957: REPORT OF U.S.- [LOC RUSSIA  ] MANPADS EXPERTS MEETING Classified By: EUR/PRA ACTING DIRECTOR KATHELEEN MORENSKI FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
[ORG Embassies Madrid  ] and [LOC Stockholm  ] see para 6. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: In an August 3 telcon with the Secretary , [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] expressed concerns over evidence that three [MISC Swedish-origin  ] anti-tank missiles sold to [LOC Venezuela  ] were found in the possession of the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] Embassy in [LOC Bogota  ] ( [LOC Ref A  ] ) confirmed that the weapons were manufactured by [LOC Sweden  ] and sold to the [ORG Government of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GOV  ] ) in <a id='par1988' href='#par1988'>¶</a>1988 . 
This incident has been widely reported in the press , and underscores growing ties between the [ORG GOV  ] and the [ORG FARC  ] . 
The matter is of concern to the [ORG Government of Colombia  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) and to us because the weapons were diverted from [MISC Venezuelan  ] military stocks and because of other separate , compelling evidence of the [ORG GOV  ] 's support for the [ORG FARC  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has taken an aggressive , fact-based approach in addressing the [ORG GOV  ] 's support for the [ORG FARC  ] , and has requested [ORG USG  ] help in urging all nations that have completed or are contemplating arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] to take [ORG GOV  ] support for the [ORG FARC  ] into account , including reconsidering such sales . 
As current and upcoming [ORG EU  ] Presidents respectively , [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Spain  ] are well positioned to raise awareness of this incident and to urge other [ORG EU  ] members , as well as [LOC Russia  ] , to strengthen transparency and accountability in arms exports to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Background: According to [LOC Ref A  ] , the [ORG GOC  ] has seized three [MISC M-136 AT4  ] anti-tank missiles from the batch [LOC Sweden  ] sold to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] confirmed that these weapons were manufactured by [ORG Saab Bofors Dynamics of Sweden  ] and sold to [LOC Venezuela  ] in 1988 . 
Since media reports about this incident broke out in July , the [MISC Swedish  ] government has been actively working with [LOC Colombia  ] to investigate how the diversion occurred . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] Ambassador in [LOC Bogota  ] failed to get a response from the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Defense and [ORG Foreign Ministries  ] to investigate how the [MISC Swedish-origin  ] weapons ended up in the hands of [ORG FARC  ] guerillas . 
On July 29 , [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] issued a statement highlighting that [LOC Sweden  ] had asked [LOC Venezuela  ] to investigate , but the [ORG GOV  ] had not yet responded . 
After initially claiming that the story was a [MISC Colombian  ] fabrication , on August 5 [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] claimed that the missiles were stolen from a [MISC Venezuelan  ] naval base fourteen years ago ; he said [LOC Sweden  ] had " fallen into ( [MISC Colombian  ] government 's ) play " and asserted his government would not be providing [LOC Sweden  ] any further explanation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Background continued: As highlighted in [PER Uribe  ] 's July 29 statement , the [MISC Colombian  ] government is also concerned about [ORG FARC  ] interest in acquiring man-portable air defense systems ( MANPADS ) . 
Given that [LOC Russia  ] has begun delivery of sophisticated Igla-S MANPADS to [LOC Venezuela  ] , over the last several months we have engaged at high levels with [LOC Russia  ] to express our concerns over the possibility of the [ORG FARC  ] acquiring them . 
In early March , Secretary [PER Clinton  ] raised the sale with [MISC Russian  ] FM [PER Sergey Lavrov  ] , who promised that " surprise inspections " were in place to prevent unauthorized re-transfer of these systems . 
During a [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] experts meeting on MANPADS held in [LOC Washington  ] July 9-10 ( Ref B ) , the [MISC Russian  ] side promised a written response to our request for clarification of [PER Lavrov  ] 's remark . 
We have also raised with [LOC Russia  ] evidence of [MISC Russian-produced  ] assault rifle ammunition sold to [LOC Venezuela  ] and found in [ORG FARC  ] caches , and have sought an investigation . 
[ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] presented this evidence , including photographs , to [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Kislyak May  ] 28 and requested that [LOC Russia  ] look into the matter . 
On August 6 , [ORG WHA PDAS Kelly  ] raised the issue again with [MISC Russian  ] [PER DCM Darchiyev  ] , seeking an update on the [MISC Russian  ] inquiry ; [PER Darchiyev  ] said that the [MISC Russian  ] government continued to investigate and would provide an update shortly. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The recovered [MISC Russian-origin  ] ammunition in [LOC Colombia  ] , the ongoing [MISC Russian  ] sale of advanced Igla-S MANPADS to [LOC Venezuela  ] , and the latest [MISC Swedish  ] incident have all reinforced growing concerns about the risk of increasing proliferation of arms to terrorist and criminal organizations in the region . 
Part of our strategy to counter this , and to respond to the [ORG GOC  ] request , is to engage directly with countries which have or potentially could export arms to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] is the predominant arms supplier to [LOC Venezuela  ] , totaling over $5 billion last year and growing . 
However , the latest [MISC Swedish  ] incident underscores that older systems , including those supplied in the past by [ORG EU  ] countries , can end up in the wrong hands , particularly as they are displaced in [MISC Venezuelan  ] inventories by newer weapons acquired . 
To this end , the [ORG USG  ] seeks to encourage [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Spain  ] , in their capacity as the current and upcoming [ORG EU  ] Presidents respectively , to raise awareness of [MISC Venezuelan-FARC  ] ties , to strengthen accountability and t ransparency within the [ORG EU  ] over arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] given these recent reports of diversions , and to take action in multilateral export control regimes . 
As appropriate , we will seek to keep the [ORG GOC  ] apprised of our efforts .
