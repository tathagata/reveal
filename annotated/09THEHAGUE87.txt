( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: In response to questions regarding its possible licensing of [ORG LNG  ] technology to [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG Royal Philips Electronics  ] emphasized that it has no activities whatsoever in the [ORG LNG  ] field , especially not in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Philips  ] does export some lighting , consumer electronics , and medical equipment to [LOC Iran  ] , but always in accordance with international export control laws . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Econoff met January 28 with Mr. [PER Guy Kerpen  ] , Director of Government Relations , and Mr. [PER Wolter Boerman  ] , Vice President of [ORG Corporate Export Controls  ] and [ORG Supply Chain Security  ] , at [ORG Royal Philips Electronics  ] . 
Per Ref A request , Econoff sought information about [ORG Philips'  ] possible provision to [LOC Iran  ] of licensing for [ORG LNG  ] projects . 
The [ORG Philips  ] representatives said the company had no activities whatsoever in [ORG LNG  ] or energy production in general , let alone with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Boerman  ] said he had reviewed [ORG Philips'  ] historical records to confirm the company had never been involved in researching , developing , producing , or marketing any type of [ORG LNG  ] technology . 
He also contacted [ORG Philips'  ] office in [LOC Dubai  ] to confirm that it had never discussed conducting LNG-related activities with [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unlike [ORG Royal Dutch Shell  ] , which does maintain investments in [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector ( ref B ) , [ORG Philips  ] manufactures lighting , healthcare products , and consumer electronics . 
Its only business with [LOC Iran  ] , according to [PER Kerpen  ] and [PER Boerman  ] , is the sale of products such as coffee makers , electric razors , lamps , and light bulbs . 
[ORG Philips  ] also sells some medical equipment to [LOC Iran  ] ; these are the only products for which [ORG Philips  ] routinely applies for [LOC U.S.  ] licenses . 
[PER Boerman  ] explained that over 55 percent of [ORG Philips'  ] assets are based in the [LOC United States  ] , and the company therefore takes compliance with [LOC U.S.  ] export regulations regarding [LOC Iran  ] very seriously . 
Although the [LOC U.S.  ] government requires exporters to acquire a license if more than 10 percent of the medical equipment 's content is produced in the [LOC United States  ] , [ORG Philips  ] acquires a license for any of its products with more than 2 percent of [LOC U.S.  ] content - just to be safe. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kerpen  ] and [PER Boerman  ] expressed dismay at the [LOC U.S.  ] government 's suggestion that [ORG Philips  ] had any involvement in [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector and asked where we had obtained such information . 
They stressed [ORG Philips'  ] interest in correcting any misinformation in the national measures campaign of the [ORG E4+1  ] governments ( ref A ) . 
[ORG Philips  ] takes its international reputation extremely seriously and carefully follows all [ORG UN  ] , [ORG EU  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] , and other international obligations related to doing business in restricted countries . 
The company recognizes the public relations damage that accusations of improper dealings can cause ; hence its dismay at the [ORG USG  ] 's questions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Per Department guidance ( ref C ) , Econoff explained that during the course of discussions with our [ORG E4+1  ] partners , one of them had advised that [ORG Philips  ] might be involved in licensing [ORG LNG  ] technology to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Econoff assured [ORG Philips  ] that the [ORG USG  ] would relay its response to our partners in order to correct the error .
