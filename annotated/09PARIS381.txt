END SUMMARY . 
[MISC French  ] Approach to Detainee Reintegration ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC France  ] accepted four former detainees with claims to immigration status in [LOC France  ] in July 2004 and an additional three in March 2005 . 
In a March 10 meeting with [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] contacts [PER Christophe Chaboud  ] , [PER Phillippe Hanin  ] and [PER Francois Thuillier  ] , and [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] official [PER Philippe Tran Van  ] , [PER Chaboud  ] noted that , unlike the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Albania  ] , the majority of detainees repatriated by [LOC France  ] are still considered a security risk and are treated as such . 
Of the seven detainees originally repatriated , only [PER Mustaq Ali Patel  ] was released without prejudice . 
[PER Chaboud  ] explained that [PER Patel  ] was a religious fundamentalist who had been held by the [ORG Taliban  ] and was not deemed to be a threat . 
The six other former detainees were held in custody and tried . 
Five were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to one and half years . 
[PER Chaboud  ] explained that while all six of the detainees were considered extremists , only five had trained in terrorist training camps . 
An appeals court overturned the conviction of the five on February 24 , saying the security services who interviewed the defendants at [LOC GITMO  ] did not have the legal authority to do so . 
Although the court case is ongoing and it is unclear if the reversal will stand , the [MISC French  ] security services will continue to monitor the former detainees regardless of the final outcome of the legal battle . 
The [MISC French  ] intelligence service explained that they actively monitor the repatriated detainees . 
[PER Philippe Hanin  ] said that [LOC France  ] still considers the six former detainees a security risk . 
When pressed , [PER Hanin  ] added that the detainee of greatest concern is [PER Brahim Yadel  ] , whose history of large wire transfers has worried investigators ( [PER Yadel  ] was also suspected of plotting to attack the 1998 football [MISC World Cup  ] in [LOC France  ] ) . 
[ORG EU  ] Common Position: Still in Process ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC French  ] MFA DAS-equivalent for security affairs [PER Martin Juillard  ] and [PER Laurent Pic  ] of Prime Minister [PER Fillon  ] 's office clarified the evolving [ORG EU  ] approach to a common position for accepting [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees . 
While an [ORG EU  ] common position has still not been established , [LOC France  ] has been working with [ORG EU  ] partners since January 2009 to formulate a position that would take into consideration security issues , especially for [LOC Schengen  ] countries ( reftel ) . 
[PER Pic  ] noted that previous [ORG EU  ] acceptance of [MISC Palestinians  ] from the Church of the Nativity in [LOC Bethlehem  ] ( reftel ) could serve as a useful precedent for granting residency permits within the [LOC Schengen  ] system . 
[PER Pic  ] added that the discussions within the [ORG EU  ] are still quite difficult ; the [MISC French  ] are looking for ways to put in place a procedure for accepting detainees while not pressuring countries that are unwilling to resettle them. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Juillard  ] explained that an [ORG EU  ] common position would be of " clear interest " to the [ORG USG  ] to avoid " cherry picking " by [ORG EU  ] countries willing to accept detainees as well as creating a more fluid process for moving detainees . 
That said , [PER Pic  ] noted that there were some [ORG EU  ] members -- unspecified -- still resistant to the idea of accepting detainees . 
For this reason the [ORG GOF  ] would appreciate as much [LOC PARIS  ] 00000381 002.2 OF 002 information as possible from the [ORG USG  ] to help push the issue within the [ORG EU  ] and to secure [MISC French  ] public support . 
Some of the [ORG EU  ] debate over a common position , [PER Juillard  ] said , needed to focus on forming some procedures to create contingency plans when a detainee 's first choice of accepting country is refused by that country . 
Perhaps , he suggested , the [ORG GOF  ] , [ORG EU  ] and [ORG USG  ] could work together collectively to craft a mechanism for other [ORG EU  ] countries to help fill the void . 
[PER Juillard  ] and [PER Pic  ] noted that the idea of a clearing house ( reftel ) as part of a common position was intended to provide a data-sharing mechanism rather than as a forum for collective decision-making , which the [MISC French  ] believe would hinder the decision-making process . 
Increased Coordination and Additional Issues -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Juillard  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] needed to know the status of the [ORG USG  ] 's review process . 
He noted that since Prime Minister [PER Fillon  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] announced that [LOC France  ] would consider accepting detainees ( reftel ) , [MISC French  ] public opinion has continued to sour . 
[LOC France  ] realizes that the issue will be a tough sell to the [MISC French  ] public , so any help the [LOC U.S.  ] can provide to assist the [ORG GOF  ] with selling the idea to the [MISC French  ] public would be greatly appreciated . 
Another " sensitive " concern for the [MISC French  ] is the possibility of extradition of former [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detainees as well as prosecutions and detentions , [PER Juillard  ] said . 
In addition , the [MISC French  ] would like to have more information on reintegration procedures so that detainees did not resume terrorist activities . 
Such procedures could be legal and financial . 
Before [LOC France  ] could consider accepting detainees , the [ORG GOF  ] would like to interview the detainees in such a way that would " not cause " legal problems , [PER Juillard  ] said . 
[PER Pic  ] said [LOC France  ] and the [ORG EU  ] hope many of these issues will be resolved during the mid-March meetings in [LOC Washington  ] with [ORG EU  ] Vice President [PER Jacques Barrot  ] and [MISC Czech  ] Minister of [ORG Interior Langer  ] .
