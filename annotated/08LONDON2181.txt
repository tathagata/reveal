<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC LONDON  ] 002181 NOFORN SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/WE , SCA/A ; [ORG NSC  ] FOR [ORG BRADLEY  ] EO 12958 DECL: 08/22/2018 TAGS PREL , MARR , PTER , [LOC AF  ] , [LOC UK  ] SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN: [PER BROWN  ] URGES [PER KARZAI  ] TO KEEP HELMAND GOVERNOR ; PRAISES UNSYG REP Classified By: Political Minister Counselor [PER Greg Berry  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) During what was described by [ORG FCO Afghanistan Desk  ] Officer [PER Tom Burns  ] as a mainly “morale boosting” trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] on August 21 , Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] met with [LOC UK  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] military commanders and Governor [PER Mangal  ] in [LOC Helmand  ] , and with President [PER Karzai  ] and UNSYG Special Representative [PER Kai Eide  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
[PER Mangal  ] confided to [PER Brown  ] , who was accompanied by [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor Simon McDonald  ] , that he was worried about job security given that others close to [PER Karzai  ] , including former [LOC Helmand  ] governor [PER Sher Muhammed Akhunzada  ] , were plotting against him and encouraging [PER Karzai  ] to replace him with [PER Akhunzada  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] said that in [LOC Kabul  ] [PER Brown  ] took up [ORG Mangal’s  ] cause , telling [PER Karzai  ] that [PER Mangal  ] enjoyed the UK’s confidence and that [PER Akhunzada  ] was not an acceptable alternative , given his history of corruption and involvement in drug trafficking . 
[LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Sherard Cowper-Cowles  ] will continue to push [ORG Mangal’s  ] case with [PER Karzai.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Brown  ] reportedly emphasized to [PER Karzai  ] that the security assessments he had received from [MISC British  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] commanders in [LOC Helmand  ] were more positive in tone than those [PER Karzai  ] may have been receiving from his political advisors . 
The general view from the military in [LOC Helmand  ] , [PER Brown  ] told [PER Karzai  ] , was that security overall in the province was improving , but that major roads were still very dangerous given the increase in insurgent use of [MISC IEDs  ] and suicide bombers . 
[PER Karzai  ] and [PER Brown  ] spent a significant portion of their meeting talking about the situation in [LOC Pakistan  ] and the September 6 presidential elections . 
[PER Karzai  ] is reportedly “warm” on PPP leader [PER Zardari  ] but encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] to “open channels” to [ORG PML  ] leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] averred that given the increase in [LOC AQ  ] training activity on the [LOC Pakistan  ] side of the border , [LOC Pakistan  ] is actually a more violent country than [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Meeting with UNSYG Representative [PER Eide  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Brown  ] spent an hour with UNSYG Special Representative [PER Kai Eide  ] , who expressed concern over slow progress on the security situation , which was impeding development , particularly in the south , and the lack of [MISC Afghan  ] capacity to absorb what aid was getting through . 
He was also worried about diminishing support for [PER Karzai  ] in the government and population in general , and complained that [PER Karzai  ] was incapable of making the “tough decisions.” [PER Eide  ] suggested that he , [PER Cowper-Cowles  ] and Ambassador [PER Wood  ] work together to keep the pressure on [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER Eide  ] also cautioned against working too closely and directly with tribal leaders , as this may undermine Karzai/central government authority and credibility . 
[PER Brown  ] praised the coordinating work [PER Eide  ] had undertaken thus far , and pledged continued [LOC UK  ] support for his mission . 
[ORG Cabinet Office Readout  ] ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) In a subsequent conversation with the [ORG Cabinet Office’s  ] [MISC Afghan  ] Officer [PER Helen Evans  ] , she echoed the [ORG FCO  ] readout , but stressed that the Prime Minister’s statements while on the ground about the [LOC UK  ] commitment to support [ORG ANA  ] training were “a general statement of intent” not a specific pledge of additional [LOC UK  ] military and financial resources at this time . 
[PER Brown  ] received a useful briefing from the [MISC AFSouth  ] commander , who gave the PM a “half-glass full , half empty , ” overview of the situation , according to [PER Evans  ] . 
The commander described how security is improving in the region overall , but the lack of security along transport routes makes it difficult to build on the security improvements . 
[PER Brown  ] also heard from several interlocutors that the road security situation could affect the ability to hold credible elections. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) Brown’s traveling party was struck by UNSYG Eide’s downbeat assessment of the [MISC Afghan  ] leadership , including [PER Karzai  ] , according to [PER Evans  ] . 
[PER Eide  ] raised whether the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] Governments should be working to find a new chief of staff for [PER Karzai  ] , an issue that [PER Brown  ] later took up with the [LOC UK  ] Embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
[PER Eide  ] also raised with [PER Brown  ] concerns about the humanitarian situation developing as a result of the current drought , which has affected nearly all of the country .
