End Summary . 
Six New Detainee Files: Potential Impact of [LOC U.S.  ] Decisions --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER S/E Fried  ] introduced the dossiers of six detainees that the [LOC U.S.  ] would like [LOC France  ] to consider taking , pointing out that several of them have court-ordered releases and noting that we have presented some of the cases to other [MISC European  ] governments . 
[PER Chevallier  ] expressed appreciation for the new information and assured [PER Fried  ] that , following the [MISC Obama-Sarkozy  ] meeting in June and the resettlement in May of [MISC Algerian  ] [PER Lakdar Boumediene  ] , [LOC France  ] will look at the files in a positive light . 
However , speaking on instruction , he cautioned that [LOC France  ] will not be able to provide an answer until more is known about the attitude of [ORG Congress  ] toward accepting some of the detainees on [LOC U.S.  ] soil . 
A positive decision by [ORG Congress  ] , [PER Chevallier  ] continued , would boost the prospects for selling detainee resettlement to the [MISC French  ] public and to other [MISC European  ] countries . 
When pressed by [PER Fried  ] , [PER Chevallier  ] responded that the congressional decision is not a " pre-condition , " but also said " it is not far from that . 
" He emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] decision " is part of [LOC France  ] , s political assessment " and " is extremely important " to [LOC France  ] , s final decision . 
At the same time , [PER Chevallier  ] confirmed that [LOC France  ] would not intervene negatively in [LOC U.S.  ] discussions with other countries , for example , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and [LOC Portugal  ] , that are moving ahead with resettlement . 
In closing discussions on the files , [PER Fried  ] suggested [MISC French  ] officials visit [ORG Guantanamo  ] to interview the detainees and talk to the defense lawyers to inform their decision and aid in the selection of future candidates and to make any requests for further information through intelligence liaison . 
Request to Share [PER Boumediene  ] 's File with [ORG Schengen Partners  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Chevallier  ] confirmed that [ORG Schengen  ] partner states now have to share the files of detainees with their [ORG Schengen  ] partners per the agreed [ORG EU  ] framework . 
If no state opposes , a [ORG Schengen  ] visa will be issued ; however , if one or more partner states oppose , then only a national visa can be granted . 
Refusal to grant a [ORG Schengen  ] visa would also have an impact on the social services and type of residence status offered to former detainees . 
[PER Chevallier  ] would like [PER Boumediene  ] to be the first test case , as he is a lower risk detainee . 
[PER Fried  ] agreed to provide a revised file that can be shared with [ORG EU  ] partners . 
[PER Chevallier  ] regretted the [ORG EU  ] decision to put this issue under the purview of Interior Ministers , saying it would have been easier to manage under Foreign Ministers . 
[PER Fried  ] concluded his discussion with [PER Chevallier  ] by noting that [LOC U.S.  ] procedures in detainee transfers have changed somewhat . 
New congressional legislation now requires notification of transfer 15 days in advance and notification of the transfer arrangements . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] plans to meet this requirement in the future through an exchange of diplomatic notes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Chevallier  ] , s expert on this issue , [PER Martin Julliard  ] , asked about the financial payments the [LOC U.S.  ] is [LOC PARIS  ] 00000933 002.2 OF 002 providing to [LOC Bermuda  ] and [LOC Palau  ] upon their acceptance of the [MISC Uighur  ] detainees . 
[PER Fried  ] clarified that [LOC U.S.  ] funds are intended to cover reimbursable expenses only and are minimal . 
[PER Julliard  ] said that his office has been monitoring [MISC French  ] public opinion on the resettlement of [PER Boumediene  ] and cited the use of tax money for detainee resettlement as one of the top three concerns . 
[PER Fried  ] made no commitment , but said he would be willing to discuss this further if it becomes necessary symbolically for [LOC France.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Comment: [MISC French  ] authorities remain proud of their lead role in opening the way to resettlement of some detainees in [LOC Europe  ] and are committed to looking favorably at the six new detainee files . 
However , a [LOC U.S.  ] decision to accept or reject taking detainees on [LOC U.S.  ] soil is clearly part of the calculation as they also assess [MISC French  ] domestic reaction to resettlement .
