<code><pre>S E C R E T KHARTOUM 000249 NOFORN DEPARTMENT FOR [MISC AF A A/S  ] CARTER , AF/SPG , [LOC NEA/IPA  ] , [LOC ISN/CATR  ] , [ORG NSC  ] FOR MGAVIN AND CHUDSON EO 12958 DECL: 02/24/2019 TAGS ETTC , MASS , PARM , PGOV , PREL , [PER SU SUBJECT:  ] [LOC SUDAN  ] COMPLAINS OF “PROBABLY AMERICAN” BOMBING ATTACKS IN [ORG EASTERN SUDAN  ] REF: [PER A. KHARTOUM  ] 120 [PER B. KHARTOUM  ] 107 [PER C. KHARTOUM  ] 82 [PER D. KHARTOUM  ] 59 Classified By: [ORG CDA Alberto M. Fernandez  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG CDA Fernandez  ] was summoned to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] on the morning of February 24 by [ORG Americas Department  ] head Ambassador [PER Nasreddin Wali  ] . 
[PER Wali  ] said that he had sensitive and worrisome information to relate to the Charge . 
Reading from hand-written notes in [MISC Arabic  ] and referring to a large dog-eared map brought in for the occasion , [PER Wali  ] said that there had been two air attacks on [MISC Eastern Sudan  ] in January and February . 
In the January attack , 43 people were killed and 17 vehicles destroyed . 
This occurred near [LOC Magd  ] , in the [LOC Gebeit  ] region of [LOC Red Sea  ] state , “the [MISC Northern  ] part of an area known as [PER Oku”  ] ( phonetic ) . 
It is roughly at the latitude of 17 degrees and longitude of 33.5 , according to [LOC Wali.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The second attack occurred on February 20 at [LOC Bir al-Mansurab  ] ( latitude of 17 degrees and longitude of 34 , according to [PER Wali  ] ) . 
The second attack was 15 kilometers from the site of the January attack . 
In the February attack , 45 [MISC Sudanese  ] were kalled and 14 vehicles destroyed . 
Both attacks occurred 150 kilometers deep inside [LOC Sudan  ] , not near any international border. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Wali  ] said that “we assume that the planes that attacked us are your planes.” He said that [LOC Sudan  ] has had “tight cooperation” with the [LOC United States  ] on security matters and any concerns that the [ORG USG  ] has about security related issues can be raised within the context of bilateral diplomatic and intelligence relations between the two countries . 
He added that “Sudan would like to have clarification about this matter . 
We protest this act and we condemn it . 
[LOC Sudan  ] reserves the right to respond appropriately , at the right time , in a legal manner consistent with protecting its sovereignty.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: This complaint by [LOC Sudan  ] comes on the heels of the [ORG Embassy  ] being tasked by [LOC Washington  ] to demarche [LOC Khartoum  ] on weapons smuggling issues possibly involving [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] ( reftels a-c ) . 
So it is easy for the regime to assume that the demarches and these kinetic incidents are somehow connected . 
The initial attack is already the object of gossip by elements of [LOC Sudan’s  ] political elite , even outside the tight confines of the regime’s inner circle ( reftel d ) . 
[ORG CDA  ] had already scheduled an [ORG Emergency Action Committee  ] meeting on February 24 to discuss the [MISC Embassy’s  ] security posture in the runup to the March 4 [ORG ICC  ] announcement and this latest news is an additional concern in a very volatile political environment . 
[ORG Embassy  ] requests [LOC Washington  ] guidance on what - if any - formal response should be given to the [MISC Sudanese  ] . 
And should this potentially explosive story somehow leak to the sensationalistic [MISC Sudanese  ] press , it could very well turn our security situation here from bad to worse . 
End comment .
