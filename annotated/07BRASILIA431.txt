( C ) Summary . 
U/S [PER Burns  ] and [ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] , in [LOC Brasilia  ] for strategic dialogue talks with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) , joined with Ambassador , PolCounselor and [MISC S/P  ] officer [PER William McIlhenny  ] to meet on February 7 with [MISC Marco  ] [PER Aurelio Garcia  ] , President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's international affairs advisor . 
[PER Garcia  ] was accompanied by his senior deputy , [PER Marcel Biato  ] . 
U/S [PER Burns  ] provided an overview of the transition in [LOC USG  ] global strategy toward focus on building relations with regional powers like [LOC Brazil  ] , and noted the importance of collaboration on bio-fuels to this relationship . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] views on developments in the region and [LOC Cuba  ] also were focal points of the discussion . 
In the region , [PER Garcia  ] said there is a consensus on integration among disparate but democratically elected governments that facilitates communication and limits conflict . 
[LOC Brazil  ] does not admire [PER Hugo Chavez  ] 's political model , but needs to pursue good relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] as part of a foreign policy driven by [LOC Brazil  ] 's vital interests and domestic economic priorities . 
In [LOC Cuba  ] , it is clear [PER Fidel  ] is fading rapidly and permanently , but transition scenarios are hard to predict . 
The largest step the [LOC U.S.  ] could take to encourage a peaceful transition to democracy would be elimination of sanctions , [PER Garcia  ] said . 
End summary . 
THE REGION <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) U/S [PER Burns  ] outlined for [PER Garcia  ] the ongoing shift in [LOC USG  ] strategic focus away from a [LOC Europe  ] and toward increased engagement with major and emerging regional powers , including [LOC Brazil  ] . 
U.S.-Brazil cooperation in [LOC Haiti  ] and the promising bilateral collaboration on bio-fuels are building blocks for this enhanced relationship . 
The [LOC USG  ] also values [MISC Brazilian  ] insights on regional affairs . 
In that context , [PER U/S Burns  ] invited [PER Garcia  ] to share his views on developments in the region , especially in [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] -- all countries [PER Garcia  ] has visited frequently as [PER Lula  ] 's special envoy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said [LOC South America  ] has been undergoing a major transformation in the past several years , with democratically elected governments seeking economic recovery and growth , while also addressing grave social problems . 
There has been at least a general consensus in the region on the importance of integration , and that has permitted countries with disparate political situations and ethnic cultures to work together on many issues . 
While there is still conflict , communication is more the norm , [PER Garcia  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] has worked to maintain a positive dialogue , focusing on points of convergence , e.g. , joint projects in infrastructure and energy . 
On the political level , " We do not agree with [PER Chavez  ] 's path , and it is not the one we chose , " [PER Garcia  ] declared , echoing a similar statement made by [PER FM Amorim  ] in a meeting with [PER U/S Burns  ] earlier in the day . 
That said , [PER Garcia  ] said it needs to be recognized that " [PER Chavez  ] is a product of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's crisis , not its cause . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's relationship with [LOC Argentina  ] is " strategic , " and is analogous in some ways to the [MISC Franco-German  ] relationship in [LOC Europe  ] -- i.e. , sometimes tense , but crucial for regional stability and progress . 
Relations with [LOC Chile  ] are similarly important and growing , [PER Garcia  ] said , as are [LOC Brazil  ] 's relations with [LOC Colombia  ] . 
Indeed , [LOC Brazil  ] is practicing " variable geometry diplomacy " in the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000431 002 OF 002 region , adjusting and shifting constantly to build and exploit opportunities in a foreign policy that is still mainly driven by domestic priorities , he added . 
[LOC CUBA  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Garcia  ] noted that his deputy advisor , [PER Marcel Biato  ] , had just returned from five months as [LOC Brazil  ] 's charge d'affaires in [LOC Havana  ] , and his views were incorporated in [PER Garcia  ] 's perspective . 
[PER Garcia  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] believes it is highly unlikely [PER Fidel Castro  ] will ever return to exercise real power . 
The waning of [PER Fidel  ] over the past year had caused the [MISC Cuban  ] population to begin contemplating a different future , but everyone has difficulty imagining what that future will look like , [PER Garcia  ] said . 
[LOC Cuba  ] , in the past forty years , had a system built on a single charismatic figure , and that is not sustainable . 
[PER Raul Castro  ] is not his brother and seems more inclined to take a committee approach to leadership that is pragmatic , at least on economic issues . 
[PER Garcia  ] was doubtful [LOC Cuba  ] can replicate the " [LOC China  ] model " with economic opening but continued centralized political control . 
" [LOC China  ] is a civilization , [LOC Cuba  ] is not... they do not have the patience , resources or organization " to emulate [LOC China  ] 's approach , " he opined . 
Moreover , [LOC Cuba  ] today lacks an " economic vocation , " and has not been able to place its tourism industry , its medical capacity or its bare handful of other productive sectors into a strategy for productivity or increased self reliance . 
[LOC Brazil  ] wants to help , and is offering to provide both assistance and markets for [LOC Cuba  ] , but the [MISC Cubans  ] have to define a direction for themselves , [PER Garcia  ] said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Asked by U/S [PER Burns  ] about [LOC Brazil  ] 's views on [PER Chavez  ] 's role in [LOC Cuba  ] 's transition , [PER Garcia  ] said that [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] in the near term are mutually dependent ( i.e. , " oil exchanged for expertise " ) , but [PER Fidel  ] 's passing will leave a vacuum [PER Chavez  ] will try to fill . 
However , [PER Chavez  ] 's brand of strident populism " has less space to grow in [LOC Latin America  ] than you may think , " [PER Garcia  ] said , and could be curtailed if [MISC Cubans  ] perceived other openings -- especially if the [LOC U.S.  ] lifted sanctions on their economy . 
This would be the single biggest step the [LOC U.S.  ] could take in easing the transition in [LOC Cuba  ] toward a positive direction , [PER Garcia  ] opined . 
Conversely , the [LOC U.S.  ] needs to avoid public recommendations to [MISC Cubans  ] about their political future , since [MISC Cubans'  ] traditional nationalism and sensitivity to [LOC U.S.  ] influence assure negative reactions. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Shannon  ] said the [LOC United States  ] has tried to assume a careful , low-key position in public on the [MISC Cuban  ] transition , but the [LOC U.S.  ] believes that others in the region need to speak out for democracy there . 
If a transitional government could take certain concrete steps -- e.g. , release of political prisoners -- the positive reaction within the [LOC U.S.  ] would be considerable . 
But someone other than the [LOC U.S.  ] must pressure [MISC Cuban  ] leaders toward such actions , he said .
