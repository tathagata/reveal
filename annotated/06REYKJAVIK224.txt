( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post discussed points from refs A and B with [MISC Icelandic  ] Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs Human Rights  ] Officer [PER Ingibjorg Davidsdottir  ] June 14 and 19 , respectively . 
Following consultation with the [ORG MFA PermSec  ] and the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Mission  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] , [PER Davidsdottir  ] replied as follows: -- [LOC Iceland  ] will vote against any motion to adjourn the June 20-21 29th [ORG International Conference  ] of the [ORG Red Cross  ] and [ORG Red Crescent  ] . 
-- The [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation in [LOC Geneva  ] is prepared to vote in favor of the proposed amendments to the Statutes of the [ORG International Red Cross  ] and [ORG Red Crescent Movement  ] should we be unable to approve the amendments by consensus . 
-- The [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MFA  ] has explained the importance of the red crystal issue to its [ORG National Society  ] counterparts - who agreed wholeheartedly . 
-- A representative of the [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation will be present as much as possible during the [ORG Conference  ] . 
-- The [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Mission  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] is in close contact and cooperation especially with the other [MISC Nordic  ] countries' and [ORG European Union  ] 's missions in [LOC Geneva  ] on this issue . 
-- Should the [ORG Organization of the Islamic Conference  ] try to steer debate in a political direction , [LOC Iceland  ] will deliver a statement along the lines the [LOC U.S.  ] requests if/if its [MISC European  ] neighbors are doing the same. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [LOC Iceland  ] is safely in our corner but will not strike any direct blows absent [MISC Nordic/European  ] cover . 
Such caution is characteristic of [MISC Icelandic  ] conduct in international organizations and especially unsurprising with new Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] only in office since June 15 .
