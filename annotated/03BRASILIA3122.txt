( U ) SUMMARY: The [ORG GoB  ] has taken its latest step in laying the legal groundwork necessary to import copied versions of patented pharmaceuticals . 
President [PER Lula  ] signed a decree on September 4 revising the implementation of [ORG Article  ] 71 of [LOC Brazil  ] 's 1996 patent law , which governs the granting of compulsory licenses in cases of national emergency or public interest . 
This decree ratchets up the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] 's bargaining power in its continuing negotiations with three drug companies over the prices of their [MISC AIDS  ] antiretroviral medicines ( reftel ) . 
The decree quickly followed the conclusion of the [ORG WTO  ] agreement on access to medicines . 
While it is unclear whether the revisions to [ORG Article  ] 71 implementation legislation are TRIPS-compliant or even consistent with [LOC Brazil  ] 's own [MISC Constitution  ] , the [ORG GoB  ] believes it now has considerably more room to maneuver in cases of public urgency . 
The decree and the [ORG Health Ministry  ] 's dwindling stocks of the drugs in question indicate to us that the [ORG GoB  ] is prepared to issue compulsory licenses and import if price negotiations are not concluded to its satisfaction . 
Translated text of the decree from the [ORG State Department Translation Service  ] is provided below ( paragraph 16 ) . 
END SUMMARY . 
The Revisions and What They Mean -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The most significant revision , in [ORG Article  ] 10 of the decree , allows for the importation of the object of the compulsory license when it is not possible to address national emergency or public interest situations with a product on the domestic market , or when production by the [ORG State  ] or a third party is not feasible . 
The previous language of [ORG Article  ] 10 allowed for this circumstance " provided that the product has been placed on the market directly by the owner or by consent of the owner , " implying that consent by the patent owner was necessary before such ( presumably parallel ) importation could occur . 
The replacement language of the new decree does not specify that any action by the patent holder is required . 
Pharmaceutical companies interpret this fact as giving the green light for imports without the patent holder 's consent , permitting entry of knock-offs from countries where there is no patent. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) An additional paragraph under [ORG Article  ] 10 states that the Union is obliged to acquire the product placed on the market by the owner or with the owner 's consent ( e.g. parallel imports ) , as long as that procedure does not frustrate the purposes of the license . 
In essence , it would seem that the [ORG State  ] can now choose the desired product source by merely alleging the patent owner is thwarting the purpose of the compulsory license , e.g. , by not lowering prices. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The new decree also deletes language in the previous version regarding the public bid process that was to govern the contracting of third parties to work compulsory licenses . 
The public bid procedures outlined in a 1993 law are no longer to apply . 
A new paragraph states that patents under compulsory license shall be worked by third parties in compliance with the principles of [ORG Article  ] 37 of the [MISC Constitution  ] and other applicable legal standards . 
[ORG Article  ] 37 of the [MISC Constitution  ] deals with public administration in general , and would impose more relaxed standards on the public bid process than those outlined in the 1993 law. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Revisions of [ORG Article  ] 5 clarify that the patent holder may be obliged to provide sufficient information to enable the reproduction of the object of the compulsory license . 
The significant alteration in this article under the new decree is the threat of nullification of the patent should the transfer of know-how not be forthcoming. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ministry of Health  ] , in its announcement of the decree , characterized the measure as a legal instrument by which the [MISC Brazilian  ] government can import copies in cases of national emergency or public interest without the necessity of the patent holder 's consent . 
In particular , the decree would allow importation of copies of the three [MISC AIDS  ] anti-retrovirals that are currently the subject of price negotiations , should the government pursue compulsory licenses . 
While MoH officials from the [ORG International Affairs  ] office declined to comment on the ongoing negotiations with the three pharmaceutical companies ( reftel ) in a September 4 meeting with [MISC Econoffs  ] , they portrayed the issue as a question of life and death for [MISC AIDS  ] patients and thus also a political requirement for the [MISC GoB.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Although the [ORG MoH  ] 's budget allocation decisions did not enter into the conversation with [MISC Econoffs  ] , press accounts of the negotiations with pharmaceutical firms typically cite the [ORG Ministry 's  ] overburdened budget . 
While seeking to lower costs of medicines in its [MISC AIDS  ] program , the [ORG Ministry reportedly  ] plans to increase spending on state-run pharmaceutical production facilities . 
Local press reports of September 1 highlighted Health Minister [PER Costa  ] 's announcement that 36 million reais ( approximately $12.4 million USD ) from the [ORG Ministry 's  ] 2003 budget , formerly sequestered , are finally to be released to finance capacity building at state-owned laboratories . 
The 2004 budget draft increases that amount to 80 million reais . 
Industry Concern Deepens with New Decree in Place --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a September 19 telcon with Embassy Econoff , [ORG Merck Communications  ] Director [PER Joao Sanches  ] expressed his concern over what he characterized as growing anti-patent sentiment in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He said the recent decree and several bills currently before [ORG Congress  ] all seek to limit patent holder rights . 
Citing assessments of the decree from [MISC Brazilian  ] intellectual property lawyers , [PER Sanches  ] said that its constitutionality is questionable , as federal government actions are not supposed to impose additional requirements beyond the limits set by the law . 
More optimistically , he stated that lower-level [ORG MoH  ] contacts have told him the [ORG GoB  ] does not want to employ the new decree , preferring a negotiated solution to the imposition of compulsory licensing. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a separate September 19 meeting with [LOC Sao Paulo  ] econoff , FCS principal commercial officer and [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Research-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association  ] ( [ORG Interfarma  ] ) President [PER Flavio Vormittag  ] , [PER Sanches  ] expanded on the above concerns , highlighting what he characterized as the [ORG MoH  ] 's lack of response to industry overtures in the area of price reductions and the absence of open dialogue between the companies and the [ORG MoH  ] during the negotiation process . 
According to [PER Sanches  ] , recent proposals by both [ORG Abbott  ] and [PER Roche  ] were again refused by the [ORG MoH  ] as unsatisfactory . 
( [PER Note: Sanches  ] was disillusioned that the [ORG MoH  ] has at no time during current negotiations recognized the significant price reductions the companies instituted over the past few years in support of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC AIDS  ] program . 
Only two years ago , [ORG Merck  ] received plaudits in the press and from the former head of [LOC Brazil  ] 's National [MISC AIDS  ] program for the price cuts they delivered . 
[PER Roche  ] also cut its price for Nelfinavir in almost half that same year . 
End note . 
) [PER Sanches  ] revealed that [ORG Merck  ] had formally requested a 60-day extension ( beyond the original August 31 deadline ) from the [ORG MoH  ] negotiating team so as to review the price reduction demands for [MISC Efavirenz  ] in the context of [ORG Merck  ] 's global pricing policy . 
[PER Sanches  ] emphasized that any changes to pricing levels in the [MISC Brazilian  ] market would require buy-in from [ORG Merck  ] 's executive body . 
The [ORG MoH  ] had not formally responded to the extension request , but [PER Sanches  ] believed the [ORG MoH  ] intended to send a formal communique this week in essence denying their appeal for an extended negotiating timeline . 
[PER Sanches  ] further stated that [ORG Merck  ] 's formal requests for a meeting with Minister [PER Costa  ] have gone unanswered . 
According to [PER Sanches  ] , [PER Costa  ] has yet to receive representatives from any of the three companies since negotiations began. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sanches  ] reiterated [ORG Merck  ] 's position that the prices demanded by the [ORG MoH  ] are below cost and even lower than those [ORG Merck  ] has granted to least-developed countries in [LOC Africa  ] . 
He stated that they amount to a 45 percent reduction for [ORG Merck  ] and an 84 percent reduction for [ORG Abbott  ] ( reftel ) . 
[PER Sanches  ] mentioned that [ORG Merck  ] has a contract with the [ORG GOB  ] valid through the end of this year . 
Despite the hard stance taken by the [ORG GoB  ] , [PER Sanches  ] did not seem to think that the [ORG GoB  ] would risk breaking the pricing contracts at this time and still sees some hope for negotiation on the pricing issue . 
( [PER Note: Sanches  ] also stated that the price currently demanded by the [ORG GoB  ] is lower even than that which can be obtained through importation of the drugs from [LOC India  ] or [LOC China  ] , and suggested that this supports the view that the [ORG GoB  ] would prefer a negotiated solution to employing the new decree . 
End note . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the [ORG GoB  ] claims its revisions to [ORG Article  ] 71 implementation legislation are [MISC TRIPS-compliant  ] , both [PER Sanches  ] and [PER Vormittag  ] disagree . 
[ORG Interfarma  ] has contracted a team of lawyers to review the two documents to determine whether or not the [ORG GoB  ] would be violating [ORG TRIPS  ] through the issuance of a compulsory license under the new decree. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both [PER Vormittag  ] and [PER Sanches  ] predicted that if a compulsory license were issued for anti-retrovirals , the [ORG GoB  ] might decide to expand such action to other medications ( i.e. vaccines , cancer , malaria , and tuberculosis ) , and even to other sectors ( e.g. software ) . 
They were fast to point out that the decree is not AIDS-drug-specific . 
[PER Vormittag  ] opined that the [ORG GoB  ] started with anti-retrovirals because [MISC AIDS  ] is a high- profile issue , backed by a well-organized group in [LOC Brazil  ] ; universal access to medication for all [MISC AIDS  ] patients is also written into [MISC Brazilian  ] law , providing a more formidable basis for issuing compulsory licenses in the name of the public interest . 
[ORG Merck  ] Contemplates Its Options ------------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sanches  ] admitted that at this time the least painful road for [ORG Merck  ] to take would be to negotiate a smaller price reduction or agree to voluntary licensing . 
[ORG Merck  ] is currently working with a team from Fiocruz to analyze the technical requirements for manufacturing under a voluntary license . 
The company has yet to make a final decision . 
( Note: This is a change in stance from previous conversations with [PER Sanches  ] in that he now believes the [ORG MoH  ] may accept one or the other demand , no longer obliging the patent-owners to comply with both requirements -- price reduction and voluntary licensing -- included in the original [ORG MoH Administrative Rule  ] governing the negotiations . 
End note . 
) Meanwhile , More [MISC Social-Policy Pressure  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The first [ORG National Conference  ] on [ORG Medicines and Pharmaceutical Assistance  ] took place in [LOC Brasilia  ] September 15- 18 , ending with consensus that the country needs to guarantee public access to free , quality pharmaceuticals . 
The Minister of Health opened the conference , which brought together academics , bureaucrats and business representatives to propose recommendations to be incorporated in the Ministry 's pharmaceutical policy . 
One of the conference resolutions suggested revision of [LOC Brazil  ] 's patent law to allow for local production or importation of expensive medicines in cases of " relevant social interest . 
" Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While we cannot guess at the outcome of the current price negotiations , we do judge that the [ORG GoB  ] will not let [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] patients go without these vital medicines , nor will it be willing to divert significant additional budgetary resources to meet increasing demand for the latest generation of drugs . 
The global adulation of the [ORG GoB  ] 's [MISC AIDS  ] program , plus the emergency status that the [ORG WTO  ] has conferred upon the [MISC AIDS  ] epidemic , make it likely that the [ORG GoB  ] will employ compulsory licensing to assure the supply of [MISC AIDS  ] drugs unless the desired price reductions are negotiated . 
Importation of knock-offs would likely be a temporary measure until the state- owned lab can begin internal production . 
Whether [LOC Brazil  ] can actually startup production of these pharmaceuticals as cheaply as [MISC Brazilian  ] officials seemingly assume is not a foregone conclusion .
