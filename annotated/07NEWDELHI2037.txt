[LOC Bangladesh  ] At a [LOC Crossroads  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC PolCouns  ] met April 26 with [ORG Ministry of External Affairs  ] ( MEA ) Joint Secretary ( [LOC Bangladesh  ] , [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , [LOC Maldives  ] and [LOC Myanmar  ] ) [PER Mohan Kumar  ] to discuss [MISC India’s  ] assessment of recent events in the region . 
Also initially in attendance was [ORG British High Commission  ] PolCouns [PER Alex Hall-Hall  ] , who had coincidentally been discussing [LOC Bangladesh  ] with [PER Kumar  ] when [ORG PolCouns  ] walked in . 
[PER Kumar  ] and [PER Hall-Hall  ] described their conversation , agreeing that the recent decision by the caretaker government ( [ORG CTG  ] ) in [LOC Bangladesh  ] to allow [ORG Sheikh Hasina  ] and [PER Khaleda Zia  ] to return had put that country at a crossroads . 
The government had gone back on its strategy to remove the two women from the political scene , they assessed , would be weakened , and the question now was whether the government will reassert itself by pushing the election schedule forward , or by digging in its heels and seeking to remain in power longer . 
[PER Kumar  ] presented a third option , that either the military or one of the women would stir up civil unrest , which could then be used as a pretext by the military to step in and take political control , although he admitted he did not believe a military coup was likely . 
[PER Kumar  ] suggested that now would be an opportune moment for the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] and [LOC India  ] to agree on a core message to take to the caretaker government , pressing for elections and voter list reforms , providing support for the government as long as it sticks to a schedule for elections , and making clear that the military needs to remain out of politics . 
[PER Hall-Hall  ] noted that any coordination needed to remain invisible to the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] public in order to avoid the perception of some sort of conspiracy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kumar  ] said [LOC India  ] is concerned with the time frame for [MISC Bangladeshi  ] elections , given -- in his analysis -- that the government has been weakened . 
He believed the interim government would benefit by moving up elections to the first quarter of 2008 . 
He noted that he had been the notetaker for the April 4 meeting between Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] and Chief Advisor [PER Fakhruddin  ] , and his impression was that [PER Fakhruddin  ] “was not a free agent.” [PER Fakhruddin  ] made no commitments and could not clearly explain the government’s strategy , leading [PER Kumar  ] to believe [PER Fakhruddin  ] was merely the executor of the military’s political control. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kumar  ] stated that good progress had been made in talks between [ORG India’s Border Security Forces  ] and the [LOC Bangladesh  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00002037 002 OF 002 Rifles . 
The five-day February meeting between high-level officials was “fantastic , ” he said , adding that guards on both sides of the border have cooperated better since the meeting . 
( Note: Kumar’s comments echo what [ORG Bangladesh Embassy Political Minister  ] [PER Mashfee Binte Shams  ] told [PER Poloff  ] earlier in the week , that the [ORG BSF  ] and [ORG BDR  ] have relieved border tensions and improved communications .

) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] could help [LOC India  ] by pressing [LOC Bangladesh  ] to open its economy and trade , [PER Kumar  ] suggested . 
Companies such as [ORG Tata  ] , which have made efforts to enter the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] manufacturing market , are reporting to [PER Kumar  ] that the [ORG CTG  ] is impeding its entry into [LOC Bangladesh  ] . 
[PER Kumar  ] said he has met with representatives of the [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] , who have been positive regarding the potential for infrastructure projects in the region , but in terms of assisting with [MISC India-Bangladesh  ] trade have only suggested some smaller connectivity projects. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC PolCouns  ] referred to press accounts of the recent visit to [LOC New Delhi  ] by [MISC Burmese  ] [ORG Quartermaster General  ] Lt. Gen [ORG Thiha Thura Tin Aung  ] Myint Oo , which reported that Lt. Gen Tin had come requesting infantry weapons and ammunition in return for the junta’s help in flushing out insurgents based along the border . 
[PER Kumar  ] said he was unaware of any promises [LOC India  ] made to provide such materiel , but would check on the report’s veracity . 
He stated [LOC India  ] is losing influence -- and gas deals -- in [LOC Burma  ] to [LOC China  ] , and suggested that [MISC American  ] pressure on [LOC India  ] to press the junta on democracy and human rights was counterproductive . 
The more the [LOC U.S.  ] presses [LOC India  ] to bring [LOC Burma  ] before the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , he said , the more the [MISC Burmese  ] tell [LOC India  ] to “go to hell.” [MISC PolCouns  ] strongly countered , pointing out the junta’s horrible record on human rights and democracy dating back years , and stressed to [PER Kumar  ] that any assistance to the [MISC Burmese  ] regime by [LOC India  ] would be poorly received by [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) India-Burma relations have deteriorated to being unidimensional , [PER Kumar  ] said , with the only cooperation being on the anti-insurgency campaign along the border . 
[LOC India  ] is not getting any gas contracts from [LOC Burma  ] ( “We’re getting screwed on gas” were Kumar’s exact words , reflective of his candid nature ) , nor is it getting the transit rights it seeks which would open a bridge to [LOC East Asia  ] . 
[MISC Burmese  ] officials have told [PER Kumar  ] that they “hate” the [MISC Chinese  ] and would prefer not to cooperate with [LOC China  ] , but do so because they feel [LOC Beijing  ] is more reliable than [LOC New Delhi  ] . 
He claimed a recent report that [LOC India  ] was planning to provide [LOC Burma  ] with [MISC T-55  ] tanks was untrue. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The situation in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] is “bad , really bad - beyond bleak” in Kumar’s judgment . 
Characterizing the government and the [ORG LTTE  ] as two sets of people with scant regard for the international community , [PER Kumar  ] was skeptical that political progress could be achieved anytime soon . 
He confirmed reports that the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Navy  ] has stepped up patrols in the [LOC Palk Strait  ] , and said that [LOC India  ] and [LOC Sri Lanka  ] are doing coordinated patrolling to prevent the smuggling of weapons from the [LOC Tamil Nadu  ] coast . 
[PER Kumar  ] said it would be helpful to get the [MISC American  ] assessment of the port being built in [LOC Hambantota  ] , which he estimated [LOC China  ] was willing to spend $500 million to help develop . 
He noted that [LOC China  ] has increased its influence with President [PER Rajapaksa  ] , opining that [PER Rajapaksa  ] had a “soft spot” for [LOC China  ] following his visit to [LOC Beijing  ] in [LOC March.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Bio note . 
[PER Kumar  ] confirmed he has been selected to become the Deputy Chief of Mission at the [MISC Indian  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] , likely to assume the position in August .
