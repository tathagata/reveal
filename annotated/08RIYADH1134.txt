( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Alwahbi  ] informed us that [MISC Saudi  ] Minister of State for Foreign Affairs ( MFA Deputy Secretary equivalent ) Dr. [PER Nizar  ] bin [PER Obaid Madani  ] would lead the [MISC Saudi  ] delegation . 
He assured us [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] did not want the [ORG NAM  ] meeting to become an [MISC Iranian  ] propaganda event , adding he had seen the proposed agenda and did not expect it to develop in such a manner . 
[PER Alwahbi  ] agreed [LOC Iran  ] 's continued nuclear enrichment was a grave SAG concern with regional security implications ( Reftel B ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Alwahbi  ] strongly advised against taking military action to neutralize [LOC Iran  ] 's program . 
Rather , establishing a [MISC US-Iranian  ] dialogue was the best course of action , asserting that the [ORG USG  ] opening an Interest Section or re-opening our Embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] would be positive step . 
[PER Alwahbi  ] was heartened by the [ORG USG  ] 's initiative for Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] to meet with the [MISC Iranians  ] last week in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
He added that , in his view , [LOC Iran  ] 's position was " shifting " and wanted to avoid escalation of tensions . 
He noted his belief that the [MISC Russians  ] had recently been effectively pressuring [LOC Iran  ] to be less provocative . 
[PER Alwahbi  ] concluded that he expected [LOC Iran  ] to keep tensions relatively low at least until after the [LOC US  ] presidential election. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT . 
These comments are typical of [MISC Saudi  ] MFA bureaucrats who take a pacific stance towards [LOC Iran  ] , but diverge significantly from the more bellicose advice we have gotten from senior [MISC Saudi  ] royals . 
END COMMENT .
