REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: The results of this year 's General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( [ORG Parliament-equivalent  ] ) , which commenced in [LOC Sirte  ] on March 2 , will be closely watched for signs that the [MISC Libyan  ] leadership remains committed to economic reform and reengagement with the international community . 
Observers will also carefully weigh the expected new government 's composition to gauge the relative positions of [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi and his recently ascendant brother , [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , the two sons of Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] who are widely considered to be rivals to succeed their father . 
Among the cabinet officers rumored to be candidates for replacement are the Prime Minister , the Foreign Minister , and several ministers in charge of domestic portfolios . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) Public media reports and private speculation among observers in [LOC Tripoli  ] have focused considerable attention on the annual session of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] - [ORG Parliament-equivalent  ] ) , which commenced in [LOC Sirte  ] on March 2 , and the cabinet change expected to be announced at the event 's conclusion . 
Leader [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi launched this year 's session with a lengthy speech in which he directed strong criticism at the government for failing to address the needs of the people . 
The last cabinet change , in January 2007 ( ref A ) , was the second such shuffle in less than a year and was perceived to have shifted reform-minded individuals into key positions . 
ECONOMIC REFORM AND POLITICAL SUCCESSION KEY ISSUES 3 . 
( C ) While changes of government are common , the expected upcoming shuffle will be parsed closely for two principal reasons . 
First , it will be viewed as a sign of senior [ORG GOL  ] leaders' commitment to economic and limited attendant political reform . 
Appointment of a cabinet perceived to be " reformist " ( in the [MISC Libyan  ] context ) would be seen as an important signal that the leadership intends to support a program of reform and further reintegrating of [LOC Libya  ] into the international community after two-plus decades of relative isolation . 
Second , the shape of the new government may help define the relative influence and position of two of Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's sons - putative heir-apparent [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi and recently appointed [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi - whom press reports and some contacts have argued are in de facto competition to succeed their father . 
EASY ECONOMIC REFORM HAS BEEN DONE 4 . 
( C ) This year 's annual [ORG GPC  ] session comes at an important juncture . 
Initial announcements of economic initiatives and reform that followed [LOC Libya  ] 's December 2003 decision to abandon its WMD program and renounce terrorism have given way to the hard reality that considerable economic and administrative work remains to be done if [LOC Libya  ] is to realize its development aspirations . 
A local business contact noted that the [ORG GOL  ] has " already picked the low-hanging fruit " in terms of easy reform by allowing importation of more consumer products , privatizing banks , easing enforcement of draconian currency regulations and creating a legal framework ( of sorts ) for partnership with foreign investors and commercial entities . 
PERCEIVED LACK OF REFORM COMMITMENT " KILLING " BUSINESS 5 . 
( C ) Recent developments like the imprisonment of well-connected businessmen last year , changes in commercial codes that effectively rolled back key reforms , and the increasingly apparent disconnect between the [ORG GOL  ] 's anti-corruption message and the business practices of senior apparatchiks have underscored the dissonance between the [ORG GOL  ] 's message and the reality on the ground. xxxxxxxxxxxx ( strictly protect ) , scion of a leading business family , characterized the prevailing " confusion " among senior [ORG GOL  ] officials about the country 's direction as " a crisis " for the business community . 
The lack of clear commitment to and , critically , implementation of , announced reform measures were " killing " new projects while investors waited to see how the perceived reform struggle plays out . 
QUESTIONS ABOUT SAIF'S COMMITMENT , INFLUENCE 6 . 
( C ) Much of the debate centers on the role of the reformist camp 's public face and purported champion , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi. xxxxxxxxxxxx ( strictly protect ) , xxxxxxxxxxxx , told P/E Chief in early January that events in the second half of 2007 had " seriously eroded " the business [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000166 002.2 OF 004 community 's confidence in [PER Saif  ] as a serious proponent of reform , and had raised questions about the real extent of his influence . 
THE OLD GUARD DIGS IN 7 . 
( C ) In addition , senior officials brought in by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam to help implement reform measures have encountered serious opposition from regime figures skeptical about the strategic decision to re-engage with the [LOC West  ] ( and particularly the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) and concerned that their livelihoods , which depend on the old , kleptocratic way of doing business , will be directly threatened by reform . 
Dr. [PER Mahmud Jibril  ] , Chairman of the [ORG National Planning Council  ] and head of the affiliated [ORG Economic Development Board  ] , was personally wooed back to [LOC Libya  ] by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam to help implement reforms recommended in a [ORG Monitor Group  ] report developed under the direction of [ORG Harvard University  ] 's Dr. [PER Michael Porter  ] . 
( [PER Note: Jibril  ] holds a PhD from the [ORG University of Pittsburgh  ] and owns a successful business consultancy firm with offices in [LOC Cairo  ] and [LOC London  ] . 
End note . 
) xxxxxxxxxxxx ( strictly protect ) , a [MISC U.S.-based  ] , businessman with dual [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] nationality , told P/E Chief in early February that [PER Jibril  ] was " profoundly disappointed " by his limited ability to effect change and had submitted letters of resignation three times in the second half of 2007 , but had been dissuaded from leaving . 
LEADER'S HEALTH THROWS SPOTLIGHT ON SUCCESSION ISSUE 8 . 
( C ) As important as economic and reform equities is the political import of the expected cabinet shuffle . 
Media reports and local observers have dwelled in the past eight months on whether the perceived recent rise of [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's third son by his second wife , represents a threat to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's previously uncontested role as heir-apparent . 
( [PER Note: Saif  ] al-Islam is [PER Qadhafi  ] 's eldest son by his second wife . 
End note . 
) Citing conversations with unspecified members of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's family , [LOC France  ] 's former Ambassador to [LOC Tripoli  ] , [PER Jean-Jacques Beaussou  ] , told the [ORG CDA  ] and P/E Chief in early December that [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi suffered a series of strokes in May 2007 , calling into question how much longer the Leader would be able to rule and focusing attention on the critical issue of succession ( see ref B for further reporting on complications related to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's reported stroke ) . 
[ORG MUATASSIM & SAIF: RIVALS OR ALLIES  ] ? 9 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx ( strictly protect ) , head of a wealthy , well-known family , told P/E Chief in early February that [PER Qadhafi  ] deliberately tapped [PER Muatassim  ] as [ORG National Security Adviser  ] to create an alternate locus of power to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam and to " strategically stir the political pot " . 
[PER Muatassim  ] can act as an ally to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam or , if he demonstrates sufficient capability , could emerge as a viable alternative successor . 
[PER MUAMMAR AL-QADHAFI:  ] HEDGING HIS " STRATEGIC BET " 10 . 
( C ) [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's publicly reformist message endears him to [MISC Western  ] observers and would-be [MISC Libyan  ] reformists , said xxxxxxxxxxxx , while [PER Muatassim  ] is perceived to be a more traditional figure who appeals to important military and tribal leaders . 
By advancing both simultaneously and perpetuating ambiguity about their places in the pecking order , al-Qadhafi is able to better balance two key constituencies - pro-Western reformists and traditional old guard elements - while the struggle over reform and change plays out . 
The problem , xxxxxxxxxxxx noted , is that al-Qadhafi 's approach is fundamentally tactical and not strategic ; in typical fashion , al-Qadhafi has effectively hedged his December 2003 " strategic bet " to give up WMD and terrorism by fostering the perception that a traditional " strong man " ( [PER Muatassim  ] ) may take the reins of power . 
Two influential , longtime members of the [ORG Revolutionary Committees  ] - xxxxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxxxxxx - who are peers of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi , recently told xxxxxxxxxxxx they had been " extremely dissatisfied " with reforms attributed to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam , but were cautiously optimistic that [PER Muatassim  ] could become a leader they could live with . 
HANDICAPPING THE FIELD TRIPOLI 00000166 003.2 OF 004 11 . 
( C ) Among the cabinet officers , the Prime Minister-equivalent , Foreign Minister-equivalent , Secretary for Education , Secretary for Public Security ( MinInterior-equivalent ) , Secretary for Economy , [ORG Trade and Investment  ] and the Secretary for Manpower , Training and Employment are widely rumored as candidates for replacement . 
As reported ref C , a considerable portion of the [ORG GPC  ] will be devoted to televised interrogation of cabinet officers by [ORG GPC  ] members , who will ostensibly determine whether cabinet members have faithfully carried out the [ORG GPC  ] 's policies and effectively served the interest of the [LOC Jamahuriya  ] . 
Recalling his experience as Prime Minister in 1979-1981 , MFA Secretary for [ORG European Affairs  ] [PER Abdulati Obeidi  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] and P/E Chief on February 24 that the [ORG GPC  ] usually " closely consulted " Leader [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi about any proposed cabinet changes . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] -- ever [LOC Delphic  ] -- sometimes , but not always , offered opinions about the proposals . 
Post notes that cabinet changes have in the past transpired in stages , with some positions left unencumbered and new appointments made in subsequent tranches . 
PRIME MINISTER TO BE SACKED ? 12 . 
( C ) There is wide consensus that al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , Secretary of the [ORG GPC  ] ( Prime Minister-equivalent ) , will be SIPDIS removed . 
Speculation centers on three candidates to succeed him: [LOC AbuzaidDorda  ] , Chairman of the Housing and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] ; Dr. [PER Mahmud Jibril  ] , Chairman of the [ORG National Planning Council  ] ; and Dr. [PER Muhammad Siala  ] , Deputy Foreign Minister . 
13 . 
( C ) A number of well-place contacts say [PER Dorda  ] is the leading candidate for the job . 
[PER Dorda  ] has been the very public face of [LOC Libya  ] 's massive infrastructure development program , barnstorming provinces to announce housing and infrastructure programs . 
He is genuinely popular , so much so that [PER Qadhafi  ] - concerned that [PER Dorda  ] was becoming " too popular " - allegedly started rumors in December 2007 that he would lose his [ORG HIB  ] position in the upcoming cabinet shuffle . 
A schoolteacher by training , [PER Dorda  ] is a longtime apparatchik who has ridden a reputation as an anti-corruption crusader up the ranks ( see ref D for his remarks at a recent contract signing ) . 
Contact xxxxxxxxxxxx , who considers him a friend , described him as " an unreconstructed socialist " who is " intrinsically suspicious " of capitalism . 
Former [MISC U.K. Commercial  ] Counselor [PER Trevor Hines  ] characterized [PER Dorda  ] as being " among the worst " regime figures because he " claims to be supportive of economic reform and is forever announcing new reform measures , but in the end is as obstructionist as any of them " . 
Confident , popular and given to sanctimony , [PER Dorda  ] could be a difficult interlocutor for the [LOC U.S.  ] 14 . 
( C ) [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi reportedly asked Dr. [PER Mahmud Jibril  ] in mid-December whether he would accept the position . 
[PER Jibril  ] , citing former [ORG PM  ] and fellow would-be reformer [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] 's disappointing experience as a cautionary tale , told xxxxxxxxxxxx that he does not want the job ; however , rumors persist that he'll be tapped as " window dressing " for the reformist camp . 
Explaining his reluctance , [PER Jibril  ] described the job as more titular than functional , and said the higher profile only brings greater risk. xxxxxxxxxxxx dismissed the likelihood that [PER Jibril  ] would be named [ORG PM  ] , saying it is understood that he " does not want it " and " is not committed enough " to do the job . 
Nonetheless , xxxxxxxxxxxx told the [ORG CDA  ] on February 28 that [PER Jibril  ] would/would be tapped as next [ORG PM  ] . 
Smart , cosmopolitan and one of the most strategic thinkers among Post 's interlocutors , [PER Jibril  ] would be pro-reform and would likely favor continued re-engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] 15 . 
( C ) The names of Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Muhammad Siala  ] and [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi have also been connected with the [ORG PM  ] 's post. xxxxxxxxxxxx describes [PER Siala  ] , as " a good man " and " an able technocrat " , but says he is widely perceived as being " not strong enough " for the job . 
Rumors that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam could be tapped peaked late last year , but recent consensus has it that it would be " too early " for him and that he may be tapped to encumber a new , non-Cabinet level , economic development coordinator position . 
FOREIGN MINISTER - TOUGH TO CALL 16 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Abdulrahman Shalgham  ] has been widely rumored to be on the way out since last summer 's TRIPOLI 00000166 004.2 OF 004 denouement of the long-running [MISC Bulgarian  ] medics' case . 
There were reports after his early January visit to [LOC Washington  ] that he had fallen further out of favor over the perception that he had been sufficiently tough in arguing [LOC Libya  ] 's position in his dealings with USG officials . 
[PER Shalgham  ] 's departure could mean the departure of his pro-U.S . 
Secretary for the [ORG Americas  ] , Dr. [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] recently that if [PER Shalgham  ] goes , he will , too . 
MFA [ORG Americas  ] Desk Director [PER Muhammad Matari  ] told P/E Chief February 20 that perceptions of [PER Shalgham  ] 's [LOC Washington  ] trip were " mixed " , but nonetheless argued that there was " a 90 percent chance " that [PER Shalgham  ] would remain as FM . 
Stressing the importance of the [LOC U.S.  ] account , he said that if Secretary Rice had visited [LOC Libya  ] before the [ORG GPC  ] , as had been SIPDIS originally planned , it would be a certainty that [PER Shalgham  ] would keep his job. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) If [PER Shalgham  ] goes , the consensus in most quarters is that Deputy FM Muhammad [PER Siala  ] would move up to take the FM post . 
[PER Siala  ] is a smart , cosmopolitan , technocrat who understands and appears to be genuinely committed to economic reform ; he also favors reengagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC West  ] . 
Although not the politician that [PER Shalgham  ] is , he is in some respects more thoughtful and would likely be a capable and sympathetic interlocutor. xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E chief in late December/early January that he had heard reports from unspecified senior [MISC RevComm  ] members that [ORG External Security Organization  ] Chief [PER Musa Kusa  ] could be moved up to become FM ; however , more recently he said the idea seemed to have died and that [PER Kusa  ] could be sent abroad as ambassador to a large western country . 
AND ROUNDING OUT THE FIELD ... <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) On other portfolios , xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief that if an associate of [PER Saif  ] al-Islam is tapped to be [ORG PM  ] , Muatassim 's camp could be given the position of Speaker of the Parliament , with [MISC RevComm  ] figure [PER Abdallah Othman  ] replacing [PER Ahmed Ibrahim  ] . 
To balance out the [MISC RecComm  ] cadres' influence , Secretary for Education Dr. Abd al-Kader al-Baghdadi , a [MISC RevComm  ] fixture , would lose his seat . 
The Minister for [ORG Public Security , Brigadier General  ] Salleh [PER Muhammad Rajub  ] al-Messmari , will almost certainly lose his seat thanks to the behavior of his adult son . 
He will likely be replaced by his deputy , [PER Omran Hmeid  ] , who has effectively been the acting Minister since al-Messmari fell from grace late last summer . 
Minister for Manpower , Training and Employment [PER Matuq Matuq  ] , a regime fixture who has held numerous cabinet positions and who has been the bane of international oil and gas companies - one contact described him as " a troglodyte " - may be pushed to the Housing and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] - technically a non-cabinet post - if Abuzaid [PER Dorda  ] moves up to become [ORG PM  ] . 
Secretary for Economy , [ORG Trade and Investment  ] Dr. [PER Ali al-Essawi  ] has been mentioned as being on the way out ; however , reviews of his performance are mixed and we 've heard no informed speculation as to who might replace him .
