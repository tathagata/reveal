Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
SUMMARY: Ambassador [PER Marcel Biato  ] , Chief of Staff to [MISC Brazilian  ] presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , told the [ORG DCM  ] September 11 that [LOC Brazil  ] is engaged in seeking a solution to the latest crisis in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
President [PER Lula  ] had offered to foster dialogue to help stabilize the situation but had been rebuffed by [PER Morales  ] , as had [ORG GOB  ] overtures to the opposition . 
[PER Biato  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] is sympathetic to the [MISC Bolivian  ] Government 's legitimate attempts to regain control over its territory and believes that it wants to avoid bloodshed . 
The [ORG GOB  ] hopes that the [ORG USG  ] and others will steer clear of actions and statements that harden the postures of the players and their supporters in the hemisphere . 
Ministry of [ORG External Relations  ] ( MRE ) [LOC South America  ] Division head [PER Joao Pereira Pinto  ] reiterated September 12 the [ORG GOB  ] 's desire to facilitate dialogue , but indicated it has not yet decided on the best mechanism for doing so . 
[PER Pereira  ] noted [LOC Brazil  ] 's intent to send a high-level delegation to [LOC Bolivia  ] at the appropriate time , and said the [ORG GOB  ] was coordinating its response with [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER Pereira  ] agreed that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , like [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Evo Morales  ] , was using the expulsion of [LOC U.S.  ] ambassadors and accusations of conspiracies as a " tactic " to distract from domestic woes . 
He suggested that the energy problems created by the temporary cut-off of some gas to [LOC Brazil  ] were not serious and would be resolved within days . 
The [ORG GOB  ] sees the situation as a domestic political problem in which neither side is willing to negotiate , and sees eventual dialogue as the key to a solution , but it has yet to find a way forward toward achieving that goal . 
Although worried by the situation , the [ORG GOB  ] is for the time being coordinating behind the scenes with other regional actors . 
END SUMMARY. -------------------------------- FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] met with Amb . 
[PER Biato  ] on September 11 to discuss the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] is concerned about the situation and has engaged . 
[PER Lula  ] had called [PER Evo Morales  ] that afternoon , offering to help foster dialogue to help stabilize the situation . 
They did not discuss natural gas during the conversation , [LOC Brazil  ] , s main economic interest , however . 
He said [PER Lula  ] had offered the help of the Friends of [LOC Bolivia  ] group ( [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , and [LOC Colombia  ] ) , but [PER Morales  ] did not accept . 
( NOTE: According to press reports , [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] and MRE Secretary General ( Vice Minister ) are on standby and prepared to depart for [LOC Bolivia  ] as soon as [PER Morales  ] gives permission . 
END NOTE . 
) According to [PER Biato  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] has also tried to speak with the prefects of the opposition departments , but to date they have declined . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has not offered any other kind of assistance. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Biato  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] sees the problem as a domestic political issue , in which neither side is willing to negotiate with the other right now . 
The solution needs to be political dialogue and restoration of the rule of law , not use of force . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] government is sympathetic to the [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's legitimate attempts to regain control over its territory , he said . 
The [ORG GOB  ] also believes that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government wants to avoid serious bloodshed ; it did not want a repeat of the [PER Sanchez Lozada  ] episode in which many people were killed and the government was toppled . 
The [ORG GOB  ] does not presently predict a catastrophic scenario ahead , he [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001226 002 OF 003 added , but it worries that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government may be weakening and wonders if the military and police ( especially the police ) will be up to the task of protecting public institutions and energy facilities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] laid out the [ORG USG  ] 's position , stating that we saw serious implications for our bilateral relationship with [LOC Bolivia  ] , for the regional fight against narcotrafficking , and for regional security . 
She noted also that [MISC Morales'  ] unwarranted action of declaring Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] persona non grata was a case of extremely poor timing , as it occurred just ahead of our drug certification decision -- a decision that had been controversial and difficult in recent years . 
The outlook for [ORG ATPDEA  ] could also be complicated by [MISC Morales'  ] action , she added . 
[PER Biato  ] appeared to take careful note of this , asking when the certification decision would be made , for example. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] hopes that [ORG USG  ] and others will steer clear of actions and statements that harden the postures of any of the players or their supporters in the hemisphere , [PER Biato  ] stated . 
He also noted that in its own public statements , the [ORG GOB  ] has avoided making accusations of " terrorist acts , " instead describing them as " acts of vandalism . 
" ( NOTE: The [ORG GOB  ] 's public statement on the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] calls for respect for constitutional government , condemnation of actions of violence , and a call for dialogue towards a negotiated and sustainable solution .

END NOTE . 
) The [ORG GOB  ] urged us to continue " strategic patience " while acknowledging that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government accusations against Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] are without foundation , [PER Biato  ] said . 
" False dichotomies " ( [MISC South American  ] political alignments ) could result from politicizing the rhetoric , he warned. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Addressing industry concerns about the disruption in gas supplies caused by damage to the pipeline in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Biato  ] characterized the current situation as " worrisome but not grave for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
" Subsequent discussions with energy sector contacts indicate that [LOC Brazil  ] can continue for some time ( many weeks ) with the 10 percent shortfall in [MISC Bolivian  ] supply of natural gas to [LOC Brazil  ] through a variety of contingency plans ( Ref B ) , including use of alternative types of energy . 
A shortfall of 50 percent in [MISC Bolivian  ] supply of natural gas to [LOC Brazil  ] would be serious ; at this level of shortfall , the main cost for [LOC Brazil  ] would be economic higher energy costs raising prices more broadly in the economy. ----------------------- THE VIEW FROM [ORG ITAMARATY  ] ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Political Counselor and Deputy Political Counselor met September 12 with MRE ( AKA " Itamaraty " ) Director of [MISC South American  ] Department I , Minister [PER Joao Pereira Pinto  ] . 
[PER Pereira  ] , whose section is responsible for bilateral relations with the [MISC MERCOSUL  ] countries and [LOC Bolivia  ] , said that [LOC Brazil  ] was trying to promote dialogue between the government and the opposition prefects , but lamented that at the moment both sides " lack the ability and the willingness to engage in dialogue . 
" He said that although the [ORG GOB  ] had tried to talk to the opposition , the [PER Morales  ] government wanted [LOC Brazil  ] to talk to it only . 
Both sides had come out of the August 10 referendum with indications of popular support for their respective positions and considered themselves " winners . 
" This only hardened their positions and made them less willing to talk , he added . 
He also mentioned that dialogue was made more difficult by the underlying racial divisions between the two parties and possible linguistic difficulties which could contribute to misunderstandings. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Pereira  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] saw the need to lower the level of confrontation between the two sides , and speculated that [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001226 003 OF 003 to do so it needed to " speak frankly " with the politicians on both sides . 
He said the [ORG GOB  ] was coordinating with [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] but , in response to the [ORG PolCounselor  ] 's statement that the [ORG USG  ] was considering the possibility of addressing the situation at an [ORG OAS  ] meeting and would be looking to [LOC Brazil  ] for possible assistance should that occur , [PER Pereira  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] did not " know about the [ORG OAS  ] yet . 
" He added that , " It 's always a possibility as a way to facilitate dialogue , " but noted that former [MISC Argentine  ] Foreign Minister [PER Dante Caputo  ] wanted to go to [LOC Bolivia  ] with a group but had been told by the [PER Morales  ] government not to come . 
( NOTE: According to press reports , President [PER Lula  ] has spoken with [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] and [PER Hugo Chavez  ] about the situation , and the [ORG GOB  ] is coordinating with its Friends of [LOC Bolivia  ] partners , [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG PolCounselor  ] noted that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] had announced the expulsion of the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador . 
[PER Pereira  ] indicated he gave no credence to either [PER Chavez  ] 's or [MISC Morales'  ] accusations , but saw them as tactics aimed at distracting from internal problems . 
[PER Pereira  ] likened [PER Chavez  ] to an unruly schoolboy who is popular only because his antics create problems for the teacher . 
Commenting on [LOC Venezuela  ] 's involvement in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Pereira  ] said that " [PER Morales  ] has to deal with [PER Chavez  ] carefully , " as there is a great deal of anti-Chavez sentiment in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
The [ORG PolCounselor  ] took the opportunity to inform [PER Pereira  ] that the [ORG USG  ] would be publicly announcing the addition of three high ranking [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials to its list of drug kingpins ( ref C ) . 
[PER Pereira  ] said that would definitely complicate matters and wondered if there were not some way to adjust or postpone the announcement . 
The [ORG PolCounselor  ] told him there was not , but assured him that the timing of the announcement was purely coincidental as it had been in the works well before the current situation flared up . 
[PER Pereira  ] said he would pass the information on to his colleague responsible for relations with [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Discussing the events of the last few days in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Pereira  ] downplayed the significance of the gas pipeline cut-off . 
He echoed official [ORG GOB  ] statements that the first incident involving damage to the pipeline had been an act of vandalism . 
He said the second incident was still being investigated , and speculated that it may have been caused by [ORG Petrobras  ] increasing the level of pressure in the pipeline to push a greater volume of gas through to make up for the previous interruption in supply . 
Whatever the cause of the problem , he noted the second problem had been fixed by 3 PM on September 11 and that the first should be repaired within the next few days. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The [ORG GOB  ] recognizes the potential for the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] to deteriorate into a grave political crisis , which could have extremely negative consequences for [LOC Brazil  ] ( including emigration to [LOC Brazil  ] , lost investments , and ruptured political relations ) . 
However , the [ORG GOB  ] sees the current situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] as a domestic political problem resulting from the fact that neither side is willing to negotiate , and appears to be at a loss for the moment on how best to proceed . 
The [ORG GOB  ] firmly believes that the best way to deal with the crisis is through dialogue between the [ORG Morales Government  ] and the opposition prefects . 
The [ORG GOB  ] is willing to help facilitate such dialogue , but its offers have been rebuffed . 
At present , the [ORG GOB  ] does not believe the situation will degenerate into a grave political crisis . 
So , although worried by the situation and eager to facilitate a solution , the [ORG GOB  ] is for the time being coordinating behind the scenes with other regional actors . 
END COMMENT .
