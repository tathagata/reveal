USNATO  ] 35 B. 09 STATE 127892 Classified By: EUR PDAS [PER Nancy McEldowney  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action cable . 
Please see paragraphs 3-4. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Summary and [ORG Action Request  ] . 
On January 22 [ORG NATO  ] Allies agreed in the [ORG Military Committee  ] to expand the [ORG NATO  ] Contingency Plan for [LOC Poland  ] , EAGLE GUARDIAN , to include the defense and reinforcement of the [LOC Baltic States  ] . 
[ORG Posts  ] in [LOC Allied  ] capitals should be prepared to explain , as necessary , [LOC U.S.  ] support for this approach and how it fits within our broader vision for [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning , as well as how to respond to media inquiries on the matter . 
[ORG Posts  ] are asked to draw on the points below , as necessary , in discussions on this issue . 
End Summary and [ORG Action Request.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Posts  ] need not engage host government officials proactively on [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning at this time , but are encouraged to use the points below as the basis for discussions on the matter as needed . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) CONTINGENCY POINTS ( FOR USE AT POST , S DISCRETION ) -- The [LOC United States  ] believes that [ORG NATO  ] - as a matter of course - should conduct appropriate contingency planning for the possible defense of [LOC Allied  ] territory and populations . 
-- As President [PER Obama  ] said in [LOC Prague:  ] “We must work together as [ORG NATO  ] members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats , wherever they may come from.” -- The [LOC U.S.  ] welcomes the decision to expand EAGLE GUARDIAN to include the defense of the [MISC Baltic  ] states , and sees it as a logical military extension of the existing contingency plan that fits well within the existing scenario . 
-- We see the expansion of EAGLE GUARDIAN as a step toward the possible expansion of [ORG NATO’s  ] other existing country-specific contingency plans into regional plans . 
This is the first step in a multi-stage process to develop a complete set of appropriate contingency plans for the full range of possible threats - both regional and functional - as soon as possible . 
At the same time , we believe contingency planning is only one element of [ORG NATO’s Article  ] 5 preparedness . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) POINTS ABOUT PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF PLANS ( FOR USE AT POST’S DISCRETION ) -- The [LOC United States  ] believes strongly that such planning should not be discussed publicly . 
These military plans are classified at the [ORG NATO  ] SECRET level . 
-- The [MISC Alliance  ] has many public diplomacy tools at its disposal . 
Contingency planning is not one of them . 
What we should do is explore other public steps for demonstrating the vitality of [ORG Article  ] 5 , such as exercises , defense investment , and partnerships . 
-- Public discussion of contingency plans undermines their military value , giving insight into [ORG NATO’s  ] planning processes . 
This weakens the security of all Allies . 
-- A public discussion of contingency planning would also likely lead to an unnecessary increase in [LOC NATO-Russia  ] tensions , something we should try to avoid as we work to improve practical cooperation in areas of common [LOC NATO-Russia  ] interest . 
-- We hope that we can count on your support in keeping discussions on [ORG NATO  ] contingency planning out of the public domain . 
-- We should work together to develop strategies - to include activities such as exercises , defense investment , and partnerships - for demonstrating to our publics that [ORG Article  ] 5’s value ultimately lies in [ORG NATO’s  ] capabilities and deterrence , rather than specific planning. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Washington  ] strongly believes that the details of [ORG NATO  ] , s contingency plans should remain in confidential channels . 
However , recent press coverage of [ORG NATO  ] decisions regarding possible contingency planning options for the [MISC Baltic  ] region may lead to additional media inquiries . 
If necessary , posts may use the points below in responding to STATE 00007810 002 OF 002 public queries . 
( U ) PUBLIC/PRESS INQUIRIES -- IF ASKED: -- [ORG NATO  ] does not discuss specific plans . 
-- As a matter of course , however , [ORG NATO  ] engages in planning in order to be as prepared as possible for whatever situations might arise , particularly as relates to its ability to carrying out its [ORG Article  ] 5 commitments . 
-- Plans are not static . 
[ORG NATO  ] is constantly reviewing and revising its plans . 
-- [ORG NATO  ] planning is an internal process designed to make the [MISC Alliance  ] as prepared as possible for future contingencies . 
It is not “aimed” at any other country . 
-- President [PER Obama  ] acknowledged this when he said at [LOC Prague  ] that “We must work together as [ORG NATO  ] members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats , wherever they may come from.” CLINTON</pre></code>
