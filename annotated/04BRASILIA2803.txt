( [ORG SBU  ] ) Biographical Note: - Dep . 
[PER Maninha  ] ( pronounced " ma-NEEN-ya " ) is a Federal Deputy from President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) ; she represents the Federal District of [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
A physician by background , this is her first term in the federal [ORG Congress  ] after two terms in the state assembly . 
As a member , and now Vice-Chair , of the [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] , she has been active in discussions on free trade and [LOC Haiti  ] . 
She comes from the [ORG Workers' Party  ] 's left-wing but is a reasonable interlocutor regarding [LOC US  ] foreign policy issues . 
She understands [MISC English  ] but speaks it only haltingly. - Dep . 
[PER Fernando Gabeira  ] is a more complicated case . 
As a leftist journalist in 1969 opposed to the military regime , he was part of a group that kidnapped US Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Charles Elbrick  ] . 
[PER Gabeira  ] released [PER Elbrick  ] after three days , in return for the regime 's releasing a dozen political prisoners . 
[PER Gabeira  ] is now a respected Federal Deputy who founded [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Green Party  ] and later joined [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers' Party  ] . 
He is currently " without party " . 
Because of the kidnapping , [PER Gabeira  ] is ineligible to receive a [LOC US  ] visa , and [LOC US  ] ambassadors here have chosen not to meet with him formally , though there are occasional informal conversations . 
( NOTE: Dep . 
[PER Maninha  ] told us that her group would be " understanding " if Amb . 
[PER Foley  ] chooses not to meet with Dep . 
[PER Gabeira  ] . 
) While [PER Gabeira  ] is serious in conversation and his views are respected in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] , given the context , post suggests that he not be included in Embassy [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] meetings with this delegation .
