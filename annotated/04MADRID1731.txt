( C ) [ORG DCM  ] paid an initial call May 10 on MFA State Secretary [PER Bernadino Leon  ] , who said this was his first meeting SIPDIS with a foreign embassy since taking office . 
[PER Leon  ] made a point of saying that the new government wanted to have excellent relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , especially on counter-terrorism in light of March 11 .

( C ) [PER Leon  ] also said [LOC Spain  ] was considering sending a [PER Guardia Civil/police  ] contingent to [LOC Haiti  ] to help train the police and contribute to democratization there .

( C ) On [MISC Iraq/UNSC  ] resolution , [PER Leon  ] reconfirmed that [LOC Spain  ] was not pursuing a parallel draft with [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] , but noted [LOC Spain  ] could be helpful with these two countries as discussion progressed , as well as with the [MISC Latin Americans  ] now on the [MISC UNSC  ] ( [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] ) . 
He averred that [LOC Spain  ] would adopt a " completely cooperative " approach on this issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .

[PER Leon  ] agreed that he and [ORG DCM  ] should maintain a regular dialogue and open lines of communication. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG DCM  ] also took the opportunity to ask about [LOC Spain  ] 's plans regarding its Embassy in [LOC Iraq  ] after June 30 ( reftel ) . 
[PER Leon  ] replied that the GOS might consider elevating the [MISC Spanish  ] Charge to the rank of Ambassador . 
[PER Leon  ] said he would take this under consideration. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) At the close of the meeting , [PER Leon  ] noted that difficult issues like the [MISC Couso  ] case ( the [MISC Spanish  ] cameraman killed during gunfire in the [LOC Palestine Hotel  ] incident last year and a major cause celebre here ) , would have to be dealt with but could wait until an appropriate time . 
He reiterated his desire for open contacts and said he wanted to invite [ORG DCM  ] to lunch in the near future. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Leon  ] 's professed desire for good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] echoes sentiments we have heard from many in the new government -- and also parallels the lack of specific details on concrete cooperation .
