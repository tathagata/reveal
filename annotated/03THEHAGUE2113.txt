THE HAGUE 1146 Classified By: Acting Economic Counselor [PER Todd Kushner  ] . 
Reason 1.5 ( b ) a nd ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) The [ORG GONL  ] has responded to the August 19 suicide attack in [LOC Jerusalem  ] by calling on fellow [ORG EU  ] members and the [ORG EU Commission  ] ( via diplomatic demarche ) to convene the [ORG EU  ] clearinghouse as quickly as possible in order to move forward with designating [ORG Hamas  ] . 
Because large numbers of [MISC European  ] officials are still on summer holidays , the [MISC Dutch  ] do not expect a clearinghouse meeting to be convened before early September , but they think it is important to attempt to jumpstart the process . 
Key to getting a positive [ORG EU  ] decision on [ORG Hamas  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] officials noted , will largely depend on the positions taken by [LOC France  ] and [LOC Belgium  ] . 
Those member states who may want to continue holding up the [ORG Hamas  ] designation , these officials speculated , may try to argue that the suicide bombing was not a breech of the ceasefire by [ORG Hamas  ] but retaliation by [ORG Hamas  ] for [MISC Israeli  ] ceasefire violations . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] reject this argument. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Presidential announcement will be sufficient to ensure the [MISC Hamas-related  ] designations of August 21 can be considered by the clearinghouse , according to the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
The case against each of the individuals and entities would be considered separately . 
However , the willlingness of some [ORG EU  ] members to move forward will depend on the quality of information in each individual dossier . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] expect that any [ORG EU  ] designations of [ORG Hamas  ] charities operating in [LOC Europe  ] will be challenged in court by those designated. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] officials were pleased by the [LOC U.S.  ] indication ( ref a ) that we do not want charitable activity in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories to cease and that we want to explore ways to ensure humanitarian assistance to the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories can continue to flow . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] has previously stressed the importance it places on this point ( ref b , c ) and would like to actively engage with us to find ways for humanitarian assistance to flow . 
They have also indicated to us the need to work with the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] and international financial community to ensure stricter control of all funds going into [MISC Palestinian  ] territory , including through wire transfers .
