REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Dr. [PER Abdelkarem Mgeg  ] , who until early this year had been Director of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Tajura Nuclear Research Center  ] ( [ORG TNRC  ] ) , was suddenly replaced in late January . 
In a recent meeting , [PER Mgeg  ] said he was happy to not be working on " anything nuclear " and is developing a " strategic roadmap " for [LOC Libya  ] 's fledgling alternative energy sector ; he hopes to attract [LOC U.S.  ] investors and to pull others ( in [LOC Libya  ] ) along with good ideas for alternative energy applications . 
[PER Mgeg  ] also outlined the new organizational chart of [LOC Libya  ] 's nuclear and energy establishment . 
While it is unfortunate that [PER Mgeg  ] was moved out of the [ORG TNRC  ] ( he was one of post 's most energetic interlocutors ) , his lack of political sway had hampered his ability to engage effectively on more politically-charged issues , such as securing visas for visiting [LOC U.S.  ] technical experts . 
His denouement is an important reminder that we need to engage the Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) at both he working and senior policy levels , even on technical programs , to ensure that there is the requisite political approval for proposed cooperation programs . 
End summary . 
FORMER NUCLEAR CENTER DIRECTOR NOW WORKING FULL-TIME ON ALTERNATIVE ENERGY 2 . 
( C ) On May 19 , [PER Econoff  ] met with Dr. [PER Abdelkarem Mgeg  ] , who until recently , was director of the [ORG TNRC  ] . 
In January , post learned that [PER Mgeg  ] had been replaced by Dr. [PER Ahmed  ] al-Habrush . 
At the time , [PER Mgeg  ] told the P/E Chief that he planned to be engaged in a combination of " consulting work " with [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Atomic Energy Establishment  ] ( [ORG LAEE  ] ) and " private business " . 
In his more recent meeting with [PER EconOff  ] , [PER Mgeg  ] said he was happy to not be working on " anything nuclear " and was developing a " strategic roadmap " for [LOC Libya  ] 's fledgling alternative energy sector . 
While [PER Mgeg  ] still technically reports to Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , Director of the [ORG LAEE  ] , he appears to be working independently and has set up an office at [LOC Tripoli  ] 's [ORG International Exhibition Center  ] . 
His office was supposed to be co-located with [PER Gashut  ] 's in the [ORG LAEE  ] 's headquarters , but he had refused to avoid being " bothered by menial administrative tasks " . 
[PER Mgeg  ] , who holds a PhD in Electronics from [ORG UCLA  ] , started in 2007 as general manager of the then-Renewable Energies and [ORG Water Desalination Research Center  ] ( [ORG REWDRC  ] ) and [ORG Nuclear Research Center  ] at [LOC Tajura  ] . 
( Note: Since [PER Mgeg  ] 's departure , the center has reverted to its previous name , the [ORG Tajura Nuclear Research Center  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Mgeg  ] was replaced by al-Habrush in part because he was perceived to have worked too independently and had not kept [PER Gashut  ] ( his supervisor ) informed of his activities. xxxxxxxxxxxx [PER Mgeg  ] , who enjoys a reputation as a more future-focused thinker , explained that he is working on a strategic plan for [LOC Libya  ] for the next 30-40 years . 
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART FOR THE [ORG LAEE  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Mgeg  ] outlined the organizational chart of the newly-restructured nuclear and energy establishment which is comprised of three divisions , all answering to the [ORG LAEE  ] , which is headed by [PER Gashut  ] . 
[PER Gashut  ] in turn reports directly to Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi . 
The divisions [ORG include: Chemical Engineering  ] ( with the [ORG Petrochemical Institute  ] ) headed by Dr. [PER Mansour  ] ( no first name given ) ; the [ORG Tajura Nuclear Center  ] , headed by Dr. [PER Ahmed  ] al-Habrush ; and the [ORG Alternative Energy Research Center  ] , headed by Dr. [PER Salem Ghurbal  ] . 
Although [PER Mgeg  ] is working on alternative energy , he reports directly to [PER Gashut  ] instead of thruogh Dr. [PER Ghurbal  ] . 
[PER Ghurbal  ] is responsible for research projects in alternative energy whereas he ( [PER Mgeg  ] ) is working on [LOC Libya  ] 's strategic roadmap for pursuing alternative energy. xxxxxxxxxxxx He characterized his relationship with [PER Gashut  ] as still " friendly " , but conceded that some underlying tensions clearly remain . 
[PER Mgeg  ] said he preferred to work on technical matters and was not interested in a political job . 
( Note: In a separate meeting , we learned that Dr. [PER Mohammad Ennami  ] , formerly science advisor to the Secretary for Infrastructure [PER Matuq Matuq  ] , is now [PER Gashut  ] 's deputy at the [ORG LAEE  ] . 
End note ) . 
PUSHING FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In his new position , [PER Mgeg  ] said one of his goals is to attract [LOC U.S.  ] investors to the alternative energy sector . 
He explained his task was to " pull " others in [LOC Libya  ] along with good ideas ( rather than pushing them ) , and to persuade them to embrace new alternative energy technologies . 
He argued that new technologies may be expensive now , but in the long run , the cost will decrease due to increased efficiencies , whereas the price [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000437 002.2 OF 002 of oil will always fluctuate . 
[LOC Libya  ] should husband its hydrocarbon resources for export and should begin producing more power from alternative energy sources . 
He noted [LOC Libya  ] has tremendous potential in solar and wind power and could contribute to the power needs of the entire [MISC Mediterranean  ] area . 
[MISC American  ] companies and universities are welcome to come to [LOC Libya  ] and do conduct research and help train [LOC Libya  ] 's next generation of specialized engineers . 
He thought in 30 years , the alternative energy sector would be " big , " including a 1,000 megawatt wind-powered electricity station . 
He noted that there are already plans to build a 15 megawatt combined solar/hydro plant in [LOC Sirte  ] , and a [MISC German  ] firm was conducting a feasibility study for the project . 
[PER Mgeg  ] expressed admiration for [LOC Germany  ] , which produces 20 per cent of its energy needs through alternative sources . 
He cited [MISC German  ] laws and tax credits as important factors in meeting this goal. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Mgeg  ] plans to organize an international conference on alternative energy that would bring together decision-makers , investors and scholars , and asked for Post 's help in attracting [MISC American  ] participants . 
He cautioned , however , the conference had not yet been officially-approved on the [MISC Libyan  ] side . 
[PER Mgeg  ] also asked for help in identifying examples of good environmental laws from the [LOC U.S.  ] that he could use in recommending new environmental laws for [LOC Libya.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: It is unfortunate , but telling , that [PER Mgeg  ] was moved to sidelines . 
One of post 's most energetic interlocutors in terms of scientific and technical cooperation , he eschewed the stifling official [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucray and was in direct contact with [LOC U.S.  ] scientists and officials . 
As an example , he never required formal permission from Protocol officials for Emboffs to accompany other [ORG USG  ] visitors to the [ORG Tajura Nuclear Research Center  ] . 
By contrast , during a recent visit by [ORG DOE  ] experts to [LOC Tajura  ] , [PER Mgeg  ] 's successor did not allow [PER Econoff  ] to enter the facility since prior permission had not been granted ( although we had sent a formal request , we had never received an answer ) . 
On the other hand , [PER Mgeg  ] was not always successful in obtaining visa approvals for would-be [ORG USG  ] experts , which may have reflected his lack of political sway . 
He himself admitted that he was not interested in playing the political games that feature so prominently here . 
Elevating Muhammad [PER Ennami  ] to serve as [PER Gashut  ] 's deputy reflects the fact that in [LOC Libya  ] , formal title is often less important than personal political contacts . 
We expect [PER Ennami  ] to continue to play an important behind-the-scenes role in [LOC Libya  ] 's nuclear affairs . 
[PER Mgeg  ] 's departure from the [ORG TNRC  ] is an important reminder that Post and other [ORG USG  ] actors need to engage the [MISC Libyans  ] at both the working and policy ( i.e. , [PER Gashut  ] ) levels to ensure that there is political approval for proposed cooperation programs .
