( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Iceland  ] 's parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution on May 30 calling for the closure of the [LOC U.S.  ] detention facility at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] . 
The resolution further called for the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] to convey that message to the [LOC U.S.  ] government ; [LOC Iceland  ] 's Foreign Minister did so later that day during her meeting with visiting Secretary of State Rice . 
Given the timing , news of the resolution and the issue of [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] dominated the press coverage of the Secretary 's visit . 
Some media -- implicitly criticizing the FM -- have since speculated that the resolution and its timing irritated the [LOC U.S.  ] enough to scuttle hopes of [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG UN Security Council  ] bid . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In the early morning hours of May 30 , the [ORG Althingi  ] ( [ORG Icelandic Parliament  ] ) unanimously voted in favor of a non-binding resolution which calls for the closure of the [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detention facility . 
The resolution cites the " inhumane treatment of prisoners " as a justification to close the facility . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is also charged with communicating the position of the [ORG Althingi  ] to [LOC U.S.  ] authorities , according to the resolution . 
( Full resolution text para . 
8 . 
) All political parties represented in the [ORG Althingi  ] supported the resolution , which led to a vote of 52 in favor , zero opposing , and 11 not present . 
Nine parliamentarians sponsored the bill , all of whom belong to the [ORG Left-Green Party of Iceland  ] . 
The [ORG Althingi  ] Foreign Affairs [ORG Committee  ] approved the resolution on May 28 , sending the resolution to a full floor vote the following day. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although the resolution passed on the eve of Secretary [PER Rice  ] 's visit , this timing seemed more a function of the legislative calendar than an effort to send a political message . 
The resolution was originally introduced in February and had been lingering in the [ORG Althingi  ] since then , until the legislature 's last-week sprint to finish its work before the summer recess beginning on May 30 . 
However , the timing ensured that [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] would be a central issue in coverage of the visit . 
( [ORG Comment: Ministry  ] contacts have confirmed to post that they failed to realize how much the issue would overwhelm other reporting on the visit and as such had not tried to intervene in the legislative calendar . 
End Comment . 
) Press and blog speculation about whether or not Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] would present the Secretary with a copy of the resolution began immediately after the Foreign Affairs [ORG Committee  ] vote on May 28 . 
That said , the final text incorporated several amendments softening the language to remove a description of the [LOC Guantanamo  ] facility 's operations as " illegal " and eliminating a call for the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] to work in international fora towards the facility 's closure. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) FM [PER Gisladottir  ] raised [ORG Guantanamo  ] with Secretary [PER Rice  ] during their May 30 meeting and passed a copy of the resolution to the Secretary ( reftel ) . 
In her comments to the press afterwards , FM [PER Gisladottir  ] confirmed that she did indeed bring up concerns about [LOC Guantanamo  ] while meeting with the Secretary . 
When asked about the resolution by the press , Secretary [PER Rice  ] stated that she strongly objected to the notion that there are human rights violations occurring at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] . 
The Secretary also noted that returning inmates to their country of origin is quite complicated . 
She added that there have been instances of former detainees engaging in attacks on [LOC US  ] forces and innocent civilians . 
Finally , Secretary [PER Rice  ] suggested that members of the [ORG Althingi  ] read the [ORG OSCE Parliamentary Committee  ] report on [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] . 
( Full press conference transcript: http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/05/105 447.htm ) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As expected , [MISC Icelandic  ] press coverage of the Secretary 's visit was heavily focused on the [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] resolution . 
Most print articles mentioned that FM [PER Gisladottir  ] provided Secretary [PER Rice  ] with a copy of the resolution ; most also noted the Secretary 's rebuttal of the charge of human rights abuses at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] . 
In response , a June 2 editorial in daily paper of record [LOC Morgunbladid  ] entitled , " Condescending [PER Rice  ] , " stated that Secretary [PER Rice  ] had a condescending attitude toward the [ORG Althingi  ] 's resolution. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) More provocatively , a June 9 editorial comment in [LOC Morgunbladid  ] claimed that Secretary [PER Rice  ] was angry and caught off guard by the resolution . 
The article went on to say that the relationship between the Secretary and the Foreign Minister was greatly damaged due to this resolution , and speculated that as a result the [LOC U.S.  ] might not support [LOC Iceland  ] in elections to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] this fall . 
Ambassador immediately communicated to the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) that this story was in no way sourced from [ORG USG  ] participants in the meeting . 
Separately , the [ORG MFA  ] 's Counsellor for [ORG Human Rights  ] issues told Pol Chief that the resolution was " silly " and did not offer a useful contribution to the debate about how international law should handle the detainees or similar cases . 
This tendency to focus on the emotional principle of closing [ORG Guantanamo  ] rather than the legal issue of the detainees' cases was [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000115 002 OF 002 reinforced in the scant local coverage ( mostly translated wire reports ) of the [ORG U.S. Supreme Court  ] 's ruling on June 12 in [LOC Boumedine  ] v. [LOC Bush.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Detainees at [LOC Guantanamo  ] continue to be a hot topic here , and as elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] there is a broad consensus that the detention facility should be closed , with no critical examination of how the law should best deal with the detainees' cases . 
In this climate the [ORG Althingi  ] 's unanimous vote on the resolution was nearly inevitable . 
However , as the June 9 editorial comment indicates , all news is local , and some have seized upon the issue as a chance to criticize the [ORG MFA  ] for allegedly sloppy handling of [LOC Iceland  ] 's foreign affairs . 
One further wrinkle is the possibility -- which post deems unlikely -- that the June 9 piece was intended to criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] for being overly sensitive on the [LOC Guantanamo  ] issue . 
Nonetheless , we have since seized every opportunity to both point out that the Secretary 's conversation with FM [PER Gisladottir  ] was simply a frank talk between allies as well as encourage a sincere discussion of the complex legal principles involved . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Text of [ORG Althingi  ] resolution: The [ORG Althingi  ] condemns the inhumane treatment of prisoners at the [LOC US  ] detention camp at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , urges that the camp be closed and charges the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] to communicate this position to the [LOC US  ] authorities .
