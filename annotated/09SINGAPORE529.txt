End Summary . 
[LOC China  ] and [ORG North  ] [LOC Korea  ] --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Deputy Secretary [PER Steinberg  ] met with [LOC Singapore  ] Minister [PER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew  ] on May 30 on the margins of the [ORG Shangri-La Dialogue  ] , the annual international security forum held in [LOC Singapore  ] . 
The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] to stress the importance of [MISC Chinese  ] cooperation in addressing the [LOC North Korea  ] nuclear issue and to elicit [ORG MM  ] Lee’s views on [LOC China  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said the [MISC Chinese  ] do not want [LOC North Korea  ] to have nuclear weapons . 
At the same time , the [MISC Chinese  ] do not want [LOC North Korea  ] , which [LOC China  ] sees as a buffer state , to collapse . 
The [ORG ROK  ] would take over in the [ORG North and China  ] would face a [LOC U.S.  ] presence at its border . 
If [LOC China  ] has to choose , [LOC Beijing  ] sees a [LOC North Korea  ] with nuclear weapons as less bad for [LOC China  ] than a [LOC North Korea  ] that has collapsed , he stated. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said he asked Deputy Chief of the [ORG People’s Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG PLA  ] ) General [PER Staff Ma Xiaotian  ] what [LOC China  ] can do about [LOC North Korea  ] . 
General Ma’s [LOC Delphic  ] answer was that “they can survive on their own.” [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said he interpreted this as meaning that even if [LOC China  ] cut off aid , the [ORG DPRK  ] leadership would survive . 
This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing [ORG ROK  ] Cabinet Members in [LOC Burma  ] and shooting down a [ORG KAL  ] flight . 
If they lose power , they will end up facing justice at The [PER Hague  ] , like [PER Milosevic  ] . 
They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends , not even [LOC Russia  ] . 
They have not trusted [LOC China  ] since the [MISC Chinese  ] began cultivating ties with the [ORG ROK  ] , given [MISC China’s  ] interest in attracting foreign investment , he said . 
The Deputy Secretary noted that the [ORG DPRK  ] could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach . 
If not , [LOC North Korea  ] faces a change of course by the [LOC United States  ] , the [ORG ROK  ] and [LOC Japan  ] . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] expressed worry about the effect on [LOC Iran  ] if the [ORG DPRK  ] persists . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said he believes the [ORG DPRK  ] can be contained and will not proliferate , but [LOC Iran  ] has very high ambitions , ties to Shiite communities outside [LOC Iran  ] , and oil wealth. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) The Deputy Secretary noted that [ORG North Korea’s  ] decisions will have an impact in [LOC Japan  ] . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said he believes [LOC Japan  ] may well “go nuclear.” The [MISC Chinese  ] must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of [LOC Japan  ] with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing [LOC North Korea  ] as a buffer state . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK’s current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership , with new thinking . 
But there will still be a [LOC North Korea  ] , he said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said he wishes the [ORG USG  ] well in its efforts on [LOC North Korea  ] , but he would be surprised if the [LOC North Koreans  ] agree to give up nuclear weapons . 
They might give up a first-strike capacity , but they want nuclear weapons in case the [ORG USG  ] decides to seek regime change . 
They are psychopathic types , with a “flabby old chap” for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of [MISC Japanese  ] occupation in [LOC Singapore  ] that people will obey authorities who can deny them food , clothing and medicine. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said the [ORG ROK  ] , after seeing what had happened with [MISC German  ] unification , does not want immediate unification with the [ORG DPRK  ] . 
There is “nothing there” in the [ORG DPRK  ] , other than a military organization . 
[PER Kim Jong-Il  ] has already had a stroke . 
It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke . 
The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather . 
He may not be prepared to see people die like flies . 
[LOC China  ] is calculating all this . 
They have their best men on the job . 
They want to help the [LOC United States  ] to advance common objectives . 
But they do not want the [LOC South  ] to take over the [LOC North  ] , [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Economy --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Regarding the [MISC Chinese  ] economy , [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said the global economic crisis has hit many countries , but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] economy is reportedly in the doldrums , but when [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] visited [LOC Jiangsu Province  ] on May 24 , his impression was one of continued prosperity . 
[LOC Shanghai  ] has been harder hit , with container port traffic down 30-35 percent , similar to the situation in [LOC Singapore  ] . 
There is no sign of deep unrest in [LOC China  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth . 
The government is pumping resources into the economy , with a focus on developing [LOC Western China  ] . 
Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear , but [LOC China  ] can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year , he said. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] stated that in the absence of a social safety net in [LOC China  ] , the [MISC Chinese  ] savings rate is 55 percent , exceeding even Singapore’s 50 percent level . 
Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of [MISC Chinese  ] GDP , as opposed to 70 percent of [LOC U.S.  ] GDP . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy , but the leadership will do so temporarily , if only to avoid unrest . 
20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations . 
The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition . 
The pragmatists are in charge . 
There is nothing [MISC Communist  ] about it . 
They just want to preserve one party rule . 
The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current [MISC Chinese  ] policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said this cannot be helped . 
[LOC China  ] wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in [LOC Guangzhou  ] in March when [MISC Hong Kong-connected  ] enterprises suddenly shut down , he said . 
[LOC Taiwan  ] ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary asked [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] for his assessment of [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said former President [PER Chen Shui-bian  ] had left [LOC Taiwan  ] in a weak economic position , which had enabled President [PER Ma Ying-Jeou  ] to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with [LOC China  ] . 
In [LOC Beijing  ] , former President [PER Jiang Zemin  ] was wedded to his eight-point approach , but President [PER Hu Jintao  ] was more flexible . 
[PER Jiang  ] wanted to show he was a great man by solving the [LOC Taiwan  ] issue in his lifetime , but [PER Hu  ] is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline . 
In [MISC Chinese  ] domestic politics , [PER Hu  ] had wanted Vice Premier [PER Li Keqiang  ] from the [ORG Communist Youth League  ] to emerge as his successor , not Vice President [PER Xi Jinping  ] , but [PER Hu  ] did his calculations and accepted [PER Xi  ] when it became clear that [PER Xi  ] had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership . 
Similarly , on [LOC Taiwan  ] , [PER Hu  ] will be pragmatic . 
It does not matter to [PER Hu  ] if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30 . 
The key is building links with [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
As in the case of [LOC Hong Kong  ] , if necessary the tap could be turned off , he said. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In this context , [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said , [PER Hu  ] could live with [MISC Ma’s  ] positions on the ‘92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office . 
What mattered to [PER Hu  ] was that [LOC Taiwan  ] not seek independence . 
If that happened , [LOC China  ] has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the [LOC U.S.  ] fleet at a distance . 
The implicit question for [MISC Taiwan’s  ] leaders is if that is what they want , [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] stated that the alternative is [LOC Mainland  ] investment in [LOC Taiwan  ] stocks and property . 
The [LOC Mainland  ] has already assured [LOC Hong Kong  ] that it will help out economically . 
The [LOC Mainland  ] has not said this to [LOC Taiwan  ] , but the [ORG Mainland’s Taiwan Affairs  ] Director , [PER Wang Yi  ] , did urge [MISC Chinese  ] companies to invest in [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
In four years [MISC Taiwan’s  ] economy will pick up and [LOC Ma  ] will win re-election . 
The [ORG DPP  ] lacks strong potential candidates . 
[PER Su Zhen-chang  ] is promising , but seems unlikely to be able to win . 
Meanwhile , even the traditionally [MISC DPP-supporting  ] farmers in [LOC Taiwan’s South  ] need China’s market for vegetables and other products . 
[MISC Taiwan’s  ] continued participation in the [ORG World Health Assembly  ] depends on [LOC Beijing  ] . 
Beijing’s calculation seems to be to prevent [LOC Taiwan  ] independence in the near term , then bring [LOC Taiwan  ] “back to [LOC China  ] , ” even if it takes 40 or 50 years . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said he is looking forward to visiting [LOC Fujian Province  ] , where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
[PER Xi Jinping  ] ---------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like [PER Xi Jinping  ] would continue the policies on [LOC Taiwan  ] followed by [PER Hu Jintao  ] . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] responded affirmatively . 
[PER Xi  ] is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated . 
When the party needed his talents , [PER Xi  ] was brought in as [ORG Shanghai Party  ] Secretary . 
[PER Xi  ] is seen as a [PER Jiang Zemin  ] protege , but in another three and a half years Jiang’s influence will be gone . 
The focus now is on maintaining the system . 
There are no more strongmen like [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] . 
[PER Jiang  ] did not like [PER Hu  ] , but could not stop him , because [PER Hu  ] had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes . 
[PER Wang Qishan  ] ----------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said Vice Premier [PER Wang Qishan  ] , whom the [ORG MM  ] saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of [ORG Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park  ] , is an exceptional talent , very assured and efficient . 
[PER Wang  ] handled SARS superbly when he was in [LOC Hainan  ] . 
He excelled in coordinating the [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Olympics  ] . 
[PER Li Keqiang  ] may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep [PER Wang  ] on past his 65th birthday until he is 70 . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said he had met first [PER Wang  ] back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting . 
This time when they met , [PER Wang  ] told [PER Lee  ] he had reviewed the records of all [ORG Lee’s  ] meeting with [MISC Chinese  ] leaders going back to the days of [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] to see how [ORG Lee’s  ] thinking had developed . 
[PER Wang  ] told [PER Lee  ] he respects him as a consistent man . 
China’s Rise ------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said [LOC China  ] is following an approach consistent with ideas in the [MISC Chinese  ] television series “The Rise of [LOC Great Powers.”  ] The mistake of [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Japan  ] had been their effort to challenge the existing order . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] are not stupid ; they have avoided this mistake . 
China’s economy has surpassed other countries , with the exceptions of [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
Even with those two countries , the gap is closing , with [LOC China  ] growing at seven-nine percent annually , versus two-three percent in the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Japan  ] . 
Overall GDP , not GDP per capita , is what matters in terms of power . 
[LOC China  ] has four times the population of the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC China  ] is active in [LOC Latin America  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , and in the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
Within hours , everything that is discussed in [MISC ASEAN  ] meetings is known in [LOC Beijing  ] , given China’s close ties with [LOC Laos  ] , [LOC Cambodia  ] , and [LOC Burma  ] , he stated. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said [LOC China  ] will not reach the [MISC American  ] level in terms of military capabilities any time soon , but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter [LOC U.S.  ] military power . 
[LOC China  ] understands that its growth depends on imports , including energy , raw materials , and food . 
This is why [LOC China  ] is working with [LOC South Africa  ] on the [ORG China-Africa Development Fund  ] . 
[LOC China  ] also needs open sea lanes . 
[LOC Beijing  ] is worried about its dependence on the [ORG Strait of Malacca  ] and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through [LOC Burma  ] . 
Build Ties with Young [MISC Chinese  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] said the best course for the [LOC United States  ] on [LOC China  ] is to build ties with China’s young people . 
China’s best and brightest want to study in the [LOC United States  ] , with the [LOC UK  ] as the next option , then [LOC Japan  ] . 
While they are there , it is important that they be treated as equals , with the cultural support they may need as foreigners . 
Why not have [ORG International Military Education and Training  ] ( [ORG IMET  ] ) programs for [LOC China  ] ? 
Why not have [MISC Chinese  ] cadets at [LOC West Point  ] alongside [MISC Vietnamese  ] cadets and [MISC Indian  ] cadets ? 
America’s advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world , as in [LOC Silicon Valley  ] . 
[LOC China  ] still tends to try to keep the foreigners in [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Shanghai  ] . 
[ORG MM  ] [PER Lee  ] noted that his own experience as a student in the [LOC UK  ] had left him with an enduring fondness for the [LOC UK  ] . 
When he spent two months at [ORG Harvard  ] in 1968 , an [MISC American  ] professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving . 
This was not the sort of thing that happened in the [LOC UK  ] , and [PER Lee  ] had realized he was dealing with a different civilization . 
In the future , China’s leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from [MISC American  ] universities , he predicted. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Deputy Secretary has cleared this message .
