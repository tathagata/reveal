( [ORG SBU  ] ) KEY POINTS -- [LOC Egypt  ] 's Tax Commissioner expects the implementation of the new real estate law to proceed without significant alternations . 
-- He claims that much of the public resistance to filing property declarations is rooted in people 's desire to maintain the secrecy of their wealth , which has traditionally been held in real estate . 
-- [LOC Egypt  ] 's tax revenue is down substantially from last year , but appears to be on track to meet budgetary expectations . 
-- No new tax laws are expected to be presented to the Parliament prior to the upcoming parliamentary and presidential election cycles , but the [ORG Tax Authority  ] will continue working to automate its systems and improve data collection in support of expanding and deepening the tax base. --------------------------------------------- ------------------- Real Estate Tax Law Unchanged --------------------------------------------- ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a February 7 meeting , [PER Ashraf Al Arabi  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] 's Deputy Minister of Finance for Tax Policy and Commissioner of the [ORG Egyptian Tax Authority  ] , told us that he was confident that implementation of the real estate tax would go ahead as scheduled ( ref A ) . 
He acknowledged the negative publicity surrounding the registration of properties , which had " created anxiety " among taxpayers . 
Despite this , he was confident that the plan would move forward with " no official changes . 
" Referencing President [PER Mubarak  ] 's comments last month , in which [PER Mubarak  ] suggested he might advocate for a progressive tax structure or possible homestead exemption , [PER Al Arabi  ] told us that the real estate tax situation had subsequently " been clarified to the President " and that [PER Mubarak  ] supported leaving the law intact. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Al Arabi  ] explained that there were a number of reasons for the public outcry against the real estate tax: Since most income tax is paid through direct payroll deductions , the vast majority of taxpayers in [LOC Egypt  ] have no experience dealing directly with the [ORG Tax Authority  ] ( Note: for taxpayers who have income tax deducted by their employer , there is no annual tax filing requirement . 
End note ) . 
His office , [PER Al Arabi  ] said , deals directly with only about 3.1 million corporate and self-employed tax filers . 
The new real estate tax registration requirement will now bring 40 million [MISC Egyptians  ] in contact with the [ORG Tax Authority  ] . 
He added that part of the outcry relates to people 's resistance to disclosing their real estate holdings . 
According to [PER Al Arabi  ] , [MISC Egyptians  ] have traditionally used real estate as their primary store of wealth , and people do not want information on their assets disclosed to the government or made public . 
This echoes his public comments suggesting that once holdings are declared , some people , particularly government employees , might find it difficult to explain where they got the resources to buy the properties they own. --------------------------------------------- ------------------- Revenues on Track , But [MISC Reforms Have Slowed  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In [LOC Egypt  ] 's fiscal 2009/10 budget , tax revenues are projected at LE 145.5 billion ( [MISC US$26.5  ] billion ) down 10.8% from last year . 
Actual tax revenues during the first six month of the fiscal year ( July-December ) are down 8.5% . 
Tax revenues from the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG General Petroleum Corporation  ] ( [ORG EGPC  ] ) , the state-owned oil company , which were budgeted to drop 45% due to lower world oil prices are actually running about 6% lower than the already reduced budget forecast . 
With the exception of the [ORG EGPC  ] revenue , [PER Al Arabi  ] asserted that revenues will meet projections and that the shortfall from [ORG EGPC  ] taxes could be made up by better than expected revenues from taxes on treasury bills and bonds , which are taxable for the first time this year. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Al Arabi  ] said that the onset of the financial crisis in 2008 stalled well-advanced plans to replace the sales and consumption taxes with a unified Value Added Tax ( VAT ) , and that he did not envision much progress in that area until after the 2010 Parliamentary elections and the 2011 Presidential election . 
He explained that some articles of the new law might still be passed even if the complete reform could not yet be addressed. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Al Arabi  ] told us that tax collection procedures had improved substantially , particularly for corporate taxpayers , and that the GOE had made progress in closing loopholes and incentives for tax evasion . 
Tax preparers are now jointly liable with their clients for information provided in tax returns . 
This has removed much of the incentive for accountants to evade rather than comply with the law . 
He said that the [ORG Tax Authority  ] still has major compliance issues with small and mid-sized businesses , many of whom deal strictly in cash and lack many of the formal legal and accounting structures that would aid in tax collection . 
He estimated that the government 's tax revenues currently amount to 13-14% of GDP , but that by taxing the large informal economy , this could rise to 20%. --------------------------------------------- ------------------- Improvements in [ORG Data Collection  ] Are the Key --------------------------------------------- ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) El [PER Arabi  ] , who has been in his current position for a little less than three years , comes from a private sector accounting and auditing background . 
He stated that the reorganization he has done in the [ORG Tax Authority  ] has proven difficult . 
He pointed to the example of consolidating the 64 " tax regions " that had previously existed into the 15 regions that exist today . 
This consolidation removed a great deal of redundant bureaucracy , but also limited promotion possibilities for [ORG Tax Authority  ] employees . 
He said successes in automation and segmentation meant that the [ORG Tax Authority  ] was " no longer a soft administration " within the government. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Al Arabi  ] credited [LOC US  ] assistance through USAID with much of the progress in both automation and training within the [ORG Tax Authority  ] . 
He added that further progress in tax collection will be reliant on the quality of information gathered and the proper analysis of that data . 
He said he plans to create an " internal inspection unit " and will build an " intelligence center " for data collection and verification. ------------- Comment ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Lower revenues and higher budget deficits remain a worry both for [MISC Egyptian  ] policy makers and the rest of the financial community . 
[LOC Egypt  ] does , however , appear to be on track to meet its tax revenue projections for the year . 
As reported septel , the spending side of the equation is less promising , as greater than expected expenditures on subsidy programs and fiscal stimulus packages continue to put a strain on the overall budget . 
Public discontent with many of the measures proposed by Finance Minister [PER Youssef Boutros Ghali  ] , including the real estate tax , continues to be reflected in the press and among some members of the Parliament . 
However , all indications are that [PER Boutros Ghali  ] continues to have the support of the President , and the much needed fiscal reforms he has been promoting will continue , though perhaps at a slower pace .
