( C ) Summary: In his first meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] since the formation of the new government , State Secretary for Defense [PER Cees van der Knaap  ] acknowledged the [ORG GONL  ] will make a decision on extending in [LOC Afghanistan  ] by the end of the summer -- but his instincts tell him the [MISC Dutch  ] will remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province in a reduced role . 
He positively described relations with the [LOC United States  ] , especially regarding continued [MISC Dutch  ] involvement with the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
However , several issues -- noise pollution from [ORG NATO  ] [MISC AWACS  ] aircraft , the [MISC C-17  ] strategic airlift initiative , and some defense investment projects like [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Air Ground Surveillance  ] ( [ORG AGS  ] ) program and the acquisition of tactical [MISC Tomahawk  ] missiles -- remain troublesome . 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] discussed these issues with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] on April <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
End summary . 
[ORG Afghanistan: Extension Decision  ] Looming --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] briefly addressed [LOC Afghanistan  ] , noting that due to reduced helicopter and engineering support , it will be very difficult to continue the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province in its current capacity beyond the two-year commitment ending in July 2008 . 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] said the Cabinet will make a decision on possibly extending by the end of the summer , but added that his instincts told him the [MISC Dutch  ] would stay in a reduced role . 
Getting to this decision will not be easy , he said . 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] was confident that Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] will fight to extend , but the government coalition member [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) -- including specifically Finance Minister and [ORG Labor Party  ] leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] -- does not support continuing the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
" " And [PER Bos  ] holds the purse strings " " to a possible extension , van der [PER Knaap  ] said . 
[MISC AWACS  ] Re-Engining: The Sound and the Fury ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] said he continues to face stiff questioning from the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament on finding a solution to noise caused by [ORG NATO  ] Airborne Warning and [ORG Control System  ] ( [MISC AWACS  ] ) E-3 aircraft from the airbase just across the border in [LOC Geilenkirchen  ] , [LOC Germany  ] . 
He said on a scale of one to ten , with ten being the worst problem currently facing the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] , [MISC AWACS  ] noise pollution rated an eight . 
[MISC Parliamentarians  ] constantly demand the [ORG GONL  ] refuse [MISC AWACS  ] aircraft flight permission over the [LOC Netherlands  ] , he lamented . 
To date , he has successfully argued that would do more harm to [MISC Dutch  ] credibility within the alliance than the good it would afford [MISC Dutch  ] inhabitants nearby [LOC Geilenkirchen  ] -- but even that was becoming more difficult. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] said Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] will raise [MISC AWACS  ] noise pollution with his colleagues at this year 's defense ministerial . 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] argued that with the possible exception of moving the base -- which would be cost prohibitive -- the only noise reduction option the [MISC Dutch  ] see is replacing current [MISC AWACS  ] aircraft engines with a quieter , more efficient engine . 
He noted the possibility of replacing [MISC AWACS  ] engines with those currently being replaced in [MISC JSTARS E-8  ] aircraft or with rebuilt engines coming out of [MISC JSTARS  ] aircraft , but acknowledged that the [MISC Dutch  ] have to research whether such a swap is feasible and economical. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As the largest stakeholder in the [MISC AWACS  ] program , van der [PER Knaap  ] asked if the [ORG USG  ] could support the [MISC Dutch  ] in their bid to " " re-engine " " [MISC AWACS  ] aircraft . 
Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] sympathized but argued that the issue is one for [ORG NATO  ] and not just the [LOC United States  ] -- the [MISC Dutch  ] should make the economic case in favor of re-engining to [ORG NATO  ] . 
He noted no current operational requirement to replace [MISC AWACS  ] aircraft engines , while [ORG USG  ] resources were dedicated to other efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He offered assistance in getting the [MISC Dutch  ] more information regarding the new [MISC JSTAR  ] engines . 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] understood , noting that he had been told the same by Under Secretary of Defense [MISC Edelman  ] last year . 
But the issue was " " not going away " " for the [MISC Dutch  ] , and he intended to raise the issue again when he next visits [LOC Washington  ] . 
JSF: On Track ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] was highly optimistic regarding continued [MISC Dutch  ] participation in the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program , and said he intends to travel to [LOC Washington  ] during the second week in July to sign the program 's [MISC Operational Test and Evaluation  ] MOU . 
He said the [ORG MOD  ] soon will submit a prior permission request to purchase the first of two [ORG JSF  ] test aircraft . 
He pointed to the new government 's coalition accord as a positive signal on [ORG JSF  ] , and stressed that purchasing the plane was one of the government 's main goals . 
Much depends on the independent , third-party review of the program early next year , but he was confident that the review would confirm that [ORG JSF  ] was the best plane for the best price. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] also asked about [ORG USG  ] commitment to the program citing press reports of program budget cuts . 
Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] assured him the [ORG USG  ] was committed and that continual budget discussions between the executive and legislative branches was the norm . 
He promised to provide an update on the status of [LOC U.S.  ] budget discussions concerning [ORG JSF  ] to van der [PER Knaap  ] 's staff . 
[MISC C-17  ] Initiative: Still Not Satisfied ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] reiterated the [ORG GONL  ] 's urgent needs for strategic airlift and expressed appreciation for on-going negotiations at [ORG NATO  ] to reduce the cost associated with the [MISC C-17  ] initiative . 
However , he was frustrated that it was now clear the [MISC Dutch  ] must pay an up-front finance charge despite earlier assurances . 
He doubted the [ORG GONL  ] could afford the 100 million [MISC Euro  ] up-front finance charge as it currently stands , while the 30,000 [MISC Euro  ] cost per flight hour also was prohibitive . 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] believe there is still " " room to maneuver " " to reduce costs , and asked the [ORG USG  ] to consider every possibility in working group negotiations . 
Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] pointed to other obstacles created by [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] regarding the initiative , and commended the [MISC Dutch  ] for their leadership role in the working group deliberations . 
He added that reducing the cost of the initiative also was in the interests of the [ORG USG  ] as a participating nation . 
Defense Budget Cuts: [ORG TACTOM  ] Dead ; [ORG AGS  ] , Too ? ------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] said the [ORG MOD  ] continues to feel the effects of defense budget cuts , and is facing some difficult decisions regarding defense investment projects like [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Air Ground Surveillance  ] ( [ORG AGS  ] ) project or acquiring tactical [MISC Tomahawk  ] ( [ORG TACTOM  ] ) missiles . 
He described [MISC Dutch  ] deliberations over [ORG AGS  ] as " " purely an internal , [MISC Dutch  ] problem " " -- the reduced budget has led to new priorities , and [ORG AGS  ] has fallen victim to political posturing exacerbated by program delays . 
He said there was a 70-80 percent chance the [MISC Dutch  ] will pull out of [ORG AGS  ] ; the [ORG GONL  ] will make a decision by the end of April/early May . 
He was " " ashamed " " the [MISC Dutch  ] may pull out , especially as he claimed the [MISC Dutch  ] were recently instrumental in persuading the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Germans  ] to remain in the program . 
He feared a [MISC Dutch  ] withdrawal may be used as an excuse by [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Berlin  ] to do likewise. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Turning to [ORG TACTOM  ] , van der [PER Knaap  ] described the potential purchase as a " " toy " " of former defense Minister [LOC Kamp  ] . 
" " The current defense minister does not approve of this toy , " " he said . 
He further explained that with the budget cuts and priorities like strategic airlift and [ORG JSF  ] , there was no money for [ORG TACTOM  ] . 
" " On a scale of one to ten , with ten being dead , [ORG TACTOM  ] is an absolute ten , " " he quipped . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] is an experienced politician that successfully brokered his continued role in the new government -- one of only three cabinet members to keep their portfolios . 
It is too early to tell whether van der [PER Knaap  ] and new Defense Minister van [PER Middelkoop  ] have a good working relationship . 
But given van der [PER Knaap  ] 's comments on [ORG TACTOM  ] and [LOC Kamp  ] -- especially as the [ORG TACTOM  ] purchase order was a relatively insignificant amount of approximately USD 60 million -- it appears he is working hard to ensure the relationship with his new boss starts out on the right foot .
