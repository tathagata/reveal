( [ORG SBU  ] ) As reported reftel , MFA A/S-equivalent [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] convoked CDA August 27 to formally request that [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's [ORG Ifriqiyah Airways  ] plane be granted diplomatic clearance -- including full privileges and immunities -- when [PER Qadhafi  ] travels to [LOC New York  ] for the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
Embassy 's informal translation of the diplomatic note follows. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>Â¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Begin  ] translation: The General People 's [ORG Committee for Foreign Liaison  ] and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG Americas Desk  ] ) , sends its compliments to the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in the [LOC Great Jamahiriya  ] , and has the honor to refer to the meeting that took place between the Secretary of the [MISC Libyan  ] People 's [MISC Bureau  ] in [LOC Washington  ] and Ms. [PER Margaret Nardi  ] , Head of [ORG Arab Maghreb Department  ] to discuss details relative to the Leader 's visit to the [LOC United States  ] , and especially the pretexts that she enumerated regarding the difficulty of securing a diplomatic authorization for the plane transporting Brother the Leader and his accompanying delegation , and notably the fact that [ORG Ifriqiyah Airlines  ] is not registered to fly in the [MISC American  ] airspace ; this is unacceptable . 
We hereby emphasize the need to address this issue because the diplomatic authorization is normally offered to the person on board of the plane , and we note that an aircraft registered under the name of this company has previously obtained the required diplomatic authorization . 
We stress that this aircraft has to be offered all the services and privileges that other head of states' planes usually have , including the parking spot . 
This is highly important and we cannot compromise it or accept an alternative to it . 
The General People 's [ORG Committee Secretariat for Foreign Liaison  ] and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG International Organizations Office  ] ) avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the esteemed [ORG US Embassy  ] the assurances of its highest considerations .
