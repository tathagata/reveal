SUMMARY ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On October 23 the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] of the Government of [LOC Colombia  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) delivered its official response to Embassy [LOC Bogota  ] on the [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] text that we proposed on August 13 . 
The [ORG GOC  ] counterproposal is generally consistent with prior [ORG GOC  ] statements that any agreement should: 1 ) avoid the use of the word " base ; " 2 ) place the agreement under the umbrella of existing bilateral and multilateral accords to avoid the need for [MISC Colombian  ] congressional approval ; and 3 ) provide [LOC U.S.  ] security assurances to the [ORG GOC  ] as a " quid pro quo " for access rights . 
Post has identified several problematic issues in the [ORG GOC  ] counterproposal , together with possible solutions that would address our concerns while meeting [ORG GOC  ] needs . 
Post requests that the Department consider sending a technical negotiating team to [LOC Bogota  ] in the near future to begin formal negotiations . 
An official translation of the [ORG GOC  ] 's counterproposal is included in paragraph 6 . 
End Summary . 
DRAFT CONSISTENT WITH [ORG GOC  ] COMMENTS ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOC  ] 's October 23 counterproposal is generally consistent with remarks made to the Ambassador and other senior Embassy officials by President [PER Uribe  ] , [ORG Defense Minister Santos  ] , and Foreign Minister [PER Bermudez  ] . 
These senior [ORG GOC  ] officials have said the proposed agreement should avoid the use of the word " base , " should be linked to earlier bilateral and multilateral agreements to avoid the need for [MISC Colombian  ] congressional approval , and should provide [LOC U.S.  ] security assurances to the [ORG GOC  ] as a " quid pro quo " for access rights . 
President [PER Uribe  ] has also said he would like to conclude an agreement before the end of the year . 
EMBASSY COMMENTS TO [ORG GOC  ] DRAFT ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Post believes it is important that in negotiating this agreement with the [ORG GOC  ] , we seek language that addresses our concerns while being as responsive to the [ORG GOC  ] 's needs as possible . 
In this context , Post has identified the following issues with the [ORG GOC  ] counterproposal--as well as possible solutions--that will need to be addressed: ISSUE ONE: The [ORG GOC  ] has included within the agreement 's preamble references to numerous existing bilateral and multilateral agreements . 
The title has also been changed from " [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] " to " [MISC Supplemental Agreement  ] for Cooperation and [ORG Technical Assistance  ] , " in order to place it under the umbrella of existing bilateral accords . 
These edits are consistent with the [ORG GOC  ] 's goal of avoiding the need for [MISC Colombian  ] congressional approval . 
The changes would also make it easier for the [ORG GOC  ] to sell the agreement to the [MISC Colombian  ] public and the region as simply an extension of our existing cooperation , rather than as a major escalation in [LOC U.S.  ] engagement . 
[ORG COMMENT: Post  ] believes that tying the agreement to existing bilateral and multilateral agreements does not impact [LOC U.S.  ] interests and is important to the [ORG GOC  ] 's capacity to conclude an accord . 
If we can get the access and authorities we need by changing the title , we recommend changing the title . 
ISSUE TWO: The [MISC GOC-proposed Article III  ] states that the parties " agree to " undertake a number of measures to increase cooperation and technical military cooperation in order to " confront common threats to peace and stability . 
" [MISC COMMENT:  ] To limit a possible open-ended [LOC U.S.  ] security commitment under this provision , Post suggests that we insert a less binding verb such as " agree to study " or " agree to consider " in place of " agree to . 
" ISSUE THREE: The [ORG GOC  ] draft of the second paragraph of [ORG Article IV  ] provides that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" guarantee rapid and direct access " to the [ORG GOC  ] of " goods and services necessary to address " threats to its national security . 
" COMMENT: To avoid [LOC U.S.  ] material being used in a potential regional conflict , Post suggests that this language be amended to require that both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] need to agree on what constitutes " threats to its national emergency , " thus effectively granting us a veto over the use of any [LOC U.S  ] . 
" goods or services " under this provision . 
ISSUE FOUR: The [ORG GOC  ] draft of the third paragraph of [ORG Article IV  ] provides that within two years of signing the agreement , the [LOC U.S.  ] shall install and make operational " comprehensive aerial defense systems " in order to provide necessary security on the " agreed facilities and others of strategic value for purposes , " which systems shall transfer " free of charge " to the [ORG GOC  ] at the conclusion of the agreement . 
This provision is clearly aimed at external threats , particularly [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[ORG COMMENT: Post  ] believes the [ORG GOC  ] does not appreciate the cost and scope entailed in building an integrated air defense system , which could cost billions of dollars and take years to develop . 
Post recognizes that the proposed [ORG GOC  ] language is unacceptable , and suggests that we try to remove the provision from the agreement and deal with it in the context of other bilateral discussions . 
If the [ORG GOC  ] insists on its inclusion , we propose a two-track approach in which the [LOC U.S.  ] would " commit to assess the operational requirement for comprehensive air defense systems for use and operation by the [ORG GOC  ] , " coupled with language in which the [LOC U.S.  ] would " commit to provide for the protection of [ORG USG  ] aircraft and personnel " ( but not installations ) in the event of a threat to these assets . 
The latter provision should be drafted to allow for all possible responses to protect [ORG USG  ] assets , including the withdrawal of such assets from [LOC Colombia  ] if necessary . 
Finally , we should begin to consider quietly whether we would be prepared to provide some air defense equipment to [LOC Colombia  ] should that be the price of a [ORG DCA  ] . 
ISSUE FIVE: The [ORG GOC  ] has deleted the status of armed forces ( [ORG SOFA  ] ) language that we proposed . 
Instead , [ORG Article VI  ] of the [ORG GOC  ] draft links privileges and immunities ( [ORG P&I  ] ) to the 1974 agreement titled " Agreement Between the Government of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] and the Government of the [LOC Republic of Colombia  ] Concerning an [ORG Army Mission  ] , a [ORG Naval Mission  ] and an [ORG Air Force Mission  ] of the [LOC United States  ] of [ORG America Armed Forces  ] in the [LOC Republic of Colombia  ] " ( commonly known as the " 1974 Agreement " ) . 
This again reflects the [ORG GOC  ] 's desire to link to earlier agreements in an effort to avoid the need for a [MISC Colombian  ] congressional vote . 
COMMENT: The wording of [ORG Article VI  ] and the 1974 Agreement will need to be reviewed carefully by technical experts , but Post believes that the [ORG GOC  ] approach represents an acceptable way forward . 
The provisions in the 1974 [MISC Agreement--which  ] also links to an earlier 1962 bilateral accord--appear to provide technical and administrative [ORG P&I  ] to [ORG USG  ] personnel , and as such would meet the [ORG P&I  ] needs provided for in our draft agreement . 
ISSUE SIX: Post proposes insertion of a new clause in [ORG Article XVII  ] wherein the parties would commit to sign a technical Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) within 60 days of signing the underlying agreement . 
The [ORG MOU  ] would address more detailed operational issues , thereby facilitating rapid and seamless implementation of the underlying agreement. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Action Request . 
Post requests that the Department consider sending a technical negotiating team to [LOC Bogota  ] in the near future to begin formal negotiations .
