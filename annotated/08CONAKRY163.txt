CONAKRY 0155 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Phillip Carter III  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: On May 3 , Ambassador [PER Carter  ] met with Prime Minister [PER Lansana Kouyate  ] at the EMR for 90 minutes . 
[PER Kouyate  ] , who was traveling to [LOC Kuwait  ] that evening , had just come from a meeting with President [PER Conte  ] at his farm in [LOC Dubreka  ] where the PM discussed plans for a possible cabinet reshuffle , and the creation of a government committee to address [LOC Guinea  ] 's growing food crisis . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] 's meeting covered a number of topics , from the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's latest travels into [LOC Guinea  ] 's interior to [PER Kouyate  ] 's most recent meeting with President [PER Conte  ] , to the current political and economic challenges facing the country . 
The issue of [LOC Guinea  ] 's growing narcotics trafficking problem was also raised with some surprising insights regarding the apparently strained relationship between President [PER Conte  ] and his eldest son [PER Ousmane  ] , a leading figure in the country 's drug trade . 
END SUMMARY ----------- Elections ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Kouyate  ] was clearly pleased to be meeting with the [ORG Ambassador  ] , stating that it had been a while since he had an opportunity to exchange ideas . 
Noting the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's recent travels throughout the country , [PER Kouyate  ] asked about the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's impressions . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] told the PM that it is clear that the elections are a topic of much interest among the various groups he had met with , including local political , youth and civil society leaders . 
However , he shared his impression that people seem frustrated , with many feeling that the government is not doing enough to ensure that the elections will be well organized , free and fair . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] stressed the need for better communication among these different groups in the countryside , emphasizing that the regional [ORG CENI  ] representatives and local officials ( Governors and Prefects ) need to define their respective roles and responsibilities in order to avoid confusion as election day approaches . 
According to the [ORG Ambassador  ] , everyone seemed to be waiting for instructions from [LOC Conakry  ] rather than initiating the necessary dialogue amongst themselves . 
On this score , the PM stated that he will be convening a meeting of all political parties , the [ORG CENI  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] and donors to discuss what needs to be done to get the process rolling in a more determined fashion . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] told the PM that he hoped that the [ORG CENI  ] would also receive additional funding from the government , beyond the paltry 500 million GnP ( about $110,000 ) it has already received . 
[PER Kouyate  ] said that he is looking to address the [ORG CENI  ] 's budget shortfall through a supplemental allocation to the " initial " allotment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] also noted that many interlocutors were concerned about the growing ethnic character of each of the parties as well as the parties' apparent lack of action with respect to the elections . 
The PM responded by saying that the issue of ethnicity is not new or unique to [LOC Guinea  ] , but that if any party wants to build the political standing necessary to control the [ORG National Assembly  ] or win the Presidency , it will need to garner support from all of the country 's ethnic groups . 
He shared the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's view that even within the [LOC Malinke  ] , [LOC Sousou  ] , or [PER Fulani  ] ethnic groups , there are divisions that will likely prevent any one political party from claiming the complete support of any one ethnicity . 
He pushed back on the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's assertion that the parties were not preparing themselves . 
The PM said that while the official campaign period is legally limited to a certain number of weeks before the election , the parties are actively seeking candidates and marshaling resources . 
He described one recent instance where a party had imported a container of promotional materials , such as Tee-shirts and caps with logos , and sought an exemption for the $500,000 duty imposed by customs , which he could not waive . 
The PM mentioned the law passed in May 2007 that obligates the [MISC Guinean  ] Government to provide registered political parties with some public funds , and said that he had directed the Finance Minister to fulfill this obligation . 
CONAKRY 00000163 002 OF 004 ------------ [ORG Food Crisis  ] ------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to economics , the [ORG Ambassador  ] said that the government 's recent ban on agricultural exports would likely cause more harm that good over the medium term , and would do nothing to solve the problem of rising food prices globally . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] noted that during his recent visit to the [LOC Forest Region  ] , several producers complained about the ban . 
He stressed that banning exports creates a disincentive to farmers to increase production since their market is effectively cut off . 
[PER Kouyate  ] acknowledged the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's concerns , and emphasized that he is deeply committed to a liberal and open economic policy . 
However , he noted that , globally , there is a growing protectionist trend among countries that export agricultural commodities such as rice . 
He said he understood donor objections , but that the ban is an expedient necessity to support [MISC Guinean  ] consumers who are increasingly squeezed by rising food prices . 
He added that local exporters deposit their profits into foreign accounts , meaning that [LOC Guinea  ] gains little financially , if anything , from agricultural exports . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] responded that an export ban does not resolve the problem of repatriated revenues/profits , and urged the PM to focus on resolving problems that continue to inhibit local production . 
[PER Kouyate  ] stated that his government would clarify its policy to focus on certain essential staples. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the issue of food assistance , the Ambassador urged the PM to improve his government 's coordination on this matter . 
The PM revealed that he had just left President [PER Conte  ] with a draft decree to establish a government steering committee on this subject , that [PER Conte  ] had agreed , and that the Agriculture Minister would receive the signed decree from [PER Conte  ] the following day. ----------------------------------- Ministers , Governors , and Prefects ----------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador commended the PM on his selection of Governors and Prefects , many of whom are viewed as dynamic individuals truly concerned about their communities , but pointed out that despite these appointments , people are increasingly frustrated , viewing the government as largely ineffective . 
[PER Kouyate  ] recalled that , during a trip to [LOC Morocco  ] shortly after he had appointed these new administrators , he was complemented by the then [MISC Moroccan  ] PM because the majority of his prefects had received their administrative training from one of [LOC Morocco  ] 's best schools . 
[PER Kouyate  ] was unaware of this connection but later found out that the Minister of Interior had selected the prefects because of this specific training . 
While he said he was pleased with his governors and prefects , ( with the notable exception of the [LOC Kindia  ] Prefect who had been recently appointed by [PER Conte  ] and was considered a corrupt political hack - reftel A ) , he added that they lacked resources and basic equipment . 
He said that he would be providing 50 vehicles and uniforms to these local officials to help them in their activities before the elections. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) At the national level , [PER Kouyate  ] said he is looking to shake up his cabinet , an idea he proposed when he had met earlier that day with [PER Conte  ] . 
[PER Kouyate  ] told the Ambassador that he is looking to get rid of a handful of ministers he described as " not productive " and " not loyal . 
" He also said that he plans to restructure certain ministries that are " too heavy . 
" He specifically mentioned the [ORG Ministries of Education  ] ; Youth , Sports , and Culture ; and Industry and [ORG Commerce  ] as those that will be split . 
He stated that [PER Conte  ] supported this idea and that upon [PER Kouyate  ] 's return from [LOC Kuwait  ] ; the two would look at the PM 's restructuring plan more closely and select new ministers . 
Just as important , [PER Kouyate  ] added that he hoped he would be able to also restructure the civil service , which is seen as a major obstacle to reform. ------------------------------ The [MISC Bete Noir  ] - [PER Ousmane Conte  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador expressed his concerns about the growing drug trade in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
Noting that until recently , CONAKRY 00000163 003 OF 004 much international attention was focused on [LOC Guinea  ] [ORG Bissau  ] as the first narco-state emerging in [LOC West Africa  ] , the Ambassador said that it appears that the center of this illicit activity had now shifted to [LOC Guinea  ] . 
As the Ambassador spoke , [PER Kouyate  ] visibly slumped in his chair , and then leaned toward the Ambassador , and said that he is aware of this problem and that the major [MISC Guinean  ] trafficker is President [PER Conte  ] 's son , [PER Ousmane  ] . 
He revealed that about eight months ago , an aircraft from [LOC Colombia  ] or [LOC Venezuela  ] was interdicted by local police at the airport in [LOC Faranah  ] , a small city in the [LOC Middle Guinea  ] region . 
When informed about the interdiction by the Minister of Interior , [PER Kouyate  ] instructed him to conduct a full investigation , seize the contraband and prosecute those responsible. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) A couple of days later , the Minister returned to inform the PM that the plane and its cargo had been released by the head of the [ORG National Gendarmerie  ] , General [PER Jacques Toure  ] . 
[PER Kouyate  ] said he was furious and convoked [PER Toure  ] to his office . 
When initially confronted , [PER Toure  ] reportedly denied releasing the aircraft , but later told the PM that the illicit operation was lead by [PER Ousmane Conte  ] . 
( Bio note: [PER Kouyate  ] stated that he knows [PER Toure  ] well as they are related to each other through [PER Kouyate  ] 's mother 's family ) . 
[PER Kouyate  ] challenged [PER Toure  ] , asking him if he had informed anyone about this matter or if he had raised it with President [PER Conte  ] directly . 
[PER Toure  ] reportedly said he had not . 
[PER Kouyate  ] said he chastised [PER Toure  ] for his actions . 
He told the Ambassador that he then went to the [LOC First Lady  ] , [PER Henriette Conte  ] , about [PER Ousmane  ] 's complicity . 
[PER Henriette  ] reportedly described [PER Ousmane  ] as totally out of control , and directed the PM to take the matter up directly with the president . 
When [PER Kouyate  ] raised the incident , President [PER Conte  ] reportedly asked why his son would do such a thing . 
[PER Kouyate  ] told the president that it was a way for his son to get rich quickly and that it reflected poor character . 
[PER Kouyate  ] said that he reminded [PER Conte  ] that he had raised concerns about [PER Ousmane  ] years ago with the President but that nothing had been done . 
[PER Kouyate  ] then revealed a confidence from [PER Conte  ] to the Ambassador , mentioning that the President has had no contact or any communication with his son in over two years . 
According to [PER Kouyate  ] , [PER Conte  ] stated clearly that if evidence develops that ties [PER Ousmane  ] to narcotics trafficking , then he should be arrested and prosecuted. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Kouyate  ] asked if the Ambassador could express his concerns about the growing drug trafficking problem in [LOC Guinea  ] in an open and public manner , such as a letter . 
The PM said that such a communication would help his office to engage the President and the government about this growing problem . 
He also asked for whatever assistance the [ORG USG  ] could provide to help his government interdict smugglers . 
The Ambassador said that he had serious concerns about corruption within [LOC Guinea  ] 's security services on this score , noting the discrepancy between a recent press article highlighting a seizure of one ton of cocaine and police stating that only 350 kilos had been found ( reftels B and C ) . 
[PER Kouyate  ] stated that some of the police are likely involved . 
He added that since his arrival , over 30 police and security personnel have been arrested for crimes and corruption , and are now languishing in prison . 
According to [PER Kouyate  ] , this is unprecedented in [LOC Guinea  ] 's history . 
He stressed that he would work with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] to ensure that " the forthright and correct police officers " would be tasked to stop any flight or ship trying to smuggle narcotics into [LOC Guinea  ] . 
The Ambassador said that he would look into what he could do and that he would coordinate his efforts with his [MISC European  ] counterparts . 
[PER Kouyate  ] repeated his request for a letter that outlined [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about narcotics trafficking in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
The Ambassador stated that he would meet the PM 's request and have something for him upon his return from [LOC Kuwait.  ] -------------- [ORG Bilats Timing  ] -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER Kouyate  ] raised the much delayed bilateral consultations , stating that he was keen to have them . 
When the Ambassador noted that the dated that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] had offered May 21-22 , would not likely work for principals in the [LOC African Bureau  ] , the PM stated that if possible it would be better to hold them in June or July , given his own travel schedule . 
The Ambassador stated that he would convey CONAKRY 00000163 004 OF 004 this timeframe to [LOC Washington.  ] ----- [PER Conte  ] ----- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As the PM was leaving , the Ambassador asked him about [PER Conte  ] 's health . 
[PER Kouyate  ] , slowly shaking his head said that " the president 's health is up and down but he is not doing well . 
" He admitted that " it is difficult to deal with that man " , revealing that he is never sure what he is thinking . 
The Ambassador stated that he has been hearing much criticism of the president and that he is not well regarded in the countryside . 
[PER Kouyate  ] said that one does not need to leave Conakry to hear the same thing . 
He said that at a opening ceremony for a new stadium at the small university in [LOC Sonfonia  ] , the crowds jeered every time [PER Conte  ] 's name was mentioned . 
According to [PER Kouyate  ] , he had to admonish the crowds to be respectful , particularly given that the stadium is named after President [PER Conte  ] . 
" It was incredible " he said , shaking his head again with forlorn look on his face. -------- Comment -------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) This was not the ebullient and positive PM of previous encounters . 
It is clear that political pressures and burdens of office have tempered [PER Kouyate  ] . 
His political ambition , though constrained , remains evident . 
For many pundits , the PM 's tenure is almost over but he is fighting to hold on to his job . 
His feeble attempt to excuse the export ban reveals a man willing to use populist measures for political gain even while recognizing its negative economic impact . 
His plans to restructure his cabinet have been long in the making and he is undoubtedly under pressure to bring some of the old guard back . 
He will likely use the restructuring as an opportunity to engender new alliances and support . 
However , given his weak standing with civil society , the unions , and the presidential entourage , a cabinet shuffle could prove his undoing , if mishandled .
