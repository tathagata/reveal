REF: THE HAGUE 1625 AND PREVIOUS Classified By: Ambassador [PER Roland Arnall  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Dutch  ] Cabinet is prepared to approve an extension of the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] for approximately 1,200 troops , but only if a third party ( or parties ) steps forward to replace the 400 or so [MISC Dutch  ] troops who will need to be withdrawn . 
[MISC Dutch  ] lobbying efforts -- bilaterally and through [ORG NATO  ] -- to find a new partner have been unsuccessful so far , and time is running out , as the Cabinet must submit a decision to Parliament by mid-October . 
On September 19 , Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] explicitly asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to assist the [MISC Dutch  ] in identifying and soliciting possible contributions . 
He also made clear that the [MISC Dutch  ] would accept [LOC U.S.  ] military support for the [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , if offered . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On September 19 , Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] was summoned to the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] to receive an urgent message on [LOC Afghanistan  ] from Foreign Minister [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] POLDIR [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] also attended the meeting . 
According to the Foreign Minister , intensive [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to secure " " third party " " troops to support [ORG ISAF  ] operations in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province have , so far , failed to produce concrete results -- and time is running out. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Verhagen  ] stressed that he and Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] were personally committed to continuing the [MISC Dutch  ] presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Politically and logistically , however , it was just not possible to maintain the current deployment level . 
The Cabinet was therefore proposing a draw-down of roughly 25 percent of the current force -- about 400 troops -- which would allow the [MISC Dutch  ] to retain leadership of the [LOC Uruzgan  ] mission with a remaining force of roughly 1,200 troops . 
[PER Verhagen  ] emphasized that he believed he had secured full Cabinet support -- including from Finance Minister [PER Wouter Bos  ] and Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] -- for an extension at this level , but ONLY if a third party or parties agreed to replace the departing [MISC Dutch  ] troops . 
The third party contributions should fill seven " " modules " " the [MISC Dutch  ] have shared with [ORG NATO:  ] 1 ) Camp protection ( two platoons of 30 each ) ; 2 ) [LOC Field Hospital  ] ( 40 - 60 personnel ) ; 3 ) two " " [MISC OMLTs  ] " " ( 40 personnel ) ; 4 ) two battle groups ( 250 - 260 ) ; 5 ) a PRT mission team ( 5-6 plus security ) ; 6 ) [MISC F-16  ] support ( 4-6 aircraft ) ; and 7 ) helicopters ( although the [MISC Dutch  ] consider this an [MISC RC-South  ] , rather than [MISC Dutch  ] , responsibility . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Verhagen  ] said he did not anticipate serious parliamentary opposition to a reduced extension provided sufficient third party forces could be secured . 
Without additional partners , however , there would be no majority in Parliament in favor of the mission , as both the coalition partner [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) and the opposition [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) had made this a non-negotiable condition of their support . 
( Note: EMBOFF contacts this week with the [ORG Foreign Affairs Spokesmen of  ] both parties support this statement . 
) According to [PER Verhagen  ] , the choice for the GONL is clear: either find enough partners to stay , or leave [LOC Uruzgan  ] by August 2008 when the initial deployment runs out. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Unfortunately , according to [PER Verhagen  ] , intensive [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to secure contributions from potential partners have so far failed to produce concrete results . 
He noted that he was particularly disappointed that the [MISC Slovak  ] Foreign Minister had been unable to make a significant commitment during a September 13 visit to The [ORG Hague  ] , despite earlier indications to the contrary . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have now approached more than a dozen countries , including many identified by [ORG NATO  ] as potential contributors , mostly without success ( see list in para . 
9 ) . 
Time , meanwhile , is running out ; the Cabinet is committed to providing a proposal to Parliament before the internal debate on the [ORG Foreign Affairs Budget  ] begins at the end of October , and would hope to have a decision prior to the [ORG NATO  ] Defense Ministerial in [LOC Noordwijk  ] October 24-25. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Verhagen  ] said he had called the Ambassador in specifically to request [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in finding the additional troops necessary to allow the [MISC Dutch  ] to continue the [LOC Uruzgan  ] mission . 
Since [MISC Dutch  ] bilateral efforts and approaches to [ORG NATO  ] have failed , he said , the [MISC Dutch  ] are now turning to us in the hope that we can shake something loose . 
[PER Verhagen  ] added that the [MISC Dutch  ] also wanted to ensure that we were not competing for the same resources -- there had been rumors that some countries were not open to [MISC Dutch  ] requests because they anticipated filling other missions . 
He mentioned [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Hungary  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , and [LOC Slovakia  ] as specific countries where he believed [LOC U.S.  ] lobbying on behalf of the [MISC Dutch  ] requests could be especially effective , but was also open to suggestions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) In response to a question from Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] , [PER Verhagen  ] said it did not matter to the [MISC Dutch  ] whether the gaps were filled by one large deployment or several smaller ones , provide issues of command and control could be worked out . 
( Note: Other contacts at the [ORG MFA  ] and MOD had previously expressed a strong preference for one large contribution over multiple smaller ones . 
) He also said the [MISC Dutch  ] would be open to [LOC U.S.  ] contributions , assuming the [LOC U.S.  ] forces would operate under [ORG ISAF  ] ( vice OEF ) command. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) COMMENT: After months of receiving mixed signals -- possibly due to divisions within the Cabinet -- the Foreign Minister 's message could not be clearer: the [MISC Dutch  ] will stay in [LOC Uruzgan  ] if they get the additional troops , but cannot do so without them . 
It is also clear that the [MISC Dutch  ] do not believe they can find the troops without USG assistance . 
In a separate meeting with [ORG POLCOUNS  ] , [PER Karel van Oosterom  ] ( PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's Foreign Policy Advisor ) reaffirmed that the Prime Minister is determined to see the mission extended , but believes [LOC U.S.  ] support in finding additional troops will be critical . 
[PER Van Oosterom  ] added that the Prime Minister had recently beaten back an effort by [ORG PvdA  ] cabinet members to link the [LOC Uruzgan  ] extension issue to a possible referendum on the [ORG EU  ] reform treaty , making the " " third party " " issue , in his view , the last meaningful remaining hurdle to achieving an extension . 
If we want the [MISC Dutch  ] to maintain a significant presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , now is the time to weigh in seriously with potential partners . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) SUMMARY OF [MISC DUTCH  ] THIRD PARTY LOBBYING: According to [PER Pieter Jan Kleiweg  ] , the head of the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's [LOC Uruzgan Task Force  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] have directly approached the following countries for support with the following results: - [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] , [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC Lithuania  ] , [LOC Latvia  ] , [LOC Slovenia  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , and [MISC South Korea:  ] all " " very negative " " ; - [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Hungary  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] , [LOC Slovakia  ] , [LOC Denmark:  ] " " not positive , " " although the [MISC Belgians  ] and [MISC Danes  ] might be prepared to provide [MISC F-16  ] support in the [MISC Southern  ] region more generally. - [MISC France:  ] " " not positive , " " but [MISC Dutch  ] are hoping [MISC British  ] might be willing to weigh in. - [MISC Czech Republic:  ] " " not available , " " as already heading a PRT in [LOC Lowgar  ] - [MISC Singapore: Dutch  ] approaching jointly with [MISC Australians  ] ; might be able to provide field hospital ( but no commitment . 
) - [MISC Indonesia: No  ] success ; said might be willing to provide " " one policeman , " " at most. - [MISC Ukraine: Next  ] on [MISC Dutch  ] list ; will approach week of September 24 .
