End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Crown Prince [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( [PER MbZ  ] ) hosted a working dinner with [ORG U.S. Gulf Security Dialogue  ] delegation the evening of July 19 . 
The [ORG U.S. Delegation  ] was led by Assistant Secretary of State for [ORG Political-Military Affairs  ] [PER Andrew Shapiro  ] and Assistant Secretary of Defense for [ORG International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow  ] and included [MISC RADM  ] [PER William Payne  ] , Ambassador , and [ORG DCM  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] was represented by Chief of Staff of the [ORG Armed Forces Hamad Thani  ] al-Rumaithi , Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Yousef  ] al-Otaiba , Under Secretary of the Crown Prince 's Court [PER Mohamed al-Mazrouei  ] , Deputy Chief of Staff [PER Ali Hamad  ] al-Kaabi and [ORG Air Force  ] Chief [PER Mohammed Swaidan  ] al-Qamzi . 
Joint Planning for [MISC Worst-Case Scenario  ] in [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In a three-hour working dinner , [PER MbZ  ] focused primarily on his overarching concern -- the threat from [LOC Iran  ] , stressing as he has with other senior [LOC U.S.  ] officials that [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Iran  ] will ultimately fail and that he fears a surprise ( [MISC Israeli  ] pre-emptive strike on [LOC Iran  ] ) in a shorter timeframe than [ORG USG  ] estimates ( he fears it could happen this year ) . 
ASD Vershbow assured [PER MbZ  ] of the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to [LOC UAE  ] security ; [PER A/S Shapiro  ] relayed that his trip to the [LOC UAE  ] was his first since taking on his new position , reflecting the importance we place on the relationship. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] reiterated his belief that an [MISC Israeli  ] pre-emptive strike against [LOC Iran  ] was increasingly likely , saying he was convinced the [ORG Netanyahu  ] government was prepared to act against [LOC Iran  ] , and that he agreed with [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence assessments regarding how close [LOC Tehran  ] is to achieving its nuclear ambitions . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] response to a pre-emptive strike , predicted [PER MbZ  ] , would be attacks on [LOC U.S.  ] allies in the region , foremost among them the [LOC UAE  ] ; [LOC Iran  ] may also unleash terrorist cells against western interests around the world . 
ASD Vershbow explained that the [ORG USG  ] assessment differed in timeframe -- we do not anticipate military confrontation with [LOC Iran  ] before the end of 2009 -- stressing , however , that denying [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions and stemming its efforts to achieve regional hegemony were foremost among [LOC U.S.  ] international security concerns. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) In response to [PER MbZ  ] 's position that ultimately engagement efforts with [LOC Iran  ] would fail , both ASD and A/S made clear than while the [ORG USG  ] continues to press for a diplomatic solution , the offer of engagement is not opened-ended and will not come at the expense of [LOC Gulf  ] security . 
ABU DHABI 00000754 002 OF 004 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Referring to the [ORG Iran Region Presence Office  ] ( [ORG IRPO  ] ) in [LOC Dubai  ] , [PER MbZ  ] asked " how 's that office doing ? 
" He did not demonstrate any particular concern or sensitivity regarding [ORG IRPO  ] activities in [LOC UAE  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] said that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime was in trouble internally and would move swiftly to oppress post-election opposition . 
As for [PER Rafsanjani  ] , [PER MbZ  ] said he was a " survivor " who would not succeed in a leadership bid because he will not act unless he is one-hundred percent sure he will win . 
Again turning to his primary security concern , [PER MbZ  ] suggested that [LOC Tehran  ] would likely accelerate its nuclear program to draw attention away from its internal weakness and to foment nationalism among its citizenry . 
" Time is not on our side " , he said , hinting that a move should be made against [LOC Iran  ] and " the sooner the better . 
" [LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) ASD Vershbow briefed [PER MbZ  ] on the positive outcome of [ORG POTUS  ] 's recent talks in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] said that he had met with [PER Putin  ] in June and he did not believe [LOC Russia  ] saw a nuclearized [LOC Iran  ] as a challenge to its interests , nor did [PER Putin  ] appreciate the threat of regional proliferation in response to an [MISC Iranian  ] bomb . 
He encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue to press the [MISC Russians  ] saying he believed if the [MISC Russians  ] came over to our side , ( with regard to tougher sanctions ) , the [MISC Chinese  ] would follow . 
[PER MbZ  ] said his he would travel in late July to [LOC Beijing  ] , where he will surely press the [MISC Chinese  ] on [LOC Iran  ] . 
ASD Vershbow suggested he urge the [MISC Chinese  ] to send [LOC Iran  ] a message by diversifying its oil imports away from [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] - Neighbors Not Doing Enough ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] complained that [MISC Arab  ] regimes are not doing enough to help in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said that as of one month ago , he surveyed the region and found that only [LOC Oman  ] had funded its [LOC Tokyo  ] conference pledge of $2 million . 
He singled out [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] in particular for not doing their part , saying that the [MISC Saudis  ] clearly did not see how important it was to their own interests. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] criticized other regional leaders for playing both sides and for " dating " [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] compared the current situation to pre-WWII [LOC Europe  ] saying , " [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] is [PER Hitler  ] , " and neighboring capitals believe erroneously that they can prevent [MISC Iranian  ] retaliation by playing nice or signing agreements with [LOC Tehran  ] . 
" They think the are backing the winning horse , " [PER MbZ  ] explained , emphasizing that if they think that by appeasing [LOC Iran  ] they will avoid [MISC Iranian  ] retaliation " then they are seriously mistaken , Sir . 
" National Defense Strategy ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Throughout the discussions , [PER MbZ  ] repeatedly called for coordinated military planning for the worst-case scenario of an unpredictable [MISC Iranian  ] response to an [MISC Israeli  ] strike , stressing that [MISC U.S.-UAE  ] preparations must begin now well before commencement of hostilities . 
Both sides agreed that improved coordination was a good idea , with ASD Vershbow utilizing the opportunity to push for a [LOC UAE  ] national defense strategy .

End Note . 
) [LOC Pakistan  ] - 14 Additional PUMAs ------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Passing a letter from Secretary [PER Clinton  ] thanking the [LOC UAE  ] for its transfer of 14 [MISC U.S.-origin  ] PUMA helicopters to [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER A/S Shapiro  ] thanked [PER MbZ  ] for the [ORG UAEG  ] 's partnership and regional leadership in providing assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] as well as its long-term participation in the coalition in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] updated the delegation on delivery status , saying that 10 of the promised 14 ABU DHABI 00000754 003 OF 004 had been delivered and the remaining 4 would shortly follow . 
He added that efforts were underway to find and purchase additional helicopters , announcing ( for the first time that we have heard this ) the [LOC UAE  ] 's intentions to provide [LOC Pakistan  ] with an additional 14 PUMAs . 
[ORG Humanitarian Aid for CT  ] ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In the context of defeating [ORG AQ  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER MbZ  ] called for [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] regimes to do more to stem terrorist financing , whether it means closing down charities , business interests , " whatever is necessary . 
" He also pointed to the zealousness of [MISC Arab  ] fighters vice [MISC Afghani  ] nationals . 
Nine-five percent of [MISC Arab  ] fighters go to [LOC Afghanistan  ] knowing they are going to die for ideological reasons . 
[MISC Afghan  ] nationals , on the other hand , are more practical . 
" This makes one of them [ [MISC Arabs  ] ] more valuable to [ORG AQ  ] than ten or more [MISC Afghan  ] fighters . 
" Afghanis , [PER MbZ  ] pointed out , have tribes , families , homes -- therefore the best way to counter local extremism in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and to a lesser extent [LOC Pakistan  ] , is to improve the quality of life. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( SBU ) [PER MbZ  ] described [LOC UAE  ] humanitarian commitments of $300 million to build " model villages " in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , complete with housing , hospitals and schools . 
He invited the [ORG USG  ] to join the [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] in this effort . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] stressed the urgency of the displaced persons crisis in the [LOC Swat  ] region of [LOC Pakistan  ] , suggesting the [LOC UAE  ] consider housing aid in this region . 
[PER MbZ  ] replied " Why not ? 
We will try to help wherever needed . 
" [PER MbZ  ] on [MISC Pakistani  ] Leadership --------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] shared his assessment of the current [MISC Pakistani  ] leadership saying President " [PER Zardarni  ] is dirty but not dangerous , " while Prime Minister [PER Sharif  ] is " dangerous but not dirty -- this is [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Sharif  ] cannot be trusted to honor his promises . 
[PER MbZ  ] continued that a new personality may emerge but for the time being the [LOC UAE  ] position was to play a helpful role by supporting the PM . 
[LOC Lebanon  ] - Support for [ORG LAF  ] and PM [PER Hariri  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) ASD Vershbow reiterated our request that the [ORG UAEG  ] assist the [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG LAF  ] ) by funding the purchase and transfer of some of 56 [MISC U.S.-origin  ] tanks from [LOC Jordan  ] to [LOC Lebanon  ] , noting our appreciation of the [LOC UAE  ] 's earlier funding of the first 10 tanks . 
This would help capitalize on the positive outcome of the elections and help reduce [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's ( and [LOC Iran  ] 's ) influence in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Promising to look into what the [LOC UAE  ] could do to help with this matter , [PER MbZ  ] asked if we had made the same request to [LOC Doha  ] . 
ASD replied that we had and that he would do so again when he arrived in [LOC Qatar  ] July 20. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Reiterating his favored theme of the generation gap in regional leadership ( [LOC UAE  ] having already passed the baton to the younger generation ) , [PER MbZ  ] praised [MISC Lebanese  ] PM [PER Saad Hariri  ] , saying he was a good man . 
" He feels very threatened at the moment ( presumably by the [MISC Syrian  ] regime ) , and it is important we do not lose him . 
" [PER A/S Shapiro  ] agreed , pointing to [LOC U.S.  ] security assistance as proof of our concern and suggested that the [LOC UAE  ] support [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to strengthen [MISC Lebanese  ] government institutions as the best opportunity to build [ORG GOL  ] stability and security . 
July 18 [PER Nasrallah Speech  ] ------------------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) [PER MbZ  ] pointed to [ORG Hezbollah  ] SYG [PER Hassan Nasrallah  ] 's July 18 speech , saying he believed it reflected a change in [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's tone due to calculations that its [MISC Iranian  ] backers were currently in a weakened state post-Presidential elections . 
[PER MbZ  ] said that [PER Nasrallah  ] is likely suffering from decreased financial support , at least for ABU DHABI 00000754 004 OF 004 the next six months . 
Behavior Change in [LOC Syria  ] - I Think Not -------------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Vershbow pointed to recent progress with [LOC Syria  ] on border control issues to stem the flow of foreign fighters to [LOC Iraq  ] as a small step forward in effort at eliciting behavioral change from [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] showed no confidence that [LOC Syria  ] could be separated from the [MISC Iranian  ] camp . 
" If you want my opinion , " replied [PER MbZ  ] , " I think not . 
" He advised that [LOC Syria  ] had a lot of options and that , judging from past behavior , the regime would continue hedging on key regional issues ( [LOC Iran  ] , support for [ORG Hezbollah  ] , peace process ) for the foreseeable future . 
Praise for [MISC Bahraini Crown Prince  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER MbZ  ] said that a two-state solution was the only option for solving the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] issue . 
[PER MbZ  ] praised the [MISC Bahraini Crown Prince  ] Sheikh [MISC Salman  ] bin [MISC Hamad  ] al [PER Khalifa  ] for his " courageous " ( July 17 ) editorial in the [ORG Washington Post  ] ( ref B ) , commenting that not enough [MISC Arab  ] countries we on the right side of this issue. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 .
