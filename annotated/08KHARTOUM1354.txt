[PER Zhai  ] even suggested that [LOC Sudan  ] contact the [ORG ICC  ] itself .

( C ) On September 3 , [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador [PER Li Cheng Wen  ] briefed [ORG Charge Fernandez  ] on [MISC Chinese  ] Special Envoy and Assistant Foreign Minister [PER Zhai Jun  ] , s recent visit to [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[PER Zhai  ] , who is responsible for [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , inaugurated the new [MISC Chinese  ] consulate in [LOC Juba  ] and discussed the possible [ORG ICC  ] indictment of President [PER Bashir  ] with [ORG GOS  ] officials in [LOC Khartoum  ] . 
On the latter issue , [PER Li  ] stated that [PER Zhai  ] expressed grave concern about the negative effect an [ORG ICC  ] indictment would have on resolving the [LOC Darfur  ] crisis . 
[PER Zhai  ] found [PER Bashir  ] to be quite receptive. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Li  ] , SE [PER Zhai  ] praised the [ORG GOS  ] for its calm handling of the matter thus far , and encouraged [ORG GOS  ] officials to continue to mobilize internally and engage the international community , including the [ORG UN Security Council  ] and especially the [MISC P-5  ] . 
[PER Zhai  ] also made a “friendly suggestion” that the [ORG GOS  ] consider communicating with the [ORG ICC  ] itself , either directly or indirectly . 
[PER Li  ] expressed hope that such contact could influence and perhaps “curb the next steps” in the [ORG ICC  ] process . 
He stated that the [ORG GOC  ] views [ORG ICC  ] indictment not only as a political , not a legal matter . 
As such , it is encouraging the [ORG GOS  ] to pursue both legal and political solutions to the problem . 
[MISC ICC Action  ] Threatens [LOC Darfur Progress  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] stated that the [ORG GOC  ] is extremely worried about how the [ORG ICC  ] indictment will affect stability in [LOC Darfur  ] , asserting that it has hardened the rebels’ stance towards peace . 
He believes that [ORG GOS  ] officials now understand the gravity of the situation they have created over the years , and hopes they will heed [ORG GOC  ] advice continue to engage with the international community. “Not heating up this matter is in the interest of all parties , ” he said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG CDA Fernandez  ] thanked [PER Li  ] for [LOC China  ] , s helpful and useful message to the [ORG GOS  ] . 
He noted that while the [LOC United States  ] shares [ORG GOC  ] concerns about [LOC Sudan  ] , s stability , its primary focus is achieving tangible improvements in the situation in [LOC Darfur  ] , especially in regards to humanitarian access . 
He continued that while [ORG GOS  ] contact with the [ORG ICC  ] might influence [MISC P-5  ] members [LOC France  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , it does not by itself concern the [LOC United States  ] , which is not a party to the [LOC ICC.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] concurred that the [ORG GOS  ] could do more to speed up humanitarian access and take other positive actions but cautioned that “only pressuring the [MISC Sudanese  ] government is no use.” Continued antagonism serves to strengthen the suspicions of hardliners within the [ORG NCP  ] that the West is plotting against [LOC Sudan  ] , he said . 
Rather , “we need to engage with them” to help solve the [LOC Darfur  ] crisis . 
Both agreed that there is some anecdotal evidence of regime infighting about what is the best strategy: cooperation or escalation. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] expressed puzzlement at perceived [MISC British  ] and [MISC French  ] support for [ORG ICC  ] Chief Prosecutor [PER Luis Moreno-Ocampo  ] . 
He stated that “whoever had a role in creating this problem will bear responsibility” if [LOC Sudan  ] descends into chaos as a result of the [ORG ICC  ] indictment , adding that such an outcome could have been easily forecast . 
He declared that destabilization of [LOC Sudan  ] is in no one , s interest , adding that “to help [LOC Sudan  ] is to help ourselves . 
I hope the [MISC British  ] and [MISC French  ] understand this philosophy.” He observed that [MISC French  ] companies have oil interests in [LOC Sudan  ] as well as in [LOC Chad  ] . 
[ORG CDA Fernandez  ] agreed that an [ORG ICC  ] indictment will KHARTOUM 00001354 002 OF 002 present great challenges to achieving peace in [LOC Darfur  ] , but commented that the decision to indict President [PER Bashir  ] was may bave been made by an overzealous prosecutor and is not the result of “high politics” or a conspiracy by the West . 
He noted President Bashir’s sweeping claims to want to change the situation in [LOC Darfur  ] for the better , “we want to see tangible results , not words or process.” [LOC U.S.  ] Should Not [MISC Block Delaying ICC Action  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG CDA  ] Fernandez’ meeting with [PER Li  ] followed a flurry of erroneous media reports that [LOC China  ] is expected to “veto” the issuance of an arrest warrant for President [PER Bashir  ] . 
( Note: For example , the newspaper [ORG Akher Lahza  ] ran a story with the headline “China Does Not [MISC Rule Out Veto To Invalidate Ocampo’s  ] Allegations , ” which noted that “President [PER Bashir  ] received a verbal message from his [MISC Chinese  ] counterpart expressing a his country’s support for [LOC Sudan  ] regarding [MISC Ocampo’s  ] allegations , ” but that “Peking denied reaching the stage of using a veto to invalidate the [ORG ICC  ] prosecutor’s procedures because the case is still in its primary phase.” Another daily , Al-Rae’d , ran a headline “Chinese veto awaits [PER Ocampo.” End Note  ] . 
) [PER Li  ] acknowledged that these reports suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of role of [ORG Article  ] 16 of the [ORG ICC  ] Statute by the [MISC Sudanese  ] public , and that it is a P-3 veto of a deferral of the [ORG ICC  ] proceedings that [ORG GOS  ] must worry about . 
He urged the [ORG USG  ] to think of its and [MISC Chinese  ] “mutual interests” in [LOC Africa  ] when making a decision. “Stability is in the interests of all parties , ” he said. “It’s what we should work for in the [MISC New World Order.” Comment  ] - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Li’s concern that the issuance of an arrest warrant for President [PER Bashir  ] could have profound destabilizing effects are well founded . 
Combined with the end of the rainy season and renewal of rebel activity on both sides of the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] border , the [ORG ICC  ] indictment could set off a chain reaction of violence and instability . 
China’s encouragement of [ORG GOS  ] internal mobilization and international engagement , including with the [ORG ICC  ] , is both useful and helpful , but its unclear whether the [ORG NCP  ] even has the capability , let alone the willpower , to take any action towards solving the crisis if it can decide what those steps should be .
