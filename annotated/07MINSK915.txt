06 [LOC MINSK  ] 641 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Karen Stewart  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Former [ORG Presidential Administration Press Advisor  ] [PER Aleksandr XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told Pol/Econ Chief on October 23 that [PER Lukashenko  ] has not decided whether to run again in 2011 . 
The dictator 's inner circle does not fear a managed transition , but still wants to avoid significant steps toward democratization . 
End summary . 
Lukashenko: " Should I Stay or Should I Go ( in 2011 ) ? 
" --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that [PER Lukashenko  ] feared losing power , but was nonetheless contemplating the installation of his son [PER Viktor  ] as president in elections scheduled for 2011 . 
For such a succession to be possible , opined [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Lukashenko  ] must start now building his son 's political credibility . 
The first stage in such a plan , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , could be [PER Viktor  ] 's emergence as a power player in parliament following 2008 elections . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] 's inner circle would accept a managed transition with limited political and economic changes . 
Even if [PER Viktor  ] forced some insiders to leave power , they have amassed enough wealth to retire comfortably , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Support for Better Relations with the [LOC West  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reasoned that several important groups favored improved relations with the [LOC West  ] to ward off increasing [MISC Russian  ] influence . 
[PER Viktor Lukashenko  ] and his supporters understand that just like democratic reforms , any real movement toward union with [LOC Russia  ] would strip them of their privileged position . 
[MISC Belarusian  ] business and financial elites such as [PER Yuriy Chizh  ] ( reftels ) and [PER Aleksey Vaganov  ] ( ref B ) understand that they cannot compete against [MISC Russian  ] business in open privatizations . 
In non-transparent deals they could use their connections with [MISC European  ] partners to buy up property . 
Finally , Prime Minister [PER Sergey Sidorskiy  ] , his first deputy [PER Vladimir Semashko  ] and others in the Council of Ministers such as Energy Minister [PER Aleksandr Ozerets  ] feared losing influence . 
Lukashenko: A Soviet-Style Ruler [PER Sans Mass Executions  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described [PER Lukashenko  ] as a product of his upbringing -- a [MISC Belarusian  ] [MISC Soviet  ] peasant turned ideology officer . 
Raised in the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , [PER Lukashenko  ] naturally believes that the state rules the people , but as a [MISC Belarusian  ] he wants to develop the country apart from [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] , like any peasant , relies first and foremost on craftiness to achieve his objectives . 
As a former [MISC Soviet  ] Army political officer , the dictator understands the use of ideology as a veneer to mask the true intentions of one 's actions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Lukashenko  ] can make decisions , including harsh ones , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , but he knows to stop short of allowing opponents to tie him to extra-judicial executions . 
Murder is the only sin a ruler could commit that the [MISC Belarusian  ] people would never forgive . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the MFA had advocated the release of political prisoner [PER Aleksandr Kozulin  ] in the event his wife neared death to avoid the backlash likely if [PER Kozulin  ] was kept from seeing her before she passed away . 
[PER Lukashenko  ] has taken no action , however , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Comment: Keep Driving a [ORG Hard Bargain  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Lukashenko  ] would like the [LOC West  ] to think that he can always turn toward [LOC Russia  ] rather than face continued isolation . 
In fact , options for improved relations with [LOC Moscow  ] are limited . 
Many of those around the dictator seek to resist [LOC Moscow  ] 's gravitational pull . 
Unfortunately , [PER Lukashenko  ] 's [MISC Soviet  ] instincts have not allowed his underlings to appease the [LOC West  ] with even minor democratic reforms . 
If [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's assessment that the dictator may hand over power as early as 2011 is correct , his son may seek to make new overtures to the [LOC West  ] in order to curb [LOC Russia  ] 's perceived power to derail his succession .
