( C ) Following up on a report that detained regime critic [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi 's health may have sharply deteriorated since the Embassy 's visit with him on March 26 , Ambassador phoned Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi confidant [PER Munder Ramadan  ] March 29 and conveyed the message that the [ORG USG  ] was deeply concerned about el-Jahmi 's health and expected that he would receive appropriate medical care pending any arrangements that the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) might be making for his treatment abroad ( see reftel ) . 
2 . 
( C ) On March 30 , the [ORG QDF  ] 's point-person on the issue , [PER Saleh Abdulsalam Saleh  ] , reported to us that he had met with el-Jahmi 's doctor earlier in the day and according to the doctor , el-Jahmi 's health was now " stable . 
" [PER Saleh  ] faxed us a handwritten medical report from el-Jahmi 's doctor , [PER Abdulrahman el-Mahdi  ] , dated March 30 , which states in part: " Recently from a few days back , patient suddenly developed severe gastro-enteritis and frequent severe diarrhea on top of other precipitating factors including low oral fluid intake , attack of hyperglycemia , and depression . 
Because of the above factors , complicated by severe dehydration and hypertension , [ the patient suffered from ] renal impairment . 
Then after 48 hours , everything well controlled . 
Patient now stable clinically and hemodynamically . 
" ( Post will fax full medical report to NEA/MAG ) . 
3 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: The  ] doctor 's report describes what he told us during our visit to el-Jahmi on March 26 , i.e. , that the patient 's condition had worsened on/about March 23 due primarily to dehydration . 
The report concludes that el-Jahmi 's condition is now stable . 
Given this supposed improvement in el-Jahmi 's health , we will continue to press the [ORG QDF  ] to proceed with making arrangements for his transfer abroad for treatment .
