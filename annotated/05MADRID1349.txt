( C ) Summary . 
We appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on issues related to the [MISC Global War  ] on [MISC Terrorism  ] per reftel action request . 
Overall , counterterrorism cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] is excellent , remaining a cornerstone of the bilateral relationship despite friction on other important issues . 
There are problems related to information sharing ( in both directions ) and structural problems within the [MISC Spanish  ] counterterrorism security apparatus , but these issues are manageable and are being addressed at several levels . 
This message does not include new resource requests , but notes that we have to continue our high level of engagement with [MISC Spanish  ] authorties in order to develop improved access to counterterrorism information by [LOC U.S.  ] investigators . 
[LOC Spain  ] remains a capable partner in the [MISC War on Terror  ] and appears willing to further deepen counterterrorism relations with the [ORG USG  ] . 
End Summary. =========================== [MISC TERRORISM  ] IN [LOC SPAIN  ] =========================== <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The March 11 , 2004 [MISC Madrid  ] train bombings made [LOC Spain  ] the site of the worst terrorist attack in history against an [ORG EU  ] country , but [LOC Spain  ] was already an active front in the [MISC Global War  ] on [MISC Terrorism  ] as a result of its arrest of significant al-Qaida figures beginning in 2001 and its identification of numerous [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups operating within its borders . 
Since the [MISC Madrid  ] train bombings , [MISC Spanish  ] authorities have detained over 120 suspected [MISC Islamic  ] extremists ( including 78 directly related to the train attacks ) and derailed terrorist plans to bomb [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG High Court  ] and other high-profile targets . 
Terrorist organizations active in [LOC Spain  ] include: <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A. al-Qaida . 
The trial of [MISC Syrian  ] national and al-Qaida financier [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] , who was arrested in November 2001 in connection with the September 11 attacks , is set to begin on April 22 . 
[PER Yarkas  ] has been linked by police to many [MISC Islamic  ] extremist suspects who formally belong to other extremist groups listed below. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Islamic Combat Group  ] ( [ORG GICM  ] ) . 
[ORG GICM  ] associates were involved in the March 11 attacks , including individuals who were also involved in the [LOC Casablanca  ] bombing in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
[MISC Moroccan  ] nationals comprise the largest group of [MISC North African  ] immigrants in [LOC Spain  ] and the majority of suspects arrested in connection with [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist cases. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
[ORG Salafist Group  ] for Call and Combat . 
Many [MISC Algerian  ] nationals in [LOC Spain  ] suspected of involvement in terrorism have links to this organization. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
[ORG Armed Islamic Group  ] ( [ORG GIA  ] ) . 
[ORG GIA  ] members who eluded the [MISC Algerian  ] authorities and fled to [LOC Europe  ] were instrumental in recruiting , organizing , and radicalizing young [MISC Islamists  ] in [LOC Spain  ] . 
A [ORG GIA  ] terrorist who was released early from a [MISC Spanish  ] prison due to a clerical error was among the key organizers of the March 11 attacks. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
[ORG ETA  ] . 
Though [ORG ETA  ] is in a steep decline as a result of arrests made possible by improved [MISC Spanish-French  ] police cooperation and hasn't committed killings in nearly three years , it remains [LOC Spain  ] 's most important terrorist organization in the eyes of the [MISC Spanish  ] public . 
This is in part because [ORG ETA  ] periodically detonates small explosives to demonstrate its continued viability as an armed group , including a recent bombing near a convention where King [PER Juan Carlos  ] was due to appear . 
Despite press speculation , authorities have not found a link between [ORG ETA  ] and [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist groups. ============================================= == STRONG COUNTERTERRORISM RELATIONS WITH [LOC SPAIN  ] ============================================= == <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The high level of counterterrorism cooperation between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] authorities is one of the cornerstones of our bilateral relationship . 
In addition to high level discussions and exchanges with [LOC Spain  ] to discuss counterterrorism activities -- including recent visits to [MISC Madrid  ] by Attorney General [PER Ashcroft  ] and Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] and upcoming visits to [LOC Washington  ] by GOS Minister of [ORG Interior Alonso  ] and Minister of [ORG Justice Aguilar  ] -- we can point to numerous successes in our joint effort to combat terrorism <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Spanish/USG GWOT successes in [LOC Spain  ] include: <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's participation in military operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , most recently through leadership of a PRT in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] and partial-leadership of the [ORG FSB  ] in [LOC Herat  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] continues to provide unrestricted access to its military bases at [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] and blanket flight clearances for [LOC U.S.  ] military aircraft , including for GWOT operations. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
Good flow of actionable intelligence information from [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] to [MISC Spanish  ] security officials , and good reciprocal intelligence sharing by the GOS with [ORG USG  ] agencies . 
Intelligence sharing on terrorism has improved markedly since September 11 and has continued to improve under the [ORG Zapatero  ] government . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials at the highest levels are aware of the [ORG USG  ] 's level of support for [MISC Spanish  ] efforts and President [ORG Zapatero  ] recently told the Deputy Secretary that [ORG USG  ] information was essential in the dismantlement of several [MISC Islamic  ] extremist cells. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
Good flow of information from [MISC Spanish  ] police to [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement officials . 
Much of this information is passed to [PER Legat  ] informally before it becomes part of a sealed judicial case . 
Examples include information passed to [PER Legat  ] by the [LOC Catalonian  ] regional police that helped uncover a [MISC Pakistani  ] money transfer and illegal document operation in [LOC Barcelona  ] that may have been involved in sending money to significant al-Qaida figures . 
Another example is the discovery by [MISC Spanish  ] officials of correspondence between [MISC Spain-based  ] terrorists and terrorists serving prison terms in the [LOC U.S.  ] for their involvement in the first [ORG World Trade Center  ] bombing in 1992. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's participation in the [ORG Container Security  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) and Megaports initiatives . 
While the Megaports program is moving forward steadily , on [ORG CSI  ] we have encountered administrative difficulties and delays on both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] sides . 
However , the fact that approximately 80 percent of containers flowing from the [LOC Middle East  ] to [LOC U.S.  ] ports pass through [MISC Spanish  ] ports makes [LOC Spain  ] 's participation in these programs at the three major ports of [LOC Algeciras  ] , [LOC Barcelona  ] , and [ORG Valencia  ] essential to [LOC U.S.  ] homeland security so we are pressing forward. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
Formation of a [ORG Joint Counterterrorism Working Group  ] comprised of [ORG U.S. Department of Justice  ] officials , [ORG Spanish Ministry of Justice  ] officials , [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors , and terrorism experts from both countries . 
This responds to [LOC Spain  ] 's desire for a political symbol of our commitment to work with [LOC Spain  ] on counterterrorism issues and to the [ORG USG  ] 's desire for a joint body to help streamline judicial and investigative cooperation in terrorism cases . 
Though the [ORG Working Group  ] is in its early stages , we hope to use it to strengthen collaboration with [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors on terrorism investigations and increase direct cooperation between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] counterterrorism investigators. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
Improved cooperation on border security , including on [LOC Spain  ] 's decision to centralize overseas passport processing . 
The [ORG USG  ] has offered to share electronic visa lookout information on a trial basis and [MISC Spanish  ] officials have indicated some interest , though this initiative may be hampered by logistical problems on the [MISC Spanish  ] side . 
The [ORG USG  ] has worked with [MISC Spanish  ] authorities to help improve their reporting through international and bilateral channels of lost/stolen passports. <a id='parG' href='#parG'>¶</a>G . 
Spain/USG signed bilateral protocol to [ORG U.S.-EU Mutual Legal Assistance  ] ( [ORG MLAT  ] ) and Extradition treaties . 
There is a substantial flow of terrorism-related [ORG MLAT  ] requests in each direction . 
For example , [MISC Spanish  ] authorities were extremely responsive in a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG MLAT  ] request for information regarding the prosecution of [PER Zacarias Moussaoui.  ] <a id='parH' href='#parH'>¶</a>H . 
Good cooperation on terrorism financing cases . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities make asset checks according to our terrorist financing notifications and work to prevent the illegal use of the [MISC Spanish  ] banking system . 
[LOC Spain  ] works with the [ORG USG  ] in international organizations such as [ORG FATF  ] to strengthen international terrorism financing regimes . 
[LOC Spain  ] continues to upgrade its asset search systems and will soon implement one of [LOC Europe  ] 's toughest anti-terorrism financing laws allowing preventive and administrative freezing of assets. ============================================= BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN ON INFORMATION SHARING ============================================= <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Information sharing for lead purposes between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] police and security services is working well , but there are significant difficulties in sharing [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence information with [MISC Spanish  ] courts since such information cannot be protected from public disclosure . 
[ORG USG  ] delays and denials on requests for access to intelligence information and witnesses for judicial purposes have generated friction with [MISC Spanish  ] judges , particularly high-profile magistrate judges [PER Baltazar Garzon  ] and [PER Juan del Olmo  ] . 
[ORG U.S. Department of Justice  ] , [ORG Embassy  ] , and [PER Legat  ] officials are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with [MISC Spanish  ] judges and judicial officials on the controls each government has in place to prevent the release of shared intelligence information. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) For different reasons , [ORG USG  ] law enforcement authorities sometimes have difficulty obtaining responses to official requests for information on terrorism cases , particularly information pertaining to ongoing judicial investigations in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Under the [MISC Spanish  ] system , once a judge is assigned to a case , that judge exercises control over the investigation and has sole authority over dissemination of official information related to the investigation . 
Judges , who operate with substantial independence , may permit [MISC Spanish  ] police to share information for lead purposes on an unofficial basis . 
However , judges sometimes deny access to investigative information citing judicial secrecy provisions that cannot be overriden by other [MISC Spanish  ] authorities . 
[PER Legat  ] and the [ORG Consular Section  ] work closely with [MISC Spanish  ] judges and prosecutors to avoid such logjams , but judicial secrecy remains an impediment to the [ORG USG  ] 's access to important sources of information related to international counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigations. ============================================= ============== STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES IN SPAIN'S COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS ============================================= ============== <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Though [LOC Spain  ] has an impressive counterterrorism apparatus , there are structural problems that continue to hamper its law enforcement efforts: <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
Most important is the lack of cooperation and coordination among [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement and intelligence agencies . 
There is a tradition of intense inter-service rivalry between the CNI ( the intelligence service ) , the [ORG Civil Guard  ] , and the [ORG National Police  ] , all of which play a significant role in counterterrorism operations . 
There is an added layer of conflict between the national security services and regional police , especially with the [ORG Basque Regional  ] police . 
By all accounts , the [ORG CNCA  ] ( the national counterterrorism center ) launched in 2004 has failed to improve information sharing and coordination among the national services . 
The [ORG USG  ] has worked with [MISC Spanish  ] authorities to improve internal collaboration , for example by providing only one " [MISC CODIS  ] " DNA database instead of the separate databases requested by the various services . 
We are also encouraging the [ORG GOS  ] to look at ways other countries have found to better integrate their security agencies to combat terrorism. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities excel at disrupting terrorist organizations , but have much more difficulty in achieving convictions . 
This is due in part to [MISC Spanish  ] laws enacted during the democratic transition -- and intended to overcome the abuses of the [MISC Franco  ] era -- that provide substantial rights to defendants and significantly impact the ability of prosecutors to win cases and/or obtain strong prison terms for convicted terrorists . 
There are also problems related to the ability of [MISC Spanish  ] authorities to obtain strong evidence for judicial purposes , in part because security agencies are reluctant to release information that would reveal sources and methods . 
Police sources have also indicated that they have sometimes been required to carry out arrests prematurely in response to political pressure to demonstrate strong actions against terrorism . 
Another important factor is the understandable desire of [MISC Spanish  ] officials to prevent any new attacks similar to the March 11 bombings , so there is a predisposition to act preventively , even where legal cases have not been fully prepared . 
One result of this has been that of the 117 [MISC Islamic  ] extremists in [MISC Spanish  ] jails at the end of 2004 , 103 were being held in " preventive detention " rather than on specific charges related to a terrorist attack or plot. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
Finally , the [MISC Spanish  ] public remains fixated on [ORG ETA  ] as [LOC Spain  ] 's primary security threat . 
Despite clear evidence of a large and growing [MISC Islamic  ] extremist presence in [LOC Spain  ] ( a fact of which the [MISC Spanish  ] authorities are very aware ) and the devastating [MISC Madrid  ] train bombings , polls consistently indicate that [MISC Spanish  ] citizens consider [ORG ETA  ] to be a greater danger than jihadist groups . 
While [MISC Spanish  ] police have tripled the number of investigators working against [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups , they face public and political pressure to use their resources to focus on putting an end to [ORG ETA  ] 's long-running campaign against the [MISC Spanish  ] state . 
There is also a question of mindset , with [MISC Spanish  ] security officials realizing that they have some distance to go in becoming as proficient against [MISC Islamic  ] radicals as they are against [ORG ETA  ] , which operates within an ideological context that is far more familiar to [MISC Spanish  ] investigators. ================= COMMENT ================= <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is a capable and willing ally in the [MISC Global War  ] on Terrorism . 
While we do not see a need for signficant new resources for counterterrorism cooperation with [LOC Spain  ] , we do need to find ways to improve our existing channels of communication and to better understand each other 's judicial systems . 
In the case of [ORG ETA  ] , the [MISC Spanish  ] government showed considerable adaptability in confronting the threat . 
We believe the [ORG GOS  ] will show the same level of flexibility in dealing with [MISC Islamic  ] extremists and that the [ORG USG  ] is well placed to provide analytical , technical , and judicial assistance when it could be useful to [MISC Spanish  ] authorities .
