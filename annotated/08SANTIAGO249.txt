Alsace  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) & ( d ) ------ Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Billionaire  ] businessman and all-but-certain 2009 opposition presidential candidate [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] told the Ambassador that the center-right - led by him - has a " wonderful opportunity " to win the 2009 presidential elections , given the " incompetence and corruption " besetting the governing [MISC Concertacion  ] coalition . 
[PER Pinera  ] described President [PER Bachelet  ] as a " good woman , but bad president , " whose foreign policy on issues such as [LOC Venezuela  ] is contrary to [MISC Chilean  ] interest . 
He painted [PER Bachelet  ] as wrong on domestic priorities , particularly education , but also labor , innovation and public security , all of which contributed to " voter fatigue " with [MISC Concertacion  ] , now in power for nearly twenty years . 
[PER Pinera  ] is short on offering solutions , however . 
Moreover , he acknowledged his confidence is based on current political realities ( as he sees them ) , " which are always subject to change . 
" End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The Ambassador paid a call March 13 on [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] who , as the center-right candidate , ran against President [PER Bachelet  ] in 2005 , losing by 54 to 46 percent . 
The billionaire businessman - he made his nut in the telecommunications , credit , and aviation industries - is gearing up for another run in 2009 , and is the presumptive candidate of the opposition [ORG Alianza  ] . 
The Ambassador was accompanied by E/Pol Counselor. ------------------ Back to the Future ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Pinera  ] said that 20 months before [MISC Chileans  ] head to voting booths to replace [PER Michelle Bachelet  ] , the opposition has a " wonderful opportunity " to win the 2009 presidential elections . 
" All polls , " he claimed , show [MISC Chileans  ] " losing hope " and tired of the [MISC Concertacion  ] , now in power for nearly 20 years . 
Current problems - energy shortages , corruption and incompetence - are the result of failed [MISC Concertacion  ] policies . 
Moreover , giving the opposition a turn in power would be good for democracy . 
When E/Pol Counselor noted [PER Bachelet  ] had seemingly arrested her drop in polls ( she has recently rebounded from the high 30 's to the mid-40 's ) , [PER Pinera  ] attributed it to her personal charisma , but insisted her policies remain unpopular. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked if the [ORG Alianza  ] would present new ideas or resort to negative campaigning ; [PER Pinera  ] replied the [MISC Chilean  ] press " never focuses on the positive . 
" For example , he had the day before presented a plan on energy diversification but was only questioned afterwards on his views about alleged misuse of funds at the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] . 
[PER Pinera  ] noted there is internal disagreement within [ORG Alianza  ] as to campaign strategy . 
Senator [PER Allemand  ] ( of [PER Pinera  ] 's moderate right [ORG Renovacion Nacional  ] ( [ORG RN  ] ) ) militates for " total war " against the [ORG Concertacion  ] . 
[PER Joaquin Lavin  ] , of the hard right [ORG Union Democratica Independiente  ] ( [ORG UDI  ] ) , and who [PER Pinera  ] defeated in 2005 in first round presidential elections , before going on to lose to [PER Bachelet  ] in the second , is for a more conciliatory stance . 
[PER Pinera  ] said he would opt for a " New Deal " approach , maintaining the opposition 's traditional role as " fiscalizador " ( watchdog ) , while also seeking areas for cooperation . 
( Comment: [PER Pinera  ] may have decided on this tack after seeing [PER Lavin  ] recently resurrect himself in the polls by claiming to be a " [MISC Bachelitista-Alianzista  ] , " who would work with [ORG Concertacion  ] for the common good , an approach [MISC Chileans  ] apparently appreciated . 
Still , when E/Pol Counselor noted [PER Lavin  ] 's rise , [PER Pinera  ] said [PER Lavin  ] had " bloomed for a day only . 
" ) ----------------------- [PER Bachelet  ] Not Up to Task ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Pinera  ] claimed to have " 600 professionals " ( 300 purportedly with advanced degrees ) working on what a [MISC Pinera-  ] led government would do in areas of education , health , and energy . 
But when the Ambassador pressed for specifics , [PER Pinera  ] replied only that his efforts " aren't politics , " and repeated that the current government wasn't delivering . 
He said President [PER Bachelet  ] is " a good woman , but bad president . 
" On foreign policy , [PER Pinera  ] criticized her for her " too close ties to [PER Chavez  ] , " including having wanted to support ( in 2006 ) [LOC Venezuela  ] 's campaign for a [ORG UNSC  ] seat . 
[PER Chavez  ] had been wrong on the [MISC Ecuador-Colombia  ] dispute , sought close ties to [LOC Iran  ] , and is a destabilizing force in the region . 
All of [PER Chavez  ] 's positions are contrary to [MISC Chilean  ] interests . 
[PER Pinera  ] continued that had he been President he would have told [LOC Ecuador  ] 's [PER Correa  ] ( who was in [LOC Santiago  ] March 9-12 ) that " Yes , the issue of sovereignty is important , but so also is combatting terror . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On domestic issues , [PER Pinera  ] panned [PER Bachelet  ] 's efforts on education reform , noting that much money had been spent " but not well . 
" The [ORG GOC  ] is incorporating " bad practice " from the fully subsidized public school system into the semi-subsidized private system , despite the fact that the latter has shown better results with less resources . 
Part of the problem , according to [PER Pinera  ] , is that " the top seven persons in the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] have poor backgrounds in education and none speak [MISC English  ] . 
" ( Comment: The Harvard-educated [PER Pinera  ] flashed his elitist side here , noting these seven had all attended " mediocre schools . 
" ) [PER Pinera  ] also panned [ORG Concertacion  ] policies on labor , innovation , and public security , adding that [PER Bachelet  ] really " doesn't believe in free trade or open economies . 
" In short , he concluded , the [ORG GOC  ] has no working agenda. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that the Embassy is working with the [ORG GOC  ] on energy cooperation , including diversification and energy efficiency strategies . 
[PER Pinera  ] said he is in disagreement with environmental groups seeking to block construction of major hydroelectric projects in [LOC Patagonia  ] . 
[LOC Chile  ] needs " to double its overall energy generation capacity in the next ten years . 
" That said , it is also necessary to recognize the legitimate concerns of the environmentalists . 
A good approach would be to restructure the [LOC Patagonia  ] project to partially accomodate the environmentalist -- by taking measures such as stringing power lines to " bypass " around environmentally sensitive or especially scenic areas , and partially reducing the footprint of the dams . 
While these measures would add " ten percent " to the cost of a project , they would reduce environmental impact " by a third , " while remaining profitable for investors. ------------ I Am the [LOC Man  ] ------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) E/Pol Counselor asked if the October 2008 municipal elections would be a harbinger of results for the 2009 presidential and parliamentary elections . 
[PER Pinera  ] replied that in 2004 , [ORG Alianza  ] had " been in the ascendant " but that a poor showing in the municipals that year had hurt the opposition in the 2005 national elections . 
While he did not expect [ORG Alianza  ] to win the 2008 municipals , he believed [ORG Alianza  ] would do well , lessening any negative impact in the 2009 national elections . 
[PER Pinera  ] dismissed any possibility of the [ORG UDI  ] putting up a credible presidential candidate , predicted there would be no primary to select the opposition nominee , and said flat out he would be the [ORG Alianza  ] candidate in 2009 . 
He supposed [ORG Concertacion  ] would put up either former President [LOC Lagos  ] or OAS SecGen [PER Insulza  ] against him , but noted he ran 12-15 percent ahead of both in the polls . 
Nonetheless , he acknowledged , " in politics , anything can change . 
" ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The numbers may look good for [PER Pinera  ] today and given [ORG Concertacion  ] 's current difficulties ( a loss of majority in both houses of parliament , a new round of corruption allegations , public concerns over a spike in crime ) , he has every right to be confident . 
But in an aside on economic policy , [PER Pinera  ] also revealed his vulnerable flank , commenting that [ORG Concertacion  ] 's having maintained the [MISC Pincohet  ] regime 's economic policies was wise: " You don't tear down the pyramids because you lost lives building them . 
" This somewhat cavilier attitude towards the human rights abuses of the [MISC Pinochet  ] regime is one [MISC Achilles  ] heel of the center-right , a stance that does not play well with [LOC Chile  ] 's majority center-left voters , and one which [ORG Concertacion  ] will be sure to use as it paints [PER Pinera  ] as a business lackey and [MISC Pinochet  ] sympathizer . 
As [PER Insulza  ] pointed out in a recent interview , [PER Pinera  ] is currently " running alone . 
" That will change shortly , as [PER Pinera  ] himself implicity understands . 
End comment .
