<code><pre>Tuesday , 11 August 2009 , 13:32 S E C R E T HAVANA 000491 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 08/08/2029 TAGS SNAR , PREL , SMIG , PGOV , [ORG CU  ] , [ORG ASEC  ] SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OF [LOC CUBA  ] FRUSTRATION INCREASES OVER LACK OF [MISC JAMAICAN  ] COUNTERNARCOTICS COOPERATION Classified By: COM JONATHAN FARRAR FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) & ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The [ORG U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist  ] ( [ORG DIS  ] ) assigned to the [ORG U.S. Interests Section  ] ( [ORG USINT  ] ) in [LOC Havana  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] has spoken with [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MININT  ] ) officials on multiple occasions , as recently as 4 August 2009 , regarding their perceived lack of Government of [LOC Jamaica  ] ( [ORG GOJ  ] ) cooperation in attempting to curtail the flow of illicit narcotics to the [LOC Bahamas  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
[MISC Cuban  ] [ORG MININT  ] officials contend that narcotics smugglers from [LOC Jamaica  ] are utilizing both [MISC Cuban  ] airspace and waters to transport narcotics ultimately destined for the [LOC United States  ] , but their repeated attempts to engage [LOC Jamaica  ] on the issue have been ignored . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On 4 August 2009 , [ORG DIS  ] wrapped-up a two-day trip to [LOC Camaguey  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] where he received a briefing on the 5 July emergency landing of an aircraft , enroute from [LOC Jamaica  ] , that dropped 13 bales of marijuana over a barren field in [LOC Cuba  ] located southwest of [LOC Playa Santa Lucia  ] in [LOC Camaguey Province  ] . 
According to [MISC Cuban  ] officials , the aircraft was destined for a pre-determined location over [MISC Bahamian  ] waters where the narcotics would be dropped to two waiting go-fast vessels for eventual shipment to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The crew of three discarded the contraband prematurely when they experienced engine problems. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On 4 August , the [ORG DIS  ] visited [PER Joaquin de Aguero  ] airport in [LOC Playa Santa Lucia  ] where the smugglers’ aircraft is located ; [ORG DIS  ] was provided with further insight from airport officials as to how the case played-out , and how [MISC Cuban  ] authorities responded . 
According to the [MISC Cuban  ] Anti-Drug police ( [ORG DNA  ] ) , all three traffickers onboard the aircraft are being detained in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The aforementioned case follows a 27 May 2009 case in which a joint-interdiction of a [MISC Jamaican  ] go-fast vessel in the vicinity of [LOC Playa Guardalavaca  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , that resulted in the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Border Guard  ] seizing 700 kg of [MISC Jamaican  ] marijuana . 
This , after the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Border Guard  ] interdicted the vessel in its waters utilizing real-time information from [LOC OPBAT  ] , [ORG USCG District  ] 7 , and the [ORG USCG  ] [ORG DIS  ] in [LOC Havana  ] . 
The [ORG DIS  ] attended a briefing on this case with [MISC Cuban  ] officials , and boarded the subject narco-trafficking vessel. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) While the [ORG DIS  ] is often briefed via formal means on the type of cases mentioned above , side-bar conversations during provincial trips outside of [LOC Havana  ] with [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG MININT  ] officials often yield increased insight into [MISC Cuban  ] counterdrug ( [MISC CD  ] ) operations and mindset . 
A prevailing concern and significant frustration on the [MISC Cuban  ] side is the reportedly complete lack of cooperation afforded them by the [ORG GOJ  ] when it comes to [MISC CD  ] information sharing . 
[ORG DIS  ] has spoken to no fewer than 15 [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG MININT  ] officers whose primary missions/roles are drug interdiction or support to drug interdiction . 
Collectively and continually , they express frustration over the [MISC GOJ’s  ] consistent ignoring of [MISC Cuban  ] attempts to increase the flow of drug-related information between the two island nations to increase interdictions and avoid “being surprised by drugs.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG MININT  ] officers , specifically the [MISC MININT’s  ] international relations division and anti-drug directorate , with whom the [ORG DIS  ] communicates extensively , consistently allude to the lengths the [ORG GOC  ] has gone to in order to enhance the relationship . 
Without fail , [ORG MININT  ] officials allude to the fact that narco-related information ( i.e. information on go-fasts and aircraft transiting to/from [LOC Jamaica  ] in the vicinity of [LOC Cuba  ] ) passed to the [ORG GOJ  ] is always translated to [MISC English  ] because in the past [ORG GOJ  ] officials stated to the [ORG GOC  ] that they did not understand [MISC Spanish  ] ; [ORG MININT  ] officers report that despite their efforts , [ORG GOJ  ] officials still do not respond. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) In October 2008 , [ORG DIS  ] attended a counternarcotics meeting onboard the [ORG RFA  ] WAVE RULER in the Port of [LOC Havana  ] . 
The meeting was arranged by the [ORG UK Defense Attache  ] to encourage greater cooperation between [ORG GOC  ] and [ORG GOJ  ] over [MISC CD  ] efforts ; during conversations with the [ORG Attache  ] , the [ORG DIS  ] learned that the impetus behind the meeting was to bring [ORG GOC  ] and [ORG GOJ  ] authorities together to encourage greater dialogue , and to quash growing frustration between the two . 
In comments to the [ORG DIS  ] after the meeting , [MISC Cuban  ] officials stated that the two [MISC Jamaican  ] officers “just sat there and didn’t say anything.” [ORG MININT  ] officers mention that [MISC Jamaican  ] officials commonly agree to greater information sharing in person ; however , that is the extent of their efforts. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Currently , [MISC Cuban  ] officials appear resigned to the idea that they will not see greater [ORG GOJ  ] cooperation in the near future . 
On 3 August , the [ORG DIS  ] asked the chief of the [MISC MININT’s  ] international relations department if he thought [MISC Cuban  ] officials would sit down at a table with [ORG USCG  ] , [ORG DEA  ] , [MISC Jamaican  ] officials , and [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG DNA  ] officers to discuss [MISC CD  ] issues ; he said it would be a possibility , but that the [ORG GOC  ] does not have a suitable liaison officer at its embassy in [LOC Jamaica  ] . 
[ORG DIS  ] responded by asking if an officer or group of officers from the [ORG DNA  ] would be able to travel to [LOC Jamaica  ] for such talks ; he once again stated that it is a possibility. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [ORG DIS  ] gauges that the [ORG GOC  ] genuinely desires greater information sharing on [MISC CD  ] issues with [MISC Jamaican  ] authorities to serve the [MISC GOC’s  ] strategic interests . 
Should we decide to pursue broader counternarcotics cooperation with the [ORG GOC  ] , [ORG MININT-DNA  ] may be willing to attend talks with [LOC US  ] drug authorities in concert with [MISC Jamaican  ] authorities . 
At the present time , however , it appears frustration is building within the ranks of the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG MININT-DNA  ] , especially as [MISC CD  ] cases continue to bring illicit narcotics in close proximity or actually to [LOC Cuba  ] and its littorals , posing an interdiction challenge for [MISC Cuban  ] authorities . 
Through their constant reminders to the [ORG DIS  ] and via press reports to the [MISC Cuban  ] people , [ORG GOC  ] officials ultimately blame the [LOC United States  ] for this problem due to the high demand for illicit narcotics by [LOC United States  ] consumers .
