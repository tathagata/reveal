( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: [PER Dirk Niebel  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) was an odd pick as [LOC Germany  ] 's new Development Minister -- he had no experience in international development , and had previously suggested abolishing the [ORG Development Ministry  ] . 
Now in charge , [PER Niebel  ] has big shoes to fill , following on the heels of [PER Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) . 
Important differences with his predecessor are already apparent: he would like to integrate [LOC Germany  ] 's development policy more closely with its foreign and security policy , including in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Niebel  ] is also a firm believer in free markets , and sees a successful conclusion of the [ORG Doha Development Round  ] as critical for developing countries . 
For [PER Niebel  ] , nothing is sacrosanct: he intends to phase out [MISC German  ] aid to [LOC China  ] , which he regards as no longer a developing country . 
With the ministry under new management , there may be additional opportunities for collaboration between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Germany  ] on development policy . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG DIRK WHO  ] ? --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Dirk Niebel  ] struck many as an unlikely choice for Development Minister in the coalition government of Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) /Christian [ORG Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) and [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] 's [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) ( the " [MISC Black-Yellow  ] " coalition ) . 
A [LOC Hamburg  ] native , [PER Niebel  ] 's previous work experience includes eight years as a paratrooper in the [MISC German  ] armed forces , and five years as a placement officer at a job center in [LOC Heidelberg  ] . 
In 1998 , he was elected to the [ORG Bundestag  ] ( lower house of Parliament ) , where he became caucus spokesperson for labor market policy and a member of the [ORG Labor Committee  ] . 
In 2005 , [ORG FDP  ] Chairman ( and current Foreign Minister ) [PER Westerwelle  ] tapped him as [ORG FDP  ] Secretary General -- a position he held until Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] appointed him Development Minister in November 2009 . 
As Secretary General , [PER Niebel  ] had called for the elimination of the ministry he would later head , the [ORG Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development  ] ( [ORG BMZ  ] ) . 
( NOTE: This option appears off the table for now . 
END NOTE ) [PER Niebel  ] succeeds [PER Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul  ] of the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) , who headed [ORG BMZ  ] for a record 11 years . 
CONNECTED SECURITY ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a December 18 meeting with Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] , [PER Niebel  ] said he intended to " make some changes at [ORG BMZ  ] . 
" One such change is linking development policy more closely with foreign and security policy -- a concept he referred to as " connected security . 
" [PER Niebel  ] told the Ambassador he planned to coordinate very closely with Foreign Minister [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] , and that he foresaw much greater cooperation between [ORG BMZ  ] and the [MISC German  ] military in northern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( NOTE: Days prior to the meeting with Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] , [PER Niebel  ] had announced [ORG BMZ  ] would increase civilian assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] by around 50 million euros , bringing [LOC Germany  ] 's 2009 total to over 260 million euros . 
END NOTE ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a separate meeting several months ago , [ORG Chancellery National Security Advisor  ] [PER Christoph Heusgen  ] had told us that [ORG BMZ  ] under a [MISC Black-Yellow  ] coalition would be less wedded to " old " notions of doing development work . 
This assessment now appears to be accurate . 
Wiezcorek-Zeul had ensured that [MISC German  ] development staff worked and lived in separate compounds , away from provincial reconstruction teams ( PRTs ) and other bases from which the [ORG Ministry of Defense , Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Interior  ] operated . 
She even refused to ride in [MISC German  ] military vehicles when she visited [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This kind of separation seems likely to end under [PER Niebel  ] , both physically and substantively. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Among other ideas [PER Niebel  ] brings to the table is a plan to partner with third country donors like [LOC Israel  ] on projects in developing countries . 
[PER Niebel  ] told the Ambassador that [LOC Israel  ] , s expertise in border protection could be shared [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001609 002.3 OF 002 with [MISC African  ] countries , for example . 
By teaming up with [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Israel  ] could participate in certain capacity building projects where it might not otherwise have access . 
LAISSEZ-FAIRE DEVELOPMENT ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Shortly after becoming Minister , [PER Niebel  ] remarked that his overall development philosophy was helping recipient countries help themselves . 
He regards the successful conclusion of [ORG World Trade Organization  ] 's ( [ORG WTO  ] 's ) [ORG Doha Development Round  ] as especially meaningful for developing countries . 
" There is more money being lost by trade barriers than all the development aid can make up for , " he said . 
This perspective marks a noteworthy departure from the approach of [PER Wieczorek-Zeul  ] , dubbed " red [PER Heide  ] " for her affiliation with the [PER Young Socialists  ] years ago. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Niebel  ] also opposes a proposed tax on international financial transactions to fund development assistance . 
Both Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and [PER Wieczorek-Zeul  ] had championed the so-called " [PER Tobin  ] tax . 
" Citing " differences " within the government on the issue , [PER Niebel  ] has reportedly ended [ORG BMZ  ] 's participation in an international working group on the proposed tax. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Niebel  ] is keen to reorient [ORG BMZ  ] 's assistance . 
Reflecting on comments made publicly in his first days as Minister , [PER Niebel  ] told Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] that [LOC Germany  ] planned to stop providing development assistance to [LOC China  ] , currently one of the largest recipients of [MISC German  ] aid . 
He added that [LOC China  ] was " only a developing country when it came to climate change negotiations . 
" [ORG BMZ  ] will carry out its existing aid obligations to [LOC China  ] only through next year . 
The decision has proved controversial , as [ORG BMZ  ] 's assistance to [LOC China  ] had reportedly benefitted [MISC German  ] companies doing business there . 
TRAVEL PLANS ------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Niebel  ] said he planned to spend the holidays in [LOC Israel  ] . 
( NOTE: [PER Niebel  ] is a long-standing member of the [ORG German-Israeli Society  ] . 
END NOTE ) His first official travel to the developing world will be a late January trip to " [LOC Rwanda  ] , eastern [LOC Congo  ] , [LOC Mozambique  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Asia  ] . 
" The Ambassador suggested [PER Niebel  ] visit [LOC Washington  ] to meet with new [ORG USAID  ] Administrator [PER Shah  ] once confirmed . 
[PER Niebel  ] said he would coordinate dates for the visit with the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Niebel  ] takes charge of [ORG BMZ  ] at a challenging time: [LOC Germany  ] will run its largest post-war deficit in 2010 , and pressure to rein in spending will strain every ministry . 
[PER Niebel  ] 's close relationship with [PER Westerwelle  ] should be an asset , however , and could help minimize cuts on key priorities . 
The close relationship will also facilitate [PER Niebel  ] 's vision of integrating development policy with foreign and security policy . 
Since taking over at [ORG BMZ  ] , [PER Niebel  ] has increased assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where [LOC Germany  ] was already the third largest donor , and appears open to doing more in support of an integrated strategy in the north . 
An early meeting between the new [ORG USAID  ] Administrator , who oversees the world 's largest aid budget , and the new [MISC German  ] Development Minister , who oversees the world 's second largest , could be an important step in building stronger [MISC U.S.-German  ] cooperation on our top development priorities .
