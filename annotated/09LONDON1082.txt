End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) FCO [LOC Sri Lanka  ] team leader [PER Tim Waite  ] and Desk Officer [PER Sharon Diaz  ] told Poloff May 7 that the civilians caught in the conflict zone remain the [MISC UK’s  ] primary concern in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , followed by humanitarian access and addressing [ORG IDP  ] needs . 
The [ORG UK Government  ] has provided [MISC GBP  ] 7.5 million ( USD 11.25 million ) since October 2008 , including Prime Minister [PER Brown’s  ] recent pledge of [MISC GBP  ] 2.5 million ( USD 3.75 million ) in additional support . 
[PER Miliband  ] and [ORG Kouchner Visit  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Waite  ] described [PER Miliband  ] and [MISC French  ] Foreign Secretary Kouchner’s April 29 visit as “good , ” though [PER Miliband  ] was “disappointed” that the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] Government did not permit [MISC Swedish  ] Foreign Secretary Bilt to join the visit . 
[PER Waite  ] said Miliband’s May 1 statement to Parliament highlighted the threefold purpose of his visit: “to highlight the need to bring the conflict to an end in a way that minimizes further civilian casualties ; to press the case for the humanitarian relief effort to be ratcheted up , as the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] have been calling for ; and to make clear the need for a long-term political settlement that meets the aspirations of all communities in [LOC Sri Lanka.”  ] These remain the [MISC UK’s  ] primary objectives and were reflected in [PER Miliband  ] and Kouchner’s joint article following the visit ( reftel B ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] continues to press on five specific humanitarian points: the need for visas to be issued swiftly to international humanitarian staff ; the subject of travel permits for staff working on approved projects inside [LOC Sri Lanka  ] ; the need for full access to [MISC IDPs  ] as soon as they have crossed the front line and the monitoring of all stages of screening ; the need for a proper resettlement program with specific deadlines to fulfill the [ORG Government’s  ] commitment to have 80 percent of [MISC IDPs  ] resettled by the year’s end ; and , to allow the distribution of sufficient food and medicine to meet the needs of civilians trapped in the conflict zone ( reftel A ) . 
[LOC LONDON  ] 00001082 002 OF 002 Special Envoy [PER Des Browne  ] Finally Makes It to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Waite  ] said a cross party group of MPs visited [LOC Sri Lanka  ] May 4-5 at the [LOC Sri Lanka  ] [ORG Government’s  ] invitation , including the Prime Minister’s Special Envoy for [LOC Sri Lanka  ] [PER Des Browne  ] , the February 2009 appointment of whom the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] Government has rejected ( reftel C ) . 
Browne’s visit was allowed by the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] Government on condition that [PER Browne  ] was visiting in his capacity as an [ORG MP  ] sitting on the cross party parliamentary group , which the [LOC UK  ] agreed to . 
In their May 6 statement , the parliamentarians echoed the same themes as [PER Miliband  ] . 
[PER Waite  ] said they had found the situation in the [ORG IDP  ] camps to be a “little bit better , ” but “not nearly as good as it should.” [PER Waite  ] also reiterated that the [ORG UK Government  ] still acknowledges [PER Browne  ] as the Prime Minister’s Special Envoy , noting that [PER Browne  ] had been doing a lot of outreach to the [ORG Diaspora  ] community resident in the [LOC UK  ] . 
[LOC India  ] ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Browne  ] is currently in [LOC India  ] , where [PER Waite  ] confessed he was having trouble getting meetings with the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Government’s  ] political level , presumably because of the elections underway . 
[PER Waite  ] characterized the [MISC Indians  ] as “ambivalent” and unwilling to undertake any heavy lifting on [LOC Sri Lanka  ] because it was “too sensitive” an issue during the elections . 
Next Steps ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [LOC UK  ] plans to continue its “concerted drive to achieve a fully inclusive political settlement , ” [PER Waite  ] said . 
The [ORG EU Troika  ] is visiting [LOC Sri Lanka  ] next week , and the [LOC UK  ] hopes this will maintain “sustained pressure” on the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] Government . 
[PER Miliband  ] and [ORG Kouchner  ] plan to jointly host an “informal” meeting in [LOC New York  ] on the margins of the [LOC Middle East  ] meetings on May 11 ( NFI ) . 
[PER Miliband  ] also plans to raise [LOC Sri Lanka  ] with [ORG USG  ] officials during his May 12 visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] also supports a special [ORG Human Rights Council  ] session on [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , and , according to [PER Waite  ] , [PER HMT  ] has decided to support the [ORG USG  ] position on delaying [LOC Sri Lanka’s  ] proposed [ORG Stand-By Arrangement  ] with the [ORG IMF  ] ( reftels D , E ) . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Waite  ] said that much of [LOC HMG  ] and ministerial attention to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] is due to the “very vocal” [MISC Tamil  ] [ORG Diaspora  ] in the [LOC UK  ] , numbering over 300,000 and who have been protesting in front of Parliament since April 6 . 
He said that with [LOC UK  ] elections on the horizon and many [MISC Tamils  ] living in [ORG Labour  ] constituencies with slim majorities , the Government is paying particular attention to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , with [PER Miliband  ] recently remarking to [PER Waite  ] that he was spending 60 percent of his time at the moment on [LOC Sri Lanka  ] .
