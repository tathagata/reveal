End summary . 
General Background ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) After the October financial crash , possible [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) membership and the adoption of the euro have become the most important political issue in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Only one political party , the Foreign Minister 's [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) , is outright pro-EU . 
On January 16 , the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) decided to put [ORG EU  ] accession negotiations on the party agenda given certain conditions . 
One more is likely to move in that direction at the end of January , namely the Prime Minister 's [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) . 
The [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LGM  ] ) will most likely continue to be against [ORG EU  ] membership , although it has been trying to placate voters by saying they would not be against holding a referendum on whether or not to start accession negotiations . 
The [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG LP  ] ) is reviewing the issue and will make a final decision at a party meeting in April . 
The [ORG LP  ] has been getting little support in the polls lately and could be wiped out in the next elections , that is if it fails to garner five percent of the vote that is needed to get at least one Member of [LOC Parliament  ] . 
January-February 2009 [ORG Progressive Party  ] --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On November 15 , the [ORG PP  ] central committee decided to move the party general meeting up to January 16-18 , instead of holding it in the fall of 2009 . 
The general meeting passed a proposal stating that [LOC Iceland  ] should start accession negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] , but offered a detailed list of conditions for [MISC Icelandic  ] membership . 
Some of these -- particularly on the use of [MISC Icelandic  ] natural resources and fisheries -- could pose challenges in talks with [LOC Brussels.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) On November 17 , [ORG PP Chair  ] [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] resigned as chairman of the party and as Member of [LOC Parliament  ] . 
On December 4 , [ORG PP  ] Deputy Chair [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] said she would not seek reelection as Deputy Chairman and would not be a candidate for the chairmanship of the party either . 
Hence , the [ORG PP  ] elected new leadership at the general meeting . 
The new chairman is a young political novice , [PER Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson  ] , a former news reporter . 
In so doing , the party turned its back on representatives of the past , as the positions of deputy chair and secretary were also filled with relatively new people. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In terms of party following it is difficult to say whether this change in policy would have a positive or a negative support , because it could simultaneously turn off rural voters , yet attract urban voters . 
However , the election of the new leadership may revitalize the party and make a more attractive alternative to voters . 
[ORG Independence Party  ] ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The central committee and the parliamentary group of the [ORG IP  ] decided on November 14 to move the party general meeting up to January 29-February 1 , instead of holding it in the fall of 2009 . 
The central committee and the parliamentary group also decided to appoint a [ORG European Committee  ] to discuss the pros and cons of [ORG EU  ] membership and reassess [LOC Iceland  ] 's position vis-a-vis the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [ORG European Committee  ] is supposed to conclude its work before the general meeting , and meeting attendees will then vote on a proposal stating that [LOC Iceland  ] should start accession negotiations with the [ORG EU.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The party 's general meeting is bound to offer heated debates . 
Most observers anticipate that the proposal on starting accession negotiations will be passed , however , this is not a given . 
If the proposal is struck down , the future of the current [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition is at risk of falling apart . 
On December 14 , [ORG SDA Chair  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] strongly indicated that a no-vote on that front would mean that the coalition would break down , which would require elections to be held . 
The pundits do [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000011 002 OF 003 not agree on whether the [ORG IP  ] could handle a drastic change in [ORG EU  ] policy ; some say it would split the party , others say it would be left intact . 
There are three possible scenarios: [ORG Scenario  ] 1 The general meeting resolves that [LOC Iceland  ] should apply for [ORG EU  ] membership and start accession negotiations . 
The party does not split and probably gains back some of the loss in party support over the preceding months . 
[ORG Scenario  ] 2 The general meeting resolves that [LOC Iceland  ] should apply for [ORG EU  ] membership and start accession negotiations . 
The party splits into two factions: 1 ) The old [ORG IP  ] that supported the [ORG EU  ] proposal and 2 ) The home-rule style anti-EU party . 
The [ORG IP  ] will lose a large share of its following , but would maintain the coalition with the [ORG SDA  ] . 
The breakaway party is likely to ally with the [ORG LGM  ] on [ORG EU  ] membership , especially in the run-up to a referendum on the [ORG EU  ] ( on accession negotiations and/or membership ) . 
[ORG Scenario  ] 3 The general meeting resolves that [LOC Iceland  ] should not apply for [ORG EU  ] membership and start accession negotiations . 
However , the election on the proposal will be close . 
The party stays intact , but will probably lose some of its following over to the [ORG SDA  ] and/or the [ORG PP  ] . 
Given the close election , voters will see that the [ORG IP  ] is split on the issue and pro-EU voters will therefore be reluctant to vote for the party in the next elections . 
Instead voters will flock to the [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG PP  ] , which are more likely to move [LOC Iceland  ] in the direction of [ORG EU  ] membership. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In terms of party leadership , [PER Geir Haarde  ] will most likely be reelected chairman despite some indications of discontent among the party rank-and-file . 
Deputy Chair [PER Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir  ] may be challenged to her position by MP [PER Bjarni Benediktsson  ] , who is tipped to soon replace [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] as the Minister of Justice . 
February 2009 ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Should the above predictions play out , there will possibly be three pro-EU parties in [MISC Iceland:  ] The [ORG IP  ] , the [ORG PP  ] , and the [ORG SDA  ] . 
All of them will advocate that [LOC Iceland  ] apply for [ORG EU  ] membership and start accession negotiations . 
February-April 2009 ------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One of two scenarios is likely to happen: 1 ) The government ( [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition ) drafts its objectives for accession negotiations , and decides to put the question of whether to start accession negotiations to a referendum . 
If passed , then the coalition parties present a bill in parliament on a constitutional amendment that would authorize ceding some of [LOC Iceland  ] 's sovereignty ( sharing sovereignty with an international body in which [LOC Iceland  ] has membership with full rights ) . 
The constitutional amendment would also stipulate that a referendum be held for this amendment to be passed . 
This would allow [LOC Iceland  ] to apply for [ORG EU  ] membership . 
Parliament passes the constitutional amendment . 
Then parliament would need to be dissolved and new elections called that would be held in the spring , or: 2 ) The government ( [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition ) drafts its objectives for accession negotiations , The [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition decides to apply for [ORG EU  ] membership and thus start accession negotiations . 
The coalition parties present a bill in parliament on a constitutional amendment that would authorize ceding some of [LOC Iceland  ] 's sovereignty ( sharing sovereignty with an international body in which [LOC Iceland  ] has membership with full rights ) . 
The constitutional amendment would also stipulate that a referendum be held for this amendment to be passed . 
This would allow [LOC Iceland  ] to apply for [ORG EU  ] membership . 
Parliament passes the constitutional amendment . 
Then parliament would need to be dissolved and new elections called that would be held in the spring . 
April/May 2009 -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Parliamentary elections where [ORG EU  ] membership will be fiercely debated . 
[MISC IP-SDA  ] government ( possibly with [ORG PP  ] participation or support ) . 
May/June 2009 ------------- [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000011 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Newly elected parliament passes for the second time the bill on the above-mentioned constitutional amendment . 
Accession negotiations between [LOC Iceland  ] and the [ORG EU  ] start in earnest . 
The negotiations could be concluded by October-December . 
December 2009-February 2010 --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When negotiations conclude , the government calls a referendum to vote on [ORG EU  ] membership per the new constitutional amendment . 
The other [ORG EU  ] member states ( 27 if no other country has joined by that time ) need to approve [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership at the same time . 
July 1 , 2010 ------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG EU  ] membership could take effect . 
Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The above timeline simplifies a number of issues that are likely to be very contentious , both in the domestic political arena as well as in discussions with the [ORG European Commission  ] and current [ORG EU  ] member states . 
Beyond the oft-cited fisheries question , there is also the problem of negotiations between [LOC Iceland  ] , [LOC Britain  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and [LOC Germany  ] over loans to cover [MISC Icelandic  ] bank deposit guarantees . 
Further , [ORG EU  ] member states , already nervous about the economic strength of the most recent new members , may be wary of admitting highly indebted [LOC Iceland  ] , years of positive comments by [ORG EU  ] Enlargement Commissioner [PER Olli Rehn  ] notwithstanding .
