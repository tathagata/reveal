( [ORG SBU  ] ) Overview of a country 's activities to eliminate trafficking in persons: -- [PER A. Is  ] the country a country of origin , transit , or destination for international trafficked men , women , or children ? 
Specify numbers for each group ; how they were trafficked , to where , and for what purpose . 
Does the trafficking occur within the country 's borders ? 
Does it occur in territory outside of the government 's control ( e.g. in a civil war situation ) ? 
Are any estimates or reliable numbers available as to the extent or magnitude of the problem ? 
Please include any numbers of victims . 
What is ( are ) the source ( s ) of available information on trafficking in persons or what plans are in place ( if any ) [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 002 OF 011 to undertake documentation of trafficking ? 
How reliable are the numbers and these sources ? 
Are certain groups of persons more at risk of being trafficked ( e.g. women and children , boys versus girls , certain ethnic groups , refugees , etc . 
) ? 
[LOC Iceland  ] is primarily a transit country for trafficked persons , but there are isolated cases of destination and theoretically cases of origin ( as described ref C ; no new cases identified in this reporting period ) as well . 
Cases in the period covered by this report total well under 100 . 
Putative cases fall into several categories , none of which involves more than a handful of documented victims: young [MISC Asian  ] men and women caught attempting to transit [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] ; undocumented [ORG Eastern European  ] workers in construction and manufacturing ; `mail-order' or `Internet' brides ( both [ORG Eastern European  ] and [MISC Asian  ] ) trapped with abusive , controlling [MISC Icelandic  ] husbands ; and underpaid and/or mistreated workers in nightclubs and massage parlors . 
The only information available on TIP is hearsay , with the exception of one notorious case , documented in civil court records , from the [LOC Reykjavik  ] suburb of [LOC Kopavogur  ] . 
Even NGO and labor union representatives who believe TIP exists in [LOC Iceland  ] are unable to offer numbers , and there are no plans in place to undertake documentation . 
Indeed , most post sources express gratitude for Embassy [ORG Reykjavik  ] 's undertaking in researching this report , with many requesting copies of the completed draft . 
( Note: if , as in the past , the Department does not publish a report on [LOC Iceland  ] , post will edit this one to remove sensitive material and send contacts the edited version . 
End note . 
) ------------------ [ORG Suburban Nightmare  ] ------------------ The [LOC Kopavogur  ] case mentioned above ( and ref C ) involved a [MISC Chinese  ] national in his twenties who had worked at a massage parlor owned by an [MISC Icelandic  ] woman of [MISC Chinese  ] origin . 
The woman had hired the man with the consent of his parents in [LOC China  ] , whom she told she would pay their son [ORG IKR  ] 10,000 ( [LOC US  ] $151 ) a month , far below the mandated minimum wage in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The man ultimately worked as a legitimate massage therapist ( i.e. , not providing sexual services ) at the massage parlor for 18 months , quitting in December 2003 . 
He himself did not receive any pay ; instead the woman sent his meager paycheck to his parents in [LOC China  ] . 
He did get room and board but had to sleep on a massage table in a 20-square- meter room in a basement with two other men . 
In January 2006 he won a civil suit demanding to be paid according to [MISC Icelandic  ] collective bargaining agreements and was awarded [ORG IKR  ] 4.7 million ( [LOC US  ] $70,890 ) in back wages . 
Even though the employer had forged the man 's signature on the employment contract and forced him to work 12 hours a day , six days a week , and nine hours a day on Sundays , [LOC Kopavogur  ] authorities declined to launch a criminal prosecution . 
National officials , while uneasy with the case 's handling , said they could not controvert local prosecutors' judgment . 
As he was a qualified massage therapist , the victim in this case did manage to stay in [LOC Iceland  ] by finding another , properly remunerated job at a different massage parlor. --------------- Desperate Wives --------------- Social service providers report regular contacts with a population of foreign women who have immigrated to [LOC Iceland  ] to marry [MISC Icelandic  ] citizens whom they have met on-line or through friends and relatives already married to Icelanders . 
Some of these women live in circumstances akin to slavery . 
A lawyer for the capital 's [ORG Intercultural Center  ] offered an example of one [MISC Icelandic  ] husband who quit work and insisted that his [MISC Chinese  ] wife work three jobs to support him . 
Only able to sleep for four hours a night , she eventually suffered a breakdown . 
Some Icelanders at one of her workplaces found her pro bono legal assistance , thanks to which she obtained a divorce and permits to remain and work in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [ORG Intercultural Center  ] lawyer learns of several such cases a year , most often involving " extremely beautiful " [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] women in their twenties [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 003 OF 011 brought to [LOC Iceland  ] as " trophies " by men in their fifties . 
The women work long hours , and their husbands take their salaries ; some of the men reportedly also sell sexual access to their wives. ----------------------- The [ORG Underground Economy ----------------------- Undocumented  ] foreign workers in [LOC Iceland  ] 's booming construction sector may be exploited . 
Most sources , including those who have had contact with these so-called " ghost workers , " stress that the men are willingly working illegally in [LOC Iceland  ] in order to make up to four times the normal income in their [MISC Eastern-European/Baltic  ] home countries ; and opine that these are cases of immigrant and employment law violations rather than trafficking in persons . 
The `victims' enter the country on tourist visas or as Schengen zone residents and proceed to work without obtaining work permits . 
Generally they have been paid well below union-mandated minimum wages , denied medical coverage , and worked very long hours while living in sub-standard housing or even sleeping on building sites . 
Judging by anecdotal evidence from press accounts , such cases may number in the dozens , but no [MISC Icelandic  ] institution has undertaken a formal estimate . 
( Note: at the end of 2005 there were 13,778 foreign citizens with legal residence in [LOC Iceland  ] , or 4.6 percent of the population . 
With such a small number of foreigners residing in the country , non- natives continue to stick out , making authorities' job of identifying undocumented workers easier than elsewhere . 
Nevertheless , deportations remain rare . 
) [MISC Icelandic  ] labor unions , eager to protect their members' economic interests , have taken the lead in protesting substandard treatment of cheap foreign labor . 
They have started inspecting conditions at work sites , including construction sites and restaurants , noting the number and nationalities of workers employed . 
Also , [MISC Icelandic  ] employees report to the unions on working conditions and treatment of foreigners and thus act as a check on mistreatment. ------------- The [ORG Sex Trade  ] ------------- While there may be isolated cases of trafficking of women , in particular those of [ORG Eastern European  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] origin , for sexual work in [LOC Iceland  ] , as post has previously reported the tide appeared to turn with 2003 and subsequent changes in local regulations to outlaw lap dances . 
The police report that they regularly monitor strip clubs in order to ensure that they comply with applicable regulations , particularly those outlawing private dances . 
Police say they have not seen any signs of prostitution at , or in connection with , the clubs . 
The owner of the country 's best- known remaining strip joint , Goldfinger in [LOC Kopavogur  ] , denies illegal activity . 
An Embassy employee who visited the establishment was , however , offered sexual services - suggesting that business owners and police at a minimum turn a blind eye to illicit activity that puts women at risk . 
He also noted that one of the dancers appeared to have a black eye , which could suggest - albeit anecdotally - abuse related to her employment . 
Administrators of a national charity that provides food and cothing to indigents suspect that prostitution is idespread in [LOC Iceland  ] , based on their observation o mainly foreign women with expired residence perits who seek assistance although they are well dessed and carry mobile telephones . 
In a few insances the women have given hotels as their home adresses . 
The charity does not , however , investigte the circumstances of the women 's travel to and employment in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Administrators of the fee [MISC Icelandic  ] dating website einkamal.is report istances of posters to the site soliciting and offring prostitution . 
Those offering sexual service for a fee have been both [MISC Icelandic  ] and of foreign origin , primarily from former [MISC Eastern  ] bloc counties . 
The levels of organization and coercion areunknown , and government authorities leave it to te site to monitor its [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 004.3 OF 011 own use . 
In a written reply to post queries , the site administrator told us: " We don't censor the website in any way ; the communications between users , that take place via email , are not `monitored.' 
However , we definitely intervene , and close a user 's account , when appropriate , if complaints are brought against that user , for example for prostituting himself/herself or for asking for prostitution or other such services . 
" It is difficult to say whether this is widespread on our website . 
Of roughly 47 thousand users ( approximately 90 thousand registrations are on the website , two thirds are male and one third is female ) we need to interfere with 10 users on average per week or about 40 a month . 
Many of those users' accounts are closed down . 
We therefore need to interfere with about 1% of users . 
" Virtually all the instances ( when einkamal.is interferes or closes down an account ) involve the solicitation of illegal services , such as prostitution or other things that don't conform with einkamal.is' terms of use , including use by underage children.. . 
I don't have information on how this is divided , but we believe that advertisements/postings for prostitution are over 90% of the cases ( where we feel we need to interfere ) . 
" We get a considerable number of complaints , mostly from women who feel they have received `indecent' proposals from registered male users on the website , where men are looking for sex and quite often offer to pay . 
In these cases , our reaction is to send them a warning and ask that they stick to decency and that they familiarize themselves with the terms of use . 
If we don't get a reaction from them , then we close their accounts . 
These users rarely contact us after their accounts have been closed , and their accounts have only a few times been reopened . 
" There are also , albeit rare , examples where men point out and simply complain about registered female users on the website that offer `thorough' services and even send a `price list/rate list.' 
" I have no concrete examples regarding the victimization of users on einkamal.is . 
However , some users have both called and emailed me , after having given personal information to other users and exchanged emails with them , and then having been stalked by them . 
No police cases have arisen and the cases have been resolved on their own . 
I am not aware of any rapes or violent crimes following meetings between individuals who started to talk/chat on our website , but I think I would probably know if something like that would come up , such as if charges were pressed . 
" -- [PER B. Please  ] provide a general overview of the trafficking situation in the country and any changes since the last TIP Report ( e.g. changes in direction ) . 
Also briefly explain the political will to address trafficking in persons . 
Other items to address may include: What kind of conditions are the victims trafficked into ? 
Which populations are targeted by the traffickers ? 
Who are the traffickers ? 
What methods are used to approach victims ? ( Are they offered lucrative jobs , sold by their families , approached by friends of friends , etc. ? ) What methods are used to move the victims ( e.g. , are false documents being used ? ) . 
Suspected trafficking cases have much the same profile as in post 's previous TIP report ( ref B ) . 
Post notes two changes: ( 1 ) our sources cite even less evidence of a TIP problem than in the past , although they acknowledge that this could be due to a shift in public attention toward other social problems , in particular domestic violence and incest ; ( 2 ) the media are reporting more cases in which an - extremely small - underground economy seems to entrap workers in situations where they earn less than native workers and live in unsanitary conditions . 
These latter cases , however , are not necessarily tantamount to modern-day slavery so much as indicative of uneven enforcement of a labor regime that is in general very generous to workers . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 005 OF 011 In December 2005 the [ORG Althingi  ] ( [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament ) passed legislation to regulate temporary-work agencies and protect their employees , e.g. by prohibiting charging fees to hires ; requiring written contracts specifying work to be performed ; and guaranteeing the right of employees to change employers . 
The [ORG Directorate of Labor of the Social Affairs Ministry  ] is charged with enforcing the new law . 
As the number of cases of ostensible trafficking has diminished , so has the political will to address the ( potential ) problem . 
Minister of [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Ecclesiastical Affairs  ] [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] has in recent months downplayed the possibility that vulnerable groups ( such as economic migrants and sex workers ) might face exploitation in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] may be a country without a TIP problem ( after all , there has never been an explicitly " TIP " prosecution here ) , or it may be a country in deep denial . 
Even those who would ordinarily be victims' advocates seem unable to say which . 
-- [PER C. What  ] are the limitations on the government 's ability to address this problem in practice ? 
For example , is funding for police or other institutions inadequate ? 
Is overall corruption a problem ? 
Does the government lack the resources to aid victims ? 
Overall corruption is not a problem , with [LOC Iceland  ] habitually ranked in independent surveys as one of the world 's least corrupt societies . 
Funding for police and other institutions that are on the TIP front lines is adequate for a reactive approach but inadequate to fund active measures to prevent potential new cases . 
Programs to provide emergency shelter and crime victim compensation , which in theory could be used to help TIP victims , have rarely been tested in the trafficking context . 
-- [PER D. To  ] what extent does the government systematically monitor its anti-trafficking efforts ( on all fronts -- prosecution , prevention and victim protection ) and periodically make available , publicly or privately and directly or through regional/international organizations , its assessments of these anti-trafficking efforts ? 
There is no systematic government monitoring of anti- trafficking efforts as such - i.e. , none beyond ordinary recordkeeping as to laws proposed and passed . 
Responsibility for anti-trafficking work has passed back and forth between the [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Social Affairs Ministries  ] . 
Currently it is at the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] , where other priorities have zeroed out resources available for [MISC TIP-  ] related work. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PREVENTION: -- [PER A. Does  ] the government acknowledge that trafficking is a problem in that country ? 
If no , why not ? 
Government officials acknowledge that [LOC Iceland  ] , despite its geographic isolation and privileged , homogeneous population , is not wholly unique and thus probably has a trafficking problem . 
They are , however , hard-pressed to supply examples - aside from those of transit cases , which in any case have never been prosecuted as such , but rather as smuggling cases or forgery cases where there are false documents . 
-- [PER B. Which  ] government agencies are involved in anti- trafficking efforts and which agency , if any , has the lead ? 
The following agencies are involved in anti-trafficking efforts: -- [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( including the [ORG Directorate of Immigration  ] , State Prosecutor 's Office , and National Commissioner of Police and local police forces ) : lead agency . 
-- [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] ( including the [MISC Keflavik  ] Commissioner of Police and Customs ) -- [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] ( including the [ORG Equal Rights Office and Directorate of Labor  ] ) [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 006 OF 011 -- [PER C. Are  ] there , or have there been , government-run anti- trafficking information or education campaigns ? 
If so , briefly describe the campaign ( s ) , including their objectives and effectiveness . 
Do these campaigns target potential trafficking victims and/or the demand for trafficking ( e.g . 
" clients " of prostitutes or beneficiaries of forced labor ) . 
There has been no [MISC Icelandic  ] government public outreach or information campaign on TIP in the reporting period . 
-- [PER D. Does  ] the government support other programs to prevent trafficking ? ( e.g. , to promote women 's participation in economic decision-making or efforts to keep children in school . 
) Please explain . 
There are no government trafficking-prevention programs as such . 
-- [PER F. What  ] is the relationship between government officials , [ORG NGOs  ] , other relevant organizations and other elements of civil society on the trafficking issue ? 
NGO representatives complain that the government does not invite their participation in the early stages of legislative drafting and policy planning . 
Government officials express the view that inviting civil society to comment on fully-drawn proposals ought to be sufficient . 
In spite of this tension , individual relationships within the small circle of those who regularly work on this issue are cordial and professional . 
-- [PER G. Does  ] the government monitor immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking ? 
Do law enforcement agencies screen for potential trafficking victims along borders ? 
The government monitors immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking ; and screens for potential trafficking victims at [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] . 
The country has no land borders . 
Authorities at [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] arrested a [MISC Singaporean  ] national and four [MISC Chinese  ] citizens on arrival on May 17 , 2005 . 
On June 2 , 2005 , [ORG Reykjanes District Court  ] sentenced the [MISC Singaporean  ] citizen to six months in prison for attempting to facilitate the illegal travel of the four [MISC Chinese  ] nationals , who were carrying look-alike passports , from the [LOC United Kingdom  ] to the [LOC United States  ] via [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[MISC Keflavik  ] authorities also arrested an [MISC American  ] and two [MISC Chinese  ] citizens on July 7 , 2005 , attempting to depart [LOC Iceland  ] . 
On July 21 , 2005 , [ORG Reykjanes District Court  ] sentenced the [MISC American  ] to four months in prison for facilitating the illegal travel of the [MISC Chinese  ] , who were carrying look-alike passports , from [LOC Sweden  ] to the [LOC United States  ] via [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] citizens had stayed in [LOC Iceland  ] for two days prior to their attempted onward travel . 
-- [PER H. Is  ] there a mechanism for coordination and communication between various agencies , internal , international , and multilateral on trafficking-related matters , such as a multi-agency working group or a task force ? 
Does the government have a trafficking in persons working group or single point of contact ? 
Does the government have a public corruption task force ? 
There is no purely domestic anti-trafficking task force ; nor is there a public corruption task force . 
In February 2006 a parliamentary task force that had been established in November 2004 issued a comprehensive report that compared [MISC Icelandic  ] and foreign , mostly [MISC Nordic  ] , legislation on prostitution , TIP , and related issues . 
The report 's aim was to contribute to public discussion on revamping [MISC Icelandic  ] legislation on sexual offenses , but its authors did not reach a consensus opinion . 
-- [PER J. Does  ] the government have a national plan of action to address trafficking in persons ? 
If so , which agencies were involved in developing it ? 
Were [ORG NGOs  ] consulted in the process ? 
What steps has the government taken to disseminate the action plan ? 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 007 OF 011 [LOC Iceland  ] does not have a national plan of action to address [ORG TIP.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS: -- [PER A. Does  ] the country have a law specifically prohibiting trafficking in persons--both trafficking for sexual exploitation and trafficking for non-sexual purposes ( e.g. forced labor ) ? 
If so , what is the law ? 
Does the law ( s ) cover both internal and external ( transnational ) forms of trafficking ? 
If not , under what other laws can traffickers be prosecuted ? 
For example , are there laws against slavery or the exploitation of prostitution by means of coercion or fraud ? 
Are these other laws being used in trafficking cases ? 
Are these laws , taken together , adequate to cover the full scope of trafficking in persons ? 
Please provide a full inventory of trafficking laws , including civil penalties ( e.g. , civil forfeiture laws and laws against illegal debt ) . 
Passed into law March 10 , 2003 , Article 227a of [LOC Iceland  ] 's General [ORG Penal Code  ] outlaws trafficking in persons . 
The government has not yet brought any prosecutions under it , choosing instead to use General [ORG Penal Code Articles  ] 57 and 155 , which outlaw alien smuggling and document forgery , respectively . 
-- [PER B. What  ] are the penalties for traffickers of people for sexual exploitation ? 
For traffickers of people for labor exploitation ? 
Trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation , for forced labor , or for removal of organs is punishable by up to eight years in prison . 
-- [PER C. What  ] are the penalties for rape or forcible sexual assault ? 
How do they compare to the penalty for sex trafficking ? 
Rape is punishable by up to 16 years in prison , but even especially brutal rapes rarely draw sentences of more than six years , with one or two years' imprisonment more common . 
As there have been no prosecutions for sex trafficking in [LOC Iceland  ] it is impossible to compare actual penalties . 
-- [PER D. Is  ] prostitution legalized or decriminalized ? 
Specifically , are the activities of the prostitute criminalized ? 
Are the activities of the brothel owner/operator , clients , pimps , and enforcers criminalized ? 
Are these laws enforced ? 
If prostitution is legal and regulated , what is the legal minimum age for this activity ? 
Note that in many countries with federalist systems , prostitution laws may be covered by state , local , and provincial authorities . 
Prostitution in [LOC Iceland  ] is illegal as a main source of income . 
It is permissible for individuals to engage in isolated sales of sex , however , as long as both parties are at least 18 years old . 
The activities of clients are not criminalized . 
It is illegal for any third party to earn his or her income from someone 's prostitution ( the exact term in the law is " promiscuity " ) , e.g. by pimping or renting out premises . 
The government plans to introduce a bill in parliament March 8 that would make prostitution legal even as a main source of income but would ban its advertisement . 
The opposition [ORG Left Green  ] party has for several years introduced a bill in the [ORG Althingi  ] to criminalize the activities of clients , as in [LOC Sweden  ] , but the government has repeatedly blocked the bill 's passage on the ground that [LOC Iceland  ] does not confront the level of street prostitution seen in its [MISC Nordic  ] neighbors . 
In February 2006 [LOC Iceland  ] 's daily newspaper of record , Morgunbladid , printed a cartoon of [LOC Iceland  ] 's libertarian Minister of Justice dressed as a female prostitute telling a client that it was all right to remove his mask . 
In the background , bare breasts and feet are seen poking out from urban windows , suggesting an editorial concern that [ORG Reykjavik  ] may be destined to become one big red-light [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 008 OF 011 district . 
-- [PER E. Has  ] the Government prosecuted any cases against traffickers ? 
If so , provide numbers of investigations , prosecutions , convictions , and sentences , including details on plea bargains and fines , if relevant and available . 
Are the traffickers serving the time sentenced: If no , why not ? 
Please indicate whether the government can provide this information , and if not , why not ? ( Note: complete answers to this section are essential . 
End Note ) No , the Government has not prosecuted any cases against traffickers . 
-- [PER F. Is  ] there any information or reports of who is behind the trafficking ? 
For example , are the traffickers freelance operators , small crime groups , and/or large international organized crime syndicates ? 
Are employment , travel , and tourism agencies or marriage brokers fronting for traffickers or crime groups to traffic individuals ? 
Are government officials involved ? 
Are there any reports of where profits from trafficking in persons are being channeled ? ( e.g. armed groups , terrorist organizations , judges , banks , etc . 
) The [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] and police say they have no data on who is behind any alleged trafficking beyond individual business owners who themselves stand to profit . 
Some officials suspect that [LOC Hell  ] 's [ORG Angels  ] and [ORG Bandidos  ] gangs in [LOC Scandinavia  ] may be involved in provision of nude dancers . 
The [ORG Keflavik District Commissioner  ] posits that large international crime organizations are behind possible transit cases ( that , as noted above , have not been prosecuted as such ) . 
He believes that branches of these organizations in the country of origin ( usually [LOC China  ] ) and country of destination ( usually the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) split the profits of their activity . 
-- [PER G. Does  ] the government actively investigate cases of trafficking ? ( Again , the focus should be on trafficking cases versus migrant smuggling cases . 
) Does the government use active investigative techniques in trafficking in persons investigations ? 
To the extent possible under domestic law , are techniques such as electronic surveillance , undercover operations , and mitigated punishment or immunity for cooperating suspects used by the government ? 
Does the criminal procedure code or other laws prohibit the police from engaging in covert operations ? 
As there have been no trafficking cases as such in the reporting period , answers here are general: Police are not permitted to engage in covert operations , but the government does use other active investigative techniques , including electronic surveillance . 
The law does not provide for immunity for cooperating suspects , but in practice deals do get made . 
In general , opportunities for mitigated punishment are de facto available , but there is no precedent to evaluate their use in trafficking cases . 
-- [PER H. Does  ] the government provide any specialized training for government officials in how to recognize , investigate , and prosecute instances of trafficking ? 
Students from the [ORG Icelandic National Police College  ] annually participate in classes held by the [ORG Keflavik Airport Commissioner of Police and Customs  ] that include instruction on recognizing and investigating human trafficking issues . 
Senior [ORG Keflavik  ] officials have themselves been funded by the government to attend trafficking courses abroad , e.g. at the [ORG European Police  ] [MISC Academy.  ] --I . 
Does the government cooperate with other governments in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases ? 
If possible , can post provide the number of cooperative international investigations on trafficking ? 
No such cooperation took place in the reporting period , but experience with other types of international crime , including alien and drug smuggling , suggests that such cooperation would be forthcoming if requested . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 009 OF 011 -- [PER J. Does  ] the government extradite persons who are charged with trafficking in other countries ? 
If so , can post provide the number of traffickers extradited ? 
Does the government extradite its own nationals charged with such offenses ? 
If not , is the government prohibited by law form extraditing its own nationals ? 
If so , what is the government doing to modify its laws to permit the extradition of its own nationals ? 
[LOC Iceland  ] has not been asked to extradite a trafficking suspect to another country . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] law does not permit extradition of [MISC Icelandic  ] nationals , and no changes to the law are currently planned . 
-- [PER K. Is  ] there evidence of government involvement in or tolerance of trafficking , on a local or institutional level ? 
If so , please explain in detail . 
No ; not applicable . 
-- [PER L. If  ] government officials are involved in trafficking , what steps has the government taken to end such participation ? 
Have any government officials been prosecuted for involvement in trafficking or trafficking- related corruption ? 
Have any been convicted ? 
What actual sentence was imposed ? 
Please provide specific numbers , if available . 
There is no evidence of government officials being involved in trafficking , and no government officials have ever been prosecuted or convicted for such activity . 
-- [PER M. If  ] the country has an identified child sex tourism problem ( as source or destination ) , how many foreign pedophiles has the government prosecuted or deported/extradited to their country of origin ? 
Does the country 's child sexual abuse laws have extraterritorial coverage ( like the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG PROTECT Act  ] ) ?

PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS: [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 010 OF 011 -- [PER A. Does  ] the government assist victims , for example , by providing temporary to permanent residency status , relief from deportation , shelter and access to legal , medical and psychological services ? 
If so , please explain . 
Does the country have victim care and victim health care facilities ? 
If so , can post provide the number of victims placed in these care facilities ? 
There is no de jure provision for government assistance to TIP victims . 
In theory , municipal social services and medical care are available to victims as to other citizens and , thanks to reimbursements to municipalities from the [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] , foreigners . 
In cases involving unaccompanied children municipal and state child protection services are responsible for assistance . 
The national and local governments may also refer to [ORG NGO  ] 's that provide food , shelter , legal advice , and health care . 
While there is also no de jure provision for grants of residence to TIP victims , in practice the [ORG Immigration Authority  ] has used its discretion to offer permits to foreign women escaping abusive , exploitative marriages . 
Neither government nor [MISC Embassy  ] sources could identify any TIP victims assisted during the reporting period , with the possible exception of a [MISC Kenyan  ] woman whom the [ORG NGO  ] 's suspect was trafficked to [LOC Britain  ] for prostitution before escaping to [LOC Iceland  ] in unclear circumstances . 
The woman is currently seeking asylum in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Pregnant , she requested an abortion , but when the government had no mechanism to fund one an [ORG NGO  ] stepped in to do so . 
-- [PER B. Does  ] the government provide funding or other forms of support to foreign or domestic [ORG NGOs  ] for services to victims ? 
Please explain . 
The primary [ORG NGOs  ] that provide services to victims of what may be trafficking receive considerable financial assistance from the government . 
The state budget annually allocates [MISC IKR  ] 30.9 million ( [LOC US  ] $461,000 ) to the Women 's Shelter and [MISC IKR  ] 25.3 million ( [LOC US  ] $377,600 ) to the [ORG Icelandic Counseling and Information Center for Survivors of Sexual Violence  ] ( Stigamot ) . 
Other [ORG NGOs  ] have variable allocations from the state budget . 
One of those is the Women 's [ORG Advice Center  ] , a legal clinic that will receive [MISC IKR  ] 700,000 ( [MISC US$  ] 10,448 ) in <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006 . 
These funds are not specially earmarked for services to TIP victims . 
The government does not provide funding to foreign [ORG NGOs  ] for services to victims . 
-- [PER C. Is  ] there a screening and referral process in place , when appropriate , to transfer victims detained , arrested or placed in protective custody by law enforcement authorities to [ORG NGO  ] 's that provide short- or long-term care ? 
Again it is unclear that there are any victims of trafficking per se , but the [ORG Icelandic Red Cross  ] has in the past assisted persons alleged to have been smuggled . 
Such individuals have been housed in hostels and guesthouses in advance of their deportation . 
-- [PER D. Are  ] the rights of victims respected , or are victims also treated as criminals ? 
Are victims detained , jailed , or deported ? 
If detained or jailed , for how long ? 
Are victims fined ? 
Are victims prosecuted for violations of other laws , such as those governing immigration or prostitution ? 
Possible trafficking victims have been prosecuted under laws governing immigration . 
Typically they have been detained and jailed for from 30 to 45 days in advance of deportation . 
The [ORG Keflavik Police  ] Commissioner reports that some have been offered residence in [LOC Iceland  ] on compassionate grounds , but in every instance they have turned down the offer -- he believes because they are desperate to return to their countries of origin to arrange repayment of their traffickers in order to avoid violent retaliation against themselves and their families . 
-- [PER E. Does  ] the government encourage victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking ? 
May victims [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 011 OF 011 file civil suits or seek legal action against the traffickers ? 
Does anyone impede the victims' access to such legal redress ? 
If a victim is a material witness in a court case against the former employer , is the victim permitted to obtain other employment or to leave the country ? 
Is there a victim restitution program ? 
The government encourages victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking . 
Victims may file civil suits or seek legal action against the traffickers . 
No one impedes victims' access to such legal redress . 
There is no specific provision in the law to permit a material witness in a court case against a former employer to obtain other employment or leave the country ; however , the government has adequate discretion to make such accommodations . 
There is no specific restitution program for victims for trafficking in persons , but there is one for victims of violence . 
-- [PER F. What  ] kind of protection is the government able to provide for victims and witnesses ? 
Does it provide these protections in practice ? 
What type of shelter or services does the government provide ? 
Does it provide shelter or any other benefits to victims for housing or other resources in order to aid the victims in rebuilding their lives ? 
Where are child victims placed ( e.g. in shelters , foster-care type systems or juvenile justice detention centers ) ? 
Please see section 5A , above . 
-- [PER G. Does  ] the government provide any specialized training for government officials in recognizing trafficking and in the provision of assistance to trafficked victims , including the special needs of trafficked children ? 
Does the government provide training on protections and assistance to its embassies and consulates in foreign countries that are destination or transit countries ? 
Does it urge those embassies and consulates to develop ongoing relationships with [ORG NGOs  ] that serve trafficked victims ? 
The answer to each of these questions is no . 
That said , the [MISC Nordic Baltic Task Force  ] against Trafficking in [MISC Human Beings  ] , of which [LOC Iceland  ] is a member , intends to deepen the cooperation between [MISC Nordic  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] embassies in order to increase efforts to assist victims of trafficking and eradicate TIP . 
The [ORG Task Force  ] also encourages the governments of the [MISC Nordic  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] states to develop networks that facilitate the exchange of information on trafficking trends and to educate the diplomatic corps working in countries of destination . 
-- [PER H. Does  ] the government provide assistance , such as medical aid , shelter , or financial help , to its repatriated nationals who are victims of trafficking ? 
There have been no such cases identified in the reporting period . 
While repatriated nationals would benefit from the same social safety net as any other [MISC Icelander  ] , there are no programs specifically for victims of trafficking . 
-- [PER I. Which  ] international organizations or [ORG NGOs  ] , if any , work with trafficking victims ? 
What type of services do they provide ? 
What sort of cooperation do they receive from local authorities ? 
None/not applicable .
