( C ) Summary . 
[ORG Hamas  ] was more than a week late in paying January salaries and , according to Post 's [LOC Gaza  ] contacts , has not yet paid those salaries in full . 
While most contacts report that [ORG Hamas  ] faces a liquidity crisis , they disagree on the cause . 
[ORG Hamas  ] reportedly relies heavily on foreign assistance to support its budget , and the current cash flow problem is most likely a result of [MISC Egyptian  ] anti-smuggling efforts . 
[MISC Gaza-based  ] contacts report that [ORG Hamas  ] is cutting costs and increasing its internal revenue collection , through taxes and fees . 
The amount of extra revenue that these efforts can generate is limited , however . 
[MISC Gazans  ] speculate that recent real estate investments may also have tied up some of [ORG Hamas  ] 's available cash . 
End summary . 
Making Payroll ? --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) According to Post contacts in [LOC Gaza  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] was late in paying January salaries to civil servants on its payroll , and has not yet paid those salaries in full . 
While [ORG Hamas  ] salary payments are typically available on the first day of every month , employees of the de facto [ORG Hamas  ] government did not line up at post offices or the [ORG Islamic National Bank  ] ( the two institutions that [ORG Hamas  ] uses to disburse salaries ) until February 8 when , according to contacts , [ORG Hamas  ] paid low-level employees with salaries up to [MISC NIS  ] 1,500 ( USD 400 ) per month . 
On February 11 , [ORG Hamas  ] began paying half-salaries for mid-level employees . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( a [MISC Gaza-based  ] manager at the [MISC Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committee  ] ) told Econoff that while he was picking up his exit permit at the [MISC Hamas-run  ] " [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , " he overheard an employee complain on the phone that his salary was late and he would only receive a portion of it . 
The employee further complained that this was at least the third month he had received only a " portion . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) According to press reports , [ORG Hamas  ] has more than 34,000 employees on its payroll who receive USD 16 million in monthly salaries . 
Comment: While we understand these figures to include security forces , our contacts claim no insight into [ORG Hamas  ] military structures and cannot confirm the status of salary payments to security personnel . 
Reports of [ORG Hamas  ] 's total wage bill vary widely . 
End Comment . 
[ORG Hamas  ] 's Cash Flow Problem ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Post contacts uniformly commented on [ORG Hamas  ] 's lack of liquidity , but interpret the nature and depth of the problem differently . 
All agree that [ORG Hamas  ] relies heavily on external funding to cover its expenditures , particularly salaries . 
[MISC Gazan  ] businessman [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that he met with the [ORG Hamas  ] " Minister of [ORG National Economy  ] , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who claimed that [ORG Hamas  ] collects USD 3.5 to 4 million every month through fees and taxes within [LOC Gaza  ] , though its monthly expenditures are USD 25 million . 
The shortfall is met by funding from outside [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reportedly said . 
For instance , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , employee salaries at [ORG Hamas  ] 's " [ORG Ministry of Education  ] " -- except those receiving salaries from the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) in [LOC Ramallah  ] -- are covered by [MISC Qatari  ] donations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to continued [MISC Israeli  ] restrictions , contacts attribute the liquidity problem to tighter [MISC Egyptian  ] security measures on its border with [LOC Gaza  ] , including increased interference with smuggling operations . 
[LOC Gaza  ] contacts note that [LOC Egypt  ] has also cracked down on the travel of [ORG Hamas  ] officials outside [LOC Gaza  ] by restricting their access through the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing . 
In particular , [LOC Egypt  ] reportedly no longer tolerates " [ORG Hamas  ] VIP bags , " a reference to suitcases of cash transported across the [LOC Rafah  ] border into [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Our contacts believe current inflows of cash are generally restricted to the tunnels. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a [MISC Gaza-based  ] NGO employee , told Econoff that he believes money can easily pass through the tunnels , but the cash flow has been disrupted elsewhere . 
Other contacts also report that trade flows through the tunnels remain robust . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that [LOC Egypt  ] has been effective in countering bulk cash smuggling within its own borders , thus making it unavailable to smuggle through the tunnels into [LOC Gaza.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Another [LOC Gaza  ] contact reported rumors that [ORG Hamas  ] has sufficient funds to pay full salaries for six months , but that it is protecting its fiscal position by holding back on payments . 
By cutting some salaries , [ORG Hamas  ] may be able to stretch the payments out over the full year without external funding. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to a local contact , [ORG Fatah Central Council  ] member [PER Nabil Shaath  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] authorities agreed last week to allow some [MISC PA-salaried  ] employees , who had stopped reporting to work , to return to their civil service jobs in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[ORG Hamas  ] will apparently then terminate the contracts of those who had been hired to replace the absent [ORG PA  ] employees. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a [MISC Gaza-based  ] board member of the [ORG Palestinian IT Association  ] , believes that money continues to flow into [LOC Gaza  ] and that [ORG Hamas  ] is more stable financially than it appears . 
He reports that [ORG Hamas  ] has increased its real estate investments inside [LOC Gaza  ] , partly explaining its shortage of cash , and described recent bids on properties by [ORG Hamas  ] brokers at well above market prices . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that purchasing real estate is a sustainable investment for [ORG Hamas  ] , a money laundering scheme , and/or part of strategy to strengthen its financial position ( or physical presence ) in [LOC Gaza  ] as a bulwark against future events. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC Palestinian  ] bankers claim the delay in salary payments is proof that [ORG Hamas  ] cannot borrow from the formal financial sector in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Internal Revenue ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Several contacts report that [ORG Hamas  ] is both cutting costs and increasing collection of revenue from inside [LOC Gaza  ] . 
They noted that the potential benefit to [ORG Hamas  ] is limited due to the current economic situation. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) According to multiple contacts , municipalities in [LOC Gaza  ] are stepping up the collection of electricity and water bills . 
[MISC Hamas-run  ] ministries also charge fees for various services , like the issuance of official documents . 
The first-time " registration " fee for a car is USD 12,000 , and one contact reported that 40 new cars were recently imported from [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Gazans must also pay an annual fee to renew their car or motorcycle registration . 
New traffic signs are being installed , and traffic laws are being aggressively enforced by the police . 
For an infraction , according to a [MISC Gazan  ] contact , police typically confiscate a driver 's license or car documents and require the driver to retrieve his documents at a police station , where he will likely pay a penalty fee . 
In one anecdotal account of more rigorous traffic controls , a man who used his van to transport children to school was confronted by [ORG Hamas  ] authorities and instructed to register his van as a school bus , and then pay the requisite taxes. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Local NGOs report that [ORG Hamas  ] is demanding income tax , with payments in cash in order to bypass the official banking sector . 
A [LOC Gaza  ] contact reported that one NGO deposited a tax payment for [ORG Hamas  ] on February 10 at the post office , deducted from staff salaries . 
Another contact said that [ORG Hamas  ] now demands private schools to pay taxes based on tuition fees , and threatens to shut down schools for non-compliance . 
Other contacts have commented on increased taxes and fees on [MISC Gazan  ] businesses .
