[PER David N. Greenlee  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: President [PER Evo Morales  ] keeps several close advisers who facilitate and carry out his personal agenda but have limited influence on the President 's decisionmaking . 
They are split between those who work behind the scenes to facilitate [MISC Morales'  ] vision and those who are charged with intimidating the opposition , especially in [ORG Congress  ] . 
This cable is part three of a three-part series examining how [PER Morales  ] has structured his advisory circle . 
End summary. ----------------- Behind the Scenes ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Morales  ] has several behind-the-scenes operators whose names rarely show up in open sources , but which sensitive reporting indicates are key [PER Morales  ] advisers . 
They appear to be loyal to [MISC Morales'  ] political vision and work closely with the [MISC Cubans  ] and [MISC Venezuelans  ] in a complementary rather than competitive way , unlike [MISC Morales'  ] primary intellectual advisers ( [ORG SEPTEL  ] ) . 
( [ORG Comment: The  ] fact that these advisers work behind the scenes suggests that they are not seeking public recognition , and [PER Morales  ] is more likely to keep them around because of it . 
End comment . 
) -------------------- [PER Ivan Iporre Salguero  ] -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Ivan Iporre  ] is [MISC Morales'  ] personal assistant , and sensitive reporting indicates that he also has been responsible for [MISC Morales'  ] personal finances . 
[PER Iporre  ] controls [MISC Morales'  ] agenda and access to him . 
He was one of three advisers who accompanied [PER Morales  ] on his world tour in January . 
Two Embassy contacts have said that [PER Iporre  ] is the " go-to-guy " for seeking political favors from the [ORG President.  ] ------------------- [PER Hugo Moldiz Mercado  ] ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [PER Hugo Moldiz  ] , a journalist by trade and a well-known [ORG FARC  ] and ELN-B contact , appears to hold an unofficial advisory position in the [ORG Ministry of Government  ] . 
Sensitive reporting indicates that he has been an important operator for [PER Morales  ] with the [MISC Cubans  ] in [LOC Bolivia  ] , particularly coordinating the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] agenda and security and intelligence issues . 
Press reports have also highlighted [PER Moldiz  ] 's role in allegedly organizing local self-defense groups , a pet project [PER Morales  ] takes from his years as a cocalero leader and may now be inspired by [LOC Venezuela  ] 's President [PER Hugo Chavez.  ] -------------------- [PER Hector Arce  ] Zaconeta -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Hector Arce  ] is [MISC Morales'  ] personal attorney , a position he has held for six years . 
[PER Arce  ] appears to be responsible for designing the legal means for [PER Morales  ] to bypass laws the President deems inconvenient or for devising legal arguments for harassing or attacking [MISC Morales'  ] political adversaries , such as the lawsuit against former President 's [PER Eduardo Rodriguez  ] , [PER Carlos Mesa  ] , [PER Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  ] , and [PER Jorge Quiroga.  ] ---------------- Public Operators ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Morales  ] relies on several [MISC Congressmen  ] , particularly [ORG Senate  ] President [PER Santos Ramirez Valverde  ] , [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] President [PER Edmundo Novillo Aguilar  ] , and [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] member [PER Gustavo Torrico Landa  ] , to intimidate opposition [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00000908 002 OF 002 [ORG Congressional  ] leaders . 
[PER Ramirez  ] , [PER Novillo  ] , and [PER Torrico  ] owe their career to [PER Morales  ] and may be abusing power much like their predecessors . 
In particular , [PER Ramirez  ] , a blatant opportunist who one Embassy contact says would sell his mother to get what he wants , has already fallen prey to allegations of graft , according to [MISC PODEMOS Congressmen  ] ( [LOC REF A  ] ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) These advisers operate more as the President 's back alley thugs than as independent legislators . 
For example , [MISC PODEMOS Congressmen  ] have told poloff that their [ORG MAS  ] counterparts have been digging up dirt from the past and blackmailing opposition [MISC Congressmen  ] to back the [ORG MAS  ] or face exposure through the press . 
( [ORG Comment: One  ] Embassy contact has referred to the [MISC Congressmen  ] as part of the " [LOC Cochabamba  ] boys " --a reference to the group of associates that [PER Morales  ] led over the years in the [LOC Chapare  ] that regularly intimidated and harassed cocaleros--although only [PER Novillo  ] technically represents [LOC Cochabamba  ] . 
End comment . 
) Further blurring the line between the executive and legislative branches , the press reported in January that both [PER Ramirez  ] and [PER Novillo  ] moved into the presidential palace at [MISC Morales'  ] request , although [PER Ramirez  ] publicly denies that he lives there .
