Michael McKinley  ] , Ambassador ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Most analysts believe [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] ( [ORG SL  ] ) insurgents are making incremental gains in the [LOC Apurimac-Ene River Valley  ] ( [ORG VRAE  ] ) . 
Local observers in [LOC Ayacucho  ] say frustrations with government at every level have strengthened the anti-system opposition and in some cases generated sympathy for [ORG SL  ] . 
In the most recent incident , [ORG SL  ] elements attacked a provisional military base in the [ORG VRAE  ] on November 5 , killing one soldier and injuring four others . 
According to senior-level [MISC GOP  ] officials , quashing [ORG SL  ] in the [ORG VRAE  ] remains a top government priority , and recent efforts include signing a $9 million contract with an [MISC Israeli  ] defense specialist . 
Several [ORG SL  ] members have expressed interest in participating in elections , but most politicians still see an association with the organization as a kiss of death . 
End summary . 
[ORG SL Expanding Influence  ] in [LOC Ayacucho  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) While there have been fewer casualties in the [ORG VRAE  ] this year so far than last , according to [MISC Peruvian  ] military sources , most analysts believe [ORG SL  ] in the [ORG VRAE  ] and environs is a growing threat . 
For one , the terrorist group has likely gained firepower over the past several years , fueled mostly by weapons stolen from security forces in recent attacks ( refs ) . 
Observers have also told us [ORG SL  ] 's [ORG VRAE  ] faction is particularly dangerous now because of its deceptive tactics . 
Whereas [ORG SL  ] in the 80s was often gruesomely violent with villagers and grassroots organizations , today 's incarnation now actively befriends and financially supports communities , in some cases seeking to supplant a state that has abandoned them . 
Several contacts in [LOC Ayacucho  ] ( where [ORG SL  ] founder [PER Abimael Guzman  ] was a university professor ) recently told us that [PER Jose  ] 's " proseguir " faction in the [ORG VRAE  ] has successfully branded itself as a kinder , gentler group , and is at least tacitly accepted by rural communities and by the very self-defense committees that played a pivotal role in the original [ORG SL  ] 's defeat. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During a recent visit to [LOC Ayacucho  ] , local contacts told us that general discontent and disillusionment with the government , and a particular distaste for the ruling [ORG APRA  ] party , had expanded and deepened popular sympathy for " anti-system " alternatives . 
In some cases , movements that have espoused or used violence such as the " [MISC Etnocaceristas  ] " ( headed by [PER Antauro Humala  ] , who is currently serving a 25 year prison sentence for instigating a 2005 armed uprising in [LOC Andahuaylas  ] ) and [ORG SL  ] itself have benefited from these anti-government sentiments . 
Several contacts told us that when [PER Guzman  ] 's attorney [PER Alfredo Crespo  ] visited [LOC Ayacucho  ] in September to tout [PER Guzman  ] 's recently published book , he was warmly received by local radio stations , print media and university student groups . 
Others told us that pervasive corruption amongst local politicians made some people feel nostalgia for the days when [ORG SL  ] would kill corrupt politicians as a warning to others . 
Several observers said that , with education , health , and employment opportunities sorely lacking , disgruntled locals willingly joined local defense fronts - whose leaders often have ideological ties with [ORG SL  ] - in strikes and protests . 
In addition , jobless youth from the highlands frequently work stints as " burriers " for drug traffickers , who are deeply intertwined with [ORG SL  ] in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
November 5 Attack ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The most recent [ORG VRAE  ] attack occurred on November 5 , when one soldier was killed and four others wounded during a four-hour assault by [ORG Shining Path  ] ( [ORG SL  ] ) terrorists on a provisional military base located where the [MISC Vizcatan  ] and [MISC Mantaro  ] rivers meet . 
[ORG SL  ] forces were repelled after attempting to overrun the base , which was manned by 45 soldiers from the 2nd [ORG Infantry Brigade  ] . 
According to [MISC VRAE Military Region  ] sources , the [ORG SL  ] 's motive was probably to obtain more weapons , and reflected " desperation " because it had been unable to dislodge any of the temporary military bases set up in the [ORG VRAE  ] since [MISC Operation Excellence 777  ] began in August 2008 . 
Other observers maintained that the Government 's recently expanded rewards campaign for capturing [ORG SL  ] leaders " [PER Jose  ] " in the [ORG VRAE  ] and " [MISC Artemio  ] " in the [LOC Upper Huallaga Valley  ] ( UHV ) - the bounty on both their heads was increased from 500K to 1 million soles ( roughly USD 350K ) -- may have also played a part in [ORG SL  ] 's belligerence . 
One prominent analyst , however , suggested that [ORG SL  ] attacks on relatively fortified military bases rather than security patrols or helicopters vulnerable to ambush indicate [ORG SL  ] was increasingly well equipped and regaining strength . 
[ORG VRAE  ] Remains Top Focus ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to senior [MISC GOP  ] officials , quashing [ORG SL  ] in the [ORG VRAE  ] remains a top government priority . 
Defense Minister [PER Rey  ] has emphasized his intention to refocus [LOC Peru  ] 's security efforts on the internal threat . 
Media reports have alluded to the imminent purchase of several combat-capable helicopters ( the armed forces only have about half a dozen operational helicopters , having lost two in the last few months [ refs ] ) , suitable for operations in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
According to government and congressional sources , the MOD is close to obtaining around USD 130 million from the [ORG Ministry of the Economy  ] for [ORG VRAE  ] operations . 
In a recent conversation with the Ambassador , FM [PER Garcia Belaunde  ] said that , notwithstanding tensions with [LOC Chile  ] and an announced [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales , the [ORG VRAE  ] would remain [LOC Peru  ] 's central security focus . 
The [MISC GOP  ] 's efforts have even included signing a reported one year , $9 million contract with former [MISC Israeli  ] Brigadier General [LOC Israel  ] Baruch [PER Ziv  ] , who promised to help [LOC Peru  ] defeat [ORG SL  ] in the [ORG VRAE  ] once and for all . 
According to media sources , Ziv will focus on training for elite special operations forces , strengthening intelligence networks , while [MISC Peruvian  ] joint forces will prioritize the killing or capture of [ORG SL  ] leaders rather than control of territory . 
[ORG SL  ] in Politics --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Current and former [ORG SL  ] members have expressed interest in participating in elections , but most politicians and parties still see any alliance or association with [ORG SL  ] as politically toxic . 
We have heard that [PER Guzman  ] 's attorney has publicly stated that [ORG SL  ] would seek to participate in the 2010 regional and 2011 national elections . 
[PER Guzman  ] 's partner and imprisoned [ORG SL  ] leader , [PER Elena Iparraguirre  ] , publicly reiterated [ORG SL  ] 's interest , and even named [LOC Cajamarca  ] priest , environmental activist and probable presidential aspirant [PER Marco Arana  ] as a possible political ally . 
( [PER Arana  ] quickly distanced himself publicly from [PER Iparraguirre  ] and [ORG SL  ] . 
) Similarly , a controversy broke out after [PER Elsa Malpartida  ] , [ORG Andean Community  ] parliamentarian representing [PER Humala  ] 's [ORG Nationalist Party  ] ( [ORG PNP  ] ) , was reported to have belonged to [ORG SL  ] in the 1980s . 
[PER Malpartida  ] publicly argued that , like others in [LOC Peru  ] 's rural areas , she had been forced to cooperate with [ORG SL  ] and had formally severed her ties long ago . 
Government officials , including Justice Minister [PER Aurelio Pastor  ] , have publicly stated that [ORG SL  ] would be prohibited from participating in the political process because it remained a terrorist organization that consciously used violence for political ends . 
Comment: The [LOC Chile  ] Distraction --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) One problem with the continuing spy controversy that has roiled relations between [LOC Peru  ] and [LOC Chile  ] ( refs ) is that political calculations might compel the [MISC GOP  ] to turn its attention ( and resources ) away from the country 's real and immediate internal threat: the potentially reemerging [ORG SL  ] terrorist threat and unchecked drug trafficking interests , particularly in the [ORG VRAE  ] . 
So far , our [MISC Peruvian  ] counterparts have assured us this will not happen .
