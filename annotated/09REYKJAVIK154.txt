End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG TSA  ] Officials [PER Lynes  ] and [PER Melendez  ] met with [PER Petur Maack  ] , Director of the [ORG Icelandic Civil Aviation Administration  ] ( [ORG CAA  ] ) , and representatives of [ORG Icelandair  ] on August 19 to discuss a way forward after the [ORG TSA  ] inspection on August 4-6 of airline and airport security procedures at [LOC Keflavik Airport  ] . 
[ORG Icelandair  ] has been proactive in addressing many of the deficiencies identified during the inspection . 
It reported that about 60 percent of the issues had already been addressed and those remaining were in progress . 
Several outstanding issues , however , are not easy fixes . 
Some requirements , such as implementing open , continuous screening , will requie additional funds , which could be difficult to allocate as the government is calling for a 10% budget cut in most sectors . 
In other cases , such as examining footwear of select passengers , the [ORG CAA  ] must draft legal provisions and issue directives . 
Despite the challenges , [MISC Icelandic  ] officials stated their commitment to work with [ORG TSA  ] make the necessary changes . 
[ORG TSA  ] expressed a desire to return to [LOC Iceland  ] at a later date to assess the airport again and verify that the requisite changes have been made . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] officials are amenable to the request. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG TSA  ] made significant progress in increasing its lines of communication with [MISC Icelandic  ] aviation officials . 
An [ORG MOU  ] was signed to facilitate the sharing of [ORG SSI  ] . 
[ORG CAA  ] Director [PER Maack  ] was receptive to implementing a bilateral information sharing agreement between [ORG TSA  ] and the [ORG CAA  ] so that separate MOUs for each issue , such as threat guidance , would be unnecessary . 
Also , [PER Maack  ] was very receptive to the invitation to view [ORG TSA  ] operations at a [LOC U.S.  ] point of entry and meet with key [ORG TSA  ] personnel . 
Funding permitting , he would like to conduct the visit at some point this winter .
