End Summary . 
" [MISC Rogue  ] " Priests ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG FPU  ] has confirmed 31 cases where children have been illegally adopted in [LOC Egypt  ] and either taken to the [LOC United States  ] or raised in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
The earliest confirmed case by the [ORG FPU  ] is from 1989 , although one [MISC Coptic  ] priest admitted the practice has been going on since 1976 . 
This particular priest also provided other insights during an interview with the [ORG Fraud Prevention Manager  ] ( [ORG FPM  ] ) on February 11 , 2010 . 
He stated that the majority of the priests involved in illegal adoptions are very charismatic , have numerous followers and are consumed with their position of power as leaders of the [MISC Coptic  ] community . 
According to this priest , the " big " personalities of these individuals have prompted them to engage in activities not condoned by many others in the [MISC Coptic  ] Church . 
He mentioned that the Church is more than capable of raising and educating unwanted [MISC Coptic  ] children . 
He added that in [LOC Alexandria  ] , literally hundreds of babies are given to childless families and only a few have been taken out of [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Unscrupulous Doctors -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The cases of illegal adoptions generally involve doctors falsely attesting to the delivery of the newborn for the alleged biological parents . 
The letter from the doctor is used to acquire a genuine [MISC Egyptian  ] birth certificate and sometimes a passport . 
The [ORG FPU  ] confirmed that in many instances the doctors receive payment in return for their false statements and/or procurement of newborns . 
The [ORG FPU  ] linked one doctor to cases as far back as 1995 and as recent as 2008 . 
The doctor 's fees ranged from [ORG USD  ] 100 for a newborn to [ORG USD  ] 5000 for personal delivery of a newborn to the [LOC United States  ] ( see 09 [LOC Cairo  ] 207 and previous ) . 
[ORG FPU  ] cooperation with [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG State Security Investigative Services  ] ( [ORG SSIS  ] ) led to the arrest of this doctor in May 2009 . 
[MISC Americans  ] to [MISC Stand Trial Again  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 16 , [MISC Egyptian  ] prosecutors charged two [MISC Americans  ] and six [MISC Egyptians  ] with forgery , illegal adoption and baby trafficking . 
Another [MISC American  ] in the [LOC United States  ] was also identified and charged in absentia . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's Prosecutor General identified the [MISC Egyptians  ] as two priests , two doctors , a civil servant and an engineer . 
All , but two of these individuals are currently fugitives . 
In September of 2009 , an [MISC Egyptian  ] court sentenced four [MISC Americans  ] and seven [MISC Egyptians  ] to two to five years in prison for baby trafficking and forgery . 
Comment ------- [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000344 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most of the illegal adoptions confirmed by the [ORG FPU  ] have involved childless couples desperate for children . 
However , in some cases the [ORG FPU  ] is unable to trace the whereabouts of the child . 
Confirmed cases of unscrupulous doctors raises concern for the newborns involved in such illegal adoptions . 
Post is proposing stronger language for the [ORG Country Specific Information  ] for [LOC Egypt  ] warning against attempting to illegally adopt in [LOC Egypt  ] .
