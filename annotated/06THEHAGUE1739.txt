( C ) Summary: Defense Minister [PER Henk Kamp  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] is committed to the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program , and hopes to sign the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] prior to the parliamentary elections on November 22 . 
He said the [ORG GONL  ] remains interested in the [ORG NATO  ] C-17 consortium , and is actively reviewing funding options . 
[PER Kamp  ] reiterated that [MISC Dutch  ] forces were currently spread too thin to make a significant operational contribution to an [ORG International Force  ] ( IF ) in [LOC Lebanon  ] , but did not rule out the possibility of a naval contribution at some point provided there was a " " serious " " need . 
The [ORG GONL  ] continues to appreciate [ORG USG  ] support to the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG ISAF III  ] deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
With the exception of a few difficulties -- now resolved -- [PER Kamp  ] claimed that the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment is " " on track .

End summary . 
[ORG JSF: Committed  ] -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Kamp  ] said that the [ORG GONL  ] remains seriously committed to [ORG JSF  ] -- not only is the program the best available , but it is also important for the [MISC U.S-Dutch  ] relationship . 
He said the [ORG GONL  ] intends to sign the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] , and would make a decision regarding the timing of the signature in the near future . 
He hoped to sign the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] prior to the parliamentary elections on November 22 . 
However , [PER Kamp  ] was not concerned if signature slipped until after the elections . 
He explained that the main opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) was in government during the program 's initiation , and had supported [ORG JSF  ] . 
If Labor was a part of the next government coalition -- as current polls suggest -- [PER Kamp  ] believed chances were good they would support continuing the program , despite current political posturing to the contrary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a separate conversation , MOD State Secretary [PER Cees van der Knaap  ] told Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] August 9 that the [ORG GONL  ] still intends to sign the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] prior to the parliamentary elections . 
Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] informed van der [PER Knaap  ] of our intentions to meet with [ORG Dutch Parliamentary Defense Committee  ] members prior to their trip to [LOC Washington  ] and Ft . 
Worth to discuss [ORG JSF  ] . 
Van der [PER Knaap  ] welcomed such discussion , but requested that the [ORG USG  ] think and act " " carefully " " given the political sensitivities . 
C-17 Consortium: Continued Interest ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kamp  ] confirmed that the [MISC Dutch  ] remain very interested in participating in the [ORG NATO  ] C-17 consortium . 
He explained that the financial aspects of [MISC Dutch  ] participation have not yet been resolved , as the [ORG GONL  ] is trying to determine whether the program should be funded by the [ORG MFA  ] -- as a strategic airlift initiative -- or MOD -- as a defense acquisition . 
He added that the [ORG MFA  ] and MOD are actively discussing the matter with the intention of requesting additional funding from [MISC Dutch  ] Finance Minister [PER Zalm  ] in the coming weeks in order to participate in the consortium . 
Lebanon: [MISC Dutch  ] Stretched Thin ; " " Serious " " [MISC Naval Ops Possible  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] noted the [ORG GONL  ] 's position -- stated publicly by [PER Kamp  ] and Foreign Minister Bot -- that the [MISC Dutch  ] were " " stretched too thin " " to be able to contribute to the [ORG International Force  ] ( IF ) in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Kamp  ] confirmed that was the case , noting that the [ORG GONL  ] would like to get involved and that he personally was a strong advocate of [LOC Israel  ] . 
However , he explained that the [MISC Dutch  ] want to " " do current missions one hundred percent " " -- contributing to the IF would detract from this goal. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] asked if the [MISC Dutch  ] in the future might consider a naval contribution to the IF . 
[PER Kamp  ] replied that the [MISC Dutch  ] might be interested , as the [MISC Dutch  ] navy is " " very capable . 
" " But the mission would need to be a " " serious task " " to warrant consideration , he added . 
He mentioned [MISC Dutch  ] support to [ORG UNMIL  ] off the coast of [LOC Liberia  ] in late 2003 , in which [MISC Dutch  ] personnel were not seriously engaged for three months -- this was " " not good for [MISC Dutch  ] personnel , " " [PER Kamp  ] said . 
[ORG Afghanistan: On Track  ] --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] expressed his condolences to [PER Kamp  ] for the recent loss of two [MISC Dutch  ] soldiers in a helicopter crash in eastern [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and noted continued [ORG USG  ] appreciation for the [MISC Dutch  ] commitment to the [ORG ISAF III  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
He commended [PER Kamp  ] on the [MISC Dutch  ] MOD 's public relations campaign to promote the mission and build public support. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Kamp  ] thanked the [ORG USG  ] for its support in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , especially regarding the use of [LOC U.S.  ] medevac and Apache helicopters , and C-17 airlift support . 
He praised previous and continued efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , and noted that he was making efforts to explain to the [MISC Dutch  ] public that the [ORG USG  ] " " did a lot of good " " in [LOC Uruzgan  ] -- the [ORG GONL  ] hopes to build upon the solid foundation initiated by the [ORG USG  ] . 
He also appreciated the continued [LOC U.S.  ] presence in the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] , which is helping bolster coordination among [ORG NATO  ] allies . 
That said , [PER Kamp  ] noted there were a few " " difficulties " " ( reftel ) in the transition from the [MISC US-  ] to [MISC Dutch-led  ] [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] , especially regarding communication on what the [ORG USG  ] intended to take and leave behind in the [ORG PRT  ] . 
[PER Kamp  ] said these " " difficulties " " were now resolved .
