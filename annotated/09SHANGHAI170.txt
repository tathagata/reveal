REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) , ( e ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Shanghai  ] scholars said [LOC China  ] 's interest in [LOC Latin America  ] remains primarily economic - securing natural resources and diversifying export markets amid the global economic downturn . 
[LOC China  ] recognizes that it is facing an image problem in [LOC Latin America  ] and is taking steps to address negative perceptions , said the scholars . 
[LOC China  ] 's strategy in [LOC Latin America  ] is clear: it wants to " control the supply of commodities , " said the [MISC Brazilian  ] Consul General in [LOC Shanghai  ] . 
[MISC Chinese  ] investors , encouraged by the [MISC Chinese  ] Government , are rushing to invest in [LOC Brazil  ] 's natural resources . 
The [MISC Argentinean  ] Consul General in [LOC Shanghai  ] , however , expressed frustration at the slow pace of [MISC Chinese  ] investment in his country . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] and [MISC Argentinean  ] firms in [LOC East China  ] are increasingly focused on manufacturing for the [MISC Chinese  ] domestic market . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Poloff held separate discussions in March with leading [LOC Shanghai  ] scholars on China-Latin [LOC America  ] relations and the [ORG Consuls General of Brazil and Argentina  ] in [LOC Shanghai  ] . 
The discussions focused on overall political relations and growth in bilateral trade and investment , including investment to and from [LOC East China  ] . 
Need to [ORG Diversify Trade Partners  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] 's primary interest in [LOC Latin America  ] remains oil and natural resources , said [LOC Shanghai  ] scholars , but the global economic crisis is also forcing [LOC China  ] to diversify its export markets . 
With exports to developed countries plummeting , [LOC China  ] is looking to [LOC Latin America  ] , which [LOC China  ] thinks is still in relatively good shape , to pick up some of the slack , said [PER Niu Haibin  ] , Deputy Director of the [ORG Center for Latin American Studies  ] at the [ORG Shanghai Institutes for International Studies  ] ( [ORG SIIS  ] ) . 
[PER Wu Chunsi  ] , Deputy Director of the [ORG Department of American Studies  ] at [ORG SIIS  ] , said [LOC China  ] sees the need to " pay more attention " to large emerging countries like [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] amid the changing global economic balance of power . 
For their part , [LOC Latin American  ] countries view growing relations with [LOC China  ] as a " gateway " to greater economic cooperation with other countries in [LOC East Asia  ] , said [ORG Wu.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) These [ORG Shanghai  ] scholars believe overall relations between [LOC China  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] are good but also recognize areas where interests do not overlap . 
For example , though [LOC China  ] already has [PER FTAs  ] with [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Peru  ] and began negotiating an FTA with [LOC Costa Rica  ] in January 2009 , [PER Zhang Jiazhe  ] , Vice Director of the [ORG Center for Developing Countries Studies  ] at the [ORG Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences  ] ( [ORG SASS  ] ) , believes other [PER FTAs  ] , especially with bigger countries in the region , are " unlikely " in the near future because many [MISC Chinese  ] exports compete directly with exports from [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Niu pointed to the " similar industrial structure " and overlapping exports of [LOC China  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] , adding that [LOC China  ] should invest more in the [MISC Mexican  ] oil industry to counter [MISC Mexican  ] concerns about [LOC China  ] 's growing trade surplus with the country . 
[PER Wu Chunsi  ] said [LOC China  ] is " realistic " that it can cooperate with the region on many things like climate change and energy but that they " do not have to agree on [LOC SHANGHAI  ] 00000170 002 OF 005 everything , " for example , the issue of expanding the number of permanent seats on the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] , a subject in which [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC China  ] do not see eye to eye . 
[LOC China  ] Facing Image Problem --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The bigger problem for [LOC China  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] right now , said the scholars , is its image among the local population . 
[PER Zhang  ] said competition from [MISC Chinese  ] imports , like textiles and shoes , is creating negative feelings towards [LOC China  ] among countries with large low-end manufacturing industries , mentioning [LOC Mexico  ] as an example . 
There is also a perception in [LOC Latin America  ] that [MISC Chinese  ] investors are like " locusts , " extracting minerals and natural resources and leaving very little of lasting value behind , said the scholars . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies , on the other hand , find it difficult to invest in [LOC Latin America  ] , according to [PER Niu  ] . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies complain about strong labor unions and cultural conflicts in [LOC Latin America  ] , including a " different work ethic " between [MISC Latin American  ] workers and [MISC Chinese  ] workers , said [PER Niu  ] . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies thus prefer to import workers from [LOC China  ] for projects in [LOC Latin America  ] , often at the cost of local resentment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Chinese  ] Government recognizes it faces a public relations challenge in [LOC Latin America  ] , said the scholars . 
[MISC Chinese  ] companies in [LOC Latin America  ] , for example , are being encouraged by the [MISC Chinese  ] Government to hire more local employees , according to [PER Wu  ] . 
[PER Zhang  ] noted that [LOC China  ] became a donor member of the [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] ( [ORG IADB  ] ) in January 2009 and donated [MISC USD  ] 350 million , which is " money that many [MISC Latin American  ] countries need . 
" He thinks [LOC China  ] 's outreach to the [ORG IADB  ] , along with consecutive high level visits to the region by [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu Jintao  ] in November 2008 and Vice President [PER Xi Jinping  ] and Vice Premier [PER Hui Liangyu  ] in February 2009 , highlight [LOC China  ] 's efforts to improve overall relations , including its image , in [LOC Latin America  ] .

The [MISC Brazilian  ] View: [ORG China Focused  ] on [ORG Securing Resources  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Marcos Caramuru de Paiva  ] , Consul General of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Consulate in [LOC Shanghai  ] , thinks the primary purpose of recent high-level visits by [MISC Chinese  ] leaders was to " clear the road " for more [MISC Chinese  ] investment in the region . 
For example , Vice President [PER Xi  ] visited [LOC Brazil  ] to sign an agreement with [ORG Petrobras  ] , in which [LOC China  ] agreed to lend [ORG USD  ] 10 billion for deep-sea exploration and extraction in return for [MISC Brazilian  ] oil . 
" [LOC China  ] 's strategy is very clear: it is doing everything possible to control the supply of commodities , " said [PER de Paiva  ] . 
Although [LOC Brazil  ] exports some high-tech products , such as small commercial aircraft , to [LOC China  ] , he sees a growing " imbalance " in bilateral trade , with [LOC China  ] shipping higher value-added machinery to [LOC Brazil  ] in exchange for [MISC Brazilian  ] commodities . 
[PER De Paiva  ] does not think this situation will change anytime soon , stating " it is difficult to compete with [MISC Chinese  ] manufacturers . 
" However , he does not think this is necessarily a bad thing , as current bilateral trade creates a " win-win " situation with both countries capitalizing on their areas of comparative advantage . 
Easier for [LOC China  ] to Invest in [LOC Africa  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Chinese  ] Government is telling [MISC Chinese  ] firms to invest in [LOC Brazil  ] 's mining and agriculture sectors , even providing 70 percent of the initial financing in some cases , said [PER de Paiva  ] . 
He sees several problems with this . 
First , [LOC SHANGHAI  ] 00000170 003 OF 005 there is already significant investment by [MISC Brazilian  ] firms in the country 's well-developed mining and agriculture sectors , leaving less opportunity for [MISC Chinese  ] investment . 
Second , the global economic crisis and consequent drop in the price of commodities has altered the calculation of investors . 
He mentioned the case of [ORG Baosteel  ] , [LOC China  ] 's largest steel maker ( headquartered in [LOC Shanghai  ] ) , which was planning to invest with the [MISC Brazilian  ] mining giant Vale to produce 10 million tons of steel in [LOC Brazil  ] each year . 
( Note: For more on [ORG Baosteel  ] , see Ref <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
End note . 
) The deal fell through when demand for steel products plummeted amid the crisis. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Another problem is that , according to [PER de Paiva  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] investors " do not understand , " nor do they try to understand , the local [MISC Brazilian  ] market and regulations . 
[MISC Chinese  ] firms " should first hire consultants " to navigate them through [LOC Brazil  ] 's tax codes , regulations , and bureaucracy , he said . 
Instead , spurred by easy access to government financing , they immediately jump into investments in sectors with which they have no experience . 
For example , [PER de Paiva  ] mentioned a furniture company in [LOC East China  ] that recently went to [LOC Brazil  ] to set up an agricultural company exporting soybeans . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] investor did not understand the intricacies of the business - the importance of location , intermediaries , traders , transportation , and well-established competition - since he had never been in the agriculture business before , and so the venture failed . 
[MISC Chinese  ] investors think [LOC Latin America  ] and [LOC Africa  ] are the same , said [PER de Paiva  ] , but it is easier for them to do business in [LOC Africa  ] since [LOC Africa  ] 's institutions and regulatory environment are less well-developed than [LOC Latin America  ] 's . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] Presence in [LOC East China  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) According to [PER de Paiva  ] , there are approximately 1000-2000 [MISC Brazilian  ] nationals in [LOC East China  ] . 
Most are working in multinational or [MISC Brazilian  ] firms , but there is also a small number in the entertainment industry ( e.g. , dancers ) . 
He also noted a large number of ethnic [MISC Chinese  ] children born in [LOC Brazil  ] , holding [MISC Brazilian  ] passports , and currently living in [LOC East China  ] . 
[PER De Paiva  ] said there was an initial wave of [MISC Brazilian  ] investors setting up machinery , shoe , and textile factories in [LOC East  ] and [LOC South China  ] about 10 years ago , and although new [MISC Brazilian  ] investors are still coming to [LOC China  ] , the number of firms has remained relatively stable . 
There are currently two [MISC Brazilian  ] banks in [LOC Shanghai  ] - [ORG Banco do Brasil  ] and [ORG Banco Itau  ] - facilitating bilateral trade and investment , according to [PER de Paiva  ] . 
Although he has not heard of major regulatory problems facing [MISC Brazilian  ] firms in [LOC Shanghai  ] , he has seen cases of IPR infringement , including a [MISC Brazilian  ] shoe manufacturer which recently opened shops in [LOC China  ] , only to realize that a [MISC Chinese  ] firm had already registered the company 's trademark locally . 
More and more [MISC Brazilian  ] firms , such as this shoe maker , are coming to [LOC China  ] to sell their products to [MISC Chinese  ] consumers , said [PER de Paiva  ] . 
" The days of manufacturing cheaply in [LOC China  ] are over , " as [MISC Brazilian  ] firms focus more on tapping [LOC China  ] 's domestic market , he added . 
The [MISC Argentinean  ] View: [MISC Chinese  ] Investors Taking Their Time --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Eduardo R. Ablin  ] , Consul General of the Consulate-General of [LOC Argentina  ] in [LOC Shanghai  ] , said [LOC Argentina  ] exports [ORG USD  ] 9 billion , or 10 percent of its total exports , to [LOC China  ] . 
Three-quarters of its exports are soy , vegetable oils , and animal feed . 
The remaining one-quarter includes poultry [LOC SHANGHAI  ] 00000170 004 OF 005 ( [PER Ablin  ] thanked [ORG KFC  ] for getting the [MISC Chinese  ] hooked on chicken wings ) , wine , and non-agricultural products . 
Imports from [LOC China  ] are primarily heavy industrial equipment and textiles . 
[PER Ablin  ] estimated there are 100,000 [MISC Chinese  ] nationals and second generation ethnic [MISC Chinese  ] in [LOC Argentina  ] , with many of them working in local retail shops and restaurants . 
However , " real investment " from [LOC China  ] only started five years ago and is only growing at a " modest pace , " he said . 
[PER Ablin  ] knows of only one large [MISC Chinese  ] investment project in [LOC Argentina  ] , involving a subsidiary of [ORG Baosteel  ] which had taken over a previously state-owned iron ore mine . 
Other [MISC Chinese  ] investments in [LOC Argentina  ] are in relatively new sectors , such as a [MISC Chinese  ] motorcycle factory in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] have looked at other projects , such as copper mining and the revamping of [LOC Argentina  ] 's ageing subway system , but so far , there has been " more talk than action , " said [PER Ablin  ] . 
He thinks [LOC China  ] sees [LOC Argentina  ] as a " sustainable , long-term supplier " of natural resources , but has been slow to turn ideas into concrete investment . 
[MISC Argentinean  ] Presence in [LOC East China  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) According to [PER Ablin  ] , there are only 300 [MISC Argentinean  ] nationals in [LOC East China  ] , more than half of them working in [MISC Argentinean  ] and multinational companies , while one-third are ethnic [MISC Chinese  ] children born in [LOC Argentina  ] but currently living in [LOC East China  ] with dual passports . 
He said there are only six large [MISC Argentinean  ] investors in [LOC East China  ] , all of whom have formed joint ventures ( [ORG JV  ] ) with local [MISC Chinese  ] companies . 
He mentioned , for example , a [ORG JV  ] in [LOC Anhui Province  ] producing agricultural pesticides , and another [ORG JV  ] engaged in pharmacology and antibiotics . 
[PER Ablin  ] said [LOC Ningbo  ] , a large port city in [LOC Zhejiang Province  ] , is becoming an increasingly important center for [LOC Argentina  ] 's soybean and other agricultural imports into [LOC China  ] . 
[PER Ablin  ] has not heard complaints from [MISC Argentinean  ] firms about regulatory and legal difficulties in [LOC East China  ] . 
[PER Ablin  ] said [MISC Argentinean  ] firms in [LOC East China  ] , like [MISC Brazilian  ] firms , are increasingly focused on manufacturing for the [MISC Chinese  ] domestic market . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER De Paiva  ] lamented how the [MISC Brazilian  ] Consulate in [LOC Shanghai  ] has only two officers ( including himself ) and has not been able to keep up with the rapid growth in bilateral trade and investment , particularly given [LOC Shanghai  ] 's significance as a trade and financial hub . 
" We are behind the curve , " he said . 
[PER Ablin  ] of the [LOC Argentina  ] Consulate said they currently have three officers in [LOC Shanghai  ] and are hoping to add a fourth in the second half of 2009 . 
He also mentioned plans to open a small Consulate in [LOC Guangzhou  ] in the near future. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Despite burgeoning trade between [LOC China  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] in recent years , there has been a dearth of interest in the subject among academics and university students in [LOC Shanghai  ] . 
[PER Zhang Jiazhe  ] of [ORG SASS  ] said it is difficult to get university and government funding for research on [LOC Latin America  ] as opposed to research on the [LOC United States  ] or [LOC Japan  ] , for example . 
However , the situation may be gradually changing , as [ORG SASS  ] has recently started discussions with universities in [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , and [LOC Mexico  ] to set up educational exchanges . 
According to [PER Zhang  ] , the [ORG Shanghai Municipal Government  ] is also backing plans to set up [ORG Confucian Institutes  ] ( [MISC Chinese  ] language and cultural training centers ) in collaboration with [ORG Shanghai 's Fudan University  ] and [ORG SHANGHAI 00000170  ] 005 OF 005 the [ORG Shanghai Foreign Language Institute  ] in [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Even with these efforts , however , academic interest among [LOC Shanghai  ] scholars on [LOC Latin America  ] is lagging and has not been commensurate with the growth in bilateral trade and investment .
