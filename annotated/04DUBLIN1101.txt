( C ) Summary: [LOC U.S.  ] Special Envoy for [LOC Northern Ireland  ] [PER Mitchell Reiss  ] met on June 30 in [LOC Dublin  ] with [MISC Irish  ] Prime Minister [PER Ahern  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Brian Cowen  ] to review Irish/British efforts to lay the ground work for another effort at restoring devolved government in [ORG NI  ] . 
[PER Ahern  ] confirmed that he and [MISC British  ] PM [PER Blair  ] are prepared to host one last round of “hot house” negotiations with [PER Sinn Fein  ] ( [ORG SF  ] ) and the [ORG Democratic Unionist Party  ] ( [ORG DUP  ] ) in the middle of September at a remote site in [LOC Scotland  ] on an agreement to restore devolved government in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] ( [ORG NI  ] ) . 
If those talks fail , [PER Ahern  ] indicated that a “plan B” ( along the lines suggested by the [ORG Social Democratic Labour Party  ] ( [ORG SDLP  ] ) ) for standing up [ORG NI  ] institutions with a caretaker technocratic government might be worth considering . 
Subsequently , however , key [MISC Irish  ] officials told the Ambassador and DCM that the [ORG GOI  ] does not wish to float any notions of a “plan B” in advance of September meetings . 
[PER Ahern  ] and [PER Cowen  ] both expressed concern that the traditional July-August summer holiday season may keep [ORG SF  ] and [ORG DUP  ] from adequately preparing for intensive negotiations in early September . 
[PER Cowen  ] will have staff here in August working on plans . 
End Summary MEETING WITH PM AHERN: THERE ARE DANGERS WITH A PLAN B BUT SDLP PROPOSAL MAY HAVE SOME MERIT --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Attending with PM [PER Ahern  ] were [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Accompanying Special Envoy [PER Reiss  ] were Ambassador [PER Kenny  ] , S/P Green , and [ORG Emboff  ] . 
[PER Ahern  ] said that there must be a concerted effort in September to get a [MISC SF-DUP  ] deal ; “we can’t keep going the way we have been.” He agreed with [LOC Reiss’  ] observation that the key ingredients for an agreement are convincing the parties that September is a make-or-break situation , helping [ORG SF  ] leader [PER Gerry Adams  ] do a deal , and getting [ORG DUP  ] commitments on implementation ( of the deal ) . 
Also , there must be a credible “plan B” in reserve . 
[PER Ahern  ] noted that [ORG SF  ] now has the political power and position to move forward , “but I don’t know if they will.” [PER Ahern  ] said that he was impressed with the [ORG DUP  ] , but its proposed six-month hiatus ( between a deal and implementation ) is a non-starter because republicans will not accept that long gap ; and it brings events too close to [LOC UK  ] elections and [ORG Blair’s  ] upcoming ( 1/1/05 ) responsibilities as G-8 Chairman and [ORG EU President.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Reiss  ] agreed that [ORG DUP  ] was showing an encouraging willingness to engage , adding that the parties can always negotiate an agreement in principle and a shorter timeframe for implementation , such as three months . 
The key is implementation because it is unrealistic to expect [ORG SF  ] to “pay up front” with no guarantee of a deal . 
[PER Ahern  ] said the elements of a deal are clear , but it is important to keep all of the other parties involved as well . 
The last elections virtually eliminated the [ORG PUP  ] and the [ORG Women’s Coalition  ] ; the [ORG Alliance Party  ] is significantly weakened ; and [ORG SDLP  ] and the [ORG UUP  ] could lose all their [LOC Westminster  ] seats in the next general election ( to [ORG SF  ] and [ORG DUP  ] ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] said [ORG SF  ] and the [ORG DUP  ] cannot be allowed to hold up the entire devolution process indefinitely . 
He noted that [PER Blair  ] , s October 2002 &Acts of Completion8 speech in [LOC Belfast  ] failed spectacularly to bolster moderate unionism and the [ORG DUP  ] continues to gain at [LOC UUP’s  ] expense . 
The question is how to pressure the [ORG DUP  ] to deal ? 
[PER Ahern  ] said two points were certain: [ORG SF  ] can’t be excluded from a deal , and it must be done within the parameters of the [MISC Good Friday Agreement  ] ( [ORG GFA  ] ) . 
Without it , nationalist voters will walk away , and the [ORG NI  ] public generally will grow more skeptical of devolution . 
For this reason , of the plan B proposals being circulated , the [ORG SDLP  ] , s proposal or some variation &is not a bad one.8 ( Note: [ORG SDLP  ] recently proposed that the two governments ( [LOC London  ] and [LOC Dublin  ] ) nominate 10 administrators for the 10 government departments in order to get some form of devolved government up and running . 
End note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Reiss  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] agreed there are merits to the [ORG SDLP  ] , s proposal . 
Moreover , the threat of a viable plan B might be a useful inducement to get the parties to deal in September . 
[PER Reiss  ] asked what [LOC Dublin  ] and [LOC London  ] were doing to prepare the ground for September and offered to send [PER Ahern  ] some thoughts on this soon . 
[PER Ahern  ] said there were better prospects for success in September if the parties were working off one text that ring-fenced areas of agreement and bracketed the major remaining unresolved issues: fulfilling commitments under the [ORG Joint Declaration  ] , the [MISC Finucane  ] inquiry , On The Runs ( OTRs ) , and release of the murderers of [LOC Garda  ] [PER Gerry McCabe  ] . 
[PER Reiss  ] asked whether the [MISC Finucane  ] case was a potential deal breaker . 
[PER Ahern  ] said it is not a republican , but a nationalist , issue . 
Because there is such broad-based support across the nationalist community in the [LOC North  ] for an inquiry , [ORG SF  ] will insist on it . 
[PER Ahern  ] added that the results of a [MISC Finucane  ] inquiry report tomorrow would not surprise anyone and “Tony ( [PER Blair  ] ) knows what he has to do.” ( Comment: Presumably , that the PM will have to overrule elements of the security-legal establishments to see that some form of public inquiry is held . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Taioseach advisor [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [ORG SF  ] knows there can be no deal without decommissioning - “everyone knows what needs to be done.” [PER Ahern  ] added that another secret decommissioning act will not work ; [ORG SF  ] must understand that without transparency it will get no credit from [ORG DUP  ] leader [ORG Paisley  ] . 
[PER Ahern  ] noted that a clergyman in contact with [PER Adams  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX might act as a witness . 
His participation might be seen by unionists as lending credibility . 
[PER Ahern  ] said that the way to get [ORG SF  ] on the policing boards is a deal that devolves policing/justice relatively quickly in exchange for an end to paramilitary activity and complete decommissioning . 
But , he added , [ORG DUP  ] does not yet understand this . 
[PER Reiss  ] said that he would reinforce this when he met with [ORG DUP  ] leaders on July 28 . 
MEETING WITH FM COWEN: [ORG GOI  ] READY FOR FULL COURT PRESS IN SEPTEMBER ------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Reiss  ] subsequently met with [MISC Irish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Brian Cowen  ] , who was accompanied by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER Cowen  ] said that , even though [ORG DUP  ] leader [ORG Paisley  ] wants to do a deal , the main worry going into the September talks is that the parties will delay an agreement to get a better deal: “this is why we discuss plan Bs.” [PER Cowen  ] added that , nonetheless , the [ORG GOI  ] is going into September “with all guns blazing.” [PER Reiss  ] asked what will the market bear in terms of pain to the parties . 
That is , he suggested that the parties discuss a plan B publicly and privately to pressure both the [ORG DUP  ] and [ORG SF  ] . 
[PER Reiss  ] added that [MISC SF-DUP  ] dialogue over the next two months approaching September is critical and asked whether a &stick and carrot8 approach to [PER Sinn Fein  ] ( [ORG SF  ] ) might be adopted and result in forward motion . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cautioned that it is difficult to find a stick that won’t alienate [ORG SF  ] and destabilize/set back the entire process . 
[PER Cowen  ] reiterated PM Ahern’s endorsement that talks in September focus around a bracketed text. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Cowen  ] said that the key factor at present is the [ORG DUP  ] willingness to pre-cook a deal . 
This should allow [ORG SF  ] to seriously engage , get an agreement , and then proceed with sequencing . 
In terms of offering a carrot , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested that the [ORG DUP  ] needs to feel &flattered.8 He noted that party members are visiting the [ORG Kennedy School of Government  ] in [ORG Harvard  ] during the month of July , and it may be opportune to invite them to [LOC Washington  ] for consultations and to drive home the message that the opportunity for a deal is there . 
[PER Cowen  ] said that the [ORG DUP  ] must understand that changes on [ORG Strand One  ] of the [ORG GFA  ] would need to be offset by changes to [ORG Strand Two  ] . 
He added that the issue of First Minister and Deputy First Minister must be resolved sooner rather than later . 
On decommissioning , [PER Cowen  ] suggested that one way to get transparency without breaching confidentiality would be to publish retrospectively the index listing a full inventory of guns and explosives following total decommissioning. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Reiss  ] asked how firm was the DUP’s demand for a six-month &decontamination8 period prior to [ORG SF  ] taking seats at the Executive table . 
[PER Cowen  ] replied that 6 months is a negotiating position , and “in fairness” [ORG DUP  ] is ready to do a “big bang” deal now . 
[PER Cowen  ] noted that the devolution of justice is a critical issue for [ORG SF  ] , and [MISC Finucane  ] is a potential deal breaker -- it is a &hot button topic8 that is not going to go away .
