( C ) SUMMARY . 
Avowing a " readiness to move forward in our relationship , " the Government of [LOC Cuba  ] granted us unprecedented access to its state institutions during the visit of Deputy Assistant Secretary of State [PER Bisa Williams  ] from September 16 to 22 . 
To underscore the move , the [ORG GOC  ] also offered the [MISC Mission  ] quarterly consular access to jailed [MISC Cuban-Americans  ] that we identified , and extended full diplomatic protections and multiple-entry visas to USINT 's [ORG Marine Security Guards  ] and temporary duty personnel . 
The country 's leading opposition figures told [PER DAS Williams  ] that they were heartened by the increased lines of government-to-government communications and encouraged the [LOC United States  ] to continue prying open these links . 
The key to normalizing relations , [PER DAS Williams  ] told the [MISC Cubans  ] , was not to be found solely in the degree of bilateral engagement between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , but in the [MISC Cuban  ] Government , s efforts to engage its own people and to respond to their wishes . 
The visit included [PER DAS Williams  ] , participation in the [LOC United States  ] - [LOC Cuba  ] Direct Mail Talks held in [LOC Havana  ] on September 18 ( Septel ) , and took place during the much talked-about " Peace Without Borders " musical concert held on September 20 . 
END SUMMARY . 
AN UNPRECEDENTED WEEK -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Bisa Williams  ] led the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation to the Direct Mail Talks with [LOC Cuba  ] on September 18 . 
In the following four days , [PER DAS Williams  ] met with officials from the Foreign Relations , [ORG Justice  ] , [ORG Agriculture  ] , Health and Interior ministries , the [ORG Prosecutors' Office  ] , the [ORG University of Havana  ] , and local officials in the [ORG Province of Pinar del Rio  ] . 
[PER DAS Williams  ] also held roundtables with the leading figures from [LOC Cuba  ] 's dissident and blogger communities , and with resident [ORG EU  ] ambassadors . 
In addition , she was allowed to travel twice outside the [ORG Havana Province  ] perimeter , to visit the [ORG Latin American School of Medicine  ] and the areas hardest hit by hurricanes in 2008 in the westernmost province of [LOC Pinar  ] del [LOC Rio  ] . 
" CONFIDENCE BUILDING " KEY TO MOVE FORWARD ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER DAS Williams  ] discussed the purpose and ramifications of her visit and the Mail Talks during an extended meeting with Vice Foreign Minister [PER Dagoberto Rodriguez  ] . 
They agreed that further " confidence building " was essential , and acknowledged the considerable work that lies ahead . 
When [PER DAS Williams  ] brought up the treatment of prisoners in [MISC Cuban  ] jails , for instance , [PER Rodriguez  ] noted how dialogue on this would be possible but only with countries with which there is " sufficient confidence " and mutual respect . 
The same , he said , applied to scholarships and lifting reciprocal travel restrictions on [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats in [LOC Cuba  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] diplomats in [LOC Washington  ] , to name just two areas. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG VM Rodriguez  ] seemed optimistic that things were moving in a positive direction . 
" We see a change in the rhetoric , " he told [PER Williams  ] . 
" Even within the existing diplomatic constraints , we see a way forward . 
" In granting [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000592 002 OF 006 almost all of [ORG DAS Williams'  ] requests for Government of [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) meetings , " we meant to show our readiness to move forward in our relationship , " he added . 
RELAXING RESTRICTIONS ON USINT --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) At the meeting , [ORG VM Rodriguez  ] announced that the [ORG GOC  ] would grant the [PER Mission  ] , effective immediately , access to eight [MISC Cuban-Americans  ] serving prison terms here ( [ORG REF  ] A ) , including those outside the confines of [ORG Havana Province  ] , and extend diplomatic protections to our short and long-term temporary duty personnel , including granting them multiple-entry visas ( Note: The [ORG GOC  ] , s abrupt decision in 2007 to stop issuing multiple-entry visas to the [LOC U.S.  ] MSG detachment has been a bilateral point of contention as well as a serious morale and operational challenge for post . 
End Note ) . 
That is as far as it goes for now , the [ORG VM  ] said . 
Acknowledging that the [ORG USG  ] has already indicated readiness to move from authorized to notified travel for [MISC Cuban  ] diplomats in [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Rodriguez  ] said that more confidence-building would be required before the [ORG GOC  ] would be willing to lift long-standing restrictions on travel by USINT personnel outside [LOC Havana  ] . 
STILL WARY OF OUR HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Although [ORG VM  ] [PER Rodriguez  ] said that the domestic travel restrictions had been placed in response to [LOC U.S.  ] limits on [MISC Cuban  ] diplomats in [LOC Washington  ] , he complained about our emphasis on raising human rights wherever we go . 
" I would note that when those trips took place , they were only used for just one type of activity , " he said , in reference to outreach to the island 's political opposition . 
" Sometimes it seemed that the only purpose of the trip was to pursue that type of meeting . 
" He went on to complain that " your policy until now has been that civil society is only made up of one type of people ; [MISC Cuban  ] civil society is much broader than these small circles . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] repeatedly warned [PER DAS Williams  ] about meeting with leading dissident " criminals , " and was especially sensitive to the idea that international media might portray such contact in a way that embarrasses the regime . 
[ORG VM Rodriguez  ] showed no flexibility on the two specific human rights cases raised , requests for medical leave for prisoner of conscience [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and an exit permit for the wife of prisoner of conscience [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to travel to [LOC Spain  ] for medical treatment . 
THE [ORG EU  ] ON THE GROUND AND THE OPPOSITION --------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassadors of [LOC Sweden  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC Hungary  ] , [LOC France  ] and the [ORG EU  ] charge , told [PER DAS Williams  ] at a roundtable meeting that the access of their visitors to the [ORG GOC  ] was always conditioned on shunning the opposition . 
When they learned that [PER Williams  ] would see opposition anyway , they announced that they would protest the " double standard " and would begin to demand similar leeway for their visitors. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The meeting with the [ORG EU  ] countries exposed the divisions between those that place human rights at the top of their agenda , like [LOC Sweden  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , and those that do not , like [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
Some in the latter camp , joined by the [ORG EU  ] representative at the meeting , dismissed the dissidents in the same terms as the [ORG GOC  ] , insisting that " they [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000592 003 OF 006 do not represent anyone . 
" The [LOC UK  ] Ambassador told us that the [ORG EU  ] was so divided that they could not even agree upon a set of specific human rights benchmarks . 
( [ORG REF  ] B ) " It 's not that we're not doing human rights , " the [ORG EU  ] rep replied , " but we want to trade and invest . 
" The [LOC UK  ] Ambassador told us on the side that potential visitors from countries interested in meeting with civil society ( e.g. , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Hungary  ] ) are undercut with the [ORG GOC  ] by visits from [ORG EU  ] countries who are not interested ( e.g. , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC France  ] ) . 
The [ORG EU  ] group was uniformly critical of the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo on [LOC Cuba  ] , yet they volunteered that the embargo gave the [ORG USG  ] leverage with the [ORG GOC  ] which the [ORG EU  ] lacked . 
OPTIMISM IN THE [MISC CUBAN  ] CIVIL SOCIETY ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER DAS Williams  ] met separately with a broad range of civil society activists , including dissidents , former political prisoners , independent journalists and bloggers . 
Although scathing in their assessment of the [ORG GOC  ] 's intentions towards the [LOC United States  ] , they all strongly supported continued government-to-government engagement and expressed great appreciation for the opportunity to meet with a visiting high-ranking [LOC U.S.  ] official . 
" For the first time [LOC Cuba  ] has an administration in the [LOC U.S.  ] which is dealing intelligently and eschewing rhetoric , " [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us . 
They also urged patience . 
" The process of change is afoot , I know it will be slow , but the top is crumbling , " [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The bloggers , who partly out of self-preservation do not want to be lumped in with the dissident community , were equally optimistic about the course of events . 
" An improvement in relations with the [LOC United States  ] is absolutely necessary for democracy to emerge here , " blogging pioneer and Time magazine 's 100-most influential person [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER DAS Williams  ] in her modest apartment . 
" Restrictions only hurt us , " she added . 
" Do you know how much more we could do if we could use [ORG Pay Pal  ] or purchase things on-line with a credit card ? 
" POSSIBLE OPENING FOR ACADEMIC COOPERATION ----------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In [PER DAS Williams  ] , meetings with [MISC Cuban  ] officials , the [ORG GOC  ] criticized the [ORG USG  ] , s " one-sided " approach to academic cooperation . 
[ORG VM Rodriguez  ] said that , as confidence builds , the [ORG GOC  ] would review whether to loosen its strict stance on [MISC U.S.-sponsored  ] scholarships . 
" The key is what kind of relationship we have , it doesn't make sense to do scholarships now when relations are poor . 
" He noted , however , that [LOC Cuba  ] would prefer scholarships in the hard sciences , and in the past the [ORG USG  ] had offered only social science courses. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Despite this , [PER DAS Williams  ] , meeting at the [ORG University of Havana  ] was positive , constructive , and frank , with a focus on learning from past failures and exploring avenues for future cooperation . 
The [ORG University  ] was represented by the Vice Rector for [ORG International Relations  ] , the Director of the [ORG Center for U.S. Studies  ] , and other faculty and staff . 
The Vice Rector noted approvingly that this was the highest ranking [LOC U.S.  ] visit ever to the [ORG University  ] , and hoped that this indicated a positive change in posture towards academic cooperation . 
[ORG University  ] officials appeared open to [PER DAS Williams  ] , suggestion that they invite USINT COM or other [MISC American  ] speakers to the [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000592 004 OF 006 university to discuss topics of interest to students in an academic , symposium-like setting where there could be real give and take . 
EXPLAINING THE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM ------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER DAS Williams  ] told officials that the [ORG USG  ] was concerned that [MISC Cuban  ] students who had applied for the [MISC USG-offered  ] scholarships were now being subjected to reprisals and discriminatory treatment at the university . 
She noted that although the university may not have sanctioned such treatment , we had credible reports of its occurrence . 
Responding , [ORG University  ] officials denied reports of officially-sanctioned mistreatment of [ORG USG  ] scholarship applicants . 
They said that the reason the students were prevented from accepting the scholarships stemmed from lack of advanced coordination with the [ORG University  ] . 
Noting that the [ORG USG  ] scholarship program was course credit-oriented and was not compatible with the [ORG University  ] , s course structure which could not accommodate any lengthy absence during the academic year , the Vice Rector suggested that in the future we propose graduate-level research courses . 
[ORG University of Havana  ] officials were surprised when [PER DAS Williams  ] noted that we had shared information with the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] regarding the proposed educational exchanges well in advance , forcing the a [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] representative at the meeting to explain that the [ORG GOC  ] had decided unilaterally as a matter of foreign policy that [MISC Cuban  ] students would not be allowed to participate in the program . 
LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION --------------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOC  ] pushed hard for increased law enforcement cooperation , especially in counternarcotics . 
The top drug fighter at the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , Colonel [PER Jorge Samper  ] , commented that bilateral cooperation was often one-sided , and that the [ORG GOC  ] would like to be able to work more closely with the [LOC United States  ] in sharing information about trafficking patterns in the region . 
[ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials told us that they would be submitting " next month at the latest " a proposal to increase cooperation in counter-narcotics trafficking , including money laundering . 
( Note: this is the same proposal that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] promised to deliver the week after the Migration Talks in [LOC New York  ] in July ) . <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOC  ] also informed us that they had no objections to the voluntary repatriation of Amcit fugitive [PER Luis Armando Pena Soltren  ] who is wanted in the [LOC United States  ] for hijacking an aircraft from the [LOC United States  ] to [LOC Cuba  ] in 1968 . 
The [ORG GOC  ] also received with obvious interest a request from the [ORG U.S. Department of Justice  ] that [LOC Cuba  ] provide evidence and witnesses in the case against [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a request we made to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] by diplomatic note during the visit . 
CHALLENGING OUR TIPS , TERRORISM AND HUMAN RIGHTS LISTS ------------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER DAS Williams  ] told [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Foreign  ] ministry officials that we were aware of the [MISC Cuban  ] government , s dissatisfaction with their ranking in the [LOC U.S.  ] reports on trafficking in persons and human rights . 
( [ORG REF  ] C ) She encouraged the [ORG GOC  ] to meet with USINT officials to provide data relevant to both reports , stressing in particular that the trafficking report required information on prosecutions that we had been unable to verify . 
They bristled at the mere [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000592 005 OF 006 suggestion . 
" Nowhere in international law does it say that the [LOC U.S.  ] should or can prepare a report on [LOC Cuba  ] , " the Director of the [ORG International Cooperation Division  ] of the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] stated . 
" With all due respect , we have no obligation to report anywhere except to the international bodies . 
When we get to the day of normalization , we could perhaps get to a point where we can discuss these things . 
" <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) On terrorism , the [MISC Cubans  ] took a similar line . 
" What right do you have to judge other countries ? 
" [ORG VM Rodriguez  ] asked . 
" If we were to do our own list the [LOC U.S.  ] would be there because in the [LOC United States  ] there are thousands of [MISC Cubans  ] who are truly terrorists . 
" However , on terrorism the [MISC Cubans  ] seemed slightly less reluctant to engage . 
[PER DAS Williams  ] stressed that removal from the sponsors of terrorism list would be possible if specific procedures were followed and she encouraged [PER VFM Rodriguez  ] to meet with COM [PER Farrar  ] to review the process . 
" You just told us to study how to get off the list without telling us how , " [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's Director of the [ORG International Cooperation  ] [PER Josefina Vidal  ] pleaded , leaving the door open to further discussions on this . 
[LOC U.S.  ] FUGITIVES ---------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER DAS Williams  ] took the opportunity to press the [MISC Cubans  ] on the over 100 fugitives believed to be resident in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
She told [ORG Interior  ] and [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials that the issue would not go away and that we would continue to seek their return . 
Noting that similar [MISC Cuban  ] requests were ignored in the early 1960s , [PER Vidal  ] quipped: " We have a long list ourselves . 
" MAKING AN IMPACT IN THE HURRICANE IMPACT ZONE -------------------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER DAS Williams  ] got a chance to visit the worst-hit areas by hurricanes [ORG Ike  ] and [PER Gustav  ] in 2008 , in [LOC Cuba  ] 's westernmost province of [LOC Pinar  ] del [LOC Rio  ] . 
Unlike in 2008 , when we were kept at arm 's length by the [ORG GOC  ] , the regional authorities received us warmly , giving us a detailed presentation of the damage and rebuilding work . 
The [MISC Venezuelans  ] supplied roofing material -- " they send us one container after another , week after week , " Provincial [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us -- and even building a model 38-home neighborhood of aluminum-walled , steamy homes . 
Stiff and unsure of our intentions at first , the Chairman and his entourage became progressively affable as the visit went on , even riding in the [MISC USINT  ] van with our delegation to encourage us to visit more often . 
THE MEDICAL SCHOOL -------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Despite having repeatedly denied [MISC USINT  ] permission to visit the [MISC Latin American Medical School  ] ( [ORG ELAM  ] ) just outside the limits of [ORG Havana Province  ] , the [ORG GOC  ] consented to [ORG DAS Williams'  ] request . 
At [ORG ELAM  ] , we met a half-dozen [MISC American  ] students who enrolled in the six-year program through the [MISC U.S.-based  ] Pastors for Peace program . 
They were enthusiastic with [ORG ELAM  ] 's focus on social work , and happy to see their country 's representatives . 
They told us that they were unaware that [MISC USINT  ] had been kept from visiting them at [ORG ELAM  ] . 
The students had few complaints about the school , but at least one urged for assistance in easing the process of receiving funds from home . 
All of the students lamented that their academic study in [LOC Cuba  ] does not qualify them to defer [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000592 006 OF 006 payment of their undergraduate student loans as they would have been able to if they had pursued medical training in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( Note: [MISC USINT  ] Consular section will follow-up with [LOC CA  ] on how to facilitate their ability to receive financial support from their parents in the [LOC U.S.  ] End Note . 
) THE CONCERT ------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) While the visit was taking place , another event --the " Peace Without Borders " concert organized by [MISC Colombian  ] musician [PER Juanes--  ] dominated the news . 
[MISC Cubans  ] of all stripes read subtle messages everywhere , from the song selections to the statements proffered from the stage . 
What was unique was how universally praised the concert was here . 
Vice Foreign Minister [PER Rodriguez  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] both agreed that the concert had turned a page in [MISC Cuban  ] history . 
" The concert is a beginning , it 's part of what are doing , " [PER Rodriguez  ] said . 
COMMENT: TIME TO TAKE STOCK AND FOLLOW UP --------------------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) It is hard to overstate just how markedly improved were our dealings with the [MISC Cuban  ] Government and [ORG GOC  ] institutions during the [MISC Mail Talks  ] and subsequent meetings of [ORG DAS Williams'  ] visit . 
Whether this presages a true operational shift on the part of the [ORG GOC  ] remains to be seen . 
What is clear is that the [ORG GOC  ] is willing to fine-tune its adversarial stance if it sees it in its interest to do so . 
This presents us with enormous opportunities to set and influence the terms of our future exchanges ( Septel ) . 
As we did during the visit , we will continue to press the point that the [ORG GOC  ] engagement with the [MISC Cuban  ] people will do more to influence the bilateral relationship than its government-to-government engagement . 
Nonetheless , there are a number of action items from the various meetings that provide opportunity for us to test the [ORG GOC  ] , s willingness to continue to make progress on issues of interest .
