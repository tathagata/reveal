( S ) Summary . 
[MISC Dutch  ] government sources continue to anticipate an early March release of [PER Geert Wilders'  ] film on the [MISC Koran  ] ; they are confident that [PER Wilders  ] will give the government 24 hours notice before the film is released . 
The government is actively engaging key figures in the [MISC Muslim  ] world to stress that it does not share [PER Wilders'  ] views on [MISC Islam  ] but that censorship of the film is not an option . 
The [MISC GONL  ] is particularly concerned about the potential for violent , extremist reactions to the film in [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
Moderates in the [MISC Dutch  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community have been actively engaged in encouraging non-violent responses at home and in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Officials at [PER NCTb  ] and [ORG MFA  ] expressed frustration that leaks about government contingency planning for the release of the film has had the effect of exaggerating the potential impact of the film itself . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Peter Knoope  ] , the Deputy Director for Policy and Strategy in the Office of the [ORG National Counterterrorism Coordinator  ] , told emboffs January 30 that the [MISC Dutch  ] government anticipates an early March release of [MISC Dutch  ] MP [PER Geert Wilders'  ] film on the [MISC Koran  ] . 
He noted that numerous moderate groups and individuals within the [ORG Dutch Muslim  ] community were actively urging [MISC Muslims  ] to remain calm in response to the film , both in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and abroad , and endorsing the value of freedom of expression . 
In particular , he said , several civil society groups had taken the initiative to communicate with government and religious authorities in [LOC Iraq  ] and other countries in the [MISC Muslim  ] world to urge them not to " " lash out " " against the [MISC Dutch  ] in reaction to the release of the film . 
[PER Knoope  ] said this response from moderate [MISC Muslims  ] demonstrated growing " " resilience " " among [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Muslims.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Knoope  ] said the government 's domestic communication strategy would build-on , and as appropriate , support , the [ORG Dutch Muslim  ] community 's own efforts to discourage violent reactions to the film . 
The diplomatic strategy was designed to stress four key points: 1 ) the importance of freedom of expression ; 2 ) the government cannot impose prior censorship , in particular on a film yet to be completed ; 3 ) [PER Wilders  ] is an opposition MP , not part of the governing coalition ; and 4 ) the [MISC Dutch  ] government does not share [PER Wilders'  ] views on the [MISC Koran  ] or on [MISC Islam  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] government officials in The [ORG Hague  ] and at diplomatic posts were actively engaging government and civil society leaders in key [MISC Muslim  ] countries to convey the four points . 
Once the film was released , the government would act quickly to get the same message out to a broader audience . 
[PER Knoope  ] noted the government had taken action in the past year to disassociate itself from [PER Wilders'  ] anti-Islamic statements -- such as [PER Wilders'  ] early 2007 statement that [MISC European Muslims  ] should tear up half the [MISC Koran  ] -- and would do so again . 
[PER Knoope  ] added that in some respects , leaks and subsequent extensive press reporting on the government 's contingency planning had become a bigger issue than the film itself ; he said it was perfectly normal for national and local public safety officials to prepare for potential adverse reactions , but the massive attention to the issue had blown its concerns out of proportion. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Knoope  ] stated that [PER NCTb  ] remained more concerned about the potential for violent reactions to the film in the [LOC Middle East  ] than in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
They were most seriously concerned about [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] , he said , adding that they were not sure which elements in these countries had a political interest in instigating violent reactions to the film . 
[PER Knoope  ] stated that [PER NCTb  ] 's analysis indicated that organized reactions to the film in those countries would focus on the [LOC Netherlands  ] as a target for retaliation . 
THE HAGUE 00000102 002 OF 002 Extremist groups in these countries had no intention of expanding the focus of violent protests to include [LOC Europe  ] or the [LOC West  ] , as the [LOC Netherlands  ] was seen as a small country that could be " " taken on " " relatively easily . 
He said that extremists in the region considered the violent response to the [MISC Danish  ] cartoons in the [LOC Middle East  ] as a " " success , " " and were now looking at the anticipated release of the [PER Wilders  ] film as the next issue they could exploit to advance the extremist cause. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Knoope  ] noted that while the government has no intention of imposing prior censorship , the appropriate authorities would review its contents once it is released to determine whether it violates [MISC Dutch  ] law on hate speech or slander . 
He added that under [MISC Dutch  ] law , freedom of expression does not necessarily extend to a " " right to offend ; " " the [MISC Dutch  ] requirement was that public statements not " " unnecessarily offend . 
" " He acknowledged that that could be a subjective standard. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Knoope  ] dismissed the possibility that [PER Wilders  ] would ultimately decline to release the film ; there was " " not a chance " " of this happening , he said . 
He suggested it was possible that [PER Wilders  ] could modify the content somewhat in the final stages of editing , but he would definitely release something . 
[PER Knoope  ] said he was confident that [PER Wilders  ] would live up to the commitment he has given [PER NCTb  ] to provide 24 hour notice prior to releasing the film , adding that , " " he knows he needs us to stay alive . 
" " ( Note . 
[PER NCTb  ] 's Surveillance and [ORG Protection Department  ] is responsible for determining the level of close protection provided for [PER Wilders  ] , who has received government security protection since the 2004 murder of [MISC Dutch  ] filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Knoope  ] welcomed the information provided by emboffs on the [MISC USG  ] initial press guidance on the film , which he said was consistent with the [MISC Dutch  ] government 's own message . 
In a subsequent meeting with emboffs , [PER Andre van Wiggen  ] of the [ORG MFA Terrorism  ] and [ORG New Threats Department  ] also expressed appreciation for the guidance , and for our close coordination with the [MISC Dutch  ] government on this issue . 
[PER Van Wiggen  ] also expressed frustration with leaks about the government 's contingency planning , which he said complicated the implementation of its communication strategy .
