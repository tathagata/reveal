( C ) IN DEVELOPING [LOC U.S.  ] POLICY VIS-A-VIS THIS UNIQUE ENTITY , POLICYMAKERS SHOULD THINK OF [ORG THE HOLY  ] SEE AS SIMILAR TO A TRADITIONAL NATION-STATE , WITH A VARIETY OF FACTORS INFORMING ITS FOREIGN POLICY . 
[ORG THE MOST  ] IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY DECISION MAKING INCLUDE: -- RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES/HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS: [ORG THE VATICAN  ] STRIVES TO TRANSLATE ITS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND ITS HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS INTO CONCRETE POLICIES . 
[ORG CONFIDENTIAL PAGE  ] 04 [ORG VATICA  ] 03507 01 OF 04 031719Z FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES BASED ON THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE: SUPPORT FOR THIRD WORLD DEVELOPMENT AND DEBT RELIEF FOR POORER COUNTRIES , OPPOSITION TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT , OPPOSITION TO ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION , AND OPPOSITION ( ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS ) TO EMBARGOES ; -- “NATIONAL” SELF-INTEREST: [ORG THE HOLY  ] SEE SEEKS TO PROTECT CATHOLICS AROUND [ORG THE WORLD  ] , ITS OWN POSITION OF INFLUENCE , AND ITS VAST WEALTH . 
[ORG THE VATICAN’S  ] SUPPORT OF SADDAM HUSSEIN RESULTS FROM ITS DESIRE TO PROTECT 600,000 IRAQI CATHOLICS FROM ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM ; ITS REFUSAL TO PUBLICLY CRITICIZE CROAT NATIONALIST CLERGY IN [LOC BOSNIA  ] STEMS IN PART FROM THE CROAT CHURCH’S STAUNCH DEFENSE OF THE FAITH DURING THE COLD WAR ; -- HISTORY/TRADITION: RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND [LOC SPAIN  ] , [LOC PORTUGAL  ] , AND OTHER LATIN COUNTRIES GO BACK OVER 500 YEARS .

[LOC VATICAN  ] II IN THE 1960S WAS AN EXAMPLE . 
INTERFAITH AND ECUMENICAL OUTREACH IS AN IMPORTANT FOCUS OF [ORG THE CURRENT  ] PAPACY , AND PROSELYTISM/POPULATION GROWTH IN THE THIRD CONFIDENTIAL PAGE 02 [ORG VATICA  ] 03507 02 OF 04 031715Z WORLD ACCOUNTS FOR MUCH OF THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH IN RECENT YEARS. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) PAPAL HEALTH/SUCCESSION AND WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR [LOC U.S.  ] POLICY: POPE [PER JOHN PAUL  ] II IS SURELY [ORG THE MOST WIDELY RECOGNIZED  ] WORLD LEADER . 
ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE [LOC UNITED STATES  ] , HE ENJOYS [ORG THE HIGHEST  ] STATURE AND PROFILE AMONG WORLD LEADERS . 
IN EARLY 2000 , PRESS MISREPRESENTATION OF A [MISC GERMAN  ] BISHOP’S REMARKS IN THE POPE [PER JOHN PAUL II’S  ] ABILITY TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE , SPARKED A SERIES OF SPECULATIONS AROUND [ORG THE WORLD  ] ABOUT SUCCESSION . 
[ORG THE  ] POPE AND [ORG THE VATICAN STRONGLY DENIED  ] THAT HIS CONDITION WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT ABDICATION . 
THERE IS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR [ORG THE IDEA  ] THAT THE POPE WOULD IN FACT RESIGN EVEN IF HIS HEALTH WERE TO DECLINE PRECIPITOUSLY . 
[ORG THE LIST  ] OF CARDINALS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY AMERICANS , AND ONLY ONE ANGLOPHONE . 
AN ELECTION OF A EUROPEAN CARDINAL ( MOST LIKELY AN [MISC ITALIAN  ] ) WOULD PROBABLY RESULT IN ONLY MINOR CHANGES IN [LOC VATICAN  ] POLICY AND ITS CURRENT STANCE ON ISSUES VIS A VIS [ORG THE  ] [LOC UNITED STATES  ] . 
IF [ORG THE NEXT  ] POPE IS FROM LATIN AMERICA , [LOC ASIA  ] , OR AFRICA , WE SHOULD EXPECT THE [LOC VATICAN  ] TO TAKE POSITIONS FURTHER TO THE “LEFT OF CURRENT [LOC U.S.  ] POSITIONS ON ECONOMIC ISSUES , BUT FURTHER “RIGHT” ON SOCIAL ISSUES . 
MIDDLE EAST ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS ( MEPP ) : [ORG THE HOLY  ] SEE DENIES WANTING TO BECOME INVOLVED IN [ORG THE POLITICAL  ] CONFIDENTIAL PAGE 03 [ORG VATICA  ] 03507 02 OF 04 031715Z ASPECTS OF THE MEPP , ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS KEENLY INTERESTED IN WHAT IT TERMS THE “CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS” ASPECTS OF [ORG THE HOLY  ] SITES IN [ORG THE REGION  ] ( SPECIFICALLY [LOC JERUSALEM  ] ) . 
[ORG THE VATICAN  ] MAINTAINS THAT ITS CONCERNS HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED BY [ORG THE USG  ] AND [ORG THE ISRAELIS  ] , AND IN 1999 WORKED WITH THE FRENCH AND SEVERAL OTHER EU COUNTRIES IN THE “JERUSALEM WORKING GROUP” ( JWG -- SINCE INACTIVE ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG THE VATICAN  ] WAS CLEARLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE USG AND GOI DECLINED TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE JWG INITIATIVE . 
[ORG THE GOI’S  ] DECISION TO ALLOW CONSTRUCTION OF [ORG THE NAZARETH MOSQUE CREATED ALARM  ] ( AND IN SOME CASES , RESENTMENT ) AT [ORG THE VATICAN  ] . 
[ORG THE GOI  ] FOR ITS PART WAS CONCERNED THAT [ORG THE  ] POPE LEFT UNANSWERED BASHIR ASSAD’S ANTI-SEMITIC INVECTIVE DURING [ORG THE POPE’S MAY  ] 2001 [LOC SYRIA  ] VISIT . 
WE CAN EXPECT CONTINUED TENSION IN THESE AREAS . 
[ORG THE HOLY  ] SEE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE MEPP , WHILE DENYING THIS INTENTION . 
EMBASSY VATICAN CONTINUES TO RECOMMEND A HIGH LEVEL VISIT TO ENCOURAGE [ORG THE VATICAN  ] TO PLAY A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE , OR AT LEAST LESS UNHELPFUL , ROLE IN [ORG THE PROCESS  ] . 
[LOC ASIA  ] ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .

CONTACT WITH THESE MISSIONARY ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDES UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES . 
[ORG THE DEVELOPMENT  ] OF [ORG THE CATHOLIC  ] FAITH IN ASIA IS AN EXPRESS GOAL OF [ORG THE CHURCH  ] . 
[ORG THE VATICAN  ] AND ITS CONSTITUENT EPISCOPATES ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DIALOGUES WITH POLITICALLY POWERFUL MUSLIM AND [PER CHRISTIAN  ] ORTHODOX FAITHS . 
[ORG THE RESULTS  ] OF THESE DIALOGUES WILL IMPACT PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRACY , STABILITY , RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) CHINA: WITH ITS OWN NETWORK OF CONTACTS AMONG CHINA’S UNDERGROUND AND PATRIOTIC CHURCHES , [ORG THE HOLY  ] SEE HAS EXCELLENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION REGARDING DISSIDENTS , [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS  ] , RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER THE POPULATION . 
THERE IS A CONSTANT CONTROVERSY AROUND THE EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES .
