( C ) During an hour-long meeting on February 17 , [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] discussed with Senator [PER Joseph Lieberman  ] the problems with [LOC Gaza  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation , as well as the broader political split within the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] sought Gamal’s advice on ways for the [LOC U.S.  ] to engage [LOC Iran  ] ; [PER Gamal  ] offered that the best way to defeat [MISC Iranian  ] ambitions in the region is to make progress on the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace process . 
Unfortunately , [LOC Qatar  ] is playing “spoiler” in order to get “a seat at the table.” [PER Gamal  ] , a former international banker , opined that the [LOC U.S.  ] needed to “shock” its financial system back to health , and said that [LOC Egypt  ] -- which had so far escaped much of the pain of the global economic crisis -- was preparing to face tough economic times ahead . 
The Ambassador , Senator Lieberman’s foreign policy adviser , and the [ORG ECPO MinCouns  ] as note taker were also present . 
End summary. ---- [LOC Gaza  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) After welcoming [PER Senator Lieberman  ] , [PER Gamal  ] began by criticizing the [MISC Israeli  ] government’s “last minute” decision not to move forward on the [LOC Gaza  ] ceasefire without the release of [PER Corporal Shalit  ] . 
This complicates several aspects of the [LOC Israel  ] [MISC Palestinian  ] conflict , [PER Gamal  ] explained , not simply the situation in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The various [MISC Palestinian  ] factions are due to begin reconciliation talks in [LOC Cairo  ] “in about 10 days” and this development will make those discussions more difficult . 
It makes [LOC Egypt  ] look bad , and strengthens [ORG Hamas.  ] -------------------------------------- [MISC Iranian  ] Exploitation of [LOC Arab Divisions  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Another complicating factor , [PER Gamal  ] explained , is the current split within [MISC Arab  ] ranks between “moderates” ( [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ) and “radicals” ( [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] ) . 
This polarization , he opined , has “paralyzed the peace process.” [LOC Iran  ] has skillfully exploited -- using [ORG Hamas  ] -- the lack of movement towards peace . 
As long as there was a viable peace process , [PER Gamal  ] averred , “there was no place for [MISC Iran.”  ] The best way to thwart [MISC Iranian  ] ambitions in the region , according to [PER Gamal  ] , is to reinvigorate the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace process . 
What is also needed , he continued , is a unified [MISC Palestinian  ] government. “The [MISC Palestinians  ] need elections , both presidential and parliamentary.” ------------------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] Re-engagement with [LOC Tehran  ] ? ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Lieberman  ] asked [PER Gamal  ] if he thought the [LOC United States  ] should re-engage with [LOC Iran.  ] “As long as Ahmedinejad is there , I am skeptical , ” [PER Gamal  ] responded . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] said he shared that skepticism , but explained that the new administration believes the [LOC U.S.  ] should try to engage the [MISC Iranians  ] , but no clear strategy has yet emerged in [LOC Washington  ] ; [PER Dennis Ross  ] has been tasked with “reviewing” the situation . 
The one thing that is clear , [PER Gamal  ] stressed , is that by removing [PER Saddam  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] opened the door for [LOC Iran  ] to flex its muscles and spread its influence throughout the region. “Like it or not , [PER Saddam  ] was a stumbling block to [MISC Iranian  ] aspirations . 
His fall led directly to an increase in [MISC Iranian  ] influence on the region.” Now , it is all the more important not to send a message of weakness to the [MISC Iranians  ] , [PER Gamal  ] said , “neither from the [LOC U.S.  ] , nor from the moderates in the region.” We cannot “concede to their policy of aggression.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There are many in the region , [PER Gamal  ] explained , who believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] was weakened by its actions in [LOC Iraq  ] , and that [LOC Iran  ] was strengthened . 
Furthermore , there is a perception that the [LOC U.S.  ] has been hurt by the economic crisis and that it will be more inward looking for the next few years . 
Therefore , the [MISC Americans  ] , it is said , will deal with problems in the region in a “less confrontational” fashion , and “may be willing to compromise . 
[LOC Iran  ] is working hard to convince others that this is the case.” This creates a very dangerous situation for moderate states like [LOC Egypt  ] , [PER Gamal  ] stressed . 
Noting that there was some truth in this analysis , particularly concerning the economic straits the [LOC U.S.  ] is in , [PER Senator Lieberman  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] will nonetheless engage in an even more aggressive [LOC Middle East  ] foreign policy than previously , as evidenced by President Obama’s choice of Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] . 
[PER Gamal  ] welcomed this reassurance , noting that the [ORG GCC  ] states in particular are “terrified” of [LOC Iran  ] . 
Just the previous week , he said , an [MISC Iranian  ] general had said publicly that [LOC Bahrain  ] “has always been part of [LOC Iran  ] , ” as well as the [PER Tunb Islands.  ] ----- [LOC Qatar  ] ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Lieberman  ] then asked [PER Gamal  ] for his assessment of [MISC Qatari  ] behavior . 
They are coordinating closely with [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Gamal  ] said , “in an orchestrated attack on [LOC Egypt  ] and other moderate [MISC Arab  ] states.” [LOC Qatar  ] has enabled [ORG Hamas  ] to hamper every effort we have made to cement a ceasefire in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
For some reason , [LOC Qatar  ] seems to want to play the role of spoiler , [PER Gamal  ] surmised. “Even regarding the March 2nd [LOC Gaza  ] conference we are hosting , they have called for another [MISC Arab  ] only meeting in [LOC Doha  ] just two days before.” In response to Senator Lieberman’s question as to [MISC Qatari  ] motives , [PER Gamal  ] responded , “They just want a place at the table , no matter what.” --------------- [ORG Egypt’s Economy  ] --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to the impact of the global financial crisis on [LOC Egypt  ] , [PER Gamal  ] -- a former international banker -- said that while [LOC Egypt  ] has so far escaped the worst effects of the crisis , “we are bound to feel the brunt of it eventually.” Because [ORG Egypt’s  ] banking sector was thoroughly overhauled about five years ago , he explained , it is in much better shape than it night have been . 
Nonetheless , [LOC Egypt  ] expects to see significantly lower GDP figures in 2009 ; “the most recent quarterly numbers are already way down.” The one ray of good news , [PER Gamal  ] said , is that inflation also is down ; “nonetheless , we know we are in for a rough ride.” [LOC Egypt  ] will be watching the [LOC United States  ] very closely , [PER Gamal  ] said . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] asked for his advice as an experienced international financier. “Your banking system needs a shock , ” [PER Gamal  ] offered. “You need a dramatic fix . 
Unless you get the banking sector revived , nothing else will come around.” However , [PER Gamal  ] continued , a piecemeal approach to the problem will not be enough ; you need to inject even more money into the system than you have , and you need to get as much of the bad debt as possible out of it ; “you must remove the toxic assets from the books” and restore the confidence of investors and consumers . 
Senator [PER Lieberman  ] agreed on the need for bold measures to restore confidence. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
