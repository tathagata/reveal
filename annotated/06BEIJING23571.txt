End Summary . 
[ORG Google  ] Earth [ORG High Resolution Images a Threat  ] to [LOC China  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Google  ] Earth is providing high resolution images of sensitive [MISC Chinese  ] facilities over the [MISC Internet  ] , thereby endangering [LOC PRC  ] national security , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] during a [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] meeting . 
These facilities include military installations , nuclear test sites , satellite launch sites , oil production facilities , power generating plants and important government departments . 
The resolution is one meter for most of [LOC China  ] , and is as fine as 0.6 meters in [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Shanghai  ] , allowing anyone with [MISC Internet  ] access to view these facilities in great detail . 
Moreover , [ORG Google  ] Earth allows users to post information about specific locations , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] continued , which means information about important [MISC Chinese  ] agencies and sensitive installations is effectively being published on the [MISC Internet  ] . 
" Grave Consequences " if Terrorists Use Imagery --------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [LOC China  ] is extremely concerned that terrorist organizations could access the high resolution imagery and posted information and present a grave threat to [LOC PRC  ] national security . 
If terrorists used the imagery from [ORG Google  ] Earth to cause damage to [LOC China  ] , there would be " grave consequences , " warned [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
In the spirit of our sound bilateral cooperative relationship , particularly on counterterrorism issues , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked that the [LOC United States  ] place " great importance " on [LOC China  ] 's concerns , understand the sensitivity of the matter and take action so that [ORG Google  ] will reduce the resolution of the images of [LOC China  ] 's sensitive facilities . 
[ORG DCM:  ] [ORG Google  ] a [ORG Private Company  ] , and Not Imagery Source --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he would report the request to [LOC Washington  ] , but noted that [ORG Google  ] is a private company . 
The [ORG DCM  ] said he had no information to offer on what , if any , role or response the [LOC United States  ] Government might have to the [MISC Chinese  ] presentation . 
The [ORG DCM  ] noted that the [MISC Chinese  ] points only asked for a reduction in the resolution and asked if the [MISC Chinese  ] sought any specific level . 
The [ORG DCM  ] also asked whether [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had contacted [ORG Google  ] directly and , since [ORG Google  ] purchases the imagery as any individual or entity can , whether [LOC China  ] had contacted the satellite imagery providers . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX: Other , Unspecified [MISC Countries Have Similar Concerns  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] responded that [LOC China  ] is approaching the [LOC United States  ] Government because the issue is directly relevant to counterterrorism and that while [ORG Google  ] is a private company it operates in the [LOC United States  ] " political and legal environment . 
" [LOC China  ] is requesting the [LOC United States  ] take action to prevent the information from being misused to cause damage to [LOC China  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reiterated . 
He offered that [LOC China  ] had been in discussions with other countries with similar concerns about [ORG Google  ] Earth . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] refused to provide the names of the other countries , noting he was unable to share the information due to prior agreements with [LOC BEIJING  ] 00023571 002 OF 002 those countries . 
[LOC Europe  ] the Source of Imagery , But [ORG Google  ] Earth is the Key --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] will talk to [ORG Google  ] about the " technical details , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] continued , adding that it is not for the MFA to determine the appropriate resolution level . 
[LOC China  ] knows the source data comes from [MISC European  ] companies , satellite operators and the [MISC European  ] space agency but [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [LOC China  ] sees [ORG Google  ] as the problem because it makes the information easily accessible . 
When pressed , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] admitted that [LOC Beijing  ] had not yet contacted the [MISC European  ] providers or the governments associated with the [MISC European  ] space program . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that while [LOC China  ] will look at the other [MISC Internet  ] sources of the high resolution imagery , [ORG Google  ] , s well known imagery is of greatest concern .
