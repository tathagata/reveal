THE HAGUE 02316 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government supports targeted sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] but not actions that limit [ORG Shell  ] 's activities there . 
[ORG Shell  ] does not plan a final [MISC Yadavaran  ] investment decision until 2008 and will keep State abreast . 
The government continues to follow negotiations between [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG Shell  ] over [ORG Sakhalin II  ] , [ORG Shell  ] 's big natural gas project . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Econoff raised [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the [LOC Iran  ] 's [MISC Yadavaran  ] oilfield project with [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) officials [PER John Roosegaarde Bisschop  ] , [ORG Gulf States  ] division head , and senior policy officer Loek ten [LOC Hagen  ] on December 15 . 
On December 18 , Econoff discussed [MISC Yadavaran  ] and developments at [ORG Sakhalin II  ] with [PER John Crocker  ] , [ORG Shell  ] 's head of international government relations. --------------------------------------- [ORG Iran Policy and Relationship  ] with [ORG Shell  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MFA  ] 's [PER Roosegaarde Bisschop  ] responded with three main points on [LOC Iran  ] . 
First , he said [ORG MFA  ] supports a [ORG UNSC  ] resolution with teeth , meaning reversible sanctions targeted against the assets and travel of individuals associated with [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
[LOC Iran  ] had crossed the line . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] , he said , fully support the P5 discussions , as part of a dialog aimed at a diplomatic solution . 
Harsher measures -- such as omnibus sanctions or those complicating [ORG Shell  ] operations -- are not on the table and would be very difficult to get through the [ORG UN  ] , he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Second , regarding [ORG Shell  ] , [PER Roosegaarde Bisschop  ] noted that [ORG Shell  ] briefs [ORG MFA  ] on a regular basis about the [MISC Pars  ] gas field development , but not [MISC Yadavaran  ] . 
While [ORG MFA  ] shares advice to ensure that [ORG Shell  ] 's activities fall on the safe side politically , the ministry refrains from voicing approval or disapproval over [ORG Shell  ] projects , he said . 
[ORG MFA  ] has become more involved with [ORG Shell  ] , he said , because the energy security situation has forced shell to look at markets where the political environment is hazardous. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Third , [PER Roosegaarde Bisschop  ] noted that [MISC French  ] and [MISC Italian  ] oil companies were much more advanced in their efforts in the [MISC Iranian  ] energy sector . 
He asked whether we had reached out to these countries with the same message. ----------------------------------------- No Final Decision on [MISC Yadavaran  ] Until 2008 ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to reftel A points , [ORG Shell  ] 's [PER Crocker  ] said that a deal on [MISC Yadavaran  ] had been imminent for months . 
He added that [ORG Shell  ] had recently seen a sense of urgency on the [MISC Iranian  ] side and some signs that the [MISC Chinese  ] were ready , but the two had yet to come to agreement . 
If they do agree , [PER Crocker  ] continued , [ORG Shell  ] would examine it and decide whether to issue a statement of interest . 
After that it would take [ORG Shell  ] 12-18 months of analysis to decide whether to invest . 
Such a decision would be taken in 2008 at the earliest , he said , adding that [ORG Shell  ] would notify State -- which he visits on a regular basis -- before any decision is made. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Crocker  ] expressed concern about [ORG USG  ] efforts to discourage investment in [LOC Iran  ] 's energy sector . 
In the short run , he said , the volume of oil produced in [LOC Iran  ] will remain unchanged , whether or not [ORG Shell  ] participates in [LOC Iran  ] oil projects . 
This is because phase I oil extraction -- a period that normally lasts 10 years -- is not tricky , and the [MISC Iranians  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] have the requisite technology to proceed on their own . 
It is from the second phase onward , [PER Crocker  ] added , where the exclusion of foreign oil companies will have an impact . 
Since this is beyond 2020 , it might make life difficult for ordinary [MISC Iranians  ] at a time when the political environment hopefully may be more friendly toward the west , [PER Crocker  ] said . 
That said , he added that [ORG Shell  ] views its relationship with the [ORG USG  ] as important and that the company is very conscious of how its actions are perceived . 
THE HAGUE 00002654 002 OF 002 --------------------------------------------- ------- [ORG Sakhalin II: Shell  ] on [ORG Possible Gazprom Participation  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On [ORG Sakhalin II  ] , [PER Crocker  ] offered thoughts on [ORG Gazprom  ] 's potential involvement and helpful [ORG USG  ] actions . 
First , [PER Crocker  ] said [ORG Shell  ] had always thought having a [MISC Russian  ] partner was a good idea , and had offered , in exchange for other assets , a 25% stake to [ORG Gazprom  ] before discussions were disrupted by the potential revocation of [ORG Shell  ] 's [ORG Sakhalin II  ] environmental permit ( reftel B ) . 
The [MISC Russians  ] , however , had offered less than 30% of what [ORG Shell  ] considered fair . 
Talks have made some progress in the last week . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] 's participation could now go either way , [PER Crocker  ] said , adding that [ORG Shell  ] is open to a [ORG Gazprom  ] stake at a different level as long as it was a commercially viable and defensible to shareholders . 
Failing this -- and if the [MISC Russian  ] government continued to use all means to apply pressure -- [ORG Shell  ] would be prepared to go to international arbitration. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Second , [PER Crocker  ] said [ORG G8  ] countries should emphasize to [LOC Russia  ] that its treatment of [ORG Shell  ] does not fit within internationally accepted norms . 
[PER Crocker  ] hoped that the [ORG G8  ] message would include a discussion of the potential delays to [MISC Japanese  ] , [MISC Korean  ] , and [LOC U.S.  ] consumers . 
A failure to deliver would hurt these countries as consumers and [LOC Russia  ] as a supplier . 
In one to two weeks , these countries may need to issue strong public statements to [LOC Russia  ] -- but for now the messages should be delivered privately , [PER Crocker  ] said .
