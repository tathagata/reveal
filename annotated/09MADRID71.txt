08 [LOC MADRID  ] 518 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Arnold A. Chacon  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) a nd ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] conducted a series of farewell calls on key [ORG GOS  ] officials in the weeks before departing Post on January 20 . 
Those meetings contributed to the information in this cable , which offers the Ambassador 's final thoughts on how the [ORG Obama Administration  ] might best engage key personalities within the [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The [ORG GOS  ] is clearly eager to ramp up its engagement with the [ORG Obama Administration  ] and plans to immediately implement a diplomatic full court press to " normalize " bilateral ties , after years of [LOC Madrid  ] perceiving itself to be on the outs with [LOC Washington  ] . 
There is currently a wave of goodwill in [LOC Spain  ] for President [PER Obama  ] and his administration . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] , who feels a spiritual kinship with President [PER Obama  ] and identifies with him in a personal way , has publicly pledged that " [PER Obama  ] will have in [LOC Spain  ] and its government a faithful ally and friend . 
" Meanwhile , Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] has publicly voiced the [ORG GOS  ] 's expectation that bilateral relations will enter " a phase of greater harmony " in which ties are " more intimate , more intense , and more fluid . 
" Senior [MISC Spanish  ] officials publicly have expressed hope that [ORG Zapatero  ] and [PER Obama  ] will have a formal meeting in 2009 , preferably at the [LOC White House  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials also have informed the media that Vice President [PER Biden  ] told [ORG Zapatero  ] in a November 17 phone conversation that he would visit [LOC Spain  ] shortly after taking office to discuss the global financial crisis . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] recently announced his interest in phoning the President soon for an in-depth conversation to discuss conflict areas and [LOC Latin America  ] - including [LOC Cuba  ] - and on other occasions has signaled his interest in cooperation on global issues such as combating terrorism , poverty and climate change . 
Managing [ORG GOS  ] expectations on the timetable and the extent of bilateral cooperation will be key to maintaining their current enthusiasm for collaborating on projects of mutual interest . 
END COMMENT. //King [PER Juan Carlos  ] de [PER Borbon//  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Ambassador urges the new Administration to engage with King [PER Juan Carlos  ] I , the [MISC Spanish  ] Head of State . 
[PER Juan Carlos  ] is well-disposed to the [LOC U.S.  ] but he will always act in what he perceives to be the best interests of [LOC Spain  ] . 
Where [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] interests coincide , he can be a formidable ally . 
In meetings , the [PER King  ] will try to charm interlocutors and will bring down the level of formality and protocol to make them feel comfortable , thereby seek to guide the relationship . 
It is best to stay at the [PER King  ] 's level of banter and not be cowed by his aura . 
If you push back with joviality at any verbal jousting , you will win his respect. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [PER King  ] has a respectful relationship with [ORG Zapatero  ] and they communicate well . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] consults and informs the [PER King  ] on issues from time to time and the [PER King  ] has no reluctance to offer his thoughts - but not his advice - on issues . 
The [PER King  ] is selective when he wants the [ORG GOS  ] to do something , discreetly passing the word through [ORG Zapatero  ] or his Cabinet . 
The [PER King  ] does have influence with [ORG Zapatero  ] when he wants to use it. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) For example , the Ambassador is convinced that the [PER King  ] was the guiding force - over the objections of Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] - in the [ORG GOS  ] naming [PER Jorge Dezcallar  ] to be the current Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The Ambassador believes this in part because the [PER King  ] identified [PER Dezcallar  ] to the Ambassador as the next [MISC Spanish  ] envoy to [LOC Washington  ] six months before the decision was announced by the [ORG GOS  ] . 
The Ambassador believes that [PER Juan Carlos  ] chose [PER Dezcallar  ] because he believes [PER Dezcallar  ] will do the best job for [LOC Spain  ] in that [LOC MADRID  ] 00000071 002 OF 006 position . 
Of course , it also helps that [PER Juan Carlos  ] likes [PER Dezcallar  ] and that [PER Dezcallar  ] has some personal allegiance to the [LOC King.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Juan Carlos  ] will visit [LOC Florida  ] ( [LOC Pensacola  ] during February 18-19 and [LOC Miami  ] on February 19 ) as part of celebrations to mark the 450th anniversary of the first [MISC Spanish  ] expedition to set foot in what is today the [LOC United States  ] . 
According to [MISC Spanish  ] press reports , [MISC Spanish  ] diplomatic sources suggest he may meet [ORG Obama Administration  ] officials during his visit. //President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero//  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Zapatero  ] is a wily politician with an uncanny ability - like a cat in a jungle - to sense opportunity or danger . 
It is dangerous to underestimate him , as many former rivals have found out too late . 
In making decisions and formulating policy , he plays to his domestic audience , especially voters outside the [LOC Madrid  ] region , which he looks down upon for a kind of " inside the [MISC Beltway  ] " insularity that he perceives as detached from the concerns and views of most [MISC Spaniards  ] . 
He is playing to the peanut gallery rather than to the front row . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] , who is heading his second minority government , is constantly fighting for the support of the 1-2 million swing voters and traditional non-voters . 
In the Ambassador 's judgment , there are no issues that [ORG Zapatero  ] would fall on his sword over ; all options are always on the table in order to achieve his immediate political goals. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Zapatero  ] has faced a steep learning curve on foreign policy issues , but has developed a broad strategic vision that recognizes the inter-relationships and cause and effect consequences of his government 's actions . 
Nowadays he is well informed on any topic . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] has the capacity to learn , absorb , and connect the dots . 
He is bright and continually gets the better of detractors who underestimate him. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Zapatero  ] is not a " conviction " politician but undoubtedly understands the [MISC Spanish  ] people and will support whatever policy appeals to them , regardless of [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
However , [ORG Zapatero  ] also has shown that if there is an issue of particular importance to the [ORG USG  ] , he can be amenable to working with us despite internal opposition . 
For example , at one point the Ambassador informed [PER Zapatero  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] CEO 's might decide to stop bidding in [LOC Spain  ] due to a growing perception that the [ORG GOS  ] was not welcoming [LOC US  ] bidders on procurement contracts . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] had told the Ambassador to let him know if there was something important to the [ORG USG  ] and he would take care of it . 
Later - when the [ORG USG  ] had agreed to advocate on behalf of [ORG GE  ] in a bid against [ORG Rolls Royce  ] for a [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MOD  ] contract to provide helicopter motors - [ORG GE  ] informed the Ambassador that failure to win the contract would cause that branch of [ORG GE  ] to cease operations in [LOC Spain  ] , which the Ambassador duly informed [ORG Zapatero  ] 's economic adviser . 
Although there was considerable all-source evidence to suggest that the [ORG MOD  ] decided to award the contract to [ORG Rolls Royce  ] , Moncloa - the office of the President - overturned the decision and it was announced that [ORG GE  ] had won the bid . 
The Ambassador is convinced that [PER Zapatero  ] personally intervened in the case in favor of [LOC GE.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] is not innately ill-disposed to the [ORG USG  ] . 
For him , foreign policy is subordinate to domestic political interests and the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship is just one more element to be viewed according to the circumstances of the moment . 
There is currently a wave of goodwill for President [PER Obama  ] in [LOC Spain  ] , which is the answer to [ORG Zapatero  ] 's prayers in that it enables him to engage the [ORG USG  ] without being dinged by the traditional anti-U.S. sentiment among his political base. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The best way to interact with [ORG Zapatero  ] in meetings is to be pleasant and relaxed and be ready for some initial banter . 
The Ambassador advises to ask him open-ended questions and allow him to talk about what 's on his mind . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 00000071 003 OF 006 [ORG Zapatero  ] will be well prepared on substance . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] welcomes dialogue and an exchange of ideas . 
He does not respond well to being lectured and will end the conversation if he perceives that is what is occurring . 
Similarly , do not corner him politically or ambush him publicly . 
Give him room and he will listen to your ideas . 
If there are political differences , they would be best discussed behind closed doors . 
It is best to have open lines of communications with [PER Zapatero  ] 's team , which has access to him at all times . 
The [ORG USG  ] needs to maintain and further cultivate access to the people who have access to [PER Zapatero  ] , the most well-connected of which are listed below. //GOS Officials with Access to [PER Zapatero//  ] I ) [PER Maria Teresa Fernandez  ] de [PER la Vega  ] , the [ORG First Vice  ] President and Minister of the Presidency <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Fernandez de la  ] [PER Vega  ] is a key player with access to [PER Zapatero  ] . 
She is his able lieutenant and the executor of his policies . 
[LOC Fernandez de la  ] [PER Vega  ] has an icy personality and brings a sterile , surgical approach to her work . 
There are rumors that [LOC Fernandez de la  ] [PER Vega  ] may be removed during an impending Cabinet shuffle by [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
The Ambassador believes that [PER Zapatero  ] has no personal allegiance to her beyond being a strong member of his team . 
She delivers and is effective at what she does , but the moment she ceases to be useful to him , he will let her go at the first politically convenient moment . 
The Ambassador does not believe she aspires to higher office and suggests she knows this post will be the peak of her career . 
She is not especially a friend of the [ORG USG  ] , but is a pragmatist and interacts with the [ORG USG  ] as needed . 
[LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors would be well advised to use a firm backbone when dealing with [LOC Fernandez de la  ] [PER Vega  ] , which the Ambassador suggests will help develop mutual respect . 
II ) [PER Bernardino Leon  ] , Secretary General of the Office of the President <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Leon  ] is a smart and impressive interlocutor who is well-connected to and has the ear of [PER Zapatero  ] ( As highlighted in [MISC REFTEL A  ] ) . 
He is the golden boy of the [ORG GOS  ] and his influence is on the rise . 
The Ambassador opines that [PER Leon  ] 's career will take him far beyond where he is now and envisions that he could easily become Foreign Minister one day . 
At present , [PER Leon  ] is more important to [ORG Zapatero  ] than Foreign Minister [ORG Moratinos  ] or any other single cabinet minister because the breadth of his duties transcends any individual ministry and has virtually no parameters . 
Although his expertise is in foreign policy , [PER Leon  ] is currently [PER Zapatero  ] 's go-to guy on both international and domestic issues ( for example , he is even involved in budget negotiations between [LOC Spain  ] 's central government and the regional governments ) . 
[PER Leon  ] commands an impressive capability to digest incredible quantities of information on a range of topics , connect the dots and present them in a insightful , cogent and persuasive fashion . 
The Ambassador likened [PER Leon  ] 's talent to a human version of [ORG Google  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] also has an aptitude for creative problem-solving , such as his efforts in 2005 - as Deputy Foreign Minister - to ensure that a scheduled speech by [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [PER Hugo Chavez  ] in [LOC Salamanca  ] , [LOC Spain  ] did not upstage a cross-town meeting of the [ORG Summit of the Americas  ] . 
[PER Leon  ] has been displeased with recent press reports touting his growing influence with [ORG Zapatero  ] at the expense of [ORG Fernandez de la Vega  ] or [ORG Moratinos  ] . 
The Ambassador suggests [PER Leon  ] 's ego is fed by what he accomplishes rather than by what people tell him or write about him . 
[PER Leon  ] has a passion for his work and interlocutors will find him very well informed on [LOC Latin America  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] , and [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The Ambassador cites [PER Zapatero  ] 's recruitment of [PER Leon  ] to the Office of the Presidency as the result of a rare instance in which foreign policy unfavorably impacted [PER Zapatero  ] domestically . 
[PER Zapatero  ] decided to shuffle his foreign policy advisers when the blowback from unflattering [LOC MADRID  ] 00000071 004 OF 006 media coverage of [PER Zapatero  ] at the [ORG NATO  ] Summit in [LOC Bucharest  ] impacted his standing at home . 
( See REFTEL B ) . 
III ) [PER Milagros Hernando  ] , President of the [ORG International Department of the Office  ] of the President <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Known as [PER Mila  ] , career diplomat [PER Hernando  ] acts as chief of staff to [PER Leon  ] , to whom she owes her job . 
Her geographic expertise is [LOC Europe  ] - [PER Leon  ] 's weakest area - which makes them a [ORG Yin & Yang  ] team that complement each other . 
Their relationship is based on mutual trust . 
There is no daylight between them on policy issues . 
[PER Hernando  ] 's role is for [PER Leon  ] 's aggrandizement ; she will protect him and will not take credit behind his back . 
With [PER Leon  ] as busy as he is , [PER Hernando  ] is more accessible to [ORG USG  ] interlocutors . 
IV ) Gen. [PER Felix Sanz  ] , High Representative for the [MISC Spanish  ] Presidency of the [ORG EU  ] on [ORG Defense Issues  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) On defense issues , [PER Sanz  ] , the Chief of the [ORG Defense Staff  ] ( [ORG CHOD  ] ) during 2004-08 , might prove an alternate channel to [PER Zapatero  ] . 
[PER Sanz  ] has very positive views of the [LOC United States  ] , despite knowing that in 2008 the [ORG USG  ] did not vote for him to be the next Chairman of the [ORG Military Committee  ] at [ORG NATO  ] . 
He is not bitter about the incident , but knows he owes the [ORG USG  ] no favors for it. //Zapatero 's Inner Circle// <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zapatero  ] keeps his own counsel and rarely asks for his subordinates' input on key issues . 
As his confidence has grown while he has been in office , he is doing so less frequently and will do so only with a select inner circle of three additional advisers besides [PER Leon  ] . 
The Ambassador suggests that [PER Zapatero  ] 's thinking is that he does not need the advice of others and/or they are not useful to his decision-making process , so he does not reach out for their views . 
I ) [PER Jose  ] " Pepe " [PER Blanco  ] , Vice Secretary General in [PER Zapatero  ] , s [ORG Spanish Socialist Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zapatero  ] consults [PER Blanco  ] , the #2 official in the [ORG PSOE  ] , on political issues . 
The Ambassador describes [PER Blanco  ] as a very important element in the equation for maintaining strong bilateral relations . 
Contact with him must be maintained to continue providing messages to [PER Zapatero  ] . 
However , [PER Blanco  ] leaves a bad taste in the mouth of some past [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors , whom he strikes as particularly untrustworthy . 
[PER Blanco  ] has an unfailing idiosyncrasy of never looking interlocutors in the eye when he shakes hands . 
Furthermore , he has a reputation for being especially ruthless on political issues , which he appears to relish. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) [PER Blanco  ] and [PER Jesus Caldera  ] , the [ORG PSOE  ] 's Secretary for Ideas and Projects , will travel to [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] in mid-February to attend a conference on the " historical change " in the [LOC United States  ] that the new President represents . 
II ) [PER Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  ] , Minister of Interior <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zapatero  ] also consults [PER Rubalcaba  ] , who tops the Ambassador 's list of the most impressive [ORG GOS  ] officials . 
The Ambassador suggested that [PER Rubalcaba  ] sees himself as the smartest person in Cabinet but conveys no hubris . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] is smart enough to know that he needs the [ORG USG  ] on counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) issues and therefore he has been cooperative with [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors on that topic . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] excels out putting out fires , but also fully understands the extent of the lack of inter-agency cooperation in his Ministry between the [MISC Spanish National Police  ] and the [ORG Civil Guard  ] . 
The Ambassador suggests [PER Zapatero  ] is consulting with [PER Rubalcaba  ] for ideas on who should succeed intelligence director [PER Alberto Saiz  ] , whose five-year mandate expires in April , but the Ambassador also places the odds at better than even that [PER Zapatero  ] renews [PER Saiz  ] 's mandate since it is the path [LOC MADRID  ] 00000071 005 OF 006 of least resistance. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Rubalcaba  ] is feeling the weight of power and is looking for an opportunity to leave his Ministry and possibly the [ORG GOS  ] , suggests the Ambassador . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] - whose wife reportedly wants him to step down - takes the deaths of [MISC Spaniards  ] to heart , whether at the hands of [ORG ETA  ] terrorists , traffic deaths on the highways or criminal violence . 
It is starting to wear on him , and he has suggested he is no longer at his peak performance . 
He told the Ambassador he intended to step down in early 2008 at the end of the first [PER Zapatero  ] government , but he miscalculated and informed [PER Zapatero  ] too late in the latter 's planning process . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] is extremely loyal to [PER Zapatero  ] , who understands that he needs [PER Rubalcaba  ] and will make it difficult for him to step down . 
The Ambassador recommends that [PER Rubalcaba  ] - who is very accessible to the Embassy despite his busy schedule - remains a contact that the [ORG USG  ] cultivates , whether he remains in his current post or not . 
He will continue to be an important player in [MISC Spanish  ] politics in either case . 
III ) [PER Jose Antonio Alonso  ] , [ORG PSOE  ] Spokesman in the [ORG Congress  ] of Deputies <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) According to the Ambassador , [PER Zapatero  ] also consults [PER Alonso  ] , a judge and childhood friend whom [PER Zapatero  ] recruited to be his Minister of Interior ( 2004-6 ) and later his Minister of Defense ( 2006-08 ) in his first government , before asking him to assume his current post . 
The two are close and [PER Alonso  ] is keenly loyal to [ORG Zapatero.  ] //Three Other Key [ORG GOS  ] Personalities in the Bilateral Relationship// <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Foreign Minister [ORG Moratinos  ] is not the most impressive member of cabinet , but he is an honest broker who should be taken seriously . 
He is well meaning albeit egotistical , according to the Ambassador . 
The Foreign Minister belongs to a second , outer ring of [PER Zapatero  ] advisers . 
His allegiance is to [LOC Spain  ] - rather than to [PER Zapatero  ] or even to his own career advancement - and he is idealistically motivated to " do the right thing . 
" The Ambassador discounts speculation , which has existed since before the Ambassador arrived , that [PER Zapatero  ] will shuffle [ORG Moratinos  ] out of his current post any time soon . 
The Ambassador believes that [ORG Moratinos  ] suits the bill well enough for [PER Zapatero  ] 's purposes . 
The Ambassador knows of no ill-will or jealousy on the part of [ORG Moratinos  ] for [PER Leon  ] 's growing influence with [ORG Zapatero.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In meetings , [ORG Moratinos  ] often tries to overpower or bully his interlocutors in an attempt to establish a superior negotiating position . 
It is fairly well known in [LOC Madrid  ] among the [LOC Ambassadorial  ] corps that [ORG Moratinos  ] is given to screaming at foreign Ambassadors and chastising them at the first opportunity to put them in their place . 
It is a tactic that has caused many Ambassadors to leave with their tail between their legs . 
The Ambassador recommends that his successor and other senior-level [ORG USG  ] interlocutors stand their ground against [ORG Moratinos  ] and force him to deal with them on an even level . 
Once this happens , the relationship will likely prove far more harmonious . 
Meanwhile , [ORG Moratinos  ] had a very healthy professional admiration for former Secretary of State Rice , whose attention he craved and whose approval he sought. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Carme Chacon  ] is smart and has gained enough respect to be effective as Defense Minister . 
She has also been a real asset to [PER Zapatero  ] in the way she has handled the portfolio in the public eye . 
However , she is immature in a political sense , according to the Ambassador . 
She is too focused on the little things - such as the lack of parity in the bilateral defense relationship or by implying that she needs to be treated with more deference - and is not focused on larger issues like weapons systems . 
She does not have a huge ego , but she is wearing the [MISC Spanish  ] ego . 
The Ambassador says the [ORG USG  ] will not be able to change her , so it will need [LOC MADRID  ] 00000071 006 OF 006 to adapt and work with her . 
She is still developing her political senses and will be an important player in [MISC Spanish  ] politics for years to come . 
The Ambassador predicted that she will grow in her job and recommends future [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors treat her with an eye to the future . 
The Ambassador also remarked that [PER Chacon  ] is finding that all of the media attention she has received since she became Defense Minister can be a double-edged sword . 
Early favorable coverage ( when she inspected the troops while pregnant ) has lately given way to more negative , if irrelevant reports ( as when she wore a controversial smoking jacket to a military parade ) . <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) Finally , the Ambassador identified his [MISC Spanish  ] counterpart in [LOC Washington  ] , Ambassador [PER Jorge Dezcallar  ] ( also discussed in Paragraph 5 above ) as an important contact for the new Administration to cultivate in the bilateral relationship , predicting that [PER Dezcallar  ] will be a linchpin in the bilateral relationship in the year ahead . 
The Ambassador also suggests that [PER Dezcallar  ] would likely respond well to increased social interaction with [ORG USG  ] officials .
