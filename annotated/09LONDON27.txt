[LOC LONDON  ] DAILY REPORT 7-28-08 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Counselor [PER Rick Mills  ] , Jr. for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Per reftel , this cable provides information on the demographics of the [MISC Muslim  ] community in the [LOC UK  ] . 
The last official [LOC UK  ] census was in 2001 and much of what is provided below is a combination of census figures and subsequent estimates and surveys . 
Post notes that the information is incomplete and in many cases several years old . 
This is , however , the most current and accurate information available . 
Among the findings are that the [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslim  ] population has jumped in seven years from 1.6 million to 2 million . 
At that rate of increase , HMG estimates that the [MISC Muslim  ] population of the [LOC UK  ] at the next census in 2011 will be over 2.2 million . 
End Summary . 
Overall [MISC Muslim Population Growing But Rate  ] Slowing --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The 2001 [LOC UK  ] census showed a population of 1.6 million [MISC Muslims  ] . 
In April 2008 , the Home Secretary [PER Jacqui Smith  ] announced that HMG estimated the [MISC Muslim  ] population at 2 million or 3.3% of the [LOC UK  ] population . 
This represented an increase of 400,000 in seven years . 
The 1951 census showed a population of [MISC Muslims  ] of less than 22,000 . 
Therefore between 1951 and 2001 ( 50 years ) there had been an annualized increase of 31,500 [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC UK  ] , but in the seven year period between 2001 and 2008 there was an actual annualized increase of 57,000 . 
The rate of increase as measured by decades has slowed , however . 
In 1961 , the population of [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC UK  ] was 2.5 times what it had been in 1951 . 
Between 1961 and 1971 the [MISC Muslim  ] population multiplied an astonishing 5 times its previous population . 
Thereafter the [MISC Muslim  ] population 's rate of growth began to slow . 
In 1981 it was only 2.4 times the 1971 population ( this was attributed to the ending of unlimited [ORG Commonwealth  ] immigration in the early 1970 's ) . 
In 1991 it was only 1.7 times what it had been in 1981 ; and between 1991 and 2001 it only grew by 1.6 times the previous population . 
Based on a projected 2011 population of 2.2 million , the rate of increase between 2001 and 2011 is estimated to be 1.4 times the 2001 figure . 
In overall numbers , the [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslim  ] population is rapidly increasing , but its rate of growth is slowly decreasing . 
Changes to [LOC UK  ] visa rules announced in 2008 may slow this rate even more . 
Immigration Or Birthrate ? ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) HMG does not categorize either births or immigration by religion . 
A rough estimate , however , based on immigration statistics by country of origin indicates 50-55,000 " self declared " [MISC Muslims  ] were granted settlement ( permanent residence ) in the [LOC UK  ] in 2007 . 
Based on the aforementioned 57,000 annualized growth in the [MISC Muslim  ] population , it is clear that a significant portion of the population growth among [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC UK  ] is based on immigration . 
34% of [MISC Muslims  ] in 2001 were below the age of 16 , however , and 63% of [MISC Muslim  ] households had at least one child and 25% contained 3 or more children . 
Based on these statistics a report by the [ORG NGO Migration Watch UK  ] ( [ORG MWUK  ] ) , which favors restrictions on immigration , estimated in 2008 that the real number of [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC UK  ] was closer to 3 million which would be 5% of the [LOC UK  ] population .

Raw [ORG Data: Post  ] 's 2008 [ORG Religious Freedom Report  ] and [ORG NGOs  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The following are excerpted from [ORG Post  ] 's [ORG International Religious Freedom Report  ] ( [ORG IRFR  ] ) and reports or studies from various [MISC Muslim  ] and migration/immigration NGO 's .

Among other things , the 2008 report noted that while 43 million [LOC UK  ] residents claimed to be [MISC Christians  ] , less than 3 million ( 7% ) regularly worship in churches . 
End Comment ) . 
-- The [ORG Crown Prosecution Service  ] ( CPS ) reported a decrease in prosecutions over the previous reporting period for religiously-motivated incidents , with only 29 cases classified as religiously-aggravated offenses . 
Of the 23 cases in which the victim 's religious affiliation is known , 17 were [MISC Muslim  ] . 
-- In 2006 , controversy arose after 100 [MISC Islamic  ] private schools turned out to be " little more than places where the [MISC Koran  ] is recited , " the schools promised to upgrade their instruction and they are due for review in 2010 . 
-- According to a poll of 600 [MISC Muslim  ] and 800 non-Muslim students at thirty universities throughout the [LOC UK  ] conducted by the Centre for [MISC Social Cohesion  ] ( [ORG CSC  ] ) , as reported ref B , 32 percent of [MISC Muslims  ] on [LOC UK  ] campuses believe killing in the name of religion is justified , 54 percent wanted a [ORG Muslim Party  ] to represent their world view in Parliament , and 40 percent want [MISC Muslims  ] in the [LOC UK  ] to be under [ORG Sharia  ] law .

73 percent of [MISC Muslim  ] students are at least occasional participants in Friday services while only 2 percent of non-Muslim students attend any religious service . 
The poll results also found that 73 percent of [MISC Muslim  ] students believe it is possible to be both [MISC Muslim  ] and [MISC British  ] and a similar number believe their parents are " much more or somewhat more " strict [MISC Muslims  ] than they are . 
In addition only six percent believed that people who leave [MISC Islam  ] for another religion should be " punished according to [ORG Sharia  ] law " ( killed ) . 
-- According to [ORG MWUK  ] , arranged marriages in the [MISC Muslim  ] community are creating unusually large population growth in areas where [MISC Muslims  ] predominate , since first-generation families tend to have larger numbers of children ( based on published research and a comparison of the 1991 and 2001 census ) . 
For example , in the eighties the [ORG Bradford  ] ( city ) Council estimated that the [MISC Muslim  ] population would reach 130,000 by 2030 and then level off . 
Now the projection is for 130,000 by 2020 and rising .

[ORG MWUK  ] claims the majority of members of these communities seek spouses from overseas in arranged marriages . 
[ORG MWUK  ] claims these figures point to a much larger [MISC Muslim  ] population than HMG is reporting and is projecting . 
HMG says arranged marriages with [MISC South Asian  ] partners , " are a normal facet of settlement figures .
