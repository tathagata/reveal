( C ) SUMMARY: At midnight , December 31st , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC F-X  ] jet fighter competition will come to an end . 
Ultimately , a decision on the costly program proved to be politically untenable for the [PER Lula  ] administration . 
Given all the urgent requirements of [LOC Brazil  ] 's armed forces , the [MISC F-X  ] was an expense that was hard to justify . 
Competitors for the [MISC F-X  ] are refusing to go down quietly , but they are fighting a losing battle . 
With the end of the [MISC F-X  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] may review whether to purchase less costly used aircraft . 
In this regard , the [ORG Lockheed Martin F-16  ] would have the inside track . 
However , it is possible that the [ORG GOB  ] may base a decision on used [MISC F-16s  ] in the context of its continued questions about the [LOC U.S.  ] as a reliable supplier . 
End Summary The [MISC F-X  ] Program , [ORG RIP  ] -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On December 31 , the [ORG Best and Final Offers  ] ( [MISC BOFAs  ] ) for the competition to select [LOC Brazil  ] 's new generation high performance jet fighter ( [MISC F-X  ] ) will expire . 
Despite repeated [ORG GOB  ] postponements during the past 12 months on a decision , the [MISC F-X  ] program had still retained a breath of life thanks to repeated hints from former Defense Minister [PER Viegas  ] that a [MISC F-X  ] award decision would be forthcoming . 
Throughout the process , however , the [PER Lula  ] administration was reluctant to commit to a choice . 
With the end of the validity of the [MISC BOFAs  ] next week , the [MISC F-X  ] program will be officially dead. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The principal cause of the program 's demise , most observers agree , was the [MISC F-X  ] program 's steep price tag , around $700 million plus for the purchase of a dozen high performance aircraft . 
The huge cost , at a time when the [PER Lula  ] administration was engaged in fiscal austerity , made the program a politically impossible sell . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] , which still has not concluded the 2005 budget , has not included jet fighters in its budget , and , in fact , provides very little money overall for defense . 
End Note . 
) Yet , until November , more than a few senior [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] ( [ORG FAB  ] ) officers held out hope that [ORG FAB  ] would get its new jets . 
When [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] departed [LOC Brazil  ] last month without a deal in place for the [MISC Sukhoi SU-35  ] -- after offering to purchase 50 [ORG Embraer  ] commercial aircraft as a deal sweetener and certainly dangling a possible agreement on ending the [MISC Russian  ] embargo on [MISC Brazilian  ] beef -- the last best chance for new fighter aircraft for [ORG FAB  ] left with him ( reftel ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other factors contributed to the [MISC F-X  ] impasse . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] military 's almost insatiable need for weapons systems upgrade and procurement required that the [ORG GOB  ] triage the competing demands for funding . 
[ORG FAB  ] already had been granted approval for buying ten new Black Hawk helicopters ( about $153 million ) . 
With both the army and navy biting at [ORG FAB  ] 's heels for funding their own urgent requirements , the new jet fighters became a harder sell. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In view of the lack of any perceived threat , the strategic question of whether [LOC Brazil  ] needed the [MISC F-X  ] whose primary purpose was protection of the national capital , has received relatively little debate . 
The program itself ultimately owed its continued rationale less to the defense of [LOC Brasilia  ] than as a tool of national pride , particularly following [LOC Chile  ] 's purchase of [MISC F-16s  ] . 
Even some air force generals admit the principal current threat to [MISC Brazilian  ] sovereignty ( from narco-trafficers ) can be addressed less expensively by other air force elements such as [ORG FAB  ] 's [ORG Super Tucanos.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , [MISC F-X  ] competitors are refusing to go down without a fight . 
Planted news articles in praise of one aircraft or attacking another ( usually the [MISC F-16  ] , and the alleged , and false , denial by the [ORG USG  ] to provide AAMRAM capability to [LOC Brazil  ] ) continue to pop up . 
The most recent example of [MISC F-X  ] muckraking is a cover story this week in left-leaning nationalist magazine [ORG Carta Capital  ] in praise of the Mirage 2000 of the [MISC Embraer-Dassault  ] consortium . 
In the [ORG Carta Capital  ] article , [ORG Embraer  ] President [PER Mauricio Botelho  ] , in a direct swipe at [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] , is quoted as saying that because the [ORG USG  ] won't allow it , [LOC U.S.  ] companies offer " no chance " for transfer of military-related technology -- a bizarre comment in the wake of the winning [LOC Embraer--Lockheed-Martin  ] bid for the development of the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Army  ] 's [ORG Aerial Common Sensor System  ] aircraft . 
Even [LOC Sweden  ] 's [MISC Grippen  ] aircraft has received high profile lobbying with a prominent billboard at the entrance to [LOC Brasilia  ] airport . 
Used Aircraft ? -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Throughout much of the long-running [MISC F-X  ] competition -- while [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] 's [MISC F-16  ] was one of the competitors -- the [LOC U.S.  ] company had urged the [ORG GOB  ] consider the purchase of used [MISC F-16s  ] as a significantly less costly option to the [MISC F-X  ] . 
Although an attempt by [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] in early 2003 to ally with [ORG Varig Engineering and Maintenance  ] ( [ORG VEM  ] ) for a proposed upgrade of used [MISC F-16s  ] fell through , the company remains upbeat it will be able to partner with a [MISC Brazilian  ] firm ( possibly [ORG Embraer  ] ) to craft an attractive used aircraft offer . 
Ultimately , [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] believes it can provide fully capable [MISC F-16  ] aircraft at less than half the cost of the [MISC F-X  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] One driving factor , however , will be the ability of [ORG FAB  ] to conduct inter-operable aerial refueling for any fighter . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is considering purchasing two or three [MISC KC-135s  ] to augment their refueling capability . 
Procurement of [MISC KC-135s  ] from the [LOC U.S.  ] would be a positive indicator for purchase of used [MISC F-16s  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recognition that new aircraft will be unobtainable , senior [ORG FAB  ] leadership , including [ORG FAB  ] 's probable next Commander in Chief , increasingly have come around to accepting used [MISC F-16s  ] as [LOC Brazil  ] 's best aircraft option . 
In this context , the [MISC F-16  ] appears to have the inside track over other used aircraft options , although there are rumors that some in [ORG FAB  ] may be looking at procuring used [MISC South African  ] Cheetahs , a modified Mirage III aircraft one generation older than the early [MISC F-16  ] models . 
Meanwhile , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] which has been absent from the [MISC F-X  ] debate , may get into the picture . 
In a discussion with emboffs , a prominent Deputy on the [ORG National Defense Committee  ] stated he intended to hold hearings in 2005 on used fighter aircraft with an eye to promoting the [MISC F-16  ] as [LOC Brazil  ] 's best option. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: We expect that [LOC Brazil  ] will continue to seek the aquisition of high performance jet fighters for reasons of national pride , if nothing else . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Mission [LOC Brazil  ] will continue to support the used [MISC F-16  ] option as the most logical way forward both tactically and economically . 
An increasing number of [ORG FAB  ] generals appear to support this view . 
However , even though [LOC Brazil  ] has moved forward on the purchase of other weapons systems , we suspect the [ORG GOB  ] may not agree to purchase the [MISC F-16  ] unless it achieves an adequate comfort level on all aspects of the bilateral pol-mil relationship . 
As [LOC Brazil  ] observes the bite that [ORG ASPA  ] is taking on countries that do not sign Article 98 agreements , it questions about the reliability of the [LOC U.S.  ] as a supplier/strategic partner will continue , thus further complicating the used [MISC F-16  ] aquisition option .
