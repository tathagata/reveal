CLASSIFIED BY EUR/FO ? 
[PER IAN KELLY  ] , REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
Embassy [LOC Moscow  ] , please see paragraph 8 . 
BACKGROUND <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Over the past four years the [ORG USG  ] has raised its concerns with the Government of [LOC Russia  ] ( [ORG GOR  ] ) about the Government of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ( GOV ) possible acquisition of [ORG MANPADS  ] and other conventional weapons . 
In particular , we have highlighted the risk these could be diverted to the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) or other regional terrorists and non- state actors. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Igla-S  ] ( [MISC SA-24  ] ) is [LOC Russia  ] 's most advanced [ORG MANPADS  ] and considered one of the most lethal portable air defense systems ever made ( Ref A ) . 
Currently , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's tactical air defense inventory consists of 1970s-era [MISC Swedish  ] ( [MISC RBS-70  ] ) and 1980s-era [MISC French  ] systems ( [PER Mistral  ] ) , which are both crew-served systems . 
If the [MISC SA-24  ] transfer occurs , it would be [LOC Venezuela  ] 's first man-portable air defense weapon . 
The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Russia  ] have been very involved in efforts to prevent the proliferation of [ORG MANPADS  ] and strengthen controls over their export . 
Of particular concern is preventing the transfer of such systems into regions known to foster unreliable end-users . 
We are concerned with [LOC Venezuela  ] ? s ability to properly secure and safeguard small arms and light weapons ( SA/LW ) . 
We see no indication that [LOC Venezuela  ] is prepared to implement adequate physical security and stockpile management practices for such systems consistent with international standards. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) In 2005 , we reiterated [LOC U.S.  ] concerns regarding arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] during a meeting with [PER Anatoliy Antonov  ] , MFA Director for Disarmament and [ORG Security Affairs  ] ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Antonov  ] said that he and [ORG his Department  ] 's experts had carefully considered the points we had presented and had shared them with [MISC Russian  ] services . 
[PER Antonov  ] stressed that there was no international restriction on selling arms , including [ORG MANPADS  ] , to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] recognized the [LOC U.S.  ] as a competitor in the international arms trade , with the motivation of restricting [LOC Russia  ] 's market access . 
[PER Antonov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] respected the [LOC U.S.  ] right to determine [LOC U.S.  ] policy on arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] , but added , " that is your decision , not ours ; we have our own policy . 
" During the [ORG U.S.-Russia MANPADS Arrangement Expert Meeting  ] in 2006 , when we raised this issue with regard to [LOC Venezuela  ] , the [ORG GOR  ] offered no assurances that it would not sell [MISC Igla-S  ] to the GOV . 
However , it was suggested that , if a transfer occurred , the system would likely be vehicle-mounted. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) On November 19 , 2008 the [MISC Russian  ] News & [ORG Information Agency Novosti  ] ( [ORG RIA Novosti  ] ) reported that [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] signed a major contract for the sale of [MISC Igla-S MANPADS  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The media report also revealed that a manager of [ORG LOMO  ] , a partner company in the production of [MISC Igla-S  ] , stated that this implied the contract for the delivery of several hundred [MISC Igla-S  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
Copy of this media report can be found at http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20081119/118406776 - print.html. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) At the end of January we received reports that the GOV deployed ten [MISC Venezuelan  ] specialists to [LOC Kolomna  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , to begin training on the [MISC Igla-S MANPADS  ] . 
Reporting indicates that five of the ten specialists are to take part in [MISC Igla-S  ] equipment acceptance inspections , sometime in the last ten days of February 2009 . 
OBJECTIVES <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Post is requested to engage in a discussion on the types of weapons systems [LOC Russia  ] is selling to [LOC Venezuela  ] , and request details on procedures [LOC Russia  ] believes [LOC Venezuela  ] has in place to safely secure and safeguard these weapons systems , to better inform the new Administration as it prepares to engage [LOC Russia  ] further on its concerns about this transaction . 
If the [MISC Russian  ] Government acknowledges the transfer is imminent , Post should request the [ORG GOR  ] to suspend the shipment until the [LOC United States  ] and [MISC Russian  ] Governments can discuss the matter more substantively at the appropropriate level . 
ACTION REQUEST <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Post is requested to approach appropriate host government officials to discuss the potential transfer of [MISC Igla-S  ] missile systems to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Post may draw upon the following points: ( S/REL to [LOC RUSSIA  ] ) Begin Talking Points -- The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] have committed to enhancing the control of [ORG MANPADS  ] to prevent their acquisition and use by non-state actors and the proliferation to countries that do not have strong export control and stockpile management procedures . 
-- In this context , we would like to discuss with you the reports indicating [LOC Russia  ] may sell the [MISC Igla-S  ] system to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
-- We have recently seen press reports indicating that [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] has signed a contract with the [MISC St. Petersburg-based Leningrad Optical-Mechanical Association  ] ( [ORG LOMO  ] ) for the sale of [MISC Igla-S MANPADS  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
-- As we have previously discussed , our governments have a shared concern about [ORG FARC  ] 's activities , including the acquisition of lethal military items . 
-- We understand there are no international restrictions on selling arms , including [ORG MANPADS  ] , to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
-- However , we have worked together to lead efforts multilaterally to control [ORG MANPADS  ] because of their appeal to terrorists and insurgents and their threat to civilian aircraft . 
-- Most recently , we reached agreement in the [ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] to tighten our national controls , particularly toward end-users who are unable to protect against theft , loss , misuse , or diversion . 
-- This is the basis of serious [LOC U.S.  ] concern in this possible transaction , as [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ties to the [ORG FARC  ] represent a serious proliferation/diversion risk . 
-- We appreciate the frank and useful exchanges we have had on [MISC Latin America  ] during [ORG WHA A/S  ] [PER Thomas Shannon  ] 's visit to [LOC Moscow  ] and our continuing cooperation on non-proliferation and counterterrorism . 
-- In previous discussions on this issue , [LOC Russia  ] has advised that it has stringent end-use requirements ( consistent with the [ORG Wassenaar  ] guidelines ) for such sales and requested more specific information on why the [LOC U.S.  ] views this possible transaction as a risk . 
[PER A/S Shannon  ] advised in his meeting that information gleaned from [ORG FARC  ] hard-drives obtained by the [MISC Colombian  ] government in March 2008 indicate [MISC Venezuelan  ] government officials have tried to facilitate black and gray arms market deals for the [ORG FARC  ] . 
This information was widely disseminated in major mainstream international media outlets . 
-- More specifically , information on the hard-drives indicated specific discussions between the Government of [LOC Venezuela  ] and [ORG FARC  ] on the provision of [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
This highlights the basis of [LOC U.S.  ] concerns . 
-- In September 2008 , the [ORG U.S. Department of Treasury 's Office of Foreign Assets Control  ] ( [ORG OFAC  ] ) designated two senior [MISC Venezuelan  ] government officials , [PER Hugo Carvajal Barrios  ] and [PER Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva  ] , and one former official , [PER Ramon Rodriguez Chacin  ] , for materially assisting the narcotics trafficking activities of the [ORG FARC  ] . 
This action was taken under the [MISC Kingpin Act  ] . 
[PER Carvajal  ] is the director of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's military intelligence [ORG DIM  ] ) ; [PER Rangel Silva  ] is the head of civilian intelligence ( [ORG DISIP  ] ) . 
[PER Chacin  ] is the former interior and justice minister . 
He resigned September 8 , 2008 . 
( For more information , go to www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/hp1132.htm on Opennet ) -- In light of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's relationship with the [ORG FARC  ] , corruption within the [MISC Venezuelan  ] military , and our assessment that [LOC Venezuela  ] 's stockpile and security management practices do not meet international standards , we are concerned there is a significant risk that these weapons could be diverted to the [ORG FARC  ] . 
We also do not rule out the possibility that the transfer of the [MISC IGLA-S  ] weapon system could displace and make available existing weapon systems for [ORG FARC  ] ? s use . 
-- Further , we fear that should these sophisticated systems fall into the hands of the [ORG FARC  ] , they could possibly be sold or traded to drug organizations , including those in [LOC Mexico  ] , which are actively seeking to acquire powerful and highly sophisticated weapons for use against government forces . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] is particularly concerned about this possibility because [ORG FARC  ] 's acquisition of [ORG MANPADS  ] would constitute a new capability for the group to undermine peace and security in the region as well as threaten counter-narcotics operations in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
-- Given these serious risks , we have serious concerns about this transaction going forward . 
If this shipment is to be transferred imminently , we respectfully ask that your government suspend delivery of these sophisticated weapons so we may have a more substantive discussion . 
The [LOC United States  ] also would welcome more details on the steps you have planned to take or assurances that you could share with us regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] 's procedures to safely secure and protect these types of weapons systems in order to prevent their proliferation or theft . 
End Talking [LOC Points.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .
