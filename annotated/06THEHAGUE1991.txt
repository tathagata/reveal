End summary . 
Meeting with [LOC FM Bot  ] ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Nuland  ] broadly covered [LOC U.S.  ] goals for the [LOC Riga  ] summit with [LOC FM Bot  ] . 
She said the USG views [LOC Riga  ] as an opportunity to make the case for a global , open [ORG NATO  ] for the 21st century while demonstrably closing the doors on the [ORG NATO  ] of the [MISC Cold War  ] past . 
She argued that [ORG NATO  ] 's role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would determine the strategic backdrop for the summit , and commended the [MISC Dutch  ] for their deployment to [LOC Uruzgan  ] and ink splot strategy linking population centers in the province by development and infrastructure projects . 
On the day of the [ORG Heads' Meeting  ] , the quality of discussion at the summit dinner would be determinative in terms of [ORG Heads'  ] attitudes toward [ORG NATO  ] ; this requires working closely with [ORG NATO  ] SYG de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] to script and set the tone for dinner. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] was very supportive of ensuring a meaningful dinner dialogue . 
Alluding to countervailing forces at [ORG NATO  ] , he said he would encourage his [MISC French  ] colleague at the upcoming [ORG EU  ] Foreign Ministers meeting to be more constructive . 
He described the [MISC French  ] position -- strengthen the [ORG EU  ] , weaken [ORG NATO  ] -- as consistent in recent years . 
[PER Nuland  ] said [MISC European  ] nations should push [MISC French  ] President [PER Chirac  ] ; too much [LOC U.S  ] pressure could be counterproductive . 
[PER Bot  ] offered GONL assistance in that regard. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On enlargement , [PER Bot  ] said events in [LOC Ukraine  ] suggest its membership aspirations are moving in the wrong direction . 
[PER Nuland  ] noted that [ORG NATO  ] 's open door policy requires candidate countries to want membership , which was not exactly clear in [LOC Ukraine  ] at the moment . 
This does not mean , however , that [ORG NATO  ] should give up on [LOC Ukraine  ] -- [LOC Russia  ] was working behind the scenes to foil closer [ORG NATO-Ukraine  ] ties , she said ; [PER Bot  ] concurred. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the global partnership initiative , Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] stressed the need to come as close to a consensus as possible at the foreign ministerial in [LOC New York  ] . 
She anticipated [MISC French  ] opposition , but that should not prevent all other [MISC Allies  ] from sending a strong signal . 
[PER Bot  ] supported the initiative , but had some reservations regarding the use of the word global . 
Noting problems with [ORG EU  ] expansion , he cautioned that [ORG NATO  ] could be weakened by growing too quickly . 
[PER Nuland  ] stressed that the initiative was not looking to create a 26 100 structure with countries around the world , but rather strong 26 1 ties with more countries , and then mixing and matching in a 26 N format based on commitment to common action . 
Meeting with [MISC Dutch  ] Interagency ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Nuland  ] had more in-depth consultations with members of the [MISC Dutch  ] interagency , including MFA Director General for Political Affairs [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] , MOD Director for General Policy Affairs [PER Lo Casteleijn  ] , [ORG Dutch Permanent Representative  ] to [ORG NATO  ] [PER Herman Schaper  ] , Principal Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister [PER Karel Oosterom  ] , and MOD Chief of Operations Gen. [PER Eikelboom.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER De Gooijer  ] described current Allied positions in [LOC Brussels  ] as obstructionist , potentially leading to a negative summit in [LOC Riga  ] . 
A more optimistic Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] said the summit presents an opportunity for [ORG NATO  ] to demonstrate that it had taken on global responsibilities , capabilities , and partners . 
She outlined three make or break objectives: 1 ) progress in [LOC Afghanistan  ] by the summit ; 2 ) constructive and meaningful dialogue during the summit heads of state dinner ; and 3 ) an alliance strong , open , and flexible enough to work with current and new partners through the global partnership initiative. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Casteleijn  ] identified three urgent priorities: 1 ) force generation issues , as illustrated by [ORG SACEUR  ] 's request for an additional battalion ; 2 ) the transition to [ORG ISAF  ] IV ; and 3 ) improving [ORG ISAF  ] security and reconstruction integration . 
[PER Nuland  ] noted [MISC French  ] intransigence with regard to using the [ORG Strategic Reserve Force  ] or the [ORG NATO Response Force  ] ( [ORG NRF  ] ) should the alliance fail to generate an additional battalion . 
She suggested the seven [MISC Allies  ] contributing in the south pressure those not contributing , and push the [MISC French  ] hard at the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( [ORG NAC  ] ) . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] cautioned against a showdown ; instead , [MISC Allies  ] should appeal to [LOC France  ] 's political responsibilities -- it needs to be a victory for [PER Chirac  ] , he said . 
Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] agreed to work together closely to turn the [MISC French  ] around. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER De Gooijer  ] expressed frustration with [PER Karzai  ] ; Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] commended the [MISC Dutch  ] for holding [PER Karzai  ] 's feet to the fire on changing the [LOC Uruzgan  ] governor before they deploy , noting that sometimes [PER Karzai  ] needs this kind of pressure to focus . 
She also complimented the well-balanced [MISC Dutch  ] ink splot strategy , and described the [MISC Dutch  ] approach with the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] and Police as a model for other [MISC Allies  ] to follow . 
Longer term , she suggested the Alliance think about re-balancing the reconstruction work load. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER De Gooijer  ] agreed the Alliance must demonstrate real progress in [LOC Afghanistan  ] prior to the summit , including the integration of security and reconstruction efforts . 
He stressed the need to learn from the situation on the ground , and to present these lessons to the public in order to temper expectations . 
Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] concurred , noting that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is a long-term effort for [ORG NATO  ] . 
She recommended [ORG NATO  ] senior civilian representative [PER Dan Everts  ] organize an Allied ambassadorial group in [LOC Kabul.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER De Gooijer  ] agreed that the heads of state dinner needed to be a constructive , meeting of the minds with a sense of commonality and purpose . 
This requires choreography -- any participant could potentially ruin the dinner by saying the wrong thing during opening statements , he said . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] offered [MISC Dutch  ] assistance in working with other [MISC Allies  ] and [ORG NATO  ] SYG de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] to ensure the dinner is scripted . 
That said , [PER de Gooijer  ] suggested the conversation also address where [ORG NATO  ] is heading in upcoming summits . 
Going global might initiate a fight among [MISC Allies  ] -- better to explain how [ORG NATO  ] is a global organization rather than stating it explicitly , he said. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On the global partnership initiative , [PER Nuland  ] pointed to the importance of getting as close as possible to consensus on a general framework for the initiative at the [LOC New York  ] foreign ministerial . 
The initiative should make available a single-box of tools from which partners can choose , and create flexibility for [MISC Allies  ] to meet with interested partners at a 26 N format based on themes . 
This will also help identify advanced partners and give them more , if they want it . 
Meeting with MOD ---------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting , Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] and [PER Casteleijn  ] assessed the current situation in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] said he would call his [MISC Norwegian  ] counterpart prior to the upcoming [ORG NATO  ] CHOD 's meeting to encourage a [MISC Norwegian  ] contribution in response to [ORG SACEUR  ] 's request for an additional battalion in the south . 
They also discussed the unlikelihood that [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] would support the use of the [ORG NRF  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] should [ORG NATO  ] fail to generate a battalion . 
Amb . 
[PER Schaper  ] repeated earlier points that the best strategy in gaining [MISC French  ] support should be to allow them to be the heroes , instead of jamming them publicly. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Casteleijn  ] inquired if it made sense for [ORG NATO  ] to pursue an approach similar to the [ORG USG  ] 's Commander Emergency Reconstruction Program ( [ORG CERP  ] ) . 
[PER Nuland  ] suggested the [ORG NATO  ] bureaucracy might make such an approach difficult , and added the [MISC Canadians  ] are already doing something similar to the [ORG CERP  ] while the [MISC Brits  ] are considering it . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] suggested the idea be discussed further at [ORG NATO  ] to better coordinate reconstruction efforts . 
[PER Nuland  ] said the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] should also be challenged to do more in terms of reconstruction efforts in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Moving on to [LOC Riga  ] , Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] referred to [ORG SACEUR  ] 's plea for more [ORG NRF  ] contributions -- especially logistics support -- to achieve full operational capability ( [ORG FOC  ] ) by October 1 . 
She stated the gaps in logistics was the main impediment to reaching [MISC FOC.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] thanked the [MISC Dutch  ] for their difficult decision during a caretaker government to purchase 500 hours for 2007 in the [ORG Strategic Airlift Initiative  ] ( [ORG SAI  ] ) . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] was optimistic that the [ORG GONL  ] will decide to purchase additional hours , but would have to wait until after the parliamentary elections in November . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] require more hours than they had initially signed up for . 
[PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Nuland  ] said post-Riga , the Alliance should look at common-funding for aspects of the initiative. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Schaper  ] and [PER Casteleijn  ] asked for [ORG USG  ] expectations regarding the [ORG NATO Special Operations Forces  ] ( [ORG SOF  ] ) initiative . 
[PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Nuland  ] suggested the Alliance begin with a coordination cell staffed with 40-60 personnel by a framework nation , and accompanied by 2-3 personnel by interested [MISC Allies  ] . 
She hoped the framework nation would be announced at the upcoming informal defense ministerial in [LOC Podoroz  ] , and said the coordination cell could be unveiled at [LOC Riga  ] . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] commended the [ORG SOF  ] model , noting situational awareness and training benefits . 
Meeting with [MISC Parliamentarians  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) During a lunch hosted by [PER Amb  ] . 
[LOC Arnall  ] , [PER Amb  ] . 
[LOC Nuland  ] and Amb . 
[PER Schaper  ] related their recent trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to [MISC Dutch  ] parliamentarians . 
In attendance were current and former party members of the collapsed coalition , as well as from the main opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) . 
[PER Nuland  ] commended the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to [LOC Uruzgan  ] , noting that she was very impressed by how the [MISC Dutch  ] have linked security and development efforts through their ink splot strategy . 
She praised [MISC Dutch  ] soldiers for their willingness to fight , and said Parliament should continue to support its troops. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) In a spirited discussion , parliamentarians posed a number of questions and comments , including plans for the transition from [ORG ISAF III  ] to IV , efforts to get [MISC Allies  ] not contributing in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to do more , [ORG SACEUR  ] 's call for more troops , the [ORG ISAF  ] detention policy , criticism of the [PER Karzai  ] government , the porous border with [LOC Pakistan  ] , poppy eradication efforts vs. alternatives , reconstruction efforts and the inability for NGOs to work in the region. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) [PER Nuland  ] acknowledged the fight against the [ORG Taliban  ] was difficult , as many of the enemy combatants killed thus far have been poor farmers while hard-line [ORG Taliban  ] operatives remain across the [LOC Pakistan  ] border . 
She argued that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is at a tipping point with the [MISC Afghan  ] people as to whether the [MISC Afghan  ] government can provide them security . 
She praised the [ORG GONL  ] 's strategy with [PER Karzai  ] , and pressed the [MISC Dutch  ] to push the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] to do more in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , especially with regard to reconstruction efforts. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) Amb . 
[PER Nuland  ] has cleared on this cable .
