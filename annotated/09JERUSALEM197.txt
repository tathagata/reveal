( C ) SUMMARY . 
[ORG Palestinian Authority Security Forces  ] ( [ORG PASF  ] ) chiefs report persistent [ORG IDF  ] operations in the [LOC West Bank  ] since the end of the conflict in [LOC Gaza  ] , including in [LOC Area A  ] and using more agressive tactics . 
[ORG PASF  ] officials expressed disappointment and frustration with the [ORG IDF  ] operations , given [ORG PASF  ] 's record in maintaining calm in the [LOC West Bank  ] during the conflict in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
In recent days , [ORG PASF  ] have arrested or detained over 50 [ORG Hamas  ] members in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
They also dispersed a [MISC Hamas-organized  ] rally organized in [LOC Hebron  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG IDF RAIDS  ] DISAPPOINT [ORG PASF  ] ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG PA  ] chief of [ORG Military Intelligence MG  ] Majed [PER Faraj  ] told [ORG POL FSN  ] January 27 that the [ORG PA  ] is concerned about recent [ORG IDF  ] security operations in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
He said repeated [ORG IDF  ] incursions , especially in [LOC Area A  ] , detract from [ORG PASF  ] performance and undermine the [ORG PA  ] . 
[ORG NSF West Bank Command  ] staffer [PER LtCol Mohammad Tillawi  ] told [ORG POL FSN  ] that the [ORG NSF  ] will continue its security work because [ORG NSF  ] Commander [PER MG Diab Abu Ali  ] ( [PER Abu Fatah  ] ) believes it is in [MISC Palestinian  ] interest and a prerequisite for peace . 
But , [PER Tillawi  ] said , continued [ORG IDF  ] activity in [MISC PA-controlled  ] areas systematically undermines this equation . 
He added that [ORG PASF  ] chiefs have urged PM [MISC Fayyad  ] and President [PER Abbas  ] to make restoration of [ORG PA  ] security control a priority. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) MG [PER Faraj  ] expressed particular concern about [ORG IDF  ] operations following the [ORG PA  ] 's " evident success " at minimizing friction between [MISC Palestinians  ] and the [ORG IDF  ] in the [LOC West Bank  ] as fighting went on in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
He recalled [ORG IDF  ] requests for assistance in containing Gaza-related demonstrations and preventing clashes in Areas B and C. [PER MG Faraj  ] and [ORG GI  ] sources said that , in response to [MISC Israeli  ] requests , [ORG PASF  ] arrested specific [ORG Hamas  ] figures in the [LOC West Bank  ] during the [LOC Gaza  ] conflict. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Given that [ORG PASF  ] acted on information provided by [ORG GOI  ] counterparts , [ORG IDF  ] operations in area A are not necessary , [PER Faraj  ] said . 
He called it " odd " that the [ORG IDF  ] asked for [ORG PASF  ] help to prevent clashes with the [ORG IDF  ] in Areas B and C , but then entered into area A to make arrests. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Faraj  ] raised several specific incidents of concern . 
In [LOC Husan  ] , near [LOC Bethlehem  ] , the [ORG IDF  ] commandeered the home of a [MISC Palestinian  ] civilian the night of January 26 and stayed well past sunrise the next day . 
The [ORG IDF  ] declared [LOC Husan  ] a closed military zone and arrested one [ORG Hamas  ] , one [ORG PFLP  ] , and twelve [ORG Fatah  ] activists . 
[PER Faraj  ] described those arrested as " stone-throwers " and said the [ORG IDF  ] could have asked the [ORG PASF  ] to deal with them . 
On January 26 the [ORG IDF  ] sent more than 30 patrols into [LOC Silwad  ] , near [LOC Ramallah  ] , and imposed a curfew , he added . 
[ORG PA  ] PRESSES [ORG HAMAS  ] ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Since the end of the conflict in [LOC Gaza  ] , [ORG PASF  ] conducted multiple operations against [ORG Hamas  ] members , arresting or detaining over fifty [ORG Hamas  ] members , including 32 in [LOC Hebron  ] January 25 . 
[ORG PASF  ] dispersed a [MISC Hamas-organized  ] rally of 1,200 in [LOC Hebron  ] , detaining seven ( including three women ) on January 25 . 
[ORG PASF  ] also arrested four [ORG Palestinian Islamic Jihad  ] ( [ORG PIJ  ] ) members suspected of throwing firebombs at the home of a [ORG NSF  ] recruit in [LOC Tubas  ] January 23. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG PASF  ] officials say they are determined to prevent chaos in the [LOC West Bank  ] without regard to political agendas . 
They note , however , that formerly [MISC Gaza-based  ] [ORG PASF  ] members are advocating retaliation against [ORG Hamas  ] in the [LOC West Bank  ] in response to [ORG Hamas  ] attacks on [ORG Fatah  ] members in [LOC Gaza  ] ( reftel ) . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG PA  ] is under significant public criticism for its ( sometimes heavy handed ) efforts to maintain calm in the [LOC West Bank  ] during the conflict in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[ORG PASF  ] may face increasing pressure from its own rank-and-file as well as the [LOC West Bank  ] " street " to hold back on security operations amidst accusations of " sub-contracting " for the [ORG IDF  ] .
