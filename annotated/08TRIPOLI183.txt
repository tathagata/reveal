REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary: Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Executive Director Dr. [PER Youssef Sawani  ] agreed to try to facilitate a second [ORG Embassy  ] meeting with ailing human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi to help clarify the apparent dissonance between the [ORG QDF  ] 's characterization of el-Jahmi 's condition and that of some members of his family . 
The specific goals of an [ORG Embassy  ] visit would be to assess el-Jahmi 's current medical condition , confirm that his treating physicians believe he can safely return home , and solicit his views regarding options for his medical care were he to be released . 
Stressing that the [ORG GOL  ] has " no interest " in seeing el-Jahmi 's condition deteriorate , [PER Sawani  ] said el-Jahmi would not/not be under house arrest and would be able to seek medical treatment at any facility , which the [ORG QDF  ] could , if needed , help facilitate . 
A complicating factor is el-Jahmi 's family 's refusal to take him back , despite repeated requests by the [ORG QDF  ] and more recently [ORG GOL  ] security personnel . 
Travel abroad for treatment was not an immediate possibility , but could be in the future if el-Jahmi honored a tacit agreement to remain silent after his release . 
[PER Sawani  ] said [ORG Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights  ] would be allowed to visit [LOC Libya  ] but the timing was still in question . 
End summary . 
FOLLOW-ON VISIT FOR [ORG EMBASSY REQUESTED  ] 2 . 
( C ) P/E Chief met with [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Executive Director Dr. [PER Youssef Sawani  ] on March 3 to follow up on the case of detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi . 
Thanking the [ORG QDF  ] for its facilitation of the [ORG Embassy  ] 's visit to el-Jahmi February 20 ( ref A ) and a visit by el-Jahmi 's family shortly thereafter , P/E Chief noted that there appeared to be some disagreement between the [ORG QDF  ] 's characterization of el-Jahmi 's condition and that of some members of his family . 
After their visit , some members of his family had apparently communicated with [ORG USG  ] officials in [LOC Washington  ] , expressing concern that el-Jahmi 's serious condition meant that his release could pose a threat to his medical prognosis . 
They also expressed concern that , if released , he might not enjoy access to medical care . 
A follow-on visit by [ORG Post  ] to el-Jahmi in the near future - the goals of which would be to assess el-Jahmi 's current medical condition , confirm that his treating physicians believe he can safely return home , and solicit his opinion regarding options for medical care - would be useful to help resolve conflicting accounts . 
3 . 
( C ) Expressing " disappointment " with statements attributed to el-Jahmi 's family in the wake of their recent visit , [PER Sawani  ] agreed that another visit by [ORG Post  ] could be helpful and said he would try to arrange same with relevant [ORG GOL  ] security organizations . 
He noted that recent statements by el-Jahmi 's [MISC U.S.-based  ] brother , [PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi , were viewed by some quarters of the [ORG GOL  ] as evidence that he was motivated by " political opportunism " ; the [ORG QDF  ] 's ability to secure [ORG Embassy  ] access to el-Jahmi on short notice may have been circumscribed by that perception and by the fact that el-Jahmi 's family had still not responded to the offer for them to take him home . 
( [PER Note: Sawani  ] phoned [ORG CDA  ] later that night to convey a message from [ORG QDF  ] Chairman Saif al-Islam to the [ORG USG  ] that [ORG GOL  ] security personnel had approached the family to request that they agree to take their father home , but the family had again refused . 
The [ORG QDF  ] and the [ORG GOL  ] , he said , were now at a loss as to what to do with him , for if they released him now and his family did not accept their responsibility to care for him , he could become destitute . 
Saif al-Islam asked that this message be conveyed to Senator [PER Biden  ] , as well , since he had written to Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] asking for the Leader 's personal intervention to effect el-Jahmi 's release from detention . 
End note . 
) [ORG QDF  ] , [ORG GOL  ] HAVE " NO INTEREST " IN SEEING EL-JAHMI'S CONDITION WORSEN 4 . 
( C ) Responding to statements by international human rights [ORG NGO  ] 's to the effect that releasing el-Jahmi from the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] could pose a threat to his health , [PER Sawani  ] said the [ORG QDF  ] had carefully assessed el-Jahmi 's condition based on input from his treating physicians and had determined that he could now safely return home provided that he receive follow-on medical care . 
Such had not been the case earlier in the year , but el-Jahmi 's condition continued to improve . 
Stressing that the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] had " no interest " in seeing el-Jahmi 's condition worsen , [PER Sawani  ] reiterated that a condition for el-Jahmi 's release was an understanding that he would continue to receive medical treatment after his release ( see text of the [ORG QDF  ] 's letter , reported ref C ) . 
" NO IMPEDIMENT " TO CARE AT OTHER [MISC LIBYAN  ] MEDICAL FACILITIES 5 . 
( C ) Turning to treatment options , [PER Sawani  ] said he " did not [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000183 002 OF 003 foresee any impediment " to el-Jahmi receiving medical care at other medical facilities if he were released . 
The court did not formally sentence el-Jahmi during his 2004 trial ; it found him mentally incompetent and recommended that he receive appropriate medical care . 
( [PER Note:  ] el-Jahmi told us his understanding was that he had/had been convicted under a [MISC Libyan  ] law that criminalizeds advocating a postioin inconsistent with the 1969 revolution , and for defaming leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
End note . 
) El-Jahmi would not/not be subject to house arrest or its equivalent and there would be no restrictions against him seeking care at any medical facility if he were released . 
He would enjoy the rights " of any [MISC Libyan  ] citizen " to come and go as he pleased , provided that he acceded to the tacit understanding that he would refrain from speaking about his detention or engaging in political discourse . 
[ORG QDF  ] MIGHT HELP FACILITATE ALTERNATIVE CARE 6 . 
( C ) Noting that some medical facilities , particularly private clinics , might be reluctant to provide care to el-Jahmi given sensitivities attendant to his case , P/E Chief asked whether treatment at facilities such as the private [ORG Libyan-Swiss Clinic  ] and [LOC St. James Hospital  ] would be possible , and whether the [ORG QDF  ] might help facilitate same if such were necessary . 
[PER Sawani  ] agreed that the [ORG QDF  ] might , if needed , play a positive intermediary role in facilitating care at those facilities or others . 
Saying the physician currently treating el-Jahmi at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) had been el-Jahmi 's physican for more than five years ( pre-dating his trial and incarceration ) , [PER Sawani  ] suggested that an option could be continued treatment at the [ORG TMC  ] on an outpatient basis . 
( Note: Dr. [PER Abdulrahman Mehdy  ] and el-Jahmi both told P/E Chief during the latter 's visit to the [ORG TMC  ] that [PER Mehdy  ] had been el-Jahmi 's physician for over five years . 
End note . 
) Conceding that local measures were perhaps wanting in some regards , [PER Sawani  ] noted that the [ORG TMC  ] was nonetheless " a center of medical excellence " by [MISC Libyan  ] standards . 
TREATMENT ABROAD POSSIBLE " DOWN THE ROAD " , WITH STIPULATIONS 7 . 
( C ) Asked whether el-Jahmi might travel abroad for treatment , [PER Sawani  ] said his understanding was that el-Jahmi does not currently possess a passport . 
Emphasizing that he was offering his " personal opinion " , he said he believed that if el-Jahmi were released and honored the conditions for that release , he could be permitted to travel outside [LOC Libya  ] for treatment " down the road " . 
Pressed for clarity , [PER Sawani  ] demurred , saying his comment did not represent an " official position " on the issue of travel abroad , but was rather offering his sense of future possibilities based on conversations concerning el-Jahmi 's case to which he had been privvy . 
Reitarating earlier points about the political sensitivies of [PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi 's perceived exploitation of the case , he stressed that [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi and the family would need to demonstrate commitment to the agreement to refrain from public commentary for " a reasonable period of time " to secure permission for el-Jahmi to travel abroad for treatment , but said he believed such would be possible . 
[ORG PHR/HRW VISIT  ] 8 . 
( C ) Asked whether the [ORG QDF  ] expected to be able to facilitate a visit on/about March 12 by [ORG Physicians for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG PHR  ] ) and [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] , [PER Sawani  ] conceded that he wasn't certain . 
He believed that the visit would happen , but remarks by the family after their recent visit to el-Jahmi , together with public statements by international human rights [ORG NGO  ] 's and the proposed visit 's proximity to the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( currently underway ) , had made it difficult for the [ORG QDF  ] to push for the trip to happen in the immediate future . 
Pressed , he agreed to follow up on the issue with relevant [ORG GOL  ] decision-makers to see whether there might still be some possibility of facilitating on/about March 12 . 
COMMENT 9 . 
( C ) [PER Sawani  ] clearly understands that the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] face a potential credibility gap in terms of the dissonance between the [ORG QDF  ] 's characterization of the case and the family 's purported observations ( as reported by [PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi ) . 
His remarks concerning the [ORG GOL  ] 's neuralgia about [PER Muhammad  ] el-Jahmi 's public statements and outreach to international human rights [ORG NGO  ] 's suggest that quiet engagement in the [MISC Embassy-QDF  ] channel remains the best current option for maintaining positive momentum . 
Treatment abroad in the near term does not currently appear possible , but [PER Sawani  ] took pains to emphasize it could be in the future . 
The focus for now should be on assessing el-Jahmi 's current medical condition , determining whether he wants to [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000183 003 OF 003 return home under the stipulated conditions and whether his family will agree to take him back and care for him , and ascertaining where and how he would obtain necessary medical treatment in future if he were released . 
End comment .
