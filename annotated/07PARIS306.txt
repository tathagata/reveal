Please protect accordingly. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
Summary: The Ambassador and all of [LOC Mission France  ] support a sustained and focused effort to engage [LOC France  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] minorities , recognizing that organizing and executing such an effort will continue to require considerable discretion , sensitivity and tact on our part . 
Although there is some evidence that [LOC France  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] minorities are better integrated than their counterparts elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] , the [MISC French  ] have a well-known problem with discrimination against minorities . 
[MISC French  ] media has fallen short in their reporting on these issues and [MISC French  ] government and private institutions also found it difficult to face up squarely to the challenges involved . 
We can engage the [MISC French  ] both privately and via the media on the issue of minority inclusion , but superior [MISC French  ] language skills are crucial to make effective use of the [MISC French  ] broadcast media. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Our specific goals for this strategy: a ) demonstration of our commitment to these issues , b ) sharing of our [MISC American  ] experiences in managing diversity , and c ) encouraging social reforms within [LOC France  ] to improve the lot of its minorities. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Post will continue to grow its established minority outreach effort , identifying [MISC Arab-Muslim  ] outreach projects as such in expanded program reporting . 
Effectiveness will be measured in terms of audience and participant totals , improved [MISC French  ] media treatment of minority issues , a measurably improved perception of the [LOC U.S.  ] among target audiences , and the initiation of new policies and programs by both the [MISC French  ] government and [MISC French  ] non-governmental organizations to improve the lot of [MISC French  ] Arabs and [MISC Muslims.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Contact information for post 's designated minority engagement officers - [PER PDOff Colombia Barrosse  ] and [PER PolOff William Stephen Wells  ] - is in the last paragraph . 
End summary. ------------- The [MISC Challenge  ] ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Reftel tasked post to produce a '07 - '08 public outreach strategy for engaging [LOC France  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] minorities , to counter terrorist recruiting among them , and to foster their greater integration into mainstream [MISC French  ] society . 
We regret the late response to this tasking. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Embassy [LOC Paris  ] and its seven field posts began to reach out systematically to [LOC France  ] 's [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] populations several years ago , in 2003 , targeting neighborhoods and institutions known to have large immigrant populations ( first , second and third generation . 
) Since that time post established a broad base of political reporting on [MISC French  ] [MISC Muslim  ] issues , and the post 's [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] increasingly focused its program assets ( speakers , DVCs , exhibits , exchanges and grants ) on minority communities , under the more acceptable rubric of " civil society " outreach. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
Organizing and executing this outreach required sensitivity and discretion due to [LOC France  ] 's particular philosophical outlook and history . 
It has the largest [MISC Muslim  ] minority population in [LOC Western Europe  ] , both as an absolute number and as a percentage of the national population . 
[LOC France  ] 's five million plus Muslims are largely [MISC North African  ] ( [MISC Algerian  ] , [MISC Moroccan  ] and [MISC Tunisian  ] ) in origin , although they remain diverse and resistant to blanket categorization . 
The [MISC French  ] Government 's approach to religion and minorities traditionally has been to promote assimilation under the banner of equality , however imperfectly that goal has been achieved , with a strong emphasis on " laicite " ( secularism ) in public spaces . 
This policy demands official blindness to all racial and ethnic differences . 
[MISC French  ] law formally prohibits the collection of statistics on the basis of race , religion , or ethnic background ; and only approximate figures are available to us regarding [LOC France  ] 's minorities , including [MISC Muslims.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Concepts such as " affirmative action , " " diversity , " " multiculturalism , " or compound descriptions of identity ( e.g . 
[MISC Arab-American  ] ) are relatively new and somewhat controversial in [LOC France  ] , where the approach has been more to target specific geographic enclaves , e.g. educational programs for neighborhoods with a high percentage of socio-economically disadvantaged ( often [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] ) youth. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
Young [MISC French  ] citizens across the religious spectrum tend not to be practicing/devout , but disadvantaged minority youth remain an obvious target for extremist recruiting . 
As a result of recent events ( including the November 2005 unrest in the suburbs ) , diversity and integration are discussed more openly - at conferences , as well as on talk shows and campuses . 
Nevertheless , it remains generally indelicate in [LOC France  ] to ask a person 's religious affiliation . 
Challenging the government 's approach to assimilation can amount to challenging the basis of [MISC French  ] identity within the [MISC Republic.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
The organization and execution of any official [ORG USG  ] [MISC Muslim  ] outreach strategy in such an environment - whatever the strong justification in our eyes - will continue to require considerable and continuing discretion , sensitivity and tact. ----------------- Media Environment ----------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
As in other [MISC European  ] countries , [MISC French  ] media reporting of [LOC U.S.  ] policies and intentions is often skeptical . 
Reporting by the mainstream media on [MISC Arab Muslims  ] and their issues , however , is typically not so much negative as negligent , falling short both in its coverage of discrimination towards them and of juvenile delinquency among them. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
Official [MISC Americans  ] and pro-USG surrogates have ready access to most [MISC French  ] media to convey official policy messages , but using that access effectively presents a special challenge . 
Superior [MISC French  ] language and presentation skills are especially important for making effective use of [MISC French  ] broadcast media . 
Communicating to the [MISC French  ] about the treatment of their minorities , a topic they themselves are often reticent to explore in depth , is more difficult for us than , say , describing our own , [MISC American  ] experience . 
Any ill-prepared efforts to reach out to [LOC France  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] audiences could easily become counter-productive . 
We therefore must continue to proceed with care. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
Our primary media focus needs to be on [MISC TV  ] and radio , but print - and the new media - should not be ignored. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
Fewer or less than one [MISC French  ] adult in four reads a national newspaper regularly . 
Regional papers are still important , however , with [ORG Ouest France  ] ( [ORG Rennes  ] ) being the largest daily . 
The [MISC French  ] are more avid magazine readers , buying over three billion copies a year. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
[MISC French  ] broadcasting is partly state-owned and partly in the hands of private enterprise . 
Most [MISC French  ] TV viewers still , reportedly , prefer the six major broadcast channels , but the number of channels offered by various cable and satellite operators continues to grow , with the newest being [LOC France  ] 24 , a [MISC CNN-like  ] 24-hour news-station . 
Average [MISC French  ] TV viewership is over five and one-half hours per day. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
Radio , especially FM , remains an important medium in [LOC France:  ] over 99 per cent of [MISC French  ] households own at least one radio and almost 5 in 6 over the age of 13 year listen to the radio daily . 
As with [MISC TV  ] , [MISC French  ] radio is part state-owned and part private. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
Top [MISC French  ] journalists are often products of the same elite schools as many [MISC French  ] government leaders . 
These journalists do not necessarily regard their primary role as to check the power of government . 
Rather , many see themselves more as intellectuals , preferring to analyze events and influence readers more than to report events. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
The private sector media in [LOC France  ] - print and broadcast - continues to be dominated by a small number of conglomerates , and all [MISC French  ] media are more regulated and subjected to political and commercial pressures than are their [MISC American  ] counterparts . 
The Higher [ORG Audio-Visual Council  ] , created in 1989 , appoints the [MISC CEOs  ] of all [MISC French  ] public broadcasting channels and monitors their political content. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
Internet access is growing steadily in [LOC France  ] , especially among the younger generation , rapidly replacing traditional media . 
All important television and radio channels in [LOC France  ] have their own websites , as do the major print media . 
Blogs are an increasingly popular method of communication for minorities and [ORG NGOs  ] , who use them to express opinions they do not feel are reflected in the traditional media. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
[LOC France  ] 's first generation [MISC Arab  ] immigrants typically continue to read publications from their countries of origin , and the major [MISC Algerian  ] , [MISC Moroccan  ] and [MISC Tunisian  ] papers are widely available in larger [MISC French  ] cities . 
These individuals also watch satellite and cable TV stations in [MISC Arabic  ] , including [ORG Al-Jazeerah  ] TV . 
Second and third generation [MISC French  ] [MISC Arabs  ] , however , are typically not literate in [MISC Arab  ] , and their print media habits are similar to those of other [MISC French  ] readers. -------------- Specific Goals -------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT . 
We need to say and show , repeatedly , to [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim audiences alike , the [ORG USG  ] is engaged for good in the [MISC Arab-Muslim  ] world , we respect [MISC Islam  ] , and the [ORG USG  ] takes seriously the potentially global threat of disenfranchised and disadvantaged minorities in [LOC France  ] . 
For those reasons , and because we believe in participatory democracy , we promote the advancement and full integration of [LOC France  ] 's minorities into mainstream society. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES . 
We also must continue to communicate , well and often , to both [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim audiences in [LOC France  ] , the [MISC American  ] experience with ethnic and social conflict - both our successes and our failures - in order to establish our legitimacy for engagement on this issue . 
We can strengthen the sense of shared values and common cause between [MISC Americans  ] and [MISC French  ] working for inter-communal cooperation , peace , stability , opportunity and respect . 
In addition , we need to remain present , listening and showing respect for [MISC French  ] ( immigrant and non-immigrant ) experiences. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
Most [MISC French  ] minorities , including [MISC Arabs  ] , are somewhat aware of the [LOC U.S.  ] experience and positively inclined towards us , seeing us as having tried to address our shortcomings . 
What many [MISC French  ] lack is specific information about or any in-depth understanding of our experience that might help them to conceive of and implement a workable [MISC French  ] model for addressing ethnic conflict . 
The [MISC French  ] establishment , for the most part , has been reticent to face up to these problems or their root causes , reluctant to accept the [LOC U.S.  ] as a model - or as a partner . 
The [ORG Ministry of Education  ] , however , has shown its willingness to engage with us in this area. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
ENCOURAGE REFORM . 
We must continue to encourage and help to empower moderate social reformers in [LOC France  ] to preempt and thwart those who would aggravate social discontent for the purposes of extremist recruiting. --------------------------------------------- -- Humanitarian/Development Issues to be addressed --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
Although [LOC France  ] has a highly developed , modern economy with significant resources at its disposal , much of the discontent reported by [MISC French  ] minority communities relates to economic and social exclusion . 
While direct development assistance from the [ORG USG  ] is not likely to be available for [LOC France  ] , some [ORG USG  ] financial and program resources were and will continue to be deployed to address the consequences of discrimination and minority exclusion in [LOC France  ] . 
Some [MISC French  ] [ORG NGOs  ] working to assist minority youth , for example , received financial and other support - such as invitations to participate in exchange programs - through the [MISC Embassy  ] to pursue specific programs. ------------------------ Target Audiences by Goal ------------------------ <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT . 
We need to show the [ORG USG  ] takes seriously the threat of disenfranchised and disadvantaged minorities around the world , including in [LOC France  ] , and we are committed to empowering minorities as part of our fundamental belief in participatory democracy. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
Our target audiences for this goal include both [MISC Muslims  ] and non-Muslims: at-risk youth , professionals who serve them , [ORG NGO  ] leaders , and the media , both national and regional . 
We will continue to engage resident [MISC Muslim  ] country diplomats to improve their understanding of the [LOC U.S.  ] We also must continue to educate ourselves systematically on [MISC Islam  ] through such efforts as our in-house speaker program , which recently invited a prominent [MISC French  ] scholar on [MISC Islam  ] to address a lunchtime roundtable for [MISC Embassy  ] staffers. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
While much of the existing effort already ties into our current [MISC Embassy  ] public diplomacy strategy , increased funding for exchanges , speakers and grants would be most welcome . 
So would more help from [LOC Washington  ] with recruiting minority speakers ( [ORG Francophones  ] ) and further access to short-term exchanges , such as [ORG ECA  ] 's summer institutes , to target minority educators. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
SHARE EXPERIENCES . 
We must continue communication in a broad and frequent manner to audiences in [LOC France  ] about our own [MISC American  ] experience with ethnic and social conflict . 
We need to demonstrate our legitimate standing on this issue in order to strengthen the sense of shared values and common cause between [MISC Americans  ] and the [MISC French.  ] <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
Our target audience for this goal , again , is [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim , but especially the media , [ORG NGOs  ] , educators , and [MISC French  ] youth ( students and professionals . 
) All need to engage - themselves and each other - to resolve the minority problems facing [LOC France.  ] <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
As with the earlier goal , a considerable effort is already underway , tied to our existing public diplomacy strategy , but increased funding for exchanges , speakers and grants would enable us to reinforce our current efforts. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
ENCOURAGE REFORM . 
We need to encourage moderate social reformers in [LOC France  ] and thwart those who would aggravate social discontent for the purposes of extremist recruiting. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
Our target audience for this goal should be both social reform elements and the individual young [MISC Muslims  ] most likely to be targeted by extremist recruiters . 
The reformers need to be encouraged and resourced . 
The minority youth need to believe that they have a bright future in their adopted country and that they have nothing to gain and much to lose by association with extremist violence . 
Specific programs we could deploy to address these audiences include our existing media and [ORG Information Resource Center  ] outreach efforts , increased targeting of our exchange programs to those engaged on minority issues , and expanded personal outreach by the entire [MISC Mission  ] staff via our in-house public speaker program . 
A concerted effort will also be made to increase invitations to [MISC Muslims  ] and other minorities for [MISC Mission  ] representational events , not only in [LOC Paris  ] but also in our field posts across [LOC France  ] . 
Again , increased funding for exchanges , speakers and grants would enable us to reinforce our current efforts. ----------------------- Measuring Effectiveness ----------------------- <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
We will now identify our minority outreach efforts more clearly as such in our routine program reporting , tying into the new [ORG PD  ] evaluation project led by [ORG ECA  ] 's [ORG PD Evaluation Office  ] . 
We will measure our effectiveness in terms of audience and participant totals , improved [MISC French  ] media treatment of minority issues , improved perceptions of the [LOC U.S.  ] among minority audiences , and the initiation of new policies and programs by the [MISC French  ] government and/or [MISC French  ] non-governmental organizations to improve the lot of [MISC French  ] [MISC Arabs  ] and [MISC Muslims.  ] ---------------- [MISC Embassy  ] Contacts ---------------- <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
Minority engagement officers for [ORG Embassy Paris  ] are [ORG PDOff Colombia Barrosse  ] ( BarrosseCX@state.gov , x 4541 ) , who coordinates our programmatic outreach and [PER PolOff William S  ] . 
( [PER Steve  ] ) [PER Wells  ] ( WellsWS@state.gov , x 4284 ) , who tracks minority issues for reporting .
