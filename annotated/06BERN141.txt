[ORG BERN  ] 100 B. [ORG BERN  ] 10 C. 2005 [ORG BERN  ] 1865 Classified By: Pol/Econ Counselor [PER Eric Sandberg  ] , Reasons 1.4 b/d 1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Switzerland  ] and [LOC Liechtenstein  ] are considered low-threat target for terrorist attacks , but [LOC Bern  ] acknowledges that [MISC Islamist  ] groups could use the country as a transit point , logistics center , or haven for terrorist finances . 
While violent crime in both countries is relatively low , officials remain concerned about international organized criminal groups and extreme right-wing and left-wing political elements who occasionally mobilize for demonstrations surrounding major events , such as the annual [ORG World Economic Forum  ] in [LOC Davos  ] . 
[MISC Swiss  ] officials maintain that there are few [MISC Islamic  ] extremists in the country , but a small number of arrests in the past two years suggests there may be more under the surface . 
Bilateral law enforcement and intelligence cooperation is improving , but at a gradual pace ; [MISC Swiss  ] leaders insist that they can address the threat with little outside assistance . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] media and individual members of Parliament have placed a greater focus on alleged [ORG USG  ] wrongdoings in the War on Terror than on the terrorist threat itself . 
As for [LOC Liechtenstein  ] , officials work very cooperatively with [ORG USG  ] counterparts , as they seek to ameliorate their reputation as a money-laundering center . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Anti-Terror Measures  ] -------------------- 2 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) [LOC Switzerland  ] implemented [ORG UN  ] sanctions even prior to becoming a full member in 2002 . 
Along with [ORG UN  ] lists , the [ORG Swiss Economic and Finance  ] ministries have drawn up their own list of around 44 individuals and entities connected with international terrorism ( [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] ) or its financing . 
[MISC Swiss  ] authorities have thus far blocked about 82 accounts totaling $28 million ( [ORG SFr  ] 34 million ) from individuals or companies linked to [PER Osama bin Laden  ] and [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] under [ORG UN  ] resolutions . 
The [ORG Swiss Federal Prosecutor  ] also froze separately 41 accounts representing about $28 million ( [ORG SFr  ] 34 millions ) on the ground they were related to terrorist financing . 
[MISC Swiss  ] officials estimate significant overlap between the [LOC US  ] and [ORG UN  ] lists . 
[LOC Switzerland  ] signed and ratified all of the 12 [ORG UN  ] anti-terrorism conventions as of September 2003 . 
3 . 
( U ) For its part , [LOC Liechtenstein  ] has frozen about $145 thousand in [LOC Taliban/Al-Qaeda  ] assets under [ORG UNSC Resolution  ] 1267 . 
The principality has taken notable strides to combat money laundering and other illegal activity since 1999 ; it joined the [ORG Egmont Group  ] in 2001 , signed a mutual legal assistance treaty with the [LOC United States  ] in 2003 , and was [ORG FATF  ] certified that same year . 
[LOC Liechtenstein  ] has also ratified all of the relevant [ORG UN  ] conventions . 
Bilateral Cooperation --------------------- 4 . 
( C ) Following 9/11 , the [MISC Swiss  ] agreed to sign an operative working agreement ( [ORG OWA  ] ) with the [ORG USG  ] permitting intensified information sharing on [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and allowing an [ORG FBI  ] agent to sit in the [ORG Federal Criminal Police Counterterrorism Unit  ] . 
We are in the final stages of negotiating a broadened [ORG OWA  ] to allow joint investigations on counterterrorism matters . 
As forthcoming as some contacts are , the [MISC Swiss  ] law enforcement community in general remain reluctant to open up to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The sentiment was expressed best by Justice Minister [PER Blocher  ] to the Ambassador . 
[PER Blocher  ] said that [LOC Switzerland  ] shared [MISC America’s  ] counterterrorism goals ; [LOC Switzerland  ] will worry about [LOC Switzerland  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] can worry about the rest of the world . 
The least cooperative [MISC Swiss  ] agency ( with us and with other [MISC Swiss  ] agencies ) is the [ORG Federal Service for Analysis and Prevention  ] ( [ORG DAP  ] ) -- the internal intelligence service . 
The external service , under the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Department of Defense  ] , is more cooperative . 
5 . 
( C ) In many ways , [LOC Liechtenstein  ] officials are a model of what we wish the [MISC Swiss  ] would become . 
Shocked by the international notoriety it earned in the 1990s , officials in the tiny principality decided to join [ORG FATF  ] and cooperate with partners . 
The [MISC MLAT  ] it signed with the [LOC United States  ] in 2003 [ORG BERN  ] 00000141 002 OF 004 was the first of its kind for [LOC Liechtenstein  ] . 
They make as much use of it as do our law enforcement agencies . 
Significant counterterrorism investigations ------------------------------------------- 6 . 
( C ) [MISC Swiss  ] prosecutors have launched several investigations of suspected [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] operatives in [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX Muslims  ] in [LOC Switzerland  ] ---------------------- 7 . 
( U ) The [MISC Muslim  ] population in [LOC Switzerland  ] has grown rapidly [ORG BERN  ] 00000141 003.2 OF 004 in the last two decades , now reaching around 310,000 , or 4.3 percenQ the [MISC Swiss  ] population . 
The majority of these , roughly 200,000 , come from former [LOC Yugoslavia  ] and tend to be moderate or secular in their views . 
Another 70,000 are of [MISC Turkish  ] background , have long been in [LOC Switzerland  ] , and are also moderate . 
Only the [MISC North African  ] population , largely from [LOC Morocco  ] , are seen as a possible source of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism . 
There are no [MISC Islamic  ] political parties in [LOC Switzerland  ] ; the [MISC Muslim  ] population is divided along ethnic lines . 
There are only two mosque buildings in [LOC SwitzerlandQn Zurich  ] aQeneva ) , but over a hundred makeshift [MISC Islamic  ] centers operate . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [MISC Swiss  ] authorities recognize that the [MISC Muslim  ] population could contain extremists , they rate the threat from right-wing [ORG Neo-nazis  ] and left-wing [MISC Swiss  ] political extremists as being much higher . 
[MISC Swiss  ] authorities believe that those [MISC Islamists  ] present consider the country a “refuge” rather than a “place to carry out operations.” A Special Report on [MISC Extremism  ] issued late last year maintains that almost all radical groups represented in [LOC Switzerland  ] are [MISC Sunni  ] organizations whose primary goals are the establishment of [MISC Islamic  ] governments in their homelands . 
The principal groups in this category are [PER En Nahdha  ] , the [ORG Tunisian Islamic Front  ] , the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , the [ORG Islamic Salvation Front  ] ( [ORG FIS  ] ) , the [ORG Armed Islamic Group  ] ( [ORG GIA  ] ) , the [ORG Salafist Group  ] for Preaching and Combat ( [ORG GSPC  ] ) , [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Hizbollah  ] and [ORG Al-Takfir  ] wal-Hijra . 
9 . 
( C ) The best known [MISC Islamists  ] in [LOC Switzerland  ] are the [MISC Ramadans  ] , [PER Tariq  ] and [PER Hani  ] , of the [ORG Islamic Center  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
[PER Tariq Ramadan  ] , formerly a professor of philosophy and grandson of [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] found [PER Hassan al-Bana  ] , is well-known throughout [LOC Europe  ] . 
He is sometimes hailed as a moderate , at other times attacked as a wolf in sheep’s clothing , putting a palatable front to fundamentalist activities . 
Offered a teaching position at [ORG Notre Dame University  ] in 2004 , his visa was revoked by [ORG DHS  ] , and he withdrew a subsequent application . 
The [ORG UK Government  ] has included [PER Ramadan  ] in an advisory body to assist in their outreach efforts with its [MISC Muslim  ] minority . 
10 . 
( U ) [PER Hani Ramadan  ] was suspended from his duties as a public school teacher in the fall of 2002 , following the publication of an article in the [MISC French  ] newspaper “Le Monde , ” in which he spoke out in favor of the stoning of adulterers . 
He was dismissed in 2003 , following an administrative investigation , but he successfully appealed the decision . 
However , following a second investigation , the [ORG Geneva Cantonal Government  ] confirmed Ramadan’s dismissal and removed him from the cantonal payroll in December 2004 . 
In October 2005 , the [MISC Swiss  ] Justice Ministry denied a work permit to a [MISC Turkish  ] Imam invited to work at the [ORG Islamic Center  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] , due to the [MISC Imam’s  ] extremist views . 
[ORG Swiss Media Push-back  ] on the War on Terrorism --------------------------------------------- - 11 . 
( C ) Since the [ORG Washington Post  ] claimed in early November 2005 that the [LOC United States  ] was operating hidden prisons in [LOC Europe  ] , the [MISC Swiss  ] media has gone full bore in identifying [ORG USG  ] sins , real and imagined . 
Any news on [LOC Guantanamo  ] or [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] is guaranteed front-page treatment , whereas [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] attacks are relegated to the back pages . 
Of particular concern is the issue of overflights by alleged [ORG CIA  ] charter planes . 
[MISC Italian  ] prosecutors allege that a [LOC U.S.  ] military jet traversed [MISC Swiss  ] airspace on the day [LOC Milan  ] cleric [PER Abu Omar  ] was kidnapped . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] government has repeatedly asked the [ORG USG  ] to explain the flight and four charter plane landings at [LOC Geneva Airport  ] . 
[LOC Washington  ] has yet to respond . 
12 . 
( C ) Recently , a [MISC Swiss  ] tabloid published a leaked [MISC Swiss  ] intelligence report of an intercept of an [MISC Egyptian  ] government fax . 
The [ORG Swiss Federal Council  ] has condemned the leak and its subsequent publication , and the government has launched administrative and criminal investigations into the matter . 
The intercepted [MISC Egyptian  ] fax claimed that the [MISC Egyptian  ] government knew of 23 [MISC Iraqi  ] and [MISC Afghani  ] prisoners transferred by the [ORG USG  ] to prisons in [LOC Romania  ] and other [MISC Eastern European  ] countries . 
[MISC Swiss  ] officials apologized to Ambassador [PER Willeford  ] for the leak and for the press’s overreaction to it . 
The Ambassador cautioned officials that Switzerland’s [ORG BERN  ] 00000141 004 OF 004 obsession with the prisons/overflight matter -- driven in significant measure by [MISC Swiss  ] Senator [PER Dick Marty  ] -- risked overwhelming Washington’s perceptions of [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
[PER Marty  ] , acting in his capacity as head of the [ORG Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly’s Justice Commission  ] and not in any official [MISC Swiss  ] government capacity , greeted the information cautiously , but criticized the [MISC Swiss  ] and other [MISC European  ] governments for not disclosing information on the prisoner issue . 
Comment ------- 13 . 
( C ) Comment: Despite being somewhat shaken by attacks in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] , the [MISC Swiss  ] internal security service continues to assess that [LOC Switzerland  ] is relatively safe and that there is no evidence yet of any activity beyond logistical support for [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
[MISC Swiss  ] opinion leaders among the [ORG Parliament  ] and media exhibit little evident concern about the terrorist threat to [LOC Switzerland  ] , perhaps contributing to their tendency to focus their criticism on the [ORG USG  ] reaction , rather than the initial threat itself . 
Embassy engagement with [MISC Swiss  ] counterparts , reinforced by senior-level visits by [ORG USG  ] officials , are helping to move the [MISC Swiss  ] to be more forthcoming on information sharing and joint investigations . 
Absent a direct attack on [MISC Swiss  ] interests , however , the process is liable to move very gradually . 
End comment .
