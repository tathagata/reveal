HAVANA 150 Classified By: COM [PER Jonathan Farrar  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) In virtually identical letters published in the official media on March 5 , former Vice President [PER Carlos Lage  ] and former Foreign Minister [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] admitted that they had committed unspecified " errors " for which they assumed full responsibility , and then resigned from their remaining positions . 
In [LOC Lage  ] 's case this included his position as Vice President of the [ORG Council of State  ] , Deputy in the [ORG National Assembly  ] , Member of the [ORG Council of State  ] , and member of the [ORG Communist Party Central Committee and Political Bureau  ] . 
[PER Perez Roque  ] resigned from all of the same positions , except for that of Vice President. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Although there had been no official announcement of his departure , [PER Fernando Remirez  ] de [PER Estenoz  ] , the [ORG Communist Party  ] chief of Foreign Relations , was replaced by the deputy chief [PER Jorge Marti Martinez  ] . 
This news became public when the media published a list of attendees at a meeting between President [PER Raul Castro  ] and [MISC Honduran  ] President [PER Zelaya  ] which included [PER Marti Martinez  ] with the title of [ORG Communist Party  ] Chief of Foreign Relations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT:  ] The language used by [PER Fidel  ] to justify the firings of [PER Lage  ] and [PER Perez Roque  ] together with the tone of the published resignation letters ( reminiscent of similar confessions during [LOC China  ] 's cultural revolution ) have led many observers on the island to speculate that one or both may be brought to trial . 
[PER Fidel  ] 's comments alone amount to a virtual charge of treason against them . 
The departing [MISC Japanese  ] ambassador told COM on March 4 that changes in the foreign policy leadership had severely damaged [LOC Tokyo  ] 's plans for relations with [LOC Cuba  ] as the [ORG GOJ  ] had placed great hope in personal relationships with [PER Lage  ] , [PER Perez Roque  ] and former foreign trade minister [PER De la Nuez--all  ] now fired . 
[PER Remirez  ] de [PER Estenoz  ] had come up frequently in diplomatic conversations as a serious interlocutor who could improve [LOC Cuba  ] 's relations with the world . 
He is credited by some with being the mastermind of the [ORG GOC  ] 's very successful policy to build good relations with the other [MISC Latin American  ] and [ORG Caribbean  ] governments as a further bulwark against the [LOC U.S.  ] These kinds of successes , while benefiting [LOC Cuba  ] demonstrably , may have resulted in the downfall of their authors when they became too closely associated with them personally. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) COMMENT CONTINUED: The changes may also be part of the process of preparing for the [ORG Communist Party  ] congress , announced for later this year but for which no date has been set . 
As [PER Raul  ] continues to consolidate his power , there is growing evidence that the inner circle of [PER Castro  ] regime is turning further inward ( and backward ) . 
A longtime ( 20 plus years ) local observer of [MISC Cuban  ] politics theorized last night to COM that the changes are meant to consolidate power and to lateral the succession away from the [ORG Lage/Remirez  ] de [PER Estenoz  ] generation and to the military and civilian generation who cut their teeth during the [MISC Angolan  ] war years . 
Speculation runs rampant: those few who truly know are not talking with us or with our diplomatic colleagues . 
End Comment .
