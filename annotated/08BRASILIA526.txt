( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Ali Reza Sheikh-Attar  ] visited [LOC Brasilia  ] in mid-March to press [LOC Brazil  ] to join an anti-American bloc in [LOC South America  ] composed of [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad  ] continues to try to arrange an official visit to [LOC Brazil  ] , according to Senator [PER Heraclito Fortes  ] ( strictly protect ) , chairman of the Foreign Relations and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] . 
[PER Fortes  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] diplomat complained about [ORG UN  ] pressure on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , and said that after the [MISC Olympics  ] , [LOC China  ] would deliberately exert pressure on the [LOC U.S.  ] dollar by selling off investments in the [LOC U.S.  ] suddenly or gradually . 
This cable provides additional information on [PER Sheikh-Attar  ] 's activities reported in ref [PER A. Fortes  ] is one of a handful of [MISC Brazilian  ] legislators with serious concerns about [MISC Iranian  ] overtures in the region , which he sees as an effort to exploit [LOC Latin America  ] 's vulnerabilities to advance [MISC Iranian  ] interests by undermining the [LOC U.S.  ] in the region .

( [ORG S  ] ) Senator [PER Heraclito Fortes  ] ( [MISC Democrat  ] , opposition ; of [LOC Piaui  ] ) , chairman of the [ORG Senate Foreign Relations  ] and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] , briefed the Ambassador on March 28 on his meeting in mid-March with [PER Ali Reza Sheikh-Attar  ] , Deputy Foreign Minister of [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Fortes  ] recalled our previous conversations with him on [MISC Iranian  ] activities in the region ( ref B ) and said that recent events have borne out his conviction that [LOC Iran  ] is behind certain problems in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He said [PER Sheikh-Attar  ] comes to [LOC Brazil  ] occasionally and always follows the same itinerary: [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC La Paz  ] , [LOC Quito  ] , [LOC Caracas  ] , and [LOC Tehran  ] , and " the conversation is always the same " : he complains about [ORG UN  ] pressures on [LOC Iran  ] over uranium enrichment , centrifuges , [ORG UN  ] inspections , and so forth. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [LOC Iran  ] Urges Formation of [MISC Anti-American Bloc  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Iranian  ] diplomat was lobbying [LOC Brazil  ] to join an anti-America bloc , [PER Fortes  ] said , which in his view already includes [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Sheikh-Attar  ] told [PER Fortes  ] he was also talking with [LOC Argentina  ] about the bloc , although [PER Fortes  ] did not know whether [PER Sheikh-Attar  ] had gone to [LOC Argentina  ] on this latest trip to [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Fortes  ] noted that [PER Sheikh-Attar  ] also said , " [LOC Brazil  ] will lose if it doesn't participate . 
" [PER Sheikh-Attar  ] also complained that [LOC Brazil  ] has not yet received an official visit by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmed Ahmadinejad  ] , [PER Fortes  ] noted. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In [PER Fortes  ] 's view , it is difficult to put together an anti-American bloc in [LOC South America  ] , but if [LOC Iran  ] were successful , such a bloc could cause trouble after the [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Olympics  ] . 
He said categorically , " There is zero chance that [LOC Brazil  ] will participate " in such a bloc , although there are a small number in the government such as presidential foreign policy adviser [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] who are favorable . 
[PER Fortes  ] said [PER Sheikh-Attar  ] also met with officials at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] ( ref A ) , and did not know whether he had seen President Lula. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [MISC Iranian  ] Meddling in [LOC Latin America  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Citing the recent conflict between [LOC Ecuador  ] and [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000526 002.2 OF 002 [LOC Colombia  ] as an example , Chairman [PER Fortes  ] noted again ( ref B ) that [LOC Iran  ] is trying to cause unrest in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] may have played a role because his previous contacts with [MISC Iranian  ] officials have led him to the conclusion that [LOC Iran  ] intends to transfer conflict from the [LOC Middle East  ] to [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He also pointed to technology transfers to [LOC Venezuela  ] ( [ORG NFI  ] ) , the discovery earlier in March 2008 of depleted uranium in a [ORG FARC  ] safehouse , and the " handling of arms " ( [ORG NFI  ] ) in the region as actions in which [LOC Iran  ] may have been involved , adding that this is all hard to prove . 
Chairman [PER Fortes  ] also said that while [LOC Iran  ] has used [LOC Venezuela  ] to open doors in [LOC Latin America  ] , it is starting to " find its own channels " and will not need [LOC Venezuela  ] any more. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [MISC Iranian  ] Diplomat: [LOC China  ] Will Move Against the Dollar - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Chairman [PER Fortes  ] reported that [PER Sheikh-Attar  ] told him the world financial order had flipped from what it was 30 years ago , and now countries such as [LOC China  ] and [LOC Japan  ] were able to make investments that were unthinkable in the past , and suggested that [LOC Brazil  ] 's economic and security relationships ought to depart from [LOC Brazil  ] 's traditional alignment with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Sheikh-Attar  ] also predicted that after the [MISC Olympics  ] , [LOC China  ] would " start making moves " to cause a collapse in the value of the dollar by selling off dollars and investments in the [LOC U.S.  ] either suddenly or gradually . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] told Chairman [PER Fortes  ] that the [MISC Chinese  ] actions would " be more powerful than an atomic bomb . 
" In reference to this and the other statements by the [MISC Iranian  ] diplomat , [PER Fortes  ] said , " I just look at him and think he is a fool . 
" Asked whether he thought the [MISC Iranian  ] knew this information about [LOC China  ] or was speculating , [PER Fortes  ] said he could not evaluate that and surmised that " [LOC China  ] and [LOC Iran  ] must be talking to some extent . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: Chairman [PER Fortes  ] is one of a handful of [MISC Brazilian  ] legislators with serious concerns about [MISC Iranian  ] overtures in the region , which he sees as an effort to exploit [LOC Latin America  ] 's vulnerabilities to advance [MISC Iranian  ] interests by undermining the [LOC U.S.  ] in the region . 
As [PER Fortes  ] previously said ( ref B ) , there are many dots to connect that reveal a pattern of destabilizing efforts by [LOC Iran  ] . 
The statements by the [MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister , and the Deputy Petroleum Minister before him ( ref B ) , reveal the broad outlines of [LOC Iran  ] 's plan to foster hostility toward the [LOC U.S.  ] and reorient the region , working through [PER Chavez  ] , [PER Correa  ] , and [ORG Morales  ] . 
While the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] seeks a " correct " relationship with [LOC Iran  ] ( ref A ) , the [ORG Congress  ] has little power to influence the policy except by stalling ambassadorial appointments and appealing to public opinion , neither of which Senator [PER Fortes  ] has yet done . 
A significant development such as a visit by [PER Ahmedi-Nejad  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] could prompt him and a few others to demand explanations from the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] about its [LOC Iran  ] policy .
