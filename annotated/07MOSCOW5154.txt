Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: FM Lavrov’s disinterest in establishing an expert level dialogue on arms sales begs the question of how best to address our concerns over [MISC Russia’s  ] arms export policy . 
[MISC Russian  ] officials are deeply cynical about our motives in seeking to curtail [MISC Russian  ] arms exports to countries of concern and the threatened imposition of [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions has not proven successful so far in modifying [MISC Russian  ] behavior . 
[LOC Russia  ] attaches importance to the volume of the arms export trade , to the diplomatic doors that weapon sales open , to the ill-gotten gains that these sales reap for corrupt senior officials , and to the lever it provides the [MISC Russian  ] government in stymieing [MISC American  ] interests . 
While [LOC Russia  ] will reject out of hand arguments based on the extraterritorial application of [MISC American  ] sanctions , [MISC Russian  ] officials may be more receptive to a message couched in the context of [MISC Russian  ] international obligations and domestic legislation , the reality of [MISC American  ] casualties , and the backlash to [MISC Russian  ] strategic interests among moderate [MISC Sunni  ] governments . 
In making our argument , we should remember that [MISC Russian  ] officialdom and the public have little , if any , moral compunction about the arms trade , seeing it instead as a welcome symbol of [MISC Russia’s  ] resurgent power and strength in the world . 
End Summary ------------------------- [MISC Russian  ] Arms Sales Matter ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian  ] arms sales are consequential , totaling approximately [MISC USD  ] 6.7 billion in 2006 , according to official figures . 
This amount reflects a 12 percent increase over 2005 , and a 56 percent increase since 2003 . 
[MISC Russian  ] arms sales are expected to total at least [MISC USD  ] 8 billion in 2007 . 
[LOC Russia  ] has made a conscious effort to improve after-sales customer service and warranties , which has added to the attractiveness of its weapons . 
As a result , [MISC Russian  ] weapons command higher prices than previously . 
[LOC Russia  ] is ranked second only to the [LOC United States  ] in arms sales to the developing world , and a sizeable portion of its arms trade is with countries of concern to us. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While no sales were reported in 2006 to [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , or [LOC Sudan  ] , in 2007 [LOC Iran  ] reportedly paid [LOC Russia  ] [MISC USD  ] 700 million for [MISC TOR-M1  ] air defense missile systems . 
While [MISC Syrian  ] economic conditions are a natural brake on trade with the [MISC Russians  ] , as a matter of principle the [ORG GOR  ] is prepared to sell “defensive” equipment such as anti-tank missiles and [MISC Strelets  ] ( [MISC SA-18  ] ) surface-to-air missiles , as well as upgrade [MISC MiG-23  ] fighters . 
The [ORG GOR  ] barred the sale of [MISC Iskander-E  ] tactical missiles to [LOC Syria  ] only after intense international pressure . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] remains a growth market , with arms transfers in 2006 totaling more than [MISC USD  ] 1.2 billion , including 24 Su-30MK2 fighter-bombers and 34 helicopters . 
[LOC Russia  ] has an “open arms” approach to [LOC Venezuela  ] , and whether it’s the transfer of more than 72,000 [MISC AK-103  ] assault rifles or negotiations for the prospective sale of three [MISC Amur  ] class submarines ( valued at [MISC USD  ] 1 billion ) , [LOC Russia  ] is prepared to entertain Chavez’s grandiose regional visions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Defense experts emphasize that the [MISC American  ] and [MISC European  ] domination of traditional [ORG NATO  ] markets and capture of new entrants ( and old [MISC Soviet  ] customers ) from [LOC Central  ] and [ORG Eastern Europe  ] means that [LOC Russia  ] must court buyers that fall outside the [LOC U.S.  ] orbit . 
By definition , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] are good markets for [LOC Russia  ] because we don’t compete there. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While concrete numbers are hard to come by , our best figures indicate that [MISC Russian  ] arms sales to its traditional big-ticket customers -- [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] -- are growing . 
[MISC Russian  ] experts , however , predict a declining trajectory in the medium term . 
In 2006 , [LOC Russia  ] completed approximately [MISC USD  ] 1.4 billion in sales to [LOC China  ] , including eight diesel submarines and 88 [MISC MI-171’s  ] , which means the [LOC PRC  ] only narrowly edged out [PER Chavez  ] as [MISC Russia’s  ] most important customer . 
[MISC Russian  ] defense experts underscore that as China’s technological sufficiency and political influence grow , the [LOC PRC  ] will develop increasing military self-sufficiency and greater ability to challenge [LOC Russia  ] as a supplier . 
At the same time , sales to [LOC India  ] totaled only [MISC USD  ] 360 million . 
[LOC Russia  ] and [LOC India  ] , in fact , have signed arms deals worth [MISC USD  ] MOSCOW 00005154 002 OF 004 2.6 billion , but not all deliveries and payments have been made . 
While [MISC Russian  ] experts still downplay the ability of the [LOC U.S.  ] to displace [LOC Russia  ] in the [MISC Indian  ] arms market , for reasons of cost and the legacy of decades’ old dependence , they recognize increasing [MISC American  ] inroads and growing influence . 
Other notable [MISC Russian  ] markets include [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Czech Republic  ] , [LOC Vietnam  ] , [LOC South Korea  ] and [LOC Belarus.  ] ----------------------- A Legalistic World View ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) As the recent 2 2 consultations confirmed , [MISC Russian  ] officials defend arms sales to countries of concern in narrow legal terms . 
In answering our demarches , [ORG MFA  ] officials always identify whether the transfer is regulated by one of the multilateral arms controls regimes ( e.g . 
[ORG Wassenaar Group  ] , [ORG MTCR  ] , etc . 
) , [ORG UN  ] resolutions , or [MISC Russian  ] law . 
Senior officials maintain that [LOC Russia  ] does take into account the impact on the stability of the region in determining whether to sell weapons and shares our concern about weapons falling into terrorists’ hands . 
This [MISC Russian  ] decision-making process has led to a defacto embargo on weapons transfers to [LOC Iraq  ] , where [LOC Russia  ] is concerned over leakages to [MISC Iraqi  ] insurgents and [ORG Al-Qaida  ] ; to a hands-off policy towards [LOC Pakistan  ] , the country [LOC Russia  ] views as the greatest potential threat to regional stability ( with then-Russian Foreign Minister [PER Igor Ivanov  ] ruling out weapons sales to [LOC Pakistan  ] as far back as 2003 ) ; and to a moratorium on “offensive” systems to [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
Concern over leakage has prompted [LOC Russia  ] to tighten its export controls , with the recent institution of new provisions in arms sale contracts for [MISC Small Arms  ] and [ORG Light Weapons  ] ( [ORG SALW  ] ) that require end-user certificates and provide [LOC Russia  ] the right to inspect stockpiles of weapons sold. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) What [LOC Russia  ] has not done is accept our strategic calculus and rule out the possibility of sales to [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , or [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The arguments made are broadly similar: -- With [LOC Iran  ] , we are told that that [LOC Russia  ] will not sell any weapon that violates a multilateral or domestic regime , nor transfer any item that could enhance [MISC Iranian  ] WMD capabilities . 
Sales , such as the [MISC TOR-M1  ] air defense missile system , are justified as being defensive only , and limited by their range of 12 kilometers . 
While [PER DFM Kislyak  ] told us October 18 that he was unaware of any plans to sell [LOC Iran  ] the [MISC S-300  ] long-range surface-to-air missile system , [ORG MFA  ] officials previously told us that such sales , while under review , would not violate any [MISC Russian  ] laws or international regimes . 
-- With [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Russia  ] also argues that its transfers are defensive in nature , and points to its decision to halt the sale of [LOC MANPADS  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] maintains that [MISC Russian  ] weapons used by [ORG Hizballah  ] in 2006 were not a deliberate transfer by the [MISC Syrian  ] government , but involved weapons left behind when [MISC Syrian  ] forces withdrew from [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] argues that tightened end-user controls will prevent any future transfers . 
-- With [LOC Sudan  ] , the [ORG GOR  ] denies any current arms trade with the regime , and maintains that [LOC Russia  ] has not violated [ORG UN  ] sanctions or Putin-initiated decrees . 
However , based on our demarches , it is clear that -- in contrast to [LOC Syria  ] -- [LOC Russia  ] has adopted a “don’t ask , don’t tell” approach to Sudan’s adherence to its end-use requirements for its existing inventory of [MISC Russian/Soviet  ] weapons . 
-- With [LOC Venezuela  ] , both [ORG MFA  ] officials and [MISC Russian  ] experts believe that a “Monroe doctrine” mentality , and not real concerns over regional stability , is behind [LOC U.S.  ] demarches. ----------------------------------- What Is Behind the [MISC Russian  ] Calculus ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) A variety of factors drive [MISC Russian  ] arms sales , but a compelling motivation is profit - both licit and illicit . 
As former Deputy Prime Minister and senior member of the [ORG Duma Defense Committee  ] [PER Anatoliy Kulikov  ] told us , “Russia makes very bad cars , but very good weapons , ” and he was among the majority of [MISC Russian  ] defense experts who argued that the laws of comparative advantage would continue to propel an aggressive arms export policy . 
While [MISC Russian  ] defense budgets have been increasing 25-30 per cent for the last three years , defense experts tell us that export earnings still matter . 
The recent creation of [ORG RosTechnologiya State Corporation  ] , headed by [PER Putin  ] intimate [PER Sergey Chemezov  ] , which consolidates under state control RosOboronExport ( arms exports ) , [ORG Oboronprom  ] ( defense systems ) , [PER RusSpetsStal  ] ( specialized steel production ) , [ORG VSMPO  ] ( titanium producer ) , and [MISC Russian  ] [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005154 003 OF 004 helicopter production , is further proof of the importance the [PER Putin  ] government places on the industry. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Likewise , it is an open secret that the [MISC Russian  ] defense industry is an important trough at which senior officials feed , and weapons sales continue to enrich many . 
Defense analysts attribute [MISC Russia’s  ] decision to sell weapons that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] military objectively did not need due to the interest of both [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Russian  ] government officials in skimming money off the top . 
The sale of Su-30MK2 fighter-bombers was cited as a specific example where corruption on both ends facilitated the off-loading of moth-balled planes that were inadequate for the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Air Force’s needs. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) A second factor driving the [MISC Russian  ] arms export policy is the desire to enhance [MISC Russia’s  ] standing as a “player” in areas where [LOC Russia  ] has a strategic interest , like the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] officials believe that building a defense relationship provides ingress and influence , and their terms are not constrained by conditionality . 
Exports to [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] are part of a broader strategy of distinguishing [MISC Russian  ] policy from that of the [LOC United States  ] , and strengthening [MISC Russian  ] influence in international fora such as the Quartet or within the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
With respect to [LOC Syria  ] , [MISC Russian  ] experts believe that Bashar’s regime is better than the perceived alternative of instability or an [MISC Islamist  ] government , and argue against a [LOC U.S.  ] policy of isolation . 
[LOC Russia  ] has concluded that its arms sales are too insignificant to threaten [LOC Israel  ] , or to disturb growing [MISC Israeli-Russian  ] diplomatic engagement , but sufficient to maintain “special” relations with [LOC Damascus  ] . 
Likewise , arms sales to [LOC Iran  ] are part of a deep and multilayered bilateral relationship that serves to distinguish [LOC Moscow  ] from [LOC Washington  ] , and to provide [MISC Russian  ] officials with a bargaining chip , both with the [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] regime and its P5 1 partners . 
While , as a matter of practice , [MISC Russian  ] arms sales have declined as international frustration has mounted over the [MISC Iranian  ] regime , as a matter of policy , [LOC Russia  ] does not support what it perceives as [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to build an anti-Iranian coalition. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) A third and related factor lurking under the surface of these weapons sales is [MISC Russia’s  ] inferiority complex with respect to the [LOC United States  ] , and its quest to be taken seriously as a global partner . 
It is deeply satisfying to some [MISC Russian  ] policy-makers to defy [LOC America  ] , in the name of a multipolar world order , and to engage in zero-sum calculations . 
As [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC Georgia  ] have strengthened , so too have nostalgic calls for [MISC Russian  ] basing in [LOC Latin America  ] ( which [MISC Russian  ] officials , including [PER Putin  ] , have swat down ) . 
While profit is still seen by experts as [MISC Russia’s  ] primary goal , all note the secondary thrill of causing the [LOC U.S.  ] discomfort by selling weapons to anti-American governments in [LOC Caracas  ] and [LOC Damascus.  ] ---------------------------- Taking Another [MISC Run At  ] [LOC Russia  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As FM [PER Lavrov  ] made clear during the 2 2 consultations , [LOC Russia  ] will not engage systematically at the expert level on its arms export regime . 
While the prospect of [LOC Russia  ] changing its arms export policy in response to our concerns alone is slim , we can take steps to toughen our message and raise the costs for [MISC Russian  ] strategic decisions: -- Although [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions are broad brush , the more we can prioritize our concerns over weapons sales that pose the biggest threat to [LOC U.S.  ] interests , the more persuasive our message will be . 
Demarches that iterate all transactions , including ammunitions sales , are less credible . 
Since [PER Lavrov  ] has rejected an experts-level dialogue on arms transfers , it is important to register our concerns at the highest level , and to ensure that messages delivered in [LOC Moscow  ] are reiterated in [LOC Washington  ] with visiting senior [ORG GOR  ] officials . 
-- In the context of potential violations of international regimes and [ORG UNSCR  ] resolutions , [LOC Russia  ] needs to hear the concerns of key [MISC European  ] partners , such as [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] . 
( In the wake of the [PER Litvinenko  ] murder and subsequent recriminations , [LOC UK  ] influence is limited . 
) [ORG EU  ] reinforcement is important for consistency ( although [LOC Russia  ] tends to downplay the “bad news” that [MISC European  ] nations prefer to deliver in [ORG EU  ] channels , rather than bilaterally ) . 
-- Regional actors should reinforce our message . 
[MISC Russian  ] weapon sales that destabilize the [LOC Middle East  ] should be protested by the [PER Sunni Arab  ] governments that have the most to lose . 
Given [MISC Russia’s  ] competing interest in expanding sales [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005154 004 OF 004 to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] states , the protests of our moderate [MISC Arab  ] partners could also carry a price tag for [MISC Russian  ] defiance . 
The same is true for [LOC Latin America  ] , whose leaders to date have not made sales to [PER Chavez  ] an issue on their bilateral agenda with the [MISC Russians  ] . 
-- The appearance of [MISC Russian  ] weapons in [LOC Iraq  ] , presumably transferred by [LOC Syria  ] , and the prospect of [MISC American  ] and coalition casualties as a result could change the calculus of [MISC Russian  ] sales to [LOC Damascus  ] . 
The more evidence that we can provide , the more [LOC Russia  ] may take steps to restrict the Asad regime . 
At the same time , we need to be prepared for the [MISC Russian  ] countercharge that significant numbers of weapons delivered by the [LOC U.S.  ] have fallen into insurgent hands . 
-- Finally , providing the [MISC Russians  ] with better releasable intelligence when arguing against weapons transfers to rogue states is essential . 
Our [MISC Russian  ] interlocutors are not always impressed by the evidence we use to prove that their arms are ending up in the wrong hands . 
While we doubt [LOC Russia  ] will terminate all its problematic sales for the reasons described above , more compelling evidence could lead the [ORG GOR  ] to reduce the scope of its arms transfers or tighten export controls. ------------ Final Caveat ------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) There are few voices in [LOC Russia  ] who protest the sale of weapons to countries of concern and no domestic political constraints that tie the hands of [MISC Russian  ] policymakers on this score . 
The pride that [MISC Russian  ] officialdom takes in the arms industry as a symbol of [MISC Russia’s  ] resurgence is largely shared by average [MISC Russians  ] . 
[MISC American  ] concerns are interpreted cynically , as the disgruntled complaints of a competitor , and viewed through the prism of a 1990’s story line in which the [LOC West  ] seeks to keep [LOC Russia  ] down , including by depriving it of arms markets .
