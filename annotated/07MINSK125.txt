Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) A [MISC Russian-based  ] internet newspaper has been publishing a series of reports on alleged criminal rackets organized and/or headed by [PER Lukashenko  ] 's former Minister of [ORG Interior Sivakov  ] and commander of the President 's personal special forces unit [PER Pavlichenko  ] . 
Reliable Embassy contacts asserted that the allegations are true and provided more details on the corrupt dealings of these notorious characters . 
However , even if the claims are true , these men 's close relationship to [PER Lukashenko  ] and their participation in previous dirty deeds on his behalf virtually guarantee them protection from prosecution . 
Both men are on the [LOC U.S.  ] visa ban and asset freeze lists for their suspected involvement in the 1999-2000 disappearances of opposition leaders . 
End summary . 
[ORG BKGB Investigation Leads  ] to [PER Sivakov  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In late November 2006 , a generally reliable [MISC Russian-based  ] internet newspaper , " [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] , " reported that the [MISC Belarusian  ] [ORG KGB  ] 's special forces unit [ORG ALFA  ] raided the office of the pro-government association of veterans of special forces " [MISC Chyest  ] " ( Honor ) following an investigation into smuggling and money laundering . 
State media or GOB officials have not commented on this alleged incident . 
According to [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] , dozens of people were arrested , including the " [MISC Chyest  ] " executive director [PER Andrey Shirai  ] . 
However , the head of " [MISC Chyest  ] , " former Minister of [ORG Sports and Tourism  ] [PER Yuri Sivakov  ] , who [ORG Parliamentary Assembly  ] of the [ORG Council of Europe  ] ( [ORG PACE  ] ) [ORG Rapporteur  ] [PER Christos Pourgourides  ] cited in his 2003 report as a suspect in the 1999-2000 disappearances of several opposition activists , remains free , even after allegedly refusing to disclose the source of [MISC USD  ] 450,000 the [ORG BKGB  ] confiscated from his safe. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to reports from [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] , the raid on " [MISC Chyest  ] " headquarters was the result of an independent investigation into a customs house racket involving the illegal importation and transit of foodstuffs and appliances . 
In November 2006 , state and independent media reported that 50 border guards and customs officers in [LOC Minsk  ] and [LOC Grodno  ] were convicted and sentenced to prison for accepting bribes in exchange for letting 600 trucks cross the [MISC Belarusian  ] border between 2002 and 2004 without paying [MISC USD  ] 4.7 million in import duties . 
According to [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] , the [ORG BKGB  ] followed the money trail to a series of bank accounts totaling [MISC USD  ] 500 million , some of them belonging to " [MISC Chyest  ] " executive director [PER Shirai  ] . 
[ORG Shirai Washing GOB Officials' Money  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] investigative reporter [PER Ivan Kovalchuk  ] explained that [PER Sivakov  ] appointed [PER Shirai  ] as executive director of " [MISC Chyest  ] , " despite the latter 's previous convictions for theft and embezzlement . 
[PER Shirai  ] was apparently well known among the GOB elite and [ORG BKGB  ] as a money launderer for state construction companies , private businesses owned by government officials , and several GOB-controlled enterprises . 
[PER Kovalchuk  ] 's source noted that [PER Shirai  ] was very close to some [ORG BKGB  ] officials and members of the State Control Committee . 
" [MISC Chyest  ] " Rolling In the Dough ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [ORG BKGB  ] officers during the alleged raid confiscated [MISC USD  ] 430,000 in cash and the organization 's financial ledger , which revealed that " [MISC Chyest  ] 's " liquid financial assets were around [MISC USD  ] 890,000 . 
According to [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] , the [ORG BKGB  ] discovered that " [MISC Chyest  ] " was transferring approximately [MISC USD  ] 1.5 million dollars daily to financial institutions in [LOC Poland  ] , then to [LOC Russia  ] , and finally accumulating in the [LOC U.S.  ] , often in bank accounts under [PER Shirai  ] 's name . 
The Benefactors and the Source ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Former investigator for the public prosecutor 's department and now human rights activist [PER Oleg Volchek  ] supported the claims made in [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] 's reports . 
According to [PER Volchek  ] 's contacts in the [ORG BKGB  ] , not only was [PER Sivakov  ] a direct benefactor of the " [MISC Chyest  ] " racket , but money trails from the organization also led to senior [ORG National Assembly  ] deputies like [PER Vladimir Konoplyov  ] and senior [ORG Presidential Administration  ] figures , like deputy head [PER Natalya Petkevich.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Much of the money [PER Shirai  ] laundered allegedly came from Colonel [PER Dmitry Pavlichenko  ] and his [ORG SOBR  ] unit 's financial exploits ( see paragraph 9 ) . 
According to [PER Volchek  ] , [PER Pavlichenko  ] and his death squad , who operate under [PER Lukashenko  ] 's direct command , are the most powerful " krisha " ( roof ) or " protection " for businesses and generate a lot of revenue from bribes . 
( [PER Note: Pavlichenko  ] and his [ORG SOBR  ] unit were also cited in [ORG PACE Rapporteur  ] Pourgourides' report as the likely triggermen in the opposition leader disappearances and the physical liquidation of crime bosses shortly after [PER Lukashenko  ] 's rise to power . 
[PER Konoplyov  ] , [PER Petkevich  ] , and [PER Pavlichenko  ] are on the [LOC U.S.  ] visa ban list . 
[PER Petkevich  ] and [PER Pavlichenko  ] are also on the [LOC U.S.  ] asset freeze list . 
End note . 
) [ORG BKGB Abandons Case  ] , Passes It to [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Not long after news of the " [MISC Chyest  ] " raid surfaced , the [ORG BKGB  ] passed the case to the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] . 
[PER Volchek  ] believed that [ORG BKGB Head  ] [PER Stepan Sukharenko  ] , upon realizing whose money he was chasing , decided to back off . 
On January 31 , [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] indicated that [PER Sivakov  ] suddenly resigned as head of " [MISC Chyest  ] , " leaving command to [PER Pavlichenko  ] . 
[PER Sivakov  ] 's departure was allegedly due to personal conflicts with the [ORG SOBR  ] commander . 
[ORG OMON  ] riot police commander [PER Yuriy Podobed  ] ( also on the [LOC U.S.  ] visa ban and assets freeze lists ) followed suit , allegedly claiming that self-dignity would not allow him to continue work under [PER Pavlichenko  ] 's command . 
[PER Pavlichenko  ] 's Money Exchange Offers [ORG Poor Rates  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In mid-November , [PER Belaruskiy Partizan  ] also reported that [PER Pavlichenko  ] and his [ORG SOBR  ] unit severely beat a black market currency speculator on the steps of the [LOC Borisov  ] police station . 
Not long after the incident , political activist [PER Viktor Kornyenko  ] informed [ORG Poloff  ] that [PER Pavlichenko  ] was the main " krisha " in [LOC Borisov  ] and his victim failed to pay [PER Pavlichenko  ] bribes. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On January 18 , political analyst [PER Vladimir Podgol  ] shared with [ORG Poloff  ] information that he received from his contacts about the [PER Pavlichenko  ] incident in [LOC Borisov  ] . 
[PER Podgol  ] also alleged that [PER Pavlichenko  ] and his [ORG SOBR  ] unit has been operating a " krisha " for several business sectors , including money exchange . 
Lately , [PER Pavlichenko  ] 's tributes from money speculators in [LOC Borisov  ] decreased because a new group of speculators emerged that were giving customers better rates of exchange and , hence , stealing his business . 
The Shakedown , GoodFellas Style ------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) According to [PER Podgol  ] , [PER Pavlichenko  ] and his [ORG SOBR  ] unit attempted to arrest the leader of the competing money speculators as the latter was about to make a [MISC USD  ] 50,000 exchange . 
The speculator managed to escape to the police station but was caught by [PER Pavlichenko  ] before reaching the doors and a severe beating ensued . 
[PER Podgol  ] maintained that a female police officer ordered [PER Pavlichenko  ] to stop , but [PER Pavlichenko  ] , using graphic language , threatened to kill her . 
Once they finished beating the speculator , [PER Pavlichenko  ] and his men went to the speculator 's house and seized [MISC USD  ] 16,000 on top of the [MISC USD  ] 50,000 they had already confiscated . 
They then delivered the speculator to an undisclosed [LOC Minsk  ] detention facility , where he remains today , if not dead . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The allegations against [PER Sivakov  ] and [PER Pavlichenko  ] seem credible , given that both men have notorious reputations as criminals and , in [PER Pavlichenko  ] 's case , as murderers . 
The facts will likely never be fully revealed , given the obvious political sensitivities and the depth of corruption in the regime . 
However , both men truly owe their protection to their leader , President [PER Lukashenko  ] , on whose behalf they are suspected of committing heinous crimes .
