Gallagher  ] reasons 1.4 ( b ) a nd ( d ) . 
Mr. Secretary: -------- Overview: -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Your participation in the [MISC Regional Command-South  ] RC-South ) meeting and the bilateral with [MISC Dutch  ] Minister of Defense Emert van [PER Middelkoop  ] comes at a critical time for the advancement of key [LOC U.S.  ] priorities . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] government as a whole remain among our strongest allies , but [MISC Dutch  ] domestic politics threaten to limit progress on our common agenda . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the government faces an uphill battle to convince [ORG Parliament  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] people to continue combat missions after 2010. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] -- one of only two ministers from the smallest member of the coalition government , the [ORG Christian Union  ] ( [ORG CU  ] ) -- has a decidedly mixed record . 
He has vast foreign and security policy experience as a member of [ORG Parliament  ] . 
He is also widely recognized as the author of the [MISC Dutch  ] policy requiring parliamentary approval of military deployments overseas -- a result of the [MISC Dutch  ] failure to prevent the massacre at the [MISC Muslim  ] enclave of [LOC Srebrenica  ] in <a id='par1995' href='#par1995'>¶</a>1995 . 
At the same time , this is the first time the [ORG CU  ] and van [PER Middelkoop  ] have served in the government , and their lack of experience has been evident in several instances . 
In January , for example , [PER Van Middelkoop  ] first denied and then was forced to apologize for his remarks about the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He now almost exclusively reads aloud from written notes to avoid additional missteps . 
More influential voices on [LOC Afghanistan  ] policy are Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] of the [ORG Christian Democrat  ] party and Development Minister Koenders of the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( reflecting the [MISC Dutch  ] 3D [ORG Approach ( Development , Diplomacy and Defense  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During his June 10 bilateral meeting with you , [PER Van Middelkoop  ] will be interested in hearing more about new [LOC U.S.  ] command structures in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; the influx of [LOC U.S.  ] troops into [MISC RC-S  ] , including strategic objectives ; and initiatives on civil-military cooperation . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] will anticipate questions regarding the future of the [MISC Dutch  ] mission beyond August 2010 , although his comments will likely be guarded ahead of a late autumn cabinet decision on the issue . 
Among his public statements and misstatements , however , [PER Van Middelkoop  ] has suggested he believes the [MISC Dutch  ] will scale down their presence. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) For the June 11 [MISC RC-S  ] Ministerial , the [MISC Dutch  ] foresee an " " intimate " " atmosphere in a 1 3 format with delegates from the eight countries with troops in [MISC RC-S  ] . 
Besides [PER Van Middelkoop  ] and yourself , the principals will be Mr. [PER John Hutton  ] ( [LOC United Kingdom  ] ) , Mr. [PER Joel Fitzgibbon  ] ( [LOC Australia  ] ) , Mr. [PER Peter Kordon MacKay  ] ( [LOC Canada  ] ) , Mr. [PER Soren Gade  ] ( [LOC Denmark  ] ) , Mr. [PER Jaak Aaviksoo  ] ( [LOC Estonia  ] ) , and Mr. [PER Mihai Stanisoara  ] ( [LOC Romania  ] ) . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] envision an informal round-table discussion centered around three main agenda items: the evolution of [MISC RC-S  ] , training and Qthree main agenda items: the evolution of [MISC RC-S  ] , training and handover of responsibilities , and [MISC RC-S  ] engagement with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Prior to the round-table discussion , the [MISC Dutch  ] request that you begin the meeting with an overview of political developments to include the [LOC U.S.  ] review , the influx of [LOC U.S.  ] troops , and new leadership in the mission. ----------- [LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet is presently considering the [LOC Netherlands  ] , role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 , including our " " [LOC Afghanistan  ] Asks " " request ( Ref A ) . 
Senior officials have specifically requested that we give them the room to deliberate and come to their own decision , rather than applying any sort of public pressure . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] strongly supports that approach , particularly because we are on the right track for a good decision from the [MISC Dutch  ] if we move carefully. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) On receipt of the " " [LOC Afghanistan  ] Asks " " demarche , the Deputy Director General for Political Affairs , [PER Robert  ] de [PER Groot  ] , told us that most of the requests were very real possibilities ( Ref B ) . 
However , we omitted from the formal request the proposed [ORG Provisional Reconstruction Team  ] in the province of [LOC Dai Kundi  ] because [PER De Groot  ] had earlier advised us that such a request would hurt our cause as negotiations in the [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet proceed . 
Since that time , there have been two or three cabinet meetings on the issue . 
Subsequent staff-level comments have not been as optimistic as [PER De Groot  ] , s original remarks , so we are using every high-level meeting as opportunity to press the [LOC U.S.  ] request discreetly. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The international media has lauded the accomplishments of the " " [MISC Dutch  ] Model " " for Development , Diplomacy , and Defense ( 3D ) integrated efforts . 
This praise has been better received internationally than domestically where the public , although very supportive of the soldiers , does not strongly support their deployment . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have lost 19 soldiers to date , and [MISC Dutch  ] public believes they have done more than their fair share . 
Moreover , many [MISC Dutch  ] legislators are concerned about the effect of the deployment on military readiness and recruitment . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] still have a shortfall of approximately 7,000 personnel . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] media report that the [ORG ISAF  ] mission is not successful in bringing security to the region and many development programs are ineffective . 
The cabinet and the [ORG Parliament  ] will have to make very strong and convincing arguments to continue a strong commitment beyond 2010. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) A majority of the cabinet ( the [ORG Christian Democrats  ] and the [ORG Christian Union  ] ) is committed to the [ORG NATO/ISAF  ] mission and the [MISC Afghan  ] people . 
Throughout the cabinet 's decision process , the Prime Minister , the Foreign Minister and van [PER Middelkoop  ] will be strong and effective allies in winning support from the [ORG Parliament  ] . 
The political challenge lies with the [ORG Labor Party  ] , where Development Cooperation Minister Koenders will be the key player . 
Although part of the coalition , [ORG Labor  ] is the most skeptical of continuing ground engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 . 
For [ORG Labor  ] , s rank and file , the most compelling arguments are those that demonstrate how [MISC Dutch  ] efforts benefit the [MISC Afghan  ] people , rather than how essential the [MISC Dutch  ] military is for [ORG ISAF  ] success . 
The March 31 [ORG Afghanistan Conference  ] in The [ORG Hague  ] provided the cabinet a platform to portray its eventual decision as one that was consultative in nature , " " one among equals " " , and not one of " " request " " from the [LOC U.S.  ] or [ORG NATO  ] . 
This small point is very crucial in dealing with the [MISC Dutch  ] psyche and understanding their decision process . 
The cabinet [PER Qpsyche  ] and understanding their decision process . 
The cabinet will be very deft in announcing their decision which is expected in the fall . 
Cabinet approval for some sort of follow-on mission is only the first step . 
That plan then goes to [ORG Parliament  ] for approval . 
Although the coalition has sufficient votes to pass a plan , [MISC Dutch  ] consensus will require support from parties other than just those in the coalition . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] believes the cabinet and [ORG Parliament  ] will eventually agree to some follow-on mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , along the lines of our " " asks " " items , but the number of [MISC Dutch  ] military troops committed to a battle group will be reduced significantly and it will step down as lead nation for [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] . 
There is little information being provided by the decision makers but what is received indicates that the [MISC Dutch  ] will commit to all of the " " asks " " with the exception that the funding levels may be lower. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) From ref A , the specific " " asks " " delivered to the [LOC Netherlands  ] were: - Contribute to fulfillment of [ORG Election Support Force  ] requirements for [MISC Regional Command-South  ] - Retain PRT , OMLTs , [ORG Special Operations Forces  ] , and critical enablers in [LOC Uruzgan Province  ] beyond 2010 - [ORG Special Operations Task Group  ] with [ORG Rotary Wing Lift  ] to conduct military training and mentoring - Contribute $20 million per year for five years to the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG National Army Trust Fund  ] - Support counter-narcotics initiatives including the [MISC GPI  ] , training the [ORG Counter-Narcotics Police of Afghanistan  ] , and funding [ORG Counter-Narcotics Advisory Teams  ] - Deploy gendarmerie for training and mentoring [MISC Afghan  ] police - Contribute $10 million/year for the [ORG ARTF  ] and work with [MISC RC-S  ] partners to contribute resources to promote regional agriculture and power development - Continued training and contribution of fully-formed police mentor teams for districts in [LOC Uruzgan Province  ] to all future cycles of [ORG Focused District Development  ] - Increased support for governance and development programs at [LOC PRTs  ] , including additional civilian experts with access to programming resources ---- [ORG JSF  ] ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] have gone to the brink as [ORG JSF  ] partners . 
In a bitter late-April political debate , the [ORG Labor Party  ] forced a compromise to purchase only one of the planned two [MISC OT&E  ] aircraft , and delay the decision on the purchase of the second test aircraft until 2010 , and delayed the decision to buy 85 [ORG JSF  ] aircraft from 2010 to 2012 . 
Although strongly supported by State Secretary of Defense DeVries , [ORG JSF  ] will likely continue to face headwinds in the [ORG Parliament  ] for some time to come. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) More broadly , the [ORG JSF  ] compromise could indirectly threaten the [MISC Dutch  ] decision to stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
The [ORG Labor Party  ] , already skeptical on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , is viewed as having lost the [ORG JSF  ] debate and several other policy issues . 
Looking for a victory , the [ORG Labor Party  ] may thus make negotiations over [LOC Afghanistan  ] more difficult. -------- [ORG LAIRCM  ] -------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The recent approval by [ORG OSD  ] to grant an exception to [ORG LAIRCM  ] release policy for [MISC Dutch  ] KDC-10 aircraft presents an opportunity to reiterate appreciation for [MISC Dutch  ] efforts and shared risks in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , along with the hope that a significant contribution of [MISC Dutch  ] military capabilities will continue beyond 2010. ------------------------------- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( [ORG UAV  ] ) ------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG SAF/IA  ] recently approved exchange of two [ORG Dutch Air Force  ] operators into an operational [ORG UAV  ] squadron at [LOC Nellis AFB  ] , if the [LOC Netherlands  ] agree to purchase MQ-1 or MQ-9 UAVs within the next twelve to eighteen months . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] move towards this type of system is borne out of their experience in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Should this offer be accepted by the [LOC Netherlands  ] , it will the first of its kind for UAVs .
