<code><pre>Monday , 19 October 2009 , 11:29 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 [ORG KAMPALA  ] 001197 SIPDIS FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY [PER CARSON  ] FROM AMBASSADOR LANIER EO 12958 DECL: 10/18/2019 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PINS , PHUM , EAID , KDEM , UG SUBJECT: UGANDA: SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY [PER CARSON Classified  ] By: Ambassador [PER Jerry Lanier  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Under  ] President [MISC Museveni’s  ] leadership , [LOC Uganda  ] has become a confident and outspoken regional leader through its military role in [LOC Somalia  ] ( which up to now has preserved the [ORG TFG  ] as a moderate alternative to [MISC Islamic  ] extremism ) , its effective campaign against the [ORG LRA  ] and its related commitment to rebuild northern [LOC Uganda  ] . 
Yet the [MISC President’s  ] autocratic tendencies , as well as Uganda’s pervasive corruption , sharpening ethnic divisions , and explosive population growth have eroding Uganda’s status as an [MISC African  ] success story . 
Holding a credible and peaceful presidential election in February 2011 could restore Uganda’s image , while failing in that task could lead to domestic political violence and regional instability . 
It is too early to tell whether the deadly September 10-12 riots in [LOC Kampala  ] are the beginning of a massive and open-ended effort for political change in [LOC Uganda  ] , or will lead to a more productive internal dialogue and a stronger democracy . 
The path of [MISC Ugandan  ] politics over the next eighteen months depends largely on the [MISC President’s  ] vision and leadership . 
Your visit will be crucial in conveying [LOC US  ] views and policy on [LOC Uganda  ] and [LOC East Africa  ] , and in raising the [MISC President’s  ] awareness about how seriously [MISC Western  ] governments will be following the course of democracy in [LOC Uganda  ] in the coming months . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------- Elections and Uganda’s Fading Democracy --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Uganda  ] under President [PER Yoweri Museveni  ] and his [ORG National Resistance Movement  ] ( [ORG NRM  ] ) has made remarkable progress over the past 23 years . 
The country has gone from total economic collapse in the aftermath of [PER Idi Amin’s  ] despotism to being an [MISC African  ] success story , building unprecedented domestic peace , economic growth , and making substantial progress towards democracy . 
Yet [PER Museveni  ] and the [ORG NRM  ] have not fully embraced multiparty politics or allowed meaningful political alternatives . 
They are now more entrenched in government and state institutions than during the days of his “no-party” system . 
The NRM’s near total accumulation of power has led to poor governance , corruption , and rising ethnic tensions , a combination that threatens [MISC Ugandan  ] “democracy” and stability. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Opposition political parties , however , are fractured , politically immature , and greatly outnumbered in Parliament . 
They control no government ministries , and are not skillful using either press or protest , their primary political tools . 
Nor can the opposition provide a coherent and attractive platform of proposals to counter the [ORG NRM  ] . 
And it is by no means clear the opposition would improve governance in [LOC Uganda  ] in any way . 
Currently , a coalition of all but one of Uganda’s main opposition parties looks likely to nominate a joint opposition candidate for 2011 , probably the leader of the [ORG Forum for Democratic Change  ] ( [ORG FDC  ] ) [PER Kizza Besigye  ] , who lost to [PER Museveni  ] in 2001 and 2006 . 
This coalition is demanding the dissolution of the partisan [ORG Electoral Commission  ] constituted by [PER Museveni  ] , and the acceptance of specific electoral reforms . 
Since [PER Museveni  ] now appears unlikely to yield on either count , opposition parties and the government seem destined for another turbulent showdown as elections approach in early 2011. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Although the press and civil society have enjoyed relative freedom under the [ORG NRM  ] , harassment and intimidation of those critical of the [PER Museveni  ] regime has risen in recent years . 
Up to a dozen journalists and media outlets were charged with sedition and/or shut down by authorities for allegedly inciting recent riots that left up to 27 dead and more than 100 injured. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ethnic tensions , always present in [LOC Uganda  ] in varying degrees , have also sharpened as [PER Museveni  ] and politicians on all sides have cultivated ethnic-based support . 
Tensions among groups residing along the oil-rich shores of [LOC Lake Albert  ] flared in August after [PER Museveni  ] suggested restricting elective offices there to one specific ethnic group . 
The September riots were sparked in part by [ORG Museveni’s  ] decision to support a small ethnic group’s bid for autonomy within the [LOC Buganda Kingdom  ] . 
The underlying conflict derives from Buganda’s persistent attempt for a greater political role , with the ultimate goal of establishing a [MISC Bugandan  ] monarchy within the [MISC Ugandan  ] state , which [PER Museveni  ] has repeatedly stated he will not allow . 
The [MISC President’s  ] view is that [ORG KAMPALA  ] 00001197 002 OF 004 “Kings” are unelected and would lack political accountability . 
Indeed a semi-autonomous internal state would not only be a political threat to him but could also ultimately threaten [LOC Uganda  ] as a unified nation-state . 
The stalemate over this issue continues , with no resolution in sight. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Museveni’s  ] heavy-handedness and the corruption of senior leaders have sparked dissent within the [ORG NRM  ] . 
A group of [ORG NRM  ] “rebels” consisting of about 15 younger , mostly back-bencher MPs supports opposition demands for an impartial [ORG Electoral Commission  ] and is critical of [MISC Museveni’s  ] unwillingness to hold senior [ORG NRM  ] leaders - such as Security Minister [PER Mbabazi  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Kutesa  ] , and Trade Minister Otafiire among others - accountable for corruption allegations . 
[PER Museveni  ] also faces a challenge from some older party stalwarts - generally the same senior [ORG NRM  ] leaders accused of corruption - who fought with him in the “bush war” and want to succeed him as President . 
Press reports and anecdotal evidence suggest the President is increasingly isolated and unaware of the depth of resentment both within the [ORG NRM  ] and among society as a whole. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our message: Conducting free , fair and peaceful elections in February 2011 would reinforce Uganda’s image as an [MISC African  ] success story . 
Failure in this area could relegate [LOC Uganda  ] to the list of unstable [MISC African  ] nations , seriously jeopardize its future stability , and make it more difficult for the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue as a strong security partner . 
To hold credible elections , [PER Museveni  ] must address the perceived partisanship of the [ORG Electoral Commission  ] and make meaningful electoral reform within the next four months. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Even if the President begins now to make good faith efforts to hold free and fair elections , he still may be unable to prevent serious , even stability threatening violence around the 2011 elections . 
The opposition is privately threatening violence and it is difficult to discern what the President could do now that would satisfy the political desires of so many who have been excluded from politics for so long. --------------------------------------------- Other [ORG Challenges: Human Rights and Corruption  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Uganda  ] has made great strides in protecting human rights since the disasters of the 1970s and 1980s , yet the government’s recent record is poor , particularly with respect to arbitrary arrest , detention , torture , and lengthy pre-trial detention . 
One encouraging sign is the eagerness of the [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] and senior leaders of the [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG People’s Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG UPDF  ] ) and police to divulge , investigate , and prosecute human rights abuses . 
The [ORG UPDF  ] and police have clearly improved their efforts to hold personnel accountable for abuses . 
However , there remains numerous , credible allegations of unlawful detention and torture by the [ORG Joint Ant-Terrorism Taskforce  ] ( [ORG JATT  ] ) , the [ORG Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence  ] ( [ORG CMI  ] ) , the police’s [ORG Rapid Response Unit  ] ( [ORG RRU  ] ) , and other para-military outfits . 
These allegations severely undermine progress in other areas . 
Overall it is clear that neither the law enforcement institutions nor the judiciary are capable of restraining government excesses in either corruption or abuse of human rights. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Uganda’s anti-corruption record is not impressive . 
In 2007 , the [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation  ] ( [ORG MCC  ] ) initiated a threshold program to combat corruption . 
Implemented by [ORG USAID  ] , the program worked with the Auditor General , the [ORG Inspectorate General of Government  ] , the [ORG Public Procurement and Disposal Authority  ] , the [ORG Department of Public Prosecutions  ] ( [ORG DPP  ] ) , the [ORG Department of Criminal Investigations  ] , and the newly created [ORG Anti-Corruption Court  ] to improve oversight and increase the number of corruption related prosecutions . 
Although the program dramatically increased the capacity of [MISC Uganda’s  ] corruption fighting agencies , [ORG MCC  ] canceled it for 2010 due to lack of political will at the highest levels of the government . 
Impunity at high levels of government continues , diminishing trust in the regime and the public’s faith in democracy. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our message: While the [ORG UPDF  ] and the Police have made progress in professionalizing their forces and in establishing systems to prevent , investigate , and prosecute human rights abuses , the [ORG GOU  ] needs to extend this effort to paramilitary organizations that are accused of abuses . 
[ORG KAMPALA  ] 00001197 003 OF 004 Continued abuses by these agencies severely damage the credibility and reputation of Uganda’s political leadership . 
On corruption: The President must lead from the top and hold senior leaders accountable when there is credible evidence of corruption . 
Despite Uganda’s economic success , GDP growth could be much higher by reducing corruption. ---------------------------------- Peace and Security Part I: [LOC Somalia  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Museveni  ] believes a stable [LOC Somalia  ] is necessary for peace and stability in [LOC East Africa  ] . 
As head of the [ORG Intergovernmental Authority  ] on [ORG Development ( IGAD  ] ) in 2005-2006 , [PER Museveni  ] oversaw the birth of the [ORG Somali Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) and its institutions , and lived up to his commitment to support it with the initial deployment to [LOC Mogadishu  ] of a 1,700-man [ORG UPDF Battle Group  ] in March 2007 . 
As the vanguard of an [ORG African Union Mission  ] in [LOC Somalia  ] ( [ORG AMISOM  ] ) , the [ORG Battle Group  ] deployed alone , albeit with USG assistance . 
The [ORG UPDF  ] deployed an additional “augmentation” battalion in early 2009 to bring its total peacekeepers on the ground to 2,750 , with plans to add a fourth battalion in late 2009. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to the [ORG UPDF  ] , 45 [MISC Ugandan  ] soldiers have died due to roadside bombs , suicide attacks , and non-combat related illness while serving in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
The most recent deaths occurred on September 17 when [PER Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Shabaab  ] extremists successfully attacked the [ORG AMISOM  ] HQ building , killing five [MISC Ugandans  ] among others . 
However , the [ORG UPDF’s  ] and Government of Uganda’s commitment to the mission remains unshaken. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our message: Uganda’s commitment to [ORG AMISOM  ] and the professionalism of the [ORG UPDF  ] has made [LOC Uganda  ] one of our primary partners in the fight against terrorism . 
We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with [ORG AMISOM  ] and will continue to support the [ORG UPDF’s  ] deployment in [LOC Mogadishu  ] . 
We encourage the [ORG GOU  ] to deploy its augmentation battalion shortly and wish to discuss specifically how we can support and equip this and future deployments. -------------------------------------------- Peace and Security Part II: [ORG LRA  ] and [LOC Karamoja  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Uganda’s long-term stability is linked to the resolution of the 22-year-old [ORG LRA  ] insurgency , finding viable solutions to other regional conflicts , and preventing the spread of extremism . 
In December 2008 , a joint military operation code named [MISC Operation Lightning Thunder  ] destroyed the [ORG LRA  ] base camp in [LOC Garamba Park  ] in the [ORG DRC  ] and scattered the [ORG LRA  ] across the [ORG DRC  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , and [ORG CAR  ] . 
It failed in capturing or killing [ORG LRA  ] leaders , including [PER Joseph Kony  ] , although [ORG UPDF  ] follow-up has eliminated most of the [MISC LRA’s  ] fighting capacity . 
While [ORG LRA  ] elements still attack civilian populations and raid supplies in the tri-border area between [ORG DRC  ] , [ORG CAR  ] , and [LOC Sudan  ] , the [ORG LRA  ] and [PER Kony  ] are under severe pressure and greatly weakened. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Northern [LOC Uganda  ] has been at peace for three years and continues to recover and rebuild from the [MISC LRA’s  ] abduction of over 40,000 children and displacement of an estimated 1.8 million people in the [LOC Acholi  ] , [LOC Lango  ] , [LOC Teso  ] , and [MISC West-Nile  ] sub-regions . 
Improved security in the north , the [MISC GOU’s  ] pursuit of a formal peace agreement , and government’s national Peace , Recovery and [ORG Development Plan  ] ( [ORG PRDP  ] ) have led to an estimated 80 percent of internally-displaced persons ( [ORG IDPs  ] ) to return or move closer to their homes . 
The return of [ORG IDPs  ] highlights the need to support programs that provide for reconciliation , social and economic development , and security. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Karamoja  ] is Uganda’s most insecure region due to conflicts between local nomadic groups with a history of cattle-rustling . 
Conflict is also fueled by an influx of small arms , largely from southern [LOC Sudan  ] and [LOC Kenya  ] . 
At its peak , conflict in the region displaced an estimated 125,000 Karamojong people . 
The Government increased its military presence in [LOC Karamoja  ] , engaged local leaders , and in 2008 launched the [ORG Karamoja Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan  ] ( [ORG KIDDP  ] ) to promote security and recovery . 
These actions have improved security . 
Nonetheless , large areas of [LOC Karamoja  ] are under-policed and violence resulting for cattle raids persists . 
[ORG KAMPALA  ] 00001197 004 OF 004 <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our message: We commend the [MISC GOU’s  ] efforts to bring about a resolution to the 22-year old conflict with the [ORG LRA  ] , and will continue to support [ORG GOU  ] efforts to defeat the [ORG LRA  ] and rebuild northern [LOC Uganda  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] supports the [ORG PRDP  ] and in 2008 provided $163 million in assistance to the north . 
We are providing a similar amount this year . 
We strongly encourage the [ORG GOU  ] to make good on its pledge to fund the [ORG PRDP  ] and to take the lead in developing northern [LOC Uganda  ] . 
We encourage [LOC Uganda  ] to continue talking with its neighbors , particularly the [ORG DRC  ] and southern [LOC Sudan  ] , to resolve regional security problems. ------------------------------ [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] and Population Growth ------------------------------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) The long war against the [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] epidemic is at a crossroads . 
Under Museveni’s leadership , [LOC Uganda  ] was a pioneer in recognizing and taking action against [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] in the 1990s . 
Prevalence rates plunged from nearly 20 percent then to under seven percent today . 
But incidence is rising again in the context of a rapidly expanding population and complacency from both the [ORG GOU  ] and the population at large . 
Much of Uganda’s success since 2004 is the success of [ORG PEPFAR  ] , which began to ramp up that year . 
But [MISC Ugandan  ] complacency is also partly a legacy of [ORG PEPFAR  ] , which , by scaling up so rapidly and often bypassing [ORG GOU  ] entities , created donor dependence and diminished incentives for [ORG GOU  ] leadership , which had existed pre-PEPFAR. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Population trends in [LOC Uganda  ] are a demographic time bomb that will destroy the country’s economic and social gains . 
Few countries in the world are growing as fast as [LOC Uganda  ] . 
At current trends , Uganda’s population will double ( from 30 to 60 million ) in 20 years and reach 130 million by 2050 . 
If unabated , this surge in population will stress the natural environment and exceed the government’s ability to provide basic health and education services , resulting in chronic and extreme political instability and social unrest As [ORG PEPFAR  ] policy transitions from care and use of anti-retrovirals to focusing on prevention , government leadership will be even more important. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our message: We recognize and commend President Museveni’s previous commitment to combating the spread of [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] . 
However , infection rates are once again rising . 
[LOC Uganda  ] urgently needs to renew its effort to fight [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] and simultaneously address the nation’s runaway population growth. ------------------------------ [MISC Economic Opportunities  ] and [ORG Oil  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Museveni  ] is dedicated to an enlarged [MISC East African Community  ] , to liberalizing the [MISC Ugandan  ] economy , to containing inflation , and to promoting economic growth and foreign investment . 
Foreign debt has dropped from over $6 billion in 2004 to less than $1 billion through debt relief programs and prudent borrowing habits . 
The pace of economic growth has remained consistent over the last 21 years with annual GDP growth rates between five and eight percent . 
Museveni’s commitment to the [ORG African Growth and Opportunities Act  ] ( [ORG AGOA  ] ) is unwavering . 
Unreliable power , inadequate transport infrastructure , and corruption , however , need immediate attention , as they seriously limit economic development and investor confidence in [LOC Uganda.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In October 2006 , [MISC Canadian  ] firm [ORG Heritage Oil  ] announced the first oil discovery on the shores of [LOC Lake Albert  ] . 
The [MISC British  ] firm [ORG Tullow Oil  ] , has made major discoveries both around and under [LOC Lake Albert  ] , and has plans to begin producing and exporting crude oil by mid-2010 . 
Libya’s TamOil is the primary investor in a proposed pipeline from [LOC Uganda  ] to [LOC Kenya  ] to import fuel , and possibly export crude . 
[MISC Chinese  ] firms are also interested in expanding investments in Uganda’s oil . 
The [ORG Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation  ] ( [ORG NORAD  ] ) is funding a feasibility study for a refinery in [LOC Uganda  ] . 
Exxon/Mobile is considering a visit to [LOC Uganda  ] later this year. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our message: Uganda’s oil resources could and should be a boon for economic development and make the country less dependent on foreign assistance . 
We wish to support transparent management and prudent investment of oil wealth in the years ahead .
