( C ) On February 22 , local press reported that [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Iran  ] had established a joint venture company to develop gas in [LOC Iran  ] and build a pipeline to bring this gas to [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
This JV was established to further the agreements reached in November 2008 and July 2007 MOUs between [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Iran  ] ( reftel ) . 
In trying to undercover more about this deal , we spoke with several people . 
[ORG BOTAS  ] Chairman [PER Saltuk Duzyol  ] said [ORG BOTAS  ] was not included in the deal and that the agreement was made with a private company but declined to specify it . 
One of Energy Minister [PER Guler  ] 's advisors , [PER Musa Gunaydin  ] , who is widely believed to be behind the Minister 's push to do business with [LOC Iran  ] refused to discuss the topic with us. xxxxx was more open . 
The [MISC Turkish  ] company [ORG SOM Petrol  ] has entered into a joint venture with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Demir  ] said . 
The owner of [ORG SOM Petrol  ] is [PER Sitki Ayan  ] , a good friend of PM [PER Erdogan  ] . 
They both attended [LOC Istanbul  ] [PER Imam Hatip  ] ( religious high school ) . 
[PER Ayan  ] is in the PM 's circle of friends including [PER Mustafa Erdogan  ] ( PM 's brother ) , [PER Cihan Kamer  ] ( see para 2 ) and [PER Mucahit Aslan.  ] xxxxx . 
According to our research , xxxxx is active in port construction , fuel transshipments and other activities but doesn't appear to have any experience in upstream oil and gas development. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In 2007 , [PER Kartet  ] , an electricity generation and exporting company , signed a deal with [LOC Tavanir  ] , [LOC Iran  ] 's state owned electricity company to import from [LOC Iran  ] 1.4 billion kilowatt hours ( kWh ) of electricity to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER Kartet  ] applied to the [MISC Turkish  ] authorities ( the [ORG Electricity Markets Regulatory Board  ] , [ORG EMRA  ] ) to get an electricity import license . 
In November 2007 , a [MISC Turkish  ] company called [ORG Savk Electricity  ] , owned by PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's friend [PER Cihan Kamer  ] , received a license from [ORG EMRA  ] to import electricity from [LOC Iran  ] . 
At that time , [PER Kartet  ] went public with the dispute and claimed [ORG Savk  ] action 's were unethical and illegal . 
[PER Kartet  ] [LOC Istanbul  ] Managing Director [PER Nuray Atacik  ] told us on February 27 that [PER Kartet  ] had still not received any response from [ORG EMRA  ] and had basically given up on the project . 
However , she added with a bit of glee , [ORG Savk Electricity  ] has not been able to realize the deal either. “The [MISC Iranians  ] prefer us and don't want to do a deal with a company that was forced on them , ” [PER Atacik  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: If true , the PM 's push of [ORG SOM Petrol  ] to do the gas deal with [LOC Iran  ] could actually slow progress on the deal . 
It is clear from the [ORG Savk Electricity  ] case that [LOC Iran  ] doesn't appreciate being assigned business partners . 
There are other reasons why this deal is on the slow-track , including lack of legal , regulatory and commercial framework for the deal and [LOC Iran  ] 's potential pique at the February 26 announcement that [ORG BOTAS  ] won a USD 750 million arbitration case against [LOC Iran  ] ( although the award must still be accepted by [MISC Iranian  ] authorities ) .
