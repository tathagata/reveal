End Summary . 
Transparency With [LOC India  ] ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Special Representative [PER Holbrooke  ] met with [MISC Indian  ] Foreign Secretary [PER Nirupama Rao  ] for nearly two hours over breakfast on January 18 to exchange views on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] said at the outset that the important underlying principle of his visits to [LOC India  ] is the need for complete transparency on [LOC U.S.  ] activities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He noted that he comes with a clear vision of the centrality of [LOC India  ] to the strategic landscape in the region . 
He reiterated that his portfolio explicitly excludes [LOC India  ] , policy for which rests with [ORG SCA Blake  ] and Ambassador [PER Roemer  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] was accompanied in the meeting by Ambassador [PER Roemer  ] and SRAP Advisor [PER Vali Nasr  ] . 
[PER Rao  ] was joined by Joint Secretary ( [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] ) [PER Sinha  ] and Joint Secretary ( [ORG Americas  ] ) [PER Gaitri Kumar  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] Briefing on [LOC Afghanistan  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] said that the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] continues to be difficult but the situation has been stabilized , primarily as a result of the President’s politically courageous decision of more than tripling the number of [MISC American  ] troops in the country . 
In his view , the [LOC Afghanistan  ] Presidential election cast a shadow on 2009 . 
The election was untidy , but it produced a legitimate President . 
[PER Rao  ] offered that there was less fraud and rigging in this election than in previous post-Taliban [MISC Afghan  ] elections. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The agenda for 2010 , according to [PER Holbrooke  ] , is to strengthen the government . 
On the security side the effort will be to improve the army and police , primarily through unified [ORG ISAF  ] training instead of dispersed and uncoordinated training by many countries . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] described this as the most important part of the international challenge . 
[PER Rao  ] accepted his offer of a detailed joint State/Pentagon briefing on the redesigned training plan for the [MISC Afghan  ] army and police. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] said that on the civilian side , the number one priority is agriculture because it produces the quickest payoff . 
He noted that investment in mining , power , and other sectors is important but the gestation and payback periods are longer . 
Besides , he observed , [LOC Afghanistan  ] has traditionally been an agricultural export country , with [LOC India  ] as its biggest market . 
With revival of an agricultural credit bank and other agriculture support programs , the NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000163 002 OF 004 international community expects a quick return in terms of employment and incomes in rural areas . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] described this as a sharp contrast with the previous administration , which focused on poppy eradication . 
On narcotics , the [ORG USG  ] effort now is to target the traffickers and the kingpins , not ordinary farmers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Rao  ] responded that supporting [MISC Afghan  ] agriculture is a high priority for [LOC India  ] as well , with Joint Secretary [PER Sinha  ] on his way to [LOC Kabul  ] on January 19 to explore opportunities to build [MISC Afghan  ] capacities in this sector . 
She noted that the [MISC GOI  ] is considering establishment of an agriculture college and enhanced training , in part through scholarships to [MISC Indian  ] agricultural colleges . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] offered to arrange a briefing for [PER Sinha  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] on the [MISC USG’s  ] agriculture support programs and plans . 
[MISC Indian  ] Approach to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Rao  ] described the [MISC Indian  ] effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a focus on strengthening governance by building [MISC Afghan  ] capacities through training and infrastructure such that the country can develop a functional administration . 
In her view , the international community should resist the temptation to micromanage in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Instead , the effort should be to build institutions and let them manage the country . 
[PER Rao  ] observed that [LOC India  ] has the resources and the willingness to assist [LOC Afghanistan  ] and is prepared to explore areas that the may assist the [LOC U.S.  ] effort. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Rao  ] observed that each year the [MISC GOI  ] provides about 1,300 scholarship to [MISC Afghans  ] for education and training and is considering increasing this number sharply . 
She noted that security assistance was minimal , limited to 150 training scholarships to [MISC Afghan  ] army personnel in various [MISC Indian  ] Army training facilities , including the [ORG Staff College  ] . 
[PER Rao  ] readily agreed to Holbrooke’s request for a briefing on [MISC Indian  ] training for [MISC Afghan  ] security personnel , emphasizing that this engagement is completely transparent . 
She supported her argument by noting that the [MISC GOI  ] had previously provided a detailed briefing on this at the [ORG U.S.-India Defense Policy Group  ] meetings. “We have nothing to hide , ” she declared . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] assured [PER Rao  ] that he is in favor of [MISC Indian  ] assistance programs in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and is not influenced by what he hears in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
Reintegration ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Rao  ] and [PER Sinha  ] raised grave concerns about [ORG Taliban  ] reintegration plans currently under discussion . 
[PER Sinha  ] argued that no amount of monetary incentives would induce the [ORG Taliban  ] to alter its core beliefs of intolerance and militancy . 
He was particularly troubled by the [MISC British  ] plan which , in his view , takes [LOC Afghanistan  ] back to the pre-1990s . 
[PER Rao  ] expressed skepticism that such a plan would work unless [LOC Pakistan  ] changes its policy on supporting the [ORG Quetta Shura  ] and other [ORG Taliban  ] elements . 
She observed that it had failed to bring in the [MISC Maoists  ] in [LOC Nepal  ] and was likely to fail for similar reasons in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] explained that some of the anxiety stems from confusion between reintegration and reconciliation . 
He noted that the reintegration program is not a political negotiation designed to give [ORG Taliban  ] elements a share of power . 
The [LOC United States  ] cannot be a party to any such arrangement , in his view , because the [ORG Taliban  ] is allied with the [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and the social programs of the [ORG Taliban  ] are unpalatable . 
He noted further that the [ORG Taliban  ] leadership appears to have no interest in talking to the international community in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] also allayed [MISC Indian  ] concerns that UNSCR 1267 policy would be altered with respect to [ORG Taliban  ] and LET leaders such as [PER Mullah Omar  ] , [PER Gulubuddin Hekmatyar  ] , and [PER Hafiz Saeed.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] said it is important that the [MISC Afghan  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000163 003 OF 004 government have in place a program to respond to frequent ceasefire calls at the local level . 
Such a program should involve laying down of arms and commitments to participate peacefully in society . 
He outlined the public rollout of the reintegration plan , with a [MISC Karzai  ] announcement soon , to be followed by the [LOC London  ] conference where a reintegration fund would be established , and to be capped by a conference in [LOC Kabul  ] where funding pledges will be solicited . 
He urged [MISC Indian  ] support and contributions . 
[PER Rao  ] said reintegration could work if it is [MISC Afghan-led  ] , if it is painstaking in its selection , and if it involves real commitments to respect human rights and the constitution . 
She underscored her skepticism by noting , “these are big if’s.” Parliamentary Elections ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] identified the upcoming Parliamentary election as the most important political event of 2010 . 
He offered the [ORG USG  ] view that the election be postponed to the fall because of inadequate preparation and insufficient [ORG ISAF  ] troops on the ground to ensure a peaceful and smooth election in May . 
He noted that [MISC Afghan  ] law allows for such changes in election dates . 
He requested India’s support for this proposal . 
[PER Rao  ] responded that it must remain the [MISC Afghan  ] Government’s responsibility to make the call on postponement of elections. “Unlike [LOC Pakistan  ] , we do not interfere in the affairs of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , ” she quipped with a smile . 
She offered [MISC Indian  ] assistance in administering the elections . 
[ORG Pakistan Role  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Rao  ] said that [LOC Afghanistan  ] has the potential to prosper as a hub or transit point for energy , agriculture and trade if it could be connected to its natural market in [LOC India  ] . 
She said it was unfortunate that [LOC Pakistan  ] does not allow this to happen . 
She asked that the [LOC U.S.  ] apply pressure on [LOC Pakistan  ] to stop supporting the [LOC Afghanistan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] and to allow [LOC Afghanistan  ] to develop through trade and commercial links . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] responded that [LOC Pakistan  ] views certain [ORG Taliban  ] groups , particularly the [ORG Quetta Shura  ] , as an insurance policy to protect its strategic interests in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and it is not clear that anyone can easily influence [LOC Pakistan  ] to turn on these groups , although the [LOC U.S.  ] is exerting tremendous pressure . 
[PER Rao  ] said she was alarmed at this continued [LOC Pakistan  ] support for terrorist groups , noting that the LET was “ideologically fused” with both the [ORG Quetta Shura  ] and the [PER Haqqani  ] network . 
As evidence , she pointed to the [PER Haqqani  ] group’s 2008 bombing of the [MISC Indian  ] Embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
She was also disturbed at the length to which [LOC Pakistan  ] had gone to exclude [LOC India  ] from the [LOC Istanbul  ] conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , citing it as an example of unwarranted [MISC Pakistani  ] insecurity over [MISC Indian  ] intentions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Citing the [MISC USG’s  ] own difficulties in dealing with the [LOC Pakistan  ] government , [PER Holbrooke  ] suggested that many people overestimate the [LOC U.S.  ] influence in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[MISC India-Pakistan Relations  ] ----------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Rao  ] expressed concern that there has been a sharp increase in unseasonal Pakistan-inspired violence and preparation for violence . 
She pointed to incidents of cross-border shelling along the line of control and in [LOC Punjab  ] , increased infiltration , and transfer of terrorist hardware . 
They are clearly trying to “stir the pot” in [LOC Kashmir  ] , she added . 
In her view , [LOC Pakistan  ] is trying to deflect attention to its eastern border from the [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] border , where the focus ought to be . 
Yet , [PER Rao  ] argued , [LOC India  ] has not turned its back to [LOC Pakistan  ] but needs some [MISC Pakistani  ] progress on terrorism to reengage . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] noted that [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] working together is obviously in the interests of the region and the international community . 
He said that Foreign Minister [PER Qureshi  ] was very pleased at the phone call with Foreign Minister [PER Krishna  ] . 
He reassured [PER Rao  ] that he understands NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000163 004 OF 004 clearly where the [LOC U.S.  ] strategic interests lie . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] and [ORG Special Advisor  ] [PER Vali Nasr  ] briefed [PER Rao  ] on the evolving political landscape in [LOC Pakistan  ] with a weakening President [PER Zardari  ] and the fluid dynamic between the various centers of power , including [PER COAS Kayani  ] , Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] , PML-N chief [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] and Chief [PER Justice Choudhary  ] . 
Iran-Afghanistan ; [LOC Iran-India  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) In response to [MISC Holbrooke’s  ] query , [PER Rao  ] and [PER Sinha  ] suggested that [LOC Iran  ] could play a positive role in stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
They cited [MISC Iran’s  ] common border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] , its strong links with the [LOC Hazara  ] ethnic group and its economic and cultural connections as reasons for involving [LOC Iran  ] in shaping a solution . 
She said that [LOC India  ] was willing to play a helpful role in enabling [MISC Iran’s  ] engagement with the international community and this had been conveyed by the Prime Minister to the [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister . 
[LOC India  ] , however , does not want to be a mediator in any capacity , she declared . 
[PER Rao  ] said [LOC Iran-India  ] relations were good -- civilizational ties , India’s large [LOC Shia  ] community , petroleum trade -- but “not as good as you may expect” because [LOC Iran  ] is difficult to deal with . 
[LOC China  ] in [LOC South Asia  ] ------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] and [PER Rao  ] agreed that the [MISC Chinese  ] have a big interest in [LOC Afghanistan  ] but it is focused on exploitation of the country’s natural resources . 
They also agreed that [LOC China  ] does not use the influence it has in [LOC Pakistan  ] to shape responsible [MISC Pakistani  ] behavior . 
Referring to the [MISC U.S.-China  ] joint statement issued during President Obama’s [LOC China  ] visit , [PER Rao  ] disclosed that [MISC Chinese  ] Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] had told Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] in [LOC Copenhagen  ] that [LOC China  ] has no intention of playing any mediating role in [LOC South Asia.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) SRAP [PER Holbrooke  ] has cleared this message .
