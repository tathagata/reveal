PERMISSION FOR IMPROPER WIRETAPS WAS LEGALLY OBTAINED ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Uribe  ] emphasized to the Ambassador and DCM on September 21 that he is determined to get to the bottom of the scandals surrounding the [ORG Administrative Department of Security  ] ( [ORG DAS  ] ) . 
[PER Uribe  ] was accompanied by Defense Minister [PER Gabriel Silva  ] , [ORG Colombian National Police  ] ( [ORG CNP  ] ) Chief [PER Oscar Naranjo  ] , [ORG DAS  ] Director [PER Felipe Munoz  ] , Vice Foreign Minister [PER Clemencia Forero  ] , and [ORG MFA North American Affairs  ] Coordinator [PER Adriana Maldonado.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) An extremely animated and agitated [PER Uribe  ] phoned Acting [ORG Prosecutor General Guillermo Mendoza  ] at the top of the meeting to ask for an update on his investigation into the [ORG DAS  ] wiretap scandal --which [PER Uribe  ] set to speakerphone for the Ambassador to hear . 
[PER Mendoza  ] reported that [ORG Prosecutor General 's Office  ] investigators had found two signed judicial orders regarding two distinct cases , one a kidnapping case and the other an extortion case . 
The orders listed Auxiliary Magistrate [PER Ivan Velasquez'  ] cellular telephone number as a target in those cases . 
The legal judicial order carried the signatures of prosecutors from [LOC Bogota  ] and [LOC Fusagasuga  ] , [LOC Cundinamarca  ] . 
IT IS UNCLEAR WHO IS BEHIND THE WIRETAP REQUESTS --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mendoza  ] continued that investigators must now determine why the prosecutors signed the orders . 
The intercept requests came from the [ORG Prosecutor General 's Technical Investigation Corps  ] ( [ORG CTI  ] ) and the [ORG CNP  ] 's anti-kidnapping police ( [ORG GAULA  ] ) , [PER Mendoza  ] said . 
( [PER Note: Separately  ] , [ORG DEA Bogota  ] obtained copies of the orders , which show that the improper wiretaps were legally obtained . 
End note . 
) [ORG Prosecutor General Mendoza  ] explained that the intercepts from these numbers were the source of the recordings leaked to the news weekly " Semana , " including the recorded conversation between [PER Velasquez  ] and a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] official . 
In response to [PER Uribe  ] 's query , [PER Mendoza  ] said that his office has not determined who leaked the recordings to [LOC Semana.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DAS  ] Director [PER Munoz  ] said that his investigation found that prosecutors in [LOC Leticia  ] and [PER Choco  ] had been colluding with [ORG DAS  ] officials to illegally tap telephones . 
However , the investigation remained open . 
[PER MOD Silva  ] offered that he has received indications that prosecutors involved in the [PER Velasquez  ] case received illegal payments to bank accounts in the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , he has not yet determined who had made the payments or why . 
[PER Silva  ] asked for the Ambassador 's help in tracking down the details . 
The Ambassador agreed , but stressed that all such assistance must flow through law enforcement channels . 
[PER Munoz  ] and [ORG CNP  ] Director [PER Naranjo  ] explained that the wiretap judicial order went through the [ORG GOC  ] consolidated judicial wire intercept program " [ORG Esperanza  ] . 
" While [ORG DAS  ] is a consumer of [ORG Esperanza  ] products through its judicial police function , it does not control or administer [ORG Esperanza  ] . 
[PER Munoz  ] said that he has audited the [ORG DAS  ] terminal that receives [ORG Esperanza  ] products but not the central [ORG Esperanza  ] program or other customers . 
[PER URIBE  ] COMMITTED TO A FULL INVESTIGATION --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) An impassioned [PER Uribe  ] said that the legal document put the scandal in an entirely different light . 
He urged [ORG Prosecutor General Mendoza  ] to call a press conference and explain this new development . 
[PER Uribe  ] recalled that [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] , [ORG UN  ] High Commissioner for [ORG Human Rights  ] ( [ORG UNHCHR  ] ) [PER Navy Pillay  ] , and President [PER Obama  ] had expressed their concerns about the [ORG DAS  ] to him and that his administration has been under a cloud as a result of it . 
He wanted this revelation known before he saw world leaders on the margins of [LOC UNGA  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] excoriated [PER Munoz  ] for his failure to resolve the scandal months earlier and for the delay in discovering the legal wiretap order. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] agreed with the Ambassador that a thorough and transparent investigation into past [ORG DAS  ] misdeeds is vital . 
He stressed that the [ORG GOC  ] will clarify what happened in the past and punish those responsible . 
[PER Uribe  ] reiterated his comments from September 19 to the press that a conspiracy of extradited former paramilitary leaders and current criminals was conspiring to impugn the credibility of the government . 
He said that the past six months has been an ordeal for him , with many questioning his honesty . 
President [PER Uribe  ] said that he would get to the bottom of the scandal to demonstrate his own and his government 's honesty and credibility . 
INTERNATIONAL HELP IN REFORMING INTEL ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In response to the Ambassador 's suggestion , [PER Uribe  ] said that the [ORG GOC  ] would welcome technical help to organize the successor agency to the [ORG DAS  ] from [ORG Interpol  ] or another competent international agency . 
[PER Uribe  ] rejected creating an eminence gris panel to advise on the new agency , saying the problems were technical and not political. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On September 18 , [PER Munoz  ] told the Ambassador that the [ORG DAS  ] has prepared an inventory of cases that it works with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement through its vetted units , and will transfer those cases to other institutions in an orderly way and in close coordination with [MISC Embassy  ] law enforcement attaches . 
[PER Munoz  ] said that the [ORG GOC  ] has drafted a new policy document on intelligence and promised the Ambassador a copy of the draft . 
[PER Munoz  ] said that the [MISC Australian  ] and [MISC British  ] governments have offered help in organizing the new intelligence agency , and that [ORG USG  ] help would be welcome. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Munoz  ] said he and Vice President [PER Francisco Santos  ] plan to travel to [LOC Washington  ] for private meetings with the [ORG Inter-American Human Rights Commission  ] on November 5-6 , and he hopes to meet with [ORG USG  ] officials at that time . 
The Ambassador said he would discuss the possibility of such meetings with [PER Munoz  ] in few weeks , but could not recommend meetings with [ORG USG  ] officials for the moment . 
LOSS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE DOOMS [ORG DAS  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Under instructions from [PER Uribe  ] , [PER Munoz  ] had called on the Ambassador on September 18 to relay [PER Uribe  ] 's decision to abolish the [ORG DAS  ] . 
[PER Munoz  ] explained that the [ORG DAS  ] had become both a domestic and international liability . 
He conceded that in his eight months leading the [ORG DAS  ] , he had failed to show the public that he was making progress in reforming the troubled department . 
The recent wiretap revelations coupled with the international loss of confidence in the [ORG DAS  ] shown by the [ORG Department of State  ] 's comments upon the release of the human rights certification , as well as a letter from [ORG UNHCHR  ] Pillay , comments by [ORG UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur Margaret Seggakya  ] , and [ORG OAS  ] officials all combined to cause President [PER Uribe  ] to decide that the [ORG DAS  ] has become unsalvageable . 
The Ambassador stressed that a complete investigation into [ORG DAS  ] misdeeds and punishment for those responsible was essential . 
TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM [ORG DAS  ] --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Munoz  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] plans to transfer the [LOC DAS'  ] judicial police functions to the [MISC Colombian National Police  ] ( [ORG CNP  ] ) and the [ORG Prosecutor General 's Office  ] . 
The [ORG CNP  ] will also take over the [ORG Interpol  ] role in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
The [ORG CNP  ] or the [ORG Ministry of Interior and Justice  ] will assume responsibility for protection of at risk individuals , such as labor and human rights activists who have received threats . 
[PER Munoz  ] explained that the [ORG GOC  ] will submit a bill to [ORG Congress  ] on September 22 that abolishes the [ORG DAS  ] ( which as a cabinet level organization cannot be abolished by executive order ) and asks the [ORG Congress  ] to allow the President to create a new , much smaller organization focused on intelligence , counter-intelligence and immigration control. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) For legal reasons , the [ORG DAS  ] will continue to have its functions until the new law takes effect . 
However , the process of transferring responsibility and shutting down the organization would begin immediately , [PER Munoz  ] said . 
[PER Munoz  ] expected that of the existing 6,500 [ORG DAS  ] personnel , 2,000 would be retired or RIFed immediately ; and 4,500 could go into other agencies if they met the requirements for those agencies , such as the [ORG CNP  ] , [ORG Prosecutor General 's Office  ] or the new intelligence agency . 
However , he stressed that most of the employees for the new intelligence agency would be new professionals with no connection to the [ORG DAS  ] .
