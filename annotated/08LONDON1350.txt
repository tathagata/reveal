( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary and Recommendation . 
[ORG FCO  ] contacts explained May 14 that HMG’s May 1 approval ( ref C ) for [ORG CEDAR SWEEP  ] flights had been widely considered at [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG FCO  ] , with some departments flagging concerns about the information provided by the [ORG USG  ] . 
[ORG HMG  ] is concerned that the request for reconnaissance flights may have been made by the [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG MOD  ] , rather than the entire [ORG GOL  ] . 
Embassy will be receiving a new letter from [ORG HMG  ] setting out that [ORG HMG  ] approval for [ORG CEDAR SWEEP  ] was based on the understanding that the flights are approved by the entire [ORG GOL  ] . 
Secondly , [ORG FCO  ] is concerned that human rights reports , including the [ORG State Department’s  ] own , do not reflect the sterling reputation of the [ORG LAF  ] as conveyed in our April 14 request for use of [LOC Akrotiri  ] airbase . 
[ORG HMG  ] expects the [LOC United States  ] to monitor use of the [ORG CEDAR SWEEP  ] intel and ensure the [ORG LAF  ] lives up to its commitment to maintain high human rights standards . 
Embassy [LOC London  ] is concerned by HMG’s piling on of concerns and conditions , which portend a burdensome process for getting the rest of our intel flights approved , per ref [PER B. We  ] recommend high level approaches to [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG FCO  ] counterparts to register concern about these new conditions . 
Embassy [LOC Beirut  ] may also want to consider having the [ORG GOL  ] engage the [MISC British  ] directly . 
End Summary . 
Concerns And/Or Implied Conditions ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER John Hillman  ] of [ORG FCO’s Whitehall Liaison Department  ] informed [ORG PolMilOff  ] May 14 of several [ORG HMG  ] concerns/conditions about [ORG CEDAR SWEEP  ] that could jeopardize future use of [MISC British  ] territory . 
First , [PER Hillman  ] said that the [ORG FCO  ] regional bureau responsible for [LOC Lebanon  ] had questioned [ORG USG  ] assurances that the reconnaissance missions were requested by “the Government of [LOC Lebanon.”  ] The regional bureau was concerned that the request for reconnaissance assistance may have only been made by the [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , rather the entire [MISC Lebanese  ] cabinet , which apparently requires consensus on controversial issues . 
[ORG HMG  ] believed the [ORG GOL  ] could disavow assertions that it requested reconnaissance assistance if the flights were made public . 
[PER Hillman  ] said that [ORG HMG  ] was “entitled to accept” the [ORG USG  ] understanding that [ORG MOD  ] was authorized to make the request on behalf of the entire [ORG GOL  ] . 
[ORG HMG  ] has sent Embassy [LOC London  ] a follow-up letter ( not yet received ) emphasizing that HMG’s May 1 approval was contingent on the understanding that the request was made by the [ORG GOL  ] . 
[PER Hillman  ] said that , should the [ORG GOL  ] disavow the request and it become clear that the entire [ORG GOL  ] was not supportive of the flights , [ORG HMG  ] would have difficulty approving the involvement of [MISC British  ] territory in [ORG CEDAR SWEEP.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Second , [PER Hillman  ] said the [ORG FCO  ] human rights department noted that , despite the [MISC Lebanese  ] MOD’s assurances that it would not use the shared intel unlawfully , [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] and even the [ORG State Department’s  ] own [ORG Human Rights Report  ] had documented cases of torture and arbitrary arrest by the [ORG LAF  ] . 
[PER Hillman  ] underscored that if there were any risk that detainees captured with the help of [ORG CEDAR SWEEP  ] intel could be tortured , [ORG HMG  ] would expect the [ORG USG  ] to impress upon the [ORG LAF  ] that assurances of lawful treatment must be upheld in practice . 
Furthermore , [PER Hillman  ] said , to the extent that the [ORG USG  ] becomes aware of arrests made as a result of [ORG CEDAR SWEEP  ] intel , [ORG HMG  ] expects the [ORG USG  ] to ensure the detainees are treated lawfully . 
If the [LOC U.S.  ] became aware of “reasons to doubt [ORG LAF  ] assurances , ” [ORG HMG  ] would expect to be notified immediately . 
[PER Hillman  ] noted that these human rights considerations would undoubtedly be reviewed in the next [ORG Cedar Sweep  ] approval cycle . 
Comment and Recommendation -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Hillman  ] emphasized that the decision to approve [ORG CEDAR SWEEP  ] had been widely discussed in [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG FCO  ] , with the decision made by Minister [PER Kim Howells  ] , but even Foreign Secretary had been informed . 
He noted that “the highly cautious approach is a reflection of Parliamentary , public , and media attention to issues involving [LOC UK  ] complicity in human rights violations.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Embassy [LOC London  ] finds these additional conditions for [ORG HMG  ] approval and assumptions about our ability to monitor every [MISC CEDAR SWEEP-related  ] apprehension to be not only burdensome but unrealistic . 
We recommend that DOD and State officials raise with [LOC UK  ] counterparts the concern that excessive conditions such as described above will hinder , if not obstruct , our cooperative counterterrorism efforts . 
While we share HMG’s concerns that human rights not be sacrificed for the sake of [LOC CT  ] , we cannot take a risk-avoidance approach to [LOC CT  ] in which the fear of potentially violating human rights allows terrorism to proliferate in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
We also recommend that Embassy [LOC Beirut  ] consider whether it would help to have the urge the [ORG GOL  ] engage the [MISC British  ] directly . 
[ORG HMG  ] is supportive of the [ORG Siniora  ] government and may be less rigid if asked to assist by the [ORG Siniora  ] government itself .
