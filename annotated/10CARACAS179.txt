End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ---------- [ORG Venevision  ] Claims Neutrality , Denies Pact/Self-Censorship --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] met with Ambassador [PER Duddy  ] and [PER DCM Caulfield  ] at [ORG Venevision  ] television headquarters in [LOC Caracas  ] on February 10 . 
[ORG Venevision  ] is the largest remaining private , free-to-air television station , with a 60% national audience share . 
[PER Bardasano  ] said that due to the highly polarized political atmosphere in the country , [ORG Venevision  ] strives for objective and neutral news coverage . 
He said the station 's coverage tends to be approximately 60% opposition and 40% pro-government by content , with the ultimate goal of achieving a 50/50 balance. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] denied widespread allegations that a pact had been made between [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Cisneros  ] during a June 18 , 2004 meeting hosted by the [ORG Carter Center  ] in [LOC Caracas  ] to moderate [ORG Venevision  ] 's editorial line in exchange for remaining on air . 
( Note: [PER Chavez  ] had earlier alleged that [PER Cisneros  ] and [ORG Venevision  ] helped to instigate and prolong the 2002 coup attempt through [ORG Venevision  ] 's coverage of the anti-government demonstrations and lack of coverage of the pro-Chavez demonstrations that eventually led to his return to office . 
[PER Marcel Granier  ] , the owner of [ORG RCTV  ] , has publicly alleged that [PER Chavez  ] decided to close [ORG Venevision  ] 's competitor , [ORG RCTV  ] , during that meeting . 
End Note . 
) [ORG Venevision  ] executives also denied self-censorship in their news coverage , although they acknowledged that they walk a fine editorial line in order to present objective and balanced news coverage . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , " It is very difficult here and the ( political ) skin is very sensitive , for both sides . 
" He added , " We will continue our balanced approach.. . 
We report both sides and then let the viewer decide . 
This is very delicate work . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also noted that investigative journalism was not practiced by most journalists in the country. --------------------------------------------- --- It 's [ORG RCTV  ] 's Fault that They Were Closed --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that [ORG Venevision  ] has always provided moral support for competitor [ORG RCTV International  ] . 
However , they stressed that [ORG Venevision  ] had spent " two painful years " gathering documentation to comply with new government regulations established pursuant to the June 12 , 2000 [ORG Organic Law on Telecommunications  ] and that they had done the necessary work to successfully renew their license in 2007 for a five-year period . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG Venevision  ] had to [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000179 002 OF 002 " strictly comply with the ( new ) law , and we presented our documentation - even opposition-oriented [ORG Globovision  ] complied with the new requirements . 
We had numerous discussions with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] about what to turn in under the new law and how to renew their license . 
" ( Note: [ORG RCTV  ] 's license was not renewed in 2007 , resulting in massive street protests in support of the station .

) ---------------------------------- And If [MISC Globo Should Close  ] ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Venevision  ] executives and the Ambassador discussed the future of freedom of expression in [LOC Venezuela  ] should [ORG RCTV  ] and [ORG Globovision  ] eventually be closed by [PER Chavez  ] . 
( Note: The government regulatory agency [ORG Conatel  ] recently pressured local cable operators to remove [ORG RCTV  ] from their programming for allegedly violating new regulations that classified [ORG RCTV  ] as a national audiovisual producer and thereby required it to carry mandatory broadcasts , including President [PER Chavez'  ] speeches . 
[ORG Globovision  ] and its owner are currently subject to numerous regulatory and criminal investigations ; see septel for rumors regarding [ORG Globovision  ] 's sale . 
End Note . 
) The Ambassador reminded [ORG Venevision  ] executives that should [ORG Globovision  ] be closed , [ORG Venevision  ] would have to carry the banner of freedom of expression as the largest remaining private free-to-air TV media group in the country and the only one with independent content. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that it would be difficult for [ORG Venevision  ] without [ORG Globovision  ] . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , " Should [ORG Globovision  ] fall , a huge alarm bell will sound in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] accused the government of " economic strangulation " of free-to-air networks , noting that [ORG Venevision  ] loses on average five hours of publicity every day due to mandatory government programming . 
" It is a strategy of slow death , " said [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
( Note: Free-to-air broadcasters are required to carry government productions , commercials , and speeches free of charge . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: [ORG Venevision  ] 's strategy is to stay alive even if it means working hard to avoid antagonizing the government . 
In this way , they insist non-government views will have a chance to reach the public . 
As the [ORG GBRV  ] continues its drive to marginalize , moderate , or silence any media not under its control , [ORG Venevision  ] 's management understands that even cautious [ORG Venevision  ] could become a target .
