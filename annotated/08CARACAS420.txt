( U ) This is an action request - see paragraph 12. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary: Embassy [LOC Caracas  ] requests DOD support in the execution of its strategic communications plan . 
The goal for this program is to influence the information environment within [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The strategy 's goal is to counter the active and deliberate campaign by the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG BRV  ] ) to instill in the population a negative perception of the [LOC US.  ] and distort more than 100 years of close and mutually beneficial relations between our two countries . 
Regrettably , the [ORG BRV  ] has had some success . 
From a pre-Chavez level of over 65% approval , today the positive image of the [LOC US  ] has fallen to a historic low of 31% in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
DOD support would greatly enhance existing Embassy Public Diplomacy and pro-democracy activities . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Venezuela  ] at the [ORG Crossroads: Venezuela  ] once ranked with [LOC Colombia  ] and the [MISC Central American  ] countries as being most favorably disposed to the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , attitudes towards [LOC America  ] have deteriorated after several years of daily , well-funded [ORG BRV  ] attacks against the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Recent Developments: Embassy [LOC Caracas  ] has developed a comprehensive strategic communications plan that incorporates various agencies within the mission . 
The [ORG Narcotic Affairs Section  ] ( NAS ) has implemented a successful baseball clinic bringing former [MISC Venezuelan  ] players and managers from the [LOC US  ] major leagues to work with the youth in various [MISC Venezuelan  ] cities as part of a narcotics demand reduction program . 
In addition , the [ORG Public Affairs Office  ] targets the hard-to-penetrate youth and low-income sectors , programming Embassy leadership visits to all regions of [LOC Venezuela  ] to interact with [MISC Venezuelan  ] society , business , and civilian organizations . 
All of these programs have had an impact on [MISC Venezuelan  ] perceptions towards the [LOC US  ] within targeted sectors . 
Lack of resources limits our ability to reach a much larger population base. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Objectives: The strategic communications plan focuses on three key objectives ; strengthening [MISC Venezuelan-US  ] friendship , informing [MISC Venezuelans  ] of enduring ties with [LOC America  ] , and countering anti-US influence and activity . 
The [LOC US  ] government needs to remind the [MISC Venezuelan  ] people of its historic friendship ( " We have been with you since [PER Simon Bolivar  ] " ) through continuous engagement , either with goodwill activities or offers of [LOC US  ] assistance for emergency situations . 
We should also develop a message to enhance [MISC Venezuelan  ] understanding of its natural partnership with the [LOC US  ] through our long history of mutual support , strong commercial and agricultural ties , and the cultural and people to people links--large numbers of [MISC Venezuelan  ] immigrants live in [LOC US  ] ( " We have been allies since the 1800s " ) . 
Finally , this strategic communications program must demonstrate commitment and support to the shared values and aspirations of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC American  ] people regardless of Chavez' hostility or harsh rhetoric in order to counter anti-US influence and activity ( " Both our nations stand for freedom , democracy , and prosperity . 
" ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Themes: This program will center principally on three themes: The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] share common interests ; --- Strong commercial and human ties. --- Both of our peoples respect and value civil and individual rights . 
Regional problems require the cooperation of all neighbors ; --- Drug trafficking affects all countries and can only be effectively addressed through regional cooperation. --- Organized crime , international gangs , and trafficking in persons affect every society and are strongly correlated to peace and stability . 
Long historical and cultural ties ; --- Wars for independence. --- Support to [LOC Venezuela  ] against [MISC European  ] intervention in the late 1800s. --- Baseball --- Large number of [MISC Venezuelan-American  ] citizens. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Standards: Three  ] continuous threads will be woven throughout this proposed program . 
First , the absolute veracity of the information will be assured prior to any program being publicized or aired . 
This standard will be in direct contrast to the misinformation , broken promises , and exaggerations of the [PER Chavez  ] administration . 
The second is a commitment to sending only positive messages about people . 
Negative messages tend to become associated with the sender . 
The third standard is to refrain from any attacks against the [ORG BRV  ] or [PER Chavez  ] that would provide a pretext for [PER Chavez  ] to rally [MISC Venezuelans  ] against " the empire . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Concept of [MISC Operations:  ] The [ORG Embassy  ] would like to begin operations May 2008 and continue through April 2009 . 
If the program is determined to be successful through attitude polling metrics , then the Embassy will seek funding for a second year . 
The first phase would consist of information gathering - surveying the environment to determine attitudes and opinions about the [LOC US  ] , drugs , and corruption , and other areas in [LOC Venezuela  ] that affect people in their everyday lives. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Based on these findings , in the second phase we would implement a campaign using newspaper ads , billboards , radio and TV spots . 
Embassy [LOC Caracas  ] would focus their resources on key population areas of [LOC Venezuela  ] and states outside the [LOC Caracas  ] metropolitan area . 
Follow-on phases would include rock concerts , sporting events , and musical festivals . 
The final phase would converge on [LOC Caracas  ] and concentrate on sending the message of our continued support to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] people. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG Embassy  ] will evaluate the effectiveness of the program through feedback surveys . 
In order to gauge the program 's long term effects a survey team will return to the target area between 90 and 120 days after the execution of the program . 
That will give time to the target audience to " digest " our message and show indications that they are either accepting or rejecting our message. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Operational Timeline for the [ORG Strategic Communications Plan  ] 10-25 May - 1st Phase ( [ORG Site Survey  ] ) 1 June-30 August-2nd Phase ( centered on outlying states ) 1 September-25 December 2nd Phase ( Sporting events and musical tours ) 1 Jan 2009-30 April 2009-3rd Phase ( [LOC Caracas  ] focused ) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Action Request - Embassy requests support from [ORG Department of Defense  ] in the execution of its [ORG Strategic Communications Plan  ] . 
The embassy would like resources available by Mid-May 2008. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 .
