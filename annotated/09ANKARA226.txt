Mr. [PER Vahedi  ] , age 75 , told [PER Conoff  ] he had paid smugglers $7500 to take him across the [MISC Iranian/Turkish  ] border after having been held against his will in [LOC Iran  ] for seven months . 
Although suffering some aches and pains , he appeared to be in good health after a harrowing three-day journey from [LOC Tehran  ] to [LOC Ankara  ] that included a 14-hour mountain climb on horseback in freezing temperatures . 
Embassy staff provided immediate consular assistance and worked with [MISC Turkish  ] authorities to prevent his deportation back to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Consular officers escorted [PER Vahedi  ] to the [LOC Ankara  ] airport where he departed on January 13 . 
End summary. ---------- Background ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On January , 7 , Embassy [LOC Bern  ] alerted posts in the region that [MISC American  ] citizen [PER Hossein Ghanbarzadeh Vahedi  ] , [ORG DPOB  ] xx/xx/1933 was trying to escape from [LOC Iran  ] and could possibly surface in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Vahedi  ] , a dentist from [LOC Los Angeles  ] , instead appeared at the [LOC Ankara  ] Consular Section around noon on January 9 , 2009 . 
Although visibly shaken , [PER Vahedi  ] said he had no major physical problems , but he did break down a few times when explaining his ordeal . 
He told [PER Conoff  ] that he had enough medication and declined local medical attention preferring to wait until he was back in the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Vahedi  ] has been a resident , then citizen of the [LOC United States  ] since the [MISC Islamic  ] Revolution in 1979 . 
Aside from this trip , he has only returned to [LOC Iran  ] once about ten years ago and did not encounter any problems on that visit . 
At his wife’s urging to visit his parents’ gravesite in [LOC Iran  ] , he traveled to [LOC Tehran  ] in early May 2008 where he spent four weeks with family and friends without incident . 
However , after clearing customs at [LOC Tehran  ] airport on June 6 , he heard his name called on the public address system with instructions to report to a separate office . 
At this office , GOI authorities confiscated his passport and told him he would not be leaving [LOC Iran  ] . 
When [PER Vahedi  ] pressed as to the reason , he was dismissed with instructions to follow-up at the [MISC Islamic  ] Revolution [ORG Court.  ] ------------------------ Seven-Month [ORG House Arrest  ] ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Thus began a seven-month ordeal in which [PER Vahedi  ] appeared almost daily at the court to request that his passport be returned . 
During this de facto house arrest , [PER Vahedi  ] did contact [PER Elizabeth Bucher  ] , the Deputy Head of the [ORG Foreign Interest Section  ] at the Embassy of [LOC Switzerland  ] in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
He reported that [PER Ms. Bucher  ] was very kind and helped him get his heart medications , but was unable to help him depart the country . 
He lived with friends and relatives staying only a few days with each to avoid them being implicated in his problems. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Vahedi  ] believed his passport was confiscated for two reasons , the first being simple extortion . 
It was made clear to him informally by the authorities at the court that if he paid a $150,000 fine the process would move more quickly . 
Secondly , he was told by GOI officials that he should use his influence to pressure his [MISC American  ] citizen sons to terminate one of their business ventures . 
Vahedi’s sons are the owners of [ORG Concertino Productions  ] , a [MISC Los Angeles-based  ] entertainment company that promotes , among other things , the popular [MISC Persian  ] pop singers [ORG Kamran  ] and [ORG Hooman  ] . 
In addition to [MISC American  ] performances , the duet has performed in [LOC Dubai  ] and other middle-eastern venues . 
According to [PER Vahedi  ] , while the singers are simply [MISC Persian  ] pop singers , they have gotten crowds riled up with occasional anti-regime rhetoric . 
Also included in these performances are female dancers whose costumes would not raise an eyebrow in most countries , but are perceived as immoral by the conservative elements inside [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Vahedi  ] did not trust that paying the fine would expedite the return of his passport unless he also convinced his sons to cancel the next [LOC Dubai  ] performance of [ORG Kamran  ] and [ORG Hooman  ] . 
[PER Vahedi  ] spoke of a third party who was pulling the strings within the [MISC Iranian  ] government , particularly in regard to his son’ business . 
He repeatedly told the officials of the [MISC Islamic  ] Revolution Court that his children had lived in [LOC America  ] all of their lives and as such he exerted no control over their strong , typically [MISC American  ] independent behavior. --------------- No Empty Spoons --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Vahedi  ] spoke bitterly about his former country , especially its lack of a fair judicial system and widespread corruption . 
He told [PER Conoff  ] that all government employees receive free sugar , rice , and cooking oil to ensure their loyalty to the regime . 
He also said anyone with any authority lives by the “why should I put an empty spoon into my mouth” philosophy . 
[PER Vahedi  ] reported that regime spies were omnipresent including taxi drivers , hotel clerks , and restaurant workers . 
He also said it was common knowledge that all new [MISC Iranian-made  ] cars had a “Khamenei tax” in the amount of $3100 that was earmarked for a fund for [LOC South Lebanon  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] . 
At his daily appearances at the court , he came to know the intimate details of the lives of many of the other visitors , some of whom told [PER Vahedi  ] they had no idea where their loved ones were , or if they were even alive . 
[PER Vahedi  ] also helped one woman whose drug-addicted husband was incarcerated by paying her rent for the months he was there . 
[PER Vahedi  ] reported seeing [MISC Iranian  ] citizens watch helplessly as their family members were hauled off in shackles without any official charges levied against them. ----------------------- Picking the [ORG Best Option  ] ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Vahedi  ] realized that this situation was not going to change and alluded to people who knew of his situation from his daily appearances at the court approaching him with departure options . 
[PER Vahedi  ] said he studied the four most common illegally used routes out of [LOC Iran  ] . 
The first was crossing as a stowaway on a merchant ship across the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] into the [LOC UAE  ] . 
[PER Vahedi  ] dismissed this plan because he thought the heavy shipping traffic was too dangerous and they risked being boarded by the [MISC Iranian  ] Navy who were patrolling the area . 
The second option was overland through [ORG Baluchistan  ] but [PER Vahedi  ] could not obtain enough facts about the execution of that plan to seriously consider that route . 
The third choice was to enter [LOC Iraq  ] heading to [LOC Karbala  ] and try to make contact with a member of the [MISC American  ] military stationed there . 
[PER Vahedi  ] seriously considered this option , but feared being discovered by the [MISC Iraqis  ] before he could make contact with an [MISC American  ] soldier . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In spite of temperatures hovering around zero degrees Fahrenheit , [PER Vahedi  ] chose the early part of January because it coincided with the [MISC Shia  ] commemoration of [LOC Ashura  ] and he thought it likely the police would be more preoccupied . 
In the weeks prior to his departure , this 75-year old man trained for strength and altitude by climbing in the hills north of [LOC Tehran  ] . 
To protect his family and friends from retribution by the GOI after his absence was noted , he spoke to none of them of his escape plans . 
On January 7 [PER Vahedi  ] boarded a bus [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ----------------- Over the [LOC Mountain  ] ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The two escorts were paid $5000 at the beginning of the journey and the three set out as soon as it was dark . 
For all his planning , [PER Vahedi  ] did not have clothing appropriate for the weather and had a very difficult time with the cold . 
At one point [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the escorts had to physically hug him to keep him warm . 
As an inexperienced rider hours into the climb [PER Vahedi  ] lost his concentration and fell off the horse tumbling into the woods . 
He told [PER Conoff  ] that at this point , he really believed he was going to die by freezing to death on a mountainside . 
However , his only partially-paid escorts came to his aid and put him back on the horse . 
Although he had thought he would be able to walk part way , the altitude proved too much for him and his only choice was to remain on the horse . 
[PER Vahedi  ] said that he believes they were following known dug smuggling routes , evidenced by the way the horse knew exactly which way to turn . 
[PER Vahedi  ] said the horse often led the escorts , even going off the normal path in what seemed to be the wrong direction . 
Knowing that he escorts could also be trying to smuggle drugs on this trip , he covertly went through the one pack they had thrown on the horse and said he found nothing. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Once over the [MISC Turkish  ] border they were met on schedule by a man [PER Vahedi  ] described as about 25 years old . 
During the handover , [PER Vahedi  ] paid out another $2500 but was unsure how the three escorts split that payment . 
The [MISC Turkish  ] escort then brought [PER Vahedi  ] into a home where he was fed and given time to rest and warm up . 
In the early evening he was driven to and waited there at the bus station for the 0200 bus to [LOC Ankara  ] . 
[PER Vahedi  ] said he maintained a very low profile and did not talk to anyone during the 10-hour bus trip . 
He arrived at the [ORG Consular  ] section around noon on Friday , January 9. -------------------- [ORG Deportation Conflict  ] -------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As [PER Vahedi  ] had entered [LOC Turkey  ] illegally , [PER Conoff  ] worked with GOT officials to ensure his deportation back to [LOC America  ] . 
Initially the Chief of the [MISC Foreigner’s  ] police within the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] in [LOC Ankara  ] told [PER Conoff  ] that because “we knew [PER Vahedi  ] was coming” he intended to deport him back to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Post is aware that [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] citizens have been deported back to those countries in a fairly brutal manner . 
According to [ORG UNHCR  ] some have been taken by bus in the middle of the night to the southern [MISC Turkish  ] border and released . 
Police have then allegedly shot into the air forcing the deportees to run across the border into [LOC Iraq  ] or [LOC Iran  ] with no food or water to sustain them . 
( 13 ) ( C ) Post contacted [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] officials , who subsequently exerted pressure on the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] to allow this 75-year old [MISC American  ] citizen to be deported back to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG Consular  ] staff assured his security during the four days it took to work through the departure arrangements and accompanied him through the police and court proceedings and finally onward to the airport . 
[PER Vahedi  ] told [PER Conoff  ] he had never done anything illegal in his life and that he was ashamed to be seen in policy custody . 
[PER Vahedi  ] departed [LOC Turkey  ] at 4:00 p.m. on January 13. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The problems [PER Vahedi  ] faced as a result of entering [LOC Turkey  ] illegally highlights the tough stand this government takes on illegal entry . 
This is particularly true with [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] nationals , even those who may also carry [MISC American  ] citizenship . 
Ensuring Vahedi’s return to the [LOC United States  ] , vice deportation to [LOC Iran  ] required the intervention of the embassy’s front office .
