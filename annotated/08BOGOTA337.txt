( U ) Participants [LOC UNITED STATES  ] CJCS Admiral [PER Michael Mullen  ] Ambassador [PER William Brownfield CJCS/EA CAPT James Foggo Defense Attach COL Mark Wilkins  ] ( notetaker ) [LOC COLOMBIA  ] President [PER Alvaro Uribe Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos Armed Forces Commander General Freddy Padilla  ] MFA [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Canada  ] Desk Officer [PER Patricia Cortes  ] ------------------------------- [PER Uribe  ] Obsessed By [PER Chavez  ] Blasts ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] arrived late to the meeting , directly from a discussion with his cabinet on how to respond to [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez'  ] latest inflammatory remarks , and the show of solidarity by the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Congress  ] on granting " belligerent " status to the [ORG FARC  ] . 
It was clear that he was still focused on [PER Chavez  ] and the [ORG GOC  ] response. ------------------------- [ORG GOC  ] Progress , [ORG USG Support  ] ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Uribe  ] thanked the [LOC United States  ] for its continued support , stressing its decisiveness in helping [LOC Colombia  ] pull back from the brink of becoming a failed state . 
While much work remains , [LOC Colombia  ] has made great progress against terrorists and the [ORG GOC  ] feels certain they can win this battle . 
[PER Uribe  ] attributed a great portion of the credit for [LOC Colombia  ] 's success to the permanent assistance of the [ORG USG  ] and its armed forces . 
Chairman [PER Mullen  ] reaffirmed the strength of the bilateral relationship and assured [PER Uribe  ] of continuing [ORG USG  ] commitment to defeating our common adversaries . 
He admired Colombians' determination and leadership . 
The [MISC Colombian  ] military had transformed itself remarkably and performed the highest calling possible -- returning [LOC Colombia  ] to its citizens. --------------------------- [PER Chavez' Endorsement  ] of [ORG FARC  ] --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Uribe  ] said his neighbor 's actions cause [LOC Colombia  ] great difficulty . 
The [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ELN  ] must keep their terrorist designation , [PER Uribe  ] insisted , and there should be negative consequences for any country granting them belligerent status . 
It was important to counter and challenge [PER Chavez'  ] rhetoric , especially on this point . 
When [LOC France  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] granted that status to the [ORG Farabundo Marti Liberation Front  ] ( [ORG FMLN  ] ) rebels in [LOC El Salvador  ] in 1981 , [PER Uribe  ] commented , they fought an unelected and brutal dictatorship . 
By contrast , the [ORG FARC  ] waged war on a duly elected democracy , they had no public support , and they financed themselves through narcotrafficking and extortion. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Asked by the Chairman how much help [PER Chavez  ] gave the [ORG FARC  ] , [PER Uribe  ] replied that [PER Chavez  ] has a five to seven year plan to advance his [MISC Bolivarian  ] agenda in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
He has created popular militias inside [LOC Venezuela  ] ( apart from the [ORG Armed Forces  ] ) to sustain his revolution . 
The [ORG GOC  ] believes [PER Chavez  ] thinks he could use the [ORG FARC  ] as his militia inside [LOC Colombia  ] to combat its democratic government . 
[PER Chavez  ] remains committed to bring down both [PER Uribe  ] and his government , as the primary obstacles to his [MISC Bolivarian  ] expansionist dreams . 
With no clear [MISC Colombian  ] presidential successor , a well financed candidate favoring [PER Chavez  ] might find space in 2010 . 
The best counter to [PER Chavez  ] , in [PER Uribe  ] 's view , remains action -- including use of the military. ---------------- [ORG Regional Support  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] urged the [ORG GOC  ] and [ORG USG  ] to work together to convince [MISC Latin American  ] countries that [PER Chavez'  ] approach to the [ORG FARC  ] was wrong and would harm [LOC Colombia  ] and regional democracy . 
The [ORG USG  ] , he said , ought to lead a public campaign against [LOC Venezuela  ] and counter [PER Chavez'  ] progress through preferential oil offers . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] , supported by [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Panama  ] , [LOC Belize  ] , and [LOC Costa Rica  ] ( especially [PER Oscar Arias  ] in the latter ) were natural leaders to counter [PER Chavez  ] . 
Even [LOC Cuba  ] , which felt [PER Chavez  ] had crossed into dangerous territory , has exercised a restraining influence . 
When the [ORG GOC  ] asked the [MISC Cuban  ] government their views on [PER Chavez'  ] call to roll back the [ORG FARC  ] 's terrorist designation , the [MISC Cubans  ] stated that it was " a difficult proposal . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] saw mixed loyalties among other [MISC Latin American  ] countries . 
Only [LOC Nicaragua  ] had supported [PER Chavez'  ] [ORG FARC  ] proposal . 
[LOC Argentina  ] remains difficult , since [LOC Venezuela  ] bought [MISC Argentine  ] bonds and [PER Chavez  ] made campaign contributions to the new President . 
[LOC Paraguay  ] , in the midst of an election cycle , is uncertain though the front-runner supports [PER Chavez  ] . 
[LOC Uruguay  ] , a possible ally , is sitting on the fence . 
[LOC Brazil  ] remains friendly with [LOC Colombia  ] , but prefers neutrality lest it offend anyone . 
In [LOC Peru  ] , President [PER Alan Garcia  ] concurs with the [LOC United States  ] and would follow its lead . 
[LOC Chile  ] remains a good friend to [LOC Colombia  ] and its cause. ----------------- Hostages and HVTs ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] listed rescue of hostages held by the [ORG FARC  ] as one of his main goals for 2008 . 
He outlined a plan whereby the military would establish a " cordon sanitaire " around areas where hostages were held . 
Then the [ORG GOC  ] would temporarily open the area to outside interlocutors such as the [ORG ICRC  ] to offer an international medical mission and conduct negotiations . 
Under this umbrella , the [ORG GOC  ] would focus on the 44 hostages the [ORG FARC  ] had identified as " exchangeable . 
" Chairman [PER Mullen  ] assured [ORG USG  ] support for [ORG GOC  ] 's efforts , but he cautioned that the [ORG USG  ] wanted the hostages returned alive . 
[PER Uribe  ] responded with his conviction that the [ORG FARC  ] would not kill hostages at this stage . 
The best course of action , he advocated , remains to locate the hostages , secure the positions , and then call in the [ORG ICRC  ] to negotiate their release. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Uribe  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] also placed a priority on high value targets and that they had achieved great results in late 2007 . 
Finally , he said he was prepared to authorize [MISC Colombian  ] forces to cross into [LOC Venezuela  ] , arrest [ORG FARC  ] leaders , and bring them to justice in [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
