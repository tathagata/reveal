In all of his meetings , General [PER Jones  ] described his mandate as developing a security plan to address the needs that will arise from the establishment of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state , factoring in the equities of [LOC Israel  ] and other regional partners . 
He made clear that he will not be involved in monitoring the implementation of [ORG Phase One of the Roadmap  ] , as has been reported repeatedly in the [MISC Israeli  ] press . 
[PER Barak  ] and PM [PER Olmert  ] set the tone , offering full cooperation and support for [MISC Jones'  ] work . 
In each meeting , the [MISC Israelis  ] described their concerns about the security impact of a two-state solution on [LOC Israel  ] due to [LOC Israel  ] 's small size and population , the heavy concentration of [LOC Israel  ] 's population and economic centers along the narrow coastal plain , their lack of confidence in the [MISC Palestinians'  ] security capabilities , and the range of regional threats [LOC Israel  ] faces . 
At the same time , most of them reiterated their support for an agreement with the [MISC Palestinians  ] and progress toward a two-state solution . 
FM [PER Livni  ] emphasized that she did not look at security issues with a view to finding an excuse not to move forward . 
Rather , she felt it essential to look at security issues so that implementation of the two state vision could be done " the right way .

[PER Olmert  ] indicated that he and [PER Barak  ] planned to assign a senior [ORG IDF  ] defense expert , probably [ORG MG Ido Nechushtan  ] , to serve as a liaison to General [PER Jones  ] . 
DAO will report in detail in their channels the strategic threats briefing provided by [ORG MG Nechushtan  ] to General [PER Jones  ] . 
End Summary . 
BARAK: CONSIDER THE REGIONAL THREATS ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [MISC Jones'  ] GOI meetings began with Defense Minister [PER Ehud Barak  ] , who was joined by [ORG IDF  ] Chief of General Staff [PER Gabi Ashkenazi  ] and most of the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG IDF  ] senior staff . 
General [PER Jones  ] was accompanied by the Ambassador , Army Attache , and [MISC PolCouns  ] . 
After introducing the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG IDF  ] senior staff and explaining their responsibilities , [PER Barak  ] observed that seen from a narrow focus on [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [LOC Israel  ] appears to be much the stronger party , but once the focus is expanded to cover the array of regional threats to [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Israel  ] is the party that is threatened with extinction . 
The role of the [ORG IDF  ] , he said , is to prevent that from happening . 
The triad of nuclear proliferation , [MISC Islamist  ] terrorism , and rogue states poses a gathering threat . 
The [ORG IDF  ] is engaged in daily clashes with [MISC Palestinian  ] terror organizations , some of which are guided from [LOC Syria  ] and supported by [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Hizballah  ] and [LOC Syria  ] have growing ground-to-ground missile capabilities directed against [LOC Israel  ] , but [LOC Israel  ] had just dealt with an even more serious threat from [LOC Syria  ] . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Barak  ] said [LOC Israel  ] differs with the latest [ORG National Intelligence Estimate  ] , but he did not elaborate. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to the negotiations with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER Barak  ] said there would only be minor modifications of the 1967 borders . 
[LOC Israel  ] would need to retain the settlement blocs around [LOC Jerusalem  ] and in the northern [LOC West Bank  ] , but give up the other settlements . 
Since the [MISC Palestinian  ] border would only be nine miles from the sea , [LOC Israel  ] 's security margin would require that the [MISC Palestinian  ] state be demilitarized . 
[LOC Israel  ] would retain control of the air space , as well as military access to the [LOC Jordan Valley  ] for years to come . 
[LOC Gaza  ] would have to be part of any solution , he noted , it could not be left as a separate entity for which the [MISC Palestinian  ] government was not responsible. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) General [PER Jones  ] reviewed his military career , including a number of visits to [LOC Israel  ] and interactions with the [ORG IDF  ] . 
He noted that since retiring as [ORG NATO  ] Supreme Commander and USEUCOM Commander in February , he had worked on a project involving the national security implications of energy issues for the [ORG U.S. Chamber of Commerce  ] , as well as writing a report for the [ORG Congress  ] on the [MISC Iraqi  ] security services . 
Secretary [PER Rice  ] had then asked him to come back part-time to develop a security plan for a [MISC Palestinian  ] state that would take account of regional equities . 
He stressed that monitoring the [ORG Roadmap  ] is not in his mandate . 
[PER Barak  ] offered the [ORG MOD  ] 's full support , noting that he would be clear about [LOC Israel  ] 's security needs . 
[ORG IDF  ] BRIEFING ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG IDF  ] J-5 [ORG MG Ido Nechushtan  ] , [ORG IDF  ] Deputy Chief of Staff MG [PER Dan Harel  ] , and [ORG Israel Defense Intelligence  ] head [PER Amos Yadlin  ] escorted General [PER Jones  ] , the Ambassador , Defense Attache , and [MISC PolCouns  ] to the helopad on the roof of the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] tower in downtown [LOC Tel Aviv  ] . 
[ORG Nechushtan  ] pointed out the topographical vulnerabilities of greater [LOC Tel Aviv  ] and [LOC Israel  ] 's coastal plain vis a vis the nearby ridges of the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
At a follow-on briefing , [ORG Nechushtan  ] stressed the security challenges posed by a [MISC Palestinian  ] state . 
Unlike the [LOC Olso  ] process , a peace agreement would not replace security , but security arrangements would ensure peace . 
[LOC Israel  ] 's security requirements would need to be addressed from the beginning of the process since [LOC Israel  ] had no response time or strategic depth . 
[LOC Israel  ] 's coastal strip includes seventy percent of [LOC Israel  ] 's population and eighty percent of its GDP , and a [MISC Palestinian  ] state would be immediately adjacent . 
In order to compensate for this increased risk , a [MISC Palestinian  ] state would have to be completely demilitarized , with [LOC Israel  ] in control of [LOC Palestine  ] 's air space and land borders . 
There would need to be special security arrangements to protect [LOC Jerusalem  ] and [ORG Ben Gurion Airport  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] would also retain security control of the [LOC Jordan Valley  ] , while maintaining early warning and intelligence gathering sites on the tops of the [LOC West Bank  ] hills . 
The land link between the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] would have to be under [MISC Israeli  ] control as well. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) IDI Chief [PER Yadlin  ] dismissed the [ORG PA  ] 's security capabilities , saying it would take a minimum of three to five years before the [MISC Palestinians  ] could assume security responsibility for the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
Terror organizations in the [LOC West Bank  ] are highly motivated but their capabilities are limited due to the daily actions of the [ORG IDF  ] and [ORG Shin Bet  ] . 
Chief of General Staff [PER Ashkenazi  ] stressed that the [LOC Annapolis  ] process must put security first . 
Most [MISC Israelis  ] now believe in a two-state solution , he said , it was not even particularly controversial . 
The problem was security , he said , citing statistics that suicide bombers from the [LOC West Bank  ] had killed 220 [MISC Israelis  ] and wounded 1320 in 2002 , but had not killed or wounded any [MISC Israelis  ] in 2007 due to [ORG IDF  ] action in 2002-03 to clean out the [LOC West Bank  ] and build the fence . 
If [LOC Israel  ] handed over security responsibility to the [ORG PA  ] today , it would all start again . 
The burden must be on the [ORG PA  ] to prove that it can take over. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Noting the [MISC Marine Corps'  ] counter-insurgency doctrine of not making more enemies and not harming the civilian population , General [PER Jones  ] asked whether the [ORG IDF  ] 's concept included economic development , reconstruction , and education and training . 
[ORG Nechushtan  ] said these elements were linked to security . 
[PER Tony Blair  ] understood that and coordinated the security element for his projects . 
The [ORG MOD  ] had reviewed [PER Blair  ] 's projects and approved them . 
The problem here was to prepare for what will be needed once the [ORG PA  ] is independent . 
[PER Yadlin  ] pointed out that if Qassam rockets were put in the [LOC West Bank  ] , they could do much more damage than those fired from [LOC Gaza  ] . 
MG [PER Harel  ] recalled that he had commanded the September 2005 evacuation of [LOC Gaza  ] . 
At the time he had expected there would be peace , but instead terrorists had fired about 3,000 rockets at [LOC Israel  ] since the withdrawal . 
OLMERT: A LONG WAY TO GO ON THE GROUND --------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador and [MISC PolCouns  ] accompanied General [PER Jones  ] to his meeting with Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] in the PM 's private office . 
The Prime Minister 's Chief of Staff [PER Yoram Turbowicz  ] and Foreign Policy Adviser [PER Shalom Tourgeman  ] joined [PER Olmert  ] . 
General [PER Jones  ] reviewed his official visits and professional contacts with [LOC Israel  ] since 1981 to [PER Olmert  ] 's evident satisfaction . 
[PER Olmert  ] commented that he understood that [PER Jones  ] would not be the one to judge [ORG Roadmap  ] performance , but rather he would be looking at security issues in light of the emergence of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state , factoring in [MISC Jordanian  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] equities . 
[PER Olmert  ] called this an important mission due to the dominant influence of the [LOC U.S.  ] It would be demanding and time consuming. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Prime Minister commented he was less pessimistic than most [MISC Israelis  ] , but even so that he did not think a solution with the [MISC Palestinians  ] was as close as Secretary [PER Rice  ] would like . 
There was still a " long way to go " on the ground , he said . 
During a visit to the [ORG IDF Central Command  ] on the [LOC West Bank  ] ten days prior , the commanders had told [PER Olmert  ] that cooperation with the [ORG PA  ] security forces was improving , as was the [LOC West Bank  ] economy and quality of life . 
But responsibility for counter-terrorism operations remained fully in [MISC Israeli  ] hands , [ORG PA  ] security forces were only performing civil law enforcement . 
If the [ORG IDF  ] withdrew , [ORG Hamas  ] would take over. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Olmert  ] said he was impressed by the extent of international support for the [ORG PA  ] , as demonstrated by over [ORG USD  ] 7 billion in pledges at the [LOC Paris  ] donors' conference . 
Nonetheless , the question of how it would be transferred remained . 
[PER Olmert  ] said he had heard that the [MISC Saudi  ] assistance would only go to projects , which he said he would be happy to see . 
The problem was that he did not see the [ORG PA  ] developing the " iron fist " they would need to kick the terrorist organizations out of the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
[LOC Gaza  ] was lost to [ORG Hamas  ] and [PER Abbas  ] had no plans for taking it back . 
The [ORG PA  ] says the [MISC Palestinian  ] state must include [LOC Gaza  ] but they do not want to take responsibility for it. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Olmert  ] cautioned [PER Jones  ] that he must understand many layers of language in the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
For example , in their one-on-one meetings , President [PER Abbas  ] always asks [PER Olmert  ] to take tougher actions against [ORG Hamas  ] and its [LOC Gaza  ] leadership . 
But when the [ORG IDF  ] carries out operations in [LOC Gaza  ] that kill terrorists , [PER Saeb Erekat  ] writes a letter to the [ORG UN  ] complaining about it . 
[PER Olmert  ] said that the [MISC Palestinians  ] say one thing to Secretary [PER Rice  ] and then ask him to do the opposite . 
SIPDIS <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After expressing satisfaction at [ORG IDF  ] operations in [LOC Gaza  ] the previous day that had killed ten members of [MISC Palestinian  ] [LOC Islamic Jihad  ] , including the head of the [ORG PIJ  ] military wing in [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Olmert  ] asked [PER Jones  ] how he expected to work with the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG IDF  ] . 
[PER Jones  ] replied that he would work openly with them . 
This was only an introductory visit , but he would return after the President 's visit and return regularly , working with a small staff . 
[PER Olmert  ] said he would ask [ORG Barak  ] to assign a senior " defense intellectual " to liaise with [PER Jones  ] , most likely MG [PER Nechushtan  ] . 
[PER Turbowicz  ] commented that they were there to help [PER Jones  ] in every way . 
[PER Olmert  ] reiterated that point , saying he wanted [PER Jones  ] to succeed . 
The [ORG GOI  ] wanted to move forward with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , and both sides were in need of General Jones' advice . 
[ORG ISA  ] DISKIN: READY TO PROVIDE FOCUSED SECURITY BRIEFS --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Jones  ] discussed his security mission with [ORG ISA  ] Director [PER Yuval Diskin  ] , and emphasized that while he was not a stranger to [LOC Israel  ] , he had worked principally with the [ORG IDF  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] described [ORG Shin Bet  ] 's mandate and activities in [LOC Israel  ] and the territories , and the complicated reality of [LOC Israel  ] 's security environment . 
He underscored the problems posed by smuggling of weaponry across the [LOC Philadelphi  ] corridor ( between [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] ) and stressed it was only part of a larger smuggling network: " Explosives come from [LOC Africa  ] via the [MISC Sudan-Egypt-Suez-Sinai  ] route , or via the [LOC Red Sea  ] . 
" [MISC Bedouin  ] tribes provide the " [MISC Arab  ] conductivity " between [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] ( via [LOC Israel  ] ) . 
People , too , are smuggled across the [MISC Sinai  ] , from [LOC Eritrea  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] and [LOC Darfur  ] ( [LOC Sudan  ] ) , [PER Diskin  ] added . 
He contrasted the laxity of [MISC Egyptian  ] security control at [LOC Suez  ] , which he said could easily be a chokepoint for GOE efforts to control smuggling , and in the [MISC Sinai  ] with the seriousness of the [MISC Jordanians  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] stressed the strategic importance of [LOC Jordan  ] , and the need for [LOC Israel  ] to take account [MISC Jordanian  ] interests. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Diskin  ] said [LOC Israel  ] 's main threat came from the [LOC West Bank  ] , and that the security zone , especially in the northern [LOC West Bank  ] , had been critical to [LOC Israel  ] 's success in countering that threat . 
[PER Diskin  ] underscored how [LOC Israel  ] 's " opportunity to control movement " in the [LOC West Bank  ] contributed to [LOC Israel  ] 's security . 
He described how the number of [MISC Israeli  ] victims had peaked in 2002 , and had tapered off since the construction of the separation barrier and [ORG Operation Defensive  ] Shield in 2002 . 
[PER Diskin  ] reported that while 1100 [MISC Israelis  ] had been killed since 2000 , yet only ten [MISC Israeli  ] civilians and soldiers had been killed by [MISC Palestinians  ] in 2007 ( in [LOC Israel  ] or the territories ) . 
[MISC Israeli  ] control of passages and the movement of persons between the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] or between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] provides security. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response to Gen. Jones' question about the extent of [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] security cooperation , [PER Diskin  ] , who said he has been closely involved with [MISC Palestinian  ] affairs since 1993 , noted that even in the worst of times , [ORG Shin Bet  ] had maintained contacts with [MISC Palestinian  ] security services . 
He singled out the new [MISC Palestinian  ] military intelligence chief in the [LOC West Bank  ] as one of the only new faces , and one who was somewhat more serious than the others had been . 
( [PER Diskin  ] cited the [MISC Palestinian  ] response to terrorism in 1996 as the only time when [ORG PA  ] security forces proved to be serious and effective . 
) [PER Diskin  ] assessed that the [MISC Palestinian  ] security establishment is " broken , not professional , reactive rather than proactive . 
" Their establishment lacks a " circle of enforcement " ( intelligence gathering , investigation , arrest and interrogation , and trial in a court of law ) . 
Instead , during the 1997-2000 period , the [MISC Palestinian  ] Preventive Security Organization and the General Intelligence typically " completed [MISC Israeli  ] operations in areas where they were 's overeign.' 
" <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On training ( of [MISC Palestinian  ] security forces ) , [PER Diskin  ] said he preferred that there be one trainer , not several . 
[PER DCM Moreno  ] noted that all of the next 700 [MISC Palestinian  ] trainees would be trained in [LOC Jordan  ] . 
On [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Diskin  ] said the [MISC Palestinian  ] [LOC Islamic Jihad  ] ( [ORG PIJ  ] ) operatives killed on December 17-18 " were only part of the problem , " [PER Diskin  ] did not think [LOC Israel  ] could stand the status quo for many months , or risk importing the [LOC Gaza  ] reality to the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
A Gaza-like rocket threat in the [LOC West Bank  ] would endanger [MISC Israeli  ] industry and population centers . 
" That 's why the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] are not connected , " [PER Diskin  ] concluded . 
LIVNI: EAGER TO DISCUSS SECURITY WITH [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG THEN PA  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Gen. [PER Jones  ] recalled his familiarity with [LOC Israel  ] and the [ORG IDF  ] , his frequent training missions in [LOC Israel  ] , and his encouragement of military-military contacts between [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Israel  ] in the framework of the [ORG NATO  ] [MISC Mediterranean  ] dialogue . 
He discussed his mission with FM [PER Livni  ] , highlighting that the paper he envisioned as the outcome would apply more to future realities rather than the present situation on the ground . 
He stressed that he did not have [LOC Road  ] map or referee in his job description , and asked [PER Livni  ] for her perspective. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) FM [PER Livni  ] characterized security as the most important core issue , one that has yet to be addressed: " Two states living side by side in peace in security has not been translated into an understanding . 
" She traced the path that she had taken from ideological attachment ( to the idea of [LOC Greater Israel  ] ) to the need for two states so as to end the conflict between [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] and to preserve [LOC Israel  ] as a [MISC Jewish  ] and democratic state . 
[PER Livni  ] stressed the importance of [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( and eventually [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] ) coming to such an understanding as to the meaning of living side by side with a [MISC Palestinian  ] state in peace and security . 
" The word security is just too vague ; it is not a real plan . 
We need you ( Gen. [PER Jones  ] ) : your mandate and mission is crucial to the process . 
" She said that [LOC Israel  ] has its own ideas regarding the region , alliances , and , like [PER Diskin  ] , acknowledged the importance of strategic allies such as [LOC Jordan  ] . 
[PER Livni  ] felt it critical that security issues needed to be addressed soon , as the political negotiations with the [MISC Palestinians  ] are now getting under way . 
" I would like to be in a position , as [LOC Israel  ] 's negotiator , to share many of our security concerns ( with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) . 
" As negotiator , she said she would need to represent [LOC Israel  ] 's security needs in negotiations with the [MISC Palestinians  ] and underscored her close collaboration with the [ORG Ministry of Defense.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Livni  ] outlined a number of the strategic challenges and questions [LOC Israel  ] faced , and said [LOC Israel  ] was looking for answers to " strategic questions " with a view to finding ways to implement policy . 
She hoped to turn first to Gen. [PER Jones  ] , as " it will not be easy on the bilateral ( [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] track ) to get to understandings . 
" -- Where does [LOC Gaza  ] lead us ? 
Is it a strategic threat ? 
Is the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] part of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state ? 
-- The [MISC Philadelphi  ] corridor is a [MISC Palestinian  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] security concern , and , while there are mutual interests , there will be areas of difference between the current [ORG PA  ] and the [ORG GOI  ] . 
-- Should [LOC Israel  ] support a seaport or airport for the [MISC Palestinians  ] , now , or even in the future ? ( No , in her view ) . 
-- Will the formation of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state resolve some security challenges , or create new problems for [LOC Israel  ] ? 
-- Would the [MISC Palestinian  ] state be demilitarized ? 
How would connections between a [MISC Palestinian  ] state and other states , particularly the [LOC Jordan  ] Valley be controlled ? 
Would there be a passage between [LOC Gaza  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] ? 
-- [ORG Abbas  ] embraced the [MISC French  ] idea of an international force in the region in his remarks in [LOC Paris  ] . 
Are such forces willing to fight [ORG Hamas  ] house-to-house ? 
She doubted it . 
-- Does it make sense for [LOC Israel  ] to support economic projects in the [LOC West Bank  ] when some joint ventures actually create security problems for [LOC Israel  ] ? 
Is there an organized plan ? 
What does [MISC Palestinian  ] capacity-building mean ? 
-- Will [MISC Palestinians  ] chose [ORG Fatah  ] in the future ? 
-- [LOC Iran  ] poses a traditional " 20th century " type of threat to [LOC Israel  ] , but other , non-state actors , in places such as [LOC Lebanon  ] are posing new threats. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Livni  ] emphasized that she did not look at security issues with a view to finding an excuse not to move forward . 
Rather , she felt it essential to look at security issues so that implementation of the two state vision could be done " the right way . 
" She underscored that when it comes to security , the idea is not to bridge gaps but to clarify what needs to be done to achieve security . 
Gen. [PER Jones  ] concurred , adding that " I 'm not a negotiator or a mediator . 
" He told [PER Livni  ] that he would return by the end of January with a small team , and " won't be silent " in the meantime . 
Gen. [PER Jones  ] also clarified that his job description would require him to look at the " equities of the region with regard to security issues , primarily vis a vis [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] . 
" <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) General [PER Jones  ] did not clear this cable .
