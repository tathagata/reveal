( C ) Summary . 
Prime Minister [PER Yuliya Tymoshenko  ] has repeatedly promised to remove all intermediaries in the gas trade with [LOC Russia  ] , but [LOC Russia  ] appears to be making direct gas dealings contingent upon obligations that [LOC Ukraine  ] may not be able to fulfill . 
[PER Tymoshenko  ] and [MISC Russian  ] PM [PER Putin  ] have signed a memorandum calling for direct gas trade , and the heads of state-owned oil and gas company [ORG Naftohaz Ukrainy  ] and [MISC Russian  ] energy giant [ORG Gazprom  ] followed up with an agreement specifically removing shady intermediary [ORG RosUkrEnergo  ] ( [ORG RUE  ] ) from gas dealings between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] must first pay off significant debts to [ORG Gazprom  ] , however , which could be a tall order given the country’s current balance of payments crisis and its poor track record of paying its gas debts . 
The high level meetings did set some parameters for the 2009 gas trade , but no final agreement on price has been signed , and [ORG GOU  ] sources tell us that [LOC Moscow  ] may bide its time to see if snap parliamentary elections result in a new government more amenable to [LOC Russia  ] . 
Hence , it is still too early to write off [ORG RUE  ] , or the concept of shady intermediaries as a whole . 
Some commentators are speculating that the sides may even agree to replace [ORG RUE  ] with another , recently established company called [PER KazUkrEnergo  ] . 
End summary . 
Conditions Must be Met before [ORG RUE  ] Removed ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Gas intermediary [ORG RosUkrEnergo  ] ( [ORG RUE  ] ) , could still play a role in Ukraine’s energy sector next year , despite the gas memorandum signed on October 2 by [MISC Ukrainian  ] Prime Minister [PER Yuliya Tymoshenko  ] and [MISC Russian  ] Prime Minister [PER Vladimir Putin  ] that calls for direct gas relations between [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Tymoshenko  ] repeatedly has pledged to eliminate [ORG RUE  ] and other gas intermediaries from the gas trade between the two countries . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] owns 50 percent of [ORG RUE  ] . 
[MISC Ukrainian  ] businessmen [PER Dmitry Firtash  ] and [PER Ivan Fursin  ] nominally control 45 and 5 percent stakes , respectively , but [MISC Ukrainian  ] media several times have reported that the circle of true beneficiaries of [ORG RUE  ] is wider and includes [PER Semyon Mogilevich  ] , a [MISC Russian  ] organized crime boss wanted by the [ORG FBI  ] and currently in custody in [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The October 2 memorandum aims to establish direct , long-term gas relations between [ORG Naftohaz  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] beginning on January 1 , 2009 . 
The memorandum makes no mention of intermediaries for cross-border sales , and [LOC Ukraine  ] must fulfill several conditions: [ORG Naftohaz  ] must pay its outstanding gas debt to [ORG Gazprom  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] must commit to paying future gas supplies on time , and [ORG Gazprom  ] subsidiary [ORG Gazprom  ] Sbyt must be allowed to sell gas to [MISC Ukrainian  ] consumers ( Note: This is quite a tall order , given that [ORG Naftohaz  ] reportedly owes [ORG Gazprom  ] $1.8 billion in accrued gas debt , [LOC Kyiv  ] has a poor track record for paying its gas bills on time , and [ORG Naftohaz  ] reportedly owes [ORG Gazprom  ] 11 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) of gas . 
End note ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) As a follow-up to the October 2 memo , [ORG Naftohaz  ] Chairman [PER Oleh Dubyna  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] Head [PER Alexei Miller  ] last week concluded another agreement , which reportedly will remove [ORG RUE  ] from Ukraine’s gas market and change the way [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Russia  ] have conducted gas relations since 2006 . 
So far , few details about the new agreement are known . 
Neither a 2009 gas import price for [LOC Ukraine  ] nor the amount of money [ORG Naftohaz  ] owes [ORG Gazprom  ] for unpaid gas were specified in the new agreement. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Both sides did agree that the amount of gas that [LOC Ukraine  ] transports across its territory on [MISC Gazprom’s  ] behalf in 2009 will be the same as this year’s . 
In 2007 [LOC Ukraine  ] shipped 112 bcm of [MISC Gazprom’s  ] gas through its pipelines , and 82 bcm during the first eight months of 2008 , representing a 19 percent increase over the same period last year . 
[ORG Gazprom  ] agreed to lower the cost of the 6.4 bcm of so-called “technical gas” that [LOC Ukraine  ] annually uses to maintain its gas transport infrastructure . 
[ORG Naftohaz  ] , on the other hand , has pledged to allow [ORG Gazprom  ] Sbyt to sell no less than 7.5 bcm of gas in [LOC Ukraine  ] to industrial customers and pay all outstanding gas debts , including RUE’s to [ORG Gazprom  ] . 
[ORG GOU: Moscow  ] May Wait for [ORG New Government  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG EconOff  ] spoke with [ORG Naftohaz  ] Deputy Chairman [PER Vitaliy Gnatushenko  ] on October 27 regarding the GOU’s plans to eliminate [ORG RUE  ] from the gas arrangement . 
[PER Gnatushenko  ] affirmed that [LOC Ukraine  ] still intended to sign a long-term gas contract with [ORG Gazprom  ] that did not involve gas intermediary [ORG RUE  ] . 
[ORG Naftohaz  ] would sign a contract now , but [MISC Gnatushenko’s  ] contacts at [ORG Gazprom  ] told him that [LOC Moscow  ] first wanted [ORG Naftohaz  ] to pay its outstanding debts , and was waiting for the outcome of snap parliamentary elections , which may or may not take place in December . 
[ORG EconOff  ] also spoke with Deputy Minister of Fuel and Energy [PER Volodymyr Makukha  ] who acknowledged that [ORG RUE  ] would most likely be part of the gas arrangement until [ORG Naftohaz  ] had satisfactorily cleared all its outstanding gas debts either with cash or in-kind payments . 
[PER Makukha  ] could not explain how [ORG Naftohaz  ] would quickly clear those debts . 
[PER Makukha  ] agreed that [LOC Moscow  ] was waiting for [LOC Kyiv  ] to elect a new parliament before it would sign anything . 
He added that with falling oil prices , Naftohaz’s bargaining position for a cheaper gas price was strengthened , but he did not believe any new gas contracts would be signed until the end of December or the beginning of 2009 . 
KUE To Replace [ORG RUE  ] ? ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While details are few , local press has reported that a new gas intermediary called “KazUkrEnergo AG” could take RUE’s place and sell [ORG Central Asian  ] gas to [LOC Ukraine  ] , possibly after snap elections lead to a new government more amenable to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
Like [ORG RUE  ] , [PER KazUkrEnergo  ] ( KUE ) appears to be a “mailbox” company and could be waiting in the wings until a new [MISC Ukrainian  ] PM is confirmed who may be more receptive to the idea of retaining gas intermediaries in Ukraine’s gas relations with [LOC Russia  ] and [MISC Central Asian  ] producers . 
KUE was registered in May this year in [LOC Zurich  ] with a statutory capital of 200,000 [MISC Swiss  ] Francs ( $194,870 ) and 20 shares . 
[PER KazUkrEnergo  ] reportedly is owned by [ORG Korlea Invest Holding AG  ] ( [LOC Switzerland  ] ) , a company that exports [MISC Ukrainian  ] electricity primarily to [LOC Central Europe  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Although media report that [PER Tymoshenko  ] -- by concluding this latest gas agreement -- has achieved her long held goal of removing [ORG RUE  ] from Ukraine’s energy sector , [ORG Gazprom  ] could still retain the right to maintain its own contracts with the gas middleman . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] would struggle to pay back $1.8 billion of debt in the best of times , and the current balance of payments crisis will make it even more difficult for [LOC Ukraine  ] to settle the debt before negotiations for gas prices in 2009 begin in earnest . 
In addition , the country’s unstable politics make it impossible to gauge whether [PER Tymoshenko  ] will be in power , or strong enough , to truly rid [LOC Ukraine  ] of [ORG RUE  ] in the coming months . 
Hence it remains too early to write off [ORG RUE  ] .
