REF: A. [ORG LA PAZ  ] 600 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[ORG LA PAZ  ] 593 Classified By: A/EcoPol Chief [PER Joe Relk  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The [PER Morales  ] administration may use an April 16 police team raid in opposition-dominated [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , in which police shot and killed three alleged terrorists , arrested two more , and reportedly found a separate weapons cache ( Reftels A , B ) , to initiate arrests of the political opposition . 
On April 28 , the government arrested two additional suspects and identified more , one of whom is an Embassy contact and leader of a human rights [ORG NGO  ] . 
Some opposition members speculated that Vice President [PER Alvaro Garcia Linera  ] and Presidency Minister [PER Juan Ramon Quintana  ] orchestrated the April 16 raid to provide a rationale for such arrests . 
Post 's [MISC Cruceno  ] contacts did not return repeated calls . 
Government targets reportedly include ex-Civic Committee President [PER Branko Marinkovic  ] , [PER Prefect Ruben Costas  ] , and leaders of [ORG CAINCO  ] ( [LOC Santa Cruz Chamber of Trade  ] and Industry ) . 
[PER Quintana  ] and Defense Minister [PER Walker San Miguel  ] provided conflicting reasons for ordering some 1,500 troops to [LOC Santa Cruz  ] department ( state ) , further raising [MISC Cruceno  ] suspicions of government actions . 
While [PER Costas  ] has called for calm , some Crucenos are reportedly forming fighting groups . 
Government-aligned media have reported on potential [ORG USAID  ] and [ORG CIA  ] involvement with the alleged terrorists . 
End summary. - - - - - - - - - - More Terrorists ? - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On April 28 , police arrested two more men , one of them an ex-security advisor to the [ORG Cruceno Youth Union  ] ( [ORG UJC  ] ) [PER Juan Carlos Gueder Bruno  ] and the other [PER Alcides Mendoza Masavi  ] , alias " Commander Mojeno . 
" Police said the two arrested men had supplied arms to the alleged terrorists . 
Police also said they believed there were three other terrorist cell members involved , largely based on an interview [PER Rozsa  ] gave before leaving [LOC Hungary  ] , in which he said " only five people know of my arrival ( in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] ) . 
" According to [PER Gueder Bruno  ] 's wife , the police did not show an arrest warrant , as required by law. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A report in leading local daily [ORG La Razon  ] also cited the release of an arrest warrant for human rights lawyer [PER Hugo Acha Melgar  ] , husband of opposition alternate [ORG Congress  ] member [PER Roxana Gentile  ] ( [ORG UN  ] party ) . 
PolOffs met twice with [PER Acha  ] in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , who was investigating the September 2008 [MISC Pando  ] conflict in his capacity as head of [ORG Human Rights Foundation  ] - [LOC Bolivia  ] , an affiliate of the larger [ORG Human Rights Foundation  ] group . 
He was preparing a report detailing a high degree of [PER Morales  ] administration involvement to provoke violence in [MISC Pando  ] . 
[PER Acha  ] confided to PolOffs that he was under constant threat by groups affiliated with the ruling [MISC Movement Toward Socialism  ] party ( [ORG MAS  ] ) , and that he was unable to travel to [LOC La Paz  ] for fear of arbitrary detention . 
[PER Acha  ] gave MILGP a copy of a late 2008 warrant issued for his arrest , which he said was related solely to his continued [MISC Pando  ] investigations . 
According to [PER Gentile  ] , [PER Acha  ] is currently in the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Police also identified [PER Alejandro Melgar Pereira  ] as a member of the terrorist cell and the purchaser of a vehicle for [PER Rozsa  ] , which was supposedly sighted at [LOC Cardinal Terrazas'  ] home the night of the April 14 bomb explosion . 
The car had been the property of [PER Carlos Guillen  ] , president of popular [LOC Santa Cruz  ] company [LOC Blooming  ] . 
[PER Melgar  ] , reportedly in hiding , was president of the [ORG Center for Arbitration and Reconciliation  ] for [ORG CAINCO  ] , [LOC Santa Cruz  ] 's [ORG Chamber of Trade and Industry  ] , from 1997 to 2001 and president of Cotas from 2000 to 2001 . 
Police said he had aliases of " [ORG El Viejo  ] , Superman , and [PER Lucas  ] . 
" According to [ORG CAINCO  ] , [PER Melgar  ] is currently on their list of recommended lawyers , but holds no official position. - - - - - - - - - - - - " Proofs " of [MISC Terror Cell  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) While the government has asserted it recovered large amounts of information in the April 16 raid , it said it has released only " 10 percent " of its information . 
Thus far , the government 's statements have been limited to assertions and two contested " proofs , " detailed below. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Government Minister [PER Alfredo Rada  ] first presented on April 22 a series of pictures which he stated showed [MISC Cruceno  ] right-wing activist [PER Mauricio Iturri  ] practicing shooting in a terrorist training camp with a large group of well-organized paramilitaries . 
[PER Rada  ] said [PER Iturri  ] was connected with [PER Rozsa  ] 's terrorist cell . 
However , news quickly leaked that not only was [PER Iturri  ] not actually in the picture , but the pictures were downloaded by [PER Rada  ] from the popular website [ORG Facebook  ] and showed only a team of paintball players . 
The government subsequently removed [PER Rada  ] from the case. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) On April 26 , government investigator [PER Sosa  ] held a press conference in which he showed images taken from a cell phone video purportedly showing [PER Rozsa  ] , [PER Magyarosi  ] , and [PER Dwyer  ] talking about the possibilities of killing President [PER Morales  ] . 
[PER Sosa  ] said the three were discussing how to throw explosives and about a missed opportunity to blow up a ship in [LOC Lake Titicaca  ] where government officials had met . 
[PER Sosa  ] concluded that " with this evidence it is confirmed that the dismantled gang came to the country with terrorist purposes " and termed their goal " magnicide " ( i.e. assassination of a king or ruler ) . 
However , according to press reports , while it does appear the three are captured in the video , the video 's soundtrack is almost completely unintelligible . 
[PER Sosa  ] said he would soon unveil the source of the video , whom press reports guessed was [PER Rozsa  ] 's chauffeur , but that he was " gravely ill " with diabetes and therefore could not appear publicly. - - - - - - - - - - - - - Troops Sent to [LOC Santa Cruz  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Presidency Minister [PER Quintana  ] and Defense Minister [PER Walker San Miguel  ] confirmed April 27 that 1500 troops had been sent to [LOC Santa Cruz  ] department , but they gave conflicting reasons for their presence . 
[PER Quintana  ] said the troops had been sent in response to the " terrorism outbreak , " while [LOC San Miguel  ] said the only reason was to reinforce the borders against increased narco-trafficking . 
Other news reports said 40 percent of the [MISC Bolivian  ] armed forces were now concentrated in the department . 
According to official reports , troops were being sent to [LOC Santa Cruz  ] frontier zones , including [LOC San Jose de Chiquitos  ] , [PER San Matias  ] , and [ORG Robore.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) According to April 27 reporting from [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , troops were moving in the department , but it was impossible to verify the number and their destinations . 
Some interviewed said there were as few as 250 , while others confirmed the number of troops was 1500 and that of these 300 had riot control gear . 
Sources reported that [ORG Crucenos  ] are developing fighting/defense groups and are equipped with weapons such as long rifles and hand guns. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [LOC Santa Cruz  ] Prefect [PER Ruben Costas  ] issued a call to " maintain the peace " and said the only purpose for the increase in troops in the department " was to frighten the public . 
" [LOC Santa Cruz  ] is currently calm. - - - - - - - - - Rumors Run Rampant - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Post has reached out to several contacts in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , including [ORG CAINCO  ] and [ORG Civic Committee  ] members , but none will return our calls , at least directly . 
At [LOC CAINCO  ] , only secretaries are " available , " while at the [LOC Santa Cruz Civic Committee  ] , phones are simply off the hook . 
Many [ORG Crucenos  ] believe the central government has tapped their phones. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In meetings in [LOC La Paz  ] , a contact who said he was close to [PER Branko Marinkovic  ] and other [MISC Cruceno  ] leaders told [LOC Poloff  ] that Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] and Presidency Minister [PER Quintana  ] had planned the entire sequence of events over the last six months , including the recruitment of [PER Rozsa  ] 's group to " get [PER Branko  ] , " [PER Costas  ] , and others . 
However , he was not able to further source the rumor . 
According to an article in [MISC Spanish  ] newspaper [ORG El Pais  ] ( reprinted in local [MISC Bolivian  ] press ) , a source called " [PER Comandante Gonzalo  ] " also said the [MISC Bolivian  ] government had hired [PER Rozsa  ] in August 2008. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) There is also rampant speculation about President [PER Morales'  ] traditional May 1st speech , in which he is expected by many to announce nationalization of companies based in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , potentially including Cotas or food industries . 
If the latter , many expect [PER Branko Marinkovic  ] 's cooking oil and other companies to be taken in the name of " food security . 
" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Rumors Fueled by Public Statements - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) The rumor mill has been fueled by public statements by the government and affiliated social groups . 
On April 26 , President [PER Morales  ] said he had asked his legal advisors to draw up a supreme decree allowing the government to confiscate goods from businesses and their owners linked to terrorism . 
Constitutional experts were in general agreement that the new constitution does not permit such seizures , but Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] said " one of the basic principles of the constitution is the unity of Bolivians... who are directed to sanction those who seek to create material and violent conditions to separate the country . 
" Further , state news cited the 2002 [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [ORG OAS  ] ) [MISC Convention Against Terrorism  ] , which the newscast said approved confiscation of property from terrorists. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) The same day , social group leader [PER Isaac Avalos  ] accused [ORG ex-Civic Committee  ] President [PER Branko Marinkovic  ] of hiring the group of alleged terrorists . 
[PER Avalos  ] said he did not have any proof , but that " several campesinos " had told him they recognized [PER Rozsa  ] from past public acts in which [PER Marinkovic  ] participated as [ORG Committee  ] president. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) On April 28 , the prosecutor 's office reported they would announce a list of people who had provided economic assistance to the alleged terrorists within 48 hours . 
Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] said the state would be " merciless " with those behind the plot. - - - - - - - - - [MISC USG Also Targeted ?  ] - - - - - - - - - <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) A day earlier , on April 27 , government-aligned news service Bolpress published a report on a supposed complex international web of support for the alleged terrorist cell . 
The article cited Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] as requesting [MISC Argentinean  ] collaboration to find former members of the " carapintadas " ( members of the [MISC Argentine  ] army who rioted against the government as part of the country 's " [MISC Dirty War  ] " ) affiliated with [PER Rozsa  ] , including one [PER Jorge Mones Ruiz  ] . 
[PER Mones Ruiz  ] , according to the article , came to [LOC Bolivia  ] in December 2008 as part of the [MISC Colombian  ] foundation " [LOC UnoAmerica  ] , " an " ultra-right group " associated with the [ORG Heritage Foundation  ] and dependent on the [ORG CIA  ] for funding . 
The article states that " [LOC UnoAmerica  ] " is supported by [ORG USAID  ] and the [ORG National Endowment Foundation  ] ( [ORG NED  ] ) , which it calls the " social face " of the [ORG CIA  ] and a major funder of opposition movements in [LOC South America.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) Also on April 27 , President [PER Morales  ] ( somewhat cryptically ) identified the [LOC U.S.  ] as " the source of my troubles , " and said " the people will rise above " attempts by any outside force " to humiliate the [MISC Bolivian  ] government . 
" On the other hand , in its April 26 editorial , state newspaper [LOC Cambio  ] trumpeted offers to help in the search for the terrorists , specifically including a statement by Charge and members of the OAS. - - - - - - - - - - - Background: April 16 - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) At approximately 4 a.m. on April 16 , members of an elite police force raided a room on the fourth floor of the Hotel [ORG Las Americas  ] in downtown [LOC Santa Cruz  ] . 
After instructing the hotel staff to turn off all security cameras , the police stormed hotel rooms of five men , killing three and arresting two others . 
The three killed were [PER Eduardo Rozsa Flores  ] , a [MISC Bolivian  ] with multiple passports including [MISC Hungarian  ] and [MISC Croatian  ] ; [PER Michael Dwyer  ] , [MISC Irishman  ] ; and [PER Arpad Magyarosi  ] , a [MISC Romanian  ] of [MISC Hungarian  ] descent . 
The police captured [PER Mario Tadic Astorga  ] , a [MISC Bolivian  ] of [MISC Croatian  ] descent , and [PER Elod Toaso  ] , a [MISC Hungarian  ] . 
Initial reports , including a statement from Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] , indicated there was a 30-minute gun battle between the police and the alleged terrorists , but [MISC Hungarian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Argentina  ] [PER Matyas Jozsa  ] said he believed the three were simply executed , without any fight . 
Later press reports stated that an examination of the hotel rooms showed no bullet holes in the facing wall , and that one of the three was found in the morgue with his hands bound. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) The same morning , police investigations turned up a supposed weapons cache in the [LOC Santa Cruz  ] EXPOCRUZ fairgrounds , in the stand of telephone cooperative Cotas. one of [LOC Santa Cruz  ] 's leading companies . 
The weapons cache at first reportedly included pistols , dynamite , C4 explosives , and ammunition corresponding to 5.56mm weapons . 
Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] commented that some of the weapons were not available in [LOC Bolivia  ] and were evidence of an international conspiracy . 
Through this discovery , police linked the captured men to an April 14 explosion at Cardinal [PER Julio Terrazas  ] official residence in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] and a March 29 attack on Deputy Autonomy Minister [PER Saul Avalos' Santa Cruz  ] home , in which the police reported the same kind of explosives were used . 
However , in later news reports Defense Minister [PER Walker San Miguel  ] was quoted as saying that many of the weapons were stolen from a [MISC Bolivian  ] military station on the [LOC Paraguay  ] border in December 2008 , while other media reported that many of the weapons were antique and unusable , with some from the War of the [ORG Chaco  ] in the mid-1930s. - - - - - - - [PER Toaso  ] Beaten ? - - - - - - - <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) According to an April 28 statement by the [ORG Defensor del Pueblo  ] ( human rights ombudsman ) , [PER Elod Toaso  ] was severely beaten and abused during his arrest . 
A website , www.toasoelod.com , showed pictures of his injuries to his face , arms , and legs . 
Ambassador [PER Jozsa  ] said he had seen [PER Toaso  ] personally , and that he had been beaten . 
[PER Jozsa  ] added that [MISC Hungarian  ] investigations showed [PER Toaso  ] was " far from being a terrorist . 
" State prosecutor [PER Marcelo Sosa  ] admitted he was not present during the arrests , even though the prosecutor 's presence is required by [MISC Bolivian  ] law . 
( Note: Investigators [PER Sosa  ] and [PER Eduard Mollinedo  ] are based out of [LOC La Paz  ] , not [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , as would normally be required , ostensibly because of the case 's connections to terrorist activity . 
End note . 
) - - - - Comment - - - - <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) While rumors of government recruitment of the alleged terrorists cannot be verified , the troop movements , accusations by MAS-aligned social groups , [PER Garcia Linera  ] 's severe public statements , and the government 's almost conspiratorial use of [ORG Facebook  ] pictures and low-quality cellphone videos do seem to point toward a crackdown in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] similar to the 2008 state of siege in [LOC Pando  ] . 
Without a functioning judiciary , including the defunct [ORG Constitutional Tribunal  ] , the [PER Morales  ] administration has a relatively free hand to move forward with large-scale arrests . 
Such actions could result in a severe backlash from Crucenos , who are nervous to the point of paranoia about [MISC Morales'  ] motivations . 
We may know more within the next 48 hours , when troops will go to either frontier areas or closer toward [LOC Santa Cruz  ] 's capital , [PER Morales  ] will make his May 1st speech , and the prosecutor 's office should release a fuller list of ( [MISC Cruceno  ] ) suspects . 
We are also confused by somewhat contradictory comments regarding the [ORG USG  ] by [PER Morales  ] and state-allied news sources , but note that the government has yet to make any explicit accusations regarding [ORG USG  ] involvement with the alleged terrorists . 
End comment .
