END SUMMARY . 
Election Results ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed pleasant surprise at the sharply critical assessment of the elections leveled by [ORG OSCE PA  ] and [ORG PACE  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that from everything he had heard prior to the elections , [ORG PA  ] and [ORG PACE  ] were prepared to offer a positive assessment . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed to tension between [ORG OSCE PA  ] and [ORG ODIHR  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] He commented that given the many irregularities and fraud that took place during the campaign and on election day , the elections were not legitimate . 
He acknowledged that the [LOC U.S.  ] could not say this , but welcomed any strong public statements the [LOC U.S.  ] might make. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the reaction across [LOC Russia  ] shows that for the educated electorate , the elections left a bad taste and smell . 
He said the [ORG Communist Party  ] was justifiably upset about fraud , as the party , s real results should have been closer to 20 percent in some regions . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that the [LOC Kremlin  ] had resorted to all methods to secure the vote for [PER Putin  ] and [LOC United Russia  ] , mobilizing the homeless , police , falsifying results in regions such as [ORG Tatarstan  ] , [ORG Bashkiria  ] and the [LOC North Caucasus  ] , controlling the media and whipping up hysteria against foreign enemies . 
However , despite these efforts , [PER Putin  ] , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , suffered poor results , garnering 7 million fewer votes than he did for his presidency four years ago . 
He argued the regime was undergoing a real crisis as nearly 70 percent of the population , according to [MISC Levada  ] polls , did not believe the elections to be free , and the support was one based on loyalty , not genuine support. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained the success of [LOC LDPR  ] [PER Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  ] by the fact that the [LOC Kremlin  ] had forced all other charismatic politicians out of the race ( naming [LOC Rogozin  ] , [LOC Khakamada  ] , and others ) . 
He argued that those who didn , t want to vote for [LOC United Russia  ] or the [MISC Communists  ] voted for [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] as a protest vote . 
He said that some protest votes also went to Just [LOC Russia  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] Succession ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that popular opinion in [LOC Moscow  ] believes that [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] is out of the running for President . 
He commented that [PER Putin  ] was afraid of [PER Ivanov  ] , deeply distrustful , and that he needed a weaker figure to succeed him instead . 
He argued that [PER Putin  ] understands that under the system he has created there is no real rule of law and that at any time anyone can be arrested or businesses destroyed . 
Since [PER Putin  ] reportedly had secret assets tied up abroad ( working through proxies like [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) he worried that with a strong successor like [PER Ivanov  ] the tables could be turned on [PER Putin  ] , making him the object of law enforcement investigations and [ORG Interpol  ] warnings . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] rejected speculation that [PER Putin  ] would attempt to stay a third term , saying that [PER Putin  ] did not want to be seen as a [MISC Central Asian  ] dictator . 
He asserted instead that [PER Putin  ] would become the head of [LOC United Russia  ] and that the party would transform into something akin to the former [ORG Communist Party  ] . 
He noted that the campaign for President had begun and [LOC United Russia  ] was , according to [LOC Moscow  ] Mayor [PER Yuriy Luzhkov  ] , prepared to nominate a candidate on December 17 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] dismissed the recent &For Putin8 demonstrations breaking out across the country as long-planned and financed events that were meant to preempt any attempt at a &color revolution8 in [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted the effect of a law on the [ORG Duma  ] passed two years ago that would allow [PER Putin  ] to decide to take or refuse the [ORG Duma  ] mandate not only in the next five days , but also anytime in the next four years . 
He speculated that this could be done in the interest of gaining immunity as a [ORG Duma  ] deputy should [PER Putin  ] want security from his successor . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that this issue , e.g. , security , was the driving motivation behind the [LOC Kremlin  ] , s heavy-handed approach to electoral manipulation during the [ORG Duma  ] elections . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that politically , [PER Putin  ] only trusts his spokesman [PER Aleksey Gromov  ] and [ORG Presidential Administration  ] aide [PER Sergey Sobyanin  ] , and possibly the head of the presidential security force , [PER Viktor Zolotov  ] . 
Anti-Western Rhetoric --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] acknowledged the large volume of anti-Western rhetoric that has figured prominently in the recent months leading up to the election . 
However , he said that the [MISC Russian  ] public does not necessarily share these sentiments , and is rather more neutral , if not positive , toward the [LOC U.S.  ] , despite the drumbeat of propaganda . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that [MISC Russian  ] society is not aggressive , but instead suffers from passivity and apathy . 
Nonetheless , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] added , he was optimistic that while the leadership was moving backwards in many senses , society was advancing and transforming into something more open , tolerant , and [MISC Western  ] . 
He encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue to work with society to progress in this direction for the long term .
