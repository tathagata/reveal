Continued [ORG PA Commitment to Security Coordination  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In meetings held in [LOC Ramallah  ] on February 7 , [ORG PA  ] security officials stated their continued commitment to security coordination with [LOC Israel  ] . 
Minister of [ORG Interior Said Abu  ] [PER Ali  ] told [ORG Post  ] , " We support coordination if it is in the spirit of implementing [LOC Oslo  ] , " noting that cooperation benefits both sides . 
However , he said , publicity about [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] security coordination threatens the sustainability of the [ORG PA  ] 's security campaign . 
It is essential to depoliticize these contacts and keep them out of the public eye , he noted . 
[ORG New Coordination Channels  ] ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In a separate meeting , [ORG PA Civil Police  ] Chief [PER Atallah  ] briefed [ORG Post  ] on new coordination channels between the [MISC Palestinian  ] police and their [ORG INP  ] counterparts . 
With [ORG PA  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] 's approval , the [ORG PA Civil Police  ] and [ORG INP  ] recently established four working groups to discuss the subject of violence in the H1 ( [MISC Palestinian-controlled  ] ) area of [LOC Hebron  ] . 
These working groups include the [ORG Traffic Police  ] , [ORG Criminal Investigations Department  ] , [ORG Special Police  ] , and Counternarcotics . 
[PER Atallah  ] acknowledged the need for greater coordination , but noted limits to these efforts , as the [ORG INP  ] 's responsibilities in the [LOC West Bank  ] are circumscribed . 
" [MISC One-Sided  ] " Coordination ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [PER Atallah  ] echoed Minister [PER Abu Ali  ] 's comments on the importance of continued security coordination with [LOC Israel  ] , and underscored his own willingness to continue meeting with [LOC Israel  ] Defense Forces ( [ORG IDF  ] ) representatives regardless of the political climate . 
[PER Atallah  ] said that security coordination is not only required by [ORG Oslo-era Agreements  ] , but also is in the [MISC Palestinians'  ] interest . 
He expressed concern about what he described as asymmetrical information sharing , with far more information flowing from the [MISC Palestinian  ] side to [LOC Israel  ] than is received in return . 
He also juxtaposed positive [ORG GOI  ] statements on [ORG PA  ] security efforts ( such as [MISC Israeli  ] Minister of Defense [PER Ehud Barak  ] 's praise at the recent [MISC Herzilya  ] conference ) with the [ORG GOI  ] 's unwillingness to change its rules of engagement on the ground .
