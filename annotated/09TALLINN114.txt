( C ) While [LOC Estonia  ] works to temper its political [LOC TALLINN  ] 00000114 003 OF 003 stance on [LOC Russia  ] , its defensive posture emphasizes internal defensive capabilities , based on an almost- paranoid perception of an imminent [MISC Russian  ] attack . 
The [ORG GOE  ] 's new ten-year [ORG Defense Development Plan  ] ( [ORG DDP  ] ) for 2009-2018 , published in January , was finalized after [LOC Russia  ] 's 2008 invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] ( ref C ) . 
While the [ORG DDP  ] is consistent with [ORG NATO  ] collective defense priorities , it also clearly reflects defense planners' intent to expand development of territorial and initial defense capabilities . 
The [ORG DDP  ] calls for [LOC Estonia  ] to invest in improvements to early warning assets , air defense , anti- tank , and armored maneuver capabilities to discourage aggression and to improve capabilities to support [MISC Article V  ] contingency operations . 
The [ORG DDP  ] retains conscription , expands the size of both the active duty and reserve forces and significantly increases the quantity and quality of reserve training .
