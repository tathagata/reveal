08 [LOC PARIS  ] 1698 Classified By: [PER Andrew Young  ] , Political Counselor , reason 1.4 ( b and d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG MFA  ] 's AF Assistant Secretary-equivalent [PER Stephan Gompertz  ] denied that [LOC France  ] 's approach to [LOC Africa  ] is backsliding into the patterns of previous administrations' " francafrique . 
" He insisted that [LOC France  ] is not interfering in [MISC African  ] countries' internal politics . 
He said that in the recent examples of [LOC Gabon  ] , [LOC Niger  ] , and [LOC Guinea  ] , [LOC France  ] has supported democratic change . 
[PER Gompertz  ] admits the " insider " influence of [PER Robert Bourgi  ] , and laments that [LOC France  ] is still not focused on a more strategic approach to [LOC Africa  ] . 
At the same time , he claims , ( somewhat questionably ) , that it is the [ORG MFA  ] 's leadership that is driving the [ORG GOF  ] 's relations in [LOC Africa  ] . 
In our view , [LOC France  ] remains committed to its stated policy of developing transparent partnerships with [MISC Africans  ] but , when pressed by circumstances , may resort to the more opaque ways associated with " francafrique " when doing so is in [LOC France  ] 's national interest . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a November 17 meeting with Pol Minister Counselor , the [ORG MFA  ] 's AF Assistant Secretary-equivalent [PER Stephan Gompertz  ] disputed the assertions made in a November 13 [ORG New York Times  ] article that [LOC France  ] " still pulls the strings " in [LOC Francophone Africa  ] ( " [MISC Ill Will Grows  ] in a Former [LOC Colonial Regional  ] as [LOC France  ] Consorts With the Powerful , " by [PER Adam Nossiter  ] ) , as well as similar commentary offered in recent weeks by the [MISC French  ] media . 
[PER Gompertz  ] strongly denied that [LOC France  ] interferes in a country 's internal politics , and asserted that [PER Sarkozy  ] remains serious about moving away from the paternalistic and secret dealings of [LOC France  ] 's " francafrique " era . 
( Note: see Reftels for detailed analysis of " [LOC France  ] 's Changing [MISC Africa Policy  ] . 
" End note . 
) RECENT CRITICISMS ARE " UNFAIR " ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Responding to specific cases cited in the [PER Nossiter  ] article , [PER Gompertz  ] said the selective information presented was " unfair . 
" He first seized on the example of [LOC Gabon  ] 's recent presidential elections , and insisted that [LOC France  ] would have supported a different electoral outcome than [PER Ali Bongo  ] if the opposition had organized themselves to achieve victory . 
Having received almost 60 percent of the vote , it was the splintered and uncoordinated opposition that allowed [PER Bongo  ] to win , not [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] added that in his personal view [PER Bongo  ] was a more credible candidate than the two main opposition leaders , and asserted that [PER Bongo  ] has done " a pretty good job , so far , " especially on addressing [LOC Gabon  ] 's endemic corruption. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) For [LOC Niger  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] said that " we are troubled . 
" ( The day before , with AF [PER DAS Fitzgerald  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] said that [LOC France  ] was " embarrassed " by the situation in [LOC Niger  ] . 
) [PER Gompertz  ] claimed , however , that [LOC France  ] led the international charge trying to stop President [PER Tandja  ] from changing the constitution and holding elections for a third term . 
He was bothered that the [ORG NY Times  ] piece showed an old photo of [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Tandja  ] together , without explaining that [PER Sarkozy  ] later publicly advised [PER Tandja  ] to respect [LOC Niger  ] 's constitution and not stand for a third term . 
[PER Gompertz  ] added that after [PER Tandja  ] succeeded in his constitutional referendum , State Secretary Joyandet and later Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] publicly and privately encouraged [PER Tandja  ] to postpone his election in order to work out a more democratic solution . 
[PER Gompertz  ] acknowledged that [LOC France  ] had important interests in [LOC Niger  ] , in particular its uranium concessions , and that [LOC France  ] was very concerned about [ORG AQIM  ] threats in the country . 
Still , it is unfair to describe [LOC France  ] 's efforts in [LOC Niger  ] were not sincere , [PER Gompertz  ] said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG NY Times  ] article also commented on the situation in [LOC Guinea  ] , but [PER Gompertz  ] stressed that FM [PER Kouchner  ] was the most vocal and active critic of the regime after the September 28 violence . 
According to [PER Gompertz  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] pushed for the establishment of the [ORG International Contact Group  ] , persuaded the [ORG EU  ] to take a firm stand and pursue sanctions against [LOC Guinea  ] 's ruling junta , and it was [PER Kouchner  ] who convinced [MISC Senegalese  ] President [PER Wade  ] to evacuate injured opposition leader [PER Cellou Diallo  ] to [ORG Dakar.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] noted that Senior [MISC French  ] officials , both at the [ORG MFA  ] ( and , in our experience , at the [LOC Elysee  ] ) routinely meet with [MISC African  ] opposition leaders , both in [LOC Paris  ] and overseas , adding that Joyandet was scheduled to meet with [LOC PARIS  ] 00001534 002 OF 003 [PER Cellou Diallo  ] that afternoon . 
FRANCE'S [MISC AFRICA POLICY DOES HAVE PROBLEMS  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] admitted that [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy does have problems , most notably , that [LOC France  ] continues to focus most of its efforts on its former colonies , even though they are not necessarily the most strategically important . 
[PER Gompertz  ] hopes to push for a stronger engagement with [ORG Anglophone  ] and [LOC Lusaphone Africa  ] . 
( Note: [ORG GOF  ] officials frequently cite [LOC Nigeria  ] , [LOC Angola  ] , and [LOC South Africa  ] as three of [LOC France  ] 's key emerging partners in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] was departing the same afternoon for [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] . 
End note . 
) Similarly , too much of [LOC France  ] 's political and cooperation resources in [LOC Africa  ] are designed to reinforce its partnerships within the international " [MISC Francophonie  ] " organization . 
[PER Gompertz  ] cited the example of [LOC Burundi  ] , where [MISC English  ] is replacing [MISC French  ] as the most popular foreign language , but he said this is understandable given [LOC Burundi  ] 's important trade links in the [MISC East African Community  ] . 
At the same time , he related that while he was Ambassador to [LOC Ethiopia  ] , there was a strong demand for [MISC French  ] language teachers , but [LOC France  ] was not responsive in helping meet this need. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Targeting more closely the topic of " francafrique , " [PER Gompertz  ] said he " regretted " that lawyer and presidential advisor [PER Robert Bourgi  ] ( touted by the [MISC French  ] press as the new standard bearer of the old " francafrique " ) was [PER Sarkozy  ] 's friend , but " that 's a fact of life . 
" While admitting that [PER Bourgi  ] operates in the shadows and has influence on [LOC France  ] 's approach to [LOC Africa  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] stated forcefully that policy for [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] is led by " [PER Kouchner  ] , Joyandet , and me . 
" COMMENT AND ANALYSIS -------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The sincere and mild-mannered [PER Gompertz  ] almost worked up a dander in defending [LOC France  ] 's approach to [LOC Africa  ] as well as the importance of the [ORG MFA  ] 's leadership . 
However , though not entirely at odds with [PER Gompertz  ] 's assertions , the [ORG GOF  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy hands increasingly suggest [LOC France  ] 's need to contrast the importance of stability in a volatile region with nobler democratic ideals , as has been shown in [LOC Niger  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] , [LOC Madagascar  ] , and , perhaps , now in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
Unfortunately , there was not time during this meeting to ask about other notorious " francafrique " hotspots , such as the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] , [LOC Togo  ] , [PER Cameron  ] , and [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] . 
Also , by downplaying the role of [PER Bourgi  ] , and by not commenting on the important role of the [LOC Presidency  ] 's Secretary General [PER Claude Gueant  ] ( also a friend of [PER Bourgi  ] ) in shaping [LOC France  ] 's relations with [MISC African  ] leaders , [PER Gompertz  ] , perhaps unwittingly , revealed his own concerns about a philosophical division between the [LOC Elysee  ] and the [ORG MFA  ] on [LOC Africa  ] policy. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Clearly , there is much jostling between the [ORG MFA  ] and [LOC Presidency  ] for [LOC Africa  ] policy leadership . 
[PER Remi Marechaux  ] , one of the staff-level [LOC Africa  ] advisors at the [LOC Elysee  ] , scoffs whenever the issue of a resurgent " francafrique " is raised . 
He pointedly notes that during " francafrique 's " heyday under the legendary [PER Jacques Foccart  ] , the [LOC Africa  ] cell at the [LOC Presidency  ] numbered about 80 , including its own intelligence unit . 
[PER Marechaux  ] contrasts that with today 's [LOC Africa  ] cell at the [LOC Presidency  ] , consisting of himself , [PER Romain Serman  ] ( soon to be replaced by [PER Clement Leclerc  ] ) , and their recently-arrived boss ( and [ORG Deputy Diplomatic Advisor  ] ) [PER Andre Parant  ] , who replaced [PER Bruno Joubert  ] . 
[PER Marechaux  ] bristles at the notion that the three of them are pulling strings the way their 80 predecessors did . 
[PER Marechaux  ] says that the role of the [LOC Elysee  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] cell is to channel the policy ideas of President [PER Sarkozy  ] ( admittedly influenced by [PER Bourgi  ] , [PER Gueant  ] , special advisor [PER Henri Guaino  ] , and [PER Sarkozy  ] 's other close associates ) and that the [ORG MFA  ] 's role is to do what bureaucracies traditionally do -- either implement those ideas or explain , with bureaucratic thoroughness , why those ideas are not feasible. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Our own view is that there is a wide range of policy approaches available to the [MISC French  ] , a spectrum running from the more ideal approaches [PER Sarkozy  ] expressed in his early days in office ( reftels ) to the more opaque but possibly more expedient approaches conforming to the old " francafrique " model . 
Circumstances and the unpredictable , sometimes violent nature of events in [LOC Africa  ] may at times tempt or even force the [MISC French  ] to act less ideally than they may want -- a form of behavior familiar to every other government in the [LOC PARIS  ] 00001534 003 OF 003 world -- when decisions are based on a need to further the national interest in the most effective way possible , even when the most effective way may not be the prettiest way . 
We find the [ORG GOF  ] 's professional cadre of [LOC Africa  ] hands accessible , open , and wanting to find common ground with the [LOC U.S.  ] in many situations . 
[PER Gompertz  ] appeared as a man with a burden lifted when he was reminded of The [ORG New York Times'  ] November 17 article asserting large-scale corruption by [MISC Equatorial Guinean  ] Minister ( and the President 's son ) , [PER Teodoro Nguema Obiang  ] , reportedly a frequent visitor to and investor in the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Conakry  ] and [LOC Tripoli  ] minimize considered .
