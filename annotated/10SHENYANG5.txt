Wickman  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) an d ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Summary: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told Poloff [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [PER Kim Jong-il  ] has recently reversed decisions and struggled to implement policies , showing increasing indecisiveness . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also reported that the children of high-ranking [ORG DPRK  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] officials hijack deals and aid projects for their own aggrandizement . 
[MISC Chinese  ] state electric companies are currently bidding to build the grid for the [MISC DPRK’s  ] planned large-scale increase in power generation and transmission capacity , but apart from the goal to build 100,000 new apartments in [LOC Pyongyang  ] , few of the [MISC DPRK’s  ] other objectives for 2012 will likely be achieved . 
Construction of the bridge from [LOC Dandong  ] to [LOC Sinuiju  ] , seems set to begin in 2010 , however , [LOC China  ] paying for both the bridge and a road on the [LOC DPRK  ] side . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that [LOC North Koreans  ] having connections and/or money , continue to receive permission to work in [LOC Northeast China  ] , despite reports of a recent general recall . 
End Summary . 
PROMISING THE MOON TO “THE SUN” ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] PolOff met again with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Kim Jong-il  ] has become increasingly indecisive since his stroke and other health problems . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed to a recent decision to recall students , scholars , and scientists working or studying in [LOC China  ] as a result of a single student’s defection in [LOC Beijing  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said business and trade groups with interests in [LOC Northeast China  ] had pressured [PER Kim Jong-il  ] to reverse the decision , which he apparently did , and companies in [LOC Northeast China  ] are currently developing “positions needing to be filled” to enable those who left the country to get new visas. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , not only does [PER Kim Jong-il  ] decide to reverse policies on his own , but officials also chart their own course as different factions competing for Kim’s attention , making it difficult for [PER Kim  ] to set a firm , clear direction . 
Wary of [MISC China’s  ] increasing hold on precious minerals and mining rights in the [LOC DPRK  ] , many [MISC North Korean  ] officials oppose mineral concessions as a means to attract [MISC Chinese  ] investment . 
However , the former Consul General of the [ORG DPRK’s Shenyang Consulate  ] , in an effort to fund the construction of the plan to build 100,000 new apartments in [LOC Pyongyang  ] , continues to offer mining and fishing rights to [MISC Chinese  ] investors . 
He attracted more than [ORG RMB  ] 12 billion in investment , more than enough to protect himself from the direct attacks of these opponents . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , over-reporting of actual value is a common phenomenon on the part of [LOC North Koreans  ] charged with securing foreign investment . 
For instance , a commitment of [ORG RMB  ] 10 million is reported to [LOC Pyongyang  ] as a commitment of [MISC USD  ] 10 million or more and the actual sum ( the [ORG RMB  ] 10 million ) is reported as a first tranche . 
After the initial investment is realized , the central government is told that the foreign investor demands further preferences in order to inject more money . 
The reporting officials count on the central government either taking additional steps to attract the extra investment or doing something to upset the [MISC Chinese  ] investor . 
In the latter case , the official can blame the lack of realizing the investment on political factors out of his control . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] provided no examples of the [LOC DPRK  ] central government acquiescing to the demand for additional concessions . 
PRC-DPRK INVESTMENT DISPUTES: NOT JUST WITHIN THE [LOC DPRK  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [MISC Chinese  ] state-owned enterprises have placed restrictions on investing in [LOC North Korea  ] but that a number of privatized [MISC Chinese  ] companies in which the state remains a significant shareholder have invested in the [LOC DPRK  ] . 
Disputes with [MISC North Korean  ] counterparts develop all the time , XXXXXXXXXXXXnoted . 
Saying: “It was hard to say” how such disputes are resolved , XXXXXXXXXXXXgave the impression they are seldom , if ever , resolved . 
Investment disputes related to [LOC North Korea  ] also SHENYANG 00000005 002 OF 002 occur between competing investors in [LOC China  ] . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , for example , two [MISC Chinese  ] companies - [ORG Shandong Guoda Gold Company  ] , [ORG Ltd.  ] and [MISC Zhejiang-based  ] [PER Wanxiang Group  ] - are battling for access to [ORG Huishan Copper Mine  ] , the biggest copper mine in the [LOC DPRK  ] . 
[ORG Huishan  ] , near the [LOC DPRK-China  ] border is rich in gold , silver , and other valuable metals as well . 
Though [ORG MOFCOM  ] approved both joint-venture deals , each company wants to be the sole developer . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes [PER Wanxiang  ] , which has close ties to Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] , will likely win out , [ORG Shandong Guoda  ] receiving a payment to quietly go away . 
Without naming names , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also suggested the strong possibility that someone had made a payment ( on the order of [MISC USD  ] 10,000 ) to secure the Premier’s support . 
PRINCELINGS BEHAVING BADLY --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) According toXXXXXXXXXXXX , the children of high-ranking [MISC North Korean  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] officials hijack the most favorable investment and aid deals for their own enrichment . 
When the child of a high-ranking official hears of a [MISC Chinese  ] aid proposal to [LOC North Korea  ] , he will travel to [LOC North Korea  ] to convince the relevant official to follow his instructions for implementing the aid project . 
He will then use his connections to request proposals from [MISC Chinese  ] companies to develop the project , returning to [LOC North Korea  ] to convince the relevant official to select the favored company . 
At each step , money changes hands , and the well-connected [MISC Chinese  ] go-between pockets a tidy sum . 
For the offspring of officials in the [LOC DPRK  ] , there are also ample opportunities to work in [LOC China  ] . 
In a typical situation , a [LOC DPRK  ] official will alert another official to an opportunity for the second official’s child to work in [LOC China  ] for a [ORG DPRK-Chinese  ] joint venture . 
After signing a contract , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] it is a cheap , easy process to obtain the necessary permit from the [MISC Chinese  ] provincial [ORG Bureau of Labor and Social Security  ] . 
He said the system is similar to the “ting xin , liu zhi” system in [LOC China  ] in the 1980s , in which officials retained their government position with a suspended salary while going to work for a private company. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has seen a number of similarities between the [LOC DPRK  ] and [LOC China  ] since his first visit in 1998 . 
He compared the impact of the famine on [LOC North Koreans  ] to the impact the [LOC Great Leap Forward  ] ( [ORG GLF  ] ) had on [MISC Chinese  ] in the countryside . 
Both incidents forced individuals to lose faith in the government’s ability to provide a basic standard of living and created a sharp instinct for self-preservation . 
He also sees similarities between the [ORG GLF  ] and current plans in the [LOC DPRK  ] to become a strong country by 2012 . 
During his previous meeting with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] spoke of plans to build 100,000 apartments in [LOC Pyongyang  ] by 2012 . 
[LOC North Korea  ] also plans to increase electricity generation capacity by building coal-fired power plants and hydropower plants , and to increase transmission capacity by extending grids to all secondary cities . 
[MISC Chinese  ] electric companies are currently bidding on the grid projects . 
Despite the need for increased electricity in [LOC North Korea  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said it is almost impossible that [LOC North Korea  ] will reach its goals in the next few years . 
The focus more likely will be on the apartment blocks as these are big , physical things that people can see as a mark of progress . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes the long-planned bridge from [LOC Dandong  ] to [LOC Sinuiju  ] will begin construction next year and that [LOC China  ] will pay for the entire project , including a highway on the [MISC North Korean  ] side of the border ( Ref B ) .
