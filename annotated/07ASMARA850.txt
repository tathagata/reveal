( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: As the investigation into the shooting of [ORG National Security Agency Deputy Colonel  ] [PER Simon Ghebredenghil  ] continues , an [MISC Eritrean  ] businessman believed to be involved in the assassination attempt was shot and killed by Government of the [ORG State of Eritrea  ] ( [ORG GSE  ] ) officials near the [MISC Ethiopian  ] border . 
The [ORG GSE  ] allegedly has arrested over 500 individuals in connection with the shooting , which may include the arrest of [LOC General Gerezgheri  ] " [PER Wuchu  ] " [PER Andemariam  ] on October 24 . 
The emerging details surrounding the assassination attempt are shining a bright light on the extent of corruption within the senior ranks of the military and showing the cracks in the outwardly unified faade of the President [PER Isaias'  ] government . 
Post will continue to monitor fallout from this incident and its possible implications for the [ORG GSE  ] 's inner circle and military preparedness in the face of possible conflict on the [MISC Eritrean-Ethiopian  ] border . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- -- IMPLICATED BUSINESSMAN [PER SAMSON  ] KILLED BY THE [ORG GSE  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S/NF ) Following the October 13 assassination attempt on Colonel [PER Simon Ghebrendenghil  ] , wealthy [MISC Eritrean  ] businessman [PER Samson  ] ( [ORG LNU  ] ) , who had been implicated in the attempt , fled [LOC Asmara  ] . 
Accompanied by the personal driver of [LOC General Gerezgheri  ] " [PER Wuchu  ] " [PER Andemariam  ] and a military guard under [LOC General Wuchu  ] 's command , [PER Samson  ] traveled overland in a military [MISC Landcruiser  ] stocked with a cache of arms . 
The group took refuge in an [MISC Eritrean  ] Orthodox Church monastery near [LOC Adi Quala  ] ( to which [PER Samson  ] previously had made donations ) waiting for the right time to flee across the [MISC Ethiopian  ] border . 
[ORG GSE  ] officials tracked [PER Samson  ] to the monastery . 
A firefight ensued and [PER Samson  ] was killed . 
The driver and guard were taken into custody and returned to [LOC Asmara  ] . 
In a separate conversation with Emboff , XXXXXXXXXXXX confirmed [PER Samson  ] 's death , the existence of the weapons cache and the presence of General [PER Wuchu  ] 's driver and guard at the shootout between [PER Samson  ] and the [ORG GSE  ] officials. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Samson  ] , who was also know as the " civilian general " , had a long-time business relationship with General [PER Wuchu  ] and others in the [MISC Eritrean  ] military . 
In his late 30 's , he ran a hardware and import/export business reported to have made millions by means of government contracts arranged by high-ranking military officials , and illegal foreign currency transactions and import/export exchanges over the past ten years . 
A partial owner of the [LOC Midian Hotel  ] , [PER Samson  ] reportedly used the hotel as a means to launder money for military and government officials. ----------------------- GENERAL [PER WUCHU  ] ARRESTED ? ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S/NF ) Rumors abound as to the status of General [PER Wuchu  ] . 
The reports have varied from claiming his departure from the country to his death . 
One [MISC Eritrean  ] contact told [ORG Poloff  ] he saw General [PER Wuchu  ] driving through [LOC Asmara  ] on Monday , October <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
The resident [ORG Reuters  ] stringer shared with [ORG Poloff  ] that in the late afternoon on Wednesday , October 24 one of his sources informed him of General [PER Wuchu  ] 's arrest . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX told to [ORG Poloff  ] on Friday , October 26 that the [ORG GSE  ] had arrested General [PER Wuchu  ] earlier in the week .

) ----------------------------------------- BUSINESSMAN FIKRE'S DEATH AND HIS FUNERAL ----------------------------------------- [LOC ASMARA  ] 00000850 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Reading like a [PER John Grisham  ] novel , more details of the circumstances leading to [MISC Fikremariam  ] " [ORG Fikre  ] " [PER Andemariam  ] 's death are coming to light . 
( [ORG Fikre  ] 's death allegedly was the lead up to the assassination attempt . 
) According to a well-connected [MISC Eritrean  ] , the saga began several months ago when [PER Samson  ] and three other businessman approached General [PER Wuchu  ] to contest the awarding of a tender to [ORG Fikre  ] 's company for installation of water pipes in the city of [LOC Asmara  ] . 
Despite the protests and [ORG GSE  ] investigation , [ORG Fikre  ] retained the contract . 
( Note: [ORG Fikre  ] 's company had also received all of the supply contracts for the construction of the [ORG Sawa Military Camp  ] in western [LOC Eritrea  ] for the past 10 years . 
End note . 
) Tensions arose given the fierce competition among the few [MISC Eritrean  ] businessmen who receive government contracts ) contracts that are primarily awarded to friends of high-ranking government officials ( namely the military ) who then skim a portion of the profits for themselves . 
[ORG Fikre  ] reportedly began to fear for his life and asked for protection from XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [ORG Fikre  ] returned to [LOC Asmara  ] the week of October 1 , at which point , the [ORG GSE  ] detained him in Police [LOC Station  ] #2 , with at least two of his brothers . 
( Note: The brothers were released after a few days . 
In addition , employees of [ORG Fikre  ] 's supply company have been in detention in Police [LOC Station  ] #2 since the middle of August . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Fikre  ] reportedly died in jail on October 8 . 
The family requested an autopsy be completed prior to his burial , protesting that [ORG Fikre  ] had been young and healthy when entering the jail only a few days earlier . 
An [MISC Eritrean  ] contact told [ORG Poloff  ] that only President [PER Isaias  ] , Colonel [PER Ghebredenghil  ] and XXXXXXXXXXXX received copies of the autopsy report . 
Despite never having done his mandatory national service , [ORG Fikre  ] received a hero 's burial and was laid to rest in [LOC Asmara' Martyr  ] 's Cemetery on October 12 . 
The funeral became a city-wide event . 
One witness commented that attendance at [ORG Fikre  ] 's funeral exceeded that of the two biggest funerals since the country 's 1993 referendum - the former Foreign Minister 's funeral in 2005 and the funeral of one of the founders of the struggle in 2000 . 
He observed that the turnout essentially represented a silent demonstration by the people , as they are unable to protest in other ways. ----------------------- THE GSE'S OFFICIAL SPIN ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Government of the [ORG State of Eritrea  ] ( [ORG GSE  ] ) announced Tuesday , October 23 that " perpetrators " of the assassination attempt on Colonel [PER Simon Ghebredenghil  ] were in [ORG GSE  ] custody , although the announcement did not include the names of those arrested . 
In an interview with [ORG Reuters  ] , Acting Minister of Information [PER Ali Abdu  ] stated " the government had full control of the situation " but refused to comment on the details of the detentions . 
According to the Acting Minister , the investigation is ongoing. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Complementing the statements about the investigation , the [ORG GSE  ] published an editorial about fighting corruption in the [MISC Arabic  ] , [LOC Tigrinya  ] and [MISC English  ] government-controlled newspapers . 
Describing corruption as , " treason against our martyrs " , and a vice that " pollutes and weakens any given society " , the editorial likened fighting corruption to continuing the independence struggle and urged the people to join with the Government to fight against corruption . 
The editorial further insisted that " law enforcement bodies and the means for surveillance at their disposable should be strengthened and constantly updated " , thus empowering the [ORG GSE  ] to fight corruption by any means necessary . 
[LOC ASMARA  ] 00000850 003 OF 003 ------------------------------- WHAT THE MAN ON THE STREET SAYS ------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Residents of [LOC Asmara  ] state they were aware of the shenanigans of their military officers and their corrupt business activities . 
For example , General [PER Filipos Woldeyohannes  ] ( formerly head of the western [LOC Gash Barka  ] region and now head of the [LOC Asmara  ] region ) is well-known as the " go-to " general to arrange an escape to [LOC Sudan  ] . 
Many [MISC Eritreans  ] regularly gossip about the homes which have been appropriated from civilians and given to military or government officials , or about the foreign travel of the officers' families . 
As the details about corruption in the military become public , [ORG Poloff  ] has heard a common refrain that " it is about time " these activities have come under public scrutiny . 
Many [MISC Eritrean  ] observers believe that this incident will begin to crack the iron grip of President [PER Isaias  ] and his military officials over the government and the people of [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
One high-ranking government official told [ORG Emboff  ] , " Thank goodness . 
Now maybe things will change for the better . 
" ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The assassination attempt on Colonel [PER Ghebredenghil  ] has created a real dilemma for the [ORG GSE  ] by publicizing the existence of deep-rooted corruption within the military -- making it impossible for the [ORG GSE  ] to hide or deny these charges . 
Within the higher levels of the [ORG GSE  ] , there appear to be a split into two tiers: those who are still committed to the ideals of independence struggle and who will use any means to bankroll and continue the struggle , and those out to make as much money as possible for their own bank accounts . 
The question remains: can the first tier ) the President and his immediate circle - effectively battle and contain the fallout from this incident or does this incident presage the beginning of the regime 's fall from grace ? <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S/NF ) Post will continue to monitor the potential impacts on the military . 
Multiple sources indicate that the [ORG GSE  ] leadership anticipates an outbreak of hostilities with [LOC Ethiopia  ] in the near future . 
With General [PER Wuchu  ] possibly in prison , speculation from many observers that General [PER Filipos  ] is next , and reports that numerous colonels have fled or are in prison , the military leadership is clearly shaken and the impact on morale of the military is unknown at this point . 
Finally , if the [ORG GSE  ] cracks down on the illegal financial operations of the military and its privileged businessmen , the [ORG GSE  ] may end up limiting those resources available to the military for maintaining its large number of recruits and to prepare for conflict .
