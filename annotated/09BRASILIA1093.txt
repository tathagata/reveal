[LOC Brazil  ] 's priorities for this year 's [MISC UNGA  ] are little different than in previous years: [ORG UNSC  ] reform , [LOC Haiti  ] and stability in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
With recent controversy in the region surrounding the announcement of the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] , [ORG Ministry for External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) [ORG UN  ] Director [PER Gilda Neves  ] reports that [ORG MRE  ] will recommend that President [PER Lula use  ] his speech to the [MISC UNGA  ] to highlight the principles of national sovereignty and the undesireability of having foreign forces stationed in the region . 
According to [PER Neves  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] favors a meeting between President [PER Obama  ] and [ORG UNASUL  ] leaders on the margins of the [MISC UNGA  ] . 
This hard line approach , combined with private overtures to the [ORG USG  ] , is consistent with the approach [ORG MRE  ] officials outlined in ref a of criticizing the [ORG USG  ] publicly to gain favor with [LOC Venezuela  ] and other neighboring governments that would help [LOC Brazil  ] moderate their reactions. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
For [LOC Brazil  ] , a key factor for this year 's [MISC UNGA  ] will be preparation for [LOC Brazil  ] 's expected 2010 return to the [ORG Security Council  ] as a non-permanent member . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] leaders plan to begin bilateral consultations with [ORG UNSC  ] members , particularly the P5 , to formulate positions on key issues the the [ORG Council  ] is expected to address in 2010 . 
According to [PER Neves  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] believes that the [ORG UN  ] has " room to do more " to manage potential conflicts in such places as [LOC Guinea Bissau  ] and [LOC East Timor  ] . 
COMMENT: The [ORG GOB  ] considers the upcoming [ORG UNSC  ] term to be important as a means of maing [LOC Brazil  ] 's case , particularly to other developing countries , for a permamnent seat . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[PER Neves  ] expressed pessimism toward the [ORG UNSC  ] reform process . 
She saw the inter governmental negotiations as deadlocked by competing interests with little chance of consensus and was dismissive of potential compromise proposals . 
According to [PER Neves  ] , the best chance for progress would be if the [ORG USG  ] were to come out strongly in favor of a proposal for a reformed [ORG UNSC  ] and bring along other P5 members . 
This would result in a " large majority " in the [LOC GA  ] . 
[PER Neves  ] saw [LOC France  ] as most sympathetic to [LOC Brazil  ] 's aspirations but admitted that the [MISC French  ] were more concerned with keeping their own [ORG UNSC  ] seat in the face of pressure to avoid over representation of [LOC Europe  ] , than in helping [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Having recently visited [MISC Brazilian  ] peacekeepers in [LOC Haiti  ] , [PER Neves  ] commented that while there had been progress in building civil society over the last year , the [ORG UN  ] mission suffered from inadequate resources . 
Although the April 2009 donors conference resulted in $300 million in pledges , none of these funds have begun to support [ORG UN  ] activities . 
The increase in the numbers have [MISC Brazilian  ] military engineers has provided a much needed capability to [LOC MINUSTAH  ] , but the [MISC Brazilians  ] are limited in what they can do by a lack of materials . 
The [ORG UN  ] has provided what it can , and [LOC Brazil  ] is now looking for national contributions that will allow its engineers to take on more infrastructure building projects .
