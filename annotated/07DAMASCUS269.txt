<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 000269 SIPDIS SIPDIS NEA/ELA ; TREASURY FOR LEBENSON/GLASER/SZUBIN ; [ORG NSC  ] FOR MARCHESE EO 12958 DECL: 03/06/2017 TAGS EFIN , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC ETTC  ] , [LOC SY  ] , SANC SUBJECT: TREASURY TEAM’S DAMASCUS CONSULTATIONS ON FINANCIAL SANCTIONS REF: [PER A. DAMASCUS  ] 0108 B. 05 DAMASCUS 6224 Classified By: Charge d’Affaires [PER Michael Corbin  ] , reasons 1.4 b/d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [ORG Treasury  ] representatives recently visited Post to discuss options for using financial sanctions to apply pressure to the [MISC Syrian  ] regime . 
We discussed: -- Treasury’s requirements for finalizing the pending designations of [PER Mohammad Sulayman  ] and [PER Ali Mamluk  ] , and Treasury’s information requirements for a public statement ; -- Treasury’s need to maintain the legal thread between the classified designation packet and the public statement announcing the designation ; -- Post’s support for designating [PER Mohammad Nassif Kheirbek  ] , SARG pointman for its relationship with [LOC Iran  ] ; -- How designating regime financiers like [PER Rami  ] and [PER Mohammad Mahlouf  ] could be problematic without a new Executive Order on corruption . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) PENDING DESIGNATIONS: Post understands the designations for [PER Mohammad Sulieman  ] , [MISC Syrian  ] Special Presidential Advisor for [ORG Arms Procurement and Strategic Weapons  ] and [PER Ali Mamluk  ] , Chief of the [MISC Syrian  ] General Intelligence Directorate , are pending due to a lack of unclassified material necessary for Treasury’s public SIPDIS designation statement . 
In post’s estimate , [PER Mohammad Sulayman  ] is a relatively low-payoff target . 
His activities are not widely known , which will make it difficult to obtain unclassified information for a public statement and , SIPDIS likewise , make it unlikely that his designation would resonate inside [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Ali Mamluk  ] , on the other hand , is more well-known within [LOC Syria  ] , especially for involvement in his objectionable activities regarding [LOC Lebanon  ] , and his suppressing [MISC Syrian  ] civil society and the internal opposition . 
Therefore , Mamluk’s designation will likely have a larger impact with local and regional audiences if the public statement announcing his designation also discusses his oppression of [MISC Syrian  ] society. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We understood from our visit with [ORG Treasury  ] representatives that although we are limited to designating regime members under the existing Executive Orders , there is some flexibility in [ORG Treasury  ] , s public statement announcing the designation . 
Post has advocated that no matter the legal basis of the designation , any public designation should focus on themes that resonate inside [MISC Syria:  ] corruption , suppression of civil society , and denial of basic human rights ( ref A ) . 
The need to maintain the “legal thread” between the designation packet and the public announcement could be challenging on cases like [PER Mohamad Sulieman  ] whose links to corruption are less clear . 
In cases like [PER Ali Mamluk  ] , however , the role of the organization he heads in suppressing internal dissent is publicly known in [LOC Syria  ] and stating as much in our statement would resonate well here. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Post also supports moving forward with the designation packet on [PER Mohammad Nasif Kheirbek  ] , [MISC Syrian  ] Deputy Vice-President for Security and lead [MISC Syrian  ] liaison to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Keirbek’s designation could play to a SARG vulnerability , in this case , the [MISC SARG’s  ] relationship with [LOC Iran  ] , which worries the [MISC Sunni  ] majority . 
Designation of regime pillars involved with the [MISC SARG’s  ] partnership with [LOC Iran  ] could heighten [MISC Syrian  ] and regional concerns about the [MISC SARG’s  ] willingness to accomodate an expansionary [MISC Iranian  ] agenda. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) REGIEME FINANCIERS: We also discussed the possibility of targeting high-profile inner circle members and regime financiers like [PER Rami Mahklouf  ] ( [PER Asad’s  ] first cousin ) and [PER Mohammad Makhlouf  ] ( [PER Rami’s  ] father ) in the next phase of targeted financial sanctions . 
Based on our consultation with the [ORG Treasury  ] representatives , it seemed apparent that without an Executive Order on corruption it would be difficult to compile enough information to designate this group under the current executive orders . 
The other option for pursuing this group would be to show how these individuals provided financial support to previously designated individuals such as [PER Asif Shawkat  ] . 
This course of action could prove highly problematic given the regime’s proficiency at obfuscating its financial transactions ( ref B ) .

( S ) Comment . 
Post thanks [ORG Treasury  ] for its team’s February 25-27 visit and welcomes any additional feedback that [LOC Washington  ] agencies may have on our recommendations covered in ref [PER A. Post  ] continues to believe targeted financial sanctions are a tool appropriate for the [MISC Syrian  ] setting but this tool requires further work to fully develop .
