( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: National opinion polls taken two weeks out show the current government coalition holding a slim lead ahead of [MISC Icelandic  ] parliamentary elections on May 12 . 
The larger of the two parties in government , the [ORG Independence Party  ] , has gained in strength enough to offset losses by its junior partner , the [ORG Progressive Party  ] , according to current polls . 
However , nearly a third of voters are undecided at this late stage . 
This may be due to a popular sense that environmental issues have lost their " flavor of the month " status after a local referendum put the kibosh on aluminum smelter expansion plans in a suburb of [ORG Reykjavik  ] . 
As a result , no single issue is driving voter preferences . 
This may play into the hands of the current government , or , as some pundits argue , could open the door for a ( possibly unstable ) three-party coalition to take the helm . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Gallup  ] and daily newspaper [ORG Frettabladid  ] each released their latest polling data on voter preferences over the weekend of April 28-29 , two weeks ahead of [MISC Icelandic  ] elections to the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) . 
The results were as follows: Percentage of voters expressing a preference ( Gallup/Frettabladid ) : [ORG Independence  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) : 39/40 [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) : 21/23 [MISC Left-Green  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) : 21/18 Progressive ( [ORG PP  ] ) : 10/10 Liberal ( [ORG LP  ] ) : 5/5 [ORG Iceland Movement  ] ( [ORG IM  ] ) : 2/3 Undecided/no preference stated: 18 and 35 percent of respondents , respectively. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Gallup  ] data shows a decline for the [ORG IP  ] from previous polls , though the party has gained in comparison to its standing in previous [ORG Frettabladid  ] polling ( [MISC Ref A  ] ) . 
In all other respects , the two polls show roughly the same trends . 
The [ORG PP  ] 's slide has stopped , though the party will lose roughly half its current seats in the [ORG Althingi  ] . 
Though the " right-green " [ORG Iceland Movement  ] seems to have peaked in support , it still looks set to undermine the [MISC Left-Green  ] party 's dreams of riding a " green wave " to power as the larger member of a two-party leftist government . 
That said , the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] would still be forced to deal with the LG as equals rather than a fringe party. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most significantly , the results show the current [MISC IP-PP  ] coalition holding power , though only by a single seat once results are broken down by voting district . 
Some here have fallen back on conventional wisdom dictating that the [ORG Independence Party  ] always performs worse than the polls indicate , while the [MISC Progressives  ] generally do better than expected . 
( [MISC Note: A  ] prominent counter-example to the latter was the Progressive 's dismal performance in municipal elections across the country last year , forcing then-party leader and PM Halldor Asgrimsson to resign . 
End note . 
) If the [ORG PP  ] fails to live up to its end of this " bargain , " however , it would open the door to a center-left coalition of the [ORG SDA  ] , Left-Greens , and [MISC Progressives  ] . 
One prominent former Prime Minister views this as the most likely outcome , and told [ORG Reykjavik  ] 's diplomatic corps at an off-record briefing that this would usher in a period of political instability given the strong differences on economic and industrial policy among these three parties. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) A large part of the instability reflected in these polls is the share of undecided voters ( over a third in the [ORG Frettabladid  ] poll , which featured a larger sample size ) just two weeks prior to the election . 
Observers point to the town of [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] 's March 31 referendum on expansion of the aluminum smelter there , which opposition parties hoped to use to build momentum heading into the [ORG Althingi  ] elections ( Ref B ) . 
After the town voted to reject the expansion plans , environmental issues seem to have lost their salience for a large part of the electorate . 
The [ORG Frettabladid  ] poll indicated that among the same respondents environmental issues have slipped to fifth ( previously first ) on the list of key election matters , behind social welfare , education , the economy , and taxes . 
Pundits argue that the [LOC Hafnarfjordur  ] vote served as a catharsis for voters outside the town , who now feel free to vote their preference without having to use their vote on a purely environmental message. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: As the opposition parties appear to be searching for a new key issue now that environmental protection has lost some of its resonance , the government parties continue to hope that they will enjoy the advantage of incumbency and [LOC Iceland  ] 's recent economic prosperity . 
If predictions of a three-party center-left coalition are to be believed , a poor showing by the [MISC Progressives  ] may indeed put them in a stronger " kingmaker " position than they would be by throwing their lot in with the [ORG Independence Party  ] . 
[ORG IP  ] stalwarts have told Post that a continued [MISC IP-PP  ] coalition would reflect the [ORG PP  ] 's diminished share more so than the current government , in which [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000127 002 OF 002 the [MISC Progressives  ] hold fully half the cabinet seats . 
The [MISC Progressives  ] may feel they would have more leverage in an SDA-LG-PP coalition to get the ministries they want , though it is hard to imagine what policies and programs such a government could agree on .
