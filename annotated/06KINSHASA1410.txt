KINSHASA  ] 1271 [PER B. KINSHASA  ] 1272 [PER C. KINSHASA  ] 1392 Classified By: EconOff DPopovich for reasons 1.4 b/d/e. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Four [MISC EmbOffs  ] and an [MISC Econ  ] LES toured the [ORG Kinshasa Nuclear Research Center  ] ( [ORG CREN-K  ] ) July 27 to assess security and determine its needs . 
[ORG CREN-K  ] houses the [MISC DRC’s  ] two nuclear reactors , neither of which functions , although staff continue to conduct nuclear-related research and teaching at the facility . 
External and internal security is poor , leaving the facility vulnerable to theft . 
The [ORG GDRC  ] needs international assistance to secure the facility and its nuclear materials . 
End Summary . 
Physical Layout --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) July 27 , Professor [PER Fortunat Lumu Badimbayi-Matu  ] ( [PER Lumu  ] ) , the Director of [ORG CREN-K  ] and the [ORG DRC’s Atomic Energy Commission  ] , gave four [MISC Emboffs  ] and an [MISC Econ  ] LES a tour of [MISC CREN-K’s  ] facility , the location of the [MISC DRC’s  ] two nuclear reactors ( reftels A , B , C ) . 
CRENK-K is on approximately five acres of land on the edge of the [ORG University of Kinshasa  ] campus , a 45 minute to one hour drive from downtown . 
The facility is composed of approximately five buildings . 
One building houses one reactor , one houses the second reactor and one acts as a small nuclear waste storage room . 
The remaining buildings are used as offices , research laboratories and classrooms . 
Nuclear Material ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC DRC’s  ] two nuclear reactors consist of a 1959 [MISC Triga  ] I reactor and a 1972 [ORG Triga II  ] reactor . 
Neither functions . 
The [MISC Triga  ] I reactor was retired in 1970 , and the [ORG Triga II  ] reactor ceased functioning in 1992 when the reactor’s control center experienced an electrical problem that made it impossible to control . 
[ORG CREN-K  ] also has 138 nuclear fuel rods ( [ORG LEU  ] ) . 
( Note: [ORG CREN-K  ] originally had 140 fuel rods . 
Two of these , however , were stolen by unidentified thieves in 1998 . 
[MISC Italian  ] authorities later recovered one of these fuel rods from the [MISC Italian  ] [ORG Mafia  ] in [LOC Rome  ] , who were allegedly trying to sell it to unidentified buyers in the [MISC Middle-East  ] . 
The second fuel rod has never been found . 
End note . 
) 56 fuel rods are stored in the heavy water of the [MISC Triga  ] I reactor , 74 are stored in the heavy water of the [ORG Triga II  ] reactor . 
Nine others have never been used and are stored in a separate room. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Lumu  ] , the total amount of radioactive material in the [ORG Triga II  ] reactor consists of 10.5 kilograms of non-enriched uranium ( U-238 ) and 5.1 kilograms of enriched uranium ( U-235 , enriched to 20 percent ) . 
[PER Lumu  ] did not provide information about [ORG Triga I.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A [ORG CREN-K  ] technician told EconOff that the facility has approximately 23 kilograms of nuclear waste , stored in the nuclear waste storage building in four 50 gallon drums . 
It consists of [LOC Radium 226  ] , neutron sources ( nfi ) and [ORG Cesium  ] 137 . 
Security -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A fence approximately six feet high surrounds some of [ORG CREN-K  ] . 
The fence is constructed of cement in some places and chain-link in others . 
The fence is not lit at night , has no razor-wire across the top , and is not monitored by video surveillance . 
There is also no cleared buffer zone between it and the surrounding vegetation . 
There are numerous holes in the fence , and large gaps where the fence was missing altogether . 
[ORG University of Kinshasa  ] students frequently walk through the fence to cut across [ORG CREN-K  ] , and subsistence farmers grow manioc on the facility next to the nuclear waste storage building . 
( Note: In mid March 2006 , an [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) contractor detected elevated levels of radiation in this manioc plot using a [PER Geiger  ] counter . 
End note . 
) No fence separates the nuclear waste storage building and the [ORG University of Kinshasa’s  ] women’s dormitory . 
The two buildings sit approximately 300 meters apart , and one can walk freely from one to the other across the manioc field . 
[ORG KINSHASA  ] 00001410 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Three security officers guard [ORG CREN-K  ] at any one time . 
A team of 21 security guards , which consists of nine [ORG DRC  ] police officers and 12 private security guards , rotate shifts 24 hours a day , 365 days per year . 
The guards usually stand at one of two control points of entry to the facility: the main drive-in gate or the pedestrian entrance . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , some are elderly , and some are occasionally caught sleeping on the job . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and both groups lack training. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) None of [MISC CREN-K’s  ] buildings have sophisticated locks , intrusion alarms , motion detectors or video surveillance systems . 
Once inside the facility , no one controls the entrance to the nuclear reactor , although a key is required to enter the room . 
The fuel rod storage room where the nine unused fuel rods are stored was not locked , and the fuel rods are not kept in a separate locked container. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The nuclear waste storage building , which is a separate structure approximately 500 meters from the main building , is approximately 15 square meters . 
It was constructed of about 12 inch thick bricks , and has one iron door and several small windows near the roof . 
The door was locked with a standard padlock . 
Once through this door , there was another metal gate inside the entrance . 
The gate was also locked , but it was only about eight feet high , and did not reach the 16 foot high ceiling , making it possible for someone to climb over it . 
Beyond the metal gate is a single room approximately 32 square feet where the four 50 gallon drums containing the nuclear waste is stored against a northern wall . 
[ORG CREN-K Personnel  ] ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG DRC’S General Atomic Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG CGEA  ] ) , which is under the [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] , governs [ORG CREN-K  ] . 
[ORG CGEA  ] has two divisions: technical and administrative . 
The technical division is responsible for running the nuclear reactor , and it is divided into four departments: Technology , Science , [ORG Biology and Nuclear Medicine.  ] approximately 180 people work at [ORG CREN-K  ] , about 50 of whom are scientists , 60 of whom are technicians and 70 who serve as administrative officers . 
According to a facility technician , their salaries range from USD 40 to 150 per month - ( comment: a substantial vulnerability for the facility ) . 
Some senior officials include: -- Professor [PER Fortunat Lumu Badimbayi-Matu  ] , [ORG CGEA  ] Commissioner -- [PER Alphune Tshisonolo Tshisho  ] , [ORG Senior Nuclear Scientist  ] -- [PER Dieudonne Konbele  ] , Chief of the [ORG Technical Department  ] -- [PER Leonard Makontshi Woto  ] , [ORG Radiation Control Inspector  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While neither the [MISC Triga  ] I or [ORG Triga II  ] reactors function , [MISC CREN-K’s  ] nuclear scientists continue to work . 
They conduct agricultural research ( such as irradiating and mutating corn ) , study nuclear medicine , produce isotopes , analyze and identify neutron material , study radiography and teach [ORG University of Kinshasa  ] students physics and nuclear science. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Professor [PER Lumu  ] , who runs the facility , told [ORG Emboffs  ] he wants to restart the nuclear reactor . 
[PER Lumu  ] has been lobbying the international community to provide the necessary funds and technology to do this . 
[PER Lumu  ] said he plans to use the reactor to study x-ray detraction , radiology , agronomy , gamma irradiation , nuclear medicine , environmental science and radiation protection . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Because [MISC CREN-K’s  ] security is poor , it is relatively easy for someone to break into the nuclear reactor building or the nuclear waste storage building and steal rods or nuclear waste , with no greater tool than a lock cutter . 
It would also be feasible to pay a [ORG CREN-K  ] employee to steal nuclear material . 
It is imperative that the international community find a way to help better secure the facility , even if [ORG GDRC  ] remains unwilling to give up its fuel rods . 
Priority funding needs are new fencing , proper nuclear waste storage and disposal and security training .
