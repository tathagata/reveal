[LOC VATICAN  ] 25 B. [LOC VATICAN  ] 99 [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000106 001.2 OF 002 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Julieta Valls Noyes  ] , [ORG DCM  ] , [ORG EXEC  ] , State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: On October 13 , the [LOC Holy See  ] walked back from a prior written agreement to become an observer on the [ORG International Task Force  ] on [LOC Holocaust Education  ] , Remembrance , and Research ( [ORG ITF  ] ) . 
The decision may been taken by the Vatican’s relatively inexperienced new deputy foreign minister , and if so , would not be the first time he has complicated [LOC Vatican  ] foreign relations . 
But the [LOC Vatican  ] may also be pulling back due to concerns about [ORG ITF  ] pressure to declassify records from the [MISC WWII-era  ] pontificate of [PER Pope Pius XII  ] . 
Regardless of the cause , the [ORG ITF  ] will continue to pursue closer ties with the [LOC Holy See  ] in the months ahead . 
End Summary . 
High Hopes Dashed ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Three members of the [ORG International Task Force  ] on [LOC Holocaust Education  ] , Remembrance , and Research ( [ORG ITF  ] ) visited [LOC Rome  ] this week to finalize arrangements with the [LOC Holy See  ] to become an [ORG ITF  ] observer . 
However , over lunch on October 13 , the team members told the [MISC Austrian  ] Ambassador and [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] DCM’s that the plan had fallen apart completely that morning due to [LOC Vatican  ] back-pedaling . 
Team members -- [MISC Austrian  ] Ambassador [PER Ferdinand Trauttsmandorff  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Professor [PER Steve Katz  ] of the [PER Elie Wiesel Center  ] at [ORG Boston University  ] , and [PER Dina Porat  ] , the [MISC Israeli  ] academic advisor to the [ORG ITF  ] -- expressed considerable disappointment about the unexpected set-back. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) They were especially chagrined , [PER Trauttsmandorff  ] said , because the [LOC Vatican  ] had first offered more than the [ORG ITF  ] asked then rescinded its commitment . 
Specifically , the [ORG ITF  ] had suggested during a February visit to [LOC Rome  ] that the [LOC Vatican  ] enter into a “special arrangement” with the body . 
The February talks and follow up discussions went very well ( ref a ) . 
Subsequently , the then-Deputy Foreign Minister-equivalent at the [LOC Holy See  ] , Monsignor [PER Pietro Parolin  ] , wrote to the [ORG ITF  ] to indicate that the [LOC Vatican  ] wanted more than a “special arrangement” and was prepared to become an [ORG ITF  ] observer . 
( [PER Note: It’s  ] unclear whether [PER Parolin  ] suggested permanent observer or observer country status for the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
End Note ) New [ORG Vatican Team Disappoints  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On arrival in [LOC Rome  ] in October , though , the [ORG ITF  ] had to deal with a new team , as the highly-regarded [PER Parolin  ] had been promoted and sent as [PER Nuncio  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Parolin’s successor , [PER Msgr. Ettore Balestrero  ] , saw the [ORG ITF  ] group instead , at what the [ORG ITF  ] team expected to be the final meeting before signing an observer agreement . 
Surprising the [ORG ITF  ] , [PER Balestrero  ] also invited a representative from the [ORG Vatican Archives  ] , [PER Msgr. Chappin  ] , and the [ORG Holy See’s  ] chief negotiator for the long-delayed [MISC Vatican-Israel Fundamental Agreement  ] , Father [PER David Jaeger.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) All three men , [PER Trauttsmandorff  ] said , evinced considerable discomfort with the idea of [ORG ITF  ] observer status . 
[PER Balestrero  ] argued that the [LOC Vatican  ] needed to study the implications of the status further before committing , focusing on legalistic impediments that [PER Parolin  ] had already dismissed . 
[PER Jaeger  ] was hostile overall to the [ORG ITF  ] , [PER Porat  ] said . 
She fiercely criticized his inclusion , saying he had no role to play in a discussion of the ITF’s relationship with the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Porat  ] said that if [PER Jaeger  ] was so rigid about closer ties with the [ORG ITF  ] while [LOC Austria  ] held its rotating chair , no progress would be possible next year when [LOC Israel  ] chairs the body . 
[PER Trauttsmandorff  ] was less harsh than his colleague but allowed the [MISC Jaeger’s  ] involvement in the meeting was not constructive . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Connection  ] to the [ORG Papal Archives  ] ? --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The three [ORG ITF  ] visitors agreed that [PER Chappin  ] , who had previously been more open to dialogue with them , was very defensive at the October 13 meeting . 
He believed that the [ORG ITF  ] would ask the Archives to release ahead of schedule the documents from the papacy of [LOC Pius XII  ] , the [MISC World War II-era Pope  ] . 
( [PER Note:  ] The [LOC Vatican  ] releases the documents from each pontificate as a whole . 
End Note ) [ORG DCM  ] said that Father [PER Norbert Hofmann  ] , Secretary of the [ORG Vatican Commission for Religious Relations with Jews  ] , had told her the preceding week that the files from the entire papacy would be ready for declassification in about five years . 
[PER Katz  ] thought this was far too rosy a [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000106 002.2 OF 002 scenario given that only six-eight researchers are now reviewing the documents . 
Although this number is up from the one-two working on them a year ago , he thought it was insufficient to catalog and review the 16 million documents from the [LOC Pius XII  ] Papacy. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG ITF  ] members acknowledged their wish to gain access to the [LOC Pius XII  ] files as soon as possible . 
Nevertheless , they also accepted the Vatican’s arguments , shared by [ORG DCM  ] , that ordained clergy must review them first given the possibility that the files contain confessional documents from individual [MISC Catholics  ] . 
[PER Trauttsmandorff  ] insisted , however , that the [ORG ITF  ] sought a relationship with the [LOC Vatican  ] not only to get access to the [ORG Vatican Archives  ] , but also to work jointly with Catholic Church leaders in many countries on anti-racism and remembrance education . 
Now What ? --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Despite the disappointment , the [ORG ITF  ] members were determined to find a way to move ahead with the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
They concluded that they must now educate new Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Balestrero  ] about the [ORG ITF  ] and its role , just as they had done with his predecessor , [PER Parolin  ] . 
They would also reach out to friends in the [LOC Vatican  ] , such as Cardinal [PER Kasper  ] , to exert influence on their behalf . 
[LOC UK  ] [ORG DCM  ] indicated that [ORG HMG  ] would also express support for [ORG ITF  ] goals in discussions with [LOC Vatican  ] officials , as did [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG DCM  ] . 
The team members left discouraged but committed to keep their eyes on the long-term goal . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Unfortunately , the [ORG ITF  ] is only the latest group to run into problems caused by the recent change of personnel at the [MISC Vatican  ] Foreign Ministry - others , including this embassy ( ref B ) , have experienced similar problems on other issues . 
What remains to be seen is whether the ITF’s problems are the results of [MISC Msgr. Balestrero’s  ] growing pains or caused by deeper [LOC Vatican  ] uneasiness related to declassification of their Archives . 
The [ORG ITF  ] team did not believe the [LOC Vatican  ] was sending - via the decision to slow progress on the [ORG ITF  ] observer status -- a subtle message to [LOC Israel  ] about the need for progress in the [MISC Fundamental Agreement  ] talks . 
Time will tell .
