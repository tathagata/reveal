Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOA  ] has repeatedly suspended Ministerial-level contacts and has cut off some law enforcement contacts with the [ORG USG  ] in wake of the continuing furor ( ref a ) over [ORG DOJ  ] allegations that $800,000 intercepted August 4 by [MISC Argentine  ] officials was a [ORG BRV  ] cash contribution for [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] 's ( [ORG CFK  ] ) presidential campaign . 
The press reports that the [ORG GOA  ] is considering further responses , including the staging of a massive protest in front of the [MISC Embassy  ] which could involve radical and sometimes violent groups . 
The [MISC Argentine  ] Deputy Foreign Minister advised the Ambassador that he would be called in to the [ORG MFA  ] on December 18 . 
The Ambassador used a previously scheduled holiday reception for more than 100 journalists to roll out [MISC Washington-cleared  ] guidance reinforcing the message that the recent arrests in [LOC Miami  ] do not constitute a [LOC U.S.  ] conspiracy against the [ORG GOA  ] and that the [LOC United States  ] wants a good relationship with [LOC Argentina  ] . 
End Summary . 
[ORG GOA  ] Ire Against [ORG USG  ] Dominates Headlines --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Argentine  ] media on December 14 continued to give extensive coverage to the [ORG GOA  ] 's furious reaction ( ref a ) to [ORG FBI  ] allegations that $800,000 intercepted August 4 by [MISC Argentine  ] officials was a [ORG BRV  ] cash contribution for [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] 's ( [ORG CFK  ] ) presidential campaign . 
According to several sources , [ORG CFK  ] was very angry and upset , interpreting [LOC U.S.  ] arrests and charges as rejection of her overtures for better relations , an attempt to destabilize her new administration , and an effort to force her to distance [LOC Argentina  ] from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Following the lead of President [PER Kirchner  ] , her chief of staff and Justice Minister -- whose remarks ( ref a ) were broadcast and re-broadcast throughout the day and night -- a broad array of [ORG CFK  ] 's congressional , gubernatorial , and mayoral allies have accused the [ORG USG  ] of slandering [ORG CFK  ] and the [ORG GOA  ] in premeditated fashion in its effort to get [PER Chavez.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Opposition leader and presidential candidate [PER Elisa Carrio  ] , who finished the October 28 polling in second place , ridiculed the [ORG GOA  ] 's attempt to portray the arrests as part of an anti-CFK conspiracy . 
" President [PER Kirchner  ] does not seem to understand that the justice system in the [LOC U.S.  ] is autonomous . 
Thank [PER God  ] , ( [ORG CFK  ] ) cannot stop the [LOC U.S.  ] justice system . 
I am happy that the [MISC Americans  ] are investigating , because they're the best guarantee ( of an impartial inestigation ) . 
Not even the [LOC U.S.  ] president can intervene . 
" Leaders of other opposition parties questioned [ORG CFK  ] 's ties to [LOC Caracas  ] and criticized the [ORG GOA  ] for having let [MISC Antonini-Wilson  ] leave the country before completing its own investigation . 
[ORG GOA  ] Gives the [ORG USG  ] the [ORG Silent Treatment  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The press is further reporting that cabinet ministers have been instructed not to meet with the Ambassador , and that all [LOC U.S.  ] requests for high-level meetings with [ORG GOA  ] officials must be coordinated through the [ORG MFA  ] . 
We are also hearing from our law enforcement contacts that they are being instructed by the [ORG GOA  ] leadership to minimize contacts with us . 
Several bilateral meetings were cancelled under instruction on December 13 . 
The [ORG Airport Security Police  ] told [MISC Embassy  ] they had been instructed not to meet with [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
On the afternoon of December 14 , the [ORG GOA  ] ended more than 24 hours of shunning contacts with the [MISC Embassy  ] when Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Garcia Moritan  ] called the Ambassador . 
He advised the Ambassador that he should come to the [ORG MFA  ] to meet Foreign Minister [PER Taiana  ] on the evening of December 18 . 
We anticipate this will entail a protest and an explanation of the steps the [ORG GOA  ] plans to undertake . 
GOA-Organized Anti-USG Protest in the Offing ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) " [ORG La Nacion  ] , " the newspaper of record , and other media have reported that [ORG CFK  ] and her top advisers repeatedly huddled Wednesday night and Thursday morning on how to deal with " the worst moment of the bilateral relationship with the [LOC United States  ] " in the last four and a half years . 
According to " [ORG La Nacion  ] , " " the [PER Casa Rosada  ] ( presidential palace ) Thursday considered ordering mayors , social organizations , and activists ( " piqueteros " ) to organize a mass demonstration of protest in front of the [LOC U.S.  ] embassy . 
" The article quotes an unnamed official at [PER Casa Rosada  ] who said , " We have not ruled it out . 
There is a great deal of anger with the [LOC United States  ] , but it has not yet been decided . 
" ( [ORG Mission ARSO  ] sent a report on this development and [ORG Mission  ] counter-measures to [ORG DS Command Center  ] -- ref b . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The press reported remarks by [ORG WHA A/S Shannon  ] that the case was a law enforcement matter , not a political issue , and that it should not be allowed to affect bilateral relations . 
The press also quoted [ORG Department spokesman McCormack  ] on the strength of the bilateral relationship and the independence of federal prosecutors , as well as similar statements by the [MISC Embassy  ] 's spokesperson . 
The [ORG Empire Strikes Back: Mission PD Response  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador used a previously scheduled holiday reception for more than 100 print , radio , and TV journalists December 14 to roll out [MISC Washington-cleared  ] guidance on the case . 
Several of the radio journalists used their cell phones to transmit the Ambassador 's words on the air through their stations , and many rushed out after the Ambassador concluded to call in stories . 
Several stories reporting on the Ambassador 's reception remarks have already hit the wires . 
We expect that the Ambassador 's remarks will dominate [MISC Argentine  ] headlines [MISC Saturday.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) We also gave the journalists recent quotes by Assistant Secretary [ORG Shannon  ] , Secretary [PER Chao  ] , [PER Dana Perino  ] , and the Ambassador on the [MISC U.S.-Argentine  ] relationship . 
We are posting the Ambassador 's remarks on the [ORG Mission  ] 's web page . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) What began as a black day for the [LOC U.S.  ] image in [LOC Argentina  ] -- with headlines filled with attacks by [ORG CFK  ] and others about our supposedly dark intentions -- is ending on a more hopeful note , as the quick work by State , Justice , and the [ORG FBI  ] to review and clear our draft guidance on the issue enabled us to get our story out to a captive group of [MISC Argentine  ] journalists . 
As the first week of the [ORG CFK  ] administration draws to a close , we have given pragmatists within the [ORG GOA  ] material to work with in their effort to convince [ORG CFK  ] to climb back from the precipice and re-engage with the [ORG USG  ] as she begins the second week of her presidential term . 
We will see their reaction and response in the days ahead .
