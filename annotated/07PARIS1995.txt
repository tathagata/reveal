[LOC PARIS  ] 1844 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 1871 Classified By: CDA [PER Thomas J. White  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B & D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The meeting between the President and [MISC French  ] President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] in [ORG Heiligendamm June  ] 6 will be their first official encounter since then-Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] met briefly with the President on September 12 , 2006 . 
The two presidents will meet on the same day that Defense Secretary Gates and new [MISC French  ] Defense Minister [PER Herve Morin  ] SIPDIS commemorate D-Day on the beaches of [LOC Normandy  ] . 
[LOC France  ] 's new President -- who has promised [LOC France  ] 's citizens that he will say what he will do and do what he has said -- has declared that improving [LOC France  ] 's relationship with the [LOC United States  ] is one of his top priorities . 
We should take him at his word and seek to exploit this opening to reinvigorate our strategic relationship with [LOC France  ] , since close cooperation with [LOC France  ] -- bilaterally , within [ORG NATO  ] , at the [ORG UNSC  ] , and through the [ORG EU  ] -- is a key force multiplier. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) That said , we will need to take into account the fact that [PER Sarkozy  ] was elected President primarily with a mandate for domestic reform . 
He will devote his first weeks and months in office to delivering on his promises and implementing that mandate . 
Even if [PER Sarkozy  ] handily wins the June legislative elections , as currently expected , he will face vigorous opposition from those with entrenched interests , including unions and the coalition of students and their parents who fear a loss of [LOC France  ] 's vaunted social protections . 
In the foreign policy arena , as was made clear in his May 16 meeting with [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] on the same day he assumed office , [PER Sarkozy  ] will focus in the short term on the run-up to the June 21-22 [ORG EU Council  ] meeting as a means of finally re-imparting institutional momentum following the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] rejection of the [ORG EU  ] constitutional treaty. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The President will want to welcome [PER Sarkozy  ] 's election and the possibilities it represents for reforming and re-energizing [LOC France  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , while acknowledging the challenges that [PER Sarkozy  ] faces in the years ahead . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] greatly enjoys political strategizing ( the basis of his close relationship with [ORG UK PM Blair  ] ) , and can be expected to talk at some length about his strategy of moving toward the center , winning the upcoming legislative elections , and pushing through an ambitious reform program in his first months of office. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The President should also welcome [PER Sarkozy  ] 's commitment to a [MISC U.S.-French  ] relationship based on mutual confidence and candor , and will want to address [PER Sarkozy  ] 's desire for frequent contact on the full range of issues . 
We should suggest that [ORG NSA Hadley  ] would hope to have the same kind of close relationship with [PER Sarkozy  ] 's diplomatic advisor , [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] , and seek [PER Sarkozy  ] 's agreement that they be mandated to begin a quiet dialogue on how we might reinvigorate the [MISC U.S.-French  ] strategic relationship , including through a larger and more positive [MISC French  ] leadership role within [ORG NATO  ] . 
The President can assure [PER Sarkozy  ] that this would not be at the expense of the [ORG EU  ] -- we do not see this as zero-sum -- but that we are striving for a win-win outcome for both organizations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) We believe it is essential for the President to raise two issues in this initial meeting , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC France  ] has been sending mixed signals . 
[ORG MFA Political Director Araud  ] has counseled us to try early on to move [PER Sarkozy  ] away from [ORG Chirac  ] 's pessimistic view of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and lay the basis for a more activist , multifaceted [MISC French  ] effort there . 
Unfortunately , in responding to the [ORG Taliban  ] hostage-taking of a [MISC French  ] [ORG NGO  ] worker , [PER Sarkozy  ] suggested that a long-term [MISC French  ] presence would not be " decisive , " implying that he would consider reducing [LOC France  ] 's commitments . 
Although we have since been assured by [PER Levitte  ] that [MISC French  ] policy has not changed , we believe it is essential to obtain that commitment from [PER Sarkozy  ] himself . 
[LOC NATO/ISAF  ] requires [LOC France  ] 's continuing engagement ; as with [LOC Bosnia  ] or [LOC Kosovo  ] , when it comes to the Alliance it must remain " in together and out together . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] recognizes that an [MISC American  ] defeat is also a defeat for [LOC Europe  ] , and he told the President that he would " help get the [LOC U.S.  ] out of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" We take for granted that , at a minimum , this means that the needling [LOC PARIS  ] 00001995 002 OF 002 rhetoric of the past will be dropped , including repeated calls to offer a " horizon " for an eventual troop withdrawal . 
Beyond that , it is extremely unlikely that [LOC France  ] would put troops on the ground , but the President should seek a new level of engagement that could be demonstrated , for example , by visibly working with [MISC Arab  ] governments in support of a political settlement in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC France  ] could also raise the level of its representation at , and support for , the regional conferences with [LOC Iraq  ] 's neighbors now underway. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is likely to have two priority issues of his own to raise , climate change and [ORG Darfur  ] . 
On the first , [PER Sarkozy  ] signaled during his election victory speech that climate change was his top priority , and he called on the [LOC U.S.  ] to " take the lead " in the fight against global warming . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has stopped short of calling on the [LOC U.S.  ] to join [LOC Kyoto  ] , but he publicly advocates the idea of a carbon tax on imports from non-Kyoto signatories as a means of defending [LOC Europe  ] 's CO2 emissions trading system ( [ORG ETS  ] ) . 
The President should express our interest in enhancing collaboration on climate change with [LOC France  ] , with a view to greater cooperation on a positive science and technology agenda. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Darfur  ] is likely to be a high-profile issue for [PER Sarkozy  ] and his Foreign Minister , former [ORG UN Kosovo Czar  ] , [ORG NGO  ] ( Doctors Without Borders ) activist , and human rights interventionist [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] , which would permit the [PER Sarkozy  ] government to put more of a human rights stamp on its foreign policy . 
( [PER Sarkozy  ] has himself called for greater human rights emphasis in [MISC French  ] foreign policy: he has been sharply critical of [LOC Russia  ] on [LOC Chechnya  ] , and opposes the lifting of the [ORG EU  ] arms embargo on [LOC China  ] , on human rights grounds . 
) The President should assure [PER Sarkozy  ] of our desire to work closely with [ORG Sarkozy Darfur  ] , with the aim of reproducing the kind of success we have had together on [LOC Lebanon.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As time permits , we would recommend that the President touch on the need to maintain continuity on [MISC U.S.-French  ] cooperation on [LOC Lebanon/Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , including the need to ratchet up sanctions and reinforce them outside the [ORG UN  ] framework if necessary . 
The President should also stress the importance of maintaining [MISC Western  ] unity on [LOC Kosovo  ] in the face of [MISC Russian  ] opposition . 
This might offer a chance for a brief exchange on [LOC Russia  ] more generally , including on missile defense , and lead to a brief assessment by [PER Sarkozy  ] 's assessment of [LOC EU-Russia  ] relations . 
( [PER Sarkozy  ] has a much more critical view of [LOC Russia  ] than did [ORG Chirac  ] . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Finally , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's opposition to [MISC Turkish  ] entry into the [ORG EU  ] is public and likely unshakeable: it is one of his few defining foreign policy issues . 
He has heard our strategic rationale for bringing [LOC Turkey  ] into the [ORG EU  ] , but has made clear that whatever the ramifications of keeping [LOC Turkey  ] out , he opposes bringing 70 million [MISC Muslims  ] into [LOC Europe  ] , further diluting its identity and exacerbating [LOC France  ] 's own sensitive immigration issue ( although he puts his argument in terms of " [LOC Turkey  ] is in [PER Asia Minor  ] , not [LOC Europe  ] . 
" ) The President , while noting that this is an issue that only the [ORG EU  ] can decide , should nonetheless seek to persuade [PER Sarkozy  ] to avoid any early or dramatic closing of the door ; not taking a decision at this time would allow the accession negotiations so indispensable to [LOC Turkey  ] 's own internal reforms to proceed uninterrupted .
