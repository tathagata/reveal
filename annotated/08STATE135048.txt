( U ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph 4. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [MISC BACKGROUND:  ] The [LOC U.S.  ] has obtained information indicating that a [MISC Syrian  ] institution with connections to the country’s chemical and biological weapons programs is attempting to acquire [LOC Australia  ] Group-controlled glass-lined reactors , heat exchangers and pumps from the [MISC Indian  ] firms [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Both firms are believed to have received visits from the [LOC Syria  ] institution in the past 3 months and may be close to concluding their respective deals. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) BACKGROUND CONT’D: We would like to alert the [ORG GOI  ] to this information . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has a general obligation as a [ORG Chemical Weapons Convention State Party  ] to never , under any circumstances , assist anyone in the development of chemical weapons . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] also has publicly stated its belief that [LOC India  ] is a strong partner on nonproliferation issues . 
We therefore seek the GOI’s assistance in investigating this activity and talking all steps necessary to prevent [MISC Indian  ] entities from providing CBW equipment to [LOC Syria  ] . 
We also want to remind the [ORG GOI  ] that the [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] Nonproliferation Act requires us to report to [ORG Congress  ] transfers of goods , services and technology on multilateral control lists , such as the [ORG Australia Group  ] , to [LOC Syria  ] . 
Sanctions may be imposed against individuals and entities identified in such reports. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ACTION REQUEST: Request Post deliver the points in paragraph 6 to appropriate host government officials and report a response . 
The points may be left as a nonpaper. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

( U ) Begin talking points/nonpaper: ( [ORG SECRET//REL INDIA  ] ) -- In the spirit of our cooperation in preventing proliferation we would like to raise a matter of chemical weapons ( CW ) proliferation concern and request the [MISC Indian  ] government’s assistance in investigating this activity . 
-- We have information that the [MISC Indian  ] company [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] may be planning to sell glass components and related chemical processing equipment to an end-user in [LOC Syria  ] . 
-- In addition , we have information that the [MISC Indian  ] company [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] may be planning to sell heat exchangers , immersion heaters , pumps , and glass equipment to the same end-user in [LOC Syria  ] . 
-- Further , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and probably [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed to support a visit in mid-September 2008 by representatives of a [MISC Syrian  ] institution with connections to Syria’schemical and biological weapons programs , to finalize contracts for glass-related equipment . 
-- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is located in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [LOC India  ] . 
-- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is located in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [LOC India  ] . 
-- While they have legitimate commercial uses , glass or glass-lined chemical reactor vessels , heat exchangers and pumps can be used in the production of CW agents and therefore are controlled by the [ORG Australia Group  ] ( [ORG AG  ] ) . 
-- We are concerned that the equipment in question is intended for , or could be diverted to , [MISC Syria’s  ] CW program . 
-- The [MISC Syrian  ] [ORG Research Council  ] ( [ORG SSRC  ] ) is a key entity behind [MISC Syria’s  ] chemical warfare program and may be behind [MISC Syria’s  ] biological warfare program as well . 
-- In light of its CW and other programs of proliferation concern , support to terrorist organizations , and efforts to destabilize other countries in the region , we believe [LOC Syria  ] is an unreliable destination for dual-use exports , and [MISC Syrian  ] end-user statements or other assurances are neither credible nor trustworthy . 
-- In addition , the [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , and [LOC Syria  ] Nonproliferation Act ( [ORG INKSNA  ] ) requires us to provide periodic reports to the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] identifying persons ( including individuals and entities ) who have transferred to , or acquired from , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] or [LOC Syria  ] , items that are on multilateral export control lists , such as glass or glass-lined reactor vessels , or that could make a material contribution to developing a weapon of mass destruction or missile system . 
-- Under [ORG INKSNA  ] , sanctions also may be imposed against persons identified in such reports . 
-- We therefore request that the [MISC Indian  ] government take all steps necessary to investigate this matter and prevent [LOC Syria  ] from acquiring dual-use items , such as glass or glass-lined reactor vessels , heat exchangers , and pumps that could be used in its CW programs . 
-- We look forward to the [MISC Indian  ] government sharing with us the results of its investigation into this matter .
