( [LOC S  ] ) In response to media reports surrounding the visit of [MISC Iranian  ] Defense Minister [PER Najar  ] to [LOC Moscow  ] February 16-18 that [LOC Russia  ] would move ahead with the delivery of the [MISC S-300  ] air defense missile system to [LOC Iran  ] , Ambassador expressed strong concern to DFM Ryabkov February 17 ( ref A ) . 
Ryabkov replied that [LOC Moscow  ] had " gotten the message . 
" This followed Ambassador 's demarches on the issue the previous week to Presidential Foreign [ORG Policy Advisor Prikhodko  ] and [ORG PM FP Advisor Ushakov  ] , as well as U/S Burns' and [ORG NSC Senior  ] Director [PER McFaul  ] 's expressions of strong concern regarding the possible completion of the delivery with FM [PER Lavrov  ] ( ref B ) , Prikhodko and [PER Ushakov.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Late February 17 , news daily [ORG Kommersant  ] reported that [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] spokesman [PER Vyacheslav Davidenko  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] were " unlikely to agree on deliveries of the [MISC S-300  ] air defense missile system " during [PER Najar  ] 's visit . 
[PER Davidenko  ] reportedly said that " nothing has changed as to the deliveries of [MISC S-300  ] to [LOC Tehran  ] " and that " things were unlikely to change " after [PER Naijar  ] 's visit . 
Press reports February 18 followed up , saying that [LOC Russia  ] had " deferred " its plan to sell [MISC S-300  ] 's to [LOC Iran  ] " in an effort to improve [LOC Moscow  ] 's relations with the new [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
" They cited [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] General Director [PER Isaikin  ] 's comment that " if the president and government of the [LOC Russian Federation  ] make a decision , [ORG Rosoboronexport  ] must implement it . 
" [PER Isaikin  ] said [LOC Russia  ] had not delivered the system to [LOC Iran  ] , but was ready to do so " if ordered . 
" Daily [ORG Izvestiya  ] also reported that DFM Ryabkov said that [LOC Russia  ] " saw to it that its military cooperation is transparent and in keeping with international law . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Israeli  ] DCM [PER Yuval Fuchs  ] told us February 17 that FM [PER Lavrov  ] was in [LOC Israel  ] over the weekend and assured the [ORG GOI  ] that [LOC Russia  ] was not supplying any [MISC S-300  ] missiles to any countries in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
According to [PER Fuchs  ] , [PER Lavrov  ] failed to give any heads up to the [ORG GOI  ] about [PER Najar  ] 's visit this week . 
[PER Fuchs  ] added that [ORG Rosatom  ] head [PER Sergey Kiriyenko  ] and Deputy FM [PER Aleksey Borodavkin  ] will make separate trips to [LOC Iran  ] later this month . 
[PER Kiriyenko  ] will travel to discuss [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear facility at [LOC Bushehr  ] , while [PER Borodavkin  ] is going for consultations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[MISC Russian  ] officials appear to have stepped back , at least temporarily , from announcing a delivery of the [MISC S-300  ] 's , but pressure will remain within the military and security services to move forward as much for financial reasons as for political or foreign policy considerations . 
The prospect of more constructive [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] relations may have tempered the [ORG GOR  ] response , but we will continue to be told that [LOC Russia  ] retains its " right " to proceed with an arms sale that does not violate national or international regimes . 
For better or for worse , the delivery of [MISC S-300  ] 's have become a barometer of our bilateral relations .
