( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Two recent arms trafficking conferences -- one in September focused on the northern border ( reftel ) and a subsequent one in [LOC Tapachula  ] , looking at the southern border -- highlighted lax border controls and suggested ways to improve law enforcement efforts to stem the tide of illegal guns . 
This cable reports on the [LOC Tapachula  ] discussion , and off-site trips to three different border locations , which offered dramatic evidence of the porous southern border and serious resource shortfalls , and helped focus attention on ways to help [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Guatemala  ] and [LOC Belize  ] address shared border security challenges . 
End Summary . 
Follow Up on the [ORG Southern Border  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Many of the [ORG GOM  ] and [ORG USG  ] law enforcement officials who participated in the [LOC Tapachula  ] conference in October had also attended the earlier [ORG Northern Border Conference  ] in [LOC Phoenix  ] . 
This time , however , [LOC Belize  ] 's [ORG National Police  ] and representatives from [LOC Guatemala  ] 's Attorney General 's office also participated , adding a new wrinkle to the discussion by presenting an overview of arms trafficking laws in their countries and suggesting ways in which they could improve coordination with [LOC Mexico  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] with regards to illegal arms trafficking . 
The [ORG Ground Truth: Laws Not Enough  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Each country highlighted internal controls that regulate the sale , distribution , and transport of weapons and ammunition , drawing attention to sanctions against the unlawful transport of weapons across any national boundary . 
Unfortunately , our visit to three border crossings between [LOC Guatemala  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] in [LOC Chiapas  ] revealed neither country presently works seriously to enforce these laws. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the first border crossing in [LOC Talisman  ] , [LOC Chiapas  ] , the conference participants witnessed almost as many individuals crossing the border illegally as legally . 
Immigration officials conjectured that individuals crossing illegally under the bridge were either visiting family members on the other side of border or engaging in informal commerce . 
Although the delegation did not have an opportunity to talk with any of the individuals crossing under the bridge at the border , it appeared the majority were carrying what appeared to be personal belongings rather than items of commerce. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The border officials made every attempt to illustrate a secure border crossing , but their explanations highlighted serious procedural inconsistencies that undermine effective controls . 
While border officials inspect 100 percent of the individuals and cars crossing the bridge legally , the data collected is stored in a local database that is not connected to federal or international criminal databases . 
Border officials are also hampered by their lack of access to national registries that would allow them to determine if the individuals crossing are on any criminal or terrorist watchlists . 
[MISC Mexican  ] law allows individuals to cross the border with an " original " identification document but does not prescribe what constitutes an " original " document . 
As long as the individual agrees to confine one 's visit to the state of [LOC Chiapas  ] [LOC MEXICO  ] 00000077 002 OF 003 and return to [LOC Guatemala  ] after an undefined period of time , one is granted admission to the country . 
Limited resources also undermine the effort: while there are 30,000 [LOC U.S.  ] CBP officers on the 1,926 mile Mexican/U.S. border , only 125 [MISC Mexican  ] immigration officials monitor the 577 mile border with [LOC Guatemala  ] . 
[MISC Mexican  ] immigration officials repeatedly confirmed that they do not have the manpower or resources to direct efforts effectively along the southern border. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The tour continued to the [LOC Ciudad Hidalgo  ] station on the [MISC Pan American  ] highway , the border crossing with highest number of legal crossings in [LOC Chiapas  ] . 
Border officials estimated that on a daily basis 95% of all exports , 350-400 shipments ; and 26% of all imports , flow through these border crossings to and from [LOC Central America  ] . 
Additionally , 80-100 carloads of visitors pass through the border on a daily basis . 
While officials displayed an impressive array of non-intrusive inspection equipment , e.g. , hand-held spectrometers for the identification of drugs and explosives and gamma-ray inspection equipment for large containers , these devices are not incorporated effectively into border control protocols . 
Border officials were inconsistent in using their inspection equipment to check the cabs of trucks and there is no revealed coordinated approach between [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Guatemala  ] to share information that would reduce crossing times and avoid duplicative inspections , as , for example , is being done at certain places in the [MISC Mexican-U.S.  ] border. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The final border crossing only served to re-inforce the concerns that emerged from the first two sites the group visited . 
One of the most memorable images of the day was the steady flow of rafts transporting people and goods across the river illegally within sight of the legal border crossing . 
Family Feuds Prevent Internal Coordination --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The last part of the conference consisted of open and frank panel discussions . 
The most interesting discussion focused on information and intelligence sharing among [MISC Mexican  ] agencies , including the [ORG Secretariat of National Defense  ] ( [ORG SEDENA  ] ) , the [ORG Marine Secretariat  ] ( [ORG SEMAR  ] ) , the Office of the Attorney General ( [ORG PGR  ] ) , and the [ORG Center for Investigation and National Security  ] ( [ORG CISEN  ] ) . 
The discussion started with many self-congratulatory comments from panel members on how well their respective organizations collect and share information . 
The lack of coordination between federal and state officials became apparent when a representative from the [ORG Chiapas State Attorney General 's Office  ] complained that his state does not receive any information from the federal authorities and has no input or visibility in the federal process . 
While the state representative acknowledged a common perception of corruption at the state level , he argued it was counterproductive and illogical to exclude them from the process . 
Other participants recognized an acceptable process for intelligence collection , but complained about inadequate dissemination of actionable information and insufficient formal mechanisms for sharing collected information . 
Conclusions and Follow Up Actions --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The conference generated a list of eight conclusions , including few measurable actions . 
Several of the conclusions [LOC MEXICO  ] 00000077 003 OF 003 focused on the need to explore mechanisms for better information-sharing with international partners or internally . 
There was consensus on the need to regionalize arms-trafficking efforts , specifically by including [LOC Guatemala  ] in future [PER GC Armas  ] meetings in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[MISC Guatemalan  ] representation pledged to review current procedures and incorporate practices that will improve interagency coordination and information . 
[LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC Guatemala  ] agreed to work on practical measures to facilitate the flow of information between the two countries on the issue of arms trafficking . 
[LOC Belize  ] also suggested a formal dialogue with [LOC Mexico  ] on increasing the number of formal border crossings between the two countries , as a way to improve border controls . 
Comment -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) This conference highlighted weak controls on [LOC Mexico  ] 's southern border that are contributing to problems with illegal migration and guns/drugs smuggling . 
Much more needs to be done to improve secure information sharing among federal agencies and between Federal and State officials in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
Better cooperation among [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Guatemala  ] , and [LOC Belize  ] could also help coordinate current efforts by each state and ensure that existing laws are enforced . 
The conference represented a small first step in that direction , a follow-up meeting in February 2010 will provide another opportunity to strengthen joint efforts .
