Solomont  ] , for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: In the Ambassador 's February 4 courtesy call , [ORG Economy  ] and Finance Minister and Second Vice President [PER Elena Salgado  ] described [LOC Spain  ] , s economic challenges and said the [ORG GOS  ] would seek to gain public support for changes to increase flexibility . 
The Ambassador emphasized the importance of steps to improve the business climate , including renegotiating our double taxation treaty and the government 's proposed legislative changes to fight internet piracy . 
[PER Salgado  ] thought the bill containing the internet piracy measures could be approved by the [ORG Congress  ] before August ( though an opposition party legislator we spoke to the next day was less optimistic ) . 
The Ambassador also explained how the upcoming [LOC U.S.-Spain Forum  ] in [LOC Washington  ] could provide an opportunity to address [PER Salgado  ] 's aim of increasing [LOC Spain  ] , s profile in the [LOC U.S.  ] End Summary . 
Economic Difficulties --------------------- 2 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Salgado  ] said the current &risk fuss8 in international markets ( reftel ) was hurting [LOC Spain  ] a bit . 
She said [LOC Spain  ] , s public sector debt as a percentage of GDP was just over half that of [LOC Greece  ] and 10 percentage points below the [ORG EU  ] average . 
The government had run surpluses in the years before the start of the crisis . 
Nonetheless , she acknowledged the importance of the budget deficit . 
Unemployment payments alone made up almost 3.5% of GDP and would decline only gradually over the new few years . 
The [ORG GOS  ] had used money during the boom years to build lots of infrastructure , so it could cut investment over the next few years . 
It would continue funding research and development , in which [LOC Spain  ] was still below the [ORG EU  ] average . 
Over the medium term , the country 's production model would have to change , as construction could not employ as many people as it had when [LOC Spain  ] was building twice as many homes as it needed . 
The [ORG GOS  ] was seeking to increase tourism by attracting more tourists to non-beach areas and throughout the year . 
She mentioned health care ( especially elder care ) , telecoms , the auto industry , agriculture , and biotechnology as other sectors in which [LOC Spain  ] had opportunities . 
3 . 
( C ) To address the economy , s problems , the [ORG GOS  ] would try to increase flexibility and had to convince society ) - including unions , citizens , industry , and the public sector -- to accept changes . 
She said it was a myth that [LOC Spain  ] , s economy was inflexible , noting that a high percentage ( [ORG Note:  ] about a third ) of the economy , s jobs were temporary . 
However , the rapid turnover meant that there was no incentive to train this large segment of the labor force , while the people with permanent jobs were very protected . 
Rather than seeking to increase the ease of firing , it would be good to increase flexibility within companies to take steps like reducing hours or salaries instead of firing workers . 
This had been accomplished within the auto industry , and [LOC Spain  ] had attracted production of a new model as a result , but it was difficult to do in many cases because of industry-wide bargaining . 
Strengthening Business Ties --------------------------- 4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador explained the priority he placed on strengthening business ties , including increasing investment in both directions , helping [LOC U.S.  ] companies increase exports to [LOC Spain  ] , and encouraging [LOC Spain  ] to improve the business climate in which [LOC U.S.  ] companies operate . 
He said that updating the double taxation treaty was important to companies from both countries and offered any assistance he could provide . 
He noted that [MISC Spanish  ] companies had been able to invest in the [LOC U.S.  ] successfully despite their concerns over Buy [MISC American  ] requirements , and he described his advocacy on behalf of two [LOC U.S.  ] companies , proposed solar thermal electricity investments in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The Minister acknowledged the importance of a level playing field . 
She said the [ORG GOS  ] was seeking to reduce its bureaucracy and expected to see progress in the next three months . 
She promised to keep the Ambassador informed . 
[ORG IPR/Sustainable Economy Law  ] --------------------------- [ORG MADRID  ] 00000155 002.2 OF 002 5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In response to the Ambassador 's emphasis of the importance of the internet piracy measures in the government 's proposed [ORG Sustainable Economy Law  ] ( [ORG LES  ] ) , Minister [PER Salgado  ] said the thrust of the government 's proposal had not been disturbed by the recent change ( [ORG Note:  ] to require judicial authorization before internet sites could be blocked ; this provision was added after the originally announced proposal sparked opposition ) . 
She did not think the proposal would be changed in the [ORG Congress  ] , and she thought the law could be approved before the August vacation . 
( Comment: An legislator from the main opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) who met with visiting [MISC A/USTR  ] [ORG Wilson  ] the following day was less optimistic . 
He predicted that the internet piracy language could be acceptable to his party with some amendment , but he said the [ORG LES  ] as a whole would face significant [ORG PP  ] opposition , rendering it less likely that it could be approved quickly . 
Septel on [MISC A/USTR  ] [ORG Wilson  ] 's meetings will provide more information on the status of the proposed legislation . 
End Comment . 
) [LOC U.S.-Spain Forum  ] ---------------- 6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Minister [PER Salgado  ] welcomed the Ambassador 's interest in strengthening business ties and cited a need to increase knowledge of [LOC Spain  ] in the [LOC U.S.  ] The Ambassador noted that one opportunity to do this was the annual [LOC U.S.-Spain Forum  ] , to be held in [LOC Washington  ] in July . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] and [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] Chairman [PER Sen. Menendez  ] were seeking to increase the level of participation by [LOC U.S.  ] businesses and upgrade USG participation . 
For [MISC Spaniards  ] , the event would offer a platform for telling [LOC Spain  ] , s story .
