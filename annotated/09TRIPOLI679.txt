REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG Charge  ] convened an Emergency Action Committee ( [ORG EAC  ] ) on August 20 , 2009 at 0915 hours to review tripwires and emergency planning procedures in light of the expected announcement of the release and return to [LOC Libya  ] of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Bassett Al-Megrahi  ] . 
The [ORG Charge  ] , Acting [MISC DCM/CONS  ] , [ORG GRPO  ] , [ORG CLO  ] , [ORG MGT  ] , [ORG DAO  ] , [ORG PAO  ] , [ORG FCS  ] , [ORG RSO  ] and [ORG POL/ECON  ] attended the meeting . 
The [ORG EAC  ] reviewed the tripwires reported reftel , and agreed that they were still valid . 
While the [ORG EAC  ] agreed that one tripwire had been crossed ( public USG opposition to [PER Megrahi  ] 's release ) , [PER Megrahi  ] 's expected return to [LOC Libya  ] significantly lowered the security ramifications of the public USG opposition . 
However , the [ORG EAC  ] expressed concern about the strong , negative reaction we are hearing from some [MISC Libyan  ] Government officials about recent public USG statements regarding [PER Megrahi  ] 's release . 
Although the [ORG Embassy  ] has not detected any anti-American tone in local press coverage of the pending return , the [ORG EAC  ] agreed that there is a possibility that [PER Megrahi  ] 's return could spark some anti-American protests if/if the [MISC Libyan  ] Government or people take umbrage at USG public statements . 
In order to ensure [ORG Embassy  ] staff 's safety , the [ORG EAC  ] decided to release staff at 2:00 pm today . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] did not link the early release to this issue , noting instead that this was being done in recognition of the [ORG Embassy  ] staff 's work on two recent high-level delegations and to allow the staff time to begin [MISC Ramadan  ] preparations . 
Separately , the [ORG EAC  ] agreed to draft a warden notice ( for release after the public announcement ) warning [MISC American  ] citizens to be vigilant and avoid large crowds that could develop for a planned August 20 youth rally in [LOC Tripoli  ] and in response to [PER Megrahi  ] 's return . 
The [ORG EAC  ] agreed to monitor events tonight and reconvene if needed on August 21. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>Â¶</a>2 .
