While encouraged by the latest attention to achieving peace in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he believes action and sincerity , not talk and good intentions , are required to make progress . 
He also wants negotiations among all involved parties , including armed [ORG Taliban  ] and those who are active within the constitutional order , and that obstacles such as the [ORG UN  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] “blacklists” must be removed before these talks can start . 
Zaeef’s viewpoint could reflect his annoyance at the pace of reconciliation talks that may have left him on the sidelines .

( [ORG S  ] ) In a recent meeting on February 8 with former [ORG Taliban  ] Ambassador to [LOC Pakistan  ] [PER Abdul Salam Zaeef  ] at his modest residence in Kabul’s Pasthun-dominant Khush-Haal neighborhood , [PER Zaeef  ] told us he was convinced that there is no longer any other option than peace for [MISC Afghanistan:  ] peace is “a requirement” for [MISC Afghans  ] , [MISC Americans  ] , and the international community at large . 
However , while encouraged by the latest attention to political settlement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , “talk and good intentions are not enough ; rather , action , strategy , and sincerity are required to make progress.” In particular , [PER Zaeef  ] expressed skepticism about Karzai’s true intentions , because “Karzai is deceiving all sides. “When he sits with me , he tells me he wants the foreign troops to leave , then he tells you he wants them to stay forever , and he tells yet a third story to [MISC Islamic  ] leaders of other countries , ” [PER Zaeef  ] said . 
Karzai’s only clear objective is to remain in power ; he thinks the presence of foreign troops will help him do so , opined [PER Zaeef.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zaeef  ] posited that the peace process must first start with negotiations among all involved parties , including armed and disarmed [ORG Taliban  ] , and that “hurdles” must be removed before entering these talks ; only after successful negotiations can reintegration and reconciliation occur , he asserted . 
To our query regarding which hindrances must be removed , he listed ending the Taliban’s isolation by removing them from the [ORG UN  ] ( 1267 ) and [LOC U.S.  ] blacklists ( [PER Zaeef  ] continues on the 1267 list ) and the cessation of foreign hostilities against the group during the negotiations. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [MISC Taliban Saved Afghanistan  ] from Disintegration - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While most [MISC Afghans  ] want an end to hostilities , [PER Zaeef  ] said , warlords do not and they were the reason the [ORG Taliban  ] seized control of the country to begin with . 
Without [ORG Taliban  ] intervention and its imposition of a strong dictatorship , [LOC Afghanistan  ] would have been divided between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Zaeef  ] said when the [ORG Taliban  ] seized power , their first priority was to instill order and governance by ruling with a strict hand . 
They had also tried to establish a central government to defend against “challenges from the region , ” and had attempted to “clear the country of warlords” who had ruled pieces of the country and had committed horrible human rights abuses. “Unfortunately , we were unable to even achieve our first goal , ” he lamented . 
[PER Zaeef  ] insisted that if the [ORG Taliban  ] had remained in power , it would have gradually become more moderate. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [MISC Taliban Are Not Misogynists  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Like [PER Muttawakil  ] ( Ref . 
A ) , [PER Zaeef  ] asserted that the [ORG Taliban  ] were not misogynists who opposed women’s education and the right to work , as long as their actions did not violate [MISC Islam  ] . 
While acknowledging the [ORG Taliban  ] made some mistakes , he countered that saving [LOC Afghanistan  ] from disintegration far outweighed the Taliban’s negative actions . 
Moreover , now that conditions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] had changed , he believed if peace were made with the [ORG Taliban  ] , the “old strict rules” would not return . 
He asserted that [PER Mullah Omar’s  ] intention was not to topple the [MISC Afghan  ] government ; rather he sought reforms to the [MISC Constitution  ] and other laws so they could be in accordance with [MISC Islam  ] . 
( Comment: While some “ex-Taliban” assert that the [ORG Taliban  ] seek only minor - unspecified - Constitutional revisions , others insist that [LOC KABUL  ] 00000503 002.2 OF 002 the changes must be so far-reaching , such as reversing equal protections for women and elevating [ORG Sharia  ] law above other constitutional provisions , that it amounts to a full revision .

( [ORG S  ] ) Responding to our reference to extreme versus moderate [ORG Taliban  ] elements , [PER Zaeef  ] suggested that we should instead differentiate the [ORG Taliban  ] by whether they choose force or peace to achieve their objectives . 
Ultimately , however , the armed [ORG Taliban  ] obey the orders of their political leaders ; therefore , only a political solution will work , reasoned [PER Zaeef  ] . 
Furthermore , while [MISC Americans  ] have attempted to make the war an international cause , it is “clearly [MISC America’s  ] war” and the [MISC Iranians  ] , [MISC Russians  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] , and [MISC Pakistanis  ] , and even the [MISC British  ] , are content for various reasons to see you mired in a quagmire here , he said . 
Foreigners have never won a military victory in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Zaeef  ] warned. - - - - Comment - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zaeef  ] has been relatively quiet during the government’s formulation of the reintegration/reconciliation policy unveiled in [LOC London  ] , although he is certainly one of Karzai’s informal advisors in this regard and appears to maintain contact with [ORG Taliban  ] leadership . 
He appeared annoyed at not being more engaged in the policy development and also may be waiting less patiently for his delisting in view of the January 25 breakthrough which delisted five other [PER Afghans.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a February 5 [ORG Inter Press Service  ] ( IPS ) article by [PER Gareth Porter  ] , titled “Peace Talks May Follow Ex-Taliban [ORG Mediators Plan  ] , ” [PER Porter  ] claimed that [PER Karzai  ] had personally asked ex-Taliban officials to help start the peace negotiations through a “road map” for a political settlement and mentions [PER Zaeef  ] , [PER Muttawakil  ] , and former [ORG Taliban  ] commander [PER Arsullah Rahmani  ] ( currently a [MISC Parliamentarian  ] ) as “ex-Taliban” liaisons . 
The article also suggests that [PER Mullah Omar  ] may have selected [PER Zaeef  ] as his point of contact for talks with the [MISC Americans  ] and [ORG NATO  ] and laid down some initial conditions of settlement . 
Some of those conditions coincide with President Karzai’s call at the [ORG London Conference  ] for an end to night raids and detentions by foreigners . 
No matter how reconstituted , the [ORG Taliban  ] mentality remains one that many [MISC Afghans  ] fear ( Ref . 
B ) , and the Government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] should increase its efforts to assure the whole population that there will be no peace deal at the expense of non-Pashtuns and women’s rights .
