( C ) [MISC Summary: The Ras Al Khaimah  ] ( [ORG RAK  ] ) Airport is attempting to reinvent itself as a cargo transit point for the [ORG RAK Free Zone  ] in the wake of [ORG RAK Airways  ] suspension of regular commercial flights in late 2008 . 
The airport is also working to distance itself from its reputation as a transport facilitator for clients such as international arms trafficker [PER Victor Bout  ] , who used the [ORG RAK  ] airport as a base of operations . 
The [ORG Wing Air  ] aircraft once linked to [PER Victor Bout  ] are grounded and effectively abandoned . 
Former [ORG RAK  ] Airport CEO [PER Michelle Soliman  ] conveyed continuing concerns about the airport’s reputation and client base , however , and is seeking to identify “more desirable” clients as the airport increases its operations . 
End Summary. -------------------------- Passengers Slow to Come ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former [LOC Ras al Khaimah Airport  ] CEO [PER Michelle Soliman  ] told [ORG ConGen Dubai  ] [PER PolOff  ] and Embassy [PER Abu Dhabi  ] OFAC Attache shortly before her December resignation that [ORG RAK  ] Airport’s growth has been hindered by the failure of its “national” airline , [ORG RAK Airways  ] , which began operations in November 2007 , but stopped scheduled flights just over a year later in December 2008 as a result of the economic downturn ( [ORG Note:  ] [ORG RAK Airways  ] still operates a [ORG Boeing  ] 757 on a wet-lease basis to [PER Hewa Bora Airlines  ] in the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] .

) . 
Although [PER Oussame El Omari  ] , the CEO of the [ORG RAK Free Zone  ] ( [ORG RAK  ] FZ ) recently speculated that [ORG RAK Airways  ] would become the [MISC UAE’s  ] newest bargain airline similar to Fly [LOC Dubai  ] and [ORG Air Arabia  ] , [PER Soliman  ] saw little prospect for [ORG RAK Airways  ] resumption of commercial air services given insufficient operating funds and high management turnover , including seven CEO’s in just two years. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RAK Airways  ] uncertain future is , [PER Soliman  ] believes , dissuading other passenger airlines from establishing regularly scheduled flights to [ORG RAK  ] out of concern that the limited air rights available at [ORG RAK  ] airport could be rescinded if [ORG RAK Airways  ] begins to operate again . 
Although a new arrival terminal opened on September 1 , 2009 , the only passenger flights to [ORG RAK  ] airport are four tourism-related chartered flights a week from [LOC Europe  ] which began in October 2009. --------------- Focus on Cargo --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) To boost its cargo business , [ORG RAK Airport  ] , according to [PER Soliman  ] , has negotiated with [ORG RAK Customs  ] to allow companies in the [ORG RAK  ] FZ not to pay customs fees on goods going directly from the free zone to the airport as long as the goods depart within 10 days . 
Some of the free zone companies utilizing this deal are shipping armored vehicles to [LOC Afghanistan  ] on cargo flights . 
[PER Soliman  ] told Poloff and OFACATT that one idea for future expansion of the airport’s cargo business with the [ORG RAK  ] FZ would be to make part of the airport a free zone so that goods could transfer directly. ----------------------- The [MISC Russian  ] Connection ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Soliman  ] told OFACATT that [ORG Wing Air Services  ] , a company publicly linked to international arms trafficker and [ORG UN  ] sanctions target [PER Victor Bout  ] , is still on the Airport’s registration list only because it is the last registered owner of the [MISC IL-76  ] aircraft and [ORG Gulfstream  ] jet now effectively abandoned at [ORG RAK Airport  ] on their parking apron . 
[PER Soliman  ] said [ORG Mach Avia Services  ] was at one time identified as the agent of the [MISC IL-76  ] , but eventually “washed its hands of it” and claimed that [ORG Wing Air Services  ] was responsible for the aircraft . 
[PER Soliman  ] took EmbOffs on a tour of the airport that included a viewing of [ORG Wing Air  ] aircraft . 
The [ORG Wing Air Gulfstream  ] was completely gutted , apparently cannibalized for parts . 
[PER Soliman  ] said that the [MISC Russian  ] companies were kept on short-term lease arrangements so that they could be moved out of [ORG RAK  ] as soon more desirable clients could be found ( [PER Note: Soliman  ] also pointed out as suspect two new [ORG Bombardier  ] CRJ jets worth USD 50 million abandoned by their owners immediately after they arrived . 
[PER Soliman  ] said the owners are impossible to reach , although sporadically maintenance people show up .

( C ) OFACATT asked [PER Soliman  ] if she knew of any links between the [MISC Russian  ] maintenance facility at [ORG RAK  ] airport , identified on the website azworldairports.com as the [LOC Shahed/Aircess  ] facility , and the [MISC Sharjah-based  ] Aircess company that served as the headquarters for [PER Victor Bout’s  ] network until its designation by the [ORG UN  ] in November 2005 . 
[PER Soliman  ] said that as far as she knew , the facility was run by the company [ORG Mach Avia Services  ] , but that [ORG Mach Avia’s General Manager  ] ( [ORG GM  ] ) [PER Hussein Obeid  ] is also the general manager of a company called [MISC Shahed  ] , which according to Obeid’s business card provides “Air Services” . 
[PER Soliman  ] noted that [ORG Mach Avia  ] was originally registered as the agent for the [PER Victor Bout  ] linked [ORG Wing Air IL-76  ] when it arrived at [ORG RAK Airport  ] in March 2004 , but later advised the airport that the plane belonged to [ORG Wing Air Services  ] . 
[PER Abousaeda Mustafa  ] , a [MISC Russian  ] , informed [ORG RAK Airport  ] that the [ORG Wing Air IL-76  ] aircraft had been sold on January 14 , 2009 by [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Arab Air Cargo  ] to [ORG ILEX  ] or [ORG ELEX Ventures Limited Company  ] ( [ORG NFI  ] ) . 
[PER Soliman  ] said that [ORG RAK Airport  ] could not confirm the validity or authenticity of the documents presented by [PER Mustafa  ] , and that consequently the airport submitted them to the [ORG RAK Courts.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: Despite its lack of passenger traffic , [ORG RAK Airport  ] is looking for opportunities to grow , such as focusing on cargo and drawing in legitimate clients . 
However , it seems that it will not be an easy road ahead as it still has to deal with legacy issues such as the [MISC Wing Air  ] services aircraft , a grounded [ORG RAK Airways  ] , and semi-abandoned jets with unreachable owners . 
Soliman’s resignation from her post as CEO subsequent to this visit also highlights [ORG RAK Airport’s  ] inability to keep consistent management at the helm ; [PER Soliman  ] is the sixth CEO to leave [ORG RAK Airport  ] since 2006 .
