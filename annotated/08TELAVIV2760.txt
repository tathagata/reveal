( [ORG S  ] ) In a visit to [LOC Israel  ] on 16-17 November , [ORG Treasury  ] Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence , [PER Stuart A. Levey  ] , reassured GOI officials that no momentum would be lost in [ORG USG  ] efforts to combat terrorist financing or to pressure [LOC Iran  ] during the transition to a new [LOC US  ] administration in January . 
In meetings with Foreign Minister [PER Tzipi Livni  ] , [ORG Mossad  ] Director [PER Meir Dagan  ] , [ORG National Security Council  ] Chairman [PER Dani Arditi  ] , and others , U/S [PER Levey  ] emphasized recent [LOC U.S.  ] designations against the [ORG Union of Good  ] , the [LOC Islamic Republic of  ] [ORG Iran Shipping Lines  ] ( [ORG IRISL  ] ) , and the recent revocation of [LOC Iran  ] 's " [MISC U-Turn  ] " license . 
In response to GOI officials' pressure to have the [LOC U.S.  ] designate the [ORG Central Bank of Iran  ] ( [ORG CBI  ] ) , [PER Levey  ] underscored the importance of international , multilateral concurrence for such an effort to be a success . 
2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Israeli  ] officials were keen to outline an " escalation " in [ORG CBI  ] programs that they believed pose a danger to the international financial system . 
Several key [MISC Israeli  ] officials identified [PER Reza Raei  ] , Vice Governor of the [ORG CBI  ] , as a key figure in masterminding new ways to help the [MISC Iranian  ] commercial and banking sectors circumvent sanctions . 
[PER Levey  ] promised to continue pushing the [LOC Gulf  ] states on adopting stronger regulation until the last day of his appointment . 
3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Mossad  ] Chief [PER Meir Dagan  ] informed [PER Levey  ] that sanctions were beginning to have a negative effect on [LOC Iran  ] 's regime . 
[ORG NSC  ] Chairman [PER Arditi  ] also told him that the [LOC PA  ] was performing well in its renewed fight against terror finance in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ----- GOI CONCERNED ABOUT COUNTER TERROR FINANCE POLICY CONTINUITY --------------------------------------------- ----- 4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG National Security Council  ] ( [ORG NCS  ] ) Chairman , [PER Dani Arditi  ] , in a November 16 meeting with U/S [PER Stuart Levey  ] , asked whether [PER Levey  ] thought his efforts would continue into the next [LOC U.S.  ] administration . 
Even though he said he planned to resign as required in January , [PER Levey  ] told [PER Arditi  ] that he believed the [LOC Obama  ] team would be committed to continuing the ambitious program against terrorism finance that he has shepherded over the last several years . 
Saying counter- terrorism finance was not a partisan issue in the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Levey  ] subsequently confirmed these sentiments to Foreign Minister ( FM ) [PER Tzipi Livni  ] and [ORG Mossad  ] Director [PER Meir Dagan  ] in separate meetings that occurred on the following day , November 17. ---------------------- IRAN/NON-PROLIFERATION ---------------------- 5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On November 16 , [PER Levey  ] outlined for [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] Deputy Director General for [ORG Strategic Affairs Alon Bar  ] , and Senior Deputy Director General [PER Yossi Gal  ] positive developments in the [LOC Iran  ] effort . 
He told them that [ORG Treasury  ] had been very successful in curtailing business with [LOC Iran  ] by most " major players " . 
[PER Levey  ] said that expanding the non-proliferation strategy into insurance , and putting pressure on [LOC Iran  ] 's oil refining capacity and [ORG Liquid Natural Gas  ] ( [ORG LNG  ] ) industry were next steps being pursued . 
He also reported that the recent [ORG IRISL  ] designation has been unusually effective . 
[ORG CBI  ] 's [PER Reza Raei  ] Masterminds New Methods --------------------------------------- 6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) During their November 16 meeting , [PER Arditi  ] told [PER Levey  ] that the [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence community has continued to see an escalation in [ORG CBI  ] efforts to help designated [MISC Iranian  ] commercial banks circumvent international and [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions . 
The [ORG NSC  ] Chairman presented several recent examples of [ORG CBI  ] behavior that he characterized as unusual for a central bank . 
[PER Arditi  ] identified [PER Reza Raei  ] , Vice Governor of the [ORG CBI  ] for Foreign Exchange Affairs , as the mastermind of these new [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002760 002 OF 004 efforts . 
7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Meir Dagan  ] subsequently told [PER Levey  ] that the [ORG CBI  ] had engineered a way for the UN-designated [MISC Iranian  ] bank [ORG Sepah  ] to conduct foreign business transactions through use of the [ORG Iranian Postal Bank  ] . 
[ORG Bank Melli  ] , a [MISC USG-designated  ] bank , had also purchased shares in investment funds as a way to escape the effects of the sanctions , according to [PER Dagan  ] . 
Using these methods , [LOC Melli  ] and [ORG Sepah  ] have been able to fabricate a method of providing correspondent-like banking services to designated [MISC Iranian  ] banks that find it increasingly difficult to deal in foreign currency . 
[PER Arditi  ] named the " [ORG Persia Equity Fund  ] " as one such financial instrument being used by [LOC Melli  ] . 
[PER Levey  ] commented that any such investment fund or financial instrument could be listed as a derivative designation of [LOC Melli  ] if enough evidence could be shown linking the two organizations . 
[PER Levey  ] told [PER Meir Dagan  ] that he was in favor of pursuing a designation of [PER Raei  ] if GOI allegations were accurate . 
No International Support for Designation of the [ORG CBI  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ 8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Arditi  ] and subsequently , [PER Dagan  ] , asked [PER Levey  ] whether the [ORG USG  ] was considering a designation of the [ORG CBI  ] . 
Although [ORG Treasury  ] had looked into the possibility , said [PER Levey  ] , a designation of the [ORG CBI  ] would be ineffective without a multilateral effort . 
International support for such an effort simply did not yet exist , [PER Levey  ] explained . 
He told [PER Dagan  ] that we need to build support by sharing info about the [ORG CBI  ] 's illicit conduct , similar to the support we built for cutting off the U-turn license . 
[PER Levey  ] said that it would be better to focus on limiting other central and commercial banks' business with the [ORG CBI  ] . 
Noting that the banking industry relies heavily on reputation , [PER Levey  ] told [PER Arditi  ] that the right strategy is to continue exposing the illicit activities of [MISC Iranian  ] banks and banking officials . 
[MISC European  ] Banks' Business with [LOC Iran  ] ---------------------------------- 9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MFA  ] interlocutors revisited the progress of [MISC European  ] banks in non-proliferation efforts . 
In a November 16 meeting with [PER Yossi Gal  ] , Senior Deputy Director General , and [ORG Alon Bar  ] , Deputy Director General for [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] , [PER Gal  ] raised concerns that [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Germany  ] were falling short in their commitment to enforce sanctions within their banking sectors . 
[PER Gal  ] told [PER Levey  ] that the [ORG MFA  ] was planning a visit to [LOC Italy  ] in December , but was unsure whether its attempt to persuade the politicians would filter down to action within the bureaucracy . 
[PER Gal  ] expressed the same concern about the banking sector in [LOC Germany  ] , saying that resistance from the bureaucracy and the private sector often undermined attempts by political figures to improve [MISC German  ] regulation . 
[ORG Bar  ] and [PER Gal  ] encouraged [PER Levey  ] to join the GOI in pressing the governments and banking sectors of [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Italy  ] to do more . 
Cautious Optimism on [MISC Gulf States  ] -------------------------------- 10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On the status of [LOC UAE  ] efforts to stem [MISC Iranian  ] finance , [PER Levey  ] told [PER Gal  ] and [ORG Bar  ] that he was optimistic about the country 's efforts . 
Among other examples , he mentioned that the [LOC UAE  ] had decreased the number of visas it was issuing to [MISC Iranian  ] nationals and that [LOC Emirati  ] ministers were receptive to his requests for increased banking regulation . 
11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) FM [PER Livni  ] told [PER Levey  ] that [LOC Israel  ] continues to encourage the [LOC Gulf  ] states to more publicly outline their actions against [MISC Iranian  ] finance within their banking sectors despite the countries' reasons for keeping such actions secretive . 
She asked [PER Levey  ] to join in this effort . 
[PER Levey  ] affirmed that the [ORG USG  ] was encouraging sanctions in all sectors and posited that the [MISC Iranians  ] were beginning to feel the pressure . 
[PER Livni  ] asked if the declining price of oil was becoming leverage in the efforts to thwart [MISC Iranian  ] financial efforts . 
[PER Levey  ] said that it was and that the [MISC Iranian  ] private sector was becoming more vocal in its criticisms of the government . 
12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Levey  ] outlined for his GOI interlocutors recent [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002760 003 OF 004 efforts by [ORG Treasury  ] to broaden its sanctioning of [LOC Iran  ] to the shipping , insurance , and reinsurance industries . 
He cited the designation of [ORG IRISL  ] as a positive first step and mentioned that [ORG Treasury  ] had found willing partners in [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC UK  ] to further efforts in this area . 
Effect of Sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------- 13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dagan  ] told [PER Levey  ] that the economic problems [LOC Iran  ] is experiencing as a result of sanctions are encouraging debate within the regime . 
He said that in order to preserve the revolution , some key figures have begun to consider the need for change . 
The pressure is on , [PER Dagan  ] said , but he could not estimate when [LOC Iran  ] would hit the brink . 
He noted that the lower cost of oil at the moment would likely prompt [LOC Iran  ] to increase its production , thereby encouraging more business through the [ORG CBI  ] . 
With oil prices low everywhere , however , [PER Dagan  ] and [PER Levey  ] agreed that [LOC Iran  ] was a less attractive place for investment . 
[PER Levey  ] told [PER Dagan  ] that the present low oil prices provide a critical opportunity to convince other members of the international community to apply more pressure . 
14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Livni  ] asked [PER Levey  ] if there was a risk of [LOC Iran  ] regaining a foothold in certain markets as a result of the world financial crisis . 
[PER Levey  ] said that the market turmoil has worked to the [ORG USG  ] 's advantage: the crisis has made financial institutions even more risk-averse , thereby lessening [LOC Iran  ] 's attractiveness even further . 
Additionally , while [LOC Iran  ] 's banks are isolated , its economy is not . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Engagement with [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------- 15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) FM [PER Livni  ] asked [PER Levey  ] during their November 17 meeting why the [ORG USG  ] was considering a rapprochement with [LOC Iran  ] through a [LOC U.S.  ] Interests section in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
She questioned whether the tactic would have a net positive outcome when measured against the negative perceptions such a move would be bound to create . 
[PER Levey  ] told [PER Livni  ] that this was a question better posed to the [ORG State Department  ] , but that her concern was the central issue being debated by policy makers in [LOC Washington  ] . 
In [PER Levey  ] 's previous meeting with [ORG MFA  ] officials [ORG Bar  ] and [PER Gal  ] , he said that engagement with [LOC Iran  ] would not work without leverage , indicating that sanctions would need to be in place no matter what the [ORG USG  ] decides to do. --------------------------------------------- ------------- STEMMING [MISC PALESTINIAN  ] TERROR FINANCE: GOI PLEASED WITH PA'S PROGRESS --------------------------------------------- ------------- 16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Levey  ] told [PER Arditi  ] that [ORG Treasury  ] 's recent designation of the " [ORG Union of Good  ] " was proof of the [ORG USG  ] 's commitment to continue to work against [ORG Hamas  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] terrorists . 
[PER Levey  ] said , however , that while the [ORG USG  ] supported efforts at thwarting terrorism in the territories , the [ORG USG  ] wished to keep humanitarian goods flowing to the needy within the population . 
17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Arditi  ] told [PER Levey  ] that [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) efforts at stemming terrorism within the territories were going quite well . 
He said the [ORG PA  ] 's positive efforts " surprised " his staff and that he " never thought " the [ORG PA  ] would do so well . 
[PER Levey  ] said that [ORG Treasury  ] coordinated with Prime Minister [PER Fayyad  ] on the [ORG Union of Good  ] designation and was pleased to hear that [ORG PA  ] efforts were held in high regard by the GOI . 
18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) When [PER Levey  ] inquired about efforts to prevent correspondent banking relations in [LOC Gaza  ] from being severed , [PER Arditi  ] said that the [ORG Postal Bank  ] " was on the agenda " . 
[PER Arditi  ] lamented that the services provided by the [ORG Postal Bank  ] would not be as good because of its small size and limited capacity . 
He expressed his hope that the central bank governor would be able to delay the commercial banks' decision to end their relationship with the [MISC Palestinians  ] until a permanent solution was ensured .
