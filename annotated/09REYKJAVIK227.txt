( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament was expected to vote on the [ORG Icesave  ] bill on December 30 ; however , new information emerged on the eve of the vote that may further delay a resolution to the issue . 
The media is reporting that the [MISC Icelandic  ] negotiating team , which concluded the original [ORG Icesave  ] agreements in March with the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments , may have withheld pertinent information from the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] . 
Specifically , the negotiating team did not pass along an opinion from the [MISC British  ] law firm [ORG Mishcon de Reya  ] stating that the [ORG British Government  ] may have improperly seized a [MISC British  ] subsidiary ( [ORG Heritable Bank  ] ) of the [MISC Icelandic  ] bank [ORG Landsbanki  ] as the financial crisis hit [LOC Iceland  ] in early October 2008 . 
Some are now arguing that , had the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] been aware of this information , it could have pressed for better terms in its negotiations with the [MISC British  ] and avoided much of the ensuing displeasure with the [ORG Icesave  ] agreement. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The chairmen of the opposition parties were disturbed that this information was only coming to light now and insisted that they receive additional time to analyze this new development . 
They also demanded that the head negotiator who withheld the information , [PER Svavar Gestsson  ] , be summoned to a [ORG Budget Committee  ] meeting to explain his actions . 
Parliamentary debate on the [ORG Icesave  ] bill was expected to conclude on the morning of the 30th with a vote shortly thereafter , but discussions only resumed in the late afternoon after a delay of several hours . 
With just nine parliamentarians left to speak , some still believe that a vote on the [ORG Icesave  ] issue is imminent , while others think it will not take place until after the new year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Approximately 100 protestors gathered outside of the parliament building on December 30 for a previously scheduled protest against the [ORG Icesave  ] vote . 
The demonstration occurred peacefully and no police intervention was needed . 
There are reports that additional demonstrations are organized for the upcoming days .
