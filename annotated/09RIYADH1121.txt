[ORG RIYADH  ] 928 Classified By: CDA Ambassador [PER Richard Erdman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) SUMMARY AND COMMENT -------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) In the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt targeting Assistant Interior Minister [LOC Prince Mohammed  ] bin [PER Naif  ] ( [PER MbN  ] ) ( ref A ) , King [PER Abdullah  ] and other officials responded swiftly and decisively to reassure the public that the [PER Prince  ] was well , and reaffirm the [ORG Kingdom  ] 's commitment to combating terrorism . 
The press and the public universally condemned the attack , characterizing it as a direct assault against the [MISC Saudi  ] state and [MISC Islam  ] . 
A more measured reaction in the blogosphere hints at how this most recent incident might affect domestic debate on the proper approach to dealing with domestic terrorism , with some calling for continued leniency and emphasis on reform and others arguing the [MISC Saudi  ] government is being too lax . 
The attack seems to have strengthened the already positive public reputation of [LOC Prince Mohammed  ] bin [PER Naif  ] , and many religious-minded [MISC Saudis  ] will see his miraculous survival , almost unscathed , as a sign of Divine protection and blessing for his efforts against [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and other extremists . 
For his part , [LOC Prince Mohammed  ] has told us the attack has only strengthened his resolve , and convinced him that the [ORG Kingdom  ] 's counter-terrorism strategy , combining firmness with understanding , is effective and should continue . 
End Summary and Comment . 
OFFICIAL REACTION SWIFT AND DECISIVE ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Official condemnation came from all quarters immediately following the attack . 
The [ORG Saudi Press Agency  ] published photographs of King [PER Abdullah  ] and [PER MbN  ] , wearing a bandage on his left middle finger , meeting at the hospital in [LOC Jeddah  ] . 
News channel [LOC Al-Arabiya  ] played a tape of the visit throughout the day in which the visibly concerned King praised [PER Allah  ] for the [PER Prince  ] 's safety and described the attack as an attack against both [MISC Islam  ] and the country: " Thanks be to [PER God  ] that you are safe and nothing has happened to you . 
Everything you might have suffered in the service of your religion and homeland will not be for nothing , [PER God  ] willing . 
" [PER MbN  ] responded that this attack " would only strengthen our resolve to root out the terrorists , " and admitted that he was at fault for failing to require a full search of the bomber . 
Official reports note that the would-be assassin was on a list of 85 wanted terrorists , that [PER MbN  ] was aware of his planned attendance , and that he had been expected to turn himself in at the event. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Other prominent religious and political figures were widely quoted in the press the day after the incident . 
The [ORG Grand Mufti of  ] [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] told [ORG Okaz  ] newspaper the attack was " not unexpected , " and called the assailant " deviant " and " corrupt to the core . 
" Justice Minister [PER Mohammed Al-Issa  ] " thanked [PER Allah  ] " for keeping the [PER Prince  ] safe . 
Interior [ORG Ministry Spokesman Major General  ] [PER Mansour Al-Turki  ] reaffirmed the [ORG Ministry 's  ] commitment to fighting terrorism , characterizing the attack as " an isolated incident " and adding " those who think the war on terror is over in the [ORG Kingdom  ] are mistaken . 
" PRINCE FETED IN PAPERS , PUBLIC SHOCKED BY ATTACK --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) All major [MISC Arabic  ] and [MISC English  ] dailies led with the story , focusing prominently on [PER MbN  ] himself and his role in the [ORG Kingdom  ] 's war on terror . 
[ORG Al-Sharq Al-Awsat  ] dedicated the first three pages of the August 29 edition solely to the attack on the [PER Prince  ] and related subjects . 
Other papers included lengthy biographical profiles of the [PER Prince  ] , editorial cartoons dealing with the event , and even poems in his honor. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The articles and editorials show broad support for [PER MbN  ] and , more generally , the fight against terrorism . 
Many depicted the event as an assault on the [MISC Saudi  ] state that called for a patriotic response . 
[MISC Saudi  ] journalist [PER Dawood Al-Shiryan  ] wrote in [ORG Al-Hayat  ] that the attack was " terrorism as a political rebellion attempting to undermine the authority of the state . 
" [ORG Okaz  ] called the attack " an attack on the security of the nation...that should make everyone alert and ready to fight . 
" The August 29 editorial cartoon in [ORG Al-Watan  ] depicted a prone terrorist , wearing an explosive belt and holding a detonator in each hand , dead and bleeding [ORG RIYADH  ] 00001121 002 OF 003 from a wound caused by the [MISC Saudi  ] flag planted in his back . 
In the same paper , a caricature accompanying a poem celebrating the [PER Prince  ] as " Engineer of [PER Love  ] and War " shows him carrying a shield resembling the [MISC Saudi  ] flag. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The public 's reaction as portrayed in an [ORG Arab News  ] article was of " shock , disgust , and dismay , " noting that the timing of the attack during the holy month of [PER Ramadan  ] was a particular source of ire . 
One student in [LOC Jeddah  ] said " Yes , there is frustration among a section of people regarding our foreign policy , but what happened...is deplorable and utterly un-Islamic . 
" A [MISC Riyadh-based  ] professional questioned whether the [ORG Kingdom  ] should continue with its rehabilitation programs , saying these efforts had been " nullified " by the attack and that the perpetrator had " betrayed our leaders . 
" Others called the attack " evidence that the government 's anti-terror tactics have been largely successful , " and observed " panic in the terror camp " and " frustration with the government 's continued success of hitting ( terrorists ) hard . 
" DIVERSE REACTION IN THE BLOGOSPHERE ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On his [MISC Saudi Jeans  ] blog , [PER Ahmed Al-Omran  ] expressed relief that the [PER Prince  ] was not seriously injured and hope that the incident would not " add fuel to the fire " of the debate between liberals and conservatives . 
He added , " this is a time for solidarity and national unity , let us not ruin it . 
" A contributor to blog Al-Saha encouraged [PER MbN  ] to continue to demonstrate openness and patience with terrorists , not revert to iron-fisted policies . 
An informal poll on the same website indicated strong support for the [PER Prince  ] , with 58% of voters suggesting [PER MbN  ] should replace his father as Interior Minister . 
Liberal blog [ORG Al-Tomaar  ] said the attack was the result of " spoiling terrorists and treating them leniently , " referring to the [ORG SAG  ] 's widely-touted terrorist rehabilitation scheme ( ref B ) . 
CONTACTS RESERVE COMMENT ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Post contacts were reluctant to comment substantively on the attack over the phone , telling us that it was common for royals to welcome well-wishers during [PER Ramadan  ] , that they were relieved [PER MbN  ] was not injured , and that they wondered why the man was not checked . 
When the subject was broached at a meeting between [ORG PAS  ] officers and Deputy Minister of Higher Education [PER Mohammed Alohali  ] on August 29 , however , he went somewhat beyond the fulsome praise of [PER MbN  ] as " Qahir al [MISC Erhaby  ] " ( conqueror of terrorism ) that is the stuff of most media commentary . 
" We know what we , re up against , " said [PER Alohali  ] , adding that dangerous extremists were still a threat to the country . 
This , he said , was the reason the [ORG SAG  ] was pushing educational reform so hard . 
[LOC TERROR  ] , [LOC YEMEN  ] ALREADY HOT TOPICS -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Saudi  ] soul-searching about the root causes and extent of domestic terrorism has been evident since 2003 , and the August 20 announcement that 44 suspected [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] militants had been arrested in the [ORG Kingdom  ] injected it with new vigor . 
On August 22 , [ORG Al-Sharq Al-Awsat  ] columnist [PER Husayn Al-Shubakshi  ] praised the [MISC Saudi  ] security forces for their " pre-emptive , focused , professional , and secret blows , " and credited [PER MbN  ] directly for the [ORG Ministry 's  ] success. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In an August 27 piece in the same paper , columnist [PER Mshari Al-Zaydi  ] also considered the arrests a success , while citing the need to confront terrorism as an ideological issue . 
That this new batch of terrorists was predominantly [MISC Saudi  ] , middle-aged , and well-educated challenged previous assumptions that economic deprivation and youthful religious zealotry were responsible for domestic terrorism , and indicated that the government needed to rethink its approach . 
" [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is now confronting a new virus that is constantly evolving , " he writes , adding " the ideological doctor who is holding on to the surgeon 's scalpel...is yet to enter the operating theater . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Although unvoiced in the gushing media paeans to [PER MbN  ] , ordinary [MISC Saudis  ] are wondering how this assassination attempt came so close to fruition . 
According to today , s edition of " [ORG Okaz  ] , " the suspect managed to make his way from [LOC Yemen  ] into [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] some weeks ago , and finally rented a furnished apartment in [LOC Jeddah  ] . 
We anticipate that such reports will inevitably spur some introspection into how well the security services are patrolling the [LOC Asir  ] region .
