( c ) [MISC Summary:  ] The closure case against [LOC Turkey  ] 's ruling Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] ( [ORG AKP  ] ) is a blow to this country 's future . 
It reflects unresolved conflicts about the nature of [LOC Turkey  ] , the state , the extent of popular democracy and the role of religion in society . 
It also results from failed leadership by PM [PER Erdogan  ] over the nine months since his re-election victory last July . 
The outcome is uncertain , but the crisis here must be viewed through the peculiar entity that is [MISC Turkish  ] democracy -- imperfect , crabbed , but functional in its way . 
US priorities are sustaining our ability to work with this country on mutual interests and supporting its democratic process in a broad sense , but we should avoid opining on the specifics of [MISC Turkish  ] politics . 
This approach will respect the raucous and historic debate and politicking among [LOC Turks  ] taking place now about the future of their country -- a vital process for democracy here to continue to mature . 
End Summary . 
Implications of the Closure Case -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( c ) Here is one way of looking at the [ORG AKP  ] closure case . 
It is an attempted judicial coup , a [MISC Clausewitz-like  ] extension of politics by legal means . 
The indictment reads like a political tract . 
It relies on newspaper clippings to justify excluding the party and 70-odd leaders from politics . 
Among more bizarre bits of proof that the [ORG AKP  ] intends to undo secularism are press reports of Secretary [PER Powell  ] praising the country , s " moderate [MISC Muslim  ] " government and on its support for [ORG BMENA  ] . 
The propriety of banning parties is questionable in any democracy . 
A ban based on a legally weak indictment of a party which nine months ago received 47 percent of the vote nationally and pluralities in 76 out of [LOC Turkey  ] 's 85 constituencies looks like a travesty for democratic values and the rule of law. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( c ) Another way of looking at the case focuses on its consistency with democracy [MISC Turkish  ] style . 
The constitution and laws have long provided for banning politicians and dissolving parties , 26 of which have fallen victim . 
The [ORG AKP  ] had many years in office to change this and other questionable policies ( like [ORG Article  ] 301 on insulting [MISC Turkishness  ] ) , but did not . 
What looks to [MISC Western  ] democracies like an unusual power in the judiciary to compromise the results of last July 's election is one of [LOC Turkey  ] 's check and balancing mechanisms to protect the rights of the minority -- in this case secularists who feel threatened by the [ORG AKP.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( c ) Some truth exists in both of these points of view . 
One clear thing is that PM [PER Erdogan  ] has stumbled badly . 
One blunder was failing to make political bans more difficult when relevant legislation was amended several years ago . 
As if dizzy with his own success , [PER Erdogan  ] failed to reassure the 53 percent who voted against his government last July that it would respect their interests too . 
He failed to use his re-election mandate to continue EU-related reforms that were the most formidable tools for calming fears of [MISC Islamization  ] and untrammeled majority rule . 
He allowed himself to be goaded by the [ORG National Action Party  ] ( [ORG MHP  ] ) into putting the headscarf ban at the head of the reform queue . 
For this short-term populist win , he sacrificed a larger constitutional reform package that would have significantly strengthened [LOC Turkey  ] 's democracy . 
Effective , progressive governance that was the hallmark of early [ORG AKP  ] years in office dried up in the 2007 election year , and no momentum returned after that . 
These and other missteps exacerbated fears among many that [PER Erdogan  ] was going too far , too fast ; that there were no effective constraints on the [ORG AKP  ] ( especially after the military 's botched intervention last spring ) ; and that fundamentalists might soon dominate the bureaucracy , judiciary , universities , etc. , to change [LOC Turkey  ] in dangerous and permanent ways. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( c ) The closure case on its face is a set-back for democracy and stability in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
For many , especially the large swath of previously neglected voters who make up [LOC Turkey  ] 's emerging middle class and whom [PER Erdogan  ] 's populism galvanized , the message is that [MISC Turkish  ] democracy is too poorly developed to protect their interests against the traditional elite . 
This message is even more threatening to [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000691 002 OF 003 those here who are still marginalized , especially [MISC Kurds  ] . 
More broadly , the case looks like , and to some extent is , the revenge of an unelected and unaccountable bureaucracy against [PER Erdogan  ] and popular democracy . 
[LOC Turks  ] fear the [LOC Deep State  ] and many , including strong critics of the [ORG AKP  ] , are deeply uncomfortable with the judiciary 's attempt to manipulate the power balance . 
Associated turmoil also renders [LOC Turkey  ] 's vulnerable economy more uncertain at a time when global trends are already very negative ; a big downturn would reinforce the sense of crisis here. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( c ) Today , however , [LOC Turkey  ] remains a secure , relatively stable emerging democracy . 
There is no serious violence on the streets , and the economy has not crashed . 
The closure case is not a catastrophe or the undoing of [LOC Turkey  ] 's peculiar and imperfect democracy , at least not now . 
It is better seen as one among many moves in a very long chess game that all sides here , including [PER Erdogan  ] and the [ORG AKP  ] , are adept at playing . 
The mere fact of the indictment has already moderated the [ORG AKP  ] 's rhetoric and pushed it to emphasize effective governance and more consensual policies , especially [ORG EU  ] accession-related reform . 
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that this is the way [LOC Turkey  ] 's crabbed , military-drafted constitution intended the system to work . 
Figures ranging from former President [PER Demirel  ] to former parliamentary Speaker Cetin have remarked to us recently that [LOC Turkey  ] has seen worse and will come through these difficulties all right . 
At this point , at least , their reassurances seem more justified than not. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( c ) How matters will play out in the short-medium term is uncertain . 
-- A " victorious " [ORG AKP  ] will still face intransigent opposition from one-third of the public , not to mention the courts , bureaucrats and generals . 
-- A post-closure [ORG AKP  ] will reorganize under a new name and almost certainly still have the votes among its un-banned MPs to form the next government alone . 
People already talk about plausible , post-closure scenarios that involve bringing [PER Erdogan  ] and other potentially banned figures back into the picture . 
-- Banishing the [ORG AKP  ] will not change the reality that the main opposition parties are weak , divided and ill-equipped for 21st century politics . 
Space may be created for a new centrist party , but credible leaders are not evident now , and the outlook for new elections that would propel them to prominence is uncertain . 
The [MISC Islamist  ] fringe in and outside the [ORG AKP  ] could coalesce and become more radical ; tarikats like the Gulenists may become more significant power centers than they are now . 
Without broad constitutional reform to replace the current top-down state and better protect individual liberties , and without more consensus on the extent and limits of secularism in modern [LOC Turkey  ] , this struggle is likely to continue. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( c ) This episode will last at least six months and possibly a year or more . 
In the meantime , [LOC Turkey  ] 's leadership will be distracted and cautious . 
Unfortunately , this comes during a period of immense challenges to and opportunities for [MISC Turkish  ] interests domestically and in the region that include the [MISC Kurdish  ] issue , relations with [LOC Iraq  ] and the KRG , energy security , [LOC Cyprus  ] , [LOC Armenia  ] , [ORG EU  ] accession , terrorism , etc . 
Policy creativity , never [LOC Turkey  ] 's strong suit , will diminish . 
We also note that before the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] decides the [ORG AKP  ] 's fate , it will likely rule on the headscarf amendments ; reinstituting the ban at universities may actually calm matters and defuse the anti-AKP case . 
The [ORG Court  ] may also rule on the closure of the [MISC Kurdish  ] nationalist [ORG Democratic Society Party  ] ( [ORG DTP  ] ) ; this could prove more explosive than the [ORG AKP  ] case , given that [ORG DTP  ] leaders and constituents accept much less of the constitutional/legal order here than the [ORG AKP  ] mainstream . 
Our Public Posture ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( c ) None of this changes the reality that [LOC Turkey  ] is an extremely important ally in a dangerous region and that it [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000691 003 OF 003 is , despite many faults , more democratic and free than any other country in the [MISC Muslim  ] world . 
We should not stifle , through our intervention , what should fundamentally be a debate by [LOC Turks  ] about the future of their country that is essential if its democratic institutions are to mature . 
Doing so would make this a [LOC US  ] issue in ways harmful to our interests , our influence and to democratic values here . 
We should stick to general principles , and let [LOC Turks  ] sort out the details . 
At some point , as matters develop , our intervention to head off a political meltdown here may be necessary , but that moment isn't now and may well never come. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( c ) With this in mind , our public comments should take a positive and high road . 
We should: -- Make clear our strong support for [LOC Turkey  ] , its democratic institutions and its commitment to democratic values and secular principles that define our alliance and partnership . 
-- Urge [LOC Turkey  ] 's leaders and institutions to work for pragmatic solutions that reinforce stability and build consensus at a critical time for the country and in the region . 
-- Emphasize support for [LOC Turkey  ] 's goal of accession to the [ORG EU  ] and its need to legislate and implement comprehensive political and economic reforms that will sustain that goal and secure liberty and prosperity in the future . 
-- Look forward to continuing to work with [LOC Turkey  ] on behalf of common interests in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [MISC Caucasus  ] , the [LOC Balkans  ] , on terrorism , on energy security , on the [LOC Cyprus  ] problem and elsewhere in the region and the world .
