( B ) [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 140 Classified By: AMBASSADOR CAROL [PER VAN VOORST  ] , REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: EUCOM briefed [LOC Iceland  ] Chief Defense Negotiator [PER Albert Jonsson  ] 4/26 on the [ORG Draft Concept Plan  ] ( the [MISC Conplan  ] ) for the Defense of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER Jonsson  ] responded 4/27 that the [MISC Conplan  ] was fundamentally acceptable as a plan but did not go far enough toward meeting [LOC Iceland  ] 's political needs . 
He set out a list of references [LOC Reykjavik  ] proposes to include in a [MISC U.S.-Icelandic  ] agreement that could be used by the [ORG GOI  ] to underpin their assurance to [ORG Icelanders  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment continues even without a base . 
This agreement would include references that [PER Jonsson  ] believes are necessary to help the government make the case to the public that the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to defend [LOC Iceland  ] remains credible . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] studies the [MISC Icelandic  ] defense proposals , working-level talks will continue on transition issues in preparation for 9/06 closure of [MISC Naval Air Station  ] [ORG Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) . 
End summary. ----------------------------------- [MISC Conplan  ] 4287-06 and its Discontents ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In its briefing to the [ORG Icelanders  ] April 26 , the [ORG U.S. European Command  ] team led by [ORG RADM Richard Gallagher  ] stressed that the EUCOM plan is not fully developed , that we welcome [MISC Icelandic  ] comment , and explained the approval system as the plan moves up to [ORG SecDef  ] . 
At several points in the discussion the [LOC U.S.  ] side urged the [ORG Icelanders  ] to take advantage of the intelligence sharing and other proposals that we offered in the March meeting ( ref A ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Albert Jonsson  ] , the [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation head , commented on the [MISC Conplan  ] in a follow-up session April <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
He said that his side was disappointed with the plan as measured against [MISC Icelandic  ] expectations of a [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to a " robust " and " visible " replacement for the four [MISC F-15  ] fighters . 
While noting that the [MISC Conplan  ] " has an internal logic and is consistent , " [PER Jonsson  ] said the defense plan as it now stands is insufficient politically to reassure the [MISC Icelandic  ] public , parliament , and ministers that [LOC Iceland  ] is adequately defended. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) He proposed that the defense plan be supplemented with a " conclusion " signed at the [ORG SecDef  ] level and issued in conjunction with the completion of the plan . 
The conclusion would contain references to: 1 ) 1951 Defense Agreement . 
2 ) [MISC Conplan  ] 4287-06 . 
3 ) The resources and capabilities that stand behind the [MISC Conplan  ] . 
Wording would not need to be specific as to what units might be deployed to [LOC Iceland  ] but should cite the range of capabilities that the [LOC U.S.  ] has available and where they are sourced . 
4 ) How the [LOC U.S.  ] would provide for [LOC Iceland  ] 's air defense . 
This would not need to specify what units might be deployed if the [LOC U.S.  ] were to continue operation of the radar stations . 
5 ) What personnel and facilities would be maintained at [LOC Keflavik  ] to assist forces redeploying to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
6 ) Visible manifestations of the bilateral defense relationship , whether exercises or deployments or other ways of 's howing the flag.' 7 ) The option for [LOC Iceland  ] to call on [LOC U.S.  ] forces to defend against terrorist threats and attacks . 
In this regard [PER Jonsson  ] noted that the 1951 Defense Agreement is not specific in saying that it applies only to state threats ( as the [MISC Conplan  ] does ) ; and cited [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG Article  ] 5 invocation after September 11 as evidence that military forces can properly respond to terrorist attacks . 
8 ) What is envisaged with respect to law enforcement/non-military security cooperation . 
( [ORG Note: Ministry of Justice Deputy Permanent  ] Secretary [PER Stefan Eiriksson  ] added that [LOC Reykjavik  ] wishes to prioritize intelligence cooperation as described by the [LOC U.S.  ] side in March and hopes to enhance cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG Icelandic Coast Guards  ] . 
He announced that the National Commissioner of Police and the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] would contact the Embassy in early May to initiate collaboration in these areas as well as on training and non-proliferation activities .

( C ) As to the [MISC Conplan  ] itself , [PER Jonsson  ] asked for some specific changes and raised some questions: -- pp . 
1 and 2: Refer to " 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] " or " bilateral 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] " rather than " Defense of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
" -- p . 
9: Delete " [LOC US  ] mission will not include enforcing peacetime air sovereignty . 
" -- p . 
10: To " [ORG GOI  ] will continue to provide access to its territory , " add " in accordance with the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] . 
" -- p . 
10: Why is " [ORG GOI  ] will maintain [LOC Keflavik  ] as an operating international airport " not a redundant assumption if the [ORG GOI  ] is providing access to its territory ? ( [PER Jonsson  ] said we could leave this assumption in if we believed it did in fact add something . 
) -- p . 
21: Could the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] undertake to defend [LOC Iceland  ] bilaterally without [ORG NATO  ] having to invoke collective defense ? ( Reassured that it could , [PER Jonsson  ] accepted the text as drafted . 
) --------- Follow-up --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Jonsson  ] stated that the [ORG GOI  ] would like to come to the next bilateral meeting with a draft text for this " conclusory " document . 
He hoped this meeting could take place very soon ; Ambassador [PER van Voorst  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] would take this [MISC Icelandic  ] proposal under consideration . 
In the meantime , both sides agreed , the governments should continue cooperation on the technical and practical aspects of disposing of [ORG NASKEF  ] assets and ensuring smooth functioning of [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] after September 30 , 2006 . 
[PER Jonsson  ] reiterated five areas of [MISC Icelandic  ] concern in this regard: 1 ) [LOC U.S.  ] military footprint: What will remain after 9/30 ? 2 ) What is the timetable for transition ? 3 ) In the event that few or no military forces remain , how will the [LOC U.S.  ] maintain and monitor its installations in the Agreed Areas ? 4 ) How will the [LOC U.S.  ] carry out its host nation duties for [ORG NATO  ] ? 5 ) How does the [LOC U.S.  ] wish to dispose of the special communications installation at [LOC Grindavik  ] ? 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side assured the [ORG GOI  ] that we are working on these issues and will answer the [MISC Icelandic  ] questions as soon as possible. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Jonsson  ] and his government want our help in reassuring the [MISC Icelandic  ] public as concretely and believably as possible that the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to defend [LOC Iceland  ] remains intact despite the pullout of the planes . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's success in negotiating two agreed minutes with us during the 1990 's is probably at the bottom of this new proposal for greater definition in our military and security relationship . 
We may at some later point choose to seriously consider this option -- but before reaching for this device , we should explore all options of helping the [ORG GOI  ] get the political cover it needs without the cost of the time , effort , and legal complexities of a signed understanding .
