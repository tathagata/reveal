[ORG Embassy Beijing  ] , please see paragraph 4. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Background/Objective: In December 2009 , the [LOC United States  ] shared with [LOC China  ] information regarding attempts by the [MISC Malaysia-based  ] firm [ORG Electronics Component Limited  ] ( [ORG ECL  ] ) to buy [MISC TRS-500  ] gyroscopes from the [MISC Chinese  ] firm [ORG VibTel Industrial Co  ] . 
Inc . 
( Ref A ) . 
These gyroscopes , which are controlled by the [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG MTCR  ] ) and [LOC China  ] 's missile-related export controls , would be suitable for use in the guidance systems of ballistic missiles , cruise missiles , and unmanned aerial vehicles . 
We requested [LOC China  ] investigate this information because [ORG ECL  ] is associated with a network of [MISC Iranian-controlled  ] front companies that procure sensitive goods on behalf of a number of [MISC Iranian  ] entities of proliferation concern. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] officials agreed to investigate this information , but asked for additional details on [ORG ECL  ] 's relationships with firms in [LOC Iran  ] ( Ref B ) . 
To support their efforts in this case , we would like to inform them that [ORG ECL  ] is part of a network of [MISC Iranian-controlled  ] front companies that includes the [MISC Iranian  ] firm [PER Shahin Sefid Esta  ] and the [MISC Malaysia-based  ] front company [ORG Skylife Worldwide Sdn Bhd  ] . 
This network procures sensitive goods on behalf of a number of [MISC Iranian  ] entities of proliferation concern , including the [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1737-designated entities [ORG Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group  ] ( [ORG SHIG  ] ) and [ORG Ya Mahdi Industries  ] . 
We want to provide this information to [MISC Chinese  ] officials and emphasize that we believe the transfer of this controlled equipment to a company linked to UNSCR-designated entities would be prohibited pursuant to [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .
