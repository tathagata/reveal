[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: On August 26 , Minister for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] Ingibjorg [PER Solrun Gisladottir  ] announced that [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers would only in rare circumstances carry arms , and that civilian and military tasks would be more clearly separated in future peacekeeping assignments . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] made the comments in response to an MFA-commissioned report on the suicide attack on [ORG Icelandic Crisis Response Unit  ] ( [ORG ICRU  ] ) peacekeepers in [LOC Kabul  ] in October 2004 . 
The Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) will stop manning the seven positions where [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeeping forces have had to carry weapons in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Instead , civilian , unarmed specialists will be offered for these jobs . 
The FM 's decision is the latest sign of a shift towards development aid that reduces the impact of [MISC Icelandic  ] contributions to [ORG NATO  ] 's and [ORG ISAF  ] 's operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On October 23 , 2004 three [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers serving in [LOC Afghanistan  ] were injured in a suicide bombing at a store on [LOC Kabul  ] 's [LOC Chicken Street  ] that killed an 11-year-old [MISC Afghan  ] girl and a 23-year-old [MISC American  ] woman . 
Icelanders were shocked by the news , as much by television images of the peacekeepers wearing military uniforms and carrying weapons as by the attack itself . 
By and large , Icelanders had been under the impression that their peacekeepers were fulfilling civilian tasks in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , though the [ORG Government of Iceland  ] had allowed them to carry weapons pursuant to force protection requirements and be issued military rank. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In April of this year , FM [PER Gisladottir  ] announced that she had asked two former [ORG Supreme Court  ] justices to investigate the 2004 attack , with a particular emphasis on the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] 's reaction to the incident . 
This new interest came out of renewed efforts by opposition members of parliament to press the [ORG MFA  ] on the issue of compensation for the victims of the attack . 
FM [PER Gisladottir  ] presented the report at a press conference at the [ORG MFA  ] on August 26 . 
The main findings included: -- [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities should better delineate between military and civilian tasks fulfilled by the [ORG ICRU  ] . 
-- [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities have not yet paid disability benefits to two of the three [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers who were injured in the attack . 
The authorities should expedite this process . 
-- In the 2004 incident the [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers took appropriate advance security precautions and reacted properly in every way . 
-- A detailed set of rules on the specifics of travel in danger zones should be drafted . 
The set of rules should note whether personal travel in danger zones should be authorized . 
-- All decision-making on individual trips by peacekeepers shall be meticulous , and the roles and jurisdiction of individual supervisors on such trips should be defined . 
-- Risk assessment of individual trips into danger zones should be made , and situations that could conceivably give terrorists space and opportunity to organize and execute attacks should be avoided . 
-- A systematic plan listing the appropriate responses to incidents , such as the one on [LOC Chicken Street  ] , should be in place . 
-- The justices criticize [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities for not initiating a systematic investigation into the incident after it took place . 
Such an investigation could have shed light on how and why the incident occurred and what lessons can be learned from it. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) At the press conference FM [PER Gisladottir  ] stated that the work of the [ORG ICRU  ] should be strictly limited to civilian tasks . 
She said that only specially trained people , who are authorized to carry weapons when working domestically ( e.g. , police officers and the [ORG Coast Guard  ] 's [ORG Explosive Ordnance Disposal  ] unit ) , would carry weapons when working for the [ORG ICRU  ] . 
According to [PER Gisladottir  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] will stop manning the seven positions with [ORG ISAF  ] where [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeeping forces have had to carry weapons and have been assigned military ranks for the period of their assignment . 
All seven positions are part of [LOC Iceland  ] 's detachment overseeing [ORG NATO  ] operations at [ORG Kabul International Airport  ] . 
Civilian , unarmed specialists will be offered for these jobs to the extent that [ORG ISAF  ] security regulations permit . 
[ORG MFA  ] contacts have clarified that at present , there is no plan to keep filling these posts should incumbents be required to carry arms. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Reaction to the report was minimal , but , as expected , [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] , Chairman of [LOC Iceland  ] 's leading opposition party the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LGM  ] ) , welcomed the Foreign Minister 's new policy on the [ORG ICRU  ] and said it conformed better to the [ORG Left-Green  ] vision of [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeeping . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] bemoaned , however , that [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000195 002 OF 002 the FM stopped short of outlawing any carrying of arms by [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers . 
The [ORG Campaign Against Warfare  ] ( formerly known as the [ORG Union of Military Base Opponents  ] ) said this was an important step away from the " militarization of the [ORG ICRU  ] . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The lawyer for the three peacekeepers who were injured in the attack seized upon the report 's recommendations and said his clients might sue the [MISC Icelandic  ] state if it did not pay their claims for disability benefits , including lost wages , medical expenses and related pain and suffering . 
The three peacekeepers have been engaged in a battle with the state as to whether it is liable to pay compensation , given that the incident did not take place in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
FM [PER Gisladottir  ] said at the press conference that the [ORG MFA  ] will take a careful look at their case , and see what the ministry can do to expedite the processing of the case . 
The plaintiffs' lawyer says he is optimistic that a solution could be found , and that he was scheduled to discuss it at a meeting at the [ORG MFA  ] on August 28. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Foreign Minister 's announcement was not universally lauded within her ministry , as working-level contacts in the [ORG ICRU  ] office and the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] ( which handles operational ties to [ORG NATO  ] ) expressed frustration over the new rules . 
Though resigned to [PER Gisladottir  ] 's views on arming [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers , these contacts noted to EmbOff that the new rules were overly limiting and hampered [LOC Iceland  ] 's ability to make a worthwhile contribution to peacekeeping operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere . 
Some contacts admitted that they will just have to wait " until the next elections " ( in 2011 ) before there will be hope of a policy change in the other direction. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: FM [PER Gisladottir  ] 's decision to stop manning the seven positions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that require arms is in sync with her policy of improving the domestic image of the [ORG ICRU  ] , and continues a trend begun by her immediate predecessor . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] 's decision now is also reminiscent of her move to withdraw [LOC Iceland  ] 's sole representative at [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission-Iraq in September 2007 , a move later lampooned by the [LOC U.S.  ] t.v. show " The [ORG Daily Show  ] " to some embarassment here in [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
The FM has been under pressure from pacifist elements in her own party as well as the [MISC Left-Greens  ] , who have long advocated pulling out the [ORG ICRU  ] from war zones , such as [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Those close to [PER Gisladottir  ] may hope that this most recent change to the [ORG ICRU  ] operating procedures will carve out some breathing space on the left . 
In April 2007 , [PER Gisladottir  ] 's predecessor , [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] , pulled out the [MISC Icelandic  ] mobile liaison teams working under [ORG ISAF  ] at [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's [ORG Ghor Province  ] . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] appears to be set on continuing a similar policy . 
By restricting the carrying of arms to the small pool of those who are previously authorized to do so in [LOC Iceland  ] , and try to fill civilian positions instead , [PER Gisladottir  ] has shown a clear indication of her preference for development aid over security-oriented assistance in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Unfortunately , this effort seems blind to the fact that this greatly reduces the operational value of [LOC Iceland  ] 's support to [ORG ISAF  ] .
