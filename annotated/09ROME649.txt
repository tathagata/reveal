Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Mr. President , your meeting with [MISC Italian  ] PM [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] comes at a time when his closest advisors fear [LOC Italy  ] is losing the credibility and influence that it enjoyed in [LOC Washington  ] under the previous [LOC U.S.  ] administration . 
In fact , while [LOC Italy  ] has been a stalwart partner and participant in nearly every [MISC U.S.-led  ] security operation around the world since the end of the [MISC Cold War  ] , domestic political foibles and economic malaise are diluting its international influence . 
[LOC Italy  ] continues to support our efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and the [LOC Balkans  ] , but its diplomatic , economic and military institutions , which the [PER Berlusconi  ] government and its predecessors have starved for resources , are sorely stretched . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] and his government have tried to compensate for [MISC Italy’s  ] failure to invest in its instruments of national power by presenting [LOC Italy  ] as a mediator and interlocutor with difficult actors on major international issues . 
This self-appointed role has sometimes complicated international efforts . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , for example , [MISC Italy’s  ] role under the previous government gave [LOC Tehran  ] the impression that the international community was divided . 
More recently , GOI actions have provided a [MISC European  ] platform for Russia’s efforts to challenge [ORG NATO  ] security interests in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] will certainly present himself as the best hope for moderating [MISC Russian  ] behavior and will seek a signal from you that he has a mandate to speak on the [MISC West’s  ] behalf . 
He will also seek to use [MISC Italy’s  ] [ORG G8  ] presidency to address issues far beyond the scope and effectiveness of the organization . 
We should discourage both instincts . 
[LOC Italy  ] has an important voice in the [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] community , but its efforts have proven constructive only when undertaken in coordination with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other key allies . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] the Politician ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Our relationship with [PER Berlusconi  ] is complex . 
He is vocally pro-American and has helped address our interests on many levels in a manner and to a degree that the previous government was unwilling or unable to do , since his return to power last spring as well as in his previous turns in government . 
In his first 90 days in office , he approved a controversial [LOC U.S.  ] base expansion that had been halted by bureaucratic inaction and anti-American political opposition ; eliminated caveats on [MISC Italian  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; and allowed us to base two of three [MISC AFRICOM  ] component commands in [LOC Italy  ] . 
At the same time , he has criticized [LOC Missile Defense  ] , [ORG NATO  ] enlargement and support for Kosovo’s independence as [MISC American  ] provocations of [LOC Russia  ] . 
He claimed [MISC Russian  ] PM Putin’s military push into [LOC Georgia  ] in August 2008 was necessary to end the bloodshed of innocents caused by [MISC Georgian  ] President [PER Saakashvili  ] . 
He displays an overweening self-confidence born of stable and strong political popularity that has made him deaf to dissenting opinion . 
The strict control he exercises over his government and party inhibits his staff from giving him unpleasant messages . 
His unorthodox governing style , coupled with his frequent verbal gaffes and high-profile scandals ( including public bickering with his wife about his alleged philandering ) , have caused many , including some inside the [LOC U.S.  ] government , to dismiss him as feckless , vain , and ineffective as a modern [MISC European  ] leader. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) His shortcomings notwithstanding , marginalizing [PER Berlusconi  ] would limit important cooperation with a key ally . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] is one of [MISC Europe’s  ] most enduring politicians whose popularity in [LOC Italy  ] will guarantee that he will influence [MISC Italian  ] politics for many years still to come . 
He has arrested the trend of weak , short-lived [MISC Italian  ] governments that has plagued this country since the end of the Second [MISC World War  ] . 
When successfully engaged , he has shown the willingness to adopt policies , however unpopular , in line with ours -- including support for an expanded [ORG NATO  ] role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and Turkey’s membership in the [ORG EU  ] . 
When ignored , he seeks to carve out a visible , international , and [LOC ROME  ] 00000649 002.6 OF 004 frequently unhelpful role for himself . 
Dealing with [PER Berlusconi  ] , therefore , requires a careful balance of close coordination with him and his key advisors while avoiding giving the impression that he can speak on our behalf with many of the world’s difficult actors. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Italy  ] held elections for the [MISC European  ] Parliament on June 6 and 7 , which reaffirmed Berlusconi’s People of Liberty ( [ORG PDL  ] ) party as [MISC Italy’s  ] largest party , reaching 35 percent , well ahead of the main opposition [MISC Democratic Party’s  ] 26 percent . 
While [PER Berlusconi  ] does not have a competitive rival in the center left , his party missed the 40 percent mark that it was aiming for , and witnessed the growth of xenophobic coalition ally [MISC Northern League  ] ( [ORG LN  ] ) . 
[ORG PDL  ] is a personality-driven party , whose members tell us that the ideology is little more than “Berlusconismo.” The missed target of 40 percent can be attributed to an over-ambitious [PER Berlusconi  ] , as well as the turnout-depressing effects of weeks of personal attacks by the center left in the runup to the election that included allegations of fiscal and sexual impropriety . 
An enduring result of the election will be the heightened competition between [ORG PDL  ] and [ORG LN  ] , who now dominate [MISC Italian  ] politics . 
LN’s tough stands on security and against immigration have won broad approval , even as [PER Berlusconi  ] has tried to stem the flow of [ORG PDL  ] voters to [ORG LN  ] by descending to the anti-immigrant rhetoric usually favored by the [MISC Northern League  ] . 
Additionally , after this mild electoral setback , we can expect [PER Berlusconi  ] to use his [LOC White House  ] meeting and his hosting of the [ORG G8  ] to underscore to [MISC Italians  ] the important figure he cuts on the world stage . 
[ORG Economic Crisis  ] --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Prudent ( some would say stodgy ) banking practices allowed [LOC Italy  ] to avoid the global financial sector meltdown . 
[MISC Italy’s  ] banks simply did not engage in sub-prime lending , and they did not buy the toxic assets that caused so much trouble in the [LOC U.S.  ] and elsewhere . 
But [LOC Italy  ] has not been able to avoid the pain of the worldwide recession that has followed the financial crisis . 
[MISC Italy’s  ] economic growth rate -- which was relatively low even before the crisis -- has dropped precipitously owing to sharp contractions in its export markets and falling domestic demand . 
Unemployment is expected to exceed eight percent this year and to rise further in 2010 . 
Government tax revenues are , not unexpectedly , off sharply . 
[MISC Italy’s  ] already high level of government debt and the debt ceilings that come with [ORG EU  ] membership significantly limit the government’s ability to provide fiscal stimulus for the economy . 
[ORG G8  ] -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Berlusconi’s stewardship of his [ORG G8  ] Presidency has been marked by a proliferation of Ministerial and sub-ministerial meetings coupled with a last-minute change of summit venue from [LOC Sardinia  ] to the earthquake-stricken city of [LOC L’Aquila  ] that took even his [ORG Sherpa  ] by surprise . 
He and his cabinet tend to regard [MISC Italy’s  ] [ORG G8  ] year more as an opportunity to curry favor with [ORG G8  ] outsiders such as [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and [LOC Libya  ] than as a tool to address the world’s problems . 
However , his desire to prevent the [ORG G8  ] from taking a back seat to the G20 on his watch has driven an ambitious agenda that may make useful contributions on climate change , [LOC Africa  ] , development , and food security . 
He will be eager to work with you to build a legacy of [ORG G8  ] deliverables that will bear the [MISC Italian  ] label . 
The [ORG Major Economies Forum  ] meeting during the [ORG G8  ] summit , which will include the leaders of 17-plus countries that emit over 80 percent of global emissions , will be an important chance to mobilize high-level consensus in the run-up to the December [ORG UN  ] climate change talks in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
[LOC Guantanamo Detainees  ] -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Berlusconi  ] welcomed your decision to close [LOC Guantanamo  ] , and has publicly and repeatedly underscored [MISC Italy’s  ] desire to support the move by taking detainees . 
FM [PER Frattini  ] recently outlined for [PER AG Holder  ] the efforts [MISC Italian  ] officials have been making within the [ORG EU  ] to negotiate a [LOC ROME  ] 00000649 003.6 OF 004 common [ORG EU  ] framework that will open the door to individual country agreements with the [LOC U.S.  ] While the junior partner in Berlusconi’s coalition opposes taking any detainees , [PER Berlusconi  ] has made it clear that he views this as a moral commitment to support the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Dependence on [MISC Russian  ] energy , lucrative and frequently nontransparent business dealings between [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , and a close , personal relationship between [PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Putin  ] have distorted the PM’s view to the point that he believes much of the friction between the [LOC West  ] and [LOC Russia  ] has been caused by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] believes he , acting as a mediator , can restore a spirit of dialogue and cooperation between [LOC Europe  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , but largely on [MISC Russia’s  ] terms , through indefinitely postponing [MISC NATO’s  ] outreach to [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] , diluting the EU’s efforts to promote democracy in [LOC Belarus  ] , and undermining OSCE’s important role in promoting human and democratic values across the whole of [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] has publicly proposed to mediate your relationship with [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] and is hoping you will give him a signal , however small , that he has your blessing to do so . 
Instead , you can let him know that we believe that issues of security that affect the transatlantic community should be addressed by the Alliance at large , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not prepared to sacrifice values in exchange for short-term stability predicated on [MISC Russian  ] promises of good behavior . 
And we will react -- and expect others who share these values to do so as well -- when [LOC Russia  ] crosses a red-line , for instance in threatening the sovereignty of neighboring states . 
Energy ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) Berlusconi’s close personal ties with [PER Putin  ] and the very strong corporate ties between [MISC Italian  ] energy parastatal [ORG ENI  ] and [MISC Russia’s  ] [ORG Gazprom  ] often put [LOC Italy  ] squarely at odds with [ORG USG  ] efforts to reduce [MISC Europe’s  ] dependence on [MISC Russian  ] energy . 
For example , the [MISC Italian  ] government is deeply ambivalent about energy projects that would help [LOC Europe  ] diversify its energy imports , while at the same time it is supportive of other projects that would increase [MISC Europe’s Russian  ] energy dependency . 
[ORG ENI  ] , 30-percent owned by the [MISC Italian  ] Government , often dictates [ORG GOI  ] energy policy and uses its influence , through the [ORG GOI  ] , to block [ORG EU  ] energy market liberalization plans . 
[LOC Italy  ] is taking some steps , however , in the right direction , by supporting energy projects that will diversify its own energy sources . 
It would be helpful if you could raise with [PER Berlusconi  ] long-standing [ORG USG  ] concerns about [MISC European  ] energy security , emphasizing that increasing the flow of [MISC Russian  ] gas around [LOC Ukraine  ] is not the same as a policy seeking a true diversity of energy sources , routes and technologies. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG Berlusconi Government  ] is pursuing plans to bring back nuclear power to [LOC Italy  ] . 
[MISC U.S.-based  ] companies [ORG Westinghouse  ] and [ORG GE  ] face stiff competition from foreign rivals , particularly [LOC France  ] , whose governments are heavily lobbying the [ORG GOI  ] . 
A word to [PER Berlusconi  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] expects this to be a fair and transparent competition is critical if [LOC U.S.  ] firms are to have a fair chance to bid for [MISC Italian  ] nuclear energy projects . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) With [LOC Italy  ] frustrated by its exclusion from the [MISC P5-plus-1  ] negotiating circle , [PER Berlusconi  ] will highlight [MISC Italy’s  ] would-be role as an interlocutor between the [LOC West  ] , [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , claiming excellent relations with all parties involved . 
He may also push for the [LOC U.S.  ] to drop the [ORG P5  ] 1 framework altogether . 
[MISC Italian  ] officials were thrilled by your commitment to embark upon direct diplomatic engagement with [LOC Iran  ] , but cannot resist the impulse to try to be “present at the creation.” FM [MISC Frattini  ] has worked strenuously to lock in high-level [MISC Iranian  ] attendance at the June 26-27 Afghanistan-Pakistan Outreach meeting , hoping thereby to play host to the first [MISC U.S.-Iranian  ] ministerial encounter in decades . 
[LOC ROME  ] 00000649 004.7 OF 004 [LOC Libya  ] ----- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Berlusconi  ] has continued [MISC Italy’s  ] policy of developing an expanded relationship with [LOC Libya  ] , largely in order to stem the tide of irregular migration from [MISC Libyan  ] shores , but also to gain advantageous access to [MISC Libya’s  ] oil reserves for [MISC Italian  ] firms , mainly [ORG ENI  ] . 
As follow-up to the 2008 [ORG Libya-Italy Friendship Treaty  ] -- which committed [LOC Libya  ] to sterner measures to deter irregular migrants from entering [LOC Italy  ] from its shores , but also offered 5 billion USD in development assistance -- [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Qadhafi  ] will pay an historic first official visit to [LOC Rome  ] June 10-12 , just before Berlusconi’s [LOC Washington  ] visit . 
As the current [ORG African Union  ] President , [PER Qadhafi  ] will be at the [ORG G8 Summit  ] in [LOC L’Aquila  ] and we anticipate [PER Berlusconi  ] may lobby you to meet with the [MISC Libyan  ] leader during your visit . 
A Partner in Security --------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Berlusconi  ] has maintained a significant military commitment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( 2,600 troops , mostly in [MISC Italy’s  ] [LOC Regional-Command West  ] ) , but has dropped from fourth- to sixth-largest [ORG ISAF  ] contributor as other countries like [LOC France  ] and [LOC Canada  ] have augmented their troop levels . 
At [LOC Stasbourg-Kehl  ] , his government pledged modest increases to cover election security which , if made permanent , would put [LOC Italy  ] back in the top tier of [ORG ISAF  ] contributors . 
He has also supported the creation of the [ORG NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan  ] , doubling the number of [MISC Carabinieri  ] police trainers to over 100 . 
[LOC Italy  ] has been an anemic contributor to international aid efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] and has cut overall foreign assistance by more than 60 percent in this year’s budget . 
However , [PER Berlusconi  ] knows this is a priority area for the [LOC U.S.  ] and will likely respond positively if you press him to do more in the region. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Our shared security interests with [LOC Italy  ] go beyond [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] facilities in [LOC Italy  ] provide unmatched freedom of action and are critical to our ability to project stability into the [LOC Mediterranean  ] , [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] . 
We have 15,000 [LOC U.S.  ] military on six [MISC Italian  ] bases and these installations host some of our most advanced capabilities deployed outside the [LOC U.S.  ] Our bases and activities out of [LOC Italy  ] are not uniformly popular , but PM [PER Berlusconi  ] , in this government as in his last , has made preserving this security relationship a priority , and the [ORG GOI  ] has invariably come through on our top requests , despite domestic political risks . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has approved the expansion of our base at [LOC Vicenza  ] to consolidate the 173rd [MISC Airborne Brigade  ] , the deployment of the [ORG USAF Global  ] Hawk [ORG UAV  ] in [LOC Sicily  ] , and the establishment of [ORG AFRICOM Army  ] and [ORG Navy Component Commands  ] on [MISC Italian  ] soil . 
[MISC Italy’s  ] leadership in other overseas missions helps us concentrate our forces on our top priorities . 
In addition to its troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Italy  ] currently has 2,300 in the [LOC Balkans  ] , 2,400 in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and is the leading contributor to the [ORG NATO Training Mission in Iraq  ] . 
Conclusion ---------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) The robust [MISC U.S.-Italian  ] relationship provides us with major national security benefits in our military missions overseas , our own power projection , and on a broad law enforcement agenda , but the Prime Minister is an erratic steward . 
It might be tempting to dismiss [PER Berlusconi  ] as a frivolous interlocutor , with his personal foibles , public gaffes and sometimes unpredictable policy judgment , but we believe this would be a mistake . 
Despite his faults , [PER Berlusconi  ] has been the touchstone of [MISC Italian  ] politics for the last 15 years , and every indication is that he will be around for years to come . 
When we are able to successfully engage him in pursuit of our common objectives , he has proved an ally and friend to the [LOC United States  ] . 
He respects and admires the [LOC U.S.  ] , and is eager to build a strong and successful relationship with you .
