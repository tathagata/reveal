( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Emboff  ] delivered points contained in reftel to [PER Emil Hreggvidsson  ] , Director of the [ORG Department of International Affairs  ] at the [ORG Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , on January 15 . 
In order to obtain the requested information , [ORG Emboff  ] also spoke with [PER Sigurdur Helgason  ] , an official at the [ORG Icelandic Ministry of Transportation.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to [PER Helgason  ] , there is an [MISC Icelandic  ] law in place that explicitly bans the use of a cell phone while driving . 
Signed in 1987 , and amended in 2001 , the law ( [ORG Article  ] 47 of the [ORG Icelandic Traffic Code  ] ) states that the driver of a motor vehicle is not allowed to operate a cell phone without utilizing hands-free equipment ( e.g. headset ) . 
The law has not been subsequently amended to explicitly outlaw texting while operating a motor vehicle and , according to [PER Helgason  ] , there are no imminent plans to do so. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) There is little available data regarding casualties , injuries or crashes in [LOC Iceland  ] related to talking on the phone or texting . 
[PER Helgason  ] told [ORG Emboff  ] that existing figures on this topic are , essentially , worthless as very few drivers involved in a crash admit that cell phone usage or texting played a role in the accident , primarily because they can be fined if this turns out to be the case . 
He did note , however , that law enforcement officials hand out an average of 10-15 tickets per month to drivers of vehicles who are using a cell phone or texting . 
The current fine for breaking the law is ISK 5,000 ( approximately 40 USD ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Telephone and insurance companies have sponsored nation-wide awareness campaigns to discourage drivers from using cell phones or texting while operating a motor vehicle . 
Shortly after the law came into force , phone companies either offered headsets to people for free or provided them at a significant discount . 
Many private companies have also provided their employees with the equipment for free . 
Insurance companies , meanwhile , have publicly encouraged people to park their vehicles while texting or speaking on the phone if they don't possess the necessary headset equipment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) There are some indications that these legal measures and awareness campaigns in [LOC Iceland  ] are working . 
The [ORG Association of Icelandic Insurance Companies  ] has conducted several surveys on the topic and their studies indicate that the usage of hands-free equipment among drivers is increasing . 
It is estimated , according to these studies , that about 25% of [MISC Icelandic  ] drivers currently use the hands-free equipment on a regular basis. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The overall use of cell phones and text messaging devices remains prevalent in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
According to the [ORG Office of Statistics in Iceland  ] , 99 percent of the nation 's citizens carry a cell phone . 
The [ORG Office of Statistics  ] also reported that the total number of cell phone minutes utilized in [LOC Iceland  ] in 2008 was 677,880 ( thousands of minutes ) ; the total number of short text messages ( SMS ) sent were 143,216 ( thousands of messages ) ; and the total number of multimedia messaging services ( MMS ) sent were 941 ( thousands of messages ) .
