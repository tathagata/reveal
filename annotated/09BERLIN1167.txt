( C ) Summary: Current polling data suggest that the [PER Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDU/CSU  ] ) and the [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) could receive sufficient votes in the September 27 national elections to form a governing coalition . 
The [ORG FDP  ] are strong defenders of citizens' privacy rights and these views have led the [ORG FDP  ] to oppose all of [LOC Germany  ] 's recent counterterrorism legislative proposals , as well as voice concerns about [MISC U.S.-German  ] and [MISC U.S.-EU  ] information sharing initiatives . 
Throughout these debates , the [ORG FDP  ] has favored data protection measures over the need for governments to strengthen security-related information sharing for counterterrorism purposes . 
The [ORG FDP  ] 's strong views on individual liberties and personal privacy could lead to complications concerning law enforcement security cooperation and data sharing . 
Were the [ORG FDP  ] to join the government , we expect they would closely scrutinize any proposals for security officials to access and/or share information concerning private persons with international partners , including the [ORG USG  ] . 
End Summary . 
THE [ORG FDP  ] AND DATA PRIVACY ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG FDP  ] defines itself as a independent pro-business party , advocating low taxes , open trade , and minimal government intervention in business and private life . 
The party promotes [MISC European  ] liberalism , championing freedom and individual responsibility under a government " as extensive as necessary , and as limited as possible . 
" The [ORG FDP  ] 's limited government viewpoint shapes their views on counterterrorism policy . 
Following the September 11 terrorist attacks and in reaction to a number of terrorist plots uncovered in [LOC Germany  ] , successive [MISC German  ] governments have passed a series of legislative packages that have strengthened [LOC Germany  ] 's counterterrorism legal frameworks and broadened the investigative powers of law enforcement agencies . 
The [ORG FDP  ] , which was not a member of these post-9/11 governing coalitions , regularly criticized these amendments for infringing on citizens' personal privacy rights . 
The [ORG FDP  ] 's criticisms of security-related data sharing agreements have also extended to the [MISC U.S.-Germany  ] bilateral " [MISC Pruem-like  ] " agreement to share personal information on serious crime and terrorism suspects ( ref C ) , the [ORG U.S.-EU Passenger Name Recognition  ] ( [ORG PNR  ] ) initiative , and elements of the [ORG Visa Waiver Program  ] that involve sharing information on travelers . 
[ORG FDP Objections to Counterterrorism Laws  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG FDP  ] parliamentarians and party leaders were strong critics of the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] - [ORG SPD  ] government 's introduction of two new counterterrorism legislative proposals , the [ORG BKA Law  ] and the [ORG Terror Camp Law  ] . 
Passed in 2008 and enacted at the beginning of 2009 , the [ORG BKA Law  ] increased the investigative powers of the [ORG Federal Office of Criminal Investigation  ] ( [ORG BKA  ] ) . 
The most controversial aspect of the [ORG BKA Law  ] was that it permitted security officials to use a variety of technical surveillance measures in terrorism investigations ( Ref B ) . 
Specifically , the law provides the [ORG BKA  ] with the power to conduct remote , on-line investigations of the computers of terrorism and serious crime suspects . 
The [ORG FDP  ] strongly opposed these measures as an unnecessary invasion of privacy , despite the limitation of on-line searches to only life-threatening situations ( or threats to the constitutional order of the [MISC German  ] state ) . 
These cases would require a judge 's advance approval and are expected to number just a dozen cases per year . 
Nevertheless , [ORG FDP  ] parliamentarian [PER Max Stadler  ] called the measures " constitutionally questionable , " and in a meeting with [ORG EMIN  ] , [PER Stadler  ] feared that authorities would carry out surveillance without sufficient evidence of wrongdoing . 
[ORG FDP  ] parliamentarian [PER Gisela Piltz  ] warned that the law would turn the [ORG BKA  ] into a " super spy agency resembling the [ORG FBI  ] . 
" Former [ORG FDP Federal Interior Minister  ] , [PER Gerhart Baum  ] , blasted the law , saying it violated privacy rights , freedom of the press , and the inviolability of private residences. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Earlier this summer , the government passed legislation developed by the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] that criminalized a range of terrorism-related preparatory actions such as distributing information on bomb-making and participating in para-military training overseas ( ref A ) . 
The law was developed in response to the September 2007 arrests in [LOC Germany  ] of three homegrown terrorists who had attended an [ORG Islamic Jihad Union  ] terrorism training camp in the [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] border region . 
[ORG Justice Ministry  ] officials and prosecutors have told [PER EconOffs  ] that the new law has closed gaps in [LOC Germany  ] 's legal framework that had previously prevented [MISC German  ] prosecutors from charging [MISC German  ] citizens and residents with activities that directly or indirectly supported terrorist groups . 
Prior to the passage of the law , the [ORG FDP  ] criticized the draft as unnecessary , claiming that existing legislation was sufficient to arrest and prosecute potential terrorists in [LOC Germany  ] . 
The [ORG FDP  ] also criticized that law for allegedly requiring prosecutors to be able to prove that individuals who participate in training at overseas terrorist camps actually intend to carry out attacks ; that the law would thereby permit the punishment for thoughts , rather than for actions . 
[ORG Justice Ministry  ] officials have indicated to [PER EconOffs  ] that these criticisms are unfounded hyperbole and that prosecutors will be able to build strong cases against those who undergo training at foreign terrorist training sites . 
[ORG FDP Objects  ] to [MISC U.S.-German  ] Data Sharing Agreement --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Immediately following the March 2008 completion of the [MISC U.S.-German  ] data sharing agreement to enhance cooperation in preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crime ( aka , the [MISC Pruem-like  ] agreement , Ref C ) , [ORG FDP  ] parliamentarians began to express concerns regarding the agreement . 
[ORG FDP  ] members took particular aim at an article in the agreement that calls for additional data protection measures to be taken if special categories of personal data ( such as ethnic origin , political opinion , religion , trade union membership , and sexual orientation ) are transferred among law enforcement agencies . 
( Comment: In our discussions with [ORG FDP  ] parliamentarians , we explained that negotiators did not foresee that such information would need to be transferred regularly and that the article was inserted as a means of providing extra data privacy protections in the rare occurrence that such information was pertinent to an investigation . 
End Comment . 
) In meetings with [ORG EMIN  ] , [PER Stadler  ] and [PER Piltz  ] also expressed objections to the data retention periods of the agreement , questioned which [ORG USG  ] law enforcement agencies would have access to the information , and voiced a general concern about potential misuse of the personal information ( names , DOBs , addresses , passport numbers , etc . 
) that would be shared by the agreement . 
[PER Piltz  ] further claimed that the [LOC U.S.  ] government as a whole lacked effective data protection measures in comparison to [LOC Germany  ] and questioned why the [ORG USG  ] does not have a overall federal data protection commissioner as [LOC Germany  ] does . 
( Comment: [MISC Piltz'  ] remark underscores the importance of ensuring [MISC German  ] officials receive information about [ORG USG  ] data protection policy . 
The April visit to [LOC Berlin  ] by DHS Chief Privacy Officer [PER Callahan  ] was useful in this regard , but more needs to be done to ensure [MISC German  ] officials understand [LOC U.S.  ] data protection policy . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG FDP  ] leaders have also taken aim at [MISC U.S.-EU  ] agreements that include data sharing elements . 
Following the July [ORG EU  ] GAERC decision to give the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency a mandate to begin negotiating a successor agreement governing [ORG USG  ] access to the Society for [ORG Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications  ] ( SWIFT ) database of financial transactions , [ORG FDP  ] head [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] called the plan " totally unacceptable " and said that the " plan must be stopped . 
" [PER Parliamentarian Piltz  ] , who is a member of the [ORG Bundestag Interior Committee  ] , has criticized the [ORG U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record  ] ( [ORG PNR  ] ) data transfer agreement for collecting " pointless " information on travelers and she doubts whether the information collected under [ORG PNR  ] would be of any value to law enforcement officials . 
In meetings with [PER EconOffs  ] , [PER Piltz  ] broadly spoke of governments , particularly that of the [LOC U.S.  ] , accumulating large amounts of data on their ( mostly ) innocent citizens . 
[PER Piltz  ] expressed concerns that [MISC German  ] commercial interests could be damaged when [LOC U.S.  ] authorities obtained [ORG PNR  ] data on [MISC German  ] business travelers that might somehow be shared with [MISC American  ] competitors . 
Would the [ORG FDP  ] be a reliable security partner ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG FDP  ] 's voting record on counterterrorism legislation and the views of leading [ORG FDP  ] security policy figures described here suggest that cooperation on security matters , particularly those involving information sharing , with a future [MISC German  ] government that includes the [ORG FDP  ] could be problematic . 
At times , the [ORG FDP  ] 's fixation on data privacy and protection issues looks to have come at the expense of the party forming responsible views on security policy . 
The [ORG FDP  ] has been out of power for over 10 years and lack experience tackling security issues in the [MISC Internet  ] age . 
The [ORG FDP  ] appears not to fully grasp the transnational character of terrorism today and terrorists' increasing use of the [MISC Internet  ] and related technology to recruit , train and organize . 
Current Interior Minister [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) has repeatedly drawn attention to terrorist use of the [MISC Internet  ] , which he calls the " main medium of holy war against the West - it is the communication platform , advertising medium , distance university , training camp , think tank and recruiting instrument for terrorists . 
" [PER Schaeuble  ] understands that combating terrorism in a globalized world requires international cooperation and for security officials to use modern technology . 
No [ORG FDP  ] leader has displayed a similar understanding of the need to find a proper balance between personal freedoms and security measures ; the [ORG FDP  ] has all too often found it politically expedient to cast these goals as mutually exclusive. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) At election campaign rallies last week [ORG FDP  ] Chairman [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] criticized the on-line surveillance measures contained in the [ORG BKA  ] law and championed the [ORG FDP  ] as the sole party committed to data privacy and protection issues . 
[ORG FDP  ] parliamentarian [PER Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] has been suggested as a possible Justice Minister in a [MISC CDU/CSU  ] - [ORG FDP  ] government , a job she previously held under Chancellor [PER Helmut Kohl  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) . 
Given that she resigned as Justice Minister in 1996 after failing to obtain support for her rejection of a [ORG CDU  ] proposal to expand the state 's right to monitor private citizens , we would expect her to closely scrutinize all bilateral and [MISC U.S.-EU  ] information sharing proposals . 
In particular , a [ORG FDP-led Justice Ministry  ] could well complicate implementation of the bilateral [MISC Pruem-like  ] agreement , prevent negotiations on a [MISC HSPD-6  ] terrorist screening data sharing arrangement , and raise objections to [MISC U.S.-EU  ] information sharing initiatives. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) An [ORG MFA  ] official working in the counterterrorism office noted that one reason the [ORG FDP  ] has been so vocal in opposing [LOC Germany  ] 's counterterrorism legislative drafts , bilateral and [MISC U.S.-EU  ] security initiatives is due to the fact that they are in the opposition . 
Pure political considerations dictate that the role of the opposition is to oppose the governing coalition 's proposals . 
Following this line of reasoning , were the [ORG FDP  ] to join the [MISC CDU/CSU  ] in a governing coalition , the responsibilities of power would perhaps convince them to take a more constructive approach to counterterrorism and security issues . 
Furthermore , given that the [ORG FDP  ] would be the junior partner in the coalition , we hope that [MISC CDU/CSU  ] leadership would ensure that [MISC German  ] legal frameworks are adequate and that law enforcement and security officials continue our current close cooperation and robust information sharing on operational matters .
