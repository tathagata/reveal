( C ) Summary: With a seven-week period of bilateral estrangement in our rear-view window , we have an opportunity -- again -- to build a more constructive relationship with [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The warming trend in the bilateral relationship continues . 
President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] and her government rolled out the red carpet for [PER CODEL Engel  ] and [PER PDDNI Kerr  ] , and the circle of [ORG GOA  ] luminaries making positive statements about the [LOC United States  ] is growing . 
Capitalizing on this opportunity , however , will be no easy task . 
Confidence must be rebuilt on our side and in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] . 
The [ORG GOA  ] must demonstrate its commitment to a constructive relationship , including through visits to the [LOC United States  ] . 
But concerted effort is also needed from our side , including visits to [LOC Argentina  ] by senior [ORG USG  ] officials . 
The presence of authoritative [ORG USG  ] officials here , and the attendant positive media coverage it creates , feed the [MISC Argentine  ] need for attention , directly attacking one of the main causes of anti-Americanism here -- the perception that the [ORG USG  ] does not care enough about [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The hard work will be worth the effort if we can make a dent in anti-U.S. sentiment and influence [LOC Argentina  ] to stay out of the [MISC Bolivarian  ] camp . 
Making [LOC Argentina  ] a more cooperative interlocutor and receptive audience for [LOC U.S.  ] ideas is achievable . 
End Summary . 
An Austral Warming Trend ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Three weeks have passed since the [ORG GOA  ] signaled an end to its bilateral squabble with the [ORG USG  ] via a highly publicized meeting on January 31 betweQPresident [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) and Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] . 
( The [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador is the only Chief of Mission who has been received privately by [ORG CFK  ] ; she has now received him three times since her inauguration . 
) The change in how the [LOC United States  ] is treated and portrayed by [MISC Argentine  ] authorities is striking . 
As we had agreed beforehand , [ORG CFK  ] insiders followed the January 31 session with positive and conciliatory statements from Cabinet Chief [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Jorge Taiana  ] , and others . 
From January 31 on , the [MISC Argentines  ] have given prominent positive public play to each event involving a [ORG USG  ] visitor , including the two ( [PER CODEL Engel  ] and [ORG PDDNI  ] ) that occurred in the last week. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The chorus of anti-U.S. recriminations has fallen silent . 
In their place , we are hearing positive pronouncements about our country . 
On February 20 , for example , after a meeting between the Ambassador and Minister of [ORG Defense Garre  ] , a hold-over from the first [PER Kirchner  ] administration who had previously resisted close cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] , the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] issued an upbeat communique on its website noting that " the [MISC Argentine  ] side expressed gratitude for [MISC American  ] assistance . 
" The statement then proceeded to detail several areas of successful bilateral cooperation that helped to train and transform [LOC Argentina  ] 's military. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In the wake of the meeting three weeks ago with [ORG CFK  ] , the Ambassador has had friendly and productive meetings with Cabinet heavyweights such as Cabinet Chief [PER Fernandez  ] , [ORG MOD Garre  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Taiana  ] , Economy Minister [PER Lousteau  ] , and Justice Minister [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] ( reftels A-E ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) More importantly , [ORG CFK  ] herself has demonstrated her continuing personal interest in ties with the [ORG USG  ] by hosting two meetings in her presidential office at the [LOC Casa Rosada  ] with [LOC U.S.  ] visitors in rapid succession: a positive , well-covered session with [PER CODEL Engel  ] on February 21 , and [PER PDDNI Kerr  ] , who had a productive meeting with her on February <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
Privately , [PER Rep. Engel  ] described the [ORG CODEL  ] 's 90-minute meeting with [ORG CFK  ] as " a home-run . 
" The meeting was covered intensively by the media , which characterized the event as a " Gesture of [MISC Detente  ] " and " Improvement in Bilateral Relations " in leading daily headlines . 
[PER PDDNI Kerr  ] 's meeting was equally positive . 
[ORG CFK  ] warmly thanked him for his " important " visit , and repeated several times her commitment to the struggle against terrorism ( saying , for example , that her government was " strongly committed to fight terrorism at home and internationally " and that her commitment to counter-terrorism was " absolute " ) . 
[LOC Argentina  ] Is In [LOC Play  ] -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The about-face is striking , because it comes on the heels of a coordinated [ORG GOA  ] effort , with the Kirchners and other [ORG GOA  ] all-stars front and center , to impugn the motives of the [LOC United States  ] in the [LOC Miami  ] prosecution of [MISC Venezuelan  ] agents connected to the matter of [PER Guido Alejandro Antonini-Wilson  ] 's cash-filled suitcase . 
But the rhetorical course-correction is not surprising . 
[ORG CFK  ] spent much of the latter half of 2007 telegraphing her intention to pursue closer relations with the [LOC United States  ] , holding three meetings with Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] and spending a week in [LOC New York City  ] wooing investors and the media , as well as meeting A/S [PER Shannon  ] . 
Just days before her inauguration , in a meeting with the Ambassador , [ORG CFK  ] expressed her admiration for the [LOC United States  ] and her desire to improve the bilateral relationship . 
Her Cabinet Chief [PER Fernandez  ] and new Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] Timerman argue forcefully that she wants to change past [ORG GOA  ] practices and maintain good relations with the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Clearly , there is still hard work to be done to build mutual confidence and establish a basis for sustained " good " relations . 
To maintain and reinforce the recent positive momentum , we need more engagement , not less -- by both sides . 
The [ORG GOA  ] certainly needs to demonstrate its commitment to this effort . 
But it is important to remember that we also have much to gain if things go well. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The foreign policy orientation of the fledgling [ORG CFK  ] government is very much in play . 
Moreover , in our view , the prevailing winds in the region favor our efforts to help [LOC Argentina  ] evolve into a constructive partner . 
[PER Hugo Chavez  ] ( whom [ORG CFK  ] will visit in early March to ink an oil-for-food deal -- septel ) is being portrayed in the local media as increasingly on the defensive , and [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's withdrawal from the [MISC Cuban  ] political scene is being covered here as the end of a radical era . 
In contrast , neo-left politicians like [PER Lula  ] ( who just visited [LOC Buenos Aires  ] to sign a number of bilateral agreements ) and [LOC Chile  ] 's [PER Michelle Bachelet  ] are well-regarded here as pragmatic leaders who are making progress on social justice while maintaining good relations with [LOC Washington  ] . 
We read the tea leaves to indicate that [ORG CFK  ] much prefers to follow [PER Lula  ] 's path than [PER Chavez  ] 's , and wants to diversify [LOC Argentina  ] 's good relations in the world. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) At the same time , there are countervailing forces that could push the new president in another direction . 
Influential figures within her government , such as Planning Minister [PER Julio de Vido  ] , espouse a close embrace of [PER Chavez  ] 's [MISC Bolivarian  ] project . 
Although de [PER Vido  ] 's primary motive for tilting towards [PER Chavez  ] may be pecuniary , a [MISC Bolivarian  ] approach to foreign policy would sit well with [ORG CFK  ] 's poor and working class political constituency , and probably appeal at a certain level to the Peronist/populist instincts of [ORG CFK  ] and her husband . 
[PER Nestor Kirchner  ] himself was never as comfortable with the [LOC United States  ] as his wife has proven to be . 
For example , he never received this Ambassador or publicized contacts with us , whereas [ORG CFK  ] has met the Ambassador six times and played each meeting positively and prominently in the media . 
While [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] is still a powerful decision-maker , he is by most reports ceding foreign policy to [LOC CFK.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In our view , the government 's left-leaning , nationalistic heritage does not necessarily lead to chronic confrontation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG CFK  ] seems more interested in governance and the longevity of her family 's political prospects than in gratuitous Yankee-bashing . 
Without [LOC U.S.  ] engagement , however , our opportunity to develop a more constructive relationship with [LOC Argentina  ] could be squandered . 
We need to stay on the field to win the game . 
Why Visits Help Educate and [ORG Show Interest  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Engagement means , among other things , senior-level visits in both directions . 
This is true for symbolic and practical reasons . 
Like other geographically isolated countries , [MISC Argentines  ] keep track of who visits them and who doesn't . 
The [ORG GOA  ] 's infatuation with the travel plans of Assistant Secretary [PER Shannon  ] reflects a deep-seated , society-wide insecurity about [LOC Argentina  ] 's relative importance in the world . 
[MISC Argentines  ] obsess over the perceived indifference of other countries to their interests and concerns , especially that of the [LOC United States  ] . 
Visits to the region by senior [ORG USG  ] officials that seem to hopscotch over [LOC Argentina  ] are always noted in the press and the corridors of power. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG CFK  ] clearly shares this fixation . 
She told the Ambassador late last year that she faults the [ORG USG  ] for not paying sufficient attention to [LOC Latin America  ] ( read: [LOC Argentina  ] ) over the past few years , and repeated that analysis to [ORG CODEL  ] [PER Engel  ] on February 21 ( ref F ) . 
This is not new , or confined to [ORG CFK  ] and her constituency . 
It is a widely shared perception in [LOC Argentina  ] that the [LOC United States  ] has only rarely sustained positive interest in the [LOC Southern Cone  ] . 
( At a recent lunch with prominent local analysts , businesspersons , and media figures for [PER PDDNI Kerr  ] , this was a recurrent theme -- and none of them were government supporters . 
) High-level visits can be used to demonstrate our good intentions and sincere desires for stronger relations . 
For example , Secretary [PER Chao  ] 's December visit to [ORG CFK  ] 's inauguration helped us to rebut accusations of a [LOC U.S.  ] conspiracy against the [ORG GOA  ] during the furor over the [LOC Miami  ] court case. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Just as importantly , visits help [ORG GOA  ] officials to learn . 
[ORG CFK  ] and her husband know little about the way that our society and political system function . 
This holds true for most of their closest advisors and the [MISC Argentine  ] political establishment writ large as well . 
The recent bilateral crisis , for example , reminded us how few of them ( including those in the " pro-U.S . 
" camp ) really understand the extent of our justice system 's independence . 
To our great advantage , [LOC Argentina  ] is now headed by a President who wants to learn more about our country -- evinced , for instance , by the manner in which she pumps visitors for information about the [LOC U.S.  ] presidential race . 
( Though she initially favored another woman candidate , it was clear by February 21 that she had absorbed much about all three leading candidates , and in both of her meetings with [ORG USG  ] visitors in recent days she made positive comments about all three and about the vitality of our electoral process . 
) [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] told the Ambassador that he recently recommended that [ORG CFK  ] accept [PER Gordon Brown  ] 's invitation to travel to [LOC London  ] for a gathering of international political party leaders precisely because it would be an excellent opportunity for her to learn more about the global scene through direct contact with other world leaders . 
The [MISC Most Promising Areas  ] of Focus --------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) On the practical level , despite this Mission 's renewed access to every level of the [MISC Argentine  ] government , there are a number of concrete policy areas in which [MISC Washington-based  ] agencies and their leaders need to engage , including via the personal contact that visits make possible: -- ( C ) [ORG Finance: Achievement  ] of a closer economic relationship , which [ORG CFK  ] has told us she wants , will not happen without a [ORG Paris Club  ] deal to normalize the [ORG GOA  ] 's debt to official creditors . 
That in turn will require [ORG Treasury  ] 's engagement with [ORG CFK  ] 's capable young Economy Minister [PER Martin Lousteau  ] . 
A [ORG Paris Club  ] deal would be a critical first step towards an economically resurgent [LOC Argentina  ] 's broader reinsertion into global capital markets . 
This , in turn , will lessen [LOC Argentina  ] 's reliance on [LOC Venezuela  ] to help place new [MISC Argentine  ] debt , a reliance that comes with [MISC Bolivarian  ] political and ideological strings attached . 
It could also help [PER Lousteau  ] , who is engaged in an internal tug-of-war with less market-friendly forces on many issues critical to the 500 [LOC U.S.  ] companies doing business here , establish his primacy within the [ORG GOA  ] on economic policy. -- ( C ) [ORG Defense Cooperation: The Ministry  ] of [MISC Defense  ] is more friendly to us now than it has been at any time since [PER MOD Garre  ] took office two years ago . 
The Army chief , who previously kept his distance from the [LOC United States  ] , has reached out to us for contact . 
[LOC Argentina  ] 's [ORG Navy and Air Force  ] are eager to work with us . 
To capitalize on this attitudinal shift , we need high-profile [LOC U.S.  ] military leaders like Southcom Commander [PER Stavridis  ] ( scheduled to visit in May ) to come to [LOC Argentina  ] . 
His visit could help us bring the military relationship to another level , advancing the ball on issues like [MISC Argentine  ] participation in exercises , exchanges , and regional security cooperation . 
Such a visit could also keep [LOC U.S.  ] military suppliers in the race for important contracts like 3-D radars . 
[ORG MOD U/S Forti  ] told the Ambassador last week that he hopes to get MOD [PER Garre  ] to the [LOC United States  ] in the months ahead. -- ( C ) Law Enforcement and [ORG Intelligence: Cooperation  ] in this area was a bright spot in the bilateral relationship , even during the most difficult periods of the first [PER Kirchner  ] administration . 
The worrying freeze in cooperation that took place during the period of estrangement is over , and our cooperation is returning to normal . 
We need senior-level visits , such as the planned trip by Deputy FBI Director Pistole in May , to advance [LOC U.S.  ] interests in intensified counter-terrorism work , and to resume our valuable partnership with the [ORG GOA  ] to bring the [MISC Iranian-sponsored  ] perpetrators of the 1994 [MISC AMIA  ] bombing to justice . 
We also need to get leading [ORG GOA  ] law enforcement officials to the [LOC United States  ] for bilateral consultations. -- ( S ) [MISC Intelligence: Argentine  ] intelligence officials highly value their relationship with [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts , as [ORG PDDNI  ] [PER Kerr  ] 's visit amply demonstrated . 
During a dinner with the [ORG PDDNI  ] February 23 , the [ORG GOA  ] 's Deputy Director of Intelligence recounted with pride that his service has shared high-value information with us and worked closely with us in support of [LOC U.S.  ] goals . 
The [ORG PDDNI  ] 's visit reinforced our superb working relationship with [LOC Argentina  ] 's service ( the [ORG National Intelligence Service  ] -- [ORG SIDE  ] ) , and we need to keep developing it through continued cooperation. -- ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Science and Technology: [ORG CFK  ] has repeatedly cited this as an area where she hopes to expand contact and cooperation with the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Visits by high-level [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG GOA  ] officials to each other 's country on these and other areas will advance our long-term interest in a friendly relationship with a populous , fast-growing country with considerable talent and resources . 
As importantly , such travel advances key [LOC U.S.  ] interests in specific policy areas -- normalization of financial relationships between developing economies and creditors , amicable military-to-military ties , and cooperation on regional counter-terrorism issues -- that matter to our country 's security interests. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Finally , travel by prominent [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOA  ] officials to each other 's countries directly addresses one of the main causes of anti-Americanism here -- the perception that the [ORG USG  ] does not care enough about [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The positive media coverage created by such visits makes [MISC Argentines  ] at all levels of society feel relevant in the world and taken into considerations by our powerful country . 
This cannot help but chip away at this society 's collective animus towards out nation , which stems to a large extent from its collective insecurity about itself . 
Let 's Make It Work ------------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Events over the past two years remind us that relations with the [ORG GOA  ] are not easy . 
Nonetheless , we have a real opportunity to reach a more positive equilibrium in the bilateral relationship . 
In his January 31 meeting with [ORG CFK  ] , the Ambassador deployed Department-cleared talking points that featured the proposal that both sides would demonstrate interest in the relationship by engaging each other , including via visits in each direction . 
As reported in ref A , [ORG CFK  ] agreed , and expressed interest in a steady stream of high-level visits . 
We therefore have a deal in place with the [ORG GOA  ] on travel in both directions . 
The [MISC Argentines  ] need to hold up their end of the bargain . 
Cabinet Chief [PER Fernandez  ] told the Ambassador February 21 that he had identified March 8-12 for travel to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Taiana  ] , [PER MOD Garre  ] , and Economy Minister [PER Lousteau  ] also intend to travel to the [LOC United States  ] soon . 
We should remain committed to our part in this effort , especially after several weeks of positive interaction with the [ORG GOA  ] .
