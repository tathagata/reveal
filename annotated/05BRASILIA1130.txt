( C ) Introduction: Assistant Secretary of State for [ORG Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Stephen  ] [PER G. Rademaker  ] met on 11 April with his [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] counterpart , Ambassador [PER Antonio Guerreiro  ] , Assistant Secretary for [ORG International Organizations  ] ( in the MRE structure this includes [ORG UN  ] and arms control/non-proliferation issues ) . 
[PER Guerreio  ] was accompanied by senior aides from his [ORG UN  ] and arms control divisions , but [PER Guerrerio  ] alone spoke to all of the issues throughout the meeting . 
[PER A/S Rademaker  ] was accompanied by [MISC Arms Control Bureau Senior  ] Advisor [PER Joan Corbett  ] , [ORG WHA/BSC Regional Affairs  ] Officer [PER Carolyn Croft  ] , [ORG AC/NP Special Advisor  ] [PER Carolyn Leddy  ] , [ORG NP Bureau Foreign Affairs  ] Specialist [PER Steve Adams  ] , [ORG DOD/OSD Attorney Advisor Musetta Johnson and Embassy PolCouns  ] . 
[PER A/S Rademaker  ] and [PER Guerreiro  ] discussed goals for the May 2005 [MISC Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  ] , general proliferation issues , and [ORG Article  ] 98 . 
Principal themes are reported below . 
End introduction . 
[LOC U.S.  ] PRESENTATION ON NPT REVCON AND PROLIFERATION ISSUES: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) [PER A/S Rademaker  ] provided [PER Guerreiro  ] with a briefing on [ORG USG  ] views and goals for the 2005 NPT Revcon , and provided slides of the presentation to the [ORG GOB  ] interlocutors . 
[PER A/S Rademaker  ] stressed [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the [ORG NPT  ] , and said the [LOC U.S.  ] views noncompliance as the critical challenge to the treaty at present . 
Indeed , in the [ORG USG  ] view , the treaty is " under siege " as evidence increasingly points to some member states undercutting their treaty obligations by noncompliance with the basic [ORG NPT  ] obligations under [ORG Article II and III  ] , use of [ORG Article IV  ] ( peaceful nuclear cooperation ) as a cover for weapons programs , and ineffective prevention of transfer of weapons technologies to non-state networks . 
In this regard , [PER A/S Rademaker  ] emphasized the importance of a high standard for safeguards among supplier states as a condition of supply , including [LOC Brazil  ] , and urged adoption of the Additional Protocol by [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Similarly , he stressed the importance of broad endorsement of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1540 and encouraged [MISC Brazilian  ] participation in the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Rademaker  ] characterized the situation with [LOC Iran  ] as " very serious " and said the [ORG USG  ] and [MISC Europeans  ] will support referral of the matter to the [ORG UNSC  ] if [LOC Iran  ] breaks with any aspect of the current [ORG IAEA  ] suspension . 
[PER A/S Rademaker  ] provided a detailed presentation of the [ORG USG  ] record on disarmament under [ORG Article VI  ] , noting the May 2001 statement by President [PER Bush  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear posture is that of achieving a credible deterrent with the lowest possible number of nuclear weapons consistent with national security needs , including obligations to allies . 
He outlined [ORG USG  ] positions on stockpile reductions , fissile materials , and cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] , noting that [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Russia  ] for nuclear security efforts , together with aid from G-8 allies , now totals USD 20 billion . 
In response to comments by [PER Guerrerio  ] on new [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear arms programs and the lack of [LOC U.S.  ] adherence to the [MISC CTBT  ] , [PER A/S Rademaker  ] emphasized that the robust nuclear earth penetrator is only a conceptual design study -- there are no active R and D efforts on these systems . 
The [ORG U.S. Senate  ] has not ratified the [MISC CTBT  ] principally because of concerns relating to the verifiability of the treaty . 
For the [LOC United States  ] , it is important to be assured that all other countries have given up nuclear testing if they are to do so , because for all nuclear weapons states it would be useful to retain the right , if a need arises in the future , to test nuclear weapons . 
Nuclear weapons are man-made devices that deteriorate over time like all other man-made devices . 
He also noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] has unilaterally observed a 10 year moratorium on testing and has no testing planned now or in the future . 
[ORG GOB  ] REACTIONS: <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Guerreio  ] provided the following comments in response ( organized below thematically ) : --Brazil , the [ORG AP  ] and [PER Rezende: Echoing  ] statements made at various times over the past several months by FM [MISC Amorim  ] and other [ORG GOB  ] officials , [PER Guerreiro  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] had never said it would not adhere to the [ORG AP  ] , and he " hoped " that [LOC Brazil  ] would sign the protocol this year , although it would be after the May Revcon . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and the [ORG IAEA  ] have also successfully completed their agreement on agency inspections of [LOC Brazil  ] 's Rezende facility , [PER Guerreiro  ] said , although some ongoing technical questions are still being resolved. --Iran: [PER Guerrerio  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] had sternly and repeatedly told [MISC Iranian  ] delegations that [LOC Iran  ] had " messed things up " ( for other non-weapons nuclear states ) and that [LOC Iran  ] must cooperate fully with [ORG IAEA  ] , since non-weapons states must have impeccable credentials under all articles of the treaty in order to challenge weapons states on disarmament issues . 
He added that the statutes of the [ORG IAEA  ] required that the [ORG Board of Governors refer Iran  ] 's case to the [ORG UNSC  ] if the agency exhausts all of its authorities and resources but achieves no resolution with [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] understands the [ORG UNSC  ] would then have to " live up to its obligations . 
" [PER Guerreiro  ] and [PER A/S Rademaker  ] agreed on the necessity of taking a " graduated approach " -- i.e. , not starting immediately with sanctions -- in the event [LOC Iran  ] is referred to the council. --NPT Revcon: Noting that [MISC Brazilian  ] Revcon President [PER Duarte  ] has " a tough job ahead of him , " [PER Guerreiro  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] thinks there should be a strong effort at an agreed agenda at the meeting 's outset , and will seek [ORG USG  ] cooperation in this effort . 
He also noted [ORG GOB  ] agreement with an emphasis on compliance but said the Revcon should aim at producing a " balanced agreement " that addresses all pillars of the treaty ( i.e. , disarmament as well as nonproliferation ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will not oppose consecration of adherence to the Additional Protocol as a condition of supply , " but that cannot be the only proposal , " he said . 
Discussion of regional issues will be important during the conference , and it is " unavoidable " that [LOC Israel  ] will come up in the [LOC Middle East-Iran  ] context , [PER Guerreiro  ] opined . 
In other potential problem areas , [PER Guerreiro  ] saw little prospect for a robust agreement on restrictions on enrichment and processing technologies . 
[PER Guerreiro  ] expected the [ORG Revcon  ] would endorse [ORG UNSCR  ] 1540 as " a good step " in stemming technology flows to non-state actors. --Proliferation: While agreeing that compliance is a major challenge for the [ORG NPT  ] , [PER Guerreiro  ] did not agree with the statement that the treaty is " under siege " -- rather he posited rather that the [ORG NPT  ] has been a success , witness the fact that the number of weapons states is still fairly small , despite the worried predictions of [PER John F. Kennedy  ] and others that as many as thirty countries would some day have nuclear arms . 
However , on a related point , [PER Guerreiro  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] believes it is critical that the [ORG NPT  ] Revcon not inadvertently give recognized weapons state status to non-treaty-party countries with declared or suspected arms programs . 
This is " a highly sensitive issue " for [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] and other countries that have voluntarily renounced nuclear weapons programs only to see others who have flouted non-proliferation principles achieve de facto status ( bordering on acceptance ) as military nuclear powers. --PSI: [PER Guerrerio  ] called the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] a " fair exercise , " but not one that [LOC Brazil  ] had studied in depth or considered joining until now . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] will send a military observer to an upcoming [ORG PSI  ] exercise in [LOC Portugal  ] , and may then look more carefully at the possibility of participation . 
[ORG ARTICLE  ] 98: 5 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Rademaker  ] outlined [ORG USG  ] motives for seeking [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements to provide protection for [MISC American  ] citizens from extradition to face trial at the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] . 
He explained how [LOC U.S.  ] national experience with independent prosecutors had left negative views in [MISC American  ] society about unaccountable prosecutors with broad mandates , and related fears that [MISC Americans  ] -- given the [LOC U.S.  ] leadership role in international affairs -- could be frequent targets for specious and politically-driven indictments . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] wants to find a way to be a " good neighbor " to the [ORG ICC  ] , perhaps in time able to offer some degree support that approximates the critical legal , technical and investigative assistance offered by the [ORG USG  ] to the [ORG ICTY  ] and [ORG ICTR  ] over the years . 
But that can only come about if the [LOC U.S.  ] has a " comfort level " with the direction and activities undertaken by the court , and if [LOC U.S.  ] personnel are protected by [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements with a wide range of states. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Guerreiro  ] politely but unequivocally stated that [LOC Brazil  ] would not sign an [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and views the idea as a " non-starter . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] is a strong supporter of the [ORG ICC  ] and believes the necessary checks and balances are in place to deter the kinds of concerns outlined by [PER A/S Rademaker  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] remains convinced that it is better to have a permanent criminal court than ad hoc tribunals . 
Noting the abstention by [LOC Brazil  ] on 31 March on the [ORG UN  ] resolution that indicated the [ORG ICC  ] for accountability and investigations into the [LOC Sudan-Darfur  ] atrocity allegations , but with special protections carved out at [LOC U.S.  ] insistence , [PER Guerreiro  ] said FM [MISC Amorim  ] himself had issued instructions for abstention and considered a resolution with special protections from [ORG ICC  ] authorities to be a " dangerous precedent . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[PER A/S Rademaker  ] 's visit provided a valuable opportunity to consult at a senior level with the [ORG GOB  ] on a wide range of issues . 
[PER Guerreiro  ] 's comments on likely [MISC Brazilian  ] adherence to the Additional Protocol this year and support for the [ORG AP  ] as a condition of supply at the May Revcon are encouraging . 
Less promising was [PER Guerreiro  ] 's categorical rejection of discussing an [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] 8 . 
( U ) The Assistant Secretary cleared this cable .
