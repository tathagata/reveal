( C ) SUMMARY: Three recent attacks in [LOC Chile  ] 's [LOC Araucania  ] region , the heart of indigenous [MISC Mapuche  ] territory , have riveted attention once again on continuing disputes between indigenous groups and the state in southern [LOC Chile  ] . 
The [ORG Coordinadora Arauco Malleco  ] ( [ORG CAM  ] ) , a violent [MISC Mapuche  ] group with a history of conducting attacks , claimed responsibility for recent incidents against trucks , toll plazas and the police . 
The [ORG GOC  ] claims that small criminal groups are responsible for the violence and multiple [ORG GOC  ] Ministers have explained that the recent attacks are not connected to larger indigenous issues . 
While some believe that the election cycle is exacerbating the conflict , the violence has yet to emerge as a hot button topic in the Presidential campaign and President [PER Bachelet  ] 's approval rating remains at a record high level . 
END SUMMARY . 
Violence Continues in the Heart of [LOC Mapuche Territory  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The low level conflict in [LOC Chile  ] 's [LOC Araucania  ] region , the heart of indigenous [MISC Mapuche  ] territory , continues to flare , with several violent attacks in October . 
The most recent clash took place on October 20 when a group of seven hooded individuals seized two trucks , released the drivers , burned the trucks and exchanged gunfire with members of the [LOC Carabineros  ] , [LOC Chile  ] 's uniformed police . 
There are unconfirmed reports that one of the individuals was wounded but in hiding . 
A local radio station identified the individual as a 17-year-old youth who was reportedly not involved in the attack but hunting in the area when hit by police gunfire . 
Other notable events include an October 12 attack on a toll plaza and an October 18 shooting that left two members of [LOC Chile  ] 's investigative police injured . 
The October violence comes on the heels of clashes earlier in the year that included the August 12 death of a [MISC Mapuche  ] activist , the second fatality in the last two years ( Ref A ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [ORG Coordinadora Arauco Malleco  ] ( [ORG CAM  ] ) , a violent group with a history of conducting attacks , took responsibility for the recent violence in an email message to media outlets on October 20 . 
The [ORG CAM  ] also declared war on the Government of [LOC Chile  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) and its members renounced their [MISC Chilean  ] citizenship . 
[ORG GOC: Police Resources  ] are Sufficient , [ORG Small Groups of Criminals  ] are Responsible --------------------------------------------- ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Interior Minister [PER Perez Yoma  ] and Secretary General of the Presidency [PER Jose Viera-Gallo  ] convened a meeting of top regional officials on October 22 to assess law enforcement efforts . 
That meeting took place after [PER Javiera Blanco  ] , Undersecretary of the [LOC Carabineros  ] , rejected hints from the Public Prosecutors' office that more police forces were needed in the region . 
[PER Carlos Fernandez  ] from the [ORG National Intelligence Agency  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] October 21 that officials have an idea of who is behind the attacks and hinted that arrests are forthcoming. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOC  ] has tried to separate the recent attacks from the larger issue of indigenous relations . 
[PER Viera-Gallo  ] , who was named coordinator for [ORG Indigenous Affairs  ] on August 26 , stated that small criminal groups are responsible the violence . 
Undersecretary of Interior [PER Patricio Rosende  ] said the attacks have " nothing to do " with [MISC Mapuche  ] claims . 
Nevertheless , the [ORG GOC  ] invoked a controversial anti-terrorism law to prosecute four [MISC Mapuche  ] individuals who were allegedly involved in the toll plaza attack . 
The [MISC Pinochet-era  ] law includes stiffer penalties and restricts the civil liberties of the accused during investigation and prosecution . 
Many human rights activists and international observers say that the government 's use of the law unfairly targets the [MISC Mapuche  ] ( Ref A ) . 
" This isn't the Capital of [LOC Afghanistan  ] " --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOC  ] has also come under increased criticism from business leaders in the region . 
The [ORG National Agricultural Society  ] recently suggested that the rule of law must be re-established in the region before the [ORG GOC  ] pursues development programs that include land buy-back programs for indigenous communities . 
[PER Viera-Gallo  ] flatly rejected the idea that the region is out of control , stating that the [MISC Arauco  ] province " isn't the capital of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" He also chastised government critics for " doing a favor " for the criminals by exaggerating their capabilities . 
( Ref B describes how this conflict has frequently been sensationalized . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Interestingly , the recent violence has not yet emerged as a hot button issue in the upcoming presidential election . 
The three main candidates have discussed issues such as crime and citizen security , but there has not been a focus on the violence in the [LOC Araucania  ] region or indigenous issues . 
The violence has also had no impact on President [PER Bachelet  ] 's approval ratings , which remain at record-high levels . 
However , some observers believe that the elections are contributing to the recent uptick in violence , with the [ORG Concertacion  ] government eager to show voters that it is taking the problem seriously , and [MISC Mapuche  ] activists hoping to pressure the government into concessions before December 's voting. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT: Despite  ] the most recent outbreaks of violence , [PER Viera-Gallo  ] is correct to assert that the rule of law remains intact in the region . 
While worrying and illegal , the attacks are sporadic and clearly target property rather than people . 
The [ORG GOC  ] claim that these attacks are perpetrated by small , criminal groups may very well be accurate , but that description increases public perception that the police should be able to identify and arrest those responsible for the attacks . 
If the violence continues , the issue will remain a thorn in the side of the [PER Bachelet  ] administration - and perhaps its successor . 
END COMMENT .
