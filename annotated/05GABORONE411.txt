( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] visited Botswana’s western town of [LOC Ghanzi  ] and the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] relocation settlement of [LOC New Xade  ] on March 10-11 . 
Rural poverty , severe dependence on government assistance , lack of income-generating opportunities , despair among youth , and the underperformance of the parastatal [ORG Botswana Meat Commission  ] ( [ORG BMC  ] ) were identified by interlocutors as dominant issues in the district . 
Officials proclaimed the advantages of the relocation of the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] out of the [ORG Central Kalahari Game Reserve  ] into villages . 
[ORG NGOs  ] emphasized the forcible aspect of the exercise and the psychological trauma and cultural disorientation it had produced . 
The [ORG GOB  ] , as revealed in a subsequent meeting with the [ORG MFA PermSec  ] , views the San as a group which , like other ethnic minorities in [LOC Botswana  ] , should use education to move forward . 
End summary . 
Into the [LOC Frontier Zone: Ghanzi District  ] --------------------------------------- 2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) It is a truism that practically all of southern [LOC Africa  ] is a frontier . 
Botswana’s [LOC Ghanzi District  ] is vintage: containing the vast [ORG Central Kalahari Game Reserve  ] ( [ORG CKGR  ] ) where the mode of hunting and gathering still provides a livelihood for remnants of various Khoi/San-speaking groups , however diminished . 
[LOC BaKgalagadi  ] peoples , herders and agriculturalists , live there , as do Herero-speakers , refugees from the 1905 war of extermination in then-German [LOC Southwest Africa  ] . 
Afrikaans-speaking groups , with expertise in ranching , moved in around 1900 , taking advantage of Ghanzi’s rangelands and its hydrogeology , where vast aquifers can be tapped at shallow depth under limestone ridges. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Ghanzi District’s  ] major source of income is the sale of cattle to the parastatal [ORG Botswana Meat Commission  ] , located in [LOC Lobatse  ] , some 600 miles to the southeast . 
Transport has become more efficient in the past few years , with the excellently paved [ORG Trans Kalahari Highway  ] running between [LOC Lobatse  ] and [LOC Ghanzi  ] , and on into [LOC Namibia  ] . 
[LOC Ghanzi  ] town has grown over the past five years , and district officials mentioned the scarcity of urban plots and available land in the immediate area of town . 
[LOC Ghanzi  ] town , as district capital , has government offices , staff housing , and facilities , as well as the requisite hospital and schools . 
Apart from that , it functions as the service center for the outlying ranches and their population . 
No industry is located there . 
Problems , Problems: Any Opportunities ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] and [ORG EmbOffs  ] met with district officials over lunch in [LOC Ghanzi  ] on March 10 . 
Predictably , conversation turned to a list of perceived problems . 
One was the low prices the [ORG Botswana Meat Commission  ] ( [ORG BMC  ] ) pays for slaughtered cattle . 
Many considered that the time had come to end the [ORG BMC  ] monopoly and open the trade to competition . 
Various officials lamented the lack of jobs for young people and stated alcohol abuse was a major problem . 
Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] noted that the [ORG Trans Kalahari Highway  ] running up to [LOC Ghanzi  ] should provide an economic stimulus , and urged the district planners to poise themselves to take advantage of this , but the response was low-key . 
The Remote [PER Area Dwellers  ] ( RAD ) program officer complained that the services provided by the [ORG GOB  ] were not fully appreciated by “these people.” How are you going to keep them on the farm ? ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) After lunch , Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] visited a training site just outside of town , run by the [ORG NGO XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , which is actively engaged in several villages bordering the [ORG Central Kalahari Game Reserve  ] ( [ORG CKGR  ] ) to assist the population in making the transition from hunting and gathering easier for those in the relocation villages . 
They have begun communal gardens , and they have a demonstration vegetable garden at the training site that utilizes drip irrigation , installed with a grant from the [ORG Ambassador’s Self-Help Fund  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was highly critical of the [ORG GOB  ] resettlement policy , noting that people had been dumped in villages like [LOC New Xade  ] , without being provided with sufficient shelter , support , or even food , and decried the idea as ludicrous that the people could transform themselves into industrious villagers , craft-sellers , while seventy miles away from a main road . 
They emphasized the arbitrariness , the lack of consultation , and the lack of transparency in [ORG GOB  ] decision-making when it came to the treatment of the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] peoples in the district . 
A Recipe for Discontent: Discrimination , not Dialogue --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador [PER Huggins’ XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] meeting , with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] proved informative . 
At present , the [ORG Botswana High Court  ] case brought in July 2004 by the [ORG First People of the Kalahari  ] v. [ORG GOB  ] , is in recess.XXXXXXXXXXXX considered “eviction” as a more accurate description of what took place than the [ORG GOB  ] usage: “relocation.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed that plans for mining were the reason that the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] groups were removed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that [ORG First People of the Kalahari  ] accepted the support of [ORG Survival International  ] , the [MISC London-based  ] [ORG NGOXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] had consistently declined to enter into dialogue on the question of the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] and their right of access to the [ORG CKGR  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were mystified why the relocation took place . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] will point to large schools and shiny new buildings in the relocation villages as tokens of their benevolent intent , but , he asked , “Where are the [MISC Basarwa  ] professionals that the educational system is supposed to be turning out ? ” Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] asked what alternative there would be in XXXXXXXXXXXX’s view , and he mentioned that ecotourism , involving the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] themselves , would be an option . 
Gradually , the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] would then successfully be integrated into mainstream society . 
At present , he stated , people’s rights were being violated , and they had been torn away from familiar foods , medicinal plants , environment , and religious ties with the land . 
The consequence was death in some cases , and enormous suffering in other cases . 
People mourned that they could not pass on their culture to their children. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] asked how many persons had been removed from the [ORG CKGR  ] , and how many had returned . 
In all [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] estimated some 2,500 had been evicted ; some 250 persons , mostly older [LOC San/Basarwa  ] , were still in the [ORG CKGR  ] , and perhaps another 250 had returned over the past two years from the relocation villages . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that [PER San/Basarwa  ] are systematically being discriminated against by the [ORG GOB  ] , which moves them away from wherever there might be an income-generating opportunity. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) He cited the case of the [LOC Tsodilo Hills  ] , renowned for its rock paintings , where [PER San/Basarwa  ] were moved five miles away , with the consequence that Hambukushu people now served as guides and craft sellers there . 
He cited the [LOC Janatarka  ] area in [LOC Central District  ] , where [PER San/Basarwa  ] were being forced to move , as well as the [PER Trans-Frontier Park  ] , between [LOC Botswana  ] and [LOC Namibia  ] , where [LOC San/Basarwa  ] interests were sidelined. “The land use system of the San is simply not recognized by the government , ” he said , “and the government is unwilling to enter into any discussion on this or other matters having to do with the [ORG San/Basarwa.” Prospects  ] for [ORG Unity:  ] the view from the [ORG BNF  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) In a meeting with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the major constraint to [ORG BNF  ] gains was identified as lack of financing . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was clear , and contemptuous: the way to win votes in [LOC San/Basarwa  ] areas was through tobacco , food , and clothes. “They believe only in hand- outs , ” he said . 
When asked about prospects for 2009 , and cooperation between the opposition parties , the [ORG BNF  ] and the [ORG Botswana Congress Party  ] ( [ORG BCP  ] ) , XXXXXXXXXXXX’s first reaction was , “The [ORG BCP  ] has learned its lesson ; they will come to us.” <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Emboffs  ] pointed out that such a stance might not be the most diplomatic , and he agreed , saying it would be worked out at national level . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] gave the [ORG BDP  ] government credit for its approach to the [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] scourge and would not change it if the [ORG BNF  ] came to power . 
They passionately disagreed , however , with the [ORG BDP  ] silence on [MISC Zimbabwe’s  ] crisis and expressed their frustration with the national and regional paralysis on this issue . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] They identified the lack of jobs and recreation for young people as major problems , because the alternative , they said , was alcohol consumption and subsequent unprotected sex leading to [MISC HIV  ] infections . 
[ORG HIV/AIDS: Some Progress  ] ------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] stopped at [ORG Tebelopele Voluntary Counseling and Testing Center  ] , where director and counselors stated that testing had increased from an average of 60 persons per month last year to over 300 per month this year . 
For this , the director credited the effective rollout of ARV therapy . 
At dinner with [ORG Peace Corps  ] volunteers that evening , the Ambassador expressed his appreciation for their path- breaking work in combating [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] in the district through community organization and awareness-raising . 
On their part , the [ORG Peace Corps Volunteers  ] related some success stories but also noted the often inflexible and anti-innovative nature of the [LOC Botswana  ] bureaucratic structures with which they have to work . 
Modernizing , Collaborating . 
. . ------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Early the next morning , Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] and [ORG EmbOffs  ] visited the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] resettlement village of [LOC New Xade  ] , established in 2002 , located on the edge of the [ORG CKGR  ] , seventy miles away on a sand and gravel road away from the [ORG Trans Kalahari Highway  ] , without telephone service . 
[ORG Permaculture Trust  ] extension workers had ensured communication . 
We were escorted by the District Commissioner and the [ORG RAD  ] officer . 
The latter pointed proudly to some livestock as we neared the village: the [ORG GOB  ] had provided these to the [LOC Basarwa.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The village chief , [PER Kgosi Lobatse Beslag  ] , greeted [ORG Emboffs  ] . 
The [ORG Village Development Committee  ] , councilors , District Commissioner and the [ORG RAD  ] official joined our meeting held in the chief’s office . 
The discussion took place in [LOC Setswana  ] and was translated . 
A verbal list of concerns was recited: the first item mentioned was that [LOC New Xade  ] has insufficient accommodation for civil servants . 
A storehouse for the vegetables grown on the [ORG Permaculture  ] garden was required , as were recreational facilities for youth. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] asked how people were faring after the relocation . 
The answer provided by the chief was that they were much better off . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who took the lead in the discussion , echoed this opinion , but he also asked for support for training and buildings . 
But people were much better off , in his opinion , living in New Xade. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Despite rephrasing of the question-whether people really wanted to be in [MISC New Xade-the  ] standard response , no doubt also influenced by the presence of the district officials , was that everything was fine . 
When we asked about ecotourism , we were told that a plot had been allocated for such a venture , but [ORG GOB  ] funds had run out to translate it into reality . 
When we asked about plans for telephony , we were told that connectivity by telephone was in the village development plan , but much depended on the government , and it might and might not happen in 2007 and 2008 . 
When we asked how people make a living , there was some evasion , but eventually the answers indicated that people rely on government handouts . 
It became clear that everything , more or less , depended on the government . 
When asked about craft skills and income- generation , we were told that the distance and the lack of linkages for marketing were major hurdles . 
. . .and Resisting ------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Only at the end of the meeting , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ventured to answer the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] question: people are not happy . 
While many people were resigned to the relocation by now , many also went back to the [ORG CKGR  ] . 
People mourn for their way of life , and regret that their children are not with them , but at school . 
Another grievance was that the Game and [ORG Wildlife Department  ] prohibits [LOC New Xade  ] residents who want to visit their relatives on the other side of the [ORG CKGR  ] from traveling through the reserve ; they have to go around . 
And only some , not all , received livestock. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Kgosi Beslag  ] decided , at that point , that the discussion had been sufficiently extensive . 
When the Ambassador asked about a solution , the chief reiterated the [ORG GOB  ] line: put [LOC San/Basarwa  ] children in hostels for their education and their own good , and bank on the next generation . 
In any case , he continued , hunting and gathering was a miserable and doomed way of life . 
You cannot stop progress . 
He suggested we visit the new village clinic next . 
[LOC Potemkin Village  ] ? ----------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [LOC New Xade  ] clinic is an impressive building , dating from 2003 . 
With a staff of 3 , with a senior nurse-matron who arrived two months ago , the facility has beds , drugs , and supplies , but , at 10:00 in the morning looked eerily unused . 
We were told patients preferred to still go to the old clinic . 
Beds without linen attested to the truth of this . 
We next viewed two of the houses built by [ORG Permaculture Trust:  ] one-room cinderblocks , on a plot large enough to cultivate a vegetable garden , looking comfortable . 
We were told who lived in one house ; when we asked who lived in the adjacent one , we were told , “Oh , he has gone back to the [MISC CKGR.” Our  ] tour concluded with Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] greeting the assembled villagers in the central meeting place , and so we departed New Xade. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] is not likely to change its position on the [ORG CKGR  ] . 
In a subsequent meeting between Ambassador [PER Huggins  ] and the [ORG GOB’s Permanent Secretary  ] in the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG International Cooperation  ] , Mr. [PER Ernest Mpofu  ] , the Ambassador related his impressions gained during his visit to [LOC Ghanzi District  ] . 
He made the point that dialogue is the way forward , and the situation of the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] should be reconsidered . 
The [MISC PermSec  ] dismissed all such suggestions and was averse to the argument that the people are losing their culture . 
He viewed the plight of the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] as no different from other ethnic minorities in the country , and he put forward again the [ORG GOB  ] assimilationist line.XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
He advised the Ambassador to discuss the question with relevant [ORG GOB  ] ministry officials and hear the “true” version of events . 
He stated that [LOC New Xade  ] as a location was chosen by the [LOC San/Basarwa  ] themselves , attracted there by the [MISC GOB’s  ] provision of water . 
Ambassador Huggins’s suggestions that the [ORG GOB  ] reconsider its approach to how government deals with [LOC San/Basarwa  ] and the issue of their cultural heritage was met with thinly veiled scorn. “We were like that ourselves , ” said Mr. [PER Mpofu  ] , “when I was young ; running after animals . 
But I sit here , talking to you , in your language , because I received an education.” Comment ------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) This was a long-planned visit to the west of the country , with prime objective being to gain first- hand impressions of the results of the [MISC GOB’s  ] policy of [LOC San/Basarwa  ] populations out of the [LOC Central Kalahari Game Reserve  ] during 2002/3 . 
While it is probably the case that two-three years on since the move , the greatest trauma is past , it is also clear that people have been dumped in economically absolutely unviable situations without forethought , and without follow-up support . 
The lack of imagination displayed on the part of the [ORG GOB  ] is breathtaking . 
The [ORG GOB  ] views [LOC New Xade  ] as similar to many sites of rural poverty , deserving no special treatment . 
But the special tragedy of [MISC New Xade’s  ] dependent population is that it could have been avoided .
