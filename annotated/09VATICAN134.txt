Dialogues with [ORG Muslim Communities and Nations  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Formal , modern-day [MISC Vatican  ] dialogue with the [MISC Muslim  ] world goes back for over a decade . 
It intensified following September 11 , 2001 , and again after the controversy that erupted over [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] 's September 2006 address in [LOC Regensberg  ] .

) [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000134 002.2 OF 003 Other Avenues for [ORG Catholic-Muslim Encounters  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Holy See  ] and the [ORG Arab League  ] established diplomatic relations in 2000 . 
The [ORG League  ] has a representative to the [LOC Holy See  ] based in [LOC Rome  ] , and the [LOC Vatican  ] 's representative to the [ORG League  ] is the nuncio in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] and the [ORG League  ] signed a Memorandum of Understanding on April 23 , 2009 , to strengthen joint projects to promote peace and dialogue , especially on the political and cultural levels . 
The Memorandum was signed by Archbishop [PER Dominique Mamberti  ] , the [LOC Holy See  ] 's Secretary of Relations with [MISC States  ] , and [ORG Arab League  ] Secretary General [PER Amr Moussa  ] . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials note that the [ORG MOU  ] has not yet led to any concrete initiatives or dialogues. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue  ] signed a " Declaration of Intent " with the [ORG Department for Religious Affairs of the  ] [MISC Turkish  ] Prime Minister 's Cabinet on April 25 , 2002 . 
Its aim was to promote inter-religious dialogue , in particular by facilitating collaboration between academic institutions . 
Progress in discussions with the [LOC Turks  ] is not coming quickly . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] is disappointed that the former Church of [LOC Paul  ] of [LOC Tarsus  ] is now a [MISC Turkish  ] government-run museum . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] also supports Orthodox demands to reopen the [MISC Halki  ] seminary in [LOC Turkey  ] , have the GOT recognize the [ORG Ecumenical Patriarch  ] as an international religious leader , and grant greater religious freedoms to Orthodox and other [MISC Christians.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Cardinal [PER Jean-Louis Tauran  ] , President of the [ORG Inter-Religious Dialogue Council  ] , travelled to [LOC Indonesia  ] in November 2009 . 
It was the first visit of the [LOC Vatican  ] 's top dialogue official to [LOC Indonesia  ] , the largest Muslim-majority country in the world -- 206 million out of a population of 240 million . 
( There are 7 million [MISC Catholics  ] in the country . 
) [LOC Vatican  ] and [MISC Indonesian  ] officials continue to discuss concrete initiatives for follow-up to this visit . 
The Other Monotheistic Faiths: [MISC Jews  ] and other [MISC Christians  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unlike relations with [MISC Islam  ] , [LOC Vatican  ] relations with [MISC Jews  ] are characterized by substantial theological common ground and historic roots . 
Discussions between the two religions are ongoing and broad-based . 
They are often intersected by politics , and sometimes hurt by missteps . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] 's long-standing dialogue initiatives with the [MISC Jews  ] prospered in the years since the [ORG Vatican II Council  ] removed obstacles to good relations . 
They took a big hit in January 2009 , however , when the [LOC Vatican  ] restored communion to a schismatic [MISC Catholic  ] group that included a [MISC Holocaust-denying  ] bishop . 
After considerable effort by the [LOC Vatican  ] and the [PER Pope  ] himself , relations have been largely mended and were solidified with the [PER Pope  ] 's visit to the [LOC Holy Land  ] in May 2009 . 
Nevertheless , the proposed conferral of sainthood on [MISC WWII-era  ] [PER Pope Pius  ] XII and access by historians to the archives of his pontificate are recurring irritants in the relationship ( ref D ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , [LOC Vatican  ] officials speak constantly with followers of other [MISC Christian  ] faiths in ecumenical dialogue intended to overcome divisions between [MISC Christians  ] . 
Indeed , the [LOC Vatican  ] has a separate [ORG Pontifical Council  ] for [ORG Christian Unity  ] ( which for historical reasons also covers dialogue with [MISC Jews  ] ) . 
These discussions have their ups and downs . 
While the [LOC Vatican  ] move in November 2009 to welcome disaffected [MISC Anglicans  ] to the [MISC Catholic  ] Church dealt a blow to ecumenical understanding ( ref E ) , the rift is healing in part because few [MISC Anglicans  ] will probably take advantage of the [LOC Vatican  ] offer . 
Meanwhile , relations with the [MISC Russian  ] Orthodox Patriarch of [LOC Moscow  ] -- who commands the allegiance of a large number of Orthodox and is thus arguably more influential than [ORG Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew  ] -- have improved . 
( ref F ) . 
This has allowed [LOC Moscow  ] and the [LOC Vatican  ] to upgrade their " special character " to " full diplomatic " relations ( ref G ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ultimately , the monotheistic nature and shared historic roots of [MISC Judaism  ] , Christianity , and [MISC Islam  ] -- all " people of the book " - make dialogue between these three religions easier for the [LOC Vatican  ] in some ways than discussions with other religions . 
An important interfaith meeting including senior leaders of the world 's major monotheistic religions , [MISC Christians  ] ( [MISC Catholic  ] and [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000134 003.2 OF 003 Orthodox ) , [MISC Jews  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] , took place in [LOC Seville  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , December 6-8 , 2009 . 
The King of [LOC Spain  ] 's " Three [MISC Cultures  ] , Three Faiths " Foundation sponsored the event . 
( [LOC VATICAN  ] 124 ) . 
Outreach to [MISC Asian  ] Faiths ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite the difficulty for the [LOC Vatican  ] of finding common ground with polytheistic religions , [LOC Holy See  ] officials are starting to do just that in an effort to support peace , religious freedom , human rights , and local solutions to local problems ( see septel ) . 
Cardinal [PER Tauran  ] travelled to [LOC India  ] in June 2009 for initial dialogue with [MISC Hindus  ] . 
[PER Tauran  ] 's goal was to go beyond the positive assurances that had characterized previous meetings with [MISC Hindu  ] leaders . 
Specifically , he sought to bridge the gap between his [MISC Indian  ] interlocutors' stated goodwill and the continuing hostility toward [MISC Christians  ] in parts of [LOC India  ] like [LOC Orissa  ] , especially by some [MISC Hindu  ] nationalists . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] also raised concerns about [MISC Indian  ] anti-conversion laws -- although they have not been enforced . 
Cardinal [PER Tauran  ] also traveled to [LOC Japan  ] in August 2009 , to initiate discussions with [MISC Buddhists  ] and other [MISC Asian  ] faiths. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Tauran  ] acknowledges quietly that the [LOC Vatican  ] has not paid sufficient attention to relations with [MISC Asian  ] religions . 
He is not an expert on polytheistic religions and is unlikely to find -- or even seek -- common theological ground with their precepts . 
Instead , as he and his Council increase their outreach to these communities , they will challenge their interlocutors to remove obstacles to the enjoyment of religious freedom for all . 
End comment . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The number and scope of the [LOC Vatican  ] 's inter-religious dialogues is unparalleled by that of any other church or organization in the world . 
The dialogues are already effective in preventing or smoothing over misunderstandings and tensions . 
The big question is how to translate into concrete actions the high moral principles that the world 's major religions bring to the dialogue table . 
Septel includes proposals for USG engagement with the [LOC Vatican  ] in support of interreligious understanding and action .
