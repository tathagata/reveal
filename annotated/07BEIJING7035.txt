Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Although the [ORG Communist Party  ] employed a more sophisticated media strategy during the 17th [ORG Communist Party Congress  ] October 15-21 , local contacts tell us they were disappointed with the [ORG Party 's  ] tight regulation of domestic coverage while the [ORG Congress  ] was in session . 
Press controls inside [LOC China  ] were at least as severe , if not slightly more so , than during the [ORG 16th Party Congress  ] in 2002 . 
Although reporters this time were treated to more press conferences and granted greater access to meetings and delegates , journalists were given very little of substance to report . 
Caijing , a magazine known for cutting edge reporting , was denied press credentials altogether , according to one contact . 
Some sources tell us , however , that the [ORG Party leadership  ] believes the improved treatment of foreign journalists resulted in more positive international coverage of the [ORG Congress  ] . 
End summary . 
Access Versus Substance ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In the lead up to the 17th [ORG Communist Party Congress  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] official media trumpeted the unprecedented number of journalists , both foreign and domestic , who had received credentials to cover the event . 
Altogether , according to a [ORG Xinhua News Agency  ] report , the [ORG Party accredited  ] 807 domestic and 1,135 foreign reporters , compared with 570 domestic and 840 foreign journalists for the [ORG 16th Party Congress  ] in <a id='par2002' href='#par2002'>¶</a>2002 . 
[ORG Xinhua  ] also boasted about the greater number of press conferences that took place on the margins of the [ORG Congress  ] and the expanded ability of journalists to observe meetings and interview delegates . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Local journalists generally agreed that while [ORG Party  ] propaganda officials went through the motions of media openness , they offered reporters very little of substance . 
The " unprecedented " access to delegates , several contacts told us , amounted to little more than listening to a wider array of [ORG Party leaders  ] robotically praise General Secretary [PER Hu Jintao  ] 's political report . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG Poloff XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that even though domestic journalists were granted entree to more meetings than at [ORG previous Party  ] Congresses , the reporting they were actually allowed to print was so restricted that the greater access did not result in better coverage . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) told [PER Poloff XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he had originally wanted to skip covering the 17th [ORG Party Congress  ] altogether . 
Domestic reporting of the [ORG Congress  ] was " meaningless , " [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX Press Controls  ] at Least As Tight As 2002 ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that controls on domestic coverage of the 17th [ORG Party Congress  ] were at least as tight , if not more so , than they were during the [ORG 16th Party Congress  ] in 2002 . 
The extent of these restrictions can be seen , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , in the nearly identical front pages [MISC Chinese  ] newspapers printed October 23 , the day after the [ORG Party  ] unveiled the new nine-member [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] ( [ORG PBSC  ] ) . 
Nearly every [MISC Chinese  ] paper , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed , ran " [PER Hu Jintao  ] Elected General [LOC BEIJING  ] 00007035 002 OF 003 Secretary " as the top headline . 
The [ORG Southern SIPDIS Metropolis News  ] ( [PER Nanfang Dushi Bao  ] ) was the only paper to push these limits by inserting some actual news into its October 23 headline: " Still Nine [ORG Standing Committee  ] Members , Four Are New . 
" Had [MISC Chinese  ] journalists been allowed to report the unveiling of the new [ORG PBSC  ] as a real news event , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , then the headlines would have been about the promotion of [PER Xi Jinping  ] and [PER Li Keqiang  ] directly to the [ORG PBSC  ] thus bypassing the regular [ORG Politburo  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While several media contacts have said that press credentials for this latest [ORG Congress  ] were easier to obtain than in the past ( Ref A ) , at least one independent-minded publication was left in the cold.XXXXXXXXXXXX [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] No Tears On [ORG CCTV  ] ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] 's domestic media took to heart Party guidance that news coverage remain upbeat and that negative stories should be avoided ( Ref A ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER Poloff  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that some media outlets took these directives against negative news to extremes . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said his friends at [LOC China  ] Central Television ( [ORG CCTV  ] ) told him that station managers had banned all " negative " images from the screen . 
During the [ORG Congress  ] , [ORG CCTV  ] would not show images of people crying , regardless of the circumstances . 
Even nature shows depicting animals stalking and killing prey were cut because such scenes were considered " inharmonious , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
[ORG Party Happy With International Coverage  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Some contacts , however , said that the [ORG Party Congress  ] media strategy of keeping journalists busy with press conferences and junkets ( propaganda officials took foreign journalists to visit the newly constructed [ORG National Grand Theater  ] as well as [MISC Olympic  ] sites ) was effective in terms of managing international coverage . 
[ORG Communist Party  ] leaders , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , are generally pleased with the international coverage of the [ORG Congress  ] . 
Overall the international press was more positive than it was during 16th [ORG Party Congress  ] in 2002 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented , with more focus on individual leaders and less on factional infighting . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he gives the [ORG Party Congress Media Center  ] a grade of " 90 percent " for its management of the international press . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that international reporting was more to the [ORG Party 's  ] liking than in 2002 . 
While reporters for the [ORG Associated Press  ] might have been upset with the lack of substance , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , reporters from the developing world were generally pleased with the cushy treatment they received . 
[ORG Internet Controls  ] and [ORG Baidu  ] Hijacking ------------------------------------- [LOC BEIJING  ] 00007035 003 OF 003 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Contacts were nearly unanimous in their assessment that [MISC Internet  ] controls were extremely tigt during the [ORG Congress  ] . 
Popular websites scrubed their chat rooms of even the most mildly negative or sarcastic postings , several of our interlocutors told us . 
Numerous foreign media outlets reported that on October 18 [MISC Chinese  ] Internet users conducting searches using [ORG Yahoo  ] and [ORG Google  ] were redirected to the [MISC Chinese  ] search engine [ORG Baidu  ] ( Ref B ) . 
While many [MISC Beijing-based  ] contacts had not heard of these reports , Emboffs experienced this hijacking phenomenon first hand both in [LOC Beijing  ] and in [LOC Chengdu  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) told [PER Poloff  ] on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that certain [ORG Google  ] searches had indeed been rerouted . 
For example , typing in " [PER Dalai Lama  ] " would get you immediately rerouted to [ORG Baidu  ] , with a message that " there is no information on your request . 
" Most searches on [ORG Google  ] , however , were not interfered with , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER Poloff  ] that [ORG Baidu  ] has a bad reputation among journalists because of its alleged kowtowing to [MISC Chinese  ] authorities . 
For example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , a [ORG Baidu  ] search of former Party Secretary [PER Jiang Zemin  ] reveals nothing but fawning news pieces . 
[ORG Baidu  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , actually gets more freedom because of its close relationship with the [MISC Chinese  ] Government and thus is the best search engine for searches using [MISC Chinese  ] characters . 
[ORG Google  ] remains the best for [MISC English  ] searches , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
" Depressing " [ORG State of Press Freedom  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER Poloff  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the tight media controls surrounding the [ORG Congress  ] were expected but " depressing " nonetheless . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that no information about internal [ORG Party deliberations  ] was revealed in the media and [LOC China  ] 's press was devoid of any real news during the [ORG Congress  ] . 
" Even at the very end , nobody knew for sure if the [ORG Standing Committee  ] would have nine or seven members , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , " why must all of this be kept so secret ? 
" This information control has had a dampening effect on public and academic debate about policy directions [LOC China  ] should take , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER Poloff  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he and other liberal academics have had great difficulty in recent months publishing " sensitive " articles , particularly dealing with democracy and rule of law , as a result of the [ORG Congress  ] . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that even though press controls remain tight , the [ORG Party has  ] lost much of its ability to set the public agenda . 
The [ORG Communist Party  ] can still control what is covered in the media , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , " but they cannot dictate what people care about . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] echoed this point , noting that the wider array of media options now makes it easier for [MISC Chinese  ] to tune out [ORG Party Congress  ] propaganda . 
" Rather than watch [ORG CCTV  ] coverage of the [ORG Congress  ] , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , " people can now just switch to one of the 60 other channels available .
