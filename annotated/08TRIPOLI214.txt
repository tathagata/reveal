REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] Chairman [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] and Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Siala  ] stressed to [MISC American  ] interlocutors in recent meetings that the [ORG GOL  ] views the recent confluence of the [ORG UTA  ] bombing case judgment against [LOC Libya  ] and a new [LOC U.S.  ] law intended to assist victims of terrorism as serious threats that could jeopardize further development of [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] bilateral ties and prompt [LOC Libya  ] to expel [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas companies and reduce oil production . 
End summary . 
[ORG U.S. OIL COMPANIES TREATED TO BROWBEATING  ] 2 . 
( C ) [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] CEO [PER Jim Mulva  ] was summoned to [ORG Sirte  ] for a half-hour " browbeating " by Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] during his visit to [LOC Libya  ] on/about February 24 . 
Country manager [PER Page Maxson  ] told P/E Chief that the entire conversation focused on al-Qadhafi 's " personal ire " about the so-called " [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] " ( section 1083 of the [ORG National Defense Authorization Act  ] of 2008 ) and the USD 6 billion award against [LOC Libya  ] in the [ORG UTA  ] bombing case , and al-Qadhafi 's view that [LOC Libya  ] had not been sufficiently compensated for its decision to give up [ORG WMD  ] and renounce terrorism . 
Al-Qadhafi passed a copy of his recent letter to the President on the subject ( ref B ) to [PER Mulva  ] . 
Telling [PER Mulva  ] that he and his fellow [LOC U.S.  ] oil company CEOs needed to engage members of the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] and the Administration on the matter , al-Qadhafi threatened to dramatically reduce [LOC Libya  ] 's oil production and/or expel out [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas companies . 
Al-Qadhafi claimed [LOC Libya  ] would rather " keep its oil in the ground " and wait for a more favorable overseas investment climate than continue high levels of production in an environment in which sizeable portions of its oil-related assets could be seized . 
3 . 
( C ) In a related development , [ORG Exxon-Mobil Country Manager  ] [PER Phil Goss  ] told P/E Chief that [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] , Chairman of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] , had chastised him during a meeting on February 25 for nearly an hour on the " dire political signal " represented by the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] and the [ORG UTA  ] judgment . 
[PER Ghanem  ] told [PER Goss  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas companies should " tell [LOC Washington  ] " that [LOC Libya  ] was serious in its threat to " significantly curtail " its oil production as a means to " penalize the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" for [PER Lautenberg  ] and [ORG UTA  ] . 
According to [PER Goss  ] , [PER Ghanem  ] -- a [MISC U.S.-educated  ] former Prime Minister -- was emotional in insisting that [LOC Libya  ] " would not tolerate " [PER Lautenberg  ] and [ORG UTA  ] without taking some retaliatory measures . 
Privately , [PER Goss  ] questioned whether the [ORG GOL  ] could really afford to significantly curb oil output at a time when it is making massive investments in infrastructure as part of the run-up to the 40th anniversary of the military coup that brought al-Qadhafi to power on September 1 , 2009 . 
Stressing the erratic nature of decisionmaking in the [ORG GOL  ] , [PER Goss  ] was careful not to rule out the possibility that [LOC Libya  ] could choose " to do something stupid " . 
DFM SIALA: [PER LAUTENBERG  ] & [ORG UTA JUDGMENT  ] " THREATEN EVERYTHING " 4 . 
( C ) In a meeting February 27 on other matters , Deputy Foreign Minister-equivalent Muhammad [PER Siala  ] stressed to [ORG CDA  ] the seriousness with which the [ORG GOL  ] views the [ORG UTA  ] bombing case damages judgment and [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] . 
[PER Siala  ] expressed concern that the confluence of the two developments was " ... destroying everything the two sides have built since 2003 " . 
[LOC U.S.  ] judicial and legislative branch decisions were " pushing [LOC Libya  ] into a corner " , forcing it to take measures to protect assets that could be exposed to seizure under the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] to satisfy terrorism-related claims such as that in the [ORG UTA  ] bombing case . 
In addition , such actions bolstered the position of [ORG GOL  ] elements suspicious of re-engagement with the [LOC United States  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOL  ] , [PER Siala  ] said , was urgently examining ways to protect its oil revenues from seizure by [LOC U.S.  ] plaintiffs . 
Claiming that payments to the [ORG GOL  ] by [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas companies alone totaled $1 billion per month , [PER Siala  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] recently decided to require that these payments be made in [LOC Euros  ] rather [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000214 002.2 OF 002 than in dollars . 
( Note: [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] country manager [PER Page Maxson  ] told P/E Chief total payments by [LOC U.S.  ] companies were more likely in the range of $500-750 million per month . 
End note . 
) [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas company country managers confirmed that all payments for services must now be in non-dollar currencies ; they must also pay their monthly revenue share to the [ORG GOL  ] in [LOC Euros  ] . 
In addition , [PER Siala  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] was considering whether to require [LOC U.S.  ] oil and gas companies to establish wholly-owned [MISC European  ] subsidiaries through which financial transactions could be funneled , creating an additional firewall against asset seizure . 
Stressing that senior [ORG GOL  ] leaders viewed [PER Lautenberg  ] and claims issues as " serious threats " to [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Siala  ] cautioned that unless some mechanism for mitigating both issues were identified soon , [LOC Libya  ] could be forced to slow its oil exports , likely prompting further price spikes in an already jumpy spot market . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Siala  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] 's understanding is that there are 26 outstanding cases before [LOC U.S.  ] courts , including [ORG Pan Am  ] 103 , [PER LaBelle  ] and [ORG UTA  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] could not afford to be " bled " continuously by high-dollar awards in such cases . 
Unless the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" took positive steps " to to resolve the [PER Lautenberg  ] and [ORG UTA  ] judgment issues , [LOC Libya  ] would be forced to divest itself of all investment and assets in the [LOC U.S.  ] financial system . 
( Note: [PER Mustafa Zarti  ] , Deputy Chairman of the [ORG Libyan Investment Authority  ] ( [ORG LIA  ] ) , [LOC Libya  ] 's sovereign wealth fund , subsequently told [ORG CDA  ] and P/E Chief that the [ORG LIA  ] had all but completely divested itself of [LOC U.S.  ] holdings totaling some $9 billion . 
Conceding that it was difficult for any fund manager not to have a position in the [LOC U.S.  ] market , he stressed that it made " no sense " for the [ORG LIA  ] to continue to invest in the [LOC U.S.  ] if its assets could be attached . 
End note . 
) Noting that he had personally played a key role in negotiating the release of [MISC Libyan  ] assets frozen in [LOC U.S.  ] banks in the sanctions era , [PER Siala  ] said [PER Lautenberg  ] was " much worse " because courts , not the executive branch , could seize assets and held them without paying interest . 
Because the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] provided for seizure before a final judgment had been reached , assets could be held for years without interest . 
COMMENT 7 . 
( C ) Comment: Elements of the [ORG GOL  ] remain convinced that the confluence of the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] and the [ORG UTA  ] judgment constitute a political signal about limits on the bilateral relationship . 
There is genuine confusion among some about why such a signal would have been sent so soon after FM [PER Abdulrahman Shalgam  ] 's January visit to [LOC Washington  ] and in the course of a good patch of bilateral programmatic cooperation , with some perceiving the timing as a deliberate insult . 
The threat to curb oil production seems unlikely to be carried out in light of [LOC Libya  ] 's current budget obligations and absolute dependance on oil revenues . 
The regime has demonstrated in the past , however , that it is prepared to take sizeable risks and incur significant short- to mid-term costs if it feels it has been politically slighted . 
End comment .
