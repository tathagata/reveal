[LOC MOSCOW  ] 1450 Classified By: Econ MC [PER Matthias Mitman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b. and d . 
) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) In a nod to President [PER Medvedev  ] 's 2008 anti-corruption legislation , [ORG Transparency International 's Corruption Perceptions  ] Index ranked [LOC Russia  ] at 146 , up one spot from its 2008 147th ranking . 
This general lack of progress confirms what analysts have told us . 
Corruption in [LOC Russia  ] remains a serious problem , despite [PER Medvedev  ] 's public denouncements and efforts to reduce it . 
This presents a quandary for the [ORG GOR  ] as it decides how to proceed . 
Dramatic steps might threaten the status quo , yet gradual steps so far have been ineffective . 
End [LOC Summary.  ] ------------------------------------- [LOC Russia  ] 's Corruption Rankings Stagnate ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Transparency International  ] released its 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index on 17 November . 
[LOC Russia  ] was ranked at 146 ( it was ranked at 147 in 2008 ) , which [ORG Transparency International  ] said reflected a " mildly positive " response to [PER Medvedev  ] 's 2008 anti-corruption legislation . 
[LOC Russia  ] 's 2009 rank , however , is still below its 2007 rank ( 143 ) and far below its 2006 rank ( 121 ) . 
These results echo the [ORG World Bank 's Worldwide Governance Indicators  ] , with [LOC Russia  ] 's rankings on " control of corruption " showing a steady annual decline since 2005. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Medvedev  ] has repeatedly stated that corruption is endemic to [LOC Russia  ] and has made fighting it a signature issue for his presidency . 
He has highlighted consistently the damage corruption has done to [LOC Russia  ] , most recently in both his high-profile " Forward [LOC Russia  ] " article in September and his 12 November address to the [ORG Federal Assembly  ] . 
Beyond the anti-corruption legislation promulgated last year , however , few practical steps have been implemented. -------------------- Elite Losing Control -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Furthermore , there is growing consensus among analysts that even if the power elite wants to tackle corruption , the economic crisis has exacerbated tendencies towards unmanageability of corruption within the power vertical . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told us that the [ORG GOR  ] may have waited too long . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that a few years ago , when only millions had been " stolen " from the [MISC Russian  ] people ( as opposed to today 's billions ) , the [ORG GOR  ] could have acted and not sparked public outrage . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the crisis had made the [ORG GOR  ] 's task more difficult and the scope of corruption has become unmanageable . 
As the crisis reduced the size of the pot and the anti-corruption rhetoric increased , some [MISC Russians  ] felt that they had best grab as much as they could while the going was good . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , noted that the tendency of corruption to evade control by the [ORG GOR  ] was not new . 
In 2006 -- at the height of [PER Putin  ] 's control in a booming economy -- it was rumored within the [ORG Presidential Administration  ] that as many as 60 percent of his orders were not being followed. --------------------------------------------- --- Do Changes At [ORG Interior Ministry Signal Progress  ] ? --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that Minister of [ORG Interior  ] [PER Rashid Nurgaliev  ] had recently fired or brought charges against a number of relatively low-ranking law enforcement officials for corruption . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated though , that it was too soon to judge whether this activity reflected real change . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , argued that [PER Nurgaliev  ] 's actions were not meaningful . 
He stated that action was required from higher up the power vertical and needed to affect the strata that average [MISC Russians  ] would consider " untouchable " . ----------------------------------- [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002823 002 OF 002 Can [LOC Russia  ] 's Trajectory Be Changed ? ----------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said that only a " revolution " could change [LOC Russia  ] 's current trajectory . 
He argued that the system had become too sclerotic and too beneficial for too many to allow for change . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that corruption had even become a positive factor for a substantial portion of society . 
By taking merit out of the equation for success , it was simply easier to pay for entrance to a university , for a contract , etc . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who has made a fortune in [LOC Russia  ] 's casino business , told us forthrightly that the " levels of corruption in business were worse than we could imagine " and that , after working here for over 15 years and witnessing first-hand the behavior of [ORG GOR  ] officials at all levels , he could not imagine the system changing. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Corruption in [LOC Russia  ] remains pervasive and deep-rooted . 
While [PER Medvedev  ] 's anti-corruption rhetoric is a step in the right direction , we have yet to see significant implementation of new measures . 
[MISC Russians  ] appear to accept current levels of corruption and seem inclined to pay up or emigrate , rather than protest . 
Neither have [MISC Russians  ] reacted to the sight of the connected few continuing to indulge in luxurious lifestyles as the economic recession continues to leave most [MISC Russians  ] worse off than they were two to three years ago . 
Nonetheless , the commentary on the [ORG GOR  ] 's increasing inability to manage the scope of corruption bodes ill for its stated effort to enhance corporate governance and investor confidence .
