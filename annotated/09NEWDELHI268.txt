<code><pre>Thursday , 12 February 2009 , 12:48 S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 000268 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 02/10/2019 TAGS PREL , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC PTER  ] , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC AF  ] , [LOC PK  ] , IN SUBJECT: [LOC INDIA  ] SCENESETTER FOR SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE HOLBROOKE REF: [PER A. ISLAMABAD  ] 236 [PER B. DELHI  ] 195 Classified By: Ambassador [PER David C. Mulford  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) We welcome your visit to [LOC New Delhi  ] as [LOC India  ] begins to gear up for parliamentary elections likely to be held in April-May . 
While popular anger over the November [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks has cooled slightly , [MISC Indian  ] officials continue to demand that [LOC Pakistan  ] respond to Delhi’s demands for action against the attack organizers . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [MISC Indians  ] have been among President [PER Karzai’s  ] most stalwart supporters and appear opposed to a complete overhaul of international reconstruction efforts , arguing that the focus should be on beefing up security forces and police , particularly in the south and east . 
Indo-Pakistani relations are in the deep freeze after [LOC Mumbai  ] , with bilateral efforts to resolve differences shelved for now . 
Despite clarifications made at the time your appointment was announced , you will likely face questions from the [MISC Indian  ] foreign policy establishment and media over renewed [LOC U.S.  ] activism on [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
The successful [MISC U.S.-India  ] nuclear deal and a post-Mumbai interest in beefing up counterterrorism cooperation underline our closer strategic partnership . 
These ties will likely grow regardless of which party prevails in this spring’s elections . 
[ORG Afghanistan: A Strategic Relationship  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC India  ] has maintained very close ties with the [PER Karzai  ] government since 2002 and has contributed over USD 1.2 billion in reconstruction assistance during that period , putting [LOC India  ] among the top ranks of [MISC Afghan  ] donors . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has historically supported friendly governments in [LOC Kabul  ] , in part to pressure [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
This has continued under [PER Karzai  ] , who has had long-standing personal ties to [LOC India  ] dating back to his four years of post-graduate studies in [LOC Himachal Pradesh  ] after the 1979 [MISC Soviet  ] invasion . 
[PER Karzai  ] has visited [LOC Delhi  ] seven times since 2002 ; the last visit was in January of this year when [PER Karzai  ] came to express solidarity with [LOC India  ] after the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG GOI  ] officials have expressed growing concern with the security situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which is affecting India’s extensive reconstruction projects , and they have been increasingly critical of what they perceive as the [MISC Pakistani  ] government’s inability or unwillingness to act in the border tribal belt . 
[LOC India  ] has not distanced itself from [PER Karzai  ] , nor questioned the international community’s approach to [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction . 
The [ORG GOI  ] feels that aspects of reconstruction could be improved , but priority should be given to strengthening the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG National Army  ] and police , given the deteriorating situation in southern and eastern parts of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The top [MISC Afghan  ] expert in the [ORG MEA  ] we spoke to last week ( Assistant Secretary equivalent ) argued that a complete overhaul was not necessary and that the focus should be on the tribal areas . 
Privately , the [ORG GOI  ] has been critical of efforts to bring [MISC Taliban  ] elements to the negotiating table , arguing that such attempts have confused [MISC Afghan  ] public opinion and fueled popular fears that the [MISC Taliban  ] will return through the back door. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) India’s contribution to [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction consists primarily of infrastructure development ( including the [MISC Parliament  ] building and a road that will connect the [MISC Afghan  ] Ring Road to an [MISC Iranian  ] port ) , trade facilities and extensive technical and [MISC English-language  ] training . 
However , the scope of assistance has been quite broad and has touched almost every sector -- telcoms , banking , public administration , transport , energy , aviation and IT . 
During the January visit , [LOC India  ] pledged to provide 250,000 metric tons of wheat in food aid . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is now working with [LOC India  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] to provide training in [LOC India  ] to [MISC Afghan  ] energy technicians . 
[LOC India  ] is also a staunch advocate of the proposed [MISC Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India  ] ( TAPI ) natural gas pipeline , and it believes the [ORG USG  ] should do more to make this a reality . 
We see opportunities for closer coordination on assistance . 
The [ORG GOI  ] should be receptive to partnering with the [LOC U.S.  ] , but will likely want to portray any such cooperation as part of a de-hyphenated , stand-alone , [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00000268 002 OF 005 [MISC U.S.-India  ] partnership that is global in scope . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is mindful of [MISC Pakistani  ] sensitivities on security-related assistance in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but this may be under review in the post-Mumbai environment . 
External Affairs Minister [PER Mukherjee  ] demurred in response to Secretary Rice’s October 4 request for unspecified [MISC Indian  ] support for [MISC Afghan  ] security forces , saying [LOC India  ] had not provided security support for [LOC Afghanistan  ] because of these concerns . 
Last July’s bombing of the [MISC Indian  ] embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] , which the [MISC Indians  ] suspect was linked to [LOC Pakistan’s ISI  ] , was a stark reminder of the dangers [LOC India  ] faces in its involvement in [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction . 
[ORG Pakistan: A Cold Peace  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The anger over the November [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks may be less visible now , but [LOC India  ] expects [LOC Pakistan  ] to arrest and try [MISC Pakistanis  ] involved in planning and organizing the attack and to dismantle terrorist infrastructure . 
The [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorist attacks deeply angered the [MISC Indian  ] public . 
This time , in addition to the reactions against [LOC Pakistan  ] , [MISC Indians  ] directed a new level of fury at their own political establishment , which they feel failed to protect them . 
The public’s anger pushed the [ORG Congress Party-led  ] government of Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] to shelve the bilateral [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] that was focused on resolving contentious issues , including ultimately [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
While the [ORG GOI  ] and [ORG Congress Party  ] leaders have made muscular statements demanding the [MISC GOP  ] investigate and prosecute those involved in the attack and asserting that no option has been foreclosed , India’s strategy has been to pursue a diplomatic rather than a military solution . 
[LOC India  ] has launched a worldwide diplomatic offensive to put pressure on [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] doubts the willingness of [LOC Pakistan’s  ] military leadership to take action against the [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayiba  ] ( [ORG LeT  ] ) and the civilian leaders’ ability to do so , and assesses that [LOC Pakistan  ] will make only token moves to rein in the [ORG LeT  ] and its affiliates as it waits for pressure from [LOC India  ] or the international community to dissipate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) You are likely to hear from your [MISC Indian  ] interlocutors that professions of good faith on the part of [LOC Pakistan’s  ] civilian leadership are insufficient because they lack sufficient control over [LOC Pakistan’s  ] many competing power centers . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] government’s faltering efforts to respond to the [MISC Indian  ] dossier on [LOC Mumbai  ] -- plagued by cynical denial of [LOC Pakistan’s  ] involvement , contradictory press statements by [MISC Pakistani  ] officials and missed self-imposed deadlines -- has only strengthened those views . 
Paradoxically , [LOC India  ] found dealing with [PER Musharraf  ] much easier . 
[ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials believe that any effort to stabilize [LOC Pakistan  ] depends on reform of [LOC Pakistan’s  ] military establishment . 
In the abstract , [LOC India  ] supports a democratic [LOC Pakistan  ] , but sees that as a longer term aspiration . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] believes the military has steadily gained power at the expense of the civilian government after the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
As Foreign Secretary [PER Menon  ] observed to the Ambassador earlier this week , “the good guys are losing.” [LOC Jammu  ] and [ORG Kashmir Anxiety  ] ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Despite clarifications made at the time your appointment was announced , there is continuing uncertainty and a degree of anxiety within the [MISC Indian  ] foreign policy establishment over a perceived interest in [LOC U.S.  ] activism on [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
The concern of successive [MISC Indian  ] governments over the decades has been that the [LOC U.S.  ] would try to pressure [LOC India  ] to make concessions that would be unacceptable in [LOC India  ] . 
Our [LOC Kashmir  ] mantra during the previous two administrations was that we support any peaceful solution agreed upon by [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] that takes into account the wishes of the [MISC Kashmiri  ] people . 
On [LOC Kashmir  ] , the two countries made considerable progress over the last four years in back channel discussions -- and [ORG National Security Advisor Narayanan  ] told Senator [PER Kerry  ] that an agreement in principle was in reach in late 2006 . 
However , President [PER Musharraf’s  ] fall from power coupled with the [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks have brought a halt to progress on the issue . 
[LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00000268 003 OF 005 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOI  ] believes that the political and security environment today in [LOC Kashmir  ] is such that the state could be poised for a sustained period of reconciliation and prosperity . 
The [MISC Indians  ] are particularly elated with the recent violence-free and high-turnout state legislative election they pulled off in [LOC Jammu  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
They believe [ORG Kashmiris  ] have rejected the agendas of the [MISC Pakistani  ] jihadis and [MISC Kashmiri  ] separatists , and are now ready to turn the page away from violence and are seeking good governance and normalization . 
With [PER Omar Abdullah  ] as Chief Minister , they have in place a young , forward thinking leader who could move the state out of its two decades of political paralysis . 
It is not clear , however , that the [ORG GOI  ] has the political will to make the kinds of gestures -- such as reducing the security forces footprint -- that [ORG Kashmiris  ] need to gain some confidence in the [MISC Indian  ] intentions . 
[LOC India  ] Heads to the Polls ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The political season entered its final lap this month when the two main political parties held political conferences to kick off their campaigns for the upcoming parliamentary elections . 
The political establishment will now be single-mindedly focused on these elections until June when the new [ORG Parliament  ] convenes and the next government is sworn in . 
Domestic political considerations will be paramount for the next three months . 
As the campaign heats up , we can expect the political attacks centered around security questions to get sharper and the rhetoric to become shriller . 
A relatively easy and no-political-cost punching bag for many parties is likely to be [LOC Pakistan  ] , which will be denounced for the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks and accused of supporting terrorists as a state policy. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The current [ORG Congress Party-led United Progressive Alliance  ] ( [ORG UPA  ] ) coalition government , which appeared to be in trouble only months ago , has recovered smartly . 
It has successfully deflected the fall-out from the [LOC Mumbai  ] terror attacks by keeping the international pressure on [LOC Pakistan  ] and announcing plans to strengthen its capacity to fight terrorism . 
While the economic slow-down remains a growing electoral concern , the government has benefited from a sharp reduction in inflation . 
In contrast , the opposition [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) , which had momentum last summer , has suffered of late . 
It experienced a crushing loss at the hands of the [ORG UPA  ] in a parliamentary vote last summer on [MISC US-India  ] civil-nuclear initiative . 
Its mixed performance in recent state elections has been demoralizing to its cadres . 
It continues to be racked by low intensity but persistent infighting that undermines its image of a well-disciplined political machine. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) It is impossible to predict now which party will emerge on top in the national elections . 
But it is safe to say that that neither the [ORG Congress Party  ] nor the [ORG BJP  ] is likely to win a majority on its own and either will have to forge a coalition with the smaller regional parties to form a government . 
While both the [ORG BJP  ] and the [ORG Congress  ] support a closer [MISC U.S.-India  ] relationship , their ability to move forward aggressively will be constrained by the disproportionate power of smaller parties , which have narrower agendas that frequently do not extend to foreign policy issues . 
The worst scenario for the [MISC U.S.-India  ] relationship would be one in which a “Third Front” forms a government that excludes both the [ORG Congress Party  ] and the [ORG BJP  ] . 
Under those circumstances , the [MISC Communist  ] parties will likely wield great influence in a coalition . 
Nevertheless , the nuclear deal and a closer strategic relationship with the [LOC United States  ] have generated an extraordinary public debate in [LOC India  ] during the last year . 
We have won this debate hands down and , as a result , the [MISC U.S.-India  ] relationship has a strong foundation on which to grow over the coming decades . 
Increased [ORG Law Enforcement Cooperation  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Following [LOC Mumbai  ] , we have offered counterterrorism assistance and encouraged the [ORG GOI  ] to focus on improving security preparedness and prevention of terrorist attacks . 
[LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00000268 004 OF 005 [LOC Pakistan’s  ] terrorist infrastructure is now perceived as a permanent threat . 
We have already seen unprecedented law enforcement cooperation between [LOC India  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , primarily with the [ORG FBI  ] . 
Historically , the [ORG GOI  ] had been a reluctant law enforcement partner . 
But after [LOC Mumbai  ] , it dropped its resistance and allowed [ORG FBI  ] teams in [LOC Mumbai  ] to provide investigatory assistance . 
Significantly , the high level of cooperation has included [ORG FBI  ] access to the sole living terrorist . 
The [MISC Indians  ] have also become far more amenable to accepting our many offers of counterterrorism assistance . 
The [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks have gone a long way to convincing the [ORG GOI  ] that no country can combat terrorism alone and that countries need to cooperate with one another to address this scourge . 
One of our next big challenges is to spur increased defense sales and cooperation . 
This will depend in part on the GOI’s acceptance of foundational agreements such as End Use Monitoring . 
[ORG Civil Nuclear Cooperation  ] ------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement  ] was approved by a large bipartisan majority in the [ORG House  ] and [ORG Senate  ] in September , signed by Secretary Rice and External Affairs Minister [PER Mukherjee  ] in [LOC Washington  ] October 10 , and brought into force by an exchange of diplomatic notes on December 6 . 
[LOC India  ] viewed the signing of the [ORG Agreement  ] as an historic event and an essential element in the transformation of our relationship . 
The [ORG Agreement  ] no longer dominates headlines , but the goodwill it generated has contributed to improved cooperation following the [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorist attacks. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Implementation of the [ORG Agreement  ] requires [LOC India  ] to take a number of steps . 
[LOC India  ] must bring its [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards agreement into force and file a declaration of safeguarded facilities to initiate civil nuclear cooperation with the world . 
For the [LOC United States  ] to fully realize the commercial benefits of cooperation , [LOC India  ] must also follow through on its commitment to set aside nuclear reactor park sites for [LOC U.S.  ] firms -- as it has already done for [LOC France  ] and [LOC Russia  ] -- and address other industry concerns , such as patent protection and adoption of domestic liability protection . 
[MISC Indian  ] officials also seem to be tying [LOC U.S.  ] company access to the conclusion of an additional bilateral arrangement regarding [LOC India  ] , s right to reprocess U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel . 
Successful implementation of the [ORG Agreement  ] will provide access to an estimated $150 billion in commercial opportunities for [LOC U.S.  ] firms and lead to the creation of up to 30,000 [MISC American  ] jobs over the next three decades . 
It will also help protect the [ORG Congressional  ] bipartisan consensus for [LOC India  ] and preserve the unprecedented popularity of the [LOC United States  ] among [MISC Indians  ] , on which our growing bilateral relationship depends . 
Regional Issues --------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Under Prime Minister Singh’s leadership , the [ORG GOI  ] is emerging as a responsible leader in the region , as well as in [LOC Asia  ] at large . 
[LOC India  ] encourages democracy in the region , mostly leading by example , but is worried by continuing political instability in nearly every neighboring country , and in practice seems to value stability over democracy when it comes to foreign policy . 
We follow closely [LOC India  ] ‘s “complex relationship” -- as [MISC Indian  ] officials have called it -- with [LOC China  ] , the dynamics of which will significantly affect not only [LOC Asia  ] as a power center of the 21st century , but directly impact [LOC U.S.  ] interests from the [LOC Pacific  ] to the [ORG Cape of Good Hope  ] . 
India-China relations can most easily be described as a mutual desire to seek warmer relations through strategic dialogue , however contentious border issues and emerging economic/political power rivalry constrain broader engagement . 
We still diverge with [LOC India  ] over tactics towards [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Burma  ] , although we ostensibly share the same strategic goals . 
The encouraging news for [LOC U.S.  ] interests is that whereas [LOC India  ] over the previous 40-odd years had tended to quickly and suspiciously dismiss [LOC U.S.  ] intentions in the region , our recent improvement in relations have made [LOC Delhi  ] much more amenable to cooperating on regional issues , as evidenced by our efforts together ranging from tsunami relief [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00000268 005 OF 005 to [MISC Nepalese  ] democracy to anti-piracy in the [LOC Gulf  ] and off [LOC Somalia  ] . 
Trend lines suggest the opportunity for even greater cooperation is ripe . 
Your Meetings ------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] has not resumed a working schedule following his recent quintuple by-pass surgery . 
You have confirmed meetings with External Affairs Minister [PER Pranab Mukherjee  ] and a lunch with [ORG National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan  ] . 
Foreign Secretary [PER Menon  ] may be your first meeting of the day . 
We have not been able to confirm a meeting with Home Minister [PER P. Chidambaram  ] , who will be busy with the parliamentary debate on the budget that will take place the day of your meetings .
