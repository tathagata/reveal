( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG GOL  ] quietly established a state security court of appeals on/about August 13 , apparently for the short-term purpose of hearing the case of twelve self-described regime dissidents detained since February 16 for planning a peaceful demonstration in [LOC Tripoli  ] calling for multiparty elections . 
The new court held an additional hearing on the dissidents' case November 6 . 
The dissidents , led by physician [PER Idriss Boufayed  ] , began a hunger strike on October 30 to protest their lengthy pre-trial detention . 
Opposition groups allege the twelve have faced " severe torture " in [MISC Libyan  ] custody , including lengthy detention in small underground cells . 
End summary . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] ESTABLISHES STATE SECURITY COURT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Human Rights Solidarity  ] ( [ORG LHRS  ] ) , a [MISC Libyan  ] opposition group operating in [LOC Europe  ] that relies on the [MISC Internet  ] to disseminate information inside [LOC Libya  ] , the [ORG GOL-affiliated Higher Judicial Council  ] announced the creation of a state security court of appeals on August 13 . 
On October 17 , [ORG LHRS  ] posted on its site an apparently authentic order bearing the seal and letterhead of the [ORG Higher Judicial Council  ] formally creating the state security court . 
According to the order , the court 's bailiwick comprises hearing cases derived from three laws: a 1975 amendment to Law 80 of the penal code that introduced the death penalty for offences against the state ; the 1972 law 71 which stipulates the death penalty for " any form of group activity based on a political ideology opposed to the principles of the September 1 , 1969 revolution " ; and a revolutionary committee decision from 1969 prohibiting peaceful instances of political opposition . 
According to [ORG LHRS  ] , cases under the new court will be conducted in secret and lawyers will be denied access to clients before their trial . 
In a statement , [ORG LHRS  ] likened the new court to the notorious People 's Courts , an extra-judicial entity established to punish political crimes that was formally dismantled in 2005 . 
SECURITY COURT HEARS CASE OF TWELVE REGIME DISSIDENTS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The state security court first heard the case against [PER Idriss Boufayed  ] , [PER al-Mahdi Hameed  ] , and ten other self-described regime dissidents November 6 . 
As described ref [MISC A-D  ] , the twelve dissidents were initially arrested on February 16 following a meeting with an officer at [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] and in advance of a planned peaceful demonstration in [LOC Tripoli  ] calling for multiparty elections . 
They face charges of advocating the overthrow of the government , illegal weapons possession , and illegal contact with a representative of a foreign government , each of which potentially carries the death penalty . 
The [ORG GOL  ] formally protested , claiming that Emboff 's meeting with the dissidents constituted " inappropriate " behavior ( ref E - NOTAL , and previous ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to witnesses at the November 6 hearing , two defendants -- [PER Juma'a Boufayed  ] ( believed to be the brother of group leader [PER Idriss Boufayed  ] ) and [MISC Abdulrahman  ] al-Qataywi -- did not appear in court . 
An earlier hearing scheduled for August 4 was postponed indefinitely by a [LOC Tripoli  ] criminal court without explanation ( ref F ) . 
According to [MISC Libyan  ] opposition groups resident outside the country , the court allowed the defendents to attend an opening session of the hearing and allowed [PER Idriss Boufayed  ] to make a statement attesting to the defendents' " mistreatment " in [MISC Libyan  ] detention . 
Following [PER Boufayed  ] 's statement , the defendants and public were removed from the courtroom while the session continued . 
A follow-up hearing was scheduled for November 20 . 
DISSIDENTS GO ON HUNGER STRIKE <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Opposition groups also report that on/about October 30 , [PER Boufayed  ] and his co-defendents , divided between the Ayn [PER Zara  ] and [LOC Jadida  ] prisons in [LOC Tripoli  ] , began a hunger strike . 
As of November 17 , the hunger strike was reportedly still ongoing . 
The purpose of the hunger strike is to protest against repeated delays in convening a meaningful hearing in the case against the fourteen defendants . 
One defendant , the popular opposition writer [PER Jamal al-Hajj  ] , told a website based in [LOC London  ] that he was refusing to eat " because I am innocent~ nothing in [MISC Libyan  ] law condemns me . 
" [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000989 002 OF 002 OPPOSITION GROUPS CONTINUE TO ALLEGE TORTURE <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Opposition groups have continuously reported that the self-styled anti-Qadhafi dissidents have been tortured while in [MISC Libyan  ] detention . 
On November 17 , the popular [MISC UK-based  ] opposition journal " [LOC Libya  ] al-Mustaqbil " reported that the dissidents faced " severe torture " during the first five months ( February to July 2007 ) of their detention , including being locked in pairs in extremely small ( less than 4 cubic meters ) underground cells . 
7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Comment: Apparently mindful of potential international condemnation of its imprisonment of peaceful dissidents , the [ORG GOL  ] has sought to manage the trial quietly . 
An effort by the [MISC Swiss  ] Ambassador in August to rally members of the diplomatic corps to press the [ORG GOL  ] to allow foreign observers of the trial proceedings failed to gain traction , in part because the [ORG GOL  ] strongly cautioned the diplomatic corps against pursuing such access . 
( [PER Note:  ] [PER Idriss Boufayed  ] is a [MISC Swiss  ] permanent resident ; one of the other detainees is a [MISC Danish-Libyan  ] dual citizen . 
End note . 
) The [ORG GOL  ] has generally refused to discuss the case with diplomats , claiming that it is a strictly internal matter . 
The regular [MISC Internet  ] postings of [ORG LHRS  ] and [LOC Libya  ] al-Mustaqbil currently constitute the best source of information about developments in the case . 
The fact that [ORG LHRS  ] was able to secure a copy of the presumably secret order establishing the state security court suggests that the dissident groups enjoy access to and the sympathies of at least some [ORG GOL  ] officials .
