He was pleased to share his insight with [ORG CDA  ] regarding the political , human rights and infrastructure situation in [LOC Iran  ] . 
End summary and introduction . 
Political Structure -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a conversation with [ORG CDA  ] on November 13 , [MISC Danish  ] Ambassador [PER Soren Haslund  ] said that the political structure in [LOC Iran  ] is composed of an incredibly small number of elites , which includes not just Supreme Leader [PER Ali Khamenei  ] and President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] , but also opposition leader [ORG Mir-Hossein Mousavi  ] . 
There is , [PER Haslund  ] warned , a tendency by the West to attribute huge differences to those in power and those in the opposition when , in fact , they are all part of the same small group . 
There is no true opposition faction in [LOC Iran  ] , he opined , really only " nuances of black " exist. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Haslund  ] termed the relationship between [PER Khamenei  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] one of " mutual hostages . 
" That is , they have become almost symbiotically dependent on one another . 
[PER Haslund  ] felt that [PER Khamenei  ] had essentially thrown his lot in entirely with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and the veterans of the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war . 
This , he suggested , signified something of a change on the part of the Supreme Leader who previously tried to remain above the fray and to balance the interests of both those who served in the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war and also the old guard who could trace their roots back to the revolution of 1979. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Khamenei  ] , according to [PER Haslund  ] , has an elaborate structure of civil servants around him . 
These people , he continued , are not clerics but rather highly trained technocrats that serve almost as a parallel structure to government . 
They are organized into what [PER Haslund  ] described as departments but the entire structure , he said , was almost clan like . 
These technocrats , whom he estimated numbered more than 1,000 , insulate the spiritual leader . 
Very few diplomats were granted meetings with [PER Khamenei  ] . 
[PER Haslund  ] never obtained a meeting with the Supreme Leader , though he did meet with the President on several occasions along with other diplomats. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The entire government structure , according to [PER Haslund  ] , is corrupt . 
This includes both the official government as well as the informal structure that surrounds [PER Khamenei  ] . 
There is , he said , a great deal of nepotism but that is unsurprising considering the large role that clans play in society . 
There is also " real " corruption . 
[PER Haslund  ] cited the example of how significant profits from state imports and exports are siphoned off into the religious foundations called [PER Bonyads  ] . 
This process , he said , is legal but no one knows what happens to this money once it is received by the [PER Bonyads  ] . 
He said that he had heard , anecdotally , that these religious foundations could possess holdings worth as much as nine billion [LOC U.S.  ] dollars . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's Place in the [MISC World --------------------------  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Haslund  ] , [MISC Iranians  ] consider themselves religiously , linguistically and ethnically superior to their neighbors . 
This [MISC Persian  ] arrogance , he argued , plays a large role in [LOC Iran  ] 's foreign policy . 
[LOC Iran  ] tends to use proxies and money to accomplish its regional goals , he said , and would prefer not to interact with its neighbors face-to-face . 
[LOC Syria  ] , he had heard , was receiving one billion dollars to act as just such a proxy for [LOC Iran  ] in what he termed a marriage of convenience between the two countries . 
[PER Haslund  ] suggested that [LOC Turkey  ] , as a secular country , might potentially serve as a regional ally for [LOC Iran  ] . 
Somewhat surprisingly , he also suggested that [LOC Israel  ] could eventually become a regional ally . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] , he said , have no particular hatred for [LOC Israel  ] and the approximately 30,000 [MISC Jews  ] that live in the country are treated well. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Haslund  ] also said that most of the [MISC Iranians  ] he met viewed [LOC America  ] as the most natural candidate to become a long-term global ally . 
For historical reasons , he suggested , [LOC Iran  ] has a deep mistrust of the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Russians  ] . 
[LOC America  ] , however , is viewed in a different light . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] , he joked , have noticed who is responsible for deposing of [PER Sadam Hussein  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] and the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It does not hurt the [ORG United States'  ] reputation in [LOC Iran  ] , he said , to be responsible for having removed two of the country 's greatest enemies . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000204 002.2 OF 002 Human Rights ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The human rights situation in [LOC Iran  ] , according to [PER Haslund  ] , is deplorable . 
The government is " tightening the screws on people " and is doing so with impunity . 
He said that sometimes human rights dissidents would be involved in suspicious " accidents " or " disappear . 
" More often , however , abuses were carried out openly . 
The government makes a point of letting everyone know what it is doing and the people are , understandably , cautious and scared . 
[PER Haslund  ] said that when he met with dissidents he never did so at the [MISC Danish  ] Embassy . 
He would sometimes visit them in their homes but , more often than not , his wife would pick them up in her personal vehicle and transport them to the Ambassador 's residence for a meeting . 
He said that dissidents were often willing to meet because they believed that increased exposure would actually make them safer . 
He met [ORG Nobel Prize  ] winner [PER Shriia Ebadi  ] frequently . 
Infrastructure --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Haslund  ] said that there were no noticeable effects of the trade embargo on [MISC Iranian  ] infrastructure , which he described as excellent and up to [MISC Western  ] standards . 
There is the occasional loss of electricity in [LOC Tehran  ] but this only occurred when there was too little rain and was indicative of the country 's limited hydroelectric capabilities rather than the embargo . 
[PER Haslund  ] noted that several of the airline 's passenger jets were outdated but seemed to be holding up in part because of recent arrival of spare parts . 
He said that he flew [ORG Boeing  ] 747s , [ORG Air Buses  ] , and [MISC Tupolevs  ] while he was there . 
Biographical Information ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Haslund  ] has previously served as [LOC Denmark  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Mexico  ] as well as Chief of Protocol for nine years in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
He also served at the [ORG United Nations  ] and in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Haslund  ] speaks fondly of his year as an undergraduate at [LOC Hamilton College  ] in [LOC New York  ] .
