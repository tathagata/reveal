( C ) Summary: [MISC French  ] FM [PER Kouchner  ] 's visit to [LOC Iraq  ] allowed [LOC France  ] to re-engage meaningfully with a wide range of [MISC Iraqi  ] political and confessional/ethnic leaders and left [PER Kouchner  ] " moved " by the extent of destruction in that country . 
The [MISC French  ] [ORG MFA  ] told us August 24 that [PER Kouchner  ] and his staff are still " reflecting " over the visit as they decide how to follow up . 
[PER Kouchner  ] 's interlocutors received his message of solidarity and desire to help with appreciation . 
[PER Kouchner  ] also took pains to dissociate his visit from the [ORG USG  ] and denied any link to the meeting in [LOC Maine  ] between Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] denies [PER Kouchner  ] formally offered to organize a dialogue among [MISC Iraqis  ] and believes the press has exaggerated the importance of some public musing on [PER Kouchner  ] 's part . 
[LOC France  ] will reach out to the [ORG EU  ] in support of a new multilateral initiative . 
The [ORG MFA  ] expects to be in touch with the [ORG USG  ] as well , although it may wait to see how things play out in [LOC Washington  ] in response to the [MISC Petraeus  ] report . 
The contours of [MISC French  ] thinking should be clearer by the time of the [ORG UNGA  ] , which will be no coincidence given [PER Kouchner  ] 's desire to place the [ORG UN  ] at the head of a multinational effort for [MISC Iraqi  ] reconstruction . 
One concrete result of the visit was [PER Kouchner  ] 's decision to proceed with stalled plans to establish a [MISC French  ] " embassy office " in [LOC Irbil  ] ; for budget and other administrative reasons , however , it is unclear when it will be set up . 
End summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] [ORG MFA  ] [LOC Iraq  ] desk officer [PER Olivier Masseret  ] provided a readout August 24 of FM [PER Kouchner  ] 's visit to [LOC Iraq  ] August 19-21 . 
His main points , a number of which have been made in the press , included: --The visit was entirely at [PER Kouchner  ] 's initiative and was in no way tied to the meeting in [LOC Maine  ] between Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
[PER Masseret  ] recalled [PER Kouchner  ] 's longstanding ties to [MISC Kurdish  ] leader and current former President of [LOC Iraq  ] [PER Jalal Talabani  ] , who had been pressing [PER Kouchner  ] to visit since [PER Kouchner  ] became foreign minister. --Making it clear that the visit in no way occurred at the request of the [LOC U.S.  ] or in furtherance of [LOC U.S.  ] policies was something [PER Kouchner  ] stressed with each of his interlocutors . 
[PER Masseret  ] complained that it has been hard to shake the press from the false but understandable impression that Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] had discussed or approved the visit when they met in [LOC Maine  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] also carried with him a copy of an editorial he wrote before the March 2003 invasion entitled " Neither [PER Saddam  ] nor War " to correct the misimpression that [PER Kouchner  ] had supported [LOC U.S.  ] military force to remove [PER Saddam  ] Hussein. --Kouchner 's jam-packed schedule included meetings with nearly every political leader and just about every confessional grouping . 
[PER Masseret  ] indicated that [PER Kouchner  ] knew he had some work to do rebuilding [LOC France  ] 's image . 
This included dispelling the notion that [LOC France  ] still harbors some nostalgia for the days when [LOC Iraq  ] 's [MISC Sunnis  ] dominated the political scene . 
[PER Masseret  ] sought to correct the misimpression that [PER Kouchner  ] only had contacts among [MISC Kurds  ] to say that this visit revealed to many for the first time that he was well known in all the major ethnic and confessional groups. --Iraqi leaders responded well to [PER Kouchner  ] 's core message of solidarity with the [MISC Iraqi  ] people 's suffering , readiness to listen and help , and commitment to turning the page in the [LOC Iraqi/French  ] relationship . 
There was some grousing about [LOC France  ] 's policy under President [PER Chirac  ] , but even that seemed pro forma . 
If anything , according to [PER Masseret  ] , the angriest sentiment [MISC Iraqis  ] expressed was that [LOC France  ] had waited so long after [PER Saddam Hussein  ] 's fall to re-engage meaningfully. --If anything impressed [PER Kouchner  ] , it was the absolute devastation that marked [LOC Iraq  ] in all spheres , especially the economic and social . 
This fueled [PER Kouchner  ] 's view , as expressed publicly , that [LOC Iraq  ] 's ongoing crisis was not merely a national tragedy but a catastrophe whose already dramatic regional implications are only increasing . 
[PER Masseret  ] said it may seem simplistic , but the visit was an eye-opening and moving experience for [PER Kouchner  ] . 
In particular , the plight of [LOC Iraq  ] 's [MISC Christians  ] touched [PER Kouchner  ] because of the escalating persecution they seem to face . 
( Comment: This was a point [PER Kouchner  ] made in an interview on one of the nightly national newscasts . 
End comment ) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kouchner  ] and his staff are now reflecting on the visit and trying to figure out what to make [LOC France  ] 's focus and how best to rally [MISC European  ] and other international support . 
[PER Masseret  ] dismissed press speculation about a [LOC PARIS  ] 00003534 002 OF 002 possible [MISC French-hosted  ] gathering of [MISC Iraqi  ] leaders along the lines of the intra-Lebanese dialogue [PER Kouchner  ] initiated . 
He explained that [PER Kouchner  ] did muse to reporters that [LOC France  ] would be open to creating a safe space for competing factions to meet , but it was no more concrete than that . 
He denied that [PER Kouchner  ] made the offer in his various meetings and agreed that President [PER Talabani  ] 's rejection of such an initiative effectively took it off the table at least for now . 
The bottom line for [PER Kouchner  ] , [PER Masseret  ] continued , was that anything [LOC France  ] does add real value and not appear to another case of [LOC France  ] off on its own pursuing objectives that had no other buy-in. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Masseret  ] spoke of the [ORG UN  ] angle , which is symbolically and ideologically important to [PER Kouchner  ] . 
As reported in the media , [PER Masseret  ] spoke of [PER Kouchner  ] 's insistence on arriving in [LOC Baghdad  ] exactly four years after the bombing of the [ORG UN  ] compound that killed his friend [PER Sergio de Mello  ] and many former colleagues from [PER Kouchner  ] 's days directing [ORG UN  ] efforts in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] further insisted that his first official act in [LOC Bagdhad  ] be the laying of a wreath at the site of the bombing to honor the fallen . 
It was not clear to [PER Masseret  ] how the [ORG UN  ] will fit into [PER Kouchner  ] 's thinking , but press reports were right to highlight the key role he will want it to play in any concerted multilateral effort. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) How [LOC Europe  ] will fit into [MISC French  ] ideas for the way forward in [LOC Iraq  ] is a central aspect of evolving [MISC French  ] thinking . 
[PER Masseret  ] would not comment on press reports of tepid responses by many of [PER Kouchner  ] 's [ORG EU  ] colleagues in response to his encouragement that they follow his lead . 
[LOC Europe  ] , however , will be key should [LOC France  ] seek to mobilize a more robust [ORG UN  ] presence and effort in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Although there are no plans just yet , [LOC France  ] will seek an appropriate [ORG EU  ] ministerial to discuss increased and concerted support for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Masseret  ] said that [PER Kouchner  ] will need to convince his colleagues that this is not just another instance of [LOC France  ] going off on its own but something that has implications for [ORG EU  ] interests in the [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Working with the [LOC U.S.  ] is another subject under discussion . 
[PER Masseret  ] said that [PER Kouchner  ] wants to consult with the Secretary , as he did August 24 , on a regular basis but preserve [LOC France  ] 's independence . 
This includes its ability to speak its mind when and as it deems necessary . 
Agreeing that the visit arguably transformed the [LOC Iraq  ] issue from being a subject of disagreement to one about which we could have a useful dialogue , the [ORG MFA  ] will probably not have recommendations on what to say to the [LOC U.S.  ] until the current " reflection " period ends . 
While not saying how long that might last , he surmised that [LOC France  ] will be ready to talk to us and others about [LOC Iraq  ] on the margins of the [ORG UNGA  ] in late September . 
Noting the release of the [MISC Petraeus  ] report in mid-September , [PER Masseret  ] expected it would inform [MISC French  ] thinking not merely for its content but also for its impact on [LOC U.S.  ] policy afterward. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) One area of U.S./French cooperation [PER Masseret  ] praised effusively was the outstanding help provided for [PER Kouchner  ] 's visit by [LOC Baghdad  ] Deputy Polcouns [PER Rob Waller  ] ( on a one-year TDY from his job as [LOC Paris  ] [ORG NEA  ] watcher ) . 
His role was vital in ensuring coordination of security and other logistical arrangements . 
( Comment: The acting director of the [ORG MFA  ] 's equivalent to our [ORG NEA  ] bureau echoed this point in a separate encounter . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As a final note , [PER Masseret  ] confirmed tentative press reporting that the [ORG MFA  ] is now committed to the idea of opening an " embassy office " in [LOC Irbil  ] . 
He elaborated that it would be lightly staffed -- a sort of " [MISC French  ] presence post " -- and not expected to handle consular duties ( too few [MISC French  ] citizens in northern [LOC Iraq  ] , no desire to take on visa work in [LOC Irbil  ] ) . 
When asked about the timeframe , [PER Masseret  ] was vague , citing budgetary and other " administrative " issues that needed to be worked out . 
Another problem arose after [PER Kouchner  ] started informing his interlocutors of the office in [LOC Irbil  ] as Shi'a contacts pressed for a similar office in [LOC Basra  ] for " balance . 
" [PER Kouchner  ] made a vague commitment to do what he could , but [PER Masseret  ] stated the security situation in [LOC Basra  ] at the moment clearly ruled that idea out of the question .
