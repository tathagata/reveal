( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Nearly one year after the murder of controversial [MISC Dutch  ] filmmaker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] by [MISC Islamic  ] extremist [PER Mohammed Bouyeri  ] , the [ORG GONL  ] is still struggling to craft a strategy to address rising radicalization of its large and disenfranchised [MISC Muslim  ] population . 
An October 26 conference in [LOC Amsterdam  ] , organized by the [ORG National Counter Terrorism Office  ] ( [ORG NCTB  ] ) to survey efforts to combat terrorism and radicalization since [PER Van Gogh  ] 's November 2 , 2004 murder , made clear the [ORG GONL  ] remains divided on how to tackle social , political , and law enforcement issues related to radicalization . 
The conference highlighted the difficulty of discussing the link between terrorism and [MISC Islamic  ] extremism in a country simultaneously struggling to address broader issues of [MISC Muslim  ] integration . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) During a well-attended day-long [LOC Amsterdam  ] conference on radicalization hosted by the [ORG National Counter Terrorism Office  ] ( [ORG NCTB  ] ) , the [MISC Dutch  ] Ministers of [MISC Justice  ] , Interior , and [ORG Immigration and Integration  ] presented strikingly divergent views on how to address the problem of radicalization among [MISC Dutch  ] Muslims . 
[ORG Justice Minister Donner  ] , for example , stressed the need for mutual understanding of beliefs to combat radicalization , a problem he described as emerging from our own ground and soil . 
Referring to the broader societal divides between [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim populations , he argued that all sides should learn to accept changes and differences , even fundamental ones , to reduce social tensions . 
Interior Minister [PER Remkes  ] , on the other hand , argued that government representatives must stand firm against fundamentalism , radicalization and violence . 
Articulating a hard-line approach , [PER Remkes  ] called for a clear delineation of non-debatable values , and urged local community actors , including schools , to work with the [MISC Dutch  ] intelligence services to identify radicals . 
( [PER NOTE: Earlier  ] in the week , [MISC Dutch  ] press reported widespread criticism of [LOC Remkes'  ] proposal . 
END NOTE . 
) Minister of [ORG Immigration and Integration Verdonk  ] , known for supporting tough immigration and integration policies , cited a serious lack of involvement and commitment to integration by certain groups as a contributing factor to radicalization , and called for wider participation of the [MISC Muslim  ] community in the broader society. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [ORG Non-governmental  ] panelists , drawn from academia and the [MISC Muslim  ] community , similarly took different approaches to both root causes of , and potential solutions for radicalization . 
Professor [PER Bassam Tibi  ] of [ORG Cornell University  ] cited the lack of a [MISC European Muslim  ] identity as a fundamental problem leading to radicalization , and called for the creation of a [MISC European  ] [MISC Islam  ] compatible with core [MISC European  ] values and principles . 
A [MISC Dutch  ] researcher on [MISC Muslim  ] youth and radicalization , [PER Frank Buijs  ] , similarly called for religious alternatives within [MISC Islam  ] , noting that [MISC Muslim  ] youth are finding few moderate [MISC Islamic  ] voices when trawling the internet for answers to their existential and basic life questions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Sadik Harchaoui  ] , Director of a [MISC Dutch  ] social organization catering to youth , painted a bleak portrait of a large [MISC Muslim  ] population plagued by serious and concrete social and economic ills , including discrimination , poverty , and unemployment . 
He charged the [ORG GONL  ] with failure to address problems within the [MISC Muslim  ] community prior to [PER Van Gogh  ] 's murder , and for now overemphasizing the potential for radicalization of the community . 
[PER Harchaoui  ] claimed the government was creating a virtual reality of radicalization , one that made radicalization synonymous with terrorism and therefore threatened to alienate the broader [MISC Muslim  ] community. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: The [LOC Amsterdam  ] conference , intended to highlight the [ORG GONL  ] 's progress in combating [MISC Islamic  ] radicalization in the year since [PER Theo van Gogh  ] 's murder , instead exposed stark divisions within the government , and within [MISC Dutch  ] society at large , on how to tackle this increasingly important issue . 
The conference also highlighted intense [MISC Dutch  ] interest in learning from [LOC U.S.  ] experiences with regard to integrating immigrant populations while maintaining a clear national identity . 
Emboffs in attendance fielded a large number of questions about [LOC U.S.  ] policies and programs throughout the day , demonstrating both curiosity about the [LOC U.S.  ] experience and a sometimes surprising lack of familiarity with [LOC U.S.  ] history and society . 
Post will continue to look for opportunities -- such as a possible [LOC U.S.  ] trip by Minister [ORG Verdonk  ] ( ref a ) -- to reach out to [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim [MISC Dutch  ] leaders seeking to counter radicalization and extremism in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
END COMMENT .
