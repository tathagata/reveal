REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The [ORG Council of Europe  ] ( [ORG COE  ] ) likes to portray itself as a bastion of democracy , a promoter of human rights , and the last best hope for defending the rule of law in [LOC Europe  ] - and beyond . 
It is an organization with an inferiority complex and , simultaneously , an overambitious agenda . 
In effect , it is at its best in providing technical assistance to member-states and at its worst in tackling geo-political crises . 
The following is a brief overview of the [ORG COE  ] for the [MISC Department’s  ] use in preparing for [ORG COE  ] Secretary General [PER Terry Davis’  ] talks in [LOC Washington  ] March 17-20 . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The current [ORG COE  ] Secretary General , [PER Terry Davis  ] ( [LOC UK  ] ) , leaves office this summer , after a five-year term that has been , according to many sources , devoid of vision . 
[PER Davis  ] is known as a micromanager and will not be missed by many of his staff as well as by many resident ambassadors . 
In addition to having an unpopular lame duck at its helm , the [ORG COE  ] suffers from a large and entrenched secretariat that bristles at direction from member-states . 
It also ( particularly under the current Chair - [LOC Spain  ] ) suffers from an attempt to proceed only with full consensus . 
Finally , the [ORG COE  ] receives ( rightfully , in our view ) neither the level of funding nor the attention from member-states that other regional organizations , such as the [ORG EU  ] and the [ORG OSCE  ] receive . 
The next Secretary General will have to address these factors if the [ORG COE  ] is to fulfill its limited - yet important - potential ( septel addresses the four candidates running to replace [PER Davis  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the eve of Secretary General [PER Davis’  ] meetings in [LOC Washington  ] , we outline some of the [MISC COE’s  ] “value added” while note some of its serious shortcomings . 
The [ORG COE  ] can provide valuable services , such as training [ORG EU  ] monitors in protecting human rights in [LOC Georgia  ] and in arranging for prisoner exchanges in the aftermath of the August war there . 
The [ORG COE’s European Commission for Democracy Through Law  ] ( commonly known as the “Venice [ORG Commission”  ] ) advises governments on national legislation on constitutional law , electoral codes , and fundamental freedoms . 
Its Group of [MISC States Against Corruption  ] ( GRECO - of which the [LOC U.S.  ] is a formal member and a major financial contributor ) investigates and reports on individual countries’ efforts to root out systematic corruption . 
Various [ORG COE  ] bodies also exchange information on money laundering and cyber crime ( the [LOC U.S.  ] is a party to the [ORG COE Convention  ] on Cybercr8me , as well as the conventions on Transfer of Sentenced [MISC Persons  ] and on [ORG Mutual Administrative Assistance  ] in [ORG Tax Matters  ] ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One of the [MISC COE’s  ] bodies with the widest reach is the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] ( [ORG ECHR  ] ) . 
The [ORG ECHR  ] serves as the court of final appeal for member-states’ citizens who have exhausted all legal appeals in their own country and whose case pertains to an area covered by the [ORG European Convention  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] . 
All member-states are required to respect and implement the ECHR’s decisions . 
The Court currently has a backlog of almost 100,000 cases ( [LOC Russia  ] is blocking a mechanism - Protocol 14 - that has been ratified by every other [ORG COE  ] member-state that would reduce the number of judges required to process routine cases - one critical example of how consensus can work against [ORG COE  ] efficacy ) . 
The [ORG ECHR  ] will block the extradition of prisoners to non-COE countries if it believes they would be subject to the death penalty or torture . 
It has also requested more information on pending [MISC British  ] extradition cases to the [LOC U.S.  ] where it believes the prisoners might be sentenced in the [LOC U.S.  ] to life imprisonment with no possible appeal or automatic judicial review of the life sentence. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While the [ORG COE  ] can be effective in the various important tasks as noted above , on key geostrategic questions , it muddles through at best . 
The most recent - and serious - example is the [MISC COE’s  ] approach on the [LOC Georgia-Russia  ] conflict . 
The [ORG Parliamentary Assembly  ] ( [ORG PACE  ] ) strongly condemned [MISC Russia’s  ] actions against [LOC Georgia  ] and called on member-states - and other countries - not to recognize the breakaway “republics , ” the decision-making Council of Ministers ( and their deputies - the 47 resident ambassadors in [LOC Strasbourg  ] ) did little to promote a meaningful action plan regarding [LOC Georgia  ] . 
This was partially due to the chronic “consensus at any price” approach of some delegations - including those of some [ORG EU  ] member-states - that basically provided [LOC Moscow  ] a veto on meaningful [ORG COE  ] action . 
It is also indicative of the current Council of [ORG Ministers’ Chair  ] - [LOC Spain  ] - which takes a much more collegial approach to discussions than the previous Chair - [LOC Sweden  ] . 
In any case , if the [ORG EU’s  ] 27 member-states are not unified on an issue , the [ORG COE  ] will not be , either. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
C ) Two other illustrations of the [MISC COE’s  ] reach extending far [LOC STRASBOURG  ] 00000006 002.2 OF 002 beyond its influence is the omnipresent agenda item of “the situation in [MISC Cyprus.”  ] [ORG COE  ] discussions on this issue amount to little more than an undiplomatic volley of mutual recriminations between the [MISC Cypriot  ] and [MISC Turkish  ] ambassadors . 
Still , behind the scenes , the [ORG COE  ] is promoting limited programs such as the use of “neutral” history text books in both countries . 
We also note that the [ORG COE  ] has had little success in pressuring [LOC Belarus  ] to meet [ORG COE  ] criteria so that it can resume its application process for full [ORG COE  ] membership. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
C ) Finally , we turn to one issue where the [ORG COE  ] has been both an irritant and , more recently , somewhat of a champion - [ORG Guantanamo  ] . 
[PER Dick Marty  ] , a member of the [MISC Swiss  ] delegation to the [ORG PACE  ] , conducted an investigation into renditions and “secret prisons” in [LOC Europe  ] connected to the [LOC U.S.  ] war on terrorism . 
His work created a great deal of controversy and anti-U.S. sentiment in the [ORG COE  ] . 
More recently , however , [PER SecGen Davis  ] and [ORG COE Human Rights  ] Commissioner [PER Hammarberg  ] have called on [ORG COE  ] member-states to work with the [LOC U.S.  ] and consider accepting detainees from [ORG Guantanamo  ] to help the [LOC U.S.  ] shut down the detention facility there .
