( C ) We met with Ambassador-at-Large Gediminas Serksnys February 20 to encourage the [ORG GOL  ] to demarche [LOC Iceland  ] against the withdrawal of its mobile patrol team from [LOC Afghanistan  ] at the end of April 2007 . 
[PER Serksnys  ] expressed only mild disappointment at the loss of the [ORG Mobile Liaison Observation Team  ] ( MLOT ) . 
He pointed out that the [MISC Icelandic  ] personnel would not be leaving [ORG Ghor  ] , and neither would their equipment . 
The team members will merely be " changing their uniforms " and will instead work on civil reconstruction projects . 
Their vehicles will reamain available for use by the [ORG PRT.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We asked whether the loss of the specialized driving skills of the [MISC Icelandic  ] team would pose a problem for PRT [LOC Chaghcharan  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Serksnys  ] was hopeful that new [MISC Croatian  ] drivers might fill this role . 
Ambassador [PER Serksnys  ] said that the [MISC Croatian  ] contribution to the [ORG Ghor  ] PRT is planned to reach 200 people in 2007 and 300 by 2008 . 
[PER Serksnys  ] said that he had spoken with military officers on the ground who said that [MISC Icelandic  ] drivers are very good in the difficult terrain of the region , but that they also had restrictions that sometimes meant that those capabilities could not be put to their fullest use . 
He also said that the [MISC Croats  ] have experience in these types of driving conditions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Serksnys  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] focus is clearly on reconstruction projects that require civilian resources . 
He pointed out that much of the threat of instability right now in the region is posed by poverty , disgruntled poppy farmers , and a lack of training in the police force . 
He was convinced that the new work the [MISC Icelandic  ] team would be doing was at least as important as the patrolling it has done to date . 
Furthermore , [PER Serksnys  ] estimated overall contributions from [LOC Iceland  ] would reach $700,000 per year , about half the sum [LOC Lithuania  ] itself provides. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) On a separate note , [PER Serksnys  ] told us he was happy with the announcement that the [ORG EU  ] would be sending police officers to help train in the provinces . 
[PER Serksnys  ] said police training is a critical area on which to focus . 
In his general observation police officers in [LOC Afghanistan  ] have low education levels and the only training they recevie is in marching . 
[LOC Lithuania  ] has already provided some training in forensic science and vehicle security checks . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is currently seeking the resources to be able to provide training and equipment for a ballistic forensic science center in the future .
