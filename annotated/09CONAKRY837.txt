<code><pre>S E C R E T CONAKRY 000837 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/06/2018 TAGS PREL , PGOV , [ORG ASEC  ] , GV SUBJECT: [MISC LIBYAN  ] LEADER MEETS WITH [MISC GUINEAN  ] PRESIDENT Classified By: POL/ECON CHIEF SHANNON CAZEAU FOR REASON 1.4 B AND D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) On a trip that included several stops in neighboring [MISC West African  ] countries , [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar Qadhafi  ] spent approximately three hours in the VIP lounge of the [LOC Conakry  ] airport on January 3 where he met with President [PER Moussa Dadis Camara  ] and Prime Minister [PER Kabine Komara  ] . 
Press reports indicate that [PER Qadhafi  ] chose not to leave the airport because the [ORG Guinean Government  ] could not offer adequate security . 
In anticipation of his arrival , some 250 [MISC Libyan  ] paratroopers reportedly arrived in two aircrafts the evening of January 2. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Specific details as to what was discussed in the meeting between the leaders are murky . 
Sensitive sources indicate that [PER Qadhafi  ] may have offered to provide the new [ORG Guinean Government  ] with weapons . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX local press speculated that the [MISC Libyan  ] leader may have been looking to reinstate a controversial hotel contract that had been negotiated by former Prime Minister [PER Kouyate  ] in late 2007 , and then cancelled a few months later by the late President [PER Conte  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador mentioned to DCM on January 5 that he had heard that [PER Qadhafi  ] had negotiated some kind of arms deal. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Both press and independent sources reported that [PER Qadhafi  ] gave a bullet-proof [ORG Nissan  ] vehicle to President [PER Camara  ] . 
A sensitive source told [ORG Embassy  ] that [PER Qadhafi  ] also gave the president a large sum of cash. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [MISC Libyan  ] press ( [ORG Tripoli Great  ] Jamahiriyah TV ) reported that [PER Qadhafi  ] congratulated his “companions in the military council” for having the “situation in [LOC Guinea  ] under control after the death of President [PER Lansana Conte”  ] and for having “managed to save [LOC Guinea  ] from internal problems.” [PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly said that the [MISC Guinean  ] people “are backing the revolutionaries.” ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Civilian contacts have claimed that [LOC Libya  ] provided financial support for the December 23 coup , and that opposition political leader [PER Alpha Conde  ] ( [ORG Rally for the Guinean People  ] - RPG ) may have personally solicited [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] support . 
During his administration , former Prime Minister [PER Lansana Kouyate’s  ] frequent trips to [LOC Libya  ] generated rampant speculation as to what the [MISC Guinean  ] leader may have been trying to negotiate with [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
In the absence of any clarification from either government as to what was discussed , speculation continues . 
Relations with [LOC Libya  ] are viewed with suspicion by some [MISC Guineans  ] due to [MISC Qadhafi’s  ] alleged support of controversial leaders in neighboring countries ( i.e . 
[PER Charles Taylor  ] in [LOC Liberia  ] and [ORG RUF  ] rebels in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] ) .
