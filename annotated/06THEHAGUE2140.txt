( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] Following the weekly [ORG Cabinet  ] meeting , the [ORG GONL  ] announced September 29 its decision to participate in the Production , Sustainment , and Follow-on Phase of the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
The [ORG Cabinet  ] announcement stressed that the [ORG GONL  ] intends to sign the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] with the [ORG USG  ] in early November following parliamentary approval . 
[MISC Dutch  ] officials expect parliamentary debate as early as October 9 . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Cabinet  ] press statement stressed that signing the [ORG MOU  ] does not commit the [MISC Dutch  ] to buy [ORG JSF  ] -- signing the [ORG MOU  ] was a " " logical step " " but not " " irreversible . 
" " Final decision on [ORG JSF  ] procurement would occur in 2009 . 
Nevertheless , the announcement made the case that [ORG JSF  ] is the best candidate to replace the [ORG Dutch Air Force  ] 's aging [MISC F-16  ] fleet , while participation in the [ORG JSF  ] program has been good for both [ORG Dutch Defense  ] and industry . 
It noted that 70 [MISC Dutch  ] companies have obtained over [MISC USD  ] 700 million in contracts , while participation in the follow-on phase could result in revenue of over [MISC USD  ] eight billion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The press announcement was accompanied by an eight-page letter from [ORG MOD State Secretary Cees  ] van der Knaap to [LOC Parliament  ] , which explained the purpose of the follow-on phase while making financial and defense arguments in favor of signing the [ORG MOU  ] in November . 
[ORG MOD Policy Advisor for North American Affairs  ] [PER Eric Veerheem  ] told [ORG ODC  ] officer September 29 that he expects [LOC Parliament  ] to debate the issue as early as October 9. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: Coming out publicly in favor of signing the [ORG MOU  ] is a signal that the [ORG GONL  ] is confident it has a majority of votes in [LOC Parliament  ] to approve participation in the follow-on phase . 
With government coalition members like the [ORG Christian Democrats  ] and the [ORG Liberal Party  ] -- coupled with smaller parties like List [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] and [ORG Christian Union  ] -- in favor of the program , the [ORG GONL  ] has cause to be confident . 
Nevertheless , [ORG JSF  ] has been an election issue for the main opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , which could well come out swinging against [ORG JSF  ] in the parliamentary debate . 
End comment .
