( C ) During a press conference on the margins of the [MISC Italy-Turkey  ] summit in [LOC Izmir  ] on November 12 , [MISC Italian  ] PM [PER Berlusconi  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] had “provoked” [LOC Russia  ] by unilaterally recognizing [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence , pressing forward on [LOC Missile Defense  ] , and inviting [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] to have a closer relationship with [ORG NATO  ] . 
While Berlusconi’s latest comments are a culmination of a string of inflammatory and unhelpful comments in support of [PER Putin  ] that began shortly after [PER Berlusconi  ] took office this year , these latest statements went considerably further in attempting to place the blame for [MISC Russia’s  ] paranoia on the [LOC U.S.  ] Additionally , [PER Berlusconi  ] appears to be encouraging his own government and [LOC Russia  ] to disregard the current administration and lobby the incoming [LOC U.S.  ] President to take a softer line on [LOC Russia  ] . 
At the same time , he has attempted to portray himself as the primary interlocutor between [PER Putin  ] and the [LOC West  ] , and particularly with the [LOC U.S.  ] As a result of Berlusconi’s latest comments , post reached out to interlocutors at all levels to register our dismay at the latest barrage of Berlusconisms . 
Our contacts universally responded with a combination of dismay , dismissal or shoulder-shrugging . 
In an effort at damage-control , FM [PER Frattini  ] dispatched a senior [ORG MFA  ] official the following morning to see the [ORG A/DCM  ] and ‘clarify’ the [ORG GOI  ] , s stance . 
Instead , he took back a terse message to the FM that such comments risk substantial and lasting damage to [LOC Italy  ] , s credibility in [LOC Washington  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a press conference with [MISC Turkish  ] PM [MISC Erdogan  ] on November 12 in [LOC Izmir  ] , PM [PER Berlusconi  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] had “provoked” [LOC Russia  ] by unilaterally recognizing [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence , pressing forward with [LOC Missile Defense  ] and encouraging [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] to have a closer relationship with [ORG NATO  ] . 
Berlusconi’s latest comments represent a continuation of a long campaign of support for [PER Putin  ] since the [MISC Italian  ] PM returned to power this year . 
In addition to his latest comments , [PER Berlusconi  ] has supported [MISC Russian  ] initiatives to create a new security architecture in [LOC Europe  ] to supersede [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG OSCE  ] , has insisted that [PER Putin  ] acted appropriately during the [LOC Georgia-Russia  ] conflict , and has opposed [ORG NATO  ] expansion on the basis that it presents a threat to [LOC Russia  ] . 
He has even called for [LOC Russia  ] to be a full member of the [ORG EU  ] - a comment he made at a time when the [ORG EU  ] was considering whether to continue business as usual with [LOC Russia  ] in the aftermath of the [LOC Georgia-Russia  ] conflict. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Most disturbingly , [PER Berlusconi  ] has attempted to portray himself to [LOC Russia  ] and the [ORG EU  ] as the principal interlocutor between the transatlantic community , and in particular the [LOC U.S.  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] . 
He has repeatedly called on the [LOC U.S.  ] to take a softer line with [LOC Russia  ] on virtually all democratic and security issues and has even called on his government and [LOC Russia  ] to look beyond the current administration to the incoming [LOC U.S.  ] President in order to achieve these goals. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Following this latest set of remarks , we reached out to virtually every senior interlocutor on [LOC Russia  ] within the [ORG GOI  ] and in [PER Berlusconi  ] , s own center-right coalition . 
The Ambassador called [PER DPM Letta  ] . 
[ORG A/DCM  ] called FM Frattini’s chief of staff , the [ORG MFA  ] Director General for [LOC Europe  ] , the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , and a member of parliament from Berlusconi’s party . 
Poloff reached out to the Acting Director of the [ORG MFA Russia Office  ] , the Director of the [ORG Security Planning Department  ] , the diplomatic advisors to [PER Berlusconi  ] , and members of Berlusconi’s party . 
We expressed our concern that Berlusconi’s attempts at ‘creating dialogue’ with [LOC Russia  ] were , in fact , creating greater tension and undermining common efforts to bring stability to the [LOC Balkans  ] , and portraying the successful and peaceful expansion of the [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] space as a threat to [LOC Russia  ] . 
In an apparent effort at damage-control , FM [PER Frattini  ] sent a senior member of his staff , [ORG Policy Planning Director  ] [PER Maurizio Massari  ] , the day after [PER Berlusconi  ] , s remarks to call on [ORG A/DCM  ] to ‘clarify’ [ORG GOI  ] policy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Massari  ] ( as did virtually all of our interlocutors ) told [ORG A/DCM  ] that the PM was accustomed to making off-the-cuff remarks that should not be interpreted as policy statements per se . 
[PER Massari  ] said that [PER Frattini  ] was urging the [LOC U.S.  ] to [LOC ROME  ] 00001386 002.2 OF 002 look to [MISC Italy’s  ] strong bilateral cooperation rather than Berlusconi’s comments as an indication of the strength of the relationship and the direction of [MISC Italian  ] policy . 
[MISC Italy’s  ] foreign policy remained strongly Atlanticist ; [PER Berlusconi  ] , according to [PER Massari  ] , had meant to be constructive and wanted to take a positive role in creating understanding between its key strategic partners , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
The comments had not been meant to criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG A/DCM  ] countered that the PM’s statements risked damaging to our efforts to bring stability to the [LOC Balkans  ] by calling into question the basis for [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence - a process that [LOC Italy  ] had been a part of from the beginning . 
Additionally , [PER Berlusconi  ] , s comments ran headlong into sensitive negotiations with [LOC Russia  ] on confidence building measures , as well as [MISC Czech  ] and [MISC Polish  ] internal deliberations on ratification of [LOC Missile Defense  ] . 
By characterizing [MISC Ukrainian  ] and [MISC Georgian  ] [ORG NATO  ] aspirations as inherently threatening to [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Berlusconi  ] was casting doubt on a process which had produced significant reforms in aspirant countries that are looking to join the community of democratic nations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG A/DCM  ] told [PER Massari  ] that the [ORG GOI  ] gave every appearance that the [LOC U.S.  ] was experiencing a power vacuum . 
The current administration was still in charge , and the incoming one had made that abundantly clear . 
By encouraging his own government and [LOC Russia  ] to speak past the current administration and offer ‘advice’ to the President-Elect , [PER Berlusconi  ] was losing credibility for [LOC Italy  ] as a reliable partner , which he could ill afford to do , given the challenges ahead of us in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere . 
[ORG A/DCM  ] added that the new administration would conduct its own diplomacy and would not need [PER Berlusconi  ] as ‘a bridge’ to engage in a dialogue with [LOC Russia  ] on either a bilateral or multilateral basis. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Massari  ] , in obvious discomfort , said he ‘fully understood’ the [LOC U.S.  ] perspective on [PER Berlusconi  ] , s recent stream of commentary , said he would take this message back to FM [PER Frattini  ] in detail . 
He also asked for our thoughts on how to avoid any further ‘misunderstandings’ of this nature . 
He said he would recommend that the FM make a statement clarifying [MISC Italy’s  ] support for [LOC Kosovo  ] and [ORG NATO  ] expansion . 
He also said he would advise the FM to talk to [PER Berlusconi  ] about the degree to which his comments on the [LOC US/Russia  ] relationship , [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC MD  ] and other issues had irritated [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG A/DCM  ] ended the conversation by suggesting that PM refrain from making any further offers to guide the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration in its relationship with [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment . 
All of our interlocutors were at visible pains to underscore that they understood the PM’s comments in [LOC Izmir  ] had crossed the line . 
All , however , particularly party officials , reiterated that [PER Berlusconi  ] does not listen to the advice of his own experts in crafting his approach with other states . 
On [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Berlusconi  ] takes this to an extreme , not only conducting his own brand of foreign policy , but on a tactical basis , as a way of gaining favor with his [MISC Russian  ] interlocutors - with whom many ( including his own party officials ) suspect he has a personally and financially enriching relationship . 
All of our contacts stated that it might be difficult to reign him in and , somewhat fatalistically , encouraged us to ignore his comments . 
One senior [ORG MFA  ] official went so far as to suggest Ambassador take up the issue directly with [PER Berlusconi  ] and asked us to let her know what [PER Berlusconi  ] offered as his justification for his remarks , since , she said , she had no insight whatsoever as to what had animated his remarks on [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC MD.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) It will be all the more important that [PER Berlusconi  ] and his advisors hear a similarly blunt warning about the direction of [LOC Italy  ] , s [LOC Russia  ] policy during in any bilats or pull-asides on the margins of the upcoming [MISC G-20  ] summit .
