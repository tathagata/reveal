[PER David Stang  ] , brother of murdered [LOC US  ] citizen nun [PER Dorothy Stang  ] , visiting [LOC Brazil  ] this week , told Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] that while pleased with GoB reaction to his sister 's death he believed it important that the [MISC Brazilian  ] federal government take over from the state authorities the investigation and prosecution of the case .

Three [ORG FBI  ] investigators traveled to the crime scene in recent days ; the [LOC Washington DC U.S. Attorney  ] 's Office will present the evidence collected to a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Grand Jury  ] , seeking indictments of all four suspects . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] met with [PER David Stang  ] , brother of murdered nun [PER Dorothy Stang  ] ; [PER Daniel Junge  ] , traveling with [PER Stang  ] to film a documentary ; and Sister [PER Mary Ellis McCabe  ] , a member of Sister [PER Dorothy  ] 's order , stationed in [LOC Ceara  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , at dinner at the Ambassador 's residence March 2 . 
( PolCouns , CG , and Special Ass't also attended the dinner . 
) [PER Stang  ] and [PER Junge  ] were in [LOC Brasilia  ] to meet with Minister of [ORG Justice  ] [PER Marcio Thomaz Bastos  ] after visiting the site of [PER Stang  ] 's sister 's murder in [LOC Para  ] state . 
[PER Stang  ] thanked the Ambassador for the [ORG Embassy  ] 's support and said that he was pleased with the [MISC Brazilian  ] federal government 's reaction . 
He was very critical , however , of [LOC Para  ] state authorities for failing to protect his sister and for failing to offer their condolences during his visit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Stang  ] believes that much of the progress made so far in the case is due to federal involvement and was disappointed at a recent statement from federal [ORG Justice  ] Minister [PER Bastos  ] saying that it was best to allow state authorities prosecute the case . 
[PER Stang  ] believes that state officials are too closely tied to the landed interests responsible for his sister 's death to pursue the case vigorously . 
We encouraged him to raise these concerns with the minister. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Stang  ] was scheduled to meet with Minister [PER Bastos  ] March 3 . 
[ORG Embassy  ] confirmed the appointment , but was not asked to attend . 
[PER Stang  ] and [PER Junge  ] depart on the evening of March 3 for the [LOC U.S.  ] 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Federal Police contacts working the case told [PER Legatt  ] they believed the international spotlight was strong enough to ensure that state officials would successfully prosecute the four suspects ( reftel B ) , but that federal involvement would be necessary to carry the investigation further ( i.e. , to powerful landowners who may have ordered the murder , or tacitly agreed to it ) . . 
Legislation passed in December 2004 as part of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ongoing judicial reform gives the federal government the right to federalize human rights cases that would otherwise be left to the states . 
In addition , the federal government probably has jurisdiction over the case simply because the murder apparently took place on federal land . 
Homicide in [LOC Brazil  ] carries a sentence of 12 to 30 years . 
( Comment: We are somewhat mystified by [PER Bastos'  ] reluctance to take over the case given the high- level federal involvement so far and the opportunity to use the murder as a test case for the new " federalization " law . 
End comment ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Washington DC U.S. Attorney  ] 's Office , [ORG Transnational Crime Unit  ] , is pursuing an indictment of the four individuals ( three in custody , one at large ) by using [ORG Title  ] 18 , [ORG USC  ] 2332 , a statute on International Homicide . 
The key elements of this statute require 1 ) the victim be a [LOC U.S.  ] citizen , 2 ) that the murder take place outside the [LOC US  ] , and 3 ) that the murder was carried out to influence , pressure , or coerce a government or civilian group . 
[PER Stang  ] 's murder meets all the key elements. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In recent days , three [ORG FBI  ] investigators ( one [MISC Brazil-  ] and two [MISC U.S.-based  ] agents ) traveled to the scene of the crime in the state of [LOC Para  ] and collected reports , photographs , and video from the [MISC Brazilian  ] investigating authorities . 
The [ORG FBI  ] investigators also interviewed the three subjects currently in [MISC Brazilian  ] custody . 
A fourth subject remains at large . 
One refused to talk and two restated their involvement in the murder . 
Based on the [ORG FBI  ] interviews , coupled with the evidence collected by the [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities , the [ORG U.S. Attorney 's Office  ] will present its case before a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Grand Jury  ] for indictment - probably during [MISC March.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although an extradition treaty is in place , [LOC Brazil  ] 's constitution prohibits the extradition of [MISC Brazilian  ] citizens . 
If a [LOC U.S.  ] grand jury returns an indictment against the four suspects , they can only be extradited if they depart [LOC Brazil  ] for a country that has a bilateral extradition treaty with the [LOC US  ] . 
If the individuals accused of this crime remain in [LOC Brazil  ] there is no expectation that they will be prosecuted in the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [LOC Para  ] state authorities have made progress by capturing three of four suspects in the [PER Stang  ] murder . 
Nevertheless , post shares the belief expressed by a wide variety of observers that successful investigation and prosecution will be much more likely if the [MISC Brazilian  ] federal government takes over the case .
