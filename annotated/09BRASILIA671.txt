( U ) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Your visit comes at a time when the relationship between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] is accelerating and being given added weight with the rapid growth of [LOC Brazil  ] 's regional and global economic and political clout . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has assumed a larger role in promoting regional stability by leading the [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping contingent in [LOC Haiti  ] and views itself as a potential member of an expanded [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
Through the financial crisis , [LOC Brazil  ] has played a leading role globally in the [ORG G20  ] and also led efforts to conclude the [LOC Doha  ] round of [ORG World Trade Organization  ] ( [ORG WTO  ] ) negotiations . 
Further , the country has the potential to play a major role in promoting global energy security . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] government seeks to develop a global market for biofuels and also to bring into production its vast , new off-shore oil and gas discoveries . 
In spite of its relatively clean energy matrix , [LOC Brazil  ] is a major carbon dioxide emitter , largely as a result of deforestation , which makes it a critical player in the discussion on climate change . 
Your visit presents an opportunity to underline our strong interest in continuing to expand our cooperation , including in areas such as counterterrorism and combating transnational crime . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. ------------------ Political Overview ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) With democracy re-established in 1988 after a period of military dictatorship , [LOC Brazil  ] 's democratic institutions are generally strong and stable . 
President [PER Lula  ] remains a popular president - one of the most popular in [LOC Brazil  ] 's history and indeed in the world today , with recent approval ratings as high as 78% - as a result of his orthodox economic policies and expanded social programs . 
In the [MISC Congress  ] , ongoing public scandals involving the leadership of the [ORG Senate  ] and various members of congress have led to low ratings for the institution among the [MISC Brazilian  ] public . 
Increasingly , the court system has taken steps to curb impunity among public officials . 
These steps have been well received by a public accustomed to abuses by authorities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] share the basic goals of fostering hemispheric stability and preventing terrorist and drug transit activity . 
The attainment of a permanent seat on the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] has been a central goal of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy under President [PER Lula  ] 's government . 
Regionally , [PER Lula  ] has maintained [LOC Brazil  ] 's historic focus on stability , seeing dialogue and good relations with all parties as the best way to achieve this goal . 
As a result , [LOC Brazil  ] maintains an active dialogue with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , has worked to foster good relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] , has given its assistance in resolving the [ORG FARC  ] hostage crisis in [LOC Colombia  ] , and has stood firmly on the principle of respect for sovereignty in the region. ------------------------- Counterterrorism Overview ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] government continues to be a cooperative partner in countering terrorism and related activities that could contribute to the facilitation of attacks in the region or elsewhere--to include investigating potential terrorism financing , document forgery networks , and other illicit activity . 
Operationally , elements of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government responsible for combating terrorism , such as the [ORG Federal Police  ] , Customs , and the [ORG Brazilian Intelligence Agency  ] , effectively work with their [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts and diligently pursue investigative leads provided by [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence , law enforcement and financial agencies regarding terrorist suspects . 
The senior levels of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , however , publicly deny the possibility that terrorist groups or individuals connected to such groups operate or transit through [MISC Brazilian  ] soil and vigorously protests any claims made by [LOC U.S.  ] authorities to the contrary . 
AREAS OF CONCERN: [LOC SAO PAULO  ] , [LOC TRIBORDER AREA  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's intelligence and law enforcement services are concerned that terrorists could exploit [MISC Brazilian  ] territory to support and facilitate terrorist attacks , whether domestically or abroad , and have focused their efforts in the areas of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ( where the vast majority of [LOC Brazil  ] 's estimated 1.2-1.5 million [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000671 002 OF 007 [MISC Muslims  ] live ) , the triborder areas of [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] ; [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Peru  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] ; and the [MISC Colombian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] borders . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's recognition of the potential threat from terrorism prompted a reform of the [ORG Brazilian Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG ABIN  ] ) that raised the profile of the issue by upgrading the counterterrorism division to the department level and establishing the [MISC Brazilian  ] Intelligence System ( [ORG SISBIN  ] ) -- an [MISC NCTC-like  ] entity within [ORG ABIN  ] to coordinate intelligence gathering and sharing across the [ORG GOB.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As [LOC Brazil  ] has focused resources on monitoring and suppressing illegal activity in the [LOC Triborder Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) of [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] , during the past decade , the government has achieved visible results from its investments in border and law enforcement infrastructure that were executed with a view to gradually control the flow of goods--legal and illegal--through the [ORG TBA  ] , the proceeds of which could be diverted to support terror groups . 
The inspection station at the [LOC Friendship Bridge  ] in the [ORG TBA  ] that was completed by [MISC Brazilian  ] Customs ( [ORG Receita Federal  ] ) in 2007 has continued to take effective action to suppress the smuggling of drugs , weapons , and contraband goods along the border with [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
According to [MISC Brazilian  ] Customs ( [ORG Receita Federal  ] ) in 2008 the agency interdicted more than $76 million in smuggled goods , including drugs , weapons , and munitions , an increase of eight percent from 2007 . 
As a result of the effective crackdown on the [LOC Friendship Bridge  ] , most smuggling operations now take place through the [LOC Parana River  ] and [LOC Lago Itaipu  ] and some have migrated to other sections of the border such as the towns of [LOC Guiara  ] and [LOC Ponta Pora  ] . 
The [ORG Federal Police  ] has [ORG Special Maritime Police Units  ] in both [MISC Foz  ] de [MISC Iguacu  ] and [LOC Guaira  ] that aggressively patrol the maritime border areas but because of the scale and complexity of the endeavor to curtail smuggling and trafficking activities through the waterways , [LOC Brazil  ] is currently considering using an [ORG Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  ] to assist law enforcement in monitoring the border , a development that could further improve border security . 
INTERNATIONAL AND BILATERAL COOPERATION <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's intelligence and law enforcement forces work closely with regional and international partners . 
In 2008 , [ORG ABIN  ] hosted a multilateral conference on counterterrorism involving the security services of several [MISC South American  ] countries . 
Also in 2008 , the [ORG Federal Police  ] and [ORG ABIN  ] , together with the [ORG United Nations Organization for Crime and Drugs  ] , co-hosted an international conference on terrorism finance . 
In addition , [LOC Brazil  ] actively participates in international counterterrorism fora such as the 3+1 [ORG Mechanism on Security  ] in the [LOC Triborder Area  ] , [LOC Mercosul  ] 's [ORG Working Group  ] on Terrorism and the [ORG Subworking Group  ] on [ORG Financial Issues  ] , the latter of which discusses terrorism financing and money laundering among the [LOC Mercosul  ] countries. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Bilaterally , the [ORG USG  ] provided a variety of training courses throughout [LOC Brazil  ] in counterterrorism , combating money laundering , detection of travel document fraud , container security , and international organized crime . 
In 2008 , [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] began exchanging information on critical infrastructure protection issues. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) In 2008 , the [ORG GOB  ] and the [ORG USG  ] continued to work together through the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] in [LOC Santos  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] to promote secure containerized cargo to the [LOC United States  ] and through the establishment of a [ORG Trade Transparency Unit  ] to detect money laundering through trade transactions . 
TERRORISM FINANCING , MONEY LAUDERING <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] is capable of monitoring domestic financial operations and effectively utilizes its financial intelligence unit , the [ORG Financial Activities Oversight Council  ] ( [ORG COAF  ] ) to identify possible funding sources for terrorist groups . 
Through the [ORG COAF  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] has carried out name checks for persons and entities on the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1267 and 1373 terror finance lists , but has so far not found any assets , accounts or property in the names of persons or entities on the [ORG UN  ] terror-finance lists . 
12 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] also continues to undertake steps to enhance its capabilities to combat money laundering . 
Since 2003 , fifteen specialized money laundering courts have been established , including two in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , with each court headed by a judge who receives specialized training in national money laundering legislation . 
In addition , in 2008 , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] established a [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000671 003 OF 007 working group with money laundering judges to share best practices and training needs. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) A 2006 national anti-money laundering strategy goal was formed aimed to build on the success of the specialized courts by creating complementary specialized federal police financial crimes units in the same jurisdictions . 
In 2008 , the [ORG Federal Police  ] established such units in the [ORG Federal District  ] ( [LOC Brasilia  ] ) , and the states of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Sco Paulo  ] . 
In addition , the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] funded the creation of technology centers to combat money laundering in the [ORG Federal District  ] and [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , the latter of which received two such centers , one embedded with the [ORG Public Ministry  ] and one with the state [ORG Civil Police  ] . 
In 2008 , the [ORG Ministry signed  ] accords to establish additional centers in [LOC Bahia  ] , [PER Goias  ] , and [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul . 
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall commitment to combating terrorism and the illicit activities that could be exploited to facilitate terrorism is undermined by the [ORG GOB  ] 's failure to significantly strengthen its legal counterterrorism framework . 
Two key [MISC CT-related  ] legislative initiatives continued to languish in 2008 . 
An anti-terrorism bill that would have established the crime of terrorism and other associated crimes was drafted but shelved before its introduction in [ORG Congress  ] and a long-delayed anti-money laundering bill has not been approved by [ORG Congress  ] . 
If passed , the latter bill would facilitate greater law enforcement access to financial and banking records during investigations , criminalize illicit enrichment , allow administrative freezing of assets , and facilitate prosecutions of money laundering cases by amending the legal definition of money laundering and making it an autonomous offense. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] government has also been willing to accept the political cost of taking positions that undermine its commitment to combating terrorism . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has angered [LOC Israel  ] over its refusal to condemn the actions of [ORG HAMAS  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] or to consider them terrorist groups , while at the same time senior government officials have called [LOC Israel  ] 's action 's " State terrorism " . 
In 2006 [LOC Brazil  ] upset [LOC Colombia  ] by granting refugee status to the [ORG FARC  ] 's international representative in [LOC Brazil  ] , whose extradition for murder was sought by the [MISC Colombian  ] government . 
In 2007 , the suggestion that planning for the 1994 bombing of [LOC AMIA  ] , an [MISC Argentine Jewish  ] center , might have taken place in [LOC Brazil  ] caused the [ORG GoB  ] to abstain in an international vote over whether to issue [ORG Interpol  ] warrants for [MISC Iranian  ] officials accused in the case , an action that disappointed and irritated [LOC Argentina  ] . 
And in a case that is currently pending before the [MISC Brazilian  ] Supreme Court , in 2008 the [ORG GOB  ] granted refugee status to an [MISC Italian  ] leftist terrorist wanted in connection for four murders , creating a row between the two countries. ---------------------- [ORG Law Enforcement Issues  ] ---------------------- CYBERCRIME <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] is an [MISC OAS  ] leader in addressing cybercrime and has worked with other [MISC South American  ] states to push forward Cyber threat issues in cooperation with [ORG DOJ  ] 's [ORG Criminal Division  ] 's [ORG Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section  ] . 
Additionally , [LOC Brazil  ] is a member of the [ORG G-8  ] 's 24/7 [ORG High Tech Crime Network  ] . 
The 24/7 Network enables member states to assist each other to quickly identify and preserve electronic evidence located in another state. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG DPF  ] is moving towards an intelligence-driven , proactive investigative force with initiatives to combat Cyber Intrusion crimes particularly committed against the financial sector ; crimes in the proliferation of child pornography/child sexual exploitation facilitated by online computer users ; and in general crimes via the internet. ------------------- [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] ------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The first potential watershed in achieving a more robust defense relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] will be the decision on a next generation fighter aircraft . 
[ORG Boeing  ] 's [MISC F-18 Super  ] Hornet is a finalist along with the [MISC French  ] [ORG Rafale  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG Gripen  ] . 
A [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000671 004 OF 007 decision will be made in June 2009 , with a final contract award in October . 
It would be difficult to overstate the significance of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Air Force  ] committing to a [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft as its primary fighter for the next generation . 
[ORG Boeing  ] 's proposal combines cutting-edge technology with a strong package of industrial cooperation . 
To be successful , [ORG Boeing  ] will have to make a strong case that its offset package offers economic benefits to [LOC Brazil  ] far greater than its competitors. ----------------------- Expanding Economic Ties ----------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] is the tenth largest economy in the world and received investment grade from [LOC Standard  ] and [ORG Poor 's  ] and [ORG Fitch  ] in 2008 . 
Annual Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) grew 5.1 percent in 2008 , and inflation was 5.8% . 
Prospects for 2009 have been dimmed by the global economic crisis , taking previous predictions for annual GDP growth from 4 per cent to .01 percent with some analysts predicting a recession . 
Despite this decline in immediate prospects , [LOC Brazil  ] has thus far weathered the crisis better than most major economies , due in large part to its conservative macroeconomic policies. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) Despite progress in recent years , income distribution in [LOC Brazil  ] remains grossly unequal , with 10 percent of the population holding over 50 percent of the nation 's wealth . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is home to 50 percent of the people who live in extreme poverty in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
President [PER Lula  ] 's social programs , combined with formal sector job growth and real increases in the minimum wage , have reduced income inequalities each year since 2004. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) Major structural challenges to long-term growth include a complicated and onerous tax structure , high interest rates , and cumbersome labor and business regulations . 
As a result of its regulatory structure , [LOC Brazil  ] ranks 125th in the [ORG World Bank Group  ] 's Doing Business assessment of regulatory climate in 181 countries . 
The informal sector ( one of the largest among large developing economies ) constitutes an estimated 40 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy , in large part in response to the onerous tax and regulatory requirements to participate in the formal economy. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] is a major producer and exporter . 
Agriculture makes up 36 percent of exports , and the agribusiness sector accounts for 25 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's GDP . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is a leading exporter of soybeans , beef , sugar , coffee , and orange juice . 
[LOC Brazil  ] also distinguishes itself as a major exporter of civilian aircraft , steel , and petrochemicals . 
The [LOC United States  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's top trading partner , and [LOC China  ] has moved into position as number two . 
[LOC Brazil  ] was a significant leader in the [ORG World Trade Organization  ] 's [LOC Doha Round  ] negotiations and was active in trying to broker a deal between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC India.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] is the tenth largest economy in the world and received investment grade from [LOC Standard  ] and [ORG Poor 's  ] and [ORG Fitch  ] in 2008 . 
Annual Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) grew 5.1 percent in 2008 , and inflation was 5.8% . 
Prospects for 2009 have been dimmed by the global economic crisis , taking previous predictions for annual GDP growth from 4 per cent to .01 percent with some analysts predicting a recession . 
Despite this decline in immediate prospects , [LOC Brazil  ] has thus far weathered the crisis better than most major economies , due in large part to its conservative macroeconomic policies. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( U ) In recognition of [LOC Brazil  ] 's growing importance as a world economy , the [LOC U.S.  ] government seeks opportunities for positive bilateral cooperation on economic issues . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] are in discussions over a possible Bilateral Tax Treaty . 
After both countries agreed in June 2008 to significantly expand civil aviation opportunities , two [LOC U.S.  ] airlines were granted approval for 21 new frequencies . 
Further frequency allocations for 2009 under the agreement have been tentatively allocated. ----------------------- Global Financial Crisis ----------------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( U ) The global financial crisis has affected [MISC Brazilian  ] companies' exports and access to credit . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's Finance Minister continues to assert that [LOC Brazil  ] is well-positioned to weather the crisis while he and [ORG Central Bank  ] contacts confirm moves to try to mitigate the effects of the crisis . 
President [PER Lula  ] , taking a leading role in the debt over how to handle the economic crisis [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000671 005 OF 007 including through the [LOC G20  ] process , has criticized actors in developed countries for sparking a crisis that affects developing countries . 
He has called for increased regulation of the global financial system , increased global access to trade finance , and an expanded role for large emerging countries like [LOC Brazil  ] in international financial institutions such as the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] ( [ORG IMF  ] ) . 
Presidents [PER Lula  ] and [PER Obama  ] agreed to work together to advance our common interests through the [LOC G20  ] process and have established working groups to that end. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( U ) Over the past quarter [LOC Brazil  ] has posted a series of poor economic results that confirm the country will not escape the current global financial crisis unscathed . 
A February 3 report detailing a 14.5 percent drop in industrial output in December 2008 versus December 2007 ( the biggest drop in 17 years ) , finally prompted President [PER Lula  ] to admit that his country 's economy may be contracting . 
The government has reacted to the economic downturn thus far with a series of piecemeal announcements and actions aimed at increasing liquidity in the banking system , stimulating growth through a series of targeted tax cuts , and seeking to shore up exports . 
President [PER Lula  ] has announced his intention to develop a comprehensive response plan for release in the coming weeks . 
However , details still remain under interagency discussion. ------ Energy ------ AREA FOR COOPERATION: BIOFUELS <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( U ) For [LOC Brazil  ] , turning ethanol into a world commodity is a key aspect of increasing energy security . 
Though [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol is produced from sugar cane , [LOC Brazil  ] sees expansion of the global ethanol market , regardless of feed stock , as a key interest . 
In March 2007 , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] signed a Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) on biofuels cooperation . 
As a result , scientists and laboratories from the two countries are collaboratively researching next generation biofuels technologies . 
We are also working together in various multilateral fora to develop international biofuels standards and sustainability criteria . 
By making it easier to treat biofuels as a tradable commodity , these standards should foster the emergence of a vibrant global biofuels market. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( U ) The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are jointly assisting a group of developing countries in creating their own biofuel markets , with the goal of reducing their dependence on imported oil . 
The joint cooperative effort initially targeted four countries: [LOC Haiti  ] , [LOC St. Kitts  ] , [LOC El Salvador  ] , and the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] . 
In November 2008 , five new countries joined the group: [LOC Guatemala  ] , [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] , [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Jamaica  ] , and [LOC Senegal  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would like to see the [LOC United States  ] aggressively expand these cooperation efforts to include developing countries in [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] , both as a development tool and as a way to increase the commodity market for ethanol. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( U ) Modest tax breaks have stimulated the [MISC Brazilian  ] domestic ethanol market and have led new car purchasers to opt overwhelmingly for " flex-fuel " cars that can run on gasoline , ethanol , or any combination of the two . 
In 2008 , ethanol surpassed gasoline as the dominant automotive fuel . 
Domestic demand consumes 85 percent of all production . 
The other 15 percent is exported , primarily to the [LOC United States  ] , making our ethanol import surcharge a continuing irritant in bilateral relations . 
The [ORG GOB  ] also uses mandates to promote greater use of biodiesel . 
VAST OIL AND GAS DISCOVERIES <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( U ) The discovery in 2007 of potentially massive offshore ( " pre-salt " ) reserves of oil and gas estimated to contain between 30-80 billion barrels of oil equivalent could put [LOC Brazil  ] within the top ten oil countries by reserves . 
Though the discoveries have generated a great deal of excitement , industry observers caution that developments will probably be slow in coming due to the expensive technological challenges involved with ultra-deepwater drilling , including a worldwide shortage of equipment such as drilling rigs. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( U ) [ORG Petrobras  ] is hamstrung by limited equipment resources . 
However , it has launched a multi-billion dollar procurement [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000671 006 OF 007 initiative and is reexamining its international priorities so that it can focus on domestic opportunities , though it remains to be seen how the global financial crisis will may affect those plans . 
[LOC U.S.  ] oil companies are poised and ready , in many cases , to take on more exploration opportunities . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is currently reexamining its oil sector structure to make the most use of these finds . 
Interim reports suggest that the [ORG GOB  ] may be leaning towards developing a state-owned company to manage the rights to the oil fields as they contract out the exploration . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has expressed interest in having [LOC U.S.  ] companies involved in the exploitation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's oil reserves . 
FURTHER ENHANCING ENERGY COOPERATION <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] have many other common areas of interest in the energy sector . 
The convergence of our interests offers opportunities to enhance both countries' national energy security . 
Building on the success of the biofuels relationship , [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] have identified three new areas of possible collaboration under a preexisting Memorandum of Understanding between the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy and Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] and established new working groups in the areas of energy efficiency , clean coal , and nuclear energy . 
The [LOC United States  ] also has commercial interests , particularly in nuclear energy , as [LOC Brazil  ] looks to expand its civilian nuclear energy program . 
For example , [PER Westinghouse  ] is in the running to build four to eight new nuclear reactors in [LOC Brazil  ] over the next ten years. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( U ) The [LOC United States  ] would like to parlay these and other shared interests into support for a hemispheric energy partnership . 
There are many opportunities for joint cooperation including research and development , energy efficiency , and green technologies . 
It is important that prominent [MISC Brazilian  ] policymakers perceive the level of importance the USG accords to this efforts . 
Any appropriate opportunities for the delegation to reinforce this message would be invaluable as we pursue this major policy initiative. ---------------------------------- The [ORG Environment and Climate Change  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] pursues two sometimes-conflicting goals with regard to the [LOC Amazon  ] region . 
On the one hand , it seeks to preserve the natural resources and biodiversity found there . 
To that end , the government requires landowners to preserve eighty percent of forest on their lands and has placed large amounts of the forest into protected areas , such as national parks and indigenous reserves . 
At the same time , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government seeks economic growth and redistribution of land . 
Thus , since the 1970s it has built a network of roads through the [LOC Amazon  ] , which has opened the region to timber and agriculture ( mainly cattle and soybean ) interests. <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( U ) Massive and ongoing clearing of the [LOC Amazon Forest  ] releases large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . 
The [ORG GOB  ] estimates that about 75 percent of the country 's green house gas emissions come from changes in land use and deforestation . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has stepped up enforcement efforts to stop illegal clearing and has displayed great interest in the use of programs which pay people to avoid deforestation . 
These efforts , combined with a drop in agriculture commodity prices , are expected to result in a significant decrease in the deforestation rate this year . 
In December 2008 , the [ORG GOB  ] announced a domestic goal of reducing the deforestation rate by about half by 2017 . 
In international climate change negotiations , [LOC Brazil  ] has been far less bold and innovative , contending that only developed countries should be required to assume emission reduction targets. ---------------------- [ORG Goldman Abduction Case  ] ---------------------- <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( U ) [MISC American  ] [PER David Goldman  ] is currently pursuing a [ORG Hague Abduction Case  ] , involving his son [PER Sean  ] who was brought to [LOC Brazil  ] by his mother and wrongfully retained here over 4 years ago . 
The case has been remanded to the 16th [ORG Federal Court  ] in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
The [ORG Court  ] has two cases before it: the return motion from Mr. [PER Goldman  ] under the [ORG Hague Convention  ] on [ORG International Child Abduction  ] , and the custody motion by [PER Sean  ] 's [MISC Brazilian  ] stepfather which was originally filed in a [LOC Rio  ] state court . 
The Ambassador and numerous elements within the Mission have been working firmly but quietly behind the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000671 007 OF 007 scenes to remind the [ORG GOB  ] of its obligations under the [ORG Hague Convention  ] . 
We are cautiously optimistic that the move to the [ORG Federal Court  ] will result in a more just decision on the [ORG Hague  ] case . 
We remain in constant touch with [PER David Goldman  ] and his [MISC Brazilian  ] attorney to ensure that their interests are represented effectively in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
A decision may be announced soon.</pre></code>
