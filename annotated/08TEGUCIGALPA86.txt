( C ) Summary: Local media report President [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] will sign an agreement today ( January 28 ) to import [MISC Venezuelan  ] fuel on concessional terms through [ORG Petrocaribe  ] . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] reportedly signed the agreement in [LOC Caracas  ] over the weekend . 
The [MISC Honduran  ] [ORG Congress  ] approved the outlines of an agreement January 24 , even though President of [ORG Congress  ] [PER Roberto Micheletti  ] is known to oppose a [ORG Petrocaribe  ] deal . 
However , key details were left undefined , and [ORG Post  ] understands [ORG Congress  ] will still need to approve the actual contract -- if one exists -- before it can take effect . 
Embassy considers this back and forth over [ORG Petrocaribe  ] to be part of the ongoing [MISC Honduran  ] political theater . 
It may or may not result in the supply of [MISC Venezuelan  ] oil to [LOC Honduras  ] . 
But it will definitely affect the balance of [PER Zelaya  ] 's term and the campaign to succeed him in 2009 . 
Meanwhile , we suspect the political price for this [MISC Venezuelan  ] " free lunch " is already being collected . 
End Summary. ------------------------------- [PER Zelaya  ] to Sign [ORG Petrocaribe  ] Deal ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [MISC Honduran  ] news media reported January 28 that President [PER Chavez  ] signed the draft [ORG PetroCaribe  ] agreement , discussed during his January 15 visit to [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] ( ref C ) , over the weekend at the conclusion of the sixth [ORG Bolivarian Alternative  ] for the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG ALBA  ] ) summit in [LOC Caracas  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Milton Jimenez  ] , who attended the summit as an observer , has reportedly brought the agreement back to [LOC Honduras  ] for [PER Zelaya  ] to sign . 
[PER Zelaya  ] told the press he would sign it Monday ( January 28 ) . ---------------- What 's the Deal ? ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to press reports and Embassy sources , the two-year deal would initially involve purchase of 100 percent of the bunker fuel ( heavy fuel oil ) that [LOC Honduras  ] uses to generate 70 percent of its electricity , with automotive fuel possibly to be included later . 
Presentations to [ORG Congress  ] and to donors imply the [ORG GOH  ] would incur [MISC USD  ] 345 million in debt during the first year of the deal , of which [MISC USD  ] 285 million is expected to fall during 2008 ( implying fuel supply would commence in April ) . 
[LOC Honduras  ] would be required to pay 60 percent within 90 days , with the balance financed at 1 percent interest over 25 years with a two-year grace period . 
During his visit , [PER Chavez  ] said at least part of the bill could be paid in milk or other agricultural commodities , although [MISC Honduran  ] agriculture reps have said the country does not currently have an exportable supply. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [ORG Liberal Party Congressman  ] [PER Jose Azcona  ] , a close associate of [ORG Congressional  ] leader [PER Micheletti  ] , as originally proposed by [PER Zelaya  ] 's team in November ( ref B ) , the deal contemplated importing 100 percent of bunker fuel and 30 percent of automotive fuel . 
The deal currently being discussed is limited to bunker , possibly to comply with a debt ceiling being negotiated with the [ORG IMF  ] ( ref D ) or possibly because of logistical and legal obstacles to importing gasoline and diesel. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The proceeds to the [ORG GOH  ] from the deal ( from acquiring the fuel with 60 percent down , then selling it to power plants at full price ) are to be put into a trust fund at the [ORG Central Bank  ] , to be used for investments under the supervision of a " committee of notables . 
" Thirty percent would be used to recapitalize the ailing state electric utility [ORG ENEE  ] , 40 percent to construct hydroelectric plants and 30 percent for " social investments , " primarily in agriculture . 
The trust fund idea appears to be in part to satisfy the [ORG IMF  ] ( which wants the funds to be used only for productive investment and prefers that they be sequestered at the [ORG Central Bank  ] ) , in part to satisfy domestic critics in [ORG Congress  ] and the private sector ( who have criticized the principle of incurring debt for consumption ) and in part to coopt certain private-sector leaders by giving them authority to spend the funds. ------------------------------------------ Cure for what Ails [ORG Honduran Energy Sector  ] ? ------------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Honduras  ] faces fiscal crises both in electricity supply and maintaining subsidies for automotive fuel . 
[ORG ENEE  ] is losing an estimated [MISC USD  ] 300 million a year , roughly 3 percent of GDP ( ref A ) . 
[ORG ENEE  ] 's rates , despite recent increases , do not cover costs , and arrears to private power producers are estimated at 6 billion lempiras ( [MISC USD  ] 317 million ) . 
[PER Enrique Flores Lanza  ] , formerly [ORG Presidential Legal Advisor  ] and now Minister of the Presidency , recently said the [ORG GOH  ] was spending 10 million lempiras a day ( [MISC USD  ] 194 million a year ) to subsidize gasoline and diesel fuel -- another 2 percent of GDP . 
President [PER Zelaya  ] has said publicly that his administration cannot maintain fuel subsidies without a [ORG PetroCaribe  ] deal . 
He is running political ads on local [MISC TV  ] taking credit for keeping pump prices low and seeking support for " further measures " to keep them that way -- a clear reference to [ORG Petrocaribe.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , we understand [ORG Petrocaribe  ] requires that proceeds be used for anti-poverty programs and public investments , not subsidies or current spending , and the [ORG GOH  ] has committed to the [ORG IMF  ] and to [ORG Congress  ] that it will comply with those terms ( see above ) . 
In fact , [PER Zelaya  ] 's own new [ORG ENEE  ] director , [PER Ricci Moncada  ] , stated to [MISC TV  ] reporters ( carried January 28 ) that a [ORG Petrocaribe  ] deal would not affect pump prices but contribute to investments for long-term economic growth. --------------------------------------------- ----- Political Theater -- Will [ORG Congress  ] Approve a Deal ? --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Political sources , including those close to former President and [ORG Liberal Party  ] kingmaker [PER Carlos Flores  ] , tell us that [PER Zelaya  ] had hoped to sign a [ORG PetroCaribe  ] deal during [PER Chavez  ] 's January 15 visit . 
However , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] delegation reportedly balked on the grounds that too many logistical details were undefined , and [PER Chavez  ] did not want to be blamed if he could not implement the deal . 
[PER Zelaya  ] then sent to [ORG Congress  ] a draft boilerplate agreement , void of details , hoping [ORG Congress  ] would reject it . 
That would have allowed [PER Zelaya  ] to blame [ORG Congress  ] when he inevitably has to raise pump prices in the near future . 
He reportedly even asked [PER Micheletti  ] to " stick it in the drawer " until details could be fleshed out . 
Instead [PER Micheletti  ] , a political rival of [PER Zelaya  ] 's and a leading aspirant to succeed him in 2009 , pushed the decree through the [ORG Congress  ] January 24 . 
This put the ball back in [PER Zelaya  ] 's court , placing the onus on him to negotiate a viable agreement that meets the country 's pressing energy needs while staying within [ORG IMF  ] parameters. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We suspect this latest turn in [PER Zelaya  ] 's on-again , off-again flirtation with [ORG PetroCaribe  ] reflects: -- his unwillingness to take needed steps to rationalize the energy sector , or desire to assign political blame for those steps to others ( by sending an unworkable [ORG Petrocaribe  ] deal to [ORG Congress  ] , then , when they reject it , blaming them for what follows ) , -- an effort to energize his populist base by aligning himself more closely with [PER Chavez  ] , and -- per ref D , an effort to secure enough cash to skate through the final two years of his Presidency . 
[PER Zelaya  ] may also think he can evade the conditions of both [ORG Petrocaribe  ] and other donors and divert the funds to cover current spending , for corrupt ends or for the political campaign of his preferred successor , [PER Patricia Rodas.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As for why [PER Chavez  ] waited until 10 days after his visit to sign the agreement , we strongly suspect this was to extract the political " price " for the deal . 
This came in the form of: 1 ) participation as an observer at the [ORG ALBA  ] summit , and 2 ) stating publicly that [LOC Honduras  ] does not consider [LOC Colombia  ] 's [ORG FARC  ] to be a terrorist group ( ref D ) .
