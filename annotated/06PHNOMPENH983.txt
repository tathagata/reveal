( U ) SUMMARY: May 19 and 20 arrests of two [MISC Taiwanese  ] nationals attempting to smuggle a total of nearly 7 kg of heroin to [LOC Taiwan  ] highlight increased drug arrests and seizures in [LOC Cambodia  ] . 
The quantity of heroin seized during the weekend airport busts is large by [MISC Cambodian  ] standards--authorities seized just 11 kg of heroin in 2005 . 
Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants are more than double last year’s levels . 
Police and international observers credit USG and other foreign training with providing skills , motivation , and international pressure for the increase , but say that narcotics trafficking may also be on the rise . 
END SUMMARY . 
Heroin Seizures at [LOC Phnom Penh  ] [LOC International Airport  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Police and customs officials seized nearly 7 kg of heroin and arrested three [MISC Taiwanese  ] nationals in two separate incidents at [LOC Phnom Penh  ] [LOC International Airport  ] on May 19 and 20 . 
These two cases represent an impressive intake for one weekend given that in 2005 [MISC Cambodian  ] authorities seized just over 11 kg of heroin. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Chen Hsin Hung  ] , 57 , was arrested on May 19 carrying 4.75 kg of heroin with a local street value of USD 95,000 to 133,000 . 
Customs officials became suspicious when they noticed that [PER Hung  ] was carrying several bags of imported [MISC Taiwanese  ] foil-wrapped candies back to [LOC Taiwan  ] in his hand luggage . 
The candies turned out to be foil-wrapped packages of heroin . 
[PER Hung  ] , who was due to travel to [LOC Taiwan  ] via [LOC Kuala Lumpur  ] on [ORG Malaysian Airlines  ] flight 755 , had arrived in [LOC Phnom Penh  ] the previous day . 
During his police interrogation , [PER Hung  ] said that he had been picked up at the airport and returned to the airport by a couple , whom the police identified as a [MISC Cambodian  ] woman and a mainland [MISC Chinese  ] or [MISC Taiwanese  ] man . 
Police are attempting to locate the couple. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A second [MISC Taiwanese  ] man , who was standing near [ORG Chen Hsin Hung  ] during the security process , appeared to be quite interested in the proceedings and upset by [MISC Hung’s  ] arrest , and had tickets for the same flight as [PER Hung  ] , was also arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking . 
[PER Moek Dara  ] noted that the investigation had revealed no evidence to indicate that the second individual was also involved in drug smuggling , but that it was the prosecutor’s decision how to proceed in the case. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On May 20 , a 90-year-old [MISC Taiwanese  ] national named [PER Huang Sang Hou  ] was arrested at [LOC Phnom Penh  ] [LOC International Airport  ] with 1.9 kg of heroin , worth USD 38,000 to USD 53,000 . 
[PER Hou  ] reportedly came to [LOC Cambodia  ] as a tourist intending to gamble . 
Over the course of a week , he lost the [ORG USD  ] 4,000 he brought with him , borrowed an additional USD 2,000 from a [MISC Taiwanese  ] national in [LOC Phnom Penh  ] , and then lost that money as well . 
The [MISC Taiwanese  ] lender then persuaded [PER Hou  ] to carry the heroin back to [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
Airport customs officials were tipped off by the sloppy manner in which the heroin was packed on Hou’s body , making him appear bloated . 
[PER Hou  ] cooperated with the police in identifying the [MISC Taiwanese  ] lender , and [MISC Cambodian  ] government officials have already passed his name , address , and passport information to the [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration  ] ( [ORG DEA  ] ) . 
[PER Hou  ] had been planning to fly [ORG Dragon Airlines  ] flight 207 to [LOC Hong Kong  ] , and then to continue on to [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
[PER Amphetamine Seizures  ] , Prices on the Rise ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to statistics from the [ORG Ministry of Interior’s Anti-Drug  ] Police and the [ORG National Authority for Combating Drugs  ] ( [ORG NACD  ] ) , seizures of amphetamine-type stimulant ( [MISC ATS  ] ) tablets more than doubled when comparing the first four months of 2006 with the first four months of 2005 . 
From January to April 2006 , more than 220,000 [MISC ATS  ] tablets were seized , whereas from January to April 2005 , approximately 87,000 [MISC ATS  ] tablets were seized . 
The number of offenders arrested also rose from 154 from January to April 2005 to 204 during January to April 2006. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Both Brigadier General [PER Moek Dara  ] , Director of the [ORG Anti-Drugs Department  ] , and [ORG World Health Organization XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that prices for [MISC ATS  ] tablets have risen in the past few years , with particularly dramatic increases in the past 12 months . 
One year ago , a single [MISC ATS  ] tablet sold for approximately one dollar in [LOC Phnom Penh  ] , but now costs two to three dollars . 
[PER Moek Dara  ] noted that prices rise as the [MISC ATS  ] tablets make their way along the drug route , from fifty cents per tablet in [LOC Laos  ] , where the [LOC PHNOM PENH  ] 00000983 002 OF 003 majority are produced , to [ORG USD  ] 3 in [LOC Cambodia  ] , and then even higher prices in two destination countries: [ORG USD  ] 4 in [LOC Vietnam  ] and [ORG USD  ] 7.50 in [LOC Thailand  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cited anecdotal evidence from [ORG NGOs  ] that some [MISC ATS  ] users are switching to injecting heroin , currently available for [MISC USD  ] 1.50 to 2 in [LOC Phnom Penh  ] , as a cheaper alternative to rising [MISC ATS  ] prices . 
Lower Ecstasy Seizures Likely Point to Disrupted Network --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) In contrast to the dramatic rise in [MISC ATS  ] seizures , seizures of ecstasy tablets are down sharply , from 1,900 in January to April 2005 to less than 800 in January to April 2006 . 
[PER Moek Dara  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believe that lower levels of ecstasy seizures are a sign that supply has been disrupted following a cooperative DEA/Anti-Drug Police controlled delivery operation against the [PER Peter Brown  ] drug ring in 2004 and continued Anti-Drug Police action against the ring in 2005 . 
USG Training Provides Needed Skills , [MISC International Pressure  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Moek Dara  ] gave much of the credit for the dramatic increase in heroin and [MISC ATS  ] seizures and drug arrests to counternarcotics training funded by the [ORG State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics  ] and [ORG Law Enforcement Affairs  ] ( [ORG INL  ] ) and conducted by the [ORG DEA  ] . 
Before the training sessions , which were conducted in January and April 2006 , police officers along Cambodia’s porous northern border were not very active and would not even conduct foot patrols in the forest , according to [PER Moek Dara  ] . 
Now , however , the officers have more skills and are more motivated to patrol actively , he said , and have seized drugs and a lot of drug production equipment as well . 
Customs , immigration , and police officials at the airports are also better trained and more active , and [PER Moek Dara  ] noted that all of the officials involved in the weekend’s airport arrests had completed [ORG DEA  ] training. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] gave partial credit for increased anti-drug activity to counternarcotics training by the [LOC US  ] and other foreign donors . 
Some high-ranking [MISC Cambodian  ] police and military officials are rumored to be complicit in narcotics trafficking , he noted . 
He speculated that the training and pressure on the [MISC Cambodian  ] government to clamp down on drug activity has finally made an impression on higher ranking officials , and lower-level officers are “being allowed” to make more seizures . 
At the same time , such a dramatic increase is probably also an indication of efforts to traffic increased amounts of [MISC ATS  ] through [LOC Cambodia  ] , he opined . 
Trainees Enthusiastic about [ORG INL/DEA Courses  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Provincial Anti-Drug Police officers who attended the January Basic Counternarcotics course reported uniformly enthusiastic assessments to an embassy follow-up survey . 
Participating police captains reported an increased awareness of drug smuggling tactics , best practices in seizing and preparing evidence , and how to identify drugs using field test kits . 
Captain [PER Preap Sovann  ] of the [ORG Svay Rieng Anti-Drug  ] Police noted that the training also promoted inter-agency and inter-province cooperation as well . 
All captains reported training their staffs in the key topics covered by the [ORG DEA  ] training , and captains in [LOC Koh Kong  ] and [LOC Pursat  ] provinces reported conducting anti-drug outreach to primary and secondary school students as well . 
Trainees suggested that future courses provide written materials in [LOC Khmer  ] as well as [MISC English  ] , include information on money laundering , have more laboratory equipment available for in-class practice in drug identification , and include more time in simulations . 
Police Officer Arrested on Drug Charges --------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Nov Sophal , a municipal police officer in the southern city of [LOC Kep  ] , was arrested on April 15 and charged with trafficking 1 kg of heroin . 
[PER Moek Dara  ] was not expansive when asked about the case , noting simply that it is not uncommon for low-ranking police and military officials to be arrested for drug trafficking . 
In contrast , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that drug investigations of police or military officials are very rare , and speculated that the individual involved may even have run afoul of rumored higher-level police involvement in narcotics. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: While increased smuggling activity may [LOC PHNOM PENH  ] 00000983 003 OF 003 account for some of the increased seizures and arrests , it is clear that the [MISC Cambodian  ] government is turning up the heat on the country’s drug smugglers . 
Training from the USG and other countries is playing a critical role in supporting this effort--both through the skills and enthusiasm imparted to the participants , and also through the implicit expectations of improved performance on the part of the police and other officials .
