REASON: 1.4 ( d ) ----------------------------------- [PER Ratzinger  ] Elected [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Roman Catholic College of  ] Cardinals elected [MISC German  ] Cardinal [PER Joseph Ratzinger Supreme Pontiff  ] April 19 . 
[PER Ratzinger  ] , 78 , has taken the name [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] . 
Despite media speculation that [PER Ratzinger  ] had the support of many cardinals , his election was a surprise to many , given indications that other more moderate voices might prevent a two-thirds majority . 
Just yesterday , [PER Poloff  ] spoke to a top aide to [PER Ratzinger  ] , [MISC American  ] Monsignor [PER Charles Brown  ] , who asked half jokingly for prayers for [PER Ratzinger  ] 's candidacy . 
When we saw [PER Brown  ] just after [PER Benedict  ] 's appearance as the new pope , the [MISC American  ] was shellshocked: " I 'm speechless , " he said. ----------------- Powerful Cardinal ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ratzinger  ] was [PER Dean  ] of the [ORG College of Cardinals  ] and had long been considered one of the two or three most powerful men in the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
As head of the [LOC Holy See  ] 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the [ORG Faith  ] , the [LOC Vatican  ] 's watchdog for theological orthodoxy , [PER Ratzinger  ] developed a reputation for unapologetic conservatism and a firm hand with wayward theologians . 
The media often portrayed him as an aloof , autocratic despot . 
However , in meetings with [PER Ratzinger  ] , Post has found him to be surprisingly humble , spiritual , and approachable. -------------------- Will Stay the Course -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Post will provide a more detailed analysis of the likely course of [PER Benedict XVI  ] 's papacy septel , but the broad strokes seem clear . 
[PER Benedict XVI  ] will stay the course of [PER John Paul II  ] theologically ; there will be no liberalization of [MISC Catholic  ] policy on abortion , contraception , priestly celibacy , female priests , and other hotly debated issues . 
A sermon he delivered Monday before the opening of the conclave indicated as much , as [PER Ratzinger  ] made it clear a new pope should not back down in the face of secularism and other challenges to orthodoxy. -------------- [LOC Europe  ] a Focus -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Pope Benedict  ] will likely place great emphasis on the Church in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Ratzinger  ] believes [LOC Europe  ] is the spiritual and historic home of the Church , and he is not ready to cede his home continent to the forces of secularism or [MISC Islam  ] . 
In fact , [PER Ratzinger  ] made headlines in August 2004 when he expressed reservations about [LOC Turkey  ] 's prospective [ORG EU  ] membership ( 04 [LOC Vatican  ] 3196 ) . 
He also led the ultimately unsuccessful drive for a mention of [LOC Europe  ] 's [MISC Christian  ] roots in the new [ORG EU  ] constitution , which became a primary focus of [PER John Paul II  ] 's last year as pontiff . 
Many in the [LOC Holy See  ] questioned the logic of this focus , given that the constitution already provided the legal protections the church needed , but it reflects the new [PER Pope  ] 's certain attention to the spiritual future of [LOC Europe.  ] -------------------- Transitional Figure ? -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In choosing the name [PER Benedict XVI  ] , [PER Ratzinger  ] may have been acknowledging that at 78 , and following an historic papacy , he will be a transitional figure . 
[PER Benedict XV  ] 's short-lived papacy lasted only from 1914-1922 . 
The original [PER St. Benedict  ] , the founder of [MISC European  ] monastic tradition , is the patron saint of [LOC Europe  ] -- yet another hint of [PER Benedict XVI  ] 's intentions. ------------------------ Biographical Information ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Joseph Ratzinger  ] was born on 16 April 1927 in Marktl am Inn , [LOC Germany  ] . 
He was ordained a priest on 29 June 1951 . 
His father , a police officer , came from a traditional family of farmers from [LOC Lower Bavaria  ] . 
He spent his adolescent years in [LOC Traunstein  ] , and was called into the auxiliary anti-aircraft service in the last months of [MISC World War II  ] . 
From 1946 to 1951 , the year in which he was ordained a priest and began to teach , he studied philosophy and theology at the [ORG University of Munich  ] and at the higher school in [LOC Freising  ] . 
In 1953 he obtained a doctorate in theology . 
Four years later , he qualified as a university teacher . 
He then taught dogma and fundamental theology at the higher school of philosophy and theology of [LOC Freising  ] , then in [LOC Bonn  ] from 1959 to 1969 , Muenster from 1963 to 1966 , [LOC Tuebingen  ] from 1966 to 1969 . 
From 1969 , he was a professor of dogmatic theology and of the history of dogma at the [ORG University of Regensburg  ] and Vice President of the same university. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Already in 1962 he was well known when , at the age of 35 , he became a consultor at [ORG Vatican Council  ] [PER II  ] , of the Archbishop of [LOC Cologne  ] , Cardinal [PER Joseph Frings  ] . 
In March 1977 , [PER Paul VI  ] elected him Archbishop of [LOC Munich  ] and [LOC Freising  ] and on 28 May 1977 he was consecrated , the first diocesan priest after 80 years to take over the pastoral ministry of this large [MISC Bavarian  ] diocese . 
[PER Ratzinger  ] was created and proclaimed Cardinal by [PER Paul VI  ] in the consistory of 27 June 1977 . 
On 25 November 1981 he was nominated by [PER John Paul II Prefect  ] of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the [ORG Faith  ] ; President of the [ORG Biblical Commission  ] and of the [ORG Pontifical International Theological Commission.  ] ------- Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The election of [PER John Paul II  ] 's theologian to succeed him suggests that the [ORG College of Cardinals  ] wanted the closest possible theological continuity they could find in a new [PER Pope  ] . 
At the same time , it is unlikely that the 78-year-old " humble worker in the [LOC Lord  ] 's vineyard , " as he described himself will cut as prominent figure on the world stage as the young and robust [PER John Paul II  ] did when he was first elected . 
While he will certainly carry on the [LOC Holy See  ] 's global mission left by his predecessor , his focus is likely to be more on strengthening the church from within than promoting the Church 's role externally . 
Despite his euro-centric focus , he will also need to address the concerns of those [MISC Catholics  ] in the developing world whose priority remains a socially and politically active church working against poverty , disease and oppression . 
In this regard , and more broadly on international issues , he will face a steep learning curve . 
We should reach out to him early on to help shape his approach as he begins to grapple with the world beyond the [LOC Vatican  ] 's walls .
