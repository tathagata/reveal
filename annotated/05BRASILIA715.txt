REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Introduction . 
Ambassador was called for a one-on-one meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] on the afternoon of 14 March . 
[PER Amorim  ] focused initially on reiterating his strong interest in meeting soon with Secretary [PER Rice  ] , in spite of unsuccessful efforts to schedule a [LOC Washington  ] meeting in late March or mid April . 
( [PER Amorim  ] said he may cancel his April trip to [LOC Washington  ] in light of the Secretary 's unavailability on 18-19 April , when [PER Amorim  ] had considered combining a call on her with participation at a [ORG World Bank  ] meeting on [LOC Haiti  ] . 
) [PER Amorim  ] said that he and President [PER Lula da Silva  ] believe it would be important and highly positive for bilateral relations if the Secretary could visit [LOC Brazil  ] soon , and he expressed the hope that she could stop here en route to or from the [ORG Community of Democracies  ] summit in [LOC Chile  ] in late April . 
[PER Amorim  ] then noted Ambassador 's recent meetings with Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Guimaraes  ] ( ref E ) and [PER Amorim  ] 's chief of [PER Staff Patriota  ] ( ref D ) , and reviewed key issues from those discussions with Ambassador ( per below ) . 
End introduction [LOC VENEZUELA  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador outlined points ( refs [MISC A-C  ] ) on the [ORG USG  ] 's growing concern about [PER Chavez  ] 's rhetoric and actions , and stressed that the [ORG USG  ] increasingly sees [PER Chavez  ] as a threat to the region . 
Per refs , he asked that FM [PER Amorim  ] consider institutionalizing a more intensive political engagement between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOB  ] on [PER Chavez  ] , and standing up a dedicated intelligence-sharing arrangement . 
FM [PER Amorim  ] was clear in his response: " We do not see [PER Chavez  ] as a threat . 
" [PER Amorim  ] said that [PER Chavez  ] has been democratically elected ( in a general election that was reaffirmed by a referendum ) , enjoys substantial domestic support , is a popular figure on the international left and is leader of a major power on the continent . 
For those reasons , " we have to work with him and do not want to do anything that would jeopardize our relationship with him , " [PER Amorim  ] affirmed. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Amorim  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] would welcome intensifying its political dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [PER Chavez  ] , but has no interest in intelligence sharing ( although [PER Amorim  ] allowed that the [ORG GOB  ] would be willing to look at any intelligence we wished to provide unilaterally ) . 
Describing [LOC Brazil  ] 's relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] as " sensitive , " [PER Amorim  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] needed to take care not to take steps ( e.g. , intelligence activity with the [ORG USG  ] ) that could undermine its credibility with [PER Chavez  ] and undercut the [ORG GOB  ] 's ability to influence him in a more positive direction . 
[PER Amorim  ] said that he did not want to exaggerate the importance of [LOC Brazil  ] 's role in curbing [PER Chavez  ] 's more extreme behaviors , but in example [PER Amorim  ] noted [LOC Brazil  ] 's work with the [ORG Friends Group  ] ( where he said [LOC Brazil  ] weathered criticism from various sides to produce a balanced outcome ) , [PER Lula  ] 's recent suggestion to [PER Chavez  ] in a meeting in [LOC Uruguay  ] that he tone down his rhetoric , and also told a story of how [PER Lula  ] had personally persuaded [PER Chavez  ] not to go swimming at a [MISC Chilean  ] beach where [PER Chavez  ] intended to proclaim to gathered press that he was bathing in a spot which should be [LOC Bolivia  ] 's coastline on the [LOC Pacific  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] also noted that the meeting between Presidents [PER Lula  ] , [PER Chavez  ] , [PER Uribe  ] and [ORG Zapatero  ] scheduled for 29 March may occur in the [MISC Brazilian  ] Amazon frontier town of [LOC Santa Helena  ] for a discussion of economic integration ( [MISC Note: This  ] does not track with information from [PER Lula  ] 's foreign affairs staff , who recently told [MISC PolCouns  ] that the meeting would focus on counternarcotics and border security issues . 
End note . 
) [LOC BOLIVIA  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Segueing into a discussion of [LOC Bolivia  ] , [PER Amorim  ] said that [PER Lula  ] had been in direct contact with opposition leader [PER Evo Morales  ] in recent days . 
[PER Lula  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] are trying to persuade [PER Morales  ] that he needs to act in a democratic fashion , [PER Amorim  ] said , noting that , as with [PER Chavez  ] , it must be understood that [PER Morales  ] has " political legitimacy , " with popular support among a significant percentage of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's population . 
The [ORG USG  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] and others need to " take a steady and balanced approach " in supporting democracy in [LOC Bolivia  ] in the next crucial weeks , [PER Amorim  ] added . 
The economic exposure of [MISC Brazilian  ] companies in [LOC Bolivia  ] , along with the threat posed to regional stability by unrest there , make developments in [LOC Bolivia  ] of vital interest to [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Amorim  ] said . 
[LOC HAITI  ] 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Affirming the [ORG USG  ] 's support and gratitude for [LOC Brazil  ] 's leadership in the [LOC Haiti  ] mission , Ambassador provided ref A invitation for [LOC Brazil  ] to meet with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Canada  ] at the assistant secretary level , along with [ORG UN  ] senior representative [PER Valdes  ] in [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] in coming weeks to discuss cooperation in assistance projects and enhancing political dialogue . 
[PER Amorim  ] immediately agreed , and said he would designate a representative asap ( [ORG Note: On  ] the margins of the meeting with [PER Amorim  ] [MISC PolCouns  ] spoke briefly with Ambassador [PER Eduardo Felicio  ] , the ministry 's lead officer on political issues in the [LOC Haiti  ] mission . 
[PER Felicio  ] indicated that either he or a senior [ORG GOB  ] development official would likely represent [LOC Brazil  ] at the proposed meeting . 
End note . 
) [PER Amorim  ] took the opportunity to affirm to Ambassador in strong terms that the [ORG GOB  ] " has no intention of downgrading its commitment to [LOC Haiti  ] ; on the contrary , we plan to bolster our presence . 
" SOUTH AMERICA-ARAB SUMMIT <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] told Ambassador that the [ORG GOB  ] intended to do all it could to produce a balanced summit statement that would use language of existing [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions for any passages dealing with political issues . 
[PER Amorim  ] also noted that in his meetings with [LOC Syria  ] 's foreign minister and President [PER Assad  ] in [LOC Damascus  ] , [PER Amorim  ] had urged [MISC Syrian  ] compliance with [ORG UNSCR  ] 1559 ( even though [LOC Brazil  ] abstained on that vote ) . 
[PER Amorim  ] claimed that , even before [LOC Syria  ] publicly announced its pull-back in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Assad  ] had told [PER Amorim  ] in their meeting that he intended to withdraw [MISC Syrian  ] forces from [LOC Lebanon  ] , although [PER Amorim  ] said he did not claim to take credit for [PER Assad  ] 's decision . 
Ambassador chided [PER Amorim  ] for [LOC Brazil  ] 's abstention on 1559 and post facto commitment to [MISC Lebanese  ] democracy , at which [PER Amorim  ] smiled . 
[PER Amorim  ] reiterated that his recent [LOC Middle East  ] trip had been focused on providing invitations to [MISC Arab  ] participants in the summit , that he had no intention of slighting [LOC Israel  ] and would be visiting [LOC Israel  ] in June . 
[ORG FTAA  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador expressed disappointment that [LOC Brazil  ] had canceled a March meeting of the [ORG FTAA  ] co-chairs , but [PER Amorim  ] emphasized that the [ORG GOB  ] had sought only a postponement to early April , so that [PER Amorim  ] would have the opportunity to consult with [LOC Brazil  ] 's negotiator [ORG Bahadian  ] and also with [MISC Mercosul  ] partners in advance of the co-chairs meeting . 
He reiterated that [LOC Brazil  ] " wants to remain within the [LOC Miami  ] framework , " even though [LOC Brazil  ] sees some recent [ORG USG  ] actions as inconsistent with that goal ( e.g. , the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to [ORG IPR  ] and possible cross retaliation ) . 
Musing that [LOC Brazil  ] is " happy enough to say that the negotiations are under an [ORG FTAA  ] umbrella , " [PER Amorim  ] opined that what is actually happening now is a [MISC Mercosul  ] -U.S. bilateral trade negotiation , since the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" has already executed bilateral agreements with everyone else . 
" INSS/ATLANTA CONSULATE <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Amorim  ] understood the two issues: property sales and [ORG INSS  ] payments should be delinked . 
However , he added that if the [LOC U.S.  ] can provide general language in an agreement that reflects a [LOC U.S.  ] intention to pay past [ORG USG  ] debts to [LOC Brazil  ] 's social security system or some other acknowledgment that accomplishes that purpose , a solution can be reached . 
He said " it is in your interest for [LOC Brazil  ] to have a consulate in [LOC Atlanta  ] , " reflecting his understanding that the [ORG USG  ] is using delay of approval for the new consulate as leverage to press for a solution on the [ORG USG  ] property problem . 
Ambassador noted that this has been a long-standing issue that was an administrative and financial impediment to our diplomatic mission in [LOC Brazil  ] , and that the time has come to solve this matter . 
[PER Amorim  ] seemed good natured and optimistic about resolving the question with some type of appropriate agreement regarding the [ORG USG  ] " intention " to deal with its [ORG INSS  ] obligations . 
[PER TSA/Alcantara SIPDIS  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Amorim  ] also said that the [ORG GOB  ] is close to being ready to engage with the [ORG USG  ] on revision of the 2000 bilateral [ORG Technology Safeguards Agreement  ] for participation of [LOC U.S.  ] firms in commercial space launches at the [LOC Alcantara  ] facility in northern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] noted two specific issues -- language referring to safeguard agreements of other countries working at [LOC Alcantara  ] and [ORG USG  ] requirements on prohibiting launches by states accused of supporting terrorism - as areas where the [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG USG  ] may need to find new common language for the text. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [PER Amorim  ] made it very clear that the [ORG GOB  ] is not buying into our categorization of [PER Chavez  ] as a significant threat to the region , to be treated accordingly . 
The [ORG GOB  ] sees him as a legitimate , democratically- elected figure ( as is also [PER Evo Morales  ] , in the [ORG GOB  ] 's view ) and [LOC Brazil  ] is committed to working closely with [PER Chavez  ] , ostensibly to ameliorate his more extreme behavior by involving him in interdependent economic and political relationships . 
[LOC Brazil  ] seems to believe that is the best route to enhancing regional stability . 
[PER Amorim  ] 's flat rejection of intelligence sharing was balanced by his willingness to engage more intensely with us on a political level in approaching [LOC Venezuela  ] , and we should look for ways to exploit that opening in making our case that [PER Chavez  ] represents a danger . 
Providing the [ORG GOB  ] with more detailed information on human rights violations and repressive actions within [LOC Venezuela  ] , as well as any information we can share about [MISC Chavez-backed  ] mischief in other countries ( even if that means offering intelligence unilaterally ) can be part of the political engagement . 
On a more positive note , [PER Amorim  ] was forward-leaning on the two key bilateral issues discussed -- [ORG INSS/U.S.  ] property and the [LOC Alcantara TSA  ] -- and seems committed to working on resolutions in the near future .
