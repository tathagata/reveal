( S ) A well-connected [MISC Iranian  ] businessman who owns a [MISC Baku-based  ] oil services company told [ORG Baku Iran  ] watcher that a company called " [ORG INSULTEC  ] , " owned by [LOC UK  ] citizens of [MISC Indian  ] origin , has secretly provided cladding , thermal insulation , and ancillary equipment to the government of [LOC Iran  ] in a variety of shipments via [LOC Turkey  ] and the [MISC U.A.E. According  ] to the [LOC Baku  ] source , whose company operates in [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , and the [MISC U.A.E.  ] as well as [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , the materials allegedly sent by [ORG INSULTEC  ] in falsely labeled containers were of type that could be used in nuclear reactor construction . 
Citing old [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Dubai  ] based business friends allegedly familiar with the issue , the source said that [ORG INSULTEC  ] has maintained a sanctions-evading relationship with [MISC Iranian  ] government companies for some time . 
Source said that the company was officially headquartered in the [LOC U.K.  ] , and has offices in [LOC Germany  ] , the [LOC USA  ] , and elsewhere , its manufacturing base and the bulk of its staff are in [LOC India.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Perhaps more disturbingly , the source ( who had just returned from ten days in [LOC Dubai  ] ) said that he had been informed by an [MISC Iranian  ] friend who had collaborated in the activity that [ORG INSULTEC  ] recently helped facilitate a shipment from the [LOC UAE  ] to [LOC Iran  ] consisting of twelve containers ( possibly labeled " insulation " ) of unknown material that may not have actually originated with [ORG INSULTEC  ] . 
The source sai he was told by his friend that the shipment went by ship to [LOC Bandar Abbas  ] and was trucked immediately to a final destination in Busheir . 
The friend told source that another [MISC Iranian  ] destination was falsely listed in the shipping documents , presumably to hide the actually intended destination of [LOC Busheir.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The [LOC Baku  ] businessman is a UK-educated engineer from a prominent Pre-Revolution [LOC Isfahan  ] family , and formerly owned a large factory in [LOC Iran  ] . 
He is a former national fencing champion of [LOC Iran.  ] former President of the [LOC Iran  ] Fencing Association , and Vice-President of an [LOC Azerbaijan  ] sports association . 
He has been based in [LOC Baku  ] for more than ten years , working primarily as a sub-contractor to [ORG BP  ] and the [ORG Cape Industrial Services  ] company . 
While his oil services company includes an insulation division that may be in competition with [ORG INSULTEC  ] , source has provided " inside " information on many other [MISC Iranian  ] issues ( including comprehensive data on the status of new [MISC Iranian  ] oil refinery construction ) that does not relate to his private interests in any way. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Note: A quick google check revealed several companies with the name [ORG INSULTEC  ] in the title - these may or not be affiliated . 
Based on the information provided by source ( currently in [LOC Iran  ] , where he frequently travels ) , one possible candidate could be " [ORG INSULTEC Chitral Ltd  ] .
