( C ) P/E Chief conveyed reftel invitation and message from [ORG NEA A/S David Welch  ] to [ORG MFA Americas Desk  ] Director [PER Muhammad Matari  ] March 6 , stressing that a decision by [LOC Libya  ] to participate in the [MISC U.S.-AMU  ] technical working group on youth de-radicalization would be an important positive gesture . 
[PER Matari  ] said Foreign Minister [PER Shalgam  ] , in [LOC Cairo  ] for the [ORG Arab League Ministerial  ] meeting , was due back in [LOC Tripoli  ] later that evening and that he would convey the invitation with him immediately with a recommendation that [LOC Libya  ] send a delegation . 
2 . 
( C ) Noting that many [MISC Libyan  ] foreign fighters identified in last September 's [PER Objective Massey  ] operation along the [MISC Syrian-Iraqi  ] border were young men from eastern [LOC Libya  ] , P/E Chief said [ORG GOL  ] participants in the [MISC U.S.-AMU  ] workshop should expect questions about what " soft power " measures might help blunt the appeal of extremist messages there . 
In that regard , it would be helpful if the [ORG GOL  ] chose to include in their delegation officials conversant with the [ORG GOL  ] 's counter-ideological initiatives and efforts to de-radicalize youth through education and development programs . 
[PER Matari  ] took the point on board and said he would recommend to FM [PER Shalgam  ] that [LOC Libya  ] 's delegation include individuals empowered to speak to those issues .
