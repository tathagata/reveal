( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Defense Minister [PER Safar Abiyev  ] on March 14 told the Ambassador he did not object to exploration of joint [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] use of the [LOC Gabala  ] radar station , but was deliberately vague on whether the [MISC Russians’  ] lease would be renewed on its expiration in 2012 . 
He also shared details of his recent visit to [LOC Moscow  ] , which came at the [MISC Russians’  ] invitation amid the controversy over allegations of large-scale arms transfers by [LOC Russia  ] to [LOC Armenia  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The immediate reason for the Saturday morning meeting was to agree on a procedure for the quick negotiation of the [ORG Exercise Support Agreement  ] ( [ORG ESA  ] ) for the planned [MISC April-May  ] bilateral exercise REGIONAL RESPONSE 09 ( RR-09 ) . 
While the [MISC MoD  ] had been planning on postponing the exercise due to interagency differences in [LOC Baku  ] - later shown to be political reservations held by the Foreign Minister personally about the international message sent by the exercise ( [ORG Reftel  ] ) , [PER Abiyev  ] was now determined to move forward after a lengthy after-hours meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Mammadyarov  ] after the latter’s meeting with Ambassador and DATT . 
[PER Abiyev  ] offered his full support to the exercise and a visit from a USEUCOM negotiator to finalize the agreement ; adding , however , that he was in full agreement with the Foreign Minister’s desire to make the exercise appear as multilateral as possible to avoid raising the ire of [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Gabala Issues  ] ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Responding to Ambassador’s question about Azerbaijan’s future intentions regarding [LOC Gabala  ] , [PER Abiyev  ] replied that it was late in 2007 that [MISC Russian  ] DefMin [PER Anatoly Serdyukov  ] approached him about extending [MISC Russia’s  ] use of the site beyond 2012 . 
According to [PER Abiyev  ] , he responded in surprise and asked [PER Serdyukov  ] to explain his request because then-President [PER Putin  ] had said before that [LOC Russia  ] no longer needed the site . 
Serdyukov’s response was “ ( that was a long time ago.” [PER Abiyev  ] told the [MISC Russians  ] that the time to discuss the renewal of the lease - or the expansion of the facilities or military contingent there - was 2012. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Asked about the [LOC Armavir  ] ( “Voronezh” ) station [LOC Russia  ] recently put into operation in the [LOC Krasnodar  ] region , [PER Abiyev  ] said that it is a relatively “weak” station with much less capability than [LOC Gabala  ] , regardless of [MISC Russian  ] claims about its effectiveness . 
He claimed this was obvious because [LOC Russia  ] had put almost 1 billion USD into improvements at [LOC Gabala  ] over the years and had only spent USD 70 million on [LOC Armavir  ] ; and furthermore the [LOC Armavir  ] radar only has a range of 2,500 km compared to 8,500 for [LOC Gabala  ] . 
( Note: Other sources give the cost of [LOC Armavir  ] at 2.85 billion rubles , or USD 84 million at current rates , and a range of 4,000 km . 
[LOC Russia  ] built the station to replace the radars at [LOC Sevastopol  ] and [LOC Mukachevo  ] in [LOC Ukraine  ] , which it lost when the [ORG GOU  ] refused to continue their leases . 
End Note .

( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Abiyev  ] told the Ambassador about his late-January trip to [LOC Moscow  ] to discuss Azerbaijan’s allegations that [LOC Russia  ] had made extensive weapons transfers to [LOC Armenia  ] throughout 2008 . 
In formal meetings , [PER Abiyev  ] said , his [MISC Russian  ] counterpart stuck to the talking points and denied any involvement . 
However , “after the second bottle of vodka , ” that evening , he said , the [MISC Russians  ] opened up and admitted to having transferred weapons to [MISC Armenia.In  ] an interesting side note , [PER Abiyev  ] quoted [PER Serdyukov  ] as saying: “Do you follow the orders of your President ? ...Well , I follow the orders of two Presidents.” DERSE</pre></code>
