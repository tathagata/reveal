[PER Begin  ] points: -- I would like to thank Ambassador [PER Choi  ] for his briefing . 
-- We congratulate the parties on their continuing efforts to fulfill their obligations under the [ORG Ouagadougou Political Agreement  ] , and again thank the Facilitator , President Compaore , for his dedication to the peace process . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] welcomes the progress made to date in preparing for the November 30 elections . 
These elections are an opportunity to reestablish trust among all parties in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
They must exemplify the importance to the country 's future stability and prosperity of opening the political process and economic opportunity to all [MISC Ivorians  ] . 
-- We hope that it will be possible to accelerate the technical preparations to ensure that the elections are conducted as planned . 
We fully support the role that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General will play in certifying that the elections are free , open , fair and transparent . 
-- We hope that there will be more rapid progress on disarmament and demobilization of combatants . 
This is critical in guaranteeing a secure environment throughout the country . 
It is a vital step in rebuilding an inclusive , democratic security sector . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] is also concerned about the low rate of surrender of weapons , and the very possibly connected rise in crime . 
We urge the leadership of the [ORG Defense and Security Forces  ] of [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] and of the [ORG Forces Nouvelles  ] to sign the memorandum of understanding on the responsibility of the impartial forces to supervise storage of weapons that have been surrendered . 
-- As the Secretary-General noted in his report , disarmament and dismantling of militia groups is a key element in the restoration of security . 
We urge militia leaders to cooperate with the Government in bringing this about . 
-- We look forward to continuing progress in establishing national administration throughout the country and on building the national civic service . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] appreciates the candor and concern shown in the report 's discussion of the serious problem of the lack of impunity for sexual violence against women . 
We applaud and support [ORG UNOCI  ] 's efforts to address this issue , and to promote and protect human rights in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , in particular the rights of women and children . 
We note in particular the training programs both for mission personnel and for those working in the [MISC Ivorian  ] legal and judicial systems . 
-- We also welcome the steps the mission is taking to underscore the [ORG UN  ] 's zero-tolerance policy for sexual misconduct by its personnel . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will be very interested in the results of the investigations into allegations of such misconduct by [ORG UNOCI  ] peacekeepers . 
-- In conclusion , the [LOC U.S.  ] supports the renewal of [ORG UNOCI  ] 's current mandate and strength , and looks forward to the Secretary-General 's recommendations in his next report on a drawdown plan . 
-- End points .
