[PER Tatiana Gfoeller  ] , Reason 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: On October 28 , the Ambassador participated in a two-hour brunch to brief HRH the [ORG Duke of York  ] ahead of his meetings with the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] Prime Minister and other high-level officials . 
She was the only non-subject of the [LOC United Kingdom  ] or the [ORG Commonwealth  ] invited to participate by the [MISC British  ] Ambassador to the [LOC Kyrgyz Republic  ] . 
Other participants included major [MISC British  ] investors in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] and the [MISC Canadian  ] operator of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The discussion covered the investment climate for [MISC Western  ] firms in the [LOC Kyrgyz Republic  ] , the problem of corruption , the revival of the “Great Game , ” [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] influence in the country , and the [MISC Prince’s  ] personal views on promoting [MISC British  ] economic interests . 
Astonishingly candid , the discussion at times verged on the rude ( from the [MISC British  ] side ) . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC British  ] Ambassador to the [LOC Kyrgyz Republic  ] [PER Paul Brummell  ] invited the Ambassador to participate in briefing His Royal Highness Prince [PER Andrew  ] , the [ORG Duke of York  ] , ahead of his October 28 meetings with [MISC Kyrgyz  ] Prime Minister [PER Igor Chudinov  ] and other high-level officials . 
The Prince was in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] to promote [MISC British  ] economic interests . 
Originally scheduled to last an hour over brunch , the briefing ended up lasting two hours , thanks to the super-engaged [MISC Prince’s  ] pointed questions . 
The Ambassador was the only participant who was not a [MISC British  ] subject or linked to the [ORG Commonwealth  ] . 
The absence of her [MISC French  ] and [MISC German  ] colleagues was notable ; they were apparently not invited despite being fellow members of the [ORG European Union  ] . 
Others included major [MISC British  ] investors in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] and the [MISC Canadian  ] operator of the [MISC Kumtor  ] mine. “YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE ROUGH WITH THE SMOOTH” -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The discussion was kicked off by the president of the [MISC Canadian-run Kumtor  ] mine , who described at length his company’s travails of trying to negotiate a revised mining concession that provides a greater stake in Kumtor’s parent company to the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] government in exchange for a simplified tax regime and an expanded concession . 
He was followed by the representative of the [MISC British  ] owner of [LOC Kyrgyzneftigas  ] , who explained his company’s role in [MISC Kyrgyz  ] oil exploration and production , as well as doing his share of complaining of being harassed and hounded by [MISC Kyrgyz  ] tax authorities . 
One example he gave was that a [MISC Kyrgyz  ] shareholder was now suing the company , saying that his “human rights” were being violated by the terms of his shareholders’ agreement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Prince reacted with unmitigated patriotic fervor . 
To his credit , he diligently tried to understand the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] point view . 
However , when participants explained that some [MISC Kyrgyz  ] feel that they were “unfairly” led in the 1990s to sign unfavorable contracts with [MISC Westerners  ] , he evinced no sympathy. “A contract is a contract , ” he insisted. “You have to take the rough with the smooth.” “ALL OF THIS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE FRANCE” ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) After having half-heartedly danced around the topic for a bit , only mentioning “personal interests” in pointed fashion , the business representatives then plunged into describing what they see as the appallingly high state of corruption in the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] economy . 
While claiming that all of them never participated in it and never gave out bribes , one representative of a middle-sized company stated that “It is sometimes an awful temptation.” In an astonishing display of candor in a public hotel where the brunch was taking place , all of the businessmen then chorused that nothing gets done in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] if President Bakiyev’s son [ORG Maxim  ] does not get “his cut.” Prince [PER Andrew  ] took up the topic with gusto , saying that he keeps hearing Maxim’s name “over and over again” whenever he discusses doing business in this country . 
Emboldened , one businessman said that doing business here is “like doing business in the [LOC Yukon”  ] in the nineteenth century , i.e. only those willing to participate in local corrupt practices are able to make any money . 
His colleagues all heartily agreed , with one pointing out that “nothing ever changes here . 
Before all you heard was [PER Akayev’s  ] son’s name . 
Now it’s Bakiyev’s son’s name.” At this point the [ORG Duke of York  ] laughed uproariously , saying that: “All of this sounds exactly like [MISC France.”  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Prince then turned to the Ambassador for an [MISC American  ] take on the situation . 
The Ambassador described [MISC American  ] business interests in the country , which range from large investments such as the [ORG Hyatt  ] hotel and the [MISC Katel  ] telecommunications company to smaller investments in a range of sectors . 
She stated that part of the problem with business conditions in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] was the rapid turnover in government positions . 
Some reacted to their short tenures in a corrupt manner , wanting to “steal while they can” until they were turned out of office . 
While noting the need for greater transparency in doing business , she recounted that she had hosted the [MISC American  ] Chamber of [ORG Commerce’s Members Day  ] last week ( attended by the Foreign Minister and the Deputy Minister of Trade and [ORG Commerce  ] ) which had been widely attended and a resounding success ( see reftel ) . 
She then described the beneficial impact on the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] economy of the [ORG Coalition Air Base  ] at [LOC Manas Airport.  ] “YOU HAVE TO CURE YOURSELF OF ANOREXIA” --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) With a mock groan , the [ORG Duke of York  ] then exclaimed: “My [PER God  ] , what am I supposed to tell these people ? ! ” More seriously , he invited his guests to suggest ways Kyrgyzstan’s economic prospects and attractiveness could be improved . 
Everyone agreed that in his talks with the Prime Minister and others , he should emphasize the rule of law , and long-term stability. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Agreeing with the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] point about rapid government turnover , they urged him to impress upon his hosts the importance of predictability and the sanctity of contracts in order to attract more [MISC Western  ] investment . 
At the same time , they pointed out that none of this was necessary to attract [MISC Russian  ] , [MISC Kazakh  ] , or [MISC Chinese  ] investments . 
It appeared to them that the [MISC Kyrgyz  ] were satisfied with their level and on the verge of “not bothering” with making the necessary improvements to attract [MISC Western  ] investments . 
Returning to what is obviously a favorite theme , Prince [PER Andrew  ] cracked: “They won’t need to make any changes to attract the [MISC French  ] either ! ” Again turning thoughtful , the Prince mused that outsiders could do little to change the culture of corruption here. “They themselves have to have a change of heart . 
Just like you have to cure yourself of anorexia . 
No one else can do it for you.” PLAYING THE GREAT GAME ( BY EXTENSION THE AMERICANS TOO ) --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Addressing the Ambassador directly , Prince [PER Andrew  ] then turned to regional politics . 
He stated baldly that “the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC Western Europe  ] ( and by extension you [MISC Americans  ] too” ) were now back in the thick of playing the [LOC Great Game  ] . 
More animated than ever , he stated cockily: “And this time we aim to win ! ” Without contradicting him , the Ambassador gently reminded him that the [LOC United States  ] does not see its presence in the region as a continuation of the [LOC Great Game  ] . 
We support Kyrgyzstan’s independence and sovereignty but also welcome good relations between it and all of its neighbors , including [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Prince pounced at the sound of that name . 
He told the Ambassador that he was a frequent visitor to [LOC Central Asia  ] and the [MISC Caucasus  ] and had noticed a marked increase in [MISC Russian  ] pressure and concomitant anxiety among the locals post-August events in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
He stated the following story related to him recently by Azerbaijan’s President [PER Aliyev  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] had received a letter from President [PER Medvedev  ] telling him that if [LOC Azerbaijan  ] supported the designation of the [MISC Bolshevik  ] artificial famine in [LOC Ukraine  ] as “genocide” at the [ORG United Nations  ] , “then you can forget about seeing [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] ever again.” Prince [PER Andrew  ] added that every single other regional President had told him of receiving similar “directive” letters from [PER Medvedev  ] except for [PER Bakiyev  ] . 
He asked the Ambassador if [PER Bakiyev  ] had received something similar as well . 
The Ambassador answered that she was not aware of any such letter. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG Duke  ] then stated that he was very worried about [MISC Russia’s  ] resurgence in the region . 
As an example , he cited the recent [MISC Central Asian  ] energy and water-sharing deal ( septel ) , which he claimed to know had been “engineered by [LOC Russia  ] , who finally pounded her fist on the table and everyone fell into line.” ( NOTE: Interestingly , the [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador to the [LOC Kyrgyz Republic  ] recently described her analysis of the deal to the Ambassador in strikingly similar language . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Showing that he is an equal-opportunity [LOC Great Game  ] player , [ORG HRH  ] then turned to the topic of [LOC China  ] . 
He recounted that when he had recently asked the President of [LOC Tajikistan  ] what he thought of growing [MISC Chinese  ] influence in [LOC Central Asia  ] , the President had responded “with language I won’t use in front of ladies.” His interlocutors told the Prince that while [MISC Russians  ] are generally viewed sympathetically throughout the region , the [MISC Chinese  ] are not . 
He nodded , terming [MISC Chinese  ] economic and possibly other expansion in the region “probably inevitable , but a menace.” RUDE LANGUAGE A [ORG LA BRITISH  ] -------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The brunch had already lasted almost twice its allotted time , but the Prince looked like he was just getting started . 
Having exhausted the topic of [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , he turned to the general issue of promoting [MISC British  ] economic interests abroad . 
He railed at [MISC British  ] anti-corruption investigators , who had had the “idiocy” of almost scuttling the [MISC Al-Yamama  ] deal with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
( NOTE: The [ORG Duke  ] was referencing an investigation , subsequently closed , into alleged kickbacks a senior [MISC Saudi  ] royal had received in exchange for the multi-year , lucrative [ORG BAE Systems  ] contract to provide equipment and training to [MISC Saudi  ] security forces . 
END NOTE . 
) His mother’s subjects seated around the table roared their approval . 
He then went on to “these ( expletive ) journalists , especially from the [ORG National Guardian  ] , who poke their noses everywhere” and ( presumably ) make it harder for [MISC British  ] businessmen to do business . 
The crowd practically clapped . 
He then capped this off with a zinger: castigating “our stupid ( sic ) [MISC British  ] and [MISC American  ] governments which plan at best for ten years whereas people in this part of the world plan for centuries.” There were calls of “hear , hear” in the private brunch hall . 
Unfortunately for the assembled [MISC British  ] subjects , their cherished Prince was now late to the Prime Minister’s . 
He regretfully tore himself away from them and they from him . 
On the way out , one of them confided to the Ambassador: “What a wonderful representative for the [MISC British  ] people ! 
We could not be prouder of our royal family ! ” COMMENT ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Prince [PER Andrew  ] reached out to the Ambassador with cordiality and respect , evidently valuing her insights . 
However , he reacted with almost neuralgic patriotism whenever any comparison between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC United Kingdom  ] came up . 
For example , one [MISC British  ] businessman noted that despite the “overwhelming might of the [MISC American  ] economy compared to ours” the amount of [MISC American  ] and [MISC British  ] investment in [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] was similar . 
Snapped the Duke: “No surprise there . 
The [MISC Americans  ] don’t understand geography . 
Never have . 
In the [LOC U.K.  ] , we have the best geography teachers in the world ! ” END COMMENT .
