( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a March 24 meeting with Special Representative for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] , Abu [LOC Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( [PER MbZ  ] ) expressed his grave concerns about the [MISC Iranian  ] threat to the region . 
[PER MbZ  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] response to the [LOC Nowruz  ] message was primarily for domestic consumption , but that the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership is concerned that dialogue with the [LOC West  ] represents a regime threat . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] would obtain a nuclear weapon unless the regime could be " split from inside " before nuclear capability was achieved . 
Foreign Minister [PER Abdullah  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] argued for continued [LOC Gulf  ] consultation in conjunction with any [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to engage [LOC Iran  ] .

[ORG NOWRUZ STATEMENT  ] ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] began by telling Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] that [PER Khamenei  ] 's response to President 's [LOC Nowruz  ] statement was designed to send a message to the millions of [MISC Iranians  ] who saw the statement on the [MISC Internet  ] that there will be no debate on engagement with the [LOC United States  ] and/or the [LOC West  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] opined that [PER Khamenei  ] had to deliver the message personally as an [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] response would have fueled domestic debate . 
Commenting that [PER Khamenei  ] was conveying [LOC Iran  ] 's fundamental lack of trust in the [LOC United States  ] , [PER MbZ  ] said the [MISC Iranians  ] want an apology " for everything from [PER Carter  ] to [PER Bush  ] . 
" He added that the uncharacteristic speed of [PER Khamenei  ] 's response indicates the extent of the perceived threat that improved relations with the [LOC West  ] might represent to the leadership 's control over the country . 
Specifically , the [MISC Iranian  ] regime fears the [LOC United States  ] will demand the renunciation of its nuclear program , which would be politically impossible . 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS A CERTAINTY , UNLESS REGIME FALLS --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] told [PER Holbrooke  ] he was " 100 percent " convinced [LOC Iran  ] will complete its nuclear weapons program . 
He candidly stated his personal belief that negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] were irrelevant and a military solution would only delay the program , not derail it . 
[PER MbZ  ] said that there was a " third way " between these unacceptable options: [LOC Iran  ] is domestically very fragile , and the only way to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons was to " split them from inside . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to his concerns about an armed confrontation , [PER MbZ  ] said war with [LOC Iran  ] would only harm the [ORG UAE  ] . 
He is deeply concerned that the current [MISC Israeli  ] government will initiate military action without consultation . 
An [MISC Israeli  ] attack on [LOC Iran  ] would have little impact on [LOC Iran  ] 's capabilities , but [PER MbZ  ] was certain [LOC Iran  ] would respond . 
[PER MbZ  ] argued that the leadership believes its own lies , which were " proven " by [LOC Iran  ] 's success in [LOC Basra  ] . 
Today 's conventional [MISC Iranian  ] weapons would target the [LOC Gulf  ] , while [LOC Iran  ] continues to expand its missile program with the hope of reaching the [LOC West  ] . 
CONSULT US ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG UAE  ] Foreign Minister [PER Sheikh Abdullah  ] bin [PER Zayed Al Nahyan  ] ( [ORG AbZ  ] ) stressed the importance of a continuation of the [MISC P5  ] plus 1 plus [ORG GCC  ] plus 3 coordination on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said that such consultation in 2008 " agitated " [LOC Iran  ] , but sent a message to [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] and [MISC European  ] allies that the [LOC Gulf  ] is seriously concerned about [MISC Iranian  ] hegemony . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's regional hegemony and nuclear program are two issues that the [LOC West  ] cannot tackle separately . 
[ORG AbZ  ] noted that countries in the region ( " some friends " ) are concerned that the [LOC United States  ] , especially under the current administration , would engage [LOC Iran  ] at the expense of ties with the region . 
[ORG AbZ  ] said the President 's [LOC Nowruz  ] message supported this theory . 
He concluded , " The more you engage [LOC Iran  ] , the more you must engage the [LOC Gulf  ] states . 
" ( Ambassador [PER Olson  ] 's comment: [PER Abdullah  ] 's reference to " friends " was [MISC Emirati  ] politesse - the [ORG UAE  ] is deeply concerned that we are preparing to trade , and is interpreting the [LOC Nowruz  ] greeting in that way . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU ) Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] has cleared this message .
