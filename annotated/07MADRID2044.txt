( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
Although [ORG GOS  ] officials are in favor of increasing security measures at [MISC Spanish  ] ports , they are concerned that their ports will be unable to comply with the new scanning requirements mandated under Title XVII of the 9/11 Act . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials have told Post that the requirement to x-ray 100 percent of [MISC U.S.-bound  ] cargo would be both time and cost prohibitive . 
In response , [PER EconOff  ] has drawn from the reftel points , highlighting the President 's desire to ensure the workability of the cargo scanning provisions in a way that increases homeland security while ensuring the continuance of vital commerce . 
[ORG GOS  ] officials have expressed appreciation for the information , but say they will continue to coordinate with other [ORG EU  ] countries to craft a common stance in opposition to these new requirements . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over the past several weeks , officials from [MISC Spanish  ] Customs as well as from the [ORG Ministry of Infrastructure  ] and Public Works' [ORG Port Safety Directorate  ] have told [MISC Embassy  ] officers that they are concerned with the feasibility of implementing the 9/11 Act 's cargo scanning provisions , particularly the requirement to x-ray all of [MISC U.S.-bound  ] cargo . 
Drawing from [LOC Spain  ] 's experience with the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) , [MISC Spanish  ] Customs representatives have pointed out that the process of x-raying cargo is not a quick one , and takes several minutes per container to complete . 
Given the number of containers that come through [MISC Spanish  ] ports , customs officials believe that the time , personnel , and equipment needed to identify and x-ray all [MISC U.S.-bound  ] cargo ( instead of the targeted screening that currently takes place in major [MISC Spanish  ] ports ) would be time and cost prohibitive. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ignacio Gonzalez  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] Customs' Assistant Director for Customs Surveillance , has noted that scanning for illicit nuclear or other radioactive material would be logistically more feasible than 100 percent x-raying , although still a costly endeavor . 
He explained that with the purchase of enough Megaports radiation detection portals , trucks could theoretically drive large volumes of cargo on their way in and out of ports without significant delays. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pedro Roman  ] , Director for [ORG Port Security  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Infrastructure  ] , repeated these concerns in a conversation with EconOff October 24 . 
He stated that all [ORG EU  ] countries were opposed to these measures and that [LOC Spain  ] was in the process of working with the [ORG EU  ] to craft a common stance . 
He added that he would be participating in [ORG EU  ] discussions on this common position , the next meeting of which is scheduled in [LOC Brussels  ] the week of November 5. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to the various concerns raised , [PER EconOff  ] has drawn from reftel talking points , noting that in signing the law , the President stated that he will continue to work with [ORG Congress  ] to ensure the workability of the cargo screening provisions in a way that increases our vigilance on homeland security while ensuring the continuance of vital commerce . 
[PER EconOff  ] has also noted that the Act provides the Secretary of the [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] the SIPDIS flexibility to seek extensions of the 2012 deadline until the specific conditions necessary for a full deployment can be met. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] officials have attempted to clarify that although the [ORG GOS  ] is opposed to the cargo scanning provisions of this law , it is supportive of the principle of increased security . 
[PER Ignacio Gonzalez  ] from [MISC Spanish  ] Customs explained to [MISC Embassy  ] officers that [ORG GOS  ] is in favor of additional security measures at [MISC Spanish  ] ports , and is seeking to expand the Megaports initiative to detect illicit radioactive material . 
He added that three of the most heavy volume ports in [LOC Spain  ] - [LOC Barcelona  ] , [LOC Valencia  ] , and [LOC Algeciras  ] - were actively participating in targeted cargo screening efforts undertaken via the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Post will continue to engage with the [ORG GOS  ] on this issue . 
So far , the only complaints heard about this initiative have come from [ORG GOS  ] officials , although we expect members of the local maritime and business community to also add their views following the October 25 [ORG Financial Times  ] articles on these new measures .
