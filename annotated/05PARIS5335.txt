He was upbeat about [LOC France  ] 's future if the country seized the opportunity that reforms could bring . 
He also tossed out a few of the " policy zingers " for which he is well known , notably " The [ORG European Central Bank  ] confuses a strong currency with a strong economy , " and " [LOC France  ] needs to do what [PER Reagan  ] did in the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Thatcher  ] in [LOC Britain  ] , and [LOC Gonzales  ] in [LOC Spain  ] .

( U ) Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] and [PER Allan Hubbard  ] , Director of the [ORG National Economic Council  ] , met with [LOC France  ] 's Minister of Interior , [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] on 1 August . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is also the president of the Union for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] ( [ORG UMP  ] ) party , a coalition of center-right parties founded by President [PER Chirac  ] in 2002 . 
The meeting took place in [PER Sarkozy  ] 's office at the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] and was also attended by [PER Sarkozy  ] Chief of Staff [PER Claude Gueant  ] and [ORG Interior Ministry  ] Staffer [PER Cederic Goubet  ] . 
Embassy [PER Econ Counselor  ] , [PER Poloff  ] and Economic Analyst ( as interpreter ) accompanied Mr. [PER Hubbard  ] and Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] . 
ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT BUSH ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] expressed his admiration for President [PER Bush  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] said that , like the President , he too was committed to keeping his word and to dealing honestly with the real problems of the country , " unlike the rest of those politicians . 
" Throughout the hour-long meeting , [PER Sarkozy  ] returned again and again to the importance of leveling with people . 
He illustrated his point by saying the " [MISC French  ] people have to be told the truth -- and they want to hear it . 
" He added that most politicians , and specifically President [PER Chirac  ] , just keep stringing the people along with their " constant tergiversating . 
" [ORG Economic Council  ] Director [PER Hubbard  ] 's presentation of the President 's direct and principled tackling of [LOC America  ] 's major domestic challenges ( taxes , social security , education ) , drew the high compliment from [PER Sarkozy  ] that he too would like to tackle the same problems , in the same way , for [LOC France  ] . 
DISAGREEING WITH VERSUS UNDERCUTTING THE [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] lamented the troubled state of [MISC U.S.-France  ] relations during recent years . 
He drew a sharp distinction between disagreeing with friends and undercutting them . 
He said , " we should always be able to disagree . 
" Calling it something he " would never do " , he cited President [PER Chirac  ] 's , and then-Foreign Minister [PER de Villepin  ] 's , use of [LOC France  ] 's [ORG Security Council  ] veto against the [LOC U.S.  ] in February 2002 as an unjustifiable and excessive reaction to a difference of views . 
He added that he would have advised the [LOC U.S.  ] not to undertake the invasion and occupation of [LOC Iraq  ] -- but that that didn't prevent him from " feeling it personally when [MISC American  ] soldiers die in combat . 
" He proudly pointed out how , at the height of anti-American feeling and anti-U.S. demonstrations ( contemporaneous to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's first stint as Minister of the Interior ( 2002 - 2004 ) ) , he took it as a personal responsibility to see to it that " no [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy or Consulate was so much as touched " by demonstrators . 
IDENTIFYING WITH AMERICA'S VALUES --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) " They call me 'Sarkozy the [MISC American  ] , ' " he said , " they consider it an insult , but I take it as a compliment . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] stressed how much he " recognized himself " in [LOC America  ] 's values . 
He recalled how as a boy , he told his father that he wanted to grow up to be president . 
He said his [MISC Hungarian-born  ] father retorted , " In that case , go to [LOC America  ] -- because with a name like [PER Sarkozy  ] , you'll never make it here . 
" Proving that wrong , [PER Sarkozy  ] said , was a touchstone for his efforts both to succeed and to transform [LOC France  ] into a place where " outsiders " like him could also enjoy opportunity untrammeled by prejudice . 
Comment: Very much unlike nearly all other [MISC French  ] political figures , [PER Sarkozy  ] is viscerally pro-American . 
For most of his peers the [LOC U.S.  ] is a sometimes reviled or admired , but decidedly foreign , other . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] identifies with [LOC America  ] ; he sees his own rise in the world as reflecting an [MISC American-like  ] saga . 
End Comment . 
FIGHTING FRANCE'S ELITE ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] pointed to his own political career as an example of both his success and the difficulty of achieving it . 
" I 'm not a member of the elite...I 'm someone who wants to speak for the [LOC France  ] that gets up every morning and works , " he said , as he recalled his own rise from " knowing nobody and beginning as a simple party supporter , and climbing every step in the ladder " to his current bid for the presidency . 
With some vehemence , [PER Sarkozy  ] insisted on his having had to " challenge those stronger than me " every step of way . 
CONFIRMING HE WILL RUN ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] confirmed his intention to run for president to Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] and [ORG NEC  ] Director [PER Hubbard  ] , saying , " I am going to be a candidate in 2007 " . 
Outlining his campaign strategy , [PER Sarkozy  ] said , " we are going to propose change to the [MISC French  ] people . 
" " I 'm convinced that it can work...people want to believe they can succeed . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] then touched on many of his specific proposals for providing more opportunity for the able and more support for the disadvantaged -- tax cuts , labor law reform , affirmative action , immigration reform , and monetary policy that " recognizes that the currency is an instrument for supporting a strong economy . 
" RECALLING [PER REAGAN  ] , [PER THATCHER  ] AND [PER GONZALES  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On economic affairs , [PER Sarkozy  ] repeated his often-stated assertion that the [MISC French  ] economic model is " bad . 
" [LOC France  ] needs to do what [LOC Spain  ] , the [LOC UK  ] and other successful countries have done over the past twenty years ; take the best of what they have done and adopt those policies in [LOC France  ] . 
In response to Mr. [PER Hubbard  ] 's question on what [PER Sarkozy  ] 's economic vision for [LOC France  ] was , [PER Sarkozy  ] said that the [MISC French  ] people have to understand that they need to work more and that the Government must make it more profitable for people who do so . 
He said that [LOC France  ] needed to a go through a period similar to the [LOC U.S.  ] under [PER Reagan  ] , the [LOC UK  ] under [PER Thatcher  ] , and [LOC Spain  ] under [PER Gonzalez  ] . 
" [LOC France  ] is not an old country , " he said , " but right now it 's acting like one . 
" INCENTIVES FOR TAKING INITIATIVE -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] explained his theory that unemployment benefits should be higher than they currently are for people immediately after they are laid off . 
However they should quickly phase out to provide an incentive for people to look for work . 
Unemployed people should be required to look for work ; now they are not required to . 
Echoing comments made by Finance Minister [ORG Breton  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] said , " people are ready for the politics of truth . 
" He added that his directly expressed assessments of [LOC France  ] 's economic problems and his insistent advocacy of work , innovation and entrepreneurship in fact contribute to his popularity . 
" Some people told me never to say such things , people will hate you ; clearly they don't hate me , " he observed . 
OVER-VALUED EURO AND NO ALAN GREENSPAN -------------------------------------- 10 ( C ) On the deficit , [PER Sarkozy  ] said that for 25 years [LOC France  ] has been living beyond its means . 
Now it is paying the price for that . 
He said that the [LOC U.S.  ] had two advantages that [LOC France  ] did not have: " [PER Greenspan  ] and the dollar . 
" He said that [LOC France  ] was suffering from no longer having control of its own currency and observed that [ORG European Central Bank  ] ( [ORG ECB  ] ) president [PER Trichet  ] was pursuing exactly the wrong policies ; " he confuses a strong currency with a strong economy . 
" [LOC Europe  ] needed a pro-growth [ORG ECB  ] , not one focused on fighting inflation only . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , he observed , " has often had its strongest economy when the dollar was at its weakest . 
" Turning to Chairman [PER Greenspan  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] said , " he is a genius . 
A genius . 
He has pursued exactly the right policies . 
" FRANCE'S ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Returning to his priorities for [LOC France  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] noted that [LOC France  ] 's biggest challenges were outsourcing , a lagging research sector , savings that are " too static and don't really help move the economy , " and a lack of profitable mid-size companies ; " we have lots of big ones and lots of really small ones , but few in between . 
" He sees natural strengths for [LOC France  ] in the health , agriculture and food , transportation , communication and nuclear energy sectors . 
WORKING TOGETHER AT THE WTO --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Responding to Mr. [PER Hubbard  ] 's observation on the need for the [LOC Doha  ] trade round to move forward this autumn , [PER Sarkozy  ] agreed , and noted that the [ORG EU  ] needed to reach a better understanding with the [LOC U.S.  ] on agricultural issues . 
He said that [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] officials were talking but prescribed much more intensive discussion so that a common understanding could be reached . 
If that happened , he believed the upcoming [LOC Hong Kong  ] ministerial could be a success . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) For many years , [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] has been [LOC France  ] 's most popular politician . 
Current polls show his approval ratings holding steady at around 60 percent , and defeating any probable opponent in 2007 . 
By experience and conviction -- his experience as interior minister and his " liberal , " free-market oriented convictions -- he seems particularly well-suited to lead [LOC France  ] in meeting the key challenges it now faces: security in this era of global terrorism and prosperity in this era of adapting to economic globalization . 
In addition , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's deep identification with [MISC American  ] values -- opportunity , initiative , competition , society that sustains individual liberty as much as it supports national power , make him [LOC France  ] 's best hope for catalyzing the shift in social values that the [MISC French  ] need to make if they are to take full advantage of globalization . 
COMMENT CONTINUED ----------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's vision for [LOC France  ] is a powerful one , and , as his popularity reflects , it resonates with a big part of the electorate . 
However , resistance to social change is particularly strong in [LOC France  ] . 
Attachment to the benefits and advantages that most of them receive , in one way of another , from the state -- the substance of the " [MISC French  ] social model " -- is very strong among ordinary [MISC French  ] people . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's popularity may be a reflection of change the [MISC French  ] would like to make , but are too conservative to in fact undertake .
