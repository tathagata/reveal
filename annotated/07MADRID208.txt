<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MADRID  ] 000208 SIPDIS SIPDIS NOFORN FROM THE AMBASSADOR FOR SECRETARY GATES DEPT FOR A/S DAN FRIED ; [ORG NSC  ] FOR [PER JUDY ANSLEY  ] E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 02/05/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/MARR_0.html'>MARR</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: SPAIN: ZAPATERO'S DECISION ON [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] FIRM REF: [LOC MADRID  ] 00197 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Eduardo Aguirre  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) President [PER Zapatero  ] is highly unlikely to in the near term reverse his statement that [LOC Spain  ] will not augment its troop presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , thereby nixing the possibility of staffing the [ORG ISAF XI HQ  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] ( with some 120-150 personnel ) . 
This conclusion stems from Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] , s conversations over the past several days with senior level [MISC Spanish  ] officials , including Defense Minister [PER Alonso  ] and [ORG National Security  ] advisor-equivalent [PER Carles Casajuana  ] . 
A response to a call to Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] is pending. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) In several conversations with Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] , Defense Minister [PER Alonso  ] did not hide that he was despondent and clearly crestfallen that [PER Zapatero  ] had made this statement , which he made just one day after [PER Alonso  ] , s comment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that the [ORG GOS  ] was considering sending more troops . 
[PER Alonso  ] said that [ORG Zapatero  ] 's statement , which caught him completely by surprise , had been made it in such a way as to box the government in on the issue with little or no wiggle room , no political way to finesse a change of position , even a nuanced one . 
[PER Alonso  ] said he had gone back to [ORG Zapatero  ] to try to get him to change his mind , but to no avail . 
( The UK Ambassador to [LOC Spain  ] had also pressed [ORG GOS  ] , and reported to the Ambassador that [ORG GOS  ] had also expressed to him that [PER Alonso  ] had pressed the issue with [ORG Zapatero  ] but with no results ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Alonso  ] told the Ambassador that the reason for [ORG Zapatero  ] 's decision is based totally on domestic politics , and had nothing to do with [ORG NATO  ] per se . 
The Ambassador noted that [LOC Spain  ] was coming into an electoral season as regional/local elections loom in May and later in March 2008 . 
[PER Alonso  ] acknowledged that we had a good understanding of the political scene here . 
[PER Alonso  ] hoped that this should not terminate the good defense relations between the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Spain  ] . 
The Ambassador told [PER Alonso  ] that we are well versed in the ups and downs of this relationship over the past several years and that we expect our high points , and then soon after , a low point . 
But this issue is critical to [ORG NATO  ] and to the [MISC Allies  ] fighting in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and calls into question [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Alonso  ] insisted [LOC Spain  ] remained committed to [ORG NATO  ] ; I said that failure to take the [ORG HQ  ] component it is very serious. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The Ambassador called [ORG Zapatero  ] 's national security advisor [PER Carles Casajuana  ] to make clear [LOC Washington  ] 's and the [ORG Embassy  ] 's disappointment about the [ORG Zapatero  ] decision . 
[PER Casajuana  ] said he had had a conversation with [ORG NSC  ] [MISC European Senior Director  ] [PER Judy Ansley  ] a few days ago . 
[PER Casajuana  ] said that [ORG Zapatero  ] had made the decision mostly for domestic political purposes and for some national security reasons . 
He said the [ORG GOS  ] had sold the [MISC Spanish  ] public on military participation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] on the basis of its humanitarian , reconstruction and stability mission , and much less so as an aggressive military deployment . 
[PER Casajuana  ] said that as the military situation has become more difficult , this creates political problems in terms of public perceptions in a very heated [MISC Spanish  ] political environment . 
An increase in the [MISC Spanish  ] deployment - even to staff the [ORG ISAF HQ  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] - would be blown out of proportion by the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] , which has severely criticized the [ORG Zapatero  ] government for any troop deployments , charging that [ORG Zapatero  ] is hypocritical for having condemned [MISC Spanish  ] deployments under the [ORG Aznar  ] government , only to do so himself now that he is in power . 
At the same time , [PER Casajuana  ] said , from the national security/military strategy perspective , [LOC Spain  ] fully supports the military imperative of [ORG NATO  ] , s current strategy , but is not willing to participate in an augmentation of [MISC Spanish  ] troops . 
He said the [ORG GOS  ] will invest in training [MISC Afghan  ] security forces , which is very expensive , and remains fully committed to the [MISC Spanish  ] deployments in [LOC Western Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Casajuana  ] insisted that [LOC Spain  ] wants a good relationship with the [LOC US  ] and to have an excellent bilateral meeting between [ORG SecDef  ] Gates and Defense Minister [PER Alonso  ] , and hopes for a successful Ministerial . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] repeated our concern and disappointment about the decision by President [PER Zapatero  ] not to meet [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to staff the [ORG Kabul ISAF HQ  ] . 
He further indicated that our public [LOC MADRID  ] 00000208 002.2 OF 002 position to this turn of events was still under review . 
In the event that we underplay the seriousness of the situation in the media , [PER Casajuana  ] needed to understand that a reasoned reaction did not diminish our deep concern and disappointment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) In a pending call to Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] , Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] will make clear that Secretary Rice had understood [PER Moratinos  ] to say during their Jan. 25 meeting in [LOC Paris  ] ( on the margins of the [LOC Lebanon  ] Donor 's Conference ) that [LOC Spain  ] would meet its commitments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and that [LOC Washington  ] is very disappointed. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Embassy  ] Comment: [ORG Zapatero  ] , s comments caught his entire team by surprise , including [PER Alonso  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] , the new MOD SYG for Policy [PER Luis Cuesta  ] , and [ORG MFA Political Director  ] ( number three-equivalent Dezcallar ) . 
Working with A/S Fried and USNATO Ambassador [LOC Nuland  ] , who have also been in touch with senior [MISC Spanish  ] officials , [ORG Embassy  ] is examining next steps with the [MISC Spanish  ] government , including our public stance . 
We want to avoid boxing [PER Zapatero  ] even more tightly into the corner he has constructed for himself , hoping against hope that at the [ORG NATO  ] Defense Ministerial in [LOC Seville  ] ( or [ORG SecDef  ] 's Bilateral meeting with [PER Alonso  ] ) we find some shred of hope that a way can be found for him to meet the [ORG ISAF  ] commitment without increasing troop presence , or other formula to fix the problem or make up for it in a big way . 
At the same time , we don't want to let [ORG Zapatero  ] off the hook on something so important to the [LOC Alliance  ] and [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to it . 
[PER Alonso  ] , who has actively sought good relations with the [LOC US  ] and found ways to advance that interest , will be receptive to [ORG SecDef  ] 's arguments on the subject , but he has been undercut publicly by President [ORG Zapatero  ] despite their long friendship and close ties .
