Cretz  ] , Ambassador , US Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: The Executive Director of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] , told [ORG STAFFDEL Grove  ] that the [ORG Foundation  ] served as an " umbrella society " for [LOC Libya  ] 's developing [ORG NGO  ] community pushing for humanitarian development , national reconciliation for past human rights violations , and political reforms that enshrined individual rights . 
The Foundation is registered in [LOC Switzerland  ] , and therefore subject to annual , independent review by a [MISC Swiss  ] auditor and has an annual operating budget of approximately $3.25 million . 
While Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi serves as the [ORG Foundation 's  ] chair , he receives no remuneration and a Board comprised of both [MISC Libyan  ] and foreign -- including [MISC American  ] -- representatives guide its policy . 
[PER Sawani  ] told the [ORG STAFFDEL  ] that the [ORG QDF  ] had served as the facilitator for various international organizations operating in [LOC Libya  ] , including [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] and [ORG Amnesty International  ] , and that the Foundation actively promoted the founding of additional [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG NGOs  ] . 
In a subsequent lunch with international organizations and major donors , the [ORG STAFFDEL  ] was encouraged to " make do with [ the organizations ] we have in [LOC Libya  ] " . 
Noting that would-be civil society leaders were , under the current political reality , able to function only under the [ORG QDF  ] banner , the [LOC UK  ] Ambassador counseled that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" should not be frightened by the name [ORG Qadhafi  ] " but instead seek opportunities that benefited both [MISC Libyan  ] and [MISC American  ] interests to build trust and a foundation for political and economic change . 
End Summary . 
QDF: A THINK TANK AND ENGINE FOR DEVELOPMENT 2 . 
( C ) In a December 8 meeting with the Ambassador and [PER Paul Grove  ] of the [MISC Senate Appropriations  ] - Foreign Operations Subcommittee , [ORG Qadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Executive Director [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] described the [ORG QDF  ] 's mission as " humanitarian diplomacy " and applying pressure on the [MISC Libyan  ] government to implement economic and political reforms . 
[PER Sawani  ] characterized the Foundation as operating as an " umbrella society " that enables the work of five independent organizations ( list them here ) . 
Saif al-Islam founded the first of these organizations in 1999 to discourage the use of drugs among [MISC Libyan  ] youth and formally established the [ORG QDF  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] in 2003 . 
Still a registered [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG NGO  ] , the [ORG QDF  ] is audited on an annual basis by [MISC Swiss  ] independent auditors and is subject to [MISC Swiss  ] law . 
[PER Sawani  ] reported that the Foundation 's annual operational budget remains near 4 million [MISC Libyan  ] dinar ( $3.25 million ) and that Saif al-Islam , the [ORG QDF  ] 's chairman , receives no remuneration from its activities . 
According to [PER Sawani  ] , Saif al-Islam also pays for his official travel on QDF-related business with his own personal funds . 
[PER Sawani  ] confided that should Saif al-Islam take on the official government role as General Coordinator of the [ORG Social Committees  ] to which he has been named , he will be required to resign his position as [ORG QDF  ] 's chairman . 
3 . 
( C ) Describing the [ORG QDF  ] 's operations as a series of partnerships and pilot initiatives to foster the creation of [ORG NGOs  ] and facilitate the work of international [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Sawani  ] said that some of those partnerships had faced serious resistance from government officials . 
Most recently , the [ORG QDF  ] had facilitated [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] 's ( [ORG HRW  ] ) research studies in [LOC Libya  ] in early 2009 and the December launching of [ORG HRW  ] 's [LOC Libya  ] report from [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
The [ORG QDF  ] concurrently released its own human rights report that recounted human rights violations , corruption , lack of transparency , and acts of impunity by security officials . 
Admitting that the [ORG QDF  ] 's report was a " pre-emptive strike " intending to take air out of [MISC Libyan  ] officials' arguments that the [ORG HRW  ] report was designed to undermine the regime , [PER Sawani  ] said that Saif al-Islam considered it to be an important piece of the [MISC South African-style  ] national reconciliation he sees as necessary for [LOC Libya  ] to move forward on political reforms . 
Saif 's frustration with the pace and scope of political reforms led directly to his August 2008 decision to withdraw from politics , according to [PER Sawani  ] . 
4 . 
( C ) In addition to working closely with [ORG HRW  ] , [PER Sawani  ] noted that the [ORG QDF  ] had close partnerships with various international organizations including [ORG Amnesty International  ] , the [ORG Arab Alliance for Human Rights  ] , [ORG UNICEF  ] , the [ORG World Health Organization  ] , the [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] , the [ORG International Committee  ] for the [ORG Red Cross  ] , and [ORG UNESCO  ] , among others . 
While the independent constituent societies can and do have their own relationships with these organizations , [PER Sawani  ] said that the [ORG QDF  ] 's status both domestically and internationally often made initial interaction through the [ORG Foundation  ] more palatable for [MISC Libyan  ] authorities . 
He cited the [ORG Human Rights Society of Libya  ] 's five-year project with the [ORG UK-based Law Society  ] to prevent torture and promote human rights in [MISC Libyan  ] detention centers as an example of a relationship forged with the [ORG QDF  ] 's assistance that had since devolved entirely to the subsidiary [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000074 002 OF 002 group -- a model that the [ORG QDF  ] seeks to continue in order to build a more effective and engaged civil society . 
5 . 
( C ) Codifying political reform and increased space for dissent were top recommendations in [ORG HRW  ] 's December 2009 report , and [PER Sawani  ] reported that both remain top priorities for the [ORG QDF  ] . 
Its premier initiative , according to [PER Sawani  ] , is a five-year project to draft and implement a new constitution . 
The drafting committee , like the [ORG QDF  ] 's own board , consists of both [MISC Libyans  ] and foreigners -- including several [MISC Americans  ] . 
The [ORG QDF  ] is also studying changes to [LOC Libya  ] 's penal code and , in a consultative capacity , the [ORG QDF  ] is promoting legislation currently under review by [LOC Libya  ] 's General People 's [ORG Congress  ] that would allow the legal formation of [ORG NGOs  ] and other associations . 
[PER Sawani  ] lamented that the Foundation had a mixed record of helping establish independent [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Libya  ] , noting that the [ORG QDF-assisted Center for Democracy  ] and the [ORG Libyan Justice Society  ] had its licenses revoked within 96 hours of formation . 
Nonetheless , [PER Sawani  ] judged that the [ORG QDF  ] would continue to play an important role as a " think tank " and civil society incubator for the foreseeable future . 
INTERNATIONAL PARTERS: WORK IN [LOC LIBYA  ] WITH THE TOOLS AVAILABLE 6 . 
( C ) In a lunch with representatives from the [ORG UN  ] , [ORG IOM  ] , [ORG European Commission  ] , and [PER UK Embassy  ] , the consensus opinion was that [LOC Libya  ] required extensive engagement to be brought up to international standards on development and good governance but lacked the necessary expertise and decision makers to implement those programs . 
The [MISC British  ] Ambassador told [PER Grove  ] , " We need to work with what we have in [LOC Libya  ] , and you shouldn't be frightened by the name [ORG Qadhafi  ] . 
It goes with the territory . 
" The [ORG UN  ] Resident Coordinator said that even his organization was limited in its reach due to [LOC Libya  ] 's boycott of [ORG UNESCO  ] . 
( Note: The boycott is due to [MISC Libyan  ] sensitivities with [ORG UNESCO  ] 's [MISC Bulgarian  ] leadership . 
[LOC Libya  ] continues to protest [LOC Bulgaria  ] 's presidential welcome of five [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses , who had been sentenced to death in [LOC Libya  ] , on return to [LOC Sofia  ] after over seven years in prison . 
End Note ) . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER UK Poloff  ] assessed that the [ORG QDF  ] stood out as an organization comprised of young , energetic [MISC Libyans  ] that would go on to become civil society leaders as political space opens . 
All agreed that it was important for any engagement with the [MISC Libyan  ] government to find a high-level champion for the project -- one who could make the case for implementation , especially within a system run by regime hardliners that are resistant to change . 
Only through steadily building both trust and capacity could [MISC Libyan  ] organizations effectively participate in international cooperation without using groups like the [ORG QDF  ] as an intermediary . 
The [MISC British  ] Ambassador opined that " it 's our job to deliver what [ [LOC Libya  ] ] can absorb , which means starting engagement on their terms . 
" The [ORG UN  ] representative agreed , noting that [LOC Libya  ] remained at " stage zero " on some elements of development and that basic support for programs designed to teach young , civic-minded [MISC Libyans  ] [MISC English  ] language and computer skills would pay dividends as [LOC Libya  ] continues to open politically .
