( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a January 5 meeting , [ORG Israeli Security Agency  ] ( [ORG ISA  ] ) Director [PER Yuval Diskin  ] gave a frank account of the December 26 [MISC Israeli  ] operation in [LOC Nablus  ] and his assessment of the current state of [LOC Israel-PA  ] security cooperation . 
[PER Diskin  ] noted that he had publicly cited real improvements across the board in [ORG PASF  ] willingness and ability to target [ORG Hamas  ] and [LOC Islamic Jihad  ] terror networks on the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
He said he was also satisfied with the level of information and intelligence sharing between the [ORG PA  ] and the [ORG GOI  ] , which he characterized as " not fully transparent , but transparent enough . 
" [PER Diskin  ] noted that bilateral security cooperation is the best that it has been in the last 16 years , since the [MISC Oslo Agreement  ] . 
He added , however , that this impressive progress had to be measured from a very low base ; things had been so bad in the past that many root problems remain. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In particular , said [PER Diskin  ] , the [ORG PASF  ] finds it difficult to act against [MISC Fatah-linked  ] groups , like the [ORG Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade  ] , with the same speed and reponsiveness that they show against [ORG Hamas  ] or PIJ targets . 
It was this sense of reluctance to act that led the [ORG GOI  ] to move on its own against the [ORG al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade  ] cell identified as the killers of Rabbi [PER Hai  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that the ringleader , [ORG XXXXXX  ] , was a protege of [LOC XXXXXXX  ] and was vying for influence in [LOC Nablus  ] with another participant in the " fugitive program , " [LOC XXXXXXX  ] , whom [PER Diskin  ] characterized as a positive influence . 
He said that his people on the ground in the [LOC West Bank  ] had received strong indications that the [ORG PASF  ] considered [PER XXXXX  ] , a former [ORG Tanzim  ] militiaman , " untouchable . 
" According to [PER Diskin  ] , [PER XXXXX  ] had been working very hard to restore the old Fatah terror infrastructure in [LOC Nablus.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Diskin  ] said neither [ORG Shin Bet  ] nor the [ORG PASF  ] had had any alert about the attack on Rabbi [PER Hai  ] . 
He regretted that the IDF had killed [PER XXXXX  ] and two of his three accomplices , since they would have been useful in helping determine the extent of the [ORG XXXXXX  ] network . 
However , forensic evidence left no doubt that a weapon belonging to [PER XXXX  ] was the murder weapon . 
[PER Diskin  ] added that the [ORG PASF  ] has since uncovered more weapons and explosives cached by [PER XXXXX  ] and his accomplices , but has not yet briefed the [ORG GOI  ] or turned over the materiel . 
A fourth accomplice , who [ORG Shin Bet  ] believes was the driver of the vehicle from which Rabbi [PER Hai  ] was shot , is a [ORG PA Preventive Security  ] employee , according to [PER Diskin  ] , who was arrested by the [ORG PASF  ] the evening of the murder and is still being interrogated . 
Another in custody is also a [ORG PA  ] employee . 
[PER Diskin  ] said the [MISC Palestinians  ] had been very discomfited by a [ORG PASF  ] employee being involved in the attack , adding that he had gone out of his way not to add to their embarrassment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Diskin  ] stressed that the [ORG GOI  ] respects the fugitive agreement and has never violated it . 
He added that the [ORG PASF  ] has still not met all of the conditions of the deal . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that he had had a very tense conversation with PM [PER Fayyad  ] on the 26th during which he had pointed out that the [ORG PASF  ] had still not collected weapons from about a third of the fugitives covered by the deal . 
According to [PER Diskin  ] , he told [PER Fayyad  ] that he should leverage the current situation and [MISC Israeli  ] respect for the terms of the agreement to enforce the conditions of the deal and begin collecting weapons . 
In [PER Diskin  ] 's view , stepping up weapons collection would be a major signal that the [ORG PA  ] is serious about moving forward with security cooperation ; he hinted that the [ORG GOI  ] would be ready to respond by expanding the fugitive program . 
However , in [PER Diskin  ] 's view , PSO Director [PER Ziad Hab-al-Rih  ] is not yet ready to deliver on the remaining weapons commitments . 
[PER Diskin  ] said this was not yet a strategic problem for the [ORG GOI  ] , but it would become one if it were ignored . 
He said the ability of the [ORG PASF  ] to deal with Fatah groups is the " framework " for mutual security assurances and the [ORG PA  ] must deliver on it . 
[PER Diskin  ] said he would give the [ORG PA  ] two or three weeks to let things calm down and then would raise weapons collection with [PER Abu Mazen.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Diskin  ] said he had had follow-on meetings with [ORG PASF  ] contacts that were " friendly , professional and sincere . 
" In his view , however , they were not " full and frank " because the current [ORG PA  ] political culture does not yet permit it . 
[PER Diskin  ] said the [ORG PA  ] had contained the event , which was not easy for them to do politically , and he gave high marks to [PER Fayyad  ] for demonstrating leadership by visiting [LOC Nablus  ] on the day of the funeral . 
Regarding [PER Fayyad  ] 's pitch for increased authority in areas of the [LOC West Bank  ] , [PER Diskin  ] said this is a political question that needs to be negotiated . 
As a security professional , [PER Diskin  ] said he would support it so long as the [ORG PA  ] continues to make progress . 
" They are not far from full compliance with the fugitive deal , " said [PER Diskin  ] , " so how can we use the [LOC Nablus  ] events to move forward ?
