End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX , [PER Miliband  ] saw [PER Karzai  ] for about an hour in [LOC Kabul  ] on November 25 , with Foreign Minister [PER Spanta  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor Rassoul  ] , Chief of [PER Staff Daudzai  ] , and [PER Spokesperson Hamidzada  ] present on the [MISC Afghan  ] side . 
[LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Cowper-Coles  ] joined [PER Miliband  ] . 
ELECTIONS ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] told [PER Miliband  ] that it would be difficult or impossible to hold a credible Presidential election , not just in [LOC Helmand  ] , but also in the provinces of [LOC Zabul  ] , [LOC Farah  ] , [LOC Kandahar  ] and [LOC Ghazni  ] . 
Although [LOC Zabul  ] was small , in many ways it was as difficult as [LOC Helmand  ] . 
That made a spring date proposed by the Parliament impossible . 
[PER Karzai  ] was confident that early agreement on a date would be reached . 
AFGHAN/U.S . 
RELATIONS ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] related to [PER Miliband  ] that President-elect [PER Obama  ] had been “very supportive , very committed8 during their telephone conversation the previous week . 
He said [PER Obama  ] had promised to send a team to [LOC Afghanistan  ] soon after the inauguration . 
[PER Karzai  ] noted that his government was preparing three papers for the [LOC U.S.  ] and the international community on security , governance , and economic issues . 
The security paper had already been sent to the [LOC U.S.  ] It covered civilian casualties , and ending house searches and arbitrary arrests of [MISC Afghans  ] by coalition forces . 
[PER Karzai  ] instructed Rassoul to see that the paper was also sent to &NATO headquarters8 . 
GOVERNANCE/ECONOMY ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] told [PER Miliband  ] that the [ORG Independent Directorate of Local Governance  ] ( [ORG IDLG  ] ) were in the course of preparing a paper which would call for an end to parallel structures . 
He said that Afghanistan’s USD 13.4b of reserves were the &best in the world8 . 
The paper on economic issues would be for the [MISC Americans  ] alone and would deal with some of the abuses to which their aid was subject . 
In particular , [LOC Afghanistan  ] wanted to end the way in which the [MISC Americans  ] sub-contracted major parts of their aid program to “doubtful contractors.” He was also concerned that many of the private security companies were little more than “criminal organizations.” The same applied to some of the transport companies used by the [LOC U.S.  ] ; it had become apparent to [PER Karzai  ] that the transport companies were responsible for much of the insecurity on the highways , in order to extract higher fees and insurance payments from the [MISC Americans  ] . 
RECONCILIATION --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Miliband  ] commented to [PER Karzai  ] that , after seven years , it was important to offer a perspective on how all expected the conflict to end . 
Reconciliation , subject to strict conditions , would obviously be part of that . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed , saying that he had consulted &the whole [MISC Afghan  ] people , 8 and they were all in favor of reconciliation . 
They wanted to “bring over the good guys , while excluding the bad guys.” [PER Karzai  ] realizes that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] had doubts about reconciliation , but this was something that the [MISC Afghan  ] people wanted , and which he was bound to press ahead [LOC LONDON  ] 00002964 002 OF 003 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Miliband  ] welcomed the warm relations between [PER Karzai  ] and [PER Zardari  ] , and spoke of the need to extend that relationship into other areas , and systemize it . 
It would be important to underpin contacts at the highest level with a clear work plan , and timeframe , for practical contacts at other levels . 
The [MISC Pakistanis  ] were now fighting the [MISC Taleban  ] , [PER Miliband  ] continued , and needed to be encouraged and supported in this . 
The [LOC UK  ] stood ready to help in any way it could with the [LOC Af/Pak  ] relationship . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX said that [PER Karzai  ] welcomed all this . 
He had had a good talk with [PER Zardari  ] November 24 and was looking forward to him paying a state visit in December . 
[PER Karzai  ] opined that [LOC Pakistan  ] wanted to cooperate with [LOC Afghanistan  ] , without the [MISC Americans  ] being involved . 
[PER Spanta  ] explained that there were three levels to [LOC Af/Pak  ] cooperation: bilateral , trilateral and multilateral . 
[PER Miliband  ] added that [PER Zardari  ] seemed genuinely committed to tackling terrorism , and to working with [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and seemed gradually to be extending his control over other parts of the [MISC Pakistani  ] state , including the military . 
[PER Karzai  ] expressed skepticism about how far [PER Zardari  ] , s writ yet ran , but said that he hoped the [LOC UK  ] would get involved energetically in supporting [LOC Af/Pak  ] cooperation . 
[MISC AFGHAN  ] INTERNAL ISSUES ------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Miliband  ] welcomed Interior Minister [PER Atmar  ] , s appointment , and said that the [LOC UK  ] would give him “every support , “ which [PER Karzai  ] welcomed , noting that he had given [PER Atmar  ] a &blank check8 to deal with corruption . 
His only advice to [PER Atmar  ] had been to maintain the ethnic balance in the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] . 
[PER Miliband  ] also welcomed the dismissal , for corruption , of the Transport Minister . 
[PER Karzai  ] said that he had had no option , but it had been a “regrettable step.” ANA/ANP -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Miliband  ] noted recent improvements in the [ORG ANA  ] , and the fact that the units in [LOC Helmand  ] had reached “Capability [PER Milestone One  ] , ” but progress on the [ORG ANA  ] had not been matched by progress on policing . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed , saying that the failure to reform the [MISC Afghan  ] Police ( [ORG ANP  ] ) had been the fault of “Afghanistan’s friends.” [PER Karzai  ] underlined that the international community had at last realized what needed to be done on the police , and said he was concerned that the failure to act quickly had undermined the trust which the [MISC Afghan  ] people had in their government and in the international community . 
POLITICAL OUTREACH ----------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] said that political outreach needed to start at village level , and extend through the district and provincial levels . 
Communities needed to be re-empowered , in the name of the war on terror . 
Those communities had been damaged by the [MISC Soviet  ] invasion , and by radicalization , much of it paid for by the [LOC West  ] . 
The [ORG IDLG  ] was now trying to address this . 
[PER Karzai  ] added that he had replaced all but five or six governors . 
He was also busy signing new appointments of district governors . 
[PER Miliband  ] noted that the [LOC UK  ] had agreed to support the [MISC Afghan  ] Social Outreach Program in three districts in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] said that he was a “greedy man” in respect to [LOC Helmand  ] ; he wanted the whole province to benefit . 
[PER Miliband  ] added that the [LOC UK  ] was determined to work with [LOC Helmand  ] Governor [PER Mangal  ] , and to give him support in engaging with the tribes . 
He emphasized the need to maximize the advantages which the arrival of more [LOC U.S.  ] troops would bring. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] emphasized that more [LOC U.S.  ] troops were not the answer . 
He hoped the [MISC Americans  ] would consult the [MISC Afghan  ] Government before sending more troops . 
[PER Karzai  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] had failed to send the troops for which [PER Karzai  ] had asked in 2002 , but now it might be too late . 
He hoped the [ORG ANA  ] and coalition forces would cooperate more closely , and that the increase in the [ORG ANA  ] could be delivered much sooner than 2012 . 
The ground in the east was well covered , but there were not enough troops in other parts of the country . 
According to [PER Karzai  ] , the [MISC Afghan  ] population did not want more foreign troops at this stage. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Miliband  ] ended the meeting by underlining that [LOC LONDON  ] 00002964 003 OF 003 the [LOC UK  ] public needed reassuring about the “Afghanistan project.” [PER Karzai  ] , s own prestige in [LOC Britain  ] meant that he was uniquely well placed to do this . 
[PER Miliband  ] hoped therefore that [PER Karzai  ] would consider writing an open letter to the [MISC British  ] people . 
Cowper-Coles promised to follow up on this with [PER Karzai  ] , s spokesman . 
SOUTH WITH [PER SPANTA  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) After the meeting with [PER Karzai  ] , [PER Miliband  ] and [PER Spanta  ] flew to [LOC Camp Bastion  ] . 
During the flight [PER Spanta  ] emphasized to [PER Miliband  ] the need to address the suspicions which the [MISC Afghan  ] people still had of [LOC Britain  ] . 
He also lobbied for the [LOC UK  ] to do more with ethnic groups other than [PER Pashtuns  ] ( Comment: [PER Spanta  ] is a [MISC Tajik  ] . 
End comment ) . 
[PER Spanta  ] suggested that the [LOC UK  ] should engage with the universities in [LOC Heart  ] and [LOC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] , and have a much higher profile among [PER Tajiks  ] . 
[LOC Britain  ] was suspected among many in [LOC Afghanistan  ] of having a pro-Pashtun policy . 
[PER Spanta  ] also argued for [LOC Britain  ] to do more to help restore the electricity supply to [LOC Kabul  ] . 
Minister of Energy [PER Ismael Khan  ] needed USD 42m to address [LOC Kabul  ] , s energy problems . 
[LOC HELMAND  ] --------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Miliband  ] and [PER Spanta  ] carried out three engagements in [LOC Helmand:  ] a visit to [LOC Garmsir  ] , to review progress since its liberation from the [MISC Taleban  ] earlier in the year ; a visit to [LOC Lashkar Gah  ] , to meet the Governor [PER Mangal  ] and other provincial notables ; and a visit to the [ORG ANA  ] training camp at [LOC Camp Shorabak  ] , adjacent to [LOC Camp Bastion  ] . 
[LOC GARMSIR  ] --------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) In [LOC Garmsir  ] , [PER Miliband  ] was received by the District Chief , [PER Abdullah Jan  ] , and gained a variety of insights into &good enough8 governance , [MISC Afghan-style  ] . 
A large number of local elders turned out , at virtually no notice , and then accompanied [PER Miliband  ] and [PER Spanta  ] on a walkabout through the bazaar , during which [PER Miliband  ] bought locally-produced pomegranates . 
According to [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , none of this would have been possible only a few months ago and is a reflection of the improving security situation . 
[PER Miliband  ] and [PER Spanta  ] also reviewed and met troops of the [ORG ANA  ] , and of the Queen , s [ORG Dragoon Guards  ] and 1 Rifles , the latter the lead unit for mentoring the [ORG ANA  ] in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
GOVERNOR [PER MANGAL  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) In [LOC Lashkar Gah  ] , [PER Miliband  ] assured [PER Mangal  ] of continuing [LOC UK  ] support . 
[PER Mangal  ] spoke of his many achievements , and expressed gratitude for support from [ORG HMG  ] . 
During a joint press conference , [PER Spanta  ] voiced strong support for [PER Mangal  ] , which [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] considers a significant sign of [MISC Karzai’s  ] personal stake in seeing [PER Spanta  ] succeed in [LOC Helmand  ] .
