( [ORG SBU  ] ) Post received January 3 a copy of a note sent from the [ORG GOL  ] 's [ORG Civil Aviation Committee  ] to airlines announcing that as of 7 January , all tourist visa holders -- except bearers of [MISC Egyptian  ] and [MISC Tunisian  ] passports -- will be required to present USD 1000 or the equivalent in another convertible currency as a requirement for entry to [LOC Libya  ] . 
On January 6 , the [ORG Consular Section  ] was able to confirm with the [ORG MFA  ] 's Head of [ORG Consular Affairs  ] , [PER Ahmed Ameish  ] , that the law would take effect January 7 . 
[PER Ameish  ] stated that travelers checks , bank statements and credit cards would not/not be accepted ; the requirement is for " currency " . 
( Note: The [MISC Egyptian  ] and [MISC Tunisian  ] Embassies have confirmed that their citizens are not/not subject to the new requirement . 
End note . 
) 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Similar to the passport translation requirement ( reftel ) , this law has apparently been on the books for a number of years , but was not enforced in the recent past . 
[PER Ameish  ] provided no reason for the change . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Foreign airlines ( [MISC British  ] , [ORG KLM  ] , [ORG Swissair  ] , [ORG Lufthansa  ] ) indicate that they will not/not be checking currency holdings at the time of check-in at [MISC European  ] airports . 
As in the case of the passport translation , it is not clear to us , other diplomatic missions or the airlines how the currency requirement will be implemented . 
We will likely only obtain a clearer picture over time as the parameters of who is turned back shape up . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] and [MISC Italian  ] Embassies are advising on their respective Foreign Office websites that citizens from their countries traveling on tourist visas comply with the new rule . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] received notification of this requirement via a copy of the [ORG Civil Aviation  ] notice that was sent to airlines , which [ORG Swissair  ] forwarded to us . 
We received no notification from the [ORG GOL  ] . 
We learned from the [LOC U.K.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] on January 6 that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG People 's Bureau  ] in [LOC Rome  ] notified [ORG EU  ] embassies there about ten days ago that the new requirement would be implemented . 
The [ORG EU  ] Embassies in [LOC Tripoli  ] learned about the currency requirement shortly after the New Year 's holiday from their counterparts in [LOC Rome  ] and have since met in [LOC Tripoli  ] to discuss options for engaging the [ORG GOL  ] . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: There is considerable speculation as to the reasons for implementation of the rule . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] and [MISC Italian  ] missions are convinced that the new strictures will be broadly applied ; the [MISC German  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] missions have insisted they will not apply to [MISC European  ] and [ORG North American  ] travelers . 
Citing unconfirmed reports , the latter contend that the strictures are designed to prevent more sub-Saharan [MISC African  ] guest workers from entering [LOC Libya  ] . 
While it is not clear which sub-Saharan [MISC Africans  ] are able to enter [LOC Libya  ] visa-free and which obtain tourist visas on arrival , the [ORG Civil Aviation  ] note specifies that even citizens of countries exempted from entry visa requirements are subject to the new rule ( except , again , [MISC Egyptians  ] and [MISC Tunisians  ] ) . 
As with the passport translation issue , the [ORG MFA  ] was unable to articulate any reason for the currency requirement ( beyond that it was already on the books ) , nor did it provide any advance notice to missions in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Both changes will be enforced by Immigration , rather than the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Consular Affairs Department  ] . 
End comment .
