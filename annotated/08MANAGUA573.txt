( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary and Background: Fifteen months into his second administration , [PER Ortega  ] continues to skillfully use his political pact with former President and convicted felon , [PER Arnoldo Aleman  ] to keep pro-democracy forces divided , vulnerable to coercion , and unable to mount sustained opposition . 
[PER Ortega  ] continues to allow [LOC U.S.  ] and other donor assistance programs to operate , though he regularly attacks the evils of " savage capitalist imperialism . 
" Our cooperation with the Police and Military remains good , both for training and in fighting narcotics and other forms of trafficking--but [PER Ortega  ] continues his quest to bring both institutions under his direct control . 
[PER Ortega  ] 's has strengthened ties with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] , and become openly sympathetic to the [ORG FARC  ] . 
Our access to the government has decreased dramatically , with even routine items requiring Ambassadorial intervention . 
[ORG Civil Society  ] and the media are under attack . 
Elections on the [LOC Atlantic Coast  ] remain suspended . 
Underlying the political and policy turmoil , [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's economic indicators are not encouraging . 
This message provides an assessment of some of the trends we observe from [PER Ortega  ] and his government after fifteen months . 
End Summary . 
[PER Ortega  ] 's Faltering Economy - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) In 2007 , the [ORG Ortega Administration  ] coasted on the achievements of the [LOC Bolanos  ] government , but that ride is about to end . 
The government essentially adopted Bolanos' 2007 and 2008 budgets , and used them as the basis for negotiating a new [ORG Poverty Reduction  ] and [ORG Growth Facility Agreement  ] with the [ORG IMF  ] . 
Foreign investment remained stable in 2007 thanks to commitments made during the [LOC Bolanos  ] years . 
Exports are up this year by 21% over 2007 levels . 
In most other respects , however , the [PER Ortega  ] government is not faring well . 
Growth expectations have fallen while inflation expectations have risen . 
In 2007 , inflation reached 17% and annualized inflation is running at 22% for 2008 , the second highest rate in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
The lack of a strong policy response to rising oil and food prices worries independent economists , some of whom suspect that hidden foreign assistance from [PER Hugo Chavez  ] has created excess liquidity . 
Minimum wages rose 30% in the last year , but still do not cover the soaring cost of food and transportation . 
To quell demand and keep prices down , the government removed import tariffs on basic food items through December 2008 , made documenting export shipments more difficult , and instructed the state-owned grain storage company to intervene in local markets . 
So far in 2008 , the [ORG Agricultural Ministry  ] has failed to deliver needed seeds to farmers in time for planting , although it has become aware of the urgency need to do so . 
More radical measures related to food supply may be coming , as President [PER Ortega  ] has just concluded a regional [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000573 002 OF 008 " food sovereignty " summit in [LOC Managua  ] on May 7 . 
In other areas , line ministries continue to fall short of spending targets , leaving needed infrastructure and other capital projects on the drawing board and causing the construction sector to suffer . 
Tourism and power sectors , both key to national economic development plans , limp along as the result of government mismanagement . 
While the economic slowdown in the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's largest export market and source of investment , has attracted political rhetoric , the government has no clear policy response . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] has lowered its expectations for economic growth in 2008 to 3.8% from 4.5% in January , but most economists believe that the figure will be closer to 3.0% . 
Manipulating Economics for Political Ends: CENIs - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In December 2006 , we identified several key indicators ( [ORG REF L  ] ) that would guide our assessment of how well [PER Ortega  ] was fulfilling his campaign promises to the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] people , including adherence to fiscally responsible , sound macroeconomic , free market policies . 
Fifteen months later the results are disturbing . 
On April 15 , the government failed to pay on a set of government bonds ( CENIs ) that it has issued to compensate healthy banks for absorbing the assets and liabilities of insolvent banks at the beginning of the decade ( [ORG REF  ] C ) . 
The bond issue was originally politicized in 2006 by [PER Arnoldo Aleman  ] , but resurrected by President [PER Ortega  ] to investigate the leading opposition figure , [PER Eduardo Montealegre  ] , who is running for [MISC Managua Mayor  ] against the [ORG FSLN  ] candidate , former three-time world champion boxer , [PER Alexis Arguello  ] . 
Nonpayment on the bonds may damage [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's relationship with the [ORG IMF  ] and other international financial institutions , and already caused credit rating agencies to put two [MISC Nicaraguan  ] banks on a ratings watch . 
As a consequence , since April 15 , the government has been unable sell public debt instruments--no one is buying . 
Nevertheless , key government officials are seemingly convinced that they can navigate this slippery slope to their political advantage , much as they did when they deployed [MISC Sandinista  ] judges and government institutions to force [ORG ExxonMobil  ] to buy [MISC Venezuelan  ] oil . 
( C ) [ORG U.S. Citizen Property Claims  ] ) A meltdown in the works ? - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Another of the vital markers we identified in 2006 was government progress on resolving outstanding [LOC U.S.  ] citizen property claims ( [ORG REF L  ] ) . 
Here again the trend is worrisome . 
As of May 1 , 2008 , the [ORG Ortega Administration  ] had resolved just 12 Embassy-registered claims for the 2007-2008 waiver year ; significantly fewer than the 86 resolved during the last full year of the [ORG Bolanos Administration  ] . 
We have continued to press for the resolution of the remaining 657 [LOC U.S.  ] citizen claims , which include some of the most difficult and complex . 
Our efforts have been frustrated by the decided lack of cooperation on the part of the government . 
The Property Superintendent limits her agency 's contact with Embassy staff to just one meeting per month and no longer allows Embassy staff to accompany [LOC U.S.  ] claimants to individual meetings with the government . 
The Attorney General requires that all communications on property be directed to him via Ambassadorial letter . 
In the meantime , the Attorney General has administratively dismissed 54 [LOC U.S.  ] citizen claims ; then categorized them as having been " resolved . 
" He recently passed to us a list of an additional 88 claims that he dismissed because the claimants were somehow connected to the [LOC Somoza  ] regime . 
If the situation [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000573 003 OF 008 fails to improve , we may need to consider implementation of [MISC Section 527  ] sanctions . 
While implementing [MISC Section 527  ] sanctions would conflict with the January 2007 Deputies Committee-approved strategy of " positive engagement " with the [ORG Ortega Administration  ] , we fear that taking no action would undercut the credibility of [MISC Section 527  ] as a tool to pressure action on outstanding claims . 
For this reason , we suggest as third way , such as a letter from the Secretary putting the government on notice . 
( C ) Security Forces: Still Independent , for the time being - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The security forces continue to be a bright spot . 
The [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [ORG Army  ] and the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [ORG National Police  ] ( [ORG NNP  ] ) remain two of the few independent , apolitical forces in [LOC Nicaragua  ] despite the [ORG Ortega Administration  ] 's clear goal of reverting both the [ORG NNP  ] and the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [ORG Army  ] back into completely subsidiary organs of the [ORG Sandinista Front  ] , as they once were during the days of the [ORG Sandinista Revolution  ] ( [ORG REF  ] G ) . 
The continued institutional independence and professionalism of the [ORG NNP  ] and the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [ORG Army  ] has been one of the few positive indicators remaining under [PER Ortega  ] 's increasingly authoritarian regime and has been the foundation of our strongest remaining areas of cooperation with the current administration . 
However , [PER Ortega  ] 's continued attacks against the [ORG NNP  ] , in general , and against popular [ORG NNP  ] Chief [PER Aminta Granera  ] , in particular , have taken their toll . 
Most notably , since [PER Ortega  ] 's dismissal of several high-level [ORG NNP  ] officials in March 2008 ( REF F ) , [PER Granera  ] has shied away from the public spotlight and avoided even the appearance of acting against [PER Ortega  ] 's interests . 
The [ORG NNP  ] 's failure to intervene in the violent protests that recently erupted in the [LOC RAAN  ] have cost both the organization , and [PER Granera  ] herself , credibility in the eyes of the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] public and is a clear indication of [PER Ortega  ] 's success in his drive to reassert personal control over the organization ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
A recent spike in crime rates has further damaged the [ORG NNP  ] 's image , especially a worrisome increase in brazen , foreigner-targeted crimes . 
[PER Granera  ] 's long term prospects as police chief are uncertain at best . 
If the [ORG FSLN  ] does well in November 's municipal elections , most observers of the [ORG NNP  ] believe that [PER Granera  ] will retire and make way for her current second in command , [PER Carlos Palacios  ] . 
[PER Palacios  ] is an [PER Ortega  ] loyalist who has alleged , albeit unproven , ties to organized crime and corruption in [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
Despite this , we believe that he will still be a cooperative , if difficult , partner to work with on future law enforcement assistance efforts. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) One of [PER Ortega  ] 's first efforts in 2007 was an attempt to bring the military under his direct control . 
After the [ORG National Assembly  ] forced him to abandon two separate candidates for [LOC Defense Minister  ] , he chose to leave the top two seats at [LOC Defense  ] vacant and bestow the " rank of minister " on a weak , but personally loyal Secretary General with no relevant experience . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] has since been purged of all professional-level technocrats , with all key positions now staffed by [ORG FSLN  ] ideologues . 
The marginalization of the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] has allowed the uniformed military to largely retain its professional and apolitical stance , but has left no civilian buffer between [PER Ortega  ] and Chief of [ORG Defense General  ] [PER Omar Halleslevens  ] . 
Thus far , the popularity and sheer personality of [PER Halleslevens  ] , as well as the personal relationship between the General and the President , have prevented [PER Ortega  ] from asserting direct control . 
However , beginning last July , [PER Ortega  ] has used his speeches at all military events and venues as a platform to attack the [LOC U.S.  ] and our " interventionist policies . 
" On [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000573 004 OF 008 multiple occasions [PER Ortega  ] has singled out [LOC U.S.  ] military personnel in attendance to receive his verbal lashings . 
[PER Halleslevens  ] has been careful to avoid public disputes with [PER Ortega  ] , but has also repeatedly and firmly asserted the military 's apolitical stance and its obligation to defend the Constitution , not a particular political party . 
We have not observed the political interference in military promotions and assignments that we have witnessed with the [ORG National Police  ] . 
In fact , most military observers believe that [PER Halleslevens  ] will complete his full term through 2010 , though they predict [PER Ortega  ] will move to install a more malleable figure to replace him . 
This appears to be borne out by recent sensitive reporting . 
( S ) [PER Ortega  ] Foreign [PER Policy: Petulant Teen  ] or Axis of Evil Wannabe ? - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) As expected , [PER Ortega  ] 's foreign policy shifted substantially to the left after January 2007 ( REF L ) . 
Despite [PER Ortega  ] 's early and reassuring move to name moderate [ORG Sandinista Samuel Santos  ] as foreign minister , over the last fifteen months [PER Ortega  ] 's infatuation with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , and the promotion of the ardent [MISC U.S.-hater  ] [PER Miguel d'Escoto  ] for [ORG UNGA  ] president ( REF B ) , would indicate that [PER Ortega  ] 's guiding principle in foreign relations seems to be , " Will this annoy the [LOC U.S.  ] ? 
" Over time , [ORG Santos  ] and the ministry have played an increasingly ceremonial role . 
Routine tasks normally be handled at the working-level require Ambassadorial advocacy and , despite [ORG Santos  ] 's assurances to the contrary , almost never seem to gain traction . 
Recently , we were advised that [PER Ortega  ] sought a meeting with Embassy [ORG TDY  ] visitors . 
We found the [ORG Ministry had  ] no knowledge of the meeting nor the means to obtain any details . 
We were only able to confirm the details after sending an email directly to First Lady [PER Rosario Murillo  ] . 
We agree with our diplomatic circuit colleagues that the [ORG Ministry has  ] virtually ceased to function. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG Chavez  ] " Mini-Me " : With respect to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Ortega  ] is a willing follower of [ORG Chavez  ] who has replaced [PER Castro  ] as [PER Ortega  ] 's mentor . 
Initially the relationship seemed largely a mutual admiration society with [ORG Chavez  ] slow to send assistance ; however , the [ORG ALBA  ] alliance has finally begun to produce monetary benefit for [PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] . 
We have first-hand reports that GON officials receive suitcases full of cash from [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials during official trips to [LOC Caracas  ] . 
We also believe that [PER Ortega  ] 's retreat last year from his demand that the [ORG Citizens Power Councils  ] ( [ORG CPCs  ] ) be publicly funded was due in part to the fact that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] cash pipeline had come on-line . 
Multiple contacts have told us that [PER Ortega  ] uses [MISC Venezuelan  ] oil cash to fund the [ORG CPCs  ] and [ORG FSLN  ] municipal election campaigns . 
Several unconfirmed reports indicate that [PER Ortega  ] will have as much as 500 million dollars at his disposal over the course of 2008. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S/NF ) Unrequited Love for [MISC Iran: Regarding  ] [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Ortega  ] had earnestly hoped to improve relations with [LOC Iran  ] , which he views as [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's revolutionary soul mate , both having toppled authoritarian regimes in the same year , 1979 . 
But [PER Ortega  ] 's early flurry of activity that re-established formal relations and saw reciprocal state visits appears to be a case of unrequited love . 
[LOC Iran  ] has sent multiple " private investment delegations " ( REF E ) , but to date , [LOC Tehran  ] has signed no investment deals nor responded to [PER Ortega  ] 's request to forgive [MISC Nicaraguan  ] sovereign debt held by [LOC Iran  ] . 
In fact , [LOC Taiwan  ] has been more forthcoming with direct assistance than [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000573 005 OF 008 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/NF ) " What the [ORG FARC  ] ? 
" Perhaps the most disturbing recent development in [PER Ortega  ] 's foreign policy relates to his increasingly public support for the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] and the [ORG FSLN  ] have a long-standing , clandestine relationship with [PER Manuel Mirulanda  ] and the [ORG FARC  ] , but which publicly had seemed dormant until five months ago when [PER Ortega  ] initiated saber-rattling against [LOC Colombia  ] over the [MISC San Andres  ] archipelago during an [ORG ALBA  ] meeting in [LOC Caracas  ] . 
Tensions reached a peak in March when [PER Ortega  ] , at the behest of [ORG Chavez  ] , broke diplomatic relations with [LOC Colombia  ] , following its strike into [LOC Ecuador  ] against [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Raul Reyes  ] , only to restore them a day later after a tempestuous [ORG Rio Group  ] meeting . 
Since that point , [PER Ortega  ] has come perilously close to declaring open support for the [ORG FARC  ] . 
In late April , [PER Ortega  ] appeared at the airport to greet [PER Lucia Morett  ] , a [MISC Mexican  ] student and alleged [ORG FARC  ] supporter who survived the March attack . 
Media reports persist that [PER Ortega  ] offered asylum and citizenship to [PER Morett  ] . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's reply to our direct questions on the topic was " nothing was requested , nothing was offered , " insisting that media usage of the terms " asylum " and " refugee " are incorrect . 
Sensitive reporting indicates that recently the Government of [LOC Ecuador  ] rebuffed [PER Ortega  ] 's request , through intermediaries , that [PER Quito  ] send two additional [MISC Colombian  ] survivors to [LOC Managua  ] . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Opposition and [ORG Municipal Elections: Quixotic Errand  ] ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The most important event on [LOC Nicaragua  ] 's political horizon is the November municipal election . 
Given [PER Ortega  ] 's unpopularity , the current economic decline , and several political factors , one would expect [PER Ortega  ] opponents to hold excellent odds at the ballot box . 
Even so , opposition parties have fumbled about without setting a clear direction . 
Confusion reigns in the [MISC Liberal  ] camp . 
The [ORG Supreme Electoral Council  ] ( [ORG CSE  ] ) decision in February to remove [PER Eduardo Montealegre  ] as leader of the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] [ORG Liberal Alliance  ] ( [ORG ALN  ] ) party -- forcing him to re-activate his [ORG Vamos Con Eduardo  ] ( [ORG VCE  ] ) political movement -- followed quickly by [PER Eduardo  ] 's decision to run for mayor under a [MISC PLC-VCE  ] alliance banner , left many in the [MISC Liberal  ] rank-and-file feeling angry , betrayed and confused . 
Polling shows that many Liberals still believe a vote for the [ORG ALN  ] is a vote for [PER Eduardo  ] . 
The shortened electoral calendar forced parties to set up party machinery and identify candidates more rapidly than in past years . 
As a result , candidate selection was rushed , with many choices made based more on personal connections than on electoral viability . 
The presence of " the [MISC Pacto  ] , " the de-facto power-sharing alliance between [PER Ortega  ] and former President [PER Aleman  ] , was felt as well , perhaps most strongly in [LOC Matagalpa  ] . 
In February nine opposition parties , including the [ORG ALN  ] , [ORG MRS  ] and a [ORG PLC  ] that had rejected [PER Aleman  ] , banded together to select consensus candidates . 
A unity slate was announced , but only days later cast aside when [PER Aleman  ] insisted on picking the mayoral candidate for [LOC Matagalpa  ] under the new [MISC PLC-VCE  ] alliance . 
The nine-party unity evaporated with each party now putting forward its own individual slate. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC Liberal  ] unity of the [MISC PLC-VCE  ] alliance is tenuous . 
We see parallel , rather than complementary structures for policy formulation , strategy , voter outreach , fundraising , etc . 
Guidance and funding from [MISC National-level  ] leadership is almost non-existent , with many candidates unclear how to proceed . 
We often come away bemused from meetings with rural mayoral candidates who appear oblivious of the need to develop platforms and campaigns . 
Many such candidates , several of whom could be described as [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000573 006 OF 008 " charisma-challenged , " seem to believe that simply being non-FSLN will be enough to get them elected . 
The perennial problem of funding persists . 
Several times a week we are approached by local candidates for campaign financing , voter registration support and the like . 
Even with the environmental advantages enjoyed by opposition candidates and parties , training and clear direction by opposition parties will be essential to seriously challenge [PER Ortega  ] 's well-organized , highly-disciplined , and apparently Venezuelan-financed FSLN/CPC election machine . 
What About the [LOC Atlantic Coast  ] ? - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) On April 4 the [ORG Supreme Electoral Council  ] ( [ORG CSE  ] ) voted to delay elections in three communities on the [LOC Atlantic Coast  ] for six months . 
The [ORG CSE  ] , whose magistrates owe their loyalty to President [PER Daniel Ortega  ] and [PER Aleman  ] , ignored widespread support from hurricane-affected communities in the [LOC RAAN  ] to proceed with elections as scheduled . 
In the weeks leading up to ) and since ) the [ORG CSE  ] decision , tensions between pro- and anti-election supporters have run high , causing violence and bloodshed on at least one occasion . 
[MISC Liberal  ] leaders in surrounding municipalities are convinced the government will use the delay to manipulate voter registries by moving pro-FSLN voters from the affected coastal municipalities to [MISC Liberal-dominated  ] interior municipalities thus tipping the vote towards [ORG FSLN  ] candidates. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) On April 24 , the [ORG National Assembly  ] -- on its second try -- issued a non-binding resolution overturning the [ORG CSE  ] 's decision . 
On April 25 , the [ORG Assembly  ] 's [ORG Justice Commission  ] voted out two decrees , one formalizing the [ORG Assembly  ] 's decision of the day before , and the second calling for an authentic interpretation of electoral law to prevent the [ORG CSE  ] from exercising such authority in the future . 
Both decrees will face serious challenges as the [ORG FSLN  ] will use its control of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and [ORG CSE  ] to nullify these measures . 
As the legal struggle plays out in the legislative , judicial , and electoral branches of government , pro- and anti-vote supporters in the [LOC RAAN  ] are preparing for a possible struggle of their own , including the use of violence , even armed tactics . 
Un-unified [ORG Civil Society Concerned By Diminishing Democratic Space  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Across the political spectrum [MISC Nicaraguan  ] civil society actors are concerned about the anti-democratic tendencies of the [ORG Ortega Administration  ] and see an increasingly hostile environment for organizations seeking to operate freely and independently . 
Since [PER Ortega  ] assumed office in January 2007 , many [ORG NGOs  ] , particularly those openly critical of the government , have experienced various forms of harassment , interference , intimidation , financial pressure , and threats both from the government and [ORG FSLN  ] loyalists . 
Although some actions appear to be innocuous on their surface , e.g. unannounced audits by tax authorities and related financial penalties , the overall cumulative effect appears to be part of a slow , deliberate effort by the government to discourage and undermine the independence , credibility , and operations of these groups and their advocacy of citizen rights and freedom . 
[ORG NGOs  ] , including the traditionally left-leaning Office of the [ORG Civil Coordinator  ] , often have been targeted based on an arbitrary application of the law or trumped up charges . 
Others , such as the [ORG center-right Permanent Commission  ] for [ORG Human Rights ( CPDH  ] ) , [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000573 007 OF 008 have received death threats against members of their staffs and families . 
Most civil society groups regard the establishment of the [ORG Citizen Power Councils  ] ( [ORG CPCs  ] ) under the central control of the [ORG FSLN  ] 's executive branch as a direct attempt to sideline and ultimately supplant the work of civil society. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) These organizations , which represent diverse elements of [MISC Nicaraguan  ] society , share a common conviction that civil society is the only viable sector that can keep [LOC Nicaragua  ] on a democratic path and stop [PER Ortega  ] 's authoritarian aspirations . 
Unfortunately , they lack clear direction on how to reach their destination and have missed many opportunities to really make their mark . 
Although they mounted a successful protest against the [ORG CPCs  ] in September , they were unable to produce a ripple effect that inspired a wider pro-democratic movement . 
Initially galvanized to come together to oppose the government 's encroachment on citizen rights and freedoms , civil society has not yet demonstrated a capacity or commitment to building any sort of unified alliance or response to the challenges facing the country . 
Some organizations , led by the [MISC Movimiento  ] por [LOC Nicaragua  ] ( MpN ) , have pledged to unite as a coalition , but to little avail . 
Most [ORG NGOs  ] suffer from a shortage of resources and lack of a long-term vision to work proactively on concrete , sustainable projects . 
Internal divisions , egos , leadership rivalries , and competition for donor resources and international cooperation also present impediments to building a long-term civic alliance . 
Despite the weaknesses of [MISC Nicaraguan  ] civil society organizations , however , they remain one of the strongest forces working in defense of the country 's democratic spaces . 
Support from the international community will be crucial if they are to make an impact , given the pressures they face . 
On our part , we have begun a USD 1 million small grants program for our democratic civil society friends . 
Shut [PER Them Up: Independent Media  ] Being Squeezed Too - - - - - - - <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( SBU ) In the first few months of 2008 , there has been a marked decline in press freedom in [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
Recent threats to press include the politicized use of the judicial system to convict a prominent local newspaper owner and editor of libel , and the mounting of a dubious public radio and TV campaign against the same media owner and an opposition leader , [PER Montealegre  ] , for alleged public theft . 
Journalists continue to report that only " official [MISC Sandinista  ] " media outlets , often those owned and operated by children of the President and First Lady , have access to government information . 
The [ORG Ministry of Health  ] has selectively banned a reporter from its premises for reporting that was not in its favor . 
In a space of two weeks in April , four national radio stations ( 3 independent and 1 [MISC Sandinista  ] ) reported serious equipment theft at their transmission towers which knocked them off the air for 8-12 hours each . 
To date , there are no convictions for any of these crimes . 
A few months ago , private , apparently partisan security forces surrounding the president handcuffed a local reporter when he tried to approach the Ambassador to tape public comments at an outdoor event . 
Comment - - - - <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S/NF ) Our bilateral interests and commitment to the [MISC Nicaraguan  ] people remain unchanged . 
Our goals are to keep [LOC Nicaragua  ] on the democratic path ; to combat corruption , [ORG MANAGUA  ] 00000573 008 OF 008 terrorism and all forms of trafficking ; to promote private sector-led development and to protect the interests of [LOC U.S.  ] citizens residing in [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
Though our interests remain unchanged , [PER Ortega  ] has made it increasingly difficult for us to work towards these goals , by restricting our access and pressuring our partners . 
He has scrupulously avoided either an outright rejection of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance or a direct policy confrontation with [LOC Washington  ] . 
However , he has worked assiduously to undermine any domestic opposition , and thus our ability to find partners capable of imposing pressure for meaningful change . 
The [MISC Ortega-Aleman  ] political pact remains active , and the single greatest , though not the only , obstacle to a more open , transparent [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] has mis-managed the economy and has repeatedly permitted , if not instigated , government intervention in the energy and finance sectors for clearly political ends . 
[PER Ortega  ] continues to close the space in which independent voices of civil society and media can educate and defend the rights of [MISC Nicaraguans  ] . 
Though he has not publicly abandoned his post-election commitments to keep the country on a democratic path and maintain responsible free market policies , there are multiple signs that [PER Ortega  ] seeks only one goal ) consolidation of power to perpetuate his rule .
