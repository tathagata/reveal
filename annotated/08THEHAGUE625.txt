REF: A. THE HAGUE 587 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC BRUSSELS  ] 1098 Classified By: [MISC Political-Economic  ] Counselor [PER Andrew Mann  ] , Reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) SUMMARY: [PER Wepke Kingma  ] , MFA Director of the [ORG Sub-Sahara Africa Department  ] recently discussed the [MISC Dutch  ] position on [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , and the [ORG Horn of Africa  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC Sudan  ] ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Regarding the recent [ORG ICC  ] indictment of [MISC Sudanese  ] President [PER Omar al-Bashir  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] have expressed public support for the [ORG ICC  ] , but [PER Kingma  ] believes the timing for the indictment is poor . 
Though [PER Kingma  ] made it clear the [MISC Dutch  ] would not publicly state this , he believes that pursuing the indictment for Bashir will prove costly to any negotiations and likely backfire . 
Plans for a [MISC Dutch  ] contribution to [ORG UNAMID  ] will be " " pushed back " " because a group of [MISC Dutch  ] legislators returned from the region " " foaming at the mouth " " with concerns about the security situation . 
[LOC Zimbabwe  ] -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] government continues to be an engaged and concerned observer of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , though [PER Kingma  ] admits that much of the public ignores the issue . 
[PER Kingma  ] noted that it was possible [PER Mugabe  ] would attempt to buy the support of rival political parties in an attempt to create a coalition government that will be acceptable to the [LOC West  ] but which [PER Mugabe  ] would still control . 
Although , in [PER Kingma  ] , s view , the rest of the world may be underestimating the [MISC South Africans  ] in the [LOC Zimbabwe  ] negotiations , he feels [PER Mugabe  ] is probably just " " buying time " " with the negotiations process . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] continue to look at what sanctions will truly hurt the [PER Mugabe  ] regime. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a July 17 discussion between Poloffs and [PER Melle Leemstra  ] , MFA desk officer for [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , and [PER Wouter Plomp  ] , head of the middle and southern [LOC Africa  ] division , the [MISC Dutch  ] reported the [ORG EU  ] , s sanction plan ( reftel B ) . 
The [LOC United Kingdom  ] will push for further measures , including an investment ban , to be enacted in September . 
However , the remaining foreign investments in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] are [MISC British  ] and [MISC American  ] , and pursuing an investment ban is difficult . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] wonder , " " Is the [LOC U.S.  ] working with non-EUR states on sanctions , or contemplating action by the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] ? 
" " The [MISC Dutch  ] urge creativity in pursuing additional measures . 
For example , governments could use " " moral suasion " " rather than an investment ban , with press statements such as " " it , s inconceivable to do business in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
" " [ORG Tesco  ] , [LOC UK  ] has stopped buying from [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , and [ORG Shell  ] is also considering a sale of assets in [LOC Zimbabwe.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Plomp  ] wondered if the negative votes from [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC China  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] on the [ORG UN  ] sanctions were a surprise to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] noted the need for [LOC South Africa  ] to find a " " graceful way out " " for [PER Mugabe  ] , so perhaps it would be better to ease the pressure on [LOC South Africa  ] . 
Minister for [ORG Development Cooperation  ] [PER Bert Koenders  ] noted ( in a conversation with [PER A/S Frazier  ] ) that there should be some cooperation between the negotiations in [LOC South Africa  ] and the brandishing of international sanctions . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] concede that it will be difficult to coordinate the bureaucratic and political sides on a timeline. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Plomp  ] took note of the need to consider the eventual reconstruction of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , with recent [ORG South African Development Community  ] estimates running around two to three billion dollars . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] maintain that it will be key for " " northern " " countries to coordinate . 
[ORG Horn of Africa  ] -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Somali  ] PM [PER Nur Hassan Hussein  ] visited the [LOC Netherlands  ] July 10 . 
According to [PER Kingma  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] told him they were ready to give aid to [LOC Somalia  ] , especially for local police forces . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is actively working towards a solution with neighboring countries to address the lawlessness . 
The latest report by the [ORG International Crisis Group  ] was a disappointment as it just " " pulls out the latest toolbox " " with proposals such as naming a special envoy , but does not address the " " underlying issues . 
" " <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Though an outspoken critic of the regime , the [MISC Dutch  ] have been directly speaking with [LOC Ethiopia  ] this year since it is willing to engage on critical issues such as [LOC Ogaden  ] and [LOC Somalia  ] . 
[LOC Eritrea  ] , however , will not discuss [LOC Somalia  ] with the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
[LOC Norway  ] , s FM Store told [MISC Dutch  ] FM [MISC Verhagen  ] that the border conflict between [LOC Eritrea  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] was a key to resolving the [LOC Somalia  ] problem . 
[PER Kingma  ] thinks that is " " bullshit , " " but the FM asked for a paper on the issue.\ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Kingma  ] , s frank talk did not provide any surprises but reflected his four years , experience leading [MISC Dutch  ] [LOC Africa  ] policy . 
It was also emblematic of the [MISC Dutch  ] penchant for blunt remarks to allies . 
For example , [PER Kingma  ] suggested the way to deal with Lord , s [ORG Resistance Army  ] leader [PER Joseph Kony  ] would be for the [LOC United States  ] to " " put a price on " " his head and encourage local figures in the [LOC Congo  ] to " " take care " " of him .
