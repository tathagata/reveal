( C ) SUMMARY: While skirmishes and security incidents may be rare from day to day , an impending frozen conflict in [ORG Northern Kosovo  ] remains the greatest threat to a safe and secure environment ( [ORG SASE  ] ) in [LOC Kosovo  ] in the near and medium terms . 
Fortunately , a constellation of factors exists that could reverse ten years of rot in [ORG Northern Kosovo  ] and avoid letting this region become a frozen conflict . 
An impressive level of international consensus exists to address [ORG Northern Kosovo  ] issues , and international actors and the [ORG GOK  ] have agreed on a [ORG Northern Strategy  ] to do just that . 
KFOR , at its current robust “Gate 1” force posture of 10,000 , can play an important role , deterring extremists both north and south , as this strategy is implemented . 
As decisions are made on progress to “Gate 2” ( 5,000 troops ) and beyond , the best way to operationalize the NAC’s central condition for successful drawdown -- maintenance of a safe and secure environment , with a threat level assessed as low -- will be success in this [ORG Northern Strategy  ] . 
Benchmarks for this success include replacement of illegal parallel structures with legitimate [LOC Kosovo  ] bodies , the establishment of robust rule of law institutions , the re-establishment of customs controls and revenue collection , and the re-establishment of legal , normalized electrical services and billing under KEK control . 
END SUMMARY NORTHERN [MISC KOSOVO  ] REMAINS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO [ORG SASE  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We have argued ( ref A ) that to achieve the conditions-based drawdown of KFOR troops agreed by the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( ref B ) , it is crucial both to build local security capacity and address existing security threats now , while [MISC KFOR’s  ] force posture remains robust . 
[ORG Northern Kosovo  ] -- home base for illegal [MISC Serbian  ] parallel structures and a region rife with smuggling and organized crime -- remains perhaps the greatest threat facing [LOC Kosovo  ] in the short and medium terms . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] institutions have exercised little control there since 1999 , and practically none since riots after [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence in 2008 . 
The result has been a zone where customs collection is essentially on an “honor system , ” courts don’t function , international police all but fear to tread , and the only municipal governments are those elected by the [LOC Republic of Serbia  ] in polls held in direct contravention of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1244 . 
Lack of activity or even access by [LOC Kosovo  ] authorities in [ORG Northern Kosovo  ] is a constant irritant for [MISC Kosovo’s  ] leaders and the country’s majority [MISC Albanian  ] population , and it represents for both the very real threat of the partition of [LOC Kosovo  ] -- a reversal of ten years of USG policy and a grave threat to stability in [LOC Kosovo  ] and the [LOC Western Balkan  ] region . 
A series of recent statements by Belgrade’s leadership has established that the ultimate partition of [LOC Kosovo  ] is , at a minimum , one of the policy options [LOC Belgrade  ] has in view ( ref C ) . 
NORTHERN STRATEGY AN OPPORTUNITY -------------------------------- [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000044 002 OF 004 <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) For much of the past ten years , pursuit of our strategic goal of a stable , democratic , multi- ethnic [LOC Kosovo  ] has taken a back seat in the [LOC North  ] to tactical concerns of avoiding demonstrations and clashes . 
Fortunately , there is a growing consensus in the international community that the time is now to reverse this trend . 
Embassies of the major [MISC European  ] powers , the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [ORG International Civilian Office  ] and the [ORG European Union Rule  ] of [ORG Law Mission EULEX  ] have agreed on a [ORG Northern Strategy  ] to displace the illegal parallel structures , introduce legitimate , legal [ORG GOK  ] structures , and increase the presence and improve the performance of rule of law institutions ( customs , police and courts ) in [LOC Northern Kosovo  ] . 
The [ORG GOK  ] has accepted this strategy as its own , and has pledged budget resources toward its implementation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) That this international and local alliance for action in [ORG Northern Kosovo  ] comes while KFOR remains at a robust presence of roughly 10,000 troops is fortunate . 
The [ORG Northern Strategy  ] ( septel ) has been designed to incentivize participation in [ORG GOK  ] structures , not to impose them by force . 
That said , local forces , including [MISC Serbs  ] and [MISC Albanians  ] who benefit from the current near lawless environment , could attempt to use violence to disrupt attempts to collect customs duties or reopen courts . 
KFOR at 10,000 will play an important , if ancillary , role in this strategy to ensure [MISC Kosovo’s  ] long-term stability and territorial integrity . 
At 10,000 , [ORG KFOR  ] remains capable to respond to multiple , simultaneous incidents . 
[MISC KFOR’s  ] ability to respond with overwhelming force to multiple provocations will itself serve as a valuable deterrent . 
As recently as January 26 , [MISC Serbian  ] State Secretary for the [ORG Ministry of Kosovo  ] and [ORG Metohija Oliver  ] Ivanovic raised the specter of violence , arguing it is the inevitable outcome of the [ORG Northern Strategy  ] . 
Whether meant as a warning , or simply to rattle the less committed elements of the [ORG International Community  ] , [ORG Ivanovic’s  ] statement was a useful reminder that some [MISC Serb  ] elements consider such threats and tactics as legitimate . 
A strong KFOR is the best deterrent to extremists on either side of the [LOC River Ibar  ] . 
ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE NORTH ARE PRACTICAL [ORG SASE  ] BENCHMARKS --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While a robust KFOR is important to the success of the [ORG Northern Strategy  ] , the implementation of the strategy is an opportunity for KFOR , a roadmap to a successful drawdown to deterrent presence . 
In our view , the central condition established by the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] for [MISC KFOR’s  ] eventual drawdown to deterrent presence is “maintenance of a safe and secure environment ( [ORG SASE  ] ) , with a threat level assessed as low.” In the past , we have been all too quick to assess the durability of [MISC Kosovo’s  ] threat level based on the presence or absence of security incidents on a daily basis . 
Depending on a definition of [ORG SASE  ] as the absence of security incidents risks masking a disturbing reality -- [ORG Northern Kosovo  ] can be , at the same time , both free of security incidents and a frozen conflict in the making , at risk of partition . 
A [LOC Northern Kosovo  ] like this , as it is today , is a far cry from stability , and is in fact an engine for future instability in [LOC Kosovo  ] and the wider [LOC Western Balkan  ] region . 
[ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000044 003 OF 004 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As the [ORG NAC  ] debates the move to “Gate 2” ( 5,000 troops ) and beyond , we would argue that the time is ripe to move from a negative operationalization of security , based on the absence of incidents , to a positive one . 
Such an operationalization would establish realistic , observable measures of success in reversing a decade of erosion in [LOC Northern Kosovo  ] and establishing [MISC Kosovo’s  ] authority throughout its territory . 
Such benchmarks should include: -- successful establishment of the decentralized municipality of [LOC North Mitrovica  ] ; -- re-establishment of collection of customs revenue at [ORG Gates  ] 1 and 31 , as part of a single , [MISC Kosovo-wide  ] customs regime ; -- the staffing of the [ORG Mitrovica District Court  ] with ethnic [MISC Serb  ] and [MISC Albanian  ] judges recognized by the [LOC Kosovo  ] justice system ; -- enhanced [ORG EULEX  ] police presence in [LOC Northern Kosovo  ] , and the full integration of [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serb  ] members of the [LOC Kosovo  ] Police ( KP ) in [LOC Kosovo  ] Police structures ; -- the replacement of illegal parallel municipal authorities in [LOC Northern Kosovo  ] with , legal , legitimately constituted [LOC Kosovo  ] bodies ; -- the arrest and prosecution of major organized crime figures ; and , -- the normalization of electric power distribution and billing throughout [LOC Northern Kosovo  ] by [LOC KEK  ] , according to [ORG UNMIK  ] law and regulation . 
STATUS NEUTRAL , NOT VALUE NEUTRAL --------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Some may protest that the establishment of such benchmarks represents a break with [MISC KFOR’s  ] status neutral stance . 
This is patently untrue . 
In no case do the benchmarks listed above violate [ORG UNSCR  ] 1244 , the source of [MISC KFOR’s  ] mandate , and in most cases -- like electricity and local self- government -- success in these benchmarks would represent a re-establishment of the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1244 regime , respect of [ORG UNMIK  ] laws and [ORG UNMIK  ] regulations . 
In the end , this is true status neutrality . 
What some would request , only taking positions and actions which are equally acceptable to [LOC Belgrade  ] and [LOC Pristina  ] , isn’t status neutrality , but rather value neutrality . 
This is neither in [MISC KFOR’s  ] interest nor in [MISC Kosovo’s  ] , and was never USG policy in the region . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) For ten years , stability in [LOC Northern Kosovo  ] has been defined as merely the lack of conflict . 
Today’s KFOR , at “Gate 1” levels of 10,000 troops , presents our best opportunity to define stability properly , as success in addressing [MISC Kosovo’s  ] most vexing security threat: [ORG Northern Kosovo  ] as an emerging frozen conflict . 
Success in the [ORG Northern Strategy  ] -- including reintroducing [LOC Kosovo  ] structures to this region , and eliminating illegal [MISC Serbian  ] parallel structures -- represents our best chance for a peaceful , stable [LOC Kosovo  ] governing within the [ORG PRISTINA  ] 00000044 004 OF 004 full extent of its recognized borders , and [MISC KFOR’s  ] surest roadmap to a successful reduction in troop strength to “Gate 2” and beyond .
