REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: As emotions run high following a week of adversarial debates between [MISC Iran’s  ] four presidential candidates , the outcome of the national soccer team’s [MISC World Cup  ] qualifying match against the [ORG UAE  ] could add to voters’ dissatisfaction with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] just 36 hours before they head to the polls . 
President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has worked hard to associate himself with [MISC Iran’s  ] beloved national team - “Team Melli” - a tactic that backfired in March when he was accused of “jinxing” the team , which suffered a last-minute defeat to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] just after [PER Ahmadinejad  ] entered the stadium . 
That event , coupled with an unexpected loss by the national wrestling team with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] in attendance earlier in the year , set off a firestorm of SMS messages and internet jokes holding the President personally responsible for the teams’ defeats , and has led numerous [ORG IRPO  ] contacts to predict - only partially in jest - that a loss to the [ORG UAE  ] team in [LOC Tehran  ] on June 10 could further weaken [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] standing among soccer-crazed [MISC Iranians  ] . 
End summary . 
MIXING SPORTS AND POLITICS -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since [MISC British  ] oil workers first introduced the sport to [MISC Iranians  ] in the early 20th century , soccer has developed into one of [MISC Iran’s  ] most popular past times , rivaled only by wrestling . 
Although the [MISC Islamic  ] Revolution and [MISC Iran-Iraq War  ] hindered the development of professional soccer in [LOC Iran  ] until the early 1990’s , [ORG Team Melli  ] came into international prominence in 1998 when it made its [MISC World Cup  ] debut in [LOC France  ] . 
Although [LOC Iran  ] failed to advance beyond the first round , [ORG Team Melli’s  ] memorable 2-1 victory over the [LOC U.S.  ] , in what was considered to be a particularly friendly and sportsmanlike match , cemented the national team’s standing in the eyes of many [PER Iranians.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As a result of its enormous domestic fan base , soccer has become highly politicized in [LOC Iran  ] . 
According to an [ORG IRPO  ] contact closely involved with [MISC Iranian  ] professional soccer , the [MISC Iranian  ] government is well aware of the potential domestic unrest that can result from a [ORG Team Melli  ] loss - or even win . 
[MISC Iran’s  ] successful [MISC World Cup  ] qualifiers in 1997 and 2005 resulted in massive celebrations in the streets of [LOC Tehran  ] , marked by public intoxication , dancing , and women removing their hijabs , while [ORG Team Melli’s  ] elimination from the 2001 [MISC World Cup  ] qualifiers led to rioting . 
Contacts tell [ORG IRPO  ] that the [MISC Iranian  ] government worries that public unrest over a [ORG Team Melli  ] loss could add fire to the increasingly volatile political demonstrations that have paralyzed [LOC Tehran  ] in recent nights. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , in particular , has staked a great deal of political capital in [MISC Iranian  ] soccer . 
A personal fan and former player , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has made several press appearances practicing with [ORG Team Melli  ] . 
In an effort to capitalize on soccer’s popularity with constituents , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , a political conservative , went so far as to call for the inclusion of women at men’s games in 2006 , although he was overruled by Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] in a rare , but significant , open disagreement between the two men . 
As a direct result of [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] close ties to [MISC Iran’s  ] national soccer team , several [MISC European  ] politicians and [MISC Jewish  ] groups unsuccessfully lobbied for [MISC Iran’s  ] disqualification from the 2006 [MISC World Cup  ] . 
After the team’s poor performance in the [MISC World Cup  ] qualifiers , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] fired [ORG Team Melli’s  ] coach in June 2006 , reportedly for “damaging national pride , ” and launched an investigation into corruption in the [ORG Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran  ] ( [ORG FFIRI  ] ) . 
In November 2006 , the [ORG Fidiration Internationale de Football Association  ] ( [ORG FIFA  ] ) temporarily disqualified [ORG Team Melli  ] from international tournaments for [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] repeated violations of [MISC FIFA’s  ] political interference rules . 
THE GEORGE STEINBRENNER OF [LOC IRAN  ] ------------------------------- [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000235 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the 2006 [ORG FIFA  ] suspension , [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] personal involvement in [ORG Team Melli  ] has only grown in significance . 
In June 2008 , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , with the assistance of [PER Seyyed Hasan Khomeini  ] , [PER Ayatollah Khomeini’s  ] grandson , successfully pressured the [ORG FFIRI  ] to lift its suspension of star [PER Ali Karimi  ] in order for him to play in the 2010 [MISC World Cup  ] qualifiers . 
According to press reports , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] was personally involved in the firing of coach [PER Ali Daei  ] after [MISC Iran’s  ] loss to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in March 2009 . 
[ORG Team Melli’s  ] next coach , [PER Mohammad Mayeli-Kohan  ] , only lasted two weeks in the politically-charged environment . 
With [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] support , [ORG Team Melli  ] eventually settled on [MISC American  ] citizen and former 1998 [MISC World Cup  ] [LOC U.S.  ] team assistant coach [PER Afshin Ghotbi  ] , who was greeted with a hero’s welcome by [MISC Iranian  ] fans at Tehran’s [PER Imam Khomeini Airport  ] . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] personally loaned [ORG Team Melli  ] his presidential plane to travel to [LOC Pyongyang  ] for [MISC Ghotbi’s  ] debut match against [LOC North Korea  ] on June 6. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Because of the government’s strong influence - IRPO’s contact claims that [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence services have files on most prominent soccer figures - [ORG Team Melli’s  ] players , most of whom were born after the Revolution , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
However , the heightened intensity of this year’s campaign season has inspired a number of prominent soccer officials , including the managing board of [ORG Zob Ahan Football Club  ] and the former coach of [ORG Persepolis Football Club  ] , to endorse [ORG Mir-Hossein Mousavi  ] . 
Soccer fans , too , have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] administration . 
The same contact told [ORG IRPO  ] that the crowd turned on [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] deputies , Vice President for Executive Affairs [PER Ali Saeedlou  ] and Vice President for Physical Education [PER Mohammad Ali Abadi  ] , after [ORG Persepolis  ] , the most popular and successful of [MISC Iran’s  ] government-owned clubs , lost to [ORG Uzbekistan’s Bunyodkor Football Club  ] in last week’s [ORG AFC Champions League  ] match . 
[MISC Iranian  ] fans reportedly cheered “we don’t want political soccer” and began to pelt the two administration officials , before security arrived to escort them out of the stadium. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] support , [MISC Iran’s  ] chances of qualifying for the 2010 [MISC World Cup  ] are slim . 
Following last week’s disappointing 0-0 draw against [LOC North Korea  ] , [ORG Team Melli  ] will play the [LOC UAE  ] in [LOC Tehran  ] on June 10 , two days before the presidential election . 
Although the [LOC UAE  ] is widely recognized as the worst team in [MISC Iran’s  ] qualifying group , [ORG Team Melli  ] tied [LOC UAE  ] 1-1 when they last met in November 2008 . 
A loss to the [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Iran’s  ] political and economic rival across the [ORG Strait of Hormuz  ] , would be deeply embarrassing to [MISC Iranian  ] national pride and could very well damage [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] image in the mind of the [MISC Iranian  ] electorate . 
According to contacts , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] “cannot afford” a loss on the eve of the election in such a tight race . 
Some in [LOC Iran  ] doubt that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] will even make an appearance at the [LOC UAE  ] match after he was deemed a “jinx” by superstitious fans , who linked his arrival at [LOC Azadi Stadium  ] for [LOC Iran’s  ] last home match against [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] with the downturn in the game . 
However , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has given no indication that he plans to disassociate himself from [ORG Team Melli  ] on the verge of elimination. “Unfortunately , this sport has been afflicted with some very bad issues , ” he told [MISC Iranian  ] media on June 7. “I must intervene personally to push aside these destructive issues.” COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Through his decidedly public involvement with [ORG Team Melli  ] , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has inextricably linked himself to the outcome of [MISC Iran’s  ] bid to qualify for the 2010 [MISC World Cup  ] . 
The presidential election , which has become hotly contested over recent days as [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has cast aspersions on his rivals and drawn other powerful elites into the fray by making sweeping allegations of corruption , is increasingly turning into a referendum on [PER Ahmadinejad  ] himself . 
Though many serious issues will draw [MISC Iranians  ] to the polls on June 12 , one cannot overlook the effect that the result of the June 10 Iran-UAE match , especially an embarrassing loss , could have on [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] electoral fortunes . 
To many , the state of soccer in [LOC Iran  ] today [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000235 003.2 OF 003 reflects the problems that [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] challengers claim the country has suffered under his administration . 
Whereas [LOC Iran  ] achieved international prominence in the 1998 [MISC World Cup  ] under [MISC Khatami  ] , [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] politicization of the sport has compromised [ORG Team Melli’s  ] standing on the world stage , and in many [MISC Iranians’  ] eyes , further jeopardized the country’s national pride .
