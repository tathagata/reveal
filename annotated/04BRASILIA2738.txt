( C ) Based upon ongoing discussions between AmEmbassy [LOC Brasilia  ] [ORG DHS  ] Attache and officials at the [ORG GOB Civil Aviation Authority  ] ( [ORG DAC  ] ) , post requests that Department approach [ORG DHS  ] to suggest that the [LOC US  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] commence talks on the how [MISC Brazilian  ] carriers supply the [ORG USG  ] with Passenger Name Record Data for flights destined to the [LOC U.S.  ] While previously , citing legal restrictions , [PER Varig  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] 's principal overseas carrier ) had declined to supply the [ORG USG  ] with such data , consultations recently undertaken have indicated that there is now a greater willingness on the [MISC Brazilian  ] side to find a way to provide the needed information. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Whatever understanding is reached , it will likely need to be memorialized in a written agreement between [ORG DHS  ] and the [ORG DAC  ] . 
We think it advisable that Department formally contact [ORG DHS  ] 's Customs and [ORG Border Protection  ] officials asap to suggest that it initiate such talks . 
If necessary , post would welcome the travel of an interagency [ORG USG  ] team to [LOC Brazil  ] to discuss the issue with the [ORG DAC  ] . 
Embassy Point of Contact on this issue is Econ Counselor [PER Bruce Williamson.</pre></code>  ]
