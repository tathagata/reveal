REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) During a March 11 meeting with [PER Farhat Bengadara  ] , Governor of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] , the [ORG CDA  ] asked about press reports that [LOC Libya  ] had signed a number of financial and economic agreements with [LOC Iran  ] in December 2007 during the visit of [MISC Iranian  ] First Vice President [PER Davoudi  ] to [LOC Tripoli  ] ( reftel ) . 
[ORG CDA  ] noted in particular an [ORG MOU  ] that the [MISC Libyan  ] press had described as providing for " a framework for cooperation between the central banks of [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Iran  ] " and asked how it was being implemented . 
2 . 
( C ) Apparently sensing underlying concerns behind the [ORG CDA  ] 's question , [PER Bengadara  ] downplayed the significance of the [ORG MOU  ] . 
Characterizing the [ORG MOU  ] 's language as " very standard " , he stressed that the agreement lacked " substance or specifics " and did not mandate significant commitments from either party . 
[LOC Libya  ] was " very careful " in its nascent engagement with [LOC Iran  ] , and was not inclined to accelerate or deepen cooperation with [LOC Iran  ] on banking or investment beyond the limited [ORG MOU  ] 's and agreements signed during [PER Davoudi  ] 's visit . 
( [PER Note: Previous  ] reports suggested [LOC Iran  ] was pressuring the [ORG GOL  ] to sign more formal agreements and treaties on investment and trade immediately after [PER Davoudi  ] 's visit . 
End note . 
) The [LOC U.S  ] . 
" should not worry " about the the [ORG MOU  ] , which did not provide for or extend to activities that would cause concern . 
3 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Bengadara  ] was keen to emphasize that the December 2007 [ORG MOU  ] was more form than substance , a position at odds with what the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG DCM  ] here has reportedly conveyed to other [MISC Tripoli-based  ] diplomats . 
Given [LOC Libya  ] 's strained relations with [LOC Iran  ] over [LOC Lebanon  ] , its desire to improve relations with the [LOC United States  ] and [ORG EU  ] countries , we expect the [ORG GOL  ] to move cautiously in its responding to [MISC Iranian  ] overtures . 
End comment .
