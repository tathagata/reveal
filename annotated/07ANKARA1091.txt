[ORG ANKARA  ] 1006 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[ORG ANKARA  ] 1083 AND PREVIOUS Classified By: PolCouns [PER Janice G. Weiner  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) In contrast to rumors that [MISC Turkish  ] FM [PER Abdullah Gul  ] is depressed after having had to withdraw his presidential bid , a journalist xxxxx described his demeanor as relaxed , confident and determined. xxxxx it was clear that both [PER Gul  ] and [PER Hayrunissa  ] had long lobbied for him to be the ruling Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] 's ( [ORG AKP  ] ) presidential candidate – and they still retain ambitions. xxxxx dismissed earlier press speculation that parliamentary speaker [PER Bulent Arinc  ] had forced the issue . 
It was instead [PER Gul  ] who went to [PER Arinc  ] to press his own case and ask for support . 
He reportedly told [PER Arinc  ] that he , [PER Gul  ] , did not want to see a bureaucrat ( [PER DefMin Gonul  ] ) in [LOC Cankaya.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The way [PER Gul  ] 's candidacy ultimately played out was a reflection of the long-running partnership – and rivalry – between PM Recep [PER Tayyip Erdogan  ] and [PER Gul  ] , according to our contact . 
From the outset , the biggest hurdle was [PER Erdogan  ] who , until the last minute , proved unwilling to renounce his personal presidential ambitions . 
The PM waited so long that there was no time to cushion a [PER Gul  ] candidacy via the media , whose initial reactions to [PER Gul  ] 's candidacy had been positive . 
The PM squandered an opportunity better to prepare both the military and the public . 
At that point , the opposition [ORG People 's Republican Party  ] ( [ORG CHP  ] ) could have savored its “anyone but [MISC Erdogan”  ] victory and [PER Gul  ] , who enjoyed good relations both with [ORG CHP  ] and with the military , could have helped smooth the way . 
( Comment: It 's not clear that a [PER Gul  ] candidacy would ever have been acceptable to the military , though they certainly do not like surprises . 
End comment . 
) 3 . 
( C ) Once the [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff released its e-memo late on April 27 , it was allegedly [PER Gul  ] , not the PM , who persuaded [ORG AKP  ] to take the democratic high road and hard line reflected in [ORG GOT  ] spokesman [PER Cemil Cicek  ] 's April 28 statement ( ref A ) , which [PER Gul  ] reportedly penned . 
In the interview , [PER Gul  ] also reflected confidence in [ORG AKP  ] 's prospects for doing well in the upcoming general election . 
4 . 
( C ) One frequent TGS accusation has been that [ORG AKP  ] has a hidden agenda . 
[PER Gul  ] had rebutted it consistently , pointing to the raft of political and economic reforms the [ORG AKP  ] government has passed , and asking rhetorically if they would be working hard to harmonize [MISC Turkish  ] law with [ORG EU  ] law if [ORG GOT  ] 's agenda were sharia. xxxxx 5 . 
( C ) According to xxxxx [PER Gul  ] was not a member of [PER Milli Gorus  ] , the old [PER Necmettin Erbakan  ] cabal of pious , anti-Semitic Anatolians who have little subtlety . 
[PER Gul  ] 's initial political activity was with a serious student movement just prior to the 1980 coup ( to which [PER Erdogan  ] also belonged ) , the [PER Milli Turk  ] Talebe Birligi ( [ORG National Turkish Student Union  ] - [ORG MTTB  ] ) , a formerly leftist student group turned conservative/Islamist , then disbanded in 1980 as a result of the coup . 
After 1997 , it was [PER Gul  ] 's think-tank , [PER Politik Arastirma Merkezi  ] ( [ORG Political Research Center  ] - [ORG PAM  ] ) that planned [ORG AKP  ] 's split from [PER Erbakan  ] 's Fazilet and mapped out the strategy that brought [ORG AKP  ] to power in 2002 . 
[PER Gul  ] is , per the journalist , the only one in the party whom [PER Erdogan  ] truly respects , in the [MISC Turkish  ] sense of admiration , friendship and fear . 
6 . 
( C ) Comment: This picture of [PER Gul  ] is one person 's view ( who has known the [PER Gul  ] family for a long time ) , and stands in contrast to how others , including some in [ORG AKP  ] , have described [LOC Gul.  ] xxxxx for example , told us the FM was devastated and had never wanted to run . 
Whatever the truth about his mood , it is hard to believe that [PER Gul  ] , a seasoned [LOC Ankara  ] 00001091 002 of 002 politician and operator , would let himself be pushed into something he didn't want to do , even “for the greater good for his party.” End comment .
