Bradtke  ] for reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Croatian  ] Prime Minister [PER Ivo Sanader  ] called Ambassador on September 4 to express his concern over an article on the [MISC Croatian  ] on-line news site index.hr alleging that [PER Sanader  ] was colluding with Chairman of [ORG Pliva Pharmaceuticals  ] [PER Zeljko Covic  ] and former [PER FM  ] [PER Miomir Zuzul  ] to tip the sale of [ORG Pliva  ] in favor of [LOC US  ] pharmaceutical company [ORG Barr Labs  ] . 
The article also included a reference to an interview the Ambassador gave in July to a leading [LOC Zagreb  ] news magazine , in which he said that [ORG Barr’s  ] acquisition of [ORG Pliva  ] would be a positive signal of confidence in [LOC Croatia’s  ] investment climate . 
It went on to suggest that [PER Sanader  ] believes that [ORG Pliva  ] must go to a [LOC US  ] company in order to maintain good bilateral relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Sanader  ] was clearly upset by the allegations , which he said were the opening salvo in what he predicted would be a “very dirty” opposition campaign to discredit his government over the [ORG Pliva  ] sale . 
He told the Ambassador that he would rebut what he said were untrue allegations and asked if the [ORG Embassy  ] would also respond with a press statement , given that an [MISC American  ] company is involved and that the article mentioned the Ambassador . 
The Ambassador agreed to issue a statement ( text at para 4 ) reaffirming simply that the sale of [ORG Pliva  ] must be decided by market forces in a transparent way and in compliance with all laws and that the outcome will have no effect on [MISC U.S.-Croatian  ] relations. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Pliva Pharmaceuticals  ] , one of [LOC Croatia’s  ] largest and most successful companies ( in which the [ORG GOC  ] still retains an 18 percent share ) , is the object of competing takeover bids by [ORG US Barr Labs  ] and [ORG Icelandic Actavis  ] . 
[ORG Barr’s  ] initial 2.3 billion dollar offer for [ORG Pliva  ] was countered last week by a 2.5 billion dollar offer from [ORG Actavis  ] . 
[PER Barr  ] is now expected to counter this offer in a process that may not conclude until early October . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] has been in contact with [ORG Barr’s  ] representative in [LOC Zagreb  ] , who is thus far satisfied that the process , although clearly straining [LOC Croatia’s  ] small and untested regulatory capacity , is being carried out in a transparent way and in accordance with standards that are being upheld equally for both sides. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Although  ] we have no indication of impropriety thus far over the sale of [ORG Pliva  ] , a transaction of this magnitude is a first of its kind for [LOC Croatia  ] and clearly a challenge for its regulatory mechanisms . 
With the share price of [ORG Pliva  ] up nearly sixty percent since earlier in the year , it seems quite likely that the sale will provide the press with scandals both real and imagined for a long time to come , particularly with elections approaching in 2007. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Embassy  ] response to index.hr article: Regarding a September 3 article by Index.hr about the ongoing negotiations over acquisition of [ORG Pliva Pharmaceuticals  ] , the [ORG Embassy  ] has always urged that the process be open and transparent . 
We expect any [MISC American  ] company to operate fully under both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Croatian  ] law , and [ORG Barr  ] has assured us they are doing so . 
In his interview with Globus on July 21 , 2006 , Ambassador [PER Bradtke  ] said , “If [ORG Barr  ] successfully buys [ORG Pliva  ] , that will have a very positive effect on other [MISC American  ] companies that wish to expand to the [MISC Croatian  ] market.” The [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] believes that purchases of companies should be based on economic criteria . 
Whatever [ORG Pliva  ] shareholders finally decide regarding the future of their company , relations between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Croatia  ] will continue to be strong .
