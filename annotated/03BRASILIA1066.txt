<code><pre>UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 001066 SIPDIS SENSITIVE USTR FOR RSMITH , SCRONIN E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: <a href='/tag/ETRD_0.html'>ETRD</a> <a href='/tag/BR_0.html'>BR</a> <a href='/tag/FTAA_0.html'>FTAA</a> SUBJECT: [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] [ORG FTAA  ] COORDINATOR ON A SOCIAL AGENDA FOR THE NEGOTIATIONS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED , PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) [MISC Brazilian  ] press reported on March 28 that President [PER Lula  ] wants to include discussion of social issues in the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations and that the [ORG GOB  ] plans to submit proposals for doing so at the [ORG Trade Negotiating Committee  ] ( [ORG TNC  ] ) meeting in [LOC Puebla  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] April 7-11 . 
In discussions with EconOff on March 31 , [PER Tovar  ] da [PER Silva Nunes  ] , head of the [ORG FTAA Coordinating Office  ] in the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) , identified six social issues that the [ORG GOB  ] will propose be addressed formally within the [ORG FTAA  ] process: employment , environment , small and medium enterprises , poverty , family agriculture , and cultural values . 
( Note: the inclusion of family agriculture is consistent with recent statements by the [MISC Brazilian  ] Agriculture Minister that indicate the [ORG GOB  ] may be softening its opposition in trade negotiations toward certain domestic support programs that are designed to aid family farms . 
) The [ORG GOB  ] also plans to propose that all [ORG FTAA  ] market access offers be made available on the internet. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Tovar  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] will be vetting a proposal to include discussion of these social issues within the [ORG FTAA  ] with its Mercosul partners in meetings April 3-4 in [LOC Asuncion  ] . 
He indicated that the [ORG GOB  ] plans to put forward the concept in [LOC Puebla  ] , with the expectation that consensus on establishing a mechanism may not be reached until the next [ORG TNC.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Tovar  ] suggested that one way these issues could be inserted into the [ORG FTAA  ] process would be to hold separate , hemispheric conferences for each theme . 
The products of these discussions could then be provided to Ministers for their consideration , without obligation . 
" [MISC Brazilian  ] civil society " reportedly identified these areas as those for which a better understanding of the implications of the [ORG FTAA  ] are needed said [PER Tovar  ] without further elaboration . 
He claimed that the [ORG GOB  ] does not have preconceived notions about what might emerge from such discussions . 
He also did not indicate if the intention is that this activity would fall under the existing [ORG FTAA Committee of Government Representatives  ] on Participation of [ORG Civil Society.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Tovar  ] argued that discussions of these issues at a hemispheric level could yield a deeper , more valuable discourse , particularly since many issues transcend national boundaries . 
A widespread negative perception of the [ORG FTAA  ] still persists in [MISC Brazilian  ] civil society , largely , [PER Tovar  ] argued , out of fear of the unknown . 
He claims that what [ORG NGOs  ] want is " access " to the process , to better understand it and its implications . 
While not expecting that the most outspoken critics will ever offer explicit endorsements of the [ORG FTAA  ] , he confided that [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's objective is to at least mute their criticism by incorporating them into the process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: Comments [PER Tovar  ] made suggest that the proposal also reflects the heavy burden that [ORG Itamaraty  ] is being asked to take on regarding expanded domestic consultations . 
President [PER Lula  ] has publicly committed to national discussion and debate , not only on trade policy , but across the policy board . 
Especially on trade , however , where experience does not run deep in the [ORG PT  ] government leadership , the President is determined to ensure that government actions are in tune with his social agenda , and to use expansive consultations to achieve that aim . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] feels under pressure to increase its outreach to [ORG NGOs  ] , labor unions , the Church and other actors in civil society , as well as [ORG Congress  ] . 
At the same time , it is having to expand internal government consultations . 
For instance , consideration is being given to expanding the [ORG GOB  ] trade decision-making body ( [ORG CAMEX  ] ) to include two additional ministries - Environment and Labor . 
( The six ministers that currently comprise [ORG CAMEX  ] are [ORG Itamaraty  ] ; [ORG Development , Industry and Trade  ] ; Agriculture ; Finance ; Planning ; and [PER Casa Civil  ] ( Presidency ) ) . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] may be hoping that a hemispheric process would help lighten the load of domestic consultation . 
However , [MISC Brazilian  ] civil society may not be so easily co-opted . 
NGO reps have recently been quoted as complaining not about access to trade negotiators , but that their ideas have not been incorporated into [MISC Brazilian  ] negotiating positions . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On market access issues , [PER Tovar  ] took the opportunity to state that [ORG Itamaraty  ] is still in the process of explaining [MISC Brazilian  ] offers and their implications internally to leaders in the new government , many of whom are uncomfortable with what they clearly do not understand . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] 's tactic at this point is for [LOC Brazil  ] to remain a participant within the process by submitting offers , but ones which will be very modest . 
For instance , its services offer is expected to merely reflect existing law , as will probably the investment and government procurement offers , although new carve outs to support small and medium enterprises and family farms may be included in the government procurement offer. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] hopes to convince its Mercosul partners this week to adopt the same minimalist approach . 
If successful , it will announce in [LOC Puebla  ] its readiness to put forward services , investment and government procurement offers . 
Note: [LOC Brazil  ] was able to persuade [LOC Argentina  ] to hold back its services offer at the last minute in mid-February , but not [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] ; it is unclear whether or not they will all follow [LOC Brazil  ] 's lead this time . 
Within the [ORG GOB  ] , there is not uniform endorsement of the minimalist approach . 
Reportedly , the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] ( recognizing the benefits of expanded trade for the economy , according to [PER Tovar  ] ) and the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] ( which wants increased access for competitive products ) are pushing for more ambitious offers with [ORG Itamaraty  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Development  ] taking a more cautious approach. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile the [PER Lula  ] administration is reflecting on various scenarios concerning the [ORG FTAA  ] , [ORG WTO  ] and [ORG Mercosul-EU  ] trade negotiations as it struggles to define a comprehensive trade strategy , a process they hope to complete within the next couple months . 
[PER Tovar  ] noted what he called progress made recently in the more advanced [ORG Mercosul-EU  ] trade negotiations and indicated that movement in these talks in some ways will make it easier for the [ORG GOB  ] to move in the [ORG WTO  ] and [ORG FTAA  ] , if in no other way , because of substantial technical work already completed by the [ORG GOB  ] . 
[PER Tovar  ] voiced optimism that the [ORG GOB  ] will be in a position to move more substantively on [ORG FTAA  ] market access by the summer. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [PER Tovar  ] also noted that the [ORG GOB  ] was having difficulty evaluating the [LOC U.S.  ] goods offer due to technical problems . 
In particular , he mentioned that the [LOC U.S.  ] notified base rates using HS 2002 nomenclature , but that the offer was provided in 1996 nomenclature . 
According to [PER Tovar  ] , 924 products were notified for which they cannot find a corresponding tariff line in the offer , and there were 18 items where the converse is true . 
He also complained that the trade value statistics provided for the [LOC U.S.  ] offer were for 2001 instead of 2002 .
