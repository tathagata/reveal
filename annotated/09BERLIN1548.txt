End summary . 
[ORG Interior Ministry  ] is Key ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Based on a schedule recommended by the [ORG Chancellery  ] , [PER S/E Fried  ] and Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] met first with [ORG Interior Ministry  ] State Secretary [PER Beus  ] and expressed appreciation for the new government 's willingness to consider resettling detainees . 
[PER S/E Fried  ] reviewed the numerous [MISC European  ] countries which had accepted or pledged to resettle detainees at this point , noting that progress has been made but more is needed . 
He noted he would only be passing along detainee dossiers to the [ORG MOI  ] and discussing case specifics with the [ORG MOI  ] , and not with other Government ministries , per earlier requests from the government . 
[PER S/E Fried  ] handed over the dossiers of seven detainees: two [MISC Egyptians  ] , two [MISC Syrians  ] , a [MISC Libyan  ] , and two [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
He explained that if the [ORG MOI  ] has questions or requires additional information , it can do so through established liaison channels and additionally offered for a [MISC German  ] team to visit [LOC Guantanamo  ] to conduct interviews with detainees under consideration . 
While recognizing [LOC Germany  ] 's preference for non-Uighur detainees , [PER S/E Fried  ] raised two Uighur cases for consideration based on humanitarian grounds , one who has psychological problems and the other , his brother , who serves as a caregiver . 
He also acknowledged the [MISC German  ] interest in detainees who have some connection to [LOC Germany  ] , noting the one [MISC Tunisian  ] case whose file had been conveyed last spring as the single detainee with those ties to [LOC Germany  ] . 
In total , [PER S/E Fried  ] requested that [LOC Germany  ] consider 10 detainee cases for resettlement , three cases already conveyed and seven new cases. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) State Secretary [PER Beus  ] expressed his ministry 's willingness to consider all the cases , including the [MISC Uighurs  ] , and said that his experts would review the files as soon as possible . 
Shortly after he began , Interior Minister [PER Thomas de Maiziere  ] dropped in to stress his desire to be of help . 
Continuing , [PER Beus  ] underlined the importance of keeping the current discussions and review of the detainees confidential , to which [PER S/E Fried  ] strongly agreed . 
[PER Beus  ] underlined [LOC Germany  ] 's preference for detainees who have some ties to [LOC Germany  ] , noting that this connection would provide the government with a " plausible " explanation for accepting certain detainees when faced with the argument that the [LOC U.S.  ] should be resettling them . 
[PER Beus  ] said that he would be willing to consider the two Uighur cases on humanitarian grounds , but noted that they would present special difficulties because of the diplomatic row which would likely ensue . 
[PER Beus  ] also highlighted that even if the federal government agrees to accept any detainees , it must then find a [MISC German  ] state willing to accept them . 
He also said that [MISC German  ] services would naturally keep an eye on any resettle detainees within reasonable resource means. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Beus  ] also expressed strong interest in coordinating the timing and content of any public message on [LOC Germany  ] 's consideration of and decision on resettling detainees to prevent political pressure from those who oppose the move , but regardless the government will advocate in public in favor of taking detainees if they come to a positive decision . 
He added that being able to say to the public that the [LOC U.S.  ] has also accepted detainees or otherwise explain why the [LOC U.S.  ] is not doing so would also be helpful . 
[PER S/E Fried  ] expressed his readiness to coordinate and noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] has admitted and plans to admit the more dangerous detainees for legal proceedings . 
Process and Timeframe --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Beus  ] said that he and his experts would review the files and determine if additional information is needed . 
He agreed that additional information would go through intelligence channels and expressed his preference to communicate directly with [ORG S/E Fried  ] on any matters at this stage of the process . 
He said that they would decide whether interviews are necessary when the experts have completed their review of the information . 
He estimated that a decision on taking detainees would take one-to-two months . 
[ORG MFA Plays Peripheral Role  ] ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) It was clear from the later meeting with MFA State Secretary [PER Wolf Born  ] that the [ORG Foreign Office  ] would not be a major decision-maker as on this issue . 
[ORG S/E Fried  ] reviewed in general terms the cases of detainees that we are asking the [ORG MOI  ] to consider and also highlighted the humanitarian nature of the two Uighur cases , which [PER Born  ] noted . 
[PER Born  ] said that Foreign Minister [PER Westerwelle  ] wants to be " positive , " but added that it is the [ORG MOI  ] which is the " competent " ministry on this issue . 
[PER Born  ] mainly asked questions about the numbers of detainees still at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] plans for addressing the various groups , and the possible closing date , all of which [ORG S/E Fried  ] discussed with him . 
[ORG Chancellery Confirms Reticence  ] about [MISC Uighurs  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) In the last meeting , [ORG Chancellery Security and Foreign Policy Advisor Christoph Heusgen  ] expressed appreciation that [ORG S/E Fried  ] had proceeded along the lines that the [ORG MOI  ] and [ORG Chancellery  ] had requested through Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] . 
[PER Heusgen  ] appeared to be already fully briefed on [ORG S/E Fried  ] 's earlier meeting that day with [PER Beus  ] . 
He told [ORG S/E Fried  ] that if [LOC Germany  ] were to take any [MISC Uighurs  ] , it would be best to do so in combination with other [MISC European  ] countries to prevent [LOC China  ] from focusing its opposition on any one country . 
[PER Heusgen  ] was not optimistic that [LOC China  ] would demonstrate any understanding for the two humanitarian cases . 
[PER Heusgen  ] inquired as to whether any alternatives for the [MISC Uighurs  ] exists . 
[ORG S/E Fried  ] explained possible options , while highlighting the difficulty of resettling the two individuals he is asking [LOC Germany  ] to consider . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) The new government , now in place since October 29 , appears willing to renew consideration of resettling [ORG GTMO  ] detainees and has expressed a clear desire to be of help . 
In contrast to former Interior Minister Schaeuble , current [ORG MOI  ] de [PER Maiziere  ] has not ( and is unlikely to ) flouted security concerns about cases in the press , nor indicated that [LOC Germany  ] would be hardpressed to accept any detainees put forth for security reasons . 
Nor has de [PER Maiziere  ] indicated that the fact that the [LOC U.S.  ] itself has not resettled detainees presents an insurmountable roadblock , although [PER Beus  ] indicated that [LOC U.S.  ] resettlement would help [LOC Germany  ] 's [LOC PR  ] efforts to resettle . 
All interlocutors expressed a strong interest in keeping the matter confidential and coordinating the timing and content of any public message . 
[PER Beus  ] projected sincerity and realism , noting that even if the federal government agrees , it must still identify a state that is willing to resettle the detainees . 
While all interlocutors did not outright reject the two Uighur cases , [PER Heusgen  ] made clear that the prospect of being the only [MISC European  ] country to irritate [LOC China  ] by accepting [MISC Uighurs  ] would make it difficult , although it is unclear whether [LOC Germany  ] would take part in any broader [MISC European  ] decision to resettle [ORG Uighurs.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There has to date been no mention in the press of [ORG S/E Fried  ] 's visit. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) This cable has been cleared by [ORG S/E Dan Fried  ] .
