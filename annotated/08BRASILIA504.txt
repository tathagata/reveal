Reasons 1.4 B and D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In November of last year the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] announced that it was backtracking on its effort to introduce counterterrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) legislation after a years-long effort by a working group within the [ORG Presidency  ] 's [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) to coordinate the drafting of the initiative within the government . 
Although they now seek to downplay the importance of having such legislation , prior to the reversal [ORG GOB  ] officials claimed that new anti-terrorism legislation was necessary to improve its legal regime--which currently does not treat terrorist activities , terrorism financing , or support of terrorism as crimes . 
Some news reports have suggested that President [PER Lula  ] 's powerful chief of staff quashed the proposed legislation , which had been attacked by some social activists and advocacy groups who feared it could be used against them and compared it to military era repression . 
The media and political silence that greeted the government 's reversal has exposed a vacuum on matters pertaining to terrorism among the elites whose support would be required to overcome [ORG GOB  ] resistance . 
As a result , our efforts to put this legislation back on [LOC Brazil  ] 's agenda will be an uphill climb . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) This cable is the second of two that looks at the [MISC Brazilian  ] government 's latest actions to counter terrorist activities . 
The first touched on [LOC Brazil  ] 's reform of its intelligence and counterterrorism structure . 
No Crime Without a Law to Define It <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In 2004 , the [ORG GOB  ] formed a working group within [ORG GSI  ] , the [ORG Presidency  ] 's office in charge of coordinating intelligence , counternarcotics and national security , charged with examining [MISC Brazilian  ] laws related to terrorism , as well as the way the government was structured to deal with the challenges posed by international terrorists ( ref A ) . 
Prior to this effort , [MISC Brazilian  ] government officials and outside observers had concluded that [MISC Brazilian  ] laws dealing with terrorism were ambiguous and needed updating to account for modern realities ( refs B and C ) . 
Under [MISC Brazilian  ] law , terrorist acts , their financing , and activities supporting terrorist acts are not considered crimes . 
Both the [MISC Brazilian  ] constitution and the [ORG National Security Act  ] ( Public Law 7.170 of 1983 ) , which defines crimes against national security , criminalize acts of terrorism in general . 
However , because the [ORG National Security Act  ] harkens back to the military regime , Embassy contacts have indicated that it is highly unlikely the government would ever use it to charge someone with a crime related to a terrorist activity ( Ref B ) . 
In addition , because terrorism under that law is proscribed without being typified , even in the unlikely case someone attempted to test the prevailing wisdom on the applicability of a military-era national security law to charge someone with the crime of attempting to commit an act of terrorism , they probably would be unable to do so . 
The [ORG Act  ] specifically proscribes criminal acts that could be considered acts of terrorism , such as sabotage and bombings , but only as distinct crimes from terrorism . 
Because of this , terrorist activities consisting of defined crimes under the law could not be charged explicitly as terrorism . 
Domestic Politics to Blame <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) As soon as news reports started surfacing in early 2007 that [ORG GSI  ] was about to wrap up its work , the government started coming under fire from opponents of the bill . 
The [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000504 002 OF 004 influential [ORG Ordem dos Advogados  ] do [LOC Brasil  ] ( [ORG OAB  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] bar association ) criticized the government for pushing legislation that was , according to [ORG OAB  ] 's president [PER Cezar Britto  ] , in reality a thinly veiled move to criminalize the actions of social movements and those fighting for equality . 
Forced on the defensive , several high-ranking [ORG GSI  ] officials publicly suggested that any anti-terrorism legislation would be rarely used and that judges would have discretion in applying it . 
Then in late November 2007 , the government unceremoniously announced that it would not introduce the legislation to [MISC Congress.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a meeting with [MISC Poloff  ] , Assistant Secretary [PER Jose Antonio de Macedo Soares  ] of the [ORG Secretariat for Monitoring and Institutional Studies  ] , at [ORG GSI  ] ( and [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] representative to [ORG GSI  ] , where he holds the rank of minister ) and [ORG GSI  ] advisor [PER Janer Tesch  ] [PER Hosken Alvarenga  ] explained that it was impossible to reach consensus within the government on how to define terrorism . 
Asked to confirm a news item in the daily newspaper [ORG Correio  ] Braziliense noting that Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] ( chief of staff to President [PER Lula  ] in the [LOC Casa Civil  ] ) had quashed the proposal , [PER Alvarenga  ] equivocated , suggested that several " clients " had weighed in , including the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
In the end , he did not deny the news report , stating that the decision had been a " political " one. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A [MISC Brazilian  ] War College analyst on strategic intelligence and author of numerous articles on counterterrorism topics , [PER Andre Luis Soloszyn  ] , went farther , asserting to poloff that the [ORG Correio  ] story sounded very credible to him , and that the [ORG GSI  ] working group was a smokescreen for the government to demonstrate to the [LOC US  ] and the international community that it was taking the issue of counterterrorism seriously . 
[PER Soloszyn  ] noted that there was little chance that this particular government , stacked with leftist militants who had been the object of military dictatorship-era laws designed to repress politically-motivated violence , was going to put forth a bill that would criminalize the actions of groups it sympathizes with , such as the [ORG Landless Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) , for " there is no a way to write an anti-terrorism legislation that excludes the actions of the [ORG MST  ] " . 
An [MISC Idea Whose Time Has Come  ] ( and Gone <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Asked if there was a possibility the legislation could come back some time in the future , both [PER Soares  ] and [PER Alvarenga  ] were pessimistic . 
Commenting on the enormously complex nature of the issue , [PER Alvarenga  ] noted that discussions of terrorism within [MISC Brazilian  ] society remain at an immature stage , with few experts on the topic and very few people interested . 
[PER Soares  ] added that people within and outside the government find the possibility of a terrorist attack taking place on [MISC Brazilian  ] soil so improbable that they are incapable of giving the issue much attention. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Soloszyn  ] echoed these comments , indicating that he is one of the few individuals to focus on the issue of terrorism outside the government . 
Within the government , the story is not much different , he added , and virtually no one in [ORG Congress  ] was focused on the issue . 
Most legislators and general public are so in the grip of the " it can't happen here " mentality that they lack any idea of terrorist tactics , the concept of support networks , the threat of homegrown terrorism , and exploitation of soft targets . 
According to [PER Soloszyn  ] , the issue of potential pockets of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism among segments of [LOC Brazil  ] 's large [MISC Muslim  ] community is likewise an unstudied subject among specialists , and unthinkable as a proposition among the public at large . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] mind even among the highest echelons of the government , he added , can't get past its own cliches about the multicultural paradise that is [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to him , the only factor that could change this indifference is another wave of violence like that unleashed by the [ORG First Capital Command  ] ( [ORG PCC  ] ) in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] in 2006 ( ref D ) . 
Terrorism perpetrated by [MISC Islamic  ] extremists is too remote for [MISC Brazilians  ] to worry about . 
The only way they are going to move on this , he added , is when it affects them on a daily basis . 
( Comment: In the immediate aftermath of the [ORG PCC  ] 's violence in 2006 , President [PER Lula  ] called their actions terrorism , and made noises about finally getting some anti-terrorism legislation on the books . 
End comment . 
) " We have to Stop this Farce " <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In his conversation with poloff , [PER Soares  ] dismissed the importance of the government 's reversal , arguing that the success of any potential terrorist attack against the [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy in [LOC Brasilia  ] is not going to be determined by whether there is a law on the books outlawing terrorism . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , according to him , has excellent working relationships with other countries , he noted , including with the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Soares  ] added that he hoped to continue cooperating with the [LOC US  ] , despite what he described as the " farcical " elements within the bilateral [LOC CT  ] dialogue: [PER Soares  ] did not miss the opportunity to repeat the oft-heard complaint by [ORG GOB  ] officials about comments on the part of [ORG USG  ] officials suggesting the [LOC Triborder Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) remains a top concern with regard to potential terrorist activity , which then prompt the obligatory [MISC Brazilian  ] demands for evidence of such activity . 
He called the exercise pointless , since , in his words , " we all know that your officials based their statements on information we provide the [LOC US  ] " . 
[PER Soares  ] also criticized [MISC Argentine  ] officials for their comments linking the [ORG TBA  ] to the 1994 [MISC AMIA  ] bombing in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] , calling their accusations " silly " and " baseless " . ------------- Comment: ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) After various [MISC Brazilian  ] government officials had warned of the flawed nature of the [MISC Brazilian  ] legal system , it is unfortunate , though not surprising , to hear [ORG GSI  ] officials now argue that there is no need for the [ORG GOB  ] to improve [LOC Brazil  ] 's legal regime to make it illegal to commit , finance , plan , or support terrorist acts . 
Although we cannot confirm definitively that the [LOC Casa Civil  ] quashed the initiative for political or ideological reasons , it is certainly plausible . 
Outside of some agencies focused on security issues , this government evinces very little interest in terrorism issues , much less on legislation its base has no interest in seeing enacted and that would require significant political capital to push through [ORG Congress  ] . 
Likewise , with little knowledge or enthusiasm within [ORG Congress  ] , there is no one to take up the mantle there either . 
As a result , the initiative has become an orphan of [LOC Brazil  ] 's current political realities . 
For the moment , any effort to suppress terrorism , its financing , or activities supporting terrorist activities will have to continue for the foreseeable future to follow the " [PER Al Capone  ] " approach of taking down terrorists based on customs violations , tax fraud , and other crimes that unfortunately also carry less jail time . 
While this approach can work , it is not a substitute for giving police and judges the additional legal tools that the international community has agreed are necessary in the fight against terrorism and nor is it a substitute for institutionalizing counterterrorism within the [MISC Brazilian  ] legal system . 
Taking [LOC Brazil  ] 's reform of its [LOC CT  ] structure ( ref A ) together with its backtracking [LOC CT  ] legislation once again shows a mixed picture of [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall [LOC CT  ] effort at the policy level . 
Furthermore , the low standing [LOC CT  ] holds as an issue among [LOC Brazil  ] 's elite casts some doubt as to whether the potentially useful reform of [ORG ABIN  ] will actually materialize . 
Over the next months , Mission will consult with [LOC Washington  ] agencies as we review our strategy for increasing [MISC Brazilian  ] attention to counter-terrorism. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment , cont: On a separate note , we found [MISC Soares'  ] admission that [LOC Brazil  ] provides the bulk of the intelligence on matters related to [LOC CT  ] to be highly atypical , although it sheds some light on a question that has long-puzzled the Mission . 
That is , whether policy-level officials , particularly at [LOC Itamaraty  ] , where they tend to be most disinclined to accept the suggestion that there may be terrorist elements active in their territory , receive the same information from [LOC Brazil  ] 's intelligence elements as the [LOC U.S.  ] receives . 
Although we cannot answer definitively , [PER Soares  ] comments would suggest that to be the case and that , despite their denials , they recognize the potential problems [LOC Brazil  ] faces . 
Another possibility is that they have access to the same information but , either because the information would be inadmissible in a [MISC Brazilian  ] court or because it does not meet a presumed higher threshold of what constitutes terrorist-related activity , they technically do not consider it evidence of such activity . 
This means they are either playing games or they are defining terrorism out of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Neither interpretation presents a flattering picture of the seriousness with which the senior levels of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government treat the issue of terrorism , but both are consistent with what we have seen over the last several years from a government that considers [LOC CT  ] a low priority . 
End comment .
