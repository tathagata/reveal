( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
Since April 27 , [LOC Estonia  ] has been the victim of the world 's first coordinated cyber attacks against a nation state and its political and economic infrastructure . 
The sensational nature of the story , combined with the highly technical details of the subject matter , has led to a good deal of misinformation in the public domain . 
Although [ORG GOE  ] and international analysis is ongoing , these attacks have highlighted the vulnerability of both government and private sector internet infrastructure to attacks of this nature . 
For over a month , government , banking , media , and other [MISC Estonian  ] websites , servers , and routers came under a barrage of cyber attacks . 
Defense against the attacks was extremely expensive for both [ORG GOE  ] and the private sector . 
[ORG GOE  ] and private cyber defense experts cite the nature and sophistication of the attacks as proof of [MISC Russian  ] government complicity in the attacks . 
End Summary . 
Virtual Shots Heard Round the [MISC World -----------------------------------  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Cyber attacks against [MISC Estonian  ] websites began on April 27 . 
They came in the wake of rioting in [LOC Tallinn  ] triggered by the Government of [LOC Estonia  ] 's ( [ORG GOE  ] ) preparations for relocating the so called " [MISC Bronze Soldier  ] " , a [MISC Soviet-era World War II  ] monument ( [ORG Refs  ] A and B ) . 
The attacks initially targeted [ORG GOE  ] websites including those of the [MISC Estonian  ] President , Prime Minister , [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) , and Parliament , among others . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the initial attacks were technically unsophisticated and " seemed more like a cyber riot than a cyber war . 
" However , all our [MISC Estonian  ] interlocutors clearly recognized these attacks as political in nature . 
[MISC Russian-language  ] internet chat forums held discussions exhorting people to attack [MISC Estonian  ] sites and supplied downloadable software tools to carry out the attacks . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , these initial attacks were limited to spam ( a barrage of unsolicited emails ) and cyber vandalism ( e.g. , Prime Minister [PER Andrus Ansip  ] 's photo was defaced on the [ORG Estonian Reform Party  ] 's website ) and appeared to be nothing more than a virtual mob reaction to the [MISC Bronze Soldier  ] issue . 
[MISC Estonian  ] media and press commentators were quick to accuse [LOC Moscow  ] of being responsible , interpreting these attacks as part of [MISC Russian  ] retribution for moving the [MISC Bronze Soldier  ] ( Ref C ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) However , on April 30 , a broader range of cyber attacks -- from simple spam postings to coordinated DDoS ( Distributed Denial-of-Service ) attacks -- began against [ORG GOE  ] sites . 
( Note . 
A DDoS attack is when a flood of bogus queries are made to a specific server or network of computers in order to over-saturate the target and prevent access by legitimate users . 
End Note . 
) For example , the Presidential website , which normally has a 2 million [PER Mbps  ] ( megabits per second ) capacity , was flooded with nearly 200 million Mbps of traffic . 
While none of the technology involved in the attacks was new , tactics and tools routinely shifted to prevent [MISC Estonian  ] authorities from blocking the attacks . 
One of the most pernicious tools in these attacks was " bots . 
" ( Note . 
Bots are computers and/or servers under the control of a third party . 
End Note . 
) These bot attacks came from [PER ISPs  ] ( internet service providers ) around the world ( e.g. , the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Vietnam  ] , etc . 
) . 
Attacks routinely came from one set of bots , subsided and then resumed again using another set of bots with different [PER ISPs  ] . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the attacks ranged from a single minute to many hours in length . 
The longest attacks lasted [ORG TALLINN  ] 00000366 002 OF 004 over ten hours and unleashed a crushing 90 million Mbps of traffic on targeted endpoints . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [ORG GOE  ] 's assessment was that a small but unknown number of individuals were behind these more sophisticated cyber attacks , which quickly dwarfed the traffic volume of the initial cyber rioters. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On May 3 , the cyber attacks expanded beyond [ORG GOE  ] sites and servers to private sites . 
[ORG Hansabank  ] and [ORG SEB  ] , [LOC Estonia  ] 's two largest banks , faced the most significant problems . 
Swedish-owned [ORG Hansabank  ] and [ORG SEB  ] account for almost 75% of all online banking in [LOC Estonia  ] . 
( [PER Note:  ] Approximately 90% of all money transfers and bill payments in [LOC Estonia  ] are done online . 
End Note . 
) [ORG Hansabank  ] was well prepared with powerful servers , alternate sites to mirror content ( thus making it more difficult for DDoS attacks ) , and the ability to reallocate access lines from foreign to domestic customers . 
However , even though [ORG Hansabank  ] 's site remained online , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] estimated that it came at a cost - - at least 10 million [PER Euros  ] ( $13.4 million ) [ORG Hansabank  ] also had to temporarily block access to its site by all foreign [MISC ISPs  ] so that there was enough broadband capacity for its domestic clients . 
However , [ORG Hansabank  ] was able to create alternate access mechanisms for its largest foreign customers . 
Correcting much of the press coverage in the early days of the attacks , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that while the cyber attacks against [ORG Hansabank  ] and [ORG SEB  ] were a challenge , there was no serious danger of [LOC Estonia  ] 's banking sector being shut down. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) This second wave of cyber attacks also hit the websites of [ORG Postimees  ] , [LOC Estonia  ] 's paper of record , and [ORG Eesti Paevaleht  ] , a leading [MISC Estonian-language  ] daily , which over two-thirds of [MISC Estonians  ] regularly visit for their news . 
" Imagine if you can the psychological effect , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked us , " when an [MISC Estonian  ] tries to pay his bills but can't or get the news online but can't . 
" As one of the most wired countries on the planet , [ORG GOE  ] interlocutors viewed the evolution of the attacks as a frightening threat to key economic and societal infrastructure. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The attacks reached their apex on May 9 , the [MISC Russian  ] anniversary of the end of [MISC World War II  ] . 
To cope with the rising volume of attacks , the [ORG GOE  ] increased its broadband capacity from two [MISC Gbps  ] ( Gigabites per second ) to eight [MISC Gbps  ] . 
[ORG Hansabank  ] , [ORG SEB  ] , [ORG Postimees  ] , and others also added servers to increase broadband capacity . 
A EUCOM cyber defense expert described it as a " cyber arms race " where the [MISC Estonians  ] repeatedly increased their broadband capacity to match the increasing volume of cyber attacks ( Ref D ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] increased the " broadband pipe " for both government and private clients at a frantic pace to keep up with the attacks . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that one [ORG GOE  ] ministry increased its original server capacity of 30 Mbps to 1 [MISC Gbps  ] ( 1 [MISC Gbps  ] equals 1000 Mbps ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that this defensive response by the [ORG GOE  ] and the private sector was ultimately successful , but it was extremely expensive. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The number of attacks steadily declined after May 9 and 10 , allowing [ORG GOE  ] and private sites to reduce their broadband capacity . 
However , on May 15 , there was an unexpected spike in attacks that focused on [ORG Hansabank  ] and [ORG SEB  ] . 
In two separate and coordinated 15 minute attacks , these two sites were hit with over 400 bot attacks ( roughly half the number of bot attacks recorded on May 10 ) from multiple [PER ISPs  ] . 
The attacks temporarily crashed [ORG SEB  ] 's site for 30 minutes . 
Since the May 15 spike , the number of attacks has declined and is now hovering slightly above pre-April 27 numbers . 
No Smoking Gun [ORG TALLINN  ] 00000366 003 OF 004 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On May 2 , Foreign Minister [PER Urmas Paet  ] released a statement that the MFA had proof that some of the attacks originated from [ORG GOR  ] [MISC ISPs  ] . 
The [MISC Estonian  ] and international press carried [PER Paet  ] 's claim , but [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] interlocutors distanced themselves from the accusation . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] privately said to us that no " smoking gun " incriminating [LOC Moscow  ] has turned up and likely won't . 
The use of bots , proxies , and spoofing tactics makes it extremely difficult to determine with any certainty the origin of the attacks . 
Press reports suggested that a million computers were involved in the attacks . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] admitted that due to [LOC Estonia  ] 's poor monitoring capability , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] could only speculate on the number of computers and servers attacking [LOC Estonia  ] , and had even less specific information on the origins of the attacks . 
( Note . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the one million figure used by the press and the [ORG GOE  ] was from a quote to the press taken out of context in which he tried to explain how he could only speculate a number ranging from a 1000 to a million computers . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GOE  ] believes it has enough circumstantial evidence to link [LOC Moscow  ] with the attacks . 
As President [PER Ilves  ] told the Ambassador , renting the large number of bots used in these attacks is an expensive business . 
Moreover , as [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] repeatedly asked us in conversations , " Who benefits from these attacks ? 
" He speculated that the probing nature of the attacks on specific government and strategic private sector targets through the use of anonymous proxies fit the modus operandi of the [MISC Putin  ] regime testing a new " weapon . 
" XXXXXXXXXXXXX told us that the [ORG GOE  ] now feels that their original assessment of a " cyber riot " may have been incorrect . 
" Looking at the patterns of the attacks , it is clear that there was a small , core of individuals who intended to launch their attack on May 9 , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , " but when the [ORG MOD  ] announced its plans to move the [MISC Bronze Soldier  ] on April 27 , they moved up their plans to try to link the attacks with the monument 's removal . 
" [MISC Estonian  ] analysis of these later sophisticated attacks and organization through [MISC Russian-language  ] internet forums has led them to believe that the key individuals tried to disguise their initial attacks as a cyber riot . 
" You don't expect spontaneous , populist cyber attacks to have a pre-determined list of targets and precise dates and times for coordinated attacks , " said [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG GOE  ] interlocutors expressed their frustration that their requests for information from the [ORG GOR  ] or action on [MISC Russian-based  ] ISP attacks were not answered or acted upon . 
XXXXXXXXXXX complained that cooperation with [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG CERT  ] was almost nonexistent . 
Even at the height of the [LOC Bronze Soldier  ] controversy , [ORG GOE  ] interlocutors who regularly work with their [MISC Russian  ] counterparts ( e.g. , law enforcement , customs and tax , border guards , etc . 
) tell us that working level cooperation was positive . 
In comparison , the lack of responsiveness by the [ORG GOR  ] and [MISC Russian  ] [ORG CERT  ] personnel only diminished [LOC Russia  ] 's claims of innocence in the eyes of the [MISC Estonians.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On May 29 , [PER Konstantin Koloskokov  ] , Commissar of the pro-Kremlin youth group [ORG Nashi  ] in [LOC Transnistria  ] , claimed responsibility for some of the early cyber attacks . 
While not discounting the possibility of his involvement , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that some of the attacks were extremely sophisticated ; beyond the technical abilities of an amateur . 
To illustrate the point , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described an attack that used a mysterious data packet to crash a [ORG GOE  ] and [ORG Elion  ] router so quickly that the [MISC Estonians  ] are still uncertain how it was done . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described in detail a number of additional attacks using different tools and techniques and targets to argue that an organized group with deep financial backing was the likeliest culprit . 
" [PER Koloskokov  ] is window dressing , " said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , " a convenient set-up by the real perpetrators .
