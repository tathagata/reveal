( C ) Summary . 
The [ORG SARG  ] worked to portray the June 15 visit by two [MISC French  ] presidential envoys as a vindication of [LOC Syria  ] 's hard-line policy of " resistance . 
" The [MISC French  ] themselves say the visit was successful as it furthered the [ORG GOF  ] 's priority of ensuring President [PER Asad  ] participate in the [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] summit in [LOC Paris  ] on July 13 . 
According to our [MISC French  ] colleagues in [LOC Damascus  ] , [PER Asad  ] told them that he was optomistic a new cabinet would be formed in the next week or two in [LOC Beirut  ] ; the [ORG SARG  ] supported both the [MISC Egyptian  ] effort to broker a cease-fire between [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] , and would soon host [PER Abu Mazen  ] in an effort to heal the [PER Fatah  ] - [ORG Hamas  ] rupture . 
[PER Asad  ] declined to be engaged on human rights and detained political prisoners . 
And he stated flatly that the [ORG SARG  ] would make no effort to engage the [ORG USG  ] until after the election in November . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The June 15 one-day visit of secretary general of President [PER Sarkozy  ] , s office , [PER Claude Gueant  ] , and [PER Sarkozy  ] , s chief diplomatic advisor , [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] , was front page news in [LOC Syria  ] , s state-owned papers . 
The lead editorial in [LOC Al-Thawra  ] commented that the visit showed that the [ORG SARG  ] , s policy &of resistance8 had succeeded and [LOC France  ] was therefore compelled to reengage [LOC Syria  ] on the [ORG SARG  ] , s terms . 
The reporting of the quasi-independent [ORG Al-Watan  ] , which coordinates its political commentary closely with the security services , implied the visit highlighted a fracture in [LOC U.S  ] . 
) [MISC French  ] policy towards [LOC Syria.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In contrast , [PER Nicolas Suran  ] , [ORG DCM  ] at the [MISC French  ] embassy , categorized the visit as a success and offered us the following readout . 
The two presidential advisors had a one and a half hour meeting with President [PER Bashar Al-Asad  ] followed by a meeting and then lunch with FM [PER Walid Muallem  ] . 
Both meetings were focused on [LOC Syria  ] , s participation in the upcoming July 13 [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] summit in [LOC Paris  ] . 
According to [PER Suran  ] , [PER Levitte  ] and [PER Gueant  ] were able to answer [PER Asad  ] and [PER Muallem  ] , s concerns regarding the proposed [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] making [PER Asad  ] , s participation more likely . 
[PER Suran  ] said , baring unfavorable regional developments , [PER Asad  ] would attend the summit next month in [LOC Paris  ] . 
It was agreed that FM [PER Muallem  ] will visit [LOC Paris  ] in early July to prepare for [PER Asad  ] , s visit later the same month . 
[PER Suran  ] qualified the [ORG SARG  ] commitment as &progress8 given the fact that just a month and a half ago [PER Asad  ] was not planning to attend and was echoing others , criticisms of both the summit and the proposed [MISC Union.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Suran  ] said discussions covered the full range of regional issues as well . 
On [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Asad  ] said the [ORG SARG  ] had very little ability to influence the political process at this point and that a failure would be a result of internal maneuvering by [MISC Lebanese  ] politicians . 
Nonetheless , both [PER Asad  ] and [PER Muallem  ] were optimistic that a new cabinet would be formed in the next week or two . 
[PER Asad  ] said [LOC Syria  ] would remain committed to the [LOC Turkey  ] brokered talks with [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] reportedly told the [MISC French  ] that [LOC Syria  ] was actively supporting [LOC Egypt  ] , s attempt to conclude a cease fire between [ORG Hamas  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
[LOC Syria  ] was also working at [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation and would host [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmud Abbas  ] in the next four or five days in an attempt to further the process , according to [LOC Suran.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Suran  ] said [PER Gueant  ] and [PER Levitte  ] raised human rights and detained political prisoners with [PER Asad  ] . 
Following his now standard practice , [PER Asad  ] demurred and asserted that both issues were &internal affairs8 and not to be discussed with visitors . 
[PER Suran  ] commented that , nonetheless , neither [PER Gueant  ] nor [PER Levitte  ] were put-off by [PER Asad  ] , s answer but were instead encouraged that [PER Asad  ] , s manner seemed to allow the issue to remain on the table . 
[PER Suran  ] reminded us that when then President [PER Chirac  ] visited [LOC Damascus  ] in 2000 [PER Asad  ] did release [PER Riad Turk  ] from jail in answer to [PER Chirac  ] , s direct appeal . 
[PER Suran  ] commented that a similar result would be possible if [PER Asad  ] , s July 13 visit to [LOC Paris  ] were to be successful. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Suran  ] said the only area the [MISC Syrians  ] were not responsive on was a request to stop arms shipments to [ORG Hezbollah  ] , and to take more positive actions to improve [LOC Iraq  ] , s security . 
According to [PER Suran  ] , [PER Asad  ] linked the requests to the [ORG USG  ] and asserted the [ORG SARG  ] felt no need to provide concessions to the current Administration . 
According to [PER Suran  ] , both [PER Asad  ] and [PER Muallem  ] were adamant that they had [LOC DAMASCUS  ] 00000427 002 OF 002 written off the [ORG Bush Administration  ] and would make no gesture or concession towards the [LOC U.S.  ] until a new administration was in the [LOC White House.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Based on both their public and private statements , it is apparent that the [MISC Syrians  ] believe they are dealing from a position of strength not only with the [MISC French  ] but also the western world writ large . 
Still the [MISC Syrians  ] are ready for their isolation to end . 
As [PER Suran  ] commented , [PER Asad  ] has not visited a western capitol in years and so is obviously anxious to be received in [LOC Paris  ] for the [LOC PR  ] value if nothing else .
