[PER Clifford Sobel  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: According to [MISC Dutch  ] sources , the [ORG European Council  ] will most likely decide in December to open accession talks with [LOC Turkey  ] , setting a fixed starting date contingent on [LOC Turkey  ] 's completion of specific concrete reforms . 
Senior [MISC Dutch  ] officials based in The [MISC Hague  ] are playing an active role in guiding the drafting of the [ORG European Commission  ] 's October report . 
In this poker game , the Government of [LOC Cyprus  ] remains one possible wild card . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) In recent discussions with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] , [PER Rob Swartbol  ] ( PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's senior foreign policy advisor ) has given clear indications that the [MISC Dutch  ] are seeking to guide the [ORG EU  ] toward a positive ( albeit conditional ) decision to begin accession talks with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
In separate discussions following EUR DAS [PER Laura Kennedy  ] 's meetings in [LOC Brussels  ] ( reftel ) , [PER Poloff  ] received similar signals from [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] MFA rep for [ORG European Integration  ] ( please protect ) , and [PER Hannie Pollmann-Zaal  ] . 
YES TO TURKEY... ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) On July 29 , [PER Swartbol  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that he believed the [ORG EU  ] could set an October , 2005 date for opening accession talks with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
He asserted that nearly all [ORG EU  ] member states recognized that [LOC Turkey  ] would receive a yes decision from the [ORG EU  ] , although some still hoped to push the date for starting talks back one or two years ; this , however , would be a mistake , he said . 
[PER Swartbol  ] predicted actual accession negotiations from 6 to 8 years plus two and suggested that -- contrary to usual practice -- the [ORG EU  ] would probably try to address some of the toughest issues ( like immigration ) early in the process rather than waiting until the end . 
[PER Swartbol  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] would be careful not to talk about a 10-year process publicly in deference to [MISC Turkish  ] sensitivities. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Swartbol  ] revealed that the [LOC Turks  ] had been consulted about the proposed conditions and timetable described above , but they had not yet agreed . 
Several [ORG EU  ] members also remained unconvinced . 
[ORG EU  ] Commissioner [PER Verheugen  ] , he said , would go to [LOC Turkey  ] in September to try to gain [MISC Turkish  ] support for the [ORG EC  ] report. ...WITH QUALIFICATIONS ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Swartbol  ] and [PER de Gooijer  ] confirmed that most [ORG EU  ] Members assume the [ORG Commission  ] will appraise [LOC Turkey  ] 's success with the [ORG Copenhagen Criteria  ] as virtually , almost , or just about . 
It is impossible to imagine a no , [PER de Gooijer  ] said . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] cannot imagine an unqualified yes , either , listing outstanding issues such as judges' behavior , concerns about torture , access of [MISC Kurds  ] to [MISC Kurdish  ] language education , free exercise of religion , and the role of the military. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) The question remains what the [ORG Council  ] will do with these areas of improvement . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] anticipate the [ORG EU  ] Yes will come with one list of goals for [LOC Turkey  ] to reach within six to eight months before starting negotiations and a second list of other items that could slow the process down if [LOC Turkey  ] did not make progress toward achieving them . 
[PER Swartbol  ] noted that the [ORG EU  ] would ensure that negotiations would tackle the tough issues identified in the impact statement. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER De Gooijer  ] cautioned that [LOC Turkey  ] should concentrate on the yes and the date parts of the recommendation and not be overly-concerned by the blah-blah-blah that follows it where the [ORG Council  ] may list must-do items for the [LOC Turks  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] AND [MISC DUTCH  ] POLITICS: MORE FOR THAN AGAINST -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Swartbol  ] cited [LOC France  ] , [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] ( where the Prime Minister is the problem ) and the [LOC Netherlands  ] as still needing more work on the domestic front . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] , in the Presidency role , will strive for objectivity in public and eschew overt statements about what [MISC Dutch  ] preferences or strategies , [PER de Gooijer  ] said to watch for [MISC Dutch  ] signals . 
He recalled PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's July 21 [ORG Strasbourg Parliament  ] speech , where he rejected prejudice against [MISC Islam  ] as a basis for opposing [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] allowed how he had written , championed , and insured inclusion of the following lines , which he proudly reported received warm applause that day: We must not allow ourselves to be guided by fear , for example , of [MISC Islam  ] . 
Raising barriers to any particular religion does not fit in with [LOC Europe  ] 's shared values . 
Our opposition should be directed not against religions but against people and groups misusing their religion to get their way by force. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Swartbol  ] said that potential divisions within the [MISC Dutch  ] government had largely been resolved , thanks in part to [PER Verheugen  ] 's ( quiet ) briefing of the [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] agreed that the [MISC Dutch  ] government will ultimately support accession ; [PER Pollman  ] was not so sure . 
Both feel that momentum toward Yes is lacking . 
[PER Pollman  ] alerted us that the constituents of some cabinet ministers could be tending negative , meaning the ministers would have to convince them otherwise or vote and anger the base . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] and [PER Pollman  ] predicted any opponents will eventually modify positions enough to be able to wag their fingers and say , We have serious problems with this and if it does not work out , well , we told you so . 
THE TIMING OF THE WRITING OF THE REPORT --------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [PER De Gooijer  ] ( please protect ) confirmed that [ORG Commission  ] officers have been on the ground in [LOC Turkey  ] in July surveying conditions across the full matrix of issues . 
The various arms of the [ORG Commission  ] will complete individual parts of the report during August and give it to [PER Verheugen  ] , who will collate the parts and circulate a complete draft in early September . 
He will present a final draft to the full [ORG Commission  ] on October 6 . 
The [ORG Commission  ] will present it to the [ORG Council  ] thereafter , by [MISC November.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) Both [PER Swartbol  ] and [PER de Gooijer  ] said that the [MISC Dutch  ] ( as President ) and the [ORG Commission  ] were trying to stay in sync on the report , meaning that the [MISC Dutch  ] will have large influence over all aspects of it . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] added that the [ORG Commission  ] is loathe to get out in front of the Presidency on any issue , especially one like this . 
[PER Swartbol  ] , while cautioning that the [MISC Dutch  ] did not hold the pen , was also confident that the report would not hold any surprises for the presidency . 
( Note: Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] stressed that it should not hold any surprises for us or [LOC Turkey  ] either , and pressed [PER Swartbol  ] to ensure that the process was as transparent as possible . 
) WILD CARD [LOC CYPRUS  ] ---------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Pollman  ] suggested the [ORG EU  ] might give the [ORG GoC  ] , as an [ORG EU  ] Member State , its due on the [LOC Cyprus  ] trade and financial support issues while then expecting [PER Papadopoulos  ] to relent on [LOC Turkey  ] . 
However , [ORG EU  ] partners do not really engage on [LOC Cyprus  ] since only the [LOC UK  ] has any real interest in the island , she said , adding , What does [LOC Cyprus  ] have these days , besides the [LOC Turkey  ] card ? 
And this means the [ORG EU  ] has but little leverage over [LOC Cyprus  ] ; [PER Pollman  ] hoped that powers outside the [ORG EU  ] will pressure Popadopolous to support [MISC Turkish  ] accession , using whatever psychological , political , or other means that might work . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC Dutch  ] governing elite want a Yes for [LOC Turkey  ] and they seem confident that they can bring the nation as well as the rest of the [ORG EU  ] along . 
There is finesse at the top , as seen in [PER de Gooijer  ] 's handling of the [MISC Islam  ] question for PM [PER Balkenende  ] . 
There are many variables open and many forces at work , but the trends -- at least for now -- seem to be moving in the right direction .
