( C ) Summary: Post coordinated a July 21 briefing for [MISC Dutch  ] officials on [LOC U.S.  ] concerns regarding a possible lift of the [ORG EU China  ] arms embargo .

[MISC Dutch  ] interlocutors appreciated the broad scope of the briefing , describing the [MISC Chinese  ] military buildup as disturbing . 
They also acknowledged that [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Japanese  ] invocation of their strategic interests was relevant to [ORG EU  ] deliberations . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] side also repeated previous arguments in favor of replacing the embargo with an enhanced [ORG EU Code of Conduct  ] on arms transfers and asserted that [LOC China  ] 's current human rights practices could be viewed in a glass half empty/half full context . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Security Policy Bureau  ] Director [PER Maurits Jochems  ] hosted the July 21 briefing for [MISC Dutch  ] officials by [ORG DRL Senior Advisor  ] [PER Susan O'Sullivan  ] and [ORG EAP  ] Analyst [PER John Culver  ] . 
Present were [ORG MFA Amb. for Human Rights Piet de Klerk  ] , representatives from [ORG MFA 's Security Policy  ] , [ORG Political Affairs  ] and [ORG Asian Affairs  ] offices as well as from [MISC Dutch  ] military intelligence , [ORG Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] and the Prime Minister 's office . 
[PER O'Sullivan  ] and [PER Culver  ] provided comprehensive overviews of [LOC U.S.  ] human rights and regional stability concerns regarding [LOC China  ] followed by a question and answer session. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jochems  ] opened the question period by describing the report on [LOC China  ] 's military buildup as disturbing . 
He noted that the [MISC Japanese  ] had also raised concerns about lifting the embargo with the [ORG GONL  ] . 
He observed that [LOC China  ] 's rapid economic development provided a basis for rapid military modernization irrespective of [ORG EU  ] action , and asked whether maintaining the embargo was relevant given [MISC Chinese  ] progress in spite of it . 
[PER Jochems  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] was looking at options to enhance the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Code of Conduct  ] on arms transfers , e.g. , a [ORG Code of Conduct Plus  ] or [ORG Double Plus  ] which would also capture dual use items . 
Finally , he suggested that the large presence of western , including [MISC Dutch  ] , technology and manufacturing companies in [LOC China  ] was already a major factor in [LOC China  ] 's buildup. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jaap Werner  ] , Director of [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG Political Affairs Bureau  ] ( [PER PolDir Siblesz  ] 's office ) , acknowledged that it was relevant to [ORG EU  ] decision-making if the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC Japanese  ] invoked their strategic interest in this matter . 
On the other hand , [PER Werner  ] suggested , [LOC China  ] 's military buildup might be understood in the context of its territorial problem or perhaps as a world power asserting itself . 
He asked pointedly why the [LOC U.S.  ] preferred the embargo to a stronger , more effective [ORG Code of Conduct  ] . 
[PER Werner  ] also argued that it was important to take into account positive trends in [LOC China  ] 's human rights and security practices , and suggested that an increased [MISC EU-China  ] relationship could provide enhanced opportunities for engaging on issues of concern. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Margarita Bot  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director for [ORG Asian Affairs  ] , claimed [LOC China  ] 's human rights practices could be viewed in terms of a glass half empty or half full . 
She also suggested that [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales to [LOC Taiwan  ] might be a factor in [LOC China  ] 's rapid military buildup . 
The three [MISC Dutch  ] military intelligence officers present disputed none of the conclusions and expressed interest in hearing more about [LOC China  ] 's military buildup. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) While acknowledging some progress by [LOC China  ] on human rights during the last fifteen years , the [LOC U.S.  ] side stressed the consistent lack of tolerance by the [ORG PRC  ] of anyone speaking out in criticism of the regime , noting the significant numbers of detainees . 
We also observed that the [MISC Chinese  ] would treat an embargo lift as a significant propaganda victory . 
Noting [LOC Taiwan  ] 's decreased defense budget the [LOC U.S.  ] side flatly rejected the suggestion that [LOC China  ] 's buildup was tied to increased [LOC U.S.  ] arms sales. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: The senior officials present ( especially [PER Jochems  ] , [PER Werner  ] , and [PER Bot  ] ) generally stuck to previously expressed comments ( ref B ) in their interventions , and did not challenge the validity of the information presented by the briefers . 
As noted in previous reporting , the strong [MISC Dutch  ] desire for a successful [LOC EU-China Summit  ] on their watch as [ORG EU  ] President ( refs A-C ) has offset to a large degree traditional [MISC Dutch  ] concerns regarding human rights and regional stability . 
This timely briefing served as a useful reminder that these concerns remain valid , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] will not allow them to be swept under the rug for the sake of [ORG EU  ] unity . 
Post very much appreciates the efforts of [PER Susan O'Sullivan  ] and [PER John Culver  ] in presenting such a detailed and thorough briefing on very short notice .
