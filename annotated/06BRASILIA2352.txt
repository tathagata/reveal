( Note: [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign ministry ( MRE ) organizes presentation of ambassadorial credentials into groups of four , based on order of arrival in country . 
End note . 
) All of the 7 November group had been waiting several months for the credentials ceremony , owing to repeated delays caused by [LOC Brazil  ] 's presidential election season , which concluded with [PER Lula  ] 's re-election victory on 29 October . 
Each ambassador met separately with [PER Lula  ] , who determined the length of the conversation . 
[PER Lula  ] conversed with Ambassador for approximately 30 minutes , and was accompanied by Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] and Presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] . 
Ambassador was accompanied in the meeting by [MISC A/DCM  ] and Management Counselor , and later joined by Mrs. [PER Sobel  ] for photos and to observe conclusion of the ceremony with Ambassador 's review of the palace guard . 
Key points of the meeting with [PER Lula  ] follow below: --Bio-fuels: [PER Lula  ] led with this and stayed with the subject throughout the first part of the conversation with Ambassador . 
[PER Lula  ] noted he had discussed bio-fuels extensively with President [PER Bush  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] stressed [LOC Brazil  ] , s desire for partnerships with the [ORG USG  ] and [MISC American  ] firms in this , calling it a transformational technology that could dramatically improve lives throughout the world . 
[PER Lula  ] noted [LOC Brazil  ] is bringing on line a total of 93 distilleries for bio-fuel processing in the next years . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] confirmed President [PER Bush  ] 's keen attention to the issue , and presented [PER Lula  ] with a photo , autographed by President [PER Bush  ] , from the [ORG G-8 St. Petersburg  ] ministerial , where [PER Lula  ] presented information on [LOC Brazil  ] 's bio-fuels program to the President . 
Ambassador further explained that the [ORG USG  ] continues to organize its interagency to address bio-fuels in a comprehensive policy format , and that Under Secretary [PER Josette Sheeran  ] recently had been given the [ORG USG  ] lead on bio-fuels and is anxious to visit [LOC Brazil  ] this year. --Visit to [PER U.S.: Lula  ] noted that he spoken recently with President [PER Bush  ] , who asked him to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Lula  ] expressed a desire to visit soon , though he quipped that he worried about the cold in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Ambassador noted that he also had been in touch with the [LOC White House  ] on the visit , and made himself available to [PER Lula  ] and his chief of staff to discuss windows of opportunity and venues. --Strategic relationship: [PER Lula  ] noted that the [ORG GOB  ] wants to send a new ambassador to [LOC Washington  ] asap . 
( Note: Current MRE Under Secretary for Political Affairs Ambassador [PER Antonio de Aguiar  ] Patriota has been presented for agrement vice Ambassador [PER Roberto Abdenur  ] ) . 
[PER Lula  ] seemed anxious to convey this as a positive signal . 
[PER Lula  ] then made a strong and direct declaration: " We intend to take all steps necessary to make clear , beyond any doubt , that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] have a strategic relationship . 
" Ambassador welcomed this , and replied that the [ORG USG  ] is not concerned with [LOC Brazil  ] 's " prioritization " of its relations with countries , but rather is focused on " what we can do together . 
" In response , [PER Lula  ] and [PER Amorim  ] simultaneously weighed in to dismiss media speculation that [ORG GOB  ] foreign policy priorities remain focused on south-south relations . 
[PER Lula  ] also noted that he wanted to re-invigorate the working groups established in various areas during his official visit to [LOC Washington  ] at the beginning of his first term. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: The reception at [LOC Planalto  ] and the conversation with [PER Lula  ] could not have been more positive . 
In the days following [PER Lula  ] 's re-election , the signals continue to be clear and persistent that the [ORG GOB  ] wants to move more our way in the second term . 
But we will remain in wait and see mode for now , staying attentive to other developments that would indicate whether this charm offensive translates into a meaningful shift in foreign policy for [LOC Brazil  ] .
