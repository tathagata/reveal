John  ] , reason: 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Former Prime Minister [PER Samak Sundaravej  ] resigned from his position as Party Leader of the [ORG People’s Power Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) September 30 . 
He remains free on bail as he continues to appeal a years-old defamation conviction . 
[PER Samak  ] told the Ambassador September 26 that he believed Queen [PER Sirikit  ] , working through [ORG Privy Council President  ] [PER Prem Tinsulanonda  ] , supported the [ORG People’s Alliance for Democracy  ] ( [ORG PAD  ] ) protest movement . 
[PER Samak  ] viewed himself as loyal to the King , but implied that the [MISC Queen’s  ] political agenda differened from her husband’s . 
Separately , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed to the Ambassador October 1 that he had begun direct negotiations with the [ORG PAD  ] and suggested that he and the current [PER Somchai  ] administration had 90 days to produce results. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX’s expectation that his term in office may be short-lived tracks with a widespread view among Thais that the [ORG PPP  ] will be fighting against the odds for its survival in upcoming party dissolution proceedings . 
Although [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] provides proof that senior [MISC Thai  ] politicians can often revive careers , we believe [PER Samak  ] has lost virtually all of his influence and has little prospect of staging a political comeback . 
PM [PER Somchai Wongsawat  ] appears likely to succeed [PER Samak  ] as [ORG PPP Party  ] Leader . 
End Summary and Comment . 
[PER SAMAK  ] QUITS PPP POST , HEADS TO DISNEY WORLD ------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On September 30 , a [ORG PPP  ] official told the media that former PM [PER Samak Sundaravej  ] had formally resigned from his position of [ORG PPP Party  ] Leader . 
This resignation followed an Appeals Court’s September 25 ruling upholding a previous conviction of [PER Samak  ] on defamation charges , and affirming the two-year prison sentence for [PER Samak  ] . 
In a September 26 lunch with the Ambassador , [PER Samak  ] explained that he expected to remain free on bail while continuing to appeal this case through other channels ; he predicted his legal battle could continue for approximately two years before he might have to face incarceration . 
[PER Samak  ] planned to join unnamed associates for an extended [MISC North American  ] vacation starting with [ORG Disney World  ] , criss-crossing the [LOC United States  ] and parts of [LOC Canada  ] by car. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Note: Once [PER Samak  ] lost face after [ORG PPP  ] legislators signaled their unwillingness to support his reelection as Prime Minister ( reftel ) , it would have been awkward for [PER Samak  ] to retain the position of Party Leader . 
[ORG PPP  ] immediately named PM [PER Somchai  ] as acting party leader . 
Political parties typically nominate their [MISC Party Leaders  ] for the position of Prime Minister ; it would be logical to assume that [PER Somchai  ] will formally take the top job in [ORG PPP  ] . 
Samak’s resignation will not protect [PER Samak  ] from a five-year loss of political rights in the event that [ORG PPP  ] is dissolved . 
Party dissolution by the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] entails sanctions against the executive board that was in place at the time of the dissolution-warranting offense . 
[PER SAMAK  ] DISCUSSES HIS DOWNFALL , CRITICIZES THE QUEEN --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Samak  ] described to Ambassador the political pressure against him during his seven months in office . 
He showed disdain for Queen [PER Sirikit  ] , claiming that she had been responsible for the 2006 coup d’etat as well as the ongoing turmoil generated by [ORG PAD  ] protests . 
He alleged the Queen operated through [ORG Privy Council President  ] [PER Prem Tinsulanonda  ] who , along with others presenting themselves as royalists , worked with the [ORG PAD  ] and other agitators . 
Citing his own regular meetings with King [PER Bhumibol  ] , [PER Samak  ] claimed he -- rather than his opponents -- was sincerely loyal to the King and enjoyed the [MISC King’s  ] support . 
In his discussion of the [LOC BANGKOK  ] 00002977 002.2 OF 002 monarchy , [PER Samak  ] made no mention of the [ORG Crown Prince.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Samak  ] , a former journalist , lamented his opponents’ success in manipulating media coverage of his administration . 
[PER Samak  ] noted that jockeying for control over the media had often caused rifts within [MISC Thai  ] Rak [MISC Thai  ] and , subsequently , the [ORG People’s Power Party.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Samak’s eyes became misty as he recalled that , when he was contemplating returning to the premiership after eviction from office by the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] , his wife and one of his daughters had pressed him to abandon this quest. “I told them to get out , ” he related. “I didn’t need to be betrayed by them.” Out with the [LOC Old  ] , Out with the New ? ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] indicated to Ambassador October 1 that he expected the [PER Somchai  ] administration to be short-lived , though he hoped it could be extended if it proved successful in addressing the serious challenges facing the country . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] If Somchai’s administration were to prove effective , he hoped the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] might delay dissolution proceedings against various coalition parties to allow the government more time in office ( note: the Attorney General announced later on October 1 that he had referred the first case , against Chat [MISC Thai  ] , to the [ORG Constitution Court  ] for review ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On the ongoing [ORG PAD  ] occupation of [LOC Government House  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he had twice spoken with [ORG PAD  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , most recently on the night of September 30 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described his approach toward the [ORG PAD  ] as similar to that which he had taken toward communist insurgents in the 1970s and 80s: he would initially stress commonalities while deemphasizing differences , which would be sorted out later . 
( Septel will report XXXXXXXXXXXX’s views on mediating the southern insurgency .
