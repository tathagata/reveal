( S ) [LOC Iran  ] dominated A/S [PER Gordon  ] 's 40-minute meeting November 12 with Foreign Minister [PER Davutoglu  ] . 
The FM had just gotten off the phone with [PER El-Baradei  ] and had discussed in detail the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal to send [LOC Iran  ] 's low enriched uranium to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER El-Baradei  ] had said he would " call [LOC Washington  ] " that same morning . 
This had followed two long " harsh " sessions with the [MISC Iranians  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] on Sunday evening . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] have said they are willing to meet with [PER Solana  ] , but have told the [LOC Turks  ] that they have serious problems with [PER Cooper  ] and the [MISC British  ] . 
They have " more trust " in the [LOC U.S.  ] The [MISC Iranians  ] would also prefer to get fuel from the [LOC U.S.  ] rather than the [MISC Russians.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [PER Davutoglu  ] said the [MISC Iranians:  ] a ) are ready to send a delegation to [LOC Vienna  ] to work out the specifics on this proposal ; b ) have given their " full trust " to [LOC Turkey  ] ; c ) continue to face serious domestic problems inside [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said the [LOC Turks  ] actually see [PER Ahmadinejad  ] as " more flexible " than others who are inside the [MISC Iranian  ] Government . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] is facing " huge pressure " after statements from some P5 members to the effect that a nuclear deal would succeed in weakening [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear capability -- which is interpreted by some circles in [LOC Iran  ] as a virtual defeat. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Given this context , the [LOC Turks  ] had asked [PER Ahmadinejad  ] if the core of the issue is psychological rather than substance . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] had said " yes , " that the [MISC Iranians  ] agree to the proposal but need to manage the public perception . 
Accordingly , the [MISC Iranians  ] are proposing that the first 400 kilos be transferred to [LOC Kish Island  ] -- thereby keeping it on [MISC Iranian  ] soil -- and would receive right away an equivalent amount ( 30-50 kilos ) of enriched fuel . 
The second stage would focus on the management of [MISC Iranian  ] public opinion , after which [LOC Tehran  ] would proceed with the [LOC Turkey  ] option for the remaining 800 kilos , probably in two tranches . 
[PER Davutoglu  ] said [PER Baradei  ] agreed to consider this. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Davutoglu  ] noted that he had spoken to [ORG NSA General Jones Wednesday  ] , who had said that we should perhaps suggest to the [MISC Iranians  ] that they transfer 600 kilos to [LOC Kish Island  ] and 600 kilos to [LOC Turkey  ] simultaneously . 
A/S [PER Gordon  ] said he could not give an official response to the proposal as this is the first time we heard it , but that he anticipates much skepticism about providing fuel to [LOC Iran  ] before all the [ORG LEU  ] has been taken out . 
It would be better to get all 1200 kilos out right away. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Davutoglu  ] noted that these are two different proposals . 
The first is [LOC Iran  ] 's request for fuel for its nuclear reactor . 
Even if this takes place , he said , we still need to work on limiting [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear enrichment capability . 
If we succeed with this proposal , he said , it will create " confidence " and a " new momentum " and would allow room for negotiation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Noting that [PER Davutoglu  ] had only addressed the negative consequences of sanctions or the use of military force , [PER Gordon  ] pressed [PER Davutoglu  ] on [LOC Ankara  ] 's assessment of the consequences if [LOC Iran  ] gets a nuclear weapon . 
[PER Davutoglu  ] gave a spirited reply , that " of course " [LOC Turkey  ] was aware of this risk . 
This is precisely why [LOC Turkey  ] is working so hard with the [MISC Iranians  ] . 
President Gul himself had spent two hours Sunday with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] in [LOC Istanbul.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Gordon  ] noted that while we acknowledge that [LOC Turkey  ] can be helpful as a mediator , some of the Prime Minister 's recent public comments raise questions about how [LOC Turkey  ] sees this issue . 
[PER Davutoglu  ] said he is aware of these concerns , but contended that the [MISC Guardian  ] newspaper had not accurately presented its recent interview with the Prime Minister . 
The PM 's comments had been taken out of context . 
[PER Erdogan  ] had been asked if he views [LOC Iran  ] as a friend . 
If he had said " no , " it would not have been possible to convince [LOC Tehran  ] to cooperate on this latest proposal . 
Only [LOC Turkey  ] can speak bluntly and critically to the [MISC Iranians  ] , [PER Davutoglu  ] contended , but only because [LOC Ankara  ] is showing public messages of friendship. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Gordon  ] pushed back that [LOC Ankara  ] should give a stern public message about the consequences if [ORG UN  ] resolutions are ignored . 
[PER Davutoglu  ] countered that [PER Erdogan  ] had given just such a statement in [LOC Tehran  ] when he visited . 
He emphasized that [LOC Turkey  ] 's foreign policy is giving a " sense of justice " and a " sense of vision " to the region . 
[LOC Turkey  ] has provided a " third option " in addition to [LOC Iran  ] and the [MISC Saudis  ] ( who he contended are viewed as " puppets " of the [LOC US  ] ) . 
The result , he said , is that we " limit [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region . 
" We [ORG ANKARA  ] 00001654 002 OF 002 need a " pro-Western approach AND a sense of justice . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Gordon  ] has cleared this cable .
