09 THE HAGUE 759 Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Edwin R. Nolan  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The most immediate result of the February 20 collapse of the [MISC Dutch  ] government ( reftel B ) is the absence of a cabinet decision on post-2010 commitments to ISAF/Afghanistan . 
In that absence , the default position , withdrawal of [ORG Task Force  ] Uruzgan by December 2010 , stands . 
It will likely be mid-March before the scope of authority of the interim " " caretaker " " government is known . 
At best , it will have limited decision-making capability on existing mandates regarding [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This will compel [MISC Dutch  ] forces to redeploy from [LOC Uruzgan  ] beginning in August 2010 . 
While there may be political support for some commitment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , there is no possibility of an extension as lead nation of [ORG Task Force  ] Uruzgan . 
The earliest possible designation of a follow-on lead of [ORG Task Force  ] Uruzgan will provide the [MISC Dutch  ] a partner for developing realistic joint capabilities . 
Post recommends giving the [MISC Dutch  ] time and political space to develop consensus on their way ahead in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We will look for opportunities over the coming weeks to discreetly express our hopes for continued meaningful [MISC Dutch  ] military involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , we need to remain cognizant of the fact that , although the caretaker government favors an [LOC Uruzgan  ] extension , it is a minority government with highly limited authority . 
We must be highly circumspect in becoming involved in what could be an emotional election issue in the coming months leading up to the June 9 parliamentary election . 
END SUMMARY . 
TOO SOON TO CALL " " NO DECISION " " ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) It is too soon to assume there will be a government decision on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , in part or in total , that will result in a continued significant [MISC Dutch  ] commitment . 
There has been [MISC Christian Democrat  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) /PM [ORG Balkenende  ] political support for a commitment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with the only questions being types of missions , locations , and what , if any , troop levels . 
There is no/no majority support for a continuation of the mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , and public opinion is decidedly negative . 
On February 23 , the Queen accepted the resignation of all [ORG Labor Party  ] ministers and asked the Prime Minister to closely consult with parliament on &whether there is support for subjects that cannot bear delay.8 Once these consultations are complete , we will have more clarity on what types of decisions the caretaker government will be able to make . 
National parliamentary elections are scheduled for June 9 . 
The formation of a new coalition government likely will take between two and nine months thereafter . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet and parliament likely will prefer to put off some controversial decisions regarding ISAF/Afghanistan until after the new coalition government is formed . 
However , decisions on [LOC Afghanistan  ] will influence what coalition can be formed , as the coalition platform must be pre-agreed . 
Any continued [MISC Dutch  ] military mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] is virtually certain to be among those issues deferred , according to [PER Karl van Oosterom  ] , [ORG Senior Advisor  ] to the PM . 
Meanwhile , other [PER Qvan Oosterom  ] , [ORG Senior Advisor  ] to the PM . 
Meanwhile , other [LOC Afghanistan  ] issues might be included in the list of subjects that the Prime Minister and parliament agree &cannot bear delay8 and need to be decided earlier by the caretaker government . 
In that case , the caretaker government will need to secure an ad hoc majority in parliament on each issue . 
PARAMETERS OF EXPECTED COMMITMENTS ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Regardless of the fact that no decision has been taken , the realities of the [MISC Dutch  ] political landscape , coupled with the limitations of the [MISC Dutch  ] military , provides a narrow range of possibilities regarding a future commitment . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] can be expected to provide training through [ORG Operational Mentor  ] and [ORG Liaison Teams  ] ( [ORG OMLT  ] ) , Police Mentoring Teams ( [ORG PMT  ] ) , [MISC F-16  ] aircraft , intelligence elements , headquarters staff elements , and development funding . 
The commitment of assets to [LOC Uruzgan  ] province , re-deployment of THE HAGUE 00000114 002 OF 002 the [ORG Provisional Reconstruction Team  ] ( [ORG PRT  ] ) to another province , or a significant commitment of troops ( 400 to 700 ) to another mission will be the focus of the post-2010 decision . 
Although there has been support from opposition parties to keep the [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] with enablers and force protection , there has not been support to extend as lead nation of the [ORG Task Force  ] , nor to extend a commitment for a battle group . 
And , during the pre-election campaign period , previous expressions of support could be modified or limited . 
At best , there is a possibility , albeit slim , the [MISC Dutch  ] will keep their [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] with a significant force protection element of approximately 500 troops . 
[PER Karel van Oosterom  ] , [ORG Senior Advisor  ] to the Prime Minister , told the DCM February 20 that senior officials will be making " " discreet contacts " " with the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG NATO  ] on viable options that can demonstrate a strong [MISC Dutch  ] commitment to ISAF/Afghanistan . 
PRACTICALITIES OF CURRENT MANDATE --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] military will carry out their mission in accordance with the current mandate . 
Although there is some ambiguity , the mandate calls for the re-deployment of [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] beginning August 1 , 2010 , with completion by December 1 . 
The [ORG Head of Team Uruzgan  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] told [ORG POLMILOFF  ] February 23 that although the military has well-laid plans for re-deployment , the Chief of Defense ( [ORG CHOD  ] ) has indicated he is well aware of the fluidity of the current situation and can adjust at any time to comply with a change in tasking . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) COMMENT: The state of play within the [MISC Dutch  ] government will be unpredictable in the near term , with consultations between the caretaker government and parliament culminating in an agreed-upon scope of authority for the interim government . 
Post believes it best to wait for these initial decisions before speculating on future [MISC Dutch  ] commitments to ISAF/Afghanistan and recommending specific courses of actions that may be irrelevant or unhelpful if taken too soon . 
Post emphasizes that it will be virtually impossible to solicit a [MISC Dutch  ] commitment to extend their lead of [ORG Task Force  ] [LOC Uruzgan  ] beyond the current mandate . 
The earlier a [ORG Task Force  ] [LOC Uruzgan  ] lead nation successor is announced , the greater the likelihood of obtaining any substantial commitment by the [MISC Dutch  ] to partner in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Nonetheless , we must caution against any optimism that a [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] can be expected . 
With a caretaker government in place consisting of only [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) and [ORG Christian Union  ] ( [ORG CU  ] ) Ministers , official voices are likely to be telling us what we want to hear . 
If in fact the June elections enable a new center-right coalition to be formed under PM [ORG Balkenende  ] , new opportunities may open . 
However , a [ORG Labor  ] party victory with some type of center-left coalition minus [ORG Balkenende  ] , or even a broad centrist coalition , is likely to allow only very modest [MISC Dutch  ] contributions . 
Accordingly , we believe , it would be ill-advised for [ORG NATO  ] planning to count on any [MISC Dutch  ] military presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] beyond December 2010 . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The re-election of [ORG Balkenende  ] as [ORG CDA  ] party leader ( in hope of a [MISC Qre-election  ] of [ORG Balkenende  ] as [ORG CDA  ] party leader ( in hope of a continuation of him as Prime Minister ) has been viewed by some political observers as compromising the [ORG CDA  ] 's prospects in the upcoming Parliamentary election End Note ) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) For the immediate future , the [MISC Dutch  ] should be given time and political space to develop a consensus on [LOC Afghanistan  ] in this new environment . 
We should also refrain from commenting publicly , unless asked to do so by the [MISC Dutch  ] themselves . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are intensely sensitive to perceptions of outside meddling , and we must be discreet but clear in approaching the interim government as well as relevant political parties that will likely play a role in the future government . 
We should be cautious that our approach does not provide fodder for more radical elements of the [MISC Dutch  ] political scene , but we will actively engage across the political spectrum for continued meaningful [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
END COMMENT .
