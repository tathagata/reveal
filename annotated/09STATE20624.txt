( U ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph 4. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Background . 
The [LOC United States  ] has information indicating that in October 2008 , [MISC Iranian  ] businessman [PER Hamid Reihani  ] established himself as a dealer for the [MISC Dutch  ] gas turbine engine manufacturer AMT [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
We also understand that in November 2008 , AMT [LOC Netherlands  ] shipped [MISC Titan  ] unmanned aerial vehicle ( [ORG UAV  ] ) engines and [MISC Pegasus  ] engines to [PER Reihani  ] - possibly via a [PER Reihani  ] associate in the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] . 
Shipping documents may have identified the engines as model aircraft parts . 
Although we do not have any information on the identity of the end-user , [PER Reihani  ] has previous associations with individuals affiliated with the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG UAV  ] entity Qods Aviation ( or [ORG Aeronautics ) Industries  ] , an entity designated under [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] 1747 for its association with [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard  ] Corps. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We want to urge [MISC Dutch  ] officials to investigate this information and take all appropriate measures to ensure that AMT [LOC Netherlands  ] is not acting as a supplier to [MISC Iranian  ] entities of proliferation concern. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Action request: Request Embassy The [ORG Hague  ] approach host government officials to deliver talking points/non-paper in paragraph 5 and report response . 
Talking points may also be provided as a non-paper. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Begin talking points/non-paper: ( [ORG SECRET//REL NETHERLANDS  ] ) -- We would like to alert you to a matter of proliferation concern and request your assistance in investigating this activity . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] has information indicating that in early October 2008 , the [MISC Iranian  ] businessman [PER Hamid Reihani  ] of [ORG Parilla Company Ltd.  ] became a dealer for the [MISC Dutch  ] gas turbine engine manufacturer AMT [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
-- We also understand that at that time , an associate of AMT [LOC Netherlands  ] provided [PER Reihani  ] with price quotes for a number of items , including [MISC Titan  ] unmanned aerial vehicle ( [ORG UAV  ] ) engines , as well as [ORG Pegasus  ] and [MISC Olympus  ] engines . 
-- Our information further indicates that AMT [LOC Netherlands  ] shipped [MISC Pegasus  ] and [MISC Titan  ] engines to [PER Reihani  ] during November 2008 - possibly via a [PER Reihani  ] associate in the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] - and that the engines may have been identified on shipping documents as model aircraft parts . 
-- Although the end-users for these engines were not identified , we are concerned that [PER Reihani  ] could act as a supplier to [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG UAV  ] entities , as [PER Reihani  ] has previous associations with individuals either affiliated or involved with Qods Aviation ( or [ORG Aeronautics ) Industries  ] . 
-- [ORG Qods Aeronautics Industries  ] is an entity designated under [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolution  ] 1747 for its association with the [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] . 
-- We therefore hope you will investigate this activity and use all available measures to ensure that AMT [LOC Netherlands  ] is not acting as a supplier to entities of proliferation concern . 
-- We look forward to continued cooperation on nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your government takes in response to this information. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
