Summary ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since 2003 , prominent foreign security companies such as Control Risks , Aegis , and [ORG Olive Group  ] have been a familiar and prominent presence in [LOC Basrah  ] . 
Their armored convoys and heavily armed western security guards protect and escort foreign companies and foreign government clients to appointments and site visits . 
Many , if not all , international oil companies ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) employ them . 
However , the composition and bottom line of many security firms are changing due to improved security , greater competition , an increasing [MISC Iraqi  ] workforce , and the [ORG GOI  ] and public’s desire to see fewer armed westerners on their streets . 
While some [ORG IOCs  ] complain of exorbitant charges for protection , security firms claim that [LOC Basrah  ] still remains a potentially dangerous place . 
These firms will likely continue to increase their [MISC Iraqi  ] workforce , recognizing locals’ greater familiarity with the culture , language , and terrain , reinforced by the better reception they enjoy with the populace , police , army and [ORG GOI  ] . 
End summary . 
Foreign security companies in [LOC Basrah  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Foreign security companies with their armored convoys and heavily armed western security guards have been part of the landscape of [LOC Basrah  ] since 2003 . 
These firms escort and assist foreign company and foreign government clients to appointments and site visits . 
Many , if not all , [ORG IOCs  ] employ them as well . 
Firms like Control Risks , Aegis , [ORG Olive Group  ] , and [MISC BritAm  ] dominate the sector. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some firms also offer more comprehensive services , including business intelligence , geopolitical risk management , crisis management , and kidnap/ransom strategies . 
Typical services in [LOC Basrah  ] include armed escort to oil fields , downtown [LOC Basrah  ] , or remote construction sites . 
Most firms boast of employees with military or Special Forces background , and/or energy or engineering expertise . 
Prices for specific services are hard to gauge , dependent as they are on the number of people assisted , visit location , length of contract , and other services provided. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to our contacts , however , they do not come cheap: to escort a single executive for a four-hour , roundtrip from COB [LOC Basrah  ] to [ORG South Oil Company  ] costs around [MISC USD  ] 6,000 . 
( Note: A typical trip would include four security agents , drivers , and three or four armored vehicles . 
End note . 
) A day trip to the Port of [LOC Umm Qasr  ] and back for two engineers could cost around [MISC USD  ] 12,000 . 
A recent visit by a member of the [ORG Council of Representatives  ] from [LOC Baghdad  ] to [LOC Basrah  ] and back ran about [MISC USD  ] 12,000 . 
According to several local security representatives , however , costs for such services are beginning to fall , largely due to lessening security risks , the use of more local staff , and increased competition . 
( Note: The [ORG PRT  ] has no method for verifying this assessment . 
End note . 
) Improved security , preference for [MISC Iraqi  ] workers forcing changes --------------------------------------------- ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The composition of the workforce of many security companies is beginning to change , and will likely change more soon . 
There are several reasons for the shift . 
The first is improved security . 
Although no one is suggesting that security companies are no longer needed , security improvements have made it possible for maneuvers to occur with slightly less staff , vehicles , and weapons . 
They can also employ more local staff . 
All of these changes translate into lower operational and customer costs . 
The [MISC GOI’s  ] and the public’s strong desire to see fewer foreign guards carrying guns is also a driving factor . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] is anxious to “get rid of all the white faces carrying guns” in their streets . 
Many local security company reps openly acknowledge that a more “Iraqi face” is safer as well , as it draws less attention. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) It appears that this sentiment has increased in the wake of the [LOC Blackwater  ] verdict in the [LOC United States  ] ( refs A , B ) and recent [ORG GOI  ] actions could point to an even more aggressive stance against these companies . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] on January 12 , a [ORG China National Petroleum Company  ] ( [ORG CNPC  ] ) security team was stopped in [LOC Basrah  ] city by the [MISC Iraqi  ] police in a “clear attempt to disrupt and cause panic to the clients.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [MISC Iraqi  ] police stopped the convoy and showed a letter from the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) stating that as of January 12 , personal security teams now faced a more restrictive weapons regime . 
The situation was eventually resolved , and the convoy [ORG BASRAH  ] 00000001 002.2 OF 003 was released , but [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that this episode could presage a more restrictive posture towards security firms “in retaliation for the [LOC Blackwater  ] verdict.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that on January 13 , still another [ORG MOI  ] directive had instructed that all security companies ( including those working for the [ORG USG  ] ) are required to resubmit all company , employee , weapons and vehicle information to the [ORG MOI  ] , as if they were applying for a new license . 
( Note: PRT is seeking more details about these allegedly new policies . 
End note . 
) Security firms getting an [MISC Iraqi  ] face ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most , if not all , of these security firms are already [MISC Iraqi-licensed  ] companies . 
( Note: While legally they may be [MISC Iraqi  ] firms , they are still managed by expats , usually [MISC British  ] nationals . 
End note . 
) These firms were once largely staffed by expats from the [LOC U.K.  ] or [LOC U.S.  ] Most of them today have between 70 to 80 per cent local staff . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] country managerXXXXXXXXXXXX said that currently most [MISC Iraqi  ] employees are drivers or junior security guards . 
In the near future , he wants to see them move into full management . 
Many of the current expat managers and trainers would move into the background areas of training and management . 
The PRT also expects that new local security companies will be formed . 
Some [ORG IOCs  ] complain of high prices ; exaggerated threat --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Several [ORG IOC  ] representatives have complained of what they contend are unwarranted high prices especially given the vastly improved security situation since 2008 . 
The security firms justify their steep charges by insisting that their own costs - purchase and import of armored cars and weapons , highly skilled professionals - necessitate the pricing . 
[ORG Halliburton  ] [LOC Iraq  ] country manager decried a “mafia” of these companies and their “outrageous” prices , and said that they also exaggerate the security threat . 
Apart from the high costs for routine trips , he claimed that [ORG Halliburton  ] often receives what he says are “questionable” reports of vulnerability of employees to kidnapping and ransom . 
He said that he recently saw an internal memo from their security company which tasked its employees to emphasize the persistent danger faced by [ORG IOCs  ] . 
PRT Econoffs have heard that [ORG Halliburton  ] , [ORG Shell  ] , and [ORG BP  ] , among others , are evaluating their options regarding security firms , with an eye towards finding cheaper alternatives . 
Companies claim that high risk is still present --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Security firms openly acknowledge the improved security situation , but claim that [LOC Basrah  ] remains a dangerous place . 
Firms often highlight recent IDFs , VBEIDs , or other attacks . 
( Comment: These companies also appear to be very plugged into the latest security incidents . 
It is unclear where they get their information . 
End comment . 
) At a recent dinner attended by representatives from [MISC France-based  ] Total oil company and [ORG Control Risks  ] , a starkly divergent picture of the [LOC Basrah  ] security situation emerged . 
Several Total employees , veterans of the local scene and evidently well-briefed on current security issues , opined that they felt comfortable in downtown [LOC Basrah  ] . 
[ORG Control Risk  ] reps disagreed sharply citing the still-present “extremely dangerous” threats of kidnappings and armed attacks . 
They said it would be “years” before western businesspeople , let alone tourists , could walk the streets of [LOC Basrah  ] with any reasonable feeling of safety. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Reconciling these views is not easy . 
While security is clearly better , there is no guarantee this trend will continue . 
Corporate boards are often very conservative about security and often insist their employees retain security firms . 
Governments can be similarly risk adverse . 
Two expat port consultants working for the [MISC Japanese  ] aid agency ( [ORG JICA  ] ) told PRT EconOff that [ORG JICA  ] policy mandates they travel with internationally known security firms . 
With security improved , market forces at work more --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As security continues to improve and pressure increases for security firms to have more of an “Iraqi face , ” market forces could play a bigger role . 
[ORG IOCs  ] , faced with tight contractual margins , are reviewing the high costs for security . 
Improved security could translate into a less manpower and equipment . 
Increased competition and more local employees could translate into lower costs and pricing . 
According to [ORG Olive Security  ] and [ORG G4S  ] , charges have decreased over the last 18 months . 
They note that some of the more profitable security contracts tendered by the [LOC US  ] and [LOC UK  ] military in the past have disappeared or will do so soon . 
They claim that newer contracts with [ORG IOCs  ] are not as generous . 
[MISC Italy-based  ] oil company ENI’s contract with Aegis is “much less” costly than that Aegis’s [ORG BASRAH  ] 00000001 003.2 OF 003 current contract with the [ORG US Army Corps of Engineers  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With improved security and absent a major upsurge in violence , security companies will likely become ever more [MISC Iraqi  ] both in legal terms and number of workers . 
This shift could provide more jobs and give local security firms and employees valuable expertise . 
The lower cost of increasingly [MISC Iraqi  ] security will also help the bottom lines of [ORG IOCs  ] . 
For their part , security companies recognize the many advantages of hiring well-vetted local employees with greater familiarity with [MISC Iraqi  ] culture , language , terrain , and people . 
The better reception they enjoy with the populace , police , army , and government may pay dividends as well . 
End comment. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RSO Baghdad  ] Comment: [ORG RSO  ] believes that although security in [LOC Basrah  ] appears to have improved , the environment should be regarded with cautious optimism and judgment reserved to observe the overall security environment after the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It is too early to be able to gauge whether the security environment in [LOC Iraq  ] will allow effective employment of local nationals as members of [ORG Protective Security  ] teams supporting private industry activities . 
[ORG RSO  ] understands the value of employing local nationals to support the [ORG Protective Security  ] effort . 
Presently , an effort is in place to train [MISC Iraqi  ] Police to work with [ORG RSO Protective Security Details  ] , and RSO’s current employment of them is judicious and strictly controlled . 
[ORG RSO  ] believes that building a labor pool of well-vetted local employees in Iraq’s current environment is difficult . 
[ORG RSO  ] efforts to vet local nationals for employment is labor intensive , often subjective and many times proves to be too difficult for many local national employees to complete successfully . 
Additionally , USG efforts to train local nationals in [ORG Protective Security  ] tradecraft to ensure technical proficiency appears to be intensive in labor and time required , with mixed results .
