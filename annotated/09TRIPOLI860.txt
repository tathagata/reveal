( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Reform-minded [MISC Libyans  ] are " cautiously hopeful " regarding the recent appointment of [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi as " General Coordinator . 
" While [PER Saif  ] al-Islam is widely seen as a reformer , embassy contacts note that he will face continued resistance from the [MISC Libyan  ] old guard . 
Some observers believe that the appointment was meant to give the regime a " new lease on life " and counter subtle yet growing voices of opposition , particularly with respect to corruption . 
Given that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam was out of the country when the appointment was made , the meaning of his new position will only start to become clear when he returns to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) xxxxxxxxxxx , told Pol/Econ Chief October 22 that he and xxxxxxxxxxxx were " cautiously hopeful " about [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's October 6 appointment as " General Coordinator of Social and [ORG Popular Committees  ] . 
" He said that [PER Saif  ] was widely known to be a reformer within [LOC Libya  ] but had often encountered resistance from the old guard [ORG Revolutionary Committee  ] ( [ORG RevComm  ] ) leaders when proposing drastic changes to the government structure , such as the drafting of a constitution or calls to scale back [ORG RevComm  ] influence on government administration . 
He will undoubtedly encounter the same resistance in his new role , according to xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
" He has a lot of good ideas , but he has been too outspoken about them in the past , " xxxxxxxxxxxx commented . 
Echoing the warning of other embassy contacts , xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that [PER Saif  ] 's position would only be effective if empowered with the authority to make decisions and act on them. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While the exact responsibilities of [PER Saif  ] 's new position are unclear , xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted that the move provided the [MISC Qadhafi  ] regime a " new lease on life " by introducing a person widely considered to be reform minded - both by local and foreign observers - into the system. xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that the regime was stagnating and that voices of opposition were subtly rising across the country , particularly from the poorer , eastern areas . 
" The people see what the rest of the world has and know that the country is wealthy , but they do not see any of the wealth . 
They wonder where it goes . 
" A young [MISC Libyan  ] businessman and son of xxxxxxxxxxxx , echoed this refrain , telling us that " Brother [PER Saif  ] will solve these problems of corruption . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that the younger generations are particularly frustrated with their country 's slow economic development and lack of employment opportunities , estimating unemployment at 30 percent. xxxxxxxxxxxx believes the regime is concerned about this frustration exploding into violence . 
With [PER Saif  ] at the top , xxxxxxxxxxxx reasoned , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi thinks he will fool people into believing that real change is taking place . 
Meanwhile , he still has a few more years to control [LOC Libya  ] from behind the scenes. xxxxxxxxxxxx fears that the official role will also constrain [PER Saif  ] , who had been relatively free to act and speak out in favor of reform in his nominally " non-governmental " position as Chairman of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: In true [MISC Qadhafi  ] fashion , his latest political move has local observers guessing about what practical effect the announcement will have on the [MISC Libyan  ] government and people . 
Given that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam was out of the country when this appointment was made , the meaning of his new position will likely only start to become clear when he returns to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
And given the backdrop of political apathy in [LOC Libya  ] , ordinary citizens are unlikely to react to the news until they begin to see real change in their daily lives . 
Many observers here believe that [PER Saif  ] 's visible role in the return and welcome given to convicted [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi was one of the necessary steps the [MISC Qadhafi  ] clan had to take to enable the Leader to elevate [PER Saif  ] to this new position .
