( C ) [ORG Summary: Diplomatic  ] missions in [LOC Delhi  ] have agreed to offer a more sympathetic message to the [MISC Indians  ] rather than pound on the government for its massive intelligence failure . 
Evidence that [MISC Pakistani-based  ] extremist group [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] ( LeT ) was the culprit is still not out in the open , although the question being asked now is whether [ORG Pakistan’s Intelligence Agency  ] , the [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) was directly involved in the attack . 
Dipomatic missions in [LOC Delhi  ] are praising [LOC Delhi  ] for its restraint while advising [LOC Pakistan  ] that now is the time to collaborate . 
End Summary . 
Offering Only Sympathy and Support ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At a 2 December meeting with counterparts from the [MISC Australian  ] , [MISC British  ] , [MISC Canadian  ] , and [LOC New Zealand  ] High Commissions , these diplomats communicated details of the controlled approach their respective missions in [LOC Delhi  ] have taken in their responses to India’s reaction to the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
They concluded that any offers of assistance should be made carefully to avoid being interpreted by the [MISC Indians  ] as politically motivated or attempts to monitor their actions . 
Delhi-based missions are taking extra care at this stage to not get sucked into the blame game [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC India  ] are currently playing. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] ( diplomatic mission heads ) are scheduled for a strategic dialogue with [LOC India  ] on 5 December to discuss what type of support [LOC India  ] would feel comfortable receiving ; in addition , the [ORG EU  ] plans to send to [LOC Delhi  ] a counter-terrorism coordinator in January. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] Ambassador , according to the [MISC British  ] High [ORG Commission  ] , called the [MISC French  ] , [MISC German  ] , and [MISC Italian  ] Ambassadors ( unbeknownst to other [ORG EU  ] partners ) to discuss assistance to the [MISC Indians  ] . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] is expected to call Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] to express his sympathy and to offer cooperation at a suitable level. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Australian  ] Prime Minister in his speech to his parliament said [LOC Australia  ] “stands with [LOC India  ] at this time” and offered any assistance that their “friends” in New [LOC Delhi  ] may require . 
He stressed the importance of tracking down those responsible for the planning and execution of the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks , singling out LeT as an separatist militant group which has been a threat to [LOC India  ] for a long time , but saying it is too early to speculate on who the perpetrators were . 
The [MISC Million Dollar Question  ] --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) While [MISC Indian  ] press continues to pin blame on [LOC Pakistan  ] , observers and diplomats in [LOC Delhi  ] are asking the same question: was the [ORG ISI  ] behind the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks ? 
While there are clear links between the attacks’ perpetrators and the extremist group LeT , and likewise , there are links between LeT and the [ORG ISI  ] , there is no clear evidence yet to suggest that [ORG ISI  ] directed or facilitated the attacks , according to the [MISC British  ] High [ORG Commission  ] . 
Demarching the [MISC Indians  ] and [MISC Pakistanis  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A [MISC British  ] diplomat told us that [ORG UK Foreign Secretary  ] Miliband urged restraint to External Affairs Minister NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 00003044 002 OF 002 [PER Mukherjee  ] when they spoke on 1 December . 
The call took place only after many delays on the [MISC GOI’s  ] part . 
[PER Mukherjee  ] apparently disavowed any interest in raising tensions further , but insisted that [LOC Pakistan  ] must take action in response to [LOC India  ] , s demands . 
Our contact stressed that the [LOC UK  ] had been very direct in presenting [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] with specific information regarding those responsible for the attacks . 
She also noted that the list of names the [MISC Indians  ] had put on the “Most Wanted Criminals List” that had been passed to [LOC Islamabad  ] included figures such as fugitive crime lord [PER Dawood Ibrahim  ] and Jaish-e-Mohammed Chief [PER Maulana Azhar  ] , who had been on prior lists the [MISC Indians  ] had submitted . 
In her view , this took away from the focus on LeT members implicated in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Narayanan  ] , according to [MISC British  ] diplomats , delivered the message that he understands [ORG Pakistan’s  ] civilian government has no control over the [ORG ISI  ] or the army . 
He said [LOC India  ] is not blaming the [MISC Pakistani  ] government . 
The [MISC Indian  ] Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still waiting on the [MISC Pakistanis  ] to provide the name of the [ORG ISI  ] Director they plan to send as well as a date. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Australian  ] High [ORG Commission  ] delivered the message to the [MISC Pakistanis  ] that this is a watershed and cooperation with the [MISC Indians  ] now is crucial . 
The [MISC Australians  ] have praised the [MISC Indians  ] for the past restraint they have shown toward [LOC Pakistan  ] and offered assistance , which was “politely denied” , according to an [MISC Australian  ] diplomat . 
[PER Zardari Cornered  ] ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) An official in the [MISC Pakistani  ] High [ORG Commission  ] in [LOC Delhi  ] told [LOC Poloff  ] that he held the [MISC Indian  ] press responsible for any deterioration in the [MISC Indo-Pak  ] relationship . 
Following the [MISC Indian  ] press coverage which misrepresented the potential visit of the [ORG ISI  ] Chief and complicated potential cooperation between the two governments , this diplomat said [ORG Zardari’s  ] options became more limited and the [MISC GOP  ] felt it had no other choice than to backpedal on its initial offer , made before the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks , to send its [ORG ISI  ] Chief to [LOC India  ] .
