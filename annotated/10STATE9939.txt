SHEAR , REASON: 1.4 ( C ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
[ORG Embassy Beijing  ] , please see paragraph 3. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Background/Objective: The [LOC U.S.  ] has information indicating that in December 2009 , the [MISC Chinese  ] company [LOC Hong Kong  ] 4 [ORG Star Electronics Ltd.  ] offered to sell gyroscopes produced by a [MISC Russian  ] company to [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Isfahan Optics Industries  ] . 
Our information indicates that these gyroscopes could be delivered to [LOC Iran  ] in early February 2010 and that [ORG Isfahan Optics Industries  ] was coordinating this transaction through an intermediary named [ORG Iran Business  ] ( [ORG IBco  ] ) . 
Because key missile development organizations in [LOC Iran  ] previously have attempted to procure similar gyroscopes , we are concerned this equipment potentially could be diverted to missile-related end-users . 
We therefore want to alert [MISC Chinese  ] officials to this information and ask that they investigate this activity with a view to preventing [LOC Hong Kong  ] 4 [ORG Star Electronics Ltd.  ] from facilitating missile-related exports to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Action Request: Request [ORG Embassy Beijing  ] approach appropriate host government officials to deliver talking points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response . 
Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Begin talking points/non-paper: ( [ORG SECRET//REL CHINA  ] ) --We would like to alert you to information of proliferation concern and request your government 's assistance in investigating this activity. --The [LOC U.S.  ] has information indicating that in December 2009 , [LOC Hong Kong  ] 4 [ORG Star Electronics Ltd.  ] , a [MISC Chinese  ] company based in [LOC Futian  ] , [LOC China  ] , had offered to sell [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG Isfahan Optics Industries  ] gyroscopes produced by a [MISC Russian  ] company. --Our information indicates that these gyroscopes could be delivered to [LOC Iran  ] in early February 2010 and that [ORG Isfahan Optics Industries  ] was coordinating this transaction through an intermediary named [ORG Iran Business  ] ( [ORG IBco  ] ) . --We are bringing this matter to your attention to support your export control efforts as we are concerned this equipment potentially could be diverted to missile-related end-users in [LOC Iran.  ] --We understand that the [ORG Aerospace Industries Organization  ] ( [ORG AIO  ] ) , which is responsible for overseeing all of [LOC Iran  ] 's missile programs , has previously attempted to procure similar gyroscopes. --We hope you will use this information to investigate this activity and take all appropriate measures to ensure that [LOC Hong Kong  ] 4 [ORG Star Electronics Ltd.  ] is not facilitating unauthorized exports of missile technology to [LOC Iran.  ] --We believe taking such action would be consistent with [ORG United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737  ] and 1803 , which require countries to prevent transfers of items to and from [LOC Iran  ] that could contribute to the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems. --We look forward to continued cooperation on missile nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your government takes in response to this information .
