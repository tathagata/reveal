[ORG MGM  ] raised the aborted [MISC Putin-Chirac  ] dinner on the margins of the [ORG NATO  ] Riga Summit , saying it had been instigated by [LOC Russia  ] , and portrayed [LOC France  ] as having attempted to steer in a way compatible with [MISC Latvian  ] interests . 
In contrast to [MISC French  ] Political Director [PER Araud  ] ( septel ) , he showed reluctance to see the [MISC Kremlin’s  ] hand in the [PER Litvinenko  ] poisoning , preferring to ascribe it to rogue elements . 
[ORG MGM  ] claimed to support [MISC Georgian  ] independence while suggesting that [ORG NATO  ] Article 5 obligations precluded [MISC Georgian  ] [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
On [LOC Kosovo  ] , he reviewed [MISC France’s  ] plans to persuade the [ORG EU  ] to agree to offer [LOC Serbia  ] an [ORG SAA  ] agreement not linked to fulfillment of its [ORG ICTY  ] obligations but worried above all about Putin’s explicit threat to veto a [ORG UN Security Resolution  ] mandating independence ; there was a risk of instability and partition if the [LOC West  ] did not exercise sufficient care in managing the [MISC Russians  ] . 
[PER Fried  ] countered that the [LOC West  ] needed to be prepared to proceed in extremis without the [MISC Russians  ] , and warned against allowing the [MISC Russians  ] to hold up a decision through the threat of a veto. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMARY CONT: On other issues , [ORG MGM  ] reviewed the [MISC Franco-German  ] proposal for a review of Turkey’s implementation of its [ORG Ankara Protocol  ] commitments between 2007 and 2009 , assured [PER Fried  ] that [LOC France  ] wanted to avoid a train wreck , but insisted it was incumbent on the [LOC Turks  ] to make a gesture . 
[PER Fried  ] reminded [ORG MGM  ] of the strategic importance of keeping [LOC Turkey  ] tied to [ORG EU  ] ; [ORG MGM  ] agreed in principle but insisted [LOC Turkey  ] had to play by the EU’s rules and noted the difficulties of managing domestically public sentiment against [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[PER Fried  ] and [ORG MGM  ] agreed that [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] had worked well together at the [ORG NATO  ] Riga Summit . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG EUR A/S  ] [PER Daniel Fried  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador and POL Deputy ( notetaker ) , met December 7 with President Chirac’s diplomatic advisor ( NSA-equivalent ) [PER Maurice Gourdault-Montagne  ] ( [ORG MGM  ] ) to discuss a number of [MISC European  ] issues that revolved largely around [LOC Russia  ] . 
[ORG MGM  ] was joined by [ORG Presidency Middle East  ] advisor [PER Dominique Boche  ] and strategic affairs advisor [PER Laurent Bili  ] . 
[MISC Putin-Chirac  ] at [LOC Riga  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Noting at the outset that he had been directly involved in the aborted [MISC Putin-Chirac  ] dinner on the margins of the [ORG NATO  ] summit , [ORG MGM  ] assured [PER Fried  ] that [MISC French  ] actions had been above board . 
[LOC Kremlin  ] advisor [ORG Pridhodko  ] had originally proposed that [PER Putin  ] meet [MISC Chirac  ] privately at a [LOC Paris  ] airport November 29 in order to express his birthday wishes ( [ORG MGM  ] cited Putin’s meeting in [LOC Hannover  ] with former [PER Chancellor Schroeder  ] as a precedent ) . 
[LOC France  ] had agreed , while noting that the dates coincided with the [ORG Riga Summit  ] . 
[ORG Pridhodko  ] suggested [LOC Riga  ] , which [LOC France  ] dutifully vetted with the [MISC Latvians  ] with the understanding that they would have to host such a dinner , and assuring the [MISC Latvians  ] that [LOC France  ] was prepared to say “no” to the [MISC Russians  ] if a meeting would in any way cause them embarrassment . 
The [MISC Latvians  ] were prepared to proceed , so long as the [MISC Russians  ] also agreed to a bilateral meeting , which [ORG MGM  ] conveyed to [ORG Pridhodko  ] . 
[ORG Pridhodko  ] had suggested that this could be “difficult” given negative [MISC Russian  ] public opinion toward [LOC Latvia  ] . 
The [MISC Latvians  ] told [ORG MGM  ] that the [MISC Russians  ] had refused to meet at the official palace or residence , but were considering the [MISC Latvian  ] cultural center . 
[ORG MGM  ] said he had encouraged the [MISC Russians  ] to accept the last offering , and they had proceeded as if it might be acceptable . 
Late Tuesday , however , they balked , apparently because the center was located about 200m from the [MISC Latvian  ] museum of occupation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG MGM  ] concluded his presentation with the argument that such a meeting would have been positive for [MISC Russian-Latvian  ] relations and would have helped to blur dividing lines between [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
He complained over Latvia’s going “public” with the cancellation by querying [ORG NATO  ] SYG Hoop de [PER Scheffer  ] as to whether “we are allowed to receive” the [MISC Russian  ] president . 
He commented that , had they remained silent , the cancellation would have been a non-event . 
[PER Fried  ] countered that the [MISC Latvians  ] had been right to inform [ORG NATO  ] and thus avoid a surprise . 
He contrasted the [MISC Russians’  ] clumsiness in managing the dinner with the [MISC Latvians’  ] transparency , suggesting that it was time for the [MISC Russians  ] to accept the independence of the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
He added pointedly that the [LOC U.S.  ] would no longer accept putative [MISC Russian  ] concerns about [MISC Latvian  ] treatment of their citizens at a time when they were still rounding up [MISC Georgians  ] on the [LOC PARIS  ] 00007755 002 OF 003 basis of ethnicity . 
[ORG MGM  ] commented meekly that the timing had not been right for the visit and agreed that the [MISC Latvian  ] government no longer had a problem of non-citizen ethnic [MISC Russians  ] . 
[PER Litvinenko Case  ] --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Fried  ] commented that the short-term trend inside [LOC Russia  ] was negative , noting increasing indications that the [LOC UK  ] investigation into the murder of [PER Litvinenko  ] could well point to some sort of [MISC Russian  ] involvement . 
[ORG MGM  ] called attention to Chirac’s statement encouraging the [MISC Russians  ] to cooperate in the investigation . 
He wondered aloud who might have given the order , but speculated the murder probably involved a settling of accounts between services rather than occurring under direct order from the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
[PER Fried  ] , noting Putin’s attention to detail , questioned whether rogue security elements could operate , in the [LOC UK  ] no less , without Putin’s knowledge . 
Describing the current atmosphere as strange , he described the [MISC Russians  ] as increasingly self-confident , to the point of arrogance . 
[LOC Georgia-Russia  ] -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Fried  ] , noting he had discussed [LOC Georgia  ] the previous evening with MFA Political Director [PER Gerard Araud  ] ( septel ) , said it was important to support [MISC Georgian  ] sovereignty against [MISC Russian  ] pressure for three reasons: the situation overall in [LOC Georgia  ] was improving under [MISC Saakashvili’s  ] leadership ; violation of [MISC Georgian  ] territorial integrity would set a dangerous precedent ; and [LOC Germany  ] and [ORG Central  ] and [ORG Eastern Europe  ] had a strong interest in ensuring that gas and oil pumped from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Central Asia  ] did not travel exclusively through pipelines owned or controlled by [LOC Russia  ] . 
[ORG MGM  ] responded that [LOC France  ] supported [ORG Georgia’s  ] independence but wondered how to accomplish this within existing structures . 
The heart of [ORG NATO  ] was [ORG Article  ] 5 , and it was doubtful that [ORG NATO  ] would declare war on [LOC Russia  ] over [LOC Georgia  ] ; it was therefore important to bypass [ORG Article  ] 5 and find a “specific way” that did not involve [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
If [LOC Georgia  ] joins , [LOC Armenia  ] may follow . 
Even in the case of [LOC Turkey  ] , was its [MISC Kurdish  ] problem one for [MISC Europeans  ] , [ORG MGM  ] asked. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Fried  ] assured [ORG MGM  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not seeking membership for [LOC Georgia  ] soon , but it was important not to close the door in order to continue to promote [MISC Georgian  ] reform and development . 
It was incumbent on the [LOC West  ] to support [MISC Georgian  ] sovereignty and maintain a united front against [LOC Russia  ] , he argued . 
He related that he had urged [PER Saakashvili  ] not to seek crises with [LOC Russia  ] , since crisis worked only for [LOC Russia  ] , and time was on [ORG Georgia’s  ] side so long as it moved quietly . 
In five years , a burgeoning [MISC Georgian  ] economy had the potential to dramatically change the politics of the region . 
[ORG MGM  ] agreed in principle , but suggested one could differ on ways and means . 
[LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Fried  ] explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] had decided to offer PFP to [LOC Serbia  ] as a means of supporting democratic forces in the upcoming elections ; President Tadic had made a strong case for [MISC Serbia’s Euro-Atlantic  ] future . 
Similar considerations had prompted the [LOC U.S.  ] to support Ahtisaari’s recommendation to postpone tabling his proposals on [LOC Kosovo  ] status . 
But it was critical to move quickly after January 21 . 
Additional delay would encourage the [MISC Serbs  ] and others into thinking the [LOC West  ] felt intimidated ; it was time to push onward to supervised independence . 
[PER Fried  ] said that while [LOC Russia  ] could be expected to cause difficulties , in the end he believed it would abstain on a [LOC UNSCR  ] , although he could not be certain . 
What was certain was that the [MISC Russians  ] must not be allowed to believe that the threat of a veto will work , because they would exploit any opening . 
The [LOC West  ] therefore had to send the signal that it was prepared to move without them if necessary , because no signal would be interpreted as tacit acquiescence in [MISC Russia’s  ] raising the bar . 
This was a terrible option , but paralysis was worse. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG MGM  ] reviewed the history of [MISC French-Serbian  ] relations ( back to the [ORG Salonika Front  ] of [ORG WWI  ] , on which MGM’s grandfather had served ) , judged PFP as a positive offer , and said [PER Chirac  ] had proposed to [PER Merkel  ] that the [ORG EU  ] move to a Stabilization and [ORG Association Agreement  ] ( [ORG SAA  ] ) with [LOC Serbia  ] , even in the event of insufficient [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation . 
[PER Merkel  ] had initially responded negatively , citing Tadic’s failure to request it , but [LOC France  ] continued to believe that offering [ORG SAA  ] could make a difference in the January elections . 
If the [MISC Germans  ] were not on board by early January , [LOC France  ] would move on its own to propose [ORG SAA  ] . 
As for the [MISC Ahtisaari  ] proposals , [ORG MGM  ] said [PER Putin  ] had told the [MISC French  ] “Russia will not hesitate [LOC PARIS  ] 00007755 003 OF 003 to veto any solution that does not enjoy the agreement of all the stakeholders.” [ORG MGM  ] urged great caution in moving forward , citing Putin’s purported concerns about the risks of a partition and a merging of the north with [LOC Serbia  ] and the south with [LOC Albania  ] , leading potentially to a radicalized [MISC Muslim  ] state in the heart of [LOC Europe.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Fried  ] responded that the [MISC Serbs  ] and [MISC Albanians  ] had been told that [LOC Kosovo  ] would be independent , and that it would be a mistake to turn back . 
Perhaps the [MISC Russians  ] were bluffing , but even if they were not , wavering would lead to disaster , beginning with riots by Kosovars that risked turning [ORG KFOR  ] into an occupying force and could led to the very radicalization we had successfully avoided so far . 
[ORG MGM  ] said [LOC France  ] was not advocating further delay , but was nonetheless concerned that independence could have unintended consequences . 
Public opinion could change , and [LOC Russia  ] might become yet more irrational in the run-up to legislative and presidential elections . 
[PER Fried  ] agreed on the desirability of negotiating a [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] that would be acceptable to the [MISC Russians  ] -- perhaps even leaving out the word “independence” -- but the [LOC West  ] needed to be prepared in extremis to move forward without [MISC Russian  ] support . 
[LOC Russia  ] would seize on any paralysis to try to raise the bar . 
[ORG MGM  ] agreed in principle , but urged again finding ways to “coddle” [LOC Russia  ] . 
[MISC Turkey-EU  ] --------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) During a discussion cut short by a summons from President [PER Chirac  ] , [PER Fried  ] asked [ORG MGM  ] how [LOC France  ] planned to avoid a [MISC Turkey-EU  ] train wreck . 
[ORG MGM  ] said [LOC France  ] supported [LOC Turkey  ] , but [LOC Turkey  ] needed to play by [ORG EU  ] rules and fulfill its commitments . 
It was not the EU’s fault that the [ORG UN Cyprus  ] plan had not been approved by referendum , but this could not be used as an excuse for not implementing the [ORG Ankara Protocol  ] . 
It was critical that [LOC Turkey  ] “start to implement” the protocol through a gesture . 
[ORG MGM  ] said that [PER Chirac  ] and [PER Merkel  ] had agreed ( on the basis of the [ORG Commission  ] proposal ) not to open eight chapters and not to close any other chapters ; but they had also agreed to insist on a review of [MISC Turkish  ] implementation -- to serve as the basis for a further [ORG EU  ] decision -- in the time frame between a 2007 [ORG Commission  ] report and 2009 [MISC European  ] parliamentary elections . 
Although [MISC Erdogan  ] had told [PER Merkel  ] not to expect any further [MISC Turkish  ] gestures , [ORG MGM  ] nonetheless hoped the [LOC Turks  ] would find a way , as they had so often in the past , to do something at the last minute. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Fried  ] described the [LOC U.S.  ] approach of encouraging [LOC Turkey  ] to respond constructively , expressed the hope that the [ORG EU  ] would not be too one-sided in its judgment of the [ORG Ankara Protocol  ] implementation , but reminded [ORG MGM  ] that the [ORG EU  ] also had not followed through on its promises ( which [ORG MGM  ] hotly denied ) . 
[PER Fried  ] continued that the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to be helpful but was avoiding taking a public stance . 
He reiterated that the stakes were high , given Turkey’s strategic value. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) This message was cleared by [PER A/S Fried  ] .
