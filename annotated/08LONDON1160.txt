( C ) [PER Morrison  ] said the Home Secretary had been in discussions with [MISC Pakistani  ] officials during her April 13-14 visit to [LOC Pakistan  ] about what could be done to diminish the terror threat in the [LOC UK  ] . 
One idea which had been floated was for [MISC Pakistani  ] religious authorities to visit the [LOC UK  ] as part of [MISC HMG’s  ] ongoing program to bring visiting religious scholars to the [LOC UK  ] to promote moderate interpretations of [MISC Islam  ] ( in the Foreign Office-led speaking tour program known as “the Radical [LOC Middle Way.”  ] ) [PER Morrison  ] said the concept had been discussed in principle but that no firm commitments had been made and no individuals had been identified . 
In any case , if [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Imams  ] were to come to the [LOC UK  ] , “it would only be to visit , ” said [ORG Morrison.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Morrison  ] further clarified that it was not [MISC HMG’s  ] policy to import foreign [ORG Imams.  ] “To the contrary , ” said [PER Morrison  ] , [PER HMG  ] hopes to foster local [ORG Imams  ] “rooted in the community.” To this end , [PER HMG  ] has supported [MISC Muslim  ] communities’ own efforts to form an association ( the [MISC Mosques  ] and [ORG Imams Advisory Body aka MINAB  ] -- see reftel ) which would lead in the development and self-regulation of [MISC Mosques  ] in the [LOC United Kingdom  ] . 
[PER Morrison  ] added that the [ORG Home Office  ] looks to the [MISC Muslim  ] communities to lead on that effort as “it is not the government’s role to dictate to people how to practice their faith.” Visit London’s Classified Website: http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Unit ed_Kingdom TUTTLE</pre></code>
