END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC French  ] President [PER Nicholas Sarkozy  ] arrived in [LOC Riyadh  ] on January 13 for a one night/two day visit . 
This visit was a follow up to [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] bin [PER Abdulaziz Al Saud’s  ] visit to [LOC Paris  ] in June 2007 . 
Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] was accompanied by [MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] , Minister of [ORG Defense Hevre Morin  ] , Minister of Justice [PER Rachida Dati  ] , Minister of Culture [PER Christine Albanel  ] and Minister of Education [PER Valerie Pecresse  ] . 
[MISC French  ] [ORG DCM  ] in [LOC Riyadh  ] [PER Emmanuel Bonne  ] provided a private readout to Acting Pol Counselor of this visit .

Additionally , the main theme was to foster a stronger personal relationship between Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] and King [PER Abdullah  ] . 
Overall , King [PER Abdullah  ] emphasized multilateral solutions , vice bilateral approaches , regarding the multitude of issues discussed . 
Readouts from the [MISC French  ] and the press were positive , but our [MISC Saudi  ] contacts privately shared displeasure with certain [MISC French  ] conduct . 
[LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] reiterated his strong concern with [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear ambitions to King [PER Abdullah  ] , asserting sanctions were the best way to put pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Abdullah  ] reportedly does not want to inflame the situation and recommended continued international engagement ( [ORG P-5  ] plus [LOC Germany  ] ) with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He emphasized that [LOC Iran  ] must abide by its international obligations , specifically the [MISC Non-Proliferation  ] treaty . 
[PER Abdullah  ] reportedly concurred , noting [MISC Iran’s  ] destabilizing activities in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] , along with [MISC Saudi  ] belief that [MISC Iran’s  ] ultimate goal is to acquire nuclear weapons . 
However , the [MISC Saudis  ] are not yet ready to take any action beyond diplomacy at this point and assured their commitment to [MISC French  ] efforts for a diplomatic solution with [LOC Iran  ] . 
King [PER Abdullah  ] stated that [LOC Iran  ] knows its obligations and the next step is for the [MISC Iranians  ] to comply . 
The [MISC French  ] had hoped to make a joint communiqu on [LOC Iran  ] , but the [MISC Saudis  ] declined because they do not want to aggravate the [MISC Iranian  ] situation . 
[PER COMMENT: It  ] was not made clear just how the proposed communiqu would have aggravated [MISC Saudi-Iranian  ] relations . 
END COMMENT . 
MEPP ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Both Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] and King [PER Abdullah  ] agreed to support the [LOC Annapolis  ] initiative to resolve the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict . 
[PER Abdullah  ] told [PER Sarkozy  ] that the issue of [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees must first be resolved and that the [MISC Israelis  ] must cease all [LOC West Bank  ] settlement construction . 
[PER Abdullah  ] maintained that [LOC East Jerusalem  ] must be the capital of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state and that this section of [LOC Jerusalem  ] must be solely under [MISC Arab  ] control . 
The [MISC French  ] had hoped to issue a joint communiqu on the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] [LOC Peace Process  ] , but no consensus could be reached . 
[LOC SYRIA/LEBANON  ] ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The issue of [LOC Lebanon  ] was raised by Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
[PER Abdullah  ] cautioned that everyone should be very cautious in speaking with the [MISC Syrians  ] , implying their duplicity . 
He added the [MISC French  ] “should be firm” with [LOC Syria  ] in regards to [LOC RIYADH  ] 00000102 002 OF 003 [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
In a separate meeting between [MISC French  ] FM [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] and [MISC Saudi  ] FM Saud al [PER Faisal  ] , the [MISC French  ] supported the [MISC Arab  ] initiative on [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Saud added he was skeptical of the current [MISC Lebanese  ] political parties and doubted the [MISC Syrians  ] would comply with any accord . 
[LOC IRAQ  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Regarding [LOC Iraq  ] , both Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] and King [PER Abdullah  ] concurred that [MISC Iraq’s  ] security had dramatically improved since 2006 . 
[PER Abdullah  ] reportedly opined that [LOC Iraq  ] must remained a unified state , and that external players , such as [LOC Iran  ] , must be dissuaded from interfering . 
[MISC FRENCH-SAUDI  ] COOPERATION ------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) General energy policy was discussed , including gas , oil and nuclear power . 
Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] made an offer to provide civilian nuclear energy technology ( Reftel ) to the kingdom . 
King [PER Abdullah  ] was receptive to the offer , but no firm agreement was made. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In his speech to the [ORG Shura Council  ] ( [ORG Septel  ] ) on January 14 , Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] espoused tolerance of different religious faiths , women’s rights , and freedom of expression . 
His speech barely mentioned political issues and instead focused on a “civilization policy” - respect and dignity for all cultures . 
While some of these themes are at odds with traditional [MISC Saudi  ] society , [MISC Emb Off  ] present at this event reported that [PER Sarkozy  ] was well-received. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC French  ] delegation included various Ministers to strengthen educational , commercial and energy ties with the kingdom . 
Four cooperative agreements were made: 1 ) political consultations to coordinate regional activities ; 2 ) energy policy regarding gas and oil ; 3 ) vocational language training increase from 100 to 500 students to help overcome the [MISC French-Arabic  ] language barrier ; and 4 ) higher education with the goal to increase the number of [MISC Saudi  ] students in [LOC France  ] ( currently 4000 ) . 
Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] had a brief ( 10-minute ) presentation to [MISC Saudi  ] business leaders. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The overarching theme of the visit , according to [MISC French  ] Embassy [LOC Riyadh  ] , was to strengthen the personal relationship between Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] and King [PER Abdullah  ] . 
Former Pres [PER Jacques Chirac  ] and King [PER Abdullah  ] had a strong friendship with agreement on a host of issues . 
Reportedly , the [MISC Saudis  ] were concerned by [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] election last year because of his expressed support of [LOC Israel  ] and [MISC Jewish  ] background . 
This visit was to dispel [MISC Saudi  ] concerns and to assure the [MISC Saudis  ] that Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] could be counted on as strongly as Pres [PER Chirac  ] . 
Likewise , the [MISC French  ] told us they are modifying their [LOC Mid East  ] policy . 
The [PER Levant  ] states have been [PER France’s  ] top [LOC Mid East  ] focus , while the [LOC Arabian Gulf  ] had been at the “bottom of the list.” Recognition of [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s emerging influence and status has resulted in the [MISC French  ] putting [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] “at the top” of the [MISC French  ] foreign policy [LOC Middle East  ] list . 
GOOD VISIT , BUT NOT GREAT ------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COMMENT . 
Per the [MISC French  ] [ORG DCM  ] , they were quite pleased with Pres [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] visit . 
They were disappointed they could not issue any joint communiqus on any major issues , such as [LOC Iran  ] or the MEPP . 
Still , they viewed the reciprocal state visits were steps forward in [MISC French-Saudi  ] relations . 
Press coverage of Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] was positive with front page newspaper pictures of both leaders smiling together. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) However , our [MISC Saudi  ] contacts provided some negative comments . 
Minor in substance , but significant to [MISC Saudi  ] sensibilities . 
Initially , [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] fiance [PER Carla Bruni  ] was expected to accompany him ( but finally did not travel ) , which the [MISC Saudis  ] found offensive given their strict , conservative culture against the company of an unmarried woman . 
Various protocol faux pas were committed by the [MISC French  ] delegation during the visit . 
The [MISC French  ] advance made , in [MISC Saudi  ] opinion , unreasonable logistical demands . 
Finally , Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] was viewed as less than gracious , in [MISC Saudi  ] eyes , during certain events , such as avoiding tasting traditional [MISC Arab  ] foods and a bored look during the televised arrival sword ceremony . 
While these are minor points , the fact our [MISC Saudi  ] contacts mentioned them shows their discontent . 
These incidents [LOC RIYADH  ] 00000102 003 OF 003 characterized one overarching private comment from the [MISC Saudis  ] , that Pres [PER Sarkozy  ] has not replaced Pres [PER Chirac  ] in [MISC Saudi  ] eyes . 
Other usually well-informed [MISC Saudi  ] contacts have lamented the overtly commercial nature of the visit . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] reportedly presented a list of fourteen ( 14 ) sales that [MISC French  ] firms would like to make to the [MISC Saudi  ] government , complete with the original price and discounts that [PER Sarkozy  ] was prepared to negotiate . 
END COMMENT .
