( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: Rival [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Taliban  ] leaders [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] , [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] , and [PER Hafiz Gul Bahadur  ] formed a new militant alliance on February 23 . 
The new alliance recognizes [ORG Taliban  ] leader [PER Mullah Omar  ] as its leader , and its goal is to fight the planned [LOC U.S.  ] troop surge in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] militant leaders will maintain their independent militants groups but will now facilitate cooperation in cross-border attacks in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It is too early to say how effective this new alliance will be in launching cross-border attacks against [MISC U.S./NATO  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but it does give the largest and most powerful [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Taliban  ] leaders unfettered access across [LOC North  ] and [LOC South Waziristan  ] . 
Formation of the alliance demonstrates that the [ORG GOP  ] 's tribal " divide and conquer " strategy is not working , at least not to our advantage . 
Civilian leaders are concerned about the continuing loss of government writ in the [MISC Waziristans  ] after this agreement , but [LOC Pakistan  ] 's security forces may see few downsides to an alliance that focuses its attacks outside of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 23 , [PER Tehreek-e-Taliban  ] ( [ORG TTP  ] ) leader [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] signed a deal with two powerful rival [ORG Taliban  ] commanders [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] of [LOC South Waziristan  ] and [PER Hafiz Gul Bahadur  ] of [LOC North Waziristan  ] . 
The three , according to press reports , have formed a new group called [PER Shura Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen  ] ( [ORG Mujahideen Unity Council  ] ) , that they claim will unite them against external forces trying to divide the multiple [ORG Taliban  ] groups based in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
They have formed a 13-member shura to run the affairs of the new alliance . 
The militants named [PER Mullah Omar  ] as their supreme leader , but the group did not choose a leader of its operational shura . 
According to a joint public statement , the militant leaders praised [PER Osama Bin Laden  ] and [PER Mullah Omar  ] as defenders of [MISC Islam  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] . 
The spokesman for [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] , [PER Mufti Waliullah  ] , said that the three [ORG Taliban  ] commanders would now operate from a single platform under the new alliance . 
Currently [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] controls the eastern portion of [LOC South Waziristan  ] , which is populated largely by [PER Mehsud  ] tribesmen . 
[PER Maulvi Nazir  ] is based out of the [PER Ahmedzai Wazir  ] area of [LOC South Waziristan  ] on the agency 's western border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Hafiz Gul Bahadur  ] leads his [PER Utmanzai Wazir  ] militants from [PER Miram Shah  ] , [LOC North Waziristan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The formation of the new alliance follows [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] 's December 2007 formation of [ORG TTP  ] as an umbrella group to better coordinate pro-Taliban activities . 
The creation of the [ORG TTP  ] was the merger of various [MISC Pakistani  ] militant groups operating under disparate commands in different tribal agencies . 
The [ORG TTP  ] alliance runs as a loose federation rather than a strictly controlled organization . 
Each of the militant leaders maintains a degree of autonomy and [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] , as the strongest leader of [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Taliban  ] , lends his support and coordination to the various [ORG TTP  ] subcommanders in places such as [LOC Bajaur  ] and [LOC Swat  ] . 
[PER Nazir  ] , who broke openly with [PER Mehsud  ] in the spring of 2007 ( see para 6 ) , was not a part of [ORG TTP  ] . 
[PER Bahadur  ] , who had jockeyed with [PER Mehsud  ] for the title of pre-eminent local militant leader in the [MISC Waziristans  ] , had maintained some distance from the [ORG TTP  ] label before now. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The new [ORG Mujahideen Unity Council  ] will likely be another loose federation with each [ORG Taliban  ] commander maintaining his own authority . 
[LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) [ORG Secretariat Additional Chief  ] Secretary [PER Habibullah Khan  ] expressed concern to [LOC Peshawar  ] Principal Officer in a February 24 meeting that this new body provides all three militant leaders with unfettered access to all of [LOC South  ] and [LOC North Waziristan  ] . 
[PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] will be a main beneficiary of this new access , giving his fighters easier entry to the [LOC Afghanistan  ] border through [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] 's [MISC Wazir-held  ] territory . 
Before the deal , [PER Mehsud  ] had limited access to the border from his portion of [MISC South Waziristan  ] because he was blocked either by [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] or [PER Gul Bahadur  ] . 
While the alliance will not work as a tight top-down militant organization , it will facilitate access and coordination of various [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Taliban  ] as they cross into [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While [PER Khan  ] had no hard facts , he detected the hand of the [PER Haqqani  ] network in bringing these rival commanders together . 
The new coordination , he feared , will allow the [ORG Taliban  ] to focus on sending militants across the border into [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Sirajuddin Haqqani  ] also claimed in the press that he had convinced the three rival [ORG Taliban  ] leaders to meet . 
[PER Sirajuddin  ] and his father [PER Jalaluddin Haqqani  ] lead much of the [ORG Taliban  ] militancy in eastern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Sirajuddin  ] often travels to the tribal areas of [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC North Waziristan  ] in particular , and has served as a mediator between these rival [ORG Taliban  ] leaders. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the past , the [MISC Pakistani  ] government has supported [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] in an attempt to counter [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] in [LOC South  ] [PER Waziristan  ] . 
In the spring of 2007 , an open break between [PER Nazir  ] and [PER Mehsud  ] took place over the presence of " [MISC Uzbek  ] " fighters in [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
The disagreement culminated in an operation in which [MISC Pakistani  ] security forces fought alongside [PER Nazir  ] 's followers to oust [MISC Uzbeks  ] from the area . 
While [PER Nazir  ] appeared to draw on genuine local anger and desire to remove " [MISC Uzbeks  ] , " his activities as an al-Qaida facilitator and promoter of cross-border attacks have always complicated [MISC Pakistani  ] efforts to sell this episode as a " success " story . 
A [MISC South Waziristan-based  ] contact told Principal Officer [LOC Peshawar  ] on February 24 that [PER Mehsud  ] and [PER Nazir  ] are showing signs of getting past old disagreements and that " [MISC Uzbeks  ] " are re-appearing in growing numbers in the area. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [MISC Pakistani  ] newspapers , [PER Ahmedzai Wazir  ] elders of [LOC South Waziristan  ] , who are concerned about the new alliance and the possibility of " [MISC Uzbeks  ] " coming back into their territory , questioned [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] about the deal with rival [PER Mehsud  ] . 
At a meeting in [LOC Wana  ] , [MISC South Waziristan  ] [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] assured the elders that each militant group will continue to have its own independent status and remain sovereign in their own territory . 
[PER Nazir  ] explained that the alliance was formed " only to act together against the [LOC United States  ] " because the [ORG Taliban  ] was concerned about the troop surge in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , according to [LOC Pakistan  ] press reports . 
The elders publicly cautioned [PER Nazir  ] that they would turn against him if this new deal brought any harm to their areas. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While he did not touch on a possible ISI role in brokering this new alliance , [PER Habibullah Khan  ] noted that pressure has been building on the [MISC Pakistani  ] military in the [MISC Waziristans  ] . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] military and then [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] Governor [PER Orakzai  ] quietly entered peace deals with [LOC North Waziristan  ] commanders in December 2007 and with [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] in February 2008 in order to achieve relative peace . 
Those agreements came after a series of high profile attacks on the military in the [MISC Waziristans  ] , including the kidnapping of over 250 security forces by [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] and Jan 2008 fighting at [LOC Ladha Fort  ] in [LOC South  ] [PER Waziristan  ] . 
While violence directed at the military in the [MISC Waziristans  ] has been minor in the last few months , [LOC Peshawar  ] observers regularly note that the military remains concerned with its ability to keep a lid on trouble in these two agencies . 
Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] [PER Kayani  ] believes the respite offered by this latest agreement is necessary for his stretched forces to continue fighting in [LOC Bajaur  ] and [LOC Mohmand  ] agencies . 
However , the relative quiet in [LOC South  ] and [LOC North Waziristan  ] has allowed [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] to increasingly send his fighters in other parts of the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] , including [ORG Swat.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Khan  ] also noted with deep dismay that this announcement demonstrates that these militant commanders see themselves in a strong enough position to form an alliance that takes them one step closer to a formal territorial takeover of the [PER Waziristan  ] as an " [MISC Islamic Emirate  ] . 
" [MISC South Waziristan  ] contacts also commented that there is an increasing presence of [MISC Punjabi  ] militants from [PER Jaish-e Muhammad  ] in the [PER Mehsud  ] areas of [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
( Comment: A development if accurate that is almost certainly of concern to the [MISC Pakistani  ] military . 
It is significant that [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] 's strength and open militancy are drawing fighters from places such as southern [LOC Punjab  ] . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As this new alliance formed , [PER Mullah Omar  ] ordered militants in [LOC North  ] and [MISC South Waziristan  ] to immediately stop their attacks on [MISC Pakistani  ] security forces , according to press reports . 
[PER Omar  ] said in a letter to the militants , " If anybody really wants to wage jihad , they must fight the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] troops inside [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" The letter also stated that [PER Omar  ] was responsible for the agreement between [PER Mehsud  ] , [PER Nazir  ] , and [PER Bahadur  ] , and that after this agreement " the attacks on [MISC Pakistani  ] security forces by the local [ORG Taliban  ] will decrease if not end completely . 
" [PER Mullah Omar  ] continues to exert considerable influence on the militants in [LOC South  ] and [LOC North Waziristan  ] . 
Halting attacks against [MISC Pakistani  ] forces may increase the militants' safe haven space in [LOC Pakistan  ] , allowing the militants to cross the border to attack [ORG NATO  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Comment: It is too early to predict how effective this new alliance will be in launching cross-border attacks on U.S./NATO forces , but its formation will provide the group with unfettered access to [LOC Afghanistan  ] across [LOC North  ] and [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
It is another indication that the [ORG GOP  ] 's tribal divide and conquer strategy against militants is not working , at least not to our advantage . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's security forces , however , may see limited downsides to an arrangement that focuses militant attacks outside of [MISC Pakistan.</pre></code>  ]
