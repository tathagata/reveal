( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Post  ] has received disparate accounts of a January 30 air strike carried out by the [ORG Colombia Air Force  ] that occurred in an area inhabited by indigenous on the border of the [ORG Departments of Choco and Antioquia  ] . 
Members of the [MISC Embera-Katio  ] community told us the strike hit the [ORG Urada-Jiguamiando Reservation  ] injuring a couple and their infant . 
However , [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] officials said the strike occurred a few kilometers outside the reservation in a suspected Revolutionary of [ORG Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) camp . 
Leading newspaper " [ORG El Tiempo  ] " reported a military judge is opening an investigation and the [MISC Colombian  ] military has accepted responsibility for the incident , although they continue to argue the air strike was not on indigenous territory . 
Other information at [ORG Post  ] suggests that the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's version of events appears correct , although several details still remain unclear . 
What is certain is this incident will increase tensions between the [ORG GOC  ] and the indigenous , who are facing an increase in conflict-related violence ( septel ) . 
End Summary . 
INDIGENOUS MAINTAIN MILITARY ERRED ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On February 4 , [PER Poloff  ] and USAID personnel met with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of the [ORG Urada-Jiguamiando Reservatio  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [MISC Embera-Katio  ] indigenous member [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and Legal [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , to hear their versions of what happened during the January 30 incident . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ,   said the air strike landed on an indigenous family 's property while they were cooking breakfast at 3:00 a.m. and injured three people: a mother , father , and their 20 day-old baby ( a nine-year old son and aunt wer e also present , but had no serious injuries ) . 
He also told us the father was hit by shrapnel in the spine and will be unable to walk , while the mother had shrapnel removed from her leg ( see para . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , , who visited the father in the hospital , confirmed he was in " serious " condition . 
The couple is currently being treated in a hospital in [LOC Medellin  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said the baby " looked " burned and was taken to a hospital in [LOC Apartado  ] , [LOC Antioquia  ] , after being treated by the 17th Brigade . 
He was concerned that the military took the baby and aunt to a military hospital without consulting the community members and that the baby remained separated from his mother. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Both [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , rejected the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's explanation that the strike targeted the [ORG FARC  ] , although they admitted the [ORG FARC  ] has transited the reservation in the past . 
They also argued that the [ORG FARC  ] could not have been in the area because the military had entered the zone in December 2009 . 
Moreover , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , countered assertions by the [MISC Colombian  ] military that there was no good reason for the indigenous to be awake so early by stating that this showed a lack of understanding of their culture and [MISC Embera-Katio  ] people often rise well before dawn. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , confirmed the [ORG Indigenous Organization  ] in [ORG Antioquia  ] ( [ORG OIA  ] ) , which initially denounced the incident , is preparing a formal complaint against the military personnel responsible for the operation . 
He told us the [MISC Embera-Katio  ] want the military to assume the medical costs of the injured indigenous , provide reparations to the whole community , and leave their indigenous territories . 
MILITARY SAYS STRIKE HIT OUTSIDE INDIGENOUS TERRITORY --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) General [PER Tito Pinilla  ] , Chief of [ORG Air Operations  ] in the [MISC Colombian  ] Military , told Emboffs on February 2 that the air strikes by the [ORG Seventh Division  ] occurred 2.5 kilometers outside of the indigenous reservation on a suspected [ORG FARC  ]  camp . 
He said an indigenous man and woman with no licit reason for being in the camp had been injured in the raid . 
[PER Pinilla  ] also explained following the strike , a mother and her sick baby approached the convoy and were transported along with the suspected [ORG FARC  ] members to receive medical assistance , which may have generated some confusion . 
However , he stated that neither the baby nor the mother had been injured in the strike . 
INVESTIGATION TO FOLLOW ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On February 9 , leading newspaper " [ORG El Tiempo  ] " reported that a military judge is opening an investigation . 
According to the article , the Commander of the 17th Brigade General [PER Hernan Giraldo  ] said the military " accepts responsibility of the incident , " but he added the indigenous family strayed from their territory when they went out to collect food . 
He argued it was " bad luck " that the military had received information that the [ORG FARC  ] 's 34th Front would be at that site . 
General [PER Giraldo  ] mentioned it was the first time something like this had occurred in the 18 months they had been operating in the zone . 
In an interview with the [ORG National Radio of Colombia  ] ( [ORG RCN  ] ) on January 31 , President [PER Uribe  ] declared that the [MISC Colombian  ] military is " careful not to bomb civilian areas infiltrated by illegal armed groups " and cited the " few number of complaints against the military in the past eight years . 
" GLEANING THE TRUTH ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Other information available at [ORG Post  ] suggests that [PER Pinilla  ] 's version of events is largely correct: a sensitive high-value target operation failed to hit the objective while he was at the site . 
Two indigenous , a male and female , were injured by debris ( not shrapnel ) resulting from the airstrike . 
It is not clear whether the injured female is , in fact , the mother referred to in para two ; we separately confirmed [PER Pinilla  ] 's report that a mother with a dehydrated infant did approach the military convoy before the incident to request medical assistance . 
[ORG Post  ] was also able to co nfirm that the strike was 2.5 kilometers from the village ; [ORG GOC  ] information suggests this was beyond the border of the indigenous reservation . 
According to other information available at [ORG Post  ] , some members of the [MISC Embera-Katio  ] community admitted to harboring [ORG FARC  ] members just a few days prior to the strike. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The contradictory versions of events make it difficult to determine what happened . 
What is apparent is that the [ORG GOC  ] has admitted some responsibility for the mistiming of the bombing . 
The [ORG FARC  ] is increasingly operating in or around indigenous reservations because of the legal and political complications the reservations present for the [MISC Colombian  ] armed forces ( reftel ) . 
The [MISC Colombian  ] military knew of the sensitivities of mounting an operation so close to the indigenous reservation , but believed it took the appropriate precautions . 
Perhaps the investigation by military justice will unravel the story . 
Either way , the incident will increase tensions between the [ORG GOC  ] and the indigenous , who are facing an increase in conflict-related violence ( septel ) .
