REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( U ) This cable is the first of two messages previewing [ORG Pope Benedict’s  ] May 25-28 visit to [LOC Poland  ] . 
The first details Poland’s continuing importance to the [LOC Holy See  ] and touches on several on-going issues in the [MISC Polish  ] Church from the perspective of the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
The second focuses in more detail on the specifics of the upcoming visit. ----------- Summary ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Even without [PER Pope John Paul  ] II at the helm of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , the [ORG Holy See’s  ] attention to [LOC Poland  ] and the influence of [MISC Poles  ] here remains an important dynamic in the workings of the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
Recent months have offered much evidence of this , and numerous opportunities to assess the [LOC Poland  ] - [LOC Holy See  ] relationship . 
Most high-ranking and mid-level [MISC Poles  ] have stayed on in their positions in the [LOC Vatican  ] bureaucracy since the death of [PER John Paul  ] , maintaining the Vatican’s [MISC Polish  ] flavor . 
[ORG Pope Benedict  ] has consistently made gestures to acknowledge the importance of the [MISC Polish  ] [MISC Catholic  ] Church in the context of [MISC European  ] and world [MISC Catholicism  ] - an importance embodied most immediately by the crowds of [MISC Polish  ] pilgrims that still flock to [LOC Rome  ] . 
[ORG Pope Benedict  ] and other [LOC Vatican  ] officials maintain [ORG Pope  ] [PER John Paul’s  ] hope that [LOC Poland  ] will serve as a counter-weight to [MISC Western European  ] secularism , but are wary of nationalistic or divisive forces with a [MISC Catholic  ] label , such as media outlets under the control of [MISC Polish  ] station Radio Maryja . 
With [ORG Pope Benedict  ] XVI’s May 25-28 visit to [LOC Poland  ] looming , many in and around the [LOC Vatican  ] are addressing these subjects . 
End Summary. ------------------------ [MISC Poland:  ] Still a Presence ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The papacy of [PER John Paul  ] II is slowly fading into history , but [LOC Poland  ] remains an important part of the conversation at the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
Recent months have offered much evidence of this , and numerous opportunities to assess [LOC Holy See  ] - [LOC Poland  ] relations . 
Late last year , several groups of [MISC Polish  ] bishops came to [LOC Rome  ] for their quinquennial “ad limina” visit to the pope and [LOC Vatican  ] officials . 
In December , then-President [PER Aleksander Kwasniewski  ] made his swan song visit to the [LOC Vatican  ] and met with [PER Benedict XVI  ] . 
In January , his successor , President [PER Lech Kaczynski  ] , made his first trip abroad as president and met [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] . 
The first anniversary of the death of the [MISC Polish  ] pope in April saw waves of [MISC Polish  ] pilgrims visiting [LOC Rome  ] , but the sound of [MISC Polish  ] on the streets of [LOC Rome  ] hardly abated for the [MISC Easter  ] celebrations two weeks later . 
Add periodic events commemorating various dates in the life of [PER John Paul  ] II or initiatives that he began , and there remains an inevitable [MISC Polish  ] flavor to life at the [LOC Vatican.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In the aftermath of the death of the [MISC Polish  ] pope , Pole-weary [MISC Italian  ] journalists heralded the impending exodus of [MISC Poles  ] from [LOC Rome  ] and the [LOC Vatican  ] [ORG Curia  ] ( bureaucracy ) ( ref a ) . 
Their hope was that an [MISC Italian  ] would regain the papacy and add to the already imposing number of [MISC Italians  ] in the [ORG Curia  ] . 
Many predicted that the papacy would inevitably turn its attention from the homeland of the deceased pontiff . 
In the end , [PER Joseph Ratzinger  ] of [LOC Germany  ] was elected pope , and the [MISC Poles  ] , by and large , stayed . 
And although it was inevitable that the death of [PER John Paul  ] would signal a change in the relationship between [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Holy See  ] , the bond remains strong . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] has continued to play close attention to [LOC Poland  ] and [MISC Poles  ] continue to wield great influence in [LOC Vatican City.  ] ----------------------------------- [MISC Polish  ] Personnel , Influence Remain ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Benedict  ] moved his own [MISC German  ] secretary , Monsignor [PER Georg Ganswein  ] , into the [LOC Apostolic Palace  ] , but he kept on Pope [PER John Paul’s  ] [MISC Polish  ] aide , [PER Mieczyslaw Mokrzycki  ] ( an ethnic [MISC Pole  ] from [LOC Ukraine  ] ) in a very visible position in the papal household . 
Other prominent [MISC Poles  ] at the [LOC Vatican  ] , such as Cardinal [PER Zenon Grocholewski  ] ( Congregation for Education ) , Monsignor [PER Antoni Stankiewicz  ] ( [PER Roman Rota  ] - the Vatican’s high court ) , Archbishop [PER Edward Nowak  ] ( Congregation for the Causes of Saints ) , Monsignor [PER Krzysztof Nitkiewicz  ] ( Congregation for [MISC Oriental Churches  ] ) , Archbishop [PER Stanislaw Rylko  ] ( Council for [MISC Laity  ] ) , and others are continuing in high-profile positions . 
[ [PER Note: Rylko  ] was passed over for an expected elevation to the College of Cardinals at the most recent consistory , but still heads an important [LOC Vatican  ] department . 
] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Benedict  ] also named London-born [MISC Polish  ] priest [PER Wojciech Giertych  ] as theologian of the [LOC Papal Household  ] , another prestigious position . 
[PER Giertych  ] is the son of well-known [MISC Polish  ] [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000083 002.2 OF 004 nationalist [PER Jedrzej Giertych  ] ( 1903-92 ) , and brother of [PER Maciej Giertych  ] of the [ORG League of Polish Families  ] party in [LOC Poland  ] . 
Maciej’s son , [PER Roman  ] , is the newly-named Education Minister ( as reported by Embassy [LOC Warsaw  ] ) and a member of the [MISC Catholic  ] organization , [ORG Opus Dei  ] . 
Though Fr . 
[PER Giertych  ] was selected for his erudition and preaching rather than his nationality ( we also doubt his family connections played a role in the appointment ) , his presence presents another opportunity for [MISC Polish  ] visibility and influence . 
A host of lower-level [MISC Polish  ] functionaries continue as well , doing a lot of the heavy lifting in and around the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
The only major name to leave [LOC Rome  ] in the wake of the death of [PER John Paul  ] was Archbishop [PER Stanislaw Dziwisz  ] , [PER John Paul’s  ] longtime secretary , whom [PER Benedict  ] sent to follow in his mentor’s footsteps as Cardinal Archbishop of [LOC Krakow.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) “Even after the death of the [ORG Holy Father  ] , we have a strong presence here , ” [PER Grzegorz Kaszak  ] , rector of the [MISC Polish  ] College ( residential seminary ) in [LOC Rome  ] and a former [LOC Vatican  ] bureaucrat , told us . 
[PER Kaszak  ] pointed out that [MISC Poles  ] had been making inroads at the [LOC Vatican  ] for over twenty years . 
Their influence was unlikely to diminish overnight . 
Even when [PER Benedict XVI  ] makes the major changes in the [ORG Curia  ] that Vatican-watchers have been predicting for some time , most [MISC Poles  ] here do not predict that [MISC Polish  ] influence in the [LOC Vatican  ] will drop precipitously. “We are now part of the culture here , ” and a crucial element of the Church in [LOC Europe  ] and in the world , [PER Kaszak  ] insisted. ------------------------------------------ [LOC Vatican  ] Publicizes Stats on [MISC Polish  ] Church ------------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The statistics bear [PER Kaszak  ] out . 
We defer to Embassy [LOC Warsaw  ] on the strength of the [MISC Polish  ] [MISC Catholic  ] Church domestically , but the [LOC Vatican  ] was touting its numbers in advance of the pope’s trip . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] released statistics noting the country’s 36.6 million [MISC Catholics  ] at some 10,114 parishes and 800 pastoral centers . 
There are some 28 thousand priests and almost 25 thousand other religious personnel ( nuns and other male religious ) with 6,400 students studying to become priests . 
Vatican-based sources have remarked to us that Poland’s [MISC Catholic  ] muscle is felt far beyond the country’s borders . 
In parishes in [LOC Italy  ] , other [MISC European  ] countries , the [LOC U.S.  ] , and elsewhere , it is not uncommon to come upon [MISC Polish  ] clergy , either on loan , or having taken up residence in a foreign diocese . 
What’s most important to the [LOC Holy See  ] is the “formation of the youth , ” according to [PER Dariusz Giers  ] , a [MISC Polish  ] priest working at the Vatican’s Health Ministry. “The [LOC Vatican  ] knows we have excellent programs to educate young people [ in religious matters ] ” he said , emphasizing the importance of this factor for the continuing strength of the religion . 
What’s more , many at the [LOC Vatican  ] consider [MISC Polish  ] Catholicism to be dependably orthodox , compared to more liberal strains of the faith found in some parts of [ORG Western Europe.  ] “The [MISC Poles  ] are grounded in the faith , ” one contact opined. “You wouldn’t have to worry about the [MISC Da Vinci Code  ] confusing people in [LOC Poland.”  ] --------------------- Ubiquitous Presence --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As if to emphasize the ubiquitous presence of [MISC Poles  ] in and around the [LOC Vatican  ] , [PER Kaszak  ] exchanged several greetings in [MISC Polish  ] with passing nuns as he spoke to us not far from [LOC St. Peter’s Square  ] . 
In fact , whether one’s in the [LOC Vatican  ] grocery store or post office , [LOC St. Peter’s  ] [LOC Basilica  ] , or walking any of the streets around [LOC Vatican City  ] , it’s hard to go twenty minutes without hearing some [MISC Polish  ] . 
And this is not just from the [LOC Vatican  ] functionaries from [LOC Poland  ] and the many [MISC Polish  ] nuns who staff several [LOC Vatican  ] offices and residences . 
The flow of [MISC Polish  ] pilgrims to [LOC Rome  ] has waned little even a year after the death of Pope [PER John Paul  ] . 
Of course , massive crowds of [MISC Poles  ] came to [LOC Rome  ] to observe the first anniversary of the pope’s death on April 2 . 
A mass said by Pope [PER Benedict  ] and other events packed an overflowing [LOC St. Peter’s Square  ] . 
But it seemed to onlookers that the [MISC Polish  ] influx was just as great - or greater - for the [MISC Easter  ] celebrations not long afterwards . 
As is typical for the outdoor audiences and public masses , banners from [MISC Polish  ] parishes and towns highlighted [MISC Polish  ] participation. “I think there were even more [MISC Poles  ] here for [MISC Easter  ] , ” [LOC Vatican  ] bureaucrat [PER Giers  ] told us. “This has been nearly constant since the death of the [ORG Holy Father  ] . 
I don’t see signs of it slowing down.” ---------------------------- Pope Reaches Out to [MISC Poles  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [LOC Holy See  ] clearly recognizes who its audience is . 
At his weekly public gathering ( a mixture of prayer and pep rally ) , [PER Pope Benedict  ] speaks every week to the crowd in [MISC Polish  ] , [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000083 003.6 OF 004 in addition to [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC French  ] , [MISC English  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] , and [MISC German  ] . 
[MISC Polish  ] is typically one of the languages used for prayers at [LOC Vatican  ] masses . 
The pope often makes special emphasis on the [MISC Polish  ] contingent at the audiences and other events , as on May 3 , when he noted the anniversary of the 1791 ratification of the [MISC Polish  ] Constitution and heralded the anniversary a noteworthy event in [MISC Polish Catholic  ] history . 
[PER Benedict XVI  ] has also devoted some of his rare private audiences to [MISC Polish  ] or [MISC Polish-affiliated  ] groups such an April visit with representatives of the [MISC Krakow-based  ] publishing house , [LOC Znak  ] , publisher of [PER Pope John Paul’s  ] last book and other Church-related works . 
That [PER Pope Benedict  ] , who travels much less than his predecessor , chose [LOC Poland  ] as his second trip abroad ( his first was a visit to [ORG World Youth Day  ] in [LOC Germany  ] that had been scheduled before his election ) is perhaps the strongest sign of this recognition ( septel ) . --------------------------------------- A Counter-Weight to [ORG Secular Europe  ] ? --------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG Holy See’s  ] attention to [LOC Poland  ] is not simply customer service or “taking care of the troops” . 
As was clear under [PER Pope John Paul II  ] , the [LOC Vatican  ] has high hopes that [LOC Poland  ] will serve as a counter-weight to [MISC Western European  ] secularism as the nation makes itself more at home in an integrated [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Pope Benedict’s  ] preoccupation with what he sees as [ORG Europe’s  ] increasing psychological distance from its [MISC Christian  ] roots is clear ( ref a ) . 
He has continued to focus on [MISC Poland’s  ] potential in combating this trend . 
This was one of the themes of the visit of several groups of [MISC Polish  ] bishops to the [LOC Vatican  ] at the end of last year. “It’s a topic that always comes up , ” explained Monsignor [PER Michael Banach  ] , the [LOC Holy See  ] MFA’s country director for [LOC Poland  ] . 
He told us that the two sides recognized that the [MISC Polish  ] bishops needed to exert leadership in the face of [MISC Western European  ] secularism . 
Certainly the [LOC Holy See  ] hopes that [LOC Poland  ] will hold the line at the [ORG EU  ] on “life and family” issues that arise . 
But the necessity of maintaining and fortifying the faith internally in [MISC Polish  ] society is perhaps an equally important - if not unrelated - focus . 
Several sources have told us that both sides are keenly aware of the danger that [MISC European  ] secularism will dilute [MISC Polish  ] faith and identity. ------------- [ORG Trojan Horse  ] ------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Looking at [MISC Poland’s  ] position in [LOC Europe  ] and the [ORG EU  ] , several [MISC Polish  ] interlocutors told us that [MISC Western European  ] suspicion of [LOC Poland  ] as a “Trojan horse” for the [LOC U.S.  ] in the [ORG EU  ] was not just a phenomenon among the laity - it had also infected the [LOC Vatican.  ] “We definitely get that feeling” from a few of the [MISC French  ] , [MISC German  ] and other [ORG Western European  ] prelates at the [LOC Vatican  ] , said [PER Giers  ] . 
The war in [LOC Iraq  ] , unpopular among many [LOC Vatican  ] officials , has certainly played a role here . 
Traditional [MISC Polish  ] affection for the [LOC U.S.  ] , on the other hand , seems as strong as ever among the [MISC Polish  ] clergy stationed or studying in [LOC Rome  ] . 
In conversations at a dinner not long ago at the [MISC Polish  ] College , several seminarians and priests made a point of praising the [LOC U.S.  ] and lauding [ORG USG  ] foreign policy. ---------------- [ORG Radio Maryja  ] ---------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Although the [LOC Vatican  ] is on guard against encroaching secularism , it shares with many [MISC Polish  ] bishops a wariness of [ORG Radio Maryja  ] , the [MISC Catholic  ] radio station accused of xenophobia and anti-Semitism . 
[PER Banach  ] and [PER Piotr Samerek  ] , [ORG DCM  ] at the [MISC Polish  ] Embassy to the [LOC Holy See  ] , told us that during their ad limina visits , several of the bishops appealed to [LOC Vatican  ] Foreign Minister [PER Giovanni Lajolo  ] and others to clamp down on excesses of [ORG Radio Maryja  ] and its sister media outlets . 
The complaints included [ORG Radio Maryja’s  ] meddling in [MISC Polish  ] politics . 
According to [PER Banach  ] , [PER Lajolo  ] was sympathetic , and expressed his reservations about the network . 
But [PER Lajolo  ] took a typical [LOC Vatican  ] line in judging the matter to be an [MISC Polish  ] internal affair . 
[PER Banach  ] told us that [PER Lajolo  ] told more than one group of bishops that they had to deal with [ORG Radio Maryja  ] themselves as part of their “pastoral responsibilities” . 
Though media attributed some comments critical of [ORG Radio Maryja  ] to [PER Pope Benedict  ] , the [LOC Holy See  ] clearly did not want to get involved. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) When Papal [PER Nuncio Jozef Kowalczyk  ] made an April statement chastising [ORG Radio Maryja  ] , many assumed that the [LOC Vatican  ] had finally decided to clamp down on the network . 
Our contacts tell us that wasn’t the case , saying that while the [LOC Holy See  ] agreed with the spirit of [MISC Kowalczyk’s  ] intervention , the nuncio had spoken out on his own . 
Some following the issue at the [LOC Vatican  ] have told us that [PER Kowalczyk  ] went too far , given the [MISC Vatican’s  ] view of the matter as an internal [MISC Polish  ] question . 
In [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000083 004.4 OF 004 any case , as [PER Banach  ] told us , things seem to be improving , as the proposed programming board set up to monitor the content of the station’s broadcasts looks like a step in the right direction. ---------------- Other Influences ---------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) As the [LOC Holy See  ] examines the many aspects of its relationship with [LOC Poland  ] , it seeks to maintain its focus on the pastoral rather than political . 
But religious subjects routinely morph into political ones . 
[PER Banach  ] wouldn’t bite when asked for his view of the entry of radical elements such as [PER Andrzej Lepper  ] or ultra-Catholics like [PER Roman Giertych  ] into [MISC Poland’s  ] governing coalition and ministerial ranks ( ref c ) . 
He did say that the [LOC Vatican  ] understood the dangers that right-wing nationalists posed to [MISC Poland’s  ] future , and allowed that some saw a danger of [MISC Catholic  ] fringe groups discrediting the mainstream Church . 
As far as the reputation for anti-Semitism that stuck to some nationalists , [PER Banach  ] commented that “no one” wanted to see the progress that had been made on such issues lost. ---------- Comment ---------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) It is only a little more than a year after the death of [PER Pope John Paul II  ] , and it is inevitable that with the passage of time [LOC Poland  ] will eventually become less central to the world of the [LOC Vatican  ] . 
John-Paul era [LOC Vatican  ] bureaucrats will eventually move on . 
[LOC Poland  ] may become more secular . 
The memory of the [MISC Polish  ] pope will certainly recede further into the past . 
The growth of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in certain parts of the developing world could also play a role here , pushing the [MISC Poles  ] , [MISC Italians  ] and others to less prominent roles with the [LOC Holy See  ] and capturing even more attention in Curial offices . 
For the near future , however , [LOC Poland  ] is assured an important place at the [LOC Vatican  ] table.ROONEY</pre></code>
