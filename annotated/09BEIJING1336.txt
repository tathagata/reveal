Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG CDA  ] spoke by phone with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to discuss recent pressure by the [MISC Chinese  ] government to censor the company’s [MISC Chinese  ] website , accelerated perhaps by the approach of significant political anniversaries.XXXXXXXXXXXXX averred that the root of the problem was [ORG China’s Politburo Standing Committee  ] member [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who wants the company to remove a link to the uncensored google.com site from its sanitized [MISC Chinese  ] version , google.cn . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [ORG Google China  ] has resisted that step as against company principles , though it has taken other smaller measures to try and placate the government . 
Thus far that tactic has been unsuccessful , and the government has already taken commercial steps against [ORG Google  ] , including telling the three dominant SOE telecoms to stop doing business with the company . 
[ORG CDA  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] discussed possible [ORG USG  ] advocacy , including having imminent visiting Codels and possible [ORG Cabinet-level  ] officials raise this directly . 
For the moment , [ORG Google  ] does not wish to go public , preferring to see if current efforts produce results . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG CDA  ] [PER Dan Piccuta  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] talked XXXXXXXXXX about the increasing censorship pressure [ORG Google  ] is facing.XXXXXXXXXXXX said [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] member [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recently discovered that [MISC Google’s  ] worldwide site is uncensored , and is capable of [MISC Chinese  ] language searches and search results . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] allegedly entered his own name and found results critical of him . 
He also noticed the link from google.cn’s homepage to google.com , whichXXXXXXXXXXXX reportedly believes is an “illegal site.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asked three ministries ( note: most likely the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] and [ORG Information Industry  ] , [ORG State Council Information Office  ] , and [ORG Public Security Bureau  ] . 
) to write a report about [ORG Google  ] and demand that the company cease its “illegal activities , ” which include linking to google.com . 
Commercial Consequences Already Visible --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that removing the link to google.com is against the company’s principles , and its leadership has definitively refused to make such a change , despite the importance of the [MISC Chinese  ] market . 
[ORG Google  ] recently has officially but “politely” told the government this , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted , and their [MISC Chinese  ] interlocutors at the time were visibly unhappy and said they would report the news to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported that [ORG Google  ] had , however , already made some changes to its [MISC Chinese  ] site and will continue to make others . 
Nonetheless , he said [LOC China  ] has already asked its three state-owned telecom companies to stop working with [LOC China  ] , a hard blow because mobile [MISC Internet  ] is [MISC Google’s  ] “big bet in [LOC China.”XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said one telecom company is seeking to back out of an existing contract with [ORG Google  ] , while the two others have stopped moving ahead with negotiations . 
Other SOEs have also been asked to stop working with [ORG Google  ] in [LOC China  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The best case scenario [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] foresees is that [LOC China  ] responds to [MISC Google’s  ] official refusal to take down the link by issuing an order warning against further non-compliance . 
More likely is [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001336 002 OF 003 that google.com will be blocked in [LOC China  ] , either sporadically or permanently . 
This would be similar to [ORG China’s  ] current blocking of [ORG YouTube  ] , but with greater implications for users including business travelers and tourists , advertisers , and for [MISC Google’s  ] network and technology platforms , possibly affecting other services like Gmail.thought it also possible that the government might revoke [MISC Google’s  ] license to operate in [LOC China  ] . 
He acknowledged that sensitive anniversaries in 2009 present special challenges to the [MISC Chinese  ] government , especially the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] June 4 Tiananmen anniversary . 
( [PER Note: Possibly  ] in preparation for this anniversary year , [MISC Chinese  ] censors have engaged in a months-long “anti- vulgar” campaign to shut down hundreds of “illegal” websites ; see reftel . 
) [ORG Google  ] Deems its Legal [PER Basis Sound  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Google  ] lawyers have found no legal basis for [ORG China’s  ] demands , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported . 
While the government has called google.com an illegal website to justify its request for removal of the link , [MISC Chinese  ] law does not explicitly identify the site as illegal , the site is not blocked by [LOC China  ] , and thousands of other [MISC Chinese  ] websites include links to google.com. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [ORG Google  ] faces the dilemma of losing the [MISC Chinese  ] market in retaliation for maintaining [MISC Google’s  ] integrity and brand . 
The [ORG CDA  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] discussed the difficulty of engaging [LOC China  ] on this matter , since no trade obligations cover [ORG China’s  ] censorship regime , but considered what [ORG U.S. Government  ] actions might be possible nonetheless . 
[ORG USG  ] High-Level Advocacy Requested --------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested that high-level [ORG USG  ] officials phone or write to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to indicate support for [MISC Google’s  ] operations in [LOC China  ] , in accordance with [MISC Chinese  ] law . 
He suggested the letter could urge further dialogue toward a mutually acceptable resolution and suggest diplomatic or commercial consequences in the event of rash or disruptive action . 
After some discussion , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] concluded that intervention by Secretary [PER Locke  ] might be the most effective step. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] He noted that [ORG Google  ] has also raised the issue with Representatives [PER Kirk  ] and [PER Larson  ] . 
However , he stressed , he would like [ORG USG  ] support in making contact. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG CDA  ] said senior Embassy officials will meet with relevant [MISC Chinese  ] ministries to make it clear the [ORG USG  ] is aware of the issue , and to urge them to work constructively with [MISC Google.XXXXXXXXXX  ] stressed that , before the [ORG USG  ] engages on their behalf , [ORG Google  ] would prefer to wait a few days to see what other steps the [MISC Chinese  ] government might take . 
[ORG Google History in China  ] ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that [ORG Google  ] entered the [MISC Chinese  ] market in 2006 under scrutiny from [ORG Congress  ] and shareholders , both concerned with the company’s agreement to be subject to censorship . 
To enter the [LOC China  ] market legally , but remain faithful to its values , the company took a path of [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001336 003 OF 003 “responsible engagement” that included three commitments: [ORG Google  ] will never disclose to the [MISC Chinese  ] government any personal information about its users or their search habits ; [ORG Google  ] will always include a disclosure notice to identify when search results had been removed due to censorship ; and [ORG Google  ] will always provide an uncensored , U.S.-hosted site , subject to [LOC U.S.  ] law. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [MISC Chinese  ] government’s granting of the licenses necessary for [ORG Google  ] to operate in [LOC China  ] implied passive approval or at least tolerance of the above principles . 
Since 2006 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , the company has operated responsibly and legally , following censorship orders just as other companies do . 
The vast majority of [MISC Chinese  ] government requests for censorship have been related to pornographic material and illegal activities , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
In total , only about one percent of search results are blocked in [LOC China  ] , according to the company. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed that , before [ORG Google China  ] was formed , google.com was blocked in [LOC China  ] in 2002 for approximately two months . 
At the time , he said , scholarly users were the company’s largest constituency , and their complaints about limited access to academic materials through [ORG Google  ] ultimately caused the government to re-open the site . 
This time , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed , [PER XXXXXXXXXX  ] seems unconcerned with such repercussions , and will likely not yield to pressure from [ORG China’s  ] [MISC Internet  ] community . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he said , believes [ORG Google  ] is a “tool” of the [ORG USG  ] being used to “foment peaceful revolution in [LOC China.” Comment  ] ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) While we can neither confirm nor deny the provocative language and views attributed to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the claims of government-forced retribution by the major [MISC SOE  ] telecoms companies are cause for serious concern . 
The potential for continuing escalation by the [MISC Chinese  ] , assuming [ORG Google  ] sticks to its guns -- and the likelihood of loud [ORG U.S. Congressional  ] and public outcry if it caves -- suggest a high-level [ORG USG  ] response may be in order . 
While we cannot verify XXXXXXXXXXXX’s claims of commercial retaliation , such a move seems quite possible .
