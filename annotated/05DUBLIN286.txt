( C ) Summary . 
In a brief March 7 meeting with Finance Minister [PER Brian Cowen  ] , the Ambassador recommended [MISC U.S.-style  ] tax incentives for university endowment contributions as a model for [LOC Ireland  ] in addressing funding shortfalls for higher education . 
[PER Cowen  ] noted Ireland’s drive on economic and academic competitiveness and said that the [ORG GOI  ] could consider the endowment idea as part of ongoing comprehensive review of the [MISC Irish  ] tax code . 
On [LOC Northern Ireland  ] , [PER Cowen  ] said that a strong message from the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] to [PER Sinn Fein  ] could help to advance a final resolution in the peace proces , as would [ORG Congressional  ] hearings on criminality . 
[PER Cowen  ] also noted that [PER Sinn Fein  ] seems to be playing a “double game” -- taking a hard public line against criminality , but avoiding definitive action in order to retain maneuverability for final negotiations with unionists . 
The Minister also pointed out that the [ORG Department of Justice  ] ( [ORG DOJ  ] ) was taking the [ORG GOI  ] lead on investigations into the apparent money-laundering scheme uncovered on February 17-18 , and he offered to arrange a [ORG DOJ  ] briefing for the [MISC Embassy  ] on the status of the investigations .

( U ) On March 7 , the Ambassador held a brief , cordial meeting with Finance Minister [PER Brian Cowen.XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also attended , along with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Econoff was [MISC Embassy  ] notetaker . 
Higher Education Funding ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador related concerns expressed by [LOC U.S.  ] firms and [MISC Irish  ] universities that the quality and number of third-level graduates ( roughly 16,000 in 2004 ) increasingly appeared insufficient to meet the needs of Ireland’s hi-tech economic sectors . 
The Ambassador noted that this problem had repercussions for Ireland’s drive on global competitiveness and was linked to limits on education funding , which derived from the [ORG Government’s  ] long-standing decision not to impose university tuition for [MISC Irish  ] students ( a theme of the Ambassador’s March 3 speech at [ORG Trinity College  ] ) . 
He cited the case of [ORG E-Bay  ] , which had established offices in [LOC Ireland  ] in 2004 , but which was now several hundred employees behind in its hiring schedule because of qualification deficiencies among job applicants . 
With the reimposition of tuition fees off the table , said the Ambassador , an alternative funding mechanism for [MISC Irish  ] higher education could be [MISC U.S.-style  ] university endowments . 
Importantly , [LOC U.S.  ] tax law encouraged individual and corporate donations to an endowment by making them tax-deductible . 
The Ambassador asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] endowment model might hold interest for the [ORG Department of Finance  ] and also whether private contributions to university endowments were now , or could become , tax-deductible. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) [PER Cowen  ] thanked the Ambassador for his interest and cited the [ORG Government’s  ] focus on competition , both at the university level and for the [MISC Irish  ] economy writ-large . 
[PER Cowen  ] said that , in the [ORG Government’s  ] drive to improve university education , the [ORG Department of Finance  ] had concentrated on assisting the transition to better management structures in university administration . 
This effort entailed rationalizing curricula , faculty , and academic departments so as to eliminate obscure , under-attended courses with a view to making the most good for the most students . 
The extra motivation for the Finance Department’s efforts with the universities had come primarily from an [ORG OECD  ] report in 2004 on [MISC Irish  ] higher education , which claimed that [LOC Ireland  ] was risking its global economic competitiveness without more extensive education reforms . 
He added that whereas endowments had not previously played a major role in education funding in [LOC Ireland  ] , this was an idea that the Government might do well to consider , especially with the unlikely reimposition of tuition fees. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Cowen  ] confirmed that private/corporate donations to education endowments were currently not tax-deductible , a reflection of the fact that corporate and personal tax rates were already comparatively low . 
He added , however , that the [ORG Finance Department  ] was conducting a comprehensive review of breaks/incentives in the [MISC Irish  ] tax code and that endowment contributions could be examined in that context . 
To introduce tax write-offs for endowment donations , it would be necessary , said [PER Cowen  ] , to ensure that funds otherwise destined for government coffers would not simply be switched to the endowments . 
Second , the tax incentives for contributions would have to be designed to discourage contributors from dictating to the universities the way that their donations could be used , e.g. , only for cancer research . 
[PER Cowen  ] observed that failure on this second point could allow contributors too powerful a voice in the design of student curricula . 
He noted that , with the surge in the number of wealthy [MISC Irish  ] , there could be win-win situations for the universities in terms of funding resources and for contributors in terms of their tax burden . 
He said the [ORG Finance Department  ] would welcome any additional [LOC U.S.  ] perspectives on the endowment idea that the Ambassador might wish to offer . 
[LOC Northern Ireland  ] ; Money Laundering ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the [LOC Northern Ireland  ] peace process , [PER Cowen  ] expected that [PER Sinn Fein  ] would “go off to sort itself out” following the party’s annual conference on March 4-6 in [LOC Dublin  ] . 
He believed that , after the May [LOC Westminster  ] elections , [PER Sinn Fein  ] would attempt to convince people of its seriousness about criminality through actions designed to back up the party’s recent positive rhetoric on the subject . 
[PER Cowen  ] related his impression that [PER Gerry Adams  ] was playing a “double game” -- taking a hard public line against criminality , but avoiding definitive action in order to retain maneuverability for final negotiations with unionists . 
[PER Cowen  ] thought the family of murder victim [PER Robert McCartney  ] had done a valuable public service in exposing this form of equivocation . 
The Minister also expressed hope that the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] would deliver a strong message to [PER Sinn Fein  ] over [ORG St. Patrick’s Day  ] on the need for a final resolution in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] , especially with the [ORG IRA  ] cease-fire now more than ten years old . 
A series of [ORG Congressional  ] hearings on [LOC Northern Ireland  ] focusing on the criminality question would , maintained [PER Cowen  ] , help to bring political pressure on [PER Sinn Fein  ] to take the necessary steps in pursuit of a final deal. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) When the Ambassador asked for an update on the [ORG GOI  ] money-laundering investigation into the February 17-18 police seizures of roughly euro 4 million in sterling notes ( reftel ) , [ORG Minster Cowen  ] replied that the [ORG Department of Justice  ] ( [ORG DOJ  ] ) was the [ORG GOI  ] lead on the case . 
He said , however , that the [ORG Department of Finance  ] was as intensely interested in [ORG GOI  ] progress as the [MISC Embassy  ] , and he offered to arrange a [ORG DOJ  ] confidential briefing for the [MISC Embassy  ] on the investigations . 
[PER Cowen  ] noted that the briefing could include a supplement from the [ORG Ireland Financial Services Regulatory Authority  ] ( [ORG IFSRA  ] , a component of the [MISC Irish  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] ) . 
He added that [ORG IFSRA  ] had not reported any problems to date in pursuing the case in the context of its relatively new regulatory powers under the [ORG “Central Bank  ] and [ORG Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act  ] , 2003.” KENNY</pre></code>
