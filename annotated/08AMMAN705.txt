( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The issue of who can and cannot transmit citizenship is an ongoing concern of many women in [LOC Jordan  ] , and was revived in the public consciousness during recent parliamentary elections . 
[MISC Jordanian  ] women married to non-Jordanian men do not transmit citizenship to their children . 
This creates a precarious situation , primarily for the children of [MISC Palestinian  ] fathers , but also for the children of foreign laborers resident in [LOC Jordan  ] . 
Women 's rights activists have worked on this situation for years , to no avail . 
Even public statements by , and strong support for legislative action from , the Queen have fallen on deaf ears . 
Meanwhile , the number of families with a tenuous legal situation in [LOC Jordan  ] is growing as the [MISC Palestinian-origin  ] population intermingles with [LOC East Bankers  ] . 
Lawmakers dismiss changes to the law as politically impossible , even as civil society professes its willingness to compromise . 
In the end , it is [MISC Jordanian  ] identity politics , not gender concerns , that are at the heart of this debate . 
End Summary . 
The [ORG Battle Over Jordan  ] 's Citizenship Law ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the parliamentary campaign season , [MISC Jordanian  ] voters ( especially women ) started to resurrect an issue of specific importance to them - amending [LOC Jordan  ] 's citizenship law . 
The issue of citizenship transferral has long been an issue in [LOC Jordan  ] , which is home to large communities of refugees ( and their descendants ) as well as foreign workers who have naturally integrated with their [MISC Jordanian  ] hosts . 
For the past several years , civil society activists and some parliamentarians have called for a new law or amendments to the current statute that would allow [MISC Jordanian  ] women to pass citizenship to their children. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to the citizenship law currently in force ( which dates to 1954 , with several amendments ) , non-Jordanian women who marry [MISC Jordanian  ] men can naturalize as [MISC Jordanian  ] citizens after living in the country for certain periods of time . 
Wives of [MISC Arab  ] extraction or nationality can become [MISC Jordanian  ] citizens after three years' residence , and those from other countries can obtain citizenship after five years . 
While naturalization is possible for the wives of [MISC Jordanians  ] , there is no such naturalization statute for children . 
The current law automatically grants citizenship to children of [MISC Jordanian  ] men , regardless of where they are born . 
Yet there is no statute whereby women can transmit [MISC Jordanian  ] citizenship , either to their spouses or their children . 
Note: The one exception is illegitimate children born to [MISC Jordanian  ] women or cases where the father is unknown . 
These children automatically receive [MISC Jordanian  ] citizenship . 
End [LOC Note.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This issue impacts [MISC Jordanians  ] of [MISC Palestinian  ] origin and migrant workers from other [MISC Arab  ] states most acutely . 
Note: Between the two , these groups are estimated to constitute as much as eighty percent of [LOC Jordan  ] 's population . 
End Note . 
Due to the varying degrees of citizenship available in [LOC Jordan  ] , it is often the case that [MISC Palestinian  ] men of less than full citizenship ( refugees from [LOC Gaza  ] or " green card " holders from the [LOC West Bank  ] , to be covered septel ) along with long term non-citizen laborers from [LOC Egypt  ] , marry " full citizen " [MISC Jordanian  ] women , producing children who have no rights to [MISC Jordanian  ] citizenship . 
Over time , this has resulted in a growing number of families with split legal status in [LOC Jordan  ] , despite having been born in [LOC Jordan  ] or having lived in the country for decades. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Queen [PER Rania  ] ( herself of [MISC Palestinian  ] origin ) raised hackles and eyebrows in 2002 when she declared support for a provisional law which would allow women to pass [MISC Jordanian  ] citizenship to their children ( Refs A and B ) . 
That statement was followed up by a brief spate of op-eds and civil society campaigns in support of the law 's implementation . 
The law was enacted , yet the new right remained theoretical in practice , as it required approval by the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] for individual cases rather than making citizenship transmittal automatic . 
Since the law 's enactment , no cases have been referred to the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] for approval . 
Contacts note with wry smirks that even the Queen 's intervention was not enough to quell the backlash of [LOC Jordan  ] 's political establishment . 
[PER Eva Abu Hawaleh  ] , a human rights lawyer , says that since " the decision didn't come from inside the government , " the security services effectively quashed the law 's effect . 
Note: Provisional laws , enacted by the government in the absence of parliament , remain on the books until considered in a subsequent legislative term . 
Six years after its enactment , the parliament has yet to revisit the changes to the citizenship law . 
End Note . 
Growing Pressure for Change --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) There is a growing realization among women 's rights activists and female members of parliament that something has to be done . 
[PER Rawa Sarrar  ] , head of a women 's center in the [MISC Baqa'a Palestinian  ] refugee camp , says that changes in the personal status law are a primary political concern among the women she serves . 
Through the center , the female voters of [MISC Baqa'a  ] camp raised the issue repeatedly during the campaign season , and continue to do so with women who were seated in parliament as a result of the quota . 
[PER Sarrar  ] hopes that political pressure from [ORG NGOs  ] and female voters will lead to necessary changes in the law , but she realizes that it is an uphill political fight . 
" Hopefully , it will happen during this term , " she says. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) " Families in [LOC Jordan  ] suffer from many provisions in the law , " says Senator [PER Haifa Abu Ghazaleh  ] , who also serves as the Secretary General of the [ORG National Council for Family Affairs  ] . 
She cites the many foreign laborers from [LOC Egypt  ] and elsewhere in the [MISC Arab  ] world who have lived in [LOC Jordan  ] for long periods of time and are married to [MISC Jordanian  ] women , but whose children are not entitled to [MISC Jordanian  ] citizenship . 
Like many of our contacts , [PER Abu Ghazaleh  ] theorizes that until the [MISC Palestinian  ] question is solved in [LOC Jordan  ] , changes to the citizenship law are basically impossible . 
" We are waiting for the [MISC Palestinian  ] issue to be solved . 
It won't be solved . 
Nobody here wants it to be solved , " she complains ( Ref C ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Asma Khader  ] , Secretary General of the [ORG National Commission for Women  ] ( and a former government spokesperson ) , is less concerned about the [MISC Palestinian  ] factor , and more concerned about the message being sent to [MISC Jordanian  ] women about their role in society . 
" It 's not just about politics , it 's about patriarchy , " she says . 
[PER Khader  ] posits that the lack of an egalitarian citizenship law shows that women are second class citizens in [LOC Jordan  ] , regardless of their political class or national origin . 
[PER Eva Abu Hawaleh  ] disagrees - she asserts that " it 's not gender politics . 
The assumption is that men from the [LOC West Bank  ] would pour over the border to marry [MISC Jordanians  ] . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) " This is an issue for all women 's groups in [LOC Jordan  ] , " [PER Khader  ] says . 
" We thought domestic violence would be the number one issue among women , but it isn't . 
Citizenship rights are the number one issue for women in [LOC Jordan  ] . 
" Yet the [ORG National Commission for Women  ] is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to lobbying for amendments to the citizenship law . 
According to [PER Khader  ] , it receives floods of petitions from [MISC Jordanian  ] women asking for intervention with the authorities on their behalf . 
Yet there is very little that the commission can do , other than express concerns to the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] and lobby the King and parliament for changes to the law . 
Those efforts have had mixed results at best: " His Majesty is very interested ( in changes to the law ) , but the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] is blind . 
They don't want to recognize this problem . 
" [PER Khader  ] says that even studying the problem is politically impossible , as the government is unlikely to cooperate in counting the numbers of women who are impacted by the law 's current provisions . 
Working the System ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) When asked about the possibility of a new citizenship law which would clarify the situation , the responses of parliamentarians range from deeply pessimistic to bluntly dismissive . 
[ORG MP Reem Qassem  ] , who was elected via the quota for women , calls the ability of [MISC Jordanian  ] women to transmit citizenship to their children " a right , " but acknowledges that the issue is highly politicized . 
She holds out little hope of action during the current session of parliament . 
" We can't do it now , " says [ORG MP Nasser Al-Qaisi  ] . 
He and other contacts talk about a worst case scenario in which hundreds of thousands of new [MISC Jordanians  ] are created overnight - [MISC Jordanians  ] who will require services and representation from an already stretched government . 
While recognizing that the issue is out there , [MISC Qaisi  ] notes that it is either low or absent from the government 's priority list . 
[ORG MP  ] [PER Fayez Al-Shawabkeh  ] put forth the novel argument that with rising levels of government support to [MISC Jordanian  ] families to offset rising prices , [LOC Jordan  ] could not afford to take on additional citizens. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) On February 23 , a group of women 's rights activists and female parliamentarians met with Prime Minister [PER Dahabi  ] to express their support for changes in [LOC Jordan  ] 's citizenship law , among other issues . 
While the group was well-received , the outcome of the meeting failed to point to concrete actions in the near future . 
Commenting in the [ORG Jordan Times  ] after the meeting , activist [PER Amneh Zu'bi  ] stated that , " every time we meet with a Prime Minister , we receive positive responses to our demands . 
But in reality , we do not sense any tangible changes . 
" Activists and parliamentarians complained in the article that changes demanded by women are " locked in the government 's drawers . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Women 's rights activists in [LOC Jordan  ] assert that a brand new citizenship law may not , in fact , be necessary . 
Rather , they believe that the current law is permissive enough , but simply not applied - hence the calls by Queen [PER Rania  ] and others for broad implementation of " humanitarian provisions " in the existing law which allow the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] to approve citizenship transmittal in individual cases . 
" They just have to implement the law and the constitution , " says activist [PER Fawzi Samhouri  ] . 
He adds that , as a party to the [LOC International Covenant  ] on Civil and Political Rights , [LOC Jordan  ] has a responsibility to treat the sexes equally when it comes to citizenship rights . 
Even so , [PER Samhouri  ] acknowledges that " rights in [LOC Jordan  ] are subject to the approval of ministers - they aren't automatic . 
" <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Asma Khader  ] is of the opinion that " [MISC Jordanians  ] are [MISC Jordanians  ] wherever they are born , " and that the citizenship of children who should by all rights be [MISC Jordanian  ] transcends identity politics . 
Yet she is pragmatic , and is willing to accept even a half solution if it leads to progress on the issue . 
[PER Khader  ] points to the three year residency requirements for wives of [MISC Jordanian  ] men , and wonders if such a provision could be extended to children as well - thereby cementing their [MISC Jordanian  ] identity . 
Many of our civil society contacts share her view that compromise is possible on the issue , as long as the root problem of divided families is addressed somehow. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Contacts in civil society are working behind the scenes for either implementation of current statutes or a clarification of the law itself , but hold out little hope that change will happen soon . 
[PER Fawzi Samhouri  ] notes that even the female members of parliament have done a poor job of addressing the issue , and cannot be relied upon to take action: " Women parliamentarians alone can't be advocates of this kind of change . 
Civil society has to take that responsibility . 
" [PER Asma Khader  ] and [PER Eva Abu Hawaleh  ] raise the issue constantly in meetings with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , and pressure the government for action in specific cases . 
Yet they cannot obtain results . 
" It 's not a legal issue . 
It 's a wasta ( " influence peddling " ) issue . 
These women have no wasta , " [PER Abu Hawaleh  ] admits . 
Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Whether changes come through legal clarification or changes in implementation , this seems to be a case where even the royal family has difficulty in turning the ship of state in a favorable direction . 
While the issue is on its surface a gender concern , it is more fundamentally about identity politics in [LOC Jordan  ] . 
The assumption that the majority of beneficiaries would be [MISC Palestinians  ] prevents change from taking place . 
The security needs of the state ( i.e. , to prevent a takeover of the [LOC East Bank-dominated  ] political and security establishment ) are the trump card that thwarts even much-needed changes in the law or administrative practice . 
It matters little whether the threat is perceived or real ; creating political will that can stand up to the demography argument is nearly impossible in [LOC Jordan  ] - even for the King . 
In spite of the Queen 's statements and direct lobbying by civil society to the monarch himself with subsequent talk of action , change remains elusive . 
Grassroots action aimed at the implementing authorities in the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] is similarly unfruitful . 
The category of needed legal changes which touch on the [MISC Palestinian  ] issue in [LOC Jordan  ] is waiting for one thing , and one thing only: a solution to the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict .
