( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: [MISC Anti-Palestinian  ] hooliganism and slogans denigrating the [MISC Palestinian  ] origins of both the Queen and the [MISC Crown  ] Prince led to the cancellation of a July 17 soccer game between the rival [ORG Faisali  ] and [ORG Wahdat  ] clubs , who traditionally represent the [LOC East Banker  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] communities , respectively . 
Matches between the two teams have a long history of violence , but the specific digs at the royal family marked a new low . 
The clubs have been fined and their fans publicly chastised , yet official media reporting and commentary has been noticeably thin . 
The game exposed the growing rift between [LOC East Bankers  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] in [LOC Jordan  ] . 
The [MISC King’s  ] silence on the event is noteworthy , as is a reluctance among our contacts to discuss the issue . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Faisali  ] 0 , [ORG Wahdat  ] 0 , PPD ( Riot ) ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Jordanian  ] police intervened to stop fan violence and the chanting of anti-regime slogans during a July 17 match between [LOC Amman  ] soccer clubs [ORG Faisali  ] and [ORG Wahdat  ] in the industrial town of [LOC Zarqa  ] . 
The unrest began when [ORG Faisali  ] fans started to chant slogans against [MISC Palestinian-origin Jordanians  ] , including Queen [PER Rania  ] . 
Some [ORG Faisali  ] fans threw bottles at [ORG Wahdat  ] players and their fans . 
The coaches of both teams ordered their players off of the field in the middle of the game for their own safety , and the remainder of the match was canceled . 
( Note: It ended in a scoreless draw . 
End Note . 
) A Storied Rivalry ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [ORG Faisali  ] and [ORG Wahdat  ] serve as the proxy champions of the [LOC East Banker  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] communities , respectively . 
[ORG Faisali  ] , whose name refers to the [MISC Hashemite  ] King [PER Faisal  ] , is controlled by a prominent tribe ( the ‘Udwan ) which hails from the [LOC East Banker  ] stronghold of [LOC Salt  ] . 
It is known as the favored team of tribal [LOC East Bankers  ] , even though many of its players are of [MISC Palestinian  ] origin . 
Since the formation of the [ORG Jordanian Football Union  ] ( [ORG JFU  ] ) in 1944 , [ORG Faisali  ] has won thirty national championships. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Wahdat  ] , which takes its name from the large [MISC Palestinian  ] refugee camp on the southern side of [LOC Amman  ] , is seen as the favored team of [MISC Palestinian-origin Jordanians  ] . 
[ORG Wahdat  ] has won eleven national soccer championships since 1944 , including the last three . 
The club’s current president is [PER Tareq Khoury  ] , a successful businessman who allegedly bought his seat on the [ORG Wahdat  ] board . 
He has since leveraged that position into a political career , and was elected to the [ORG Lower House of Parliament  ] in 2007 . 
Game Over --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Faisali-Wahdat games have a long history of hooliganism and politically motivated violence . 
Past matches have been shut down by the police following riots spurred by offensive slogans shouted by both sides . 
Those slogans have over time become a popular barometer of tensions between [LOC East Bankers  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
The slogans and cheers on the [ORG Faisali  ] side during the July 17 match were particularly divisive and controversial , as they were directed at members of the royal family for the first time . 
[ORG Faisali  ] supporters chanted about the [MISC Palestinian  ] origins of Queen [PER Rania  ] with the cheer , “divorce her you father of [PER Hussein  ] , and we’ll marry you to two of ours.” The newly appointed [MISC Crown  ] Prince did not escape comment either , as he is half [MISC Palestinian  ] ( and one quarter [MISC British  ] ) himself . 
Official Fallout ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Official reaction to the match was surprisingly pro-forma . 
Prince [PER Ali  ] , half-brother to the King and chairman of the [ORG Jordanian Football Union  ] ( [ORG JFU  ] ) , issued a statement calling the behavior of [ORG Faisali  ] fans “unacceptable” and “a red line.” In addition to a relatively meager 5000 JD ( USD 7000 ) fine on [ORG Faisali  ] , the [ORG JFU  ] indicated that larger security restrictions would be placed on future games . 
Members of parliament also sent a missive to the press denouncing the chants of [ORG Faisali  ] supporters as “contrary to [MISC Jordanian  ] values.” The statement was read by [ORG MP  ] and [ORG Wahdat  ] president [PER Tareq Khoury  ] on the floor of parliament . 
The [ORG Faisali  ] club issued a press release of its own , promising to identify the “outcasts” among its fans and deal with them accordingly . 
Media Silence , Internet Cacophony [ORG AMMAN  ] 00001689 002 OF 002 --------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite all of the official condemnations of [ORG Faisali  ] and its supporters , none of [ORG Jordan’s  ] self-censoring media featured descriptive news stories about the game and why it was called off . 
Columnists and commentators , even those who are usually used to advance pro-government views , were noticeably silent . 
The heads of the [ORG Faisali  ] and [ORG Wahdat  ] fan clubs were allegedly invited to appear on [LOC Al-Jazeera  ] , but refused in recognition of the sensitivities surrounding criticism of the royal family. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Internet news sites , however , were full of commentary on the game and its implications . 
Many defended the [ORG Faisali  ] supporters as “real” [MISC Jordanians  ] fighting against undue [MISC Palestinian  ] influence . 
Some commentators believe that Prince [PER Ali  ] failed to remain neutral in the conflict by only chastising [ORG Faisali  ] supporters , and called for [ORG Wahdat  ] to receive similar opprobrium . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) There is broad recognition throughout [LOC Jordan  ] that the Faisali-Wahdat incident exposed the uncomfortable gap between [LOC East Bankers  ] and [MISC Palestinian-origin Jordanians  ] -- one that most would rather keep well-hidden for the sake of political stability . 
The connection between this rift and the [MISC Hashemite  ] monarchy , including the newly-appointed [MISC Crown  ] Prince , makes the incident even more unsettling . 
Even our most forthcoming contacts are reluctant to talk with us about the issue , recognizing that it strikes at the core of [MISC Jordanian  ] identity politics . 
One contact reluctantly admitted that the game brought out the “ugly side of [MISC Jordanian  ] ultranationalism” and said that it would be difficult to contain now that it was publicly expressed . 
Another pointed to the “increasingly explicit and provocative” [ORG Faisali  ] slogans as proof that status quo-oriented [LOC East Bankers  ] are uncomfortable with the increasing pressures for reform that will inevitably lessen their near-monopoly on political and social power. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC King’s  ] silence on the game and its political implications is deafening . 
High level government contacts and members of the diplomatic community are puzzled by the [MISC King’s  ] failure to respond to a verbal attack on his family that also dips in to [MISC Jordanian  ] identity politics . 
While he is on “internal vacation” in the southern part of [LOC Jordan  ] , the [MISC King’s  ] public exposure has been limited to meetings with scattered foreign officials . 
While perhaps unintentional , the [MISC King’s  ] silence has effectively empowered the pro-status quo establishment .
