The [ORG GOL  ] continues to adhere to restrictive visa issuance policies vis-a-vis [MISC Americans  ] , including an apparent virtual ban on tourist visas for [MISC Americans  ] , lengthy delays and exorbitant fees for [MISC American  ] business people , and a long record of visa refusals for [MISC USG-sponsored  ] visitors for academic , cultural , science , economic , and other programs . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has agreed , in principle , to the idea of forming a bilateral visa working group to resolve these issues , including visa reciprocity . 
During a July 6 meeting with the Ambassador , [PER Musa Kusa  ] maintained that visas for [MISC Americans  ] would continue to receive the most scrutiny of any foreign visitors to the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] , for security reasons . 
Your underscoring for the [MISC Libyans  ] that the current imbalance in visa issuance is not sustainable will show your interlocutors that the issue has been raised to high levels in [LOC Washington  ] . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) An ostensibly related issue involves the treatment of [MISC Libyan  ] travelers at [LOC U.S.  ] ports of entry , particularly [MISC Libyan  ] officials , who are routinely separated from other passengers at ports of entry and questioned extensively about their travel . 
[ORG GOL  ] officials , who view the issue as a personal affront , will raise it with you . 
[PER Musa Kusa  ] and [PER UNPermREP Shalgham  ] are only two of the several high level [MISC Libyan  ] officials who have been " mistreated " at our ports of entry , and their experiences have engendered deep resentment here . 
Your recent letter to [ORG DHS  ] described the issue well ; we believe that we will not be able to make significant process on visa reciprocity until we make some headway here . 
A [ORG DHS  ] delegation is scheduled to visit [LOC Tripoli  ] in late July to address treatment of [MISC Libyan  ] officials at [LOC U.S.  ] ports of entry/NSEERS issues with [ORG GOL  ] counterparts , among other issues . 
However , the [ORG GOL  ] has not yet granted visas to the delegation . 
TRADE AND INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG USTR  ] has been working with the [ORG GOL  ] to finalize a [ORG TIFA  ] text for over a year . 
The [ORG GOL  ] last invited Emboffs to review the draft text on November 24 , 2008 . 
Despite post 's attempts to discuss [ORG TIFA  ] with [MISC Libyan  ] trade officials at every possible opportunity , the text has languished on the [MISC Libyan  ] side . 
We would like to press the [ORG GOL  ] to sign a [ORG TIFA  ] as soon as possible . 
We concur with [ORG USTR  ] view that the signing should take place even in light of renewed problems regarding [ORG Caterpillar  ] and potential problems involving the [ORG Chevrolet  ] dealership . 
We may have a better hand to play on these issues when we can argue them out in this formal framework . 
[ORG MEGRAHI  ] 8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [PER Megrahi  ] case is likely to be an agenda item for your interlocutors . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] raised the issue during his July 9 meeting with [ORG UK PM Gordon Brown  ] , and recent press reports suggest that [PER Megrahi  ] 's physical condition is deteriorating ( although the [ORG UK Embassy  ] was not able to corroborate such reports during a July 19 meeting with the [ORG CDA  ] ) . 
If the issue is raised , we recommend that you remind [MISC Libyan  ] officials that the decision to allow a [ORG Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] ( [ORG PTA  ] ) for [PER Megrahi  ] is a matter for the [ORG Scottish Government  ] to decide . 
[ORG UK Embassy  ] officials believe that a [ORG PTA  ] decision could be forthcoming in mid-August . 
We defer to the Department 's view on a possible request for [PER Megrahi  ] 's compassionate release . 
[ORG REGIONAL ISSUES  ] 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While [LOC Libya  ] 's regional focus at present seems to have concentrated primarily on its pan-African agenda , [PER Qadhafi  ] has skillfully leveraged the [ORG AU Chairmanship  ] to ingratiate himself with [MISC European  ] and [MISC South American  ] leaders - most recently [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] . 
His visits to [LOC Moscow  ] , [LOC Madrid  ] , [LOC Paris  ] , [LOC Lisbon  ] , and [LOC Rome  ] have afforded him opportunities to sign military-to-military agreements and to engage on civil-nuclear issues , as well as to negotiate commercial energy and investment deals . 
He has even exploited [ORG EU  ] , especially [MISC Italian  ] , concerns about illegal immigration to press forward his security and political agendas . 
As [PER Qadhafi  ] 's engagement as an [MISC African  ] leader has expanded , he has notably decreased his efforts in the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
Nevertheless , he continues to tout his vision for a one-state solution between the [MISC Israelis  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] - " [MISC Isratine  ] " - including during his May meeting with AFRICOM Commander General [PER Ward  ] . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] will appreciate anything you can relate regarding the work of Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] and how we see Administration policy playing out in the peace process. *********************** * Missing Section 003 * *********************** 0 07/20/2009 4953 PREL , PGOV , MARR , MASS , PHUM , ETRD , ABLD , CVIS , LY , [ORG UN  ] 217296 [MISC Libyan  ] visa problems 217296 7/20/2009 10:25 09SECTION02OF03QRIPOLI583 Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] SECRET//NOFORN 09TRIPOLI7200583 VZCZCXRO1456OO RUEHBC RUEHDE RUEHDH RUEHKUK RUEHROVDE RUEHTRO #0583/02 2011025ZNY SSSSS ZZHO R 201025Z JUL 09FM AMEMBASSY TRIPOLITO RUEHC/SECSTATE WASHDC IMMEDIATE 5051INFO RUEHEE/ARAB LEAGUE COLLECTIVERUEHRO/AMEMBASSY [LOC ROME  ] 0530RHEHAAA/NSC [LOC WASHINGTON  ] DCRUCNDT/USMISSION USUN [LOC NEW YORK  ] 0203RUEHTRO/AMEMBASSY [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 5590 S E C R E T SECTION 02 OF 03QRIPOLI 000583 NOFORN SIPDIS DEPT FOR [ORG NEA ACTING A/S FELTMAN  ] ; ALSO PM/RSAT ( MMILLER ) , T/QN , NEA/MAG , [ORG DRL/NESCA E.O.  ] 12958: [ORG DECL:  ] 7/20/2019 [ORG TAGS:  ] <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/MARR_0.html'>MARR</a> <a href='/tag/MASS_0.html'>MASS</a> <a href='/tag/PHUM_0.html'>PHUM</a> <a href='/tag/ETRD_0.html'>ETRD</a> <a href='/tag/ABLD_0.html'>ABLD</a> <a href='/tag/CVIS_0.html'>CVIS</a> <a href='/tag/LY_0.html'>LY</a> <a href='/tag/UN_0.html'>UN</a> 6 .
