Summary: March 21 press coverage of the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to remove most assets from the base at [LOC Keflavik  ] was punctuated by PM [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's statement that the [LOC U.S.  ] decision had created a " climate of distrust between the two countries .

Summary of report in March 21 news daily " Morgunbladid " and March 20 Morgunbladid website report: Almost three hundred [LOC Keflavik  ] region residents attended a meeting Monday evening where PM [PER Asgrimsson  ] spoke about the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] from the base at [LOC Keflavik  ] . 
The PM said there were three tasks ahead following the [LOC US  ] decision: negotiations with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Iceland  ] 's future defense , [LOC Iceland  ] needing to assume responsibility for additional operations at [LOC Keflavik Airport  ] , and addressing the general employment situation in the region . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] said President [PER Bush  ] had conveyed a firm intention to meet [LOC U.S.  ] obligations under the bilateral defense agreement and the [ORG NATO  ] pact , and that it now remained to be seen whether [LOC Iceland  ] could rely on that [LOC U.S.  ] commitment . 
" It is obvious that a climate of distrust has been created between the two countries , given the way in which these issues have been handled over the last few days , and it remains to be seen whether it will be possible to reestablish trust between [LOC Iceland  ] and the [LOC United States  ] with [ORG NATO  ] assistance " , [PER Asgrimsson  ] said , adding that some have suggested that the defense agreement should now be cancelled . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] said that [LOC U.S.  ] proposals for a replacement defense arrangement have not been forthcoming . 
" We have never refused changes , but have so far not received any proposals as to what exactly should replace the existing capabilities . 
" Concerning his recent phone conversation with [ORG NATO  ] SECGEN [PER Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] , [PER Asgrimsson  ] said [PER Scheffer  ] had told President [PER Bush  ] in their [LOC Washington  ] meeting on Monday that this was not only an issue for [LOC Iceland  ] but also for the 26 [ORG NATO  ] nations including the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] quoted [PER Scheffer  ] as saying " [ORG NATO  ] has obligations to [LOC Iceland  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] has responsibilities to [ORG NATO  ] . 
Thus the [MISC Iceland-U.S  ] . 
Defense agreement is a part of the defense readiness of the whole Alliance . 
" President [PER Bush  ] told him that the issue had been decided , and called it modernization of the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] would soon present its proposals as to how to achieve that . 
The PM said he and [PER Scheffer  ] had agreed it is necessary to wait and see what the [LOC U.S.  ] proposals will contain , and to subsequently review those ideas within [ORG NATO  ] . 
" In an earlier conversation he ( [PER Scheffer  ] ) said to me that he intended to visit [LOC Iceland  ] in the fall , but I emphasized that I thought that an earlier visit is required for consultations on the issue . 
He promised to come as soon as possible , " [PER Asgrimsson  ] said. --------------------------------------------- -------------- Justice Minister 's Comments at [ORG Political Science Conference  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Summary of Report in March 21 news daily " Morgunbladid " : Speaking at a conference of the [ORG Association of Political Scientists  ] , Justice Minister [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] said things must be arranged in such a way that attacking [LOC Iceland  ] would not be something anyone would attempt without very careful preparation , knowing that they would meet resistance and that the country would not be easy prey . 
Continuing , he said that from the government 's perspective , the most important task is to fill the gap that will be left with the departure of the helicopters . 
They were the visible symbol of national defense and the aspect of operations at [LOC Keflavik Airport  ] that affected Icelanders most . 
At the same time , [PER Bjarnason  ] said it was not unexpected that the squadron was leaving , as the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] had proposed that [LOC Iceland  ] should take over these operations . 
[PER Bjarnason  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] decision had not only provoked discussion of [LOC Iceland  ] 's situation with respect to security and defense , but it also concerns neighboring countries on the eastern side of the [LOC Atlantic  ] . 
He said that in his opinion there should be an agreement with [LOC Denmark  ] on rescue missions and security in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] , adding that the [LOC United Kingdom  ] and [LOC Norway  ] would also be considering how security could best be guaranteed in the region. --------------------------------------------- ------------ [ORG Editorial Criticizes Characterization of Base Pull-out  ] as Modernizing Defenses ; Emphasizes SECGEN Open to [ORG NATO  ] Role --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Summary of [MISC Op-Ed  ] in March 21 news daily " Morgunbladid " : The [MISC Americans  ] will simply make fools of themselves if they continue using the phrase " modernize the defenses , " while at the same time saying they will leave only insignificant manpower and equipment in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
They have not answered the question as to how they will defend [MISC Icelandic  ] airspace , protection which all [ORG Nato  ] countries believe they require . 
Would people in cities and towns in the [LOC U.S.  ] consider it modernizing their defenses if doing so meant they had no air defense ? 
It is of course positive that the [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General acknowledged [LOC Iceland  ] 's point of view on this whole issue and spoke clearly about [ORG NATO  ] 's responsibility . 
It naturally strengthens the hope that it will be possible to find a solution to [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense needs in cooperation with the alliance as a whole , if negotiations with the [LOC U.S.  ] prove unsuccessful. --------------------------------------------- -------------- [ORG All News Channel Focuses  ] on [MISC Base Being Zeroed  ] out in Budget --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Summary of [ORG NFS TV Evening News Story  ] , March 20: It was clear in February that the [LOC Keflavik  ] base would be closed since the [ORG U.S. Government  ] decided not to fund any operations at the base after October 1st of this year . 
Sources say that this was known as early as the beginning of February and this was the reason why [MISC Iceland-U.S.  ] defense talks were initiated that month . 
President [PER Bush  ] submitted his budget for FY07 to [ORG Congress  ] on February 6 and the [ORG Administration  ] 's budget proposal included not a single dollar for the [LOC Keflavik  ] base . 
Simply put , this means that if funding is to be procured for any operation at [LOC Keflavik  ] after 1 October , those funds must either be taken from other programs or additional funding sought from [ORG Congress  ] . 
A [ORG U.S. Department of Defense  ] spokesman told [ORG NFS News  ] that such a supplementary budget request was highly unlikely . 
[ORG NFS  ] sources say that Foreign Minister [PER Haarde  ] 's meeting with Secretary of State [PER Condoleeza Rice  ] on February 2 , and the [MISC SIPDIS  ] follow-on security talks between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] delegations , were the result of the fact that funding for [LOC Keflavik  ] was eliminated from the President 's budget . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to make a last attempt to see how much [LOC Iceland  ] was willing to contribute to maintain the base . 
The proposal was not adequate and thus the resulting announcement of the base 's closure . 
But a few days after the talks , when the budget was submitted , it should have been clear to the [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities that they had already lost the fight and the base would close before October 1. ---------------------------------------- [MISC French  ] [PER Offer Shoulder  ] , Possibly [LOC Commerce  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Summary of article in March 22 " Morgunbladid " : [MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Philippe Douste-Blazy  ] told [PER Haarde  ] in [LOC Paris  ] 21 March that [LOC France  ] was " concerned " about the situation in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] . 
[PER Haarde  ] told the press , " [LOC France  ] is not indifferent to the situation here in the [LOC North Atlantic  ] , and it is also concerned as a member of [LOC NATO...  ] our intention is to wait and see what the [LOC United States  ] proposes... and then we will discuss the issue with the other [ORG NATO  ] countries in circumstances require... the [MISC French  ] do produce all kinds of equipment for rescue operations , and it is no secret that they are interested in selling it... we do already have [MISC French  ] helicopters for the [ORG Coast Guard  ] .
