<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [ORG BRASILIA  ] 000068 SIPDIS E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 01/13/2019 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/MARR_0.html'>MARR</a> <a href='/tag/ENRG_0.html'>ENRG</a> <a href='/tag/BR_0.html'>BR</a> SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S DEFENSE MINISTER ON FIGHTER COMPETITION , NUCLEAR ENERGY POLICY , FOREIGN POLICY TEAM IIR 6 809 0067 09 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Clifford M. Sobel  ] , Reason 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] 's FX2 fighter competition is between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC France  ] , Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on January 8 . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] 's defense relationship with the [MISC French  ] is prospering because of [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal relationships and involvement . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is looking to advance and coordinate development of nuclear energy by creating a nuclear " czar , " [PER Jobim  ] said , and Energy Minister [PER Edson Lobao  ] , who has emerged from a competitive domestic policy making apparatus as the clear leader on all energy policy matters , will have a lead role on nuclear energy , as well . 
According to [PER Jobim  ] , [PER Lula  ] wants to work with the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] on strategic issues , and as [PER Lula  ] 's most trusted foreign policy advisor , [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] will be a critical player . 
End summary. - - - Fighter Competition between [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) With [LOC Brasilia  ] largely shut down for summer/Christmas holidays , [PER Jobim  ] invited the Ambassador to his home January 8 for a private meeting . 
He told the Ambassador that the FX2 fighter competition is between the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC F-18  ] and the [MISC French  ] [ORG Rafale  ] . 
( [PER Note:  ] the [MISC Swedish  ] Grippen is the third plane in the competition . 
End note . 
) He said that there were three main criteria: price , which was not so important ; technology , which the [MISC F-18 Super  ] Hornet does very well on ( the [MISC Navy  ] " loves " it ; [ORG Air Force  ] chief [PER Juniti Saito  ] " likes " it ) ; and technology transfer , which is the " core " criterion . 
He said tech transfer could extend beyond the plane itself to other possible collaboration , and was excited to hear that [ORG Boeing  ] was working with a [MISC Brazilian  ] company on a UAV , as it might prevent [LOC Brazil  ] having to buy UAVs from [LOC Israel  ] , which had become politically sensitive . 
[PER Jobim  ] plans to talk with [ORG Embraer  ] over the next 30 days to get their views . 
The more [ORG Boeing  ] can do to represent [MISC Brazilian  ] products in the [LOC United States  ] and to allow for transfer of [LOC U.S.  ] technology to [LOC Brazil  ] , the stronger the [LOC U.S.  ] bid will be. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] said that the defense relationship with the [MISC French  ] has prospered because of President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal relationship with [PER Lula  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] had assigned " ownership " of the relationship to his military advisor , and " the embassy just gets in the way . 
" When there is a question about whether technology can be transferred , [PER Sarkozy  ] tells the bureaucracy what to do . 
[PER Jobim  ] said that the defense agreements signed during [PER Sarkozy  ] 's late December visit to [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] were negotiated by the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] . 
Two of the elements were aimed at cooperation on the " soldier of the future " and a border surveillance network . 
The third , related to the fighter competition , was inserted by Defense over the objections of the [ORG Air Force  ] in an effort to spur greater engagement in the competition by the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] . 
( [PER Note: Thus  ] far , all of these agreements exist only on paper . 
End note . 
) - - - [LOC Brazil  ] Reviewing Its Nuclear Energy Policy - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jobim  ] said that key GOB ministers , including [ORG Trade and Development  ] , Science and Technology , Defense , and [ORG Casa Civil  ] ( [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] ) are currently reviewing the GOB 's nuclear energy with a view toward speeding development of clean nuclear energy . 
It is likely that the GOB will appoint a nuclear energy " czar " to oversee the activities of the ministries with nuclear responsibilities , and a retired admiral , [PER Othon Pinheiro  ] da [PER Silva  ] , is the leading candidate for the position . 
More broadly , [PER Jobim  ] said that Energy Minister [PER Edson Lobao  ] , who became Minister in early 2008 when former Energy Minister and current Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] was still widely regarded as the de facto Energy Minister , has now emerged as the leading figure in managing [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy policy , and will have an important role on nuclear energy policy , as well .

( C ) According to [PER Jobim  ] , President [PER Lula  ] wants to engage the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] early on " strategic issues . 
" [PER Jobim  ] said that [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] has a close and long-standing relationship with [PER Lula  ] that makes him " critically important " to [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy decision-making . 
It is also important to [PER Lula  ] that [PER Garcia  ] is well received by the left in [LOC Brazil  ] and the region , which " insulates " [PER Lula  ] . 
Along with Chief of Staff [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] , [PER Garcia  ] stands as one of [PER Lula  ] 's most trusted advisors . 
[PER Jobim  ] added that [PER Lula  ] " uses " Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] , but has no strong personal relationship with him , and " dislikes " Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] . 
Strategic Planning Minister [PER Unger  ] has locked horns with both [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Garcia  ] , [PER Jobim  ] said . 
He noted that [PER Unger  ] cannot take more than two years of leave from [ORG Harvard  ] if he wants to keep his tenure , so will likely leave within the next six months unless he is offered a " bigger opportunity " in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Jobim  ] 's assessments confirm what we are hearing elsewhere on all three counts: that although the [MISC F-18  ] is widely seen as offering the best technology , the [ORG Rafale  ] currently enjoys a political edge because of perceived foreign policy and tech transfer advantages ; that [LOC Brazil  ] is serious about developing its nuclear technologies further ; and that [PER Lula  ] is eager to engage the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] . 
In light of [PER Jobim  ] 's comments regarding [PER Garcia  ] , it does not appear that the fact [PER Garcia  ] ceded management of the recent spate of regional disputes to the more nationalist [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] reflects any loss of confidence by President [PER Lula  ] in [PER Garcia  ] , or a lessening of [PER Garcia  ] 's influence in shaping [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy views .
