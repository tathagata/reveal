REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] promoted traditional [MISC Catholic  ] doctrine on the family and bioethics during his recent visit to [LOC Spain  ] , but opted for respectful dialogue over open attacks against the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's policies on gay marriage , divorce and abortion . 
The pope aimed to pitch his message to the entire [MISC Western  ] world and not just the [MISC Spanish  ] . 
[MISC Vatican-based  ] media and others commented on [MISC Spanish  ] PM [PER Zapatero  ] 's " snub " of a papal mass , but the [LOC Holy See  ] took no offense at his absence . 
[LOC Holy See  ] officials told us that from their perspective the visit was a success , even if challenges remain in [LOC Vatican  ] - [LOC Spain  ] relations . 
End Summary. ------------------------------------- Calls to [LOC Strengthen Family  ] and Morals ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] traveled to [LOC Spain  ] in early July for the [LOC Vatican  ] 's [MISC World Meeting of Families  ] , setting the stage for potential conflict between the [LOC Holy See  ] and a [MISC Spanish  ] government that has irritated the [LOC Vatican  ] with its positions on some " life and family issues " ( reftel ) . 
In the event , [PER Benedict  ] did not shy away from comments on same-sex marriage , abortion , and genetic research , but the comments were not so much finger-wagging at the [MISC Spanish  ] government , as a message aimed at the [MISC Western  ] world in general . 
[PER Benedict  ] has prioritized a battle against what he sees as the [MISC Western  ] world 's embrace of relativism and radical secularism , charging that the [LOC West  ] has forgotten the social adhesion provided by traditional Christian/moral values. -------------- New Compendium -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The pope 's visit coincided with the release of a new compendium of [MISC Catholic  ] doctrine on the family . 
Issued by the [ORG Pontifical Council  ] for the Family ( this year celebrating its 25th anniversary ) , the document encourages traditional family life centered on a married heterosexual couple and their children , and condemns same-sex marriage , divorce , abortion and artificial contraception. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) More aggressive proponents of the lines reinforced by the document include [ORG Council  ] for the Family President Cardinal [PER Alfonso Lopez Trujillo  ] , who recently sounded off against embryonic stem-cell research , threatening excommunication for the researchers , health professionals and women involved . 
[MISC American  ] Cardinal [PER William Levada  ] , Prefect of the [LOC Vatican  ] 's theological body , has urged lawmakers to stand firm on issues such as same-sex marriage and the liberalization of legislation on abortion and divorce. ------------------------------------- Pope Tries to Persuade - Not Confront ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In this context , the pope 's tack in [LOC Spain  ] was milder than some expected . 
While making his points on the relevant " family " issues clear , [PER Benedict  ] himself was keen to accent the positive during the conference . 
When asked by reporters about the legalization of gay marriage in [LOC Spain  ] , the pontiff said he preferred to encourage heterosexual families , while at the same time offering help and respect to homosexuals . 
Monsignor [PER Paolo Gualtieri  ] ( protect throughout ) , [LOC Vatican  ] [ORG MFA Country Director for Spain  ] , told us [PER Benedict  ] wanted to avoid direct criticism of the [MISC Spanish  ] government . 
In addition , he addressed , but did not emphasize the hot-button family issues in his private meeting with [MISC Spanish  ] PM [PER Zapatero  ] . 
The pope asked for greater cooperation on those issues ( and the teaching of religion in schools ) , [PER Gualtieri  ] said , but put more emphasis on issues such as immigration , international conflicts and [MISC Africa.  ] ---------------------- [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000141 002.2 OF 002 Is [LOC Spain  ] Worth a Mass ? ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Vatican-based  ] media and others reported " controversy " over PM [PER Zapatero  ] 's decision not to attend the conference 's concluding mass celebrated by the pope . 
[PER Gualtieri  ] told us that the pope was not miffed by [PER Zapatero  ] 's absence . 
If anything , [PER Gualtieri  ] said , [PER Zapatero  ] stayed home to " save the Holy Father potential embarrassment " due to protests or other controversy that may well have occurred had he attended the mass . 
The conference as a whole had the fingerprints of conservative [MISC Catholic  ] group [ORG Opus Dei  ] and several right-leaning [MISC Spanish  ] politicians - few of whom , our contacts emphasized to us , could be counted among [PER Zapatero  ] 's greatest admirers. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Media contacts told us privately that outgoing [LOC Vatican  ] press office chief [PER Joaquin Navarro-Valls  ] ( septel ) purposely played up the " snub " angle . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials confirmed that [PER Navarro-Valls  ] was on his own on this one , and hinted that as a [MISC Spaniard  ] and [ORG Opus Dei  ] member himself , he had become too personally involved in the story . 
[PER Gualtieri  ] noted that the government was in fact represented by two cabinet ministers . 
" There really was no problem [ regarding the mass ] , " he concluded. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Continuing to surprise those who expected him to be a heavy-handed enforcer in the papacy , [PER Benedict  ] has used tact and persuasion rather than fire and brimstone in his battle against relativism and secularism . 
This may not be a fight that the pope can win in [LOC Spain  ] or the rest of [LOC Western Europe  ] , but his current approach may have greater long-term impact than the alternative .
