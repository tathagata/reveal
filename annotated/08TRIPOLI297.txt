[PER PUTIN  ] VISIT EXPECTED IN APRIL <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) While the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] has not received official notification from [LOC Moscow  ] that outgoing President [PER Vladimir Putin  ] will travel to [LOC Libya  ] , [MISC Russian  ] [ORG DCM  ] [PER Anatoly Martinov  ] and [PER Poloff Evgeny Kozlov  ] told [ORG P/E Chief  ] and [PER Poloff  ] on April 3 that the [ORG Embassy  ] expects a visit sometime in April , i.e. , before [PER Putin  ] leaves office in May . 
Though a possible summit between [PER Putin  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar Qadhafi  ] has been the " primary issue " in [MISC Libyan-Russian  ] relations since 2003 , [PER Martinov  ] said preparations have intensified since November 2007 . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] and [PER Putin  ] have spoken by phone three times in the past few weeks . 
He characterized the two leaders as enjoying " relatively good " personal relations , and said [PER Qadhafi  ] made it clear to FM Lavrov during the latter 's December 2007 visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] that he expects a visit from " friend [PER Putin  ] " before his term of office expires . 
Separately , former Congressman [PER Curt Weldon  ] told [ORG P/E Chief  ] on March 31 that [PER Putin  ] was expected to visit [LOC Libya  ] circa mid-April . 
He cited as the source of his information a senior [ORG Rosoboroneksport  ] official who said he would be part of the [MISC Russian  ] presidential delegation . 
A " GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY " FOR A NUCLEAR COOPERATION AGREEMENT <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Martinov  ] , [LOC Russia  ] intends to capitalize on a " golden opportunity " to sign a general framework agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation during [PER Putin  ] 's April visit . 
Cooperation on atomic energy has to date been limited to sales of equipment for [LOC Libya  ] 's experimental reactor facility at [LOC Tajoura  ] , including water management and fire suppression technology . 
Stressing that [LOC Russia  ] " had no particular ( civilian nuclear ) projects in mind " , [PER Martinov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] is ready to sign a nuclear framework agreement that could facilitate future cooperation on power generation and desalinization projects . 
We 've heard from other diplomatic contacts that the [MISC Russians  ] hope to expoit the fact that [MISC French-Libyan  ] civilian nuclear cooperation has not progressed to the [ORG GOL  ] 's satisfaction since a parallel agreement was signed during President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's visit to [LOC Libya  ] last summer ( ref A ) . 
QADHAFI'S SONS PARTICIPATED IN MILITARY EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In the late 1990s , [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Russia  ] established a joint military cooperation council to manage training and equipment sales . 
[LOC Russia  ] 's senior representative on the council , noted [MISC Russian  ] nuclear physicist and author [PER Evgeny Abramyan  ] , has visited [LOC Libya  ] on half a dozen occasions during the past 10 years to discuss ongoing military cooperation . 
Top [MISC Libyan  ] military officials , including two of [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar Qadhafi  ] 's sons - [LOC Muatassim  ] and [LOC Khamis  ] - have studied in [LOC Moscow  ] on GOR-financed MOD educational exchanges . 
( [ORG DAO  ] comment: [LOC Khamis  ] al-Qadhafi spent 14 months in a combined [MISC Russian  ] staff college course especially designed for him and obtained a PhD in military sciences in 2007 . 
[ORG DAO  ] 's contacts have told us that the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG DAO  ] 's office expects [PER Putin  ] 's visit soon , and that the [MISC Russians  ] have threatened to cut off military spare parts sales to [LOC Libya  ] if a major new contract is not signed during [PER Putin  ] 's visit . 
End comment . 
) Stressing that defense cooperation occurs largely outside the purview of [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [PER Martinov  ] characterized [MISC Libya-Russia  ] defense cooperation as good and said the [MISC Libyans  ] appeared " well pleased " with [MISC Russian  ] military equipment . 
Former Congressman [PER Weldon  ] 's [ORG Rosoboroneksport  ] contact said that in addition to an expected civilian nuclear deal , conventional arms sales would be a prominent issue for discussions between [PER Putin  ] and [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
Possible sales of tactical and strategic airlift aircraft and armor , and overhaul of [MISC Libyan  ] naval vessels were specifically mentioned . 
[MISC RUSSIAN  ] COMPANIES ACTIVE IN OIL/GAS AND CONSTRUCTION <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to commercial interests , [PER Martinov  ] noted that [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000297 002.2 OF 002 oil/gas exploration company [ORG Tatneft  ] was moving ahead with seismic exploration of blocks in the [LOC Ghadames  ] and [LOC Sirte  ] basins that it secured in the December 2006 round of the [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] 's Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) bid process . 
( Note: [ORG Tatneft  ] won rights to blocks in area 82 and 98 in the [LOC Ghadames Basin  ] , and area 69 in the [LOC Sirte Basin  ] . 
As reported ref B , [ORG Gazprom  ] won exploration and production rights in the December 2007 [ORG EPSA  ] round for three blocks of area 64 in the [LOC Ghadames Basin  ] . 
End note . 
) A private [MISC Russian  ] company has been awarded a contract to renovate and provide new radar equipment to the [LOC Tobruk  ] airport . 
A [MISC Russian  ] company is also close to signing a contract to construct approximately 300km of a projected 2,000km coastal rail line that would span [LOC Libya  ] from the [MISC Libyan-Tunisian  ] border to the [MISC Libyan-Egyptian  ] border . 
KEY [MISC RUSSIAN  ] POSITIONS VACANT DUE TO VISA PROBLEMS <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kozlov  ] noted that a number of key positions in the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] have remained vacant due to difficulties in obtaining [MISC Libyan  ] visas for PCS staff . 
The Political Counselor slot has been vacant since August 2007 ; the incoming [MISC PolCouns  ] has been unable to obtain a visa . 
[PER Kozlov  ] characterized lengthy waits for [MISC Libyan  ] visas as " routine " for [MISC Russian  ] diplomatic staff .
