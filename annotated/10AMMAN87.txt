( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY: The  ] government of newly appointed Prime Minister [PER Samir Rifai  ] has issued a series of circulars -- policy notices for government offices -- aimed at illustrating a break from the policies of the previous government ( ref a ) . 
One issued on January 4 mandates that government offices display photographs of [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince Hussein  ] ( ref c ) next to [PER King Abdullah II  ] , leaving some wondering if they should remove traditionally displayed photos of the beloved late [PER King Hussein  ] . 
Two anti-corruption policies were also issued , a first step in implementing reforms called for by the [PER King  ] in his designation letter of December 9 ( ref b ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) New photos of the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] , though symbolic , could potentially spark criticism among [ORG East Bank Jordanians  ] that power is subtly shifting towards [MISC Jordanians  ] of [MISC Palestinian  ] origin . 
The anti-corruption moves are welcomed , but many doubt they will be effective in reigning in an entrenched problem viewed with increasing domestic impatience . 
END SUMMARY . 
A New Face on the Wall ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) A government circular issued on January 4 by Prime Minister [PER Rifai  ] 's government directs all public offices to prominently display photos of [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince Hussein  ] bin [PER Abdullah II  ] alongside [PER King Abdullah II  ] . 
Traditionally , photos of the [PER King  ] and his father , the late [PER King Hussein  ] bin [PER Talal  ] have been displayed . 
The circular does not say if the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] 's photo should be added to the mix , or if as some wonder , the late [PER King Hussein  ] 's photo should be taken down to make way for the [MISC Crown  ] Prince. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Either way , the decision could prove to be a controversial one . 
The late [PER King  ] was extremely popular and remains much loved throughout [LOC Jordan  ] nearly eleven years after his death . 
He was particularly well respected among tribal leaders outside [LOC Amman  ] for his careful outreach , attention to rural development , and ability to resolve tribal disputes through personal intervention -- all areas where the current [PER King  ] is perceived as weak or uninterested. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) By contrast , [ORG East Bank Jordanians  ] , who are overrepresented in [LOC Jordan  ] 's bureaucracy , have been skeptical over the appointment of [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince Hussein  ] for his youth ( he is fifteen ) and his [MISC Palestinian  ] lineage . 
The [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] 's mother , Queen [PER Rania  ] , is [MISC Palestinian  ] . 
His father , [PER King Abdullah II  ] , is himself one-half [MISC British  ] . 
This leaves the [MISC Crown  ] [PER Prince  ] viewed as only one-quarter [MISC Hashemite  ] in some circles . 
[ORG First Step  ] towards [ORG Anti-Corruption Reform  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The new government also issued two anti-corruption policies . 
A circular announced on January 4 instructs government officials not to accept gifts valued over 50 [MISC Jordanian Dinar  ] ( approximately 70 USD ) . 
During the week of December 27 , the government circulated ( but did not formally announce ) a new media policy that precludes public officials from employing journalists or paying for positive coverage . 
In addition , following a visit by Prime Minister [PER Rifai  ] on January 2 , [LOC Jordan  ] 's [ORG Anti-Corruption Commission  ] ( [ORG ACC  ] ) and [ORG Audit Ombudsman Bureau  ] announced a committee to streamline corruption detection and investigation and to encourage whistle-blowing. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The policies are a clear effort by the new government to distance itself from the previous one which was undermined by corruption . 
However , many in [LOC Jordan  ] say that corruption has been rampant throughout successive governments , doubt the new one will be any different , and believe these policies are a paltry response. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In fact , [MISC Jordanians  ] have become so cynical on the subject that they find acts of whistle-blowing laughable . 
For example , [MISC Jordanian  ] media reported on December 24 that a civil servant in the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] was offered a 200 [MISC Dinar  ] reward by the Minister for turning over a 50,000 [MISC Dinar  ] bribe offered by a private company seeking favors . 
The civil servant -- and the Minister 's overture -- were lampooned in [ORG AMMAN  ] 00000087 002 OF 002 on-line commentaries , including by the employee 's co-workers , saying he would have done better to keep the 50,000 .
