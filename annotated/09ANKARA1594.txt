National broadcaster [ORG TRT-TV Online  ] in " [PER Obama  ] 's New Beginning Plan , " notes that " previously , in his June address in [LOC Cairo  ] , President [PER Obama  ] promised to seek a new start to troubled [ORG US  ] relations with the [MISC Islamic  ] world . 
" In " [PER Hillary Clinton  ] Offers [ORG US Aid  ] to Help Boost [MISC Muslim Ties  ] , " [MISC Islamic-oriented  ] Today 's [PER Zaman  ] notes that " taken together the new package pales in comparison to the billions of dollars in aid that [LOC Washington  ] extends to governments in the region , including both [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
" In " New [ORG US Initiative  ] for the [MISC Islamic  ] World , " liberal [ORG Radikal  ] says , " Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , speaking at a development forum in [LOC Marrakesh  ] , announced the new [ORG US  ] initiative with the world 's [MISC Muslims  ] , to promote entrepreneurship , economic development and education . 
" Mainstream Aksam 's online page headlines , " [PER Clinton  ] Holds [ORG Muslim Initiative  ] in [LOC Morocco  ] , " and notes , " [PER Clinton  ] said the programs would aim to encourage scientific and technical collaboration , women 's empowerment and cooperation between faiths . 
" Pundits Take Note of [MISC Turkey-US  ] and Turkey-Iraq Relations [PER Cuneyt Ulsever  ] in mainstream [ORG Hurriyet  ] evaluates [LOC Turkey  ] 's foreign policy and says " I am sure [LOC Turkey  ] will produce independent policies in certain areas , but after [PER Obama  ] was elected as the President and [PER Davutoglu  ] assigned as [MISC Turkish  ] Foreign Minister , [MISC Turkey-US  ] ties started settling on a new axis . 
Within the framework of [PER Obama  ] 's multi-centered politics - which expects active participation from the other countries - [LOC Turkey  ] is playing for the role of the [ORG US  ] Representative in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[ORG US  ] wants to test [LOC Turkey  ] in four areas . 
First of all the [ORG US  ] wants to know whether [LOC Turkey  ] will take over an active role in [LOC Northern Iraq  ] or not . 
Secondly , will [LOC Turkey  ] be able to tame [LOC Iran  ] under US' demands . 
The [ORG US  ] also wants to know whether [LOC Turkey  ] will be able to take [LOC Syria  ] to the US' side . 
And finally , the [ORG US  ] wants to test [LOC Turkey  ] whether it will be able to save [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] from [LOC Iran  ] 's influence . 
If [LOC Turkey  ] passes all these tests without losing or isolating [LOC Israel  ] in the [LOC Middle East  ] completely , then [LOC Turkey  ] will be considered successful , otherwise , we'll go back to [ORG Bush Administration  ] 's period . 
" [PER Sami Kohen  ] in mainstream [ORG Milliyet  ] compares current ties between [LOC Ankara-Irbil  ] , as compared to last year , and says because of [LOC Ankara  ] 's rationalist and pragmatic strategies , [LOC Turkey  ] has improved relations with the [ORG Northern Iraqi Administration  ] .

Good ties with [LOC Northern Iraq  ] is necessary for [LOC Turkey  ] , especially after the [ORG US  ] withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG NGO  ] Goes to [MISC Court Against the Use of  ] [LOC Incirlik Airbase  ] by the [ORG US Papers  ] report that following an application by the Global Peace and [ORG Justice Coalition  ] , a [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG NGO  ] , the [ORG Council of State  ] ( [ORG Danistay  ] ) prosecutor has demanded the annulment of a [ORG Council of Ministers  ] decision made in 2007 to extend the agreement with the [ORG US  ] allowing the use of [LOC Incirlik Airbase  ] for another two years . 
The prosecutor said the approval of the parliament was needed to extend the mandate for using [ORG Incirlik AB  ] . 
He noted that the parliament , and not the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] , was to decide whether to authorize a foreign troop deployment in [LOC Turkey  ] and to use [MISC Turkish  ] facilities . 
[ORG Danistay  ] is expected to make a decision on the issue within a month , according to papers .

" Foreign Ministry officials in both countries and the Ambassadors in two capitals , exert extreme efforts to ease the tensions , however , the remarks of the politicians in both countries , do not help at all . 
We believe that , at this point , President [PER Gul  ] can play the most constructive role to eliminate the tensions .
