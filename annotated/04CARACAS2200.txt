CHAVEZ'S BROTHER , [ORG ADAN  ] , PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN INTRODUCING CHAVEZ TO [PER BRAVO  ] , ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS REPORTS . 
[PER MARKSMAN  ] STATED THAT IT WAS [PER BRAVO  ] , NOT CHAVEZ , WHO DEVELOPED THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION , WHICH IS ROOTED IN THE WORKS OF [PER SIMON RODRIGUEZ  ] , [PER SIMON BOLIVAR  ] , AND [PER EZEQUIEL ZAMORA  ] . 
BRAVO'S MOVEMENT STRESSED THE NEED FOR CIVIL-MILITARY COOPERATION TO IMPLEMENT THE BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION . 
WHILE CHAVEZ BROKE WITH [PER BRAVO  ] IN 1986 , HE MAINTAINED BRAVO'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY , WHICH PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN CHAVEZ'S FAILED COUP IN 1992 .

SHE DESCRIBED THE PRESIDENT AS AN EXCELLENT STORYTELLER , WHO OFTEN CHARACTERIZES HIS OPPONENTS AS DEVILS , WHICH IS A POWERFUL RELIGIOUS SYMBOL AMONG THE POOR . 
WHILE THE EDUCATED CLASS MAY SCOFF AT CHAVEZ'S FIVE-HOUR TELEVISION BROADCASTS , MARKSMAN CLAIMED THAT THE POOR BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS INTERESTED IN THEIR ISSUES .
