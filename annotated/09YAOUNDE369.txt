( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The Government of [LOC Cameroon  ] ( [ORG GRC  ] ) publishes annually the proposed budget as passed by the [ORG National Assembly  ] and approved by the Presidency . 
The published budget allows the public to review some information regarding projected revenues and expenditures , but the [ORG GRC  ] 's actual income and expenditures are believed to vary widely from the publicly announced appropriations , and it is not possible for [MISC Cameroonian  ] citizens to obtain detailed information regarding actual [ORG GRC  ] revenues and expenditures . 
Embassy contacts with expertise in analyzing government budgeting processes indicate that [LOC Cameroon  ] 's ability to track its own budget is among the worst in [LOC Africa  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The following information is keyed to reftel tasking: a . 
The [ORG GRC  ] is already receiving [LOC U.S.  ] foreign assistance funds from the FY09 [MISC SFOAA.  ] b and c . 
The [ORG GRC  ] makes public its annual finance law , which includes projected revenues and expenditures for the coming year . 
This information is published widely in the official and private media . 
[MISC Cameroonian  ] citizens are able to obtain more details regarding the projected budget by purchasing the Official Gazette , which costs about 500 [ORG CFA  ] ( about $1 ) . 
Under the terms of its recently concluded program with the [ORG IMF  ] , the [ORG GRC  ] was publishing quarterly updates on budget execution on a broad level ( ministry by ministry ) . 
The quarterly reports ceased , without explanation , when the [ORG IMF  ] program concluded earlier this year . 
The [ORG GRC  ] also publishes a review of the execution of the previous year 's budget , but this information is available only on a macro level , without details for how funds were spent. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Embassy believes there is significant variance between the projected budget and the budget as it is actually executed . 
Embassy contacts tell us that the [ORG GRC  ] does not have the capacity to track its own budget execution because there is no interface among various computer programs used by the [ORG Office of the Budget  ] ( which plans the budget ) and the [ORG Office of the Treasury  ] ( which spends the money ) , meaning even the Minister of Finance is incapable of giving a detailed account for how funds were spent . 
Additionally , numerous civil society organizations have reported difficulty in obtaining detailed expenditure information for their efforts to track budget execution in certain localities or in certain sectors . 
For many years , the [ORG GRC  ] was engaging in off-budget spending , including especially use of oil revenues to finance security and defense projects . 
This practice was increasingly reduced during the [ORG GRC  ] 's participation in the [ORG IMF  ] program , but recent reports indicate the [ORG GRC  ] is again spending substantial sums " off-budget . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
Post is supportive of this effort to encourage transparency in the budget process . 
We believe it would be counterproductive to cut off FY09 assistance , largely because such a precipitous decision will be poorly understood by the [ORG GRC  ] officials we are trying to influence . 
We might , however , use this opportunity to inform the [ORG GRC  ] of the risk of losing future assistance if steps are not taking to improve tracking and transparency in the budget planning and execution phases . 
End comment .
