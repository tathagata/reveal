( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a meeting with the [LOC Charg  ] ? ? ? ? d'Affaires , a.i. , [PER Lisa Kubiske  ] on January 19 , [LOC Brazil  ] 's coordinator for [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC Haiti  ] emergency relief effort , Minister [PER Jorge Armando Felix  ] , head of the [ORG Institutional Security Cabinet  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) at the [LOC Presidency  ] , said he was pleased with bilateral coordination and relayed a request from the military to place a liaison officer with the [LOC U.S.  ] unit managing the airport to ensure coordination on [MISC Brazilian  ] flights . 
He said that [LOC Brazil  ] would turn distribution of relief supplies over to the [ORG UN  ] , [ORG GOH  ] , or [ORG USG  ] " as soon as the organization is sufficient , " and indicated that he expected to be supervising [LOC Brazil  ] 's relief efforts for some time . 
[PER Felix  ] is planning to visit [LOC Haiti  ] on January 24 , a day after Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] visits . 
In a January 20 discussion , [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Vera Machado  ] did not identify any problems either , but indicated that [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG UN  ] Permanent Representative , [PER Maria Luiza Viotti  ] , had indicated that " more cooperation " is needed . 
Both [PER Felix  ] and [PER Machado  ] said that media were creating problems by playing up small incidents . 
Over the longer term , [LOC Brazil  ] 's cooperation agency ( [ORG ABC  ] ) is interested in partnering with [ORG USAID  ] on post-crisis development projects . 
Post believes that [ORG USG  ] efforts , especially those by SouthCom , to engage the [ORG GOB  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] media have succeeded in reducing perceptions of a lack of coordination , but the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MRE  ] in particular remains sensitive to any perception that its equities are not being considered . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Felix  ] was pleased with the effort to coordinate our emergency assistance efforts ; he said that , from what he knows , there have been very few problems , although the media was at times unhelpful in its portrayal of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts and in playing up problems getting some [MISC Brazilian  ] planes into the airport at [LOC Port  ] au Prince . 
[PER Felix  ] said he had been clear in speaking with the press that there is no question whatsoever of confrontation between our countries , and that in fact the coordination has been excellent . 
( Comment: Most other [ORG GOB  ] contacts are giving us the same message , and recent [ORG GOB  ] comments to the press have generally been very favorable . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked whether there were additional ways we could improve coordination , [PER Felix  ] said the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] was seeking to put in place a " liaison officer " at the airport in [LOC Port  ] au Prince to coordinate [LOC Brazil  ] 's air traffic control needs with [ORG USG  ] controllers . 
( Note: SouthCom has since agreed to this request . 
End note . 
) [PER Felix  ] said that congestion at the airport was " natural " and " to be expected . 
" He did not see this as a major issue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Felix  ] said that [ORG GSI  ] is coordinating [LOC Brazil  ] 's assistance and is the point of contact for the [ORG GOB  ] with the [ORG GOH  ] on their needs . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] is in charge of logistics , [ORG Health Ministry  ] is in charge of medical supplies , [ORG National Integration Ministry  ] ( which oversees [LOC Brazil  ] 's civil defense operation ) is in charge of coordinating provisions of food , water , and shelter ; [ORG GSI  ] is coordinating provisions that don't fit into one of those categories . 
[PER Felix  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] is currently doing its own distribution in-country through [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] and [ORG GOB  ] officials on the ground , but will turn over distribution to the [ORG UN  ] , [ORG GOH  ] , or [ORG USG  ] " once the organization is sufficient . 
" [PER Felix  ] indicated that he would serve as coordinator as long as basic humanitarian needs are still a pressing issue for [LOC Haiti  ] . 
He said he would be pleased to follow up a January 15 discussion between Minister of [ORG Defense Jobim  ] and [ORG CJCS Admiral  ] Mullen by talking with [ORG USAID  ] Administrator [PER Shah  ] about setting up a mechanism to smooth coordination ( Note: The call is scheduled for January 22 at 1530 EST . 
End note . 
) [PER Felix  ] plans to visit [LOC Haiti  ] on Sunday , January 24 , a day after FM [PER Amorim  ] visits . 
[PER Amorim  ] will travel on to [LOC Montreal  ] for the conference of foreign ministers on January 25 . 
[PER Felix  ] is not planning to attend ; however , we have been informed that Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] is considering attending the [LOC Montreal  ] conference along with [PER Amorim.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Note: [ORG GSI  ] is responsible a wide range of security matters , [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000062 002 OF 002 including crisis prevention and management . 
It has served as the primary coordinator of the federal government 's actions during crises in the past . 
Because [ORG GSI  ] is also a part of the [LOC Presidency  ] , it continues to be President [PER Lula  ] 's most immediate and close-to-home resource for handling a crisis of a security nature deemed critical for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Immediately following the earthquake in [LOC Haiti  ] , [PER Lula  ] created a " crisis cabinet " headed by [PER Felix  ] to coordinate [MISC Brazilian  ] assistance to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
End note. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Marco Farani  ] , director of [LOC Brazil  ] 's cooperation agency , [ORG ABC  ] , told [ORG Mission AID  ] Director January 19 that [ORG ABC  ] is not involved in the immediate emergency response . 
[ORG ABC  ] 's projects in [LOC Haiti  ] had been destroyed , and [ORG ABC  ] will want to collaborate with [ORG USAID  ] on post-crisis development projects . 
At present he and several other [ORG MRE  ] officials are attending daily meetings organized by [ORG GSI  ] . 
The [ORG MRE  ] officials involved include Under Secretary for [MISC Latin America  ] Amb . 
[PER Antonio Simoes  ] ( political issues ) , Amb . 
[PER Marcos Pinta Gama  ] ( logistics and [ORG Haiti Crisis Room  ] ) , and [PER Milton Rondo  ] ( humanitarian aid coordinator ) . 
[MISC Pinta Gama  ] told Poloff January 21 that his job is to coordinate within [ORG MRE  ] and with the [MISC Brazilian  ] military on all humanitarian assistance , especially arranging logistics . 
He is also in charge of the repatriation of [MISC Brazilian  ] citizens from [LOC Haiti  ] and assistance to those remaining there . 
He said his work is winding down , with the assistance flights operating " pretty smoothly now . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a meeting with [PER U/S Machado  ] on January 20 , Charge asked her view of coordination between our governments on [LOC Haiti  ] . 
She said she knew of no problems . 
However , she noted that international media coverage has been unhelpful because it is suggesting there is a lack of law and order and that " no one is in charge " when in fact there is no general problem with order and [ORG MINUSTAH  ] is doing its job . 
The Charge noted that we have heard from [LOC Washington  ] there might be concerns in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG UN  ] Mission ; [PER Machado  ] said that [MISC Brazilian  ] Perm [PER Rep Viotti  ] had in fact " stressed a need for further cooperation " in conversations with her. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Efforts by senior [ORG USG  ] officials to engage the [ORG GOB  ] , as well as increased efforts to inform [MISC Brazilian  ] media in the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] , have succeeded in reducing [ORG GOB  ] perceptions of a lack of coordination . 
Efforts by SouthCom to accommodate [MISC Brazlian  ] requests and reach out to media have been particularly effective and helpful in this regard . 
As head of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and a non-permanent member of the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MRE  ] in particular remains sensitive to any perception that [LOC Brazil  ] 's and [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's equities are not being considered .
