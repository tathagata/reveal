End Summary . 
A Friendly Dinner ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador and [PER Mrs. Randt  ] hosted [LOC Beijing  ] Mayor [PER Wang Qishan  ] and his wife for dinner on August 29 to thank the [PER Mayor  ] for his assistance in the city’s making road improvements and supplying permanent power to the [ORG New Embassy Compound  ] . 
The [PER Mayor  ] discussed at length the challenges he faces in governing [LOC Beijing  ] , particularly as it prepares to host the Summer 2008 [MISC Olympic Games  ] , and dismissed rumors that he might be transferred out of [LOC Beijing  ] this fall . 
Mayor Wang’s Future: No Plans to Move ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Responding to gossip reported by [ORG Reuters  ] in April that he might be appointed [ORG Guangdong Province Party  ] Secretary and promoted to the Politburo at this fall’s 17th [ORG Party Congress  ] , [PER Mayor Wang  ] said he “had not heard” any such rumor and planned to be [PER Mayor  ] through the August 2008 [MISC Olympic Games  ] . 
In fact , [PER Wang  ] said , his intention is to “pass the [MISC Olympic  ] torch” to Mayor [PER Ken Livingstone  ] of [LOC London  ] , which will host the next summer [MISC Olympic Games  ] after [LOC Beijing  ] , in January 2009 . 
[MISC Olympics  ] Challenges: Pollution , Transport , Security , [PER Specs  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Mayor [PER Wang  ] described a number of challenges [LOC Beijing  ] faces in hosting the [MISC Olympic Games  ] . 
First and foremost is dealing with air pollution . 
This month’s four-day experiment in which half of Beijing’s cars were kept off the roads based on odd and even license plate numbers was a success , [PER Wang  ] asserted . 
The experiment brought traffic volume down to 2002 levels , resulting in much smoother traffic patterns . 
Given that traffic in the city in 2002 was heavily congested , the experiment’s success demonstrates that the city has constructed a large number of new roads in the last five years . 
Moreover , although he was hesitant to say that [LOC Beijing  ] enjoyed blue skies during the four-day period , taking cars off the road did in fact result in much improved air quality . 
( [PER Note: Per  ] reftel , while the test improved traffic congestion , published pollution data was less conclusive on the amount of reduced pollution attributable to the car-ban . 
Emissions experts doubted the usefulness of such a short-term test to produce accurate conclusions . 
) The city will also bring online five new , clean gas-fired power plants in time for the [MISC Games  ] , [PER Wang  ] continued . 
By that point , [ORG Capital Iron and Steel Works  ] , a significant polluter , will have gone to a “minimal” production schedule , the [PER Mayor  ] explained. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to Beijing’s public transportation system , Mayor [PER Wang  ] said the city has 140 kilometers of subway , but by May 2008 two new subway lines will be completed , including a line that runs north from city hall to the main [MISC Olympic Games  ] site . 
The capital’s new airport monorail will also be finished in time for the [MISC Games  ] . 
Looking beyond the [MISC Olympics  ] , the [PER Mayor  ] described a long-term plan to expand the city’s subway lines to 5,000 kilometers by 2015 , to include satellite parking lots near subway stations around the city perimeter designed to increase dramatically residents’ use of public transportation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Security is another challenge , [PER Wang  ] said , commenting [LOC BEIJING  ] 00005705 002 OF 002 that he greatly appreciates international cooperation on security for the [MISC Games  ] . 
Meeting the “very strict” [ORG IOC  ] specifications for [MISC Olympics  ] venues was another significant issue . 
An example , the [PER Mayor  ] related , is the sand used for the beach volleyball site in the city’s [LOC Chaoyang  ] district , which has to meet exacting requirements for purity and softness . 
In the end , [LOC Beijing  ] had to bring in sand all the way from [LOC Hainan Island  ] in order to meet [ORG IOC  ] specifications . 
( [PER Note: Independently  ] we understand the amount necessary is 17,000 tons . 
) Real Estate Demand Booming -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Mayor [PER Wang  ] was sanguine about the health of the city’s real estate market and dismissed concerns over a bubble , claiming that demand for real estate in [MISC China’s  ] capital is growing . 
Although he expressed concern about the global impact of the subprime mortgage problem , he said he is not worried about the value of the city’s real estate , since very little is purchased for the purpose of speculation . 
For example , the city’s financial district is already completely booked up . 
Newcomer financial institutions like [ORG Deutsche Bank  ] have had to locate their headquarters elsewhere , such as in the [LOC Chaoyang  ] district in [ORG Deutsche Bank’s  ] case , as there is no room remaining for them to build in the financial district . 
Every major successful company in [LOC China  ] , both domestic and international , must have a headquarters in [LOC Beijing  ] . 
For example , [PER Bao Gang  ] steel company of [LOC Shanghai  ] , [MISC China’s  ] largest , is building a new headquarters on [LOC Chang’an Avenue  ] in the center of [LOC Beijing  ] . 
The city has 140 million square meters of internal building space and is adding an additional 30 million square meters per year . 
[LOC Beijing  ] has a “long way to go” to meet the high demand for real estate and office space , Mayor [PER Wang  ] confidently declared . 
It’s Hard Being Mayor --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Though optimistic about his city’s future , [PER Wang  ] lamented that his job as mayor has been grueling . 
As the city’s leader , he has to understand and be able to respond to every issue the city faces , day and night . 
Consequently , he confided , in his four and one-half years as mayor , he has not taken a single vacation .
