Beyrle  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] told visiting [PER Codel Levin  ] April 15 that arms control issues were [LOC Russia  ] 's top priority . 
Noting that [LOC Moscow  ] was waiting for concrete proposals , including specific language , from the [LOC U.S.  ] on a post-START treaty agreement , [PER Lavrov  ] said he recognized that the [LOC U.S.  ] would not want to address the link between offensive and defensive weapons in the post-START negotiations , but it would be important to have such a dialogue in the future . 
[LOC Russia  ] was interested in developing a joint missile defense system ( [LOC MD  ] ) with the [LOC U.S.  ] , but we should start " from scratch , " with joint threat assessments , determination of necessary resources , and best location for [LOC MD  ] assets . 
[PER Lavrov  ] rejected a quid pro quo in which the [LOC U.S.  ] would discontinue its [ORG MD  ] plans for eastern [LOC Europe  ] in exchange for [LOC Russia  ] pressuring [LOC Iran  ] to end its nuclear weapons program , emphasizing that each issue should be considered separately . 
He acknowledged that [LOC Moscow  ] was concerned about [LOC Iran  ] 's longer-range missile development and said [LOC Russia  ] would be prepared to undertake a " dual-track " approach towards [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program ; offering incentives to [LOC Tehran  ] , but keeping in reserve measures within the Agreed [ORG Framework  ] . 
He reconfirmed that [LOC Moscow  ] had suspended the sale of [MISC S-300  ] 's to [LOC Iran  ] " for the moment . 
" In a follow-on meeting , DFM [PER Sergey Ryabkov  ] stressed that while [LOC Russia  ] was interested in working with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC MD  ] , it would be difficult for [LOC Russia  ] to join a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG MD  ] effort that included sites in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , and urged that if the [LOC U.S.  ] intended to pursue sites in [LOC Europe  ] , they should be further west and south , so as to diminish the effect on [MISC Russian  ] capabilities . 
Ryabkov emphasized that " no one can deliver [LOC Iran  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] , except the [LOC U.S.  ] itself , " and argued that , while the [MISC S-300  ] sale was " frozen , " the " less [LOC Moscow  ] heard from [LOC Washington  ] about it , the better . 
" End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Sergey Lavrov  ] in [LOC Moscow  ] April 15 , Chairman of the [ORG Senate Armed Services Committee  ] , [PER Carl Levin  ] ( [MISC D-MI  ] ) , together with [ORG SASC  ] members [PER Bill Nelson  ] ( [MISC D-FL  ] ) and [PER Susan Collins  ] ( [MISC R-ME  ] ) emphasized that they were united in their hope that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] could strengthen their cooperation to address common challenges . 
Noting the [ORG Senate  ] 's [ORG Constitutional  ] role in ratifying treaties and providing advice and recommendations on foreign policy issues to the President , Senator [PER Levin  ] raised missile defense ( [ORG MD  ] ) as an issue that had divided the two countries , but should unite them . 
He suggested that if [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC U.S  ] , could work together on [LOC MD  ] , it would send a powerful message to those who might threaten us , including to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) FM [PER Lavrov  ] welcomed the [ORG Senators'  ] visit , and noted that it was timely , coming two weeks after the first meeting between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] . 
He highlighted the important role " [ORG Parliaments  ] " play in building constructive relationships and expressed the hope that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] could overcome the " inertia " that had characterized the relationship in the past . 
Arms Control , NPT ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] said that arms control issues were [LOC Russia  ] 's top priority . 
The [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] agenda was positive , even though we had differences . 
[LOC Moscow  ] hoped the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] would submit the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] for ratification , and would reconsider sending the " 123 " Agreement to the Hill . 
He welcomed President [PER Obama  ] 's remarks supporting nuclear weapons reductions , saying that such reductions were not just a matter of security for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , but carried a political message that would be important for the 2010 review of the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( NPT ) . 
While characterizing the elimination of nuclear weapons as " a noble goal , " [PER Lavrov  ] said it was not " an immediate project . 
" We needed to have some clear proposals , which would give others a clear idea of the way forward . 
He suggested that the next stage after the post-START negotiations should consider how to engage others , such as the [LOC UK  ] , in discussions of further reductions , as well as looking at tactical nuclear weapons. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There was " a lot to do " on non-proliferation issues , [PER Lavrov  ] said , including [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] was a concern , and we should think about engaging them as well as [LOC India  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] had cooperated to [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001111 002 OF 005 address the danger of non-state actors acquiring nuclear material though programs such as the [ORG Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] and [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] <a id='par1540' href='#par1540'>¶</a>1540 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] should also look at ways to strengthen the NPT regime , including how to universalize the Additional Protocol . 
We should also work on issues like fuel supply , the [ORG Nuclear Fuel Center Russia  ] had started , and programs like the [ORG Global Nuclear Energy Partnership  ] . 
Post-START ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] expressed appreciation for the [ORG Senate  ] 's confirmation of [PER Rose Gottemoeller  ] as A/S for VCI , noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] had a lot of work to do to achieve a follow-on agreement to the [LOC START Treaty  ] . 
The issue would be discussed at the meeting between DVBR Director [PER Anatoliy Antonov  ] and [PER A/S Gottemoeller  ] in [LOC Rome  ] on April 24 , as well as in his meeting with the Secretary in [LOC Washington  ] in May . 
The teams would report to the Presidents in July , and hope to reach a framework agreement by the end of the year . 
He said that while the Presidents in their statement April 1 had endorsed reductions below the [ORG Moscow Treaty  ] limits and had agreed to use many of the verification procedures of the [LOC START Treaty  ] , [LOC Moscow  ] was waiting for more concrete proposals from the [LOC U.S.  ] , including specific language. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] highlighted the April 1 Joint Statement 's reference to the link between offensive and defensive weapons , saying that the balance between the two that had existed in the [LOC Soviet Union  ] had been thrown off kilter when the [LOC U.S.  ] withdrew from the [LOC ABM Treaty  ] . 
He stressed that he recognized this did not mean the [LOC U.S.  ] would support addressing the linkage during the post-START negotiations , but it was important to have a discussion on it at some point in the future . 
Missile Defense and [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Levin  ] said the [ORG SASC  ] was interested in exploring the possibility of [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] working together on [LOC MD  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was focused on the threat from [LOC Iran  ] , but he recognized that [LOC Russia  ] may have a broader perspective . 
However , we were both opposed to a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] , which would be able to put pressure on other countries in the region . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] also perceived the possibility of an [MISC Iranian  ] long-range missile as a threat . 
He noted that press reports indicated that [PER Medvedev  ] had told [PER Henry Kissinger  ] and the [ORG Hart-Hagel Commission  ] that he was concerned that the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program was more of a threat than [LOC Russia  ] had previously believed . 
( [PER Lavrov  ] emphatically corrected this , saying [PER Medvedev  ] had expressed concern about [LOC Iran  ] 's missile launch ) . 
Noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] had made commitments to [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , Senator [PER Levin  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] would need to consider how to keep those commitments and include [LOC Europe  ] in a common [LOC MD  ] program with [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Agreeing that [LOC MD  ] should unite the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , rather than divide us , [PER Lavrov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] was interested in developing a [LOC MD  ] system with the [LOC U.S.  ] , but the [LOC U.S.  ] proposals for an [LOC MD  ] system in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] ( " 3rd [PER Site  ] " ) , disrupted the balance between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] 's nuclear potential . 
He stressed that then-President [PER Putin  ] 's [LOC Kennebunkport  ] proposal for a cooperative [LOC MD  ] effort using [MISC Russian  ] resources , joint analyses and determinations of the threat , and data exchange centers , was still on the table . 
He welcomed President [PER Obama  ] 's statement that if the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue were resolved satisfactorily , there would be less need for the 3rd [PER Site  ] , but took care to emphasize that [LOC Russia  ] did not support a quid pro quo between [LOC Russia  ] helping to get [LOC Iran  ] to end its nuclear weapons program and the [LOC U.S.  ] discontinuing its deployment in eastern [LOC Europe  ] . 
These two issues should be dealt with separately , on their own merits , [PER Lavrov  ] stressed. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Noting that the [ORG Congressional Budget Office  ] had presented three alternatives on the [LOC MD  ] project , [PER Lavrov  ] said this showed there were issues with the proposal . 
Hastening to add that [LOC Russia  ] did not endorse any of the three alternatives , [PER Lavrov  ] commended the [ORG Administration  ] 's intent to review them , noting this was the difference with the new [ORG Administration:  ] it was willing to listen and take the time to analyze the alternatives , instead of saying " this is what [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001111 003 OF 005 must be done ; everyone must say yes sir . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In response to Senator 's [PER Levin  ] question why [LOC Russia  ] was not more concerned about [LOC Iran  ] 's missile capabilities , since [LOC Russia  ] was closer to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Lavrov  ] said [LOC Moscow  ] was " not complacent ; we are closer . 
" But whenever [MISC Russian  ] negotiators had protested to the [LOC U.S.  ] side that the proposed radar could cover [LOC Russia  ] up to the [ORG Urals  ] and the interceptors could reach [MISC Russian  ] territory , the [LOC U.S.  ] response had simply been that the system " was not aimed at [LOC Russia  ] . 
" As [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] had said , " when there is something risky on the ground , you need to take it into account . 
" [LOC Russia  ] had warned it would need to take countermeasures if the 3rd site was deployed , and that it would put missiles in [LOC Kaliningrad  ] . 
Noting that [LOC Moscow  ] would announce soon just how much it had withdrawn from [LOC Kaliningrad  ] , [PER Lavrov  ] said he hoped the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] could find common ground on [LOC MD.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] cautioned that [LOC Russia  ] did not perceive [LOC Iran  ] in the same way as the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Iran  ] for [LOC Russia  ] was " much more than a country which might cause concern in the international community . 
" [LOC Russia  ] opposed [LOC Iran  ] getting a nuclear weapon , because [LOC Russia  ] did not want any more " members of the nuclear club , " but [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Russia  ] were historical and traditional partners and neighbors , with a " rich bilateral agenda . 
" [PER Lavrov  ] said he was certain [LOC Iran  ] wanted to have a full nuclear fuel cycle and would negotiate from that basis . 
It was unfortunate that the [LOC U.S.  ] had not accepted the proposals a few years before when [LOC Iran  ] only had 32 centrifuges ; now they had over 5,000 . 
Nonetheless , [LOC Russia  ] wanted [LOC Iran  ] to cooperate fully with the [ORG IAEA  ] and implement , and eventually ratify , the Additional Protocol . 
As agreed to in the [LOC E3-plus-3  ] statement , [LOC Russia  ] wanted [LOC Iran  ] to prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear program , in a verifiable way. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Lavrov  ] commended the new [LOC U.S.  ] approach to [LOC Iran  ] , welcoming President [PER Obama  ] 's readiness for the [LOC U.S.  ] to engage " fully " in talks with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Willingness to discuss " all " the issues was a welcome step , and one which [LOC Russia  ] had been advocating for several years , [PER Lavrov  ] said . 
[LOC Iran  ] wielded a lot of influence in the region , including on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [ORG Hizbollah  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] , [LOC Gaza  ] , etc . 
[LOC Iran  ] had long been concerned about [LOC Israel  ] , and saw [LOC Pakistan  ] as a nuclear-weapons competitor . 
[PER Putin  ] had asked [PER Ahmadinejad  ] during a meeting in [LOC Tehran  ] a few years before why he made such anti-Israeli statements , but [PER Ahmadinejad  ] had not responded , only saying that [LOC Iran  ] was " not doing anything in the nuclear sphere different from [LOC Brazil  ] . 
" [PER Putin  ] had replied that [LOC Brazil  ] was not in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
While [LOC Iran  ] wanted to dominate the region and the [MISC Islamic  ] world , which was of concern to [MISC Arab  ] governments , the [LOC U.S.  ] should realize that the " [LOC Arab Street  ] " considers [MISC Iranian  ] leaders to be heroes. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Noting that [LOC Russia  ] was watching events in [LOC Iran  ] closely , [PER Lavrov  ] said [LOC Moscow  ] would be prepared to undertake the " dual-track approach , " first offering incentives to [LOC Iran  ] , but keeping in reserve measures within the Agreed [ORG Framework  ] . 
The [ORG Administration  ] 's new approach " give us a much better chance than we had in the past . 
We will do everything we can to make it work , " [PER Lavrov  ] said. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Nelson  ] said he was encouraged by the FM 's remarks , noting that it might be possible to consider cooperating on use of [LOC Russia  ] 's radars at [LOC Gabala  ] and [LOC Armavir  ] . 
He said he hoped [PER Lavrov  ] was right that [LOC Iran  ] would be deterred from building a nuclear weapon , but he was skeptical . 
The best deterrence might be for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] to cooperate on [LOC MD  ] . 
[ORG S-300 Sales  ] ----------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) Senator [PER Levin  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] had taken a practical and pragmatic step with the suspension of the sale of [ORG S-300  ] missiles to [LOC Iran  ] , Senator [PER Levin  ] said . 
This helped make [LOC Israel  ] less nervous , and sent a message to [LOC Iran  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] were working more closely together on [LOC Iran  ] issues . 
[PER Lavrov  ] acknowledged that [LOC Russia  ] was not supplying the system " for the moment , " but reiterated the usual mantra that [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG S-300  ] contract with [LOC Iran  ] did not violate any international or national laws or arms control regimes , and that the [ORG S-300  ] 's were a defensive system only . 
He added that nothing [LOC Russia  ] had sold [LOC Iran  ] had been used against anyone , whereas [LOC U.S.  ] weapons provided to [LOC Georgia  ] had been used [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001111 004 OF 005 against [MISC Russian  ] soldiers . 
This did not mean the [LOC U.S.  ] did not have the right to sell weapons to [LOC Georgia  ] , but [LOC Moscow  ] did not want a repeat of the August 2008 conflict . 
Overall , he said , the [MISC Iranians  ] had legitimate security concerns . 
They had been attacked more than once by their neighbors , and saw [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear status as " competition for regional leadership . 
" <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) In a follow-on meeting with [MISC DFM Ryabkov  ] , Senator [PER Levin  ] asked whether [LOC Iran  ] believed the [ORG S-300  ] sale was canceled or just suspended . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] replied that a contract existed , and it was impossible to break a contract without consequences . 
He repeated that [LOC Moscow  ] had taken [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] concerns into account , and at present [LOC Russia  ] was not providing any components of the system to [LOC Teheran  ] . 
Thus , it was " obvious the degree to which [LOC Iran  ] was dissatisfied with this , " he said . 
But , the contract was not canceled , it was merely " frozen , " [PER Ryabkov  ] stressed . 
He argued that " the less we hear from [LOC Washington  ] about this , the better . 
" Afghanistan/Pakistan -------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Collins  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC Russia  ] 's allowing transit of non-lethal equipment to [LOC ISAF  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and asked how the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] could work together to counter terrorism in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Lavrov  ] said [LOC Pakistan  ] was a place were " a lot of problems start for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , " and questioned the term " moderate [ORG Taliban  ] . 
" He said the people on the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1267 [ORG Committee  ] list should be " blacklisted for as long as possible , " but for anyone else , as long as they renounced terrorism , cooperated with the [LOC Kabul  ] government , and refrained from extremist activity , it would be all right to deal with them . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] Meeting --------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) In a follow-up meeting with [PER DFM Ryabkov  ] immediately afterwards , [PER Ryabkov  ] cited the non-paper [PER Lavrov  ] had given the Secretary in the [LOC Hague  ] on March 31 , and said there was already a good basis to cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC MD  ] . 
Progress had been made in the [ORG NATO Russia Council  ] on theater missile defense , and [LOC Moscow  ] believed there was more that could be done there . 
But he reiterated [PER Lavrov  ] 's position that bilateral discussions would need to start from scratch . 
He disagreed with Senator [PER Levin  ] 's statement that the system could not have a significant impact on [LOC Russia  ] 's nuclear capabilities . 
He noted that [LOC Russia  ] was more concerned about the radar than the interceptor sites , because the former could see the location of [LOC Russia  ] 's strategic forces , but even with the interceptors , nobody could predict what would be at those sites in 10 years' time . 
In response to Senator 's [PER Levin  ] 's asking whether the deployments couldn't be limited by an agreement , [PER Ryabkov  ] acknowledged that was a possibility , but stressed that the radar could still be used with other [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC MD  ] assets . 
The sites in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] were part of a global [LOC MD  ] architecture , which , when linked together , could almost " knock [LOC Russia  ] out . 
" <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Ryabkov  ] stressed that while the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] were not adversaries now , " intentions could change , " whereas " capabilities " were much harder to change . 
He noted that the countries in eastern [LOC Europe  ] saw the 3rd site as more of a geo-political issue , bringing them closer to the [LOC West  ] , than as a response to a potential threat from [LOC Iran  ] . 
" We are not in a zero-sum game and we do not want to use your possibly legitimate security concern as a geo-political pawn , " [PER Ryabkov  ] argued . 
Noting a link to the post-START negotiations , [PER Ryabkov  ] said the greater the reductions in number of warheads each side could possess , the more strategically important [LOC MD  ] became . 
He added that it would be politically difficult for [LOC Russia  ] to join a [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC MD  ] effort that included sites in [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] . 
If the [LOC U.S.  ] intended to pursue sites in [LOC Europe  ] , they should be further west and south , so as to diminish the effect on [MISC Russian  ] capabilities. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) In response to Senator [PER Levin  ] 's question whether it would be possible to develop a joint radar system with [MISC Russian  ] radars at [LOC Gabala  ] , [LOC Armavir  ] , and [LOC Moscow  ] , connected to [LOC U.S.  ] AEGIS and THAAD systems , [PER Ryabkov  ] responded that he had not considered such an idea before and would need to think about it . 
Such a system , he noted , would become strategic , and would lack the [MISC X-band  ] capability of the radar proposed [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00001111 005 OF 005 for the [LOC Czech Republic  ] , since all the systems cited were early-warning radars only , but it could be an option. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [PER Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] hoped it would be possible to have a " meaningful dialogue " with [LOC Iran  ] , and noted that President [PER Obama  ] 's remarks had had a strong impact in [LOC Teheran  ] and the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
But it was still difficult to predict how [LOC Teheran  ] would react . 
He characterized the [ORG P5-plus  ] 1 ( [PER E3-plus-3  ] ) statement as " very promising , " but claimed experience showed [LOC Iran  ] would not make concessions under pressure . 
He emphasized that it was " very clear that no one can deliver [LOC Iran  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] , except the [LOC U.S.  ] itself . 
" [ORG Civilian Space Cooperation  ] -------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) In response to Senator [PER Nelson  ] 's question about prospects for increased civilian space cooperation and what would happen when the [LOC U.S.  ] was fully dependent on the [MISC Soyuz  ] spacecraft to reach the [ORG International Space Station  ] , [PER Ryabkov  ] said he saw no difficulty with meeting the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's needs , and said we should both be forward-leaning . 
He noted that [ORG RosCosmos  ] had suggested to [ORG NASA  ] that [LOC Russia  ] cooperate on development of the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's new spacecraft , but the idea had not been pursued . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] proposed we discuss the issue further with [ORG RosCosmos  ] and said [LOC Moscow  ] favored closer cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] in this area . 
While it was not linked to [LOC MD  ] , the more progress we could make on [LOC MD  ] , the better able we would be to move forward on other issues. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( U ) [PER Codel Levin  ] did not clear this cable .
