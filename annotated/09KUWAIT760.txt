The [LOC U.S.  ] forces relied on support from [LOC Kuwait  ] for our efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as well . 
[LOC Kuwait  ] should remain open to engagement with [LOC Iraq  ] as a means to help resolve disputes between the two countries and help [LOC Iraq  ] achieve greater stability . 
DCOS [PER Al Sabah  ] responded that [LOC Kuwait  ] seeks to rebuild relations with [LOC Iraq  ] and prefers that negotiations between [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Kuwait  ] on international disputes be under the [ORG UN  ] aegis. -- ( S ) On [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] 's head of [ORG Military Intelligence  ] said the fate of [LOC Iran  ] is in Supreme Leader [PER Khamene'i  ] 's hands . 
He must either compromise with [PER Ayatollah Rafsanjani  ] or continue to support President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
He assessed that the public had crossed the " fear line , " and continued protests against the government were a possibility .

Continued unrest and government repression may be the catalyst that provokes [MISC Iranian  ] security forces to crack down , align with the masses , or fracture. -- ( C ) On [LOC CT  ] , General [PER Petraeus  ] noted [ORG USG  ] appreciation for recent [LOC CT  ] actions by [LOC Kuwait  ] 's [ORG Interior Ministry  ] forces , and said passage of comprehensive anti-terror legislation would greatly facilitate further efforts. -- ( C ) General [PER Petraeus  ] characterized the bilateral security relationship as strong , and welcomed the upcoming [ORG Joint Military Commission  ] ( [ORG JMC  ] ) in October , as well as [LOC Kuwait  ] 's continued participation in joint military exercises .

( C ) GEN [PER Petraeus  ] thanked the [ORG GOK  ] for its support for [MISC Operation Iraqi Freedom  ] ( [ORG OIF  ] ) and its facilitation of [LOC U.S.  ] forces deploying and redeploying through [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
He provided his congratulations on the results of the recent Parliamentary elections , noting in particular the election of four [MISC U.S.-educated  ] women , and said that it was encouraging to see [LOC Kuwait  ] 's recent counter-terrorism progress . 
[PER Petraeus  ] also thanked the [ORG GOK  ] for its financial , reconstruction , and moral support for [LOC Iraq  ] during [ORG OIF  ] . 
He urged that the [ORG GOK  ] continue to remain open to negotiate disputes between [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Kuwait  ] , and hoped that such negotiations would be concluded successfully . 
He assessed that with assistance from its [MISC Arab  ] neighbors [LOC Iraq  ] would " muddle through " towards stability . 
Though establishing [MISC Iraqi  ] stability absorbs a great amount of [ORG USG  ] focus , he reassured the [ORG DCOS  ] that [MISC Kuwaiti  ] security would remain a priority for the [LOC U.S.  ] , and also promised that the [LOC U.S.  ] would closely coordinate with the [ORG GOK  ] on working through the logistics of support for the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] forces from [LOC Iraq  ] through [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
GEN [PER Petraeus  ] said [MISC Iraqi  ] PM [PER Maliki  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] would provide an opportunity for discussion on issues of concern to [LOC Kuwait  ] , such as compensation , borders , and recovering the remains of [MISC Kuwaiti  ] prisoners still missing from the 1990 invasion and [MISC Iraqi  ] occupation . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] briefed the [ORG DCOS  ] on levels of violence in [LOC Iraq  ] , noting that the surge of [LOC US  ] forces , fighting side-by-side with [MISC Iraqi  ] forces that now number nearly 650,000 , has contributed greatly to growing stability . 
[LOC U.S.  ] combat forces have completed their withdrawal from [MISC Iraqi  ] cities , although advisors and liaison elements remain along with joint coordination centers in [LOC Basra  ] , [LOC Baghdad  ] , and [LOC Mosul  ] that provide the [MISC Iraqis  ] with access to [LOC U.S.  ] enablers and expertise. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In response , the [ORG DCOS  ] -- who was personally held as a POW during the [MISC Iraqi  ] invasion -- expressed a desire to rebuild relations with [LOC Iraq  ] , but , echoing the policy of the [ORG GOK  ] , said that all Kuwaiti-concerned negotiations with [LOC Iraq  ] should be conducted under the auspices of the [ORG UN  ] .

( S ) BG Abdulrahman al-Hadhood , Chief of [ORG Kuwaiti Military Intelligence  ] , in a frank discussion on [LOC Iran  ] , asserted that the future of [LOC Iran  ] , and its relations with its regional neighbors , is in the hands of Supreme Leader Grand [PER Ayatollah Khamene'i  ] . 
The direction in which [PER Khamene'i  ] will lead [LOC Iran  ] in this post-presidential election era will largely depend on whether he forges a compromise with [MISC Ayatollah  ] [PER Ali Akbar Rafsanjani  ] or continues to pull the " puppet strings " of President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] . 
[PER Al-Hadhoud  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] public , in staging mass protests in the wake of the elections , had " crossed the fear line . 
" The next test for [LOC Iran  ] will be to face the future reactions of the [ORG Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) , and to what extent the [ORG IRGC  ] , the [ORG Basij  ] militia , and the regular army are ordered to maintain security . 
He questioned whether the [ORG IRGC  ] would hold ranks with [PER Khamene'i  ] or begin to sympathize with the [MISC Iranian  ] masses should further crackdowns be instigated , as happened with the [MISC Iranian  ] Army when it fractured and many joined the mass student protests in the 1979 [MISC Islamic  ] revolution . 
[PER Al-Hadhoud  ] predicted that such a tripwire to tip the balance would be the arrest of Presidential challenger [PER Mir Housein Mousavi  ] . 
The [ORG DCOS  ] also mentioned [MISC Kuwaiti  ] understanding that [LOC Iran  ] was supporting [ORG Shi'a  ] in the [LOC Gulf  ] and extremists in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
GEN [PER Petraeus  ] asked for assistance in determining if [LOC Iran  ] was , in particular , supporting the al-Houthi in [LOC Yemen.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) GEN [PER Petraeus  ] assured the [ORG DCOS  ] that the [LOC US  ] military is " very capable " and is fully prepared for various contingencies should unrest escalate or [LOC Iran  ] become more unpredictable . 
He added that the [LOC US  ] military is assisting [LOC Gulf  ] states in shoring up ballistic missile and counter air defenses , as well as early warning systems in the eventuality of an [MISC Iranian  ] missile launch . 
He encouraged the [ORG GOK  ] to consider establishing a regional " [ORG Center for Excellence for Air and Missile Defense  ] , " -- complementing the [ORG UAE  ] 's [ORG Gulf Air Warfare Center  ] -- which would focus on air and missile defense and on the interoperability of systems such as the [ORG PAC-III Kuwait  ] now has deployed . 
Counterterrorism ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) GEN [PER Petraeus  ] congratulated the [ORG DCOS  ] on the success of [ORG GOK  ] security forces in counterterrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) operations in recent months , citing [MISC Kuwaiti  ] crackdowns on individuals of " mutual concern . 
" He conveyed to the [ORG DCOS  ] that passage of comprehensive [LOC CT  ] legislation would greatly facilitate further cooperation in this critical area . 
General [PER Petraeus  ] observed that [LOC Kuwait  ] , based on its experience with extremists , should recognize that such elements will ultimately turn to targeting [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
Mil-Mil: Joint training and [ORG JMC  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) GEN [PER Petraeus  ] told the [ORG DCOS  ] that the bilateral [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( signed in 1991 , renewed in 2001 ) had proved mutually beneficial and that the [ORG USG  ] is inclined to renew it in 2011 . 
He also said that he was looking forward to the October [ORG JMC  ] to discuss with [MISC Kuwaiti  ] COS LTG Fahad al-Amir [MISC Kuwaiti  ] concerns over the FMS program and the possibility of creating a regional air and missile defense center of excellence in [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
He also noted the receipt and approval of a [MISC Kuwaiti  ] request for an avionics and weapon systems upgrade , and encouraged [MISC Kuwaiti  ] participation in joint military exercises like Eager Mace and [ORG Bright Star  ] . 
He also offered to help in the coordination of an [MISC Eagle Resolve  ] exercise , should the [ORG GOK  ] desire to host it . 
In addition , he encouraged [LOC Kuwait  ] to send its special operations forces to [LOC Jordan  ] 's King [ORG Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center  ] and its fighter-attack aircraft to the [ORG UAE  ] 's [ORG Gulf Air Warfare Training Center.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
