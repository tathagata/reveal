Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] met with Director of the [MISC Chinese  ] Communist [ORG Party’s Central Committee International Liaison Department  ] ( CCID ) Wang Jiarui December 9 to discuss [MISC U.S.-China  ] cooperation on [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Wang  ] said that the “ideal outcome” of Special Representative for [LOC North Korea  ] Policy [PER Stephen Bosworth’s  ] current visit to [LOC Pyongyang  ] would be a meeting with [ORG DPRK  ] leader [PER Kim Jong-il  ] . 
The very fact of the visit , [PER Wang  ] emphasized , was important because it sent a signal to the [ORG DPRK  ] that the [LOC United States  ] was serious about negotiating a settlement of the [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] issue . 
The [ORG DPRK  ] would be unwilling in the short run to publicly announce denuclearization or an immediate return to the [MISC Six-Party  ] talks , but would not want to lose the opportunity presented by Ambassador [PER Bosworth’s  ] visit . 
The important thing was to keep things moving in the right direction and prevent the situation spinning out of control. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] praised [LOC U.S.  ] policy on [LOC Iran  ] , calling it a “practical” approach . 
He said [LOC China  ] was in agreement with the [LOC United States  ] “in principle” that [LOC Iran  ] should not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons and that the consequences of such an event would have a negative impact on [MISC Chinese  ] interests . 
He also said that [LOC China  ] would cooperate in persuading [LOC Iran  ] to live up to the commitments it made at the October meeting in [LOC Geneva  ] with the P5-plus-1 to resume discussions on the nuclear issue and allow third countries to reprocess its nuclear fuel . 
However , [PER Wang  ] insisted , continued diplomacy , rather than military action or stronger sanctions , was the best option at present . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] stressed the importance of China’s cooperation and would not close the door on diplomacy but that [LOC U.S.  ] patience was wearing thin and [LOC Iran  ] had to soon show it was complying with international agreements or face real consequences . 
End Summary . 
[LOC China  ] Pleased With [PER Bosworth  ] Visit to [ORG DPRK  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Asked his views on the [LOC North Korea  ] nuclear situation , CCID Director [PER Wang  ] stated that [LOC China  ] was very pleased that Ambassador [PER Bosworth  ] was in [LOC Pyongyang  ] , noting that the visit would be “cost effective” because the [LOC North Koreans  ] had made clear there could be no resuming the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] without first convening a bilateral [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] dialogue . 
Ambassador [PER Bosworth’s  ] visit effectively “kicked the ball” back to the [LOC North Koreans  ] . 
When asked what the likely outcome of the talks would be , [PER Wang  ] said the ideal outcome would be a meeting with [PER Kim Jong-il  ] , which would send a very positive signal , but it was impossible to predict [MISC North Korean  ] behavior through “normal” means of reading public indicators . 
[PER Wang  ] said that Ambassador [PER Bosworth  ] would likely meet with First Vice Foreign Minister [PER Kang Sok-ju  ] , who was “a hardliner” with “strong views” and whose opinions were valued by the [ORG DPRK’s  ] top leaders . 
However , [PER Kang  ] had to follow orders from above , [PER Wang  ] noted , and would not want to lose such an opportunity to improve relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The negotiations with Ambassador [PER Bosworth  ] would be a bargaining process , with each side trying to discern the other’s bottom line. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [LOC North  ] needed a breakthrough in its relations with the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Wang  ] asserted , both because of its domestic situation and the current international environment , but it would not be easy for [LOC North Korea  ] to make a specific promise regarding a return to the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] or to announce denuclearization . 
Ambassador [PER Bosworth’s  ] trip itself was important because it demonstrated that the [LOC United States  ] was serious about preventing a nuclear [MISC Korean  ] peninsula and was committed to a peaceful resolution of the issue . 
[PER Wang  ] said [LOC China  ] was aware that the [LOC United States  ] worried that it would be deceived by the [LOC North  ] but in China’s view there was no need to worry because the current process of promoting dialogue and negotiations was quite transparent and the international community would know what the outcome would be. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] reiterated China’s long-standing position that the key objective at this stage was to prevent the situation on the [MISC Korean  ] peninsula from spinning out of control and to establish a positive direction through dialogue and negotiation . 
He said that Ambassador [PER Bosworth  ] should make clear to [LOC North Korea  ] that it was not in [LOC U.S.  ] interests to prolong the current state of hostility , that the [LOC United States  ] had no intention of promoting regime change in the [LOC North  ] , and that international sanctions and relations with the [ORG DPRK’s  ] neighbors could be changed and they could help [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003313 002 OF 003 with [ORG North Korea’s  ] economic development . 
This was contingent upon a change in [MISC North Korean  ] behavior and an eventual [MISC North Korean  ] pledge to the world that it would not embark on the road to nuclear weapons . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] responded that the [LOC United States  ] understood the complexity of the situation and emphasized the great importance of joint [MISC U.S.-China  ] and Five-Party efforts to bring [LOC North Korea  ] back as soon as possible to the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] and its denuclearization commitments . 
Unified [MISC U.S.-China  ] Effort Needed on [LOC Iran  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] emphasized that the nuclear weapons challenge in [LOC Iran  ] required a similarly unified [MISC U.S.-China  ] and international effort . 
The [LOC United States  ] was profoundly concerned about [LOC Middle East  ] stability , which was crucial to both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] security and economic interests . 
If [LOC Iran  ] continued developing a nuclear capability , [LOC Israel  ] would “no doubt” act , and concern among the [MISC Arab  ] states might trigger a regional arms race . 
President [PER Obama  ] had repeatedly reached out to [MISC Iran’s  ] leaders , but had yet to receive a positive response . 
Moreover , [LOC Iran  ] had not followed through on the understandings reached in [LOC Geneva  ] in October , including [MISC Iran’s  ] commitment to meet with the P5-plus-1 countries for talks focused on the nuclear issue and its initial acceptance of the IAEA’s TRR proposal . 
The [LOC United States  ] would continue to take a diplomatic , creative and flexible approach working with our [MISC Russian  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] and [MISC European  ] partners , but time was running short . 
By the end of the year , President [PER Obama  ] would have to evaluate [MISC Iran’s  ] actions thus far . 
If [LOC Iran  ] did not live up to its agreements , the [LOC United States  ] would work with its international partners to make clear to [LOC Iran  ] the consequences of its unwillingness to engage seriously . 
[PER Wang Pledges  ] [MISC Chinese  ] Support... ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] had high praise for [LOC U.S.  ] efforts in the [LOC Middle East  ] in general and the approach to [LOC Iran  ] in particular , stating that [LOC China  ] viewed [LOC U.S.  ] measures in [LOC Iran  ] as very practical and as based on realities on the ground . 
[LOC China  ] had economic interests in [LOC Iran  ] , but , in principle , [LOC China  ] had no differences with the [LOC United States  ] on the nuclear weapons issue . 
[LOC China  ] agreed that [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear weapons would bring great instability to the [LOC Middle East  ] , including possible warfare , even on a global scale , with consequences far greater than China’s economic interests . 
[LOC China  ] agreed with the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal and that [LOC Iran  ] should live up to the commitments it made in [LOC Geneva  ] , but unfortunately , [LOC Iran  ] had not responded positively to this proposal despite many efforts by the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC China  ] , and the international community . 
[LOC China  ] had consistently told [LOC Iran  ] that [LOC China  ] strongly opposed [MISC Iran’s  ] pursuit of nuclear weapons . 
This message , he claimed , has been conveyed in party-to-party and government-to-government meetings and in “all channels.” However , [LOC Iran  ] maintained it had no nuclear weapons and was simply pursuing the peaceful use of nuclear energy. ...But Urges Continued Diplomacy -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] pressed [PER U/S Burns  ] for details on when the limits of [LOC U.S.  ] patience might be exhausted and counseled further efforts to find a diplomatic solution . 
[PER Burns  ] replied that [LOC U.S.  ] patience was nearly exhausted . 
[PER Wang  ] acknowledged that there was a potential for an [MISC Israeli  ] military strike were the situation not handled properly , which was of grave concern to [LOC China  ] , but insisted that harsh actions were not yet warranted . 
Recent [LOC U.S.  ] experience with a military option , he said , should teach some lessons , and the outcome of tougher sanctions was also unpredictable . 
The [LOC United States  ] needed to understand that [LOC Iran  ] was not [LOC Iraq  ] , and the best way forward was to continue to pursue peaceful dialogue and negotiations and to carefully examine previous diplomatic efforts to see what changes needed to be made . 
[LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] Similarities --------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] also claimed similarities between the [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issues . 
The solution in both cases was to persist over the long haul , continuing intensive efforts with the objective of ensuring that the situation did not spin out of control . 
[PER Wang  ] noted that in his several recent visits to [LOC Iran  ] anti-American sentiment was strong , everywhere , and palpable , which , he said , was not conducive to resolving the issue. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] asked [PER U/S Burns  ] for his views on who made final decisions in [LOC Iran  ] , President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] or Supreme Leader [LOC BEIJING  ] 00003313 003 OF 003 [PER Khamenei  ] . 
He said it would be very helpful to [LOC China  ] if the decision-making process in [LOC Iran  ] could be sorted out . 
[PER Wang  ] appeared to agree with the Under Secretary that [PER Khamenei  ] was the final arbiter of [MISC Iranian  ] policy and concluded by stating that there might be a way for direct communication with the Supreme Leader . 
He said direct engagement would avoid the distortions of message that occurred when communicating through an intermediary . 
[PER Wang  ] noted that there was not one country in the international arena that supported [MISC Iran’s  ] quest for nuclear weapons and emphasized that there was a need for a unified international view on [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Burns  ] responded that the [LOC United States  ] had made very clear its willingness for direct diplomacy , but that it took both sides to make direct communication work . 
He emphasized that this was a core national security issue for the [LOC United States  ] , which could not abide greater [LOC Middle East  ] instability , and said the [LOC United States  ] would continue its diplomatic efforts in a creative and flexible manner . 
However , he stated , at some point there had to be results and [LOC U.S.  ] patience was fast running out . 
[ORG U.S.-China Cooperation  ] ---------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Wang  ] said [LOC China  ] would continue to make its own efforts on the issue but [LOC China  ] was willing to do more to cooperate with the [LOC United States  ] to facilitate a resolution to the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear problem . 
He welcomed further [LOC U.S.  ] suggestions on measures to achieve a breakthrough and asked what the [LOC United States  ] would like [LOC China  ] to do or whether there were areas in which [LOC China  ] could make a contribution . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] emphasized that the [LOC United States  ] would like to cooperate with [LOC China  ] and needed to work closely with [LOC China  ] to find a way to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to make the right choices . 
The current focus was on persuading [LOC Iran  ] to live up to the commitments it made at the [LOC Geneva  ] meetings on the TRR proposal and by meeting again soon on the nuclear issue . 
The two P5-plus-1 tracks -- diplomacy and sanctions -- were not mutually exclusive . 
The [LOC United States  ] had tried many approaches to [LOC Iran  ] in the past 11 weeks , and none had borne fruit . 
The [LOC United States  ] would not close the door on diplomacy , but as in the case of putting pressure on [LOC North Korea  ] through [ORG UN Resolution  ] 1874 , we had to work together to apply pressure to get [LOC Iran  ] back to the diplomatic track . 
[LOC Iran  ] had to understand that it faced a clear choice . 
[LOC Iran  ] could choose to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear energy , which the [LOC United States  ] supported and would work to implement if [LOC Iran  ] demonstrated the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program . 
But [LOC Iran  ] had to understand there were costs to not following this path . 
[PER Wang  ] agreed that both sides should try very hard to resolve the problem .
