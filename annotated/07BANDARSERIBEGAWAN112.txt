( U ) Ambassador delivered reftel points on March 29 to [PER Datin Maimunah  ] , Deputy Permanent Secretary for Bilateral and [ORG Political Affairs  ] in the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and Trade . 
[ORG MFAT Desk  ] Officer for [LOC Middle East  ] Latifah [PER Zaini  ] attended meeting as notetaker . 
Reftel talking points and text of [LOC UNSCR  ] 1747 were left as non-papers. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In response to demarche , [PER Maimunah  ] said the [ORG MFAT  ] had already received text of [LOC UNSCR  ] 1747 from its [ORG UN Mission  ] and was aware of requirement for [ORG UN  ] member states to implement its provisions . 
[PER Maimunah  ] told Ambassador that she and her [ORG MFAT  ] colleagues had been discussing Iran’s motivation for the recent seizure of [MISC British  ] sailors , and she believed that it may have been done for domestic reasons , in order to help President [PER Ahmadi-Nejad  ] divert [MISC Iranian  ] attention away from the bad news of passage of [LOC UNSCR  ] 1747 . 
That would indicate that [PER Ahmadi-Nejad  ] was starting to feel a bit of heat . 
[PER Maimunah  ] agreed with [MISC Ambassador’s  ] observation that [MISC Iranian  ] opinion was not monolithic and there may be growing concern within [LOC Iran  ] about the mounting costs of [MISC Ahmadi-Nejad’s  ] unwavering defiance of international opinion on the nuclear issue. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador emphasized that [ORG Annex II of UNSCR  ] 1747 renewed the [MISC P5-plus-one  ] offer of a long-term agreement with [LOC Iran  ] if it suspended its proliferation-related activities and returned to negotiations , and that this “carrot” should bolster the arguments of those within [LOC Iran  ] who believed that the costs of noncompliance with the relevant [MISC UNSCR’s  ] was becoming unacceptable . 
[PER Maimunah  ] welcomed extension of the offer , noting it was important to show the [MISC Iranians  ] there was a way out of the situation they had worked themselves into . 
Ambassador urged the Government of [LOC Brunei  ] to point out the value of the [MISC P5-plus-one  ] offer in its contacts with the Government of [LOC Iran  ] and encourage its acceptance .
