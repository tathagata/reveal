( C ) SUMMARY: Under the charismatic leadership of [PER Jan Marijnissen  ] , the [ORG Dutch Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG SP  ] ) is reconfiguring itself to become a credible left-wing alternative to the increasingly centrist [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) of [PER Wouter Bos  ] . 
In a rare meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] on May 16 , [PER Marijnissen  ] and MP [PER Harry van Bommel  ] stressed that the party has evolved to become more moderate and less anti-American -- although it remains strongly opposed to many [LOC U.S.  ] policies . 
Party leaders believe [ORG SP  ] could win between 15 and 20 seats in the next [LOC Parliament  ] -- up from 8 -- making it a serious political force and a potential partner with [ORG PvdA  ] in a left-leaning coalition government -- although [ORG PvdA  ] leaders are openly dismissive of forming a government with former [MISC Communists  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[MISC DUTCH  ] SOCIALISTS: REVIVED... ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Dutch Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG SP  ] ) , has long been perceived as a more radical , leftist alternative to the increasingly mainstream [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) . 
Formed in 1972 as a grass-roots protest party with an openly [MISC Maoist  ] ideology , the [ORG SP  ] first competed in parliamentary elections in 1977 , but won its first two seats only in 1994 . 
The party 's roots as a provocative protest party is symbolized by its logo -- a ripe tomato suitable for throwing . 
Under the leadership , since 1986 , of charismatic former welder and factory worker [PER Jan Marijnissen  ] , the party has steadily increased its credibility and appeal -- in 2003 , it won nine seats in the [ORG Second Chamber  ] and four in the [ORG First Chamber  ] . 
The [ORG SP  ] is now the fourth largest party in [LOC Parliament  ] , and the third largest in the country in terms of membership ( just under 40,000 ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During the 2004 [MISC Dutch  ] referendum on the [ORG EU  ] 's [LOC Constitutional Treaty  ] , the [ORG SP  ] drew on its extensive grass-roots networks -- especially in urban areas -- and party discipline to mount an exceptionally effective no campaign . 
Support for [ORG SP  ] grew dramatically as a result , especially among [ORG PvdA  ] voters disappointed by their party leadership 's support for the Constitution . 
Although [ORG SP  ] support has declined from those peak levels , the party more than doubled its representation in city councils following the March 2006 municipal elections . 
[ORG SP  ] has subsequently formed local coalition governments with the [ORG PvdA  ] and other parties in several municipalities , including [ORG Nijmegan  ] and [ORG Groningen  ] . 
According to recent polls , the [ORG SP  ] could win 14 seats in parliament if elections were held today , but [ORG SP  ] Foreign Policy Spokesman [PER Harry van Bommel  ] privately predicts it will win between 15 and 20 seats when elections are held in 2007 . 
Even taking into account the fact that the [ORG SP  ] tends to do better in opinion polls than in actual elections , the [ORG SP  ] is likely to emerge from the next election as a significant force in [LOC Parliament.  ] ...REFORMED... -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On May 16 , Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] and [ORG POLCOUNS  ] met with [PER Marijnissen  ] and van [PER Bommel  ] at the [ORG Second Chamber of Parliament  ] . 
[PER Marijnissen  ] and van [PER Bommel  ] both stressed that their party has become more moderate , and less anti-American , in recent years . 
[PER Marijnissen  ] , for example , proudly noted that this was the first meeting he had ever had with an [MISC American  ] Ambassador . 
[PER Van Bommel  ] similarly pointed out that when he speaks to party members these days , he stresses that the [ORG SP  ] is now more of a [ORG Social Democrat  ] party than a Socialist one . 
Based on his multiple trips to the [LOC U.S.  ] -- where he worked briefly as a teacher and traveled extensively by motorcycle -- van [PER Bommel  ] said he appreciated shared [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] values and could not imagine a [MISC Dutch  ] government abandoning the transatlantic relationship. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Van Bommel  ] and [PER Marijnissen  ] made clear that they strongly disagreed with many policies of the [MISC Bush  ] and [ORG Balkenende  ] governments . 
The [ORG SP  ] , for example , firmly opposed [MISC Dutch  ] military deployments to [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Asked about [MISC Dutch  ] participation in the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) , van [PER Bommel  ] said he thought the initial [MISC Dutch  ] decision to become involved was a mistake at the time -- and it still is . 
That said , [ORG SP  ] 's interest in foreign policy would always take a back seat to bread-and-butter domestic issues such as workers' rights and compensations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Although the [ORG SP  ] draws much of its support from urban areas with large immigrant populations , van [PER Bommel  ] THE [MISC HAGUE  ] 00001184 002 OF 002 acknowledged that the party has a problem attracting immigrant voters . 
This is partly due to the party 's tradition of defending indigenous workers' rights against immigration , but van [PER Bommel  ] suggested that other factors also played a role . 
He noted that the sole [ORG SP  ] member of parliament with an [MISC Islamic  ] background , [PER Ali Lazrak  ] , had defected from the parliament because he objected to the [ORG SP  ] 's policy of having MP 's turn over a significant portion of their salary directly to party coffers . 
[PER Van Bommel  ] stressed that the party was actively looking at ways to change its image to make it more attractive to culturally conservative immigrant groups , particularly with regard to religion , and was seeking to recruit more ethnically diverse candidates. ...AND READY TO RULE ? --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Van Bommel  ] and [PER Marijnissen  ] accented their willingness to serve in a left-wing coalition government with [ORG PvdA  ] and GreenLeft -- a possibility they have also raised publicly . 
If current trends continue , van [PER Bommel  ] pointed out , there could be a clear left-wing majority ( more than 75 seats ) in the [ORG Second Chamber of Parliament  ] following the May 2007 elections for the first time since 1977 . 
Even if [ORG PvdA  ] leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] would prefer to rule from the center , according to van [PER Bommel  ] , it would be irresponsible for him not to at least consider governing from the left if that is what the voters want . 
He pointed out that the [ORG PvdA  ] and [ORG SP  ] formed governing coalitions in a number of municipalities -- including [ORG Groningen  ] and [ORG Nijmegan  ] -- following the March 2006 municipal elections , and could be seen as natural partners on many issues . 
[PER Marijnissen  ] joked that [PER Bos  ] had even copied his trademark look -- suit with no tie -- from [PER Marijnissen  ] , who has not worn a tie in decades. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting with the Ambassador on May 17 , [ORG PvdA  ] member ( and close [PER Bos  ] advisor ) [PER Frans Timmermans  ] rejected outright any possibility of forming a coalition government with [ORG SP  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] stressed that [PER Bos  ] recognizes that even to hint at such a possibility would alienate large numbers of centrist voters both within and to outside the [ORG PvdA  ] . 
In his view , it would be foolish for the [ORG PvdA  ] to trust anyone who used to be a communist . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Having rejected [MISC Maoism  ] in the 1970 's , abandoned [MISC Marxism-Leninism  ] in 1991 , and -- just last year -- dropped all references to public ownership of property from the party platform , the [ORG SP  ] arguably no longer poses an ideological threat to the status quo . 
That said , it remains anathema to most voters because of its Communist links and history of aggressive anti-establishment protest activities . 
As frustration with the [MISC Dutch  ] political establishment grows , however , voters on both the left and the right are looking for alternatives to the established parties , and the [ORG SP  ] is well positioned to fill part of that niche . 
Dr. [PER Gees Voerman  ] , a specialist in [MISC Dutch  ] political parties at the [ORG University of Groningen  ] who is currently writing a book on the [ORG SP  ] , told [ORG POLCOUNS  ] recently that the [ORG SP  ] may be the fastest growing party in The [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
If , as expected , the [ORG PvdA  ] refuses to enter into a coalition with [ORG SP  ] following the 2007 elections , [PER Voerman  ] noted that the party would be well positioned to challenge Bos from the left in [LOC Parliament  ] , potentially laying the groundwork for a more serious challenge to the [ORG PvdA  ] 's dominance of the left in the future .
