( C ) [ORG CODEL Leahy  ] ( [PER Senators Leahy  ] , [PER Whitehouse  ] and [ORG Warner  ] ) , accompanied by Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] , met for approximately one hour with President [PER Karzai  ] . 
Senator [PER Leahy  ] told [PER Karzai  ] this was a particularly critical time in the [MISC Afghan-U.S.  ] relationship . 
President [PER Obama  ] was strongly committed to continuing assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but the [MISC American  ] people needed assurance that such assistance was being used appropriately , wisely and for the benefit of the [MISC Afghan  ] people , especially in light of the troubled world economy . 
[PER Karzai  ] insisted that [LOC Afghanistan  ] would do all necessary to convince [MISC Americans  ] their investment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's future was a sound one . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] had already made substantial progress in recent years , but still needed assistance in building its capacities in areas such as agriculture , security , finance and other areas. --------------------------------------------- --- Must [ORG Promote Capacity Building  ] in the Ministries --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Whitehouse  ] said that he had been impressed by the Ministers of Agriculture , Finance and [ORG Rural Rehabilitation and Development  ] at an earlier meeting , referring to their demonstrated commitment to accountability and transparency in their ministries . 
The more progress in good governance and transparency , he said , the more goodwill [MISC Afghans  ] would see from the [MISC American  ] people , and the more support they would see from the [MISC American  ] government . 
[PER Karzai  ] replied that he had a very good cabinet of technocrat ministers and advisors . 
The problem , he said , lay below the senior level , and was caused by a lack of capacity in the ranks . 
[PER Karzai  ] referred to [LOC India  ] 's program of training 1,000 young [MISC Afghans  ] each year for civil service and suggested he would like to model an [MISC Afghan  ] program along those lines. ------------------------------------------ Need to [ORG Promote Development  ] of [ORG Rule of Law  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] asserted it would take a long time to restore the judiciary because it had been so thoroughly destroyed during the war years . 
Many [MISC Afghans  ] still relied on informal or community-based systems for swift justice , rather than the courts . 
He believed , however , that it was an encouraging sign that [MISC Afghans  ] had a higher expectation of justice than ever before . 
The [MISC Afghan  ] government was committed to removing corrupt and incompetent judges . 
[PER Karzai  ] cited progress in the anti-corruption and rule of law areas , though he was still concerned about widespread corruption among officials and police , and its impact on the average [MISC Afghan.  ] ------------------------- [PER Karzai  ] 's [ORG Campaign Message  ] ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Karzai  ] said his campaign message would be to stress [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's progress during his seven years as president . 
Most importantly , [LOC Afghanistan  ] had been made into a country for all [MISC Afghans  ] again , and had become a proud member of the world community , actively participating in multi-lateral talks with nations such as [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] - something he could not have imagined six years ago . 
Average per capita income had risen from $180 six years ago to more than $500 now . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] had amassed $3.6 BN in foreign reserves , and established banking and accounting systems to prevent theft and misuse of public funds . 
[PER Karzai  ] had encouraged the establishment of a strong and independent media to hold the government accountable . 
Regarding the narcotics threat , [PER Karzai  ] acknowledged serious challenges remained , but noted 22 of [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's provinces were free or mostly free of poppy , up from just three poppy-free provinces in 2005. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] said when he assumed the presidency , there were 4,000 - 5,000 students in [LOC Kabul  ] 's five universities - today there are approximately 75,000 in the nation 's universities , 45,000 of whom entered the university this [LOC KABUL  ] 00001377 002 OF 002 year . 
Of those 75,000 university students , 25 percent were women . 
The nation , he said , had seven million students in its schools , mostly in areas not controlled by the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
Over the next 10 years , he expected that population to grow as areas were increasingly wrested from insurgent control , and new schools opened . 
He proudly pointed to a program initiated four years ago in which female students were sent overseas for advanced education , and were now returning to [LOC Afghanistan  ] with advanced degrees to teach in the schools and universities. -------------------------------- Poppy Production Still a Problem -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] said that [LOC Afghanistan  ] had always had poppies , but forty years ago , poppy was not an important crop in comparison to apricots , pomegranates , and other agriculture products . 
He believed the people could be turned from poppy production , but feared limited opportunities and poverty served to increase the temptation of easy money through poppy cultivation . 
He also criticized some forms of aid or NGO gifts . 
[MISC Afghans  ] , he said , needed to take on the work of repairing [LOC Afghanistan  ] for themselves , rather than having the [ORG NGOs  ] do it for them . 
The [ORG NGOs  ] were not helping the [MISC Afghans'  ] work ethic though gifts , but through training. --------------------------------------- [MISC Iranian Attitudes Towards U.S.  ] Changing --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] said the purpose of his May 24 trip to [LOC Tehran  ] was to participate in [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's first tri-partite summit talks with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , on the issue of counter-terrorism , among other regional issues . 
[PER Karzai  ] told [LOC Iran  ] 's leadership the [LOC U.S.  ] was a good country and the [MISC Iranians  ] should seek better relations with the [MISC Americans  ] . 
President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] indicated he would be willing to improve relations ; [PER Karzai  ] believed [LOC Iran  ] 's attitude towards the [LOC U.S.  ] was changing .
