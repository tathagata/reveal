Koenig  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] will be focused on a productive , substantive meeting when you visit [PER Baden-Baden April  ] 3 . 
[LOC Germany  ] holds the greatest untapped potential in [LOC Europe  ] for our transatlantic agenda ; unlocking it will take sustained effort by the [ORG Administration  ] , and the payoff will not be immediate . 
What is most on [PER Merkel  ] , s mind is her political future , six months before national elections , with her poll numbers wobbling and her coalition increasingly dysfunctional . 
[LOC Germany  ] , s capacity to act is constrained by ( 1 ) the short-term demands of domestic politics ( about which we can do little ) , ( 2 ) the slow pace of change in public support for a [MISC German  ] leadership role ( a focus of our engagement ) , and ( 3 ) the constant demands of the economic crisis . 
Your meeting provides an opportunity to map out key priorities with [LOC Germany  ] for the remainder of [PER Merkel  ] , s current term and beyond. --------------------------------- [PER Merkel  ] , s [ORG Own Crisis  ] -- [ORG Leadership  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Merkel  ] is methodical , rational , and pragmatic -- qualities that propelled her to stratospheric levels of public support early in her tenure , when she presided over a recovering economy and a successful presidency of the [ORG European Union  ] . 
The past year has been less kind , and the almost exactly equal split in the [MISC German  ] electorate between left and right is re-emerging as elections approach . 
[PER Merkel  ] now faces a &Gordian knot8 of rising unemployment , economic crisis , and domestic political dissatisfaction at a time when she can least afford a wrong move . 
The effectiveness of [PER Merkel  ] , s &Grand Coalition8 government is declining as her [PER Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) and their Social [MISC Democratic  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) partners begin in earnest their campaigns for the September 2009 election . 
The Chancellor , s edge over the rival [ORG SPD  ] , led by Foreign Minister [PER Frank-Walter Steinmeier  ] , is diminishing . 
When cornered , [PER Merkel  ] can be tenacious but is risk averse and rarely creative . 
This suggests she will remain a very circumspect [PER Ally  ] until the election. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The collapse of [MISC German  ] exports and industrial activity has shocked Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and her advisors . 
They had thought [LOC Germany  ] would escape the worst of the world recession thanks to its competitive position in emerging markets . 
In the [MISC New Year  ] , [PER Merkel  ] and Finance Minister [PER Peer Steinbrueck  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) rushed a relatively robust stimulus program through the [ORG Bundestag  ] that is timed to counter a surge in unemployment just before the September elections . 
Like most [MISC Germans  ] , they doubt further deficit spending will generate lasting growth , and fear too large a stimulus may cause stagflation at home and dangerous new global imbalances . 
[PER Merkel  ] and [PER Steinbrueck  ] remain bitter at the brush-off they allegedly received during the last administration when they advocated tighter financial oversight . 
Tougher regulations , they insist , are essential to restore confidence in the banking system and get credit flowing again , thus creating the pre-conditions for a sustainable recovery. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Hoping to escape responsibility for the economic crisis , [PER Merkel  ] has issued public critiques of [LOC U.S.  ] recovery policy that exaggerate the differences between [LOC Washington  ] and continental [LOC Europe  ] . 
In fact , [LOC Germany  ] faces many of the same difficult choices as the [LOC U.S.  ] The Chancellor is expected to put forward a further stimulus package later this year . 
Her government has bailed out big banks while holding firm on state aid to ailing firms like [ORG Opel  ] . 
The conventional wisdom in [LOC Germany  ] is that [ORG Opel  ] could be rescued with minimum state aid if only it could be separated from [ORG GM  ] , but in fact there is no viable business plan for the firm to stand on its own . 
The Chancellor is surrounded by bad options: an interventionist approach would further alienate economic conservatives in her [ORG CDU  ] ( who are already defecting in droves to the free-market [ORG FDP  ] ) ; if she does nothing , [PER Steinmeier  ] and the [ORG SPD  ] will harvest the goodwill of centrist voters for trying to save [ORG Opel  ] . 
[PER Merkel  ] has not been above shifting responsibility to the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG General Motors  ] , which she and [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000345 002.2 OF 002 the [MISC German  ] media unfairly blame for bleeding [ORG Opel  ] dry . 
In the end , [PER Merkel  ] , s government will likely be forced to prop up at least parts of the automaker. -------------------------------------------- Increasing Political Caution during Campaign -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Merkel  ] and [PER Steinmeier  ] are pragmatists ; on foreign policy , in particular , there is more that unites them than divides them . 
But the centrifugal forces of the election campaign and the growing mistrust between the [ORG CDU  ] and [ORG SPD  ] make it increasingly difficult for them to agree on any big ideas about [LOC Germany  ] , s role in the world or its relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Buffeted by events , [PER Merkel  ] is struggling to define a convincing vision for &her8 [LOC Germany  ] ; &competence8 is the sole component at this point . 
She is blessed that [PER Steinmeier  ] , her principal competitor , faces even greater difficulties . 
His party has lost its bearings in the [ORG Grand Coalition  ] and is plagued by internal divisions . 
[PER Steinmeier  ] himself is a technocrat and a latecomer to electoral politics -- his shortcomings on stage are significant . 
[PER Steinmeier  ] has tried to make up ground on [PER Merkel  ] by publicly identifying himself with the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] . 
However , his ability to deliver on policy initiatives without the Chancellor , s political support is limited. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [LOC Afghanistan  ] is an example . 
[PER Merkel  ] has been cautious throughout her chancellorship and has doggedly resisted real or perceived pressure for [LOC Germany  ] to take on a larger military role . 
She and [PER Steinmeier  ] both have supported the [MISC Comprehensive Approach  ] , but the Chancellor , s [ORG CDU  ] , in the face of public skepticism , is reluctant even to consider increasing police or civilian support . 
[PER Steinmeier  ] and the [ORG SPD  ] have been more forward-leaning , but they cannot deliver on their own . 
You should emphasize that at the moment the [LOC U.S.  ] is not seeking significant additional military forces from [LOC Germany  ] , but that every member of the international community will need to do much more ( e.g. , training security forces and providing civilian assistance ) if we are to be successful. --------------------------------------- Policy Opportunities on [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] should play a central role with the [LOC U.S.  ] in defining a coordinated western [LOC Russia  ] policy that resets the relationship without retreating from our values . 
The winter gas crisis made [MISC Germans  ] rethink [LOC Russia  ] , s reliability as a supplier , but the lack of alternatives and the desirability of gas as a clean energy source have left the government resigned to dependency on [LOC Russia  ] in the near-to-medium term . 
On energy as well as [LOC Georgia  ] , neither [PER Merkel  ] nor [PER Steinmeier  ] has identified areas where [MISC German  ] policy steps could help create a more persuasive set of incentives for [LOC Russia  ] to integrate further into rules-based relationships and institutions . 
Meanwhile , [LOC Germany  ] is concerned about threats to economic and social stability in [LOC Central and Eastern Europe  ] , but prefers [ORG EU  ] and [ORG IMF  ] approaches to limit its share of the bill. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Both [PER Merkel  ] and [PER Steinmeier  ] welcomed your Nowruz address to the [MISC Iranian  ] people and government . 
They support the [LOC U.S.  ] investment in the diplomatic track and agree that [LOC Germany  ] and the [ORG EU  ] need to invest in the economic pressure track . 
[LOC Germany  ] , s close ties to [LOC Israel  ] include an imperative to defend [LOC Israel  ] , s right to exist and to play an active role in international non-proliferation efforts toward [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Merkel  ] will be looking to the meeting to gain a better understanding of how you see the [ORG USG Iran  ] policy unfolding and what role we need [LOC Germany  ] to play. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Mr. President , Mission [LOC Germany  ] is honored to support you on your first overseas trip as President , and we look forward to welcoming you in [LOC Baden-Baden  ] .
