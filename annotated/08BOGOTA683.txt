END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------- [ORG GOC  ] WILL FACILITATE NEW HOSTAGE RELEASE --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] confirmed on February 23 that the [ORG GOC  ] has located the four political hostages set to be released by the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) , but added that the [MISC Colombian  ] military would not interfere with their release . 
Defense Minister [PER Juan Manuel Santos  ] had previously announced that the [ORG GOC  ] had located the four--Gloria [PER Polanco  ] , [PER Luis Eladio Perez  ] , [PER Orlando Beltran  ] , and [PER Jorge Eduardo Gechem--south  ] of [LOC San Jose  ] de [LOC Guaviare  ] , and near where [PER Clara Rojas  ] and [PER Consuelo Gonzalez  ] de [PER Perdomo  ] were released on January 10 . 
[PER Santos  ] said [PER Gechem  ] was in " grave " physical condition , and urged his immediate release . 
[PER Gechem  ] 's family announced they will travel to [LOC Caracas  ] on February 27 with Senator [PER Piedad Cordoba  ] in the expectation that the [ORG FARC  ] will release the four in the near future. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Peace Commissioner [PER Luis Carlos Restrepo  ] told us the hostage recovery operation would likely follow the model used in the [ORG FARC  ] 's release of [PER Clara Rojas  ] and [PER Consuelo Gonzalez  ] , including the use of [LOC San Jose  ] de [LOC Guaviare  ] airport by [MISC Venezuelan  ] helicopters . 
The [ORG GOC  ] would not try to impose new conditions due to the intense domestic and international interest in the four hostages' release . 
[PER Santos  ] told the Ambassador he had publicly announced the [ORG GOC  ] 's knowledge of the hostages' location to prevent the [ORG FARC  ] from blaming [MISC Colombian  ] military operations for delaying the release or from attributing [PER Gechem  ] 's death to [ORG GOC  ] obstructionism . 
On February 25 , [MISC Venezuelan  ] Interior Minister [PER Ramon Rodriguez Chacin  ] accused the [ORG GOC  ] of carrying out " intense military operations " that were complicating the [ORG FARC  ] 's plans for release. -------------------------------------------- TENSE [ORG GOC  ] MEETING WITH [MISC FRENCH  ] OVER [LOC VENEZUELA  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] told us the February 21 meeting between President [PER Uribe  ] and [MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] was " cordial but frank . 
" [PER Kouchner  ] proposed the creation of a group of countries , including [LOC Venezuela  ] , to facilitate a humanitarian exchange . 
[PER Uribe  ] responded that this was not the time to talk about [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Restrepo  ] said [PER Kouchner  ] tried to raise [LOC Venezuela  ] two more times during the meeting , only to be rebuffed by [PER Uribe  ] . 
In an interview with weekly news magazine " [MISC Semana  ] " published February 24 , [PER Kouchner  ] said " [PER Chavez  ] is key to liberation of the hostages . . . and we think President [PER Chavez  ] has played a positive role up to now . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] said [PER Uribe  ] pressed [PER Kouchner  ] on what [LOC France  ] might contribute to a humanitarian accord , as well as his proposal to encircle the [ORG FARC  ] unit holding the hostages and to negotiate their release . 
[PER Kouchner  ] repeated [MISC French  ] skepticism about encirclement , but said [LOC France  ] would contribute economic support and would also accept some [ORG FARC  ] members as part of a negotiated solution. ---------------------------------- [ORG GOC  ] TO MEET [MISC FRENCH  ] , [MISC SPANISH  ] , [MISC SWISS  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Restrepo  ] told us he will secretly meet with the three [MISC European  ] facilitators--France , [LOC Spain  ] and [MISC Switzerland--  ] in [LOC Panama  ] on February 26 to discuss the way forward on humanitarian negotiations . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has authorized [MISC Swiss  ] representative [PER Jean Pierre Gontard  ] and [MISC French  ] representative [PER Noel Saenz  ] to meet the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[PER Uribe  ] told [PER Kouchner  ] that after such a [MISC FARC-Euro  ] meeting , the [ORG GOC  ] could consider a possible role for [LOC Cuba  ] , as well as [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula da Silva  ] , in support of the [MISC European  ] effort. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Separately , [MISC Spanish  ] DCM in [LOC Bogota  ] [PER Pablo Gomez  ] de [PER Olea  ] confirmed the [LOC Panama  ] meeting and predicted little would be achieved due to lack of consensus among the three [MISC European  ] countries . 
[PER Gomez  ] said the [MISC French  ] are increasingly desperate to obtain the [ORG FARC  ] 's release of [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] , see [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] as key , and are prepared to act without [ORG GOC  ] authorization or knowledge . 
He said the [MISC French  ] would gladly pay the [ORG FARC  ] in exchange for [PER Betancourt  ] 's freedom and would also agree to seek the [ORG FARC  ] 's removal from the [ORG EU  ] terrorism list . 
The problem is that the [ORG FARC  ] does not want money for [PER Betancourt  ] . 
[PER Gomez  ] added that the [MISC French  ] have put [LOC Spain  ] in an increasingly difficult position by demanding that [LOC Spain  ] choose between supporting [LOC France  ] or [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Gomez  ] told us the [MISC Swiss  ] are more moderate than the [MISC French  ] , but are also capable of acting without [ORG GOC  ] authorization . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] are not bound by the [ORG EU  ] 's terrorist list , and allow a [ORG FARC  ] representative to operate in [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
[PER Gomez  ] said [LOC Spain  ] believes individual [MISC Latin  ] countries do not have the stature or credibility to play a role in a humanitarian process . 
Still , [LOC Spain  ] believes the [ORG OAS  ] could assume such a role under the right circumstances , making it important to preserve [ORG OAS  ] interest and credibility .
