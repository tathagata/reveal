Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Mission [LOC Pakistan  ] warmly welcomes your arrival ; your appointment comes as [LOC Pakistan  ] grapples with internal change and hopes the [LOC Ombama  ] administration can support regional solutions to development and counter-terrorism challenges . 
After eight years of military rule , the civilian government is working , so far successfully , to re-shape civilian-military relations . 
Although not a failed state , [LOC Pakistan  ] needs international help to stabilize civilian rule by building democratic institutions and delivering relief to a population suffering from food inflation , electricity blackouts , high unemployment and deteriorating law and order . 
Passage of the [MISC Kerry-Lugar  ] bill and delivery of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance at the upcoming [ORG IMF Donors’ Conference  ] offer new avenues to combat extremism inside and outside of the tribal areas and reduce anti-Americanism across [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Now absorbing combat losses against a formidable militant enemy , Pakistan’s military finally has begun to accept more [ORG USG  ] training and assistance in support of counter-insurgency . 
Pakistan-NATO/Afghan cooperation and coordination across the border has improved dramatically in recent months and will be even more important if the [LOC U.S.  ] raises troop levels in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
A surge of [LOC U.S.  ] troops across the border may push more militants into [LOC Pakistan  ] , creating new challenges especially if [LOC Pakistan  ] must defend a new front in [LOC Balochistan  ] . 
As recent media reports indicate , the [LOC U.S.  ] has been remarkably successful over the past year in disrupting the al-Qaida network based in Pakistan’s tribal areas ; we can discuss this issue in greater detail with you . 
A friendly Zardari-Karzai relationship is creating new opportunities to improve cross-border trade and build an energy corridor that could eventually link [LOC Central  ] and [LOC South Asia  ] . 
Improved Pak-Afghan ties offer new prospects for outreach to [ORG Taliban  ] reconcilables on both sides of the border. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Indo-Pakistan relations are still simmering . 
In the wake of [LOC Mumbai  ] and accelerating militant control of [MISC Pakistani  ] territory , the military/ISI faces the need to re-evaluate its historic use of proxy tribes/militant groups as foreign policy tools . 
Although the conventional wisdom says that [LOC Mumbai  ] closed the door on [LOC Kashmir  ] discussions , there is no doubt that [LOC Pakistan  ] believes tackling the [LOC Kashmir  ] issue remains the key to regional security . 
We offer a detailed update below . 
End Summary Domestic Politics ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The civilian government headed by President [PER Asif Zardari  ] and Prime Minister [PER Yousaf Gilani  ] , elected one year ago , is now stable . 
Zardari’s position currently is secure , and [PER Gilani  ] has a majority in parliament . 
The [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) and its coalition allies rule in three of the four provinces and effectively control all three branches of federal government . 
[PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is by far the most popular politician in [LOC Pakistan  ] ( with an 83% approval rating compared to Zardari’s 20% in the latest [ORG IRI  ] poll ) , but he does not have the votes to bring down the government . 
Instead , [PER Nawaz  ] is rebuilding his party’s structure in preparation for the next election and appealing directly to street . 
[PER Zardari  ] is cementing leadership alliances so he can avoid another election until he receives international assistance to address food and fuel inflation , electricity blackouts and high unemployment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While far from perfect , you will find [PER Zardari  ] is pro-American and anti-extremist ; we believe he is our best ally in the government . 
Clearly , [PER Zardari  ] runs the show , and [PER Gilani  ] has at times chafed at public acknowledgment of this fact . 
We believe , however , that reports of [MISC Zardari-Gilani  ] tensions are exaggerated ; [PER Gilani  ] knows his place and will tow Zardari’s line. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The [ORG PPP  ] may also make a power play to take over the [ORG Punjab  ] government , which now is ruled by [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] . 
During your visit you no doubt will [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000236 002 OF 005 hear rumors the [ORG Army  ] is unhappy with [PER Zardari  ] and may step in to oust him , particularly if it is needed to restore order. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The premise behind these rumors is that Nawaz-inspired street demonstrations timed to coincide with indirect [ORG Senate  ] elections and another lawyers’ “Long March” on March 9 may get out of hand . 
We see little evidence this scenario will get out of control ; so far , we are encouraged by Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] Kayani’s determination to have the civilians succeed . 
[PER Kayani  ] dislikes [PER Nawaz  ] far more than he mistrusts [PER Zardari  ] . 
Not A Failed State ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) This is not a failed state . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has solid albeit weak institutions , a robust if often irresponsible media , established although under-equipped police forces , an increasingly strong civil society , and a population with a proven resiliency to withstand everything from earthquakes to kleptocracy . 
However , [PER Zardari  ] is more adept at political maneuvering than governing ; we believe he is spending too much time on his rivalry with [PER Nawaz  ] and too little time on rolling back a spreading insurgency and improving a weak economy. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Although we do not believe [LOC Pakistan  ] is a failed state , we nonetheless recognize that the challenges it confronts are dire . 
The government is losing more and more territory every day to foreign and domestic militant groups ; deteriorating law and order in turn is undermining economic recovery . 
The bureaucracy is settling into third-world mediocrity , as demonstrated by some corruption and a limited capacity to implement or articulate policy . 
Security -------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The good news is that the government has the will to fight extremism and the [ORG Army/Frontier Corps  ] is now actively engaged in combat , particularly in [LOC Bajaur  ] , [LOC Mohmand  ] and [LOC Swat  ] . 
Faced with its weaknesses against a formidable enemy , the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] is now accepting [ORG USG  ] training , and that is giving us new access and opportunities to improve [MISC Pakistani  ] counter-insurgency capability . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has agreed to build additional tripartite [ORG Border Coordination Centers  ] ( [ORG BCCs  ] ) , and this month we will expand tactical/target-focused intelligence sharing through the [LOC Torkham  ] [ORG BCC  ] . 
The military remains reluctant to expand the [LOC U.S.  ] military footprint , but we now have the basis for increased cooperation . 
We are also delivering [MISC Cobra  ] spare parts and upgrading their [MISC MI-17  ] and [LOC Bell  ] 412 helicopters so the [MISC Pakistanis  ] can operate more than two Cobras on any given day. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The bad news is that the militants are driving the agenda ; the [LOC Pakistan  ] military has too few forces to fight too many battles at one time . 
They have more troops on the [MISC Indian  ] border but felt the need to transfer 5,000-7,000 troops from [ORG FATA  ] to the eastern border in the wake of increased [MISC Indo-Pak  ] tensions after [LOC Mumbai  ] . 
The latest territorial loss has been in [LOC Swat  ] , in the “settled area” of the [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) about 90 miles from [LOC Islamabad  ] , where local/taliban militants are closing schools , beheading opponents , and operating a parallel justice system . 
The police cannot cope and largely have abandoned locals to their fate. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The military’s decision in 2008 to strike a deal with [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] in [LOC South  ] Waziristan helped to reduce the number of suicide bombings in [LOC Pakistan  ] but gave [PER Mehsud  ] free rein to infiltrate his forces throughout the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) . 
He has exploited [MISC Sunni-Shi’a  ] tensions in places like [LOC Kurram  ] and sent his fighters into [LOC Bajaur  ] via [LOC Afghanistan  ] to attack government positions . 
This has eroded Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] Kayani’s strategy to gradually regain control of the [ORG FATA  ] agency by agency. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) As recent media reports indicate , the [LOC U.S.  ] has been remarkably successful in disrupting al-Qaida operations in Pakistan’s tribal areas . 
In the past year , 10 of the top 20 al-Qaida operatives , including those responsible for the [ORG East ISLAMABAD  ] 00000236 003 OF 005 [LOC Africa  ] embassy bombings in 1998 and tied to [MISC Islambad’s  ] Marriott bombing , have been eliminated . 
We can discuss this issue in more detail during your visit . 
Solutions --------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The government has a strategy of “dialogue , deterrence and development ; ” however , it lacks the military capacity to deter militants and the financial resources to develop the [ORG FATA  ] . 
Its historic fallback has been to play for time by conducting negotiations with militants , a disastrous tactic that only has made the extremists stronger . 
The government insists it will negotiate with tribal leaders but not with militants . 
Many [MISC Pakistanis  ] have been closely following reports of [MISC Saudi-brokered  ] intervention with [ORG Taliban  ] “reconcilables” in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and many believe a similar strategy is needed in [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) We share the government’s belief that there is no all-military solution to containing extremism . 
We are implementing a strategy of concurrently building the counter-insurgency capability of the [ORG Army  ] and [ORG Frontier Corps  ] , providing the police/FATA law enforcement forces with training and equipment , and delivering economic development to raise poor socio-economic indicators in [LOC FATA  ] . 
Security concerns are limiting our ability to operate , but today [ORG USAID  ] contractors are building schools and wells , hiring workers for short-term jobs , training teachers and increasing the capacity of the [ORG FATA Secretariat  ] to deliver services that demonstrate the writ of government in [LOC FATA  ] . 
Through [ORG USAID  ] , [ORG DOD  ] and [ORG USG  ] donations to [ORG UN  ] agencies , we have provided over $10 million in aid to help up to 200,000 Internally Displaced [MISC Persons  ] who fled fighting in [LOC Bajaur  ] and [LOC Swat  ] and now are living in and out of camps , primarily near [LOC Peshawar.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Extremism , however , is no longer restricted to the border area . 
We are seeing young [MISC Punjabi  ] men turn up in [LOC FATA  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] as fighters recruited from areas of southern [LOC Punjab  ] where poverty , illiteracy and despair create a breeding ground for extremism . 
The phenomenon is spreading into northern Sindh as well . 
[PER Pashtuns  ] fleeing military action in [LOC FATA  ] are destabilizing the always volatile ethnic mix in [LOC Karachi  ] . 
[ORG Taliban  ] leaders have been based in [LOC Quetta  ] since the days of the anti-Soviet jihad , but they now are expanding their presence in [LOC Balochistan  ] . 
In response , we are redirecting [ORG USAID  ] programs geographically to concentrate on areas where the nexus of poverty and extremism is growing. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Including [ORG FATA  ] , [ORG USAID  ] will program approximately $500 million in 2009 for [LOC Pakistan  ] ; if Kerry/Lugar is approved and funded , this will increase to $1.5 billion per year in primarily economic assistance . 
We have provided over $40 million in equipment to the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] and the [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) police ; we are in the midst of programming another $15 million for the [ORG NWFP  ] police and await the results of a police assessment team to reprogram another $85 million for law enforcement . 
Given the urgent requirement to address the absence of law enforcement capacity in the [ORG NWFP  ] and [ORG FATA  ] , we are proposing that $100 million for law enforcement assistance be included in the [MISC Kerry-Lugar  ] legislation . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] met with President [PER Karzai  ] the morning of her assassination ; [PER Karzai  ] attended Zardari’s inauguration and the two have met repeatedly under much improved bilateral relations . 
They have signed new economic cooperation agreements , are considering a new transit trade treaty and have tentatively scheduled another round of the peace jirga . 
We continue to see potential for expanded economic relations and the prospect of building a trade and energy corridor that can link [LOC Central Asia  ] through [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] to the rich markets of [LOC South  ] Asia. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Following embarrassing militant attacks on [MISC U.S./NATO  ] convoys last year , [LOC Pakistan  ] has made efforts to secure Khyber [PER Agency/Torkham Gate  ] , through which [MISC U.S./NATO  ] trucks deliver 30% of the fuel and 80% of the dry goods for our forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Cooperation and coordination [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000236 004 OF 005 between [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC NATO/Afghan  ] forces across the border have dramatically increased since October . 
This has reduced cross-border attacks on [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This cooperation will be even more important if the [LOC U.S.  ] executes a planned troop surge in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Such a surge , particularly if it is employed along the [MISC Helmand-Kandahar/Balochistan  ] border , may send additional fighters into [LOC Pakistan  ] and create another front for the [LOC Pakistan  ] military to defend . 
[LOC India  ] ----- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [MISC Indo-Pak  ] tensions are still simmering , but to avoid a potential [MISC Indian  ] military strike , the [MISC GOP  ] needs to show progress on prosecuting those responsible for the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
Interior Minister [PER Malik  ] will outline to you his plan to prosecute [PER Lashkar-e-Taiba/Jamaat-ud-Dawa  ] ( [MISC LeT/JUD  ] ) suspects now in custody . 
The key will be whether the military/ISI is ready to turn the [LOC Mumbai  ] suspects over to civilian law enforcement , and whether [LOC India  ] considers [MISC Pakistani  ] actions adequate . 
[PER Kayani  ] , in particular , wants to avoid a reckoning with his past leadership of [ORG ISI  ] . 
Despite arrests of key [MISC LeT/JUD  ] leaders and closure of some of their camps , it is unclear if [ORG ISI  ] has finally abandoned its policy of using these proxy forces as a foreign policy tool ; we need to continue pressing them to realize this strategy has become counter-productive in [LOC Kashmir  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [ORG FATA.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] quashed [ORG National Assembly  ] debate of a resolution signed by leaders of most of the political parties urging the [LOC U.S.  ] to appoint a special envoy on [LOC Kashmir  ] , or add that portfolio to your plate . 
However , privately , [PER Zardari  ] and [PER FM Qureshi  ] have indicated they would welcome your engagement on [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
Although the conventional wisdom says that [LOC Mumbai  ] closed the door on [LOC Kashmir  ] discussions ; from [MISC Pakistan’s  ] perspective , there is no doubt that tackling the [LOC Kashmir  ] issue remains the key to regional security . 
Nukes ----- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Strategic Plans Division  ] Director [PER LtGen  ] ( ret ) [PER Kidwai  ] can brief you in detail on [MISC Pakistan’s  ] physical , personnel and command and control safeguards for [MISC Pakistan’s  ] nuclear weapons . 
Our major concern is not having an [MISC Islamic  ] militant steal an entire weapon but rather the chance someone working in [MISC GOP  ] facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . 
[LOC Islamabad  ] has chafed over the [MISC U.S.-India 123 Agreement  ] , arguing it also needs civilian nuclear power to meet energy demand ; we have repeatedly advised the [MISC GOP  ] that it should not expect a similar agreement because of [MISC AQ Khan’s  ] proliferation activities. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [ORG Khan  ] , who now is suffering from cancer , remains a national hero , albeit one who is closely monitored under house arrest . 
In 2008 , he tried and failed to win his freedom through the courts . 
His network , we believe , has been disbanded , and the [LOC U.S.  ] recently imposed additional sanctions on [ORG Khan  ] and two of his [ORG Khan Research Labs  ] associates . 
Also worth noting is that [LOC China  ] has reportedly agreed to help [LOC Pakistan  ] build two additional civilian nuclear reactors , neither of which is grandfathered under [ORG Nuclear Supplier Group  ] agreements . 
Neither project is expected to begin for at least five years , and we have expressed our concerns about this proposed deal to both [LOC China  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Program of Record/F-16s ----------------------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [ORG DOD  ] is requesting that [ORG Congress  ] create a program of record for [LOC Pakistan  ] , similar to that for [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which would provide consistent funding to implement our [ORG Security Development Plan  ] ( [ORG SDP  ] ) , the vehicle we are using to train and equip both [MISC Pakistani  ] Special Forces ( [ORG SSG  ] ) and the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] . 
Currently , [ORG DOD  ] programs are delivered through a variety of separate funds with overlapping and sometimes conflicting authorities . 
The proposed [ORG DOD  ] supplemental for [LOC Pakistan  ] will total $400 million ; the 2010 request will total $517 million . 
[ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000236 005 OF 005 <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) The [PER Bush  ] administration commitment to provide [LOC Pakistan  ] with $300 million annually in [ORG FMF  ] expires in 2009 , and we need to come to agreement with [LOC Pakistan  ] on how to restructure its [ORG FMF  ] program to meet its counter-insurgency needs . 
A major issue facing the new administration is whether to fund the remainder of [MISC Pakistan’s F-16  ] program , a deal that was signed as a symbol of post-9/11 engagement after sanctions were lifted in 2002. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] simply cannot afford to complete this $2 billion plus program to buy 18 new [MISC F-16s  ] , upgrade 35 older Excess Defense Articles aircraft , upgrade a new base , and fund a munitions package . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has been late with several payments , and an [LOC Islamabad  ] default would interrupt production lines for other critical [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] acquisitions . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] originally planned to use the [MISC F-16s  ] to offset [MISC Indian  ] military superiority ; they now are using [MISC F-16s  ] against militant targets in the [LOC FATA  ] . 
We are responding to [LOC Pakistan  ] Air Force requests for Close Air Support training to improve their now limited precision targeting capability . 
Economy ------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) Faced with untenable budgetary deficits , high inflation , and hemorrhaging foreign exchange reserves , the [MISC PPP  ] government had little choice but to agree to an [ORG International Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement  ] on November 24 . 
This was regarded as an option of last resort , as no past [MISC Pakistani  ] government had long survived the implementation of the fiscal austerity measures required by a Fund program . 
The $7.6 billion arrangement , with a $3.1 billion initial disbursement , has bought the [MISC GOP  ] some breathing room , and appears to have somewhat restored market confidence . 
Foreign exchange reserves and the exchange rate have stabilized , and foreign remittances and direct investment are up slightly . 
Portfolio outflows continue , however , and the [ORG Karachi Stock Exchange  ] remains moribund. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) While it appears that the [MISC GOP  ] will be able to meet the [MISC IMF’s  ] first quarter targets , the higher interest rates imposed by the Fund , along with higher tax collection targets will make a full economic recovery more difficult . 
Although the [MISC GOP  ] predicts 3 percent GDP growth , several experts predict a flat GDP for the fiscal year ending June 30 . 
The reduction in government spending on social safety programs required by the [ORG IMF  ] will not increase the government’s popularity , while the elimination of all subsidies on electricity , which the [MISC GOP  ] has promised by end-June , is particularly likely to stir popular anger . 
The severe electricity shortage has caused rolling blackouts throughout the country , and previous rate hikes have brought protesters into the streets . 
A looming wheat shortage has apparently been successfully avoided through the [MISC GOP’s  ] purchase of large amounts of [MISC Russian  ] grain. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) The [ORG IMF  ] has estimated that the [MISC GOP  ] will need an additional $4 billion from donors over the next two years to strengthen the country’s social safety net programs and beef up foreign exchange reserves . 
However , the [MISC GOP  ] has never encouraged donor coordination and is having a difficult time coming up with lists of viable projects that donor countries would be likely to support . 
We understand that most donors are reluctant to provide the [MISC GOP  ] with straight budgetary support . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] will provide initial project ideas in February to ambassadors of the Friends of a [MISC Democratic  ] [LOC Pakistan  ] group ; we will evaluate next steps , including a possible Friends ministerial on the margins of the Donors meeting , after receiving those proposals .
