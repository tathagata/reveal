REF: A ) [LOC MOSCOW  ] 2586 B ) [LOC MOSCOW  ] 1349 Classified By: Pol Min Counselor [PER Susan Elliott  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Efforts to sanitize Stalin’s role in [MISC Soviet  ] history may be potentially damaging to academic freedom and linked to [ORG GOR  ] efforts to increase authoritarian rule . 
Although some recent incidents have caused concern among human rights monitors , thus far [ORG GOR  ] efforts to enlist academics to help oppose “falsification of history” have not been strongly enforced . 
[ORG GOR  ] rhetoric on the subject appears largely aimed at scoring political points in arguments with foreign countries . 
End Summary . 
Stalin’s ghost haunts the [ORG Metro  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The specter of [PER Joseph Stalin  ] continues to haunt post-Soviet [LOC Russia  ] , as the [ORG GOR  ] and average [MISC Russians  ] alike struggle to reconcile their pride in past [MISC Soviet  ] glories with the harsh fact that the [MISC Soviet  ] system , especially under [PER Stalin  ] , destroyed the lives of millions of its citizens . 
This uneasy and ambivalent relationship with the past is further complicated by a [ORG GOR  ] policy of occasionally exploiting nationalistic emotions about [MISC Soviet  ] history -- especially the [MISC Soviet  ] victory over the [MISC Nazis  ] -- to buttress support for its own , modern brand of authoritarianism ( ref A ) . 
The latest dispute flared up after [LOC Moscow City Hall  ] announced on October 27 that it would add Lenin’s name to artwork in the [MISC Kurskaya Metro  ] station which , since August , has carried a restored verse from the 1944 version of the [MISC Soviet  ] anthem praising [PER Stalin  ] . 
Moscow’s chief architect , [PER Aleksandr Kuzmin  ] , told local media that he wanted to “return [MISC Kurskaya  ] to its original appearance , ” which would include a monument to [PER Stalin  ] . 
An article in the daily [ORG Komsomolskaya Pravda  ] , a paper not always known for liberal opposition , noted wryly that if the goal was to return things to their original appearance , it might be necessary to blanket the entire city with [MISC Stalin’s  ] image , as authorities had done during the height of Stalin’s totalitarian reign of terror . 
[LOC Moscow  ] Mayor [PER Yuriy Luzhkov  ] told [ORG Interfax  ] October 28 that the city had no intention of placing a [PER Stalin  ] statue in the [ORG Metro  ] , and the [LOC Moscow  ] Patriarchate criticized the idea of “Stalinist symbols” in the [ORG Metro  ] , calling it “divisive.” Academic freedom under threat ? ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG GOR  ] efforts to sanitize [MISC Soviet  ] history have continued throughout the year , and have the potential to reach into numerous walks of life and hence to encroach upon academic freedom . 
In May , the [LOC Kremlin  ] announced that it had formed a “Commission to Oppose Historical Falsification , ” and its state [ORG Duma  ] supporters introduced legislation to defend [MISC Russia’s  ] honor in any discussion of [MISC World War II  ] and the subsequent creation of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] ( ref B ) . 
Less than a month later , in June , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] leaked to us an email allegedly from [PER V.A. Tishkov  ] , the Chief of the History Section of [ORG RAN  ] , politely “requesting” all faculty to present him with information in connection with the [MISC GOR’s  ] May announcement . 
The information requested included a list of sources of possible “falsification” in their field of study , and information about activity among their students promoting the spread of “falsification” or of “concepts damaging to [MISC Russia’s  ] interests.” More recently , on October 14 , the [ORG Moscow Times  ] reported that the [MISC German  ] government had written a letter to President [PER Medvedev  ] complaining about an investigation into an [LOC Arkhangelsk  ] historian , [PER Mikhail Suprun  ] , for “violating privacy rights” by researching deportations of [MISC Soviet  ] [ORG Germans  ] under [PER Stalin  ] . 
The police official who gave [PER Suprun  ] access to the archives is also accused of “abuse of office , ” while [PER Suprun  ] could receive up to four years in prison , and has had what he called “a lifetime’s work” on computers and research data confiscated by the [ORG Federal Security Service  ] ( FSB ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that she personally knew professors at academic institutions in [LOC Moscow  ] who had received such memos during the summer , including memos asking them to “identify falsifiers.” She added that the [ORG Foreign Intelligence Service  ] also has a presence at [ORG RAN  ] . 
Discussing this potentially disturbing trend , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also alluded to the “unpleasant rewrites” found in officially sanctioned textbooks which whitewash Stalin’s role in the country’s history . 
While acknowledging the existence of “a broad variety” of history books ( approximately 24 schoolbooks on history are available in bookstores ) , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the official version outnumbers the others by 250,000 books to approximately 10-15,000 . 
Furthermore , in [LOC Russia  ] as in the [LOC U.S.  ] , parents do not buy their children’s history books , but rather the schools order them , which [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said makes the [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002688 002 OF 003 choice “pre-determined.” On October 24 , the liberal [ORG Daily Journal  ] reported the release of the latest in a long line of history textbooks rehabilitating [PER Stalin  ] ; this one , ironically produced by the “Enlightenment” publishing company , denies the existence of totalitarianism in the [LOC USSR  ] . 
The article noted that every time someone brings up the topic of history , it engendered a furious on-line debate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that a “virtual war” has flared up between pro-Kremlin and anti-Kremlin bloggers every time someone published papers on the [MISC Internet  ] that they received from state archives 15 years ago detailing [MISC Soviet  ] human rights abuses . 
The papers date back 15 years , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , because now , “as in [MISC Soviet  ] times , ” people need to complete special applications to receive permission to read such documents . 
A brief window opened after the fall of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , and just as quickly closed again . 
The past is not dead ; it is not even past ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) For [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , such debates tell as much about the present as they do about the past . 
He believes that the [ORG GOR  ] is “trying to create a newly obedient society , ” which “as in [PER Orwell  ] , ” only knows history from a standpoint beneficial to the authorities . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , “when the power structure talks about falsification , they are simply attempting to hide part of history.” He added that knowledge of the real history carries significant power . 
He was struck by the “shock” of people who learned historical facts , because “sometimes just one fact can overturn a person’s whole world view.” For example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] daughter , who studied in the [LOC USSR  ] and teaches history in high school , upon learning that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] grandfather had been killed in the 1937 purges , talked of little else for several years afterward . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , “the [LOC Kremlin  ] fears people learning about past atrocities and crimes , ” and hence “tries to manipulate people’s consciousness.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that he understands the [MISC GOR’s  ] policy , because “if people knew the extent of [MISC Soviet  ] crimes , ” the [LOC Kremlin  ] would not be able to control the populace . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed a similar view , saying that the [ORG GOR  ] prefers to present itself as “infallible , making only correct decisions , ” and that discussions about [MISC Stalin’s  ] misdeeds might lead to unwanted questions for today’s government. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he suspected that at least some of the pro-Kremlin bloggers who participate in these historical debates were professionals in the pay of the [ORG GOR  ] ( and perhaps special services ) . 
This notion may not be so far-fetched . 
On October 21 , [ORG Interfax  ] reported that a supposedly private citizen named [PER Mikhail Baranov  ] had launched an [MISC Internet  ] portal called “Runivers” to fight “falsification of history” by creating a historical and cultural electronic encyclopedia and library . 
The article describes Baranov’s organization as “non-commercial , ” and does not indicate from where -- during these economically tight times -- it receives its funding . 
However , a State [ORG Duma  ] deputy who is a member of the Runivers board , [PER Vladimir Medinskiy  ] , lamented to [ORG Interfax  ] that “Russia does not have an institution that would be dealing in historical propaganda , which is why we are losing in the war aimed to falsify [MISC Russian  ] history.” A “wink” is the easiest response to [ORG GOR  ] directives --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The fact that [LOC Russia  ] currently lacks such a “historical propaganda” institution has thus far prevented any widespread attacks on academic freedom in the name of “anti-falsification.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told us October 27 that he had heard no reports from any of his [ORG MGU  ] colleagues of any pressure on them to present teaching materials or name names in order to ferret out “falsification.” He attributed this at least in part to the fact that , in contrast to neighboring [LOC Belarus  ] , [LOC Russia  ] has no [ORG Ideological Department  ] which examines all teaching materials in schools and universities . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also cautioned against leaping to [MISC Orwellian  ] conclusions , reminding us not to “underestimate the cynicism” involved in administrative requests like the one at [LOC RAN.  ] “Everyone knows how to take such requests , ” she said ; the request from the government is “ugly , ” but unlike in [MISC Soviet  ] times , when professors all depended upon the government for their currently there is no way to enforce such decrees . 
As a result , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , “people wink” ; the administrators , while passing along the government’s request , make it clear to their subordinates that they themselves do not support it . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed out that many historians may be outraged at the government’s heavy-handedness and its “real falsification of history , ” but they don’t see themselves as a unified force . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002688 003 OF 003 The simplest response is to use the power of inertia , and to stonewall passively . 
Goal of [ORG GOR  ] rhetoric: score political points at home --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) For the [MISC GOR’s  ] part , it held a session of its Commission during the summer , and its director claimed that participants were “not here to censor , but simply to oppose” perceived attempts by other countries to gain at [MISC Russia’s  ] expense on the geopolitical scene . 
Although the stated focus is on international disputes , the [MISC GOR’s  ] primary audience for its hardline stance is domestic . 
Rhetoric defending [MISC Russia’s  ] honor on the international stage scores easy political points for the [ORG GOR  ] at home . 
( Note: This occasionally results in some fancy footwork , as when [PER Putin  ] visited [LOC Poland  ] on the anniversary of the [MISC Molotov-Ribbentrop  ] Pact , and wrote a conciliatory article for his [MISC Polish  ] audience , which -- according to [PER Lipman  ] , by [ORG GOR  ] design -- received scant coverage in [MISC Russian  ] media . 
End Note . 
) As [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , “there is a lot of vagueness about the past , but [MISC World War II  ] is the one thing everyone in [LOC Russia  ] accepts , both liberal and conservative ; the narrative is that [LOC Germany  ] attacked , and we won.” That [LOC Stalin  ] continues to have a following , 56 years after his death , is undeniable . 
After [PER Aleksandr Prokhanov  ] , editor-in-chief of the ultranationalist paper [LOC Zavtra  ] , praised [LOC Stalin  ] on the “Honest Monday” political talk show on Gazprom-owned NTV , television audience members were invited to phone in their opinions . 
Of those who participated , 61 percent called [LOC Stalin  ] a hero , 32 percent an enemy , and 7 percent “a great , effective manager.” Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Recent reports of the death of academic freedom in [LOC Russia  ] are greatly exaggerated . 
[ORG GOR  ] leaders have shown that they are willing to adopt nationalistic postures when it buttresses their popular support , but attempts to dictate academic terms thus far appear half-hearted . 
The [ORG GOR  ] is no doubt telling the truth when it claims to place greater focus on external quarrels about its past than on domestic debates . 
It is undeniable that nationalists continue to link [MISC Russia’s  ] past greatness with its past political system , which showed disdain for the value of individual human life and for freedom of expression , and that this approach places these fundamental freedoms under threat . 
However , there remain enough [MISC Russians  ] both in and out of the government who question the nationalists’ logic and strive to keep the memory of [MISC Stalin’s  ] victims alive . 
In the meantime , the [ORG GOR  ] occasionally remembers to name a street after [PER Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn  ] just to make sure that nobody confuses them with the [MISC Soviets  ] . 
When discussing this issue , [MISC Russians  ] frequently refer to the poet [PER Anna Akhmatova  ] , who , when [PER Khrushchev  ] opened the doors to [MISC Stalin’s  ] prisons , wrote that the half of [LOC Russia  ] who had imprisoned the other half would now come face to face with its victims . 
Since according to a recent [MISC Levada  ] poll , 27 percent of current [MISC Russians  ] have relatives who perished under [MISC Stalin’s  ] rule , that “other half” is not going away any time soon .
