( C ) AF PDAS [PER Carter  ] discussed the [MISC UK’s  ] overall posture in [LOC West Africa  ] , increasing security issues in the [LOC Sahel  ] , counter-narcotics initiatives , support to [ORG ECOWAS  ] , and next steps with [LOC Nigeria  ] on July 22 with [ORG Foreign Office West and Southern Africa Department  ] Director [PER Janet Douglas  ] , Deputy [PER Jennifer Townson  ] , [LOC West Africa  ] Team leader [PER Paul Welsh  ] , and [ORG Africa Research Analyst Head  ] [PER Clare Thomas  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] in [LOC West Africa:  ] Maintaining [LOC UK  ] Attention on the [LOC Region  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Douglas  ] began by explaining that relative stability in [LOC West Africa  ] and a [LOC UK  ] budget crunch ( reftel A ) has meant a reduced [LOC UK  ] presence and less [LOC UK  ] programming in [LOC West Africa  ] . 
Noting questionable trends in several [LOC West Africa  ] countries , [PER Douglas  ] said her team tries to “ensure the level of consciousness on [LOC West Africa  ] does not diminish too far” in the minds of [LOC UK  ] ministers . 
She agreed the June murder of [MISC Briton  ] [PER Edwin Dyer  ] in [LOC Mali  ] by [ORG AQIM  ] had been “a game changer , ” re-focusing [LOC UK  ] attention on the security issues in the [LOC Sahel  ] and prompting new efforts to coordinate policy on the region , particularly with the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] . 
She strongly endorsed greater [MISC P-3  ] coordination , even though the [MISC French  ] “have not been doing a great job on promoting democracy in [LOC West Africa.”  ] [PER Carter  ] highlighted the need for greater focus on governance , not just democracy , and [LOC West African  ] governments’ resource distribution and service delivery to meet the needs of all their citizens . 
[PER Douglas  ] said the [LOC UK  ] was trying to get the [ORG EU  ] to hold a tougher line on backsliding democracies , particularly when the [ORG African Union  ] has strong and helpful positions . 
Security in the [LOC Sahel  ] --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Douglas  ] agreed that counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) is the next major challenge facing the [LOC Sahel  ] and that the [LOC West African  ] countries lack the capacity to deal with it . 
[PER Welsh  ] acknowledged that the [LOC UK  ] has had limited insight into the issue , in large part due to lack of presence on the ground in countries like [LOC Mauritania  ] and [LOC Mali  ] , though they are learning quickly and planning to open [LOC UK  ] offices in both countries . 
[PER Douglas  ] took on board Carter’s assessment that the road to [LOC CT  ] in the [LOC Sahel  ] , particularly in [LOC Mali  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] , and [LOC Niger  ] , is through [LOC Algiers  ] , that [LOC Mauritania  ] possibly faces the biggest terrorist threat in the region , and that it was imperative for [ORG EU  ] states to stop paying ransoms for kidnapped citizens . 
[PER Douglas  ] described the [MISC EU’s  ] approach to the region as trying to extend central governments’ reach on security and development issues to the whole of their countries , realizing that many problems stem from a center domination over periphery mentality of governance . 
[PER Carter  ] noted that enhancing [LOC CT  ] capability is going to require a country-smart approach that recognizees whether it is the police , military , or security services that are best placed to deal with [LOC CT  ] . 
[PER Douglas  ] agreed that given the urgency of the issues the French-proposed [MISC P-3  ] consultations in October would likely be better held in September . 
Drugs , Trafficking , and [ORG Lawlessness  ] in the [LOC Coastal States LONDON  ] 00001702 002 OF 002 ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Douglas  ] termed the drugs trade and other criminal activities in the [LOC West Africa  ] as “becoming institutionalized , ” especially in [LOC Guinea  ] Bissau and increasing so throughout the coastal states . 
She indicated that the [LOC UK  ] has a good understanding about how the drugs arrive to [LOC West Africa  ] , but not how they go [LOC North from  ] there and how they are related to terrorist issues . 
[PER Carter  ] said the [MISC Northern  ] transit routes are varied across land , air , and sea and that to date there is no information to indicate that the narcotics trade has links with terrorist activities , in particular [ORG AQIM  ] . 
He did add that the [ORG Hizbollah  ] networks in [LOC West Africa  ] might tap into the drug trade due to its high levels of profit . 
[PER Douglas  ] agreed it was important to stymie the drug trade before it becomes more institutionalized , before it destabilizes the region further , and before terrorists begin using it as a source of revenue . 
[ORG ECOWAS/Mano River Union  ] ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Douglas  ] said the [LOC UK  ] had concluded it needs to “up its game” with [ORG ECOWAS  ] , especially as it has recently had some useful political positions , but that it was unclear how it should be supported . 
[PER Carter  ] said that it lacked direction under Executive Secretary Chambos . 
He noted that [ORG ECOWAS  ] requires a national champion . 
However , [LOC Nigeria  ] , which had that role during Obasanjo’s administration , has stepped back under [LOC Yar’Adua  ] . 
[LOC Ghana  ] , the next likely [ORG ECOWAS  ] leader after [LOC Nigeria  ] , had not picked up the ball . 
He said [ORG ECOWAS  ] could best help the region by developing common strategies to deal with issues like counter narcotics . 
[PER Douglas  ] agreed that the [ORG Manor River Union  ] did not amount to much but provided a useful forum for discussion . 
The secretariat did not yet merit support . 
[LOC Nigeria  ] ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Strongly endorsing greater [MISC U.S.-UK  ] dialogue on [LOC Nigeria  ] at the desk officer and technical levels , [PER Douglas  ] agreed that it was important to focus on the critical areas of electoral reform , constitutional succession , and corruption issues with the federal government . 
Assistance should be back-loaded , as the [LOC Nigeria  ] government has the resources to begin initiatives but lacks the political will . 
On the elections , [PER Douglas  ] agreed there is great potential for violence and that while the elections will likely be “bad , ” it will be important to deal with governance and democracy as a process . 
She agreed that working with local civil society organization in the run-up to the elections on both conflict mitigation and transparency issues would be important . 
She also supported working with individual states and governors , corrupt and ineffective as they may be , because they were providing an avenue of engagement and were more effective than the current , largely leaderless federal government. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
