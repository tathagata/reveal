( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] Prominent [MISC Sahrawi  ] pro-independence activist [PER Aminatou Haidar  ] returned safely to the [LOC Western Sahara  ] on December 18 aboard a [MISC Spanish  ] military aircraft . 
She recovered her passport at the airport , completed normal [MISC Moroccan  ] immigration formalities , and proceeded from the airport to her home in the company of family members . 
[MISC Sahrawi  ] activists report that she has terminated her hunger strike ; that she is in very good spirits ; but that she is still in precarious physical condition and under close medical supervision at her home . 
[MISC Western  ] Sahara-based government officials confirm that her arrival took place without incident , and that a spontaneous gathering of well-wishers had taken place with no serious security incidents . 
After having handled the [PER Haidar  ] case in disastrous fashion , the [ORG GOM  ] finally brought the ordeal to an end -- and not a moment too soon . 
However , the case has left the [ORG GOM  ] angry and badly shaken , which will create real challenges as we look toward the next round of formal [MISC UN-led  ] Manhasset talks . 
End Summary. ----------- Home Safely ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Aminatou Haidar  ] , President of the Collective of [ORG Sahrawi Human Rights Defenders  ] ( [ORG CODESA  ] ) and a prominent [MISC Sahrawi  ] pro-independence activist , returned safely to her home in [LOC Laayoune  ] , [LOC Western Sahara  ] , in the early hours of December 18 . 
[PER Haidar  ] arrived shortly after 2:00 AM local time ( [MISC GMT  ] ) aboard a [MISC Spanish  ] military plane specially equipped to handle medical emergencies , and in the company of her sister and a physician . 
By prior agreement among [PER Haidar  ] and the Governments of [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Spain  ] , there were no journalists or other passengers aboard , according to Laayoune-based [MISC Moroccan  ] Ministry of [MISC Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) officials . 
As [PER Haidar  ] arrived , immigration officers met her plane-side and handed her the passport they had confiscated on November 13 ( Ref C ) , and she proceeded to complete normal customs and immigration formalities . 
There was a beefed-up police presence at the airport , but only [PER Haidar  ] 's brother and an uncle came to meet her ; by all accounts , she exited the airport without incident , and they drove her home. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Haidar  ] 's return marked the end of a 35-day exile and of a hunger strike that had reportedly taken a terrible physical toll on her . 
On December 16 , her health had deteriorated to the point that she had to be hospitalized in [LOC Lanzarote  ] , and she remains in precarious but stable condition now at her home in [LOC Laayoune  ] . 
[PER Djimi Elghalya  ] , a [ORG CODESA  ] member and the Vice Chair of the [ORG Association of Victims of Grave Human Rights Violations  ] ( [ORG ASVDH  ] ) , confirmed by phone that [PER Haider  ] has ended her hunger strike and is beginning to take food under close medical supervision ; she is extremely weak , but " her spirit is extremely strong . 
" ---------------------------------- Supporters Jubilant , [LOC Laayoune  ] Calm ---------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At [PER Haidar  ] 's home , a large , jubilant and peaceful crowd turned out in the middle of the night to greet her , according to both press reports and participants . 
[ORG CODESA  ] members told the Embassy that several hundred Sahrawis -- ranging from independence activists to apolitical well-wishers -- gathered to celebrate " a great victory for international law and human rights . 
" Celebrations near her home continued into the late morning , and there were reportedly other gatherings throughout [LOC Laayoune  ] . 
[PER Elghalya  ] said that supporters had intentionally stayed away from the airport , recognizing that the police presence there would be heavy and in a specific effort to avoid any kind of incident . 
However , she added , no one could keep away the " hundreds " who spontaneously gathered at [PER Haidar  ] 's home . 
[PER Elghalya  ] noted that there were also police around [PER Haidar  ] 's home , but they limited themselves to keeping order and did not try to interfere with the celebrations . 
Separately , [PER Mohammed Jelmous  ] , the [MISC Wali  ] of [LOC Laayoune  ] ( i.e. , the Governor and senior [ORG MOI  ] official ) , said that a small group of " youths " who oppose [MISC Western  ] Saharan independence did attempt to gain access to the crowds in front of [PER Haidar  ] 's home , but police quickly ushered them away after one threw a rock that hit -- but did not seriously injure -- a [MISC Spanish  ] journalist . 
Otherwise , the [MISC Wali  ] reported , as of noon [LOC Laayoune  ] time , the city was calm. ------------------------ Comment: An Ordeal Ended ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Haidar  ] 's return comes not a moment too soon , especially in light of the serious down-turn her health had taken in recent days . 
It also brings to a close a disastrous episode for the [ORG GOM  ] , which drew dangerously close not only to perpetrating a case of forced exile , but also to badly jeopardizing its relationships with [LOC Spain  ] and other allies through its belligerent handling of the case and some stunningly maladroit diplomacy . 
Local press and our Laayoune-based [MISC Sahrawi  ] contacts have given enormous credit to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC France  ] and to a lesser extent [LOC Spain  ] for pressing the [ORG GOM  ] to find a solution to the problem . 
[ORG GOM  ] officials have grudgingly acknowledged that the tough -- and consistent -- messages that Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs and Cooperation  ] [PER Taieb Fassi Fihri  ] heard on his recent travels to [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( Ref A ) were crucial to the [ORG GOM  ] 's rather sudden change of heart . 
Even the provincial [MISC Wali  ] in [LOC Laayoune  ] told [MISC PolCouns  ] , " You see , we listen to our friends . 
" This said , we will need to be mindful that the whole [PER Haidar  ] case has left the [ORG GOM  ] badly shaken ; indeed , [MISC Moroccan  ] officials' ( and , we suspect , the other parties' ) anger and distrust , especially toward [LOC Algeria  ] , has reached its highest level in recent years . 
As we look to a fifth round of formal [MISC UN-led  ] Manhasset talks , Ambassador [PER Ross  ] , and we , have our work cut out for us .
