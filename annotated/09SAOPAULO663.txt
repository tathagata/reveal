( C ) Summary: [LOC Sao Paulo  ] offers unique possibilities for [MISC Muslim  ] engagement , many of which were evident throughout Special Representative to [MISC Muslim Communities  ] ( [ORG SRMC  ] ) [PER Farah Pandith  ] 's November 22-23 visit . 
The major [PER Sunni  ] and politically moderate [MISC Muslims  ] were delighted to receive [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] and eagerly shared with her several of their flagship institutions , including the elaborate [PER Santo Amaro Mosque  ] , a [ORG Muslim School  ] that serves a 60 percent non-Muslim student body ( [PER Islam  ] is an elective course ) , and a vigorous interfaith group supporting the [ORG Abraham Path Initiative  ] . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] moderates worry about the rise of fundamentalism and [ORG Hezbollah  ] influence among more recent waves of largely [MISC Shia Lebanese  ] immigrants , as they promote a broadly tolerant vision of " modern [PER Islam  ] " . 
Their own community remains quite traditional , with women 's and youth organizations limited . 
Even so , the traditional leadership 's eagerness to engage , acute awareness of the dangers of radicalism , and their solid achievements in integrating [MISC Muslim  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] identities make them an excellent example of how a unique [ORG MMC  ] ( [ORG Muslim Minority Community  ] ) has , by and large , carved out a positive space within a diverse [MISC Latin American  ] country . 
Post will seek [LOC Washington  ] support to bring down a [LOC U.S.  ] Sheik to help reinforce our engagement efforts as a concrete follow-up to [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] 's highly successful visit . 
End Summary . 
Special Representative [PER Farah Pandith  ] 's Visits [LOC Sao Paulo  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Special Representative to [MISC Muslim Communities  ] ( [ORG SMRC  ] ) [PER Farah Pandith  ] visited [LOC Sao Paulo  ] November 22-23 . 
During the visit , she met with a number of representatives of the city 's [MISC Muslim Communities  ] , visited the [PER Santo Amaro Mosque  ] ( the largest mosque in the city ) and visited an attached [MISC Muslim  ] school , and attended a reception organized by the [ORG Muslim Federation  ] in her honor where [PER Pandith  ] spoke about the [ORG USG  ] 's engagement plans and took questions . 
[ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] also gave a press interview to the major [LOC Sao Paulo  ] daily " [ORG Folha de Sao Paulo  ] " in which she told her story as an [MISC American Muslim  ] . 
The [LOC Sao Paulo  ] [MISC Muslims  ] who received [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] , the bulk of them moderate [MISC Sunnis  ] , reacted enthusiastically to her visit and expressed eagerness about future engagement opportunities . 
Working the [ORG Lebanon Connection  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] began her visit by attending the [ORG Lebanon National Day  ] reception , a 1500-person gala organized by the [MISC Lebanese  ] Consulate and held at [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's prestigious [MISC Lebanese  ] Club on November 22 . 
The majority of [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] immigrants to [LOC Brazil  ] are of [MISC Lebanese  ] background and this event offered wide ranging opportunities to interact with various members of the community , including [PER Sunni  ] , [PER Druze  ] and [PER Shia Sheiks  ] as well as [MISC Muslims  ] working in business , politics and law enforcement . 
The [MISC Santo Amaro Muslim Community  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] visited the [PER Santo Amaro Mosque  ] and associated school November 23 . 
The local [MISC Muslim  ] community built the [PER Mosque  ] , usually attracts 300-350 worshippers on any given Friday , with assistance from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The community also has an [MISC Egyptian  ] cleric who helps with the [PER Mosque  ] 's ministry . 
The mosque is the spiritual centerpiece of a complex of institutions , including a [MISC Muslim  ] high school and a soon-to-be opened nursing school . 
The high school houses 600 students , sixty percent of whom are non-Muslim ( many on scholarships ) and the study of [PER Islam  ] is an elective . 
[PER Mohammed el Zoghbi  ] , President of the [ORG Muslim Federation  ] that sponsors the school spoke with particular pride of the [MISC Santo Amaro Muslim Community  ] 's efforts to do good works that benefit all [MISC Brazilians  ] . 
( [ORG Note: The  ] [ORG Muslim Federation  ] is a moderate [PER Sunni  ] group . 
It is one of several such groups that vie to become an umbrella organization for all of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Muslims  ] . 
End Note ) El [PER Zoghbi  ] noted that the school provides a strong , affordable educational alternative for young [MISC Brazilians  ] living in a " peripheral " area of the city . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [PER Santo Amaro Mosque  ] and [ORG Muslim School  ] are located in a middling to poor neighborhood in a highly socially polarized city . 
End Note . 
) The [ORG Federation  ] is now also constructing a brand new nursing school on the same grounds . 
It will have a 1200-student capacity and is programmed to open in January . 
A Direct Dialogue with Youth <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [ORG SMRC  ] Pandith met with a cross-section of [MISC Muslim  ] students , both male and female , from the high school . 
The young people reported no real difficulties with anti-Islamist sentiments in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Instead , they said that frequently other [MISC Brazilians  ] simply do not understand [PER Islam  ] and are puzzled by the students' religious affiliation . 
A number of the young women lamented how stricter [MISC Islamic  ] customs - the prohibition on drinking , for example - made it difficult for them to socialize with non-Muslim [MISC Brazilian  ] teenagers . 
Overall , the group was friendly and highly accessible . 
The kids evinced interest in learning [MISC English  ] and showed obvious knowledge of [LOC U.S.  ] pop culture . 
None had ever been to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG Abraham Path  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The [MISC Lebanese  ] Consul General , [PER Joseph Sayah  ] , hosted a coffee for [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] where she met [MISC Muslim  ] , [PER Christian  ] and [MISC Jewish  ] leaders who are all behind the [ORG Abraham Path Initiative  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Founded by [ORG Harvard  ] Professor [PER William Ury  ] , the Path program promotes a unique kind of [LOC Middle Eastern  ] tourism . 
It encourages [MISC Muslims  ] , [MISC Christians  ] and [MISC Jews  ] to re-trace [ORG Abraham  ] 's journey in an effort at encouraging contemporary reconciliation between the world 's three great [MISC Abrahamic  ] faiths . 
While the [MISC Brazilians  ] behind this initiative help facilitate [LOC Middle Eastern  ] travel , they also undertake activities in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
They told [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] about a recent " [MISC Friendship Run  ] " they had sponsored that brought together [MISC Muslims  ] , [MISC Christians  ] and [MISC Jews  ] together into one very positive public event . 
[PER Joseph Sayah  ] was incredibly interested in being useful to our mission . 
He saw the value of the new position of the Special Representative and provided [ORG SRMC  ] with many ideas about engagement with [LOC Brazil  ] 's communities but also more broadly how [ORG USG  ] can make an impact using the President 's [ORG Cairo Speech  ] . 
He was enthusiastic about the focus on youth and took [ORG SRMC  ] aside to personally present his dedication to helping the [LOC US  ] government take advantage " of this moment in time " and the " goodwill " out there for the President and our efforts to engage with [MISC Muslims.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Abraham Path  ] sponsors share the overall global goals of the initiative , but they are also impelled by strongly local concerns . 
As [PER Salim Saheen  ] , a [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] banker and [PER Maronite Christian  ] , told [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] , " [ORG Hezbollah  ] is gaining [ adherents ] , " particularly with more recent Shia [MISC Lebanese  ] immigrants . 
Consequently , the moderates want to " push back against the radicals " by promoting popular interfaith activities . 
[ORG Muslim Federation  ] Reception <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The [ORG Muslim Federation  ] organized a 40-person reception for [ORG SMRC  ] [PER Pandith  ] at her hotel on November 23 . 
The [ORG SMRC  ] spoke to the group about Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's vision for the [ORG US Department of State  ] and the way she has asked us to engage with [MISC Muslims  ] . 
[ORG SRMC  ] talked about the new paradigm of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect . 
She spoke about the focus on the next generation ( which was met with great enthusiasm ) and she mentioned the upcoming entrepreneurial summit -- to urge guests to suggest names to post of dynamic and successful young entrepreneurs to be considered . 
[ORG SRMC  ] also highlighted post plans to educate [MISC Brazilian Muslim  ] applicants about our consular procedures and our desire to bring down an [MISC American  ] Sheik . 
Attendees responded very favorably to [PER Pandith  ] 's remarks and several speakers suggested that both [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Muslim  ] business persons and students would welcome greater travel opportunities to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Comment: Beginning a Relationship  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Post 's [MISC Muslim  ] engagement remains a work-in-progress . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's Sunni-Lebanese [MISC Muslim  ] majority is generally a very conservative traditional community in terms of family structure and both youth and women 's groups remain nascent . 
At the same time , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [MISC Sunni Muslim  ] leaders are well aware of the dangers of radicalization , which they have seen grow among the more recent flows of poorer , Shia [MISC Lebanese  ] immigrants . 
In response , they are actively promoting a tolerant " modern " [PER Islam  ] that highlights good works to benefit all [MISC Brazilians  ] , regardless of faith . 
In this , they are reproducing patterns of inter-faith comity from [MISC Lebanese  ] history prior to the 1970s and leveraging [LOC Brazil  ] 's own home-grown tendency to broad cultural tolerance . 
This results in an overall series of [MISC Islamic  ] communities that - while not entirely insulated from radicalization - have strong interfaith connections and live-and-let-live traditions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Engaging [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [MISC Muslims  ] with follow-up programs ( like a visit from a [LOC U.S.  ] Sheik ) would help bolster mainstream [PER Islam  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] , highlight the importance of freedom of religion in [LOC America  ] , the diversity of [PER Islam  ] in [LOC America  ] and debunk the myths that exist about [PER Islam  ] in [LOC America  ] . 
Moreover , such engagement would reinforce the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] [MISC Muslim  ] community 's efforts to share its experience in interfaith relations and general good works with other [MISC Muslim  ] communities around the world . 
For this reason , [LOC Brazil  ] merits its own MMC strategy ( a [ORG Muslim Minority Country  ] strategy ) that builds on the efforts of a generation of [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Muslims  ] who have become adept at forming a [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Muslim  ] identity and founding successful institutions that are at once thoroughly [MISC Muslim  ] and genuinely [MISC Brazilian  ] .
