( [ORG S  ] ) Comment . 
Since [PER Viktor Bout’s  ] arrest in [LOC Bangkok  ] almost a year ago , moving towards a successful extradition to the [LOC United States  ] has been at the top of our bilateral agenda here . 
In addition to Embassy efforts over the months , President [PER Bush  ] raised it with then-Prime Minister [PER Samak  ] during his August 2008 visit to [LOC Bangkok  ] . 
Overall , our sense has been that while the extradition proceedings have been painfully slow ( and have required constant nurturing by our [ORG DOJ  ] and [ORG DEA  ] personnel every step of the way ) , they are moving in the direction we want . 
Lately , however , there have been disturbing indications that [PER Bout’s  ] xxxxxxxxxx and [MISC Russian  ] supporters have been using money and influence in an attempt to block extradition . 
The most egregious example was the false testimony of xxxxxxxxxx that [PER Bout  ] was in [LOC Thailand  ] as part of government-to-government submarine deal . 
Thus , we felt it was time to once again raise the matter at the top of the government and make clear that , while we understand the judicial process must take its course without political interference , we insist that the process be free of corruption and undue influence . 
We will continue to do so in the months ahead . 
We understand [PER AG Holder  ] may soon call the [MISC Thai  ] AG to review the case ( as previous [PER AG Mukasey  ] did three times in addition to his visit to [LOC Bangkok  ] last summer ) . 
Combined with our efforts this week , the call will make for an important one-two punch . 
End Summary and Comment . 
ABHISIT PROMISES TO LOOK INTO IRREGULARITIES IN BOUT CASE --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) During a February 12 meeting at the Parliament , the Ambassador raised with Prime Minister [PER Abhisit Vejjajiva  ] the ongoing extradition case concerning international arms trafficker [PER Viktor Bout  ] . 
( [PER Note: Bout  ] faces terrorism-related charges in federal court in [LOC New York  ] for conspiring to sell millions of dollars of weapons to the [ORG FARC  ] for use in killing [MISC Americans  ] . 
He has remained in custody in [LOC Bangkok  ] since his arrest on March 6 , 2008 . 
End note . 
) The Ambassador noted that , while the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Thailand  ] enjoy a strong extradition relationship , our countries must ensure that the bilateral extradition treaty worked in our most important cases , such as those involving terrorism . 
In this regard , the Ambassador emphasized to [PER Abhisit  ] that the extradition case against [PER Bout  ] is a high priority for the [LOC United States  ] . 
Citing the [MISC United Nations’  ] sanctions against [PER Bout  ] , the Ambassador also noted that the extradition case is one of global importance . 
[PER Abhisit  ] told that Ambassador that he believed that his office had limited means to affect ongoing extradition proceedings , stating that the judicial system was designed to afford due process to the parties and expressing an unwillingness to be seen as “overruling” this process , or “helping one side.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Expressing growing concern about the extradition proceedings , the Ambassador then described evidence showing that the extradition proceedings against [PER Bout  ] have become tainted as a result of the efforts by [PER Bout’s  ] associates to bribe [MISC Thai  ] officials . 
In particular , the Ambassador detailed false testimony on [PER Bout’s  ] behalf from xxxxxxxxxx to the effect that [PER Bout  ] came to [LOC Thailand  ] to conduct official business with the [MISC Thai  ] government relating to a submarine project ; recorded statements by a [MISC Thai  ] associate of [PER Bout  ] that he had procured xxxxxxxxxx to testify on [PER Bout’s  ] behalf ; evidence of bribery schemes gathered throughout the world ; and a scheme to arrest and thereby embarrass two [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats - i.e. , [ORG DEA  ] agents assigned to the [PER Bout  ] investigation - on meritless charges of participating in illegal recordings of [PER Bout  ] on the day of his arrest . 
If the xxxxxxxxxxxx false testimony remained unrebutted , the court could possibly deny extradition based on an erroneous conclusion that [ORG RTG  ] had legitimate dealings with [PER Bout  ] , a [MISC U.N.-sanctioned  ] arms trafficker. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In light of this evidence , the Ambassador asked the Prime Minster to take steps to ensure that the proceedings in [PER Bout’s  ] extradition case were free from the taint of bribery and corruption . 
In particular , the Ambassador suggested that testimony from an authoritative witness from the [ORG Royal  ] [MISC Thai  ] [ORG Navy  ] or the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] should be offered to repudiate the xxxxxxxxxx statement and make clear that the [ORG RTG  ] supports the extradition request . 
The Ambassador also reminded the PM of the recent case of [PER Jamshid Ghassemi  ] , in which the [MISC Thai  ] authorities denied a [LOC U.S.  ] extradition request under apparent pressure from [LOC Iran  ] , and stressed the importance of avoiding a similar result here . 
( [PER Note: Ghassemi  ] is under indictment in [LOC San Diego  ] for violations of the [ORG Arms Export Control Act  ] and money laundering relating to his conspiracy to acquire accelerometers used in missile navigation . 
End note . 
) The Ambassador also stated that Thailand’s failure to ensure an extradition process in [PER Bout  ] that is free from corruption and undue influence would constitute a major setback to the bilateral relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Thailand  ] , especially in the area of law enforcement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After listening to the evidence provided by the Ambassador suggesting that bribery had infected the [PER Bout  ] proceedings , [PER Abhisit  ] committed to addressing any “irregularities” in the extradition case through the “appropriate channels.” At the conclusion of the meeting , the Prime Minister sought the identity of the individuals involved in the bribery schemes , and the [ORG DOJ Attache  ] , who accompanied the Ambassador to the meeting , supplied an aide to the PM with the requested information . 
[ORG DEFENSE MINISTER  ] COMMITS TO LOOKING INTO TESTIMONY --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) During a February 13 introductory call , the Ambassador highlighted to Minister of [ORG Defense Prawit Wongsuwan  ] the importance the [ORG USG  ] places on the [PER Bout  ] extradition proceedings . 
The Ambassador noted that the [ORG USG  ] understood that extradition cases take time and that the [ORG USG  ] respected the [MISC Thai  ] judicial system , but we were concerned about efforts by [PER Bout  ] to improperly influence the proceedings . 
Of particular concern was the false testimony by xxxxxxxxx the Ambassador told [PER Prawit  ] . 
Thexxxxxxxxxx testimony was not true and , as such , it was very important that the [MISC Thai  ] [ORG Navy  ] or the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] correct this falsehood with testimony to the court . 
Doing so would ensure that the proceedings were kept on track and would publicly clarify that the [MISC Thai  ] military was not associated with a [MISC U.N.-sanctioned  ] arms trafficker . 
[PER Prawit  ] told the Ambassador that he was unfamiliar with the case but that he would give priority to looking into the issue to determine the truth regarding the testimony ofxxxxxxxxx . 
The [ORG Defense  ] Minister also committed to examining a non-paper with more details on the testimony of xxxxxxxxxxx that the [ORG DOJ Attache  ] provided to an aide to [PER Prawit  ] .
