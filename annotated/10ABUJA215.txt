Sanders  ] , Ambassador , STATE , EXEC ; REASON: 1.4 ( A ) , ( B ) , ( D ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Ambassador met February 26 with Acting President ( [ORG AgP  ] ) Dr. [PER Goodluck Jonathan  ] at the Vice President’s official residence , [LOC Aguda House  ] , in [LOC Abuja  ] to review the current political situation following the return earlier this week of ailing President [PER Yar’Adua  ] . 
Moves are afoot , between [PER Jonathan  ] and key northerners in the lead such as former [ORG Head of State Gen.  ] [PER Abdulsalami Abubakar  ] , to encourage the [PER Yar’Adua  ] family to let go and let the President resign with dignity . 
This will allow [PER Jonathan  ] to serve as interim President until elections and also allow him to designate a vice president . 
Given the dysfunctional level of the current Cabinet , [PER Jonathan  ] said that once this happens , he will dissolve the cabinet , after consulting with the [ORG Council of State  ] . 
Both moves , he believes , will appease [MISC Northern  ] politicians , as he suspects that more northerners will support the resignation idea . 
[PER Jonathan  ] claims he wants to do a good job over the next 12 months , and leave a legacy of credible elections , electoral reform , including replacing the [ORG Independent National Electoral Commission’s  ] ( [ORG INEC  ] ) chairman and all of the commissioners . 
He promised the Ambassador that he would look at her suggestion of using terminal leave for the [ORG INEC  ] chairman , which could have him out earlier than June . 
The Acting President also agreed to allow [MISC U.S.-UK  ] technical assistance to help improve the voter registry and provide for a parallel vote tabulation . 
He expects things to calm down in the next 10-14 days , will not leave the country until things are resolved , and has opened channels with the military . 
Chief of Army Staff ( [ORG COAS  ] ) was leaving [PER Jonathan’s  ] private office when Ambassador was entering . 
End Summary. ---------------- WHO’S IN CHARGE ? ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Jonathan  ] told the Ambassador “everyone’s confused” about who is in charge of [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
There has been an increase in the level of uncertainty in the internal political situation following ailing President Yar’Adua’s return , which was shrouded in secrecy , during the early hours February 24 . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said he was “unhappy” that the first statement issued following Yar’Adua’s return referred to [PER Jonathan  ] as “Vice President.” The [ORG GON  ] issued a second statement February 25 that reversed course and refers to [PER Jonathan  ] as the Acting President . 
[PER Jonathan  ] said that the [LOC Villa  ] received a lot of pressure to correct this error so that the lines of leadership and executive direction were clear. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG AgP  ] lamented , “This terrible situation in the country today has been created by four people: [PER Turai Yar’Adua  ] [ the ailing President’s wife ] , his Chief Security Officer ( [ORG CSO  ] ) [ [PER Yusuf Mohammed Tilde  ] ] , his [ORG Aide-de-Camp  ] ( [ORG ADC  ] ) [ Col. [PER Mustapha Onoedieva  ] ] and Professor [PER Tanimu Yakubu  ] [ Yar’Adua’s Chief Economic Advisor ] .” The [ORG AgP  ] said he does not know their motives , but expected it was likely for nefarious purposes . 
He added Minister of Agriculture [PER Abba Ruma  ] and [ORG Federal Capital Territory  ] ( FCT ) Minister [PER Adamu Aliero  ] had provided a second-tier of layering to the bubble surrounding [PER Yar’Adua  ] . 
The [ORG AgP  ] noted that “people are angry , ” and did not want to allow those surrounding [PER Yar’Adua  ] to replicate the control and access similar to what they had done in [LOC Jeddah  ] for the past three months. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Jonathan  ] said the [ORG CSO  ] and [ORG ADC  ] saw him separately to let him know that they did not intend to mistreat the [ORG AgP  ] and expressed their willingness to work with him ( which the [ORG AgP  ] doubts ) . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said he told them both “then the best thing is to stop the charade.” The [ORG AgP  ] told the Ambassador he believes [PER Yar’Adua  ] is in a semi-comatose state without an understanding of what is going on around him. ------------- ENCOURAGE PRESIDENT TO RESIGN ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG AgP  ] said that Former [ORG Head  ] of State Gen. [PER Abdulsalami Abubakar  ] , who according to [PER Jonathan  ] has become one of his closest advisors , worked out a strategy where he would reach out to other former [MISC Nigerian  ] Heads of State , including former [ORG Head of State Gen.  ] [PER Yakubu Gowon  ] , to approach those closest to [PER Yar’Adua  ] , especially his wife [PER Turai  ] , to try to convince them that the best , and most dignified step to take for the country and for [PER Yar’Adua  ] as a human being would be for the President to resign . 
This action would constitutionally make [PER Jonathan  ] Nigeria’s President . 
Doing such would also be easier than convincing two-thirds of the 42-member [ORG Federal Executive Committee  ] ( [ORG FEC  ] ) to declare the ailing President “physically incapacitated and medically unfit” to continue in the office of the [LOC Presidency  ] . 
[PER Jonathan  ] said he and his wife , [PER Patience  ] , visited [PER Turai  ] as a humanistic gesture to express their best wishes for the recovery of [PER Yar’Adua  ] and out of respect for his ailing boss . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said under no circumstances did he want [PER Turai  ] to come to his official residence. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Once [PER Yar’Adua  ] resigns and [PER Jonathan  ] becomes interim President , he said he would choose a Vice President that could appease the Northerners by working with them to identify a candidate . 
[ORG AgP  ] [PER Jonathan  ] also shared that until [PER Yar’Adua  ] resigns , and things come down he would not leave the country . 
( N.B. This is in reference to the POTUS invitation to attend the April 12-13 Nuclear Security Summit ) . 
The issue of identifying a northerner as a vice presidential candidate , [PER Jonathan  ] underscored this appears to be the thing most on the minds of the northerners as they feel cheated out of the [LOC Presidency  ] with Yar’Adua’s illness. ------------- FEARS ABOUT MILITARY ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Jonathan  ] said “everyone , including the Army Chief of Staff ( [ORG COAS  ] ) [ LTG [PER Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau  ] ] and Chief of the President Guards Brigade [ BG [PER Abdul Mustapha  ] ] ” are concerned about the confusion over who is the executive of the nation . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said the military chiefs are making sure no politicians are reaching out to the rank-and-file , and encouraging the military to stay in the barracks so that the uncertain political situation does not generate coup-like behavior emanating from the mid-ranks because of the confusion . 
As the Ambassador began her meeting with the Acting President , he had just concluded a meeting with [ORG COAS  ] LTG [PER Dambazau  ] ( see reftel A for Ambassador’s conversation with the [ORG COAS  ] February 24 ) . ---------------- [ORG USG  ] ADVICE: BECOME A NATIONAL FIGURE ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Based on points developed telephonically with Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] ( ref B ) , Ambassador encouraged [PER Jonathan  ] to change the perception that he is a regional figure , and be seen , rather , as a national figure who has the best interest of the nation at heart . 
Ambassador expressed that given that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Nigeria  ] are very best friends , we feel the need to share our concerns , as any good friend would do , and that we are counting on him to steer [LOC Nigeria  ] through this troubled and uncertain period . 
At the moment , [PER Jonathan’s  ] detractors believe he is a surrogate for former President [PER Obasanjo  ] . 
Ambassador advised the [ORG AgP  ] that he needs to publicly demonstrate that he is the sole executor of national issues , not being directed or serving a political purpose for [PER Obasanjo  ] or others , so that his leadership would not be in question and the polity would accept that he had the best interest of nation at hand . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said he appreciated our advice , including publicly holding [PER Obasanjo  ] at arms length . 
He said he would consider taking steps , including possibly convoking the entire diplomatic corps to brief them on the current political climate , using this and other events to demonstrate that he is his own man , and diminish the appearance he is a regional leader. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Jonathan  ] noted that the [MISC Northern  ] politicians would always be uncomfortable with him as president , and he understood the ruling [ORG People’s Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG PDP  ] ) picked him as Yar’Adua’s running mate in 2007 because he represented the [ORG Niger Delta  ] . 
[PER Jonathan  ] said he was handling [ORG Niger Delta  ] issues until the Ministry for [ORG Niger Delta Affairs  ] was created in September 2008 , allowing him to distance himself from being viewed as someone who could only work on that issue. “I was not chosen to be Vice President because I had good political experience , ” he said. “I did not . 
There were a lot more qualified people around to be Vice President , but that does not mean I am not my own man.” However , he said , with the changed circumstances , the [ORG AgP  ] said that his sole focus is to leave a legacy of both electoral reform and credible elections , including changing the entire [ORG Independent National Electoral Commission  ] ( [ORG INEC  ] ) . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said he was appreciative of the Ambassador’s remarks made during the [MISC National Day  ] reception February 25 and Assistant Secretary Carson’s February 24 statement because both provided him with the courage to press forward. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Jonathan  ] shared initially , he had the intention to dissolve the [ORG Cabinet  ] early the week of February 22 , and had planned to make that announcement at the February 24 [ORG FEC  ] meeting , but found out that [PER Yar’Adua  ] was returning , and thus dissuaded him from acting . 
He said the last [ORG Cabinet  ] meeting was disastrous and included yelling and screaming , and it is totally dysfunctional . 
He said he is “not a politician” and had very limited experience as an administrator , but concluded , “I will not tolerate a brawl.” [PER Jonathan  ] said he will dissolve the [ORG Cabinet  ] once he knows people are more comfortable with him being the Acting President or if the current strategy to convince [PER Yar’Adua  ] surrogates and family members to allow the ailing president to resign. ------------------------ ELECTORAL REFORM AND [ORG INEC  ] ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Jonathan  ] agreed to the [ORG USG  ] offer of technical assistance to review and update Nigeria’s national voter registry and funding for a [ORG Parallel Voter Tabulation  ] ( PVT ) . 
The [ORG AgP  ] asked us for a letter formally offering this assistance ( NB: we are providing to him today ) . 
The Ambassador noted the technical assistance could begin as early as the end of March with his approval ( which he gave ) with software installed that can assist with cleaning up the voter registry. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On the [ORG INEC  ] Chairman , Ambassador told the [ORG AgP  ] that the [ORG USG  ] would not continue any election assistance if [PER Iwu  ] remains on seat after June 2010 . 
She described the meeting between A/S [PER Carson  ] and [PER Iwu  ] , noting the latter showed no signs of respect for good governance . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said he understood the [ORG USG  ] would not be able to continue providing technical assistance if the current [ORG INEC  ] chairman remains beyond his five-year mandate that ends in June 2010 . 
Ambassador raised the issue of using Iwu’s terminal leave to get him out sooner . 
The [ORG AgP  ] said he would ask the Secretary to the Government of the [ORG Federation ( SGF  ] ) to inquire if the current chair could take terminal leave , which could have him out as soon as next month . 
[PER Jonathan  ] again said that once he solidifies his position as Acting President or President , and that once the political environment is less uncertain , he would begin taking steps to replace all thirteen of [MISC INEC’s  ] commissioners , and work toward replacing [PER Iwu  ] earlier than June provided he can confirm the amount of terminal leave [PER Iwu  ] has . 
However , the [ORG AgP  ] noted this would not be easy , but he is committed to seeing this through. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Jonathan  ] said he does not anticipate standing for elections in 2011 and that he is not working towards being a presidential candidacy . 
He wants to put into place an electoral structure that will be ready for national elections . 
He did , however , note that , “if they want me to run , that will be something to consider at that time.” However , he stressed that his focus now and for the next 12 months will be on “doing a good job and witnessing respectable and credible elections in 2011.” ----------------------------------------- FIRM UP THE PARTNERSHIP AGAINST TERRORISM ---------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) Ambassador raised with the [ORG AgP  ] the case of [PER Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed  ] ( aka “Talha” ) . 
[PER Talha  ] was indicted earlier this week in [LOC New York  ] on terrorism charges . 
Nigeria’s [ORG State Security Service  ] ( [ORG SSS  ] ) was about to release [PER Talha  ] onto an international flight before [MISC Nigerian  ] police intervened and took him into custody . 
Ambassador underscored that the [MISC SSS’  ] close call in violating an [ORG Interpol  ] Red Notice would not be helpful in making the case for Nigeria’s removal from the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Transportation Safety Administration List  ] of “Countries of Concern.” Ambassador also asked that [ORG SSS  ] appear as witnesses when requested to demonstrate [LOC Nigeria  ] remains a partner to the [LOC U.S.  ] in the international fight against terrorism . 
She added that at least at the Director level , [ORG SSS  ] not only knew about the [ORG Interpol  ] notice , but simply said they did not want to hold him any longer . 
Ambassador added that the [LOC GON  ] police forces did the right thing and stepped in to block the suspect from boarding the plane . 
He is now in police custody . 
Ambassador officially requested that he be turned over to the [ORG FBI  ] agents here to escort him to the [LOC U.S.  ] to stand trial. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) The [ORG AgP  ] said he would call in [ORG SSS  ] Director General Gadzama to clarify the security agency’s role in Talha’s near-release and that if the three [ORG SSS  ] officers implicated had taken such action without authorization , they would face serious implications , including termination . 
Ambassador also took the opportunity to request [PER Jonathan  ] stop repeating that the December 25 attempting bombing case involving [MISC Nigerian  ] Abdulmutallab was an “one-off aberration” and that [LOC Nigeria  ] indeed does have foreign terrorist links and elements operating in country , as exemplified by [PER Talha.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) After two days of uncertainty , that included signals of competing heads of state emanating from the dueling titular references within a [ORG Villa  ] press release , it appears that [PER Jonathan  ] has plans to firmly take the reigns of the presidency , with the support from key northerners and the senior leadership of the military . 
As the Ambassador stepped out of her meeting , at least two Ministers and a Governor were waiting to consult with the Acting President . 
The Acting President’s bottom line is that he would do his best in the job in the next twelve months . 
He also wanted to ensure we understood he would “not be manipulated by anyone.” We believe the [ORG USG  ] is firmly placed to advance our bilateral agenda , including the creation of an environment conducive to free , fair , and credible elections with the approval and assistance of Nigeria’s de facto head of state . 
Even if he decides to contest for the presidency , [PER Jonathan  ] seems sincere in wanting to leave a lasting legacy of electoral reform for [MISC Africa’s  ] most populous nation . 
It is always hard to judge how some will behave ( or surprise you ) when leadership is unexpectedly thrown in their lap . 
The verdict is out on [PER Jonathan  ] and his previously underwhelming personality and performance needs to keep us in the cautious lane , but so far , so good . 
Things are quiet . 
The [MISC COAS  ] is doing the right things . 
[PER Jonathan  ] is reaching out to key respected northerners , like [PER Abdulsalami  ] , which we see as a good thing . 
Our next steps should be to continue to encourage the [ORG AgP  ] on the right path ; help on the push back on [PER Obasanjo  ] through former and current [ORG USG  ] officials ; and , if the drum beat calling for the ailing President to resign picks up speed , we should ensure that we indicate our support for this given that it probably the best thing for the country . 
End Comment .
