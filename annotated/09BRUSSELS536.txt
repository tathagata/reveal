( S//NF ) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: During a March 2-3 visit to [LOC Brussels  ] , [PER Daniel Glaser  ] , Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for [ORG Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes  ] , assured an uncertain [ORG European Union  ] that the [LOC United States  ] remains committed to the dual track approach to [LOC Iran  ] and said we would welcome additional [ORG EU  ] designations targeting [LOC Iran  ] 's proliferation and sanctions evasion activities . 
Delivering an unprecedented classified briefing to over 70 [LOC Middle East  ] and nonproliferation experts from all 27 [ORG EU  ] states and institutions , [PER Glaser  ] encouraged the [ORG EU  ] to move forward on specific designations to support the current international framework targeting [LOC Iran  ] 's illicit conduct through financial measures. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG EU  ] Member [LOC States  ] and officials uniformly praised the [LOC U.S.  ] information-sharing on sanctions and the [LOC U.S.  ] policy review . 
Capturing the predominant sentiment , the [MISC Czech  ] Presidency expressed gratitude for [PER AA/S Glaser  ] 's presentation and confirmation that further [ORG EU  ] measures " would be consistent with the [LOC U.S.  ] policy review " as a signal the [ORG EU  ] " are all waiting for , as this plays an important role in [ORG EU  ] considerations . 
" However , some EUMS were uncertain whether they should move forward on pending designations before the completion of the policy review . 
During the briefing and on its margins , member states' concerns emerged over national economic interests , unintended consequences ( e.g. , hurting average [MISC Iranians  ] , sanctions efficacy , [LOC Iran  ] 's regional role , lawsuits , and international unity ) . 
[PER Glaser  ] 's separate consultations with representatives from the [ORG Council Secretariat and Commission  ] , and Ambassadors of the [LOC Czech Republic  ] ( Presidency ) , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and incoming EU-Presidency [LOC Sweden  ] are reported septel. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The content , tone , and timing of [PER AA/S Glaser  ] 's briefing impressed an appreciative [ORG EU  ] audience as a sign of the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] 's seriousness about engagement with [LOC Europe  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] is predisposed to respond positively to the new [ORG Administration  ] 's policy on [LOC Iran  ] and wants its views taken into account during the policy review stage . 
[PER Glaser  ] 's presentation kept the good feelings going , but also helped bring [ORG EU  ] experts down to earth in terms of specific tasks on which the [ORG EU  ] could usefully focus now . 
We hope the briefing provides a basis for further [ORG USG  ] lobbying in individual [ORG EU  ] Member [LOC States  ] in capitals on pending [ORG EU  ] designations . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. ------------------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] Message: [ORG EU  ] Should Act -- 2009 The Critical Year ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) On March 3 , the [MISC Czech  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency convened a formal meeting of the [ORG EU-27 Iran  ] and non-proliferation experts ( COMOG/CONOP ) to receive a classified briefing from a [LOC U.S.  ] interagency delegation led by [PER AA/S Glaser  ] on measures in the financial and transport sectors to counter [LOC Iran  ] 's illicit conduct . 
The session lasted a little over an hour ( 40 minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of [LOC Q/A  ] ) . 
Given intense [ORG EU  ] interest and in order to set the political context for the detailed technical briefing on specific [LOC U.S.  ] designations that followed , [PER AA/S Glaser  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] policy review on [LOC Iran  ] had not yet finalized , but it was already clear that [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000536 002 OF 004 the [ORG USG  ] would remain committed to a dual track approach to resolving the nuclear issue . 
Consequently , the [LOC United States  ] would welcome [ORG EU  ] actions now to reinforce existing UNSCRs . 
The [ORG EU  ] should act quickly to designate additional high priority proliferation targets. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) To be sure , " engagement " would be an important aspect of a comprehensive strategy to dissuade [LOC Iran  ] from acquiring nuclear weapons . 
However , " engagement " alone is unlikely to succeed . 
Diplomacy 's best chance of success requires all elements combining pressure and incentives to work simultaneously , not sequentially . 
Our shared challenge is to work together in finding the right mix of measures . 
Time was not on our side . 
The international community must urgently choose between several bad options facing us in 2009 ; none of these options were without cost . 
[PER Glaser  ] pointed out that the dynamic nature of the international financial system required that targeted financial sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] must be continually adjusted to maintain , let alone increase , pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Over time , targeted [MISC Iranian  ] entities were finding ways to evade sanctions via front companies and facilitators . 
Without continuous active management on the part of the international community , the measures taken thus far would be rendered merely symbolic gestures. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Glaser  ] stated that the [ORG EU  ] had an important , but time-sensitive , opportunity to help diplomacy succeed by targeting illicit [MISC Iranian  ] conduct that contravened [ORG UN Security Council Resolutions  ] ( UNSCRs ) . 
The international framework for moving forward was already in place , under the auspices of the UNSCRs and the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) . ; we should continue to support and operate within this framework . 
[PER Glaser  ] urged the [ORG EU  ] not to Underestimate its influence on the actions of other key countries and regions . 
Priority Designation Targets ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) AA/S [PER Glaser  ] 's formal presentation provided [LOC U.S.  ] views and specific intelligence on financial and transport entities under active [ORG EU  ] consideration for designation , including [ORG Bank Mellat  ] , the [ORG Export Development Bank of Iran  ] ( [ORG EDBI  ] ) , [ORG Bank Saderat  ] , the [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line  ] ( [ORG IRISL  ] ) , and [ORG Iran Air  ] ( the only entity not yet [MISC U.S.-designated  ] , which [PER AA/S Glaser  ] explained remains a potential target ) . 
Separately , several [ORG EU  ] contacts found our case against [ORG Bank Mellat  ] , [ORG EDBI  ] and shipping companies to be particularly well formulated. ---------------------- [ORG EU  ] Audience , Reactions ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) All 27 [ORG EU  ] Member States ( EUMS ) attended the [MISC Czech  ] Presidency-hosted classified briefing on March 3 in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
Indicative of the [ORG EU  ] 's high level of interest , all but [LOC Slovakia  ] sent their capitals-based nonproliferation working group ( " CONOP " ) technical expert in addition to their [LOC Middle East  ] regional expert ( mixture of capitals- and [MISC Brussels-based  ] ) . 
This was the first time the [ORG USG  ] was welcomed to address this combined [ORG EU  ] expert working group , which meets ad hoc to decide on revising [ORG EU  ] nonproliferation measures against [LOC Iran  ] . 
Permanent institutional staff covering [LOC Iran  ] , sanctions , and nonproliferation attended from the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Commission  ] and [ORG Council Secretariat  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Situation Center  ] ( [ORG SitCen  ] ) , the community 's intelligence coordination unit , also sent several representatives. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Capturing the main sentiment in the room , the [MISC Czech  ] Presidency expressed gratitude for [PER AA/S Glaser  ] 's presentation [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000536 003 OF 004 and confirmation that further [ORG EU  ] measures " would be consistent with the [LOC U.S.  ] policy review " as a signal the [ORG EU  ] " are all waiting for , as this plays an important role in [ORG EU  ] considerations . 
" The [MISC Czechs  ] and several others noted that [LOC U.S.  ] information-sharing was conducive to closer transatlantic cooperation on [LOC Iran  ] policy , predicting this would directly influence internal [ORG EU  ] debate on pending designations of entities and individuals supporting [LOC Iran  ] 's proliferation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Betraying some smaller [ORG EU  ] states' resentment of the [MISC EU-3  ] countries' ( [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] ) prerogatives within the [ORG Council  ] on [LOC Iran  ] policy , [LOC Cyprus  ] pointedly thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation for sharing information with the entire [ORG EU  ] " so all can take an informed decision , " rather than being asked to take action through a " leap of faith " when some EUMS have information but the rest do not . 
" We also welcome that you are stressing the dual-track approach , " [LOC Cyprus  ] added . 
( Comment: The [MISC Cypriot  ] intervention notwithstanding , the [MISC Czechs  ] took considerable risk just in hosting the [LOC U.S.  ] presentation . 
The [ORG EU  ] remains prickly over direct [LOC U.S.  ] participation in their internal discussions and processes , particularly after the bitter divides over [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Czechs  ] suffered some pushback prior to the event . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) At the conclusion of the briefing , a handful of smaller EUMS raised concerns routinely featured in the [ORG EU  ] 's ongoing internal debate over next steps . 
( Note: The [MISC EU-3  ] and [LOC Italy  ] refrained from speaking during the briefing in apparent deference to the rest of the membership who do not enjoy routine access to [LOC U.S.  ] senior [LOC Iran  ] policymakers . 
End Note . 
) Unintended Consequences ? ------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Cyprus  ] , and [LOC Portugal  ] asked about the impact of current sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] on the elite , the broader population , and the deteriorating economy . 
Is the [LOC U.S.  ] concerned that further moves could trigger an anti-Western backlash ? 
Could we target political elites without victimizing or burdening the general population ? 
While expressing support for targeted measures , [LOC Portugal  ] and [LOC Cyprus  ] worried that strengthening sanctions before [LOC Iran  ] 's June presidential elections could prove counterproductive by radicalizing the electorate and leading to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's re-election . 
[LOC Cyprus  ] flagged comments by [MISC Iranian  ] human rights activist [PER Shirin Ebadi  ] against sanctions and stressed that it want to encourage [MISC Iranian  ] moderates . 
[LOC Portugal  ] asked whether the [LOC United States  ] has considered [LOC Iran  ] 's role in the region , e.g. , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and the broader [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER AA/S Glaser  ] concurred that these are all important questions , but pointed out that the international community must choose among a set of bad options in a very compressed timeframe . 
The international community must convey an urgent sense of seriousness -- both to [LOC Iran  ] and to other interested regional stakeholders in order to change strategic calculations and maximize the chance of a diplomatic success . 
By law , [LOC U.S  ] sanctions target those engaged in illicit conduct , including proliferation and terrorist financing . 
Targeting the [LOC Iran  ] 's access to the international financial system offers the best chance of reducing harm to the average population. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) As to the impact of sanctions , [PER Glaser  ] noted that disaggregating the effect of international sanctions and [LOC Iran  ] 's own disastrous economic policies would be nearly impossible . 
Moreover , sanctions must be examined in the context of an overall policy approach and not in isolation . 
A more useful indicator is the perception of [LOC Iran  ] 's [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000536 004 OF 004 decision-makers , who view sanctions as problematic , raising business costs , and necessitating evasive behavior: the elite are reacting as if sanctions are having an impact . 
[LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] ? ----------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] asked for [LOC U.S.  ] views on the roles of [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
[LOC Cyprus  ] referenced the importance of P5 1 unity to ensure [LOC Iran  ] did not circumvent sanctions and promote efficacy , adding " [ORG UN  ] backing is the best way . 
" [PER AA/S Glaser  ] agreed , but argued that we were already required to implement existing UNSCRs . 
This situation demanded a nimble response to changing conditions , including deceptive practices by designated entities . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] closely consults [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] , who must play their parts . 
What Should the [ORG EU  ] Do ? 
Will [LOC U.S.  ] Answer the Mail ? --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] asked what the [LOC U.S.  ] explicitly wanted from [LOC Europe  ] in the diplomatic ( " political " ) track , and whether we plan to respond to the [MISC Iranian  ] President 's earlier letters ( to former President [PER Bush  ] ) . 
[PER AA/S Glaser  ] referred the [MISC Dutch  ] to State on matters of diplomacy . 
On the sanctions front , he noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] policy review should not be a reason for the [ORG EU  ] to stop reviewing its existing sanctions for appropriate next steps . 
Given the tight timeframe , it would be helpful for the [ORG EU  ] to make similar designations to those already included under existing [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions authorities . 
The [ORG Saderat Problem  ] ------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) In his presentation , [PER AA/S Glaser  ] noted [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 and [ORG EU  ] Common Position identification of [ORG Saderat  ] for proliferation concerns , but explained that our domestic designation falls under [LOC U.S.  ] counter-terrorism authorities . 
Although not raised by [LOC Member States  ] in the formal briefing , several [ORG EU  ] contacts ( [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [ORG Council Secretariat  ] and [MISC Czech  ] Presidency ) had raised concerns that the [ORG EU  ] would not be able to act upon the [LOC U.S.  ] basis for designation of [ORG Bank Saderat  ] ( support for terrorist activity ) . 
The [ORG EU  ] Common Position imposing measures against [LOC Iran  ] is strictly limited to proliferation as a legal basis for inclusion on the list . 
Support for terrorist financing is not grounds for inclusion . 
( Comment: As the additional [LOC U.S.  ] information presented was exclusively limited to terrorist financing concerns , some EUMS are questioning whether a sufficient proliferation basis exists for [ORG Saderat  ] 's inclusion under [ORG EU  ] [LOC Iran  ] sanctions . 
The [ORG EU  ] does not/not yet have consensus to include [ORG Saderat  ] in the next round . 
End Comment .
