( C ) [PER Horst Seehofer  ] , an unpredictable politician struggling to regain his party 's hegemony in [LOC Bavaria  ] , revealed only shallow foreign policy expertise when he met Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] on the sidelines of the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] on February 6 . 
[PER Seehofer  ] , Minister President and leader of the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) , did not contradict the Ambassador when he reviewed the new [ORG NATO Afghanistan  ] policy , which implied [PER Seehofer  ] was now on board with the [MISC German  ] governing coalition in this respect . 
Closer to home , he expected the trend away from the major political parties to continue in [LOC Germany  ] , creating opportunities for numerous smaller parties to enter [MISC German  ] statehouses . 
Observers of [PER Seehofer  ] and his leadership of the [ORG CSU  ] may wish to take his public pronouncements with a grain of salt , especially when he contradicts or criticize [MISC American  ] foreign policy goals as he did recently on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] met with [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President and [ORG CSU Party  ] Chairman [PER Horst Seehofer  ] on the margins of the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] on February 6 . 
Referring to his recent visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the Ambassador told [PER Seehofer  ] how impressed he was with the [MISC German  ] operation in the [LOC North  ] , stressing the importance of the new [LOC Afghanistan  ] strategy . 
He praised the nomination of [PER Volker Wieker  ] to new Inspector General of the [MISC German  ] Army , since [PER Wieker  ] had been General [PER McChrystal  ] 's right hand and really knew what was going on . 
The Ambassador further emphasized the point that 2,500 [LOC U.S.  ] soldiers would be sent to the [LOC North  ] , but that [MISC Germans  ] would be in control . 
Maximum effort was necessary , " he said , noting " if we don't try , we fail . 
" Turning to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Seehofer  ] asked about the Ambassador 's assessment of [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Mottaki  ] 's appearance in [LOC Munich  ] , and [PER Murphy  ] answered that [PER Mottaki  ] 's were rather vain and counter-productive efforts that could not be taken seriously. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In general , [PER Seehofer  ] had little to say regarding foreign policy and seemed uninformed about basic things . 
For example , he expressed surprise when State Chancery Minister [PER Siegfried Schneider  ] , also present , emphasized that 20,000 out of the 40,000 [LOC U.S.  ] soldiers in [LOC Germany  ] were stationed in [LOC Bavaria  ] . 
The Ambassador emphasized the excellent [MISC Bavarian-American  ] relations , stressing his visits to the [MISC Bavarian  ] Representation in [LOC Berlin  ] and the many business contacts . 
[PER Seehofer  ] pointed to the economic/financial crisis and was not sure whether the [ORG EU  ] would bail out [LOC Greece  ] . 
He called for better regulation of financial markets , adding that the [ORG CDU/CSU  ] 's coalition partner , the [ORG FDP  ] , was still dreaming about " total liberty , " yet the citizens were more realistic . 
The [MISC Bavarian  ] economy remained strong , he said , but despite relative low unemployment overall , [LOC Bavaria  ] struggled with serious regional economic differences around the state . 
" You no longer buy our cars , " he joked . 
The main problem for the [MISC Bavarian  ] budget was the unresolved situation of [ORG BayernLB  ] , he admitted . 
Federal Health Minister from 1992 to 1998 , [PER Seehofer  ] expressed interest in the chances of success of the [LOC U.S.  ] health reform , expressing his concern about 47 million [MISC Americans  ] who had no health insurance. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador and [PER Seehofer  ] agreed that the political landscape in [LOC Germany  ] had changed radically over the past few years . 
[PER Seehofer  ] did not dare predict an outcome of the May election in [LOC North Rhine  ] [ORG Westphalia  ] . 
Everything was possible , he said . 
[MISC German  ] citizens no longer shrank from voting for the [ORG Left Party  ] and in the long run , the [ORG SPD  ] and [ORG Left Party  ] would likely come together again . 
Five to six parties now had a realistic chance of entering state parliaments , even in [LOC Bavaria  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As chairman of one of the three parties that make up the governing coalition in [LOC Berlin  ] , [PER Seehofer  ] frequently and quite publicly addresses sensitive political issues , including foreign policy . 
Back in December , he gave an interview flatly rejecting an increase of [MISC German  ] soldiers in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which startled many political observers , including [ORG CSU  ] insiders . 
We note that [PER Seehofer  ] has never professed to be a foreign policy expert . 
His strengths are rather more in domestic politics . 
The drop of public support for the [ORG CSU  ] in recent elections has further encouraged [PER Seehofer  ] 's natural instincts to utter populist pronouncements MUNICH 00000029 002 OF 002 rather than substantive statements .
