On [LOC Central African Republic  ] ( CAR ) rebel leader [PER Abdoulaye Miskine  ] 's reported ties with the [ORG GOL  ] , the [MISC French  ] embassy here reports that [PER Miskine  ] has taken up residence at the [LOC GOL-owned Hotel  ] Kabiir . 
CAR President [PER Francois Bozize  ] reportedly told the [MISC French  ] Ambassador that he had raised the [PER Miskine  ] issue while travelling to [LOC Tripoli  ] in December 2008 . 
Apparently unaware that [PER Miskine  ] was in the country , [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] reportedly offered to have him arrested and delivered to [PER Bozize  ] to take back to [LOC Bangui  ] . 
[PER Bozize  ] declined , apparently due to concerns about how the international community would react . 
The [MISC French  ] assess that al-Qadhafi is " annoyed and jealous " of [LOC Gabon  ] 's role in the peace process and sought a higher profile for al-Qadhafi as a possible joint mediator .
