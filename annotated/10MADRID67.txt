End summary . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador congratulated [PER Rajoy  ] on the [ORG Popular Party  ] , s ( [ORG PP  ] ) electoral successes in 2009 and its improving poll numbers . 
He noted he hopes to have as good a relationship with the opposition as with the government . 
[PER Rajoy  ] reciprocated that wish . 
The Ambassador stressed the importance of good bilateral relations , citing [MISC AFPAK  ] as one area where the two countries can and must work together . 
The Ambassador noted that President [PER Obama  ] , s has identified [MISC AFPAK  ] as the central front in the fight against terrorism , and that the President has shifted the [LOC U.S.  ] orientation toward partnership with our allies . 
[PER Rajoy  ] cited the shared principles and values of [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , noting the [ORG PP  ] has supported the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and would continue to do so . 
He specifically mentioned that the [ORG PP  ] supports sending more [MISC Spanish  ] troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( he made no reference to his public questioning a few weeks ago of the government , s plans to do just that ) . 
The Ambassador expressed appreciation for [LOC Spain  ] 's initial committment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and for plans to send more troops . 
He said the expression of [ORG PP  ] support is heartening . 
[LOC Iran  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG Ambassador  ] stressed the importance the [LOC U.S.  ] attaches to [MISC European  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] support for tougher sanctions . 
He said the first track of the two track strategy is not working and explained the [LOC U.S.  ] is working on a new [ORG UNSCR  ] and with allies such as [LOC Spain  ] to find ways to enhance existing sanctions and develop new ones . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said that the [ORG PP  ] fully shares [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about [LOC Iran  ] and assured the [ORG Ambassador  ] the party is supportive . 
[ORG IPR  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] described his strong commitment to helping [LOC U.S.  ] business compete in [LOC Spain  ] , noting that the [ORG IPR  ] situation is a major concern , especially for the [LOC U.S.  ] music and film industries . 
He noted [ORG MPAA  ] head [PER Dan Glickman  ] called him the day before to register concerns about [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said that at a recent movie premiere in [LOC Madrid  ] , [ORG Warner Brothers'  ] executives reported sales of new release DVDs were down 80 percent . 
[PER Rajoy  ] , whose party has in recent weeks objected to a [ORG GOS  ] legislative proposal that would authorize shutting down websites that promote piracy , said this is a great debate in [LOC Spain  ] and there are diverse opinions , including a vocal community of internet users . 
He said the [ORG PP  ] is asking for appropriate judicial safeguards for shutting down websites and is working to find the appropriate balance between [ORG IPR  ] protection and freedom of expression . 
He noted the issue is not only important economically but politically . 
Nevertheless , he assured the [ORG Ambassador  ] that the [ORG PP  ] wants to play a constructive role and promised to keep an eye on the issue . 
[MISC Spanish  ] Economy <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Rajoy  ] described the principal difference between the [ORG PP  ] and the government as being the handling of the economy . 
He noted the news that [LOC Spain  ] was now paying one percent more than [LOC Germany  ] in interest on its debt . 
He said the deficit is over ten percent of GDP -- twice what it was two years ago -- and unemployment is nearly 20 percent . 
He said maintaining social benefits under these circumstances will be difficult and [LOC Spain  ] needs reforms . 
He added that [LOC Spain  ] , s immigration policies also need a dose of " common sense . 
" [LOC Latin America  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Rajoy  ] stressed the interests of [LOC Spain  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
He noted he had been to [LOC Cuba  ] three times , but the poverty there and the plight of the dissidents made it a depressing experience . 
He said the [ORG PP  ] appreciated the [LOC U.S.  ] policy . 
The Ambassador noted that the new [LOC U.S.  ] President of the [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] , [PER Senator Menendez  ] , is deeply interested in the issue. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Rajoy  ] said [PER Moragas  ] would attend the [MISC Lobo  ] inauguration in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
He and [PER Moragas  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] MADRID 00000067 002.2 OF 002 handling of the [LOC Honduras  ] situation and said the [ORG PP  ] is following the [LOC U.S.  ] line . 
[PER Rajoy  ] mentioned [LOC Argentina  ] , where he said 40 percent of the population is of [MISC Spanish  ] descent , as a country of great potential and continual crisis . 
He noted [LOC Spain  ] has large business interests there but the situation was " complicated " given the lack of judicial security . 
He compared the climate for [MISC Spanish  ] business in [LOC Argentina  ] unfavorably with that in [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] , said [PER Rajoy  ] , is a " disaster . 
" He described [PER Chavez  ] as buying friendship in [LOC Central America  ] with oil while [LOC Venezuela  ] is being destroyed . 
He noted the plight of [MISC Spanish  ] citizens there facing expropriations ( [PER Rajoy  ] mentioned his father in law had worked in [LOC Venezuela  ] ) . 
Comment <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Rajoy  ] was clearly eager to establish a rapport with the Ambassador . 
While his comments on [LOC Afghanistan  ] were welcome , we would be pleasantly surprised if the [ORG PP  ] resisted the temptation to take its shots at the [ORG GOS  ] in the pending congressional debate on the additional troops . 
However , we expect that in the end the [ORG PP  ] will not vote against sending more troops . 
Likewise , on [ORG IPR  ] we took [PER Rajoy  ] 's message to be that while the [ORG PP  ] understands the need for [LOC Spain  ] to do more , it is going to extract whatever political benefit it can from the debate over exactly what mechanism [LOC Spain  ] uses to shut down pirating websites .
