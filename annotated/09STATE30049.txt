( [ORG U  ] ) March 24 ; 1:00 p.m. ; [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Participants: [LOC U.S.  ] The Secretary Charge d’Affaires [PER Dan Clune Dr.  ] [PER Anne-Marie Slaughter  ] , [PER S/P Glyn Davies  ] , [ORG EAP  ] PDAS [PER Robert Wood  ] , Acting Spokesman [PER Joseph Macmanus  ] , Executive Assistant to the Secretary [PER Aleisha Woodward  ] , [PER EAP/ANP  ] notetaker [LOC AUSTRALIA  ] Prime Minister [PER Kevin Rudd Ambassador  ] [PER Dennis Richardson Duncan Lewis  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] Alister [LOC Jordan  ] , Chief of Staff [PER Philip Green  ] , [ORG Senior Foreign Policy Advisor  ] Andrew [PER Charlton  ] , [ORG Senior Economic Policy Advisor  ] [PER David Stuart  ] , Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Patrick Suckling  ] , Assistant Secretary [PER Mark Pierce  ] , Political Minister [PER Counsellor Scott Dewar  ] , [ORG Senior Advisor  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) SUMMARY . 
In a 75-minute lunch following [ORG Rudd’s White House  ] meeting , the Secretary and [PER PM Rudd  ] discussed [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [ORG Rudd’s Asia Pacific  ] community initiative . 
[PER Rudd  ] complimented the [LOC United States’  ] recent “creative play” on [LOC Iran  ] . 
The Secretary noted the President’s video message and said inviting [LOC Iran  ] to participate in the March 31 [ORG Hague Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] had caused confusion in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------ [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] AND [LOC PAKISTAN  ] ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) The Secretary and [PER PM Rudd  ] agreed on the importance of making progress in building up the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] . 
[PER Rudd  ] confirmed FM [PER Stephen Smith  ] would represent [LOC Australia  ] at the March 31 [ORG Hague Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where the Secretary indicated the [LOC United States  ] would lay out specific goals. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) The Secretary and [PER PM Rudd  ] discussed the need to turn [LOC Pakistan  ] away from its “obsessive focus” on [LOC India  ] , towards the problems in the west of the country , noting even total success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would be unraveled if [LOC Pakistan  ] were to fall apart . 
[PER Rudd  ] indicated [LOC Australia  ] was willing and able to help , especially in special operations and counterinsurgency areas , as soon as [LOC Pakistan  ] was willing to accept help , but argued the necessary economic development assistance and capacity-building in Pakistan’s security forces could only happen once the elites came to recognize the problem . 
The best way to cause such a realization would be to hold up a mirror showing what [LOC Pakistan  ] would look like in five years if no action is taken . 
While [LOC China  ] would undoubtedly be reluctant to do more , [PER Rudd  ] continued , a similar [MISC China-Pakistan  ] mirror-holding exercise would be beneficial as well . 
The Secretary agreed [LOC China  ] needed to be more engaged in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , opining [MISC Chinese  ] leaders were growing concerned that extremists’ success in [LOC Pakistan  ] could be a harbinger of similar success in [MISC China’s  ] west . 
She noted that [MISC Chinese  ] FM [PER Yang  ] would attend the March 31 [ORG Hague Conference.  ] ----- [LOC CHINA  ] ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) PM [PER Rudd  ] said [MISC Chinese  ] Politburo member [PER Li Changchun  ] had indicated [MISC Chinese  ] leaders viewed the [MISC Secretary’s  ] recent visit to [LOC Beijing  ] as a success and felt they could deal with the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
The Secretary affirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] desire for a successful [LOC China  ] , with a rising standard of living and improving democracy at a pace [MISC Chinese  ] leaders could tolerate , noting the impressive achievements in [MISC Chinese  ] democracy at the village level . 
We wanted [LOC China  ] to take more responsibility in the global economic sphere , create more of a social safety net for its people , and construct a better regulatory framework for the goods [LOC China  ] manufactures . 
The Secretary also noted the challenges posed by [MISC China’s  ] economic rise , asking , “How do you deal toughly with your banker ? ” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) Calling himself “a brutal realist on [LOC China  ] , ” [PER Rudd  ] argued for “multilateral engagement with bilateral vigor” -- integrating [LOC China  ] effectively into the international community and allowing it to demonstrate greater responsibility , all while also preparing to deploy force if everything goes wrong . 
[PER Rudd  ] said the [MISC Australian  ] intelligence community keeps a close watch on [MISC China’s  ] military modernization , and indicated the forthcoming [MISC Australian  ] Defence White Paper’s focus on naval capability is a response to [MISC China’s  ] growing ability to project force . 
[PER Rudd  ] would send the Secretary a copy of his April 2008 speech at [ORG Peking University  ] in which he had argued that [MISC China’s  ] idea of a harmonious world , based on the philosophy of [PER Kang Youwei  ] , and the [MISC West’s  ] concept of a responsible stakeholder were not incompatible. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) Reviewing recent [MISC Chinese  ] leaders , [PER Rudd  ] assessed that [PER Hu Jintao  ] “is no [PER Jiang Zemin.”  ] No one person dominated [MISC Chinese  ] leadership currently , although Hu’s likely replacement , [PER Xi Jinping  ] , had family ties to the military and might be able to rise above his colleagues . 
[PER Rudd  ] explained that the [ORG Standing Committee  ] of the [ORG Politburo  ] was the real decision-making body , which then passed decisions for implementation by the [ORG State Council.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) [PER Rudd  ] noted [MISC Chinese  ] leaders were paranoid about both [LOC Taiwan  ] and [LOC Tibet  ] , but with subtle differences ; leaders’ reactions on [LOC Taiwan  ] were sub- rational and deeply emotional , whereas hard-line policies on [LOC Tibet  ] were crafted to send clear messages to other ethnic minorities . 
[PER Rudd  ] indicated that he had suggested to [MISC Chinese  ] leaders that they consider a “small ‘a’ autonomy deal with the [MISC Dalai  ] Lama.” While giving little prospect of success , [PER Rudd  ] contended the best chance would be if someone of the [MISC Secretary’s  ] stature had “a quiet conversation” with the [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] member responsible for [LOC Tibet  ] sometime after the furor over the 50th anniversary of the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] exile subsides , and suggested a “third track discussion” of the long-term modalities for how such an autonomy deal could work. ------ [LOC RUSSIA  ] ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) In light of his upcoming meeting with [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] , [PER Rudd  ] asked for insights into [MISC Russian  ] political dynamics . 
The Secretary said [PER Medvedev  ] was looking for legitimacy and positioning vis--vis PM [PER Putin  ] even as [PER Putin  ] was dissatisfied with the role he has carved out for himself - behind the scenes puppeteer and lead on energy policy - but somewhat bound through 2012 since he had ceded other issues to [PER Medvedev  ] . 
Asked whether the [LOC United States  ] viewed [PER Medvedev  ] as more liberal than [PER Putin  ] , the Secretary indicated [MISC Medvedev’s  ] desire for status and respect could cause him to be . 
[PER Rudd  ] agreed , opining Russians’awareness of how their leaders were viewed internationally could help improve [MISC Medvedev’s  ] domestic standing . 
The Secretary also explained [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to reset the layered and complex relationship and briefly outlined a list of issues we wanted to work together on , including counterterrorism , arms reduction , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and human rights. ----------------------- [ORG Asia Pacific Community  ] ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [PER C/Rel Aus  ] ) Noting [MISC Russia’s  ] interest in being included in [MISC Asian  ] regional architecture , [PER Rudd  ] explained the thinking behind his [ORG Asia Pacific  ] community ( [ORG APC  ] ) initiative mostly as an effort to ensure [MISC Chinese  ] dominance of the [ORG East Asia Summit  ] ( [ORG EAS  ] ) did not result in a “Chinese [PER Monroe Doctrine”  ] and an [ORG Asia  ] without the [LOC United States  ] . 
Expressing appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] reengagement in the region , [PER Rudd  ] said [LOC China  ] could succeed only if the [LOC United States  ] ceded the field . 
He recognized the lack of appetite for a new organization and said the [ORG APC  ] could be created by expanding APEC’s mandate or the EAS’ membership . 
[PER Rudd  ] emphasized the long-term horizon of his initiative ( his vision is for an [ORG APC  ] established by 2020 ) and hoped his [ORG APC  ] could fulfill a role similar to the [ORG Helsinki Commission  ] in [LOC Europe  ] , focusing at least initially on low-level common security policy and coordination , perhaps starting with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief . 
[PER Rudd  ] promised to send a draft-stage journal article outlining his [ORG APC  ] initiative in more detail .
