FM [PER Yu  ] on: Prospects for [MISC North-South  ] Summit... --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a January 11 meeting with Special Envoy for [MISC North Korean  ] Human Rights Issues [PER Robert King  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Yu  ] Myung-hwan downplayed press speculation that a [MISC North-South  ] summit is imminent . 
The [ORG ROK  ] was discussing the issue with the [ORG DPRK  ] , [PER Yu  ] said , noting that there were two major [LOC Blue House  ] preconditions: the nuclear issue had to be on the agenda and the [ORG ROK  ] would not pay the [LOC North  ] to hold a summit . 
[PER Yu  ] speculated that it would “take some time” for the [ORG North Koreans  ] to “digest” the preconditions. ...Rumors of a [ORG KJI Visit  ] to [MISC China...  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Yu  ] asserted that [PER Kim Jong-il  ] ( [ORG KJI  ] ) would visit [LOC China  ] in late January or early February . 
The [MISC North Korean  ] leader had visited the [ORG PRC  ] twice before in that timeframe , [PER Yu  ] related , adding that [ORG KJI  ] needed both [MISC Chinese  ] economic aid and political support to stabilize an “increasingly chaotic” situation at home . 
In particular , FM [PER Yu  ] claimed that the [ORG North’s  ] botched currency reform had caused “big problems” for the regime and that the power succession from [ORG KJI  ] to [PER Kim Jong-eun  ] was “not going smoothly.” Moreover , [PER Yu  ] confided , an unspecified number of high-ranking [MISC North Korean  ] officials working overseas had recently defected to the [ORG ROK  ] . 
( [PER Note: Yu  ] emphasized that the defections have not been made public . 
End note . 
) ...Pressuring [LOC Beijing  ] on [LOC Refugees...  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Yu  ] thanked Ambassador [PER King  ] for stating that he intended to work closely with the [ORG ROK  ] on the issue of improving human rights conditions in [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[PER Yu  ] also expressed appreciation for Ambassador King’s willingness to engage the [MISC Chinese  ] on the issue of [MISC North Korean  ] refugees . 
[PER Yu  ] said he has repeatedly raised the matter with [LOC PRC  ] FM [PER Yang  ] , only to get a boilerplate response emphasizing that [ORG North Koreans  ] in [LOC China  ] are economic migrants . 
[PER Yu  ] claimed that the number of [ORG North Koreans  ] fleeing into [LOC China  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX continues to increase ; 2,952 [ORG North Koreans  ] made it to the [ORG ROK  ] in 2009 and more than that are expected in 2010 . 
[PER Yu  ] noted that at least 80 percent of the refugees who come to the [MISC South  ] are women , adding that they are often abused by human traffickers . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [PER Yu  ] added that he was skeptical that the [ORG DPRK  ] would engage in dialogue with the [ORG EU  ] about human rights. ...and [ORG Humanitarian Assistance  ] to the [LOC North  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Responding to a question from Ambassador King , [PER Yu  ] said the [MISC North Korean  ] grain harvest was approximately 4 million metric tons ( [ORG MMT  ] ) , which was better than expected but still short of the 4.5 [ORG MMT  ] the regime needs to ensure stability . 
( [PER Note:  ] The official [ORG ROKG  ] estimate is that the [ORG DPRK  ] harvest was approximately 5 [ORG MMT  ] . 
End note . 
) Given the [ORG North’s  ] chronic transportation and storage problems , there would be starvation “here and there” during the spring , [PER Yu  ] lamented . 
The foreign minister said the [ORG ROK  ] would be willing to provide “significant” food aid to the [ORG DPRK  ] if [LOC Pyongyang  ] asked for it and agreed to monitoring . 
The [ORG ROK  ] would not , [PER Yu  ] said , simply give the [LOC North  ] a huge amount of grain . 
Any aid would be given in small amounts , he stressed . 
The foreign minister also said the [ORG ROK  ] would help fund work by [ORG NGOs  ] to combat multi-drug-resistant [ORG TB  ] in the [LOC North  ] , which has spread widely within the DPRK’s chronically malnourished population . 
Follow-On Lunch with XXXXXXXXXXXX -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At a lunch following the meeting with [ORG XXXXXXXXXX  ] reiterated the [MISC FM’s  ] call for the [LOC United States  ] to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thanked Ambassador King for his willingness to keep the [ORG ROK  ] updated on discussions between the [ORG American Red Cross  ] and its [ORG DPRK  ] counterpart regarding potential reunions between [MISC Korean-Americans  ] and their relatives in [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [LOC North Korea  ] has made only token efforts to support [MISC North-South  ] family reunions and has “reacted badly” to Seoul’s repeated calls for the release of the approximately 1,000 abductees and POWs believed to be still held by the [ORG DPRK  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stressed that [LOC Seoul  ] appreciated Ambassador King’s effort to keep the family reunion , abductee , and POW issues on the proverbial agenda .
