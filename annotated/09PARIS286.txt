( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Veteran [LOC Middle East  ] troubleshooter and former [MISC French  ] Ambassador to [LOC Syria  ] ( among other posts ) [PER Jean-Claude Cousseran  ] assessed that recent improvements in [MISC Syrian  ] behavior constituted a tactical shift rather than a strategic change of behavior ; nevertheless , he felt the [LOC West  ] should exploit that shift while it lasted . 
He characterized trying to split [LOC Syria  ] away from [LOC Iran  ] as " a nice idea " that would never work , and argued that if the [LOC U.S.  ] were to engage [LOC Damascus  ] , it should " get something tangible " and appoint a heavyweight ambassador . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Jean-Claude Cousseran  ] is arguably the most distinguished [MISC French  ] Arabist of his generation . 
A former ambassador to [LOC Syria  ] ( 1993-96 ) and to [LOC Egypt  ] ( 2002-2005 ) , [PER Cousseran  ] was the director of the [LOC DGSE  ] , [LOC France  ] 's external intelligence service , during 2000-2002 . 
He also served as President [PER Chirac  ] 's Special Envoy for [LOC Lebanon  ] and as the [ORG MFA  ] 's Director for the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] ( [ORG NEA A/S  ] equivalent ) . 
He is currently the Secretary General of [LOC France  ] 's [ORG Academie Diplomatique Internationale  ] , a foreign policy think tank established in the 1920s , and a member of the [ORG MFA  ] 's nine-person [ORG Foreign Affairs Council  ] . 
The veteran of innumerable diplomatic missions to [LOC Damascus  ] , in particular during the 2007 effort to help the [MISC Lebanese  ] elect a successor to [PER Emile Lahoud  ] , he is the ultimate " eminence grise " when it comes to [LOC France  ] 's relations with [LOC Syria  ] . 
Is [LOC Syria  ] 's Change in Behavior Real ? ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a recent meeting with [ORG Post  ] 's [ORG NEA  ] Watcher , [PER Cousseran  ] said the [MISC Syrian  ] regime has clearly chosen to change the tone of its dealings with the [LOC West  ] and has made a number of gestures to President [PER Sarkozy  ] to demonstrate that [LOC Damascus  ] can play a positive role in the region . 
[PER Cousseran  ] interpreted this [MISC Syrian  ] move as a tactical shift rather than a strategic change of behavior . 
Nevertheless , he argued that the change -- whatever its meaning -- was tangible and had diminished the influence of hardliners in President [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] 's inner circle , such as former [PER FM Farouk  ] al-Shara. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The trick for the West , he continued , is to determine how best to exploit this opportunity while it lasts . 
Splitting [LOC Syria  ] from [LOC Iran  ] is a nice idea but would never work . 
" This is a secular regime that sees itself belonging to the [LOC Shia  ] universe , and has been trying for more than twenty years to demonstrate its [LOC Shia  ] characteristics . 
The [MISC Alawites  ] know that even if they have good relations with the [MISC Saudis  ] and the [MISC Lebanese  ] , and even if they make peace with [LOC Israel  ] , at the end of the day the [MISC Sunnis  ] will still hate them . 
If it comes to violence , they know the only power that will stand with them is [LOC Iran  ] , " said [PER Cousseran  ] . 
He added that the regime 's hatred of the late [PER Yasser Arafat  ] and [PER Rafik Hariri  ] reflected this fundamental distrust of [LOC Syria  ] 's [MISC Sunni  ] neighbors . 
Two Bits of Advice ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Cousseran  ] offered two bits of advice in the event that the [LOC U.S.  ] were to engage with [LOC Damascus  ] . 
First , he urged that [LOC Washington  ] should " get something tangible " from the [MISC Syrian  ] regime . 
He cautioned that the [MISC Syrians  ] were masters of avoiding any real concessions and were adept at showering visitors with wonderful atmospherics and delightful conversations before sending them away empty handed . 
On the other hand , he also warned against over-reaching . 
" If the [LOC U.S.  ] were to aim for something too difficult , such as urging [LOC Syria  ] to sever its ties to [ORG Hamas  ] or [ORG Hizballah  ] , than it would get nowhere , " he said . 
Second , he urged that [LOC Washington  ] send a powerful ambassador to [LOC Damascus  ] . 
" You need someone like [PER Edward Djerejian  ] or [PER Chris Ross  ] , someone who can be a real player . 
Remember that there is a very tiny circle of advisors around [PER Bashar  ] , and it contains both hawks and moderates . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador needs to be a player so that he or she can be one of those voices influencing [PER Bashar  ] , " said [PER Cousseran  ] .
