THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST . 
PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 9. ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S//NF ) August 13 , 2004 marked the 18-month anniversary of the [ORG FARC  ] 's kidnapping of three [MISC American  ] crewmembers after a [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] single-engine [ORG Cessna  ] crashed . 
The most significant change since the one-year update in reftel ( NOTAL ) has been the initiation and impressive progress of the [ORG COLMIL  ] 's [MISC Plan Patriota Phase IIB  ] , which targets [ORG FARC  ] strongholds in southeastern [LOC Colombia  ] . 
Given the operations , progress , it is possible that the [ORG FARC  ] moved the hostages into a less volatile area , such as the [LOC Correguaje  ] region , where the [ORG FARC  ] has well-developed hostage camp infrastructure . 
Although [ORG Embassy  ] has not received any proof-of-life since July 2003 , we assess that the hostages are still alive given their high value . 
Sources indicate , however , that the [ORG FARC  ] would kill the hostages rather than allow a rescue . 
[ORG Embassy  ] continues to hold biweekly interagency meetings to discuss the status , strategize and consider new leads . 
End Summary. ---------- BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S//NF ) August 13 , 2004 , marked 18 months of captivity for [PER Thomas R. Howes  ] , [PER Marc D. Gonsalves  ] , and [PER Keith D. Stansell  ] , whose [ORG SOUTHCOM Reconnaissance System  ] single engine [ORG Cessna  ] 208 Caravan aircraft crashed in northern [ORG Caqueta Department  ] . 
Two other members of the crew -- [LOC U.S.  ] citizen [PER Tom Jannis  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] Army [ORG Sergeant Luis Cruz  ] -- were executed shortly after the crash when they apparently refused to follow [ORG FARC  ] orders to move quickly out of the area . 
Their bodies were found about a mile from the crash site . 
The [ORG FARC  ] took 24 days to bring the three surviving [MISC American  ] citizens to the first holding encampment. ------------------------- STATUS AT EIGHTEEN MONTHS ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S//NF ) Since our one-year assessment , the [ORG COLMIL  ] has begun a major military offensive in the [LOC Yari  ] region known as [MISC Plan Patriota Phase IIB  ] ( [ORG PPIIB  ] ) . 
The offensive has made serious inroads into [ORG FARC  ] strongholds , which may have prompted the [ORG FARC  ] to move the hostages to a more secure area . 
A recent source claims the hostages are now located in the remote , mountainous [LOC Correguaje  ] region of northern [ORG Caqueta  ] and western [ORG Meta Departments  ] . 
This region is near well-developed [ORG FARC  ] hostage camp infrastructure and lies outside the [ORG PPIIB  ] area of operations . 
Post is following up on all leads , but we do not have credible , precise information on the hostages' location. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S//NF ) While the hostages are susceptible to a variety of jungle maladies , on balance we believe that they receive medical treatment and adequate food given their value to the [ORG FARC  ] . 
At the same time , [ORG FARC  ] leadership has made it clear that , as they have in other situations , they it would kill the hostages rather than permit a successful rescue . 
We believe the [ORG FARC  ] would first attempt to move them and only execute them as a last resort . 
Due to ongoing [ORG PPIIB  ] operations , it is possible the [ORG FARC  ] could use the hostages as " human shields " against [ORG COLMIL  ] incursions into [ORG FARC  ] strongholds. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S//NF ) The [ORG Embassy  ] continues to collect all available intelligence related to hostage locations and has implemented a " Rewards for Justice " program for information leading to their safe return . 
This program has recently generated additional leads due to new ads placed in newspapers and on the radio outside [LOC Bogota  ] . 
In addition , the [MISC MilGroup  ] 's [ORG Regional Information Support Team  ] ( RIST ) provided 75,000 leaflets for dissemination around the areas of [LOC Larandia  ] , [LOC San Vicente  ] del [LOC Caguan  ] , and [PER Florencia  ] on July 9 . 
These programs have been successful in spurring walk-ins but so far have not yielded verifiable information on the hostages' whereabouts . 
We hold hostage status meetings biweekly with representatives from the [ORG Embassy Intelligence Fusion Center  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG MilGroup  ] , the [ORG Office of Regional Affairs  ] , [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration  ] , the [ORG Narcotics Affairs Section  ] and the [ORG Executive Office  ] . 
Nevertheless , since leads go stale in a matter of hours , any rescue mission would have to be launched with [LOC U.S.  ] forces based in [LOC Colombia  ] and briefed to respond. --------------------------------------------- ---------- [ORG FARC  ] STRATEGY MURKY ; [ORG COLMIL  ] INCAPABLE OF HOSTAGE RESCUE --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S//NF ) The [ORG FARC  ] may consider the hostages to be a bargaining chip with President [PER Uribe  ] in negotiating a trade of political hostages for imprisoned [ORG FARC  ] commanders and troops . 
One intelligence report mentioned that some [ORG FARC  ] elements are lobbying to release the [LOC U.S.  ] hostages to embarrass the [ORG GOC  ] and diminish [LOC U.S.  ] support for [MISC Colombian  ] anti-terrorism efforts . 
Unfortunately , an unconditional hostage release by the [ORG FARC  ] is highly unlikely ; in the past they have always sought a quid pro quo. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S//NF ) Based on our analysis of the [MISC Colombian  ] Military 's training , equipment and tactics , the [MISC Colombian  ] military is not capable of conducting a hostage rescue operation without endangering the lives of the hostages . 
President [PER Uribe  ] has told us he would allow a unilateral [LOC U.S.  ] effort to release the hostages , and we believe the security forces -- with some ruffled feathers -- would accept his decision to do so . 
It is clear , however , given the likely remote location of the hostages when , and if a rescue is attempted by [LOC U.S.  ] forces that some involvement of [MISC Colombian  ] military is inevitable . 
The degree to which we can count on [ORG COLMIL  ] participation will depend on the nature of our cooperation and our relationship with the [ORG COLMIL  ] rescue units. -------------------------- COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S//NF ) The hostages , fate remains uncertain despite the recent [ORG GOC  ] proposal to release 50 imprisoned [ORG FARC  ] members in exchange for political and military hostages , including the three [MISC Americans  ] . 
President [PER Uribe  ] has made it clear that any humanitarian exchange must include the three [MISC American  ] hostages . 
The [ORG FARC  ] rejected the [ORG GOC  ] proposal in an August 22 communique . 
The [ORG FARC  ] continues to press for an unconditional exchange of jailed terrorists for kidnap victims that the [ORG GOC  ] cannot accept . 
The [ORG FARC  ] does not/not explicitly include the [MISC Americans  ] in their proposals. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S//NF ) The limited intelligence we get on the hostages seems to have a short life . 
We believe they are moved frequently , so intelligence on their whereabouts would be of limited value unless we could react instantly . 
Consequently , Post recommends that preparations begin for a [MISC U.S.-led  ] operation that could act on intelligence quickly . 
Post also recommends identifying [LOC U.S.  ] units that would take the lead in any rescue operation so we can begin familiarizing them with the area of operations . 
We should revise the rules of engagement for those [LOC U.S.  ] forces specifically involved in hostage rescue so they can act effectively if actionable intelligence is collected .
