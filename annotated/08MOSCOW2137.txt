( C ) In a July 14 meeting with the Ambassador and in a July 17 briefing for Special Envoy Gray and [ORG Eurasian Energy Coordinator Mann  ] , [ORG TNK-BP  ] CEO [PER Robert Dudley  ] told us he did not see any positive resolution emerging soon and warned that [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's operations are already effected . 
[ORG AAR  ] continues to ratchet up the pressure on [PER Dudley  ] and [ORG BP  ] in the battle for control of [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
[PER Dudley  ] has been named in a discrimination suit by some of the company 's [MISC Russian  ] employees and on July 23rd a [LOC Tyumen  ] court ruled in favor of a minority shareholder who had sought to prevent continued employment of [ORG BP  ] staff seconded to [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] has now decided to withdraw all of its 148 seconded employees from [ORG TNK-BP  ] and [PER Dudley  ] told us they are unlikely to ever return . 
[PER Dudley  ] and the [MISC Western  ] managers within [ORG TNK-BP  ] remain for now but their situation is tenuous , symbolized by [PER Dudley  ] 's ten day visa extension , which he expects to be renewed for another ten days at the end of this week . 
[PER Dudley  ] compared the situation faced by his company to the nationalization of oil industry in [LOC Venezuela  ] and implicated senior [ORG GOR  ] officials as being involved . 
Other sources have told us that a power struggle within [ORG BP  ] involving [PER Dudley  ] and [ORG BP  ] CEO [PER Hayward  ] is hampering [ORG BP  ] 's ability to respond . 
End summary. --------------------- [ORG AAR  ] TURNS UP THE HEAT --------------------- 2 . 
( C ) On July 23 a [LOC Tyumen  ] court ruled in favor of [PER Tetlis  ] , a minority shareholder of [ORG TNK-BP  ] that had sought to block continued employment of 148 [ORG BP  ] staff who had been seconded to [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
Although [ORG BP  ] has said it will appeal the decision , it had announced a day earlier that the remaining staff ( those who had not already been reassigned out of [LOC Russia  ] ) will leave [LOC Russia  ] due to the continued injunction against their employment . 
[ORG TNK-BP  ] President [PER Bob Dudley  ] had briefed us on this case earlier ( reftel ) , noting [PER Tetlis  ] is linked to [ORG Alfa  ] , one of the partners in the [MISC Russian  ] group of [ORG TNK-BP  ] owners known as [ORG AAR  ] . 
3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Dudley  ] , this case is part of the continued campaign of administrative and [LOC PR  ] pressure against [ORG BP  ] and the foreign staff of [ORG TNK-BP  ] coordinated by [ORG AAR  ] . 
He told the Ambassador on July 14 that the [ORG BP  ] secondees are unlikely to return to [ORG TNK-BP  ] , saying " that chapter is over . 
" [ORG BP Russia  ] President [PER Richard Spies  ] told us the company simply could not have that much talent idle when their services could be put to use elsewhere in the world . 
4 . 
( C ) In all , as of July 24 , according to [ORG TNK-BP  ] Vice President for [ORG International Affairs Shawn McCormick  ] , 363 expat [ORG BP  ] staff and family members have left or will be leaving [LOC Russia  ] , including 196 [MISC American  ] and 117 [MISC British  ] citizens . 
[PER McCormick  ] said there are now about 85 non-Russian staff at [ORG TNK-BP  ] of whom only 62 have work permits and visas ( some are double-counted due the need for multiple work permits ) . 
[PER McCormick  ] said the future of the remaining staff is unclear as there is an internal dispute within [ORG AAR  ] as to the appropriate number of expats in the company of 66,000 employees . 
5 . 
( C ) Included among those with an uncertain future is [PER Dudley  ] , who was given a 10 day " transit " visa on July 18 . 
[PER Dudley  ] was told he can work on the visa , avoiding a potential showdown with [ORG AAR  ] partners who had threatened to try to physically prevent him from entering [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's offices . 
The visa expires at the end of this week , but [PER Dudley  ] told us he expects to get a series of ten days visas as the [ORG Federal Migration Service  ] ( FMS ) tries to avoid making a decision that would lead to his being expelled from the company. ---------------------------------------- GETTING RID OF [PER DUDLEY  ] REMAINS AAR'S GOAL ---------------------------------------- [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002137 002 OF 003 6 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] , who was also recently slapped with a discrimination suit by some of his [MISC Russian  ] employees , told the Ambassador that [ORG AAR  ] 's main priority remains to get rid of him as the company 's CEO , allowing them to effectively take control . 
He explained that while [ORG BP  ] has the right to nominate candidates for the top job , [ORG AAR  ] would still have to agree to the choice . 
With [PER Dudley  ] gone , [ORG AAR  ] could stall on the next president indefinitely , removing the major check against [ORG AAR  ] 's ability to rewrite the procurement , trading , and strategic policies of the company to suit their needs . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] said he believes ( although he admitted " some people disagree " ) that [ORG AAR  ] is acting with direct cooperation from the [ORG GOR  ] , including from Deputy Prime Minister [PER Igor Sechin  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx . 
He said he expected the situation to continue to worsen with more attacks directed at him personally and shared with us an outline ( emailed to desk ) of information he has received regarding a " black [LOC PR  ] " campaign by [ORG AAR  ] designed to put further pressure on him and on [ORG BP  ] . 
8 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] said [ORG AAR  ] partner [PER Viktor Vekselberg  ] is the only shareholder with whom he has a civil relationship . 
He claimed [PER Vekselberg  ] had told him privately that he did not support his partners attacks on [PER Dudley  ] and [ORG BP  ] but that he was bound by [ORG AAR  ] 's shareholder agreement to vote with them . 
[PER Dudley  ] said he has been trading accusatory legal letters back-and-forth with [ORG Alfa  ] 's [MISC German  ] [PER Khan  ] , who has led the charge against [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's foreign executives , and that [ORG Alfa  ] 's [PER Mikhail Fridman  ] had threatened to hold him personally liable for spending over $4 billion " without shareholder approval . 
" [PER Fridman  ] backed off when [PER Dudley  ] offered to freeze capital spending at the company . 
In addition to [PER Sechin  ] and Prikhodko , [PER Dudley  ] believes [PER Medvedev  ] 's economic advisor [PER Arkady Dvorkovich  ] is also supportive of [ORG AAR  ] 's actions . 
9 . 
( C ) Fearing that he may not have been able to return to [LOC Russia  ] if he left , [PER Dudley  ] said he participated in the July 11 shareholders meeting in [LOC Cypress  ] by [ORG DVC  ] . 
He said the meeting underscored the division between [ORG BP  ] and [ORG AAR  ] , with [ORG AAR  ] voting against a [ORG BP  ] resolution that merely called for the board to support " the substance of the shareholder agreement " ( that created the company ) . 
He said [PER Vekselberg  ] expressed support for [PER Dudley  ] during the [ORG DVC  ] , but again voted with [ORG AAR  ] because [ORG AAR  ] 's internal agreement requires him to do so . 
10 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] compared the situation faced by his company to the nationalization of the oil industry in [LOC Venezuela  ] , and said he wasn't hopeful the situation would be resolved soon . 
He believes both [ORG BP  ] and [ORG AAR  ] will lose , with the [ORG GOR  ] ultimately taking control of [ORG TNK-BP  ] through either acquisition by [ORG Gazprom  ] , [ORG Rosneft  ] , or a rumored merger of [ORG TNK-BP  ] with [ORG Gazpromneft  ] and [ORG Surgutneftegaz.  ] ------------------ [ORG BP POWER STRUGGLE  ] ? ------------------ 11 . 
( C ) In a July 21 meeting , [LOC Kremlin  ] critic and former Deputy Energy Minister [PER Vladimir Milov  ] told Ambassadors [PER Gray  ] and Mann that his understanding was that there was also a power struggle going on within [ORG BP  ] between [PER Dudley  ] on the one hand and CEO [PER Tony Hayward  ] on the other . 
[PER Milov  ] said [PER Dudley  ] had also been considered as a replacement for former CEO [PER Lord Brown  ] and that [PER Hayward  ] was being blamed by some in the company for the crisis for having tried to de-emphasize the importance of [ORG BP  ] 's [MISC Russian  ] operations . 
[MISC British  ] Ambassador [PER Anthony Brenton  ] told the Charge July 23 that he had heard similar reports of [ORG BP  ] in-fighting and that this was hampering [ORG BP  ] 's response to [ORG AAR  ] 's attacks. ------- COMMENT ------- 12 . 
( C ) The central role being played in this affair by the [ORG Federal Migration Service  ] undermines [ORG GOR  ] claims that it is not involved and lends further fuel to rumors that senior [ORG GOR  ] officials are backing [ORG AAR  ] . 
That said , it is also not clear [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002137 003 OF 003 whether the [ORG GOR  ] has a unified position on how it wants to see the dispute resolved . 
Until then , it will likely remain impervious to our arguments that its reputation is suffering from the dispute .
