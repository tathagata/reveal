( [ORG SBU  ] ) Federal Deputy [PER Delfim Netto  ] predicted President [PER Lula  ] will win a " fairly close " election in the second round if he can avoid committing too many more gaffes . 
[PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) , however , will take a serious hit because of corruption scandals and will end up with fewer than 50 Federal Deputies . 
However , the centrist [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  ] ( [ORG PMDB  ] ) , of which [PER Netto  ] is a recent member , will hold a bloc of about 80 seats and will ally with [PER Lula  ] 's administration to get jobs and other favors . 
[PER Lula  ] will be able to patch together enough support from smaller parties to get legislation passed . 
In fact , [PER Netto  ] said , [PER Lula  ] was perhaps the only one who could push critical legislation like social security reform and labor reform through the [ORG Congress  ] . 
Leftist forces would accept such reforms if sponsored by [PER Lula  ] , but would oppose and ultimately defeat them if PSDB candidate [PER Geraldo Alckmin  ] won the presidency and tried to pursue such reforms . 
For this reason , [PER Netto  ] himself plans to vote for [PER Lula  ] . 
In a second administration , [PER Netto  ] predicted , [PER Lula  ] will continue his macro-economic orthodoxy but with more flexibility , leaving in place [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] while appointing other officials who will likely push down interest rates and promote pro-growth policies . 
In [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state , [PER Netto  ] predicted that former Mayor [PER Jose Serra  ] will win the governorship in the first round , though scenarios could yet arise that might undermine his chances . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- - [PER LULA  ] EXPECTED TO WIN A " FAIRLY CLOSE " ELECTION --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a recent meeting with [ORG Poloff and Political Assistant  ] , [PER Antonio Delfim Netto  ] ( reftel ) , an elder statesman of [LOC Brazil  ] 's political class , shared his predictions for the electoral campaign . 
[PER Netto  ] expects that opposition candidate [PER Geraldo Alckmin  ] will narrow the gap separating him from President [PER Lula  ] and force the election into a second round . 
[PER Lula  ] is probably at his ceiling right now , whereas [PER Alckmin  ] has plenty of room to grow . 
Third-party candidate [PER Heloisa Helena  ] will also rise above her current 10 percent , [PER Netto  ] predicted , because her brand of radical socialism mixed with Christianity appeals to many voters on the fringes . 
However , faced with the prospect of an [PER Alckmin  ] victory , many such voters will opt for [PER Lula  ] in the second round , and he should win a narrow victory . 
[PER Lula  ] 's greatest challenge between now and the election , in [PER Netto  ] 's view , will be to avoid saying things that may alienate voters ( e.g. , recent gaffe of his was interpreted by many as denigrating the intelligence of the elderly ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Netto  ] noted that in 2002 , [PER Lula  ] had carried his [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) to power , not the other way around . 
The 2002 elections represented a vote against [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] 's ( [ORG FHC  ] ) [ORG Social Democracy Party of Brazil  ] ( PSDB ) due to the economic problems he bequeathed . 
In issuing his " Letter to the [MISC Brazilian  ] People , " pledging responsibility in economic management , [PER Lula  ] broke with many [ORG PT  ] economists and has never paid much attention to them since . 
He has managed to retain his own popularity even while his party has been seriously damaged by the political corruption scandals . 
The [ORG PT  ] may win as few as 45 seats in elections for the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , [PER Netto  ] predicted. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the race for [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor , [PER Netto  ] thought former Mayor [PER Jose Serra  ] was on track for a first-round victory . 
This could [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000907 002 OF 003 change , however , if [ORG PMDB  ] candidate [PER Orestes Quercia  ] overtakes [ORG PT  ] Senator [PER Aloysio Mercadante  ] . 
( NOTE: The most recent polls showed [PER Serra  ] with 49 percent , [PER Mercadante  ] with 17 percent , and [PER Quercia  ] with 10 percent . 
END NOTE . 
) In that case , the well-organized [ORG PMDB  ] could arouse the enthusiasm of its base and run an aggressive campaign against [PER Serra  ] , focusing on his somewhat controversial record , and forcing him into a second round. ------------------------ A SECOND [PER LULA  ] GOVERNMENT ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Netto  ] believes , as do many political observers , that many of [PER Lula  ] 's social programs were designed to garner votes . 
But he also said that [PER Lula  ] has genuine empathy for the poor and , if re-elected , will devote his energies to trying to create more jobs . 
He is also likely , in [PER Netto  ] 's opinion , to keep on [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] and to continue his orthodox macro-economic policies , but will exercise more flexibility and will appoint other officials more open to lowering interest rates . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Netto  ] was somewhat cynical about the [ORG Congressional  ] elections , noting that many deputies implicated in the " mensalao " scandal were running for re-elections and predicting that " the ones who stole will be re-elected . 
" He noted that with the entry into force of the " [PER Barrier Clause  ] , " some four to six parties will disappear after failing to get five percent of the vote . 
But many of the members of these dying parties will join the government coalition , as will the [ORG PMDB  ] , which will again elect around 80 deputies. ------------------- THE NEED FOR REFORM ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For the duration of the campaign , [PER Netto  ] predicted , neither [PER Lula  ] nor [PER Alckmin  ] will make much in the way of concrete proposals on what programs they would undertake . 
Doing so would gain them no voters and would likely cost them some . 
Rather , they will campaign on generalities and platitudes , and will also expend some energy trying to " deconstruct " one another . 
But whoever is in office in January will face certain hard realities , [PER Netto  ] pointed out . 
A [ORG Social Security  ] reform is urgently needed ; without it , he said , [LOC Brazil  ] will soon face a fiscal crisis . 
Labor reform is also critical . 
However , [PER Netto  ] believed it would be difficult for a President [PER Alckmin  ] to push such reforms through [ORG Congress  ] , since the [ORG PT  ] and other leftist parties would vociferously oppose them . 
However , if President [PER Lula  ] , coming off re-election , were to put them forward , he could likely win leftist support ( or , if not support , acquiescence ) for the measures , and even the opposition PSDB and [ORG Liberal Front Party  ] ( [ORG PFL  ] ) would have to vote for some of the reforms on their merits . 
For this reason , [PER Netto  ] said he himself will vote for [PER Lula  ] , because he believes [PER Lula  ] is in a better position to have a successful government. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Netto  ] 's stated reason for preferring [PER Lula  ] over [PER Alckmin  ] is novel and interesting ( and likely self-serving ) , but begs the question of whether a re-elected President [PER Lula  ] would in fact decide to take on social security and labor reform , and other much-needed initiatives . 
For many observers , [PER Lula  ] 's first term has lacked focus and vision , which does not augur well for a serious reform agenda in the second term , since such an agenda would require [PER Lula  ] 's direct and sustained attention and involvement in order to get it through [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000907 003 OF 003 an inherently fractious [ORG Congress  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .
