MADRID 129 Classified By: CdA [PER Arnold A. Chacon  ] , for Reason 1.4 ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary and Action Requests: New Culture Minister [PER Gonzalez-Sinde  ] , a committed opponent of internet piracy , updated the Charge on the status of negotiations between content providers and [MISC ISPs  ] . 
She welcomed a shift in approach by content providers that would have the [ORG GOS  ] seek legal changes allowing it to block offending web pages . 
After several months , participants would review the results to see whether other action ( e.g. , action against individual users ) , was needed . 
The Minister reacted enthusiastically to our offer of expert engagement , saying it would be valuable for [ORG GOS  ] officials to hear what has worked and what has not worked to reduce illicit downloads . 
Post requests that [LOC Washington  ] agencies seek to provide experts to discuss this issue with [ORG GOS  ] officials in visits or through video conferences . 
Post also requests that [LOC Washington  ] agencies respond favorably to the Minister 's interest in involving [LOC U.S.  ] experts in IPR-related events during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency next year . 
End Summary and Action Requests . 
2 . 
( C ) [PER Angeles Gonzalez-Sinde  ] , named Culture Minister in the April 7 cabinet shuffle , emphasized to the Charge during a June 18 courtesy call the importance she placed on addressing internet piracy . 
She said it would be ideal if content providers and [MISC ISPs  ] could reach agreements on measures to fight piracy as had happened in the [LOC U.S.  ] , but that the [MISC ISPs  ] , led by [ORG Telefonica  ] , did not seem to want to do so . 
She said that since talks between the [ORG Coalition of  ] content providers and the [MISC Redtel  ] ISP association had broken off in April , the [ORG Coalition  ] had shown much more flexibility than [MISC Redtel  ] . 
It now was willing to start by targeting offending websites rather than individual users . 
She said it would be necessary to change laws so the [ORG GOS  ] could act against sites , adding that 100 sites accounted for a significant majority of illicit downloads . 
In some months , participants could review whether this approach had worked and see whether other action was needed . 
( [ORG Note: The Coalition  ] announced a proposal along these lines the next day . 
It called for a one-year period with no action against individual users and called for measures against 200 sites accounting for 80% of illicit downloads . 
The [ORG Coalition  ] also announced the creation of a site that would involve [MISC ISPs  ] in offering movies , music , and video games at an accessible price . 
The [MISC ISPs  ] have not yet responded . 
) 3 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The Minister expressed interest in our offer ( ref A ) of cooperation from [ORG USG  ] experts . 
She was particularly interested in advice on measures to reduce demand for unauthorized downloads -- what had worked and what had not . 
The Minister also expressed interest in involving [LOC U.S.  ] experts in IPR-related events during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency in the first half of 2010 . 
4 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The Minister hopes to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] in September . 
Post believes it would be useful for [ORG USG  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] IPR industry officials to meet with her . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Gonzalez-Sinde  ] 's appointment as Minister prompted vocal criticism from the " [MISC Internautas  ] " pro-piracy association that she faced a conflict of interest because as head of the [MISC Spanish  ] film academy she had spoken out strongly against internet piracy ( ref B ) . 
While she emphasized that the [MISC Internautas  ] were a small and unrepresentative group , she also acknowledged the importance of fighting any perception that she was only interested in piracy for personal reasons , and she has taken a relatively low public profile on the issue in her first months . 
Nonetheless , she is actively engaged in the fight against piracy , meeting with a range of key players to seek a way forward . 
While one of her key points -- the need for viable models of legal content distribution -- is a frequent [MISC Redtel  ] refrain , she is much more focused on the need for constructive action . 
It is in our interest to support her efforts , and post recommends that we do so through arranging visits , meetings , and/or video conferences with experts in the coming months . 
Her receptivity also gives us an opportunity during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency to influence developments beyond [LOC Spain  ] .
