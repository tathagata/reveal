End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) A state judge issued warrants for the arrests of three individuals for the murder of [PER Dorothy Stang  ] . 
( [MISC Brazilian  ] federal authorities are looking into the possibility of re-indicting using criminal statutes that would transfer jurisdiction to the federal authorities . 
) Two of the suspects were identified only as " [MISC Raifran  ] " and " [PER Eduardo  ] , " the alleged gunmen . 
The third person is rancher [PER Vitalmiro Bastos  ] de [PER Moura  ] , alias " [LOC Bida  ] , " accused of ordering the hit . 
Press stories have accused a fourth individual , rancher [PER Amair Feijoli  ] da [PER Cunha  ] , alias " [PER Tato  ] , " as being the go-between for [PER Bastos  ] de [PER Moura  ] and the gunmen . 
All four are at large and presumed to be hiding in the jungle. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In a meeting with the Ambassador , [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] UnderSecretary [PER Ruy Nunes Pinot Nogueira  ] pledged that the government would make the " utmost effort " to capture and prosecute the murderers . 
He said he was encouraged by the reaction to the murder throughout [LOC Brazil  ] and noted that [PER Stang  ] was a [MISC Brazilian  ] , as well as [LOC U.S.  ] , citizen . 
The Ambassador stressed the [ORG USG  ] 's strong interest in the case. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Violence in [LOC Para  ] continued , with the shooting death of [ORG Soares da  ] [PER Costa Filho  ] , the leader of a temporary camp of landless peasants near the town of [LOC Parauapebas  ] in southern [LOC Para  ] , on February 15 . 
No arrests have been made . 
Authorities do not know whether [PER Costa Filho  ] was killed in a dispute within the landless movement or by large landowners . 
Counting the February 12 murders in the town of [LOC Anapu  ] of [PER Stang  ] and [PER Adalberto Xavier Leal  ] ( separate events ) , [PER Costa Filho  ] is the third murder linked to agrarian reform in [LOC Para  ] this week . 
It is not clear that the three killings are directly related or more broadly reflect the recent tensions in the state. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Stang  ] 's murder continues to receive a great deal of government and press attention in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Following an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday night , the government ordered 2,000 troops into the area around [LOC Anapu  ] , [LOC Para  ] . 
According to press , the troops mandate is to keep the two sides involved in the land dispute apart , to disarm the two sides , and to assist police in the manhunt for [PER Stang  ] 's killers . 
An official with the federal [ORG Ministry of Agrarian Development  ] said [ORG Army  ] and [ORG Federal Police  ] forces were being deployed to the area to guarantee the security of the landless families being settled there . 
An initial contingent of 140 soldiers arrived in [LOC Anapu  ] on February 16. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) High-level GoB officials are engaged on the issue . 
Vice President [PER Jose Alencar  ] , [PER Lula  ] 's Chief of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] , and seven other cabinet ministers met with the Governor of [LOC Para  ] , [PER Simao Jatene  ] , on February 15 . 
[PER Dirceu  ] later told the press , " The nation can be certain that there will be no impunity , neither for the higher-ups nor the gunmen . 
It 's time for us to say 'enough' to these activities . 
" [PER Dirceu  ] announced that the GoB would speed up its land reform and environmental projects in the area . 
Environment Minister [PER Marina Silva  ] , herself a veteran of the [ORG Amazon  ] 's environmental wars , declared , " Some people don't want to behave legally . 
They can either get legal or go to jail . 
" Subsequently , the government announced the establishment of a four million hectare environmental protection area near [LOC Anapu  ] and said that it would appropriate all of the lands ( 54,000 hectares ) near the town of [LOC Anapu  ] that generated the conflicts leading to the [PER Stang  ] and [PER Leal  ] murders and redistribute them to landless families. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Separately , [LOC Para  ] Governor [PER Jatene  ] announced that he would accelerate the state 's existing land use plans to clearly demarcate protected forest from land available for development . 
[PER Jatene  ] admitted to the press that the remote region is difficult to police , adding that he has deployed 100 additional state police there in recent days. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Much of the land in question is tied up in court because of complaints by local residents and officials that the landowners used it as collateral for government loans on the condition that they retain it as virgin forest , but after the loans were issued , the lands were clear cut for timber and cattle grazing . 
It is the slowness of the federal government and the courts in seizing and redistributing these lands , and the perception that local judges have unduly favored the landowners , that sparked the recent round of tensions . 
Sister [PER Dorothy Stang  ] was working with the peasants in the area to create sustainable development projects. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) The [ORG Army  ] will establish a series of temporary bases ( with no fixed end-date ) to support inspections of improper land use , deforestation , and slave labor . 
The [ORG Army  ] is working with GoB land reform and environmental agencies to identify the best locations for the bases . 
[ORG Army  ] command has announced the troops will receive overhead support from the [ORG Air Force  ] and will be commanded by General [PER Jairo Cesar Nass  ] , based in [LOC Altamira  ] , [LOC Para  ] . 
Forces will be drawn from units based in [LOC Manaus  ] , [LOC Belem  ] , and [LOC Maraba  ] ( [LOC Para  ] ) . 
State police forces have announced that they hope to take advantage of the [ORG Army  ] 's presence to execute several existing arrest warrants that they have not been able to carry out because of the high tensions in the area. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Washington  ] , [ORG D.C. United States Attorneys Office  ] 's [ORG Transnational Crime Unit  ] has reviewed the preliminary facts of the case and is interested in pursuing a [LOC U.S.  ] indictment and possible prosecution in [PER Stang  ] 's murder . 
( [ORG DOJ  ] does understand that the individuals allegedly responsible for the murders are [MISC Brazilian  ] and cannot be extradited from [LOC Brazil  ] due [MISC Brazilian  ] constitutional prohibitions . 
) The [ORG FBI  ] 's [ORG Extraterritorial Squad  ] ( based in [LOC Miami  ] ) is planning to send two agents to [LOC Brazil  ] to assist with the [LOC U.S.  ] investigation , with the anticipated arrival date sometime the week of February 21 , pending LEGATT consultations with [MISC Brazilian  ] law enforcement authorities . 
Due to the political nature and extensive media on this case , the [ORG FBI  ] will maintain an extremely low profile . 
The [ORG Transnational Crime Unit  ] concluded that the murder was a clear violation of [ORG Title  ] 18 , [ORG USC  ] 2332 - International Homicide of a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Citizen  ] . 
One of the key elements of this criminal statute requires that the offense was intended to " coerce , or retaliate against a government or a civilian population . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Stang  ] 's murder is forcing the federal government to confront [LOC Para  ] 's lawlessness and environmental degradation , a subject it has long opined on , but taken little action . 
By any standard , the government reaction so far has been strong: federal police have invested significant resources and the insertion of federal troops is a significant act . 
[PER Stang  ] and other activists had long sought the redistribution of land to the landless and environmental protection areas . 
The government had previously supported the concepts , but lacked the political will to take action . 
[PER Stang  ] 's murder changed that . 
Nevertheless , [LOC Para  ] is a huge region ( larger than the states of [LOC Texas  ] , [LOC Oklahoma  ] , and [LOC New Mexico  ] combined ) with little infrastructure and much jungle . 
Illegal ranchers and loggers are well established there and have powerful political allies . 
Finding the [PER Stang  ] 's killers will be a difficult task , dealing with the decades-old land issues even more complex . 
We will continue to monitor the investigation , and the overall situation , closely .
