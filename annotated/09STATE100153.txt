( U ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph 3 for action. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) BACKGROUND: The [LOC United States  ] is aware that [LOC Iran  ] has been secretly building another enrichment facility , in addition to the one at [LOC Natanz  ] . 
Some other governments are also in possession of similar information . 
The [LOC United States  ] , [LOC France  ] , and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] briefed the [ORG IAEA  ] on Thursday , 24 September on this facility . 
The [LOC United States  ] remains committed to a diplomatic resolution of international concerns with [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
These concerns are reinforced by the existence of this facility . 
Immediate , unconditional cooperation by [LOC Iran  ] with the [ORG IAEA  ] is essential to address these concerns and to ensure that a diplomatic process has a chance to succeed. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) ACTION REQUEST: Posts are requested to inform senior host government officials of the existence of a covert uranium enrichment facility in [LOC Iran  ] using the points contained in paragraph 4 . 
Posts are NOT authorized to provide a copy of the points . 
[LOC Washington  ] understands that , in a previous iteration of this message , a non-paper was authorized . 
If points have already been conveyed in writing , posts are instructed to request discretion on the part of host government interlocutors . 
If asked about coincidental claims by an [MISC Iranian  ] exile group of previously unknown nuclear weaponization sites , posts should convey the following , IC-cleared point: -- We do not believe that these other sites that you refer to are the [LOC Qom  ] enrichment site . 
There are many suspect sites , including these others , that we monitor. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: -- We have acquired substantial , specific information that [LOC Iran  ] has been secretly building another enrichment facility ? in addition to [LOC Natanz  ] . 
-- The facility is located near the city of [LOC Qom  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and has been under construction for several years . 
The facility is located in an underground tunnel complex on the grounds of an [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Base  ] . 
-- Earlier this year , we developed information that gave us increased confidence that the facility was a uranium enrichment site . 
-- The site is under the management of the [ORG Atomic Energy Organization of Iran  ] , but unknown to all but the most senior [ORG AEOI  ] officials . 
-- The site is intended to hold approximately 3000 centrifuges but we do not know what type of centrifuge [LOC Iran  ] intends to employ there . 
We assess an enrichment plant containing 3000 centrifuges is not adequate to produce regular fuel reloads for civilian nuclear power plants , which require a much larger number of centrifuges . 
-- Based on our understanding of the status of the facility , we assess that [LOC Iran  ] will not be able to begin enriching uranium there before at least 2010 . 
[LOC Iran  ] is continuing construction of support buildings at the facility . 
Intelligence indicates that earlier this year , [LOC Iran  ] was installing the infrastructure required for centrifuges . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] may claim that this facility is for civilian nuclear fuel production . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] government continues to claim that it is not pursuing a nuclear weapon . 
Yet this facility is too small to be viable for production of fuel for a nuclear power reactor . 
It may be well-suited , however , for a military purpose . 
-- We are aware that some other governments are in possession of similar information . 
-- We learned this week that [LOC Iran  ] has sent the [ORG IAEA  ] a letter indicating that it is constructing a pilot fuel enrichment facility and that the " required infrastructure has been established . 
" -- The letter provides no details and states that STATE 00100153 002 OF 002 " further complementary information will be provided in an appropriate and due time . 
" We assume this new enrichment facility is the facility that we and other governments have been tracking . 
-- We , the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] have briefed the [ORG IAEA  ] on the information that they have so that they can fully investigate the facility . 
The President , with his [LOC UK  ] and [MISC French  ] counterparts , plans to make an announcement Friday morning in [LOC Pittsburgh  ] . 
-- We firmly believe that the existence of a new centrifuge facility in [LOC Iran  ] constitutes a serious violation of [LOC Iran  ] 's international obligations . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] was required to suspend all uranium enrichment- related activities in [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution <a id='par1737' href='#par1737'>¶</a>1737 . 
This legally-binding requirement has been reaffirmed in three subsequent [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions . 
-- When [LOC Iran  ] decided to build this facility , it was obligated to declare this to the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
It failed to do so . 
-- What is clear is that [LOC Iran  ] once again has engaged in a deceit of the international community . 
The President made clear that we are serious about using diplomacy to find a negotiated solution to the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , but in order to do so , [LOC Iran  ] needs to be transparent and truthful . 
-- It is now time for [LOC Iran  ] to prove to the international community that it is willing to play by the rules . 
We urge your public support on this matter as we head into the October 1 meeting with [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- It will particularly important that [LOC Iran  ] understand that it must end the pattern of deception and once and for all commit itself to full transparency . 
It is time for [LOC Iran  ] to come clean on the questions about its weaponization studies and to implement the Additional Protocol . 
-- The Ministers of the [ORG P5+1  ] held a productive meeting on the margins of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
They stated their expectation that [LOC Iran  ] will be prepared to take constructive steps when it meets with the [ORG P5+1  ] on October 1st . 
In light of this new and troubling information , the burden is clearly on [LOC Iran  ] to prove the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program . 
It is essential that [LOC Iran  ] accept that the process in [LOC Geneva  ] must be real an address their nuclear program . 
We are prepared to engage in a real process but will not be a party to a phony one . 
-- We hope that we can count on your public support for holding [LOC Iran  ] to its international obligations .
