REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Websites al-Manara and [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm reported on March 28 and 29 , respectively , that a " senior security official " of the [ORG Internal Security Organization  ] ( [ORG ISO  ] ) was assassinated on March 27 in the eastern [MISC Libyan  ] city of [LOC Derna  ] . 
The sites identified the officer as [PER Ennaji 'Awami  ] , and said he died after being shot twice in the head by masked gunmen in front of the al-Qods School . 
According to website reports , the slain officer 's vehicle was subsequently found parked in the al-Qala' area of [LOC Derna  ] 's [PER Baab Shiha  ] neighborhood . 
( Note: al-Qala' - " fortress " or " castle " - is a reference to the historic fort located in that area of town . 
End note . 
) According to website reports , security officials mounted a campaign of arrests immediately after 'Awami was killed , but failed to apprehend the perpetrators . 
They noted that 'Awami was well-known for his " severity and cruelty " and had received multiple death threats before he was killed . 
2 . 
( C ) [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC British  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] diplomats told [PER Emboffs April  ] 5-7 that their missions confirmed that the killing had occurred . 
( Note: [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] have consulates in [LOC Benghazi  ] , the closest major city to [LOC Derna  ] . 
End note . 
) [MISC Egyptian  ] PolCouns [PER Ahmed Abdel Halim  ] told P/E Chief on April 7 that the [MISC Egyptian  ] Consulate in [LOC Benghazi  ] confirmed reports that 'Awami was the victim and that he had been killed by gunfire . 
Their information was that he was shot in front of a [LOC Derna  ] school while waiting to pick up his children . 
It was not/not clear to [MISC Egyptian  ] officials whether the assassination was an act of terrorism perpetrated by [MISC Islamic  ] extremists or a revenge killing , although [MISC Egyptian  ] contacts in [LOC Derna  ] took pains to characterize 'Awami as " a hard man " and " a bully " . 
Noting the above-referenced web reports , [PER Abdel Halim  ] stressed that targeting security officials - a phenomenon with which [LOC Egypt  ] has some experience - was " extremely rare " in [LOC Libya  ] . 
If confirmed as a targeted killing perpetrated by [MISC Islamic  ] extremists , it would represent a " very significant " development , he said . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment: Post  ] notes that the information above is consistent with some information reported reftel on April 6.The al-Manara and [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm websites feature significant reporting on events in eastern [LOC Libya  ] . 
That al-Manara , a [MISC London-based  ] site established in 2002 , posted its report within a day of the shooting suggests close , well-established contact between eastern [LOC Libya  ] and members of the [MISC Libyan  ] diaspora in the [LOC U.K.  ] End comment .
