( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] and President [PER Lobo  ] met for 90 minutes on February 14 at the [ORG Residence  ] . 
While the two discussed a myriad of issues of interest to the bilateral relation ( septel ) , the [ORG Ambassador  ] took the opportunity to stress our growing concern of the continued presence and participation in [PER Lobo  ] 's government of the regime Minister of [ORG Defense Lionel Sevilla  ] and Chief of [ORG Defense Romeo Vasquez Velasquez  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] appreciated the commitments that [PER Lobo  ] had made to appoint new leadership in the political-military hierarchy , an issue that they had discussed on two previous occasions ( on January 23 and 29 ) . 
Nevertheless , the [ORG Ambassador  ] said the clock was ticking and that there was no indication of any imminent decision to make the needed personnel changes . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] stressed that many in the international community , including in [LOC Washington  ] , were looking for [PER Lobo  ] to demonstrate his leadership and commitment to restore [LOC Honduras  ] fully on the path of democracy . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] added that a key element was to make clear strong civilian control of the military . 
The presence of two key members of the [MISC Micheletti  ] regime , and their links to the coup , made this a troubling situation in the minds of many inside and outside [LOC Honduras.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [PER Lobo  ] responded that he remained committed to asserting control of the military . 
He noted that the military was under great strain and that confusion and uncertainty reigned due to the officers' isolation and the fallout from the June 28 coup . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he believed that the military had been manipulated by both [LOC Zelaya  ] and his opponents on the political right . 
He wanted to be fair to the military and help it regain its balance . 
He also expressed concern that the situation in [LOC Honduras  ] remained unstable and that potentially he would need the military to help him maintain order in the event that extremists launched a wave of protests . 
He said he feared that if he acted precipitously , the military might turn against him. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] agreed that the military had to be treated fairly ; but also it was important for him as the Commanding General to be firm and decisive . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] expressed confidence that the military would follow his strong leadership and direction . 
The appointment of new leadership would allow the [MISC Honduran  ] military to begin the process of looking to the future and turning the page . 
He urged the President to appoint a new civilian minister who would be loyal to him and have no ties to the regime . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] also said it was also critically important for General [PER Vasquez  ] to step down . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] made clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not in a position to reengage with the [MISC Honduran  ] military and restore military assistance until new leadership was in place. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Lobo  ] appreciated the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's straight forward and honest advice . 
He admitted that [PER Vasquez  ] was angling to stay on , or be appointed as Minister of [ORG Defense  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] made clear that he would ensure that [PER Vasquez  ] would step down , but wanted to do it carefully . 
He said he was under pressure from some within the officer corps to appoint Army Chief General [PER Garcia Padgett  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said that the two individuals most closely connected to the military side of the coup were [PER Vasquez  ] and [PER Garcia Padgett  ] . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] discouraged [PER Lobo  ] from appointing [PER Garcia Padgett  ] . 
He suggested that [PER Lobo  ] consider appointing General [PER Doblado  ] , a scrupulous and highly respected officer . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] said [PER Garcia Padgett  ] was a relatively young general and a strong institutional argument could be made in favor of someone like [PER Doblado  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he planned to meet with the 120 member senior officer corps on February 16 and make the case for the need to change the leadership . 
He said he would do the right thing with regards to the military and would show the [LOC U.S.  ] and the world that he was in control , but said he would not be hasty in making the decision . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] suggested that [PER Lobo  ] act sooner rather than later since the international community had not yet voiced this concern publicly . 
If he waited the international public criticism would not be long in coming and he would then be seen as bowing to foreign pressure , which would be worse . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he would take [LOC U.S.  ] views into consideration in making his final decision . 
He said he TEGUCIGALP 00000143 002.2 OF 002 would ultimately do the right thing .
