( C ) Summary: Minister of the [ORG Presidency Juan Ramos  ] de [PER la Quintana  ] told the Ambassador February 15 that the [ORG GOB  ] wanted [ORG USG  ] agencies to continue their programs in the [LOC Chapare  ] , though implementation methods may need to be modified . 
He acknowledged that the [ORG GOB  ] 's counternarcotics policies were still being formulated , but assured that the [ORG GOB  ] 's commitment to combat the illicit drug trade would be met and that the cocalero federations did not speak on the [ORG GOB  ] 's behalf . 
[PER Quintana  ] said the depenalization and industrialization of coca was a priority for President [PER Evo Morales  ] . 
The Minister said cocaleros would be paid to eradicate coca in the national parks while other negotiated alternatives would be pursued with the cocalero federations . 
On interdiction , [PER Quintana  ] asked for greater information sharing from the [ORG DEA  ] on organized criminal networks . 
When the Ambassador raised objections about anti-U.S. rhetoric creeping into [ORG GOB  ] statements , the Minister blamed the [MISC Bolivian  ] press for distorting reality . 
[PER Quintana  ] was forthright , somewhat confused , and suspicious of [ORG USG  ] programs . 
The new [ORG GOB  ] may or may not be disposed ideologically to work with us ; but it certainly does not yet have the internal cohesion or coherence to cooperate effectively . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- --------- FIRST MEETING WITH MINISTER OF THE PRESIDENCY [PER QUINTANA  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At our request , the Ambassador , DCM , and Econ/Pol Chief met the evening of February 15 with Minister of the [ORG Presidency Juan Ramos  ] de la [PER Quintana  ] to seek clarification of [ORG GOB  ] policy regarding [ORG USG  ] programs in the [LOC Chapare  ] . 
Newspaper headlines that morning carried the cocalero federations' decision to throw out [ORG USG  ] agencies operating in the region , a position supported by [ORG GOB  ] spokesman [PER Alex Contreras  ] ( see reftel ) . 
The Ambassador told [PER Quintana  ] that the federations' statements--Evo [PER Morales  ] remains their titular head--and the apparent presidential endorsement had sparked considerable confusion about the [ORG GOB  ] 's intent . 
The Ambassador suggested that if eradication is to be stopped and [ORG USG  ] involvement in the [LOC Chapare  ] ended , the new policy should be communicated officially and we could begin shutting off our multi-million dollar assistance programs now. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Quintana  ] responded that he appreciated open , frank exchanges free of entangling rhetoric and underscored the [ORG GOB  ] 's continuing need for [LOC U.S.  ] help on the counternarcotics front . 
But , he added , that message is not being clearly communicated because " ...we do not yet have an agreement between the [ORG GOB  ] and all the relevant actors on this issue . 
" At the same time , he said the cocalero federations did not speak on behalf of the [ORG GOB  ] , which has a stronger commitment than previous administrations and wants to " ...break the stigma that [LOC Bolivia  ] protects narcotraffickers . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In that vein , [PER Quintana  ] claimed the [ORG GOB  ] had a sound strategy to combat the illegal drug trade: compartmentalizing the problem into " clear chapters " for greater enforcement efficiency on the one hand , and depenalizing coca for industrialization and commercialization on the other . 
" Depenalization is a complex but necessary task because we want coca to have commercial and industrial purposes . 
This is an explicit priority for the President , " he said , adding that the [ORG GOB  ] would meet next week with [ORG EU  ] representatives to discuss the terms of the demand study required for domestic purposes . 
( [PER Note: While  ] not stated , the implication was that the [ORG EU  ] study should include consideration of [MISC Bolivian  ] domestic demand to include coca necessary for these yet-only-imagined industrial purposes . 
End Note ) . --------------------------------------------- - [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00000417 002 OF 003 A NEW APPROACH TO ERADICATION AND INTERDICTION --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Quintana  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] would preserve the best of previous [ORG GOB  ] policies , including eradication , but implement them differently . 
The first priority , he offered , is to limit additional cultivation , although he added curiously that the [ORG GOB  ] would not strictly interpret the 3200 hectare limit for [LOC Chapare  ] cultivation set aside by the October 2004 agreement . 
He assured that eradication would continue in the two problem areas of the [ORG Carrasco National Park  ] and the [LOC Yungas  ] de [LOC Vandiola  ] , saying that he would travel to the region himself this weekend to meet with cocaleros , but noted that existing military eradicators would work only in the areas where they can proceed peacefully , with negotiation--an open-ended concept--the rule in more conflictive zones. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Quintana  ] saw no change in the [ORG GOB  ] 's willingness to cooperate with the [ORG USG  ] on interdiction and noted that the [ORG DEA  ] was welcome to stay in the [LOC Chapare  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] 's non-political approach to interdiction was exemplified , he said , by the non-partisan appointment of a new chief for the counternarcotics police . 
The Minister asserted that these units had committed human rights violations in the past , a situation this [ORG GOB  ] would not tolerate . 
The Ambassador retorted that any such incidents did not involve [ORG DEA  ] agents and that we shared [PER Quintana  ] 's concern about human rights . 
[PER Quintana  ] went on to say that he was not critical of the results obtained by interdiction efforts , but of the methods used to obtain them . 
" In the past , because of the weakness of [MISC Bolivian  ] institutions , [ORG USG  ] involvement appeared more like intervention than cooperation . 
We ask that your cooperation be transparent , conducted with consideration and respect . 
" While expressing a desire to be autonomous in their interdiction operations , he acknowledged the need for the [ORG USG  ] 's offer of helicopters and other equipment " in the spirit of shared responsibility , " and said the [ORG GOB  ] had no plans to alter the [ORG DEA  ] 's role in the drug enforcement arena. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) When the Ambassador asked what immediate changes in the interdiction efforts were contemplated , [PER Quintana  ] observed that the [ORG GOB  ] had little understanding of how criminal organizations operated in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
" All we get , " he complained , " are statistics on drugs intercepted and labs destroyed , but nothing on [MISC Bolivian  ] criminal organizations and their links to other countries . 
This makes us suspicious that the counter-narcotics efforts are not sufficiently explained to the [ORG GOB  ] or the [MISC Bolivian  ] people . 
" He also lamented that the [MISC Bolivian  ] anti-drug unit ( [ORG FELCN  ] ) did not have an institute to study criminal organizations . 
The Ambassador replied that maintaining the integrity of international criminal investigations was crucial but that he would raise the issue with the [LOC DEA.  ] ------------------- INTELLIGENCE ISSUES ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Minister noted that the [ORG GOB  ] wanted its intelligence services to respond better to the needs of the [ORG GOB  ] and was suspicious of their relationship with the [ORG DEA  ] . 
( [PER Note: Quintana  ] associated intelligence cooperation only with the [ORG DEA  ] and the counternarcotics effort . 
End Note . 
) The Minister said that he wanted " a more democratic intelligence service " in the future . 
The Ambassador noted [ORG USG  ] interest in promoting intelligence cooperation on counter-terrorism issues as well , given regional threats in the [LOC Tri-Border  ] region and elsewhere , and suggested a subsequent meeting to discuss these issues in greater depth. ----------------------------------------- MUTUAL DESIRE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT ----------------------------------------- [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00000417 003 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Ambassador expressed concern about anti-U.S. rhetoric creeping into [ORG GOB  ] statements and policies and warned that gratuitous insults did not encourage strong bilateral ties . 
Talking about imaginary [LOC U.S.  ] military bases in [LOC Paraguay  ] " as you have done publicly , Mr. Minister , " does little to build confidence . 
Noting the billions of [LOC U.S.  ] dollars of assistance in the past few decades , including the nearly one million in disaster assistance for [MISC Bolivian  ] flood victims , the Ambassador observed that the [ORG USG  ] would sometimes appreciate a good word or thank you , something President [PER Morales  ] notably forgot to offer in his conversation with President [PER Bush.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) While acknowledging that the [ORG GOB  ] probably had no intention of ratifying an [ORG Article  ] 98 agreement , the Ambassador asked that the [ORG GOB  ] respect the [LOC U.S.  ] position without intentionally mischaracterizing it and claiming that the [LOC U.S.  ] sought to shield its soldiers from justice . 
The issue is one of jurisdiction , not immunity , he said , and noted that over 100 countries had signed [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements with the [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ ATTACKING THE PRESS AND RE-ORIENTING [ORG USG  ] ASSISTANCE --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Quintana  ] , perhaps a little disingenuously , said he shared the Ambassador 's concerns about poisonous rhetoric , but blamed the press for distorting the [ORG GOB  ] 's comments about the [LOC U.S.  ] He described the [MISC Bolivian  ] press as unprofessional and perverse because it was too closely associated with political parties . 
At the same time , [PER Quintana  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was counterproductively omnipresent in [MISC Bolivian  ] institutions--an ironic exageration in view of reportedly increasing [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] presence--and suggested that our assistance was too dispersed to be strategically effective . 
He lamented the uneven economic development throughout the country , noting that [LOC Potosi  ] remained in abject poverty while [PER Santa Cruz  ] was developing fast " with its radical federalist ideas , " and suggested a [LOC U.S.  ] Corps of Engineers road project uniting the country would be a smart , focussed investment . 
The Ambassador reminded [PER Quintana  ] that the [ORG GOB  ] nixed expanded military help by attacking us on [ORG Article  ] 98. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Quintana  ] seemed forthright , a little confused , and abidingly suspicious of [ORG USG  ] intentions . 
He exposed inaccurate views about existing [ORG USG  ] programs , a strong ideological bent on coca , and a disturbing disaffection with the media--particularly disturbing since the [ORG MAS  ] is considering laws to limit freedom of press . 
His most revealing comment was that the [ORG GOB  ] is still struggling to clarify its policies , including on counternarcotics . 
Whether the new [ORG GOB  ] wants to work with us is an open question ; whether it can work with us is equally perplexing . 
End Comment .
