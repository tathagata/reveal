THE HAGUE 1196 Classified By: Ambassador [PER William Wood  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/REL [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG AUS  ] ) Summary: [LOC Chora  ] district center came under [ORG Taliban  ] attack Friday , June 15 , the focal point of a province-wide surge in insurgent activity . 
When it looked as if [LOC Chora  ] might fall , the [MISC Dutch  ] took the politically difficult decision to go on the offensive . 
They mounted successful operations re-establishing [MISC GoA  ] control over [LOC Chora  ] and killing key [ORG Taliban  ] commanders . 
Unfortunately , the fighting also took a toll on the civilian population . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] executed residents and their families in retaliation for their support of the [MISC Afghan  ] government . 
Preliminary investigations indicate that press reports of civilian casualties were exaggerated . 
The PRT is on the ground to address humanitarian needs arising from the fighting and to resume reconstruction . 
No doubt critics of the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] will attempt to use the fight for [LOC Chora  ] as ammunition in this summer 's debate over extension of the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] beyond July 2008 ; but advocates of extension are likely to find that the results better support their cause . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ref A reported a significant surge in insurgent activity in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
While this pattern was observed throughout the province , the fight for the [LOC Chora  ] district center was the center of the storm. ---------- The Threat ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) As of Sunday , June 17 , the situation in [LOC Chora  ] looked bleak . 
Insurgents had overrun three checkpoints to the east of the [LOC Chora  ] . 
[ORG ISAF  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] forces were hunkered down in the district center itself , seemingly surrounded . 
To the west , local tribal commanders defending [PER Sarab  ] village lost a checkpoint on the high ground and had fallen back into the village . 
Worse , insurgents held the ground between the two points , preventing one force from aiding the other . 
Task Force-Uruzgan ( TF- U ) Commander [PER Col. Hans  ] van [LOC Griensven  ] commented that it looked like [LOC Chora  ] might fall despite the vigorous defense the [MISC Dutch  ] were mounting . 
Specifically , they were firing live rounds from their [PER Panzer Howitzer  ] and had authorized aircraft providing close air support to fire on selected targets , techniques usually eschewed by the [MISC Dutch  ] because of the possibility of civilian casualties. --------------------------------------------- ---- A Moment of [MISC Choice:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] Go on the Offensive --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In the face of this dire situation , [MISC TF-U  ] staff considered two alternatives . 
They could withdraw [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] forces from [LOC Chora  ] and stay faithful to a strict interpretation of their reconstruction mandate in the province . 
Or they could commit themselves indefinitely to the fight for [LOC Chora  ] , and for the first time commit their battle group to an offensive operation without the requirement that the enemy fire first . 
The [MISC TF-U  ] commander chose to go on the offensive , recognizing that this might result , despite their best efforts , in some collateral damage . 
General Berlijn , commander of the [MISC Dutch  ] armed forces , authorized this decision. ----------------------- Fighting the [MISC Good Fight KABUL  ] 00002004 002 OF 004 ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) On Sunday evening , [ORG Dutch Special Forces  ] attacked [ORG Taliban  ] positions at the southern entrance to the [LOC Baluchi Valley  ] , a traditional [ORG Taliban  ] sanctuary that lies between [LOC Chora  ] and the provincial capital [PER Tarin Kowt  ] . 
Their objective was to force insurgents in [LOC Chora  ] to divert forces to defend this strategic position . 
On Sunday night , the [MISC Dutch  ] bombed a location where [ORG Taliban  ] commanders were meeting , resulting in the deaths of the commander in charge of the operation , [PER Mullah Mutalib  ] , and three colleagues , [PER Mullahs Ismael  ] , [PER Sadiq  ] , and [PER Ghafour.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) On Monday morning , June 18 , [MISC Dutch  ] troops , joined by 90 soldiers of the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) , attacked insurgents on the west side of [LOC Chora  ] , re-taking checkpoints they had lost earlier that weekend . 
Simultaneously , tribal militias pushed out of [PER Sarab  ] attacked insurgents and re-took the [PER Sarab Hill  ] checkpoint . 
Militias led by [LOC Khas Uruzgan District  ] Chief [PER Jar Mohammed  ] and former provincial Chief of Police [PER Rozie Khan Sarab  ] joined checkpoint commanders [PER Toor Abdullah  ] and [PER Adul Malek  ] and their men in this battle . 
By early afternoon , the insurgents disengaged and fled . 
[ORG ISAF  ] had once again re-established control of the [LOC Chora  ] district center . 
One [MISC Dutch  ] soldier was killed and three wounded on Monday during the fighting . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have not reported any casualties among the [LOC ANSF.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) The [MISC Dutch  ] appeared to have regained the upper hand , at least for the moment . 
Meanwhile , the insurgents were said to be in disarray and demoralized . 
They were short on ammunition and weapons . 
With their top commanders dead , they lacked leadership and seemed to be at a loss as to how to re- group and carry on with the fight . 
Many fled to safe areas or hid among the population. ------------------ The Threat Remains ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) While diminished for the time being , the insurgent threat remains and attacks could soon start again . 
A group of insurgents remains in position between [LOC Chora District Center  ] and [PER Sarab  ] . 
Another is sitting to the northwest of [LOC Chora  ] in the vicinity of the [LOC Niazy  ] checkpoint . 
There were reports that 100 reinforcements under the command of [PER Mullahs Hamdullah  ] and [PER Qahir  ] left [ORG Mirabad  ] on Tuesday , June 19 , bound for [LOC Chora  ] . 
Reinforcements could also come from safe havens in [LOC Gizab  ] district and the [LOC Baluchi Valley.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) Intelligence indicates the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] have already established a new command structure . 
[PER Mullah Aktar Mohammed  ] has been tapped as commander for the [LOC Chora  ] district . 
[PER Mullah Aminullah  ] now commands forces in [LOC Cahar Cineh  ] district . 
And [PER Qahir Faiz Mohammed  ] is said to now lead the [ORG Taliban  ] in the vicinity of [PER Tarin Kowt  ] , including [ORG Mirabad  ] to the east and [LOC Darefshan  ] to the north. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) Some [MISC Dutch  ] platoons and [ORG ANA  ] returned from [LOC Chora  ] Thursday , June 21 , to rest and refit . 
Three [MISC Dutch  ] platoons , a number of PRT personnel and about 50 [ORG ANA  ] will remain in [LOC Chora  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will maintain their forces in [LOC Chora  ] for the foreseeable future . 
They are there to perform a number of functions: to act as a deterrent to future attack ; to work with [ORG ANSF  ] to defend the area ; to provide relief to civilians affected by the fighting ; and to resume reconstruction work . 
The [ORG ANA  ] are likely to be pulled out as soon as police -- either local police from [LOC Uruzgan  ] or 80 of the [ORG ASP  ] who are already in [LOC Uruzgan  ] -- arrive to man and reinforce checkpoints in and around [LOC Chora  ] . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00002004 003 OF 004 ------------------- Impact on Civilians ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Daily life in [LOC Chora  ] is slowly returning to normal . 
The bazaar is open . 
Children are going to school . 
Families that fled the fighting are returning home . 
Local men can be seen again on the street. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) But the fighting took a toll on the local population . 
There are multiple reports of civilian casualties in the press , many of them exaggerated . 
According to [MISC TF-U  ] , 30 plus civilians were killed during the fight ( from June 15 on ) and 62 were wounded . 
These numbers are still preliminary and do not distinguish between casualties that resulted from enemy action and those resulting from [ORG ISAF  ] action . 
The [ORG PRT  ] has dispatched its medical and legal specialists to [LOC Chora  ] to work with local authorities to investigate this issue. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S/REL TO NATO/AUS ) The [ORG Taliban  ] executed an as yet undetermined number of civilians . 
These acts were directed at those supporting the [ORG GoA  ] and their families . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have confirmed the executions of checkpoint commander [PER Abdul Malek  ] 's two brothers . 
There are multiple reports that checkpoint commander [PER Toor Jan  ] 's family was executed , women and children included. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG PRT  ] has maintained a steady presence throughout the build-up in tensions and the recent fighting . 
Now it is in the process of reinforcing its team in [LOC Chora  ] with additional civil affairs personnel , police mentors , and subject matter experts . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government has put 1.2 million [PER Afghani  ] ( approximately USD 24,000 ) at the [ORG PRT  ] 's disposal for emergency relief ( food , blankets , shelter , and clothing ) . 
The [ORG PRT  ] is working to access [ORG ISAF  ] funds to assist families repairing and replacing property damaged by the fighting . 
However , the [MISC Dutch  ] are not prepared to immediately promise to compensate all those civilians who claim to have suffered losses . 
They first want to compile information on where and when they fired into the area , so that they might limit payment to those legitimate claims for which [ORG ISAF  ] is responsible . 
They also do not appear to have identified a source of funds for compensation/reconstruction of lives and personnel property . 
Possibly because of their policy to avoid collateral damage at all cost , they did not have a pre-existing plan/procedure to deal with this eventuality . 
Rather , they began Monday , June 18 , to work from scratch to devise a response to the humanitarian costs of this fight in [LOC Chora.  ] ------- Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] here acquitted themselves well in [LOC Chora  ] . 
They accurately assessed the threat and overcame policy obstacles to the kind of forward-leaning , offensive operations demanded by the situation . 
They dealt the [ORG Taliban  ] a resounding blow , even at the cost of one of their own . 
They are carefully but quickly replying to criticism about civilian collateral damage with facts and concrete plans to address civilian need , which prevents the [ORG Taliban  ] from getting ahead on this front . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government has publicly stated its intent to continue the mission in the face of the dangers ( ref B ) . 
There will be those who use what happened in [LOC Chora  ] to try to argue against the extension of the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] beyond 2008 . 
Strong arguments for extension can also be extrapolated from the events of the last week. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a private meeting which included the [LOC KABUL  ] 00002004 004 OF 004 [MISC Dutch  ] Ambassador on June 21 , President [PER Karzai  ] expressed concern about use of artillery and the danger of civilian casualties . 
Both the [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] Commander [PER McNeill  ] explained the situation . 
We believe/believe the President was reassured .
