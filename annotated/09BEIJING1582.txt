SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) While the 2008 first round of the [ORG UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue  ] ( [ORG EFD  ] ) was a “bloody disaster , ” the second meeting , held in [LOC London  ] May 11 , 2009 , produced “decent results , ” according to [LOC UK  ] Embassy Econoff [PER Tamsin Rees  ] , who coordinated the [LOC UK  ] Embassy’s contributions to the event . 
[PER Rees  ] said that while EFD1 was marred by a protocol-driven , scripted exchange , [PER EFD2  ] featured more dialogue , and benefited from substantive working-level exchanges in advance of the ministerial meeting on touchy topics like market access . 
[PER Rees  ] said key deliverables from [PER EFD2  ] include a fast track patent program for green technologies , a bank assurance pilot project permitting [ORG Standard Life  ] to establish an insurance business in [LOC China  ] , and commitment to another round of the successful [ORG China-Africa Dialogue  ] . 
( The full outcomes list is in paragraph nine . 
) Still , protocol snafus dogged [PER EFD2  ] , such as when various [MISC British  ] Ministers came and left throughout the day . 
[PER Rees  ] added that the [LOC UK  ] also earlier assembled its Ambassadors to the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Moscow  ] , the [ORG United Nations  ] , and the [ORG European Union  ] for a [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] meeting with State Councilor [PER Dai Bingguo  ] , which featured a good off-the-record discussion on [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and some trade topics . 
End Summary . 
What Worked Well at the Second [ORG EFD  ] -- Lessons for [MISC SnED  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rees  ] attributed the greater success of [PER EFD2  ] to more open discussion , better preparation , a good atmosphere , and senior buy-in on the [LOC UK  ] side . 
She said more free discussion had made a “massive difference.” The format limited the length of interventions to three minutes each . 
She said the [LOC UK  ] had initially pushed for a two minute limit . 
There were 45-minute “free discussion blocks” on three key topics , which resulted in a 30-40 minute talk on trade and investment , a topic that [LOC China  ] had initially resisted even including on the agenda , she said . 
In the end , [PER Rees  ] described [MISC Chinese  ] delegation head Vice Premier [PER Wang Qishan  ] as “very vocal” and willing to talk off the cuff . 
She added that [LOC China  ] was very interested in comments by the Chairman of the [ORG UK Financial Services Authority  ] on financial regulation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rees  ] added that an earlier series of working-level meetings contributed to the dialogue at the ministerial . 
Despite China’s initial unwillingness to negotiate -- or even discuss -- some matters , the [MISC British  ] were able to overcome this resistance by really pressing the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
For example , the [LOC UK  ] kept pushing for a “joint statement” to the press rather than the pre-prepared one preferred by the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
Ultimately , [MISC British  ] persistence meant the parties agreed on a statement which was much closer to the one the [LOC UK  ] had envisioned . 
[LOC China  ] also initially refused to discuss market access , but in the plenary lead-up the [LOC UK  ] told [LOC China  ] that they felt [LOC China  ] was not taking the issue seriously . 
As a result , [ORG MOFCOM  ] assembled 12 [MISC Chinese  ] agencies for a half-day meeting with the [LOC UK  ] Ambassador to discuss market access . 
At first , [LOC China  ] agreed on six market access-related deliverables , but backed out the next day , likely over concern about making the concessions public , [PER Rees  ] assessed. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rees  ] added that the setting of the meeting also facilitated an open conversation . 
The parties met in London’s elegant [LOC Lancaster House  ] , which is adjacent to [LOC Buckingham Palace  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] offered [LOC China  ] its own secretariat room . 
[MISC Chinese  ] participants were free to enter and leave the facility as they pleased . 
Vice Premier [PER Wang  ] even had a room with a terrace and garden , allowing him to smoke between sessions . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00001582 002 OF 005 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In contrast , [PER Rees  ] said EFD1 was a “disaster” and a “protocol-driven waste of time.” She lamented that a certain Chancellor , who came to [LOC Beijing  ] from the [ORG World Bank-IMF Spring  ] meetings in [LOC Washington  ] “was not engaged , was not sure why he was doing the event or what the goal was , and did not understand why the meeting had been upgraded from the existing financial dialogue.” She added that he arrived in [LOC Beijing  ] and “decided he hated the press statement” and wanted it re-written overnight . 
Charm Offensive , or Just Plain Offensive ? ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Nonetheless , [PER EFD2  ] had a couple hiccups . 
Most notably , [LOC UK  ] Ministers who were scheduled to participate decided at the last minute that they could not commit for the whole day , and instead came and left at various sessions , while the [MISC Chinese  ] delegation stayed for the whole event . 
[PER Rees  ] admitted that it may have been a mistake to wait until the night before the event to inform the [MISC Chinese  ] delegation of this change in format. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) She added that the [PER Dalai Lama  ] had transited the [LOC UK  ] days before the event , that the [LOC UK  ] had refused a visa to a [MISC Chinese  ] violinist who was scheduled to perform at the [ORG Bank of China  ] 80th anniversary dinner , which Vice Premier [PER Wang  ] attended , and that [PER Wang  ] claimed he is allergic to alcohol while the [LOC UK  ] had planned a whiskey dinner . 
She added that the latter issue confused the [LOC UK  ] side because the former head of the [ORG Hong Kong Monetary Authority  ] had said he used to go drinking together with [PER Wang  ] . 
Dialogue Deliverables: Tiptoeing Forward... -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] and [LOC China  ] left [PER EFD2  ] with a list of policy outcomes -- some substantive , some vague and nominal . 
[PER Rees  ] complained about the “unwillingness on the part of the [MISC Chinese  ] MFA to negotiate on anything.” The parties split the plenary into four sessions within which they developed policy outcomes: Supporting Economic Growth and Welfare ; Financial Stability and [ORG Capital Market Development  ] ; Supporting Green Growth through Bilateral Energy and [ORG Environment Cooperation  ] ; and [ORG Trade and Investment  ] . 
[PER Rees  ] highlighted the following ( the complete list is attached in para nine ) : - Climate: [LOC China  ] insisted on couching everything climate-related in vague language , like “the two sides will share expertise.” [LOC China  ] called the topic “very sensitive” and deleted all references to “carbon markets , ” saying this was “inconvenient to discuss.” [PER Rees  ] speculated that [LOC China  ] may want to refrain from making concessions to the [LOC UK  ] as it prepares for multilateral climate talks in [LOC Copenhagen.  ] - IPR: In addition to fast track patent licenses for green technology , [PER Rees  ] said there were additional [MISC IPR-related  ] outcomes which were not included in the public announcement. - [ORG Africa: China  ] agreed to propose a date for another round of the [ORG UK-China Africa Dialogue  ] . 
In the last meeting , which [PER Rees  ] called a success , the [LOC UK  ] delivered an assessment on the wider impact of [MISC Chinese  ] investment in [LOC Africa.  ] - Bank assurance pilot: [LOC China  ] agreed to allow the [ORG UK’s Standard Life  ] to establish an insurance subsidiary and the [LOC UK  ] agreed to permit [ORG Hainan Bank  ] to do the same . 
[PER Rees  ] added that [PER Wang Qishan’s  ] support on this was invaluable because coordination between the [ORG China Insurance Regulatory Commission  ] and [ORG China Bank Regulatory Commission  ] on this issue , which cut across their portfolios , had been a “nightmare.” - Financial sector: The parties agreed to allow [LOC UK  ] firms to list in [LOC Shanghai  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] firms to list in [LOC London  ] , which [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001582 003 OF 005 [PER Rees  ] noted [LOC China  ] had already previously agreed to do at the EFD1 , but had failed to implement . 
Separate [ORG UK-China Foreign Policy Dialogue  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rees  ] added that the [LOC UK  ] also conducts a [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] with [MISC Chinese  ] State Councilor [PER Dai Bingguo  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] lead is [PER Simon McDonald  ] , Prime Minister Brown’s lead foreign policy advisor . 
At the most recent meeting in [LOC Beijing  ] , [PER McDonald  ] assembled [LOC UK  ] ambassadors to the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Moscow  ] , the [ORG United Nations  ] , and the [ORG European Union  ] for an off-the-record , open walk-through with [MISC Chinese  ] officials on key third country issues , like [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] , as well as some trade concerns .
