Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) On the alleged order of Senior General [PER Than Shwe  ] , regime cronies and businessmen launched the new [ORG Myanmar National Football League  ] ( [ORG MNL  ] ) on May 16 , 2009 . 
To date , the [ORG MNL  ] has been a huge success , with high attendance and wide national TV and radio coverage . 
It is unclear if there is any political motivation behind the [ORG MNL  ] , although many [MISC Burmese  ] businessmen speculate the regime is using it as a way to distract the populace from ongoing political and economic problems . 
End Summary . 
Let the [LOC Games Begin  ] ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Myanmar Football Federation  ] ( [ORG MFF  ] ) , chaired by regime crony [PER Zaw Zaw  ] , launched the [ORG Myanmar National Football League  ] on May 16 , 2009 . 
The league , the first of its kind , has eight professional teams representing different states and divisions . 
During the [MISC May-July  ] season , teams compete for the [MISC National Cup  ] and title of [ORG Myanmar National League Champion  ] . 
The teams are sponsored by regime cronies and businessmen ( listed below ) . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Zaw  ] [PER Zaw  ] and [PER Than Shwe’s  ] grandson created the idea of a professional soccer league more than a year ago but had to obtain the Senior General’s support first . 
One well-connected source reports that the grandson wanted [PER Than Shwe  ] to offer USD 1 billion for [ORG Manchester United  ] . 
The Senior General thought that sort of expenditure could look bad , so he opted to create for [LOC Burma  ] a league of its own . 
In January , Secretary-1 reportedly told select [MISC Burmese  ] businessmen that [PER Than Shwe  ] had “chosen” them to be the owners of the new professional soccer teams . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the owners are responsible for paying all costs , including team salaries , housing and transportation , uniform costs , and advertising for the new league . 
In addition , owners must build new stadiums in their respective regions by 2011 , at an estimated cost of [MISC USD  ] one million per stadium. --------------------------------------------- ------ [ORG Myanmar National League  ] 2009 Teams --------------------------------------------- ------ Team Owner and Company Sanctions Subject --------------------------------------------- ------ [ORG Kanbawza Aung Ko Win/Kanbawza Bank No Delta United Zaw Win Shaine/Ayeyar  ] Hintha No ( financially backed by [PER Zaw  ] [PER Zaw  ] , owner of Max [ORG Myanmar Yes  ] Magway [PER Steven Law/Asia World Co  ] .

( C ) The eight teams currently practice and play in [LOC Rangoon  ] ; by 2011 , the [ORG MNL  ] should have a nationwide presence , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated . 
The teams have an average of 40 players and salaries range from between [MISC USD  ] 500-2000 a month , depending on the caliber of the players . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Steven Law’s  ] Magway team pays the highest salaries , spending [MISC USD  ] 155,000 a month , while [PER Win Myint’s Zayar  ] [PER Shwe Myay  ] team only spends [MISC USD  ] 52,200 a month on salaries . 
Tay Za , [ORG Aung Ko Win  ] , and [PER Steven Law  ] also pay their players high signing bonuses , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG Aung Ko Win  ] , owner of the [PER Kanbawza  ] team , has budgeted [MISC USD  ] 2 million for the 2009 season . 
Other owners will spend approximately the same amount , he noted. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Several of the team owners have taken their obligations seriously , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated . 
For example , Tay Za has hired five players from [LOC Africa  ] ; and [PER Zaw Zaw  ] , who financially backs the [ORG Delta United  ] team despite being Chair of the [ORG MFF  ] , recruited several [MISC Argentinean  ] players . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [ORG Aung Kyaw Moe  ] , owner of [ORG Okkthar United Team  ] and the [ORG International Brewery Trade Co  ] . 
( which produces [ORG Myanmar Beer  ] and [ORG Grand Royal Whiskey  ] ) , is currently sponsoring the July 2009 [MISC National Cup  ] . 
Tay Za’s Air [ORG Bagan  ] allegedly plans to host the next cup , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated . 
So What’s In it for The Owners ? ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When asked why the owners would participate in such an expensive endeavor , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed that they had little choice. “When the Senior General asks someone to do something , you do it with no complaints , ” he stated . 
He then added that several of the businessmen will receive incentives from the regime , such as construction contracts , new gem and jade mines , and import permits , which will more than offset their costs . 
Sponsorship may also bring its own benefits . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that due to advertising associated with the [ORG MNL  ] , several owners , including Sai [PER Sam Htun  ] who owns [LOC Alpine Water  ] , have seen an immediate increase in business revenue . 
Several owners have plans to sell team merchandise . 
As the league expands , business should boom , although it will take a few years , he concluded . 
Early Success ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG MNL  ] to date has been quite successful . 
Tickets are relatively expensive by [MISC Burmese  ] standards , ranging from [MISC USD  ] .50 to [ORG USD  ] 1 , which can be as much as half a day’s salary for the average [MISC Burmese  ] . 
Nevertheless , there has been heavy attendance at most of the games , with several games sold out . 
Reportedly though , owners paid up to [ORG USD  ] 3 per head to entice fans to the first games , when it looked like ticket [ORG RANGOON  ] 00000355 003.2 OF 003 sales were lagging . 
Proceeds from the [ORG MNL  ] are used to support the [ORG MFF  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that for the more popular teams , such as Yadanarbon and Magway , scalpers are able to sell tickets for up to [MISC USD  ] 1.50 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that given the continued political and economic repression of the people , he understands why they want to spend their money on something enjoyable . 
For those who cannot afford to attend the games , [PER MRTV  ] ( the [MISC GOB’s  ] television network ) shows the games live . 
During Saturdays and Sundays at 4pm , local teashops are filled with [MISC Burmese  ] watching the games . 
Additionally , the matches are broadcast on the radio . 
[LOC MNL: A  ] Distraction or Just Good Fun ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While admitting that the [ORG MNL  ] is “just good fun , ” a number of our contacts question the regime’s motivation behind creating the league . 
Several have commented that it may be a way for the regime to distract the people from ongoing political and economic problems , or to divert their attention from criticism of the upcoming 2010 elections . 
Many speculate that the regime will suspend the 2010 [ORG MNL  ] cup , should it fall close to the election date , as the government may not want large crowds of people to gather . 
That remains to be seen . 
Whatever the reason , the [ORG MNL  ] is proving an early success , and something for the [MISC Burmese  ] to talk about without threatening the regime .
