ABU [ORG DHABI  ] 145 Classified By: [PER Michele Sison  ] , reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
Abu [ORG Dhabi Crown  ] Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the [ORG UAE Armed Forces Sheikh Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( [PER MbZ  ] ) [PER Al Nahyan  ] hosted Chief of Staff USAF General [PER T. Michael Moseley  ] on February 1 , 2007 . 
[PER MbZ  ] warned [PER Moseley  ] of the growing threat from [LOC Iran  ] , stating that they ( [LOC Iran  ] ) " can't be allowed to have a nuclear program . 
" [PER MbZ  ] further emphasized that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program must be stopped " by all means available . 
" As expected , [PER MbZ  ] inquired about Predator [PER B. Moseley  ] informed [PER MbZ  ] that the question of Predator B would require further discussion within the interagency and with our [ORG MTCR  ] partners , while Ambassador noted that the [ORG USG  ] looked forward to discussion of [LOC UAE  ] defense requirements and our shared security objectives in the context of the [ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] expressed a desire to have a missile defense system in place by Summer 2009 , and was looking to add ship-based launch platforms as a part of that system . 
He also noted that the [LOC UAE  ] had identified a location on the northern border at an elevation of 6,000 feet that may be suitable for installation of an early warning radar system . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Stating that " we are living in a dangerous neighborhood , " [PER MbZ  ] stressed the importance of curtailing [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program to the overall stability of the [LOC Gulf  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] as a region , and to the world 's energy markets . 
Pointing out that a nuclear weapon with even a short-range delivery system puts all the critical infrastructure in the [LOC Gulf  ] at risk -- as well as the oil shipping lanes -- [PER MbZ  ] asserted: " If [LOC Iran  ] can increase oil production to more than 15 million barrels of oil per day , let them have nuclear power , but until they can replace ( the [LOC Gulf  ] 's ) oil production they can't be allowed to have a nuclear program . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] told [PER Moseley  ] that the [LOC US  ] should not focus too much on [PER Ahmadinejad  ] as the problem , but should focus instead on " the greater [MISC Iranian  ] threat . 
" Calling [PER Ahmadinejad  ] " merely the driver " of a bus ( nuclear program ) that has been running for a long time in [LOC Iran  ] , [PER MbZ  ] described [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program as one that is no longer driven by personalities -- but which has become part of the [MISC Iranian  ] identity . 
Noting that even if [PER Ahmadinejad  ] or other leaders were to change , the nuclear program would still continue , [PER MbZ  ] stated: " Even a siege at this point will not change anything . 
" In answer to [PER Moseley  ] 's question what should be done , [PER MbZ  ] responded: " Delay their program -- by all means available . 
" He added: " I am saying this knowing that I am putting my country at risk and placing myself in a dangerous spot . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Speaking about his fears of [LOC Iran  ] 's growing hegemonic aspirations , [PER MbZ  ] warned the [LOC US  ] not to underestimate the [MISC Iranians  ] characterizing them as " extremely smart . 
" " It amazes me , " [PER MbZ  ] continued , " that the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , which controls [ORG Hamas  ] , has at its core an opposition to all things [ORG Shi'a  ] , and yet they ( [ORG Hamas  ] ) cooperate with [LOC Iran  ] . 
That shows you how smart they are . 
" [PER MbZ  ] then pointed to what he called successful [MISC Iranian  ] actions in [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and [LOC Palestine  ] to illustrate how [LOC Iran  ] has managed to manipulate [MISC Muslim  ] extremism in order to advance [ORG Shi'a  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] goals . 
UAV/Predator B -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] again asked about the status of the [LOC UAE  ] request to acquire Predator [PER B. GeneralMoseley  ] informed [PER MbZ  ] that the question of Predatr B acquisition would require further discussionwithin the interagency and with our [ORG MTCR  ] partners . 
[PER MbZ  ] nodded in understanding: " We are patient . 
" He then added: " I hope the [MISC Iranians  ] give us time ; they are aggressive and are moving fast . 
" [PER MbZ  ] also mentioned that there were several other countries offering UAVs to the [LOC UAE  ] . 
Ambassador added that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the other 33 [ORG MTCR  ] members would be meeting in March to review the [ORG MTCR  ] control list . 
Growing demand worldwide for unmanned aerial vehicles had led to the need for a general discussion of how the [ORG MTCR  ] controls UAVs and cruise missiles , and the [ORG USG  ] looked forward to further discussion of [LOC UAE  ] defense requirements and our shared security objectives in the context of the ongoing [ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] ( [ORG GSD  ] ) . 
[ORG Strategic Interests  ] ------------------- ABU [ORG DHABI  ] 00000187 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Moseley  ] 's meeting with [PER MbZ  ] immediately followed a Raytheon/Lockheed [PER Martin  ] briefing of [PER MbZ  ] on the ongoing development of [LOC THAAD/PAC-3  ] and shared early warning systems . 
Speaking of a time frame for the first time , [PER MbZ  ] said he wants a complete missile defense system by summer 2009 . 
[PER MbZ  ] expressed particular interest in the possibility of mounting [LOC PAC-3  ] on [ORG Littoral Combat Ships  ] ( [ORG LCS  ] ) . 
Learning that [LOC PAC-3  ] cannot yet be mounted on a seagoing platform , [PER MbZ  ] was pleased to note that [ORG SLAMRAAM  ] has already tested successfully on a wide variety of platforms and could be ship-based . 
Sheikh ( Major ) [PER Ahmed  ] bin [PER Tahnoon A-Nahyan  ] , advisor to [PER MbZ  ] on critical infrastructure protection , took particular note of this fact and asked about upgrading/extending their existing Hawk/AMRAAM assets . 
When briefers noted the 32km limit of unelevated radar , [PER MbZ  ] stated that he has a location identified on the [LOC UAE  ] 's northern border at an elevation of 6000 feet that he would like contractors to come back and look at as a possible location for an early warning radar system . 
Also present was [ORG International Affairs Advisor  ] to the [LOC Crown Prince  ] 's Court [PER Yousef Al-Otaiba  ] , who is a [LOC UAE  ] representative to the [LOC GSD.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: Although [PER MbZ  ] is increasingly talking tough on [LOC Iran  ] , i.e. , stop [LOC Iran  ] " by all means possible " and " deal with [LOC Iran  ] sooner rather than later " ( ref A ) , his comments should also be taken in the context of strong [LOC UAE  ] interest in acquiring advanced military technology and , specifically , [PER MbZ  ] 's repeated requests for Predator B ( ref B ) . 
The UAEG is clearly nervous about any [LOC US  ] actions that could upset their much larger and militarily superior neighbor . 
The [LOC UAE  ] 's significant trade relationship with Iran--approximately $4 billion--is another complicating factor in the relationship . 
On more than one occasion , the [LOC UAE  ] leadership has expressed trepidation over the prospect of being caught in the middle between the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
End Comment. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) POLAD , Chief of Staff [LOC USAF  ] , Ambassador [PER Marcelle M. Wahba  ] has approved this message .
