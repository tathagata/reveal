END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The delegation [ORG met: Ministry of Commerce  ] ( [ORG MOFCOM  ] ) [MISC American  ] and [ORG Oceanic Affairs  ] Director General ( [ORG DG  ] ) [PER He Ning  ] ; [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] ( [ORG MOF  ] ) [ORG External Economic Cooperation DG Zou  ] Jaiyi ; [ORG National Bureau of Statistics  ] ( [ORG NBS  ] ) DG [PER Li Xiaochao  ] ; [ORG China Construction Bank  ] ( [ORG CCB  ] ) Chief Economist [PER Erh-Cheng Hwa  ] ; [ORG National Development and Reform Commission  ] ( [ORG NDRC  ] ) Cong Liang ; [ORG State Administration for Foreign Exchange  ] ( [ORG SAFE  ] ) [ORG Capital Controls Deputy DG Chu Yumei  ] ; UBS economist [PER Wang Tao  ] ; [ORG Central Finance and Economic Leading Group  ] ( [ORG CFELG  ] ) Vice Minister [PER Liu He  ] ; [ORG MOF  ] Assistant Minister [PER Zhu Guangyao  ] ; [ORG Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  ] ( [ORG CASS  ] ) Professors [PER Huang Ping  ] and [PER Xiao Lian  ] ; [ORG Chinese Institute for Contemporary International Relations  ] ( [ORG CICIR  ] ) Professor [PER Da Wei  ] ; [ORG China Center for Economic Research  ] ( [ORG CCER  ] ) Scholar [PER Lu Feng  ] ; [ORG Development Research Center  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) Scholar [PER Tang Min  ] ; Managing Director of Hill and [PER Knowlton John Holden  ] ; [ORG Oshkosh Senior  ] Director of [ORG Business Development Jennifer Thompson  ] ; [LOC Akin  ] , [LOC Gump  ] , [PER Strauss  ] , [ORG Hauer & Feld LLP Partner Spencer Griffith  ] ; and [ORG IBM Global Services Deputy  ] Chief Representative She [PER Duan Zhi.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG State Department Deputy  ] Assistant Secretary for [LOC China  ] and [LOC Mongolia  ] [PER David Shear  ] and [ORG Treasury Department Executive  ] Secretary and Senior Coordinator for [LOC China  ] and the [ORG S&ED  ] [PER David Loevinger  ] led the [ORG State-Treasury S&ED II  ] planning trip to [LOC Beijing  ] . 
The [ORG Economic Track  ] delegation also included: [ORG Economic  ] Minister Counselor [PER William Weinstein  ] ; [ORG Treasury  ] Attache [PER David Dollar  ] ; [ORG Senior Advisor  ] to the [ORG Treasury  ] Under Secretary-designate for [ORG International Affairs Raji Jagadeesan  ] ; Director of [ORG Treasury  ] 's Office of [LOC East Asia Chris Winship  ] ; [ORG State Department Deputy  ] Director , Office of [ORG Monetary Affairs  ] [PER David Meale  ] ; Assistant to the [ORG U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue Casey Owens  ] ; [ORG Deputy Financial Attache to China  ] ( incoming ) [PER Tim Dorsett  ] ; and Embassy EconOffs . 
[ORG S&ED Planning  ] -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On preparations for the [ORG Economic Track of the S&ED  ] , neither [ORG MFA  ] nor [ORG MOF  ] officials replied to the [LOC U.S.  ] proposal to hold the [ORG Dialogue  ] during the week of May 10 , and reiterated [LOC China  ] 's preference for late May . 
In a meeting with [ORG MOF  ] Assistant Minister [PER Zhu Guangyao  ] , the two sides agreed to exchange proposed [ORG Economic Track  ] outcomes in early March . 
Searching for mutually acceptable phrasing for the public agenda , [ORG MOF  ] DG [PER Zou Jiayi  ] , observing that the two sides were " quite close " on most points , said the most difficult area for [ORG MOF  ] was exchange rates and relative prices . 
She preferred not to use exchange rates in the document , as that would attract too much focus , but said the term relative prices was too narrow . 
[ORG Zou  ] also mentioned that the [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] ( MOST ) did not want to discuss the indigenous innovation issue at the [ORG S&ED  ] , but hoped to be able to discuss it bilaterally prior to the [ORG S&ED  ] ; [ORG Zou  ] agreed to convey [ORG USG  ] views back to MOST . 
Exchange Rates/RMB Appreciation a " Political Issue " --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Officials demonstrated little outward receptivity to the message of RMB appreciation . 
[ORG MOFCOM  ] DG [PER He Ning  ] rejected [LOC U.S.  ] calls for RMB appreciation , claiming that political pressure from the economic situation in the [LOC United States  ] and other countries should not be shifted onto [LOC China  ] in the form of a call for RMB appreciation . 
[PER He  ] pointed out that in 2009 [MISC Chinese  ] exports to the [LOC United States  ] had dropped 12 or 13 percent , vice an only four percent drop in imports from the [LOC United States  ] , without any change in the exchange rate . 
[ORG State Council Economic and Financial Leading Group  ] Vice Minister [PER Liu He  ] noted the currency issue was no longer an economic issue , but more of a " political issue for both sides . 
" [PER Liu  ] explained that exports , while slower , had still helped [ORG China BEIJING  ] 00000352 002 OF 002 successfully create new jobs this year , keep the unemployment rate--and thus the political system--fairly stable. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Assistant Finance Minister [PER Zhu Guangyao  ] agreed that both [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] faced political constraints and pressures with regard to the exchange rate , and urged [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Beijing  ] to maintain open communication to manage this issue and keep it out of the public eye as long as possible . 
[PER Zhu  ] also pointed out that [LOC China  ] was worried about inflows of hot money , stemming at least in part from low [LOC U.S.  ] interest rates. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the other hand , private economists agreed that [MISC Chinese  ] officials likely favored a return to gradual appreciation of the RMB , despite the possibility of attracting speculative capital inflows . 
UBS economist [PER Wang Tao  ] , for example , expected a move mid-year , with a near-term goal of five percent appreciation by year-end 2010 . 
[ORG China Construction Bank  ] Vice President/Chief Economist [PER Hwa Erh-cheng  ] agreed that the exchange rate was a " challenge " for the [ORG People 's Bank of China  ] ( [ORG PBOC  ] ) , and even though the [ORG PBOC  ] might be forced to allow appreciation , it would only be incremental because the international environment remained fragile and the export recovery was not strong . 
Predicting that the [ORG RMB  ] would rise about three percent in 2010 and five percent in 2011 , [PER Hwa  ] concluded that it was unlikely to be a " one-shot " change ( e.g. a jump appreciation ) . 
[LOC China  ] knows it needs to increase domestic demand and consumption to stabilize growth and adjust economic structure in 2010 , so the exchange rate issue must eventually be " part of the equation . 
" However , [PER Hwa  ] asserted that the [MISC Chinese  ] Government " will not be influenced by a [ORG Dialogue  ] . 
" Rising Housing Prices/ Overheating --------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On an overheating economy , Vice Minister [PER Liu He  ] pointed to asset bubbles as a potential problem for [LOC China  ] 's recovery and noted that people are withdrawing money from banks to invest in assets . 
[PER Liu  ] did not yet see the problem as serious . 
As a reaction to the trend , the [ORG China Banking and Regulatory Commission  ] ( [ORG CBRC  ] ) has instituted requirements to deter speculation , and the [ORG State Council  ] has ordered measures to tighten credit and mandated monitoring of state-owned enterprise ( [ORG SOE  ] ) investment in real estate . 
NBS DG [PER Li Xiaochao  ] noted that the real estate sector is important to the economy because it boosts both consumption and investment ; however , housing prices jumped 7.8 percent in December , which was a worrisome sign of over-investment and speculation in real estate . 
On inflation , [PER Li  ] claimed that , although 2009 saw negative inflation , November and December numbers turned positive . 
Bad weather in December and January , together with the government 's proactive fiscal policy , had generated inflationary pressure. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) CCB Vice President/Chief Economist [PER Hwa Erh-cheng  ] said the [MISC Chinese  ] Government is actively trying to cool the real estate market . 
Because private companies have been blocked from investing in the service sectors , more investment has flowed to real estate , increasing housing prices by as much as 50 percent in coastal cities . 
Further adding to the problem , SOEs have out-bid private companies , pushing up land prices . 
To deter speculation , [PER Hwa  ] said , the [ORG CBRC  ] has required banks to disburse loans to real estate suppliers rather than buyers . 
The market has started to believe that the government will continue to tighten monetary conditions to control overheating. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
