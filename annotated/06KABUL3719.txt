( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: The security situation in the south remains fragile , with an increasingly determined enemy operating freely in key areas according to a joint [ORG CFC  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] , [ORG GOA  ] brief to President [PER Karzai  ] in a [ORG Policy Action Group  ] ( PAG ) meeting on August 16 . 
[ORG Wardak  ] said that the enemy is succeeding in propaganda efforts that have convinced locals the [ORG GOA  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] are losing their will to fight . 
It was acknowledged that [MISC Operation Mountain Thrust  ] had eliminated many insurgents , but these are primarily low-level recruits . 
Enemy strength is estimated at 7,000 , vice a presence of 9,000 [ORG ISAF  ] and 4,300 [ORG ANSF  ] in the south . 
To address this situation , the PAG approved [ORG ISAF  ] 's basic [ORG Afghan Development Zone  ] ( [ORG ADZ  ] ) concept combining [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG ANSF  ] security with new development projects. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG ADZ  ] concept remains vague and will take time to launch depending on how long it will take to achieve a level of security sufficient for development projects to be executed in the provinces , and on how long it will take development money to flow . 
[ORG ISAF  ] predicts development activity will begin in late August in [LOC Qalat  ] , late September in [LOC Helmand  ] and [LOC Uruzgan  ] , and October in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
[ORG ISAF  ] has committed to keeping key district centers secure even though they are outside the zones , and has promised to take the initiative in offensives against insurgent positions outside the zones . 
[ORG ISAF  ] 's concept depends on donors rapidly completing new development projects , but there is considerable skepticism about delivery before early 2007 . 
Ambassador [PER Neumann  ] proposed that the [ORG GOA  ] contribute unallocated funds in tandem with donors to show its resolve . 
The [ORG GOA  ] responded by asking for a loosening of international procurement restrictions . 
President [PER Karzai  ] instructed that no one talk publicly about [ORG ADZ  ] 's either in [LOC Afghanistan  ] or foreign capitals for now. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) All agreed that &auxiliary8 police forces could be used if clearly within the [ORG MOI  ] chain of command . 
There is no donor commitment to fund the equipping of such forces . 
[PER Karzai  ] stated that the first priority must go to funding the training and equipping of the regular forces . 
More study of &auxiliary8 forces is ongoing . 
President [PER Karzai  ] said he would find the money himself within the [ORG GOA  ] if necessary . 
End Summary . 
Worrisome [ORG Security Assessment  ] in [LOC South  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) At the first PAG presentation to President [PER Karzai  ] , on August 16 , Minister of [ORG Defense Wardak  ] presented a blunt security assessment developed by the [ORG Policy Action Group  ] 's ( PAG 's ) [ORG Security Operations Group  ] ( full text of report follows at end of cable ) . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The text was coordinated among [ORG MOD  ] , [ORG MOI  ] , [ORG NDS  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] , [MISC CFC-A  ] , [LOC CSTC-A  ] , relevant [ORG Embassies  ] , and the four southern governors . 
End note . 
) The security situation in the south remains fragile . 
[MISC Operation Mountain Thrust  ] inflicted significant losses on insurgents , but primarily against low-level , easily replaced recruits . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] campaign in outlying areas has convinced significant portions of the local population the [ORG GOA  ] cannot deliver governance and that [ORG ISAF  ] and international resolve are withering. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The tempo of enemy operations has fallen since [LOC KABUL  ] 00003719 002 OF 006 mid-July with the exception of [LOC Kandahar  ] , but [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG ANSF  ] forces remain under attack , inhibiting efforts to improve governance and start new development activities . 
The analysis estimated that up to 7,000 [ORG Taliban  ] fighters are active in the [LOC South  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] the number of hard-core [ORG Taliban  ] is probably lower . 
End Note . 
) The quality and quantity of IED attacks has risen . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] are becoming increasingly willing to defend key terrain with large sophisticated , well-armed groups of fighters . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] have developed significant positions in [ORG Kandahar Province  ] 's [LOC Panjway  ] , [LOC Zherai  ] and [LOC Arghandab  ] districts , as well as Northern and [ORG Southern Helmand Province  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] not all anti-government activity in the area is associated with the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
Some is related to crime , drugs and warlords . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Wardak  ] concluded that our aim must be to prevent the [ORG Taliban  ] from achieving their objectives . 
He called for [ORG ISAF  ] and the [ORG GOA  ] to take the initiative , warning that weak maneuverability prevents [ORG ISAF  ] and the [ORG ANSF  ] from attacking enemy positions . 
[LOC COMISAF  ] , LTG Richards , noted that , although bleak , this report was the combined opinion of experts , with no doubt as to its accuracy . 
He said [ORG ISAF  ] had been looking for a plan to take back the initiative , and that the [ORG Afghan Development Zone  ] concept was their solution . 
[ORG ADZ Concept  ] ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG ISAF  ] 's [ORG Afghan Development Zone  ] ( [ORG ADZ  ] ) concept ( see reftels ) is designed to address several key challenges in bringing security and development to the [MISC South:  ] the people feel disenfranchised ; there is a dissatisfaction with governance and the pace of development ; the [ORG Taliban  ] are exploiting this frustration by convincing the public the [ORG GOA  ] and [ORG International Community  ] ( [ORG IC  ] ) cannot deliver ; and , limited military , police and development resources preclude doing everything required everywhere at once . 
[ORG ISAF  ] and the [ORG GOA  ] are therefore prioritizing their actions in certain geographical areas of the south that have key populations , economic development and necessary infrastructure . 
( [ORG Note:  ] regular assessment of these priorities will continue for months . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG ADZ  ] solution attempts to unify security and development efforts from the [ORG GOA  ] and [ORG IC  ] to provide a robust level of security in key areas of the south and allow for rapid roll-out of new reconstruction and development projects . 
[ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG ANSF  ] forces will provide a security shield based in the priority regional centers and support maneuver teams patrolling outlying areas . 
The zones are not static and should expand to encompass ever widening territories. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG ADZ  ] concept was approved in principle by [PER Karzai  ] and the international community at the PAG meeting . 
Many issues and problems remain and whether [MISC ADZs  ] will be different from current operations is not clear . 
( [ORG Note: The Coalition  ] 's [LOC Mountain  ] series of operations successively focuses on certain geographical areas with kinetic and non-kinetic means , in a not-too dissimilar way as is proposed by the [ORG ADZ  ] concept . 
End Note . 
) [ORG ISAF  ] must take on further offensive operations before launching any [MISC ADZs  ] . 
General [PER Richards  ] predicted the [ORG ADZ  ] in [LOC Qalat  ] could be functional by late August , [LOC Helmand  ] and [LOC Uruzgan  ] the second or third week of September , and [LOC Kandahar  ] would probably take until October due to the problem of needing to clear insurgents out of [LOC Panjway  ] district . 
In a smaller meeting the evening before , August 15 , [PER Karzai  ] stressed to [ORG ISAF  ] LTG [PER Richards  ] that our first objective should be to retake all of [LOC Helmand  ] . 
In [LOC Kandahar  ] [LOC KABUL  ] 00003719 003 OF 006 province , we should also retake the district of [LOC Panjway  ] , he said , hinting darkly that other factors besides the [ORG Taliban  ] may be at work there . 
He said districts that were in our hands must be won back. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) At the PAG , [PER Karzai  ] insisted that no one talk about [MISC ADZs  ] publicly ; the [ORG IC  ] strongly agreed . 
( [ORG Note:  ] it is equally important [MISC ADZs  ] are not discussed publicly in [LOC Washington  ] . 
) Discussion of this idea is fraught with problems . 
[PER Karzai  ] was worried that people might perceive the creation of the zones as a sign government control was shrinking , reminding them of the [MISC Soviet  ] strategy of hunkering down in key cities and towns , and retreating . 
There was also concern that those outside the zones might feel vulnerable . 
Defining the zones may lead to attacks before security is in place . 
[PER Richards  ] promised that [ORG ISAF  ] would not abandon any key regional centers when the zones were established . 
He stressed that [MISC ADZs  ] are not a defensive concept , and that [ORG ISAF  ] will carry on offensive operations to drive the [ORG Taliban  ] out of their strongholds. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The development portion of the [ORG ADZ  ] concept is predicated on drawing additional funds that can be delivered immediately following the necessary security &clean up8 in certain areas . 
It is not now clear how much will be available ; most will be implementation of previously planned work by the [ORG Coalition and NGOs  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Neumann  ] asked that the [ORG GOA  ] also move money from programs where funds have not been spent to show [ORG GOA  ] support and buy-in . 
Minister of Finance Ahady said money was available , but procurement rules required by donors prevented its quick usage . 
President [PER Karzai  ] asked that the donor community lessen strictures for the use of funds transferred to the [ORG GOA  ] . 
He also requested that more funds go to [MISC Afghan  ] contractors and companies for smaller projects. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: The [ORG GOA  ] recognizes they need to win both on the ground and in people 's minds . 
The creation of the PAG was the [ORG GOA  ] 's first effort to come towards a solution . 
The [ORG ADZ  ] concept remains vague . 
The [ORG GOA  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] and the rest of the international community have signed on for now . 
[ORG ISAF  ] has promised to not only beef up security within the zones , but hold on to key villages and launch offensive strikes . 
The [MISC Brits  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC Canadians  ] and [MISC Australians  ] argue that they can provide the security and roll out new projects to bring governance and development throughout the south . 
We will support as we can . 
Problems remain , and the details are not fully developed . 
Doubts linger about tangible development results from [ORG ISAF  ] being possible quickly . 
Criticism of the zones , and the projects that will be planned for their clearly defined areas , is likely to hearken back to the [MISC Soviets  ] barricading down . 
For these reasons neither the [ORG GOA  ] nor the international community will announce or discuss the project , allowing any results to speak for themselves . 
( It is important that [MISC ADZs  ] not be discussed publicly in [LOC Washington  ] either . 
) End Comment . 
Police ------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) It was agreed that police rebalancing may not move fast enough to solve the short-term problem of providing sufficient police forces at the local level where they are needed now . 
In a private briefing that included Ambassador [PER Neumann  ] and President [PER Karzai  ] the evening before ( August 15 ) , Intelligence Chief designate [PER Amerullah Saleh  ] stressed that the [ORG GOA  ] is losing [MISC Pashtun  ] manpower in [MISC Afghan  ] security forces . 
He said it must either become more active in recruiting [LOC KABUL  ] 00003719 004 OF 006 locally into National forces or make far more use of the tribes . 
He pointed out that police brought from outside the area - specifically from [LOC Kunduz  ] - have all deserted . 
He said that rebalancing the police is simply not working and not producing the forces needed in time . 
The weakness of the police forces is also reducing intelligence gathering ability . 
[PER Saleh  ] said the [ORG GOA  ] was losing access to intelligence because police from outside are deserting and police from inside are no longer in contact with local villagers so they are getting less information. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) At the PAG meeting , President [PER Karzai  ] opened the discussion of police forces by expressing strong displeasure at reports from [LOC Ghazni  ] that indicate 1042 police are on the payroll , while far fewer actually exist . 
He was certain fraud exists throughout the country . 
[PER Karzai  ] decided [ORG ANP  ] priorities are to determine actual numbers of police , then recruit to the ceiling and then see if additional numbers of regular police are needed . 
However , he clearly wants to move forward on auxiliaries so there is not a clear &do all the police first8 prioritization. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Minister of Interior [PER Zarar  ] outlined a [ORG GOA  ] plan to recruit &auxiliary8 police in border regions and areas of high security threats . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The proper nomenclature for these forces is a work in progress . 
End note . 
) The first group would be trained and given a one-year contract . 
The requirements for hiring will be similar to the [ORG ANP  ] , with background checks , and following the same procedures . 
They would be under the command of the local police chiefs , and would receive one month of training in police procedures . 
( Comment: [PER Zarar  ] did not say that the [ORG GOA  ] would want to use the Police [ORG Regional Training Centers  ] for this purpose but it probably will . 
End comment . 
) The &auxiliaries8 would also require equipment: weapons , communications and transportation . 
[PER Zarar  ] explained the [ORG MOI  ] does not have the needed equipment and would need [ORG IC  ] help. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) International representatives accepted &auxiliaries8 could be used if clearly within the [ORG MOI  ] chain of command . 
Details and numbers need to be worked out . 
The [ORG IC  ] has no commitment to pay or equip. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Karzai  ] jumped in , saying that , &finally , today everyone speaks my mind and what I 've been saying for a year and a half . 
We need to re-empower traditional and trusted forms of authority.8 ( At the previous night 's meeting , [PER Karzai  ] had enthusiastically , if gloomily , spoke about how we are losing the population . 
He intimated that much of the trouble has come from premature removal of key tribal figures ( while he did not say so , this seemed to refer to the former Governors of [LOC Uruzgan  ] and [LOC Helmand  ] ) . 
[PER Karzai  ] said we have systematically disempowered the locals . 
They are hostile to us as a result , and therefore we must go back to more local government. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The internationals backed a [LOC U.S.  ] suggestion that the auxiliary police be paid and controlled directly by the [ORG MOI  ] rather than governors . 
Ambassador [PER Neumann  ] urged a more detailed plan - who , where and how many . 
[PER Karzai  ] responded that we should have started this program a year ago , and that the [ORG IC  ] should help with auxiliary police and strengthening communities , but if not he would find the money somehow. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: The issue of police numbers is more challenging , with the [ORG GOA  ] planning to move ahead with an &auxiliary8 police program , but asking for international support in money and equipment . 
The [ORG GOA  ] still doesn't have a concrete plan , and though we support the idea , neither we nor [LOC KABUL  ] 00003719 005 OF 006 anyone else in the international community has committed to fund it . 
End Comment . 
[ORG Southern Afghanistan Security Assessment  ] ( Full Text ) --------------------------------------------- ------- ( [ORG S  ] ) Begin Text: This assessment has been produced by the [ORG Security Operations Group  ] and reflects the combined views of the Ministries , organizations and Embassies represented . 
It has also been shown to members of the Implementation and [ORG Coordination Team  ] and their comments incorporated . 
The situation in the south remains very fragile . 
[MISC Operation Mountain Thrust  ] inflicted significant losses on the insurgents , especially in [LOC Uruzgan  ] and Northern [LOC Helmand  ] , but most are assessed to have been among their lower-level , short-term or peripheral fighters , who are easily replaceable . 
We assess that the [MISC Taliban  ] campaign to drive Government elements from outlying areas , convince the people that the Government cannot deliver and undermine the resolve of [ORG ISAF  ] and the international community will continue . 
Some fighting is motivated by tribal or criminal factors and not directly related to the [MISC Taliban  ] insurgency , and instability is exacerbated by the negative influence of former Governors and Police Chiefs , especially in [LOC Helmand  ] and [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Except in [LOC Kandahar  ] , the past month has seen a reduction in the tempo of enemy operations compared with mid-July . 
However , [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG ANSF  ] units remain under threat of attack in large parts of the region , making it extremely difficult to deliver effective governance and development . 
The threat from [MISC Improvised Explosive Devices  ] ( IEDs ) continues to increase in both quality and quantity . 
Recent engagements show that we are facing an increasingly determined and sophisticated enemy prepared to defend key terrain in large groups ( 100-plus fighters ) in developed defensive positions and to use these as a base for ambushes against key lines of communication . 
There are reliable reports of a significant [MISC Taliban  ] build-up in the [LOC Panjway  ] , [LOC Zherai  ] and [LOC Helmand  ] , and that planning has been conducted for an offensive . 
[MISC Taliban  ] operations in the vicinity of the Highway 1 corridor , particularly near [LOC Kandahar City  ] , [LOC Lashkar Gah  ] and [LOC Qalat  ] , are judged to pose the greatest risk to security in the near term . 
Zabol: The [MISC Romanian  ] [ORG Task Force  ] completed its relieve in place with [ORG Task Force Warrior  ] . 
The largest engagement since they arrived took place on 8 August in south-eastern [LOC Qalat  ] , and there are indications of increasing insurgent activity in the province . 
The Governor 's key concerns are highway security and the district of [LOC Seorai  ] . 
Uruzgan: [ORG Dutch Task Force  ] continued its deployment and conducted security patrols around [PER Tarin Kowt  ] and [ORG Dehrawud  ] . 
They intend to facilitate a major shura to reinforce the Governor 's authority . 
The districts of [LOC Charchina  ] ( [PER Shahidi Hassas  ] ) and [LOC Gizab  ] are particular areas of security concern , largely outside the control of government authorities . 
[LOC Helmand: Major  ] operation conducted to relieve and reinforce [LOC Musa Qaleh  ] district center . 
Northern and [MISC Southern  ] parts of the province remain of concern due to high levels of [LOC KABUL  ] 00003719 006 OF 006 insurgent activity . 
Significant [LOC UK  ] forces remain fixed defending static locations in the north of the province . 
[ORG Kandahar: Heavy  ] fighting in [LOC Panjway  ] and [LOC Zherai  ] districts , which remain a key [MISC Taliban  ] focus . 
[MISC Taliban  ] have established strong defensive positions and fought with determination . 
Continued enemy activity in the [LOC Arghandab  ] district is likely in order to maintain their line of communication to [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
ENEMY FORCES/FRIENDLY FORCES Though hard to assess accurately , there are estimated to be up to 7,000 active [MISC Taliban  ] fighters across the south . 
This compares with 4,300 [ORG ANA  ] , over 7,000 [ORG ANP  ] ( on paper ; in practice far fewer present for duty and effective ) and about 9,000 [ORG ISAF  ] personnel in [ORG Regional Command South  ] . 
Lack of capacity , including protected mobility and firepower , hinders [ORG ANSF  ] ability to conduct offensive operations against the enemy . 
Corruption , poor leadership and misuse of police resources remain widespread . 
Work continues to address these issues and to improve the sometimes poor co-ordination between provincial authorities , [ORG ANSF  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] . 
In the weeks following transfer of authority , [ORG ISAF  ] will continue to demonstrate to local officials and the people its will and ability to conduct robust and effective security operations across the region . 
Current and forthcoming [ORG ISAF  ] operations to relieve units in place ( ongoing for [MISC Canadian  ] , [MISC Romanian  ] and [ORG Dutch Forces  ] , September for [ORG UK Forces  ] ) will have a short-term impact on their combat capability . 
CONCLUSION Our aim must be to prevent the [MISC Taliban  ] achieving their objectives in any forthcoming offensive while positioning ourselves to take the initiative and provide effective security in support of development and governance . 
The current lack of maneuver capability hinders [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG ANSF  ] ability to threaten the enemy in their strongholds . 
We need to wrest the initiative from the enemy . 
I believe the [ORG Development Zone Concept  ] , which the [ORG Security Operations Group  ] and the other inter-Agency Groups have helped to develop , has the potential to play an important role in helping us do so . 
I will now give the floor to LTG Richards to describe the status of his work .
