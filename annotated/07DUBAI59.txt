( C ) Summary: In a January 23 meeting in [LOC Dubai  ] with [PER U/S Burns  ] , UAE Vice President , Prime Minister and [LOC Dubai  ] Ruler Sheikh [PER Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum  ] ( [ORG MbR  ] ) expressed concern about the potential negative impact on [LOC Dubai  ] of possible future [ORG UN  ] sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] ; he urged the quiet [MISC US-UAE  ] cooperation on financial and export control restrictions against [LOC Iran  ] , offering to set up a " joint committee " to this end . 
He agreed that [LOC Iran  ] should not have nuclear weapons , but warned of the dire regional consequences of military action .

He emphasized the importance of continued support for the [ORG Siniora  ] government in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and the high priority the [LOC US  ] put on a renewed effort to move the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] toward peace . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] raised the case of [ORG Amcit Vafa Valapour  ] , which has been under criminal investigation in [LOC Dubai  ] for nearly 16 months without charges before a court ( although under the local system police charges have been filed ) ; [ORG MbR  ] asked his aides to ensure the case moved forward as rapidly and transparently as possible End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) On January 23 , U/S for [ORG Political Affairs  ] [PER Nicholas Burns  ] met with [ORG MbR  ] for one hour in [ORG MbR  ] 's downtown office . 
[PER Burns  ] was accompanied by [ORG NEA  ] PDAS [PER Jim Jeffrey  ] , the Ambassador , the Consul General , P Staff assistant [PER Herro Mustafa  ] and [PER ConGen  ] notetaker . 
[ORG MbR  ] was accompanied by his sons Sheikh [PER Hamdan  ] ( who chairs the [ORG Dubai Executive Council  ] , the [ORG Emirate  ] 's governing body ) and Sheikh Mayed ; Minister for [ORG Cabinet Affairs  ] ( and [ORG Dubai Holdings  ] head ) [PER Mohammed Gergawi  ] ; federal Minister for Education Dr. [PER Hanif al Qasimi  ] ; [ORG Dubai General Security Service  ] head [PER Brigadier Mohammed al Qemzi  ] ; [ORG Dubai World  ] head [PER Sultan  ] bin [PER Sulayem  ] ; and [ORG Emirates Airlines  ] chairman and [ORG Dubai Civil Aviation  ] head Sheikh [PER Ahmed  ] bin [MISC Sayed  ] al [PER Maktoum  ] . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] expressed admiration for the [LOC Dubai  ] 's rapid development , hailing it as an open and productive model that was now being emulated throughout the region . 
3 . 
( C ) Lebanon: [PER U/S Burns  ] conveyed the gratitude of the [MISC Lebanese  ] government for financial and other assistance from the [LOC UAE  ] . 
[ORG MbR  ] said the [LOC UAE  ] understands that the [ORG Siniora  ] government needs regional support . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] urged continued assistance , noting the [LOC US  ] will soon offer the [ORG Siniora  ] government $1 billion for security and reconstruction efforts . 
4 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] sanctions: [PER U/S Burns  ] highlighted the significance of the June 2006 international offer to negotiate with [LOC Iran  ] to resolve the nuclear issue--the first official [LOC US  ] offer to negotiate with [LOC Tehran  ] in 27 years . 
[LOC Tehran  ] had rejected this broadly-supported , reasonable proposal , which offered economic incentives such as sanctions relief and the sale of civilian airliners in addition to negotiations . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] said that the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 's limited sanctions were a first step to pressure [LOC Iran  ] to compromise , but that absent [MISC Iranian  ] movement another , more restrictive , sanctions resolution is likely in February . 
The [LOC US  ] was also taking bilateral action through [ORG Treasury  ] designations against [MISC Iranian  ] banks that were funding terrorism . 
5 . 
( C ) [ORG MbR  ] expressed willingness to cooperate in financial restrictions against [LOC Iran  ] , but urged that the cooperation be conducted quietly ; he offered to set up a " joint committee " to do so ( he did not offer details ) ; he later repeated this offer with regard to military transfers ( see para 8 ) . 
He voiced concern regarding the potential negative impact of economic sanctions on [LOC Dubai  ] , and against the " good [MISC Iranians  ] " -- including [LOC Dubai  ] 's estimated 350,000 [MISC Iranians  ] residents . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] and Ambassador [PER Sison  ] expressed readiness to engage with [LOC Dubai  ] on financial cooperation against [LOC Iran  ] . 
( Note: the number of resident [MISC Iranians  ] was supplied by [PER Al Qemzi  ] , and is higher that the 200-300 thousand usual cited by the [LOC Dubai  ] officials . 
) 6 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Gulf Security:  ] U/S [PER Burns  ] stated that the [LOC US  ] will protect its interests and support its allies , like the [LOC UAE  ] , in the face of [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to dominate the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
This is why we have stationed a second carrier battle group there , and have detained [MISC Iranian  ] agents in [LOC Iraq  ] who were providing arms and bomb components used to kill [LOC US  ] troops . 
[ORG MbR  ] stated that the [LOC UAE  ] does not want [LOC Iran  ] to have nuclear weapons , and urged continued international pressure on [LOC Iran  ] , but expressed deep concern about the destabilizing consequences to the [LOC UAE  ] and to region of a military strike . 
He urged that the [LOC US  ] find a way to stop or disarm [LOC Iran  ] without using military force . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] reiterated [LOC DUBAI  ] 00000059 002.2 OF 002 that the [LOC US  ] wants a diplomatic solution , and is working with the [ORG UN  ] and its allies toward this end ; strong [LOC UAE  ] support was important to this effort . 
7 . 
( C ) [ORG MbR  ] expressed hope for change inside [LOC Iran  ] , which [PER U/S Burns  ] echoed . 
[PER Burns  ] noted the [LOC US  ] wants to support the influence of moderate [MISC Iranians  ] and encourage [LOC Iran  ] to engage in negotiations . 
Minister [PER Gergawi  ] mentioned rumors that Supreme leader [PER Khamenei  ] is suffering from prostate cancer . 
[PER Gergawi  ] opined that the merchant class in [LOC Iran  ] has been pressuring [PER Ahmadinejad  ] over his failing economic policy . 
He asserted that the growing sectarian conflict in [LOC Iraq  ] , as well as the hanging of [PER Saddam Hussein  ] ( which , he implied , was inspired by [MISC Iranian  ] pressure ) , have now undermined the possibility of a regional alliance between extremist [MISC Sunnis  ] and [ORG Shia  ] . 
Regional [MISC Sunnis  ] now blame [LOC Iran  ] for instability in [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
( Note: [PER Gergawi  ] 's family is of [MISC Iranian  ] origin , and he acts as one of [ORG MbR  ] 's principal advisors on [LOC Iran  ] . 
) 8 . 
( C ) Security cooperation: [PER U/S Burns  ] called the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] a good forum for quiet security cooperation , and reiterated that the [LOC US  ] seeks a close , productive dialogue with the [LOC UAE  ] on [LOC Gulf  ] security . 
The [LOC US  ] opposes arms sales to [LOC Iran  ] and will urge its partners in the [ORG European Union  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] to cooperate on this front . 
[ORG MbR  ] reiterated his offer to set up a committee to cooperate on these issues . 
9 . 
( C ) Israel/Palestinians: [PER U/S Burns  ] stressed that the [LOC US  ] believes progress between [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] toward peace is central to regional stability , and supports the creation of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state . 
This would be " the best thing , " [ORG MbR  ] replied ; a peace deal would make radical groups like [ORG HAMAS  ] " everyone 's enemy " . 
[MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] should be supported , particularly since [ORG HAMAS  ] is funded by [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG MbR  ] noted [LOC UAE  ] assistance was again flowing to the [MISC Palestinians  ] , although it had been suspended for a time because of corruption concerns . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] said the [LOC US  ] is careful to ensure its assistance is going to the [MISC Palestinian  ] people , rather than the [ORG HAMAS  ] government , and is confident in the assistance mechanisms now in place . 
10 . 
( C ) [ORG Valapour  ] case: [PER U/S Burns  ] raised the case of [ORG Amcit Vafa Valapour  ] , who has been under criminal investigation in [LOC Dubai  ] for nearly 16 months . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] said the [LOC US  ] sought return of [ORG Valapour  ] 's passport , which has been held by the [LOC Dubai  ] police . 
He underscored that , while he was taking no substantive position on the merits of the case , the [LOC US  ] believes the case should move forward with due process as quickly as possible . 
[ORG MbR  ] was unfamiliar with the case , and turned to [PER Gergawi  ] for background . 
[PER Gergawi  ] outlined the [LOC Dubai  ] government view of the case , saying the bottom line is that [ORG Valapour  ] and his non-USC partners had profited from insider information in a deal on the [ORG Dubai Metro  ] project with a corrupt [LOC Dubai  ] official . 
" We don't tolerate corruption , " [PER Gergawi  ] concluded . 
The [ORG Consul General  ] noted that he had recently met with the [ORG Dubai Attorney General  ] ( reftel ) on the case . 
The AG had agreed to meet with [ORG Valapour  ] 's [LOC US  ] and [LOC Emirati  ] representatives to help to resolve the issue . 
[ORG MbR  ] asked his aides to ensure the case moved forward as quickly and transparently as possible , and promised [ORG Valapour  ] would receive fair treatment . 
11 . 
( C ) Afghanistan: [PER U/S Burns  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC UAE  ] assistance in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and urged support for the [PER Karzai  ] government . 
[ORG MbR  ] asserted the [LOC UAE  ] and [LOC US  ] are partners against drugs , money laundering , and terrorism and in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said the best weapon against the [ORG Taliban  ] was economic investment . 
[PER U/S Burns  ] outlined ongoing reconstruction efforts , and noted the difficulty of creating economically viable substitutes for drug crops . 
[ORG MbR  ] said [PER Karzai  ] is reluctant to tackle the drug issue because he fears decreased support in the provinces . 
12 . 
( C ) Comment: [ORG MbR  ] offered little new , other than his somewhat vague offer to create a bilateral committee to address financial and arms/technology flows to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He is clearly concerned regarding the prospect of more comprehensive [ORG UN  ] economic sanctions , given that [LOC Iran  ] is [LOC Dubai  ] 's largest trading partner , an assertion often cited by [LOC Dubai  ] officials ( although good Dubai/Iran trade numbers are hard to come by ) . 
We will follow up to try to get a better read on the scope of [ORG MbR  ] 's offer .
