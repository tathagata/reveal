08 [ORG TUNIS  ] 1137 AND PREVIOUS Classified By: Ambassador [PER Robert F. Godec  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) A senior [ORG MFA  ] official convoked the [MISC German  ] , [MISC Italian  ] and [ORG Spanish Chiefs of Mission  ] June 19 to inform them the [ORG GOT  ] wants the [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees in [LOC Guantanamo Camp  ] returned home . 
According to the [MISC European  ] [ORG COMs  ] , the implicit message was that their governments should not accept the [LOC US  ] request to take [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees . 
The [ORG COMs  ] have informed their capitals , but have no response yet . 
In a meeting June 22 , a small group of Ambassadors ( including the [MISC German  ] and [MISC Italian  ] [ORG COMs  ] ) discussed the [ORG MFA  ] demarches . 
Among the Ambassadors , views differed on the risks to [MISC Tunisian  ] prisoners , but some said there is a possibility of torture or mistreatment for anyone accused of terrorism . 
End Summary. ------------------- EUROPEANS DEMARCHED ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Following FM [ORG Abdallah  ] 's meeting on [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees with Ambassador [PER Godec  ] on June 18 ( Ref A ) , the [ORG MFA  ] convoked [MISC German  ] Ambassador [PER Horst-Wolfram Kerll  ] , [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador [PER Antonio D'Andria  ] and [ORG Spanish Charge Santiago Miralles  ] Huete to separate meetings on June 19. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In the meetings , [ORG MFA  ] Secretary of State for [LOC Maghreb  ] , [LOC Arab  ] and [ORG African Affairs Abdelhafidh  ] Hergeum delivered a demarche similar to that given to Ambassador [PER Godec  ] , specifically: -- [LOC Tunisia  ] wants its citizens in [LOC Guantanamo  ] returned , -- [LOC Tunisia  ] does not torture and has signed the [MISC Convention Against Torture  ] , -- [LOC Tunisia  ] 's image would suffer if the detainees were sent to other countries . 
The implicit message from [LOC Hergeum  ] , according to the [MISC European  ] [ORG COMs  ] , was that their countries should not agree to the [LOC US  ] request to accept [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees . 
The three officials have informed their capitals but have no response . 
According to the [MISC German  ] Ambassador , the [MISC Tunisian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Berlin  ] has delivered the same demarche to the [MISC German  ] MFA. ------------------- AMBASSADORS' MEETING ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) On June 22 , Ambassador discussed the [ORG GOT  ] demarche with Ambassador [PER Kerll  ] , Ambassador [PER D'Andria  ] , [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Chris O'Connor  ] , [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Serge Degallaix  ] , and [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador [PER Bruno Picard  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Godec  ] reviewed the Foreign Minister 's demarche with the [MISC German  ] and [MISC Italian  ] Ambassadors then detailing the demarches they had received. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador noted the [ORG GOT  ] has offered , as evidence that it does not torture , the case of Imam Said [PER Jaziri  ] who was repatriated from [LOC Canada  ] to [LOC Tunisia  ] despite allegations that he would be mistreated . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador said the comparison between [PER Jaziri  ] and the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees is " crap " , explaining that [PER Jaziri  ] was a petty criminal and not accused of terrorism . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] government reviewed [PER Jaziri  ] 's case carefully and decided he could be transferred since he did have links with terrorism . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] decision , [PER Picard  ] suggested , might well have been otherwise if [PER Jaziri  ] had been accused of terrorism. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador said [LOC Italy  ] had had few problems with individuals they had transferred to [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
The [MISC Italians  ] have been in contact with their families and lawyers and have not heard any serious complaints . 
Why , he asked , would the [ORG GOT  ] want to mistreat or torture transferred [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees ? <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Godec  ] noted that there are credible reports of one of the first two transferees being mistreated , including information from the lawyer , the family and statements in open court . 
Moreover , there are credible reports of [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] officials mistreating detainees and prisoners in other cases . 
He added that contrary to [ORG GOT  ] claims , the [ORG ICRC  ] cannot visit all [MISC Tunisian  ] prisons as it does not have access to non-notified MOI facilities . 
The [LOC UK  ] Ambassador opined that the [ORG GOT  ] uses torture as a form of punishment. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador said the [ORG GOT  ] 's statements that it does not torture are " bullshit . 
" The [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador ( protect ) said he had direct , first hand evidence of torture/mistreatment of a prisoner that lasted several months . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] and [MISC German  ] Ambassadors agreed that anyone in [MISC Tunisian  ] prisons on terrorism charges is at risk of mistreatment or torture. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The Ambassadors concluded the discussion with several noting that [MISC Tunisian  ] diplomatic assurances regarding appropriate treatment of prisoners is of value , but that a follow-up mechanism is required to ensure commitments are kept. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOT  ] clearly and strongly wants the [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees in [LOC Guantanamo  ] returned home . 
As we suggested in Ref A , [LOC Washington  ] agencies may wish to consider whether to offer to return the [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees if the [ORG GOT  ] agrees to permit [LOC US  ] access to the first two transferees and ongoing access to any future transferees . 
Such an understanding would need to include a mechanism to address the problems that may arise . 
While there is no absolute guarantee against mistreatment , such an understanding would provide transferees additional protection . 
Whether the [ORG GOT  ] would accept such an arrangement is another matter . 
We are not optimistic , but it is worth considering . 
If [LOC Washington  ] decides to continue with efforts to transfer the [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees to third countries , we need to officially inform the [ORG GOT  ] at a high-level and soon .
