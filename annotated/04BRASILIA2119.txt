( B ) 03 [ORG USDAO BRASILIA IIR  ] 6 809 0235 03 Classified By: DepPolCouns [PER Lawrence Cohen  ] , reason 1.4 ( d ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Amazon Surveillance System  ] ( [ORG SIVAM  ] ) and [ORG Amazon Protection System  ] ( [ORG SIPAM  ] ) continue to show progress and increased operational capabilities . 
[ORG SIVAM  ] 's data collection infrastructure is almost complete ; [ORG SIPAM  ] continues to create new map products for use by government and non-governmental organizations . 
However , even with [ORG SIVAM  ] fully in place , many aircraft will still be able to avoid detection by flying below radar patterns and look-down radar on airborne platforms will not have continuous coverage . 
To provide a seamless radar picture over its frontiers , [LOC Brazil  ] is actively seeking cooperative arrangements with neighboring countries . 
Ultimately , both [ORG SIVAM  ] and [ORG SIPAM  ] will only be as effective as the [ORG GOB  ] 's efforts to utilize the information generated , whether to control [MISC Brazilian  ] airspace or to protect the environment . 
End Summary BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Emboffs accompanying [ORG CAPSTONE National Defense University  ] ( [ORG NDU  ] ) team to [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Amazon Surveillance System  ] ( [ORG SIVAM  ] ) and [ORG Amazon Protection System  ] ( [ORG SIPAM  ] ) regional centers in [LOC Manaus  ] received in-depth briefing on the current status of the two co-located facilities from [ORG Air Force Brigadier General  ] [PER Alvaro Luiz Pinheiro  ] , Vice President of the [ORG Commission  ] for Implementation of [ORG Air Space Control  ] ( [ORG CISCEA  ] ) and the [ORG Coordinating Commission  ] for the [ORG Amazon Surveillance System  ] ( [ORG CCSIVAM  ] ) . 
[ORG SIVAM  ] Commandant Colonel Scariot and [ORG SIPAM  ] regional chief Engineer Captain [PER Luciano also  ] participated in the August 10 visit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Amazon Surveillance System  ] ( [ORG SIVAM  ] ) is an integrated data collection project that utilizes a wide variety of data acquisition tools throughout the [LOC Amazon  ] basin 's 5.2 million square kilometers . 
Developed by [ORG Raytheon  ] and [ORG ATECH Technologies  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] ) , the multi-layered system includes aerial surveillance , transportable ground based and meteorological radars , airborne remote sensing and surveillance platforms ( [ORG Embraer  ] R99-A and [MISC R99-B  ] aircraft ) , environmental and river sensors , weather ground stations , lightning detectors , surveillance and meteorological satellite observation , and even spot submissions from individual informants . 
Using the extensive raw data collected by [ORG SIVAM  ] , the [ORG Amazon Protection System  ] ( [ORG SIPAM  ] ) integrates , evaluates , and disseminates the information into packages for distribution to end-user [MISC Brazilian  ] agencies and non-governmental organizations . 
To complete the [ORG SIPAM  ] information network , end-user terminals are being placed in each of the [LOC Amazon  ] region 's 257 municipalities with over 10,000 inhabitants. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Almost all of [ORG SIVAM  ] 's multi-layered data collection mechanisms are up and running ; only a few of the facility 's information collection and observation components are still not fully functional . 
In coordination with [ORG SIPAM  ] which provides integrated data analysis , a detailed geographic information system ( GIS ) portrait of the [LOC Amazon  ] basin is emerging rapidly . 
Increasingly , the data and data-created products are being shared in real time with appropriate military and civilian endusers . 
The air traffic control component of the [ORG Amazon Region Air Traffic Control and Integrated Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG CINDACTA  ] IV ) is showing progress . 
The next stage in [ORG SIVAM/SIPAM  ] development , resulting in greater control of [MISC Brazilian  ] airspace and protection and sustainable development of the [LOC Amazon  ] , will rely on improved coordination among government and non-government entities . 
[ORG Air Defense and Control  ] by 2005 ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Utilizing [ORG SIVAM  ] data , the [ORG Air Traffic Control and Integrated Air Defense System  ] for the [LOC Amazon  ] ( [ORG CINDACTA  ] IV ) , a component of [LOC Brazil  ] 's national [ORG Air Defense  ] and [ORG Air Traffic Control System  ] ( [ORG SISDACTA  ] ) , should be fully operational by early 2005 . 
( Note: [LOC Brazil  ] 's other regional [ORG ATC  ] and air defense systems , [ORG CINDACTA  ] I , II , and III are already operational . 
End Note ) Two transportable 3D radars are not yet operational ; other systems , including VHF radio , should be completed within a few months . 
To identify unauthorized aircraft and airspace incursions from neighboring countries , air-air , air-ground , and spot ( look-down ) SAR airborne sensors onboard the system 's three [MISC R99-B  ] aircraft provide high resolution imaging and surface information that in combination with surface radar systems , and when the [MISC R99-B  ] aircraft are aloft , provides complete vertical airspace coverage . 
Low-flying intruding aircraft , however , can avoid radar detection over much of the [LOC Amazon  ] when the surveillance planes are grounded or unavailable in the particular region . 
( Note: Given the costs associated with keeping the three [MISC R99-Bs  ] aloft , the planes at present will be utilized only when and where collaborating information suggests airspace incursions are occurring or will occur at a given date and time . 
End note ) [PER Pinheiro  ] indicated that during [ORG CINDACTA  ] IV 's short lifespan to date , it has monitored a 30 percent increase in regional air traffic -- a result of increased air traffic communications between pilots and [ORG ATC  ] stations rather than an increase in flights . 
" When pilots know they are being monitored , they are more prone to acknowledge their presence and file a flight plan , " he observed . 
[ORG Hand Across the Borders  ] ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro  ] believed full air defense and traffic control ( [ORG ATC  ] ) throughout the [LOC Amazon  ] will be achieved by June 2005 ; key to this achievement , he noted , will be [ORG ATC  ] coordination and integration with [LOC Brazil  ] 's neighbors . 
In previous discussions with mission personnel , the [ORG GOB  ] had indicated its desire to enter into [ORG SIVAM  ] cost-sharing arrangements over [ORG ATC  ] data . 
[PER Pinheiro  ] was certain that [LOC Brazil  ] no longer sought cost reimbursement from other governments . 
Instead , [LOC Brazil  ] 's current objective is the creation of a seamless radar overlap with all its neighbors extending 50 miles on each side of [LOC Brazil  ] 's borders . 
Each regional [ORG CINDACTA  ] , [PER Pinheiro  ] explained , has been given the go ahead by [LOC Brasilia  ] to develop local data sharing mechanisms with neighboring countries . 
( Note: Mission has not yet been able to confirm with other [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] sources whether regional CINDACTAs are , in fact , tasked to develop transborder data sharing mechanisms . 
End note ) With [LOC Peru  ] , for example , since both [ORG Ministries of Defense  ] had agreed to terms of reference for real time data sharing , [PER Pinheiro  ] affirmed that [ORG CINDACTA  ] IV and its [MISC Peruvian  ] counterpart were in the process of establishing close border radar overlap capability . 
[LOC Colombia  ] , he said , wanted to do the same , although the [ORG GOC  ] 's desire to obtain data for [MISC Brazilian  ] airspace beyond the 50 mile border zone , he noted , was a " non-starter . 
" [LOC Brazil  ] already works closely with [LOC Colombia  ] on information sharing , and both [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC French Guiana  ] have expressed interest in developing joint [ORG ATC  ] operations . 
While [LOC Bolivia  ] does not have its own operating sensors , [PER Pinheiro  ] added , [LOC Brazil  ] is considering provision of surplus radar units as it upgrades its own radars. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Pinheiro  ] and Scariot opined that when fully operational , the coordinated [ORG CINDACTA  ] IV [ORG ATC  ] system , in conjunction with implementation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Lei de Abate  ] ( " [MISC Shootdown  ] " Law ) in October , would be sufficient in dissuading airborne narcotrafficking in the [LOC Amazon  ] " without recourse to actually shooting any aircraft from the sky . 
" [PER Pinheiro  ] added that the [ORG SIVAM  ] observation platform will also serve to deny the use of illicit airfields which can now be more easily located and targeted for action . 
[ORG SIVAM Products  ] -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) As a data collection system [ORG SIVAM  ] generates a range of products for use by the [ORG Amazon Protection System  ] ( [ORG SIPAM  ] ) or other end-users . 
Among the raw products promoted by the [ORG SIVAM Coordinating Commission  ] ( [ORG CCSIVAM  ] ) are: - [ORG Meteorological: Satellite  ] images , real-time meteorological situation maps , historical and current climate study statistics , weather forecasts for airports , and accumulated precipitation and lightning reports ; - [ORG Electromagnetic Surveillance:  ] Emission contact and map data and communications networks ; - Environmental: Groundcover maps and general reports , land use and environmental impact maps , soil damage maps , fauna and habitat classification maps , deforestation maps and fire incidence reports , mercury contamination reports , local and regional CO2 and O3 concentrations , statistical reports on greenhouse gas data , pollution threats to human populations , water quality and hydrographic maps , flood prevention and flood forecasting reports , urbanization impact maps and statistical reports , and epidemiological studies ; - [ORG Territorial Surveillance:  ] Real-time airborne and surface vehicle movement and trajectories , identified target maps , border violation maps , irregular cultivation maps , biodiversity extraction and illicit mining maps , geologic maps , and locations of detected ( irregular and perhaps illicit ) rest-stops . 
[ORG SIPAM  ] and its Activities ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Past visits by mission personnel to the co-located [ORG SIVAM/SIPAM  ] complex in [LOC Manaus  ] suggested a clear dichotomy between the two entities . 
While the two entities remain separate with [ORG SIVAM  ] providing the raw data to [ORG SIPAM  ] , the separation may be less distinct than before . 
Moreover , bureaucratic concerns about allowing uniformed visitors into [ORG SIPAM  ] may be lessening . 
During the [MISC CAPSTONE/NDU  ] visit , [ORG SIPAM  ] regional chief Captain [PER Luciano  ] welcomed the opportunity to display his center 's sophisticated GIS capabilities . 
For example , he demonstrated how [ORG SIPAM  ] 's environmental analysis unit incorporates [ORG SIVAM  ] data into usable tools ( e.g. maps of deforestation trends , forest fire monitoring , land use maps ) for [ORG GOB  ] entities such as the [ORG Ministry of Environment  ] . 
The meteorological cell which has grown dramatically in just a few months , would soon be going to a 24/7 operation schedule , [PER Luciano  ] said . 
In addition to direct links with [ORG GOB  ] agencies , workspace within [ORG SIPAM  ] is being provided to [ORG NGOs  ] engaged in [LOC Amazon  ] field work . 
[PER Luciano  ] acknowledged that with [ORG SIPAM  ] 's rapid development of new data tools , data storage is becoming an increasing challenge. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [PER Luciano  ] expressed pride in the progress the [ORG Amazon Protection System  ] has made in recent months and highlighted [ORG SIPAM  ] 's key focus areas: - Environmental protection ; - Land use supervision and control ; - Border surveillance and control ; - Prevention and control of epidemics ; - Civil defense activities ; - Identification of punishable illegal activities ; - Protection of indigenous populations and their land ; - Air traffic control and surveillance ; - Support for sustainable development ; - Weather forecasting ; and - Climate studies . 
11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: While [ORG SIVAM  ] and [ORG SIPAM  ] continue to show noteworthy progress , the ultimate success of these programs will be measured if/when/to what extent [MISC Brazilian  ] agencies and [ORG NGOs  ] utilize the new information tools provided . 
Ultimately , more rigorous environmental protection , sustainable development of the [LOC Amazon  ] , and greater surveillance of [MISC Brazilian  ] airspace leading to reduced narcotrafficking will be [ORG SIVAM/SIPAM  ] 's most important achievements .
