SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Department requests that addressee embassies demarche host governments requesting that they urge [LOC Iceland  ] to keep its mobile patrol team in [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] beyond April 2007 . 
Please report host government reaction by February 20 . 
End summary and action request . 
GOAL ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] 's ultimate goal is to convince the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] ( [ORG GOI  ] ) to reverse its decision to withdraw its mobile patrol team of civilian peacekeepers from [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] in April 2007 . 
To that end , we seek to enlist the other countries whose forces make up [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] ( [LOC Lithuania  ] , [LOC Croatia  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] ) as well as [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Canada  ] and the [LOC UK  ] in demarching [LOC Iceland  ] . 
We would expect the three governments contributing forces to the [ORG PRT  ] to be receptive to this idea , as [ORG PRT  ] leaders are very concerned about losing the unique capabilities their [MISC Icelandic  ] colleagues bring to their operations . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] has an obvious stake in the effectiveness of the [ORG PRT  ] . 
[LOC Canada  ] and the [LOC UK  ] would also be useful and credible voices in the demarche , both because of their own major contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and because [LOC Iceland  ] seeks increased defense and security cooperation with them ( and with [LOC Denmark  ] ) in the wake of the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] forces from [LOC Iceland  ] this year . 
[ORG Embassy Reykjavik  ] has already informally raised this issue with the [ORG GOI  ] . 
Following demarches by the [ORG PRT  ] members and others , Department expects to ask [ORG Embassy Reykjavik  ] to present a more formal demarche to reinforce the message . 
BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [ORG GOI  ] intends to withdraw the [MISC Icelandic  ] mobile patrol team ( [ORG Mobile Liaison Observation Team/MLOT  ] ) from [LOC Afghanistan  ] at the end of April 2007 ( Ref A ) . 
This decision reflects an effort by the [ORG GOI  ] , which has no military , to steer its peacekeeping contributions away from activities that are controversial with the [MISC Icelandic  ] public , particularly from roles where [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers are armed or wear military-type uniforms ( Ref B ) . 
Posts may draw from the following background information in requesting host governments to demarche the [MISC GOI:  ] --The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] intends to withdraw its civilian peacekeeping personnel from the [MISC Lithuania-led  ] [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Chaghcharan  ] in April 2007 . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's contribution to the [ORG PRT  ] currently consists of a [ORG Mobile Liaison Observation Team  ] ( [ORG MLOT  ] ) totaling 13 persons . 
The withdrawal of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] would be a serious loss for the [MISC PRT.  ] --Because of its make-up , special equipment , and experience driving in the kind of harsh terrain found in [ORG Ghor Province  ] , the [MISC Icelandic  ] team has been especially effective in conducting patrols . 
Moreover , through its reliability , efforts to pass on skills to other patrol units , and unique rescue capability , the [PER Icelanders  ] have made the [ORG PRT  ] as a whole much more effective. --The [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] is unique in the resources and skills it brings to its designated patrols in [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] . 
A major problem for all the other patrols is lack of experience at driving in the harsh mountain conditions of [LOC Ghor Province  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] team is used to off-road driving up steep inclines and fording rivers - including at night . 
The [PER Icelanders  ] , and only the [PER Icelanders  ] , have truly all-weather vehicles ( [PER Nissan Patrols  ] ) and the appropriate tires for handling the extremely rough and mountainous terrain of often snow-bound [LOC Ghor  ] province ( there are no paved roads ) . --The makeup of the [MISC Icelandic  ] team of civilian specialists -- two counter-terrorism policemen , a search and rescue worker , skilled drivers , a paramedic , and a mechanic ( who participates in the patrols ) - has resulted in remarkable reliability for the team 's missions , and particularly valuable and insightful reporting . 
Even if [LOC Iceland  ] were to turn over its vehicles to other [ORG PRT  ] elements at the end of April , it would waste much of the major investment [LOC Iceland  ] has made in bringing the vehicles to [LOC Afghanistan  ] because , without the corresponding special driving skills and ride-along mechanic , the vehicles would soon become as vulnerable to problems as the rest of the [ORG PRT  ] 's vehicle fleet. --Beyond the value they add through their own patrols , the [PER Icelanders  ] contribute by making every effort to pass on to the other elements their special driving skills . 
Moreover , this winter the [PER Icelanders  ] have already had occasion to rescue other units' stranded vehicles , and they have been paired up with other units as a safeguard. --We understand that the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government 's policy on peacekeeping , as stated by Foreign Minister [PER Sverrisdottir October  ] 19 , is to take on purely civilian missions where [LOC Iceland  ] has particular niche capabilities to contribute , while gradually increasing the number of peacekeepers deployed overseas at any one time . 
Although the [MISC Icelandic  ] team 's mission in [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] involves real danger and close cooperation with military forces , it is still a civilian mission and a perfect example of an [MISC Icelandic  ] niche capability . 
The team 's rules of engagement do not allow it to participate in combat except in self-defense , its members are not part of the [ORG PRT  ] 's quick response force , and they do not perform guard duty. --The core mission of [LOC PRT Chaghcharan  ] is performing patrols , and the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MLOT  ] does this uniquely well and makes an all-but-irreplaceable contribution to enabling the other elements to perform their roles effectively . 
The team 's withdrawal just a couple of months from now would be a serious loss to the [ORG PRT  ] . 
We urge you to join us in approaching the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] , asking that it reconsider this decision .
