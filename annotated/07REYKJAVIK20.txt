( C ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] is supportive of [ORG USG  ] goals for the [ORG NATO  ] informal ministerial on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] on January 26 . 
The [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) Permanent Secretary outlined for Ambassador the [MISC Icelandic  ] government 's plans to increase peacekeeping deployments to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including discussions with [LOC Hungary  ] on PRT deployments . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is also considering contributions to law and order and counter-narcotics programs , and at the ministerial will confirm the Prime Minister 's [LOC Riga  ] pledge of [ORG NATO  ] airlift funding . 
Ambassador also explored ways to raise public awareness of [LOC Iceland  ] 's contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including the idea of a visit to the country by the Prime Minister after parliamentary elections here in May . 
On [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] intends to support the [PER Ahtisaari  ] plan but will wait until an opportune time to say so publicly . 
The [ORG MFA  ] expects that a [ORG Nordic-Baltic Political Directors'  ] meeting in February will result in a consensus to support the plan . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the Foreign Minister 's absence , Ambassador called on [ORG MFA  ] Permanent Secretary [PER Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] on January 22 to present [ORG USG  ] thoughts ahead of the [ORG NATO  ] informal ministerial later this week . 
Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] , who will represent [LOC Iceland  ] , is traveling in [LOC Europe  ] ahead of the meeting. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding [LOC Afghanistan  ] , Ambassador thanked [PER Sigurdsson  ] for [LOC Iceland  ] 's contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , particularly the well-regarded [ORG Mobile Liaison Observation Team  ] assigned to the [MISC Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] in [LOC Chaghcharan  ] ( ref E ) . 
At the same time , she noted that the pressure is on for [ORG NATO  ] to deliver this spring , and that all Allies must take a hard look at what more they can offer . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] said it was good to hear that the [MISC Icelandic  ] team is appreciated and noted that despite the team 's planned withdrawal in April 2007 , some personnel currently assigned to the PRT will remain there in other roles . 
When the Ambassador suggested that [LOC Iceland  ] might find another niche for itself in pairing up with [ORG NATO  ] members who were to lead their first PRTs , the [MISC PermSec  ] agreed , noting that [LOC Iceland  ] has just begun discussions with [LOC Hungary  ] on possible cooperation in a [MISC Hungarian-led  ] PRT , with two specific projects ( one of which centers on police training ) under discussion. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sigurdsson  ] passed Ambassador a copy of his talking points on [LOC Afghanistan  ] for recent bilateral security talks in the [LOC UK  ] , noting that the document gave a good preview of what FM [PER Sverrisdottir  ] would have to present in [LOC Brussels  ] this week . 
The document ( scanned and emailed to EUR/NB ) outlines a planned increase of the total number of Icelanders deployed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , though as [PER Sigurdsson  ] noted their roles will shift to areas in which [LOC Iceland  ] believes it has a " core competency . 
" ( [ORG Note:  ] it also confirms Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] 's pledge at [LOC Riga  ] to fund airlift of personnel and supplies . 
End Note . 
) [PER Sigurdsson  ] offered that this was in line with the FM 's emphasis on shaping [LOC Iceland  ] 's peacekeeping participation in ways that would be able to be clearly understood and supported across [LOC Iceland  ] 's political spectrum ( ref F ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador expressed appreciation for [LOC Iceland  ] 's continued engagement and plans for increased support to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , though she cautioned that even " safe-sounding " roles such as midwife training can be dangerous peacekeeping assignments . 
It could send misleading signals to lead the public to believe that peacekeeping deployments in unstable regions did not involve risk simply because [MISC Icelandic  ] participants did not wear uniforms or were unarmed . 
She urged the government to explain clearly to the parliament and the public why these missions were important to do despite acknowledged danger . 
Continuing this theme , Ambassador suggested that the period following [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) elections this May might be an excellent time for the Prime Minister ( [PER Haarde  ] or his successor ) to visit [LOC Afghanistan  ] to show support for [LOC Iceland  ] 's work there and raise public awareness of the importance of [LOC Iceland  ] 's contribution to [MISC Afghan  ] development and stability . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] enthusiastically agreed , noting as well that it might go one better to send the [ORG Althingi  ] Foreign Affairs Committee , " which doesn't travel enough . 
" He noted that FM [PER Sverrisdottir  ] is making a concerted effort to engage the [ORG Althingi  ] on security and defense issues , including peacekeeping , in an effort to bury lingering resentment of the cabinet 's tendency to unilateral control of foreign affairs. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Along these lines , [PER Sigurdsson  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] should and will look to increase its participation in " traditional " PRT roles in the coming years , possibly even to include having Icelanders under arms . 
However , in the short term such deployments are not politically tenable . 
The only way the [ORG MFA  ] can elicit such support , he opined , is by moving carefully and bringing the [ORG Althingi  ] along at every step . 
Ambassador acknowledged this point , and pushed the [ORG MFA  ] to encourage as much press coverage and high-level attention on [LOC Iceland  ] and [ORG NATO  ] 's work in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as possible. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On [LOC Kosovo  ] , Ambassador noted the urgency of unified international support for [ORG UN Special  ] Representative [PER Ahtisaari  ] 's plan for final status . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] agreed , and said the [LOC U.S.  ] could expect [LOC Iceland  ] 's support for the plan when the timing was appropriate . 
[ORG MFA Political Director  ] [PER Bergdis Ellertsdottir  ] noted in this vein that she expected an upcoming [ORG Nordic-Baltic Political Directors'  ] meeting to produce a consensus of support for [PER Ahtisaari  ] . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] opined that perhaps the [ORG Enhanced Partnership in Northern Europe  ] ( e-Pine ) could be a vehicle for coordinating support to [LOC Kosovo.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Comment: The [ORG GOI  ] ( and FM [PER Sverrisdottir  ] in particular ) is still wrestling with the problem of selling [MISC Afghan  ] and other peacekeeping operations to a skeptical public unaccustomed to seeing its citizens in uniform or potentially at risk . 
Nonetheless , [LOC Iceland  ] will be supportive of [ORG NATO  ] 's goals in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and its willingness to explore PRT cooperation with the [MISC Hungarians  ] is a welcome sign. van Voorst</pre></code>
