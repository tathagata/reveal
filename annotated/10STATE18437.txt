END SUMMARY . 
Confident on UNHRC ; [PER Keen  ] on Educational Partnerships -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Pre-viewing Ambassador Ghafoor’s meetings with Deputy [PER S/SECC Pershing  ] and [ORG S/GC  ] Ambassador [PER Fried  ] , [ORG SCA A/S Robert Blake  ] expressed appreciation to [PER Ghafoor  ] for Maldives’s willingness to accept a [MISC Guantanamo  ] detainee , and President Nasheed’s strong personal effort in [LOC Copenhagen  ] to reach an Accord . 
[PER Blake  ] also pulsed [PER Ghafoor  ] on Maldives’s candidacy for the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] said he was confident [LOC Maldives  ] could get one of the four [ORG Asia Group  ] seats ; he did not think [LOC Iran  ] , lacking [MISC Arab  ] support , had the votes . 
His only concern was that [LOC Thailand  ] and [LOC Maldives  ] could split their votes and that [LOC Iran  ] is working [MISC African  ] capitals . 
As such , [LOC Maldives  ] is not only lobbying [MISC Asian  ] missions , but also [MISC African  ] missions . 
[PER Blake  ] offered quiet [LOC U.S.  ] assistance if it would be helpful ; [PER Ghafoor  ] appreciated it and said [LOC Maldives  ] might take us up on it . 
But [LOC Maldives  ] needed to be seen as earning the seat in its own right . 
As a small country , he said , [LOC Maldives  ] can’t play other countries against each other ; it needs to take principled positions ( e.g . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] recognition ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ghafoor  ] appreciated [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to help push the [ORG IMF  ] and [LOC Maldives  ] toward agreement , but that the conditionality was “harsh.” Wage cuts have been politically difficult . 
Referring to the March 28-29 [LOC Maldives  ] donors conference , [PER Ghafoor  ] said international assistance would help the government win over the public and implement its development program . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] said that promoting educational exchanges and partnerships between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Maldives  ] would offer an alternative to students who currently go to [MISC Islamic  ] schools in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] , where they could become radicalized . 
A/S [PER Blake  ] suggested [PER Ghafoor  ] reach out to [LOC U.S.  ] schools and offered assistance to help build public-private partnerships , such as , for example , a college in the hotel and restaurant management field . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] was also keen to pursue parliamentary exchanges and to receive CODELs in [LOC Maldives  ] , as well as to promote a [MISC U.S.-Maldives  ] caucus or friendship association in [ORG Congress  ] . 
We suggested he reach out to [ORG National Democratic Institute  ] and [ORG International Republican Institute  ] , and that we would help arrange meetings for him with [ORG Congressional  ] staff . 
Ready to Assist with Detainee ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG S/GC  ] Ambassador [PER Daniel Fried  ] conveyed [LOC U.S.  ] appreciation for Maldives’s willingness to resettle a STATE 00018437 002 OF 003 [MISC Guantanamo  ] detainee . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] said [LOC Maldives  ] is ready to act quickly on the resettlement . 
Logistics remain to be worked out between the [ORG Home Ministry  ] and the Embassy . 
[PER Fried  ] detailed those logistics , including finalizing transfer arrangements , concluding an exchange of diplomatic notes ( that would include security measures ) , and requiring [ORG GORM  ] permission to notify the candidate . 
[PER Fried  ] said we would keep the information close hold until we transferred the detainee ; noted the offer of $85,000 to assist his resettlement expenses ; and offered to make himself available for interviews should the [ORG GORM  ] want help shaping any press messaging . 
[PER Fried  ] stressed the importance of working out more detailed security arrangements for the detainee , along the lines of those applied in other countries that have accepted [MISC Guantanamo  ] detainees for resettlement ; Embassy [LOC Colombo  ] could work directly with the [MISC Maldivian  ] government on those arrangements . 
Climate Change: [LOC Maldives  ] Seeks Concrete Action --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with Deputy [PER S/SECC Jonathan Pershing  ] , [PER Ghafoor  ] referred to [LOC Copenhagen  ] as a stepping stone toward a legally binding agreement ; [LOC Maldives  ] is prepared to accept any form of treaty/accord that would lead to concrete action . 
He said he saw a reluctance within the [LOC United States  ] [ORG Congress  ] to take action . 
He would like [MISC Maldivian  ] President Nasheed to have the opportunity to speak before [ORG Congress  ] in order to provide a sincere voice for the urgency of climate change . 
[PER Pershing  ] asked if [PER Ghafoor  ] had a sense of why only 105 of 192 countries had associated themselves with the Accord . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] replied that , following the commitments of the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] at [LOC Copenhagen  ] , and despite opposition from a small , vocal minority of countries , there had been a political shift ; many countries from [LOC CARICOM  ] , the [ORG African Union  ] ( led by [LOC Ethiopia  ] ) , and [ORG AOSIS  ] will come to associate with [LOC Copenhagen  ] and engage on subsequent agreements . 
These coalitions must be coaxed and not pushed into making decisions and meeting deadlines . 
[PER Pershing  ] noted that chairmanship of organizational meetings was vital. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ghafoor  ] added that [LOC Maldives  ] would like to see that small countries , like [LOC Maldives  ] , that are at the forefront of the climate debate , receive tangible assistance from the larger economies . 
Other nations would then come to realize that there are advantages to be gained by compliance . 
[PER Pershing  ] noted that [LOC Copenhagen  ] provides a generic framework for assistance , but that the next steps are procedural . 
He asked about [MISC Maldivian  ] adaptation programs . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] referred to several projects , including harbor deepening and strengthening sea walls , that are in the development stage . 
These projects would cost approximately $50 million . 
[PER Pershing  ] encouraged [PER Ghafoor  ] to provide concrete examples and specific costs in order to increase the likelihood of bilateral assistance and congressional appropriations . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] proposed that President [PER Obama  ] deliver a speech on climate change from [LOC Maldives  ] when he next visits the region . 
He said [LOC Maldives  ] would provide a dramatic backdrop and draw further attention to environmental challenges the islands face . 
Strengthening [ORG Security Cooperation  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense for [LOC South  ] and [ORG Southeast Asia Robert Scher  ] , [PER Ghafoor  ] expressed appreciation for the warm reception he had been receiving in [LOC Washington  ] . 
He said that [MISC Maldivian  ] soldiers and police ( many now senior staff officials ) that were trained by the [LOC U.S.  ] have earned the respect of both the government and the citizens of [LOC Maldives  ] . 
( NOTE: Ghafoor’s brother is a retired director of the [ORG Maldivian National Defense Force  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) He said he looked forward to continued cooperation in this field . 
[PER Scher  ] asked how [LOC U.S.  ] training STATE 00018437 003 OF 003 compared with that of [LOC India  ] in terms of quantity and quality . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] said that both were substantive and substantial . 
He acknowledged that [LOC Maldives  ] also interacts with [LOC Bangladesh  ] , [LOC Sri Lanka  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , as one might expect of a 100 percent [MISC Muslim  ] country situated in the region . 
[PER Scher  ] indicated that the [LOC U.S.  ] did not want to get in the way of [MISC Maldivian  ] relationships with its neighbors . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] assessed that New Delhi’s perception of the [LOC U.S.  ] has evolved and that Male would be able to address any concerns . 
He stated that his government would not let relations with [LOC India  ] impact relations with the [LOC United States  ] , reflecting Maldives’s attempt to “show balance” in the past . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] replied that , if necessary , [LOC Maldives  ] would explain that neither [LOC India  ] nor [LOC Pakistan  ] need suspect anything “untoward.” [PER Ghafoor  ] also noted that young people can receive free education ( in [LOC Islamic Studies  ] ) in [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Scher  ] asked if all of the students return to [LOC Maldives  ] after their studies . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] said that some had been apprehended in round ups in [LOC Pakistan  ] , where they had been recruited by extremists . 
He said he believed that such exposure led to a rise in fundamentalist views within Maldives’s peaceful and tolerant culture. “It used to be simply a question of faith ; now you must show that you are more [MISC Muslim  ] than others , ” he said . 
Increased access to liberal western education would help to combat growing fundamentalist trends , he suggested . 
[PER Scher  ] pointed out that that some groups would hope to exploit this lack of education , and that it was good to hear that [MISC Maldivian  ] authorities were actively monitoring the situation . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] acknowledged that human rights must allow for freedom of expression and said [LOC Maldives  ] is looking for guidance on how to peaceably marry two often conflicting agendas , freedom and internal security . 
[PER Scher  ] replied that hatred is better faced head-on by a benevolent government rather than pushed underground . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ghafoor  ] noted that drug use in [LOC Maldives  ] has led to a rise in crime that President Nasheed has pledged to combat with prevention and rehabilitation . 
In the past , criminals were simply “banished” to a different island . 
He inquired about training assistance with management of prison facilities and the training of correctional officers . 
[PER Scher  ] pointed out that this would be a matter better addressed by [PER State/INL  ] , [ORG DOJ  ] and [ORG USAID  ] . 
[PER Ghafoor  ] noted that 99 percent of [LOC Maldives  ] is extremely vulnerable to attack from the sea . 
More specifically , he said that an attack ( such as by [MISC Somali  ] pirates ) on an island resort would cripple the country’s economy . 
[LOC Maldives  ] is seeking additional equipment and training from the [LOC U.S.  ] on customs and border security . 
[PER Scher  ] expressed [MISC DOD’s  ] interest in expanding bilateral defense and security engagement , continuing training , and helping build the Maldives’s maritime security capabilities to counteract the threat from terrorism , piracy , and trafficking .
