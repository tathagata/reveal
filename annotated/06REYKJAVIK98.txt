( C ) Summary: The Ambassador met with the [MISC Icelandic  ] Justice Minister 3/22 as part of post 's roll-out of the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to remove fighter aircraft and [ORG CSAR  ] helicopters from [MISC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik ( NASKEF ) . 
The Minister expressed deep disappointment at the " unilateral " decision and listed other Allied countries he calculated might fill [LOC U.S.  ] shoes . 
He did not , however , rule out continued defense cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] and urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] team bring detailed offers to the negotiating table . 
As the minister responsible for the [ORG Coast Guard  ] , he was especially focused on the need to avoid any drop in SAR capabilities when the [LOC U.S.  ] helicopters leave . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador , with poloff as notetaker , called on [MISC Icelandic  ] Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] March 22 to discuss the [LOC U.S.  ] announcement March 15 that we would remove by the end of the fiscal year the four [MISC F-15  ] jets and the five combat search-and-rescue ( [ORG CSAR  ] ) helicopters now stationed there. -------------- Shock and Thaw -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked [PER Bjarnason  ] his views on necessary next steps to continue cooperation in the security and safety areas that fall under his responsibilities . 
[PER Bjarnason  ] questioned [LOC U.S.  ] dependability as a guarantor of [LOC Iceland  ] 's security and expressed deep disappointment with the [LOC U.S.  ] decision. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador reviewed the several years of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to prepare the Icelanders for the departure of the aircraft and summarized " feverish " preparations now underway in [LOC Washington  ] to come to [LOC Reykjavik  ] in a few days with clear proposals on how we can provide [LOC Iceland  ] with a visible and credible defense . 
In response , [PER Bjarnason  ] pulled out a 2004 memorandum that his ministry had prepared regarding " co-operation , exchange of information and mutual assistance between [LOC Iceland  ] and [LOC USA  ] " and conceded that he was still interested in working together with us in all these areas , viz. , civil defense , WMD issues , border control and organized crime , training of the [ORG Icelandic Special Police  ] ( SWAT ) [ORG Force  ] , and search and rescue . 
The last was his greatest concern , he said , and replacing the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG CSAR  ] helicopters would be his highest priority over the next several weeks . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] government had been planning and budgeting to take over the [ORG SAR  ] function in FY08 ; the advanced timetable left it with a looming critical gap in capabilities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bjarnason  ] emphasized that [LOC Iceland  ] has " more cards to play than the bilateral one . 
" He noted Foreign Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] 's recent contacts with the [MISC Norwegians  ] , [MISC British  ] , and [MISC French  ] , as well as [MISC Danish  ] interest in possibly formalizing [MISC North Atlantic  ] SAR cooperation . 
He said , however , he had already been approached by [ORG Sikorsky  ] , which expressed interest in selling helicopters to [LOC Iceland  ] , and expected to hear from other vendors as well . 
Queried by the Ambassador , he confirmed [LOC Iceland  ] was also looking into the option of contracting with a private firm for temporary [ORG SAR  ] services. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Bjarnason  ] 's father was Foreign Minister when [LOC Iceland  ] signed the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] , and [PER Bjarnason  ] has been a decades-long supporter and defender of bilateral defense cooperation . 
The key take-away message from this meeting is that [LOC Iceland  ] is eager to see what we can put on the table at the upcoming bilateral discussion and that , as [PER Haarde  ] told [PER U/S Burns  ] , the search and rescue issue is of critical and immediate concern to the [MISC Icelandic  ] government .
