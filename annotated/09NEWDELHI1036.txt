It is unfair for the [MISC Tamil-speaking  ] minority to be considered second-class citizens , although the [ORG Liberation Tigers of Tamil EelamQs  ] ( LTTEQs ) violent means were not just . 
The [MISC Sri Lankan  ] government now has to stop the [ORG LTTE  ] from regrouping . 
3.QEND OF TERROR , Q editorial in May 20 Hindi daily , [ORG DAINIK JAGRAN:  ] QIt is worrisome that some [MISC Tamils  ] are trying to create a hero-like image of [PER Prabhakaran  ] after his death .
