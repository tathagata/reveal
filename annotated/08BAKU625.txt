( SBU ) On June 9-13 an inter-agency team consisting of representatives from the [ORG Department of State , Department of Energy  ] , the [ORG Coast Guard  ] , and [ORG EUCOM  ] met with a number of government and private industry officials from organizations responsible for critical energy infrastructure security in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to include [ORG British Petroleum  ] ( [ORG BP  ] ) , the [ORG State Oil Company of Azerbaijan  ] ( [ORG SOCAR  ] ) , the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) , the [ORG Ministry of National Security  ] ( [ORG MNS  ] ) , the [ORG Ministry of Emergency Situations  ] ( [ORG MES  ] ) , and the [ORG State Special Protection Service  ] ( [ORG SSPS  ] ) .

( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ONSHORE FACILITIES ------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The primary responsibility of the [ORG SSPS  ] is to provide security for the President and other high-ranking government officials , but approximately five years ago it was charged with ensuring the security of all onshore critical energy infrastructure . 
Under the mandate of its Oil and [ORG Gas Export Pipelines Security Department  ] with its approximately 1000 employees , the [ORG SSPS  ] guards the [ORG BTC  ] and gas export pipelines and is responsible for the external security around the [LOC Sangachal Terminal  ] , which it coordinates with BP. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) According to BP’s Head of [ORG Regional Security in Azerbaijan  ] , “pipeline security is in as good a shape as any pipeline in the world.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .

( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) According to [ORG BP  ] security personnel , the problems with offshore security stem from three main issues - lack of clarity between the [ORG Coast Guard  ] and the [ORG Navy  ] as to respective areas of responsibility , lack of coordination between the [ORG Coast Guard  ] and theNavy , and inadequate equipment and training in both services . 
Both [ORG Admiral Sultanov  ] , who leads Azerbaijan’s [ORG Navy  ] , and the Deputy Head of the [ORG SBS Farhad Tagizade  ] stress that there are efforts underway to improve coordination . 
[ORG A Maritime Security Strategy  ] , which [ORG Admiral Sultanov  ] claimed would more clearly delineate responsibility for energy infrastructure , is currently in development , and the two services are working together with the [LOC United States  ] to improve their coordination efforts through tabletop exercises . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Despite these efforts , Deputy Head of the [ORG SBS Tagizade  ] admits that it will take more time for the two services to develop what he called a “mature relationship.” <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG BP  ] security officials also cited equipment problems that plague the [ORG Navy  ] and [ORG Coast Guard  ] . 
According to BP’s head of regional security , the off-the-shelf , commercial anti-collision radar that [ORG BP  ] installed on the platforms and provides the [ORG Navy  ] is the best one that the [ORG Navy  ] currently has . 
[ORG BP  ] officials also claimed that there was a general shortage of boats in both services , making it difficult for them to patrol the areas around the platforms . 
The boats the services do have tend to be old [MISC Soviet-era  ] vessels , built in the 1960s and 70s.XXXXXXXXXXXX [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] DERSE</pre></code>
