End summary . 
UNGA ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On the eve of his trip to the [ORG United Nations General Assembly  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] candidly assessed [LOC Iceland  ] 's foreign relations as well as its domestic political situation in an initial meeting with [ORG CDA  ] on September 16 . 
While looking forward to the [MISC Trans-Atlantic  ] dinner , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] 's main UNGA priority is discussions with [ORG European Union  ] member states , in part to lobby for [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG EU  ] candidacy . 
In his address to the [ORG General Assembly  ] , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] said he would touch upon a number of issues including the [LOC Middle East  ] and the [LOC High North  ] , but noted that he has a propensity to speak off the cuff and may change the focus of his speech . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] also plans to discuss with the [ORG IMF  ] its review of [LOC Iceland  ] , which has been postponed pending resolution of the [ORG Icesave  ] issue . 
[ORG Icesave  ] ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Foreign Minister provided a frank update on the status of the [ORG Icesave  ] agreement ( reftel ) . 
He said that [LOC Iceland  ] recently received an informal response from the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments regarding the amendments that the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Parliament  ] attached to the original [ORG Icesave  ] agreement . 
Under normal circumstances , he would consider the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] response to be a positive one in that it clearly demonstrated intent on their part to work with [LOC Iceland  ] . 
He admitted , however , that the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] had not accepted all of [LOC Iceland  ] 's amendments and he was unsure what that meant for the future of the agreement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Skarphedinsson  ] said that he was meeting with Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] later that afternoon to discuss the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] response in greater detail . 
He expressed concern , however , about what would happen if the [ORG Icesave  ] agreement had to go back in front of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Parliament  ] . 
Calling [LOC Iceland  ] 's current political situation " troubled , " he said it is difficult to know how other political parties will react should the [ORG Icesave  ] issue come up again in [ORG Parliament  ] . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] noted that , while his [ORG Social Democratic party  ] is unified in supporting the [ORG Icesave  ] agreement , their coalition partners in the [LOC Left Green  ] alliance are deeply split over the issue . 
He called the head of the [LOC Left Green  ] alliance , Finance Minister [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] , a capable leader , but said that " he doesn't have full control of his party . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's future , according to [PER Skarphedinsson  ] , largely hinges on the [ORG Icesave  ] agreement . 
He mentioned that the fate of potential [MISC Nordic  ] and [ORG IMF  ] loans , as well as [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG EU  ] accession , all hinge on a successful completion of the [ORG Icesave  ] agreement . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] intends to continue with his dual-pronged strategy of engaging the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments and also talking to key [MISC Icelandic  ] political players . 
Although discussions continue on both fronts , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] did not appear particularly optimistic about a positive outcome . 
He noted that he and the Finance Minister continue to discuss the agreement with their counterparts in The [ORG Hague  ] and [LOC London  ] , keeping the Prime Minister informed . 
Commenting that he normally talks to the PM several times daily on this issue , he said that he and [PER Sigurdardottir  ] have a close relationship forged during their decade of working together . 
As a result he and his ministry play the dominant role in foreign relations , while she leads on domestic [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000161 002 OF 002 matters . 
[ORG Defense Matters  ] ---------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Skarphedinsson  ] also spoke about defense issues including the closure of the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) . 
Acknowledging the government 's focus on [ORG Icesave  ] , he nevertheless expressed optimism that a decision on [ORG IDA  ] 's future would come by year end . 
Some of the [ORG IDA  ] 's duties would likely transfer to the [ORG Coast Guard  ] , which falls under the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
He hoped , however , that most defense matters would remain with the [ORG MFA  ] . 
He stressed that , no matter how the reorganization turns out , [LOC Iceland  ] will continue to uphold its [ORG NATO  ] obligations . 
When speaking of [ORG NATO  ] commitments , the minister specifically stated that [LOC Iceland  ] intends to take part in the [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercise in 2010 . 
( Comment . 
This information contradicts rumors we heard earlier that [LOC Iceland  ] was considering postponing next year 's [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercise as a cost-saving measure . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Minister said that [LOC Iceland  ] also remains committed to the effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said that , while he personally has concerns about the prospects for the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [MISC Icelandic  ] government understands its responsibility to contribute as a [ORG NATO  ] member . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has no intention , he said , of completely withdrawing its personnel from [LOC Afghanistan  ] and has never even discussed it as an option. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Noting the occasional activity of [MISC Russian  ] planes in [LOC Iceland  ] 's air space , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] said he could not overstate the importance of the [LOC High North  ] . 
The [MISC Russians  ] , he claimed , have specifically stated that the [LOC High North  ] is a top strategic priority . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] then , bluntly , used the [LOC High North  ] discussion as an opportunity to chastise the [LOC U.S.  ] for closing down the [LOC Keflavik Airbase  ] in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The decision , he said , was " a bloody mistake . 
" He noted that he understood the reasoning behind the decision and the need to reduce costs , but believes that the [LOC U.S.  ] should have maintained some sort of presence in [LOC Iceland  ] to protect its interests in the [LOC High North  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] Accession Process --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Iceland  ] 's bid to join the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Skarphedinnsson  ] said that everything is progressing smoothly . 
[LOC Iceland  ] should have answers for the [ORG EU  ] accession questionnaire by the [ORG EU  ] 's November 16 deadline . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] believes that this deadline was intentionally set to ensure that [LOC Iceland  ] 's candidacy cannot be evaluated at December 's [ORG European Council  ] summit . 
Delaying consideration until spring would avoid the perception that [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership is fast-tracked at the expense of other candidates . 
The most likely scenario , he opined , is that [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership application would be discussed at the March summit of the [ORG European Council  ] and that accession negotiations will begin soon afterwards .
