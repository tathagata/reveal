( C ) SUMMARY: CJCS Admiral [PER Mike Mullen  ] met with [MISC French  ] Chief of [MISC Defense  ] ( [ORG CHOD  ] ) General [PER Jean-Louis Georgelin  ] to discuss the possibility of increasing the number of [MISC French  ] troops committed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , in advance of the December 3-4 [ORG NATO Ministerial  ] meetings . 
This discussion was precipitated by the expected release of a new [LOC US  ] strategic framework for [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the next two weeks . 
[LOC US  ] attendees were: CJCS [PER ADM Mullen  ] , Ambassador [PER Rivkin  ] ( US Ambassador to [LOC France  ] ) , CAPT [PER Mike Gilday  ] ( CJCS Executive Officer ) , and COL T. [PER Bruce Sweeney  ] ( [ORG US Defense Attache  ] to [LOC France  ] ) . 
The [MISC French  ] attendees were: GEN [PER Georgelin  ] , Vice Admiral [PER Rogel  ] ( [MISC French  ] Deputy Chief of Joint Staff for Operations ) , Rear Admiral [ORG Prazuk  ] ( [ORG French Communications  ] and Public Affairs Chief ) , and Mr. [PER Magnien  ] , ( [ORG Diplomatic Advisor  ] to the [ORG CHOD  ] ) . 
GEN [PER Georgelin  ] indicated that the [MISC French  ] indeed have additional capacity to provide soldiers for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but that the [MISC French  ] Joint Staff currently does not have the political support to do so . 
GEN [PER Georgelin  ] did not provide a number of additional troops that could be deployed , and did not respond to the Chairman regarding suggested numbers . 
Gen [PER Georgelin  ] then discussed the [MISC French  ] President 's public statement of " Not one more soldier for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , " followed by suggestions of how the [LOC US  ] and [ORG NATO  ] might approach [LOC France  ] to get political support for additional [MISC French  ] troops . 
This is a DAO [LOC Paris  ] drafted message also reported as an [ORG IIR  ] . 
End Summary. -------------------------------------------- POLITICAL SITUATION: NO MORE TROOPS -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The official [MISC French  ] political position on additional troops is that [LOC France  ] " will not provide one more soldier " for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , as stated by President [PER Sarkozy  ] in October 2009 . 
In fact , GEN [PER Georgelin  ] spoke with CJCS to discuss the possibility of additional [MISC French  ] troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] the day prior to President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's public statement . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] made his announcement without consulting Gen [PER Georgelin  ] . 
When GEN [PER Georgelin  ] later met with the [MISC French  ] President , Mr. [PER Sarkozy  ] told [ORG GEN Georgelin  ] he could perhaps add police trainers , civilian or administrative personnel to boost the total numbers of the [MISC French  ] contribution , but no additional soldiers would be sent for now . 
[ORG GEN Georgelin  ] stated that the President does not think that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is popular with [MISC French  ] voters or other politicians and that the President is concerned about the regional elections in March and the success of his political party in those elections. -------------------------------------------- [MISC FRENCH  ] [ORG CHOD  ] 's SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) GEN [PER Georgelin  ] reviewed how the [MISC French  ] troop level in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has increased over time , as well as how he has managed to shape the [MISC French  ] contribution into a more effective combat force . 
[ORG GEN Georgelin  ] has overseen a significant increase from approximately 2000 troops to over 3700 on the ground . 
This was partly effected by changing off-site troop contributions into on-site contributions ( such as reducing [MISC French  ] Naval support personnel in the [LOC Indian Ocean  ] while increasing [MISC French  ] [ORG Army  ] troops in-country ) , and also by a direct increase in the overall numbers of [MISC French  ] troops committed to the [LOC Afghanistan  ] effort . 
Finally , [ORG GEN Georgelin  ] has also directed a change in mission for troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in order to provide a more potent combat force . 
By reducing [MISC French  ] contributions to the [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] training mission ( [MISC French  ] troops had been running the Officer 's Training at the [ORG Afghan National Army Training Command  ] ) , and switching those billets to straight combat troops , [ORG GEN Georgelin  ] has effected an actual increase in combat soldiers for his engaged units within the existing 3700 troop ceiling . 
[MISC French  ] combat forces were recently reinforced with two additional platoons of infantry through this process. --------------------------------------------- - [ORG NATO  ] FORCE GENERATION CONFERENCE FOR [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] AND HOW TO GET THE [MISC FRENCH  ] TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL FORCES --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER ADM Mullen  ] said that he expected a Force Generation Conference to be part of the [ORG NATO Ministerial  ] meeting in early December 2009 , provided that President [PER Obama  ] made his strategic decision for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and that the strategic framework was provided to [ORG NATO  ] allies . 
[ORG GEN Georgelin  ] then suggested that although a full court press of reciprocal calls and visits might be appreciated and even helpful , what was really necessary to get approval of additional troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] was a direct discussion between President [PER Obama  ] and President [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
He said that President [PER Obama  ] must tell President [PER Sarkozy  ] how important the [MISC French  ] troop contribution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was , how his vision in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was correct and aligned with that of the [LOC US  ] , how important and successful [MISC French  ] re-integration into [ORG NATO  ] has been ( including GEN [PER Abriel  ] , the [ORG French Supreme Allied  ] Commander for Transformation ) , and how much the [LOC US  ] needed his help personally , as well as how much we needed additional [MISC French  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG GEN Georgelin  ] further suggested that we should ask for additional troops to take on training missions , thus lowering the risk . 
Finally , [ORG GEN Georgelin  ] declared that President [PER Obama  ] must ask now , because it will be more difficult to get a positive result closer to or after the regional [MISC French  ] elections in March . 
In effect , President [PER Obama  ] must speak to President [PER Sarkozy  ] now , and flattery will get you everywhere in this case. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Finally , GEN [PER Georgelin  ] discussed the fact that successful [MISC French  ] Presidents since [PER De Gaulle  ] have put the [LOC United States  ] and [ORG NATO  ] at some distance in order to have independent freedom of action , both politically and militarily . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] has not done this , but has been , until recently , a true Atlanticist . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's early trip to the [LOC US  ] , his decision for [LOC France  ] to rejoin [ORG NATO  ] as a full member , and other moves have put him at odds with the [MISC French  ] electorate and [MISC French  ] elite . 
Thus , President [PER Sarkozy  ] is currently trying to distance himself from the [LOC US  ] and improve his domestic popularity and appeal . 
[PER Georgelin  ] said that the President may be feeling vulnerable just now , and even if he agrees to additional troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( if President [PER Obama  ] asks him ) he will not take the position publicly until after the [MISC French  ] regional elections in [LOC March.  ] --------------------------------------------- - WHAT CAN [LOC FRANCE  ] CONTRIBUTE ? --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) General [PER Georgelin  ] did not specify a number for additional troop contributions . 
CJCS stated that he was looking for a total of 5,000 - 25,000 additional troops from all [ORG NATO  ] countries and suggested 2,000 from [LOC France  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] laughed ( with the Chairman ) at this . 
CJCS later opined once again that [LOC France  ] could provide 2,000 troops and this also generated some nervous laughter . 
[PER Georgelin  ] said that the numbers discussed within the [MISC French  ] Joint Staff have been approximately 1,500 troops , which would put total [MISC French  ] contributions at 5,250 . 
Although 5,250 is a large number for the [MISC French  ] , it is sustainable given the total number of [MISC French  ] forces and their reduced presence at overseas bases forecast by the [ORG French Government  ] 's [ORG White Paper.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) GEN [PER Georgelin  ] believes that [ORG NATO  ] has accomplished an awful lot in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , further believes that more can be collectively accomplished there , and thinks GEN [PER McChrystal  ] 's strategy and way of thinking is the right way to go in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He feels that [ORG ISAF  ] will be successful in changing dynamics in [LOC Afghanistan  ] if we all go forward together , and he sees [MISC French  ] forces as an integral part of that successful effort .
