( S ) EUR - [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina  ] - [ORG Emergency Action Committee  ] ( [ORG EAC  ] ) [LOC Sarajevo  ] met June 17 to discuss a large protest by veterans groups scheduled for June 18 at the [ORG Bosnian Government  ] building adjacent to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] , s Chancery building . 
The [ORG RSO  ] made a number of recommendations , to which the [ORG EAC  ] concurred . 
The protest began at 10 a.m. on June 18 with over 2,000 war veterans and supporters disputing reductions in pensions . 
Local law enforcement blocked the street in front of the [MISC Embassy  ] at 9:30 a.m. , and the [ORG Mission  ] was placed on essential personnel status . 
At one point , 20 to 30 protesters tried to storm the government building , breaking some windows . 
Host-nation media reported two people were injured in an altercation with local police in this attempt . 
The demonstrators maintained their distance from Post , which will be open for normal operations today , June 19 .

( C ) AF - [LOC Eritrea  ] - The [ORG UN  ] security officer in [LOC Asmara  ] reported to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] , s [ORG Regional Security Office  ] that he has recently instructed all [ORG UN  ] personnel to avoid walking in [LOC Asmara  ] and is upgrading residential security at all houses to include around-the-clock guard coverage in response to the rise in crime in the capital . 
Post continues to see an increase in crime as economic conditions in [LOC Asmara  ] continue to deteriorate , water/food/fuel shortages persist , and unemployment increases . 
Although the [MISC Embassy  ] is still able to purchase water for [ORG Mission  ] use , it is becoming increasingly more difficult . 
( Appendix source 2 ) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) [LOC Mali  ] - At 12:30 p.m. on June 18 , [ORG RSO Bamako  ] was notified by the [ORG Surveillance Detection Team  ] that a man was closely observing the Chief of [ORG Mission  ] , s ( [ORG COM  ] , s ) residence . 
The man then walked over to the guard post and questioned the guards about the [ORG COM  ] and why so much security was needed . 
An investigator interviewed the man and discovered that he is an [MISC Indian  ] national with an [MISC Indian  ] passport that displayed extensive travel to [LOC West Africa  ] . 
( [ORG RSO Bamako Spot Report  ] ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Zimbabwe  ] - [PER Jocelyn Chiwenga  ] , wife of [ORG Defense Forces  ] Chief [PER Constantine Chiwenga  ] , called the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to [LOC Zimbabwe  ] June 18 and insulted and threatened him . 
On other occasions , she has spoken with [MISC Embassy  ] staff and criticized the [LOC U.S.  ] with profanity and abusive language . 
Post does not believe [PER Chiwenga  ] poses a physical threat ; however , the [ORG RSO  ] has been briefed and is scheduled to meet with contacts at the [ORG Zimbabwe Republic Police  ] . 
This incident will be addressed in a diplomatic note to the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] .

( [ORG U  ] ) Key Concerns <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) AF - [LOC Somalia  ] - [ORG TFG  ] minister of national security killed in suicide bombing: On the afternoon of June 18 , [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) Minister of [ORG National Security  ] [PER Omar Hashi  ] was killed by a suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device while in the [LOC Medina Hotel  ] in [LOC Beletweyne  ] . 
Former [MISC Somali  ] Ambassador to [LOC Ethiopia  ] [PER Abdikarim Farah  ] was also reported to be dead . 
Initial open source reports from a local hospital indicate the attack resulted in 20 casualties ; later reporting shows more than 50 dead and 100 injured . 
No group has publicly claimed responsibility for the attack , but an intelligence report of limited credibility alleges al-Shabaab operatives are to blame. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] notes this is first suicide attack in [LOC Beletweyne  ] , and , if al-Shabaab operatives are indeed responsible , it further suggests the group is altering tactics in its fight against the [ORG TFG  ] , specifically to incorporate the use of suicide operations . 
Recently received [MISC Ethiopian  ] intelligence suggested al-Shabaab operatives were preparing to use a number of car bombs in suicide attacks against various targets in [LOC Mogadishu  ] in late [LOC June.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Suicide bombs are increasingly common in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
According to press reports , 30 lethal suicide bombings have occurred since five went off in October in [LOC Somaliland  ] . 
Tearline from May 26 stated , &The [MISC Somali  ] extremist group al-Shabaab employed the use of a suicide bomber against [ORG TFG  ] soldiers in [LOC Mogadishu  ] on May 24 , resulting in at least six soldiers and one civilian killed . 
The attack was the first suicide attack against supporters of moderate [MISC Islamist  ] President [PER Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed.8  ] The death of [PER Hashi  ] in addition to the June 17 killing of [ORG Bandadir Region Police  ] Chief [PER Ali Said  ] will likely demoralize and impair the struggling [ORG TFG  ] in the near term , as could al-Shabaab , s possible increasing willingness and ability to utilize suicide attacks on [ORG TFG  ] leadership in [LOC Somalia  ] .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG NEA  ] - [MISC Persian Gulf  ] - Possible fabricator warns of [MISC Iranian  ] threat: According to information provided during a liaison exchange by an [ORG Emirati Government  ] service originating from a suspected fabricator , as of mid-June , the [ORG Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) was planning an unspecified attack in the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] . 
[MISC Iranian  ] agents allegedly shipped four weapons to the port at [LOC Jebel Ali  ] circa March , with a final destination to the emirate of [LOC Ajman  ] . 
Additionally , the [ORG IRGC  ] planned to conduct attacks in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , and [LOC Bahrain  ] using different teams . 
No further information was provided regarding these alleged operations. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] agrees with the [ORG CIA  ] assessment included in the full report , which states the information is likely fabricated . 
Concern over possible [MISC Iranian  ] sleeper cells is nothing new for [MISC Gulf  ] governments ; a volume of reporting illustrates the mistrust of [MISC Sunni  ] regimes in the region regarding their [PER Shi  ] , a communities . 
However , [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] assesses it is unlikely [LOC Tehran  ] will conduct a major ( or attributable ) operation against [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Western  ] , or Gulf-nation interests lacking a significant regional event such as a military strike against [LOC Iran  ] . 
( Appendix source 7 ) <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG SCA  ] - [LOC India  ] - [ORG LT  ] member [PER Shafiq Khafa  ] possibly preparing for operations: Tearline reports , &Hussein , an [MISC India-based  ] [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] ( [ORG LT  ] ) member , continued operational planning on three tasks in early June . 
The tasks were associated with a possible operation against [MISC Gujarat  ] Chief Minister [PER Narendar Modi  ] , the establishment of a training camp , and unspecified work involving a car . 
[PER Hussein  ] would coordinate his activities with an [MISC India-based  ] colleague identified as [PER Sameer.8  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S//REL TO [LOC USA  ] , [LOC FVEY  ] ) Separate tearline indicates , &Pakistan-based [PER Shafiq Khafa  ] prepared in mid-June with [MISC India-based  ] associate S J for possible operations in [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Khafa  ] was looking for information on possible training sites in the [MISC Indian  ] states of [LOC Tamil Nadu  ] , [LOC Karnataka  ] , and [MISC Kerala.8  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] notes earlier credible tearline suggests [PER Khafa  ] , s network is striving to stand up two teams in southern [LOC India  ] that rely on the support of [ORG LT  ] members based in [LOC India  ] , [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and [LOC Nepal  ] . 
Although specific details of planned [ORG LT  ] attacks remain unknown , late-May intelligence indicates [PER Khafa  ] , s cells were engaged in surveillance activities of potential targets , likely in southern [LOC India  ] . 
Early-May reporting further suggests [LOC Kerala  ] or [LOC Tamil Nadu  ] may be used as a base of operations following the establishment of a facilitation team in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , with the estimated time of completion for setting up the facilitation route and camps to be two to three months .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Domestic - DoS staff targeted by spear phishing as climate change talks are underway: <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C//NF ) Key highlights: The [ORG UNFCCC  ] aims to commit developed nations to a plan for reducing [ORG GHG  ] emissions . 
U.S.-PRC talks are in progress to reach consensus on new [ORG GHG  ] emission requirements . 
DoS personnel have been targeted with socially engineered climate change-related e-mail . 
It is probable that receipt of climate change-themed socially engineered messages will persist as negotiations continue. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Source paragraph: &China and the [LOC U.S.  ] failed to achieve a breakthrough at their latest round of climate talks on Wednesday ( June 10 ) , raising the stakes in the global effort to fight global climate change . 
The two countries responsible for almost half of the world , s greenhouse gas ( [ORG GHG  ] ) emissions ended three days of negotiations in [LOC Beijing.8  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CTAD  ] comment: In June 1992 , a [ORG United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  ] -- informally known as the [LOC Earth Summit  ] -- was held in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] . 
During this conference , the [ORG United Nations Framework Convention  ] on Climate Change ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) -- a treaty intended to &achieve stabilization of [ORG GHG  ] concentrations in the atmosphere at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system8 -- was produced . 
The [ORG UNFCCC  ] , primarily focused on the voluntary stabilization of [ORG GHG  ] emissions by industrialized countries , was ratified and put into effect March 21 , 1994 . 
In order to evaluate the progress of [ORG UNFCCC  ] signatories , the parties involved gather annually in meetings dubbed Conferences of the Parties ( COPs ) . 
At [LOC COP-3  ] held in [LOC Kyoto  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , in December 2007 , a protocol to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] called the &Kyoto Protocol8 was adopted , outlining in part legally binding commitments for the reduction of [ORG GHG  ] emissions for developed nations . 
The terms of this protocol are set to expire in 2012 , and the goal of this year , s [MISC COP-15  ] , which will be held December 1 to 18 in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , is to establish a new agreement among concerned nations prior to the [LOC Kyoto Protocol  ] , s end. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG CTAD  ] comment: Currently , the [LOC U.S.  ] and People , s [LOC Republic of China  ] ( [ORG PRC  ] ) -- two of the world , s largest contributors of GHGs -- are conducting specific negotiations on the topic in attempts to come to an agreement on what level of cuts in [ORG GHG  ] emissions should be attained . 
As these negotiations have been underway , evidence of an attempt to gain unauthorized entry to computer systems operated by DoS personnel involved with climate issues has surfaced . 
Though the incident has not been attributed to any known hostile actor , the event appears to be a targeted spear-phishing attempt and may be indicative of efforts to gather intelligence on the [LOC U.S.  ] , s position on climate change issues. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CTAD  ] comment: On June 1 , [ORG CTAD  ] , s [ORG Technical Analysis/Special Operations  ] monitoring detected a malicious e-mail massage targeting five DoS individuals employed within the [ORG Division of Ocean Affairs  ] , Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change . 
The socially engineered message had the subject line &China and Climate Change8 and was spoofed to appear as if it were from a legitimate international economics columnist at the [ORG National Journal  ] . 
In addition , the body of the e-mail contained comments designed to appeal to the recipients as it was specifically aligned with their job function , and a signature block with contact information for the spoofed sender was present . 
Attached to the message was a [ORG PDF  ] file , also titled &China and Climate Change , 8 which harbored malicious code designed to exploit the [ORG Adobe Collab  ] getIcon ( ) , JavaScript vulnerability ( [MISC CVE-2009-0927  ] ) . 
This vulnerability , if executed successfully , would have allowed malicious actors to remotely execute arbitrary code on a victim computer . 
The [ORG PDF  ] document also contained the [ORG Poison Ivy Remote Administration Tool  ] -- a malicious software program that provides a remote user with nearly complete control over a comprised system . 
However , since the DoS users targeted in this intrusion attempt were operating with currently patched versions of [ORG Adobe  ] software , there was neither compromise nor data lost as a result of this incident ( for technical information about the incident , see [ORG CTAD Report TR-09-034  ] ) . <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C//NF ) [ORG CTAD  ] comment: DoS employees dealing with sensitive diplomatic matters are often targets of social-engineering schemes conducted by actors seeking to harvest sensitive information from DoS computer systems and networks . 
As negotiations on the subject of climate change continue , it is probable intrusion attempts such as this will persist . 
[ORG CTAD  ] recommends personnel involved with climate change issues or topics relating to the upcoming [ORG COP-15  ] continue to remain aware of the elevated risk of targeted socially engineered e-mail and report any suspicious messages to their information systems security officer ( [ORG ISSO  ] ) .

( [ORG U  ] ) Suspicious Activity Incidents <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SCA  ] - [LOC Uzbekistan  ] - A vehicle with two occupants was parked across the street from [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy Tashkent  ] June 2 . 
During the cited period , VIP visitors arrived at Post for a meeting with the Ambassador . 
The diplomatic police were asked to check the vehicle , but they did not act . 
Five minutes later , the vehicle moved about 80 meters from the [ORG Embassy  ] and parked . 
After several more requests , the police finally walked over to the car and spoke to the driver . 
He indicated he was waiting for his friend who was &visiting8 the [ORG Consular Section  ] . 
Shortly afterward , the vehicle departed the area without picking anyone up. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) RSO Action/Assessment: It is possible this was some sort of surveillance activity by the host government or others . 
All relevant information was passed to the police ; however , it is highly unlikely the [ORG Embassy  ] will hear anything . 
The [MISC Uzbeks  ] do not share information or reveal the results of their investigations. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 .
