[PER Moreno  ] said that the Order was " good " . 
However , the [ORG GOS  ] does not plan at the moment to change and/or introduce legislation along the lines of the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Iraq  ] Executive Order . 
[PER Morenos  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] would welcome information from the [LOC U.S.  ] on specific cases of Spain-related [LOC Iraq  ] insurgency financing . 
He noted , however , that even with the " best will in the world " , there was no " mechanism " in [LOC Spain  ] to block financing for " insurgents " , unless one could also show that said " insurgents " also supported and/or were terrorists . 
He mentioned the example of [PER Moqtada al Sadr  ] , clearly an insurgent , but somebody the [LOC Iraqui  ] government might want to include in a political settlement . 
[PER Morenos  ] said his comments were the [ORG GOS  ] position on the [LOC Iraq  ] Executive Order .
