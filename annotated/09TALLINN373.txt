<code><pre>S E C R E T TALLINN 000373 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 2019/12/16 TAGS [ORG NATO  ] , [ORG MARR  ] , [ORG MCAP  ] , [ORG PREL  ] , [ORG EN SUBJECT: Estonia Pleased  ] with [ORG NATO  ] Contingency Planning Plan REF: STATE 127892 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Marc Nordberg  ] , Political/Economic Chief ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) Classified by [ORG DCM Karen Decker for Reasons  ] 1.4 B & D. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Pol Chief and DATT delivered reftel points on December 15 to [PER Paul Teesalu  ] , Director of the [ORG MFA’s Security Policy Division  ] , and to [PER Sven Sakkov  ] , [ORG MOD  ] Undersecretary for [ORG Defense Policy  ] , and [PER Eerik Marmei  ] , [ORG MOD  ] Director of the [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG ESDP Department.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Teesalu  ] welcomed the information and called it an “early [MISC Christmas  ] present.” [PER Teesalu  ] was pleased to see a clear plan to add the [MISC Baltic States  ] to [LOC Eagle Guardian  ] , and thought this the best option for easily including the [MISC Baltic  ] region in contingency planning . 
[PER Teesalu  ] also fully agreed that all such discussion should be conducted out of the public eye , stating that [LOC Estonia  ] is looking for , “solidarity , not visibility.” The [ORG GOE  ] has asked the [MISC Lithuanians  ] to keep contingency planning discussions private as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Sakkov  ] likewise stated this information is good news , and is a major event for [LOC Estonia  ] 5 B= years after joining [ORG NATO  ] . 
He thanked the [ORG USG  ] for its support on contingency planning . 
[PER Sakkov  ] however wondered about the [MISC Polish  ] reaction . 
On the margins of the November 2008 [MISC NATO-Ukraine Commission  ] meeting the [MISC Polish  ] delegation told [PER Sakkov  ] that they were against including the [MISC Baltic  ] states into [LOC Eagle Guardian  ] as they did not want the [MISC Polish  ] plan to be diluted or held hostage in case other allies opposed adding the [MISC Baltic  ] states . 
[PER Sakkov  ] added he recently heard from [MISC Lithuanian  ] counterparts that [LOC Poland  ] has not softened its position. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Sakkov  ] was also concerned about the process of getting the [MISC Baltic  ] region added to [LOC EAGLE GUARDIAN  ] , asking on several occasions whether the Chairman of the [ORG Military Committee  ] ( [ORG CMC  ] ) would have to inform the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( [ORG NAC  ] ) or just the Secretary General ( [ORG SECGEN  ] ) , and how the addition would be approved in the [ORG MC  ] and tasked to [LOC SACEUR  ] . 
Although not expressly stated , he seemed concerned about opportunities for other members to put a stop to the process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Sakkov  ] further stated he would immediately inform President [PER Ilves  ] , prior to [MISC Ilves’  ] departure for a December 16 meeting with the [MISC Baltic  ] , and possibly [MISC Polish  ] , presidents . 
[PER Sakkov  ] said [MISC Estonian  ] J3 and J5 planners were ready to assist in developing the contingency plan , but asked if the [ORG USG  ] had any further information on a reassurance package for the [MISC Baltic  ] states - something that can be used publicly , such as increased exercises , to show the [MISC Baltic  ] peoples they will be covered by [ORG Article  ] 5 .
