( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: In 2009 [LOC Iceland  ] took significant steps to combat trafficking in persons . 
The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] , for the first time , prosecuted alleged trafficking violators on TIP specific charges . 
In addition , the government passed and began to implement the country 's first anti-TIP national action plan . 
The parliament also passed legislation that aligns [LOC Iceland  ] 's legal definition on human trafficking with that of the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] , thus paving the way for possible ratification of the protocol this year . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is a country of destination and transit for trafficked women ( primarily in the sex industry ) and to a lesser extent for men ( restaurant and construction industry ) . 
It is not believed to be a source country and there are no current indications of trafficking within [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Most alleged cases include underpaid and/or mistreated workers in nightclubs and massage parlors as well as prostitutes trafficked from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] . 
The government provided trafficking victims and witnesses with police protection and social assistance .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) THE COUNTRY'S TIP SITUATION: -- A . 
The amount of information available and the attention focused on the TIP problem in [LOC Iceland  ] increased dramatically this year , due in large part to several high profile TIP cases . 
The media reported extensively on the subject , government officials spoke openly about the problem and the [MISC NGO  ] community became more engaged on the topic . 
Most information regarding human trafficking remains anecdotal in nature . 
The [ORG Icelandic Red Cross  ] published a comprehensive report in August on the human trafficking problem in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The report claimed that there were at least 59 and possibly as many as 128 cases of human trafficking to [LOC Iceland  ] in the past three years . 
This estimate , which relied heavily on second-hand information and anecdotes , is the first attempt to quantify the trafficking problem in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] chose to neither publicly confirm nor dispute these figures . 
Privately , however , several government officials opined that the figures in the [ORG Red Cross  ] report were too high . 
The government does intend to commission its own analysis of the trafficking situation in [LOC Iceland  ] in the near future . 
Extensive media reporting on TIP issues occurred during the year , most of it related to two high-profile incidents of alleged trafficking that are discussed in question [PER B. Also  ] receiving significant media coverage was the unveiling in March of the country 's first comprehensive anti-trafficking action plan and a government-sponsored TIP symposium that took place in October . 
Media coverage of these incidents and events was generally accurate and objective . 
-- [PER B.  ] [LOC Iceland  ] is a country of destination and transit for trafficked women ( primarily in the sex industry ) and to a lesser extent for men ( restaurant and construction industry ) . 
It is not believed to be a source country and there are no current indications of trafficking within [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Post sources agree that , with rare exceptions , victims are trafficked primarily to the greater [LOC Reykjavik  ] metropolitan area . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 002.3 OF 010 The [ORG Red Cross  ] report , mentioned earlier in question A , posits that 70 percent of all trafficking victims in [LOC Iceland  ] are associated with the sex industry . 
Most alleged cases include underpaid and/or mistreated workers in nightclubs and massage parlors as well as prostitutes trafficked from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] . 
Nightclub and massage parlor workers -- who are allegedly forced to work as prostitutes -- may stay for several months before being trafficked onward , while other prostitutes may spend only a few days in [LOC Reykjavik  ] before being moved abroad . 
Two high profile incidents relating to sex trafficking occurred in [LOC Iceland  ] this year . 
-- In October 2009 , prosecutors indicted [PER Catalina Ncogo  ] , an [MISC Icelandic  ] citizen of [MISC Equatorial Guinean  ] origin , on charges of human trafficking , profiting from prostitution as a third party , and drug smuggling . 
[PER Ncogo  ] was accused of deceiving another woman , a compatriot from [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] , into coming to [LOC Iceland  ] for a vacation and then holding her captive for a number of months . 
The trafficking indictment was the first charge of this nature in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
On December 1 the [ORG Reykjanes District Court  ] acquitted [PER Ncogo  ] of the human trafficking charge , but convicted her on the charges of profiting from prostitution and drug smuggling . 
She was sentenced to two years in jail but she appealed the decision to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
In addition , the State Prosecutor appealed the not guilty verdict on trafficking charges to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
Two days later , [PER Ncogo  ] was arrested again on charges of trafficking in a separate case . 
She remains in custody and no trial date has been set for either of her pending cases . 
-- Five [MISC Lithuanian  ] men were indicted in the [ORG District Court  ] of [ORG Reykjanes  ] in January 2010 on charges of human trafficking . 
The men were accused of bringing a 19-year-old girl from [LOC Lithuania  ] to [LOC Iceland  ] with the intention of sexually exploiting her . 
The [ORG Reykjanes Police  ] uncovered the plot upon the woman 's arrival in country and she was quickly placed under 24-hour protective surveillance . 
The alleged perpetrators have remained under police custody since their arrest in October . 
The five [MISC Lithuanian  ] men , as well as one [MISC Icelander  ] who was also later indicted on charges of human trafficking relating to the incident , were tried in court and a verdict is pending . 
Reports of labor exploitation of foreign construction workers ( in rare cases , possibly trafficked to [LOC Iceland  ] ) have decreased dramatically in the past few years . 
Undocumented foreign workers - mostly [MISC Baltic  ] and [ORG Eastern European  ] - in [LOC Iceland  ] 's construction and manufacturing sector may be exploited , but most sources believe that these are cases of immigrant and employment law violations rather than trafficking in persons . 
Press accounts of such cases have drastically decreased during the reporting period compared to previous years ; probably because the demand for such workers has decreased in the wake of [LOC Iceland  ] 's financial and economic crisis . 
There was no evidence of trafficking in children . 
-- [PER C. With  ] regard to sex trafficking , most alleged cases include underpaid and/or mistreated workers in nightclubs and massage parlors . 
Nightclub dancers are allegedly encouraged , and possibly obligated , to provide sexual services during performances in private rooms as well as to make prostitution calls outside the clubs . 
Foreign prostitutes brought to [LOC Iceland  ] for shorter periods of time are allegedly required to provide sexual services in hotels or private apartments , where they stay during their time in the country . 
Reports of undocumented foreign workers living in industrial space and less-than-optimal living conditions have mostly vanished from [MISC Icelandic  ] news reports . 
Many of the [ORG Eastern European  ] and [MISC Baltic  ] citizens who came to [LOC Iceland  ] in search of employment appear to have returned to their home countries in the wake of the financial and economic crisis that hit [LOC Iceland  ] in October 2008 . 
-- [PER D. Women  ] from [ORG Eastern Europe  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] , involved in the sex industry , appear to be the primary victims of TIP in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 003.3 OF 010 -- [PER E. Traffickers  ] in [LOC Iceland  ] tend to operate in small groups , either independently or with ties to larger organized crime syndicates . 
A February 2009 report by the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner confirmed the existence of organized prostitution in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The report went on to suggest that [MISC Icelandic  ] criminal elements likely serve as local agents for foreign organized crime rings who may be financing prostitution operations . 
Traffickers in [LOC Iceland  ] , the report concluded , are also likely connected with dealers of illegal narcotics . 
Traffickers allegedly take advantage of international laws to transport their victims into and out of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is in the [ORG Schengen Zone  ] as well as the [ORG European Economic Area  ] ( [ORG EEA  ] ) , which allows for the free passage of travelers and workers between [LOC Iceland  ] and other [MISC European  ] countries . 
Workers from [ORG EEA  ] countries may come to [LOC Iceland  ] visa-free for up to three months to seek employment . 
Traffickers reportedly use this provision to bring prostitutes to the country and then move them again before the expiration of the three-month period , thereby removing the need for false documents or fraudulent work permit applications . 
There are no reports of travel or employment agencies or marriage brokers acting as fronts for traffickers. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SETTING THE SCENE FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ANTI-TIP EFFORTS: -- A . 
The government of [LOC Iceland  ] has acknowledged that trafficking is a worldwide problem from which [LOC Iceland  ] is not immune . 
Several of [LOC Iceland  ] 's highest officials have spoken publicly about the problem . 
Foreign Minister [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] opened a government-sponsored symposium on human trafficking by declaring the [ORG GOI  ] 's unwavering support for the fight against human trafficking . 
He stressed that TIP was a problem in the country and a top priority for the government . 
Noting that the [ORG GOI  ] has already drafted and issued a national anti-TIP action plan , the Minister said ratifying the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] during the current parliamentary season was imperative . 
More than 100 people attended the symposium which was sponsored by the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Justice and Human Rights  ] on October 30 . 
Earlier , in March , the Minister of [ORG Social Affairs  ] at the time , [PER Asta Ragnheidur Johannesdottir  ] , acknowledged that trafficking was a problem when she presented the first [MISC Icelandic  ] anti-TIP action plan to parliament . 
At that time , she said , " Human trafficking is one of the most appalling forms of transnational organized crime and it is very important to capture the traffickers and provide trafficking victims with protection and assistance . 
The government 's message [ with this action plan ] is clear ; human trafficking will not be tolerated here . 
" The action plan includes several key steps including: criminalizing the buying of sex ; banning and outlawing strip clubs ; granting temporary residence permits to TIP victims and establishing an expert anti-TIP team to oversee TIP issues in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Several of these steps have been implemented but most are not yet in force . 
The government hopes to have them all enacted by the end of 2012 ( see section 5 ( Prevention ) for details on what has been done ) . 
-- [PER B. On  ] October 1 , the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] and [ORG Ecclesiastical Affairs  ] became the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] and [ORG Human Rights  ] and , at the same time , it became the lead agency for TIP issues , taking over from the [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] . 
Institutions and agencies under the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] that share TIP responsibilities include: the [ORG Directorate of Immigration  ] , the [ORG State Prosecutor 's Office  ] , and the National Commissioner of Police and local police forces . 
The [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] ( including the [ORG Equal Rights Office  ] and [ORG Directorate of Labor  ] ) are also involved in anti-trafficking efforts . 
-- [PER C. In  ] previous years , lack of a detailed understanding of the problem of human trafficking was an obstacle to moving forward on the issue . 
A previous Minister of [ORG Justice  ] famously stated that drafting an anti-TIP action plan was not that urgent and that concrete actions spoke louder than words . 
This attitude has changed , [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 004.3 OF 010 however , with the increased attention that the matter is receiving in the media . 
The fight against TIP is now on the radar screen and the current government is taking active steps to combat the problem . 
The major obstacle to combating TIP is now funding and resources , especially for law enforcement . 
The country 's entire local and national police forces are comprised of only 834 individuals ( as of February 1 , 2009 ) . 
While law enforcement officials note that there are many advantages to operating with such a small police force , there are also obvious limits on the amount of resources that can be devoted specifically to the problem of TIP . 
To compound the problem , [LOC Iceland  ] 's already stretched law enforcement resources are shrinking in the wake of the economic crisis that began in October 2008 . 
Corruption does not pose a problem for TIP resources in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
According to government officials , funding for TIP victim assistance is also not a problem in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Government officials noted , however , that funding for trafficking victims is currently drawn from a general " foreigners in need " funding allotment and not from a TIP specific allotment . 
-- [PER D. There  ] is no systematic monitoring or reporting by the government of its anti-trafficking efforts . 
According to officials at the [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] , however , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] provides some self-reporting on the trafficking situation via the mandatory reports that it submits to [ORG UN  ] bodies and to the [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] . 
These reports are publically accessible . 
According to the anti-TIP action plan , however , the Specialist and [ORG Coordination Team for Human Trafficking  ] intends to introduce a registration system concerning possible TIP cases in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
This registry will be used to monitor the status of human trafficking in [LOC Iceland  ] and trends that occur in this arena . 
The general findings and statistics from this effort will be made available to [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities and international organizations . 
-- E . 
The [ORG National Register of Persons  ] is a register of all those who have been domiciled in [LOC Iceland  ] since 1952 . 
The registered items include ID number , name , domicile , citizenship , previous countries of citizenship , country of origin , etc . 
In addition , all changes to an individual 's civil status are maintained , among them birth , baptism , marital status , domicile , death , etc . 
All residents of [LOC Iceland  ] , both [MISC Icelandic  ] and foreign , are registered in the [ORG National Register of Persons  ] . 
Only tourists , whether on tourist visa or not , are not registered. --F . 
Law enforcement information is generally accessible to the government and the two sides cooperate well on combating trafficking . 
Law enforcement officials maintain records on the number of reported trafficking incidents , subsequent investigations and indictments . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] Specialist and [ORG Coordination Team for Human Trafficking  ] has access to this information and , if needed , could comprehensively assess law enforcement efforts. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS: -- A. [LOC Iceland  ] passed legislation on March 10 , 2003 specifically prohibiting the trafficking of persons . 
In December 2009 , parliament amended the legislation and updated slightly the definition of what qualifies as trafficking in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] definition of trafficking is now aligned with that of the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] . 
The government says that this will pave the way for ratification of the protocol in 2010 . 
Some experts also believe that the amended language could make convictions easier to achieve . 
The full text of [MISC Article  ] 227a of [LOC Iceland  ] 's General [PER Penal Code  ] outlawing trafficking in persons now states: Anyone becoming guilty of the following acts , one or more , for the purpose of sexually abusing a person or for forced labor or to remove his/her organs shall be punished for human trafficking with up to 8 years imprisonment: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
Procuring , removing , handing over , removing , housing or accepting someone who has been subjected to unlawful force under Art . 
225 or [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 005.3 OF 010 deprived of freedom as per Art . 
226 or threat as per Art . 
233 or unlawful deception by awakening , strengthening or exploiting his/her lack of understanding of the person concerned about circumstances or by exploiting the wretched condition of the person concerned. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Procuring , removing , handing over , housing or accepting an individual younger than 18 years of age. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Rendering payment or other gain in order to acquire the approval for the abuse from a person who has the power over the actions of another person . 
The same penalty shall be applied to a person accepting payment or other gain according to clause 3 , para . 
1 . 
If a child is violated against , as per para . 
1 , then this shall be taken into account to make the sentence more severe . 
The same penalty shall be applied to a person who is guilty of the following acts , one or more , that are intended to facilitate human trafficking: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
Falsifying travel and identification documents. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Aiding and abetting the procurement of such identification , either directly or indirectly. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Withholding , removing , damaging , or destroying the travel and identification documents of another person . 
The law covers both internal and transnational forms of trafficking . 
The government has , in the past , prosecuted trafficking-related cases under the General [PER Penal Code Articles  ] 57 and 155 , which outlaw alien smuggling and document forgery , respectively . 
-- [PER B. Trafficking  ] of persons for sexual exploitation is punishable by up to eight years in prison . 
-- [PER C. Trafficking  ] of persons for forced labor is punishable by up to eight years in prison . 
The law explicitly outlaws the confiscation of passports or travel documents . 
It also outlaws the exploitation of a person 's lack of knowledge or wretched conditions . 
( The law can be found , in its entirety , under question A of this section ) . 
-- [PER D. Rape  ] is punishable by up to 16 years in prison , but actual sentences are generally range from only one to three years' imprisonment . 
The maximum penalty for TIP violators is 8 years of imprisonment but there have been no guilty verdicts yet handed out , so actual penalties for TIP violations are unknown . 
It is not possible , at this time , to compare the actual penalties prescribed for rape violators to those prescribed for TIP violators . 
However , two current cases involving alleged TIP violators are ongoing . 
If the accused are found guilty , the actual sentences handed down by the courts would give the first indication of how penalties for these two crimes compare . 
-- [ORG E. Police  ] conducted three investigations during the reporting period . 
The government prosecuted a total of eight individuals on charges of trafficking stemming from these investigations . 
One individual was found not guilty of the trafficking charges ( although she was found guilty of profiting from prostitution as a third party and drug smuggling ) and the remaining seven indictments are still pending . 
( The full details regarding these investigations and indictments can be found in section 1 , question B ) . 
-- [PER F. Students  ] from the [ORG Icelandic National Police College  ] annually participate in classes held by the [ORG Sudurnes Commissioner of Police and Customs  ] that include instruction on recognizing and investigating human trafficking issues . 
During the reporting period , an [ORG OSCE  ] representative , who specializes in TIP issues , participated in the instruction . 
Additionally , senior [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] officials and border police have been funded by the government to attend anti-trafficking courses abroad , e.g. at the [ORG European Police Academy  ] , as well as conferences on TIP sponsored by , for example , the [ORG OSCE  ] , [ORG FRONTEX  ] , and the [ORG Nordic Council of Ministers.  ] --G . 
During the reporting period , the [ORG Sudurnes  ] police district ( that includes [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] ) cooperated with [MISC Lithuanian  ] police authorities on a prominent TIP case involving the trafficking of a young [MISC Lithuanian  ] woman . 
The [ORG Sudurnes Police  ] also [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 006.3 OF 010 cooperated with [ORG INTERPOL  ] and [ORG EUROPOL  ] on this case . 
The [MISC Metropolitan  ] police cooperated with [MISC Spanish  ] authorities on the TIP case involving a trafficking violator of [MISC Equatorial Guinean  ] descent . 
The assistance of [MISC Spanish  ] authorities became necessary when it was determined that two of the purported victims in that case were [MISC Spanish  ] citizens ( additional details regarding these two cases can be found in section 1 , question B ) . 
-- [PER H. Iceland  ] has not been asked to extradite a trafficking suspect to another country . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] law does not permit extradition of [MISC Icelandic  ] nationals , and no changes to the law are currently planned . 
-- [PER I. No  ] ; not applicable . 
-- [PER J. There  ] is no evidence of government officials being involved in trafficking , and no government officials have ever been investigated , prosecuted or convicted for such activity . 
-- [PER K. Iceland  ] does not have a military . 
However , it has deployed civilian personnel to [ORG UN  ] and [ORG NATO  ] operations as peacekeepers under the auspices of the [ORG Icelandic Crisis Response Unit  ] ( [ORG ICRU  ] ) , a division of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs . 
The [ORG MFA  ] has imposed a code of conduct for [ORG ICRU  ] personnel specifically banning involvement in TIP or the purchase of sexual services while abroad . 
There were no allegations of any such behavior by [ORG ICRU  ] personnel . 
-- [PER L. There  ] is no identified problem of child sex tourism in [LOC Iceland  ] nor are there any reports of Icelanders operating as child sex perpetrators. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU ) PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS: -- [PER A. There  ] is no specific provision in the law guaranteeing government protection to TIP victims and witnesses . 
In practice , however , the government has provided this service when the situation warrants . 
The most notable example of this occurred in the case involving a [MISC Lithuanian  ] victim ( full details regarding the case can be found in [LOC Section A  ] , part B ) . 
In that instance the victim , upon arrival , was immediately placed under 24-hour protective police surveillance . 
The victim remains under police surveillance at the end of the reporting period . 
In addition , at least one witness in the case , and a second witness in a different case , were also placed under police surveillance . 
-- [PER B. There  ] are no government-run victim care facilities that are specifically dedicated to assisting TIP victims . 
In the past , however , purported TIP victims have been received by the [ORG Women 's Shelter  ] in [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
The shelter is run independently from the government but , like most organizations in [LOC Iceland  ] , it relies heavily on government funding . 
The 2010 state budget allocates IKR 40.2 million ( $321,600 ) to the [ORG Women 's Shelter  ] . 
Foreign victims have the same access to this shelter as domestic TIP victims . 
In addition , the government has demonstrated the capacity to provide a private domicile in unique individual instances . 
This notably occurred in the case of a [MISC Lithuanian  ] trafficking victim ( full details in [LOC Section 1  ] , question A ) . 
The victim , shortly upon her arrival in country , was placed in a private domicile for safety concerns . 
The victim remains in this private domicile at the end of the reporting period . 
There is no specialized care center for male victims , however , they may avail themselves of general social services . 
The national and local governments may also refer male victims to [ORG NGOs  ] that provide food , shelter , legal advice , and health care . 
In cases involving unaccompanied children , municipal and state child protection services are responsible for assistance . 
-- [PER C. According  ] to a regulation that the [ORG Minister of Health  ] approved in December , TIP victims are now entitled to free medical care even if they are not covered by [MISC Icelandic  ] medical insurance . 
Prior to this change , trafficking victims were provided with free access to the medical system via a provision that governs general victims' protection . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 007.3 OF 010 The general victims' protection law is currently used to provide victims of trafficking with free legal services . 
Under this law , all victims are appointed a legal counsel that can guide the victim thrugh the [MISC Icelandic  ] legal process and inform victimsregarding their rights . 
This counsel can also ac as the victim 's attorney should the victim requre legal representation in court . 
There are no sychological services that are specific to trafficing victims . 
Trafficking victims , however , reguarly utilize the services of the [MISC Icelandic  ] Counseing and [ORG Information Center for Survivors of Sexul Violence  ] ( [ORG Stigamot  ] ) . 
The center is run indepedently from the government but , like most organizaions in [LOC Iceland  ] , it relies heavily on governmentfunding . 
The 2010 state budget allocates IKR 33.2 million ( $265,600 ) to [ORG Stigamot  ] . 
-- D . 
The government , through the [ORG Directorate of Immigration  ] , granted a temporary residence permit on humanitarian grounds to at least one TIP victim during the reporting period . 
This was done in the case of a 19-year-old [MISC Lithuanian  ] trafficking victim in a prominent case . 
The government also intends to present a bill to parliament in the immediate future that will create a temporary residence permit system that is specific to victims of trafficking . 
The permit will grant residency status for a six-month reflection period to any individual if there is the mere suspicion that the victim was trafficked . 
A second permit , valid for one year with the opportunity to renew , will also be made available to victims that cooperate with the government or have particularly compelling circumstances . 
-- [PER E. There  ] is no specific legal provision for long-term government assistance to TIP victims . 
Trafficking victims , however , may avail themselves of the numerous social service programs that exist in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
These programs are available to those members of society who need assistance in rebuilding their lives . 
-- [PER F. There  ] is no official referral process to transfer victims from protective custody to institutions that provide short- or long-term care . 
In practice , however , an informal system appears to be functioning effectively . 
The [ORG Women 's Shelter  ] and the [ORG Women 's Counseling Center  ] ( [ORG Stigamot  ] ) in [LOC Reykjavik  ] reported close relations with the local police force and stated that victims are generally informed by law enforcement officials regarding the social services available to them . 
While not officially transferred to the [ORG Women 's Shelter  ] or the [ORG Counseling Center  ] , victims are generally pointed in those directions . 
The anti-TIP action plan , however , calls for the formation of a more stringent referral system . 
One of the action items entitled " The Rules of Procedures for the Police , " states that the police should establish rules of procedure for contacting and dealing with alleged victims of human trafficking . 
These standardized procedures should ensure that all alleged victims are informed of the remedies available to assist them . 
-- [PER G. In  ] the three formal TIP investigations that occurred during this reporting period , there were three trafficking victims identified--one in each case . 
All of these individuals were victims of sexual exploitation and all received varying degrees of social services . 
The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] , however , does not produce official statistics regarding the total number of trafficking victims and it is possible that other victims exist . 
-- H . 
The government does not have a formal system to proactively identify victims of trafficking . 
The police , however , have received " passenger analysis " training that they employ at the airports . 
It is this technique that is , in part , credited with identifying the [MISC Lithuanian  ] trafficking victim at [ORG Keflavik International Airport  ] . 
In addition , the government is working to design a checklist for customs and law enforcement officials that can be used to assist in identifying potential trafficking victims . 
Prostitution is legal in [LOC Iceland  ] , however , the advertisement of prostitution , the purchasing of sex and profiting from prostitution [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 008.3 OF 010 as a third party are all illegal . 
There is , therefore , no legal or regulated commercial sex trade in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Those law enforcement officers who most regularly deal with the country 's illegal sex industry have received [MISC TIP-specific  ] training and are cognizant of the need to protect victims' rights . 
-- I . 
The rights of trafficking victims are generally respected . 
While no individual specifically identified as a trafficking victim was detained or jailed , it is not uncommon for alleged immigration violators or alleged violators of sex-industry laws to be detained . 
Unidentified TIP victims may have been included in those detained . 
-- J . 
The government encourages victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking . 
Victims may file civil suits or seek legal action against traffickers and there are no impediments to their access to legal redress . 
There is also no specific provision in the law to prevent a material witness in a court case against a former employer from obtaining other employment or leaving the country . 
While there is no specific restitution program for victims of trafficking in persons , such a program exists for victims of violence and may be applicable for TIP victims . 
-- K . 
The government provides its officials with TIP specific training . 
All employees of the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] received TIP training organized by [LOC Iceland  ] 's Specialist and [ORG Coordination Team for Human Trafficking  ] . 
The training was designed to underscore the importance of the trafficking problem and to increase awareness among government officials regarding the issue . 
As [LOC Iceland  ] is not a source country for TIP victims , there have been no victims assisted by [MISC Icelandic  ] diplomats and consular personnel abroad during the reporting period . 
-- [PER L. There  ] have been no such cases identified in the reporting period . 
While repatriated nationals would benefit from the same social safety net as any other [MISC Icelander  ] , there are no programs specifically for victims of trafficking . 
-- [PER M. No  ] international organizations or [ORG NGOs  ] worked with trafficking victims in [LOC Iceland  ] during the reporting period . 
As mentioned earlier , however , local [ORG NGOs  ] were active. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PREVENTION: -- [PER A. There  ] were no specific anti-TIP information or education campaigns conducted in [LOC Iceland  ] this year . 
In previous years , the government-funded Women 's [ORG Counseling Center  ] ( [ORG Stigamot  ] ) conducted information campaigns against rape and the purchasing of sexual services . 
The campaigns were targeted at men and had the goal of reducing the demand for the purchase of sexual services . 
These campaigns , however , were not utilized this year . 
According to the new anti-TIP action plan the government plans to launch a similar educational campaign in 2010 that will also be directed at the buyers of prostitution services , pornography and other kinds of sex services . 
Another stated goal of the action plan is to prepare a comprehensive educational program for professionals and for public employees who , in their work , deal with human trafficking .

The [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament approved the adoption of the first [MISC Icelandic  ] national plan of action to address TIP in March 2009 . 
The action plan is divided into the following nine chapters: <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
Ratification of international treaties and harmonization of [MISC Icelandic  ] legislation. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Specialist and co-ordination team and the supervision of affairs concerning human trafficking. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

Registration of information and intelligence gathering . 
Several of the goals recommended in the report have been enacted but the majority of them are not yet in force . 
The government hopes to have them all enacted by the end of 2012 . 
So far , the government has either achieved or made significant progress on the following goals from the national action plan: appointed the Specialist and [ORG Coordination Team  ] ; criminalized the buying of sexual services ; aligned the legal definition of human trafficking with that of the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] ( but ratification of the protocol is still pending ) ; provided TIP victims with legal counsel ; submitted a bill to parliament that would prohibit any kind of nude shows in places of entertainment ; and submitted a bill to parliament on a code of conduct that would make clear that the purchase of sex services by any [MISC Icelandic  ] Government representative will not be tolerated . 
-- E: In April , parliament passed a law criminalizing the buying of sexual services . 
While prostitution remains legal in [LOC Iceland  ] , it is now illegal to purchase sexual services , profit from prostitution as a third party or advertise prostitution services . 
Criminalizing the purchasing of sexual services was one of the goals explicitly stated in the new action plan against human trafficking . 
In addition , over the past several years , the government has taken legal measures to reduce the number of strip clubs operating in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Post sources believe this to be important as they claim that strip clubs are the predominant loci of prostitution and TIP cases . 
At the end of the reporting period , five or fewer strip clubs remained in operation in the whole country . 
Although legislation effectively outlaws strip shows , the owners of these remaining clubs were apparently able to exploit loopholes in the law on the operations of entertainment establishments to remain in operation . 
-- [PER F. There  ] have been no government actions taken to reduce the participation of [MISC Icelandic  ] nationals in international child sex tourism . 
There were no cases during the reporting period in which [MISC Icelandic  ] nationals were alleged to have participated in child sex tourism . 
-- [PER G. Not  ] applicable. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .

The government also sponsored an international symposium on human trafficking in October , the first of its kind in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [ORG OSCE  ] 's deputy TIP official participated in the symposium . 
More than 100 people attended the symposium which was sponsored by the [ORG Ministry of REYKJAVIK  ] 00000031 010.3 OF 010 Foreign Affairs and the [ORG Ministry of Justice and Human Rights  ] . 
In addition , Embassy [ORG Reykjavik  ] and [ORG G/TIP  ] organized a [ORG DVC  ] with [MISC Icelandic  ] government officials , [ORG NGOs  ] representatives , and police officials in January . 
-- B .
