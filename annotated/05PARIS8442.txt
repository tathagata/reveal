( U ) Per reftel , enclosed is the 2005 country report on terrorism for [LOC France  ] . 
Embassy point of contact is [PER Poloff Peter Kujawinski  ] , who can be reached on either the classified or unclassified e-mail systems . 
[LOC France  ] - 2005 OVERVIEW In 2005 , [LOC France  ] continued to discover and dismantle terror networks present on its soil , including several that recruited jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Following the July bombings in [LOC London  ] , [MISC French  ] officials worked closely with their [MISC British  ] counterparts . 
They also perceived a number of deficiencies in their counterterrorism capabilities , and proposed legislation to remedy these deficiencies . 
This legislation is expected to enter into force in early 2006 . 
From March on , the [MISC French  ] government has worked to draft a white book on terrorism , with publication expected by the end of the year . 
A conference in October about the white book underscored the [MISC French  ] government , s belief that terrorism is a primary strategic threat to [LOC France  ] , and that dealing with it is consequentially a central priority . 
[LOC France  ] consults extensively with the [LOC U.S.  ] on terrorism , at the tactical and strategic level . 
In general , counterterrorism cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] is excellent . 
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES [LOC France  ] continues to be an active and engaged participant in the international war against terrorism . 
On the military front , its special forces participate in counterterrorist operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and as a part of [ORG Task Force  ] 150 , a multinational naval force that patrols the [LOC Red Sea  ] and the [ORG Persian Gulf  ] to interdict the movement of suspected terrorists from [LOC Afghanistan  ] to the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] . 
In [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [MISC French  ] Mirage-2000 fighters have flown with USAF fighters to assist [MISC American  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] ground troops . 
At the political and diplomatic level , [LOC France  ] continues its engagement within the [ORG UNSC Counterterrorism Committee  ] and the [MISC G-8  ] , s [ORG Counterterrorism Action Group  ] . 
[LOC France  ] is a party to all 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism . 
[LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] continue to cooperate closely on border security issues , including aviation security and the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] . 
[MISC French  ] police and security services have been very responsive to [LOC US  ] requests . 
In addition , [LOC France  ] is active internationally in proposing bioterrorism safeguards and nuclear facility safeguards . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] continue their dialogue on nuclear security cooperation . 
On terrorism financing , [LOC France  ] continues to develop the competencies and capabilities of [LOC TRACFIN  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , s terrorism financing coordination and investigation unit . 
[LOC TRACFIN  ] has expanded the number of economic sectors it monitors within the [MISC French  ] economy , with a particular emphasis on institutions , non-governmental organizations and small enterprises suspected of having ties to [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism . 
It has also strengthened its coordination with justice and security officials . 
Within the [ORG European Union  ] , [LOC France  ] plays an active role in the [ORG Clearinghouse  ] , the [ORG EU  ] , s terrorism financing coordination body . 
[LOC France  ] has designated as terrorist groups those that appear on the [ORG EU  ] list of terrorist organizations . 
[LOC France  ] has not designated [MISC Hamas-affiliated  ] charities , such as the [MISC French-based  ] [ORG Comite  ] de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens , arguing that they have no proven links to terrorism . 
[LOC France  ] also opposes [ORG EU  ] designation of [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Hizballah  ] as a terrorist organization , though it supports [ORG Hizballah  ] 's eventual disarmament , which the [MISC GoF  ] maintains will be the result of [ORG Hizballah  ] 's gradual integration into [MISC Lebanese  ] politics . 
[MISC French  ] authorities consistently condemn terrorist acts and have made no public statements in support of a terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism issue . 
Nevertheless , [LOC France  ] , along with its [ORG EU  ] partners , retains diplomatic relations with all of the governments designated as state sponsors of terrorism , with the exception of [LOC North Korea  ] . 
It continues to cooperate closely with the [LOC United States  ] in pressing for the implementation of [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] 1559 , which targeted [MISC Syrian  ] domination of [LOC Lebanon  ] and called for the dismantlement of armed groups and militias in [LOC Lebanon  ] ( including [ORG Hizballah  ] ) and extension of [MISC Lebanese  ] government control throughout [MISC Lebanese  ] territory , to include areas under the de facto control of [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[MISC French  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] authorities have jointly made significant progress in combatting [MISC Basque  ] separatist groups , including the [ORG ETA  ] . 
[MISC French-Spanish  ] investigative teams focusing on al-Qaida-related groups and [MISC Basque  ] separatist groups continue to function . 
In the first use of the [ORG EU  ] arrest warrant for terrorism , [MISC French  ] authorities extradited [ORG ETA  ] suspect [PER Unai Berrosteguieta Eguiara  ] to [LOC Spain  ] on February 18 . 
DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES [LOC France  ] is perhaps best known for its counterterrorism police forces and judiciary . 
Within the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , the DST ( internal security service ) , RG ( police intelligence ) , DNAT ( counterterrorism brigade ) and Brigade Criminelle ( criminal investigations ) all play important roles in [MISC French  ] counterterrorism work . 
A number of organizations coordinate the activities of the counterterrorist forces , including UCLAT ( a counterterrorism coordination unit with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ) , the [ORG SGDN  ] ( attached to the office of the Prime Minister ) and the Council for [ORG Internal Security  ] ( attached to the office of the President . 
) Although there is little legislative oversight of intelligence and security agencies , [ORG Interior  ] Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] proposed in late November the creation of an oversight working group that will include members of [MISC French  ] intelligence and legislators . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] promised to submit a draft law on this issue by February 15 , <a id='par2006' href='#par2006'>¶</a>2006 . 
The counterterrorism section of the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor , s office usually leads the [MISC French  ] government , s terrorism investigations . 
Investigative judges , who in the [MISC French  ] system combine prosecutorial and judicial powers , concentrate on Islamic/international terrorism , Basque/ETA terrorism and terrorism linked to [MISC Corsican  ] separatist groups . 
Their mandate is extensive , and includes terrorist acts on [MISC French  ] soil and acts abroad that affect [MISC French  ] citizens . 
Their powers are substantial and they are given wide freedom to investigate . 
They cooperate closely with [MISC French  ] police and security services . 
In March , then-Justice Minister [PER Dominique Perben  ] announced the hiring of four additional terrorism investigating judges , along with additional support staff , bringing the number of specialized terrorism investigating judges to nine . 
[MISC French  ] police and intelligence services within the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] have extensive powers of surveillance , monitoring and detention . 
These powers were enhanced with the 2004 passage of the [PER Perben  ] II law and include expanded detention ( up to four days before charges must be brought ) , more authority for police to go undercover , warrants for searches at night , more leeway in granting document searches , and increased authority to wiretap . 
These expanded powers are to be used only in cases that involve investigation of organizations " that imperil society , " such as the mafia , drug traffickers and terrorist organizations . 
Even if government authorities are found to have misused their new powers , any evidence they have found would still be accepted in court . 
The [MISC French  ] government continues its policy of expulsions for non-French citizens engaged in activities that promote hate . 
Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] stated in August that [LOC France  ] was monitoring dozens of radical imams . 
He also announced October 4 that 19 [MISC Islamic  ] extremists had been expelled from [LOC France  ] since the beginning of the year ; 102 have been expelled since 2002 . 
In March , the [LOC CSA  ] , [LOC France  ] , s FCC-equivalent , ordered the [MISC Eutelstat  ] satellite company to cease transmitting [ORG Sahar  ] 1 , an [MISC Iranian  ] television station , because of its anti-Semitic and hate-filled broadcasting . 
Following the [LOC CSA  ] , s banning of [MISC Hizballah-affiliated Al-Manar  ] satellite television , [ORG Hizballah  ] deputies lobbied the [MISC French  ] government in 2005 to lift the ban . 
Separately , the [LOC Conseil d  ] , [LOC Etat  ] , [LOC France  ] , s highest administrative court , is reviewing an appeal by [MISC Al-Manar  ] to reinstate its broadcasting license . 
[LOC France  ] remains worried over the rise of radical [MISC Islam  ] . 
According to a November 12 press report , the [LOC RG  ] , [LOC France  ] , s police intelligence service , kept 350 places under surveillance ( including 42 [MISC Islamic  ] prayer halls and 300 businesses ) during the first seven months of 2005 because of suspicions of radical [MISC Islamist  ] activity . 
The RG estimates that , of the approximately 5 million [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC France  ] , 200,000 are practicing and of that number , between 5,000 and 9,000 are linked to extremist causes . 
[MISC French  ] officials are also concerned regarding the role of prisons in converting petty criminals to jihadism . 
Prisons served as a center of recruitment for the Safe [ORG Bourrada  ] terror network ( dismantled in late September , see below ) . 
According to statistics provided by the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] in September , 358 people are imprisoned for terrorism ; 159 are Basque-related , 94 are [MISC Islamic  ] extremists and 76 are [MISC Corsica-related  ] . 
[LOC France  ] has proposed several measures to address [MISC Islamic  ] extremism in prisons , including the establishment of a corps of moderate [MISC Muslim  ] prison chaplains . 
The July bombings in [LOC London  ] caused many [MISC French  ] officials to reexamine their counterterrorism capabilities . 
In addition to the initial reaction of elevating the Vigipirate alert system and coordinating closely with [MISC British  ] officials , the [MISC French  ] government soon proposed a new counterterrorist bill that calls for increasing video surveillance in public areas , allowing police more access to phone and [MISC Internet  ] records , and more closely monitoring international travel by ship , rail and plane . 
Under [MISC French  ] law , terrorism suspects may be detained for up to 96 hours before charges are filed . 
The new bill making its way through the legislature proposes extending the 96-hour period an additional 48 hours , for a maximum total detention of 144 hours . 
Suspects can be held for up to three and a half years in pretrial detention while the investigation against them continues . 
Other proposed measures in the bill include increasing the maximum penalty for association with a terrorist enterprise from 10 to 20 years in prison , and increasing the maximum penalty for terrorist enterprise organizers from 20 to 30 years in prison . 
The [ORG National Assembly  ] approved the bill in late November . 
The [ORG Senate  ] is expected to take up discussion of the bill in December , with probable approval in January 2006 . 
Another reaction to the July bombings in [LOC London  ] was a decision by the [MISC French  ] government to encourage the heads of its domestic intelligence agencies - RG and the DST - to take on more public roles , in order to sensitize the public to the threat of terrorism . 
In a related action , the [MISC French  ] government , in coordination with a local think-tank , opened a public website focused on the details of past terrorist acts , at https://bdt.frstrategie.org [MISC French  ] police and security officials conducted a large-scale exercise in November that simulated multiple chemical attacks throughout [LOC Paris  ] . 
Local prefectures , especially [LOC Paris  ] , have instituted PRM , a [MISC French  ] acronym for " plan red - multiple " that focuses attention on the prospect of multiple attacks , either simultaneous or sequential . 
A similar large-scale chemical attack simulation took place May 9 in the [LOC Val d  ] , [LOC Oise  ] region . 
In addition , the [LOC Paris  ] Prefecture has created a specialized [ORG NRBC  ] unit of firefighters . 
MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST ACTIONS - 2005 On January 26 , [MISC French  ] police arrested eleven people ( three of whom were eventually charged with terrorism conspiracy ) in [LOC Paris  ] , 19th arrondissement for reportedly recruiting young [MISC French  ] residents to launch terrorist attacks in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It was the first arrest since the opening in September 2004 of an investigation by the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor , s office into " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" [MISC French  ] intelligence , security and judicial authorities have consistently identified the conflict in [LOC Iraq  ] as an attractive force for [MISC French  ] jihadists . 
[MISC French  ] officials stated in November that 22 young people had left for [LOC Iraq  ] , and at least seven had been killed there , including two suicide bombers . 
[PER Djamel Beghal  ] , the ringleader of a group arrested in 2001 on suspicion of planning to bomb the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] , was convicted March 15 of " terrorist conspiracy , " and received a maximum 10-year sentence . 
His five accomplices were all found guilty as well , and received sentences ranging from one year to nine years in prison . 
The last three [MISC French  ] nationals detained at [LOC Guantanamo  ] were transferred to [MISC French  ] custody on March 7 , following the transfer of four nationals in 2004 . 
[LOC France  ] released [PER Mustaq Ali Patel  ] in March and [PER Imad Kanouni  ] in July . 
The other five remain in pretrial detention and may be charged with terrorist conspiracy . 
The former [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees , detention has withstood multiple appeals by defense lawyers . 
[LOC France  ] has been one of the most aggressive and proactive countries in prosecuting its citizens formerly held by the [LOC U.S.  ] at [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
On April 24 , [MISC French  ] police in [LOC Paris  ] arrested Said al-Maghrebi , an [LOC Afghanistan  ] training camp veteran , on suspicion of organizing potential jihadists to fight in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Four others reportedly belonging to al-Maghrebi , s network were arrested in [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Marseilles  ] . 
Two were later released . 
A [MISC French  ] court on May 16 declared five people guilty of organizing logistic support for the suicide bombers who assassinated [MISC Afghan  ] Commander [PER Ahmad Sheikh Massoud  ] on September 9 , 2001 . 
The five were sentenced to between two and nine years imprisonment . 
On May 20 , a [LOC Paris  ] court condemned [MISC Corsican  ] nationalist [PER Charles Pieri  ] to 10 years in prison for terrorism finance conspiracy and extortion . 
[MISC French  ] police arrested [PER Hamid Bach  ] on June 21 in the city of [LOC Montpellier  ] on suspicions of organizing a terrorist ring focused on attacking targets in [LOC France  ] and sending potential jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[MISC French  ] police arrested 9 people in late September on suspicion of belonging to a terrorist group . 
According to press reports , the group , reportedly led by [ORG GSPC  ] sympathizer and convicted terrorist Safe [ORG Bourrada  ] , was in the initial phases of planning terrorist attacks against targets in [LOC France  ] , including the [LOC Paris  ] Metro , [ORG Orly  ] airport and the headquarters of the DST , [LOC France  ] , s internal security service . 
Four more suspected members of the [ORG Bourrada  ] network were arrested in early October . 
On November 29 , [MISC French  ] police arrested six people suspected of financing extremist and terrorist causes . 
One of them was a prison guard and two were former [MISC Islamic  ] chaplains . 
The group reportedly had visited [LOC Bosnia  ] and attempted to recruit jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The group belonged to the fundamentalist Tabligh movement . 
[MISC British  ] authorities transferred [PER Rashid Ramda  ] to [MISC French  ] custody on December 1 . 
[PER Ramda  ] is the suspected financier of the 1995 [ORG GIA  ] attacks in the [LOC Saint-Michel  ] RER train station , the [MISC Musee  ] d , [MISC Orsay RER  ] train station and the [MISC Maison-Blanche  ] metro station . 
[PER Ramda  ] had been in [MISC British  ] custody for the last ten years , and his extradition to [LOC France  ] removes a major irritant in [MISC French-British  ] relations . 
On December 12 , [MISC French  ] police arrested approximately 25 people , in the largest terror-related sweep in [LOC Europe  ] since the aftermath of the [LOC Madrid  ] bombings in 2004 . 
Those arrested are suspected of involvement with terrorist financing . 
The reported ringleader is [PER Ouassini Cherifi  ] , a [MISC French-Algerian  ] who had spent time in prison for passport fraud . 
[MISC French  ] police suspect he , like Safe [ORG Bourrada  ] , recruited low-level criminals to his network while in prison . 
Judicial investigations following the arrests in 2003 of [MISC German  ] national [PER Christian Ganczarski  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] national [PER Karim Mehdi  ] continued in 2005 . 
[PER Ganczarski  ] and [PER Mehdi  ] , who are suspected of ties to al-Qaida , remain in pretrial detention in [LOC France  ] . 
The judicial investigation into the activities of six suspected members of the [ORG Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group  ] ( [ORG GICM  ] ) arrested in 2004 continues . 
The six suspects are being held in pretrial detention and are thought to have provided logistical support to those who committed the attacks against [LOC Madrid  ] trains on March 11 , 2004 . 
Investigations into the " [MISC Chechen  ] network , " a loose grouping that is reported to have links with the [PER Beghal  ] network and the [LOC Frankfurt  ] network ( which attempted in 2000 to attack cultural sites in [LOC Strasbourg  ] , including the cathedral ) have concluded , although a trial date for those arrested has not been set . 
Members of the [MISC Chechen  ] network reportedly were interested in using chemical agents to commit terrorist attacks . 
Several suspected members of the [MISC Chechen  ] network were arrested in [LOC France  ] in 2005 . 
[LOC Corsica  ] continues to experience low-level terrorist activities . 
Recent attacks have occurred against peoples of [MISC North African  ] ancestry . 
The [ORG FLNC Union of Combatants  ] claimed responsibility for firing a rocket on September 29 at the prefecture in [LOC Ajaccio  ] . 
The rocket attack did not cause any injuries , although it exploded a few meters from where the prefect and a receptionist were working .
