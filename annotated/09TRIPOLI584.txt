REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Your visit to [LOC Libya  ] will set the tone and agenda for the bilateral relationship over the next several months . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials seek clarification of the [ORG Administration  ] 's policy toward [LOC Libya  ] , especially after their mishandling of the [PER Fathi  ] al-Jahmi case , and are unsure of the degree of engagement they can expect . 
They continue to complain that [LOC Libya  ] has not been adequately " rewarded " for previous policy decisions to give up its [ORG WMD  ] programs and support for terrorism , yet they are remiss in meeting key [ORG WMD  ] deadlines . 
You can lay out the path toward increased engagement in the wake of the new [LOC Washington  ] consensus and press for real progress . 
Potential deliverables from the visit include: a statement announcing the intention to engage in a [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] and a [ORG Political-Military Dialogue  ] with high-level State officials ; [LOC Libya  ] 's signing of the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] transfer agreement ; formation of a visas working group to discuss bilateral visa problems ; and setting a date to sign a [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIFA  ] ) . 
You can also privately raise the notion of establishing a [ORG Civil-Nuclear Dialogue  ] , incumbent upon [ORG GOL  ] signing of the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] transfer agreement . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] will be looking for a concept of how we envision conducting the human rights dialogue and assurances regarding the possibility of a meeting between POTUS and [PER Qadhafi  ] on the margins of [LOC UNGA  ] . 
They will also continue to press for security assurances . 
End Summary . 
PRESSING [LOC LIBYA  ] TO FULFILL ITS [ORG WMD  ] COMMITMENTS 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOL  ] has been credited with having largely met its [ORG WMD  ] commitments ; however , the recent track record is worrisome and suggests that it may be deliberately delaying implementation of commitments it has undertaken under the rubric of the [ORG U.S.-U.K.-Libya Trilateral Steering and Coordination Committee  ] ( [ORG TSCC  ] ) . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has delayed since November 2007 signing a [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] agreement for the return of spent nuclear fuel ( the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] agreement ) ; delayed signing a parallel [MISC Russia-Libya  ] agreement ; and given no details on plans to sell its uranium yellowcake stockpile . 
If work on the spent nuclear fuel transfer to [LOC Russia  ] is not completed by September 30 , 2009 , the [ORG Department of Energy  ] 's work to complete the program may be delayed for upwards of two years . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has also delayed the implementation of its commitments under the [ORG Chemical Weapons Convention  ] ( [ORG CWC  ] ) to destroy its remaining stockpile of declared chemical weapons ( approximately 25 MT of mustard agent and 860 MT of chemical agent precursor chemicals ) . 
The deadline established by the [ORG CWC Conference  ] of the [ORG States Parties  ] for the destruction of [LOC Libya  ] 's mustard stockpile is December 31 , 2010 ; destruction of the remaining inventory of precursor chemicals is to be completed no later than December 31 , 2011 . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A proposed visit by ISN DAS Mitman in late June to discuss [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG WMD  ] obligations and rewards was scrapped at the eleventh hour when the [ORG GOL  ] failed to issue visas to the delegation . 
[ORG GOL  ] interlocutors recently blamed the Prime Minister for slow-rolling on [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG WMD  ] commitments . 
A [ORG GOL  ] official told the [ORG DCM  ] that the Foreign Minister planned to address the issue with [PER Qadhafi  ] and that he understood that inaction by the Prime Minister-equivalent , who still views renewed bilateral relations with suspicion , is detrimental to the relationship . 
Post believes the [ORG GOL  ] is slow-rolling , in part , as leverage against a guarantee to discuss security assurances . 
We urge you to press your interlocutors on the need to expeditiously sign the agreement , linking that action ( the signing of the [ORG HEU  ] shipments ) to any future discussions regarding cooperation in the civil nuclear field and a [ORG Civil-Nuclear Dialogue  ] . 
ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES: [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE  ] 4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a recent meeting with the Ambassador , FM-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] expressed agreement on behalf of the [ORG GOL  ] to launch a [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] , whereby the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG GOL  ] would discuss sensitive human rights issues - in both a general and specific sense - and provide a forum for joint-action in the human rights sphere . 
You should lay out for the FM a concept of how we envision the dialogue and get agreement for the official launch of the dialogue next month by a team of USG officials . 
MFA A/S-equivalent [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] has hinted that the [ORG GOL  ] may press for inclusion of the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] as part of a broader strategic dialogue . 
The meeting with [PER Musa Kusa  ] may be the appropriate venue to publicly announce our intention to initiate the human rights dialogue . 
VISAS AND NSEERS 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Post began full nonimmigrant visa operations for [MISC Libyans  ] in April . 
Since that time , we have issued over 1000 non-immigrant visas to [MISC Libyans  ] with wait times that range from a [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000584 002.2 OF 003 few days to several weeks due to [ORG Security Advisory Opinion  ] requirements . 
The [ORG GOL  ] continues to adhere to restrictive visa issuance policies vis-a-vis [MISC Americans  ] , including an apparent virtual ban on tourist visas for [MISC Americans  ] , lengthy delays and exorbitant fees for [MISC American  ] business people , and a long record of visa refusals for [MISC USG-sponsored  ] visitors for academic , cultural , science , economic , and other programs . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has agreed , in principle , to the idea of forming a bilateral visa working group to resolve these issues , including visa reciprocity . 
During a July 6 meeting with the Ambassador , [PER Musa Kusa  ] maintained that visas for [MISC Americans  ] would continue to receive the most scrutiny of any foreign visitors to the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] , for security reasons . 
Your underscoring for the [MISC Libyans  ] that the current imbalance in visa issuance is not sustainable will show your interlocutors that the issue has been raised to high levels in [LOC Washington  ] . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) An ostensibly related issue involves the treatment of [MISC Libyan  ] travelers at [LOC U.S.  ] ports of entry , particularly [MISC Libyan  ] officials , who are routinely separated from other passengers at ports of entry and questioned extensively about their travel . 
[ORG GOL  ] officials , who view the issue as a personal affront , will raise it with you . 
[PER Musa Kusa  ] and [ORG UNPermREP Shalgham  ] are only two of the several high level [MISC Libyan  ] officials who have been " mistreated " at our ports of entry , and their experiences have engendered deep resentment here . 
Your recent letter to [ORG DHS  ] described the issue well ; we believe that we will not be able to make significant process on visa reciprocity until we make some headway here . 
A [ORG DHS  ] delegation is scheduled to visit [LOC Tripoli  ] in late July to address treatment of [MISC Libyan  ] officials at [LOC U.S.  ] ports of entry/NSEERS issues with [ORG GOL  ] counterparts , among other issues . 
However , the [ORG GOL  ] has not yet granted visas to the delegation . 
TRADE AND INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG USTR  ] has been working with the [ORG GOL  ] to finalize a [ORG TIFA  ] text for over a year . 
The [ORG GOL  ] last invited Emboffs to review the draft text on November 24 , 2008 . 
Despite post 's attempts to discuss [ORG TIFA  ] with [MISC Libyan  ] trade officials at every possible opportunity , the text has languished on the [MISC Libyan  ] side . 
We would like to press the [ORG GOL  ] to sign a [ORG TIFA  ] as soon as possible . 
We concur with [ORG USTR  ] view that the signing should take place even in light of renewed problems regarding [ORG Caterpillar  ] and potential problems involving the [ORG Chevrolet  ] dealership . 
We may have a better hand to play on these issues when we can argue them out in this formal framework . 
[ORG MEGRAHI  ] 8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [PER Megrahi  ] case is likely to be an agenda item for your interlocutors . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] raised the issue during his July 9 meeting with [ORG UK PM Gordon Brown  ] , and recent press reports suggest that [PER Megrahi  ] 's physical condition is deteriorating ( although the [ORG UK Embassy  ] was not able to corroborate such reports during a July 19 meeting with the [ORG CDA  ] ) . 
If the issue is raised , we recommend that you remind [MISC Libyan  ] officials that the decision to allow a [ORG Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] ( [ORG PTA  ] ) for [PER Megrahi  ] is a matter for the [ORG Scottish Government  ] to decide . 
[ORG UK Embassy  ] officials believe that a [ORG PTA  ] decision could be forthcoming in mid-August . 
We defer to the Department 's view on a possible request for [PER Megrahi  ] 's compassionate release . 
[ORG REGIONAL ISSUES  ] 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While [LOC Libya  ] 's regional focus at present seems to have concentrated primarily on its pan-African agenda , [PER Qadhafi  ] has skillfully leveraged the [ORG AU Chairmanship  ] to ingratiate himself with [MISC European  ] and [MISC South American  ] leaders - most recently [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] . 
His visits to [LOC Moscow  ] , [LOC Madrid  ] , [LOC Paris  ] , [LOC Lisbon  ] , and [LOC Rome  ] have afforded him opportunities to sign military-to-military agreements and to engage on civil-nuclear issues , as well as to negotiate commercial energy and investment deals . 
He has even exploited [ORG EU  ] , especially [MISC Italian  ] , concerns about illegal immigration to press forward his security and political agendas . 
As [PER Qadhafi  ] 's engagement as an [MISC African  ] leader has expanded , he has notably decreased his efforts in the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
Nevertheless , he continues to tout his vision for a one-state solution between the [MISC Israelis  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] - " Isratine " - including during his May meeting with [ORG AFRICOM Commander General Ward  ] . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] will appreciate anything you can relate regarding the work of Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] and how we see Administration policy playing out in the peace process . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000584 003.2 OF 003 [MISC POTUS-QADHAFI  ] MEETING 10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The desire on the [MISC Libyan  ] part for a [MISC POTUS-Qadhafi  ] meeting at [LOC UNGA  ] in [LOC New York  ] is palpable . 
In our discussions here , we have implicitly linked a " good atmosphere " for that meeting to [MISC Libyan  ] agreement on the human rights dialogue . 
With their assent to that proposal and the handshake in [LOC L'Aquila  ] , the [MISC Libyans  ] will seek assurances that the meeting will happen . 
To the extent you can bring any further clarification on that , the more warmly you will be welcomed by your interlocutors . 
BUILDING A HOME BASE 11 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) On the embassy front , we have experienced significant personnel changes , and the new team is settling in nicely . 
We are disappointed that the move of the entire embassy to the villa site has been pushed back by several weeks , but we are looking forward to the time when the mission will be united . 
We have a good LES staff , but they have not been fully integrated into the embassy ethic given the distance between the two sites . 
12 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) We continue to need high-level engagement from the [ORG GOL  ] to facilitate our efforts to purchase a property for a [ORG New Embassy Compound  ] ( [ORG NEC  ] ) and close the deal on compensation for our seven [LOC U.S.  ] properties here in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
You may want to remind [MISC Libyan  ] officials that a [ORG New Embassy Compound  ] will be an important symbol of our growing relationship . 
You may also want to seek the Prime Minister 's assistance in resolving outstanding payments due under the compensation agreement for our seven properties . 
The [ORG Land Registry Office  ] claims that it has not received funds to implement the agreement , while the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] claims that the [ORG Land Registry Office  ] has the funds . 
We believe the Prime Minister 's intervention will be needed to resolve this standoff .
