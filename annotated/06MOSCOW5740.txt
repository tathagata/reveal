( C ) SUMMARY . 
Adding fuel to already intense speculation about who will succeed him , President [PER Putin  ] confirmed to state media May 13 that he will endorse a candidate before the March 2008 election . 
Both Kremlin-connected and independent analysts believe [PER Putin  ] 's choice will be driven by a desire to ensure his physical and financial security , to maximize the likelihood of continuity in his policies , and to preserve the current political system , in which he is the final arbiter of disputes among rival groups ( a role he likely intends to play even after leaving office ) . 
Our contacts generally think [PER Putin  ] will consult about possible successors with his closest advisers but make the final decision alone , without involving elites outside the [LOC Kremlin  ] or relying heavily on public opinion surveys , as former President [PER Boris Yeltsin  ] did . 
The conventional wisdom remains that First Deputy Prime Minister [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] and Deputy Prime Minister/Defense Minister [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] are the two front-runners , but other horses of varying shades of darkness are believed to be at least potentially in the running . 
[PER Putin  ] 's interest lies in prolonging uncertainty to avoid a premature slippage of power away from him and toward a perceived successor , but that uncertainty encourages competitive jockeying for position among the candidates and a feeding-frenzy among those who fear their snouts could soon be torn from the trough . 
END SUMMARY . 
. 
HELPING [LOC RUSSIA  ] BY HELPING HIMSELF --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Most of our contacts take for granted that [PER Putin  ] 's own physical and financial security and social status post-2008 loom large in his succession calculations . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that financial considerations would drive [PER Putin  ] 's thinking . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed , describing the [MISC Russian  ] presidency as a business and saying that [PER Putin  ] 's decision on a successor would be based on his sense of who would best be able to protect the wealth he and his associates had acquired . 
Equally important to [PER Putin  ] , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , is preserving the elite-based political system in which ad hoc interest groups vie for political clout and control over economic resources , with [PER Putin  ] as the ultimate arbiter . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Putin  ] feared the system would collapse without him at its center , and therefore intended to remain active behind the scenes while leaving day-to-day governance to his successor . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed , saying that preserving the current balance of power among competing elite groups was of great importance to [ORG Putin.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Putin  ] needs to choose a strong successor who is not beholden to any one group and who has already amassed a personal fortune during [PER Putin  ] 's tenure . 
Such a figure , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , would have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo in order to protect his own wealth and standing . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] disagreed , arguing that a strong successor would inevitably side with one group or another , and succumb to the temptation to crush his rivals . 
Such a turn of events would not only disrupt the precarious balance of clans and lead to a redistribution of assets , but also undermine [PER Putin  ] 's role as arbiter of the competing groups . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered another perspective , saying that a succession candidate 's " strength " or " weakness " would be of only secondary interest to [PER Putin  ] ; the overriding criterion would be loyalty to [PER Putin  ] personally . 
. 
[ORG PUTIN LISTENING  ] , BUT WILL DECIDE ALONE -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Many of our contacts believe that , having weakened all his potential rivals and atomized the elite , [PER Putin  ] will be able to make the choice of his successor alone , without needing to consult extensively with political and economic elites to ensure their support . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expects [PER Putin  ] to discuss the issue informally with his closest advisers , but to reveal his final decision to them only shortly before going public , in order to maintain strict secrecy . 
The broader elite and the general public would learn of [PER Putin  ] 's decision simultaneously . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] concurred , saying [PER Putin  ] would consult only a handful of close advisers , including [PER Medvedev  ] , [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] , and Deputy [ORG PA  ] head [PER Igor Sechin  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expected that on questions of succession , [PER Sechin  ] 's opinion would carry more weight than [PER Medvedev  ] 's or [PER Ivanov  ] 's , because [PER Putin  ] would consider that as possible successors , the latter two could not give disinterested advice. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Asked whether [PER Putin  ] , by not consulting more broadly , would not risk alienating those whose financial resources and media outlets would be central to ensuring a smooth succession , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted that the elites , on hearing the name of [PER Putin  ] 's preferred successor , would fight each other to be first to pledge allegiance to his choice . 
If elite opinion mattered to [PER Putin  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added pointedly , former [ORG Yukos  ] CEO [PER Mikhail Khodorkovskiy  ] would still be free . 
Instead , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , [PER Putin  ] was confident elites have learned from the [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] case the severe consequences of defying the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed , saying that despite real divisions within the elite , there remains a profound corporate interest in maintaining the existing contours of political and economic power , and that can best be done by falling in line behind [PER Putin  ] 's choice , whoever it may be. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Given how extensively former President [PER Yeltsin  ] 's team used public opinion polls to identify an electable successor , many have assumed [PER Putin  ] would do the same . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , however , told us the [LOC Kremlin  ] would not poll to determine what qualities the public wants to see in [LOC Russia  ] 's next president , since the results would be meaningless: respondents in such a poll would simply describe [PER Putin  ] when asked what their ideal president would be like -- reversing the pattern from 1999 , when respondents listed as desirable qualities those that the deeply unpopular [PER Yeltsin  ] lacked [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also argued that the [LOC Kremlin  ] 's control over major media outlets would not be sufficient in itself to build a mass following for a presidential candidate -- the key to winning public support would be to find a way to " resonate with the public , " as [PER Putin  ] did when he gave an emotional speech in September 1999 in response to a series of apartment bombings that had terrorized the population . 
Until that point , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , even daily television coverage had only modestly improved [PER Putin  ] 's popularity rating. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] disagreed , arguing that the [LOC Kremlin  ] has sufficient administrative and media resources to ensure that the public votes " correctly " in 2008 . 
Taking a different tack , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us public opinion could be an important variable if the electorate were actively engaged , but he did not expect it to be mobilized for this election . 
Voters -- like the elites -- would primarily be interested , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought , in maintaining the higher standard of living they have attained under [PER Putin  ] , and would see [PER Putin  ] 's chosen successor as the best available insurance policy . 
FIVE WHO ARE THOUGHT TO BE ALIVE -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Upwards of thirty names have appeared in the [MISC Russian  ] press as possible successors to [PER Putin  ] , but [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us she believes [PER Putin  ] has now narrowed the field to five: First Deputy Prime Minister [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] , Deputy Prime Minister/Defense Minister [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] , [ORG Presidential Administration  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) head [PER Sergey Sobyanin  ] , [MISC Russian  ] Railways CEO [PER Vladimir Yakunin  ] , and head of the Government apparatus [PER Sergey Naryshkin  ] . 
Nearly all analysts see [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Ivanov  ] as the clear front-runners at this stage , and most of our contacts describe [PER Sobyanin  ] , [PER Yakunin  ] , and [PER Naryshkin  ] as at best " reserve " candidates . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] dismissed the theory that [PER Putin  ] was using [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Ivanov  ] as " red herrings " to distract attention from the " real , " as yet unidentified , successor , saying that [PER Putin  ] is serious about making [PER Medvedev  ] or [PER Ivanov  ] [LOC Russia  ] 's next president . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] concurred , noting that [PER Putin  ] has nothing to gain by choosing a less-familiar figure to succeed him . 
Those seeing the succession as a two-horse race are divided as to whether [PER Putin  ] will endorse [PER Medvedev  ] or [PER Ivanov  ] , with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] positing a " power-sharing " scenario in which one would serve as president and the other as prime minister . 
[PER Medvedev  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Medvedev  ] 's long-standing loyalty to [PER Putin  ] , his administrative skills , his propensity for hard work , and his potential to benefit if the " national projects " that he supervises are successful are among his qualifications for the presidency . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Medvedev  ] would respect [PER Putin  ] 's wishes and work to maintain the existing balance among rival elite groups , which would make his selection acceptable to all key power elements . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said [PER Medvedev  ] 's administrative skills were widely underestimated . 
Citing his [LOC Kremlin  ] contacts , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG PA  ] had run more efficiently under [PER Medvedev  ] than now under [PER Sobyanin  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who said [PER Medvedev  ] was his own choice for president , described him as dedicated , hardworking , and skilled in management . 
( NOTE: In addition to his duties as First Deputy Prime Minister , [PER Medvedev  ] directs the implementation of the national projects , is chairman of the board of [ORG Gazprom  ] , is responsible for coordinating [LOC Russia  ] 's response to avian flu , and since mid-May has chaired a government commission on bringing digital television to [LOC Russia  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Medvedev  ] nonetheless has challenges to overcome . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us [PER Medvedev  ] does not come across as " presidential " on television or in public , although she noted that he has nearly two years to strengthen his image . 
The camp of [ORG PA  ] Deputy Head [PER Igor Sechin  ] , which is still trying to convince [PER Putin  ] to remain in office beyond 2008 , poses another challenge to [PER Medvedev  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Sechin  ] 's camp is trying to discredit both [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Ivanov  ] in order to convince [PER Putin  ] to seek a third term . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Medvedev  ] lost a recent battle when [PER Fradkov  ] ( who is allied with [PER Sechin  ] ) was given control of the [ORG Customs Service  ] , which had previously been subordinated to [PER Medvedev  ] 's frequent ally , Minister of [ORG Economic Development and Trade German Gref  ] . 
[PER Sergey Ivanov  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Ivanov  ] has [PER Putin  ] 's trust , is widely regarded as a patriot and pragmatist , comes across as presidential , and has proven politically resilient in the face of recurrent criticism , including from within the military establishment . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Ivanov  ] is regarded as a more effective administrator and bureaucratic player than [PER Medvedev  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Ivanov  ] had demonstrated his ability to weather political attacks over the last year , as his popularity rating had not been affected by the [PER Sechin  ] camp 's efforts to tarnish his image by exploiting cases of military hazing , using the [ORG Main Military Prosecutor  ] to highlight the high rate of crime in the armed forces , and publicizing the fact that [PER Ivanov  ] 's son had run over and killed an elderly pedestrian . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Putin  ] 's May 10 address to the legislature gave [PER Ivanov  ] a boost by highlighting improvements in military capability , innovation , and morale. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Our contacts note that [PER Putin  ] and others could perceive some of [PER Ivanov  ] 's strengths as weaknesses . 
For instance , while many say that [PER Ivanov  ] is not corrupt ( at least in relative terms ) , some of [PER Putin  ] 's close advisers reportedly see that as a threat , since they do not know how to " do business " with such a person . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Putin  ] may also see [PER Ivanov  ] 's leadership skills as a potential threat to the balance of forces among elites , and potentially to [PER Putin  ] 's own continued influence . 
[PER Yakunin  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] probably considers [PER Vladimir Yakunin  ] 's long-standing friendship and business experience his best qualifications for the presidency , according to our contacts . 
[PER Yakunin  ] shares [PER Putin  ] 's KGB background , and they first met in the 1990s in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] . 
[PER Yakunin  ] has thus far generally avoided the public spotlight , and ( according to a close supporter ) hopes [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Ivanov  ] will fall short of [PER Putin  ] 's expectations in the run-up to 2008 ( ref A ) . 
Our contacts generally consider [PER Yakunin  ] a fallback candidate who would probably remain loyal to [PER Putin  ] after taking office , but could have difficulty forging ties with the political and economic elites and the general public . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Yakunin  ] was " too exotic and strange " to become president , citing [PER Yakunin  ] 's close and secretive relationship with the hierarchy of the [MISC Russian  ] Orthodox Church , his reported ties to [PER Fidel Castro  ] and [PER Lyndon Larouche  ] , and his involvement in organizations like the Center for the [ORG National Glory of Russia  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed , saying [PER Yakunin  ] was generally seen as an " outsider " in the elite , notwithstanding his ties to [PER Putin  ] . 
[PER Sobyanin  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Sobyanin  ] is thought by some to be a potential successor because of his loyalty to [PER Putin  ] and apparent lack of ambition . 
He recently visited [LOC London  ] at [PER Putin  ] 's direction , providing the beginnings of an international profile . 
In [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's view , [PER Putin  ] could feel confidentthat [PER Sobyanin  ] , if elected , would continue to defer to him . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Sobyanin  ] 's lack of ambition was one reasonPutin had felt comfortable bringing him into the [ORG PA  ] . 
( Note . 
The basis for the judgment by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that [PER Sobyanin  ] lacks ambition , rather than has veiled ambition , is not clear . 
End Note ) Among [PER Sobyanin  ] 's liabilities , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , was that he I " one-dimensional " and comfortable only when dealing with regional affairs . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [PER Sobyanin  ] lacks a public platform that would help him build support among voters and , despite a good reputation as governor of [LOC Tyumen  ] , he was proving an ineffective manager in the [ORG PA  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us [PER Sobyanin  ] had been charged with overseeing the drafting of the annual state of the nation address that [PER Putin  ] had presented May 10 , but [PER Putin  ] had been so dissatisfied with the early drafts that he took over the speechwriting process himself . 
Others have painted [PER Sobyanin  ] 's role in the production of the speech in more positive terms . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought [PER Putin  ] would not be comfortable making [PER Sobyanin  ] president , given their relatively brief connection . 
[PER Naryshkin  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Sergey Naryshkin  ] 's name has recently begun surfacing with greater frequency in the media and in conversations with our contacts ( ref B ) , but he continues to be regarded as at best a long-shot for president . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Naryshkin  ] , who worked with [PER Putin  ] in the KGB , is a junior partner to [PER Fradkov  ] , who has used him to attack [ORG Gref  ] and Minister of Finance [PER Aleksey Kudrin  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Naryshkin  ] dutifully follows instructions from [PER Putin  ] and [PER Fradkov  ] in the hope of becoming [PER Putin  ] 's successor , or at least to be Minister of [ORG Economic Development and Trade  ] in the next president 's administration . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described [PER Naryshkin  ] as an " interesting " figure and cautioned against underestimating his chances . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed , saying that [PER Naryshkin  ] is a capable , detail-oriented official whose loyalty to [PER Putin  ] is undisputed . 
. 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's list of five " live " candidates is not , in our judgment , definitive . 
Given [PER Putin  ] 's tendency to make surprise personnel decisions and the unforeseeable political issues that could arise before March 2008 , other potential successors may emerge . 
Moreover , although we believe [PER Putin  ] does plan to leave office in 2008 , that is at most a present intention . 
If as 2008 approaches he is not persuaded of the viability of any of the succession candidates , particularly if it appears that [LOC Russia  ] will face difficult domestic or international circumstances , [PER Putin  ] could still decide to remain in power , and would likely have little trouble in arranging to do so . 
XXXXXXXXXXX told us a third-term scenario was still on the table in the [LOC Kremlin  ] , although only as a fall-back option. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Our expectation , however , remains that [PER Putin  ] will step out of the Presidency in 2008 . 
We concur that , in choosing the person he wants to succeed him , he will be motivated to protect his wealth and security ( e.g. , from prosecution ) and to ensure his continuing political influence and social status after leaving office . 
We believe he will also reject any succession candidate who he suspects might steer [LOC Russia  ] away from his policy " legacy . 
" Those factors suggest he will choose a successor in whom he has a high degree of personal and political trust and who he sees as at least competent as an administrator and politician . 
We share the judgment that he has a relatively free hand in his choice , with the political class and broader public ready , at least initially , to defer to his judgment within broad limits. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Views differ on how involved [PER Putin  ] plans to be in day-to-day governance after 2008 . 
Unlike [PER Yeltsin  ] in 2000 , [PER Putin  ] will leave office at a relatively young age , in good health and with very high public support . 
If he wants a highly operational " behind-the-scenes " role , that could incline him to opt for a successor whom he saw as easy to control . 
If he envisions , on the other hand , a " stand-back " post-2008 role in which he would engage only on strategic issues ( a la [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] , a model that our counterparts in the [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy claim to find germane ) , that could be reflected in a choice of a more dynamic and capable successor expected to act with substantial autonomy . 
Obviously , the degree to which any successor -- having won popular election and received at least the externalities of power -- would long be content to administer day-to-day affairs while allowing [PER Putin  ] to direct the real course of policy from behind the scenes is open to question. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) We also agree that last fall 's appointments of [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] to the government put them in front-runner positions . 
While some ( [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) argue that [PER Medvedev  ] is likely to get the nod for the presidency with [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] as his prime minister , we do not see compelling evidence for that conclusion . 
An at least equally strong argument , we believe , could be made in favor of [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] as president and [PER Medvedev  ] as prime minister , given [PER Putin  ] 's demonstrated trust in [PER Ivanov  ] and the likelihood that , in a world seen to be full of external challenges to [LOC Russia  ] , a " silovik " with experience in the [LOC KGB/FSB  ] , as head of the [ORG Security Council  ] , and as Defense Minister and manager of the [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005740 005 OF 005 military-industrial complex would be seen as best prepared and most credible as head of state. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] 's present interest lies in leaving such issues unresolved , to prevent the initiation of a shift of power away from him and towards any perceived successor . 
The uncertainty that is beneficial to him , however , feeds competition among possible ( or at least self-perceived ) candidates jockeying for position , and encourages a feeding-frenzy among those currently in high positions who fear their snouts could soon be torn from the trough .
