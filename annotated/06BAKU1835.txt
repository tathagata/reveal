A recent anti-Azerbaijani editorial which appeared in the [MISC Iranian  ] newspaper [PER Jomhouri Eslami  ] ( reported incorrectly in the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] press as having been written by Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] ) appears to be driving much of the [ORG GOAJ  ] 's concerns .

This will impact our ability to work with the [ORG GOAJ  ] on a range of issues ; we need to address their concern . 
End Summary. ------------------------ President [PER Aliyev  ] on [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a 23 November one-on-one meeting with the Ambassador , President [PER Aliyev  ] raised in stark terms his view that USG and the international community 's policy on [LOC Iran  ] has " failed " and that [LOC Iran  ] is " confident , comfortable , and unconstrained . 
" [PER Aliyev  ] said that he " does not understand USG policy " in response to this situation , adding that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has affirmed he has " burned his bridges " on the nuclear issue and warned [PER Aliyev  ] directly that [LOC Iran  ] will " attack from where it is attacked . 
" [PER Aliyev  ] said he believes it is " always possible [LOC Iran  ] will do something against us " ( ref a ) and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's policy must be to minimize potential risks to itself . 
Also as reported earlier , [PER Aliyev  ] 's Foreign Policy Advisor ( ref b ) and Foreign Minister [PER Mammadyarov  ] have voiced similar concerns . 
In a December 14 one-on-one meeting , Foreign Minister told the Ambassador again that [LOC Iran  ] is planning various scenarios to respond to heightened tensions or military action , which [LOC Azerbaijan  ] believes will include a provocation against [MISC Azerbaijani  ] interests on the [LOC Caspian  ] , where the international legal framework remains unclear. ------------------------------------ Foreign Minister [PER Mammadyarov  ] on [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a December 14 one-on-one meeting with the Ambassador , Foreign Minister [PER Mammadyarov  ] said that recent [MISC Iranian  ] activities ( the fueling of demonstrations in [LOC Nardaran  ] with respect to the anti-Islam article published in Sanat , recent demonstrations in front of the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] Consulate General and Embassy - ref c ) are intended to " send a message to us that they won't wait " while [LOC Azerbaijan  ] moves towards [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC US  ] , and on a possible resolution of the [ORG Nagorno Karabakh  ] conflict . 
He pointed to a recent statement by Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] that " [LOC Azerbaijan  ] should not feel comfortable with respect to [ORG NATO  ] , " saying [LOC Iran  ] is " watching our policy in this area very carefully . 
" In addition , he said [LOC Iran  ] " doesn't want us to make a move towards conflict resolution because they know the conflict is the only serious problem " facing [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , and that if continued it keeps [LOC Azerbaijan  ] off base and under pressure . 
He also said that [LOC Russia  ] 's and [LOC Iran  ] 's positions on this are very close. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Mammadyarov  ] repeated what he had told the Ambassador some months ago , that the [MISC Iranians  ] are developing different " scenarios " for how they will react if the [LOC US  ] or [LOC Israel  ] [ORG BAKU  ] 00001835 002.2 OF 003 increase the pressure on [LOC Iran  ] over the nuclear issue . 
[PER Mammadyarov  ] feels that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is a " target " for [LOC Iran  ] if there is the possibility of military action against [LOC Iran  ] , which [LOC Iran  ] " definitely " sees as being on the table . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] thinks that a provocation of some kind on the [LOC Caspian  ] will be [LOC Iran  ] 's likely approach because whatever overt step [LOC Iran  ] takes , it will want to be within the framework of international law , [PER Mammadyarov  ] said . 
There is no agreement on [LOC Caspian  ] delimitation , the international legal framework is murky and " that is where [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is vulnerable . 
" However , [PER Mammadyarov  ] also said that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] believes [LOC Iran  ] is preparing scenarios for responses with respect to [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and " even in [LOC Syria  ] . 
" [LOC Iran  ] is " afraid of the [MISC Taliban  ] " and hence slow to consider any steps in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] may also create difficulties with respect to its land border with [ORG Nakhchivan  ] ( stopping buses , for example ) , with the aim of turning the population against the [ORG GOAJ  ] and provoking " social problems " in [ORG Nakhchivan  ] like those in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
According to [PER Mammadyarov  ] , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is planning to build a railroad from [ORG Nakhchivan  ] through [LOC Igdir  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , as the next stage of the [MISC Kars-Alkhakhalaki-Tbilisi  ] railroad in order to keep [ORG Nakhchivan  ] from being cut off by [LOC Iran  ] this way. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Mammadyarov  ] feels that [LOC Iran  ] does not want [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to make a move on [MISC N-K  ] resolution because the withdrawal of [MISC Armenian  ] troops from [MISC Azerbaijani  ] territory will make [LOC Azerbaijan  ] stronger in the region . 
[PER Mammadyarov  ] believes that [LOC Iran  ] does not want [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , as a secular [MISC Muslim  ] country , to succeed as a model . 
Poverty in the ethnic [MISC Azeri  ] provinces in the north of [LOC Iran  ] is " like the middle ages " and as people travel back and forth from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to [LOC Iran  ] the contrast is evident . 
[PER Mammadyarov  ] argued that it is in [LOC Iran  ] 's national interest to see the conflict continue , and , hence , the [MISC Iranian  ] government is exerting increased pressure at any sign of steps towards a resolution. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Speaking to the role of religion , [PER Mammadyarov  ] asserted that [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is more a matter of " tradition " than ideology . 
[LOC Iran  ] started playing with religion with the Sanat article and in [LOC Nardaran  ] , hoping for a " uprising " from the people . 
When this did not succeed , [PER Mammadyarov  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] 's next step was the demonstrations at the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] Embassy and Consulate General ( ref b ) . 
He argued that [LOC Iran  ] 's aim is to portray the Government of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] as bad Muslims , poor followers of [MISC Islam  ] . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] is going to continue its westward orientation , cooperation with [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC US  ] but " without rhetoric to the public , " [PER Mammadyarov  ] said . 
In [LOC Brussels  ] , President [PER Aliyev  ] made clear that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] will " continue and deepen our cooperation with [ORG NATO  ] , " moving to the second phase of its [ORG Individual Partnership Action Plan  ] ( [ORG IPAP  ] ) . 
[PER Mammadyarov  ] said that President [PER Aliyev  ] believes greater cooperation with [ORG NATO  ] and a greater [ORG NATO  ] presence and involvement in the region will bring predictability and stability . 
He said [PER Aliyev  ] was " very happy " with paragraph 43 of the [ORG Riga Summit  ] statement ; its language on regional conflicts was a " clear message to everyone north , south , east and west of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] ; " and , it helps him push back on those of his advisors who question what [LOC Azerbaijan  ] gains from cooperation with [MISC NATO.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] 's Alleged [MISC Anti-Azerbaijan Comments  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A recent anti-Azerbaijani article which appeared in [PER Jomhouri Eslami  ] , a conservative [LOC Tehran  ] daily , appears to have played a key role in raising concerns about [LOC Iran  ] within senior [ORG GOAJ  ] circles . 
The [MISC Azerbaijani  ] press ( to include the opposition newspaper [ORG Azadliq  ] ) quoted Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] as having made numerous threats against [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , even claiming [LOC Azerbaijan  ] to be part of [LOC Iran  ] , characterizing it as " [ORG Northern Iran  ] " ( a pointed dig at [MISC Azerbaijanis  ] who refer to [MISC Azeri-populated  ] areas of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] as " [ORG Southern Azerbaijan  ] " ) . 
In fact , the [PER Jomhouri Eslami  ] article widely disseminated in the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] press was an editorial piece , not an article either written by or quoting the Supreme Leader . 
While critical of the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] government ( focusing on issues such as the Sanat article and closer ties with the [LOC US  ] ) , the original editorial did not threaten [LOC Azerbaijan  ] in as dire terms as suggested by the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] media with reported quotes such as " we would like to remind politicians in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] that the [ORG IRI  ] has adequate power to realize the historic will of the people . 
" ------- [LOC BAKU  ] 00001835 003.2 OF 003 Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Given the complex relations between [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , heated accusations in the press - and even overt threats by [LOC Iran  ] - are not uncommon . 
The most recent bilateral spat occurred in March 2006 , when [LOC Iran  ] accused the [ORG GOAJ  ] of supporting regime change by hosting in [LOC Baku  ] a world congress of [MISC Azerbaijanis  ] ( including " [MISC Southern Azerbaijanis  ] " who roundly criticized the [ORG IRI  ] during the conference ) . 
However , President [PER Aliyev  ] 's and Foreign Minister [PER Mammadyarov  ] 's recent statements to the Ambassador reveal increasing levels of [ORG GOAJ  ] concern about [MISC Iranian  ] intentions and [ORG USG  ] policy toward [LOC Iran  ] . 
Embassy contacts have also noted that the level of [MISC Iranian  ] rhetoric is sharper than in the past ( although their views likely are based on the somewhat erroneous [MISC Azerbaijani  ] press coverage of [MISC Iranian  ] editorials ) . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] at the most senior levels has communicated to us its in stark terms concern about implications for [MISC Azerbaijani  ] security of the current situation in [LOC Iran  ] , and their desire to better understand [ORG USG  ] policy to address it - and its implications . 
This will impact our ability to work with the [ORG GOAJ  ] on a range of issues ; we need to address their concern . 
We also note that the [ORG GOAJ  ] has regular and broad contacts with [MISC Iranian  ] officials and [PER Aliyev  ] and his key advisors , if engaged in regular dialogue , can provide us useful insights on [MISC Iranian  ] officials and intentions as seen from [LOC Baku  ] . 
The [ORG Department 's  ] guidance on how to respond to [PER Aliyev  ] 's concerns is requested .
