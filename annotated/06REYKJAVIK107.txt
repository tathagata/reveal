( C ) [MISC Summary: Since  ] 3/15 , when the [LOC U.S.  ] announced the realignment of its force presence at [LOC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) , the [MISC Icelandic  ] government has made its unhappiness with the decision plain . 
FM [ORG Haarde  ] ) the government , s key decision maker ) is looking to the 3/31 talks to offer the sort of specificity that will enable him to tell his party and his public that the [MISC Americans  ] are serious about their commitment to the 1951 Defense Agreement . 
Our readiness to offer concrete and credible proposals in the series of defense talks with [LOC Iceland  ] will strengthen [ORG Haarde  ] , s preference ( and that of pragmatic bureaucrats and rising young politicians and other opinion leaders ) to seek continued close security ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] Eed summary. ---------------------- UNANTICIPATED DECISION ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] is just now coming to terms with the news delivered March 15 that the [LOC U.S.  ] would be removing its four [MISC F-15  ] fighter jets as well as combat search and rescue ( [ORG CSAR  ] ) assets from [ORG NASKEF  ] . 
Governing Independence ( [ORG IP  ] ) and Progressive ( [ORG PP  ] ) Party luminaries seemed genuinely shocked that the [LOC U.S.  ] would take this step without further negotiations or a long drawdown calendar . 
There have been a flurry of party meetings and town hall , meetings with residents of the [LOC Sudurnes  ] region ( where the base is located ) , and the subject has been discussed in ministerial calls on Allied foreign ministers ( [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] ) and [LOC Russia  ] , s foreign minister . 
The Prime Minister has appealed to the [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General . 
Although there has been plenty of criticism from the opposition that the government should have seen this decision coming , the governing coalition , s complete lack of contingency planning indicates its leaders assumed they would have much more time to prepare the country. ---------------------- REACHING OUT TO EUROPE ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In response to what many interpret as [LOC U.S.  ] rejection , [ORG Reykjavik  ] is showing new interest in cooperation with the [MISC Europeans.  ] &I think it is clear that in the future , [LOC Iceland  ] will move closer to [LOC Europe  ] and farther away from the [LOC United States  ] on foreign-policy issues , 8 PM [PER Asgrimsson  ] told [PER Morgunbladid  ] in late March . 
Influential Social [MISC Democratic Alliance Chairman  ] [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] said it would be natural for [LOC Iceland  ] to rely for defense cooperation on countries bordering on the [MISC North Atlantic:  ] the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , and [LOC Norway  ] . 
[ORG Haarde  ] himself is building bridges to [LOC Europe  ] but not burning any with the [LOC U.S.:  ] he is enough of a realist to know that [MISC European  ] governments are unlikely to offer more than sympathetic noises , and that any [MISC European  ] offers of defense equipment are likely to be on a purely commercial basis. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) At the same time , a current of resentment against the [LOC U.S.  ] has also been flowing ( reftels ) . 
The sudden &unilateral8 ( to repeat a word embraced these past two weeks by politicians , pundits , and citizens alike ) decision , coming in the course of what ministers had presented to the public as ongoing negotiations , is being painted as evidence of [LOC U.S.  ] egotism and arrogance ) even by opposition politicians happy to see the base close , and ordinary citizens with no particular interest in the base or even the broader concept of national defense. ---------------- PLAYING CATCH-UP ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Only fully independent since 1944 , [LOC Iceland  ] has little experience looking out for itself ) or , set in a more negative light , little sense of answerability for its own well-being. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Some in the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government ( e.g . 
FM [ORG Haarde  ] and chief defense negotiator [PER Albert Jonsson  ] ) are nervous that the [LOC U.S.  ] , with limited strategic interest in maintaining any sort of presence here , will quietly bow out of the 1951 Agreement ( refs A and D ) . 
Others ( e.g . 
PM [PER Asgrimsson  ] and Justice Minister [PER Bjarnason  ] ) , feeling betrayed by the style and substance of decisions already announced , no longer trust us to meet our responsibilities under the treaty ( refs G and H ) . 
A third faction ( which we believe includes former [MISC PM/FM  ] [PER David Oddsson  ] as well as other [ORG Independence Party  ] stalwarts of his generation ) believes [LOC Iceland  ] should react to the [LOC U.S.  ] decision by abrogating the treaty themselves and seeking security elsewhere in the [MISC Alliance  ] ( ref D ) . 
And then there is the pacifist left ( personified by [ORG Left Green Party  ] Chairman [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] ) , which never believed the [LOC U.S.  ] was a good mate for [LOC Iceland  ] and has been only too happy to crow , &We told you so8 ( ref B ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] and [ORG Haarde  ] have reacted quite differently to the [LOC U.S.  ] decision , both in public and private . 
The PM has strongly criticized the pace and unilateral character of the [LOC U.S.  ] action , expressing skepticism that the [LOC U.S.  ] will offer serious alternatives to a full-time [LOC U.S.  ] presence . 
In contrast , [ORG Haarde  ] ( in the job for only a few months , and with his ego tied less tightly to past government defense policy ) has taken a more measured tone , expressing regret while focusing on the need to listen with an open mind to [LOC U.S.  ] proposals and seek to maintain the security relationship . 
[ORG Haarde  ] has been out of the country much of the time since the announcement , which has resulted in [MISC Icelandic  ] media giving more play to [PER Asgrimsson  ] , s tough talk than to [ORG Haarde  ] , s forward-looking focus. --------------- GETTING SERIOUS --------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Within this cacophony is a core of career diplomats and bureaucrats sincerely interested in a practical [MISC U.S.-Icelandic  ] partnership to confront the challenge of providing national security in the 21st century . 
[ORG MFA Political  ] Director [PER Bergdis Ellertsdottir  ] and Defense Director [PER Jon Egill Egilsson  ] , as well as Justice [ORG Ministry Legal  ] Director [PER Ragna Arnadottir  ] and [ORG Coast Guard  ] Director [PER Georg Larusson  ] , are all serious professionals who know that banging their fists on tables will not prevent a terrorist attack or save a drowning sailor. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Though the working levels of the ministries have been kept out of the information loop of late ( ref D ) , they will be present at the March 31 talks . 
Some among them have even told us that they are excited to be present at the creation , , to have their ideas on defense actually influence their nation , s program choices as [LOC Iceland  ] inevitably develops a more independent security policy . 
We anticipate that their relatively pragmatic and worldly approach will ultimately prevail , in part because a rising generation of MPs , local mayors , and other decision makers share their pragmatic approach to security cooperation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Icelanders  ] , who lived on a subsistence economy until the last half century but now enjoy one of the world , s highest standards of living , are above all practical people . 
When they face the fact , as they must do soon , that other Allies are not going to leap in to replace the defense goods and services thus far supplied by the [LOC U.S.  ] , they will sign on for a new , more evenly balanced course of cooperation . 
We can make this evolution easier if we: -- Offer concrete proposals for follow-on security programs , of the sort now being worked by [ORG OSD  ] , Joint Staff , and [ORG EUCOM  ] , that provide a &visible defense presence.8 Exercises , rotational deployments , and enhanced information/intel sharing will also make a strong impression . 
-- Follow up the March 31 meetings with a series of detailed proposals responsive to [PER Icelanders  ] , concerns as expressed in our face-to-face meetings . 
-- Remain attentive to domestic political imperatives . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] decision to keep some CSAR helicopters here until the middle of September came as an enormous relief to [PER Icelanders  ] scrambling to arrange for interim and long-term SAR capability . 
Justice Minister [PER Bjarnason  ] said March 24 that he aimed to propose an interim [MISC Icelandic  ] SAR plan within three weeks and a long-term plan within two months . 
The [PER Icelanders  ] will be very interested in the information we supply at the talks on FMS options . 
Whether or not [LOC Iceland  ] decides to buy [MISC American  ] ( and it might make sense for them to simplify maintenance by buying more of the [MISC Eurocopter Puma  ] or Dauphins they already fly ) , we must be prepared to put forward some serious options . 
Continuing our efforts to be helpful to local base employees who are losing their jobs will also pay dividends in public goodwill . 
-- Initiate public and private links such as the proposed [MISC Burns  ] op-ed and periodic telephone calls . 
These public manifestations of sustained [ORG USG  ] interest in [LOC Iceland  ] , s fate would smooth the way for a mutually-beneficial follow-on deal . 
-- Encourage them to get educated ) and to accept that they too have responsibilities for security . 
Even with the [LOC U.S.  ] remaining its defense guarantor , as a wealthy country and member of [ORG NATO  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] will have to pay towards its defense , and its officials will finally need to do their homework on security affairs so as to be educated consumers . 
This means reiterating longstanding offers to welcome [PER Icelanders  ] to [LOC U.S.  ] service academies , war colleges , and the [ORG Marshall Center  ] ) but also making clear that other forms of cooperation will be contingent upon their developing their own security expertise . 
-- Finally , we should remain unruffled by calls for closer [MISC European  ] security ties , making it clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not feel threatened by [MISC Icelandic  ] calls for closer security ties with [LOC Europe  ] , either in a [ORG NATO  ] or [ORG EU  ] context . 
Indeed , we welcome burden sharing .
