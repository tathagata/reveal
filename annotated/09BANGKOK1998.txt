( C ) Summary and comment . 
The disappointing August 11 [ORG Thai Lower Court  ] ruling against the extradition of [MISC Russian  ] arms trafficker [PER Viktor Bout  ] , and its dubious legal reasoning , requires a multi-pronged effort to seek a successful reversal during the appeals process . 
The lead judge’s foray into foreign policy , rejecting the terrorism label and in effect embracing the FARC’s activities as purely political in nature , not criminal or acts of terrorism , has implications for [LOC Thailand  ] . 
His confusion of the “dual criminality” concept with jurisdictional issues similarly raises questions for efforts by [LOC Thailand  ] to extradite fugitive former PM Thaksin to face justice . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] is working with [MISC Thai  ] authorities to file an appeal of the lower court’s ruling and to press home the implications of the court ruling were [PER Bout  ] to walk free . 
In the early afternoon on August 13 , we were assured that the notice of intention to appeal has been filed. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At the same time , the [ORG Embassy  ] recommends the [ORG State Department  ] , Attorney General [PER Holder  ] , and the [ORG US Mission  ] to the [ORG UN  ] in [LOC New York  ] engage the [MISC Thai  ] Ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] and the [MISC Thai  ] PermRep in [LOC New York  ] in parallel . 
In addition , the [ORG Department should  ] seriously consider asking [LOC Belgium  ] , which issued an arrest warrant for [PER Bout  ] in 2002 for money laundering and conspiracy , [LOC Colombia  ] , in the case of the [ORG FARC  ] , and [MISC African  ] countries which have suffered greatly from [MISC Bout’s  ] arms trade in the past to weigh in with the [ORG RTG  ] . 
Finally , we recommend consideration of laying down a marker in [LOC Moscow  ] about [PER Bout  ] , looking forward to the possibility that [PER Bout  ] may end up back in [LOC Russia  ] were the appeal of the [ORG Lower Court  ] ruling might not succeed . 
End Summary and comment . 
[ORG Thai Lower Court  ] rules against [PER Bout  ] extradition --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On August 11 , the judge in the [PER Viktor Bout  ] extradition case ruled against [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Thai  ] government efforts to extradite [PER Bout  ] to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Two key elements of his reasoning were: that the [ORG FARC  ] in [LOC Colombia  ] , to which [PER Bout  ] was conspiring to send weapons , was a political rather than a terrorist group ; and that the “dual criminality” standard of our extradition treaty with [LOC Thailand  ] had not been met since [PER Bout  ] could not be prosecuted in [LOC Thailand  ] on the charges which the [LOC U.S.  ] wants him to face in the [LOC U.S.  ] In our view , the judge was wrong on both counts. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) After the verdict , as the [ORG Department has  ] seen , the [ORG DCM  ] spoke on the record to press outside the court room and expressed disappointment and mystification over the ruling and stated that we would fully support [ORG RTG  ] efforts to appeal the decision . 
We have continued the same themes in subsequent interactions with the press . 
Engaging the [MISC Thai  ] immediately ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador called Foreign Minister [PER Kasit  ] immediately after the verdict on August 11 and expressed deep disappointment , noting that the verdict was not justified on legal grounds and that the judge had clearly been in error on several key points . 
He reminded [PER Kasit  ] that over the past year and a half since [MISC Bout’s  ] arrest in [LOC Bangkok  ] , the [ORG USG  ] had repeatedly underlined the importance of the case , all the way up to the Secretary of State and POTUS levels . 
In the short-term , the Ambassador told [PER Kasit  ] , we need the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] to do its part in forwarding the necessary documentation to the Attorney-General’s office so that the intent to appeal can be filed in the requisite forty-eight hours . 
( Note: Although the court’s ruling and a new extradition law specify that the appeal must be filed within 72 hours , the applicable extradition law sets forth the shorter time frame , which we have followed . 
) [PER Kasit  ] assured the Ambassador that he had already instructed his legal department to do so . 
The Ambassador also told [PER Kasit  ] that we expected [PER Bout  ] would remain in detention during the appeals process . 
The [ORG MFA’s Legal  ] and [ORG Treaties Department  ] faxed the Attorney General’s office late evening August 11 supporting the appeal ; at the request of the Office of the Attorney General , the [ORG Embassy  ] sent a diplomatic note to the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG OAG  ] on August 13 requesting that the [ORG RTG  ] appeal the lower court verdict prior to the forty-eight hour deadline ( note: the [ORG RTG  ] was closed August 12 for a National Holiday , the [ORG Queen’s Birthday  ] . 
) At approximately 1:25 p.m. on August 13 , the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG OAG  ] advised the [ORG Embassy  ] that the requisite notice of intention to appeal had been filed and received by the court . 
Next steps ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Embassy’s  ] “Bout team” met August 13 to review next steps that will help us prevail on appeal . 
Our immediate priority was to ensure that the notice of intent to appeal was filed on time ( within 48 hours of the verdict ) and that the appeal itself is filed within thirty days of the verdict. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We will make clear to the [ORG RTG  ] that we expect [PER Bout  ] to remain incarcerated during the appeals process , as specified under [MISC Thai  ] law and the August 11 court ruling . 
Given that the same judge will rule on any bail motions brought by [PER Bout  ] ( we expect [MISC Bout’s  ] attorneys to push hard on bail ) , however , his custody status during the pendency of the appeal is a genuine concern . 
We also intend to make clear to the [MISC Thai  ] government ( the Ambassador is seeking to call FM [PER Kasit  ] , in [LOC Malaysia  ] August 13-14 on a working visit , and will engage the highest available [ORG MFA  ] official in [LOC Bangkok  ] ) that we expect this deficient ruling to receive a comprehensive and meaningful review by the appellate court . 
Moreover , the Ambassador plans to tell [PER Kasit  ] and other senior [MISC Thai  ] officials that , given that the [MISC Thai  ] government arrested [PER Bout  ] and sought his extradition to the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [MISC Thai  ] government should be as alarmed by the judge’s ruling as we are . 
Therefore , we would encourage the [ORG RTG  ] to issue a public statement expressing disappointment in the judge’s decision , its intention to win on appeal , and a reiteration of Thailand’s commitment to both the struggle against international terrorism and to its extensive law enforcement relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The Ambassador intends to make similar points to newly appointed [ORG NSC  ] Secretary General Tawee and to key figures at the Palace . 
Without being counter-productively heavy-handed , we will make clear that we see [MISC Thai  ] executive branch reaction to the ruling as a test of the relationship. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) At the same time , however , we believe it is important to remember that our partners in the [ORG Royal  ] [MISC Thai  ] Police , the Office of the Attorney General , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , and even the [ORG Royal  ] [MISC Thai  ] Navy , largely did everything we asked them to do on the [PER Bout  ] case , including going the extra mile to facilitate our requests . 
Our posture and actions thus should make clear that we are disappointed with the judge’s ruling but not with [MISC Thai  ] government cooperation in the [PER Bout  ] case. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) That said , coming on the heels of the September 2008 [MISC Thai  ] appellate ruling affirming a lower court’s denial of our request to extradite [MISC Iranian  ] [PER Jamshid Ghassemi  ] , who was in [LOC Thailand  ] to procure controlled technology in violation of the [ORG Arms Export Control Act  ] , the question has to be asked whether we can count on the [MISC Thai  ] courts to do the right thing on high-profile extradition cases that will affect Thailand’s relations with third countries ( we continue to have a perfect record on routine extraditions from [LOC Thailand  ] to the [LOC United States  ] ) . 
Our reluctant conclusion is that we cannot. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Department  ] will recall that in February of this year , after significant indications that the [MISC Russians  ] were trying to use bribes to influence the outcome of the case , the Ambassador made representations to Prime Minister [PER Abhisit  ] ( reftel ) that we expected the process to be free of inappropriate influence and [PER Abhisit  ] undertook to do so . 
The [LOC BANGKOK  ] 00001998 003 OF 004 Ambassador also intervened at the same time with Defense Minister [PER Prawit Wongsuwan  ] and the [ORG Royal Thai Naval  ] Commander [PER Khamtorn Pumhiran  ] to insist that false testimony by [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( that [PER Bout  ] had been in [LOC Thailand  ] as part of a routine naval procurement ) be rebutted . 
The [MISC Thai  ] Navy subsequently issued a letter to that effect . 
We will remind the Thais of their commitment to a clean process and ask that they assure us again on the front . 
What We are Doing here/What We Suggest [LOC Washington  ] Do --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Given the above , we are undertaking the following steps here in [LOC Bangkok  ] , most of which should also be reflected when the [ORG Department  ] calls in [MISC Thai  ] Ambassador [PER Don Pramuwinai  ] , a move we fully support: -- The Ambassador will immediately seek a meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Kasit  ] and other appropriate senior [MISC Thai  ] officials to make clear that , while we appreciate the cooperation on [PER Bout  ] over the past year and a half , we are disappointed and mystified by the judge’s ruling , which is flawed on several key points . 
-- In particular , the judge’s characterization of the [ORG FARC  ] as a legitimate political actor would suggest that insurgent groups in southern [LOC Thailand  ] are likewise political in nature , perhaps outside the scope of Thailand’s new counterterrorism laws . 
The ruling also suggests that anyone seeking to send them arms from a third country could not be extradited to [LOC Thailand  ] on political grounds . 
-- Moreover , the judge’s misguided analysis of the “dual criminality” standard suggests that fugitives cannot be extradited from [LOC Thailand  ] unless a [MISC Thai  ] court actually had jurisdiction over the alleged crime , not whether the alleged conduct is viewed as criminal conduct under the laws of both countries . 
This decision comes at the same time [LOC Thailand  ] is pursuing extradition of fugitive former PM [PER Thaksin Shinawatra  ] for abuse of power/corruption-related charges ; the judge’s ruling would also seem to undermine [ORG RTG  ] positions in their [PER Thaksin  ] extradition effort . 
-- Therefore , we expect that the AG’s office will vigorously pursue the appeal of the ruling and that [PER Bout  ] will remain incarcerated during the pendency of the appeal . 
-- We seek assurances that the case will be afforded a comprehensive and meaningful appellate review , presumably handled by serious , experienced [MISC Thai  ] judges . 
( Note: Appeals are normally handled by a panel of three judges . 
End Note . 
) -- We ask that the [MISC Thai  ] government issue a statement making clear its own disappointment with the judge’s ruling and reiterating its commitment to the fight against international terrorism and to the law enforcement relationship with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
-- We will continue to make our points to the press and we are pulling together a “FARC fact sheet” for public distribution that we will send in to [LOC Washington  ] for comment and clearance today. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) We suggest that [LOC Washington  ] strongly consider the following actions: -- In addition to the [ORG Department  ] calling in the [MISC Thai  ] Ambassador , we recommend that Attorney General [PER Holder  ] also call him in . 
[PER AG Holder  ] could point out the extensive [LOC U.S.  ] commitment of law enforcement resources to [LOC Thailand  ] ( [ORG DEA  ] and other ) , as well as our judicial training efforts , and that a statement from the [ORG RTG  ] as outlined above would be very helpful as the [LOC U.S.  ] decides where best to commit its law enforcement resources around the world . 
A senior [ORG DEA  ] official might also wish to sit in to highlight the massive [ORG DEA  ] commitment to [LOC Thailand  ] . 
( Note: Our [MISC DOJ Attache  ] who has led our legal efforts on [LOC Bout  ] here will be in [LOC Washington  ] on August 20-21 . 
End Note . 
) -- Discussion of a [ORG POTUS  ] telcon to PM [PER Abhisit  ] has been under way for some time ; they have not spoken in the seven months both have been in office . 
We suggest that the call be accelerated and that it include a serious discussion of our concerns over the implications of the [LOC Bout  ] verdict , as outlined above . 
We believe [ORG POTUS  ] involvement on [LOC Bout  ] would have significant effect here . 
-- We suggest [LOC Washington  ] engage the [MISC Colombian  ] government on [LOC BANGKOK  ] 00001998 004 OF 004 the implications of the [LOC Bout  ] verdict . 
We suggest inquiring whether [LOC Colombia  ] considers the [ORG FARC  ] to be a terrorist organization , whether it would be willing to submit a brief in the appeals process , and also make public statements to that effect . 
We also suggest exploring whether [LOC Colombia  ] would be willing to ask [LOC Thailand  ] for [MISC Bout’s  ] extradition while he ( hopefully ) is still in detention during the appeals process . 
( Note: There is no [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Bangkok  ] ; the [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Kuala Lumpur  ] covers [LOC Thailand  ] . 
We understand the Thais cover [LOC Colombia  ] from their [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Lima  ] . 
End note . 
) It would be useful if the Government of [LOC Colombia  ] also raised its concerns in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
-- We also suggest exploring the possibility of whether governments whose citizens have borne the bloody results of [MISC Bout’s  ] activities over the years , such as [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , [LOC Liberia  ] and [LOC Congo  ] , would be willing to publicly express dismay/engage the [MISC Thai  ] government on the verdict and whether any affected government would be willing to ask for his extradition . 
-- While the [MISC Bout  ] focus is now on [LOC Thailand  ] , this is at heart a [MISC U.S.-Russian  ] matter . 
The [ORG Department  ] may wish to make clear to [LOC Moscow  ] our concerns on [MISC Bout’s  ] activities and seek assurances that they will cease . 
Also , we should consider asking the [MISC Russians  ] to prosecute [MISC Bout  ] if , in the end , he walks here in [LOC Thailand  ] . 
At the very least perhaps we could force the [MISC Russians  ] to publicly refuse to do so . 
-- The [MISC Thai  ] ruling seems inconsistent with several [ORG United Nations  ] determinations on [MISC Bout’s  ] nature over the years ( see below ) . 
We suggest our [ORG USUN  ] call in the [MISC Thai  ] [ORG Permrep  ] and lay out how we view the issues in terms of Thailand’s standing with the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
Better yet would be for the appropriate [ORG UN  ] official to call in the [MISC Thai  ] [ORG Permrep  ] and seek an explanation of how the verdict can be justified in light of Thailand’s support of relevant [ORG UN  ] resolutions: - [ORG UNSCR  ] 1521 ( 2003 ) - [LOC Liberia  ] - [ORG UNSCR  ] 1343 ( March 2001 ) - [LOC Liberia  ] - Report of Experts Panel under 1343 - Final Monitoring Report on [LOC Angola  ] Sanctions ( 2000 ) -- Finally , despite the listing by the [LOC US  ] and [ORG EU  ] of the [ORG FARC  ] as a terrorist organization , we understand that the [ORG FARC  ] is not listed as such by the [ORG UN  ] . 
A move to have the [ORG FARC  ] listed formally by the [ORG UN  ] would assist the effort to keep [PER Bout  ] in custody .
