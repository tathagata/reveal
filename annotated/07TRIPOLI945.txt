End summary . 
GOL: NO PUBLIC REACTION ( YET ) 2 . 
( C ) In a conversation with P/E Chief November 4 , MFA Secretary for the [ORG Americas Dr.  ] [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] characterized the SIPDIS announcement as " a serious threat " . 
He indicated that senior levels of the [ORG GOL  ] 's leadership , including FM [MISC Shalgham  ] , ESO Chief [PER Musa Kusa  ] and Prime Minister [PER Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi  ] , were discussing whether the [ORG GOL  ] should issue a public statement reacting to the announcement . 
He suggested that there was disagreement within the [ORG GOL  ] as to whether it was prudent to react publicly , saying some favored a statement while others feared it would lend further credibility to [MISC AQ-LIFG  ] in the eyes of the [MISC Libyan  ] people . 
[PER Fituri  ] expressed the belief that the [ORG GOL  ] would ultimately issue a statement of some kind , but cautioned that it might not occur " right away " . 
ELITES CONCERNED .. . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) xxxxxxxxxxxx ( strictly protect ) , xxxxxxxxxxxx and a well-connected insider from a prominent [LOC Benghazi  ] tribe ( xxxxxxxxxxxx ) , told P/E Chief November 5 that Libyans' reactions to the announcement varied depending on their socioeconomic status . 
The elite , he said , remember the [ORG LIFG  ] 's insurgency in the 1990 's and its attempts to assassinate Moammar al-Qadhafi , and are concerned that a call to topple the regime premised on an explicitly religious message akin to that of [PER Zawahri  ] and [ORG LIFG  ] leader [PER Abu Laith  ] al-Libi , would find a receptive audience among the many [MISC Libyans  ] who have not benefited from recent economic liberalization and development , regardless of whether they share al-Qaeda and the [ORG LIFG  ] 's stated desire for an [MISC Islamic  ] caliphate . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The elites' principal concern , according to xxxxxxxxxxxx , is to protect the sanctity of their personal economic fiefdoms in the event the [ORG LIFG  ] makes a serious run at toppling al-Qadhafi 's regime . 
Mentioning that he had been at a dinner party with [PER Qadhafi  ] 's wife , [PER Safia Farkash  ] , xxxxxxxxxxxx , he said she was " concerned " that economic reforms championed by her son and heir apparent , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , had exacerbated resentment of the [PER Qadhafi  ] family and other elites who had profited disproportionately from recent initiatives to open [LOC Libya  ] 's economy . 
Much of the dinner conversation apparently centered on how to balance calls for economic reform against the fact that attendant inflation and increased living costs were hurting average [MISC Libyans  ] , many of whom depend on static state salaries. .. . 
BROADER REACTION MORE VARIED 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) By contrast with the elite , who viewed news of the merger with concern , xxxxxxxxxxxx said " a significant number " of [MISC Libyans  ] welcomed the announcement . 
He cautioned against interpreting such support as a sign that most [MISC Libyans  ] are fundamentalist Muslims or are sympathetic to the idea of establishing an [MISC Islamic  ] caliphate , although he conceded that more conservative iterations of [MISC Islam  ] were enjoying a resurgence in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Rather , the level of dissatisfaction with [PER Qadhafi  ] 's family and regime is such that some [MISC Libyans  ] are willing to support any alternative perceived to be viable in the hope that the next regime will be less oppressive . 
6 . 
( C ) A sampling of non-elite [MISC Libyans  ] revealed a variety of opinions . 
A hotel employee expressed concern that political violence would adversely affect [LOC Libya  ] 's oil and gas industry , impacting government revenues and the state 's ability to pay its many public sector employees , and then whispered that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's TRIPOLI 00000945 002.2 OF 002 government was " terrible " . 
A bus driver who plies inter-city routes and the [MISC Tripoli-Tunis  ] run noted that while [PER Qadhafi  ] 's regime had been the cause of " deprivation " for many [MISC Libyans  ] for a long time , the economic situation -- particularly with respect to the availability of consumer goods -- had recently begun to improve . 
He expressed concern that an [MISC Islamist  ] government under [MISC AQ-LIFG  ] auspices would roll back recent economic changes , saying that while the ( political ) reasons would be different , the effect would be to drag [LOC Libya  ] back to the stagnation of the sanctions era . 
The assistant imam at the xxxxxxxxxxxx , who declined to give his name , told P/E chief November 6 that the announced merger had been the subject of much discussion on the margins of prayer times . 
He would not offer his personal views on the news , but conceded that " some " ( NFI ) congregants had received word of the announcement " with enthusiasm " . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment: Like many things in [LOC Libya  ] , reaction to news of the [MISC AQ-LIFG  ] merger has been an exercise in slow-motion . 
While regime insiders are predictably concerned , the more varied reaction of average [MISC Libyans  ] underscores the existence of a certain degree of support for [MISC AQ-LIFG  ] . 
The more difficult question is the extent to which that support derives from genuine affinity for an [MISC Islamist  ] agenda as opposed to a desire to be rid of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's regime , whatever the cost . 
End comment .
