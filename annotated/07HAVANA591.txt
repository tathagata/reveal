<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L HAVANA 000591 SIPDIS SIPDIS E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 06/19/2017 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/PINR_0.html'>PINR</a> <a href='/tag/CU_0.html'>CU</a> SUBJECT: [PER RAUL  ] CASTRO'S WIFE [PER VILMA ESPIN  ] DIES Classified By: COM [PER Michael Parmly  ] ; Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) The [MISC Cuban  ] regime has announced that [PER Vilma Espin  ] , wife of acting [MISC Cuban  ] dictator [PER Raul Castro  ] , died on Monday , June <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
The regime has declared Tuesday , June 18 , a day of mourning . 
[PER Espin  ] is one of the matriarchs and charter members of the [MISC Cuban  ] revolution , and without there ever being any public role for [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's wives or concubines , has served by default as a kind of first lady . 
Some biographical highlights: -- Born April 7 , 1930 in [LOC Santiago  ] ; -- Studied chemistry at [ORG MIT  ] in the early 1950s ; -- In the mid-1950s was part of the urban guerrilla movement associated with [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's " 26 of July " organization ; -- Married [PER Raul Castro  ] in 1959 , in the first year of the [PER Castro  ] dictatorship ; -- Founded the [ORG Federation of Cuban Woman  ] ( [ORG FMC  ] ) in 1960 , a communist mass organization and instrument of totalitarian rule ; -- Has been a member of the [ORG Politburo , Council of State  ] , and the [ORG National Assembly  ] ; clearly the highest ranking woman in all these organizations. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Espin  ] has been terminally ill for the past two years and out of public view . 
Her death serves as a dry run for the other much-more-anticipated deaths in the ruling family , in terms of logistics and choreographed funeral activities . 
[LOC Havana  ] has some roads closed off on June 19 , most likely in areas through which the funeral procession will pass . 
Remembrance activities have been scheduled in various provinces around the country , along with a full-scale propaganda barrage . 
The message beamed out to [LOC Cuba  ] and the world is that [PER Vilma Espin  ] was a heroic and loyal follower of [PER Fidel Castro  ] and the revolution , and only secondarily [PER Raul Castro  ] 's wife and member of the ruling family. -------- COMMENT: -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although we doubt [PER Fidel Castro  ] cares very much about the loss of [PER Vilma Espin  ] , or much else beyond his own personal legacy , we expect that her death will have a significant impact on [PER Raul Castro  ] . 
Yes , both [PER Fidel  ] and [PER Raul Castro  ] are mass murderers and cruel leaders , but [PER Raul  ] always has had a parallel reputation as a family man . 
He and [PER Vilma Espin  ] were , much more than [PER Fidel  ] and any of his partners , the ones concerned about the [PER Castro  ] family as a family . 
Some reporting from when [PER Fidel Castro  ] became incapacitated last July indicated that [PER Raul Castro  ] suffered from depression , caused by the parallel terminal illnesses of his brother and wife , and much more the latter than the former . 
For long stretches of time he stayed completely out of public view . 
[PER Raul Castro  ] and [PER Vilma Espin  ] were reported to have been estranged over the years , but not entirely . 
[PER Raul Castro  ] could lose his bearings over [PER Espin  ] 's death , and return to that same kind of private detachment , leaving [LOC Cuba  ] even more leaderless than has been the case during the past few months as [PER Fidel Castro  ] has become more and more active .
