( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's Foreign Minister flatly dismissed opposition calls for an independent inquiry into suspected [ORG CIA  ] rendition flights through [LOC Iceland  ] in a parliamentary session on February 28 . 
The question time discussion was spurred by [ORG Icelandic State Television  ] 's February 25 broadcast of a [MISC Danish  ] TV documentary about rendition flights through [MISC Danish  ] territory . 
In answering , the [ORG FM  ] noted that the government 's stated intent to inspect suspected rendition flights has been lauded as an example for [LOC Denmark  ] and other governments to follow . 
The [ORG FM  ] 's comments were her strongest public statement to date that no further investigation of the issue is necessary . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On February 25 , [ORG Icelandic State Television  ] ( [ORG RUV  ] ) broadcast the [MISC Danish  ] DR1-TV documentary " [ORG CIA  ] 's [PER Danske Forbindelse  ] , " which alleges that CIA-operated aircraft possibly including those used in rendition flights have repeatedly used [MISC Danish  ] territory and airspace ( ref A ) . 
The program alleged that several flights had also stopped off in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Opposition leader and [ORG Left-Green Party Chair  ] [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] referred to the [ORG RUV  ] broadcast in an [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) question time session on February 28 , asking Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] whether the documentary didn't demonstrate both the need and the viability of an independent investigation of whether similar flights had used [MISC Icelandic  ] territory for the purposes of rendition. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Gisladottir  ] flatly refused the [ORG Left-Green  ] call for an investigation , noting the work of a Ministry for Foreign Affairs ( [ORG MFA  ] ) review and pointing to the [ORG MFA  ] 's conclusion that it would be unproductive to attempt to determine whether suspected terrorists had actually been transported through [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Should some further evidence pointing to renditions come to light , the [ORG MFA  ] would review its stance , the [ORG FM  ] noted , but as the matter currently stands the government has focused on ensuring that such activities do not take place in the future . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] added that DR1-TV lauded the [MISC Icelandic  ] government 's policy of searching all suspected rendition flights ( ref B ) in a subsequent program , which she hopes [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG RUV  ] will see fit to broadcast. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Pressed further by [PER Sigfusson  ] , [ORG FM  ] [PER Gisladottir  ] added the caution that aircraft with tail numbers allegedly linked to the [ORG CIA  ] can not definitively be pronounced rendition flights: " I say possible [ rendition flights ] because the aircraft numbers under discussion could obviously be [ in [LOC Iceland  ] ] in connection with other parties or for other purposes than these . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Gisladottir  ] 's response is her strongest move to date to knock down the proposal of a further inquiry into the renditions issue . 
The [ORG FM  ] may feel her earlier moves on the issue ( refs B and C ) have given her breathing room to withstand opposition calls for further action regarding events previous to her tenure at the [ORG MFA  ] .
