( C ) Summary . 
President [PER Felipe Calderon  ] has attempted since taking office to repair ties with [LOC Venezuela  ] , and the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] has said that [LOC Mexico  ] is slowly making improvements . 
Nevertheless , several points of friction , such as the lack of a [MISC Venezuelan  ] ambassador in [LOC Mexico City  ] , suspicions about [MISC Venezuelan  ] outreach activities in [LOC Mexico  ] , and the expropriation by [LOC Venezuela  ] of [MISC Mexican  ] assets have prevented and probably will continue to prevent the relationship from becoming truly warm . 
On the [MISC Bolivarian  ] promotion front , [LOC Venezuela  ] is clearly conducting outreach activities in [LOC Mexico  ] , but to what appears to be little avail . 
[LOC Mexico  ] does not offer the kind of fertile ground for [MISC Bolivarian  ] activism as do some other countries in the hemisphere . 
A mistrust of foreign interventionism and lessons learned from the 2006 presidential election probably will prevent the [MISC Bolivarian  ] movement from impacting significantly the [MISC Mexican  ] political or social scene . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Mexico Working  ] to [LOC Strengthen Ties  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Calderon  ] since taking office in 2006 has sought to repair [LOC Mexico  ] 's tattered relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] as part of his efforts to position [LOC Mexico  ] to take a stronger leadership role in [LOC Latin America  ] and conduct " respectful relations " with all nations ( ref a ) . 
Despite [PER Chavez  ] 's initial refusal to recognize the legitimacy of [PER Calderon  ] 's victory in the contested 2006 presidential election , the two countries reinstated full bilateral ties--the Fox administration had revoked the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Ambassador 's credentials and recalled its own ambassador in [LOC Caracas--and Mexico  ] has sought to maintain a cordial tone in the conduct of its affairs with its southern neighbor . 
The [PER Calderon  ] government responded relatively quietly even to [PER Chavez  ] 's contentious decision to nationalize [MISC Mexican  ] cement giant [ORG Cemex  ] 's [MISC Venezuela-based  ] assets , expressing concern and promising to protect [MISC Mexican  ] interests abroad , but without taking any retaliatory measures . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's ( [ORG SRE  ] ) Director for [LOC South America  ] , [PER Rafael Bernal Cuevas  ] , told [PER Poloff  ] on October 23 that [LOC Mexico  ] 's relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] have not recovered their pre-Chavez cordiality , but that they are slowly moving in that direction . 
In her September testimony before congress , Foreign Minister [PER Patricia Espinosa  ] also outlined steps [LOC Mexico  ] had taken and continues to take to improve relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
A Few Bumps in the [LOC Road  ] ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite the improvement in bilateral relations since the Fox administration , [PER Bernal  ] outlined several points of friction . 
He noted that [LOC Venezuela  ] still had yet to replace former [MISC Venezuelan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Mexico  ] [PER Roy Chaderton  ] after he was named [LOC Venezuela  ] 's Permanent Representative to the [ORG Organization of American States  ] in April . 
[PER Bernal  ] said the extended absence of an ambassador made the conduct of bilateral relations in [LOC Mexico City  ] " uncomfortable . 
" He also said that [LOC Mexico  ] is not heavily involved in the [ORG Cemex  ] negotiations at [ORG Cemex  ] 's request , but is carefully monitoring the progress of the talks. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Like [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] is also looking to assert its leadership in the region , particularly in [LOC Central America  ] . 
[PER Bosco Marti  ] , the Director of [ORG SRE  ] 's [ORG Plan Puebla Panama Office  ] , complained to [PER Poloff  ] that [LOC Mexico  ] could not compete with [LOC Venezuela  ] when it came to the kind of money it was tossing at member countries through its [ORG ALBA  ] ( [ORG Bolivarian Alternative  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ) initiative. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In response to [PER Poloff  ] 's question about press reports that [LOC Mexico  ] would look to put an end to [ORG Miracle Mission  ] flights into the country , [PER Bernal  ] said that [LOC Mexico  ] was trying to regulate the program and codify it in official bilateral channels , rather than allowing it to be negotiated [LOC MEXICO  ] 00003178 002 OF 004 and executed at the local level . 
One article had reported that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] wanted flights to be registered as commercial airline and pass through appropriate security measures upon landing in [LOC Mexico  ] rather than entering with " extraordinary permits , " as had been occurring . 
[PER Bernal  ] made discreet reference to [MISC Mexican  ] concern about the ideological component to the program , and said that at the very least , [MISC Mexican  ] patients were returning to [LOC Mexico  ] with the message that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government provided a service to them their own government could or would not . 
Sensitive collateral reporting suggests that the [ORG GOM  ] as of September was concerned that [ORG Miracle Mission  ] patients received pro-Venezuelan and anti-US briefings as part of their stay in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The [ORG GOM  ] was reportedly worried that such patients returned to [LOC Mexico  ] more sympathetic to pro-Chavez themes and were more likely to participate in associated marches or rallies . 
[PER Bernal  ] mentioned the presence of [MISC Bolivarian  ] groups in [LOC Mexico  ] , but noted that such groups exist throughout the world and that , as a democracy , [LOC Mexico  ] had to offer them freedom of expression . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] Looking to Spread the Revolution ------------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Mexico City  ] daily [ORG El Universal  ] reported in October 2007 on a purported [MISC Venezuelan  ] government document laying out a 2007-2013 political and economic development plan which included points on strengthening alternative movements in [LOC Mexico  ] to " break away from imperial domination " with the larger goal of rallying " the masses " worldwide in " support of the revolutionary process . 
" In line with this strategic objective , [LOC Venezuela  ] is seeking to cultivate support at the grassroots level in [LOC Mexico  ] , primarily through social programs and low levels of financial and logistical support . 
Who Is Involved ? ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Analysts from the [ORG Mexican National Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG CISEN  ] ) told Poloffs on October 2 that they have identified some 500 serious [MISC Bolivarian  ] activists--all [MISC Mexican  ] citizens--across the country , which are often in contact with each other and tend to be linked to larger social movements . 
[ORG CISEN  ] noted that many [MISC Bolivarian  ] sympathizers are tied back to the [ORG Red de Solidaridad  ] con [LOC Cuba  ] , which has been active for decades but which has appropriated [PER Chavez  ] 's rhetoric in order to freshen its own discourse . 
In addition to the [MISC Cuban  ] support networks , a chapter of the region-wide [ORG Bolivarian Continental Coordinator  ] operates in [LOC Mexico  ] , and other pro-Venezuela activists are linked to the Worker 's [ORG Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) and different student groups operating out of the [ORG National Autonomous University of Mexico  ] ( [ORG UNAM  ] ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a recent [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed to [PER Poloff  ] that most pro-Venezuelan student groups are run from the political science and philosophy departments , from which hailed [PER Lucia Morett  ] , the [MISC Mexican  ] student who survived the bombing of [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) leader [PER Raul Reyes'  ] [MISC Ecuadorian  ] camp in March . 
He also noted that in a school with a population over 300,000 , political ideologies of every persuasion are bound to be represented. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Minister Counselor [PER Jaime Acosta  ] and Political Officer [PER Paola Holguin  ] from the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Mexico City  ] told [PER Poloff  ] that [LOC Venezuela  ] has a considerable presence in [LOC Mexico  ] , noting that a number of legislators ( who they did not name ) openly support [PER Chavez  ] . 
Sensitive collateral reporting indicates that [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials also have regular contact with members of the [ORG Democratic Revolutionary Party  ] ( [ORG PRD  ] ) , specifically [PER Ruth Zavaleta  ] and members of the [ORG New Left Faction  ] , the [ORG New Alliance Party  ] ( [ORG PANAL  ] ) and the [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) . 
Who Is ( Maybe ) Not ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) After [PER Chavez  ] 's public endorsement of 2006 presidential candidate [PER Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  ] did nothing but tarnish the [ORG PRD  ] leader 's campaign , many [MISC Mexican  ] politicians are wary of cozying too much up to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] president . 
[ORG CISEN  ] told [PER Poloff  ] that it has no evidence , for [LOC MEXICO  ] 00003178 003 OF 004 example , that [LOC Venezuela  ] currently is providing direct funding to [MISC Mexican  ] political candidates , nor to they think it is likely in the runup to the 2009 legislative and gubernatorial elections . 
The analysts believe that most political leaders have learned from 2006 not to risk their candidacy by accepting [PER Chavez  ] 's support , either overtly or covertly . 
Sensitive collateral reporting also indicates that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has been unsuccessful in building rapport with [PER Lopez Obrador  ] , who has reportedly decided not to establish a relationship with the [ORG GOV  ] so as not to risk his reputation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG CISEN  ] is looking for close links between [LOC Venezuela  ] and the more radical , violent groups in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[ORG CISEN  ] has yet to uncover concrete links between the [ORG Popular Revolutionary Party  ] ( [ORG EPR  ] ) and [LOC Venezuela  ] , but continues to investigate given the ideological affinity between them . 
What Is Offered --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) As it has throughout the hemisphere , [LOC Venezuela  ] seeks to woo [MISC Mexicans  ] via social handouts to impoverished groups and modest financial support to its like-minded [MISC Mexican  ] cohorts . 
[ORG CISEN  ] reported that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] is providing small donations to pro-Bolivarian organizations , mostly for operating expenses such as vehicles and propaganda . 
[ORG CISEN  ] suspects , however , that the [ORG Embassy  ] also provides funding for members of these organizations to travel to [MISC Bolivarian  ] Congresses of [MISC Latin American  ] leftist groups , such as the event [PER Morett  ] attended in [LOC Quito  ] prior to leaving for [PER Reyes'  ] camp ( ref b ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC Venezuela  ] 's ability to implement large-scale or effective social programs in [LOC Mexico  ] seems limited , at best . 
[ORG CISEN  ] said that [LOC Venezuela  ] has established two medical clinics in northern [LOC Mexico  ] , including in [LOC Nuevo  ] [PER Leon State  ] , but they have yet to open for business . 
Moreover , [ORG CISEN  ] reported that only a handful of [MISC Mexicans  ] have participated in [LOC Venezuela  ] 's " [ORG Miracle Mission  ] , " which offers low-cost eye surgery to [MISC Mexicans  ] in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[ORG El Universal  ] reported on October 20 that some 509 [MISC Mexicans  ] have received treatment , which is in sharp contrast , for example , to the tens of thousands of [MISC Peruvians  ] who have partaken ( ref c ) in the program . 
[ORG CISEN  ] opined that , unlike some of their poorer and smaller [MISC Latin American  ] neighbors , [LOC Mexico  ] offers significantly more social support . 
The Health Secretary , for example , published figures indicating that between January and July 2008 , over 26,000 [MISC Mexicans  ] have received eye surgeries through [LOC Mexico  ] 's own programs . 
[ORG CISEN  ] noted that [LOC Cuba  ] also provides a literacy teacher training program in [LOC Michoacan  ] , [LOC Guerrero  ] , [LOC Oaxaca  ] , and [ORG Tabasco  ] and scholarships for [MISC Mexican  ] students to study in [LOC Cuba  ] , but that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] Embassies seem to operate quite independently on most matters in [LOC Mexico.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC Venezuela  ] 's efforts are being further circumscribed by resource limitations and GOM trepidation . 
Sensitive collateral reporting indicates that as of early October , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] was finding it virtually impossible to undertake pro-Bolivarian activities in Mexico--such as holding events or hosting delegations--because of lack of funding from the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government . 
The [MISC Mexican  ] government is also less than receptive to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's outreach efforts . 
The attempt to more strictly regulate the [ORG Miracle Mission  ] program in [LOC Mexico  ] , for example , probably reflects GOM suspicion as the [LOC Venezuela  ] 's goals for and conduct of the program . 
Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG Calderon  ] and the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] still appear committed to strengthening [LOC Mexico  ] 's ties with [LOC Venezuela  ] as part of a strategy to position [LOC Mexico  ] in a leadership role in the region and maintain friendly relationships with all its neighbors . 
Nevertheless , due to the ideological gap between [ORG Calderon  ] and [PER Chavez  ] and several points of minor--but still significant--irritation , relations will probably continue to be less than warm . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's tardiness in appointing a new ambassador to [LOC Mexico  ] , for example , certainly has rankled the protocol-obsessed [ORG SRE  ] , and has hampered progress on bilateral [LOC MEXICO  ] 00003178 004 OF 004 issues in [LOC Mexico  ] City. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Venezuela  ] is conducting outreach activities in [LOC Mexico  ] , but to what seems to be little effect . 
[LOC Mexico  ] does not offer the kind of fertile ground to [MISC Bolivarian  ] activism as compared with some other countries in the hemisphere . 
A mistrust of foreign interventionism and lessons learned from the 2006 presidential election probably will prevent the [MISC Bolivarian  ] movement from having much influence in the [MISC Mexican  ] political or social scene . 
Post will continue to watch for signs that [LOC Venezuela  ] is increasing ties to some of [LOC Mexico  ] 's more dangerous radical groups , in particular the [ORG EPR  ] .
