Murphy  ] for reasons 1.4 b/d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] set the [MISC German  ] agenda on [LOC Iran  ] with her early November statement before the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] on " zero tolerance " for a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] and the need for tougher sanctions should engagement not work . 
During a private roundtable hosted by Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] , however , members of [LOC Germany  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] " brain-trust " from the [MISC German  ] Parliament , [ORG MFA  ] , [ORG Ministry of Economics  ] and top government funded think tank welcomed the President 's engagement policy , recommended broadening the dialogue to areas of cooperation ( drugs , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , diplomatic relations ) , betrayed little beyond a superficial knowledge of the nuclear program , argued that [LOC Germany  ] took the largest economic hit from recent sanctions , and expressed doubts as to the efficacy of sanctions , giving us a window into the difficult task Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] will have in keeping her government on her page . 
In the end , we assess that [PER Merkel  ] will have her way . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The November 24 event at the Embassy included members of Parliament from the four main [MISC German  ] political parties: [ORG FDP Elke Hoff  ] , [ORG CDU Andreas Schockenhoff  ] , [PER Greens Kerstin Mueller  ] , and [ORG SPD Rolf Muetzenich  ] . 
From the [ORG MFA  ] , Policy Planner [PER Markus Ederer  ] , [ORG DG for Economics Ruediger  ] von [PER Fritsch  ] , [ORG DG for Disarmament and Nonproliferation Amb  ] . 
[PER Peter Gottwald  ] , and [ORG Iran Task Force  ] Director [PER Andreas Krueger  ] attended . 
[ORG Ministry of Economics DG for External Economic Policy Karl-Ernst Brauner  ] and the Director of the [MISC German  ] government funded research institute [ORG Stiftung fuer Wissenschaft und Politik  ] ( [ORG SWP  ] , or [ORG Institute for Science and Politics  ] ) [PER Volker Perthes  ] also attended. ----------------------------------------- MFA: TRR Not Dead Yet ; But Not [MISC Well Either  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador opened the discussion by thanking the [MISC German  ] government for its excellent cooperation on [LOC Iran  ] and asked his guests to share their thoughts on the [MISC Iranian  ] internal situation , especially given recent reports of the expanded role of the [ORG IRGC  ] in the cultural/educational spheres of life , and how that might affect [LOC Iran  ] 's external policy . 
[ORG MFA DG for Disarmament Gottwald  ] stated that if we were correct in assessing the [MISC Iranian  ] regime 's primary goal to be survival , then we still had a chance with a negotiated solution . 
He said that while the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( TRR ) deal was not " well , " [LOC Germany  ] wasn't ready to pronounce it " dead " quite yet . 
He concluded with a strong statement saying that a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] would be a nightmare in and of itself and a disastrous blow to the NPT regime which was why [LOC Germany  ] would be a strong partner in support of further sanctions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Policy Planer Ederer  ] said he thought [LOC Iran  ] was confused about what it wants and that the West might be even more confused about how to get what we want . 
He said we want [MISC Iranian  ] behavior change , but we don't agree yet what will get us there . 
He said [ORG UN  ] sponsored sanctions would isolate [LOC Iran  ] and limit its capacity , but questioned whether they would change [LOC Tehran  ] 's behavior . 
He said he realized sanctions remained a good alternative to military action , but questioned whether they were really capable of anything other than just buying time. ------------------------------------------ More Carrots before we Reach for the Sticks ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG SWP  ] 's [PER Perthes  ] argued [MISC Iranian  ] Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] 's primary interest was to maintain the security of the system and prevent regime change . 
[PER Perthes  ] said [PER Khamenei  ] feared a velvet revolution over all else , though regional instability was a close second . 
He noted [LOC Iran  ] remained besieged by problems of drug smuggling , piracy , and instability in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He recommended more emphasis be placed on trying to find an incentive for the regime to cooperate on the regional track , which had already shown some progress . 
He said the April 2009 , 300 million dollar [MISC Iranian  ] pledge at the [LOC Pakistan  ] donor 's conference was an important symbol of the value the regime placed on regional security . 
He suggested the West " broaden " relations with [LOC Iran  ] to areas where cooperation could be had: drugs , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and diplomatic ( especially Consular ) ties . 
POL [ORG M/C  ] noted this was fine , but ignored the fact that time was not on our side . 
Rather , [LOC Iran  ] was installing new centrifuges each week . 
If [LOC Iran  ] wanted to build confidence or " broaden " relations , it could modulate that pace , but time was not a luxury we had . 
[PER Gottwald  ] agreed emphatically . 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 00001577 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Changing course , [PER Perthes  ] said that if " sticks " had to be used , he suggested more focus on " export-control " and less on sanctions . 
He noted evidence suggested export control regimes had already worked in slowing down centrifuge progress . 
He concluded by saying that if sanctions must be used , we should avoid all use of the word " crippling " and instead focus on " targeted " sanctions in order not to turn the [MISC Iranian  ] masses against us and right back into [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's hands . 
He also suggested that " unofficial " sanctions such as [LOC Russia  ] 's decision not to sell the [MISC S300s  ] were more effective than most formal sanctions . 
If formal sanctions had to be pursued he said only global sanctions would be effective , and therefore advocated UNSC action . 
[PER Perthes  ] said he saw readiness in the [MISC German  ] business community to accept financial loss if sanctions were truly global , but they don't want to see business opportunities being lost to [LOC China  ] or [LOC India.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- [ORG Green Party  ] : Too Late to Prevent , Need To Contain --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) From the opposition , [ORG Green Party Foreign Policy  ] Spokesperson [PER Kerstin Mueller  ] said she was glad that the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration no longer talked about a threat of a military option . 
But she also said she was skeptical that [LOC Iran  ] can be prevented from obtaining a nuclear capability without a military option , and that it might even be too late for a military option to be effective . 
She said she didn't see compromise within the interests of the regime and thought the West should focus more attention on how to " control " a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran.  ] ------------------------------------------- [PER FDP: Rank  ] and [ORG File Grudging Partner on Iran  ] ? -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG FDP  ] Spokeswoman on [ORG Defense Policy  ] , [PER Elke Hoff  ] opened her remarks with a grudging acknowledgment of the coalition agreement in which her party agreed that if engagement with [LOC Iran  ] on the nuclear dossier failed , sanctions would be implemented . 
She added that she remained personally skeptical as to their efficacy . 
She said additional sanctions would serve the unintended consequence of rallying the masses around [LOC Ahmadinejad.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Hoff  ] said she often hears from constituents in the business community that [MISC German  ] companies are getting pressured from their [MISC American  ] counterparts not to do business in [LOC Iran  ] , and yet they see plenty of [LOC U.S.  ] products for sale in [LOC Iran  ] . 
Econ [ORG M/C  ] intervened and stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] was ready to prosecute any [LOC U.S.  ] businesses in violation of [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions and had already done so . 
[PER Hoff  ] also suggested offering [MISC German  ] businesses financial compensation should new sanctions come into play . 
In response to a criticism from [PER Hoff  ] on whether the [LOC U.S.  ] deadline created for engagement on [LOC Iran  ] reflected [PER Obama  ] 's domestic political agenda , the Ambassador emphasized the deep commitment of the administration to engagement. ---------------------------- [LOC Germany  ] is the [ORG Largest Loser  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) MFA DG for Economics [PER Von Fritsch  ] agreed with [MISC Perthes'  ] suggestion to focus more on the carrots and not the sticks . 
He noted that no single country has ( recently ) sacrificed as much financially as [LOC Germany  ] has , not just in existing trade , but also in long term future contracts . 
Econ [ORG M/C  ] noted that [LOC U.S.  ] business had also suffered enormous trade and investment losses after 1979 . 
[PER Von Fritsch  ] said if sanctions were inevitable , [MISC German  ] business preferred global and clear sanctions as opposed to vague wording that can be left open to differing interpretations . 
On correspondent banking relations , [PER Von Fritsch  ] said the [MISC German  ] government was still examining the issue but that a complete severance of correspondent banking relations including with [LOC Iran  ] 's central bank would not be possible since it would amount to a total trade embargo. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG Ministry of Economics DG for External Policy Brauner  ] referenced the inclusion in [MISC German  ] law of the presumptive right to trade , and said that he was concerned that what the [MISC German  ] Customs and [ORG BAFA  ] ( export control agency under the [ORG Ministry of Economics  ] ) were doing to encourage " [MISC Nullbescheid  ] " ( pre-certification that specific trade with [LOC Iran  ] is not illicit ) might actually be illegal , as [MISC German  ] business had complained . 
He said one important consideration for [LOC Germany  ] [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001577 003 OF 003 was that a further crackdown on trade with [LOC Iran  ] could endanger repayment of the 4.5 billion Euros in outstanding credits that [LOC Iran  ] owed [LOC Germany  ] . 
[LOC Germany  ] had agreed not to issue any new credit under its [ORG Hermes  ] ( [ORG OPIC-like  ] ) program , but expected to be able to collect on outstanding credits . 
Nonetheless , both [PER Brauner  ] and [PER Von Fritsch  ] emphasized that in the event of no progress in negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Germany  ] was ready to enter a new round of stronger sanctions , and that we should look to Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's statements in the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] and [PER FM Westerwelle  ] 's reiterations of her strong policy as the final say on which direction [LOC Germany  ] would go on [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) CONCLUSION . 
The majority of the guests at the table distinctly deferred to [PER Perthes  ] for guidance on where the [LOC Iran  ] issue might be headed or should be headed . 
This was striking amongst such a high ranking group of people operationally involved with the [LOC Iran  ] issue . 
Also illuminating was the variety of talking points employed by the participants to define hurdles for sanction until debunked one at a time by Embassy officers . 
The candor with which even some MFA and [ORG Ministry of Economics  ] officials expressed their skepticism on the efficacy of pursuing tougher sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] may mean that [PER Merkel  ] will have to press hard within her own government to deliver on her promise of implementing tougher sanctions should engagement with [LOC Iran  ] fail . 
None of our interlocutors , however , questioned whether [PER Merkel  ] would , at the end of the day , be able to " deliver " on her promises . 
If and when we decide to go forward on the pressure track on [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG USG  ] may wish to reinforce [PER Merkel  ] 's position by showing appreciation for [LOC Germany  ] 's strong continuing support . 
END CONCLUSION .
