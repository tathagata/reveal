( U ) [MISC Summary: A  ] month before Icelanders head to the polls for the May 12 parliamentary elections , the Left [MISC Greens  ] are riding a wave of interest in environmental concerns . 
However , the emergence of a new green party could splinter the environmentalist bloc and ensure the current center-right coalition 's survival . 
Apart from rhetoric about retroactively withdrawing [LOC Iceland  ] 's support for the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 ( but no other changes to [LOC Iceland  ] 's [LOC Middle East  ] policy ) , foreign policy has not been a campaign issue . 
Environmentalist issues and energy-intensive industrial construction feature prominently in all parties' campaigns , but many here are comfortable with their quality of life and credit the [MISC Independence Party-led  ] government . 
In the end it might all come down to [PER Carville  ] 's phrase: " It 's the economy , stupid . 
" End Summary . 
Election Procedures ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Election procedures in [LOC Iceland  ] are similar to those in most [MISC Western European  ] countries . 
The [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) has a total of 63 seats which are allocated proportionally across six voting districts . 
Voters cast their ballots for parties , not for individual candidates , though the parties publish their candidate lists in rank order ahead of the election . 
To receive an [ORG Althingi  ] seat , a party needs to receive at least five percent of the vote nationwide , in addition to competing successfully within a given district . 
The traditionally apolitical president , who is elected separately in national elections in the year following [ORG Althingi  ] elections , is empowered to formally appoint the cabinet . 
In practice , the leaders of the political parties forming the successful coalition decide the makeup and allocation of cabinet seats among themselves . 
Minority governments are not constitutionally permitted . 
Traditionally , only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves in reasonable time does the president exercise his power to appoint the cabinet himself . 
Rumors continue to circulate , however , that the current president will break with tradition to the benefit of his political friends on the left ( see below ) . 
Since 1991 , two-party coalitions have held power with the [ORG Independence Party  ] as the senior partner , but three-party coalitions were not uncommon in the past . 
Of the seven parties running , we expect five or six will be represented in the next parliament . 
The [MISC Parties: Independence Leads  ] The Way --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) , the senior party in the current majority coalition , is a center-right party led by Prime Minister [PER Geir H. Haarde  ] . 
In the past year party support has been measuring at 36 to 43 percent in [MISC Gallup  ] polls , a slight rise over the 33.7 percent ( 22 seats ) they received in the 2003 [ORG Althingi  ] elections . 
The [ORG IP  ] has a tendency to measure higher in polls than in elections , but it can still safely expect to get between 30 and 40 percent of the vote . 
The [ORG IP  ] 's campaign touts the government 's economic record , low unemployment , tax reductions , and diminishing government debt . 
At the same time , the [ORG IP  ] has responded to the local environmental debate ( Ref A ) -- and some argue , stolen a plank from their primary opposition , the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] -- by announcing plans to slow down the build-up of heavy industry in [LOC Iceland  ] , such as aluminum smelters , and establish a framework plan for possible future projects involving heavy industry. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) On foreign policy , the [ORG IP  ] is a staunch supporter of the bilateral defense relationship with the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
Although [ORG IP  ] stalwarts were frustrated with the manner in which the [ORG USG  ] announced the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces from [LOC Iceland  ] in March 2006 , PM [PER Haarde  ] 's pragmatism and trustworthiness has made him the frontrunner in forging a new bilateral defense relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
In addition , the [ORG IP  ] has emphasized the need for [LOC Iceland  ] to take on more responsibilities in security and defense affairs , fully realizing the need to fill the void left by the departure of [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
The party 's success in this regard can be seen in the corresponding failure of opposition challengers to put foreign policy on the campaign agenda this spring . 
[ORG Progressives: Running  ] On Their Record ( Sort Of ) --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The junior member in the coalition , the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , is a traditionally agrarian and centrist party led by Minister of Industry and [ORG Commerce  ] [PER Jon Sigurdsson  ] . 
Despite getting 17.7 percent ( 12 seats ) in the last election , polls show the party with only eight to 10 percent support during the past year ( which would translate into a drop to five [ORG Althingi  ] seats ) . 
The party has in recent years attempted to extend its political base to urban areas , with unsatisfactory results -- [LOC Iceland  ] 's new urbanites have instead blamed the [ORG PP  ] for industrializing [LOC Iceland  ] 's previously unspoiled highlands , while their coalition partners the [ORG IP  ] get all the credit for recent economic growth . 
The [MISC Progressives'  ] political base [MISC REYKJAVIK  ] 00000114 002 OF 004 remains in rural [LOC Iceland  ] , mainly farming areas such as Southern and [ORG Northeastern Iceland  ] . 
The party supports continuing economic growth through further build-up of heavy industry and is opposed to the other parties' policies of putting a halt to or pausing further development . 
Their slogan , " Continued Results -- [ORG Don't Stop  ] ! 
" reflects the party 's attempt to gain credit for [MISC Icelanders'  ] comfortable lifestyle and support for further industrial investment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On international affairs , the [ORG PP  ] was more cautious in its reactions to the closure of [ORG NASKEF  ] and , apart from then-PM [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] 's initial fit of pique , stayed largely aloof from the bilateral negotiations on the future arrangement of the bilateral defense relationship . 
Foreign Minister [PER Sverrisdottir  ] of the [MISC Progressives  ] has , however , let slip a few public comments of frustration regarding the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
The [ORG PP  ] has flirted with the idea of looking to [LOC Europe  ] and not just the [LOC U.S.  ] , with the FM making several comments over the past year about the " inevitability " of studying questions related to [ORG EU  ] membership . 
The party is generally pro-American and pro-NATO , however , and has welcomed energy-intensive industrial investment by large [MISC American  ] corporations , such as [ORG Alcoa  ] , in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [MISC Alliance: Still  ] Trying To Find Its Way ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) , a center-left party , was officially established in 2000 from the merger of four leftist and center-left parties . 
After a good showing in the 2003 elections ( 20 seats ) followed by a change of party leadership in 2005 ( current leader [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] is [LOC Iceland  ] 's only female party chair ) , the [ORG SDA  ] has been losing momentum and its support has dropped steadily -- polls in March put the [ORG SDA  ] at around 20 percent , behind the [MISC Left-Greens  ] ( see below ) for the first time in its history . 
The [ORG SDA  ] has touted the need to renovate the [MISC Icelandic  ] welfare system along the lines of the [MISC Nordic  ] social democratic welfare model in order to counter growing income disparity over the last decade . 
The [ORG SDA  ] maintains that the current government has mismanaged the economy , to the detriment of the the elderly and the disabled in particular . 
On " green " matters , the party has often wobbled in its attitudes towards further buildup of heavy industry . 
The [ORG SDA  ] 's present campaign platform , however , calls for an interim freeze on all plans for further industrial buildup , pending drafting of a framework to exclude certain locations from industrial development . 
When it comes to foreign relations , the [ORG SDA  ] has pronounced itself " skeptical " of the value of current defense ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] and alleges that the GOI could have achieved more in negotiations in 2006 had it been better prepared for the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] forces ( Ref B ) . 
The [ORG SDA  ] is the only party to openly call for [ORG E.U.  ] membership for [LOC Iceland  ] and has similarly said that [LOC Iceland  ] should look to [LOC Europe  ] more on security matters . 
Party chair [PER Gisladottir  ] has also pledged that the first act of any [MISC SDA-led  ] government will be to retroactively remove [LOC Iceland  ] from the list of countries that supported the 2003 invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] , though without stating any alternative policy goals regarding the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
The [MISC Left-Greens: Flavor  ] Of The Month ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) is composed of the leftists who did not want to join the [ORG SDA  ] when it formed , due to concerns over both ideology and leadership . 
The party did not do well in the 2003 elections with only 8.8 percent of the vote ( five seats ) , but since then has capitalized on the environmental issues wave that has swept [LOC Iceland  ] in the last couple of years . 
In the past year the [ORG LG  ] has been polling around 20 percent , with support surging as high as 27 percent in the past few months . 
The [ORG LG  ] is no longer a fringe party and will likely be a major player in the post-election coalition negotiations , though party leaders privately voice concern that the new " [ORG Iceland Movement  ] " ( see below ) will draw from the same pool of disaffected voters . 
The [ORG Left Greens  ] have been commended for having a clear position on issues , and have thus pulled left-leaning voters from the comparatively wishy-washy [ORG SDA  ] . 
Despite an avowedly socialist view on economic and fiscal policy , the [ORG LG  ] claims it will not raise taxes , but will instead redistribute the tax burden in order to decrease income disparity . 
On its pet issue , the environment , the [ORG LG  ] wants all plans for further buildup of heavy industry to be halted in favor of the creation of diverse sources of employment in rural areas . 
From its founding , the [ORG LG  ] platform has called for [LOC Iceland  ] 's withdrawal from [ORG NATO  ] and the development of a pacifist , cooperation-oriented foreign policy . 
That said , the [ORG LG Chair  ] admitted to the Ambassador that he sees the need for the party to be " realistic " and that withdrawal from [ORG NATO  ] will not be in the cards any time soon . 
There is no question , however , that if in government the [ORG Greens  ] will demand that [LOC Iceland  ] 's name be immediately removed from the [ORG Coalition of the Willing  ] regarding [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[ORG Liberals: Xenophobia Isn't Selling  ] , Yet --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG LP  ] ) was originally a one-issue party fighting the current quota system of fisheries management in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The party drew 7.4 percent ( four seats ) in the last elections , but its support had dropped to about three to four [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000114 003.5 OF 004 percent by last November . 
At that point , the [ORG LP  ] caught the public 's attention when it raised the issue of the growing numbers of immigrant workers coming to [LOC Iceland  ] after labor movement within the [ORG European Economic Area  ] was fully liberalized in May 2006 . 
The party warned of possible consequences for the [MISC Icelandic  ] wage market , the future of the welfare system , and [MISC Icelandic  ] society as a whole if foreigners did not properly " adjust " to their new home . 
After an initial spike in [ORG LP  ] following in the polls , the public at large and other political parties have since lambasted the [ORG LP  ] for being xenophobic and even racist in its attitudes towards foreigners . 
( Comment: Likely due to the fact that unemployment is so low -- around two percent -- that the arrival of immigrants is helping , rather than burdening , the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy . 
End comment . 
) They deny these allegations but their campaign advertisements suggest that there may be some truth to these accusations . 
While the party still emphasizes fisheries management , the immigrant issue appears to be taking over as issue number one . 
The [ORG LP  ] is fairly pro-American and supports [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] membership and maintaining the bilateral defense relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG Iceland Movement: Splitting  ] the [ORG Green Vote  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The newest political party on the scene , The [ORG Iceland Movement - Living Land  ] ( [ORG IM  ] ) , fashions itself as a " right-green " party headed by a well-known television personality , who is the party 's interim chairman . 
The first polls since the party 's formation in February , 2007 indicate that the party would get approximately five percent in the elections . 
Like the [ORG Left Greens  ] , the [ORG IM  ] wants to stop further buildup of energy-intensive industries that would affect unspoiled natural areas . 
Observers point out that this candidacy will divide environmentalist voters instead of uniting them , and thus likely benefit the current coalition partners . 
A [ORG Progressive Party  ] stalwart gleefully told the Ambassador that he welcomes The [ORG Iceland Movement  ] 's candidacy for exactly this reason , and joked that maybe a few more environmental groups ought to run for parliament . 
So far the [ORG IM  ] 's position towards the [LOC U.S.  ] -- and virtually every other issue -- is a tabula rasa . 
[ORG Coalition Options  ] ----------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Until very recently , the predominant assumption among both political pundits and the general public was that the current coalition government would be history after May 12 ( owing largely to the [MISC Progressives'  ] collapse in 2006 -- Ref C ) . 
A mid-March [MISC Gallup  ] poll showed that 28 percent of voters wanted a center-left coalition ( [ORG SDA  ] and [ORG LG  ] ) , while 24 percent wanted to see the current coalition live on . 
One coalition option that has often come up is a marriage of the extremes on right and left ( the [MISC IP  ] and the [ORG LG  ] ) , which polled at 22 percent in March . 
Two options that are commonly believed to be off the table are a right and center-left ( [MISC IP  ] and [ORG SDA  ] ) mix , and a coalition of all three current opposition parties in parliament -- both of these choices are polling at less than 10 percent . 
However , the emergence of The [ORG Iceland Movement  ] has thrown previous forecasts into disarray , and [MISC Gallup  ] poll data released on April 16 have the current [MISC IP-PP  ] coalition defying earlier odds at 36 percent support , the most popular option . 
An old saw of [MISC Icelandic  ] politics is that the [MISC Progressives  ] always do better than the pre-election polls indicate . 
In this case , thanks to the [ORG IM  ] , the [MISC Progressives  ] may do better than even the election results themselves indicate , as the " right-greens " may do just well enough to sink the left 's chances without getting any [ORG Althingi  ] seats themselves . 
In this scenario , the [MISC IP  ] and [ORG PP  ] would get a higher number of [ORG Althingi  ] seats than their raw share of votes cast. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One final wild card , however , is the possible role of President [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] . 
[PER Grimsson  ] , a former [ORG MP  ] and minister for one of the [ORG SDA  ] 's predecessor parties , has had a number of public spats with the current government during his tenure , most notably surrounding his unprecedented use of presidential veto power against a media ownership bill in 2004 ( Ref D ) . 
Advisors in the current government have passed to the Ambassador rumblings that [PER Grimsson  ] , convinced that the [MISC IP-PP  ] government is doing irreparable damage to the country , may take another unprecedented step in May and give the mandate to form a government to one of the parties on the left . 
Though constitutionally allowed , such a move might seem to many as a gross overstepping of the bounds of the President 's generally ceremonial role . 
It is not clear how the potential constitutional crisis in this case might be resolved. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: As the issues have been framed so far , in a month 's time [LOC Iceland  ] 's voters will face a referendum on whether heavy industrial investment is the price to be paid for [LOC Iceland  ] 's high standard of living or if some of the economy 's vibrancy should be traded for preserving untouched areas of the country . 
Absent any involvement by President [PER Grimsson  ] , PM [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] will likely be the driving force when coalition negotiations begin after the elections . 
Unless The [ORG Iceland Movement  ] splinters the enviro-vote enough to let the current coalition continue , the next [ORG GOI  ] will need to take account of environmental concerns and may be forced to slow down the pace of investment in aluminum and other [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000114 004.3 OF 004 heavy industries -- a move that would likely have a direct impact on the two [LOC U.S.  ] aluminum firms active here . 
On other issues of importance to the [LOC USG  ] , however , any [MISC IP-led  ] government can be expected to continue most current [ORG GOI  ] policies .
