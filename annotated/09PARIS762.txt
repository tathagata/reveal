End summary . 
Participants ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] was accompanied by [PER Damien Loras  ] , [MISC French  ] Presidency Adviser for the [ORG Americas  ] . 
[ORG EUR A/S Gordon  ] was accompanied by [PER CDA Pekala  ] and [PER Poloff  ] ( notetaker ) . 
[MISC POTUS-Sarkozy  ] Bilat ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Levitte  ] began by explaining the [MISC French  ] decision not to invite the [MISC Germans  ] to the June 6 D-Day commemoration. “It’s my fault , ” said [PER Levitte  ] , who said that President [PER Sarkozy  ] had initially been keen to invite [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] to participate. “I pointed out to the President that if [PER Merkel  ] came , then [PER Sarkozy  ] would be obligated to invite the heads of state of [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Poland  ] , and the [LOC Czech Republic  ] as well.” Moreover , all of those leaders would have to be given an opportunity to speak as well , which would lengthen an already long ceremony . 
The cases of the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Canada  ] were exceptional , he added , because both [PER Gordon Brown  ] and [PER Stephen Harper  ] were in such political trouble at home that the survival of their governments was at stake. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As for the substance of the [PER POTUS-Sarkozy  ] bilat , [PER Levitte  ] previewed the proposed agenda: [LOC Iran  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , [LOC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and its neighbors , and finally a broad discussion of economic issues under the rubric of the [MISC G-20  ] ( e.g. , the economic crisis , regulation , preparation for the next [MISC G-8  ] meeting , the price of gasoline , and climate issues ) . 
[PER Levitte  ] stressed that [PER Sarkozy  ] hoped to announce ( preferably in person to the press , but possibly through a written bulletin ) on June 3 the names of the two [MISC French  ] general officers -- the chiefs of staff of the [MISC French  ] [ORG Air Force  ] and [ORG Navy  ] -- receiving high level [ORG NATO  ] commands in [LOC Norfolk  ] and [LOC Lisbon  ] . 
[LOC Russia/Georgia  ] -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to relations with [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Levitte  ] suggested that [LOC Moscow  ] misconstrued [LOC U.S.  ] policy on [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] officials seemed to interpret [LOC U.S.  ] efforts at improving the atmosphere for talks as a license to walk away from commitments that [PER Sarkozy  ] had extracted from [LOC Russia  ] at the height of the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis . 
In specific , [MISC Russian  ] obstructionism indicates Moscow’s opposition to the presence of international monitors in [LOC Georgia  ] and the breakaway territories . 
While [PER Levitte  ] conceded that [MISC Western  ] relations with [LOC Russia  ] should not hinge solely on the [MISC Georgian  ] question , he nevertheless pointed to the continued need for a firm , united [MISC Western  ] front . 
He noted that [LOC Russia  ] was “testing” the [MISC Europeans  ] through manufactured crises ( e.g. , the natural gas crisis ) as it tried to reassert control over its traditional sphere of influence. “We need to tell them to be careful , [LOC PARIS  ] 00000762 002 OF 003 because your behavior risks changing the relationship ( between [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC West  ] ) , ” said [PER Levitte  ] . 
[PER Gordon  ] agreed that [MISC U.S./EU  ] could not afford to be naive in engaging with [LOC Russia  ] , and stressed the need for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] to draw the same red lines in dealing with [LOC Moscow  ] . 
He observed that while it was comparatively easy for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] to maintain a united front , the same was not true for all of our [MISC European  ] partners . 
[PER Levitte  ] concurred . 
He added that the [MISC Germans  ] were somewhat divided over how to respond to President Medvedev’s proposals . 
Alluding to the differences between FM Steinmeier and Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] , [PER Levitte  ] said: “It’s as if they have two foreign policies.” He emphasized that [LOC Russia  ] should pay a political price if it refuses to allow international observers ( e.g. , UNOMIG and [ORG OSCE  ] ) to remain present in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia:  ] namely , increased [MISC Western  ] assistance to [LOC Georgia.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Levitte  ] returned to the question of international observers , saying that the [LOC West  ] should push [LOC Russia  ] hard in [LOC New York  ] and [LOC Geneva  ] to let the observers stay. “They ( the [MISC Russians  ] ) will accept it if we stay strong , ” [PER Levitte  ] noted , adding that the [MISC Russians  ] must understand that they will pay a price for changing the status quo. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On [ORG NATO  ] expansion , [PER Levitte  ] and [PER Gordon  ] discussed the relative merits of giving [MISC Membership Action Plans  ] ( [ORG MAP  ] ) to other [LOC Balkan  ] countries but not to [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
[PER Levitte  ] suggested that the [MISC Russians  ] would see such a policy as “a gift , ” yet he agreed that [ORG NATO  ] needed to decide whether to continue with [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] or find an alternative mechanism . 
[PER Levitte  ] proposed eliminating the [ORG MAP  ] program altogether , as “each country arrives at membership through its own unique path anyway.” [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] ---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Levitte  ] said he saw a historic opportunity to make progress on [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] and -- although the two are not formally linked -- relations between [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Armenia  ] . 
[PER Gordon  ] agreed that progress between the latter two was unlikely without movement on [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] , a reality the [MISC Armenians  ] understood but had difficulty accepting . 
[PER Levitte  ] suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] remain in contact on this issue , with an eye toward a possible meeting on the margins of the informal ministerial at [LOC Corfu  ] . 
On the question of Turkey’s admission to the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Levitte  ] said that the [LOC Turks  ] themselves had signaled that the important thing was for the process to continue . 
[PER Levitte  ] said the [MISC French  ] fully agreed , since the [ORG EU  ] membership criteria served as an engine for modernizing [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As for the June 3 visit of [MISC Iranian  ] FM [PER Mottaki  ] to [LOC Paris  ] , [PER Levitte  ] said that [PER Mottaki  ] would be received at the [LOC Elysee  ] later that same afternoon . 
[PER Levitte  ] portrayed Mottaki’s visit as the result of [MISC Iranian  ] in-fighting after [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] took umbrage that [PER Ali Akbar Velayati  ] , Supreme Leader Khamenei’s diplomatic advisor , had been received in the past by [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
He noted that the [MISC French  ] had already postponed Mottaki’s visit once as a result of Ahmadinejad’s anti-Semitic rant at the [ORG Durban II  ] conference in [LOC Geneva  ] , which had prompted the [MISC French  ] Ambassador and other [ORG EU  ] representatives to walk out of the session in protest . 
[PER Levitte  ] predicted that [PER Mottaki  ] would have nothing meaningful to say , whereas the [MISC French  ] would deliver two messages to the [LOC Iranians: First  ] , that things “will end badly” if [LOC Iran  ] presses forward with its nuclear program ; second , that [LOC Iran  ] faces “a historic opportunity” with the [LOC U.S.  ] that it must not miss . 
[PER Levitte  ] pledged that [LOC France  ] would “remain the toughest” [LOC U.S.  ] ally when it came to imposing sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] , adding that the [MISC French  ] had no illusions about how difficult it would be to get the [MISC Russians  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] to support tougher measures . 
He suggested that October would be the time to begin drumming up international support for new sanctions , and acknowledged that the [MISC Russians  ] would likely try to extract concessions from the [LOC West  ] on [LOC Georgia  ] and missile defense in exchange . 
Cuba/GTMO --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Levitte  ] said that the new [MISC Administration’s  ] policy on [LOC Cuba  ] was great. “How can we help ? ” asked [PER Levitte  ] , who noted that [PER Sarkozy  ] would travel to the [LOC Caribbean  ] in late June . 
He added that former [MISC French  ] Culture Minister [PER Jack Lang  ] was serving as Sarkozy’s point man on [LOC Cuba  ] , and met with [PER Raul Castro  ] during a recent visit to [ORG Havana.  ] “Your open-handed [LOC PARIS  ] 00000762 003 OF 003 policy is producing some interesting movement inside ( the regime ) , ” [PER Levitte  ] summarized. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Turning to the fate of the [ORG Guantanamo  ] ( [ORG GTMO  ] ) detainees , [PER Levitte  ] said that [MISC France’s  ] acceptance of a first [ORG GTMO  ] returnee was not intended to be a one time gesture . 
To the contrary , the [MISC French  ] saw it as the beginning of a process , and they were currently evaluating other candidates as well . 
However , [LOC France  ] would not accept any detainees who posed a threat to [MISC French  ] security and would only consider taking those with a legitimate tie to [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Levitte  ] noted that [ORG Congressional  ] opposition to the President’s plan to close [ORG GTMO  ] had given [MISC French  ] authorities less room for maneuver on this subject , as the [MISC French  ] public wondered why [LOC France  ] should accept detainees who were too dangerous to be transferred to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
