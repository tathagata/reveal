B. 2008 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 775 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
On October 16 , [PER Poloff  ] delivered reftel demarche and left nonpapers in [MISC English  ] and [MISC Portuguese  ] with [PER Gilda Mattos Santos Neves  ] , head of the [ORG United Nations Division  ] of the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) , who promised to shepherd our request through the [ORG GOB  ] . 
[PER Neves  ] said she would check with the [ORG National Committee for Refugees  ] ( [ORG CONARE  ] ) , under the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] but with [ORG MRE  ] representation , which she believed would have the lead . 
She was concerned , however , that the migrants did not fall neatly into any [MISC Brazilian  ] legal category and were not being handled with the intermediation of the [ORG UNHCR  ] . 
[PER Poloff  ] stressed [ORG UNHCR  ] support for the resettlement program and the active involvement of [LOC IOM.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[PER Neves  ] did not raise any political or diplomatic issues with regard to resettling [MISC Cubans  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] , and she said she would report back to us after she received the views of [ORG CONARE  ] and others in the [LOC GOB.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
On October 28 , [PER Poloff  ] revisited [PER Neves  ] to check on progress with regard to the [MISC Cuban  ] migrants . 
[PER Neves  ] apparently had not received a positive reaction within the [ORG GOB  ] and had nothing to report . 
Based on previous efforts to engage the [ORG GOB  ] on this issue ( ref B ) , we do not expect a definitive response . 
Nonetheless , we will check back periodically .
