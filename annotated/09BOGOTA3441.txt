[PER BOGOTA  ] 3421 ; [PER B. BOGOTA  ] 3375 ; [PER C. BOGOTA  ] 3271 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER William R. Brownfield  ] , Ambassador ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador on November 24 that President [PER Uribe  ] was angry with the [ORG USG  ] for its lack of response to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's aggressions towards [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said the [ORG GOC  ] was interpreting the cancelation of Deputy Secretary of State [PER James Steinberg  ] 's December 1-3 visit to [LOC Colombia  ] as a political signal . 
The Ambassador explained that the visit was only canceled due to a scheduling conflict . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] understood , but said this was further indication of how bad the worrisome anti-USG reaction now was i [LOC Colombia  ] . 
Even the private sector and former presidents and ministers were lashing out . 
The Ambassador said he would seek to address this perception with the media , and urged the [ORG GOC  ] not to fall into [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez'  ] rhetorical trap . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Uribe  ] would discuss [LOC Venezuela  ] with [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] in [LOC Manaus  ] on November 26. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also told the Ambassador that Minister of Defense [PER Gabriel Silva  ] and Armed Forces Commander [PER Freddy Padilla  ] do not get along ; that the [ORG Uribe-Supreme Court  ] standoff would continue well into next year , with the [ORG Supreme Court  ] likely refusing to select a Prosecutor General unless Minister of [LOC Interior  ] and Justice ( [ORG MOIJ  ] ) [PER Fabio Valencia Cossio  ] resigned ; that the [ORG CNP  ] had asked prosecutors to begin arrests and prosecutions in the [ORG Administrative Department of Security  ] ( [ORG DAS  ] ) wiretap cases ; and that extradited narcotics traffickers and paramilitaries were preparing a smear campaign against [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
End Summary . 
[PER URIBE  ] ANGRY AT USG SILENCE ON [LOC VENEZUELA  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] invited the Ambassador and ORA Chief to lunch November 24 to share his worries about the growing anti-United States reaction in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
At a security meeting on November 23 , President [PER Uribe  ] , for the first time in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] memory , expressed open anger with the [ORG USG  ] 's fence-sitting on [LOC Venezuela  ] 's aggressive threats and posture ( ref A ) . 
The [MISC Colombian  ] private sector and the [ORG Presidential Advisory Board  ] ( former presidents and ministers ) were also ventilating against the [ORG USG  ] in private and public . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he was very concerned . 
The Ambassador said he would try to address some of these perceptions with the press on November 25 , but stressed the importance of not falling into President [PER Chavez'  ] rhetorical trap . 
[PER Chavez  ] was currently winning the public relations struggle in [LOC Colombia  ] , which is neither in the [ORG USG  ] or [ORG GOC  ] 's interest . 
[PER Chavez  ] hopes to isolate [LOC Colombia  ] from the region ; he is now accomplishing that and dividing [LOC Colombia  ] from the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared that [PER Uribe  ] had just decided to attend the [ORG Summit of Amazon Nations  ] in [LOC Manaus  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , on November 26 , where he would work with President [PER Lula  ] on [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
DEFENSE MINISTRY DISARRAY ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there were serious , growing problems in the [ORG MOD  ] ( which oversees both the military and the police ) Minister [PER Silva  ] did not trust Armed Forces Chief [PER Gen. Padilla  ] ; they now rarely spoke to one another . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also feels that [PER Silva  ] allows his personal secretary ( from the private sector ) too much access to his meetings , which is a growing security concern . 
[PER Padilla  ] does not allow Army Commander [PER Gonzalez  ] to run the Army , and [PER Silva  ] does not support [PER Padilla  ] , so the Army is adrift and senior officers are playing one off against the other . 
Compounding things , the [ORG Navy  ] was feeling under assault due to the [ORG Rear Admiral  ] [PER Gabriel Arango Bacci  ] narcotics trafficking case ( ref B ) . 
Only the [ORG Air Force  ] and [ORG CNP  ] seemed to be operating on all cylinders . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] himself has comfortable access to both [PER Silva  ] and [PER Uribe  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] urged the [ORG USG  ] to pay attention to [ORG MOD  ] dysfunctionality . 
NO PROSECUTOR GENERAL FOR MONTHS , MINISTER OF INTERIOR & JUTICE RESIGNATION MAY BE ONLY SOLUTION --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the standoff between the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and President [PER Uribe  ] on naming a new Prosecutor General would continue well into 2010 . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] justices were visiting [LOC Spain  ] now and would go into recess upon their return . 
In January , the justices' focus would be on electing a new [ORG Supreme Court  ] president . 
( [ORG Note: Last  ] year , this took three months and 130 votes . 
End Note . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was convinced that the only solution to the Executive-Judiciary standoff was to remove [ORG MOIJ  ] Minister [PER Valencia  ] from office . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] had personalized much of its dislike for the [ORG Uribe Administration  ] in [LOC Valencia.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] conceded that the [ORG Court  ] had a point when it claimed [PER Uribe  ] changed signals on the three-person list of nominees for Prosecutor General . 
The [ORG Uribe Administration  ] haD asked Inspector General [PER Alejandro Ordonez  ] to find a solution with the [ORG Court  ] . 
[PER Ordonez  ] worked out a deal whereby the [ORG Court  ] would accept the list if [PER Juan Angel Palacio  ] 's name was pulled and replaced by former magistrate [PER Gomez Gallego  ] . 
When [PER Ordonez  ] presented this solution to [PER Uribe  ] , the President said he would not abandon his candidate [PER Camilo Ospina  ] and replaced [PER Palacio  ] with State Counselor [PER Marco Antonio Velilla Moreno  ] instead ( [ORG Note: Lawyer  ] [PER Virginia Uribe  ] is the third candidate on the list . 
End Note . 
) . 
The [ORG Court  ] promptly rejected [PER Velilla  ] for his lack of penal experience . 
This rejection of the compromise he had been asked to work out angered [PER Ordonez  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought a long term solution to [LOC Colombia  ] 's judiciary woes might be to split the [ORG MOIJ  ] into two ministries -- Interior and Justice -- but that was unlikely before the May 2010 presidential elections . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] planned to tell [PER Uribe  ] that the only way he saw to resolve the Prosecutor General issue in the near term was for [PER Valencia  ] to resign , with an understanding that the [ORG Supreme Court  ] would then select one of the three nominees on the list . 
[ORG DAS  ] WIRETAPS INVESTIGATIONS --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador inquired as to the state of the investigations into the illegal wiretaps by the [ORG Administrative Department of Security  ] ( [ORG DAS  ] ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said CN investigators had developed cases that should allow prosecutors to arrest and prosecute the suspects ( ref C ) . 
However , he feared that the prosecutors assigned to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] were new and that the supervisory [ORG Court  ] magistrate was determined to make a case against a senior official in the [ORG Presidential Palace  ] . 
Lead prosecutor [PER Maria Consuelo Rincon  ] opposed any prosecution until the investigators had reached the intellectual author . 
The [ORG CNP  ] had delivered its investigatory results to the prosecutors with formal recommendation to proceed with arrests and prosecutions , in an attempt to force a decision by the prosecutors . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expected a positive response next week . 
He acknowledged that there are probably more senior people involved in the illegal wiretaps , but arrests and prosecutions had to begin in order to force the lower level suspects to talk . 
SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NARANJO ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Baruch Vega  ] , a drug trafficker who had served time in the [LOC United States  ] and now resided in [LOC Miami  ] , was conspiring with [PER Don Mario  ] and other extradited [MISC United Self- Defense Forces of  ] [LOC Colombia  ] ( [ORG AUC  ] ) paramilitaries to build a false case against him . 
He said that a number of his officers had reported being approached by these individuals seeking dirt on [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He thought some smear was inevitable , and said he would share the information he had with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is now the second most popular person in [LOC Colombia  ] and perhaps the smartest , best informed member of the [ORG GOC  ] . 
His views and observations are usually worth serious consideration .
