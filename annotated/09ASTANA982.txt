Hoagland  ] , 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: On June 5 , [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador [PER Cheng Guoping  ] hosted the Ambassador for dinner at the restaurant on the 23rd floor of a striking new hotel built in [LOC Astana  ] and owned by the [ORG Chinese National Petroleum Company  ] . 
During a fascinating , wide-ranging , three-hour tour d’horizon , the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador discussed his government’s policy -- and occasionally made personal comments -- on human rights , smart power , President [PER Obama  ] , Afghanistan’s reconstruction , Russia’s policy in [LOC Central Asia  ] , [MISC Georgian  ] President [PER Saakashvili  ] , Iran’s upcoming presidential elections , [LOC North Korea’s  ] nuclear tests , [ORG Central Asia’s  ] energy resources , the [MISC Manas  ] air base , and the proposed international nuclear fuel bank . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador clearly enjoyed the free and easy , open-ended conversation and invited the Ambassador to meet again , at the restaurant , in the near future . 
[PER Guoping  ] was joined by an unidentified policy advisor and an interpreter , to whom he addressed his remarks in soft whispers throughout the evening . 
END SUMMARY . 
CHINA’S [ORG MFA  ] “SCARED” BY PELOSI’S VISIT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Guoping  ] was relaxed , wearing short sleeves and no jacket , and clearly eager to engage and entertain his [MISC American  ] guests . 
He began the evening by referring to the recent visit to [LOC Beijing  ] of House Speaker [PER Nancy Pelosi  ] . 
Without openly acknowledging or discussing the twentieth anniversary of the June 4 , 1989 , [LOC Tiananmen Square  ] protests , [PER Guoping  ] said the government was prepared , and also fearful , for the Speaker to raise human rights and democracy issues during her visit. “She had the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) scared to death on the eve of her visit , ” [PER Guoping  ] said , half-jokingly . 
PRAISE FOR SMART POWER <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Without prompting , [PER Guoping  ] praised President [PER Obama’s  ] leadership style and approach to foreign affairs . 
He singled out the [MISC President’s  ] “effective management” of the financial crisis , for example , calling his decisions to stimulate the [LOC U.S.  ] economy “bold and courageous.” He called the [MISC President’s  ] June 4 speech in [LOC Cairo  ] - which [PER Guoping  ] was able to download in [LOC Mandarin  ] from the [LOC Department’s  ] website - “a milestone for the use of smart power.” [PER Guoping  ] said the [MISC President’s  ] willingness to employ both military and cultural assets would prove to be a “very effective” approach to foreign affairs . 
He observed that statesmen require both in order to achieve their policy objectives and said the [MISC Administration’s  ] use of “smart power is a very good idea.” [MISC IRANIAN  ] ELECTIONS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Guoping  ] perceptively connected the [LOC Cairo  ] speech to upcoming elections in [LOC Iran.  ] “This speech is very timely , ” he said. “I predict that it will influence Iran’s presidential elections , and will be particularly beneficial for reformers in [LOC Iran.”  ] He said that President [PER Obama  ] has already played a positive role in rebuilding [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC Iran  ] and again stressed the importance of the upcoming elections. “The reformists have a chance , ” he said . 
[PER Guoping  ] suggested that it would be impossible for [LOC Iran  ] to ignore President [PER Obama’s  ] overtures for long. “They cannot remain in the background of these global changes in foreign policy . 
If they do , they will become even more isolated than they already are . 
And ultimately , if [LOC Iran  ] doesn’t respond , President [PER Obama  ] will have to change his policy . 
[LOC Iran  ] might be the last country standing for extremism in the [MISC Muslim  ] world , ” he said . 
FOCUS ON THE [ORG TALIBAN  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) About [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Guoping  ] said the [ORG Taliban  ] is the real enemy of the [LOC United States  ] and the “basis for terrorism in [MISC South Asia.”  ] He argued that the [LOC United States  ] must first “eradicate the [ORG Taliban  ] in order to defeat terror in [LOC Iraq”  ] and said the [MISC Administration’s  ] emphasis on [LOC Afghanistan  ] was a shrewd policy. “You have enlisted the help of all governments in the region to assist [ORG ASTANA  ] 00000982 002 OF 004 with the rebuilding of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , saying that to do so is to play a part in the war against terrorism . 
No one is able to say openly that they do not want to combat terrorism , so you have made it very difficult to refuse to help.” [ORG NORTHERN DISTRIBUTION NETWORK  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In particular , [PER Guoping  ] said that the [ORG Northern Distribution Network  ] to transport non-lethal supplies to [LOC U.S.  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has enabled many countries to participate in Afghanistan’s reconstruction . 
He said that the [MISC Chinese  ] government is aware of the [LOC U.S.  ] government’s request to transit non-lethal supplies via [LOC China  ] and said “we are actively researching this suggestion . 
In essence , it would mean that the [LOC People’s Republic of China  ] would be supporting a [ORG NATO  ] military operation , which would be an interesting development.” [PER Guoping  ] confided that China’s [ORG MFA  ] and its [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] have different opinions on the subject , although he said he expected a decision soon. “My own personal opinion , ” he said , “is that we will do the right thing and cooperate with [ORG NATO  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] government in Afghanistan.” [PER Guoping  ] said this would be an appropriate issue to raise in the context of the [MISC President’s  ] visit to [LOC Beijing  ] in July . 
RUSSIA’S POLICY IN [LOC CENTRAL ASIA  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Guoping  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] is experiencing “severe difficulty” now because of the global financial crisis . 
He suggested that the government of [LOC Russia  ] is eager to improve relations with the [LOC United States  ] now because [LOC Moscow  ] is concerned that the economic downturn will begin to affect the political stability of the country , “even the stability of the [ORG Kremlin.”  ] [PER Guoping  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] does not want or need any foreign policy problems right now ; “they need to focus on their domestic , economic affairs.” [PER Guoping  ] also said that [LOC Russia  ] would like more support from the [LOC United States  ] for its insistence on a privileged sphere of influence in [LOC Central Asia  ] , in exchange for greater cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] “Russia is convinced that they must dominate [LOC Central Asia  ] and the [MISC Caucasus  ] . 
They believe they have vital , strategic , historical interests in the region , ” [PER Guoping  ] said . 
When pressed by the Ambassador to express his own opinion , [PER Guoping  ] said , “I personally do not agree that [LOC Russia  ] should be granted a special sphere of influence in the region , but that is their view.” ON [LOC GEORGIA  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On [LOC Georgia  ] , [PER Guoping  ] said he expects [LOC Russia  ] to use military force to overthrow [MISC Georgian  ] President [PER Saakashvili  ] . 
He did not elaborate or offer any specifics , but merely observed that [LOC Russia  ] has already established military bases in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] and is likely to remain there for the foreseeable future . 
[PER Guoping  ] worked in [LOC Georgia  ] for four years and understands well the history and culture of its people . 
He observed that [LOC South Ossetia  ] has strong cultural ties to [LOC Russia  ] , but said it is likely that the [MISC Ossetians  ] will ultimately press for greater independence from [MISC Russian  ] influence. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In unusually blunt language , [PER Guoping  ] said [PER Saakashvili  ] is “not a mature statesman . 
He overreacted to [MISC Russian  ] provocations and gave [LOC Russia  ] the opportunity to take [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia.”  ] [PER Guoping  ] suggested that Secretary Rice’s July 2008 visit to [LOC Georgia  ] before the war in August 2008 , might have indirectly encouraged [PER Saakashvili  ] to take military action . 
He said his understanding was that [PER Saakashvili  ] briefed Secretary [PER Rice  ] on his plans to mobilize [MISC Georgian  ] armed forces and when she did not directly object , [PER Saakashvili  ] mistook that as a sign of [LOC U.S.  ] support . 
[PER Guoping  ] said , “Clearly , [LOC Russia  ] baited and cheated [LOC Georgia  ] . 
But [PER Saakashvili  ] was impressed with his earlier success in [LOC Batumi  ] ( [LOC Adjara  ] ) and he thought he could involve the [LOC United States  ] in the war.” [PER Guoping  ] said he expects former Parliament Speaker [PER Nino Burjanadze  ] to become [PER Georgia’s  ] next president. “She is much more mature than [PER Saakashvili  ] . 
He won’t stay long , ” he said . 
[ORG NORTH KOREA’S  ] NUCLEAR TESTS , DOMESTIC POLITICS <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Guoping  ] seemed genuinely concerned by [ORG North Korea’s  ] recent [ORG ASTANA  ] 00000982 003 OF 004 nuclear missile tests. “We need to solve this problem . 
It is very troublesome , ” he said , calling [ORG Korea’s  ] nuclear activity a “threat to the whole world’s security.” [LOC China  ] opposes [ORG North Korea’s  ] nuclear testing and is working to achieve peace and stability on the [MISC Korean  ] peninsula , according to [PER Guoping  ] . 
When asked about the reunification of [LOC Korea  ] , [PER Guoping  ] said [LOC China  ] hopes for peaceful reunification in the long-term , but he expects the two countries to remain separate in the short-term . 
[PER Guoping  ] said the domestic political situation in [LOC North Korea  ] is “very complex” and suggested that [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] reported decision to anoint his youngest son as his successor was driven more by Kim’s deteriorating health than any carefully planned strategy. “They had no time to plan for this , ” he said . 
[PER Guoping  ] said the “military really governs” [LOC North Korea  ] and controls domestic politics and foreign policy . 
He suggested that [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] announcement was designed to send a message to the military and the great powers that he is really in charge and in control . 
[PER Guoping  ] said China’s objectives in [LOC North Korea  ] were to ensure they honor their commitments on nonproliferation , maintain stability , and “don’t drive [ [PER Kim Jong-il  ] ] mad.” CENTRAL ASIAN ENERGY <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to a discussion of energy resources and energy security in [LOC Central Asia  ] , [PER Guoping  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] owns and controls most of [LOC Central Asia’s  ] pipelines , “but it cannot prevent the ultimate diversification of export routes.” He said that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] are close to [LOC Russia  ] , but they nevertheless understand that they must seek and develop alternatives . 
He predicted that they will soon “break the [MISC Russian  ] monopoly” on the export of hydrocarbons from the region and said the oil and gas pipelines to [LOC China  ] now under construction will be “very important” in that regard . 
[PER Guoping  ] said that Kazakhstan’s oil pipeline from [LOC Atasu  ] to [LOC Alashankou  ] would be completed in July and will initially carry 200,000 barrels per day ( bbl/d ) , but will soon be expanded to 400,000 bbl/d . 
He said [LOC China  ] would encourage [MISC Western  ] oil companies to ship their production eastward . 
He was aware of plans to ship [MISC Kazakhstani  ] oil across the [LOC Caspian Sea  ] by tanker and said [LOC China  ] had no objections to the project , which they considered “strictly commercial.” When asked about China’s recent $10 billion loan to [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [PER Guoping  ] confirmed that $5 billion was earmarked for investments in the energy sector , including the purchase of 50% of [LOC MangistauMunaiGas  ] , while the remaining $5 billion would be delivered to the [ORG Development Bank of Kazakhstan  ] as a “soft loan that the government would be free to use as it likes.” POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP WITH [LOC U.S.  ] OIL COMPANIES <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Guoping  ] said [LOC China  ] sees “great potential for an energy partnership with [LOC U.S.  ] companies in [LOC Central Asia  ] , ” including the development of onshore resources in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
He said that the [MISC Chinese  ] MFA is very interested in pursuing these opportunities and suggested that this would be worth including in the [MISC China-U.S  ] . 
[ORG Strategic Economic Dialogue.  ] “This is very reasonable , ” he said , adding , “Our government would actively support such a proposal.” The Ambassador noted that [ORG Chevron  ] is already working with [MISC Chinese  ] companies in western [LOC China  ] . 
ON [PER NAZARBAYEV  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Commenting on President [PER Nazarbayev  ] , [PER Guoping  ] called him a “wise and mature statesman , ” who has presided over a period of remarkable stability and economic growth . 
He praised President Nazarbayev’s foreign policy skills and added that China’s MFA has “great respect” for President [PER Nazarbayev  ] and holds him in high regard . 
[MISC MANAS  ] AIR BASE <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Referring to the [ORG Manas  ] air base , [PER Guoping  ] said that the government of [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] has tried to show similar sophistication in balancing the interests of the great powers in the neighborhood , but has been much less successful . 
He said that according to his information , the [LOC United States  ] is prepared to pay an additional $50 million a year to the government of [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] “to make them think [ORG ASTANA  ] 00000982 004 OF 004 about” keeping the base open . 
He said he has seen a subtle shift in [LOC U.S.  ] policy in the region , adding , “You’ve also made important progress in [LOC Uzbekistan  ] . 
We ourselves have noticed a change in [MISC Uzbekistan’s  ] foreign policy over the last year , especially toward [MISC Russia.”  ] NUCLEAR FUEL BANK <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Guoping  ] did not appear to be well briefed on the subject of the [MISC IAEA-administered  ] international nuclear fuel bank proposed by the [ORG Nuclear Threat Initiative  ] . 
He was aware of [MISC Russia’s  ] earlier proposal to host a fuel bank , but he seemed surprised when told that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] has announced its intention to host an [MISC IAEA-administered  ] fuel bank on its territory . 
Indeed , he went so far as to question the accuracy of the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] information that [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] supported Kazakhstan’s proposal during his state visit to [LOC Astana  ] in [LOC April.  ] “We are still conducting research on this idea , ” [PER Guoping  ] said , subtly indicating his unwillingness - or inability - to discuss the subject further. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) COMMENT: In the past six months , the Ambassador and [PER Guoping  ] have established a relaxed , open , and even frank relationship . 
[PER Guoping  ] prefers to meet the Ambassador in the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy or in a public place , having explained previously that he believes his own Embassy’s temporary quarters are thoroughly bugged -- by whom , he doesn’t say . 
[ORG CNPC  ] built the high-rise , pagoda-roofed [LOC Beijing  ] hotel as a gift to [LOC Astana  ] . 
The marble lobby is impressive , if a bit too totalitarian-austere . 
The hotel was supposed to have opened in January , and we are not convinced that it is now fully open for business . 
We were the only guests in the restaurant , although an untouched full buffet was laid out . 
The revolving restaurant provides a spectacular panorama of [LOC Astana  ] , and the empty steppe beyond , but it seems to revolve at varying speeds and sometimes can be a bit too fast on a full stomach and after a few glasses of wine . 
END COMMENT .
