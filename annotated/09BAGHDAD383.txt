( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: [PER Ayad Jamaleddin  ] , a [ORG Council of Representatives  ] member from the secular [LOC Iraqiyya  ] list , painted an extreme view of [MISC Iranian  ] religious influence in [LOC Iraq  ] during a meeting with Emboffs on February 11 . 
Claiming that [LOC Iran  ] is paying clerics across [LOC Iraq  ] to deliver Friday sermons sympathetic to [LOC Iran  ] and its political theology , [PER Jamaleddin  ] stated he had been urged by an emissary of [PER Ayatollah Muhammad Sayyid Al-Hakim  ] , a first cousin of [PER Abdelaziz Al-Hakim  ] and a potential heir to [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] , to spread the warning about [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Jamaleddin  ] warned of " [LOC Iran  ] 's ability to summon sleeping militias across [LOC Iraq  ] " to resume attacks and alleged that [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians were visiting an [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence officer in [LOC Qom  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , under the cover of pilgrimage . 
Although secular in politics , [PER Jamaleddin  ] wears the black turban of a sayyed , a descent of the Prophet , and was most animated about the pernicious effects of [LOC Iran  ] on [LOC Shi'a  ] religious doctrine . 
He urged the [ORG USG  ] to provide a media outlet for [LOC Shi'a  ] clerics who will resist [MISC Iranian  ] theology . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Media outlets including [MISC Al-Arabiyah  ] satellite channel have carried interviews recently with [PER Ayad Jamaleddin  ] , a parliamentarian elected on [PER Ayad Alawi  ] 's secular nationalist [LOC Iraqiyya  ] list , warning of [LOC Iran  ] 's encroaching influence in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Jamaleddin  ] told al-Arabiyah on January 20 that a " quick and hasty [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] means turning [LOC Iraq  ] into an [MISC Iranian  ] governorate , " emphasizing that an [MISC Iranian  ] presence in [LOC Iraq  ] is more dangerous than an [MISC American  ] presence in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jamaleddin  ] is among several contacts who have reached out to the Embassy recently to warn about [MISC Iranian  ] influence , which is a favorite topic of conversation among a wide range of [MISC Iraqis  ] . 
He claims to be carrying the message of [PER Ayatollah Muhammad  ] [PER Sayyid Al-Hakim  ] , a potential heir to [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] and first cousin of [PER Abdelaziz Al-Hakim  ] , head of the [ORG Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) , the political party closest to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Despite [PER Al-Hakim  ] 's [ORG ISCI  ] family ties , he urged [PER Jamaladdin  ] through an emissary to " go to [LOC Washington  ] , to [LOC Tel Aviv  ] , anywhere " to seek help to stop [LOC Iran  ] , s nefarious project to subjugate [LOC Iraq  ] , according to [PER Jamaleddin  ] . 
[PER Jamaleddin  ] said he was surprised this message was coming from the [PER Ayatollah  ] , but the emissary maintained that [LOC Iran  ] 's aggressive efforts had struck terror into the hearts of the entire [MISC Najafi  ] clerical establishment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Specifically , [PER Jamaleddin  ] claimed to us that [LOC Iran  ] is paying " 10,000 " imams across southern [LOC Iraq  ] $200 USD a month to deliver Friday sermons that inspire the faithful with righteous rhetoric and subtly include a positive gloss on [LOC Iran  ] . 
In our meeting February 11 and an earlier meeting February 9 , he repeated several times that he was not afraid for himself or [LOC Iraq  ] , but rather the whole region , claiming that [LOC Iran  ] is already controlling [LOC Gaza  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
He emphasizing that the [LOC Khomeini  ] ideology of wilayat al-Faqih ( jurisdiction of clerics ) is " the most vile , [MISC Satanic  ] ideology " ever devised by man " it 's much worse than [MISC Nazism  ] . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As for [LOC Iraq  ] , he said , every member of the [MISC Iraqi  ] cabinet who travels to [LOC Iran  ] visits the religious center of [LOC Qom  ] to pay homage to [PER Jawwad Shahristani  ] , who he identified as the [ORG Iranian Ministry of Intelligence  ] and [ORG Security ( MOIS  ] ) Qthe [ORG Iranian Ministry of Intelligence  ] and [ORG Security ( MOIS  ] ) official responsible for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
They go to [LOC Qom  ] as if they are going to pray at the [LOC Ka'ba  ] ( in [LOC Mecca  ] ) , he said , citing in particular GoI spokesman [PER Ali Dabbagh  ] . 
He added that [PER Shahristani  ] is the son-in-law of Grand [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] and head of [PER Sistani  ] 's office in [LOC Qom.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) We pressed [PER Jamaleddin  ] on his contention that [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] is increasing , noting that [LOC Iraq  ] had signed the [ORG Security Agreement  ] and [ORG Strategic Framework Agreement  ] with the [ORG USG  ] despite [MISC Iranian  ] opposition and that in visits to [LOC Basra  ] , for instance , we hear from many [MISC Iraqis  ] who hate [LOC Iran  ] because of their memories of the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war and , more recently , [MISC Iranian-sponsored  ] militia violence . 
He responded that " they hate [LOC Iran  ] , but they don't hate money . 
" He compared the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] relationship to the [MISC Syria-Lebanon  ] relationship , saying that [LOC Syria  ] controls [LOC Lebanon  ] even though [MISC Lebanese  ] are , like [MISC Iraqis  ] , strong and independent people who seek to be free from foreign influence . 
Likewise we pressed [PER Jamaleddin  ] on his [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000383 002 OF 002 contention that [LOC Iran  ] controls militias in southern [LOC Iraq  ] , noting that the violence has decreased from the period of a year or two ago . 
He responded that [MISC Iranian-sponsored  ] militias have hidden weapons and retain the ability to rise up if summoned by [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) When asked what the appropriate [ORG USG  ] response should be , he urged us to stop " supporting " [MISC Iranian-sponsored  ] political parties such as [ORG ISCI  ] . 
He did not dispute our response that in fact the [ORG USG  ] does not support any particular party or politician , and in fact urged us to provide media access to clerics who are willing to stand up to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He mentioned in particular a [MISC Lebanese  ] cleric he identified as [PER Ayatollah Ali  ] al-Amin. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Jamaleddin  ] 's extreme anti-Iranian rhetoric is nothing unusual ; we hear such sentiments frequently , although not always with so much colorful detail . 
However , it is notable that he claims to be carrying the message of [PER Ayatollah Muhammad  ] [PER Sayyid Al-Hakim  ] and that the [ORG ISCI  ] setback in the January 31 provincial elections , which is generally viewed as a setback to [LOC Iran  ] ( reftel ) , has done nothing to mitigate his concerns about [MISC Iranian  ] influence .
