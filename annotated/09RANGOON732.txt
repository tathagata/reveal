( S ) [ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] , who on [ DETAILS [MISC REMOVED  ] ] informed [MISC Australian  ] Ambassador [PER Chan  ] in [LOC Rangoon  ] that [LOC Burma  ] and the [LOC DPRK  ] were engaged in “peaceful nuclear cooperation” ( reftel ) , has changed [ DETAILS [MISC REMOVED  ] ] story . 
In a November 9 conversation with Ambassador [PER Chan  ] , [ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] said there had been a “misunderstanding.” After Chan’s “blunt” response to the August revelation ( [PER Chan  ] had responded with incredulity to the thought that the [ORG GOB  ] might consider nuclear cooperation of any sort with the [LOC DPRK  ] to be acceptable ) , [ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] had checked around [LOC Nay Pyi  ] Taw . 
[ DETAILS [MISC REMOVED  ] ] now says [MISC GOB-DPRK  ] conversations were merely “exploratory.” [ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] cannot confirm any direct nuclear cooperation . 
[ DETAILS [MISC REMOVED  ] ] added that , in any case , the [ORG Kang Nam  ] 1 affair and Secretary [PER Clinton’s remarks  ] in [LOC Phuket  ] in July “put everything on hold.” <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] observed that [LOC Russia  ] is the key [ORG GOB  ] partner for a nuclear reactor , but [ DETAILS [MISC REMOVED  ] ] said there has been no progress . 
[LOC Russia  ] has proposed a commercial deal , and the [ORG GOB  ] cannot afford it . 
[ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] added that many countries have relations with the [LOC DPRK  ] , including [LOC Australia  ] , “so why worry ? ! ” Comment ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) As with many issues in [LOC Burma  ] , the truth behind and possible motivations for [ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] first version and the recent revision are difficult to ascertain . 
Ambassador [PER Chan  ] now believes [ DETAILS [MISC REMOVED  ] ] was simply speculating in August and has corrected the record . 
We were not in the actual conversations , but to us [ DETAILS [MISC REMOVED  ] ] revision sounds more like an effort to cover a lapse in judgment than to deny the earlier story outright . 
The comment about the [ORG Kang Nam  ] 1 and the Secretary’s remarks having “put everything on hold” leave room for concern . 
That noted , other of [ NAME [MISC REMOVED  ] ] comments have caused us to question just how well plugged in [ NAME REMOVED ] is on the “nuclear” issue . 
Bottom line: [MISC GOB-DPRK  ] cooperation remains opaque . 
Something is certainly happening ; whether that something includes “nukes” is a very open question which remains a very high priority for [MISC Embassy  ] reporting .
