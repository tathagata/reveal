( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The [MISC Megaports  ] program to scan for nuclear or radiological materials in shipping containers was implemented March 2006 in [LOC Algeciras  ] with respect to scanning import and export traffic . 
During meetings May 18 , [ORG USG  ] and host nation officials agreed on a plan to implement the transshipment ( ship to ship transfers ) element of the [MISC Megaports  ] program . 
Assuming this plan is successfully implemented , it should serve as a model for higher-risk ports in preventing illegal nuclear and radiological materials hidden in transshipment containers from ever reaching [LOC US  ] ports . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When the [MISC Megaports  ] initiative in [LOC Algeciras  ] went live in March , 2006 ( see reftel ) , [ORG USG  ] and host nation officials intended that both the export/import traffic as well as the transshipment traffic would be scanned . 
One year later , only the export/import cargo , representing just 10 percent of total port traffic , is being checked under the [LOC Algeciras  ] [MISC Megaports  ] program . 
During discussions the week of May 15 , [ORG Maersk  ] company - serving as both the [LOC Algeciras  ] terminal operator as well as the major port shipping company - indicated to [ORG Department of Energy  ] ( [ORG DOE  ] ) and [ORG Mission  ] officials that the implementation delay was due to factors beyond their control . 
[ORG Maersk  ] cited insufficient customs staffing as well as pushback from local laborers , caused primarily by a perception that transshipment cargo scanning would result in lower productivity and hence lower pay. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Though [LOC Algeciras  ] itself is not commonly believed to be a high risk port for shipments , the port 's willingness in 2004 to partner with the [MISC Megaports  ] program as well as its unusually heavy flow of transshipment traffic ( estimated at 90% ) made it an attractive port for testing out ways to scan transshipment containers . 
This type of scanning is logistically challenging given the sometimes quick timeframe in which cargo must be offloaded from one ship onto its connecting ship . 
[MISC Megaports  ] is currently being implemented in a select few ports world-wide though primarily for export/import traffic. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When [ORG Embassy  ] and [ORG DOE  ] officials met with [MISC Spanish  ] customs enforcement on May 18 , the [MISC Spanish  ] customs team led by [PER Ignacio Gonzalez Garcia  ] resolved to look into increasing staffing to support the program . 
[PER Gonzalez Garcia  ] also agreed to work with [ORG Maersk  ] terminal operator to resolve implementation issues brought on by labor pressures . 
The local labor pushback , [PER Gonzalez Garcia  ] argued , could be addressed by beginning implementation on a limited scope - scanning a lower number of containers than originally planned . 
Once local labor realized that productivity would not be affected , then the scanning program could be expanded to its full scope . 
[ORG Maersk  ] , having originally suggested this idea in previous meetings , would be amenable to implementing this limited plan. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment: Expansion of Megaports  ] to [LOC Barcelona  ] and [LOC Valencia  ] is on the agenda for the future . 
[ORG DOE  ] 's willingness to move quickly on this expansion will depend in part upon the successful implementation of the [LOC Algeciras  ] transshipment plan . 
Successful implementation of this initiative is a priority for the [ORG Embassy  ] , particularly given the benefits and " lessons learned " it may impart when [MISC Megaports  ] expands to other ports world-wide that have shipments going to the [LOC US  ] .
