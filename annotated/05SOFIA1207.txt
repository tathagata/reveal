A. STATE  ] 99125 B. [PER B. SOFIA  ] 1046 Classified By: AMBASSADOR [PER JAMES PARDEW  ] , FOR REASON 1.4 ( C ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) This cable is in response to ref A request for information about organized crime in [LOC Bulgaria  ] and the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
Where direct sources are not cited , connections are largely based on information from operational contacts and open-source publications. ----------------------- OVERVIEW AND ACTIVITIES ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The strength and immunity from the law of organized crime ( [ORG OC  ] ) groups is arguably the most serious problem in [LOC Bulgaria  ] today . 
[ORG OC  ] activities underlie corruption and the ineffectiveness of the legal system in [LOC Bulgaria  ] , and inhibit the country , s economic development . 
[MISC Bulgarian  ] [ORG OC  ] is particularly involved in international money laundering , drug trafficking , and counterfeiting . 
[ORG OC  ] groups range from local street thugs involved in extortion to sophisticated international narcotic dealers and money launderers . 
An estimated 118 organized crime groups were operating in [LOC Bulgaria  ] at the end of 2004 , according to the [ORG National Service for Combating Organized Crime  ] ( [ORG NSBOP  ] ) of the [MISC Bulgarian  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( MoI ) , though many of these groups are relatively small and the landscape is dominated by a handful of big players . 
Organized crime continues to be pervasive in many spheres of [MISC Bulgarian  ] life , despite domestic and international efforts to combat it . 
To date , not a single major [ORG OC  ] figure has been punished by the [MISC Bulgarian  ] legal system , despite an on-going series of OC-related assassinations . 
[LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies with offices in [LOC Sofia  ] are supporting the effort to reduce [ORG OC  ] in [LOC Bulgaria  ] . 
The [ORG Fraud Prevention Unit  ] in [ORG Embassy Sofia’s Consular Section  ] maintains a list of known and suspected major organized crime figures , and [ORG Embassy Sofia  ] has an aggressive policy of preventing [ORG OC  ] figures from traveling to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OC  ] groups are known to be involved in narcotics trafficking , prostitution , extortion and racketeering , various financial crimes , car theft , and trafficking in stolen automobiles . 
Human trafficking for sexual exploitation , counterfeiting , and debit and credit card fraud also are some of the most common criminal activities engaged in by [MISC Bulgarian  ] organized crime . 
Crime groups involved in human trafficking are extremely mobile , and victims are often sold or traded amongst various groups . 
Many groups use a host of legitimate businesses domestically and abroad to launder the proceeds of their illegal activities . 
Several well-known businessmen linked to organized crime have parlayed their wealth into ownership of sports teams , property developments , and financial institutions . 
( An organized crime activity that received special attention due to its growth in 2004 was VAT ( value-added tax ) fraud . 
The [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] estimated that VAT fraud cost the [MISC Bulgarian  ] treasury over $700 million in losses annually . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Counterfeit currency -- both [LOC U.S.  ] dollar and , increasingly , [MISC Euro  ] banknotes -- is produced in [LOC Bulgaria  ] and distributed primarily in [LOC France  ] , [LOC Greece  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and [LOC Spain  ] by small groups of [MISC Bulgarians  ] who return to [LOC Bulgaria  ] immediately after making delivery . 
While there is thought to be cooperation between [MISC Bulgarian  ] groups and other international organized crime groups , the couriers , middlemen and distributors are predominantly [MISC Bulgarian  ] . 
The quality of counterfeit currency is continuously improving due to increasingly sophisticated printing facilities and the involvement of professional individuals with considerable printing skills . 
A June 2005 raid in northeast [LOC Bulgaria  ] -- part of a joint operation between [MISC Bulgarian  ] law enforcement and the [ORG U.S. Secret Service  ] -- netted more than $3 million in high-quality counterfeit $100 banknotes ( ref B ) . 
This was the second largest counterfeit seizure in [MISC European  ] history. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC U.S.-based  ] investigations of transnational crime groups have dismantled significant drug trafficking organizations run by [MISC Bulgarian  ] nationals in [LOC Los Angeles  ] and [LOC Tampa  ] . 
These groups imported multi-kilo quantities of cocaine and multi-thousand doses of ecstasy into the [LOC United States  ] . 
They had drug connections through [LOC Amsterdam  ] and some financial backing of an [MISC Israeli  ] national . 
While most members of these groups were convicted and imprisoned in the [LOC U.S.  ] , three who were charged in [LOC California  ] and [LOC Florida  ] are still wanted international fugitives who may have returned to [LOC Bulgaria  ] to exploit the country’s current policy of not extraditing its citizens . 
The three fugitives are [MISC IVAYLO  ] ANGELOV PETKOV ( [MISC Bulgarian  ] citizen born 18 May 1965 ) , [PER IVAN DOBREV  ] ( [MISC Bulgarian  ] citizen born 25 May 1959 ) , and [ORG STEFAN TZVETANOV STOYANOV  ] ( [MISC Bulgarian  ] citizen born 9 January 1966 ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other investigations in the [LOC U.S.  ] have identified [MISC Bulgarian  ] nationals manufacturing and selling false identity documents for use in organized bank fraud , mortgage fraud , credit card fraud , and alien smuggling. -------------------------------------- WHO’S WHO IN [MISC BULGARIAN  ] ORGANIZED CRIME -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Since the fall of Communism in 1989 and the turbulent 1990s , [MISC Bulgaria’s  ] organized crime scene has undergone major changes , much like the rest of [MISC Bulgaria’s  ] economic , political , and social landscape . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is thought to have connections to [MISC Russian  ] organized crime , including the notorious [MISC Russian  ] crime figure , [PER MICHAEL CHORNY  ] ( see [MISC RUSSIAN  ] INFLUENCE ) . 
[MISC XXXXXXXXXXX  ] Before he was shot dead in [LOC Amsterdam  ] in December 2003 , [PER KONSTANTIN DIMITROV  ] ( [MISC Bulgarian  ] citizen born 21 November 1970 , also known as “SAMOKOVETSA” ) was one of the biggest smugglers in [LOC Bulgaria  ] and the country’s top drug lord . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] As the largest player in the drugs market , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] controls trafficking routes , production facilities , and distribution networks . 
The group is also involved in trafficking stolen automobiles from [LOC Western Europe  ] to the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
Its other criminal activities include extortion and racketeering , illegal arms trading , gambling , prostitution , and smuggling . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The group is thought to have the largest share in Sofia’s escort and intimate services businesses , which are used as fronts for prostitution and trafficking in women for sexual exploitation . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] illegal activities include money laundering , privatization fraud , intimidation , and extortion and racketeering . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The group’s criminal activities include prostitution , narcotics , and trafficking stolen automobiles. <a id='parL' href='#parL'>¶</a>L . 
( C ) [MISC RUSSIAN  ] INFLUENCE [LOC Russia  ] continues to exercise significant influence over the [MISC Bulgarian  ] economy through energy imports , including crude oil , natural gas and nuclear fuel . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Despite  ] the fact that he is no longer the owner of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [MISC Russian  ] mobster [PER MICHAEL CHORNY  ] is thought to retain influence over the company through his ties to members of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The court decision suggests that [PER Chorny  ] is still in control of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , as the judge presiding over the [ORG Supreme Administrative Court  ] panel for the [ORG BTC  ] case also revoked the Government , s decision banning [PER Chorny  ] from entering the country . 
In addition , [PER Chorny  ] has connections to XXXXXXXXXXX [PER CHORNY  ] has also maintained influence over a number of companies by transferring ownership to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX LUKOIL  ] , s representative in [LOC Bulgaria  ] is [LOC XXXXXXXXXXX  ] The [MISC Russian  ] petroleum company is estimated to be the largest corporate taxpayer in [LOC Bulgaria  ] . 
It also controls [MISC Russian  ] oil exports to [LOC Bulgaria  ] . 
Lukoil’s [MISC Bulgarian  ] operations , through [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , are suspected of strong ties to [MISC Russian  ] intelligence and organized crime . 
[LOC XXXXXXXXXXX  ] ---------------------------------------- POLITICS: THE NEXUS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Organized crime has a corrupting influence on all [MISC Bulgarian  ] institutions , including the government , parliament and judiciary . 
In an attempt to maintain their influence regardless of who is in power , [ORG OC  ] figures donate to all the major political parties . 
As these figures have expanded into legitimate businesses , they have attempted -- with some success -- to buy their way into the corridors of power . 
During the 2001 general elections , a number of influential “businessmen , ” including [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , heavily financed and otherwise supported the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] campaign . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX10 . 
( C ) Below the level of the national government and the leadership of the major political parties , [ORG OC  ] “owns” a number of municipalities and individual members of parliament . 
This direct participation in politics -- as opposed to bribery -- is a relatively new development for [MISC Bulgarian  ] [ORG OC  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXX Similarly  ] in the regional center of [LOC XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG OC  ] figures control the municipal council and the mayor’s office . 
Nearly identical scenarios have played out in half a dozen smaller towns and villages across [LOC Bulgaria.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Despite continuing pressure from the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] , past [MISC Bulgarian  ] governments have done little to reduce the presence of organized crime . 
As a result , [ORG OC  ] has increased its influence and is able to operate with virtual impunity . 
The [MISC Bulgarian  ] public recognizes [ORG OC  ] , s corrupting influence , and people are clearly frustrated by the government , s inability or unwillingness to deal with the problem . 
We continue to provide technical assistance to reform-minded elements of the [MISC Bulgarian  ] government and judiciary -- and to speak out on the need to fight corruption and organized crime -- but real political leverage on this issue lies with the [ORG EU  ] . 
A delay in [LOC Bulgaria  ] , s accession would be politically disastrous for the incoming government . 
If the [ORG EU  ] uses this leverage to demand not only far-reaching judicial reform but effective implementation as well , there is reason to hope that the tide will slowly begin to turn against organized crime in the coming years .
