( U ) In a year-end meeting December 30 to evaluate his third year in office , President [PER Evo Morales  ] took time to validate and celebrate his decision on September 11 to expel Ambassador [PER Philip Goldberg  ] , whom he accused of leading a conspiracy to topple the [PER Morales  ] regime . 
" After suffering that attack of the ( political ) right , of the empire , I was not wrong in that moment when I decided the Ambassador had to leave . 
The Ambassador leaves , the opposition bottoms out -- clearly someone was commanding the conspiracy against democracy , even against the national government itself . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Morales  ] went on to accuse the [MISC Bush  ] administration of violating its international commitments in the fight against narco-trafficking , saying [LOC Bolivia  ] " is the most outstanding country in [LOC Latin America  ] in the fight against drug trafficking . 
" Local press reports and even the government 's own media service noted that the precipitous fall in relations had been exacerbated by [ORG Morales'  ] " personal decision " to suspend [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration  ] ( [ORG DEA  ] ) activities in the country . 
The official media service went a step further , adding that [PER Morales  ] also suspended [ORG CIA  ] activity , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] brought the suspension on itself by " meddling in internal affairs . 
" Despite his attacks on Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] , the [MISC Bush  ] administration , and the " empire of the north " generally , [PER Morales  ] was quick to state once again that bilateral relations would be re-evaluated once President-elect [PER Obama  ] was in office. - - - - Comment - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) True to form , [ORG Morales'  ] mention of declaring Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] persona non grata grabbed media attention and distracted focus from more pressing matters , including the [LOC Quintana  ] corruption scandal , the falling price of natural gas ( and with it the possible reduction of [ORG Morales'  ] popular [PER Renta Dignidad  ] program ) , and his recent admission that some cocaleros are selling their coca to be processed into cocaine . 
As illogical as [ORG Morales'  ] diatribes arguments are , as long as he can get mileage out of such attacks , the administration will continue to spread its vitriol .
