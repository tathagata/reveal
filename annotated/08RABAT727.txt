Riley  ] for reasons 1.4 ( a ) and ( b ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Royal Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG FAR  ] ) are modernizing but remain weighed down by long-standing problems . 
King [PER Mohammed VI  ] , who in 1999 inherited a military in need of professionalization , has implemented some needed reforms , but much remains to be done . 
Civilian control , if ascribed to the person of the King , is complete , but there is no real [ORG Defense Ministry  ] . 
Outside the [ORG FAR  ] , there is only a small administration . 
The military remains plagued by corruption , an inefficient bureaucracy , low levels of education in the ranks , periodic threats of radicalization of some of its soldiers , political marginalization , and the deployment of most of its forces in the [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
There have been some indications of pending changes in the leadership . 
In general , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] share a robust military relationship with prospects for even closer ties in the future . 
The health of the relationship is evident by increased [MISC U.S.-Moroccan  ] military training exercises and [LOC Morocco  ] 's purchase of sophisticated weapons from the [LOC U.S.  ] to include 24 F-16s this year . 
We anticipate that the [MISC U.S.-Moroccan  ] military relationship will continue to flourish but [LOC Morocco  ] 's ability to absorb its new high-end military purchases and restrictions on high quality [MISC Moroccan  ] information sharing with our attaches represent two challenges ahead . 
This mission-coordinated report draws heavily on valuable reporting and analysis from the embassy 's military components , the [ORG Defense Attache Office  ] and the [ORG Office of Security Cooperation  ] . 
End Summary. ------------------ All the King 's Men ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As Commander-in-Chief of the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Royal Armed Forces  ] and Minister of Defense , King [PER Mohammed VI  ] maintains a highly centralized role over the military . 
No troop movements , exercises , or even travel of officers domestically or abroad happens without the King , s approval . 
As a result of the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts by the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Army  ] and [ORG Air Force  ] respectively , the Palace increased control over the military , marginalized it from policy making , and restricted its interaction with foreign military interlocutors and the press . 
The Alaouite dynasty depends upon , among other things , a strong military , the leadership of which , however , must remain sufficiently docile so as not to arouse suspicions of disloyalty . 
The only civilian structure responsible for the [ORG FAR  ] is not a [ORG Defense Ministry  ] but rather an entity under the Prime Minister responsible for the [ORG Administration of the National Defense  ] . 
It is headed by Minister-delegate [PER Abderrahmane Sbai  ] , whose role is essentially restricted to that of comptroller . 
As far as we can tell , political-military policy on issues such as peacekeeping appears centered in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
All other major defense matters are decided in the [LOC Palace.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Over the past decade , [LOC Morocco  ] has transitioned from a conscript to an all-volunteer military force of approximately 218,000 soldiers . 
Of the three services , the [ORG Army  ] is dominant with approximately 175,000 personnel . 
There are approximately 13,000 personnel in the [ORG Air Force  ] and 7,800 in the [ORG Navy  ] . 
Though nominally subordinate within the military structure but answering directly to the King , the [ORG Gendarmerie  ] , which consists of approximately 22,000 personnel , conducts paramilitary , royal guard , and internal and border policing missions . 
Though a few legacy conscripts remain in the military , professional reforms have made voluntary military service an attractive career option for [MISC Moroccans  ] with opportunities for a steady income and some upward mobility . 
The average military salary for enlisted soldiers is approximately 2,000 dirhams ( USD 270 ) per month . 
An officer 's starting salary is approximately 6,000 dirhams ( USD 850 ) per month . 
With benefits , such as free housing , these are reasonably competitive in the [MISC Moroccan  ] context. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The top military commanders include Military Inspector General and [ORG Army  ] Commander , Lieutenant General ( Lt Gen ) [PER Abdelaziz Benanni  ] ; Operations Chief Lt Gen [PER Boughaid Arroub  ] ; and [ORG Gendarmerie  ] Commander Lt Gen [PER Housni Benslimane  ] . 
[PER Benanni  ] , who has become mired in suspicion of corruption , will reportedly be retired soon . 
[PER Arroub  ] , who came out of recent retirement , is tipped by some to succeed [PER Benanni  ] . 
[PER Arroub  ] , historically pro-French , appears to have become increasingly pro-U.S. in the last 5 years . 
Another rising star in the [ORG FAR  ] is General [PER Mohamed Larbi Tamdi  ] , who is responsible for army logistics and force sustainment . 
There is some military staff in the Palace , likely influent , about which little is known. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) King [PER Hassan II  ] and his son , King [PER Mohammed VI  ] , have maintained the [ORG Gendarmerie  ] as a force relatively independent from the [ORG FAR  ] since 1972 , in part as a check against a military coup . 
While it most visibly serves as a [ORG State Police/Highway Patrol  ] , it has a wide range of units . 
Its commander , Lt Gen [PER Benslimane  ] , likely reports in some way directly to the King . 
He also leads the [ORG Moroccan National Soccer League  ] , making him a popular figure inside and out of military circles . 
While there is no direct proof of [PER Benslimane  ] being involved in corrupt activity , low ranking [ORG Gendarmerie  ] assigned to highway patrols are expected to pay approximately 4,000 dirhams ( USD 540 ) to their immediate supervisors with extralegal earnings from motorists above which they can keep for themselves , according to one credible anecdote. --------------------------------------------- -- Military Operations Dominated by [LOC Western Sahara  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG FAR  ] is composed of over 200,000 soldiers and outclasses most militaries in [LOC Africa  ] but has significant room for improvement . 
Along with concerns regarding aging equipment and an overtaxed force , the [ORG FAR  ] is plagued by institutional corruption , leadership that will not step aside , and low morale among mid-level officers . 
The [ORG FAR  ] is preoccupied with operations in the [LOC Western Sahara  ] region with between 50 and 70 percent of its total strength deployed there at any one time . 
The force in [LOC Western Sahara  ] -- a landmass roughly two thirds the size of [LOC California  ] -- is considered to be stretched thin with a reported estimated operational readiness rate of just 40 percent . 
[LOC Morocco  ] does not consider the [ORG POLISARIO  ] -- the ethnically [MISC Sahrawi  ] resistance based in [LOC Tindouf  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , seeking to make the [LOC Western Sahara  ] an independent state -- to be a conventional military threat . 
However , the [ORG FAR  ] remains vigilant in guarding against a renewed [ORG POLISARIO  ] insurgency effort . 
[LOC Morocco  ] built a berm or sand wall along the eastern and southern borders of the [LOC Sahara  ] in the 1980s , which effectively eliminated the [ORG POLISARIO  ] 's ability to launch hit and run raids , leading to the 1981 cease-fire , which has been fully respected . 
The [ORG POLISARIO  ] continues to maintain a small , lightly armed presence at a few desert crossroads in the small remaining part of [LOC Western Sahara  ] outside the berm . 
Despite occasional expressions of concern , the [ORG GOM  ] almost certainly is fully conscious that the [ORG POLISARIO  ] poses no current threat that could not be effectively countered . 
The [ORG POLISARIO  ] has generally refrained from classic terrorist bombings , etc . 
Although the specter is sometimes raised , there is no indication of any [PER Salafist/Al Qaeda  ] activity among the indigenous [MISC Sahrawi  ] population. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While the border between [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] is closed , and relations remain cool , we do not believe that [LOC Algeria  ] poses an imminent conventional military threat to [LOC Morocco  ] . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG FAR  ] has contingency plans and " wargames " in training exercises for a possible [MISC Algerian  ] attack , but the [ORG FAR  ] does not have troops deployed along the border . 
Instead , the [ORG FAR  ] remains stationed in garrisons , hundreds of kilometers away from the border , from which they could deploy in the unlikely event of an [MISC Algerian  ] incursion into [LOC Morocco  ] . 
Any confrontation between the two countries would likely take place through the proxy of the [ORG POLISARIO  ] , which [LOC Algeria  ] has supported materially in the past and could do so again if hostilities between [LOC Morocco  ] and the [ORG POLISARIO  ] recommenced. ------------ Peacekeeping ------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Motivated to win over other countries to its claims to [LOC Western Sahara  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] is active in [ORG United Nations  ] ( [ORG UN  ] ) , engages in peacekeeping activities , and occasionally sends troops to assist friendly countries . 
[LOC Morocco  ] is an experienced contributor to [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping efforts , deploying to countries like [LOC Angola  ] , [LOC Bosnia  ] , [LOC Cambodia  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] and [LOC Somalia  ] . 
It currently has over 1,500 peacekeepers deployed to [PER Cote  ] d , Ivoire and the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of the [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) . 
[LOC Morocco  ] also supports a military hospital in [LOC Kosovo  ] under [ORG NATO  ] command . 
[LOC Morocco  ] has sent medical personnel to [LOC Niger  ] to assist with famine relief and recently re-deployed military forces to [LOC Senegal  ] for an annual five-month &cloud seeding8 operation for drought relief . 
Peacekeeping contributions in recent years have been tarnished by allegations of sexual wrongdoing in the [ORG DRC  ] and [PER Cote  ] d , [LOC Ivoire.  ] --------------------------------------------- --- Corruption Remains the [ORG Single Greatest Challenge  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Corruption is prevalent at all levels of [MISC Moroccan  ] society and the military is also plagued by it , particularly at the highest levels . 
This may partly reflect a grand bargain struck by King [PER Hassan II  ] following at least two nearly successful coups in the 1970 's : remain loyal , and you can profit . 
( Those whose loyalty was in question were subject to sometimes decades of harsh imprisonment . 
) Credible reports indicate that Lt Gen [PER Benanni  ] is using his position as the Commander of the [ORG Southern Sector  ] to skim money from military contracts and influence business decisions . 
A widely believed rumor has it that he owns large parts of the fisheries in [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
[PER Benanni  ] , like many senior military officers , has a lavish family home that was likely built with money gleaned from bribes . 
Leadership positions in regional sectors are a significant source of extralegal income for military leaders . 
There are even reports of students at [LOC Morocco  ] 's military academy paying money to increase their class standings in order to obtain positions in lucrative military postings . 
Command in the southern sector , i.e. , [LOC Western Sahara  ] , given the predominance of military activity there , is considered to be the most lucrative of the sectors in this regard . 
Because command in the southern sector is also considered critical to high level advancement in the [ORG FAR  ] , positions there are highly sought after . 
Consequently , positions in this sector are often jealously " guarded " by a number of influential families in the military . 
The [ORG GOM  ] seems to be looking for ways to stop corruption , especially among the formative military ranks of Colonel and below , but not much is being done to stop the corruption in the general officer ranks. ------------------------------------------- Retiring High Level Officers Also a Problem ------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Senior officers refusing to retire to allow younger officers to move up the ranks has become a significant problem for the [ORG FAR  ] . 
Officers nearing the mandatory retirement age do not want to retire since this would mean relinquishing bribes , money-skimming , and some related sources of income . 
Even for those officers not &on the take , 8 giving up government positions and paychecks is economically difficult for a sustained retirement . 
This " gerontocracy " problem , coupled with the King 's notorious micro-management of the military has had a negative impact on the morale of mid-level military leaders. --------------------------------------------- ------ [ORG Radicalization: Under Control But Lingering Menace  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Though now viewed as a minor problem , reporting suggests that small numbers of [ORG FAR  ] soldiers remains susceptible to [MISC Islamic  ] radicalization . 
The [ORG GOM  ] first encountered this problem following the 2003 [LOC Casablanca  ] bombings when investigators identified military members as co-conspirators . 
Following the bombings , the [ORG FAR  ] undertook steps to identify extremists and implement preventative measures , such as closing prayer halls on military bases , to address the problem . 
Subsequently , [LOC Morocco  ] , s internal security services have identified and apprehended several military and gendarmerie personnel in other terrorist cells , some of whom had stolen weapons from their bases for terrorism . 
Acknowledging this threat in a speech to the armed forces in May 2008 , the King stated his desire to " immunize " the armed forces from the threat of radicalization and to promote the values of tolerance and moderation in the ranks . 
During this same time frame the military forced 30 officers to retire early , allegedly because they were deemed potentially radical and hostile to the Government . 
Subsequently , the [ORG FAR  ] removed all mosques from army bases and deployed military counterintelligence , i.e. , 5th [MISC Bureau  ] , undercover officers to monitor local " off-post " mosques for potentially radical activities . 
These officers refer cases to the [ORG Gendarmerie  ] if criminal charges can be pursued. --------------- Winds of Change --------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Since the 1970 's the military itself has been perceived as the greatest threat to the throne and internal security in [LOC Morocco  ] , not surprising given [LOC Morocco  ] 's own history and the broader context of the coup-ridden [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
Of late , however , there is a general perception that the relationship between the [ORG Palace  ] and the [ORG FAR  ] is beginning to change to one of greater trust . 
The King 's growing confidence is partly signaled by a recent significant increase in military spending , particularly for modern hardware , although this is primarily a function of the [ORG GOM  ] 's perceived threat from [LOC Algeria  ] and the fact that it is cost prohibitive at a certain point to maintain older military equipment . 
The [ORG GOM  ] increased the military 's operating budget to more than [MISC USD  ] 2 billion in 2007 , significantly more than in previous years . 
Likewise , the [ORG FAR  ] is undergoing a significant modernization process , paying over [MISC USD  ] 2 billion for 24 [MISC F-16  ] aircraft and over [MISC USD  ] 300 million for [MISC T-6  ] training aircraft from the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG GOM  ] has commercially financed these transactions , thus far , but the upfront payments have come from the treasury , which has also committed to cover monthly payments . 
The King recently allowed armed military flights north of [PER Ben Guerir  ] ( located approximately 200 kilometers south of [LOC Rabat  ] ) , an act not permitted in the past due to the King , s desire to keep the military far away from the [ORG Palace  ] in [LOC Rabat  ] . 
The [ORG GOM  ] is also looking to make significant purchases of M-1 [MISC Abrams  ] battle tanks in the future. -------------------------------- [ORG U.S.-Moroccan Military Relations Strong  ] but Could Be Better -------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In general , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] share a robust military relationship with prospects for even closer ties in the future . 
The health of the relationship is evidenced by increased [MISC U.S.-Moroccan  ] military training exercises and the aforementioned military sales . 
[LOC Morocco  ] has also increased its activities under a partnership arrangement with the [ORG Utah National Guard  ] , which regularly deploys to [LOC Morocco  ] to conduct joint training and humanitarian relief operations . 
We have submitted draft proposed language for the [MISC Moroccans  ] to consider for an Acquisition and [ORG Cross Servicing Agreement  ] ( [ORG ACSA  ] ) and a [ORG Status of Forces Agreement  ] ( [ORG SOFA  ] ) , and have received comments on the [ORG ACSA  ] draft from the [ORG GOM  ] . 
In the future , the [ORG Embassy  ] hopes to see improvements in the [ORG FAR  ] 's information sharing and accessibility to military units and facilities with our [ORG Defense Attache Office  ] . 
Although the [ORG FAR  ] regularly dialogues with our attaches , quality information is lacking . 
The [ORG FAR  ] also does not recognize the [ORG Embassy Attache  ] circle , an organization of Military Attaches from various countries residing in [LOC Morocco  ] who elect a president to discuss issues of collective concern with the [ORG FAR  ] . 
It is apparent that the [ORG Palace  ] continues to tightly control the [ORG FAR  ] 's interactions [LOC U.S.  ] and other foreign governments. --------------------------- [ORG AFRICOM  ] Viewed with Caution --------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Previous interactions with [ORG GOM  ] officials indicate that military leaders are opposed to [ORG AFRICOM  ] basing a headquarters element in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
However , [LOC Morocco  ] has offered to send a military liaison officer to the [ORG AFRICOM  ] headquarters in [LOC Germany  ] and has offered to assist [MISC U.S.-led  ] efforts engaging with [MISC African  ] countries . 
[LOC Morocco  ] has also approached [ORG AFRICOM  ] representatives to solicit [ORG AFRICOM  ] support in providing chemicals needed for their cloud-seeding operations in [LOC Senegal  ] and providing logistics to assist with a proposed locust control program. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The Mission is optimistic that the [MISC U.S.-Moroccan  ] military relationship will continue to improve , but there are potential speed bumps in future . 
We anticipate that cooperative joint training exercises will continue to occur at a robust pace , although the vast majority of this activity will likely take place in [LOC Morocco  ] because of continued restrictions on the travel of [ORG FAR  ] personnel . 
While we anticipate that the [ORG Palace  ] will continue to modernize the military , with the notable possible acquisition of M-1 [MISC Abrams  ] tanks , we are increasingly concerned that [LOC Morocco  ] , not used to the high operating costs of these high end items ( and other budgetary pressures ) may make it increasingly difficult for the [MISC Moroccans  ] to make payments on purchases . 
If payments become a problem for the [ORG GOM  ] , this could sour relations temporarily . 
While we believe that there are some signs of the King 's increased confidence in the [ORG FAR  ] , we believe that the monarchy still calculates that the military represents the biggest potential threat to the crown . 
[ORG FAR  ] officers will , therefore , continue to be distanced from policy making input and restricted from engaging in detailed discussions about [MISC Moroccan  ] military strength and intentions with foreign military officers , including our attaches. ***************************************** Visit Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] 's Classified Website ; http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/rabat ***************************************** Riley</pre></code>
