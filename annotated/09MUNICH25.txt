[LOC REFS: A  ] ) [LOC BERLIN  ] 169 B ) 08 MUNICH 355 and previous ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] ( 37 ) is [LOC Germany  ] 's new and youngest-ever Economics Minister , assuming a portfolio for which he is not wholly suited academically ( REF A ) but which he could master using his proven personal and political skills . 
If he is successful , he could become the poster child for renewal of [PER Horst Seehofer  ] 's [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) , now struggling to convince voters that it is modern and savvy enough to succeed and not the hide-bound regional redoubt of conservatism that lost big in [LOC Bavaria  ] last fall ( REF B ) . 
( Biographical data at paragraph 8 . 
) End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Supporters and detractors focus on the same qualities in the precocious zu [PER Guttenberg:  ] his youth , charisma , foreign policy experience , and upward momentum . 
Supporters say he will be effective because he understands modern challenges , is well known on both sides of the [LOC Atlantic  ] , and is effective . 
Detractors say he has too little experience in general and that his foreign policy expertise is wrong for the [ORG Economics Ministry  ] during an economic crisis. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Zu [PER Guttenberg  ] has a proven record of beating the expectations of politicians and the public . 
He unexpectedly contested and won the [MISC Chairmanship of  ] the [ORG CSU  ] in [LOC Upper Franconia  ] , a region of [LOC Bavaria  ] , in 2007 . 
After becoming party general secretary just three months ago , he used warmth , charisma and direct engagement to win over party members in the provinces who were skeptical of his allegedly cool and aristocratic bearing ( see bio notes below at paragraph 8 ) . ------------------------------------------ Politicians Curious ; [ORG Private Sector Upbeat  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Zu [PER Guttenberg  ] could add some gloss to the cabinet by concentrating in a high-profile way on the business side of the economy , leaving high finance to [PER Peer Steinbrueck  ] ( [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] , [ORG SPD  ] ) . 
This might be a good strategy . 
Senior contacts at the [MISC Bavarian  ] [ORG Economics Ministry  ] told the Consulate political specialist that " they are enthusiastic about zu [PER Guttenberg  ] . 
" Although he would not really have time to master the difficult ministry within the six months he has before the Federal [ORG Bundestag  ] election , they believed zu [PER Guttenberg  ] was " smart , with a quick mind , and that he would definitely make himself far more visible than [PER Glos  ] ever did . 
" Embassy contacts in [LOC Berlin  ] have echoed these sentiments and think zu [PER Guttenberg  ] is well-suited to capitalize on opportunities with the new [ORG US Administration  ] . 
He seems to get on well with Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] . 
Moreover , business representatives and the private sector have given the new man an early round of applause . 
For example , [ORG Employers' Association  ] President [PER Dieter Hundt  ] said zu [PER Guttenberg  ] 's international experience , political clout , and contacts would all help him promote the interests of employers . 
Representatives from Industry and [ORG Chambers of Commerce  ] expressed the expectation that zu [PER Guttenberg  ] would support medium-sized business and strengthen transatlantic economic ties , based on his own experience in his family 's enterprises . 
Zu [PER Guttenberg  ] 's tasks are manifold: Implementation of the savings package worth 100 billion Euros ; negotiate with companies that have asked for state money , such as Continental and car manufacturer Opel ; find a solution for [ORG Hypo Real Estate  ] bank ; and tackle a wealth of questions with regard to energy and ecology . 
Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] will want zu [PER Guttenberg  ] to strike a balance between being seen as a hands-on minister and preventing the election campaign from being fought over the financial crisis , something that could weaken Government prospects. ---------------------------------------- THE NEW [ORG CSU  ] - MORE ATTRACTIVE TO VOTERS ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With this appointment , [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President [PER Horst Seehofer  ] , also [ORG CSU  ] , extended his radical rejuvenation strategy of the party to the federal level . 
[PER Michael Glos  ] was the last senior [ORG CSU  ] politician from the preceding [PER Edmund Stoiber  ] generation . 
" zu [PER Guttenberg  ] is young , very young - but that is exactly what I want in the process of renewal , " said [PER Seehofer  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] faces potentially existential challenges in the races for the [MISC German  ] Federal and [ORG European Parliaments  ] and [PER Seehofer  ] obviously believes that only fresh faces can lead the party into a brighter future . 
After taking office as [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President last fall , [PER Seehofer  ] replaced all members of the cabinet over 60 years of age with considerably MUNICH 00000025 002 OF 002 younger people , including more women . 
[PER Seehofer  ] 's departure as Federal Agriculture Minister enabled him to install 44-year old [PER Ilse Aigner  ] as his successor . 
With zu [PER Guttenberg  ] gone to [LOC Berlin  ] , [PER Seehofer  ] has appointed two from the younger [ORG CSU  ] generation to replace him - [PER Alexander Dobrindt  ] , a relative unknown 38-year-old [ORG Bundestag  ] deputy , and [PER Dorothee Baer  ] , the 30-year-old who was just recently promoted to foreign policy spokesperson of the [ORG CSU Bundestag  ] caucus . 
[PER Seehofer  ] knows that the June 7 [ORG European Parliament  ] elections and the September 27 national elections are the tests to see whether [MISC Bavarians  ] go along with his new [MISC CSU.  ] ------- Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG SPD  ] may hope to profit from the replacement of [PER Michael Glos  ] with the relatively inexperienced zu [PER Guttenberg  ] ; this may prove difficult . 
[PER Glos  ] was from the start considered one of [PER Merkel  ] 's weakest ministers , and his departure removes a favorite target of his political opponents . 
It will be far more difficult to score points by attacking his successor , who is a skilled debater . 
In the middle of a serious economic and financial crisis , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] 's challenge will be to convince the electorate in [LOC Germany  ] that the [MISC CDU/CSU  ] remains the party best able to cope with economic challenges . 
It may not hurt that the new [ORG CSU  ] Secretary General , [PER Alexander Dobrindt  ] , has previously served as economic spokesman of the [ORG CSU  ] caucus . 
The economy will no doubt be the overriding issue in the unfolding election campaign. --------------------------------------------- ---------- Biographical Data: [LOC Germany  ] 's Youngest Minister , a [MISC Baron  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
