( C ) SUMMARY . 
Accompanied by the Charge d’Affaires , [MISC Senators  ] [PER John McCain  ] , [PER Joseph Lieberman  ] and [PER Lindsey Graham  ] dined with President [PER Karzai  ] at the [ORG Presidential Palace December  ] 6 . 
Flanked by many from his cabinet , including the Foreign and [ORG Defense Ministers  ] , [PER Karzai  ] urged the [MISC Senators  ] to secure strong [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Pakistan  ] President [PER Zardari  ] in his efforts to free [LOC Pakistan  ] from extremism , noted the progress [LOC Afghanistan  ] has made with the support of international assistance , welcomed incoming [LOC U.S.  ] forces and described efforts to combat widespread corruption . 
He also stressed the toll that civilian casualties took on public support for military operations . 
APPRECIATION FOR [LOC U.S.  ] ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] thanked the [MISC Senators  ] for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance and shared his optimism regarding the future of the bilateral relationship: “Never before has a country welcomed a foreign presence so much . 
( Our cooperation ) will be a great success.” [PER Karzai  ] then joked that “reconstruction is something we complain about , but inside we are very happy with it . 
We complain because we want more money from you.” [PER Karzai  ] went on to describe how small businesses have sprung up all around the country in the last four years as a result of international assistance , and how those businesses are vital to Afghanistan’s sustainability . 
[PER Karzai  ] also touched on other areas of progress , claiming that this year [LOC Afghanistan  ] would see 50,000 students graduate from college whereas a few years ago , there were not 50,000 college graduates in the country . 
[MISC PAKISTAN’S  ] ZARDARI: A GOOD MAN TRYING TO FREE HIS COUNTRY OF EXTREMISTS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Responding to Senator McCain’s comment that the delegation had just arrived from meetings in [LOC Islamabad  ] , [PER Karzai  ] stressed the importance of [LOC U.S.  ] support for [MISC Pakistan’s  ] president , calling [PER Zardari  ] “a good man who wants to free his country from extremists.” [PER Karzai  ] noted that he had an excellent relationship with [PER Zardari  ] and felt the two had a special rapport , adding “never in 60 years of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] history have we had such good bilateral relations.” [PER Karzai  ] described how , when he arrived in [LOC Istanbul  ] for trilateral talks earlier this month , [PER Zardari  ] called him directly and asked to meet with him privately before their official meeting the following day . 
[PER Zardari  ] came to [MISC Karzai’s  ] room where they chatted over dinner for hours , “covering all topics imaginable.” Returning to the issue of [LOC U.S.  ] support for [PER Zardari  ] , [PER Karzai  ] said the [MISC Pakistani  ] President felt “lonely , threatened and under siege.” [PER Zardari  ] believed he received too little support from the international community: [LOC India  ] was still wary because of historic enmity between the two countries ; [LOC Russia  ] withheld its support because [LOC Pakistan  ] had helped the [MISC Afghans  ] defeat the [MISC Soviets  ] ; [LOC China  ] disapproved of [MISC Zardari’s  ] close relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; and the [MISC Arab  ] countries wouldn’t support him because he wasn’t “one of them.” [PER Karzai  ] urged the [ORG Senators:  ] “America is the only place he can turn - help him . 
Give him all you can ; forget his past.” NEED TO FOCUS ON COMMUNITIES AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Calling himself “a traditional [MISC Afghan  ] , ” [PER Karzai  ] said his government won the previous election because of the backing of the tribes , but lack of progress and growing insecurity at the local level had left many communities disillusioned and vulnerable to militants . 
The government needed to re-establish those ties and focus on strengthening local infrastructure . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he had raised this issue with Senator [PER Biden  ] when [PER Biden  ] suggested sending more troops and more civilians to support Afghanistan’s reconstruction and security efforts . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed those elements were important , but told [PER Biden  ] that even more important was shifting the assistance focus to the community or village level and concentrating on capacity-building to bolster the traditional element of [MISC Afghan  ] society. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] acknowledged the scope of corruption that plagues the country , saying “the more we dig ( into corruption ) , the more scared we get.” The President told the [MISC Senators  ] he had fired Governor [PER Raufi  ] of [LOC Kandahar  ] after a three-month investigation ( the same amount of time Governor [PER Raufi  ] was in the position following the dismissal of the [LOC KABUL  ] 00003237 002 OF 002 previous governor ) . 
He also noted his recent firing of the Minister of Transport for embezzling funds linked to construction of Kabul’s new airport . 
Responding to the question of whether either of these men would be prosecuted , [PER Karzai  ] confirmed prosecutors were pursuing a case against the Minister of Transport . 
[PER Karzai  ] also tied the prevalence of widespread , but low-level corruption to the despair of many impoverished [MISC Afghans:  ] “When someone doesn’t have hope for the future , he will steal.” On the other hand , [PER Karzai  ] related a story from a trip to [LOC Paktya  ] when residents challenged him on his “negative” radio addresses: “Things are better than you say , don’t you know that ? ” [PER Karzai  ] told them he recognized the improvements but just wanted everyone to do still better . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] WELCOMES INCOMING [LOC U.S.  ] FORCES <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Karzai  ] welcomed the incoming [LOC U.S.  ] brigades , but took the opportunity to question the effectiveness of the [MISC British  ] in [LOC Helmand.  ] “Freeing [LOC Helmand  ] from the [ORG Taliban  ] is important: [LOC Helmand  ] is not with us.” He then semi-seriously suggested that everyone stop taking notes , “especially my people , ” and related an anecdote in which a woman from [LOC Helmand  ] asked him to “take the [MISC British  ] away and give us back the [MISC Americans.”  ] He said there was a broad understanding among [MISC Afghans  ] of the value of [MISC American  ] forces , and that he regularly hears requests from the [LOC South  ] to increase [LOC U.S.  ] troop presence there. “Afghans don’t recognize [ORG NATO  ] , they recognize [LOC America  ] , ” said [PER Karzai  ] . 
He offered the example of a villager from [LOC Uruzgan  ] who gave the [ORG Dutch Task Force  ] Commander a present , saying , “Take that back to [LOC Washington  ] with you.” KARZAI: [MISC AFGHANS  ] WILLING TO DIE IN BATTLE BUT DO NOT UNDERSTAND CIVILIAN CASUALTIES <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] raised the issue of civilian casualties , stressing the impact these deaths had on public opinion and support. “Freeing [LOC Afghanistan  ] from terrorists is important and building institutions is important , but even more important is making sure [MISC Afghan  ] civilians don’t suffer in the pursuit of these terrorists.” He emphasized that these incidents were “pushing our population away from us.” The [MISC Afghan  ] people will be your best allies , he asserted , but we have to find a way to solve this. “Afghans will die on the field of battle a thousand times ( fighting militants ) , but civilian casualties they do not understand.” ELECTIONS: [PER KARZAI  ] PRAISES SENATOR McCAIN’S GRACIOUSNESS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] praised Senator [PER McCain  ] for what he called “a marvelous concession speech” and noted that he had called Senator [PER McCain  ] immediately afterward to congratulate him on the speech . 
[PER Karzai  ] added , “I hope that if ( Afghanistan’s ) election results go a different way next year , I will have 20 percent of the guts you showed and be able to concede as graciously as you did.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) CODEL [PER McCain  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this message .
