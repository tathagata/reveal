E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 10/19/2026 TAGS: <a href='/tag/MOPS_0.html'>MOPS</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/PO_0.html'>PO</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR FM AMADO'S OCT 24 MEETING WITH SECRETARY RICE SIPDIS Classified By: Acting Pol/Econ Counselor [PER Cari Enav  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) Summary ----------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S/NF ) Foreign Minister [PER Luis Amado  ] 's visit with you is part of [LOC Portugal  ] 's effort to raise its profile in the international arena , particularly in the run-up to its [ORG EU  ] Presidency which it will assume in the latter half of 2007 . 
Although Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] focused primarily on domestic issues during his first year in office , the government has made international engagement a priority since [PER Amado  ] assumed his current position as Foreign Minister in July 2006 . 
Minister [PER Amado  ] will want to discuss [LOC Portugal  ] 's agenda for its [ORG EU  ] Presidency ( emphasis on the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Africa  ] ) , the [MISC US-EU Transatlantic Relationship  ] and the role [LOC Portugal  ] plays in it . 
He will expect you to raise our request to use [LOC Lajes AirBase  ] in the [LOC Azores  ] to repatriate Guantanamo detainees . 
The Minister --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The superb personal relationship I enjoyed with [PER Amado  ] when he was Defense Minister continues in his current capacity as Foreign Minister . 
I have found him to be even-tempered ( unlike his unpredictable predecessor [PER Diogo Freitas  ] do [ORG Amaral  ] ) , thoughtful and low-key . 
He is pro-US , committed to a strong [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG Transatlantic  ] relationship and seeks to coordinate policy with the [LOC US  ] . 
He places great importance on presenting a united public front , whether it be within the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG NATO  ] or with the [LOC US  ] . 
If there are differences , he prefers to discuss them discreetly behind closed doors . 
Minister [PER Amado  ] last visited the [LOC U.S.  ] in his official capacity of Minister of Defense in November 2005 when he had a personal meeting with Defense Secretary Rumsfield . 
He is still smarting from being stood up by the [ORG NSC  ] - [ORG Crouch  ] during last year 's visit . 
It would be to our benefit to stroke him a lot . 
[LOC Portugal  ] - Steadfast Ally ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] , a founding member of [ORG NATO  ] , is a steadfast ally who has consistently stood by our side over the years despite various changes in government . 
[LOC Portugal  ] was an early supporter of [LOC US  ] operations in [LOC Iraq  ] , hosting the [ORG Azores Summit  ] just before the war . 
It has provided virtually free access to [MISC Portuguese  ] air and seaports for flights supporting military operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , with over three thousand flight a year transiting [LOC Lajes Air Base  ] in the [LOC Azores  ] . 
Despite severe budgetary constraints , it is engaged internationally on numerous fronts with military personnel in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( where it lost one soldier ) , [LOC East Timor  ] , the [LOC Congo  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Bosnia  ] and soon [LOC Lebanon  ] , and it is member of both the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] and the [ORG Security Container Initiative  ] . 
[ORG New Approach  ] to [LOC International Engagement  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Amado  ] and other government officials have underscored to me [LOC Portugal  ] 's desire to influence - not just follow - international policy . 
He has stated publicly on several occasions the need for [LOC Portugal  ] to be engaged globally , not just for the sake of its alliances , but for the country 's own safety and security . 
He first relayed this message late last year when he traveled to [LOC Afghanistan  ] as Minister of Defense following the loss of a [MISC Portuguese  ] soldier there and has since reaffirmed [LOC Portugal  ] , s commitment to the war against terrorism on several occasions . 
He has taken a pro-active role in the [LOC Middle East  ] , particularly during the most recent conflict in [LOC Lebanon  ] where he was in the forefront of [ORG EU  ] leaders calling for a variety of initiatives to deal with the crisis . 
He also hopes to host engage more broadly on [MISC African  ] issues . 
The [MISC Transatlantic Relationship  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Amado  ] is a strong advocate of the [MISC Transatlantic  ] relationship . 
He is looking to fortify engagement between the [LOC US  ] and [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC Portugal  ] and implement his own brand of " transformational diplomacy " by working with the [LOC US  ] in hot spots around the world . 
He will want to discuss [ORG NATO  ] , peacekeeping efforts , and the transformation of the alliance in preparation for the [ORG Riga Summit  ] later this year . 
He will likely reaffirm [LOC Portugal  ] 's commitment to the fight against terrorism and express disappointment that the [LOC U.S.  ] has decided to support [LOC Bucharest  ] to host the 2008 [ORG Summit  ] instead of [LOC Lisbon  ] . 
On the other hand , he will welcome the recently announced intent to upgrade the [ORG NATO Command  ] at [LOC Lisbon  ] into a [ORG Full Command  ] with responsibility in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[ORG EU  ] Presidency ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Amado  ] has told me that [LOC Portugal  ] 's main foreign policy objectives during its [ORG EU  ] Presidency will focus on the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Amado  ] has already traveled extensively to the [LOC Middle East  ] where he believes [LOC Portugal  ] 's relationship with the [LOC Maghreb  ] states and its position as an honest broker can help move the peace process forward . 
[PER Amado  ] was one of the first to call for a special session of [ORG EU  ] Foreign Ministers at the onset of the summer hostilities in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and [LOC Portugal  ] is sending a contingent of Army engineers to there later this year to help with reconstruction . 
Although I have underscored the [LOC US  ] position on engagement with [LOC Syria  ] on numerous occasions , [PER Amado  ] believes dialogue with [LOC Damascus  ] is necessary to resolve the regional conflicts and to isolate [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Amado  ] further told me that he sees [LOC Iran  ] as the greatest threat since WWII , and his diplomatic advisor confirmed that [PER Amado  ] is pressing for sanctions in light of the failed efforts to halt nuclear enrichment. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] has a special relationship with [LOC Africa  ] , particularly with its former colonies . 
It would like to host an [ORG EU-Africa Summit  ] and is looking at creative solutions to work around the [LOC Zimbabwe  ] question . 
[PER Amado  ] , s diplomatic advisor commented that perhaps locating the summit in [LOC Africa  ] rather than in [LOC Europe  ] might resolve the thorny issue . 
Strategic policy issues would include [LOC Darfur  ] , energy issues , the fight against poverty and illegal immigration. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This might be a good opportunity to underscore the need to show progress in US-Portugal cooperation to bring security and stability in [LOC Africa  ] . 
At the [MISC Rumsfeld-Amado  ] meeting a year ago , the two sides agreed to focus on working together on security issues in [LOC Africa  ] . 
A variety of [LOC US  ] proposals have been explored such as joint training of peacekeepers in [LOC Mozambique  ] and [LOC Angola  ] , joint training of deminers in [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] , and cooperation in [ORG HIV Prevention  ] among [MISC African Armed Forces  ] . 
Unfortunately , we have achieved no forward movement , and we would welcome any specific proposals from the [MISC Portuguese  ] side . 
[ORG CIA Flight Inquiry Complicates Gitmo Repatriation Request  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Amado  ] has told me that he would like to assist us in our efforts to repatriate [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees through [LOC Lajes AirBase  ] . 
However , given intense [ORG CIA Rendition  ] scrutiny and his own party 's left wing opposition to his pro-US slant , [PER Amado  ] underscored the need to be on firm legal ground before consenting to do so . 
Subsequent conversations with MFA staff indicate that [PER Amado  ] is awaiting the [LOC US  ] to address his concerns before responding to our request. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I would like to underscore the delicate balancing act [PER Amado  ] is confronting in minimizing damage to his government - however unwarranted - due to previous [ORG CIA Rendition  ] investigations while trying to convince it to grant our request for access to [LOC Lajes AirBase  ] . 
Unrelenting media and political attacks which have been ongoing for months resulted in an atypical outburst before [LOC Portugal  ] 's Parliament earlier this week . 
[PER Amado  ] publicly offered to resign if anyone could prove the government was complicit in an illegal act related to [ORG CIA  ] flights on [MISC Portuguese  ] territory . 
It would be of great assistance if you could personally express appreciation for [PER Amado  ] 's steadfastness in supporting the [LOC US  ] position on this issue and his continued contribution of troops to global operations . 
Comment ------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) I believe you will find the Minister intelligent , deliberate , and engaging . 
He will likely raise the possibility of Prime Minister [PER Jose Socrates  ] meeting with President [PER Bush  ] in [LOC Washington  ] before [LOC Portugal  ] assumes the [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
I urge you to support this request , and as early as possible , particularly in view of the fact that it was made almost two years ago and that [LOC Portugal  ] is now working on the joint [ORG EU  ] agenda with [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Slovenia  ] . 
[PER Amado  ] will also be exploring opportunities to invite high level USG officials , including yourself , to [LOC Portugal  ] during its [ORG EU  ] Presidency and might try to revitalize a [ORG BMENA Conference  ] which did not receive an enthusiastic [ORG State Department  ] response .
