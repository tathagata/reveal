IIR  ] 6 809 0120 09 [ORG C.  ] 08 [ORG BRASILIA  ] 1214 Classified By: DCM [PER Lisa Kubiske  ] . 
Reason 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ref B describes a March 12 incident in which a small private aircraft was stolen at gunpoint in [LOC Luziania  ] ( approximately 23 miles from [LOC Brasilia  ] ) and after two hours was intentionally crashed into a parking lot of a shopping mall in [LOC Goiania  ] , approximately 90 miles from [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
The incident was notable in that it provoked a rare activation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's shootdown procedures ( described in ref a ) . 
Given the plane 's proximity to the federal capital and lack of any flight plan , [ORG Brasilia Air Traffic Control  ] notified [ORG Air Defense Control  ] , which scrambled planes from [ORG Anapolis Air Base  ] to intercept , observe and try to communicate ( details in ref b ) . 
When the plane suddenly steered for a densely populated area and a large shopping mall , controllers began to view it as a threat . 
With the possibility that the stolen plane could be used as a weapon , [ORG Air Defense Command  ] briefed [ORG Air Force Chief Brigadeiro  ] [PER Junito Saito  ] . 
[PER Saito  ] then contacted Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] and President [PER Lula  ] about the possibility of ordering a shootdown should there be a threat to civilians . 
During the discussion , the pilot went down in the mall parking lot. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] followed exactly the procedures provided to Embassy [LOC Brasilia  ] last year in going up the chain of command before authorizing a shootdown . 
Because of the seriousness of a potential threat to a large number of citizens in the mall , the [ORG Air Force  ] took the additional step of consulting with the President . 
While no decision was made before the plane crashed , the procedure followed illustrates the extreme caution with which a possible shootdown is approached , the broad understanding of the shootdown policy among air traffic controllers and the fact that the procedures are executed as written . 
Mission believes that the March 12 incident provides an illustration of the effectiveness of [LOC Brazil  ] 's procedures to prevent inadvertent shootdowns that were the basis of the recommendation for Presidential certification of [LOC Brazil  ] in ref c . 
The fact that the procedures were correctly followed on March 12 demonstrates that they remain well known to pilots , controllers and decision makers . 
Along with the absence of any indication that conditions have changed with regard to shootdowns , this incident provides a strong case for recertification later this year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COMMENT , [MISC CONTINUED: On  ] the other side of the coin , the deliberate approach to a shootdown decision highlighted a vulnerability to potential terrorist actions given that a decision would not have been made in time to stop the pilot had he been able to crash into his target or another building , including in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
In part , this vulnerability stems from [LOC Brazil  ] 's shootdown procedures having been developed to apply to drug smuggling aircraft in [LOC Brazil  ] 's vast northern areas , not to potential attacks on cities . 
Based on DAO discussion with the [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] and [ORG Air Traffic  ] control , the [MISC Brazilians  ] consider their shootdown procedures to be effective but may look at ways to accelerate decision making during a potential terrorist attack .
