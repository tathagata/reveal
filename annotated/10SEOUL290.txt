[PER Kim  ] agreed with [LOC Campbell’s  ] observation that it was important for the [MISC Korean  ] public to understand that any change that may be considered concerning [ORG OPCON  ] transfer timing , and the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Quadrennial Defense Review  ] , would not diminish America’s commitment to the [MISC ROK’s  ] security , and should not be so interpreted . 
[LOC China  ] Unlikely to [LOC Call New  ] 6PT Round ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG NSA  ] [PER Kim  ] agreed with [LOC Campbell’s  ] observation that the current turbulence in [MISC Sino-American  ] relations meant [LOC Beijing  ] would be hesitant to call a new round of the [ORG Six Party Talks  ] ( 6PT ) anytime soon . 
Referring to POTUS’ upcoming meeting with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , [PER Kim  ] said the [MISC Chinese  ] were “far too sensitive” about the [MISC Tibetan  ] spiritual leader’s meetings with foreign officials .

( C ) [ORG NSA  ] [PER Kim  ] asserted that [MISC North Korean  ] leader [PER Kim Jong-il  ] needed to visit [LOC China  ] soon in order to get more economic assistance . 
The [ORG PRC  ] was in the process of delivering a portion of the food aid promised during Premier Wen’s visit to the [ORG DPRK  ] last fall ; approximately 6,000 metric tons ( [LOC MT  ] ) of rice and 20,000 [LOC MT  ] of soybeans has been delivered , but the [ORG DPRK  ] needed a lot more . 
The situation inside [LOC North Korea  ] , he added , appeared increasingly unstable . 
The [ORG North’s  ] currency replacement had created strong resentment throughout [ORG DPRK  ] society , [PER Kim  ] said , adding that [ORG DPRK  ] Finance Chief [PER Pak Nam-gi  ] had apparently been sacked . 
[PER Kim  ] asserted there were credible reports of unrest in the [LOC North  ] ; according to [ORG ROK  ] intelligence sources , [ORG DPRK  ] police recently found a bomb on a passenger train en route from [LOC Pyongyang  ] to [LOC Beijing  ] . 
[MISC U.S.-Japan Relations  ] -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Kim  ] concurred with [LOC Campbell’s  ] assessment that the [ORG DPJ  ] was “completely different” from the [ORG LDP  ] and agreed it was important for the DJP to coordinate with [LOC Seoul  ] and [LOC Washington  ] as it made preliminary overtures to [LOC Pyongyang  ] . 
The [LOC North Koreans  ] , [PER Kim  ] said , were clearly using several different channels to “knock on the [MISC DPJ’s  ] door.” [PER Kim  ] acknowledged [LOC Campbell’s  ] point that it was important to reach out directly to key [ORG DPJ  ] officials like Foreign Minister [PER Okada  ] and Finance Minister [PER Naoto Kan  ] . 
[ORG FTA  ] Prospects ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) It was the [ORG ROK  ] government’s view , [PER Kim  ] said , that there might be a window of opportunity to pass [ORG KORUS  ] immediately after the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congressional  ] elections this fall . 
[PER Kim  ] added that the [ORG ROK Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] was working on a possible [ORG FTA  ] event for President [PER Lee  ] during his upcoming trip to the [LOC United States  ] for the nuclear summit . 
One idea , [PER Kim  ] explained , was to have President [PER Lee  ] visit a [MISC Korean  ] factory to help underscore to the [MISC American  ] public that the [ORG FTA  ] was about creating jobs in [LOC America  ] as well in [LOC Korea  ] . 
[PER Campbell  ] praised [ORG ROK  ] Ambassador [PER Han Duck-soo  ] for his public outreach on [ORG KORUS  ] and noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] business community needed to “stop being lazy” and help get [ORG KORUS  ] through [ORG Congress  ] .

[PER Campbell  ] acknowledged the powerful symbolism for both the [MISC Korean  ] and [MISC American  ] audience of such a visit during the 60th anniversary of the [MISC Korean  ] War , but cautioned that it would be extremely difficult to arrange during the nuclear summit . 
[ORG MIA  ] Remains Recovery in [LOC North Korea  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Campbell  ] asked for [ORG ROK  ] understanding about the [LOC U.S.  ] position on resuming [ORG MIA  ] remains recovery operations in [LOC North Korea  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] felt strongly , [PER Campbell  ] explained , that this was an important humanitarian issue . 
[PER Campbell  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] would coordinate closely with the [ORG ROK  ] on the issue to “avoid sending the wrong signal” to the [ORG DPRK  ] . 
Pressed by [PER Kim  ] about paying the [LOC North Koreans  ] cash to help recover [LOC U.S.  ] remains , [PER Campbell  ] agreed it was distasteful ; he noted , however , that the [LOC United States  ] had made similar payments to the [MISC Burmese  ] and [MISC Vietnamese  ] governments to facilitate cooperation on [ORG MIA  ] issues . 
Prospects for a [MISC North-South  ] Summit ---------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On prospects for a [MISC North-South  ] summit , [ORG NSA  ] [PER Kim  ] clarified remarks that President [PER Lee  ] made in an interview with the [ORG BBC  ] in [LOC Davos  ] . 
[PER Kim  ] said that , beginning last fall , the [ORG ROK  ] has had contact with the [ORG DPRK  ] about a summit . 
The [LOC North  ] , however , has demanded that [LOC Seoul  ] provide a certain amount of economic aid prior to any summit . 
That precondition was unacceptable , [PER Kim  ] stressed , noting that the [LOC Blue House  ] had emphasized to the [ORG ROK  ] press this week that President [PER Lee  ] would never “buy” a summit with the [LOC North  ] .
