( C ) Reports of coup plots against PM [ORG Erdogan  ] 's [MISC Islamist-leaning  ] government have been a staple of the [MISC Turkish  ] media since 2007 . 
Despite protests by [LOC Turkey  ] 's top brass that there is no substance to the allegations , a growing percentage of the population believes that at least some elements within the military have been plotting to undermine or even overthrow the [MISC AKP-led  ] government . 
The coup allegations have served as fodder for the [MISC Ergenekon  ] prosecution team and some of the plots have been included in the formal indictments against senior retired military officers . 
The net result of these allegations has been a gradual erosion of the public trust toward the military . 
The latest reports related to the " Sledgehammer " plan ( ref a ) come at a time when the government is preparing the process of amending the constitution to allow military personnel to be tried in civilian courts ( ref b ) . 
With the pro-Islamist media fanning the flames and the [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff 's consistently inadequate responses to each allegation , public opinion is becoming less unquestioning vis a vis the military ; this could help strengthen [ORG AKP  ] 's position as it mulls steps to amend the [MISC Turkish  ] constitution in order to affect a shift in the civil-military balance in its favor , although [ORG AKP  ] , s own support has eroded considerably over the past year . 
End Summary . 
Coup [MISC Chronicles: A Review  ] ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over the course of the last two-and-a-half years , the [MISC Turkish  ] military has faced a number of allegations of coup plotting having occurred within its ranks , especially in the 2003 to 2004 period . 
These allegations have increased in tempo over the last year , with the liberal daily " [LOC Taraf  ] " ( " [MISC Side  ] " ) -- whose tagline is: " To Think is to Take [MISC Sides  ] " -- leading the charge in breaking many of the often-sensational stories that draw on leaked information from unnamed military or judicial sources . 
( Comment: [LOC Taraf  ] owner [PER Basar Arslan  ] has publicly dismissed claims that [LOC Taraf  ] is secretly funded by the [PER Fetullah Gulen  ] movement . 
End Comment ) . 
[ORG Paras  ] 8-14 outline the key allegations that have surfaced in the [MISC Turkish  ] media since 2007 . 
Common Threads -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) One of the common threads in this review is that the alleged plans are all variations on a theme: they all involve efforts to sow chaos or foment public opposition to the [ORG AKP  ] and to create the conditions for a military intervention . 
None of the alleged plots involve a direct military takeover ( Comment: The military 's problem in such a scenario is that it knows its interventions and coup plots are not popular among the population . 
The last " successful " coup -- in 1980 -- occurred in response to a massive breakdown of public order as armed political , ethnic and criminal gangs engaged in violent attacks . 
The core accusation in these current scenarios is the allegation that the military this time would foment the violence themselves , blaming radical , [MISC Islamic  ] and other groups , and then step in to " restore order " after the government fails to do so . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Another common theme is that all the allegations put the military in an almost impossible position of having to prove a negative -- that it did not engage in the planning actions alleged by the media reports -- to a public , some parts of whom are increasingly suspicious of the military with each new claim . 
While we may never know the extent to which each of these allegations are true , it is clear from statements by former [MISC Turkish  ] General Staff Chief [PER Gen. Ozkok  ] that , at the very least , there was serious consideration given within the military in 2003 to 2004 to overthrow the [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000150 002 OF 004 [MISC AKP-led  ] government . 
[LOC Polling Data  ] and Net Effect Thus Far ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The series of allegations has been eroding the public 's confidence in the military . 
While the military still enjoys strong support among the public -- one poll by [PER Genar Polling  ] in November 2009 indicated that 80.6 percent of those surveyed viewed the military as the institution that inspires most confidence , 15 points above the presidency , which came in second -- this support has slipped . 
A poll conducted by [PER A&G Polling  ] in January indicated that while public support for the military was around 90 percent before the [MISC Ergenekon  ] investigations began , public support has dropped to 63.4 percent . 
[ORG Ipsos  ] KMG also published a poll in early January indicating the trust in the military had declined from 85 to 90 percent before the [MISC Ergenekon  ] allegations , to 73 percent in late 2009 . 
Another poll conducted in early January by [MISC Turkish  ] polling firm [ORG MetroPoll  ] , before the " Sledgehammer " story broke , found that 30 percent of respondents in the January poll indicated that their trust in the military has decreased . 
55 percent of respondents also believed that " there is a group within the military which is preparing to stage a coup , " a rise of 7 percent from July 2009 figures . 
Despite the decreasing confidence in the military indicated by one of three respondents , 62 percent of respondents did not believe that the military would stage another coup. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Secularists who question the motives of the [ORG AKP  ] and the timing of each new coup plot allegation are convinced that most of the claims are a combination of fabrication and manipulation of actual military documents and that there is a systematic campaign to erode the trust of the military . 
TGS chief [PER Basbug  ] has led this charge , calling the series of media stories an " asymmetric attack " targeting the [ORG Turkish Armed Forces  ] . 
Even as he denounced the media reports , however , Basbug has also clearly committed the military to supporting democracy and the rule of law and has stated that the era of coups in [LOC Turkey  ] is over ( ref. b ) . 
Comment: Stage is Set for [ORG Constitutional Reform  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) With the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] 's unanimous decision to overturn a law extending civilian jurisdiction over military personnel for crimes including coup plotting ( ref c ) , the government has announced that it plans to seek a referendum to change [LOC Turkey  ] 's constitution to affect this change . 
Many of the other possible constitutional reforms being considered by the government -- such as changing the structure of the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] and limiting clauses often used to justify the prosecution of nationalist [MISC Kurds  ] and [MISC Islamist  ] politicians -- would attract the opposition of the military and its political supporters . 
The apparent rise in distrust among the [MISC Turkish  ] populace toward the military , particularly after " Sledgehammer , " which allegedly would have targeted average [LOC Turks  ] in an arbitrary manner , could work to the [ORG AKP  ] 's advantage as it looks to further shift the balance of power in civ-mil relations through constitutional reforms , although [ORG AKP  ] , s own standing is greatly diminished from only one year ago . 
[MISC COUP DIARIES  ] AND ALLEGED PLOTS ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( SBU ) Excerpts of diary entries dating back to 2003 and 2004 allegedly belonging to then-Naval Forces Commander Admiral [PER Ozden Ornek  ] were first published by the weekly " [MISC Nokta  ] " in 2007 ( Comment: The magazine was closed shortly after it published these documents . 
End Comment ) . 
The diary entries -- popularly known as the " [MISC Coup Diaries  ] " -- laid out in detail discussions among senior military officers of steps the military needed to take to unseat the [MISC Islamist-leaning  ] Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] , which came to power in 2002 . 
" [MISC Sarikiz  ] " ( " Blondie " ) was the initial coup plan developed by then-Jandarma Commander General [ORG Eruygur  ] , which involved a coordinated effort among the military and other elements of [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular elite , to effect the removal of the [ORG AKP  ] from power . 
The plot allegedly had the support of all the other force commanders at the time ( Land Forces Commander General [PER Aytac Yalman  ] , [ORG Air Forces  ] Commander General [PER Ibrahim Firtina  ] , [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000150 003 OF 004 and [ORG Naval Forces  ] Commander Admiral [PER Ornek  ] ) . 
[MISC Then-Turkish  ] General Staff ( TGS ) Chief General [PER Hilmi Ozkok  ] reportedly rejected the coup proposal , which led [ORG Eruygur  ] and former [ORG First Army  ] Commander General [PER Hursuit Tolon  ] to develop other plots entitled " [MISC Ayisigi  ] " ( " Moonlight " ) and " [MISC Yakamoz  ] " ( " [MISC Phosphorescence  ] " ) , which provided operational details of a coup that would involve the removal of General [PER Ozkok  ] and the restructuring of the military . 
Other related plans related to the plot with code names " [MISC Eldiven  ] " ( " [MISC Glove  ] " ) and " [MISC Demiryumruk  ] " ( " [MISC Iron Fist  ] " ) reportedly provided more details about steps to be taken in the aftermath of a successful coup. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( SBU ) These plots were included in the [MISC Ergenekon  ] prosecutors' second indictment in March 2009 , and provided the legal basis for the detention of retired generals [ORG Eruygur  ] and [PER Tolon  ] ( who were initially arrested in July 2008 and were detained without formal charges until the release of the indictment ) . 
[ORG Eruygur  ] has been identified as the alleged head of [MISC Ergenekon  ] while [PER Tolon  ] is considered a leading member . 
Retired force commanders [PER Firtina  ] , [PER Ornek  ] , and [PER Yalman  ] were interviewed by [MISC Ergenekon  ] prosecutors in early December 2009 , but have not been charged ; [PER Firtina  ] publicly denied involvement in any coup plots . 
According to press accounts , General [PER Ozkok  ] acknowledged during testimony to [MISC Ergenekon  ] prosecutors in April 2009 that most of the contents of the " coup diaries " were true and that he was aware of plans to overthrow the government among elements within the military but did not have hard evidence to move against the plotters . 
" KAFES " ( OPERATION CAGE ) ------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( SBU ) This plot involved senior navy flag officers and was uncovered during the April 2009 search of the home of retired Navy Lieutenant Commander [PER Levent Bektas  ] , an [MISC Ergenekon  ] suspect , and was revealed by [LOC Taraf  ] in November 2009 . 
CDs found in [PER Bektas  ] 's home reportedly revealed a plot drafted in March 2009 headed by [MISC then-Sea Area North Commander  ] Vice Admiral [PER Feyyaz Ogutcu  ] ( now retired ) and current [LOC Sea Area South  ] Commander [PER Kadir Sardic  ] . 
The plot included plans to assassinate prominent non-Muslim figures and blame these attacks on the [ORG AKP  ] in order to increase foreign and domestic pressure for the [ORG AKP  ] to step down . 
Media reports indicated that the plan included setting off a bomb planted at the submarine exhibit at the [PER Rahmi Koc Museum  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] and using women to obtain information from other navy officers and entrap them into supporting [MISC Ergenekon  ] . 
[PER Bektas  ] has been under arrest as part of the [MISC Ergenekon  ] probe , as well as several active duty officers , including Lt. [PER Col. Halil Ozsarac  ] , and colonels [PER Levent Gulmen  ] and [PER Mucahit Erakyol  ] . 
Thus far , neither [PER Ogutcu  ] or [PER Sardic  ] has been questioned about this plot. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( SBU ) [LOC Taraf  ] reporter [PER Mehmet Baransu  ] , who broke the news about " [PER Kafes  ] , " received an award from the [ORG Turkish Journalists Association  ] for his " [PER Kafes  ] " reporting , but was also investigated for violating the confidentiality of an ongoing criminal investigation . 
While those charges have been dropped , there is an ongoing case against [PER Baransu  ] and [LOC Taraf  ] manager [PER Adnan Demir  ] for " openly insulting the military institution of the state , " in violation of [MISC Section 301 of the Turkish Penal Code  ] . 
[ORG ACTION PLAN AGAINST FUNDAMENTALISM  ] ( refs d and e ) --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) Photocopies of the alleged " Action Plan Against Fundamentalism " were published by [LOC Taraf  ] as a front-page story in June 2009 . 
The plan outlined a psychological operations campaign to discredit the ruling Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] ( [ORG AKP  ] ) as well as other " sources of fundamentalism , " including the [PER Fetullah Gulen  ] movement . 
The action plan was allegedly drafted by [ORG Naval Infantry Colonel  ] [PER Dursun Cicek  ] in 2009 under orders of then-Deputy [ORG CHOD Igsiz  ] , with the knowledge and tacit approval of General [PER Basbug  ] himself . 
The [ORG TGS  ] denied the existence of such a plan , with General [PER Basbug  ] dismissing the photocopied documents as " a piece of paper . 
" The allegation came roaring back to life in November 2009 when [LOC Taraf  ] claimed that it had received -- from an anonymous military officer -- the original copy of the plan with [PER Cicek  ] 's " wet " signature . 
[PER Cicek  ] was detained in July 2009 for his role in drafting the plan , but was released due to lack of evidence . 
He was again detained and interviewed by [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000150 004 OF 004 prosecutors in November 2009 , but was again released without charges . 
ASSASSINATION PLOT AGAINST DEPUTY PM ( ref f ) -------------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( SBU ) On December 19 , two active duty [MISC Turkish  ] special forces officers were arrested by the police near the residence of Deputy Prime Minister [PER Bulent Arinc  ] . 
This led to allegations that the military was planning to assassinate [PER Arinc  ] . 
As a result , the civilian judiciary issued a court order to search the offices of the officers which are located at the [ORG TGS Special Forces Mobilization Command  ] . 
After initial refusal by the military to allow a broader search of the premises , [ORG CHOD  ] [PER Basbug  ] , along with Land Forces Commander ( and likely successor to [PER Basbug  ] as [ORG CHOD  ] in August 2010 ) General Kosaner , met with PM Erdogan on December 26 . 
Following this meeting , a second search warrant was issued to allow a judge to review the classified documents stored at the [ORG Mobilization Command  ] headquarters . 
These searches are ongoing , but to date , the investigators have not announced any discovery of evidence that would support the claims of an assassination plot against [PER Arinc  ] . 
" [MISC BALYOZ  ] " ( SLEDGEHAMMER ) ( ref a ) ------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( SBU ) " Sledgehammer , " the latest alleged plot , was allegedly drafted in 2003 by the [ORG Turkish First Army  ] , under its then-commander Gen. [PER Cetin Dogan  ] . 
The plan , which has been denied by both the military and retired General [PER Dogan  ] , involved false-flag bombing of mosques and efforts to provoke a military crisis with [LOC Greece  ] in order to create the conditions for a military intervention . 
The plan , as revealed by " [LOC Taraf  ] " on January 20 -- a day before the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] 's decision overturning the law allowing civilian jurisdiction over certain offenses committed by the military -- allegedly included lists of names of politicians and journalists to be arrested , as well as names of politicians who would serve in a new government after the removal of the [ORG AKP  ] .
