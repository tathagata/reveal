End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In an October 1 meeting , poloff queried [PER Gameela Ismail  ] about [PER Nour  ] 's willingness to accept a health-based pardon , versus amnesty granted by President [PER Mubarak  ] under constitutional [ORG Article  ] 149 . 
( Note: As reported reftel , with amnesty under [ORG Article  ] 149 , [PER Nour  ] could potentially be exempted from a ban on political activities that will otherwise be in place following his release . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Ayman Qaffas  ] , the new [ORG State Information Service  ] chief ( and son-in-law of EGIS director [PER Omar Soliman  ] ) , had alleged to Ambassador on September 28 that [PER Nour  ] refused to sign a petition for clemency based on his poor health . 
[PER Ismail  ] denied that claim , and asserted that just the opposite has occurred ) over the past few months , [PER Nour  ] 's lawyer has reportedly filed three separate health-based pardon requests , at [PER Nour  ] , s urging , to President [PER Mubarak  ] , the [ORG Prosecutor-General  ] , and the [ORG Tora Prison  ] doctor ( the three officials who reportedly have the right to grant such a pardon ) . 
[PER Ismail  ] noted that , while " of course " [PER Nour  ] would prefer a full pardon under [ORG Article  ] 149 , to include a provision for him to continue his political activities upon his release , he would still " most definitely " accept a pardon based on his poor health , or any other basis. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ismail  ] said that the " [MISC Committee for Forensic Medicine  ] " ( under the [ORG Prosecutor-General  ] 's Office ) had visited [PER Nour  ] a month ago , in response to his request for a health-based pardon . 
They reportedly did not conduct a medical exam during their visit ) " just spoke to him for 5 minutes " ) and [PER Nour  ] subsequently sent a complaint to the [ORG Prosecutor-General  ] about the lack of a rigorous medical check . 
The [ORG Prosecutor-General  ] agreed to send the committee to [ORG Tora Prison  ] again ; the new exam is scheduled for October 5 . 
[PER Nour  ] and [PER Ismail  ] are hopeful that [PER Nour  ] might be released on the October 6 national holiday ( when the President traditionally grants many prisoners amnesty ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Ismail  ] gave poloff a letter from [PER Nour  ] to the Secretary ( text of [MISC Embassy  ] translation at para 6 ) , in which he requests the Secretary advocate for his release ( under constitutional [ORG Article  ] 149 ) as part of the October 6 prisoner amnesty . 
[PER Ismail  ] visited [PER Nour  ] on September 30 , and told poloff that he asked [PER Ismail  ] to seek a meeting with the Secretary during her visit to [LOC Cairo  ] . 
[PER Ismail  ] said , after " serious deliberation , " she has chosen not to do so , because she is afraid that such a meeting , which would inevitably become public , would be more harmful than helpful. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Poloff reiterated to [PER Ismail  ] the Ambassador 's standing invitation to meet . 
[PER Ismail  ] said that she would like to meet with the Ambassador after [PER Ramadan  ] ( Note: She and [PER Nour  ] are hopeful that he might get released with other prisoners on October 6 or during an end of [PER Ramadan  ] prisoner release ; she is concerned about meeting with the Secretary or Ambassador prior to those dates , in case it might upset the possibility of his getting a holiday pardon ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Begin  ] text of [MISC Embassy  ] translation of [PER Nour  ] letter: Madam Doctor -- From behind thick bars and a place beyond the sun 's reach , I welcome you . 
I do not know whether or not I will be able to smuggle this letter to you before the date of your arrival in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
And I do not know that if I succeed it will reach you . 
All I hope for is that my lines , which I fill with a welcome to you to [LOC Cairo  ] , reach you . 
And because I am not in a position to [LOC CAIRO  ] 00006171 002 OF 004 present a flower bouquet with this welcome , as a token of friendship , I will attempt to present old and new quotes which will bear what I wish flowers would have borne and expressed . 
Quote 1: ( 1300 [ORG BC  ] ) , Source: An old [MISC Egyptian  ] papyrus that dates back to 1300 [ORG BC  ] and is in the [MISC British  ] Museum under the number 10060 . 
In it , the son of the [PER God Ra  ] , a says: " I am a prince , son of a prince , the seed of my father must spawn a [PER God  ] . 
I am the oldest , son of the oldest , I shall cross to my father 's kingdom and all of your tears will be the sea , the waves of which will carry me to the throne of my father [PER Ra  ] , a ! 8 Quote 2: ( March 1919 ) , Source: The shouts of [MISC Egyptians  ] during March and April 1919 , when the first civic revolution in modern [MISC Egyptian  ] history broke out , and the [MISC Egyptian  ] masses were shouting for the life of two people -- the first , the banished leader of the [MISC Egyptian  ] revolution [PER Saad Zaghloul  ] , and the second , President [PER Wilson  ] who elaborated the [ORG Twelve Principles  ] ( sic ) , the most important of which was the right to self-determination . 
The second scene is the same masses shouting against [PER Wilson  ] when he acknowledged the [MISC British  ] mandate in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Quote 3: ( 1953 ) , Source: A paragraph in a book by a famous writer that President [PER Nasser  ] imprisoned for years on the pretext that he had relations with one of the [ORG U.S. State Department  ] 's employees , and he remained a prisoner till President [PER Sadat  ] granted him amnesty . 
[PER Mostafa Amin  ] says in his book " Laughing [LOC America  ] " edition of 1953 , page 13: " The [MISC American  ] loves speed , and that is the secret behind the alliance between [MISC American  ] policy and dictatorships , but what it gains quickly , it loses quicker , for [LOC America  ] ) despite its love for speed - is in the habit of missing the train , but then it notices and it runs after the train , it even buys a car especially for that purpose , but that does not help , so it buys a plane , and just like that it pays the price of the train doubled ! 
Maybe [LOC America  ] gains a lot when it exports to us arms and cars or planes , but it loses more when it does not export the best that its civilization has produced which is 'Freedom and Democracy and [ORG Human Rights.'  ] 
The value of [LOC America  ] is that it should defend this product , not only in its country but throughout the world ! 
It may harm some of its interests , but it will make gains that will live hundreds of years , for the friendship of peoples live forever , because the peoples do not die , but governments change like the winter weather . 
Quote 4: ( 1992 ) , Source: An anecdote that my professor [PER Dr.  ] [PER Vitali Naokeen  ] told in [LOC Moscow  ] , at the [ORG Orientalism Institution  ] . 
He said to me , " Do you know that if you drown in an ocean and you are surrounded by a group of friends , and the first is [MISC Russian  ] , the second is [MISC American  ] , the third is [MISC English  ] , the fourth is [MISC French  ] , the fifth is [MISC German  ] , and the sixth is [MISC Japanese  ] - what would each of them do for you ? 
The [MISC Russian  ] will jump after you to rescue you , but you have to know that he does not know how to swim , so he will die before you ; the [MISC French  ] will scream condemning the [MISC American  ] 's position , but that of course will not rescue you ; the [MISC German  ] will swim to you bravely but he might come back without rescuing you , claiming that you might be [MISC Jewish  ] . 
The [MISC Briton  ] will yell: 'Wait , our [MISC American  ] allies will come to rescue you immediately ! , As for the [MISC Japanese  ] , he will not pay you any attention , but will think of how to help your children . 
The [MISC American  ] will be very sorry about the incident . 
But the [MISC American  ] being sorry for the drowning of a dear friend will not help you in the bottom of the ocean and will not help your children after you , .8 Quote 5: ( 2005 ) , Source: A meeting with your Excellency at the [LOC Cairo Airport Sheraton  ] , during the first half of 2005 after the famous [ORG American University  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] lecture you delivered during your visit to [LOC Cairo  ] . 
And I remember that described the political reforms -that 'he' declared- as a 'pseudopregnancy' and that opening the door for nominations to the Presidential elections , only means that these revolving doors would hit us in the face if we try to enter or pass . 
Quote 6: ( December 2005 ) , Source: An article by the renowned [MISC American  ] writer [PER Jackson Diehl  ] , dated December 13 , under the headline " [PER Mubarak  ] Outdoes Himself , " where he wrote , " with what [PER Mubarak  ] did to his competitor [PER Ayman Nour  ] and the strongest competitor to his son , he wanted to crush liberal opposition ) the strength of which began to show this year - [LOC CAIRO  ] 00006171 003 OF 004 and to finish the future of liberal reformers , to confront the [LOC U.S.  ] with a choice between continuing his rule and then that of his son or that of a fundamentalist [MISC Islamic  ] movement . 
" This article was published a only few days before I was imprisoned . 
Quote 7: ( September 2006 ) , Source: President [PER Bush  ] , s recent [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] interview where he revealed that he talked to [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] about the issue of releasing [PER Ayman Nour  ] and expects a decree to be issued by President [PER Mubarak  ] in this regard . 
The Final Quote: ( September 21 , 2006 ) , Source: President [PER Mubarak  ] , s closing speech during the [ORG National Democratic Party  ] conference , announcing that " we do not accept foreign intervention in domestic affairs . 
" Also , the President and his son refused to answer the request by 110 members of the [MISC Egyptian  ] Parliament , to act in accordance with Article 149 of the constitution and grant full amnesty to [PER Ayman Nour  ] to suspend his penalty of prison , and nullify the additional penalty of banning him from being nominated for office for 17 complete years ( which means till December 2032 ) . 
[PER Gracious Doctor  ] , when you refused to come to [LOC Cairo  ] in February 2005 , you said that you refuse to come to [LOC Cairo  ] as a " planting priest " ( sic ) . 
And the expression surprised me at the time , but it inspired me to put before you now while you are in [LOC Cairo  ] this bouquet of different quotes from different times and eras , and maybe it says what the jail and the jailer are trying to prevent from reaching you and all those who are free or call for freedom in the world . 
[PER Dear Madam  ] , what makes me take this risk which involves many threats that can aggravate my dilemma , is not just concern for my threatened life , or my family that is deprived of its sole breadwinner , and not even my party which was the last civil hope for democratic reform and is now endangered with more problems to finish it off and strangle it financially and legally . 
But my goal is to save the remaining hope in the eyes of those who call for reform in this homeland . 
After despair of the future seized them , as the regime managed to intimidate them with what happened to me and frustrate them with its inattention to the reactions and its ability to surmount them by reiterating that interests always triumph over principles . 
And it ( the regime ) has the skill of manipulation and mixing cards and stalling for time and imposing a fait accompli ; I faced a ludicrous and fabricated charge and was referred to a specific judge , and the trial was a legal and moral farce that the world witnessed and embassies , representatives followed-up , as the chapters of the trial focused on accusing them of being agents and receiving millions of dollars from [LOC America  ] , which is of course completely untrue , but also far removed from a public accusation . 
That is the forgery ! 
A sentence of 5 years imprisonment was issued , but the more shocking surprise is that this sentence bans me for 12 years afterwards from practicing a professional career as a lawyer or journalist , and from political and partisan work , which means that until 2023 I will have no rights . 
This sentence and its consequences are unavoidable unless a Presidential Amnesty is granted under Article 149 of the constitution . 
Nobody other than the President can exercise this right , which 110 [MISC Parliamentarians  ] asked President [PER Mubarak  ] weeks ago to do , but he ignored the request and has not answered it thus far . 
I would like to emphasize that my life is now in great danger because of the conditions in my prison , and specifically the harsh conditions that have been inflicted upon me , and my being handcuffed for intervals that amount to 13 hours a day , not to mention denying me all my legal rights to write , correspond or even move , to the point that I now have rheumatism due to my lack of mobility and my diabetes is getting worse , and my heart arteries are clogged in light of the government denying me appropriate medical treatment , and my undergoing any operation and even denying me 'civil' food . 
On October 6 , after 48 hours , President [PER Mubarak  ] will issue ) on the occasion of the October War and the start of his rule - amnesty for thousands of prisoners , and so far I am not one of them . 
And based on my request and that of the 110 parliamentarians , a doctor from the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] will come to my prison on the morning of October 5 ( just a few [LOC CAIRO  ] 00006171 004 OF 004 hours before the President 's decision on amnesty is announced ) to examine me , and of course if there are no specific instructions or a decision by President [PER Mubarak  ] , there will not be any new developments regarding my case on October 5 or 6 . 
Asking that the President issue an amnesty decree regarding my case , on October 6 , together with the thousands of criminal prisoners expected to be released then is an urgent request at this time . 
And it is the means to alleviate the consequences of my sentence , in that it suspends my political rights until 2023 , for what is taking place now is a lawless execution or a bloodless murder and an elimination and a punishment to provide an example for anyone who even thinks of being a substitute or an honorable competitor in [MISC Egyptian  ] politics . 
We stand before a final sentence , there is no road that they have not closed , and we have no other way forward except a presidential amnesty in accordance with the constitution . 
And after over a year of my imprisonment , there is no longer a point in talking about a right time and/or conducive circumstances , for the judiciary that is still asking for its independence has nothing to do with the issue now , and granting amnesty bears no suspicion of interfering in the affairs of the judiciary which ceased to be tied to the sentence after issuing it and there is nothing left except putting the constitution into effect ; the constitution which endowed the President to grant this amnesty . 
Thank you very much in advance for the sincere efforts you exert .
