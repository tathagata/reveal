( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
In order to confront the sustained terrorist threat to the [LOC United States  ] and our [MISC European  ] allies , we must find innovative , flexible and proactive approaches to strengthen the effectiveness of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism . 
My Mission inter-agency team has held extensive discussions of prevailing threat levels in [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Spain  ] 's role in the collective security scheme of [LOC Europe  ] and the western [MISC Mediterranean  ] and believes that the creation of a counterterrorism and law enforcement hub in [LOC Barcelona  ] would significantly bolster [LOC US  ] regional capabilities . 
Specifically , we propose that our Consulate General in [LOC Barcelona  ] become the platform for a multi-agency , jointly-coordinated counterterrorism , anti-crime , and intelligence center to work with our [MISC Spanish  ] hosts in combating the target-rich environment of terrorist and criminal activities centered in the region . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is a past and current al-Qaeda target and a critical player in [MISC US-EU  ] counterterrorism efforts , due to its close proximity to the [LOC Maghreb  ] and the presence of over 1 million [MISC Muslims  ] . 
Mission [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Country Team  ] strategy has been to develop a two-nation , multi-agency approach to confront the terrorist threat in all its aspects . 
We leverage the human and organizational resources , in addition to intelligence capabilities , of relevant [LOC US  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement agencies as we increasingly recognize and combat the links between terrorist networks and criminals involved in the contraband of goods , drug trafficking , money laundering , human smuggling , and document falsification . 
Our approach is to maximize our resource allocation by ensuring that all Mission elements have a role to play in working with our [MISC Spanish  ] hosts in the fight against terror and crime. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [LOC Barcelona  ] is the capital of the region [LOC Catalonia  ] and a city of approximately 1.6 million people located on the [MISC Mediterranean  ] [ORG Sea  ] in northeastern [LOC Spain  ] . 
Situated just below [LOC France  ] 's southern border , the inhabitants of [LOC Spain  ] 's second city have historically believed themselves to be different culturally from the rest of [LOC Spain  ] ; a crossroads of languages , cultures , and history . 
[LOC Barcelona  ] has become one of [LOC Europe  ] 's premier cities ( sealed during its successful hosting of the 1992 Summer [MISC Olympic Games  ] ) , but also a haven for illicit activities that threaten our interests. //BARCELONA: PROFILE OF THE RISING THREAT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Large [MISC Muslim Population Susceptible  ] to Jihadist [MISC Recruitment: As  ] a result of increased monitoring of radical [MISC Islamist  ] activity since the March 11 , 2004 train bombings in [LOC Madrid  ] perpetrated by al-Qaeda affiliates in [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC Maghreb  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] and [LOC US  ] authorities have identified [LOC Catalonia  ] as a major [MISC Mediterranean  ] center of radical [MISC Islamist  ] activity . 
In February 2007 , a suspected al-Qaeda operative was arrested near [LOC Barcelona  ] and charged with recruiting new members for a terrorist cell based in [LOC North Africa  ] . 
Three months later , authorities detained 11 more suspected [MISC Islamist  ] extremist terrorists in and around [LOC Barcelona  ] , including at least one purported imam . 
These individuals had false documents , large sums of cash , and multiple mobile phones , and [MISC Spanish  ] police say their aim was to recruit terrorists for attacks in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] media reported in July 2007 that the [MISC Iraqi  ] terrorist group [ORG Ansar al-Islam  ] had established a recruiting cell in [LOC Catalonia  ] to route would-be suicide bombers through a terrorist pipeline to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 00001914 002.2 OF 005 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Heavy immigration - both legal and illegal - from [LOC North Africa  ] ( [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Tunisia  ] , and [LOC Algeria  ] ) and [LOC Southeast Asia  ] ( [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Bangladesh  ] ) has made this region a magnet for terrorist recruiters . 
The [ORG Spanish National Police  ] estimates that there may be upwards of 60,000 [MISC Pakistanis  ] living in [LOC Barcelona  ] and the surrounding area ; the vast majority are male , unmarried or unaccompanied , and without legal documentation . 
There are even more such immigrants from [LOC North Africa  ] . 
Once here , they share a similar fate: they live on the edges of [MISC Spanish  ] society , they do not speak the language , they are often unemployed , and they have very few places to practice their religion with dignity . 
Individually , these circumstances would provide fertile ground for terrorist recruitment ; taken together , the threat is clear . 
In light of recent suspected activity , there is little doubt that the autonomous region of [LOC Catalonia  ] has become a prime base of operations for terrorist activity . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities tell us they fear the threat from these atomized immigrant communities prone to radicalism , but they have very little intelligence on or ability to penetrate these groups. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Drug Traffickers , Money Launders Gravitate to the [MISC Region: Drug  ] use is on the rise all across [LOC Spain  ] , but particularly in [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] remains the principal entry and transshipment zone for the large quantities of [MISC South American  ] cocaine , [MISC Moroccan  ] cannabis , and [MISC Afghan  ] heroin destined for [MISC Spanish  ] and [ORG European Union  ] consumer markets . 
[LOC Spain  ] is also a major source and transit location for drug proceeds returning to [MISC South  ] and [LOC Central America  ] . 
A recent report by the [ORG US Department  ] of the [ORG Treasury  ] notes that [LOC Spain  ] is the [MISC European  ] base where drug traffickers start the process of cleansing their cash proceeds . 
[LOC US  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] officials consider [LOC Barcelona  ] to be a key operational base for distribution and financing for [LOC Colombia  ] 's cocaine cartels . 
These drug traffickers view the region as a hospitable environment and increasingly ply their trade in and around [LOC Barcelona  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities are having trouble following the flow of illegal drugs and laundered money through this region , but believe that cartels have established interconnected groups of front companies and continuously changing bank accounts to pass of drug money as legitimate earnings . 
[ORG ICE Madrid  ] has conducted several recent investigations involving money launderers who are conducting business for the purpose of laundering illicit proceeds in [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
These individuals represent various ethnic groups and nationalities , reinforcing the region 's magnetic effect on nefarious activity. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Trafficking in [MISC Persons  ] and Illegal Smuggling: [LOC Spain  ] remains both a transit and destination country for internationally trafficked persons , primarily women trafficked for prostitution , and we are seeing increasing incidences of trafficking based in [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
The [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] reported that the [LOC Barcelona  ] airport has seen an increase in the number of trafficking victims passing through in recent months . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities tell us that [MISC Chinese  ] , [MISC Romanian  ] , and [MISC Kosovar-Albanian  ] mafias have settled in [LOC Catalonia  ] and spread down the [MISC Mediterranean  ] coast in recent years , and continue to gain strength . 
These groups use their military training and criminal expertise to run prostitution rings , and [MISC Spanish  ] authorities do not have a complete grasp of the entire spectrum of the mafias' activities . 
[ORG ICE Madrid  ] has worked closely with the [ORG Spanish National Police  ] to disrupt a child pornography ring run by a [MISC Russian  ] criminal organization based in [LOC Catalonia.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Organized Crime and [MISC Counterfeiting:  ] The [MISC Spanish  ] government is at the forefront of [MISC European  ] and global efforts [LOC MADRID  ] 00001914 003.2 OF 005 to combat organized crime . 
Major crime groups made up of [MISC Russians  ] , [MISC Ukrainians  ] , and [MISC Lithuanians  ] have set up shop along [LOC Spain  ] 's eastern coast ; including [LOC Barcelona  ] , [LOC Tarragona  ] , and [ORG Valencia  ] . 
Most [MISC Chinese  ] organized crime is located in [LOC Barcelona  ] , and to a lesser extent [ORG Valencia  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities have had a string of operational successes against some of these groups , but remain challenged to cope with the magnitude of the problem , and key organized crime figures and groups continue to operate in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Counterfeit euro and [LOC US  ] dollar bills are increasingly manufactured in and passed through [LOC Spain  ] . 
[LOC Catalonia  ] , the [LOC Balearic Islands  ] , and nearby [LOC Andorra  ] are prime areas for this illicit movement . 
More than 25% of the [ORG EU  ] 's 500-euro notes are found along [LOC Spain  ] 's eastern coast , where they are presumably used in large-scale drug and money transactions . 
In addition , our Mission agencies have to focus more on credit card fraud perpetrated by a web of diversified criminal organizations , often comprised of immigrant communities in [LOC Catalonia.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Port Security: The Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) team is at full strength and working with [ORG Port of Barcelona  ] officials to screen US-bound shipments before they leave port . 
The port is one of [LOC Europe  ] 's busiest , facilitating shipping throughout the [MISC Mediterranean  ] . 
In June 2007 , [ORG CSI Algeciras  ] seized a large shipment of weapons ( many of them stolen and with their serial numbers scratched off ) , reportedly destined for [LOC Nicaragua  ] by way of [LOC Puerto Rico  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities recently have seized many cocaine-laden containers in the [ORG Port of Barcelona  ] . 
Our [ORG CSI  ] colleagues believe the seaports along [LOC Spain  ] 's eastern [MISC Mediterranean  ] coastline will see an increase in the amount of cargo passing through , and [LOC US  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] authorities will be further challenged to detect illegal contraband. //LEVERAGING SUBSTANTIAL [MISC SPANISH  ] ASSETS// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The presence of a highly professional inter-agency team working out of our Consulate General in [LOC Barcelona  ] would help leverage the substantial resources and expertise of [MISC Spanish  ] and regional authorities in a more focused campaign , and serve as a force multiplier for our joint fight . 
The hub concept can also serve as a potential model of how we can work with our [MISC European  ] allies in common purpose on law enforcement , security , and intelligence initiatives away from the more bureaucratic and politicized world of capital cities . 
Certainly , the [MISC Spanish  ] government has been focused on terrorism for almost 40 years due to its struggles against the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] . 
Since March 11 , 2004 , [LOC Spain  ] has also actively worked to counter the threat from [MISC Islamic  ] extremism . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] political class is gradually waking up to the amorphous threat represented by the nexus of terrorism , crime , and drug trafficking , and would likely look favorably on our proposal . 
On a regional and local level , [MISC Catalan  ] security forces have substantial capabilities and would welcome the opportunity to increase the depth and breadth of [LOC CT  ] and law enforcement cooperation with the [LOC US  ] . 
However , we would have to carefully broach this hub concept with the central [MISC Spanish  ] government , who may be wary of ceding more authority and responsibility to [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
[ORG CG Barcelona  ] has maintained excellent contacts with the [ORG Spanish National Police  ] , [ORG Civil Guard  ] , [ORG Mossos  ] d'Esquadra ( [MISC Catalan  ] security force ) and [ORG Barcelona Police  ] , but these contacts could and should be put to better use by the on-the-ground presence of the agencies with greater experience that could dedicate more focused day-to-day interaction with the key players in the region . 
[ORG Embassy Madrid  ] has established extensive bilateral contact with the [MISC Spanish  ] government on issues of counterterrorism and law enforcement , but the [ORG USG  ] now needs a regional approach that extends our focus and [LOC MADRID  ] 00001914 004.2 OF 005 reach into the entire western [MISC Mediterranean.  ] //OUR PROPOSAL// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Under the direction of the Deputy Chief of Mission and co-coordinated with the [ORG CG Barcelona  ] , we reached out to the relevant agencies and sections in Mission [LOC Spain  ] and came to agreement on the minimal structure and level of resources needed to get the hub up and running and provide the basis of an effective multi-agency and jointly-coordinated center . 
As this concept moves forward , we will fine tune staffing as required . 
We also will analyze ways to pool ICASS resources between the [ORG USG  ] agencies represented to minimize the number of support staff needed . 
The Principal Officer in [LOC Barcelona  ] would lead the center and would report to the Ambassador through the [ORG DCM  ] . 
Each Assistant [PER Attache  ] would also report to their respective agency and section heads in [LOC Madrid  ] , who would maintain traditional contact with their home agency headquarters in [LOC Washington  ] . 
LEGAT - Assistant Legal [PER Attache  ] and one [MISC OMS  ] support staff . 
The [ORG ALAT  ] would focus liaison efforts with the [ORG Mossos  ] d'Esquadra , who have the most significant law enforcement presence in the region . 
This [ORG ALAT  ] would enhance the effectiveness of the [LOC Madrid  ] LEGAT office , coordinating operations in the [LOC Catalonia  ] region . 
The [ORG FBI  ] 's regional responsibilities would include counterterrorism , cyber-based attacks and high technology crimes , transnational organized crime as well as law enforcement training . 
ICE/CBP/CSI - Assistant ICE/CBP [PER Attache  ] , who would serve as the senior [MISC DHS  ] representative in the consular district and would supervise [ORG CSI  ] operations in [LOC Barcelona  ] and [ORG Valencia  ] . 
In addition , the representative would work with [ORG TSA  ] to monitor flights departing [LOC Barcelona  ] for the [LOC US  ] . 
GRPO - One senior officer to work directly with [MISC Spanish  ] counterparts in [LOC Barcelona  ] and the surrounding area , and possibly one additional officer in a support capacity . 
DEA - [ORG A Regional Agent in Charge  ] ( [ORG RAC  ] ) plus one special agent to provide expertise and assistance to foreign agencies on narcotics and dangerous drug enforcement and control programs . 
The [ORG RAC  ] would also participate in investigations of international illicit drug trafficking and would develop and report on tactical and strategic intelligence . 
[ORG USSS  ] - Assistant [PER Attache  ] to work counterfeit [LOC US  ] currency , credit card fraud , cyber crimes and traditional protective duties . 
Additionally , the [PER Attache  ] would assist other law enforcement agencies by coordinating financial crimes intelligence information available to them through our relationships with local and regional financial institutions . 
ICASS/Management/PAO - One associate management officer , one communications officer , and one [ORG LES  ] support . 
The Public Affairs Officer in [LOC Barcelona  ] would deal primarily with hub-related activities and strengthen our engagement with local [MISC Muslim  ] communities to help counter the extremist messages reaching susceptible audiences . 
RSO - One RSO , one [MISC OMS  ] , and one [ORG LES  ] investigator to work as senior security staff for the consulate , represent the lead agency on visa and passport fraud , and assist the [ORG American Citizen Services  ] unit with [LOC US  ] victims of crime . 
The RSO would also direct residential security , law enforcement liaison , and local guard programs in [LOC Barcelona  ] and monitor [LOC MADRID  ] 00001914 005.2 OF 005 the proper storage of classified information . 
The [ORG LES  ] investigator would maintain liaison with all local and regional forces on matters related to Mission security. //WHY THE CONSULATE ? // <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The threat in [LOC Catalonia  ] is clear . 
[LOC Barcelona  ] has become a crossroads of worrisome activities , a natural meeting place and transit point of people and goods moving to and through the region from all countries bordering the western [MISC Mediterranean  ] . 
The [LOC US  ] needs an on-site ability to quickly see who and what is passing through the area from places such as [LOC Algiers  ] , [LOC Tunis  ] , [LOC Rabat  ] , and the south of [LOC France  ] . 
The Consulate General in [LOC Barcelona  ] would be the ideal platform for the hub because it has the space available , secure communications and a prime location. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG COMMENT:  ] The hub concept is a field-driven strategic proposal to counter , disrupt , and eliminate terrorist and organized crime networks that cross national borders by breaking down regional stovepipes within [ORG USG  ] departments and agencies . 
This center would also build host nation cooperation and capacity to address transnational threats , focusing on the entire western [MISC Mediterranean  ] region . 
[LOC Catalonia  ] has become a key theater of operation for those who would threaten our interests and national security , and the complex and evolving threat requires flexible interaction among the entire [ORG Country Team  ] ; a challenge that the hub would meet head-on . 
END COMMENT .
