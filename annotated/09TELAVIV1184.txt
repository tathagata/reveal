End summary . 
[ORG Washington Visit  ] ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Netanyahu  ] told [PER CODEL Ackerman  ] that he did not feel boxed in politically and that his coalition in fact reflects the demands of the [MISC Israeli  ] public to address their concern about security . 
While some argue that agreements bring security , [PER Netanyahu  ] said [LOC Israel  ] 's experience of the past fifteen years proved that neither agreements nor unilateral withdrawals brought security . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he had told President [PER Obama  ] that while he would not condition negotiations with the [MISC Palestinians  ] on halting [LOC Iran  ] 's progress toward a nuclear weapon , if [LOC Iran  ] obtained such a weapon it would destroy any progress made toward peace . 
He added that [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] and [MISC Jordanian  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] were in complete agreement with him on that point. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) For the sake of both security and peace , the first task is to stop [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] noted that the President had assured him that by the end of the year , the [LOC U.S.  ] will decide whether engagement is working and that the goal is to stop [LOC Iran  ] 's program . 
The President told him that all options remain on the table , a point confirmed by [PER Secretaries Clinton  ] and [ORG Gates  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he and [PER Mubarak  ] agreed that a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] would lead others in the region to develop nuclear weapons , resulting in the biggest threat to non-proliferation efforts since the [ORG Cuban Missile Crisis  ] . 
This " nightmare scenario " is well understood in [LOC Washington  ] , he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to peace efforts , [PER Netanyahu  ] said the President is bringing a fresh approach to regional peace whereby the [MISC Arabs  ] would enhance the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] track . 
It will be especially important to get the [MISC Saudis  ] on board , he added . 
On the two-state solution , [PER Netanyahu  ] noted that the President had stressed his support for two states . 
He had told the President that [MISC Israelis  ] did not want to rule [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he was prepared for " arrangements " with the [MISC Palestinians  ] that would entail some limits on their sovereignty such as no [MISC Palestinian  ] army , and [MISC Israeli  ] control over borders , airspace , and the electromagnetic spectrum . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] asserted that seventy to eighty percent of [MISC Israelis  ] are ready to make concessions for peace but they do not believe they have a [MISC Palestinian  ] partner since [ORG Hamas  ] is in control of [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Iran  ] has a base on [LOC Israel  ] 's border . 
How can there be peace without a new situation in [LOC Gaza  ] , he asked. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to settlements , [PER Netanyahu  ] noted that he had told the President that both [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] had unfulfilled [MISC Roadmap  ] commitments . 
Without elaborating , he noted that there were written and oral understandings between President [ORG Bush  ] and Prime Ministers [ORG Sharon  ] and [ORG Olmert  ] on the [MISC Roadmap  ] . 
In [LOC Gaza  ] , [LOC Israel  ] dismantled twenty-seven settlements but got six thousand rockets from [ORG Hamas  ] in return . 
Support the [ORG PA  ] -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Chairman [PER Ackerman  ] commented that President [ORG Abbas  ] and Prime Minister [PER Fayyad  ] are necessary for progress , and noted that both [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] will be in trouble if they are replaced . 
Something needs to be done to help them stay in power . 
They need material support but also the promise of [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00001184 002 OF 003 statehood . 
Foreign investment in the [LOC West Bank  ] would give a real horizon as well . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] agreed , saying [ORG Gulf Arab  ] investors had been successful in transforming their own societies and could make a great contribution to the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
He added that he wanted to bring [ORG Gulf  ] investors into the [LOC West Bank  ] since they would change reality for the [MISC Palestinians  ] but also give [MISC Israelis  ] confidence . 
[PER Ackerman  ] responded that this was a great idea , but it should come from [ORG Abbas  ] , not [LOC Israel  ] . 
The more credit [ORG Abbas  ] can take for steps forward , the better. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In response to a question about the [ORG PA  ] security forces' capabilities , [PER Netanyahu  ] commented that he supports the [ORG PA  ] 's desire to keep [ORG Hamas  ] at a distance . 
A national unity government without [ORG Hamas'  ] acceptance of the Quartet conditions would serve [ORG Hamas'  ] interests , adding that [LOC Israel  ] has a common interest with the [ORG PA  ] to prevent a [ORG Hamas  ] takeover of the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said there is a steady flow of [MISC Iranian  ] weapons to [LOC Gaza  ] through [LOC Sudan  ] or [LOC Syria  ] and then by sea , but he said [LOC Egypt  ] 's performance in stopping the tunnels has improved now that [LOC Cairo  ] understands that the [MISC Iranian  ] arms pipeline is a direct threat to [LOC Egypt  ] as well. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On the economic side , [PER Netanyahu  ] said he wants to establish a joint plan with the [ORG PA  ] to improve conditions in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
He cited [LOC Cyprus  ] as an example of economic prosperity leading to reduced political tensions . 
[PER Sen. Lautenberg  ] pushed [PER Netanyahu  ] to &put [LOC Israel  ] , s best face forward8 in the [LOC West Bank  ] , and to work with the [ORG PA  ] on water issues , conservation and health , where [LOC Israel  ] could contribute a great deal and there are many opportunities to build cooperation that would benefit people . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] responded that his ministerial committee on improving the lives of [MISC Palestinians  ] in the [LOC West Bank  ] met earlier in the day and that he is committed to overcoming the turf wars and excessive caution that have undercut development efforts in the [LOC West Bank  ] in the past . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] is looking at creative ideas , such as how to facilitate tourism to [LOC Jericho  ] , advance projects in water and agriculture , in addition to promoting business ( note: he estimated that there are 100 projects [LOC Israel  ] is examining in the [LOC West Bank  ] ) . &It is beyond belief8 what can be done in the [LOC West Bank  ] , he said , but he hoped the [ORG PA  ] would engage with [LOC Israel  ] on these efforts . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] added that the fact that there had not been any large anti-Israel demonstrations in the [LOC West Bank  ] during [ORG Operation Cast Lead  ] meant that [MISC Palestinians  ] in the [LOC West Bank  ] want a better life , not confrontation with [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Representative [PER Ellison  ] , noting that he is the first [MISC Muslim  ] to be elected to [ORG Congress  ] , said he visited [LOC Gaza  ] in February and met with [ORG NGO  ] representatives who could deliver assistance without the credit going to [ORG Hamas  ] . 
He urged [PER Netanyahu  ] to consider opening the [LOC Gaza  ] crossings , adding that [MISC Gazans  ] he had met told him they want peace and would like to get their jobs back in [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] responded that he is looking at ways to balance [MISC Israeli  ] security with enabling [MISC Gazans  ] to have a normal life . 
The flow of money and weapons to [ORG Hamas  ] remains a problem since [ORG Hamas  ] is extending the range and payload of the rockets it possesses . 
In response to Representative [PER Ellison  ] 's comment that [LOC Israel  ] should allow [ORG USAID  ] to return to [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] said he thought that it might be a good thing to have [ORG USAID  ] operate in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Settlements and Outposts ------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said that illegal outposts were a legal question and his government would enforce the law . 
The outposts should be removed through dialogue with the [ORG GOI  ] if possible , but it should be done in any case . 
Regarding settlements , [PER Netanyahu  ] said he wants to work with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the basis of the understandings reached with the [ORG Bush Administration  ] , i.e. that [LOC Israel  ] will not build new settlements or seize more land , but if families grow , they will still have the right to build within existing settlement boundaries . 
Now [LOC Israel  ] is hearing that the [LOC U.S.  ] wants no construction at all . 
[MISC Israelis  ] consider this position to be unfair , he said . 
The question is whether the [LOC U.S.  ] is seeking a geographic or a demographic restriction on settlements. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] commented that [LOC Israel  ] needs a common understanding with the [LOC U.S.  ] The [LOC U.S.  ] position should be " reasonable , " since opposition to a total freeze cuts across political parties in [LOC Israel  ] . 
This is more of an issue with the [LOC U.S.  ] than with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] asserted , arguing that the [ORG PA  ] will go along if there is an understanding between [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] He noted that [MISC Israeli  ] officials were meeting with [LOC U.S.  ] officials on this issue , adding that there could be an understanding if the [LOC U.S.  ] wants one . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] commented that he understood there should be no land seizures , but he could not tell settlers [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00001184 003 OF 003 not to have children . 
In response to a question about [ORG GOI  ] incentives to settlers , [PER Netanyahu  ] 's adviser [PER Ron Dermer  ] said the [ORG Olmert  ] government had already removed them . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said this was an issue that [LOC Israel  ] could discuss further with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Iranian  ] Threat -------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Chairman [PER Ackerman  ] said that in his meetings with [MISC Arab  ] leaders , he found them all concerned about [LOC Iran  ] . 
They said it would helpful to resolve the [MISC Palestinian  ] issue , but Israel-Palestine is not the main threat to the region . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] , following a similar comment during his meeting with [PER CODEL Casey  ] , responded that there are no [MISC Arab  ] leaders who would tell the [LOC U.S.  ] to wait on [LOC Iran  ] until there is a settlement to the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] issue . 
[PER Ackerman  ] also explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] will try engagement in order to prevent an unwise and premature use of force . 
We will tighten sanctions at the same time , for which we need the support of the international community , [PER Ackerman  ] explained . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] noted that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] had said he would not stop [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
President [PER Obama  ] had been clear in his comments to [PER Netanyahu  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] engagement would be results-oriented and not open-ended . 
If engagement did not work , the [LOC U.S.  ] would gain the moral high ground , which would help make economic pressure more effective . 
[PER Ackerman  ] agreed that more pressure was needed and said we need to figure out what the [MISC Russians  ] and others want . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said that in contrast to [LOC North Korea  ] , the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear and missile programs were direct threats to [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] interests in the [LOC Gulf  ] , and he emphasized that the program was not defensive in nature . 
In response to a question from Representative [MISC Jackson-Lee  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] encouraged quick action on a bill in the [ORG Congress  ] to pressure foreign oil companies not to sell refined petroleum to [LOC Iran  ] . 
This might not be enough to stop [LOC Iran  ] 's program but it would send a strong signal . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] also urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] demand that [LOC Iran  ] stop all uranium enrichment since enrichment is the main element of their program . 
He commented that [LOC Iran  ] might try to use the talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] to continue or accelerate their enrichment process . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] cautioned that he was skeptical of the idea that the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership could change . 
They have a dangerous worldview , a violent theocracy , but it may be possible to move them if they find the [LOC U.S.  ] strong and determined . 
[LOC Iran  ] , he commented , is bent on becoming a global and not just a regional power. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) CODELS [PER Ackerman  ] and [PER Casey  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this message. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [ORG Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv ********************************************* ******************** CUNNINGHAM</pre></code>
