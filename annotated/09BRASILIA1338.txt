( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY:  ] The [MISC Brazilian  ] judicial and legislative branches are in the process of examining two key pharmaceutical patent-related issues - the role of the national health vigilance agency ( [ORG ANVISA  ] ) in reviewing pharmaceutical patent applications and the constitutionality of [LOC Brazil  ] 's pipeline patent system . 
There has been no resolution of a disagreement between the [MISC Brazilian  ] patent office ( [ORG INPI  ] ) and the [ORG Inter-Ministerial Intellectual Property Group  ] ( [ORG GIPI  ] ) regarding patents for polymorphs and second uses . 
In addition , [ORG INPI  ] 's stated reasoning for a recent patent denial ( lack of inventive step ) raises potential questions about the treatment of incrementally innovative pharmaceutical patent applications - though underlying political pressure to lower costs for [LOC Brazil  ] 's AIDS program may have been at work in that case . 
With [LOC Brazil  ] preparing for a major election in October 2010 , it is possible that no definitive action will be taken on these topics in the near future . 
END SUMMARY . 
JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE REVIEWS OF [ORG ANVISA  ] ROLE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Article  ] 229C of Law 9279/1996 ( [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG IP Law  ] ) requires [ORG ANVISA  ] 's " prior informed consent " before a pharmaceutical patent can be approved . 
In an October meeting with [MISC Econoff  ] , federal judge [PER Liliane Roriz  ] explained that there have been several federal court decisions in recent years regarding [ORG ANVISA  ] 's role in reviewing pharmaceutical patent applications . 
Two decisions in the first instance ruled against the intervention of [ORG ANVISA  ] in patentability criteria and two ruled for it . 
At the appellate level , one decision ( in which Judge [PER Roriz  ] participated ) ruled against [ORG ANVISA  ] 's intervention and the other found such intervention to be legal . 
Judge [PER Roriz  ] 's written opinion in the case , which she repeated to [MISC Econoff  ] , stated that [ORG ANVISA  ] should have , at most , a reference role in that [ORG ANVISA  ] has more comprehensive files regarding prior art for pharmaceutical inventions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) On November 6 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] attorney general ( as a result of a formal request brought by the [MISC Brazilian  ] patent office , [ORG INPI  ] ) issued an opinion ( [ORG No.  ] 210/PGF/AE/2009 ) ruling against [ORG ANVISA  ] 's current practice of reviewing patentability requirements . 
The opinion states that [ORG ANVISA  ] has the authority to examine patent applications only with regards to a public health perspective . 
According to the opinion , the patentability requirements of a pharmaceutical invention can only be examined by [ORG INPI  ] , since [ORG ANVISA  ] 's competency is limited to preventing the production and marketing of products and services potentially harmful to human health . 
The opinion has been presented for review to the office of the [MISC President.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Separately , the [MISC Brazilian  ] legislature is also examining [ORG ANVISA  ] 's role in reviewing pharmaceutical patent applications . 
Draft Law 3709 of 2008 ( currently pending review by the [ORG House of Representatives' Committee  ] on [ORG Economic Development  ] , Industry , and [ORG Commerce  ] ) would strike from [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG IP  ] law the requirement for [ORG ANVISA  ] 's prior consent on issuance of pharmaceutical patents . 
The written justification for Draft Law 3709 explains that Section 229C of the [ORG IP Law  ] , where it is stated that pharmaceutical patent approval shall depend on the prior consent of [ORG ANVISA  ] , was intended only to apply to pipeline patents - the direct subject of Sections 229-231. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] implemented the pipeline system as part of adopting the 1994 Agreement on [MISC Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  ] ( [ORG TRIPS  ] ) . 
Under the pipeline system [LOC Brazil  ] began recognizing in 1996 pharmaceutical patents that had been filed in other countries before [LOC Brazil  ] allowed such patents . 
Affected patents were recognized based on the date of first foreign filing , so long as the patent was approved in a foreign country , the patent subject matter was not previously marketed in [LOC Brazil  ] , and the application was filed within one year of the publication of the [ORG Intellectual Property Act of  ] 1996 . 
Such pipeline patents would expire on the date corresponding to their original foreign-issued patent or not more than 20 years from the date of their filing in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) On November 10 , [MISC Econoff  ] attended a public hearing at the [MISC Brazilian  ] Chamber of Deputies . 
Former Deputy [PER Ney Lopes  ] , who served as rapporteur for the law that introduced Section 229C , testified that the intention at the time was for the section to be limited in scope to pipeline patents . 
He said that the current application of Section 229C implies doubt of [ORG INPI  ] 's competency and needlessly duplicates work . 
Professor [PER Aluizo Borem  ] , representing the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG National Technical Committee  ] on Biosafety ( CTNBio ) , emphasized the long process for creating new drugs and treatments and argued that [LOC Brazil  ] should aim for a regulatory environment conducive to innovation . 
He argued that a plain reading of the [ORG IP Law  ] shows that Section 229C applied only to pipeline patent applications and that to require [ORG ANVISA  ] 's consent on non-pipeline patents serves only to add bureaucratic steps without legal justification or benefit to society . 
Deputy [PER Moreira Mendes  ] agreed that the requirement for [ORG ANVISA  ] 's prior consent is not well-grounded in the law , nor does it recognize the separate competencies of [ORG ANVISA  ] and [ORG INPI  ] . 
In making broader comments on patents and public interest , he pointed out that generics would not exist without the breakthroughs and investments of original drug manufacturers. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Celia Chaves  ] , President of the [ORG Brazilian National Federation of Pharmacists  ] ( [ORG FENAFAR  ] ) and representing the [ORG IP Working Group  ] of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Network for the Integration of [LOC All People  ] , argued that international standards and agreements confirm the primacy of public health over commercial interests . 
She said that Section 229C was not specific to pipeline patents and should be maintained in its entirety , since [ORG ANVISA  ] 's review is more rigorous than that of [ORG INPI  ] and is conducted with public health in mind . 
She decried the " delaying strategies " of brand-name drug makers and claimed that only 15% of drugs approved by the [ORG U.S. Food and Drug Administration  ] between 1989 and 2000 were " truly innovative . 
" The remainder , she argued , are for things like new salt forms or polymorphs of existing molecules , which are " not that hard " to create and " do not have new therapeutic benefits . 
" ( [MISC Note: This  ] statistic is drawn from a May 2002 report published by the [ORG U.S. National Institute for Health Care Management Research and Education  ] . 
The [ORG Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America [ PhRMA  ] ] issued a critique of this report noting that the referenced statistics arbitrarily exclude large numbers of medicines , specifically vaccines and biologics , and misuses the [ORG FDA  ] 's [ORG Priority Review Classification System  ] in assessing what drugs are innovative . 
End note . 
) As for the competencies of [ORG INPI  ] and [ORG ANVISA  ] , [PER Ms. Chaves  ] interpreted that Section 101 of the [ORG IP Law  ] , which defines the competency of [ORG INPI  ] , does not give [ORG INPI  ] exclusive dominion over patents. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Odinir Finotti  ] , President of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Generic Manufacturers Association  ] ( [ORG ProGenericos  ] ) , said that the generic industry wants to follow the law as it is written but that brand-name manufacturers are using deceptive strategies to extend the life of their patents , including pipeline patents . 
He argued that patents granted today would have no benefit for public health in [LOC Brazil  ] until their expiration in 20 years and that [LOC Brazil  ] is best served by maintaining [ORG ANVISA  ] 's review in order to be more cautious about the concession of patent rights. ---------------- PIPELINE PATENTS ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In April 2009 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] Attorney General submitted to the [ORG Federal Supreme Court  ] ( [ORG STF  ] ) a challenge to the constitutionality of the pipeline patent system . 
According to the Attorney General 's submission , inventions patented under the pipeline system did not meet the requirement for novelty since they were publicly released once the patent application was submitted outside of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [ORG STF  ] has not yet ruled on this case . 
Federal Judge [PER Roriz  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that she finds the case " ridiculous " and feels that it would not make sense to declare pipeline patents unconstitutional thirteen years after the measure was implemented . 
It is an indication of the weakness of the case , she says , that it took so long to bring a file to the [ORG STF  ] . 
10 . 
( U ) The [ORG STF  ] has not yet issued any opinions on the case. -------------------- VOICES IN THE DEBATE ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Post  ] has reported previously ( ref A ) that the [ORG Ministry of Exterior Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) and the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MOH  ] ) frequently argue that [MISC IP  ] protection is only one path ( and an optional one at that ) to innovation and economic development and that it must be balanced against the public interest . 
While the [ORG Ministry of Development  ] , Industry , and [ORG Commerce  ] ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) has seemed more willing to consider [MISC IP  ] protection as a key component of economic development , [ORG MDIC  ] 's Secretary of Industrial Technology [PER Francelino Grando  ] recently supported the [ORG MRE  ] and [ORG MOH  ] view during opening remarks at a November 5 seminar on [MISC IP  ] and Innovation hosted by the [ORG Brazilian Association of Fine Chemical Industries  ] ( [ORG ABIFINA  ] - an organization whose members include major [MISC Brazilian  ] generic drug manufacturers like [ORG Ache  ] , [LOC Eurofarma  ] , and [ORG EMS  ] ) . 
Secretary [PER Grando  ] stated that the GOB should resist international pressure for more concessions ( i.e . 
TRIPS-plus ) on [MISC IP  ] and underlined the legitimacy of subordinating patent policy to the interests of economic and social development. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) The [ORG ABIFINA  ] seminar was structured into three panels on the judicial , economic , and social aspects of intellectual property . 
The majority of the panelists focused on what they called the anti-competitive nature of pharmaceutical patents and the impact to society of decreased access to medications . 
One panelist , Professor [PER Bruno van Pottelsberghe  ] of the [ORG Free University of Brussels  ] , focused his presentation on the factors in various patent systems that affect the quality of approved patents ( which he found to be worst in the [ORG U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  ] ) , but he also pointed out that pharmaceutical companies take on tremendous financial investments and risks to develop and test new drugs . 
Unless governments are willing to take on that role themselves , he said , they must acknowledge the public interest in access to as-yet-undeveloped medicines. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [PER Ronaldo Fiani  ] , a professor of economics at the [ORG Federal University of Rio de Janeiro  ] , said there are two " myths " dominating the patent conversation - the myth that patents are " good monopolies " and the myth that [MISC IP  ] protection is an effective incentive for innovation . 
Professor [PER Fiani  ] expressed dismay that [LOC Brazil  ] 's own competition authority ( CADE ) has made public arguments for the benefits of the temporary monopoly granted by [MISC IP  ] protection . 
He went on to say that only technical capacity-building can promote innovation and that economists invented the myth of [MISC IP  ] protection as an incentive to innovate . 
Professor [PER van Pottelsberghe  ] responded that while some elements of the current patent system may be flawed , [MISC IP  ] protection is not a carrot enticing a horse to run , but rather the road itself . 
That is , [MISC IP  ] protection is a fundamental pre-condition for innovation and economic development. -------------POLYMORPHS AND SECOND-USE PATENTS ----------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) The December 2008 Inter-Ministerial Group on [ORG Intellectual Property  ] ( [ORG GIPI  ] ) decision against patentability of polymorphs and new medical indications of existing drugs ( second-use patents ) has yet to be implemented by a change in [LOC Brazil  ] 's patent law . 
[ORG INPI  ] tells [PER IPR Attach  ] that they continue to evaluate applications on a case-by-case basis , approving patent applications that meet the patentability requirements of novelty and inventive step . 
Draft Law 2511 of 2007 would amend the [MISC Brazilian  ] patent law to disallow second-use patents . 
The draft law has been awaiting consideration by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG House  ] of [ORG Representatives' Committee  ] on [ORG Economic Development  ] , Industry , and [ORG Commerce  ] since August 2009. ------------------------------- TENOFOVIR ------------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As reported previously ( ref B ) , the case of [LOC U.S.  ] pharmaceutical company [ORG Gilead  ] 's rejected patented application for the [MISC AIDS  ] drug tenofovir has raised concerns about [ORG INPI  ] 's stance on patents for incrementally innovative drugs . 
( [ORG Note: Gilead  ] has not yet filed a planned judicial appeal in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
End note . 
) A patent application for the same drug was refused by the [MISC Indian  ] patent office in September 2009 , based partly on pre-grant opposition filed by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC AIDS  ] advocacy group [MISC Brazilian  ] Interdisciplinary [ORG AIDS Association  ] ( [ORG ABIA  ] ) in cooperation with an [MISC Indian  ] [ORG NGO  ] . 
[ORG ABIA  ] 's opposition filing stated that a patent in [LOC India  ] would have a direct impact on the ability of [LOC Brazil  ] to produce and access generic versions of tenofovir. -------------------------------- COMMENT ------------------------------------------ <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The issues surrounding patents for pharmaceutical products are unlikely to be resolved during the lead-up to the October 2010 elections . 
With the media and elite 's attention focused on the campaigns for president , all 26 state governors , two-thirds of the [ORG Senate  ] , and all federal deputies , [ORG Post  ] expects that action in most controversial areas will be stalled until after a new government is in place in January 2011 . 
President [PER Lula  ] 's [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001338 004 OF 004 sustained popularity is largely based on his personal connection with the country 's lower classes and his party ( with current Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] as its presidential candidate ) will not want to jeopardize that populist touch . 
Given the popularly-held belief that pharmaceutical patents benefit multi-national drug companies at the expense of the [MISC Brazilian  ] public , reforms to strengthen [LOC Brazil  ] 's patent system are not vote-winners and therefore are unlikely to be pursued over the next twelve months .
