( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
EGIS Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] told Ambassador and a visiting [PER Codel  ] led by Senator [PER George Voinovich December  ] 31 that he is optimistic progress will be made on [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] negotiations . 
However , [PER Soliman  ] was concerned with continuing [MISC Israeli  ] criticism of [MISC Egyptian  ] anti-smuggling efforts . 
He was worried that the [MISC Egyptians  ] would not be able to work out an arrangement with the [MISC Israelis  ] for [MISC Hajj  ] pilgrims to return to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Soliman  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] 's release of the [ORG National Intelligence Estimate  ] had altered the calculus through which [MISC Arab  ] states are interacting with [LOC Iran  ] . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] argued that the [MISC Iraqi  ] government needed to amend its constitution and that Prime Minister [PER Malaki  ] should not deal with the [MISC Iraqi  ] people in a " sectarian way . 
" End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] led off the [MISC New Year  ] 's Eve meeting by telling the [PER Codel  ] that the region is at a special , critical juncture . 
[LOC Egypt  ] is [LOC America  ] 's partner . 
Sometimes we have our differences . 
But [LOC Egypt  ] will continue to provide the [ORG USG  ] with its knowledge and expertise on the critical regional issues , such as [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict remains the core issue ; [PER Soliman  ] contended a peaceful resolution would be a " big blow " to terrorist organizations that use the conflict as a pretext . 
For this reason , President [PER Mubarak  ] is committed to ending the [MISC Israeli-Arab  ] " stalemate . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] applauded the [ORG Administration  ] 's efforts , commenting that [LOC Annapolis  ] had given hope and begun a process . 
The timing is right for progress based on four factors . 
First , the [ORG PA  ] leadership is moderate and willing to negotiate . 
Second , [ORG Hamas  ] is isolated and politically cut off in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Third , the [MISC Israelis  ] are ready for peace ; [PER Soliman  ] assessed that the GOI coalition is broad and strong , and larger than [PER Rabin  ] 's coalition of the mid-nineties . 
Fourth , [MISC Arab  ] states are ready to see an end to " the struggle . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Soliman  ] stressed that [LOC Egypt  ] stands ready to help the [LOC U.S.  ] effort . 
The [ORG GOE  ] knows both the [MISC Palestinians  ] and the [MISC Israelis  ] , and knows the obstacles to peace . 
[PER Soliman  ] recommended two steps be taken . 
First , both the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] must be pressed hard to sign an agreement , which the [LOC U.S.  ] and international community could endorse , to be implemented at the proper time . 
Second , the [LOC U.S.  ] should insist that " phase one " of the [MISC Roadmap  ] should be completed before the end of 2008. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] Conflict: [PER Soliman  ] opined that the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] was ready to sign an agreement , but that establishment of a state may take between 1-3 years . 
While [ORG Hamas  ] is isolated politically and unable to stop an [MISC Israeli-PA  ] agreement , it remains entrenched in [LOC Gaza  ] , and it was unclear to [PER Soliman  ] how long that would last . 
At one point in the discussion , [PER Soliman  ] seemed to imply [ORG Hamas  ] may remain in control of [LOC Gaza  ] for more than a year ; at another juncture , he told Senator [PER Voinovich  ] that if negotiations proceeded briskly , [ORG Hamas  ] may be forced to cede power in [LOC Gaza  ] in 3-4 months . 
The bottom line for [ORG Hamas  ] , according to [PER Soliman  ] , is that they must be forced to choose between remaining a resistance movement or joining the political process . 
They cannot have it both ways , he said. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Palestinian  ] training: [PER Soliman  ] reiterated [ORG GOE  ] willingness to train and support [MISC Palestinian  ] security forces . 
He claimed that the [ORG GOE  ] had training facilities ready , but that he was waiting for an answer from [ORG U.S. Security Coordinator  ] General [PER Keith Dayton  ] . 
( Note: We have advised [PER Soliman  ] that initial training of [MISC Palestinian  ] security forces will take place in [LOC Jordan  ] , and that we will revisit the option of training in [LOC Egypt  ] this spring . 
End note ) . 
He continued that the [ORG GOE  ] would keep pressure on [ORG Hamas  ] but will maintain " low-level " contacts with [ORG Hamas  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] , he said , wants [ORG Hamas  ] isolated . 
The [MISC Qassam  ] rocket attacks must stop . 
When they do stop , the [ORG GOE  ] will ask [LOC Israel  ] to " meet quiet with quiet . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Border issues: Senator [PER Voinovich  ] asked [PER Soliman  ] why the [MISC Israelis  ] continue to report problems with [LOC Egypt  ] 's anti-smuggling efforts . 
[PER Soliman  ] said that the [MISC Israelis  ] do not complain to him directly , and that [MISC GOI-GOE  ] cooperation and exchange of information continues . 
He was at a loss as to why [MISC Israeli  ] politicians continue to criticize [LOC Egypt  ] publicly . 
The [ORG GOE  ] would like the [ORG USG  ] to be included in the [MISC GOI-GOE  ] LAWIO discussions , but the [MISC Israelis  ] continue to object . 
" They don't want a witness in the room , " [PER Soliman  ] said . 
Nevertheless , [PER Soliman  ] was willing to turn the page . 
" We have a short time to reach peace . 
We need it . 
We need to wake up in the morning with no news of terrorism , no explosions , and no news of more deaths . 
We want everyone happy . 
That is the [MISC Egyptian  ] dream . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Syria: Congressman Turner asked if [LOC Iran  ] and/or [LOC Syria  ] might be play a spoiler role . 
[PER Soliman  ] answered that [LOC Syria  ] wants desperately to halt the [ORG United Nations  ] special tribunal on the [PER Hariri  ] assassination . 
At the same time , the SARG is ready to negotiate with the [MISC Israelis  ] , and [PER Soliman  ] believed that the GOI also is ready . 
[LOC Syria  ] , [PER Soliman  ] said , can be induced to play a constructive role but added that there are no guarantees , however , on [MISC Syrian  ] performance. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) NIE: Regarding the [ORG USG  ] 's [ORG National Intelligence Estimate of Iran  ] 's nuclear program , [PER Soliman  ] was concerned that many in the [MISC Arab  ] world were recalculating their position vis a vis [LOC Iran  ] based on an assumption that the [ORG NIE  ] represented a [ORG USG  ] policy shift . 
[PER Soliman  ] said the [MISC Egyptians  ] are working to correct this misimpression among [MISC Arab  ] states . 
" We tell the [MISC Arab  ] world: Don't be happy with the [ORG NIE  ] and don't warm up to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We know that the [LOC United States  ] will never allow [LOC Iran  ] to have a nuclear bomb . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Iran: Soliman  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] remains a significant threat to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
It continues to influence Shiaa in [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] is supporting Jihad and spoiling peace , and has supported extremists in [LOC Egypt  ] previously . 
If they were to support the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] this would make them " our enemy , " he said . 
The [ORG GOE  ] continues to press the [MISC Iranian  ] regime to turn over extremists given " safe harbor " in [LOC Iran  ] . 
This issue , he said , will remain an obstacle to improving [MISC Egyptian-Iranian  ] relations . 
( [PER Soliman  ] met with [MISC Iranian  ] former nuclear negotiator [PER Ali Larijani  ] earlier in the week . 
[PER Larijani  ] was in [LOC Egypt  ] on a week-long " private visit . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Iraq: Soliman  ] said he remains concerned that the [MISC Maliki  ] government in [LOC Iraq  ] is not representing all [MISC Iraqis  ] ( i.e. the [MISC Sunni  ] population ) . 
The [ORG GOE  ] has urged [MISC Maliki  ] not to deal with the [MISC Iraqi  ] people in a sectarian way , and to amend to constitution to allow greater [MISC Sunni  ] representation . 
In addition , the [MISC Iraqi  ] government must remove militias from the ranks of the army and police . 
In the long run , [PER Soliman  ] did not think that the decrease in violence would be sustainable absent these two steps . 
In addition , [MISC Iranian  ] influence is problematic . 
[PER Soliman  ] said that the [ORG GOE  ] had worked to reconcile 21 clans and tribes in [LOC Iraq  ] , with good results , and that this kind of efforts had to continue . 
He assessed that both [PER Sistani  ] and [PER Sadr  ] were practical men , and able to be dealt with. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Delegation  ] composition: Senator [PER George Voinovich  ] ( [LOC R-OH  ] ) Congressman [PER Mike Turner  ] ( [LOC R-OH  ] ) Congressman [PER Steve Pearce  ] ( R-NM ) Congressman [PER Rob Bishop  ] ( [MISC R-UT  ] ) Congressman [PER Phil Gingrey  ] ( [ORG R-GA  ] ) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The delegation did not clear this message .
