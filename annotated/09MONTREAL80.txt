( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
On March 9 , 2009 the [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] ( [ORG ICAO  ] ) [ORG Council  ] , which is the governing body constituted of 36 representatives of [MISC ICAO Contracting States  ] from all regions of the world , discussed the [ORG DPRK  ] announcement that [LOC North Korea  ] cannot guarantee the safety of [MISC South Korean  ] flights transiting [MISC No Korean  ] - controlled airspace and other [ORG DPRK  ] actions that pose a threat to global aviation security . 
The [ORG ROKG  ] 's newly arrived [ORG Council  ] Representative , Ambassador [PER Chong Hoon KIM  ] raised several points with the [ORG Council  ] and the [ORG Council President  ] at the 9 March 2009 [ORG Council  ] meeting , noting that the authorities of the [ORG DPRK  ] , the [ORG Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea  ] , had declared that quote safety could not be guaranteed for the [LOC Republic of Korea  ] 's civilian airplanes flying through the airspace of the [ORG DPRK  ] and its vicinity - end [ORG DPRK  ] quote . 
Ambassador [PER Kim  ] said this announcement constitutes an unacceptable threat to the safety and security of international civil aviation . 
He added that the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Korea  ] expresses its deep concern on the [ORG DPRK  ] 's announcement and requests the [ORG DPRK  ] to withdraw the declaration . 
[PER Kim  ] said the [ORG DPRK  ] , as a Contracting State of [ORG ICAO  ] , should act strictly in accordance with the [ORG Chicago Convention  ] , its Annexes and its procedures . 
Ambassador [PER Kim  ] noted that [ORG DPRK  ] actions violate the terms of a [MISC Memo of Understanding  ] signed between the two [MISC Koreas  ] and the President of [ORG ICAO Council  ] in October 1997 which permits the use by any State of air routes between [MISC DPRK-controlled  ] airspace and [MISC ROKG-controlled  ] airspace . 
That MOU had enabled 5260 flights to pass through [ORG DPRK  ] 's territorial airspace last year and in period January-February 2009 , 1020 flights have used the airspace , of which 463 were flights from the [ORG ROKG  ] and 557 from other [MISC States  ] . 
The [ORG DPRK  ] 's recent actions had obliged carriers from many [MISC ICAO Contracting States  ] to re-route flights . 
Finally , as these events have caused serious concern for the international aviation community , the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Korea  ] requested the [ORG ICAO Council  ] to direct the President of [ORG Council  ] to convey the grave concern of the [ORG Council  ] to the [ORG DPRK  ] . 
The [LOC US  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , and 26 other [ORG Council  ] members all spoke in support of the [ORG ROKG  ] request . 
Discussion was held in open [ORG Council  ] session . 
The [ORG Council  ] took a Decision relating to [LOC North Korea  ] and calling upon the [ORG DPRK  ] to meet its commitment to the safety and security of civil aircraft and other principles of the [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] ( [ORG ICAO  ] ) . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Acting [LOC US  ] Rep stated in [ORG Council  ] that: The [LOC U.S.  ] agrees that the [ORG DPRK  ] announcement that [LOC North Korea  ] cannot guarantee the safety of [MISC South Korean  ] flights transiting [LOC North Korean-controlled  ] airspace constitutes a clear threat to the safety and security of international civil aviation and global commerce. --The [ORG DPRK  ] actions are posing risk to the commercial carriers of numerous [MISC States  ] , many of which have been forced to re-route flights. --The [ORG DPRK  ] statements have generated serious concern in the international civil aviation community and call into question [LOC North Korea  ] 's commitment to the safety and security of civil aircraft and other principles of the [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other [ORG Council  ] members expressed support for the [ORG ROKG  ] statement and for Ambassador [PER Kim  ] 's request the [ORG Council President  ] , [PER Roberto Kobeh  ] , to convey the grave concern of the [ORG ICAO Council  ] as soon as possible to senior officials of the [ORG ROKG  ] . 
The 28 [MISC States  ] supporting [ORG ROKG  ] were [LOC US  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC MONTREAL  ] 00000080 002 OF 002 [LOC Cameroon  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Singapore  ] , [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Uganda  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Namibia  ] , [LOC Ghana  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Malaysia  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , [LOC El Salvador  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Due to the lateness of the day ( the [LOC Korea  ] topic was the last item of session ) , President [PER Kobeh  ] cut off debate . 
Only [LOC Egypt  ] made a nuanced statement of support by noting with emphasis that it is an obligation of ALL , repeat all , [MISC ICAO Contracting States  ] to respect the obligations of the [ORG Chicago Convention  ] ( [ORG ICAO  ] 's founding treaty ) . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's nuanced comment is effectively an unspoken reference to [LOC Israel  ] . 
There were no [ORG Council  ] members who spoke differently or expressed any reservations to the strong consensus of the [ORG ICAO Council.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The text of the [ORG Council  ] decision ( to be formalized in all six [ORG ICAO  ] languages in a few days ) will be available as soon as President [PER Kobeh  ] circulates a draft decision . 
[PER Kobeh  ] will refine the DRAFT overnight . 
The [ORG Council Decision  ] will be drawn from the comments of Ambassador [PER Kim  ] , the Acting [LOC U.S.  ] Representative and the [LOC Japan  ] Representative .
