( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
Recent [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] government scholarship programs for [MISC Surinamese  ] students have fallen short of their targets . 
This academic year , eight of eleven Surinamers with [MISC Venezuelan  ] scholarships quit their programs , while two of five Surinamers with [MISC Chinese  ] scholarships quit their programs . 
In contrast with the [MISC Venezuelans  ] and the [MISC Chinese  ] , the [MISC Cuban  ] government 's scholarship program continues to go strong with 60 participants , according to media reports . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On March 16 , [ORG De Ware Tijd  ] ( the newspaper of record ) broke the story that eight of eleven [MISC Surinamese  ] students studying medicine in [LOC Venezuela  ] had quit their programs . 
The media quoted [LOC Suriname  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Samuel Pawironadi  ] , as stating that the Embassy of the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] had directly advertised these scholarships in the [MISC Surinamese  ] press without coordination with [LOC Suriname  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Education  ] . 
The [MISC Surinamese  ] Embassy in [LOC Venezuela  ] worked closely with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government once the problems came to light in order to ensure the remaining three students would have an enjoyable stay , the media reported. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In December 2008 , Post 's EducationUSA advisor counseled two of the returning students . 
One student told her the [MISC Venezuelan  ] program was disorganized . 
Although the advertisement said it was a medical school scholarship , when the students arrived in [LOC Venezuela  ] the medical school had not yet been built . 
Instead , the students were sent to learn [MISC Spanish  ] in a village on the [MISC Venezuelan-Guyanese  ] border . 
The student reported that the room and board provided was substandard , and that he became ill before returning to [LOC Suriname  ] . 
Later , the EducationUSA advisor learned this student received a scholarship to finish his studies in the [LOC Netherlands.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The March 16 news report came on the heels of a January 22 [ORG De Ware Tijd  ] article , which had reported that two Surinamers who had received scholarships to study in [LOC Beijing  ] had also quit their programs and returned to [LOC Suriname  ] . 
Originally , there were five students sent to [LOC China  ] last fall , according to a public statement by [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador to [LOC Suriname  ] [PER Su Ge  ] on [LOC China  ] 's [ORG National Day  ] . 
These scholarships had been coordinated by [LOC Suriname  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Education  ] . 
Post 's EducationUSA advisor spoke with [PER Richel Najatirta  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] , who is in charge of scholarship programs . 
[PER Najatirta  ] advised that this scholarship program involved cost-sharing with the [MISC Chinese  ] government covering room , board , and tuition for the students while the [MISC Surinamese  ] government covered the roundtrip airfare . 
[PER Najatirta  ] confirmed that the [ORG Ministry  ] is currently in dispute with the two students because they returned to [LOC Suriname  ] without notifying the [ORG Ministry  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] is requesting the students reimburse the [ORG Ministry  ] the airfare costs. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) In contrast with the [MISC Venezuelans  ] and the [MISC Chinese  ] , the [MISC Cuban  ] government 's scholarship program appeared to be going strong this academic year . 
On December 8 , 2008 , the [ORG De Ware Tijd  ] reported that sixty [MISC Surinamese  ] students were studying in [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
Post 's EducationUSA advisor has noted that many of the students who come to the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy for academic counseling are looking for scholarship opportunities . 
With the comparatively high cost of studying in the [LOC United States  ] , combined with scholarship programs offered by other countries' governments , it is hard to attract [MISC Surinamese  ] students to the [LOC United States  ] at the undergraduate level , especially when the [LOC United States  ] rarely offers to pay . 
Post is researching imaginative methods to attract [MISC Surinamese  ] students , including access to [PER Fulbright  ] and [PER Humphrey  ] scholarship programs , but still is unlikely to be able to fully compete with the apparently deep pockets of the [MISC Venezuelans  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] , or the [MISC Cubans  ] .
