( C ) Summary . 
[PER Charles Ble Goude  ] , leader of [ORG COJEP  ] ( [ORG PanAfrican Congress  ] of [ORG Young Patriots  ] ) , is one of three [MISC Ivorians  ] under [ORG United Nations  ] ( [ORG UN  ] ) [ORG Security Council  ] sanctions . 
However , an offensive seems to be underway , bolstered by the presidential camp , to re-shape [PER Ble Goude  ] 's public image and portray him as a future statesman . 
[PER Ble Goude  ] 's transformation began with his national tour in 2007 to promote reconciliation . 
He has gained prominence recently by launching a foundation that provides skills training and employment for youth . 
All indications are that President [PER Gbagbo  ] and some of his closest advisors continue to embrace this divisive and controversial figure . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Ble Goude  ] was placed under [ORG UN  ] sanctions on February 7 , 2006 for repeated public statements advocating violence against [ORG UN  ] installations , [ORG UN  ] personnel , and foreigners , as well as directing and participating in acts of violence by street militias , including beatings , rapes , and extrajudicial killings . 
The [ORG UN  ] determined that he intimidated the [ORG UN  ] , the [ORG International Working Group  ] ( [ORG IWG  ] ) , the political opposition , and the independent press and sabotaged international radio stations . 
The [ORG UN  ] also found that he was an obstacle to the action of the [ORG IWG  ] , the [ORG United Nations Operation  ] in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] ( [LOC UNOCI  ] ) , the [MISC French  ] forces , and the peace process as defined by resolution 1643 of 2005. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ble Goude  ] kept a low profile for some time after sanctions were imposed but has , since last year , undertaken actions to transform his public image from leader of an armed militia to statesman . 
He has been very visible in the media in the last three months in what appears to be a charm offensive to demonstrate to the [MISC Ivoiran  ] public that he is a serious political actor . 
He has conducted press interviews and his second book is scheduled to be released during the month of June . 
According to the [MISC French  ] Embassy , [PER Ble Goude  ] has become a wealthy businessman , with substantial holdings in hotels , nightclubs , restaurants , gas stations , and real estate in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
[MISC French  ] Emboff told us that [PER Ble Goude  ] requires payment for all activities he undertakes on behalf of the Presidency and the [ORG FPI  ] governing party. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Ble Goude  ] began his political career in the Student Federation of [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] ( [ORG FESCI  ] ) , rising through the ranks to succeed current Prime Minister [PER Soro  ] as [ORG FESCI  ] 's Secretary General from 1998 to 2000 . 
In 2001 , he founded [ORG COJEP  ] ( the [ORG Pan African Congress  ] of [ORG Young Patriots  ] ) which he continues to lead . 
[PER Ble Goude  ] started his public transformation by casting himself as a peacemaker and conciliator when he launched a " peace caravan " in 2007 . 
Over the course of 3 months , he visited 45 towns throughout the country , spreading the theme of reconciliation between rebel and government supporters . 
Although many observers doubted and continue to doubt his sincerity , [PER Ble Goude  ] evidently delivered a consistent message of peace and reconciliation in his speeches to the youth. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) His newest venture is the launching of a " Forum of Information and Orientation " that will provide skills training and find jobs for 200 youth . 
Minister of [ORG National Reconciliation Sebastien Dano Djedje  ] , a member of the President 's [ORG FPI  ] party , delivered a speech at the project 's March 14 launching ceremony . 
According to [PER Ble Goude  ] , 12,000 young people contacted his Forum seeking to be selected . 
Minister for Planning and Development [PER Paul-Antoine Bohoun Bouabre  ] , also an [ORG FPI  ] member , publicly presented [PER Ble Goude  ] with a check for 5 million [PER CFA  ] ( USD 12,000 ) to support this project . 
[PER Ble Goude  ] 's forum was covered on national TV and interviews with him were run several times. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The June 6 edition of the government 's newspaper , " [PER Fraternite Matin  ] , " featured an interview with [PER Ble Goude  ] photographed in a suit and tie . 
[PER Ble Goude  ] said he launched his Forum because as head of a youth movement , he has an obligation to guide the country 's youth . 
He lamented that [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] 's moral fiber has weakened , leading people to seek shortcuts around the law and to take into account only those with financial means . 
Asked by his interviewer to comment on the arrest of [ORG DRC  ] rebel leader [PER Jean-Pierre Bemba  ] , [PER Ble Goude  ] responded that one is never a rebel for life , adding that either one becomes a member of society or ends up like [PER Charles Taylor  ] or [PER Jean-Pierre Bemba  ] or [PER Jonas Savimbi.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While [PER Ble  ] [PER Goude  ] does not seem to have the following he commanded several years ago , he still has his [ORG COJEP  ] faithful that he could mobilize . 
He also maintains a strong influence over [ORG FESCI  ] . 
[PER Konan Bertin Kouadio  ] , President of the [ORG Youth Section  ] of opposition political party [ORG PDCI  ] , told Poloffs June 10 that [PER Ble Goude  ] cannot organize the demonstrations and disturbances that he carried out several years ago , but that a large number of youth would still take to the streets if he gave the order . 
RDR Youth Section head [PER Yayoro Karamokotel  ] told [PER Poloff  ] that [ORG Ble Goude  ] is [PER Gbagbo  ] 's youth campaign manager . 
Skepticism about whether [PER Ble Goude  ] is genuinely committed to peaceful political dialogue remains quite high. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment . 
President [PER Gbagbo  ] has repeatedly asked the [ORG UN  ] to lift sanctions against [ORG Ble  ] [PER Goude  ] and reportedly remains one of his strongest supporters , along with [PER Simone Gbagbo  ] . 
The choice of [ORG Ble Goude  ] as youth campaign manager is clever because the charismatic [ORG Ble Goude  ] can easily motivate and mobilize . 
It is disturbing , however , that [PER Gbagbo  ] 's camp seems to be grooming [PER Ble Goude  ] for future positions in the party and/or the government rather than distancing itself from someone who remains under [ORG UN  ] sanctions and who is still a divisive and controversial figure at home . 
Embassy contacts seem convinced that the government is financing the bulk of [PER Ble Goude  ] 's activities , which raises concerns about [PER Gbagbo  ] 's genuine commitment to implementation of the [ORG Ouagadougou Political Agreement  ] ( [ORG OPA  ] ) . 
The government can finance [PER Ble Goude  ] 's jobs for youth initiative , but states it lacks the funds for the civic service program for ex-combatants , which is an integral part of the [ORG OPA  ] . 
It appears that [ORG Ble Goude  ] is succeeding in his effort to re-define himself to the [MISC Ivorian  ] public , but whether his actions will eventually bear out his new image remains to be seen .
