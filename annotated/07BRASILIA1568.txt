Concern for Democracy on the Continent <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senator [PER Fortes  ] ( [MISC Democrat  ] , from [LOC Piaui  ] state ) , chairman of the [ORG Senate Foreign Relations  ] and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] , over lunch with the Ambassador and three staffers from the [ORG House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee  ] on [ORG Western Hemisphere Affairs  ] on August 8 , said he has concerns about threats to democracy on the [MISC South American  ] continent . 
Twenty-five years ago there were many dictatorships , some stronger , some weaker . 
Now , the continent is ruled by democratic governments , some stronger , some weaker , he explained . 
The continent cannot afford to go back to dictatorship , which is why he calls for greater understanding of the importance of defending democracy . 
He stressed that [PER Mercosul  ] , a bloc whose purpose is in part to safeguard democracy , is right to create barriers to entry into it by states that would not safeguard democracy , adding that he did not see how [PER Mercosul  ] could be considered a threat to anyone . 
( [PER Fortes  ] repeated comments along these lines in brief remarks at a dinner with the Ambassador and nine other senators , septel ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] said the [ORG USG  ] is very supportive of any organization that can bring the region together and we are also supportive of any organization that can bring the hemisphere together. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to a question from a [ORG House WHA Subcommittee  ] staffer , Senator [PER Fortes  ] expressed strong concerns about [PER Hugo Chavez  ] 's government . 
He recalled that [PER Chavez  ] had initially taken steps against the judiciary and legislature in [LOC Venezuela  ] , and had increasingly taken away freedom of the press . 
He said that [PER Chavez  ] alone did not constitute a threat to regional stability , but in concert with [PER Evo Morales  ] of [LOC Bolivia  ] and their attempts to expand their ideology in the region , the situation is worrisome . 
He said he understood that [PER Hugo Chavez  ] is supporting and financing a candidate for president of [LOC Paraguay  ] who would , if elected , deport [MISC Brazilian  ] nationals working in agriculture areas in [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] has not changed social conditions in [LOC Venezuela  ] , Sen. [PER Fortes  ] continued , but what he is doing is an international " blocking " effort for his own benefit . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] Accession to [PER Mercosul  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chavez  ] had been irritated by the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] 's resolution on the [ORG RCTV  ] matter , and because he has an " explosive " nature , [PER Fortes  ] said , [PER Chavez  ] had made a commitment to win entry to [PER Mercosul  ] within 60 days . 
But there are two clauses in the [LOC Mercosul Charter  ] that could block [MISC Venezuelans  ] accession , [PER Fortes  ] said , one on taxes , the other concerning democracy . 
So [PER Chavez  ] threw the problem on [LOC Brazil  ] , which leaves [LOC Brazil  ] with two alternatives , [PER Fortes  ] said . 
The first alternative is to have [ORG Congress  ] approve [LOC Venezuela  ] 's full accession then let accession itself be [PER Chavez  ] 's problem , including coming into compliance with all the requirements for full accession . 
The other is to deny [MISC Venezuelan  ] accession and make [PER Chavez  ] a victim and martyr . 
[PER Fortes  ] seemed to favor approving [MISC Venezuelan  ] accession , thereby handing [PER Chavez  ] a big problem to resolve . 
He said the [ORG Senate  ] still must debate the bill on [MISC Venezuelan  ] accession to [PER Mercosul  ] . 
( Note: In a session with the [ORG House WHA Subcommittee  ] staffers later that afternoon , [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] staff expressed no similar qualms regarding [MISC Venezuelan  ] accession , saying that in inviting [LOC Venezuela  ] to join , member governments have effectively approved accession .
