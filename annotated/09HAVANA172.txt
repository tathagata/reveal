( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: On 9 March 2009 , the [LOC United States  ] Coast Guard [ORG Drug Interdiction Specialist  ] ( [ORG DIS  ] ) stationed at the [LOC United States  ] Interests Section in [LOC Havana  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG USINT  ] ) attended a routine working meeting with [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MININT  ] ) officers , including one [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Border Guard Colonel  ] ( [ORG COL  ] ) and two officers from the [ORG MININT Directorate of International Relations  ] ( one Lieutenant Colonel ( [ORG LTCOL  ] ) and a Major ( [ORG MAJ  ] ) ) . 
All three officers are regular [ORG DIS  ] contacts with whom he has met approximately thirty times since the [ORG DIS  ] 's arrival in country in August 2008 , including two multi-day law enforcement-related excursions . 
Topics discussed on 9 March included a recent marijuana wash-up in [LOC Holguin Province  ] , and suspected migrant smugglers currently being detained by the Government of [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On 9 March , the [ORG DIS  ] received four requests for information from [ORG MININT  ] . 
Of note was a request on forty-five subjects suspected of being involved in organized [MISC Cuban  ] migrant smuggling and currently being detained in [LOC Cuba  ] , and a recent marijuana wash-up on [LOC Cuba  ] 's north coast in [LOC Holguin Province  ] . 
Following the working portion of the meeting , the [ORG DIS  ] was asked by the [ORG MININT  ] [ORG MAJ  ] whether he believed the proposed legislation in the [LOC U.S.  ] congress that would permit [MISC Cuban  ] [MISC Americans  ] to travel to [LOC Cuba  ] more frequently would pass . 
Attempting to gauge the current readiness level of the [MISC Cuban  ] economy for increased tourism , [ORG DIS  ] in-turn asked the officers whether [LOC Cuba  ] was ready for an increased flow of [MISC American  ] tourists , to which the [ORG COL  ] responded that [LOC Cuba  ] was never averse to [MISC Americans  ] traveling to [LOC Cuba  ] ; rather , it was a policy initiated and brought on by the [LOC United States  ] , not [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The meeting ended a few moments later , and the [ORG DIS  ] departed the [ORG MININT  ] protocol house. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After departing , [ORG DIS  ] , [ORG LTCOL  ] , and [ORG MAJ  ] initiated a side-bar conversation and the [ORG DIS  ] once again asked ( and clarified his earlier travel-related question ) whether or not [LOC Cuba  ] was prepared for a significant influx of [MISC American  ] tourists should policy permit such a change . 
The [ORG MAJ  ] was quick to respond in the negative and pointed out that [MISC Cuban  ] airports were not prepared to accommodate a large influx . 
The [ORG LTCOL  ] stated that should maritime ports be utilized for ferries or cruises , they too are not prepared or equipped to handle an increase in passengers and the logistics that accompany them . 
Both agreed that this will require a significant amount of time to rectify . 
While the [ORG LTCOL  ] appeared optimistic that this issue was one that would be improved , the [ORG MAJ  ] was visibly frustrated with the issue ; he stated that [LOC Cuba  ] has previously prepared for an increased flow of [MISC Americans  ] only to have the [LOC United States  ] government turn around and prohibit travel to the island. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG DIS  ] told both officers that an increase in [MISC American  ] travel to [LOC Cuba  ] would bring about a litany of issues , including matters that will have to be handled by [ORG USINT  ] 's [ORG American Citizen Services  ] section as well as [MISC Cuban  ] and [LOC US  ] law enforcement agencies . 
[ORG DIS  ] stated that the [ORG GOC  ] may have to work more closely with such agencies as the [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration  ] , [ORG Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ] , [ORG U.S. Marshals Service  ] , and the [ORG Federal Bureau of Investigation  ] . 
Immediately following this statement , the [ORG MAJ  ] stated , in an agreeable fashion , that the [ORG GOC  ] will also have to work with the [ORG Central Intelligence Agency  ] on matters related to terrorism. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG DIS  ] used this line of conversation as a segue to float the idea of greater [ORG USINT Regional Security Officer  ] ( [ORG RSO  ] ) involvement in law enforcement issues as opposed to the [ORG DIS  ] handling nearly all exchanges . 
Both [ORG MININT  ] officers were amenable to the idea and stated that they are willing to work with the current [ORG USINT RSO  ] on law enforcement-related matters . 
The [ORG MAJ  ] stated that increased law enforcement cooperation outside the bounds of the existing [MISC MININT-DIS  ] relationship will inevitably push both sides into a position where they are forced to work together on mutually-concerning issues , thereby opening the door to other forms of collaboration. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG DIS  ] asked what it would take to setup a meeting among [ORG MININT  ] , [ORG DIS  ] , and [ORG RSO  ] , and the [ORG MAJ  ] stated that a diplomatic note should be sent to the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] ( [ORG MINREX  ] ) to request said meeting . 
The side-bar concluded after approximately thirty minutes. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [ORG MININT  ] and [ORG MINREX  ] ( during [MISC Cuban  ] migrant repatriations ) continue to bombard the [ORG DIS  ] with statements encouraging the [LOC United States  ] to cooperate on matters related to law enforcement , specifically counternarcotics and illegal migration . 
Most , if not all , migrant repatriations bring the [ORG DIS  ] into direct contact with an official from [ORG MINREX  ] 's [MISC North American Division  ] . 
[ORG MINREX  ] officers inevitably raise the need for greater dialogue between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , and seem to believe that counternarcotics and migration issues are a viable , potential conduit for increased [MISC U.S.-Cuba  ] collaboration . 
[ORG DIS  ] believes this continued LE cooperation message from the [ORG GOC  ] to the [ORG DIS  ] is part of a concerted effort to increase dialogue with the [LOC United States  ] via an already established working-level relationship .
