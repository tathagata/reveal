[MISC Pakistani  ] military operations in the [ORG FATA  ] are perceived as initiated by the [LOC U.S.  ] or policies viewed by some as anti-Islamic are often blamed on [LOC U.S.  ] influence. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B .

( S ) Macro Conflict Conditions <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
Yes . 
Elements of the [ORG Taliban  ] and [ORG Al-Qaida  ] fighting in [LOC Afghanistan  ] use sites in the [ORG NWFP  ] and the [ORG FATA  ] for training , rest , and recuperation . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] have used the [ORG NWFP  ] and the [ORG FATA  ] to stage attacks into [LOC Afghanistan  ] and have also initiated attacks on the [ORG Pakistan Military  ] and Government in both the Settled areas and the Tribal areas . 
Elements sympathetic to the [ORG Taliban  ] have attacked [MISC GOP  ] buildings , officials , citizens and [MISC Western-associated  ] enterprises and personnel inside [LOC Peshawar  ] , often as retaliation for [MISC GOP  ] efforts to stop [ORG Taliban  ] and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] activities . 
The [ORG Pakistani Military  ] has engaged in clashes with [ORG Taliban  ] elements inside the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] and local Police have engaged with militants within the confines of downtown [LOC Peshawar  ] . 
The [ORG NWFP  ] and the [ORG FATA  ] have seen frequent instances of sectarian violence between [LOC Shi'a  ] and [MISC Sunni  ] elements , most notably in [LOC Peshawar  ] ( two bombings of [LOC Shi'a  ] mosques in the [LOC Old City  ] during the [MISC Muharram Holiday  ] ) ; Sectarian violence has taken place in [LOC Swat  ] , [LOC Bannu  ] , Kurram Tribal area and the [ORG NWFP  ] 's [PER D.I. Khan  ] area. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
The conflicts mentioned above have taken place mostly in the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] to include the " settled areas " , which are adjacent to the [ORG FATA  ] . 
Almost every [ORG FATA Agency  ] has been effected by the above mentioned conflicts . 
Heavily effected areas include Tank , [PER D.I. Khan  ] , [LOC Bannu  ] , [LOC Swat  ] , [LOC Mohmand  ] , [LOC Hangu  ] and [LOC North  ] and [LOC South Waziristan  ] . 
However , recently a significant number of attacks have occurred in the settled areas. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Consulate [LOC Peshawar  ] <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
Yes , the [ORG Taliban  ] , [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and extremist militants are [MISC Anti-U.S.  ] in nature and express this in their actions and demonstrated capabilities . 
III . 
( S ) Host Country Capabilities <a id='parA' href='#parA'>¶</a>A . 
The [LOC Peshawar  ] police are poor at deterring crime , and responses to emergency calls by local citizens often go unattended . 
The police have generally responded effectively to Consulate [LOC Peshawar  ] 's requests when assistance has been needed . 
The Police have limited resources , such as a shortage of vehicles , and criminal lab facilities . 
Their police force is geared toward security force work , i.e. protecting a street corner , than investigative work or proactive procedures . 
As a result of crime concerns a number of wealthier citizens in [LOC Peshawar  ] have hired contract security companies to provide armed personnel at their residences. <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
The police forces in the [ORG NWFP  ] have received significant training and support from the [ORG U.S. State Department  ] , [ORG Diplomatic Security Anti-terrorism Training Assistance  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) [ORG Program  ] and the [ORG Department of Justice 's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program  ] ( [ORG ICITAP  ] ) . 
The training is first rate but it has not had a major effect on police capabilities in the province . 
Their ability to conduct effective investigations , whether it be post-blast , homicide or kidnappings is extremely limited. <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
Yes . 
Corruption tends to be wide spread and pervasive at all ranks of law enforcement . 
There are also reports of high-level corruption in the province. <a id='parD' href='#parD'>¶</a>D . 
Yes , [LOC Pakistan  ] 's [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) is professional and capable of deterring terrorist actions . 
However , they do face resource challenges which sometimes affects their ability to effectively conduct counterterrorism operations. <a id='parE' href='#parE'>¶</a>E . 
Yes , [ORG ISI  ] for the most part , is cooperative with [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate requests for information and support . 
They are an important [LOC U.S.  ] ally in the [MISC Global War  ] on Terrorism ( GWOT ) . 
However , there is a divided loyalty within [ORG ISI  ] ranks which may cause inaction , or assistance to [ORG Taliban  ] and anti [LOC U.S.  ] groups. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
Yes . 
A number of [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] members have been killed or apprehended. <a id='parG' href='#parG'>¶</a>G . 
Yes . 
[MISC Pakistani  ] officials have been very responsive . 
At the Consulate in [LOC Peshawar  ] , we have a platoon of [LOC Capital City Police  ] and a platoon of [MISC Frontier Constabulary  ] augmenting security at the consulate. <a id='parH' href='#parH'>¶</a>H . 
The airport security is below-average. <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
The customs and immigration control at airports is adequate but at border crossings along the border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] it is ineffective. <a id='parJ' href='#parJ'>¶</a>J . 
Ineffective , the borders are porous . 
[ORG Taliban  ] and militant extremists are constantly crossing the border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and engaging in terrorist and smuggling activity . 
The rugged terrain makes it difficult to patrol and control the border .

Both [PER Sunni  ] and [PER Shi'a  ] with extremist views support these groups. <a id='parF' href='#parF'>¶</a>F . 
The hostile third country intelligence services in [LOC Pakistan  ] include [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC China  ] .
