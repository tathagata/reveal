END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Federal Migration Service  ] Director [PER Konstantin Romodanovskiy  ] and members of his staff met with PRM/Admissions Director [PER Terry Rusch  ] , DHS Chief of [ORG Refugee Affairs Barbara Strack  ] , Deputy Chief of [ORG Refugee Affairs  ] June [ORG Tancredi  ] and refcoord October 6 to discuss the possible resettlement of [LOC North Koreans  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] and other potential cooperation between the [MISC FMS  ] and its [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts . 
[LOC North Koreans  ] ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Rusch  ] began the meeting by thanking [PER Romodanovskiy  ] for FMS' assistance with the resettlement of Meskhetian [LOC Turks  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] and noted that the [ORG GOR  ] , s experience with the statelessness issue positioned it well to play an active role within the international community in addressing it . 
She noted that the purpose of her visit to [LOC Russia  ] was to participate in a workshop sponsored by the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] to train [ORG NGOs  ] in how to refer cases to the [ORG U.S. Refugee Admissions Program  ] . 
[PER Rusch  ] noted that the [ORG GOR  ] was revising its laws on refugees and expressed [LOC U.S.  ] hopes that it would enhance protection for asylum seekers. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC North Koreans  ] , [PER Rusch  ] explained the passage of the [ORG North Korean Human Rights Act  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] interest in resettling [MISC North Korean  ] asylum seekers to the [LOC U.S.  ] if they so desired . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] understood the sensitivities of this issue for the [ORG GOR  ] given its relationship with [LOC North Korea  ] , and it appreciated the [ORG GOR  ] 's willingness to work with [ORG UNHCR  ] and the [ORG ROK  ] in resettling [LOC North Koreans  ] in [LOC South Korea  ] . 
There had been instances , including when a [MISC North Korean  ] had approached the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate in [LOC Vladivostok  ] , expressing interest in third country resettlement The [ORG U.S. Government  ] hoped that if an asylum seeker desired to go to the [LOC U.S.  ] rather than [LOC South Korea  ] , the [ORG GOR  ] would allow the [LOC United States  ] to process the case. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Romodanovskiy  ] said that there were [LOC North Koreans  ] in [LOC Russia  ] and that their status varied . 
Each year , about 20-30 of them were resettled to [LOC South Korea  ] through [ORG UNHCR  ] and the [ORG ROK  ] . 
[PER Romodanovskiy  ] stressed that the [MISC FMS  ] did not have sole responsibility for these issues , and it worked in conjunction with other [ORG GOR  ] agencies , the [ORG MFA  ] and others , that also have to be involved . 
Statelessness ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Rusch  ] raised the issue of statelessness in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Romodanovskiy  ] said that the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] had created a burden for [LOC Russia  ] , which had to absorb forced migrants from within the former [MISC Soviet  ] space , care for internally displaced persons from [LOC Chechnya  ] , and deal with refugees from third countries such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Among them were [MISC Soviet  ] citizens who were now stateless and needed to be integrated into [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Romodanovskiy  ] said that , during the last year , it had granted citizenship to 508,000 people , of whom 210,000 were former [MISC Soviet  ] citizens who had delayed seeking [MISC Russian  ] citizenship . 
The [ORG GOR  ] realized that there were several thousand more , and early this year , President [PER Putin  ] signed a law extending the deadline for [MISC Soviet  ] citizens in [LOC Russia  ] to claim [MISC Russian  ] citizenship until <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Romodanovskiy  ] said the [MISC FMS  ] continued to implement reforms and wanted to cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other [MISC Western  ] countries and that the [ORG GOR  ] had initiated the [MISC G-8  ] experts meeting on migration that had just concluded in [LOC Lisbon  ] . 
One of the key issues for the [MISC FMS  ] was further [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00011778 002 OF 002 development of its visa regime , but is was also interested in broader issues of migration and the processing of refugees and asylum seekers . 
[ORG Strack  ] noted that [ORG USCIS  ] would be pleased to organize briefings for [PER Romodanovskiy  ] or his staff in the event of a visit to the [LOC United States  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC FMS  ] has had difficulties defining its missions and its goals as a result of constant [ORG GOR  ] reorganizations and a lack of leadership . 
Our contacts at [ORG UNHCR  ] and elsewhere have welcomed [PER Romodanovskiy  ] 's leadership in taking charge of the organization and his interest in cooperation . 
They note , however , that as a result of the reorganizations and merger with the [ORG Ministry of Internal Affairs  ] , the [MISC FMS  ] has developed a law-enforcement mentality .
