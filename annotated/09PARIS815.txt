( C/NF ) SUMMARY: Presidential [PER AF-advisor Romain Serman  ] on June 18 said that deposed [MISC Mauritanian  ] President [PER Abdallahi  ] seemed to be blocking final political agreement over the [LOC Dakar  ] accord . 
[LOC France  ] was prepared to call a " stop " to the process and urge that the [LOC Dakar  ] accord be implemented as is , with or without [PER Abdallahi  ] 's agreement or participation , which could encourage cooperation on [PER Abdallahi  ] 's part . 
[PER Serman  ] said that junta leader [ORG Aziz  ] visited [LOC Paris  ] " privately " on June 12 and met with Presidential Secretary-General [PER Claude Gueant  ] , with discussion focusing on terrorism . 
[PER Serman  ] said that President [PER Sarkozy  ] planned soon on chairing a high-level [ORG GOF  ] meeting on terrorism in the [LOC Sahel  ] , which indicated the level of [MISC French  ] concern about terrorism in the region . 
[PER Serman  ] criticized businessman/lobbyist [PER Robert Bourgi  ] for his role in arranging [ORG Aziz  ] 's meeting with [PER Gueant  ] and for several press leaks involving [ORG Aziz  ] and the late President [PER Bongo  ] of [LOC Gabon  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] said that [PER Bourgi  ] should not be viewed in any manner as a representative or spokesman for the [ORG GOF  ] , including with respect to his most recent activities in [LOC Madagascar  ] to promote himself and his business interests . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC MAURITANIA  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX AZIZ'S VISIT TO [LOC PARIS  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Serman  ] confirmed press reports that junta leader [ORG Aziz  ] traveled to [LOC Paris  ] and met with Presidential Secretary-General [PER Claude Gueant  ] on June 12 . 
[PER Serman  ] said the visit was engineered by businessman and self-styled [ORG AF  ] lobbyist [PER Robert Bourgi  ] , who had ties to [PER Gueant  ] and to President [PER Sarkozy  ] pre-dating [PER Sarkozy  ] 's election to the presidency ( see below for further on [PER Bourgi  ] ) . 
[PER Bourgi  ] encouraged [ORG Aziz  ] to make a " private " visit , flew [ORG Aziz  ] to [LOC France  ] on one of his own planes , and arranged the meeting with [PER Gueant  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] , who did not attend the [MISC Aziz-Gueant  ] meeting , understood that it consisted largely of a discussion of the growing terrorism problem in the [LOC Sahel  ] , a subject of keen interest to [PER Gueant  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] said that they " undoubtedly " [LOC PARIS  ] 00000815 002 OF 002 discussed the situation in [LOC Mauritania  ] but he could offer no details . 
[MISC FRENCH  ] CONCERN ABOUT TERRORISM IN THE [LOC SAHEL  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX ( C/NF ) [PER ROBERT BOURGI  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Serman  ] 's mention of [PER Bourgi  ] allowed us to ask about his role and influence , a subject of episodic reporting in the press , where [PER Bourgi  ] is depicted as one of the last " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " fixers , middlemen , operators , and businessmen . 
[PER Serman  ] said that [PER Bourgi  ] had longstanding ties to [PER Gueant  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] but that he was first and foremost a self-promoting businessman looking out for his own interests . 
A true wheeler-dealer , [PER Bourgi  ] 's main " client " had been [LOC Gabon  ] 's recently-deceased President [PER Bongo  ] . 
[PER Bourgi  ] also had ties to ROC 's [PER Sassou Nguesso  ] and to [LOC Senegal  ] 's [PER Wade  ] , although these were less significant than his ties to [MISC Bongo.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Serman  ] said that [PER Bourgi  ] was rapidly burning his bridges , however , and this was causing his influence to drop precipitously among the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Africans  ] as well . 
[PER Bourgi  ] was the source of the press leak announcing [PER Bongo  ] 's death before the [MISC Gabonese  ] were prepared to make the announcement themselves . 
This leak angered [PER Bongo  ] 's family . 
[PER Serman  ] reported that [PER Sarkozy  ] was also unhappy about the leak , especially since the information was attributed in the press to " a source close to the [MISC French  ] government , " which tended to make observers think that the [ORG GOF  ] was responsible for the leak or tacitly approved of it , which was not the case. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC French  ] were also annoyed that [PER Bourgi  ] leaked the fact of [ORG Aziz  ] 's meeting with [PER Gueant  ] to the press . 
[ORG Aziz  ] 's visit to [LOC France  ] was supposed to be private , as was his meeting with [PER Gueant  ] . 
In [PER Serman  ] 's view , [PER Bourgi  ] leaked news of the event in an effort to demonstrate his continuing clout after the [PER Bongo  ] episode . 
[PER Serman  ] said this was backfiring , however , as the [MISC French  ] , including especially [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Gueant  ] , were not at all pleased with the leak . 
[PER Serman  ] said that [PER Bourgi  ] " is no fool , but sometimes it seems he can't help himself when there 's an opportunity for self-promotion , even if he knows it might cost him . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Although [LOC Madagascar  ] was not his area of expertise , [PER Serman  ] was aware of [PER Bourgi  ] 's attempts to play a " fixer " role there amidst the current political turmoil , " which gives him an opportunity to place himself in the thick of things . 
" . 
[PER Serman  ] said that [PER Bourgi  ] was eager to score new business in response to the potential loss of the [LOC Gabon  ] account and his alienation of the [PER Bongo  ] clan . 
[PER Serman  ] said that [PER Bourgi  ] also had new rivals for influence , with the opening up of the old " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " network that [PER Sarkozy  ] has encouraged since taking office ; this too was causing [PER Bourgi  ] to scramble for new business . 
Speaking with emphasis , [PER Serman  ] said that " you should be aware that in [LOC Madagascar  ] and everywhere else he is active , [PER Bourgi  ] does not represent the [MISC French  ] government and does not speak for us . 
And you should tell everybody else that too . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Serman  ] concluded by noting that [PER Bourgi  ] often used " [MISC La Lettre du Continent  ] , " the bi-weekly , [MISC Paris-based  ] newsletter covering principally francophone [LOC Africa  ] , as the vehicle for his news leaks . 
[PER Serman  ] advised that anything appearing in " [MISC La Lettre  ] " smacking of a possible [PER Bourgi  ] connection should be read with caution , and that one should keep in mind that [PER Bourgi  ] 's primary objective was self-promotion for the purpose of self-enrichment .
