( C ) Summary: Experts on civil-military relations in [LOC Ankara  ] contend the [MISC Turkish  ] General [PER Staff  ] ( [ORG TGS  ] ) is satisfied with the process set in motion by its April 27 warning and the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] 's subsequent decision on the presidency vote which brought [LOC Turkey  ] to early elections . 
Analysts claim that the military and pro-secular opposition parties , buoyed by mass pro-secular demonstrations in May and June , believe that even if the [ORG AKP  ] emerges from July 22 elections able to form a single-party government , it will be forced to accept a consensus candidate for the presidency . 
Despite these claims of confidence , the military continues to work to exploit debate over a cross-border operation against [ORG PKK  ] terrorists , as well as press allegations that the [LOC US  ] is either directly or indirectly providing weapons to the [ORG PKK  ] , to make the [ORG AKP  ] government appear weak on security . 
And of course there is the possibility of a last ditch attempt by the military -- via public statements , policy maneuvering , or partisan manipulation -- to sway undecided voters towards secular opposition parties . 
Military reaction to the elections may be affected by the [ORG TGS  ] 's all-consuming annual exercise of the [ORG Supreme Military Council  ] , which starts August 1 . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The crisis atmosphere following the [ORG TGS  ] 's April 27 warning , which led many to fear some kind of military intervention , has been replaced by more traditional politicking in the final stretch to July 22 national elections . 
After public sparring with the government in May and June over who would take responsibility for a cross-border operation against [ORG PKK  ] terrorists in northern [LOC Iraq  ] -- designed to show the [ORG AKP  ] government as soft on terrorism -- the [ORG TGS  ] has refrained from public statements on domestic political issues for the past two weeks . 
Chief of Defense Gen [PER Buyukanit  ] and Deputy [PER CHOD Saygun  ] enjoyed scheduled vacations on the coast in late June and early [PER July.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [ORG Ankara University  ] professor [PER Tanel Demirel  ] , the [ORG TGS  ] achieved its primary short-term objective via the April 27 announcement: preventing [PER Abdullah Gul  ] from becoming president and ensuring a [ORG Constitutional Court  ] ruling raising the vote threshold for president to 367 . 
The head of the secular and nationalist [ORG Ataturk Thought Association  ] ( [ORG ADD  ] ) , retired General [PER Sener Eruygur  ] , pointed to the large turn-out at pro-secular rallies in [LOC Istanbul  ] , [LOC Izmir  ] and other cities as proof pro-secular forces are rising to challenge the [ORG AKP.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Several observers , such as [ORG Bilkent University  ] professor and military analyst [PER Umit Cizre  ] , identify the pivotal moment in the [ORG AKP  ] 's relations with the military as the private May 4 meeting between PM [PER Erdogan  ] and [PER CHOD Buyukanit  ] at the [MISC Dolmabahce  ] palace in [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
Although [PER Cizre  ] and other analysts are not sure what happened during the 2.5 hour session , they conclude that [PER Buyukanit  ] and [PER Erdogan  ] reached some understanding . 
[ORG Ankara University  ] professor [PER Nuran Yildiz  ] believes [PER Buyukanit  ] made military " red lines " over the presidency clear to [PER Erdogan  ] at that encounter . 
All agree that the situation relaxed considerably after that. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Analysts' views vary widely on the significance of the military 's April 27 internet warning that it was ready to intervene to protect [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular democracy . 
[PER Cizre  ] and [PER Demirel  ] believe the April 27 statement was both harmful and unnecessary since the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] was poised anyway to affirm a 367 quorum requirement for the presidency and thus defeat [PER Gul  ] 's candidacy , precipitating early elections . 
[PER Yildiz  ] and others , including retired general [PER Riza Kucukoglu  ] at [LOC Ankara  ] 's [ORG Eurasian Studies Institute  ] ( [ORG ASAM  ] ) , assert the military has played its role correctly in counterbalancing [ORG AKP  ] attempts to monopolize all major power centers . 
Even critics of the military 's announcement , such as [ORG Ankara University  ] professor [PER Bedriye Poyraz  ] , believe that the [ORG AKP  ] provoked military intervention by blatant attempts to fill [ORG ANKARA  ] 00001842 002 OF 002 the government bureaucracy with its supporters and its ill-considered nomination of [PER Gul  ] for president . 
They acknowledge that , despite criticism of the military 's intervention by some intellectuals and pundits , most [LOC Turks  ] see it as natural , if not appropriate , for the generals to make their political views known. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Looking at post-election scenarios , most observers with whom we have spoken tell us the military can live with another [ORG AKP  ] government , as long as the president is a secular figure selected by consensus . 
The prospect of the [ORG AKP  ] cooperating with independent [MISC Kurdish  ] deputies in order to form a government is more controversial , as this would bring together the military and secular establishment 's two archenemies: " [MISC Islamists  ] and separatists . 
" While [PER Cizre  ] believes the generals could tolerate an alliance of [ORG AKP  ] and [MISC Kurdish  ] independents as long as the president is secular , [ORG ADD  ] 's [PER Eruygur  ] termed such an alliance a " nightmare " for [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG ASAM  ] 's [PER Kucukoglu  ] asserted that the military would be uncomfortable with independent [MISC Kurdish  ] MPs , citing their past behavior ( in the early 1990s , the previous iteration of pro-Kurdish MPs attempted to take the parliamentary oath in [MISC Turkish  ] and made statements that triggered the lifting of their parliamentary immunity and eventual prosecution ) . 
He claimed , however , that military coups are no longer necessary , now that the majority of [LOC Turks  ] who favor secularism have found their voice. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: Despite analysts' claims of military confidence , the generals are clearly working behind the scenes , using ongoing [ORG PKK  ] terrorism and the debate over the necessity of a cross-border operation into northern [LOC Iraq  ] to portray the [ORG AKP  ] as weak on terrorism . 
We also detect the military 's hand behind recent allegations that the [LOC U.S.  ] has , either directly or indirectly , provided weapons to the [ORG PKK  ] in northern [LOC Iraq  ] . 
This is also designed to weaken [ORG AKP  ] 's national security credentials and encourage undecided voters to turn to " tougher " pro-secular parties . 
While the military could roil the waters and make a public statement on the elections at any time , its post-election reaction may be delayed by the August 1 start of annual , and all-consuming , [ORG Supreme Military Council  ] ( [ORG YAS  ] ) promotions and assignments deliberations .
