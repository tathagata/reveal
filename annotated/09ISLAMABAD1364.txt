Patterson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Embassy [ORG Islamabad  ] warmly welcomes your visit . 
Your arrival comes at a moment when [ORG Pakistan’s  ] political leaders , and its people , are united in support of the military campaign to confront extremist militants in [LOC Malakand  ] ( including the [LOC Swat  ] valley ) and [LOC South Waziristan  ] , where the offensive has just begun . 
Popular support for the offensive is broad but thin . 
[ORG Pakistan’s  ] military has begun its assault in [LOC South Waziristan  ] with the goal of capturing or eliminating taliban leader [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] , whose prominence among [MISC Pakistani  ] extremist groups has risen during the last two years . 
After losing strength in his spring match-off with opposition leader ( and former Prime Minister ) [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , President [PER Zardari  ] has regained much of his political capital by garnering national support for the military campaign. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] is providing the lion’s share of international humanitarian assistance being provided to the internally displaced who fled the taliban and the military offensives in [MISC Malakand  ] . 
Some eighty percent of the displaced are staying with relatives or in rented accommodations . 
The [MISC GOP  ] and international humanitarian assistance organizations have so far been able to manage provision of assistance to the roughly two million [ORG IDPs  ] . 
The [MISC GOP  ] would like the [ORG IDPs  ] to return as areas are cleared . 
But the longer term challenge of building a capable civilian police force and a robust economy mirrors the needs spread across the nation . 
The campaign in [LOC South Waziristan  ] will play out differently ; we expect fewer [ORG IDPs  ] , more casualties , and less access for the international humanitarian assistance organizations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the longer term , the [MISC GOP  ] is confronted with a weak economy and a lack of government authority ( or government provided security ) in much of the country apart of the [LOC Punjab  ] . 
We are planning how to spend [ORG USG  ] funds to support [ORG Pakistan’s  ] civilian institutions , bolster budgetary support , strengthen the military’s COIN capabilities , build the capacity of the police , and target impoverished areas where youth are susceptible to militancy and extremism. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] is digging its way out of an economic crisis that came to a head in the fall of 2008 , caused by poor policy choices which were compounded by the global economic crisis and high international commodity prices . 
To set the stage for longer-term prosperity , the government must undertake difficult structural reforms such as eliminating subsidies ( electricity , wheat ) and broadening tax base. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Nuclear cooperation on security issues has decreased after wstatements made in the press about purported [LOC U.S.  ] plans to seize nuclear facilities surfaced . 
Despite Zardari’s own inclination to improve relations with [LOC India  ] , his need to keep the military on his side ( and/or his perceived rebuke from [MISC Indian  ] PM [PER Singh  ] in [LOC Russia  ] ) have kept him from agreeing to meet again with [PER Singh  ] in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
While we grant large amount of aid to [LOC Pakistan  ] and its military , even with the arrival to office of the well-perceived President [PER Obama  ] , [LOC America  ] is viewed with some suspicion by the majority of [ORG Pakistan’s  ] people and its institutions . 
End Summary . 
Domestic Politics ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The government headed by President [PER Asif Zardari  ] and Prime Minister [PER Yousaf Gilani  ] , elected in 2008 after eight years of military rule , is stable . 
The [ORG Pakistani People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) and its coalition allies rule in three of the four provinces . 
[PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is by far the most popular politician in [LOC Pakistan  ] ( with an 83 percent approval rating compared to Zardari’s 20 percent in the latest [ORG IRI  ] poll ) , but he does not have the votes to bring down the government. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] signed [ORG Shari’a  ] law in [LOC Swat  ] , which precipitated the taliban’s emboldened attempt to dominate [LOC Swat  ] and bordering areas . 
He also overplayed his hand when [PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Shahbaz  ] were declared ineligible by the Court . 
This exposed him to the force of [LOC Nawaz’  ] ability to bring the populace into the street during the ( lawyer’s ) “long march.” Having managed to stay in office by restoring the Chief Justice and maintain civil order during that period , [PER Zardari  ] has recovered through his so far successful ( if not robust ) management of relations with the [ORG Pakistan Military  ] and by [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00001364 002 OF 006 piggy-backing on the popular support for the military’s offensive against the taliban. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While [PER Nawaz  ] is preparing for the next election and appealing directly to the street , a court case considering voiding past convictions against him is winding its way through the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
Even though [PER Zardari  ] retains the Presidency , [PER Nawaz  ] can be seen as the real winner of the “long march” stand-off: he demonstrated his popular support ; stood firm in his demands ; saw the [ORG Supreme Court  ] leadership reinstated ; and , affirmed his right to run in the next election . 
During the events leading up to the “long march” there was talk that the [ORG Army  ] might feel compelled to step in . 
Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] [PER Kayani  ] is determined that a civilian government succeed , however , and while he mistrusts [PER Zardari  ] he despises [MISC Nawaz.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) While far from perfect , you will find [PER Zardari  ] is pro-American , anti-extremist and eager to be seen as working with the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] runs the show on the civilian side , although he is not a popular leader and admits himself that he came to high office without previous direct experience as an elected politician . 
Secular and westernized , [PER Zardari  ] sees himself as viewing the world the way [MISC Americans  ] do ; this same image works against him with the public. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Zardari  ] is less likely to make public announcements chastising the [ORG USG  ] for its policies in , and toward [LOC Pakistan  ] ( including on [ORG USG  ] drone activity ) than other senior [MISC GOP  ] officials . 
His public ( and private ) lament is that [LOC Pakistan  ] has the will to combat terrorism , but the [ORG USG  ] has been miserly in providing resources . 
In his own fashion , this is Zardari’s version of the widely held view that [LOC Pakistan  ] has made great sacrifices at the behest of [LOC America  ] , for little return and less recognition. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] has shown strong leadership skills in building Parliamentary coalitions at times of national crisis and in the absence of public leadership by President [PER Zardari  ] . 
[PER Gilani  ] has stiched together all party Parliamentary sessions that have forged cross-party unity on the need to tackle terrorism and to endorse the military offensives against [MISC Pakistani  ] extremists ( often referred to as “miscreants” ) . 
He gave the impassioned address to the public May 7 asking the [MISC Pakistani  ] people to support military action in [LOC Swat  ] and surrounding agrees ; a defining moment that marked the beginning of the sea change in public attitudes toward the taliban and granted legitimacy to the military’s actions. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Gilani  ] was also instrumental in bringing the “long march” crisis to a peaceful resolution , and was the senior [MISC GOP  ] official ( not [PER Zardari  ] ) who announced the reinstatement of the [ORG Supreme Court Justice  ] . 
Like Foreign Minister [PER Qureshi  ] , [PER Gilani  ] comes from the religiously important [LOC Multan  ] and is a [MISC Sufi  ] saint . 
His [MISC English  ] is somewhat halting and conversation with him can be opaque . 
He pays great attention to protocol and is an attentive listener , however , when he believes he is being treated as a friend and equal . 
Reports of [MISC Zardari/Gilani  ] tensions are probably exaggerated . 
Economic and Structural Challenges ---------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] is digging its way out of an economic crisis that came to a head in the fall of 2008 , caused by poor policy choices which were compounded by the global economic crisis and high international commodity prices . 
The government sought relief from the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] , and signed a $7.6 billion agreement with them in November 2008 . 
Under the terms of this agreement , the [MISC GOP  ] has curtailed borrowing from the central bank and greatly cut back its expenditures , bringing its fiscal deficit down from over 7 percent of GDP to 3.4 percent . 
The market has responded to these reforms , and foreign exchange reserves , which had fallen to dangerously low levels , have rebounded and the value of the rupee has stabilized. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) However , to set the stage for longer-term prosperity , the government must undertake more difficult structural reforms such as eliminating unaffordable subsidies ( electricity , wheat ) and broadening its tax base . 
The belt-tightening of the past eight months has caused growth to [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00001364 003 OF 006 slow , however , and it is estimated to be 2 percent for the current fiscal year , down from original predictions of 4.5 percent . 
The challenge in the coming year will be to stimulate the economy while maintaining a level of fiscal discipline . 
The situation is complicated by the financial burden of caring for large numbers of internally displaced persons and by the need to significantly step up civilian law enforcement personnel , especially in [LOC NWFP  ] , [LOC FATA  ] , but also around the country . 
The [MISC GOP  ] is heavily dependent on donor assistance to pay for its development and humanitarian assistance budget , at least for the foreseeable future . 
The [ORG Swat Military Campaign  ] and [ORG IDPS  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The military’s effective campaign against taliban in [LOC Bajaur  ] last fall was limited in geographical scope . 
Rumors that taliban leaders were sitting in [LOC Swat  ] festered , and the government entered into a series of ill-advised and half-hearted negotiations with extremist leaders residing in the region . 
These resulted in Zardari’s eventual signing of the [MISC Nazm-e-Adl  ] regulation in April , which the government sold as meeting the local population’s demand for “speedy justice.” Politicians were at pains to explain that [LOC Swat  ] , as a princely state , had an historically different history and custom and that the deal did not mark an abdication of government authority or an open door to harsh ( by [MISC Pakistani  ] standards ) interpretation of [LOC Shari’a  ] law . 
The wide-spread release of a video showing taliban flogging a young woman in a public square brought doubts about taliban intent home to the public. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) [PER Zardari  ] , meanwhile , argued privately that he had to sign the deal in order that the [MISC GOP  ] be seen to have been willing to try everything before turning the military against its own people . 
The shocking flogging video circulated at the same time as suicide bombers and terrorist gunmen took on targets including police stations and main boulevard checkpoints in [LOC Lahore  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
In the rural areas , they blew up [ORG Mosques  ] and shrines . 
Public opinion about the taliban , that it was part of the social fabric of parts of the country and if left unperturbed would not damage public life , started to shift . 
Once the taliban moved out of [LOC Swat  ] , where extremists had overrun the streets and beheaded well-known journalists , the view that the [MISC Nazm-e-Adl  ] deal had been breached by the taliban grew . 
PM [PER Gilani  ] gathered cross-party support in Parliament and appealed to the public to support a military campaign in [LOC Swat.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) After military operations started in May in [LOC Swat  ] and neighboring areas , some two million [MISC Pakistani  ] citizens moved out of the area and became internally displaced . 
( The wealthier families of [LOC Swat  ] departed a year earlier as taliban violence against the feudal elite and the threat of it forced them to retreat to [LOC Islamabad  ] and elsewhere . 
) Senior [MISC GOP  ] officials would be the first to say that it was the hospitality of the [MISC Pakistani  ] people which kept the [ORG IDPs  ] clothed , fed and sheltered in the first instance . 
Best estimates are that 80 percent of the displaced have been taken in by [MISC Pakistanis  ] , not necessarily relatives . 
[ORG NGOs  ] and the [ORG UN  ] are serving the population not in camps . 
A combination of military-run , community volunteer , and [ORG UN  ] agency directed camps are sheltering the other [LOC IDPs.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) We have reports of some [ORG IDPs  ] returning , including several hundred thousand in [LOC Bajaur  ] and up to half the populations in parts of Buner ; families traveling with livestock can be witnessed returning to the [LOC Swat  ] area via roads leaving [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
However , we do not have hard figures on returns: lack of security , and families’ desire to receive the [MISC GOP  ] return fund of USD 312 are two of the reasons [ORG IDPs  ] have yet to return . 
Operations in [LOC Malakand  ] , though ongoing in some areas , are said to be in the “mopping-up phase” ( even as officials acknowledge that sporadic “spot” fighting is likely to continue for another six months . 
) <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) All of the big international humanitarian organizations are present in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Like our own approach to staffing the Consulate , even the recent terror attacks in [LOC Peshawar  ] ( in which [ORG UN  ] officials were killed ) have not dissuaded them . 
Most humanitarian organizations have withdrawn their international staff to [LOC Islamabad  ] ; leaving [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00001364 004.2 OF 006 local staff to implement programs at the camps and in communities . 
Security continues to be an issue , even in areas the [ORG Army  ] has declared “cleared.” Economic Recovery Key --------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] and the [MISC GOP  ] are in agreement that the key to maintaining security ( and keeping extremists from reemerging ) is in economic recovery and improving civilian authority -- not least in law enforcement . 
Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] calls this the “hearts and minds” campaign necessary to maintain the gains won by the military campaign and to maintain popular support for those campaigns . 
The [MISC GOP  ] is confronted with a weak economy and a lack of government authority ( or government provided security ) in much of the country outside of the [LOC Punjab  ] , and even in the south of the prosperous [LOC Punjab  ] we have seen an increasing trend to extremism among youth. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) We are planning how to spend [ORG USG  ] funds to support [MISC Pakistan’s  ] civilian institutions , bolster budgetary support , strengthen the military’s [ORG COIN  ] capabilities , build the capacity of the police , and target impoverished areas where the youth are susceptible to militancy and extremism . 
What the [MISC GOP  ] calls “hearts and minds” we see as part of our broader objective of helping the [MISC GOP  ] build an effective [ORG COIN  ] capability and policy by using [ORG USG  ] resources where the [MISC GOP  ] is particularly exposed . 
The [MISC GOP  ] will need to focus on recovery , rehabilitation , and reconstruction if it is to hold its recent gains . 
Establishing ( or reestablishing long-languishing ) government authority and services poses one of the greatest challenges to the [MISC GOP  ] . 
Economic development is the key to [MISC Pakistan’s  ] success in implementing a broad-ranging counterinsurgency policy . 
[LOC Waziristan  ] ---------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( S ) [MISC Pakistan’s  ] military has begun its assault in [LOC South Waziristan  ] with the goal of capturing or eliminating taliban leader [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] , whose prominence among [MISC Pakistani  ] extremist groups has risen during the last two years . 
We expect the military campaign in [LOC Waziristan  ] to be tougher than in [LOC Swat  ] , with the military willing to use air power to an extent it was not in the “settled areas.” The military strategy is three pronged: isolate [PER Baitullah  ] by putting intense pressure on the [PER Mehsud  ] tribe ; incite inter-tribal violence ( the leader of the [MISC Bhittani  ] tribe has already come out publicly against [PER Baitullah  ] ) ; make deals with other militants to refrain from supporting [PER Baitullah  ] against the [MISC GOP  ] . 
We have some indications that the separation of [PER Mehsud  ] tribe peoples is already underway. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( S ) The 2007-2008 blockade of the [PER Mehsud  ] area , which was initially quite severe , produced approximately 200,000 [ORG IDPs  ] . 
However , we expect the attack from the military to be more fearsome by an order of magnitudes ; meaning much higher casualty rates and less access for the humanitarian relief agencies . 
Some “shaping operations” designed to contain and weaken [PER Baitullah Mehsud’s  ] sphere of operations were undertaken in advance of the campaign. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) The [MISC GOP  ] is wary of international scrutiny through the [ORG United Nations  ] which may embroil it in charges of being in breach of international humanitarian law . 
The [ORG USG  ] has made no judgment on this issue , but the [MISC GOP  ] would be well-served by seeking to uphold [MISC Geneva Convention  ] standards during the conflict , regardless of its own judgment that the military offensives represent domestic law enforcement activities . 
Military Cooperation -------------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The campaigns in [LOC Malakand  ] ( including [LOC Swat  ] ) and now in [LOC Waziristan  ] , have demonstrated [MISC Pakistan’s  ] will to fight extremism . 
Faced with its weaknesses against a formidable enemy , the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] has accepted [ORG USG  ] training ( if on a limited and highly-controlled basis ) , and that has given us new access and opportunities to improve [MISC Pakistani  ] counter-insurgency capability . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has agreed to build additional tripartite [ORG Border Coordination Centers  ] ( [ORG BCCs  ] ) , and we have expanded intelligence sharing through the [ORG Torkham ISLAMABAD  ] 00001364 005.2 OF 006 BCC . 
The military remains reluctant to expand the [LOC U.S.  ] military footprint , but we now have the basis for increased cooperation . 
[ORG USG  ] efforts to provide Mi-17 helicopters have meant an exponential increase in the [LOC Pakistan  ] Military’s ability to deploy helicopters in its ongoing campaign against extremists. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The campaign itself may prove , over time , to be an event that builds trust and increases [MISC U.S./Pak  ] military cooperation . 
Military and civilian authorities underscore , however , that gains made in the campaign will only be supported by the public if they are perceived as having been made by [LOC Pakistan  ] alone . 
Nuclear Security ---------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( S ) Since A.Q Khan’s proliferation activities came to light in 2004 , [LOC Pakistan  ] has sought to rehabilitate its image as a nuclear technology bazaar . 
The [MISC GOP  ] passed laws regulating exports of sensitive technologies and criminalizing proliferation , established an export control mechanism , joined the [ORG Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] , and strengthened its [ORG National Command Authority  ] and security apparatus to govern and protect its nuclear weapons . 
[LOC U.S.  ] support has been instrumental to [MISC Pakistan’s  ] improved nonproliferation practices . 
[LOC U.S.  ] experts have trained [MISC Pakistani  ] counterparts in a wide variety of topics ranging from technology controls to physical protection , provided critical equipment , and encouraged [MISC Pakistan’s  ] adherence to international nonproliferation instruments. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Over the last two months , however , local and international media reporting on [LOC U.S.  ] and international fears that terrorists would acquire [MISC Pakistan’s  ] nuclear weapons has put the [MISC GOP  ] on the defensive . 
These concerns centered on the proximity of some nuclear sites to territory under attack by the taliban , the rumored dispersal of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] nuclear assets , and the vulnerability of weapons and nuclear materials in transit . 
The [MISC GOP  ] is particularly neuralgic to suggestions that its nuclear weapons could fall into terrorist hands and to reports of [LOC U.S.  ] plans to seize the weapons in case of emergency . 
As a result , [LOC Pakistan  ] has begun to pull back from some nonproliferation engagement with the [ORG USG  ] , including refusing high-level discussions and delaying implementation of some programs . 
One effort to remove jointly spent nuclear fuel from a [MISC Pakistani  ] nuclear research reactor , for instance , has been put on hold for 3-4 months , or until such time as the media attention has abated . 
[LOC India  ] ----- <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) President [PER Zardari  ] is personally in favor of improving [MISC Pakistan’s  ] relations with [LOC India  ] , but efforts early in his tenure ( including on opening trade between [MISC Indian  ] and [LOC Pakistan-held Kashmir  ] ) were overcome by the [LOC Mumbai  ] terror attacks and India’s reaction to what it perceived as [MISC Pakistan’s  ] complicity in them and by the [LOC Pakistan  ] Military’s lack of approval for such initiatives which [PER Zardari  ] can not take on his own . 
[PER Zardari  ] is conscious that he must not be perceived as reopening negotiations on [LOC Kashmir  ] now if he wants to keep [MISC Pakistan’s  ] military focused on the western campaigns -- and not its institutional enemy , [LOC India.  ] <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) The June 16 meeting between President [PER Zardari  ] and [MISC Indian  ] Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] in [LOC Russia  ] was marred by what the [MISC Pakistani  ] side viewed as Singh’s “rudeness” in telling the press ( in front of [PER Zardari  ] ) that he was only charged with speaking to the President about the use of [MISC Pakistani  ] soil by terrorists aimed at [LOC India  ] . 
PM [PER Gilani  ] will attend the [LOC NAM Summit  ] in [LOC Egypt  ] in July , instead of [PER Zardari  ] , thus obviating what the [MISC GOP  ] had initially said would be the next opportunity for the leaders to meet . 
The [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] suggests that only [ORG USG  ] pressure will cause the [ORG GOI  ] to reestablish the “Composite Dialogue” -- the bilateral forum meant to develop a series of confidence building measures between the two nations . 
[LOC America  ] ------- [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00001364 006.2 OF 006 <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( S ) While we grant large amounts of aid to [LOC Pakistan  ] and its military , even with the arrival to office of the well-perceived President [PER Obama  ] , [LOC America  ] is viewed with some suspicion by the majority of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] people and its institutions . 
We are viewed at best as a fickle friend , and at worst as the reason why [LOC Pakistan  ] is attacking its own ( although this view may be changing as the popular picture of the true nature of the taliban has shifted in the last several months ) . 
While the Army remains fixated on [LOC India  ] as [MISC Pakistan’s  ] mortal enemy , the common man ( and most importantly the youth ) is just as likely to point to [LOC America  ] as the nation which has twisted [MISC Pakistan’s  ] collective arm , leaving it weak . 
Much of the financial support and technical advice we give to the [MISC GOP  ] is delivered privately and in a low-key fashion: our goal is to strengthen [MISC Pakistani  ] institutions and demonstrable ties to the [ORG USG  ] have the opposite effect in the public mind . 
[MISC GOP  ] officials are prickly about issues of sovereignty . 
They too can’t be seen as reliant on [LOC U.S.  ] largess . 
How to support the civilian government , strengthen its institutions , economy , and military capacity to engage in [LOC COIN  ] , without further provoking antagonism toward the [LOC U.S.  ] , remains a central challenge .
