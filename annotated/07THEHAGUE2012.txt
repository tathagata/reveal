C. THE HAGUE 1994 Classified By: [PER Michael Gallagher  ] , [ORG CDA  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: On November 19 , Charge delivered reftel A points to [PER Laurent Stokvis  ] , Director of the [ORG Department of Western Hemisphere Affairs  ] , [PER Anton Schellekens  ] , [ORG Desk Officer for Kingdom  ] ( i.e , [LOC Aruba  ] and [LOC Antilles  ] ) [ORG Affairs  ] , and [PER Wendy Engelberts  ] , [ORG Desk Officer for Venezuela  ] . 
Stovkis emphasized positive relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
At the same time , he explained that the trend in [LOC Venezuela  ] also worries us , but details are lacking to make any specific charges of human rights violations . 
Post believes the [MISC Dutch  ] will continue to stress keeping relations good with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
KEEPING RELATIONS GOOD ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Reviewing reftel A points with Charge , [PER Stokvis  ] responded our basic policy is keeping relations good . 
Joint [MISC Dutch-Venezuelan  ] naval exercises earlier this year were a successful confidence building exercise . 
On a practical level , executive branch to executive branch , cooperation is good , except at the political level . 
Other [MISC Dutch  ] agencies just pick up the phone to resolve problems . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] don't have a sense that [LOC Venezuela  ] has territorial ambitions right now . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] has not affected [LOC Caribbean  ] tourism . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are looking at these elements and for opportunities to engage positively. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] also stated the trend in [LOC Venezuela  ] also worries us , but details are lacking to make any specific charges of human rights or [MISC Venezuelan  ] Constitutional violations . 
First , the [MISC Dutch  ] don't know the exact content of the proposed constitutional reforms . 
The government has made proposed reforms , and the parliament approved a counterproposal . 
It 's important to have a clear idea of what you're criticizing to avoid losing the argument with [PER Chavez  ] , who will hold up different constitutions to rebut any criticisms . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] prefer to look at specific [MISC Venezuelan  ] actions rather than focus on controversial laws . 
At the same time , [PER Stokvis  ] welcomed further specific information about human rights violations , and asserted that the [LOC Netherlands  ] will comply with its human rights obligations . 
He also expressed an interest in knowing about specific violations by [PER Chavez  ] of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Constitution.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] added that the [MISC Dutch  ] are watchful of [MISC Venezuelan  ] actions , and all is clearly not well . 
Political relations are not effective -- the [MISC Dutch  ] embassy cannot get meetings with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Schellekens  ] said that [LOC Curacao  ] and [ORG Bonaire  ] could face a refugee problem if there is violence in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Stokvis  ] theorized that [PER Chavez  ] could always try to escape a domestic political problems with an attack on the islands . 
CAUTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS CRITIQUES --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Venezuela  ] Desk Officer [PER Engelberts  ] earlier expressed caution on criticizing the human rights situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Discussing reftel B points with POLOFF on September 28 , she noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] were waiting to see the results of the constitutional referendum on December 2 or <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
[PER Engelberts  ] acknowledged the [MISC Constitution  ] would concentrate powers with the central government , but it was unclear how the reforms would affect local government . 
If human rights were affected , the [ORG EU  ] would react . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] raise human rights with every visit , but hadn't received notifications of abuses or visits by human rights defenders about [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Current polling suggests the people of [LOC Venezuela  ] may not support the new constitution , but [PER Chavez  ] may include enough social reforms -- such as a shorter work day -- to pull in the needed votes. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In a conversation on August 30 , 2007 , Ms. [PER Gertie Mulder  ] , head of the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's [LOC South America  ] Division , said [PER Chavez  ] was shocked by the reaction to his decision to close [ORG Radio Caracas Television  ] . 
She was encouraged by the decision of the [MISC Venezuelan Supreme Court  ] to permit cable broadcasts from [LOC Miami  ] . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] has a tradition of media freedom . 
DOWNPLAYING FRICTION WITH [LOC VENEZUELA  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Mulder  ] also downplayed friction with [LOC Venezuela  ] after the [MISC Dutch  ] press reported on [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] 's August 15 , 2007 remarks suggesting that everything within 200 THE HAGUE 00002012 002 OF 002 miles of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] coast belonged to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
( [LOC NOTE:  ] the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] lie 40 miles from the [MISC Venezuelan  ] coast . 
END NOTE . 
) The [ORG MFA  ] did not react publicly to [PER Chavez  ] 's remarks until [MISC Dutch  ] legislator [PER Hans Van Baalen  ] ( [ORG Liberal Party  ] ) promised to make inquiry , and asserted that [LOC Venezuela  ] should stay away from our [LOC Falklands  ] . 
On August 21 , the [ORG MFA  ] stated publicly that the [MISC Dutch  ] ambassador in [LOC Venezuela  ] had been instructed to ask the GOV for clarification of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's intentions . 
Asked about [MISC Dutch-Venezuelan  ] discussions , [PER Mulder  ] noted that the [LOC Netherlands  ] will continue to emphasize its good neighbor policy . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] characterized the press reports as inaccurate -- [PER Chavez  ] had not included the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] when he gestured to purported [MISC Venezuelan  ] possessions on a map of the [LOC Caribbean.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Similarly , on [MISC Venezuelan  ] arms acquisitions , the [LOC Netherlands  ] does not see a threat . 
[PER Mulder  ] implied that the [ORG EU Code of Conduct  ] was an appropriate and adequate tool to respond . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Although post will continue to engage [ORG MFA  ] contacts , parliament and [ORG NGOs  ] about the human rights situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] , we do not expect the [MISC Dutch  ] to publicly take a tough line with [PER Chavez  ] barring extreme human rights abuses or threats to [MISC Dutch  ] economic and territorial interests in the [LOC Caribbean  ] . 
We found [PER Stokvis  ] generally more concerned about keeping an even keel with [PER Chavez  ] than rocking his boat . 
With respect to [LOC Venezuela  ] , pragmatism prevails at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] . 
That said , we welcome the opportunity to re-engage with the [ORG MFA  ] , especially if we have specific information regarding violations of human rights and/or legal norms to share with our [MISC Dutch  ] colleagues . 
END COMMENT .
