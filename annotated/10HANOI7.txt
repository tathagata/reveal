( C ) SUMMARY: Vietnam’s poor handling of the situations at the [LOC Plum Village Community  ] at the [ORG Bat Nha Pagoda  ] and the [MISC Dong Chiem Catholic  ] parish last week — particularly the excessive use of violence — is troublesome and indicative of a larger [ORG GVN  ] crackdown on human rights in the run-up to the January 2011 Party [ORG Congress  ] . 
However , these situations are primarily “land disputes , ” do not meet the statutory requirement in the 1998 [ORG International Religious Freedom Act  ] , and should not divert our attention from the significant gains in expanding religious freedoms that [LOC Vietnam  ] has made since the lifting of [ORG CPC  ] designation in November 2006 . 
These gains include increased recognition and registration of scores of new religions , implementation of a new legal framework on religion , and training programs at the local and national level . 
[MISC Catholic  ] and Protestant communities , including those in the [LOC North  ] and [LOC Northwest Highlands  ] , continue to report improvements , as do members of the [MISC Muslim  ] , [ORG Baha’i  ] , and [ORG Cao Dai  ] faiths throughout [LOC Vietnam  ] . 
The widespread , systematic religious persecution that existed prior to Vietnam’s designation in 2004 does not exist anymore . 
Post therefore recommends that the Department not re designate [LOC Vietnam  ] and instead use high-level engagement opportunities to press the [ORG GVN  ] to continue to expand religious freedom in [LOC Vietnam  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
Conditions Prior to [ORG CPC  ] Designation ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Prior to the designation of [LOC Vietnam  ] as a [ORG Country of Particular Concern  ] ( [ORG CPC  ] ) in 2004 , the [MISC Vietnamese  ] government’s repression of certain religious groups and their followers was systematic and widespread , and official interference with religious activities was the norm . 
The [ORG U.S. Government  ] had a list of 45 individuals imprisoned because of their religious belief — including members of the Buddhist , [MISC Catholic  ] , Protestant , [PER Hoa Hao  ] and [ORG Cao Dai  ] faiths . 
Thousands of [ORG Central Highland  ] villagers and other ethnic minorities were restricted from practicing their religion and many were forced to renounce their faith . 
Religious believers were often subjected to harassment and physical abuse . 
In 2001 , the government forced the closure of nearly all unrecognized Protestant congregations and meeting points in the [ORG Central Highlands.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Vietnamese  ] government , moreover , limited the intake of new seminarians and the ordination of new priests to numbers well below the necessary “replacement rate” for the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
The government also did not support the [MISC Church’s  ] participation in humanitarian activities such as the fight against [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] . 
Church requests for the creation of new dioceses , the formation of a new seminary and the appointment of new bishops also languished in the absence of formal [ORG GVN  ] approval . 
Improvements Prior to Lifting of [ORG CPC  ] Designation --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) After Vietnam’s designation as a [ORG CPC  ] in 2004 , DRL/IRF and the [MISC Embassy  ] created a roadmap to assist [LOC Vietnam  ] in lifting the designation . 
In 2004 and 2005 — just two years’ time — the [MISC Vietnamese  ] government introduced sweeping changes to its religious freedom policy by implementing a new legal framework on religion that bans forced renunciation , grants citizens the right to freedom [MISC HANOI  ] 00000007 002 OF 004 of belief and religion , as well as the freedom not to follow a religion , and prohibits violations of these freedoms . 
The government conducted many training programs to assure uniform compliance of the new legal framework at the provincial , district , commune , and village levels . 
[ORG Central  ] government officials began responding to complaints from religious leaders about their treatment at the grassroots level . 
Protestants across the north also reported improvement in officials’ attitudes towards their religions and practice. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the [LOC North  ] and [LOC Northwest Highlands  ] , [MISC Buddhists  ] , [MISC Catholics  ] , Protestants , and the government itself reported an increase in religious activity and observance . 
Nearly 1000 [ORG Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam  ] ( [ORG SECV  ] ) “meeting points” and places of worship affiliated with other religious organizations in the [LOC Central Highlands  ] were registered , including in [PER Gia Lai  ] province where registrations effectively legalized operations for 75,000 believers in the province . 
76 [ORG SECV  ] congregations were recognized in the [LOC Central Highlands  ] and were engaged in regular religious activities . 
29 Evangelical Church of [LOC Vietnam  ] ( [ORG ECVN  ] ) congregations were registered in the [LOC North  ] and [ORG Northwest Highlands.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The new legal framework allowed for the training of hundreds of new Protestant and [MISC Catholic  ] clergy members , including 71 [ORG SECV  ] pastors in the [LOC Central Highlands  ] . 
57 [MISC Catholic  ] priests were ordained in a mass public ceremony in [LOC Hanoi  ] . 
Other [MISC Catholic  ] priests , including nine in the [MISC Dak Lak  ] diocese , were ordained throughout the country . 
A new [ORG SECV  ] [MISC Christian  ] training center was approved and opened in [PER Ho Chi Minh City  ] and a new seminary was opened by the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in 2006. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Throughout the country , including the [ORG Central and Northwest Highlands  ] , officially-recognized religious organizations reported that they were able to operate openly , and followers of these religions report that they were able to worship without harassment . 
Other non-recognized religions , such as the [ORG Baha’i  ] faith , reported that their followers did not face harassment and that the authorities facilitated the legalization of their activities . 
Finally , all individuals raised by the [LOC United States  ] as prisoners of concern for reasons connected to their faith were released as of September 2006 . 
Improvements since Lifting [ORG CPC  ] Designation ( November 2006 ) --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While implementation of the legal framework has been uneven , the pace of progress continues to be swift . 
Since 2006 , the [ORG GOV  ] issued national-level recognition or registration to the following churches: [ORG Seventh Day Adventists  ] , [ORG Grace Baptist Church  ] , [ORG Bani Muslim Sect  ] , [ORG Vietnam Baptist Convention  ] ( [ORG Southern Baptist )  ] , [ORG Baha’i  ] Faith , [ORG Vietnam Mennonite Church  ] , [PER Assemblies  ] of [PER God  ] , [ORG United World Mission Church  ] , [ORG Pure Land Buddhist Home Practice Association  ] , [ORG Vietnam Presbyterian Church  ] , [ORG Vietnam Christian Fellowship  ] , the [ORG Bani Muslim Sect  ] , [ORG Threefold Enlightened Truth Path  ] , the [ORG Threefold Southern Tradition  ] , [ORG Mysterious Fragrance from Precious Mountains  ] , and the Four [MISC Gratitudes.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Ho Chi Minh City  ] has registered at least 91 Protestant house churches , serving 7,225 parishioners from many different denominations established before and after 1975 . 
These groups include Pentecostals , [PER Jehovah’s Witnesses  ] , [MISC Baptists  ] , [MISC Presbyterians  ] , [PER Methodists  ] , [ORG LDS Church  ] , [PER Assemblies  ] of [PER God  ] and the [ORG United Gospel Outreach Church  ] . 
Additionally , all meeting points that had been closed in the [LOC Central Highlands  ] have since been reopened , totaling over 1,700 meeting points and 150 registered congregations . 
The [ORG SECV  ] has also opened scores of new churches with the assistance of [LOC Central Highlands’  ] authorities in [PER Gia Lai  ] , [LOC Dak Lak  ] , and [PER Dak Nong  ] provinces . 
The [ORG SECV  ] has confirmed that training classes for pastors in [MISC Dak Lak  ] and [PER Gia Lai  ] are ongoing and that hundreds of new pastors have been ordained and assigned to newly-registered meeting points . 
The [ORG SECV  ] has reported that a previous shortage of pastors [ORG HANOI  ] 00000007 003 OF 004 in the [LOC Central Highlands  ] no longer exists. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Additional churches were registered in the [LOC Northwest Highlands  ] bringing the total [ORG ECVN  ] registered congregations in the region to 168 . 
The [ORG ECVN  ] was allowed to build its first new church in decades in [PER Lang Son Province  ] in November 2008 . 
The [LOC Church  ] houses an ethnic minority Red Dzao congregation , but will also conduct services for a recently established and newly registered ethnic H’mong congregations . 
During the past few years , members of Mission [LOC Vietnam  ] and foreign visitors , both official and religious , have witnessed religious ceremonies involving thousands of [MISC Christians  ] , [MISC Catholics  ] and [MISC Buddhists  ] , as well as Vietnam’s indigenous religions , such as the [ORG Cao Dai.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Ongoing land disputes notwithstanding , the [MISC Catholic  ] Church continues to report that its ability to gather and to worship has improved , and restrictions have eased on the assignment of clergy . 
During the 2007 visit of the [ORG U.S. Commission  ] on [ORG International Religious Freedom  ] , one [MISC Catholic  ] priest told Commissioners that in the past , the [ORG Church  ] had to wait for explicit approval from the [ORG GVN  ] before moving forward with the appointment of clergy . 
Now , the [ORG Church  ] submits names and the [ORG GVN  ] has 30 days to voice its disapproval . 
The priest said the [ORG GVN  ] objected in only one instance , and since the objection came after the 30 days had passed , the [ORG Church  ] proceeded with their choice without repercussions . 
In 2008 , the [ORG GVN  ] approved the establishment of an additional [MISC Catholic  ] seminary and the [ORG GVN  ] no longer restricts the number of students entering seminary each year . 
In April 2008 , government officials returned the [ORG La Vang  ] church and pilgrimage center , the most important [MISC Catholic  ] pilgrimage site in the country . 
The [ORG GVN  ] also has also relaxed its stance against [ORG Church  ] efforts to involve itself in the fight against [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] and other social work activities , a process we are encouraging . 
In December 2009 , State President [PER Nguyen Minh Triet  ] met with [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] in [LOC Vatican City  ] for a meeting that the [LOC Vatican  ] characterized as a “significant event in the progress of bilateral relations with [MISC Vietnam.”  ] Since 2006 , the [LOC Vatican  ] and [LOC Vietnam  ] have exchanged a number of delegations , including a January 2007 visit by PM [PER Nguyen Tan Dung  ] , and created a [ORG Joint Working Group  ] on reestablishing relations that met for the first time in February 2009 . 
More Needs to be Done --------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Vietnam’s improving record on religious freedom has been tarred by the recent violence against [MISC Catholics  ] in [PER Dong Chiem  ] and the forced eviction of nearly 400 monks and nuns affiliated with [PER Thich Nhat Hanh’s Plum Village Order  ] from first the Bat [ORG Nha Pagoda  ] and later the [ORG Phuoc Hue Pagoda  ] both in [PER Lam Dong Province  ] . 
These evictions , and the violence associated with them , were preceded by months of intimidation and physical attacks . 
[LOC Vietnam  ] has been slow to acknowledge the damage caused by the [ORG Lang Mai/Bat Nha  ] dispute , with the [ORG GVN  ] repeating the now standard line that the incidents reflected a convoluted intra- Buddhist disagreement . 
As religious freedom progresses in [LOC Vietnam  ] , religious groups are increasingly demanding more from the government than the right to worship freely -- including the desire to be more involved in charitable activities and seeking resolution to longstanding property disputes . 
Vietnam’s single- Party-dominated state still draws the line at any co-mingling of religion with politics . 
This explains not only Vietnam’s very rough treatment of leading political dissident and [ORG BLOC  ] 8406 cofounder Father [PER Nguyen Van Ly  ] , as well as the GVN’s approach to the [ORG Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam  ] and the so-called “Dega Protestant Church” in the [LOC Central Highlands  ] . 
Additional areas that need improvement include the slow pace of registrations of Protestant congregations in the [LOC Northwest Highlands  ] and the lack of approval of a H’mong translation of the Bible . 
Isolated incidents of harassment of [MISC Christians  ] ; and while illegal , the occasional forced renunciation of faith , also continue in far-flung areas . 
Comment [ORG HANOI  ] 00000007 004 OF 004 ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The [ORG GVN  ] is coming under pressure , justifiably , for its ham-fisted , at times brutish , handling of the situations in Bat Nha and [PER Dong Chiem  ] . 
As we saw with the large-scale [MISC Catholic  ] protests a year ago in [LOC Hanoi  ] and July 2009 in [LOC Quang  ] Binh province ( reftels ) , there are complicated historical and land use issues at play . 
Until the government develops a transparent , fair process for adjudicating land claims , disputes between the government and religious organizations will continue to fester and occasionally flair up . 
However , such incidents are largely land issues , not religious persecution . 
Furthermore , they do not approach the threshold established by the 1998 [ORG International Religious Freedom Act  ] . 
Moreover , despite the continuing problems mentioned above , there are no indications that the [ORG GVN  ] is backsliding on its commitment to register and recognize religious groups , a principle condition for the lifting of [ORG CPC  ] in 2006 . 
The [ORG GVN  ] appears to be implementing its legal framework on religion that it codified in March 2005 .
