( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Security Council  ] will hold consultations on [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] on October 13 . 
The Presidential Statement issued on September 29 ( reftel ) expressed the [ORG Council  ] 's concern about delays in preparations for the November 29 [MISC Ivorian  ] elections , and stated the [ORG Council  ] 's intention to review the situation before October 15 . 
USUN may draw on the points in paragraph 2 below. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Begin  ] points: --We thank Ambassador [PER Choi  ] for his briefing today , and again wish to express our appreciation for the continued dedication and hard work of the men and women of [LOC UNOCI.  ] --The [LOC United States  ] shares the frustration of our colleagues and , no doubt , of the [MISC Ivorian  ] people in the continued delays in preparations for the presidential and parliamentary elections. --We urge the parties to observe the timeline for the elections and to take the steps necessary to hold nationwide elections that will demonstrate [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] 's respect for democracy and commitment to the peace process. --It is critical that the elections be open , free , fair , and transparent . 
They should mark the first step into the next phase of [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] 's history , one in which all [MISC Ivorians  ] can participate in creating a free and prosperous society. --The [LOC United States  ] notes , as we did in July , that the [ORG UN Mission  ] in [LOC Liberia  ] is drawing down and that its ability to supplement [ORG UNOCI  ] 's support for the elections will only be available until the end of February , at the latest . 
Time is running out. --As we are all aware , along with delays in preparing for the elections , there have been delays in demobilization and creation of mixed brigades . 
We would appreciate Ambassador [PER Choi  ] 's comments on how this might affect security for the elections , and what alternatives are available . 
As I have said , [ORG UNMIL  ] 's support is available only for a limited time , at a level that has already been factored into the mission 's drawdown schedule. --We appreciate the invaluable contribution that Licorne makes to peace and security in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , and hope that it will continue to support [ORG UNOCI  ] as necessary. --The [LOC United States  ] would also like to express its concern about the recent reporting by the [ORG Sanctions Committee  ] 's Group of Experts that , despite some success , there are continuing violations of the arms embargo and diamond ban . 
Particularly when arms and diamonds are moving across borders , these violations pose a threat not only to [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] but also to its neighbors. --Only a few weeks ago the [ORG Council  ] made it clear that we are prepared to consider additional steps . 
The [LOC United States  ] underlines that our goal and that of all [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] 's friends is that the elections be held , and that they meet the standards and aspirations of the people .
