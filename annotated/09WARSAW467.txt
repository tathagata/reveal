END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Carl Levin  ] ( [MISC D-MI  ] ) , Senator [PER Bill Nelson  ] ( [MISC D-FL  ] ) , and Senator [PER Susan Collins  ] ( [MISC R-ME  ] ) , visited [LOC Warsaw  ] April 15-16 to discuss [LOC Missile Defense  ] and [MISC Polish  ] interest in a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Patriot  ] battery rotation with [MISC Polish  ] officials , including Prime Minister Tusk’s chief of staff [PER Slawomir Nowak  ] , Deputy Chief of President [ORG Kaczynski’s National Security Bureau  ] [PER Witold Waszczykowski  ] , and Parliamentary Speaker [PER Bronislaw Komorowski  ] ( [ORG Civic Platform  ] , [ORG PO  ] ) . 
The [MISC Senators’  ] meetings with Foreign Minister [PER Radoslaw Sikorski  ] and Deputy Defense Minister [PER Stanislaw Komorowski  ] are reported septel . 
[LOC U.S.  ] “ROCK SOLID” ON [ORG ARTICLE  ] FIVE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Levin  ] began all three meetings by conveying the President’s message that the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to the [ORG NATO Article  ] 5 guarantee is “rock solid.” While [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Poland  ] may differ in form under the [MISC Obama  ] administration , [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Poland  ] will be strong . 
When asked whether [LOC Warsaw  ] felt assured that [ORG NATO  ] would honor its [ORG Article  ] 5 commitments to [LOC Poland  ] , [PER Waszczykowski  ] said “we still have our doubts , ” adding that some [MISC European  ] members -- particularly [LOC France  ] -- prefer talk to action , he wryly added “that’s why we bought [MISC F-16s  ] and not [MISC French  ] Mirages , and why we went through with the [LOC Missile Defense  ] deal.” PATRIOTS AND [MISC AMERICAN  ] BOOTS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Levin  ] warned all three interlocutors that if the [MISC Czechs  ] reject the proposed [LOC MD  ] radar site , the [MISC Polish  ] component of [LOC MD  ] would be put in jeopardy under current [LOC U.S.  ] legislation . 
[PER Nowak  ] expressed confidence that the [MISC Czechs  ] would ratify the agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] , suggesting they are simply waiting for a [LOC U.S.  ] decision on [LOC MD  ] . 
Speaker [PER Komorowski  ] acknowledged the provisions of [LOC U.S.  ] law , but stated [LOC Poland  ] does not want to be responsible for [MISC Czech  ] problems . 
Senator [PER Collins  ] acknowledged the political cost to [LOC Poland  ] of supporting [LOC MD  ] , and asked for [PER Komorowski  ] , s views on how to maintain support for the [LOC United States  ] if it pursues a different course. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Asked whether [LOC Poland  ] would be reassured by the presence of [MISC Patriot  ] batteries in lieu of [LOC MD  ] , [PER Nowak  ] told [PER CODEL Levin  ] that , regardless of [MISC MD’s  ] fate , the [MISC GOP  ] expects the [ORG USG  ] to “honor its commitments” on [ORG Patriots  ] . 
[LOC Poland  ] intends to build a comprehensive air-defense system and has identified [ORG Patriots  ] as “the most important element” of its defense modernization efforts . 
[PER Nowak  ] said [LOC Poland  ] “will not suffer” if the [LOC U.S.  ] withdraws from [LOC MD  ] , but repeatedly asserted that the [MISC GOP  ] is “counting on [PER Patriots.”  ] ( NB: At one point , [PER Nowak  ] even intervened when his interpreter mistakenly said the [MISC Poles  ] “would like [PER Patriots.”  ] “No , we are counting on them , ” [PER Nowak  ] emphasized in [MISC English  ] . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Waszczykowski  ] was less adamant about [ORG Patriots  ] , stating that [LOC Poland  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] had a binding political agreement on security matters , which he hoped the [LOC United States  ] would respect . 
He added that [LOC Poland  ] “wants [LOC U.S.  ] boots on the ground” -- not necessarily as a tripwire , but as a deterrent . 
[PER Nowak  ] similarly stressed [MISC Poland’s  ] strong interest in “deepening” military cooperation , ideally to include a large [LOC U.S.  ] footprint in [LOC Poland  ] . 
He mused that one [MISC Patriot  ] battery and ten [LOC MD  ] interceptors do not constitute the “impressive presence” that [LOC Poland  ] is hoping for. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Speaker [PER Komorowski  ] and [PER Nowak  ] both pointed out that , by agreeing to host the [LOC MD  ] site , [LOC Poland  ] had paid a “high price” -- especially in its relations with other [ORG EU  ] members and with [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Komorowski  ] expressed concern that [LOC Poland  ] had again become a [MISC Russian  ] target after a dozen years of improving relations -- senior [MISC Russian  ] officials have threatened to target [LOC Poland  ] with nuclear missiles , are stirring up WARSAW 00000467 002 OF 002 anti-Polish sentiment among [MISC Russians  ] , and are acting against [MISC Poland’s  ] interests in [LOC Ukraine.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Komorowski  ] argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] needs to fulfill its symbolic agreement to show involvement in defense of [MISC Polish  ] territory . 
If the new administration is changing [LOC U.S.  ] political priorities , it also needs to engage in dialogue with [LOC Poland  ] , not just [LOC Russia  ] . 
Most important for [LOC Poland  ] is [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in [MISC Polish  ] security , through physical presence of [MISC American  ] forces in [LOC Poland  ] , [ORG NATO  ] facilities in [LOC Poland  ] , fulfilling the commitment to provide [MISC Patriot  ] missiles , and greater [MISC U.S.-Polish  ] cooperation . 
DIALOGUE WITH [LOC RUSSIA  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Komorowski  ] , [PER Nowak  ] , and [PER Waszczykowski  ] stressed the importance of keeping [LOC Poland  ] updated on the status of [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] talks . 
[PER Nowak  ] stressed the GOP’s strong interest in a positive outcome , but reminded the [ORG CODEL  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] negotiators had promised the [ORG USG  ] would overcome [MISC Russian  ] objections to [LOC MD.  ] “The [LOC MD  ] site is an [MISC American  ] base . 
The burden of achieving [MISC Russian  ] agreement is on the [LOC U.S.  ] side , ” he said . 
Even so , [PER Nowak  ] said , [LOC Poland  ] had agreed to accept confidence-building measures with the [MISC Russians  ] and was also working to convince [LOC Moscow  ] that [LOC MD  ] is not a threat to Russia’s nuclear arsenal . 
Regardless , [LOC Russia  ] will find it difficult to accept any “tangible manifestation” of a [ORG NATO  ] presence in [LOC Poland  ] or the [LOC Czech Republic.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Nowak  ] said [LOC Poland  ] had not discussed [ORG Patriots  ] with the [MISC Russians  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] should not have a say in [MISC Poland’s  ] defense modernization planning . 
Noting that [MISC Poland’s  ] armed forces are “defensive in nature , ” [PER Nowak  ] reiterated that [MISC Poland’s  ] primary goal is to increase interoperability with allies. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG Presidential Advisor Waszczykowski  ] reacted more emotionally . 
While [LOC Washington  ] is entitled to talk to [LOC Russia  ] , to work toward a solution to the [MISC Iranian  ] threat , and to make its own decision about the [LOC MD  ] initiative , the [LOC U.S.  ] should take care not to undermine [MISC Poland’s  ] security . 
He then wondered aloud , “How long will it take you to realize that nothing will change with [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Russia  ] ? ” [PER Waszczykowski  ] asserted that [LOC Moscow  ] is trying to regain its sphere of influence and stressed the critical importance of an increased [LOC U.S.  ] or [ORG NATO  ] presence for [MISC Poland’s  ] security . 
He added that [LOC Russia  ] continues to deny its historical wrong-doings against [LOC Poland  ] , imposes economic sanctions against [LOC Poland  ] at will , and frequently disrupts the flow of oil and gas . 
THREAT FROM [LOC IRAN  ] ? <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In all three meetings , Senator [PER Nelson  ] expressed doubt that [LOC Iran  ] would abandon its nuclear weapons or missile programs , but noted that the [MISC Iranian  ] threat to [LOC Europe  ] could be met for the foreseeable future with the [ORG AEGIS  ] and THAAD systems . 
[PER Waszczykowski  ] , who served as [ORG Poland’s  ] Ambassador to [LOC Tehran  ] ( 1999-2002 ) , agreed that [LOC Iran  ] poses an increasing threat to the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
He said that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime has no incentive to warm relations with [LOC Washington  ] because the regime has built its own legitimacy on the cornerstone of anti-Americanism. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Nowak  ] and [PER Komorowski  ] told the [ORG CODEL  ] that [LOC Poland  ] does not perceive a direct threat from [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Nowak  ] stated that , as an active and loyal ally , [LOC Poland  ] had agreed to host the [LOC MD  ] site because of the threat [LOC Iran  ] poses to the [LOC U.S.  ] and others in [ORG NATO  ] . 
He noted that [MISC Poland’s  ] desire to be a strong ally was also the basis for its activity in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Nowak  ] said [LOC Poland  ] perceives a greater threat from non-state actors , but conceded that Iran’s support for terrorist organizations was troubling . 
He added that [MISC Poland’s  ] decision to host [LOC MD  ] had moved it “closer to the top of Iran’s list , ” and , as a result , made [ORG Patriots  ] more important to [MISC Poland’s  ] security. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) [PER CODEL Levin  ] has cleared this message .
