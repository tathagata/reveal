Stephen Beecroft  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) SUMMARY: The Chairman 's visit comes at a time when [LOC Jordan  ] has made significant contributions both in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and to broader regional security: encouraging [LOC Syria  ] to seek a moderate [MISC Arab  ] alternative to [MISC Iranian  ] influence , maintaining its focus on a two-state solution to the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict , and redoubling its efforts to strengthen ties with [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
At the same time , [LOC Amman  ] perceives [LOC U.S.  ] military financial support as not keeping pace with the level of [MISC Jordanian  ] regional contributions . 
Despite the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding on foreign assistance agreeing on an annual commitment of $300 million in Foreign Military Financing ( [ORG FMF  ] ) through 2014 , [LOC Jordan  ] continues to seek additional assistance in the form of supplemental appropriations . 
In 2009 [LOC Jordan  ] was successful in obtaining $150 million in forward-financed assistance in this manner , directly reducing our [ORG FMF  ] commitment for 2010 . 
[LOC Jordan  ] has so far been disappointed with our lack of commitment to leave behind or store military equipment redeploying through [LOC Jordan  ] from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Middle East Peace  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] continues to play a central role in fostering [LOC Middle East  ] peace and a two-state solution to the [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] conflict . 
Both the King and his Foreign Minister [PER Naser Joudeh  ] have maintained steady pressure on other [MISC Arab  ] states to offer modest deliverables to [LOC Israel  ] . 
The King 's efforts , which have met with some success , seek tangible steps such as overflight permission for [MISC Israeli  ] air traffic , linking telecommunications networks with [LOC Israel  ] , and reducing restrictions on travelers who have transited [LOC Israel  ] . 
Recently however , the King has adopted a new approach , pressing PM [PER Netanyahu  ] and President [PER Abbas  ] to initiate immediate negotiations aimed at producing even limited [MISC Israeli  ] concessions . 
Positive progress at the negotiating table , however meager , could provide crucial political cover for [PER Abu Mazen  ] , affording him a measure of maneuverability. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Given his public backing of [LOC U.S.  ] attempts to restart [LOC Middle East Peace  ] negotiations , the King views the lack of progress as damaging to his credibility . 
This damage could limit his ability to play a constructive role in the future . 
At the same time , [MISC Jordanian  ] officials consistently express concern that [LOC Jordan  ] will be asked to assume a degree of guardianship over the [LOC West Bank  ] , a move which many believe would alter [LOC Jordan  ] 's demographic makeup in ways that directly threaten its Hashemite rule , and consequently , the interests of the [LOC East Bank  ] elites . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Jordan  ] has been a leader in engaging with [LOC Iraq  ] , using engagement to promote bilateral trade and encouraging [LOC Iraq  ] to build stronger ties with [MISC Arab  ] states rather than with [LOC Iran  ] . 
As evidence of the proactive [MISC Jordanian  ] position the King became the first [MISC Arab  ] Head of State to visit [LOC Baghdad  ] , in July 2008 , and has named an Ambassador to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The King supports Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] and sees progress as slow , but moving in the right direction . 
Senior [MISC Jordanian  ] leaders have become concerned that increasing tensions between the central government and the [ORG Kurdistan Region  ] will erupt in violent conflict and are skeptical that [LOC Iraq  ] can maintain stability as [LOC U.S.  ] forces withdraw. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In response to a request by General Odierno to provide capacity-building assistance to the [ORG Iraqi Ministries of Defense and Interior  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] has hosted visits of [MISC Iraqi  ] officers to learn about border security operations on the [MISC Syrian  ] border and observe military cooperation through joint [LOC AMMAN  ] 00000329 002 OF 005 exercises with [ORG CENTCOM  ] . 
[LOC Jordan  ] hosted [MISC Iraqis  ] at two 2009 seminars aimed at building the [MISC Iraqi  ] capacity to manage their own Foreign Military Sales workload . 
[LOC Jordan  ] has also said it will send a [ORG Defense Attach  ] to [LOC Baghdad  ] , but has not yet made plans to do so. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] signed a [MISC Technical Agreement  ] with [ORG CENTCOM  ] in July , laying the groundwork for redeployment of [LOC U.S.  ] forces and equipment from [LOC Iraq  ] through [LOC Jordan  ] . 
In November , the first set of [LOC U.S.  ] Brigade Combat Team ( [MISC BCT  ] ) equipment redeployed through [LOC Jordan  ] , signaling an appreciable increase in throughput with additional [MISC BCT  ] sets redeploying in December and January . 
Over the course of the next six months , seven additional [MISC BCT  ] sets of equipment are scheduled to transit [LOC Jordan  ] en route to the port of [LOC Aqaba  ] and ultimately to the [LOC U.S.  ] Redeployment represents a significant boon to the [MISC Jordanian  ] economy: $15.1M in 2009 . 
The military and political leadership of [LOC Jordan  ] has been frustrated that the [LOC U.S.  ] has not committed to leave equipment behind in [LOC Jordan  ] to be donated , refurbished , or stored . 
Two further disappointments include the termination of jet fuel shipments through [LOC Jordan  ] into [MISC Western  ] [LOC Iraq  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] decision not to train [MISC Iraqi F-16  ] pilots in [MISC Jordanian  ] flight schools . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] is concerned about [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region , particularly the potentially destabilizing effect of an [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , support for [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] , support for the [MISC Huthi  ] and other armed groups in [LOC Yemen  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] 's role in [LOC Iraq  ] and links with [LOC Syria  ] . 
The King believes that the recent post-election violence in [LOC Iran  ] exposes deep fissures in the [MISC Iranian  ] polity that " makes the Supreme Leader look a bit less supreme , " forcing [LOC Iran  ] 's leadership to turn inward on domestic issues and limiting their freedom and resources to act internationally . 
Especially with the recent buildup of [LOC U.S.  ] military assets in the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] , fear remains that [LOC Iran  ] will try to counter these perceptions with a dramatic act . 
[LOC Jordan  ] will support new [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] , but will be loath to enforce those sanctions in the absence of progress in the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
Without a material improvement in the [LOC Peace Process  ] , any confrontation with [LOC Iran  ] risks backlash from [MISC Palestinian  ] groups who cast [LOC Tehran  ] as their protector. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG Jordan  ] 's senior leadership draws a direct link between the willingness of [MISC Arab  ] states to counter [LOC Iran  ] , and progress on [LOC Middle East  ] peace , saying that [MISC Israeli  ] and [MISC Sunni-Arab  ] interests are perfectly aligned with respect to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Arab  ] governments are restricted in their ability to deal with [LOC Iran  ] , they say , so long as [LOC Iran  ] is seen as supporting the [MISC Palestinians  ] against [LOC Israel  ] . 
Realization of the two-state solution would consolidate the regional consensus against [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] believes . 
[LOC Syria  ] ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] increased its engagement with [LOC Syria  ] in the last half of 2009 attempting to draw [LOC Damascus  ] toward an alignment with moderate [MISC Arab  ] states and away from [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
The King and [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar Al Assad  ] met at least four times in 2009 , which resulted in agreements on a number of initiatives , including border demarcation , customs procedures , and commercial transport . 
Although [MISC Jordanian  ] officials continue to be skeptical of [MISC Syrian  ] intentions to follow through , [LOC Jordan  ] is supported in its dialogue with [LOC Syria  ] by [LOC Turkey  ] , which is interested in increasing its ground transit of commercial goods through [LOC Syria  ] to [LOC Gulf  ] countries . 
[LOC AMMAN  ] 00000329 003 OF 005 Domestic Politics ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) King [PER Abdullah  ] dissolved the unpopular Parliament and announced a new Cabinet in December 2009 , ending months of infighting and legislative stalemate . 
The King has mandated that new elections take place before the end of 2010 with a new election law currently being drafted . 
It is unclear whether the new law will correct the disproportionate districting that systematically under represents urban [MISC Palestinian-Jordanians  ] in Parliament . 
The current electoral system favors rural , traditionally [MISC East-Bank  ] districts , over the cities . 
It is too soon to tell by how much the numbers might shift or how tribal or traditional [LOC East Bank  ] interests would be affected. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) We have been urging the [MISC Jordanians  ] to re-invigorate social and political reforms , expanding political space for civil society , pressing electoral changes aimed at a more representative , inclusive system , and further loosening of state control over the economy . 
The King 's economic and political changes face domestic opposition from tribal leaders and an array of entrenched [LOC East Bank  ] interests . 
The latter include many in the military , security services , and bureaucracy , who enjoy a disproportionate share of the current system. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG Jordan  ] has made progress on the economic front: buying back debt , eliminating subsidies , and promoting a trade-based , market-oriented economy . 
The positive effects of those measures are starting to wane , in part , a ramification of the global financial crisis , but also due to poor budget management and poor management of its limited water and energy resources . 
[ORG Jordan  ] is one of the world 's most water-poor nations and is moving aggressively on independent and regional initiatives to address its water needs . 
[ORG GAMA  ] , a [MISC Turkish  ] company partially owned by General Electric was awarded an $800 million contract to pump water from [LOC Southern Jordan  ] 's Disi aquifer to [LOC Amman  ] . 
While a [MISC World Bank-led  ] study continues on conveying water from the [LOC Red Sea  ] to the [LOC Dead Sea  ] to rehabilitate the [LOC Dead Sea  ] , generate hydropower , and provide desalinated water to [ORG Jordan  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , and the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , [ORG Jordan  ] announced in May 2009 , similar plans for the unilateral $10 billion [ORG Jordan Red Sea Development Project  ] to bene fit [ORG Jordan  ] only . 
[ORG Jordan  ] has yet to secure the requisite funding to begin the single-country project. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG Jordan  ] 's economy is also affected by its energy needs . 
[ORG Jordan  ] is a net importer of energy and thus subject to market fluctuations for oil prices . 
It imports some of its fuel needs from [LOC Iraq  ] , but poor infrastructure limits import quantities , which must travel overland by tanker truck . 
Consequently , the discount offered barely offsets transportation costs . 
Since 2003 , [ORG Jordan  ] has paid market rate for other imported fuel . 
[ORG Jordan  ] sees nuclear energy as its future and the King has placed a priority on developing a civilian nuclear energy program . 
The [ORG GOJ  ] is anxious to sign a [ORG Nuclear Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG NCA  ] ) with the [LOC United States  ] , required for [LOC U.S.  ] companies to provide nuclear reactors , fuel or materials . 
[ORG NCA  ] negotiations are currently stalled however , with the Chairman of the [ORG Jordan Atomic Energy Commission  ] objecting to assurances sought by the [LOC U.S.  ] that [ORG Jordan  ] will not refine or enrich uranium in [ORG Jordan  ] . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG GOJ  ] continues to advance its nuclear energy program and has signed either MOUs or NCAs with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC South Korea  ] , the [LOC UK  ] , and a number of other countries . 
[ORG Military Assistance and Cooperation  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [MISC U.S.-Jordan  ] mil-to-mil relationship is among the most extensive in the region . 
In September 2008 , an MOU on Foreign Assistance was signed with [ORG Jordan  ] that included a [LOC AMMAN  ] 00000329 004 OF 005 commitment to $300 million annually in Foreign Military Financing ( [ORG FMF  ] ) through 2014 . 
In 2009 [ORG Congress  ] allocated $150 million ( of the $300 million ) in forward-financed [ORG FMF  ] to [ORG Jordan  ] through the [ORG Supplemental Appropriation  ] ( which will reduce the [ORG FMF  ] commitment for 2010 by an equal amount . 
) In January , [ORG Jordan  ] 's top military advisor , Prince [PER Faisal  ] , and Minister of Planning met Defense and [ORG State Department  ] officials and Members of [ORG Congress  ] in [LOC Washington  ] aimed at securing a pledge of funds through an anticipated [LOC Afghanistan  ] supplemental appropriation . 
Although these assistance levels are substantial , [ORG Jordan  ] is sensitive to decreases in [ORG FMF  ] from the height of the war in [LOC Iraq  ] when [ORG Jordan  ] received large supplemental appropriations . 
For example , combined [ORG FMF  ] was $497 million in 2008 , $307 million in 2007 , and $305 million in 2006. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) In addition to [ORG FMF  ] , [ORG Jordan  ] is one of the largest recipients of [ORG Individual Military Education and Training  ] ( [ORG IMET  ] ) funding , which will be $3.8M in 2010 and $3.7M in <a id='par2011' href='#par2011'>¶</a>2011 . 
The program pays immense dividends , developing strong professional bonds between [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG JAF  ] officer corps. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [ORG Jordan  ] makes significant contributions to [LOC U.S.  ] regional security priorities . 
In July 2009 , [ORG Jordan  ] deployed a 712-soldier Ranger Battalion to [LOC Logar Province  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to provide election security ( [ORG TF  ] 222 ) . 
The [ORG JAF  ] deployed the second battalion rotation in support of OEF in January 2010 , despite the cost ( pay entitlements ) and risk to their soldiers' safety . 
[ORG JAF  ] leaders have intimated that they would advocate even larger-scale deployments ( a brigade ) , if the pay/entitlement expense were not so burdensome . 
In fact , during the [ORG Joint Military Commission  ] in November 2009 , [PER MG Mash'al Al Zaben  ] , Chief of Staff for Strategy , stated that [ORG Jordan  ] would stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] until the last [LOC U.S.  ] soldier came home . 
In October , [ORG Jordan  ] deployed the second rotation of a [ORG Special Operations  ] company ( [ORG TF  ] 111 ) that conducts combat operations alongside [ORG U.S. Special Forces  ] . 
The third rotational company deploys in February 2010. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Following the December 30 suicide bombing by a [MISC Jordanian  ] national in [LOC Khost  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [ORG Jordan  ] has experienced increased calls by opposition groups and non-governmental figures to explain its [LOC Afghanistan  ] assistance and end its security cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
So far , such calls and commentary in the press have received no traction with the government , which vigorously and publically defends its efforts to combat terrorism . 
[MISC Jordanian  ] government officials have privately reiterated the commitment to maintaining their relationship with us , highlighting their deployments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and elsewhere. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) In May , [ORG Jordan  ] completed a donation of 10 M60 tanks to [LOC Lebanon  ] , funded by [LOC UAE  ] . 
[ORG Jordan  ] delivered to [LOC Yemen  ] 25 [ORG M113 Armored Personnel Carriers  ] in response to a request from [ORG State Department  ] , funded by [LOC UAE  ] . 
[ORG Jordan  ] has offered to assist with other deployments , counter-piracy missions , and to host training courses and exercises for [MISC Iraqi  ] , [MISC Lebanese  ] , and other forces , but remains dependent on external financial support to fund its contributions . 
[ORG Jordan  ] continues to supply forces to [ORG U.N.  ] sponsored [ORG Peace-Keeping Operations  ] around the world. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) . 
[ORG Jordan  ] is anxious to provide additional contributions to the fight in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and made this clear during HRH Prince [PER Feisal  ] 's recent trip to [LOC Washington  ] . 
OSD , Joint Staff and [ORG CENTCOM  ] are reviewing their proposals. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Despite the high levels of [ORG FMF  ] and other security assistance , [ORG Jordan  ] continues to request additional financial resources from external sources to make each contribution to regional security possible . 
For example , the [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] donations were financed with funds from the [LOC UAE  ] . 
Training programs for regional forces are financed through [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Anti-Terrorist Assistance  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) funds or the [ORG U.S. Security Coordinator  ] ( [ORG USSC  ] ) . 
In addition , [MISC Jordanian  ] law stipulates that its soldiers deployed overseas are entitled [LOC AMMAN  ] 00000329 005 OF 005 to approximately $1,700 monthly in combat pay , which has been financed through the [ORG United Nations  ] for peacekeeping operations . 
[ORG Jordan  ] has not yet identified a source of combat pay funding for its [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployments but is hopeful [ORG NATO  ] will contribute. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Jordan  ] has used its [ORG FMF  ] to improve its border security and defensive capabilities remaining cognizant of interoperability with [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
We are concerned that [ORG Jordan  ] has focused too heavily on acquiring expensive new technology and needs to place more emphasis on the training and maintenance needs of existing programs .
