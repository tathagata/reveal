1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Icelandic  ] economic crisis worsened as the last ( and largest ) of the big three banks , [ORG Kaupthing  ] , was taken over by the [MISC Icelandic  ] government ; the [MISC Icelandic  ] stock exchange was shut down until Monday ; one-third of [ORG Landsbanki  ] employees were fired ; and two new entities were created to take over domestic operations of the former [ORG Landsbanki  ] and [ORG Glitnir  ] banks . 
The possibility of a [MISC Russian  ] loan continues to generate GOI assertions that finances and foreign policy can be kept separate . 
The Prime Minister stated that the [MISC Icelandic  ] government had not asked for a loan from the [ORG IMF  ] , but discussions continue in [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
The Minister of Finance travels to [LOC Washington  ] today , and his meeting at the [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] Friday will be important in focusing the Icelanders on a viable way through this disaster . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Chairman of [ORG Kaupthing Bank 's Board  ] , [PER Sigurdur Einarsson  ] , blamed [MISC British  ] authorities for [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] ( [ORG FME  ] ) take over of [ORG Kaupthing  ] in the early hours of October <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
The [ORG FME  ] , which used the new emergency legislation authority , asserted that the takeover will insure continued commercial bank operations in [LOC Iceland  ] and that [ORG Kaupthing  ] 's domestic deposits are fully guaranteed . 
[PER Einarsson  ] said the [MISC British  ] authorities' October 8 seizure of [ORG Kaupthing Edge  ] deposit accounts valued at 3 billion pounds , and the forced suspension of payments of [ORG Kaupthing  ] 's subsidiary in [LOC London  ] , had been interpreted as a technical default on loans by [ORG Kaupthing  ] 's creditors . 
The [MISC British  ] apparently invoked anti-terrorism laws created in the aftermath of 9/11 to freeze [MISC Icelandic  ] assets in the [LOC UK  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] media is reporting that [LOC UK  ] Chancellor Darling took this action after a miscommunication with Minister of Finance [PER Arni Mathiesen  ] over whether [ORG Landsbanki  ] 's IceSave accounts in the [LOC UK  ] would be guaranteed by the [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities . 
The association with terrorism has infuriated [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] closed its stock exchange this morning . 
An official statement from the [ORG OMS Stock Exchange  ] said , " Due to unusual market conditions [ORG NASDAQ  ] OMX [LOC Iceland  ] has decided to suspend temporarily trading on its equity markets . 
The equity markets will re-open for trading on Monday , October 13 . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite assurances yesterday by the Minister of [LOC Commerce  ] and the Minister of Finance that bank employees would not lose their jobs , [ORG Landsbanki  ] fired one-third of its employees today . 
This will likely impact the unemployment rate by close to half a percentage point . 
The [ORG FME  ] created two new bank entities " [ORG New Landsbanki Island  ] , hf " and " [ORG New Glitnir Bank  ] , hf " to conduct the domestic operations of their predecessor banks. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russian  ] loan is still part of [LOC Iceland  ] 's plan . 
Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] said last night that the loans from the [ORG IMF  ] and [LOC Russia  ] " are not mutually exclusive " though the government had not asked [ORG IMF  ] for a standby loan or an economic program . 
He repeated that statement in a press conference today . 
Questions about the influence the loan might give [LOC Russia  ] continue to be met by assertions that finances and foreign policy can and will be kept separate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Minister of Finance [PER Arni Mathiesen  ] travels to [LOC Washington  ] tonight for [ORG World Bank  ] meetings . 
Post persuaded the Minister to agree to meet with senior [ORG Treasury  ] officials while in the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Mathiesen  ] will meet with [ORG Treasury A/S Clay Lowery  ] on October 10 . 
We would hope this meeting will help the Icelanders think their way through the present crisis and move from a stopgap reactive approach to a durable comprehensive plan . 
It should also make clear to them how the [LOC U.S.  ] can and cannot be of assistance and point them in the direction of other options. van Voorst</pre></code>
