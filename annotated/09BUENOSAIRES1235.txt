( C ) [MISC Summary: Over  ] the past six weeks , we have held several conversations with President [PER Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] 's first two [ORG Cabinet Chiefs  ] , [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] and [PER Sergio Massa  ] . 
Both believe that the [LOC Kirchners  ] , despite their recent political successes , cannot win re-election in 2011 . 
They disagree on whom is next in line: [PER Fernandez  ] thinks that the next President will be Vice President [PER Julio Cobos  ] , while [PER Massa  ] believes that Senator [PER Carlos Reutemann  ] will prevail . 
Both ex-Cabinet chiefs are ( separately ) plotting their futures in a post-Kirchner political landscape . 
[PER Massa  ] expanded on earlier comments to us ( ref a ) on life with the [LOC Kirchners  ] , describing ex-president [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] as a " monster " and a " psychopath . 
" End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We have had several conversations with the first two [ORG Cabinet Chiefs  ] of [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) , [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] and [PER Sergio Massa  ] . 
The Ambassador had an introductory meeting with [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] , who served as Cabinet Chief in both [PER Nestor  ] and [ORG CFK  ] 's administrations , on October 28 , and [ORG DCM  ] lunched with [PER Fernandez  ] on October 2 . 
The Ambassador and [ORG DCM  ] also had dinner with [ORG CFK  ] 's second cabinet chief [PER Sergio Massa  ] and his wife , city councilor-elect [PER Malena Galmarini  ] , at the home of [PER Massa  ] 's former [PER Casa Rosada  ] aide , businessman [PER Jorge O'Reilly  ] , on November <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
In each of these conversations , the two prominent [MISC Peronists  ] , who during their tenures in the [PER Casa Rosada  ] worked every day with the [LOC Kirchners  ] to run the [MISC Argentine  ] government , were quite frank in expressing their estrangement from the [LOC Kirchners  ] and their pessimism about the first couple 's political prospects . 
[PER Alberto  ] and [PER Massa  ] Agree: [LOC Kirchners  ] Will Lose in 2011 <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] said that the [LOC Kirchners  ] have no chance to capture the presidency in 2011 . 
When asked to estimate their chances , [PER Massa  ] replied , " zero . 
" He also discounted the view that the [LOC Kirchners  ] would extend their rule through [MISC Chavez-style  ] governance . 
[PER Massa  ] said that , for all of its problems , [LOC Argentina  ] is not [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Its society remained too literate , too middle class , and too " temperate , " and its economy is far more complex and diverse than [LOC Venezuela  ] 's oil monoculture . 
[LOC Argentina  ] , he said , would not abide the [PER Kirchner  ] 's attempts to consolidate power through more autocratic rule . 
The result of their hardball tactics after the midterm elections , he argued , was even more negative ratings in the polls. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Fernandez  ] predicted that [PER Nestor  ] would be the [MISC Kirchners'  ] presidential candidate in 2011 . 
He claimed that [PER Nestor  ] has a better reputation for competence than [ORG CFK  ] . 
[PER Fernandez  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that his soundings on [ORG CFK  ] 's potential run for re-election invariably provoked reactions of alarm and exasperation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) But [PER Nestor  ] cannot possibly win , continued [PER Fernandez  ] , comparing the former president to [PER Carlos Menem  ] circa 1999 . 
He said that , like [PER Menem  ] ten years ago , [PER Kirchner  ] could hope for no more than 20 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election . 
These voters , he continued , are [PER Kirchner  ] " fundamentalists " whose votes reflect ideological affinity or association with the various political machines ( controlled by piqueteros , labor leaders , etc . 
) that remain loyal to the [PER Kirchner  ] project . 
[PER Fernandez  ] said that , because [PER Kirchner  ] at this point in his political career has zero attraction to independent voters , he could expect to win no more votes in the second round of elections than he would in the first . 
[PER Fernandez  ] predicted that [PER Nestor  ] would run and [ORG CFK  ] would increasingly govern from the [LOC Left  ] , as that " is the only constituency that remains to them . 
" He added , though , that such a strategy was doomed to fail -- " the [LOC Left  ] on its own can't elect anyone to the Presidency in this country , " he said . 
[PER Alberto  ] and [PER Massa  ] Disagree on Next President <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] identified [ORG Santa Fe  ] Senator [PER Carlos Reutemann  ] as the likely presidential winner in 2011 . 
He said that [PER Reutemann  ] 's strategy of lying low was prudent , not a blunder or sign of indecision as often portrayed in the press . 
With [PER Reutemann  ] quiet , the [PER Kirchner  ] machine was focused on pummeling Vice President [PER Cobos  ] and [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Mayor [PER Mauricio Macri  ] . 
The onslaught , he argued , would damage both of those potential opponents to a [PER Reutemann  ] candidacy . 
When the race really begins , [PER Reutemann  ] would be well-placed to obtain the [MISC Peronist  ] nomination and steamroll the rest of the field . 
[PER Massa  ] said that the [MISC Peronist  ] race would not begin in earnest until May 1 , 2010 , when he said five large [MISC Peronist  ] rallies would mark May Day for the first time in years. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] identified Vice President [PER Cobos  ] as the next president of [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[PER Fernandez  ] noted that [PER Cobos  ] continues to be the most popular politician in the country , and is conserving his advantage intelligently . 
He expected that Coalicion [MISC Civica  ] leader [PER Elisa Carrio  ] , the runner-up in the 2007 election and a bitter rival of [PER Cobos  ] , would run in the first round and win a maximum of 12 percent of the vote , deflating the Vice President 's first-round numbers , but [PER Cobos  ] would come out on top . 
" It 's his election to lose , " concluded [PER Fernandez  ] . 
He took issue with [PER Massa  ] 's view that [MISC Peronists  ] would prevail once they united behind a candidate . 
[PER Fernandez  ] , a long-time [MISC Peronist  ] activist who headed the party apparatus in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] city for many years , said that his party only controls the loyalty of 38 percent of the electorate . 
Given the [MISC Kirchners'  ] continuing control over the party apparatus , the [MISC Peronist  ] candidate , even if it ends up being someone with a last name that is not [PER Kirchner  ] , would not appeal to non-Peronist voters in 2011 . 
The party 's presidential prospects in the coming election were therefore , in [PER Fernandez  ] 's view , poor . 
[PER Massa: Nestor  ] is a Monster and Psychopath <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] was scathing in his criticism of the first couple , especially [PER Nestor  ] . 
Though he made light of press reports that he and [PER Kirchner  ] came to blows at the campaign bunker in the pre-dawn hours after their mid-term defeat last June , he called [PER Nestor  ] " a psychopath , " " a monster , " and " a coward " whose bullying approach to politics masks a deep sense of insecurity and inferiority . 
( [PER Massa  ] 's wife registered such alarm at these uninhibited comments that he asked her to " stop making faces at me . 
" ) He disputed the argument that [PER Nestor  ] deserved credit as a savvy tactician , describing the ex-president as blunder-prone and so convinced of his own brilliance that he was certain to keep making mistakes . 
( We 've heard similar comments from [PER Fernandez  ] on [PER Nestor  ] 's faltering political judgment -- ref b . 
) He said that [PER Nestor  ] could not relate to others outside the narrow gauge of his own political ambitions: " [PER Kirchner  ] 's not a perverse genius , " [PER Massa  ] concluded . 
" He is just perverse . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] described his twelve-month term as Cabinet Chief as an ordeal , as he struggled to deal with a controlling presidential spouse and a " submissive , withdrawn " President " who would be much better without [PER Nestor  ] than she is with him . 
" He said that , during his tenure at the [LOC Casa Rosada  ] , he decided to do the [MISC Oprah-like  ] daytime TV show hosted by grand dame [PER Mirtha Legrand  ] . 
On the set minutes before the show 's taping began , he received a call from [PER Nestor  ] instructing him to walk off the set because the apolitical [PER Legrand  ] " was an opposition figure . 
" [PER Massa  ] told him he would do the show unless his official boss [ORG CFK  ] , who was travelling abroad , instructed him otherwise . 
He then received three successive calls from Cabinet members pleading with him not to do the show . 
[PER Massa  ] did not follow their advice . 
Both Focusing on [MISC Post-Kirchner Future  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As for his own plans , [PER Massa  ] confirmed that he plans to run in 2011 for governor of [LOC Buenos Aires  ] province , which could pit him against midterm winner [PER Francisco de Narvaez  ] , incumbent [PER Daniel Scioli  ] and labor strongman [PER Hugo Moyano  ] . 
[PER Massa  ] said that he will announce his candidacy on the third week of January , the week when ( largely vacationing ) [MISC Argentines  ] buy the most newspapers . 
[PER Fernandez  ] also commented on the [LOC Buenos Aires  ] race , opining that [PER Scioli  ] 's political moment had passed . 
Calling the governor " a nice guy , " he observed that [PER Nestor  ] had used him ( by grabbing him as his slate-mate in the province during the midterms ) and then cast him aside . 
" [PER Scioli  ] is trapped , and he knows it , " [PER Fernandez  ] said. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Fernandez  ] remains politically active as well . 
He told the [ORG DCM  ] that he is talking to many political figures within and outside [PER Peronism  ] , including [PER Cobos  ] and the fellow would-be [MISC Peronist  ] kingmaker , ex-President [PER Eduardo Duhalde  ] . 
Within the party , he expressed particular interest in the 40-year-old governor of [LOC Salta  ] province [PER Juan Manuel Urtubey  ] . 
He said that , despite his belief that [PER Cobos  ] is likely to win the presidency , he is counseling [PER Urtubey  ] to throw his hat in the ring . 
He says that the campaign strategy would be to nudge [PER Nestor  ] out in the first round for second place , and then emerge as the [MISC Peronist  ] candidate in the run-off against [PER Cobos  ] . 
( Comment: It appears that [PER Urtubey  ] , once regarded as a reliable [PER Kirchner  ] ally , is listening . 
He agreed to host [PER Fernandez  ] in a much-photographed visit to [LOC Salta  ] on November 14 , fueling speculation that the two were plotting a presidential run . 
) Comment: Common Views , Divergent Paths <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Massa  ] and [PER Fernandez  ] have much in common , from their unique experience in [ORG CFK  ] 's cabinet to their active roles in the burgeoning anti-Kirchner movement within [PER Peronism  ] . 
They are both generally pro-American in orientation . 
They do not , however , work together very closely , and their futures seem quite different . 
[PER Fernandez  ] , 50 , is low-key and content to operate in the background while others take the spotlight . 
The most that he seems to aspire to is success in behind-the-scenes political kingmaking , which could restore him to his former status as the country 's most influential political consigliore . 
[PER Massa  ] , 37 , the younger man by more than a decade , has more ambitious plans . 
He hopes to win the [LOC Buenos Aires  ] governorship and , eventually , the [MISC Argentine  ] presidency .
