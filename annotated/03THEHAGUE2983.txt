Daly  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b and d ) ( C ) : [PER PolOff  ] delivered reftel points to [MISC Dutch  ] MFA Director of UN Political and [ORG Judicial Affairs  ] Pieter [PER Ramaer  ] on November <a id='par28' href='#par28'>Â¶</a>28 . 
[PER Ramaer  ] said the [ORG EU  ] cannot technically oppose the convening of an [ORG Emergency Special Session  ] of the General Assembly , apart from conveying that the session is not timely . 
[PER Ramaer  ] said he cannot imagine the [ORG EU  ] will go along with the [MISC Palestinian  ] challenge to [MISC Israeli  ] credentials . 
Personally speaking , he said the challenge to [MISC Israeli  ] credentials doesn't stand a chance , and is just a mechanism to draw attention to [MISC Palestinian  ] and [MISC Arab  ] frustration . 
Regarding the request to seek an [ORG International Court of Justice  ] ( [ORG ICJ  ] ) opinion on the legality of the [MISC Israeli  ] separation barrier , [PER Ramaer  ] noted the [MISC Dutch  ] are not enthusiastic about the [ORG ICJ  ] and agree with the [LOC U.S.  ] that bringing [ORG ICJ  ] into the peace process will only complicate matters . 
He said he cannot yet predict what the [ORG EU  ] will do if in fact the [ORG ICJ  ] resolution comes to a vote , but made it clear there is a preference for keeping the [ORG ICJ  ] out of the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
[PER Ramaer  ] said he agrees with the [LOC U.S.  ] points regarding the [ORG Committee  ] on the Exercise of the [ORG Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  ] , but thinks the [ORG EU  ] consensus will be for abstention with an explanatory vote like last year . 
He asked for more time to check with his MFA and [LOC New York  ] colleagues about the [ORG Division of Palestinian Rights  ] , agreeing to contact [PER PolOff  ] on Monday with any further information .
