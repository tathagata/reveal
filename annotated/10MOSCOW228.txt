<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 000228 SIPDIS STATE FOR EUR/RUS , EEB TREASURY FOR TORGERSON/WRIGHT NSC FOR MCFAUL WHITE HOUSE FOR USTR EHAFNER E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 01/28/2020 TAGS: <a href='/tag/EINV_0.html'>EINV</a> <a href='/tag/ETRD_0.html'>ETRD</a> <a href='/tag/RS_0.html'>RS</a> SUBJECT: [MISC RUSSIAN  ] DRAFT BILL WOULD REQUIRE ON-SHORE CREDIT CARD PROCESSING REF: [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00079 Classified By: ECONMINCOUNS [PER Matthias Mitman  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The latest version of the [MISC Russian  ] draft law " On the [ORG National Payment System  ] " contains several provisions that would disadvantage [LOC U.S.  ] businesses . 
The draft law would set up a [ORG National Payment Card System  ] ( [ORG NPCS  ] ) including its own payment card that banks and payment card companies could join voluntarily . 
Most likely to be a consortium of state-owned banks , the [ORG NPCS  ] operator would process the domestic payments for all members and collect processing fees estimated at $4 billion per year . 
The draft also forbids sending abroad any payment data for domestic transactions . 
Should international payment card companies such as [ORG Visa  ] and [ORG MasterCard  ] chose not to join the [ORG NPCS  ] they would have to set up the infrastructure to do their [MISC Russian  ] payment processing domestically . 
END SUMMARY . 
2 . 
( C ) On January 27 , the [MISC Russian  ] newspaper [ORG Kommersant  ] reported that it had received a copy of the " final " version of the draft legislation " On the [ORG National Payment System  ] . 
" [ORG Visa  ] 's Public Relations head [PER XXXX  ] [PER XXXX  ] , who along with [ORG MasterCard  ] representatives met [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] officials on January 22 , told us that MinFin is still seeking consent from the various ministries and agencies involved in the legislation . 
[PER XXXX  ] reported that Deputy Finance Minister [PER Svyatugin  ] leads MinFin 's effort on this legislation , including shepherding the bill through the [ORG GOR  ] interagency process . 
[PER XXXX  ] passed a copy of the latest draft law to econoff . 
To Join or Not To Join ----------------------- 3 . 
( C ) According to [ORG Visa  ] 's [PER XXXX  ] , the latest version follows the " [LOC China  ] model " of payment card systems . 
The law would set up a [ORG National Payment Card System  ] ( [ORG NPCS  ] ) , which [PER XXXX  ] reported would likely be run by a consortium of state banks as either a non-profit entity or a joint stock , profit-making company . 
Banks and credit card companies would have the option of joining the [ORG NPCS  ] . 
If they joined , banks in [LOC Russia  ] would issue cards under the [ORG NPCS  ] brand , with its own logo . 
Payment processing for these cards would be done on-shore by the [ORG NPCS  ] entity . 
According to the [ORG Kommersant  ] article , the fees for these services are estimated at Rb 120 billion ( $4 billion ) annually . 
As [PER XXXX  ] pointed out , the vast majority of [ORG Visa  ] 's business in [LOC Russia  ] is done with cards issued and used in [LOC Russia  ] ; with earnings from processing going to [ORG NPCS  ] , [ORG Visa  ] would no longer profit from these transactions . 
4 . 
( C ) While joining the [ORG NPCS  ] would be optional for both banks and international payment card companies , membership has its privileges . 
If [ORG Visa  ] and [ORG MasterCard  ] choose to join the [ORG NPCS  ] , they would not have any role in domestic transaction processing , but the bank-issued [ORG NPCS  ] cards could be " co-branded " with [ORG Visa  ] or [ORG MasterCard  ] . 
When the cardholder used his card abroad , the transaction theoretically would go through the normal [ORG Visa  ] or [ORG MasterCard  ] processing that takes place outside of [LOC Russia  ] . 
While [PER XXXX  ] said such a deal is a possibility , it would require negotiations to specify this approach in the draft law . 
ON-SHORE PAYMENT PROCESSING REQUIRED ------------------------------------ 5 . 
( C ) In the proposed draft of the law , if international payment card companies choose not to join the [ORG NPCS  ] , they will have to set up on-shore processing centers . 
But neither [ORG Visa  ] nor [ORG MasterCard  ] representatives , which together have 85% of the [MISC Russian  ] payment card market , are willing to say whether they would be willing to do so . 
[ORG MasterCard  ] 's [LOC Head  ] in [LOC Russia  ] , [PER XXXX  ] [PER XXXX  ] , said [ORG MasterCard  ] would have to " build and assess the business model of setting up on-shore processing " before it could reach a decision . 
The draft law stipulates that international payment card companies will have one year to establish processing centers inside of [LOC Russia  ] . 
( Note: Currently no international companies have processing centers in [LOC Russia  ] . 
) A ban on sending abroad payment data for purely domestic transactions will become effective two years after the law enters into force . 
6 . 
( C ) According to [PER XXXX  ] , MinFin understands that this [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000228 002 OF 002 would entail so much expense and difficulty for [ORG Visa  ] and [ORG MasterCard  ] that the two companies might quit the [MISC Russian  ] domestic market . 
[PER XXXX  ] believes that , at least at the Deputy Minister level , MinFin 's hands are tied . 
Implying that [MISC Russian  ] security services were behind this decision , [PER XXXX  ] said , " There is some se-cret ( government ) order that no one has seen , but everyone has to abide by it . 
" As described reftel , credit card company and bank representatives have told us that [ORG GOR  ] officials apparently assume that [LOC US  ] payment systems routinely share data associated with payment transactions by [MISC Russian  ] cardholders with intelligence services in the [LOC US  ] and elsewhere . 
STATE EMPLOYEES ALL GET [ORG NPCS CARDS  ] ---------------------------------- 7 . 
( C ) The current draft of the law would require all stated-owned enterprises and all state employees to be issued [ORG NPCS  ] cards and to receive their salaries via electronic deposit into [ORG NPCS  ] member-banks . 
( Note: Eighty percent of payment card holders have what are called " salary cards , " a type of debit card negotiated between the employer and a bank . 
Historically , employees have used their salary cards almost exclusively to withdraw their salaries at the beginning of each month , though they can also use them as debit cards . 
) One positive aspect of the latest version of the law is that vendors are not required to accept [ORG NPCS  ] cards , as was required in earlier versions . 
COMMENT ------- 8 . 
( C ) This draft law continues to disadvantage [LOC U.S.  ] payment card market leaders [ORG Visa  ] and [ORG MasterCard  ] , whether they join the [ORG National Payment Card System  ] or not . 
If they join , the [ORG NPCS  ] operator will collect the fees , leaving them to collect processing fees only when card-holders travel abroad -- a tiny section of the market . 
If they do not join but choose to compete with [ORG NPCS  ] cards , they will have to set up payment processing centers in [LOC Russia  ] , a very large investment in itself , and compete against a system likely backed by the largest [MISC Russian  ] state banks . 
While the draft legislation has yet to be submitted to the [ORG Duma  ] and can still be amended , post will continue to raise our concerns with senior [ORG GOR  ] officials . 
We recommend that senior [ORG USG  ] officials also take advantage of meetings with their [MISC Russian  ] counterparts , including through the [ORG Bilateral Presidential Commission  ] , to press the [ORG GOR  ] to change the draft text to ensure [LOC U.S.  ] payment companies are not adversely affected . 
END COMMENT .
