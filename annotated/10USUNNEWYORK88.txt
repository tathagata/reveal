End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Rice  ] began the discussion at a February 8 lunch she hosted for [MISC Brazilian  ] [PER PermRep Viotti  ] by outlining the [LOC U.S.  ] view of the situation in [LOC Haiti  ] and priorities over the coming weeks and months . 
[PER Viotti  ] agreed with the [LOC U.S.  ] assessment , concurring that it is important to keep [MISC Haitians  ] themselves in the lead on all efforts , and stressing that the international community must already begin thinking about reconstruction and rebuilding . 
She said that [LOC Brazil  ] has been very much engaged in [LOC Haiti  ] since 2004 and wants to reinforce regional efforts to assist [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Viotti  ] said she believed that [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation in [LOC MINUSTAH  ] had encouraged greater participation by other [MISC Latin American  ] countries in addressing [LOC Haiti  ] 's needs . 
She also highlighted enhanced cooperation efforts among [MISC Latin American  ] countries in order to deconflict bilateral aid to [LOC Haiti  ] . 
She agreed that CARICOM countries have " taken a more distant position " with regard to [LOC Haiti  ] , but in light of the current crisis they are offering support and assistance , and she suggested that this might be the beginning of more effective long-term engagement on the part of the [LOC Caribbean  ] countries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Viotti  ] noted that maintaining calm in [LOC Haiti  ] will depend on effective distribution of food , water , medicine , and other basics . 
Cash distributions to [MISC Haitians  ] are a vital part of assistance , she added , as they allow people to re-open businesses and take other actions that give them back some control over their lives . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will probably donate money for the cash distribution program , separate from the $15 million it has already given to the [MISC Flash Appeal  ] for [LOC Haiti  ] . 
She said that the [LOC MINUSTAH  ] mandate seems to be sufficient to cover everything that needs to be done right now , but it might need to be reviewed when it comes up for renewal in October. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Viotti  ] said that while [LOC Haiti  ] is an immediate priority , [LOC Brazil  ] 's other priorities include [LOC Africa  ] , peacekeeping , peacebuilding , protection of civilians , and [ORG Timor-Leste  ] . 
She commented that [LOC Brazil  ] has been very active in [ORG Timor-Leste  ] since the start of [ORG UN  ] involvement there . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is the chair of the [ORG Security Council  ] 's [ORG DRC  ] sanctions committee , and [PER Viotti  ] said they are setting up a new expert group for the committee and she looks forward to working closely with them to improve monitoring of the sanctions regime . 
On [LOC Sudan  ] , [PER Viotti  ] said she believes there is " a measure of convergence " in the [ORG SC  ] on what needs to be done there , such as implementing the [ORG CPA  ] and planning for after the election , but the details are hard and the possibility for [ORG UN  ] action on these issues is limited . 
[PER Rice  ] responded that while the [ORG SC  ] should not prejudge or influence the outcome of the election or the referendum , it is pretty clear to everyone what the outcome of a free and fair referendum would be , and we need to begin planning now , in a creative and sustained way . 
[PER Viotti  ] suggested that it might be possible for the [ORG Council  ] to approach this through setting up some type of informal group or committee to examine possibilities , and both ambassadors agreed it will be important to work closely with [PER U/SYG Menkerios  ] on this. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [LOC Middle East  ] is also an issue of interest for [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Viotti  ] said , particularly since [LOC Brazil  ] has a large [MISC Arab  ] community and a " strong and powerful " [MISC Jewish  ] community . 
[PER Rice  ] outlined the [LOC U.S.  ] position on the [LOC Middle East  ] , stressing that the [ORG SC  ] 's monthly meetings are not necessarily helpful to efforts to bring the parties back to the negotiating table , and that the [ORG Council  ] must be careful that its meetings and pronouncements are constructive and supportive of the larger goal of getting the parties to a two-state solution . 
[PER Viotti  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] takes a somewhat different view of the potential contribution of the [ORG SC  ] and the international community to the peace process , and suggested that perhaps the [ORG SC  ] can do more to encourage both parties to return to negotiations . 
Maybe they need encouragement from the broader international community in order to move the process forward , she suggested. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) When the discussion turned to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Viotti  ] repeated [LOC Brazil  ] 's position that all countries have the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy under [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has told [LOC Iran  ] that the offers on the table from the [ORG P5  ] 1 are an opportunity not to be missed , she said , and judging from [LOC Brazil  ] 's contacts with the [MISC Iranians  ] last year , it seemed that by the end of the year [LOC Iran  ] , including President [PER Ahmadenijad  ] , saw the value of engaging , but domestic problems prevented the GOI from doing so , since such engagement provided an opening to criticize the government . 
She urged additional efforts at quiet diplomacy with the [MISC Iranians  ] , noting that in [LOC Davos  ] the [MISC Iranians  ] did not seem to be rejecting the basic concept of the proposal ; they simply wanted more time to discuss the details . 
[PER Rice  ] responded that there has been a clear deal from the [ORG IAEA  ] on the table - send all 1200 kilograms of their [ORG LEU  ] to [LOC Russia  ] and then [LOC France  ] to be processed - but the [MISC Iranians  ] have been unable to come to grips with it in all this ti me . 
The deal 's utility as a confidence-building measure is diminishing every day , as [LOC Iran  ] makes more [ORG LEU  ] . 
[PER Viotti  ] said the question for [LOC Brazil  ] is whether sanctions will be effective , since they have not been so with [LOC Iran  ] in the past . 
Crippling sanctions could close the door to further diplomatic efforts . 
[PER Rice  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] sees sanctions as having exactly the opposite effect: they are a way to keep the diplomatic option alive and reduce the risk of a military conflict , since their purpose is to encourage [LOC Iran  ] to move in the right direction .
