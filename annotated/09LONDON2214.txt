[MISC Russian  ] Perspective -- [ORG NPT  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) U/S for [ORG Arms Control and International Security  ] [PER Ellen Tauscher  ] and Special Representative for [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation  ] Ambassador [PER Susan Burk  ] held bilateral meetings in [LOC London  ] September 3-4 , on the margins of the [ORG P5 Conference  ] on [ORG Confidence Building Measures Towards Nuclear Disarmament  ] , with [MISC Russian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Sergei Ryabkov  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs He [PER Yafei  ] , and [MISC French  ] Director for [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] [PER Patrick Maisonnave  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Burk  ] opened the first meeting , with [MISC Russian  ] [PER DFM Ryabkov  ] , by presenting an outline of [LOC U.S.  ] objectives for the [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] [MISC RevCon  ] ) . 
[PER DFM Ryabkov  ] stated that [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] are “very much in line with each other” regarding the [ORG NPT  ] [MISC RevCon  ] . 
He confirmed that [LOC Russia  ] seeks a [ORG P5  ] consensus with a results-oriented [ORG NPT  ] conclusion. “We cannot allow the [ORG NPT  ] to fail , ” he said . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] cited the “good experience of being almost there” in terms of the chair’s recommendations from the third [ORG Preparatory Committee  ] ( [ORG PrepCom  ] ) . “We must focus while moving toward the [ORG NPT  ] [MISC RevCon  ] on realistic deliverables in all areas , ” he said , which means avoiding pretexts for the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] ( [ORG NAM  ] ) to balk . 
[LOC Russia  ] seeks to avoid “prescriptive outcomes.” He expressed the view that the [LOC UK  ] draft text was a good basis for a [ORG P5  ] statement . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] would stress universal adherence to the [ORG NPT  ] , universal adherence to the Additional Protocol , the [MISC Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty  ] ( [MISC CTBT  ] ) , the [ORG Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty  ] ( [ORG FMCT  ] ) , and negative security assurances . 
He noted the importance of “progress” on [MISC CTBT  ] ratification , preferably before the end of the conference . 
He stated the importance of developing [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) verification and control mechanisms , and that negative security guarantees are key . 
[LOC Russia  ] would think positively about the development of a legal instrument . 
[LOC Egypt  ] ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] said the [MISC Egyptian  ] position gives [LOC Russia  ] “serious concern.” [LOC Russia  ] regularly engages with the [MISC Egyptians  ] , but the [MISC Egyptians  ] do not seem to understand the gravity of the situation . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] expressed hope that the [LOC U.S.  ] would support ideas such as a special coordinator and comprehensive [ORG IAEA  ] coverage of facilities in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He noted that [LOC Middle Eastern  ] countries need to ratify the [MISC CTBT  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] has been in touch with [LOC Israel  ] to see if it would consider becoming part of the [ORG Chemical Weapons Convention  ] ( [ORG CWC  ] ) , which would “play well” with the [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
U/S for [ORG Arms Control and International Security Tauscher  ] said she had been working with [LOC Egypt  ] , including with Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] , and would continue to do so in the coming weeks . 
She said that some [MISC Egyptians  ] consider their approach last year to be a mistake , and that we were working to get [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] to come together on an approach that would command consensus . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] had not detected reconsideration by [LOC Egypt  ] , and promised to “explore” [LOC LONDON  ] 00002214 002 OF 007 Tauscher’s suggestion that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] meet jointly with the [MISC Egyptians  ] to show [ORG U.S.-Russia  ] coordination and to explain concerns to the [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
Multilateral Approaches to the [ORG Fuel Cycle  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] was surprised by opposition to initiatives , “both yours and ours , ” at the most recent Board of Governors ( [ORG BOG  ] ) meeting . 
[LOC Russia  ] will continue to push forward on its [LOC Angarsk  ] idea . 
[LOC Russia  ] will soon circulate a draft agreement and will consult with the [LOC U.S  ] and as many other potential co-sponsors as possible to increase the chances of a positive outcome . 
U/S [PER Tauscher  ] made clear the [LOC U.S.  ] supports the [LOC Angarsk  ] initiative and wants to push it forward at the November Board as the first step ; other steps could follow using the [LOC Angarsk  ] precedents . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] expressions of support for [LOC Angarsk  ] and asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to make positive remarks at the next [ORG BOG  ] meeting. “Creative Ways” to Present Arguments Needed ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] said it is important in the lead up to the [MISC RevCon  ] to find “creative ways” to present our arguments , citing [MISC Egyptian  ] skepticism . 
U/S [PER Tauscher  ] agreed that we need to find better ways to get our narrative out , and proposed that the two of them write an op-ed that could run in [LOC New York  ] at the time of the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] responded that such a piece could make clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] stand together on fuel assurances . 
He said it was a “good idea , ” and they should look for the right occasion . 
Ryabklov also raised the 13 steps , suggesting that some elements were “OBE” and the context was now different . 
[ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Senior Director for [ORG WMD Terrorism and Threat Reduction  ] at the [ORG National Security Council Laura Holgate  ] briefed on plans for the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] in April . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] expressed appreciation and said the summit should seek a result that is both “political and technical , ” which he characterized as “a huge task requiring thorough preparation.” He stressed the importance of early exchanges on summit preparations . 
He promised that [LOC Russia  ] would work to develop ideas by the [ORG Sherpa  ] meeting or shortly thereafter . 
However , the time frame is “extraordinarily short , ” even if the summit is postponed until April . 
The summit should seek a “defendable niche” that will not take away from [ORG NPT  ] , he said . 
[MISC CTBT  ] , [ORG FMCT  ] ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was carefully preparing for ratification of the [MISC CTBT  ] by the [ORG Senate  ] , including a new study by the [ORG National Academy  ] . 
Another key priority for the [LOC U.S.  ] is the [ORG FMCT  ] . 
We were encouraged by the steps in the [ORG Conference on Disarmament  ] ( [ORG CD  ] ) in May , but [LOC Pakistan  ] has blocked implementation . 
She said the [ORG P5  ] must work together to preserve the work plan in January and commence actual negotiations . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] responded that [LOC Russia  ] would welcome early [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC CTBT  ] ratification . 
[LOC Russia  ] had talked to the [MISC Pakistanis  ] about the [ORG FMCT  ] , but [ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] indicated that they were “quite evasive.” He urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to engage the [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] said we would continue to do so and encourage the rest of the [ORG P5  ] to do so as well . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Threat , Missile Defense ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] proposed that [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] implement together the understandings reached by the two Presidents in [LOC Moscow  ] regarding missile defense , joint threat assessment and the [ORG Joint Data Exchange Center  ] ( [ORG JDEC  ] ) . 
Responding to her proposal to send a team to [LOC Moscow  ] to get Russia’s intelligence assessment on the [MISC Iranian  ] missile threat , [PER Ryabkov  ] said that missile defense remains a difficult [LOC LONDON  ] 00002214 003 OF 007 issue for [LOC Russia  ] ; the Presidential text was good guidance , but [LOC Russia  ] needed more time to consider the [LOC U.S.  ] view regarding the missile threat from [LOC Iran  ] and issues of their missile technology . 
[LOC Russia  ] has “objective data” and the differences between the [MISC Russian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] views are “considerable.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Tauscher  ] described the missile defense review underway in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] expressed appreciation , and suggested that they revisit the joint threat assessment and the [ORG JDEC  ] after the [ORG Ballistic Missile Defense  ] ( [ORG BMD  ] ) review has been completed . 
[ORG Nuclear Cooperation  ] ------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] welcomed Head of [ORG Federal Atomic Energy Agency  ] [PER Sergei Kiriyenko  ] , s planned visit to [LOC Washington  ] and the establishment of the working group on nuclear energy and nuclear cooperation . 
She pressed for approval and signature of the plutonium disposition agreement . 
[ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] replied that the situation with respect to plutonium disposition was the same as it was during the President , s visit to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
The issue of financing had precluded real progress before the POTUS visit . 
[LOC Russia  ] needs to figure out what is realistic . 
There are no political constraints . 
[LOC Russia  ] is disposing of highly toxic materials . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] expressed interest in information about what the [LOC U.S.  ] was doing in that regard . 
[MISC S-300  ] [ORG Air Defense Missiles  ] -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] asked about the status of the [LOC Russia  ] 123 agreement . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] responded that some in [ORG Congress  ] are interested in moving forward on the 123 agreement , and that further discussions could be held in October . 
It is crucial that [LOC Russia  ] not transfer the [MISC S-300  ] system to [LOC Iran  ] if [ORG Congress  ] is to allow the agreement to come into force , she added . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] had a valid contract for the sale of the [MISC S-300s  ] , and acknowledged that [LOC Russia  ] needed to make a decision regarding the [MISC S-300  ] sale to [LOC Iran  ] , an issue that has been the subject of “utmost attention in many places.” [LOC Russia  ] is in a position of growing difficulty for not honoring its contractual obligations and , finances aside , [LOC Russia  ] is getting “no points in [PER Iran.” Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] understands the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Israeli  ] arguments and wants to be transparent on the topic , and noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] presidents have discussed it . 
The current situation is not sustainable ; [LOC Russia  ] cannot hold up the sale indefinitely . 
At some point [LOC Russia  ] will have to make up its mind , [PER Ryabkov  ] said . 
[LOC Russia  ] did not agree to sell surface-to-surface missiles but has a contract to sell [LOC Iran  ] air defense systems . 
[LOC Votkinsk  ] -------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] have different views on whether continuous monitoring at [LOC Votkinsk  ] should be continued in the [ORG Stategic Arms Reduction Treaty  ] ( [ORG START  ] ) follow-on agreement . 
[LOC Russia  ] considers the importance of switching off the system to be quite high . 
The run-up to the end date of [ORG START  ] could create difficulties . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] stated that we have the right to monitor until December 5 , to which [PER Ryabkov  ] replied , “That goes without saying.” [PER Tauscher  ] went on that we see merit in continuing with the [LOC Votkinsk  ] system in the new agreement . 
If the final decision is not to continue the system , we are prepared to work out an arrangement that maintains our rights through December 4 . 
Contractors can box and ship the equipment ; there are ways to manage this , she said . 
Conventional Forces in [LOC Europe  ] ( [ORG CFE  ] ) ----------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG DFM  ] [PER Ryabkov  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] circulated its ideas on the Conventional Forces in [LOC Europe  ] ( [ORG CFE  ] ) treaty in [LOC Vienna  ] on May 5. “We don’t want to abandon the [ORG CFE  ] regime altogether , ” he said . 
[LOC Russia  ] has the sense that [ORG NATO  ] is “becoming comfortable” with the current situation . 
[LOC Russia  ] , [LOC LONDON  ] 00002214 004 OF 007 however , does not want to return to the old treaty . 
[ORG CFE  ] adaptation plus more is required . 
Flank limitations are the core problem . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Turkey  ] is not that concerned about flank limitations but wants to keep the system for its own reasons . 
There could be a chance to “move innovatively” regarding [ORG CFE  ] , but the current situation is unsustainable. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ryabkov  ] concluded by saying [LOC Russia  ] wants someone on the [LOC U.S.  ] side who will deal with this issue on a regular basis with [ORG MFA Security and Arms Control  ] Director [PER Anatoly Antonov  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] wants to move forward and wants to reinvigorate the [LOC Vienna  ] process without undermining the bilateral process . 
[ORG Australia Group  ] --------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ryabkov  ] asked for a “fresh look” regarding the [LOC Australia  ] group , since the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] are now cooperating in many ways . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] said she has seen no interest on the part of the other members of the [ORG Australia Group  ] in [MISC Russian  ] membership given the concerns with respect to [MISC Russian  ] implementation of the [ORG Chemical Weapons Convention  ] ( [ORG CWC  ] ) and [ORG Biological Weapons Convention  ] ( [ORG BWC  ] ) . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] responded that he thought they had dealt with those questions . 
[LOC MANPADS  ] -- [LOC Venezuela  ] -------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] asked that [LOC Russia  ] look further into the end-use controls on [MISC Man-portable  ] air-defense systems ( [ORG MANPADS  ] ) transferred to [LOC Venezuela  ] to ensure they do not wind up with the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] affirmed Russia’s commitment to ensure legitimate end-user certificates and the ability to conduct inspections ; this is true for [LOC MANPADS  ] . 
The information provided was fragmentary , he said . 
[LOC Russia  ] concluded that the factory marks on the munitions made it difficult to determine if they were part of the equipment sold to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government . 
[PER Ryabkov  ] said [LOC Russia  ] understood the tense situation between [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Perspective -- [MISC CTBT  ] --------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] opened the discussion with [MISC Chinese  ] Vice-Minister of Foreign Affiars He [MISC Yafei  ] with a description of [LOC U.S.  ] preparations to seek ratification of the [MISC CTBT  ] in the [ORG Senate  ] . 
[ORG VFM  ] He asked “Are you there yet ? ” [PER Tauscher  ] asked if [LOC China  ] would follow with its own ratification , and He replied that it is “likely” that [LOC China  ] would follow if the [LOC U.S.  ] ratified the [MISC CTBT  ] . 
[ORG U.S.-China Cooperation  ] ---------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG VFM  ] He said [LOC China  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] have many common interests and “we’re flooded with issues.” President [PER Obama’s Prague  ] speech “caught the attention of many.” The [MISC NPT  ] is “important but we must improve on it” and must “start and restart” issues of disarmament , nonproliferation and peaceful use . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] President’s vision is to study issues in the context of [MISC Chinese  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation. “I have a mandate to work with you , ” He said . 
Nonproliferation issues have been dormant for a dozen years , but the context has changed . 
China’s goal is a “serious reduction of the nuclear threat.” The time to act is now since “we have a mandate and a consensus at the top level.” [ORG P5 Consultation in Advance  ] of the [MISC NPT RevCon  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG VFM  ] He said the [ORG P5  ] may not always see eye-to-eye but should closely consult in the lead-up to the [MISC NPT RevCon  ] . 
The [ORG P5  ] should “stand together” and unite since the [ORG P5  ] countries are a “target.” He added that is important to improve communications with non-nuclear states. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG VFM  ] He raised the issue of the [MISC Egyptian  ] [LOC Middle East  ] nuclear-free zone . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC LONDON  ] 00002214 005 OF 007 was working hard with both [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] to find a common approach and avoid confrontation at the [ORG IAEA General Conference  ] and the [MISC NPT RevCon  ] . 
He said [LOC China  ] was prepared to support that effort . 
He added the [ORG P5  ] should carefully review [LOC Iran  ] and the [ORG DPRK  ] but deal with them separately from the upcoming [ORG UNSC Summit  ] and the [MISC RevCon  ] . 
[LOC FMCT  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] -------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] outlined the problem caused by [LOC Pakistan  ] in blocking implementation of the [MISC CD  ] program of work . 
She said the [LOC U.S.  ] was talking to [LOC Pakistan  ] and arguing that [LOC Pakistan  ] could make its points in the negotiations but should not block the beginning of talks . 
[ORG VFM  ] He agreed that the [MISC Pakistanis  ] “have concerns” regarding the [LOC FMCT  ] negotiations . 
He said he understood [MISC Pakistani  ] “hesitancy , ” as well as their “logic” and “illogic.” The solution is to address the underlying problem , which is that [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] view each other as enemies . 
Nuclear weapons are crucial to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Indeed , a [MISC Pakistani  ] military leader said his army was no match for the [MISC Indian  ] army. “India is the lynchpin” to assuaging Pakistan’s fears and the [LOC U.S.  ] could influence [LOC India  ] . 
[LOC China  ] has resolved all border issues except those with [LOC India  ] , He observed . 
In response to [PER Tauscher  ] , s expression of appreciation for China’s efforts in the [MISC CD  ] with [LOC Pakistan  ] , He said [LOC China  ] would engage the [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
[ORG UNSC Summit  ] ----------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG VFM  ] He said that the [LOC U.S.  ] draft for the [ORG UNSC Summit  ] was fairly good , but that [LOC China  ] had amendments . 
China’s Ambassador to the [ORG UN  ] has authority to negotiate on the draft resolution which , unfortunately , does not mention China’s disarmament efforts , though the efforts of other [ORG P5  ] countries are noted . 
[LOC China  ] should get credit for , for example , its no first use policy . 
[ORG VFM  ] He also said that [LOC China  ] has a different view on the proposed moratorium on the production of fissile material . 
[LOC China  ] supports a ban , but not a moratorium , which raises questions concerning definition , how long , verification , and the like . 
[ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] ----------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Senior Director [PER Holgate  ] briefed on planning for the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] in the spring . 
[ORG VFM  ] He said [LOC China  ] supports this initiative , which he described as a “huge , daunting job.” He advised the [LOC U.S.  ] to consider establishing a “small , informal group to resolve issues” before the summit--U.S. , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and a few others--to make sure the major parties are comfortable . 
[ORG DPRK  ] ---- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] mentioned Ambassador [PER Philip Goldberg  ] , s useful talks , which would continue . 
She asked where the [ORG DPRK  ] stood . 
[ORG VFM  ] He responded that the [LOC United States  ] is the [MISC DPRK’s  ] main preoccupation . 
The country views normalization of its relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] as the only way out of its current “mess.” [LOC China  ] believes the [ORG DPRK  ] leadership is anxious about economic development but they believe their security concerns override their economic concerns . 
Nonetheless , there are signs the [ORG DPRK  ] is reaching out . 
[ORG DPRK  ] wants bilateral talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] , not [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] . 
[LOC China  ] wants the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] to continue . 
The [ORG DPRK  ] wants “something in return” to restart the talks . 
[ORG VFM  ] He asserted that [LOC China  ] is encouraging the [ORG DPRK  ] to return to the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] . 
[LOC China  ] is also trying to convince the [ORG DPRK  ] not to go back on its promise to denuclearize . 
The [ORG DPRK  ] leader appears to be in good health and control . 
Civil [ORG Nuclear Cooperation  ] with [LOC Pakistan  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] asked about the status of civil nuclear cooperation with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG VFM  ] He responded that all [LOC LONDON  ] 00002214 006 OF 007 cooperation is for civil purposes , under safeguards , and that [LOC China  ] is not going out of that mode . 
It is not in China’s interest to proliferate nuclear technology . 
[PER Tauscher  ] asked about [LOC Pakistan  ] , s financial situation . 
[ORG VFM  ] He replied that [LOC Pakistan  ] was hit hard by the financial crisis , but it is a largely agrarian society that needs little cash to survive and is in no danger of going broke . 
[LOC China  ] is the only country that has given cash support to [LOC Pakistan  ] , he said . 
[MISC French  ] Perspective -- [ORG P3 Coordination  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a final meeting , [MISC French  ] Director for [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] [PER Patrick Maisonnave  ] expressed a need to reinforce [ORG P3  ] coordination . 
[PER Maisonnave  ] noted his disappointment at the current negotiating process in [LOC New York  ] , stating that “P3 coordination could be more efficient.” [PER U/S Tauscher  ] agreed the [ORG P3  ] needed to stick together and suggested frequent telephone calls . 
[PER Maisonnave  ] said he looked forward to frequent phone contact among the three countries . 
[ORG UNSC Summit  ] ----------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Regarding the September [ORG UNSC Heads of State Summit  ] , [PER Maisonnave  ] observed that it could be difficult , if not impossible , to achieve consensus on specific language regarding the [ORG DPRK  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , but “a strong generic message would help.” This was important to [MISC French  ] political authorities . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] agreed , and asked if there were other political messages [LOC France  ] wanted to send . 
DAS-equivalent for Disarmament and [ORG Nuclear Non-Proliferation  ] [PER Martin Briens  ] said [LOC France  ] wanted the text of the Summit’s resolution to put the issue of nuclear nonproliferation in a broader context . 
He suggested a short sentence asserting that “we need to make progress on other forms of disarmament.” [PER Briens  ] said that [LOC France  ] wants a paragraph in the resolution setting out concrete measures against proliferation . 
He also noted “some technical problems” that needed to be resolved , such as issues surrounding the return of property and equipment . 
Defining Language and Minimum Objectives ---------------------------------------- <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) DAS-equivalent [PER Briens  ] noted the “political requirement” of sending a message to [LOC Iran  ] and the [ORG DPRK  ] , of “not letting them off the hook.” [PER Maisonnave  ] said that one red line for [LOC France  ] was that there must be nothing in the final text of the resolution that would weaken deterrence . 
He expressed support for a “balanced result” and called for managing expectations . 
[PER Maisonnave  ] stressed the importance of supporting access to civil nuclear energy . 
[ORG P3  ] consultations would provide an opportunity to clarify goals and to “define minimum objectives.” [PER Briens  ] said that when the [ORG P3  ] meets in early October , there would be an opportunity to set “minimum goals” and “work on our statetgy.” The October 8-9 Center for [ORG Strategic and International Studies  ] ( [ORG CSIS  ] ) [ORG Conference  ] in [LOC Washington  ] would potentially be a good time for experts to meet , [PER Briens  ] said. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] noted the importance of coordinating public diplomacy messages . 
Brien concurred on the importance of better public outreach . 
[ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] ----------------------- <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Senior Director [PER Holgate  ] briefed on plans for the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] . 
[PER Maisonnave  ] expressed support for the summit next spring and sought details about timing and goals . 
He described it as an “excellent initiative” and said that [MISC French  ] officials would have their first planning meeting September 8 . 
[PER Briens  ] said that the summit would give political momentum and help provide political will to reenforce nonproliferation mechanisms .
