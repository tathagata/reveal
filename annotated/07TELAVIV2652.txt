Jones  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) In an August 17 meeting , [MISC Israeli  ] Mossad Chief [PER Meir Dagan  ] thanked Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] for [LOC America  ] 's support of [LOC Israel  ] as evidenced by the previous day 's signing of an [ORG MOU  ] that provides [LOC Israel  ] with USD 30 billion in security assistance from 2008-2018 . 
[PER Dagan  ] provided his assessment of the [LOC Middle East  ] region , [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] , stressing [LOC Israel  ] 's ( a ) concern for President [PER Musharraf  ] 's well-being , ( b ) view that [LOC Iran  ] can be forced to change its behavior , and ( c ) sense that [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] are unstable with unclear futures ahead of them . 
[PER Dagan  ] probed for more detail about XXXXXXXXXXXX [LOC U.S.  ] military assistance to the [LOC Gulf  ] states , and -- while signaling agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] approach to the [LOC Gulf  ] states vis-a-vis [LOC Iran  ] -- cautioned that they may not be able to absorb significant military assistance . 
[PER Dagan  ] reviewed [LOC Israel  ] 's five-pillar strategy concerning [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , stressed that [LOC Iran  ] is economicall vulnerable , and pressed for more activity with [LOC Iran  ] 's minority groups aimed at regime change . 
[PER Dagan  ] urged caution in providing assistance to the [ORG Siniora  ] government in [LOC Lebanon  ] , noting [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to topple the [MISC GOL.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] cited the [ORG MOU  ] as tangible evidence of the [ORG USG  ] 's commitment to [LOC Israel  ] , and stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] would support all of its friends -- [MISC Arabs  ] included -- in the [LOC Middle East  ] , and will remain engaged in the region for the long term . 
He described [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to support the [PER Musharraf  ] and [PER Karzai governments  ] as they face opposition from [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and the [ORG Taliban  ] , and explained that the [ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] is meant to bolster [LOC Gulf  ] states facing threats from [LOC Iran  ] . 
The Under Secretary reviewed [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to isolate [LOC Iran  ] and increase pressure on it , stressing that the [LOC U.S.  ] is currently focused on the diplomatic track . 
He shared [ORG USG  ] thinking about the [ORG Siniora  ] government in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] continue to consult on [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------------- THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE [ORG MOU  ] AND ISRAEL'S QME -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] observed that the signing of the [ORG MOU  ] on security assistance could not have come at a better time , and stressed that [LOC Israel  ] appreciated [LOC America  ] 's support . 
The Under Secretary agreed about the timing , noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Israel  ] and like-minded countries were facing multiple threats around the world , and that the [LOC Middle East  ] is a very dangerous region . 
He said that the [ORG MOU  ] serves as a concrete reminder that the [LOC U.S.  ] stands by its long-term security commitments to its friends , and is ready to help them with their needs . 
The Under Secretary noted that the [LOC Middle East  ] is now at the heart of [MISC American  ] interests . 
Because [LOC Egypt  ] also plays a vital role in the region , the [LOC U.S.  ] would also renew its security assistance commitment to that country . 
[LOC U.S.  ] relations with the [LOC Gulf  ] states were longstanding , and [LOC America  ] would stay true to those friendships , as well . 
The Under Secretary stressed that the [ORG USG  ] is committed to [LOC Israel  ] 's QME . 
He noted that the majority of systems and equipment that the [LOC U.S.  ] would sell to [LOC Egypt  ] and other [MISC Arab  ] partners would replace items that had been sold to those countries in the past. ------------------------------------------- [PER DAGAN  ] REVIEWS MIDDLE EAST , [LOC PAKISTAN  ] , [LOC TURKEY  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Assessing the region , [PER Dagan  ] said [LOC Israel  ] sees itself in the middle of a rapidly changing environment , in which the fate of one [MISC Middle Eastern  ] country is connected to another . 
[PER Dagan  ] then said he was concerned about how long [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Musharraf  ] would survive: " He is facing a serious problem with the militants . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear capability could end up in the hands of an [MISC Islamic  ] regime . 
" Turning to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Dagan  ] observed that it is in a transition period . 
There is debate among the leadership between [PER Rafsanjani  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and their respective supporters . 
Instability in [LOC Iran  ] is driven by inflation and tension among ethnic minorities . 
This , [PER Dagan  ] said , presents unique opportunities , and [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Americans  ] might see a change in [LOC Iran  ] in [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002652 002 OF 005 their lifetimes . 
As for [LOC Iraq  ] , it may end up a weak , federal state comprised of three cantons or entities , one each belonging to the [MISC Kurds  ] , [MISC Sunnis  ] and [MISC Shias.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] said that the [LOC Gulf  ] states and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] are concerned about the growing importance of [LOC Iran  ] and its influence on them . 
They are taking precautions , trying to increase their own military defensive capabilities . 
Referring to the [ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] ( [ORG GSD  ] ) , [PER Dagan  ] warned that these countries would not be able to cope with the amount of weapons systems they intend to acquire: " They do not use the weapons effectively . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] said that [LOC Jordan  ] has successfully faced down threats from the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] , and that [LOC Egypt  ] is struggling with the question of who will replace President [PER Mubarak  ] . 
He said he sees no hope for the [MISC Palestinians  ] , and that [LOC Israel  ] looks at [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] , and sees only instability . 
Further afield , it looks at [LOC Turkey  ] and sees [MISC Islamists  ] gaining momentum there . 
The question , he asked , is how long [LOC Turkey  ] 's military -- viewing itself as the defender of [LOC Turkey  ] 's secular identity -- will remain quiet. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) If [LOC Israel  ] 's neighborhood were not unstable enough , [PER Dagan  ] observed , it did not help that [LOC Russia  ] is playing a " very negative role " in the region . 
He observed that all of these challenges have to be addressed globally -- they could not be dealt with individually . 
Returning to [LOC Jordan  ] as an example , he noted that the more than one million [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees in [LOC Jordan  ] were changing [MISC Jordanian  ] society , and forcing it into a new relationship with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
This is evidenced by [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Jordan  ] , which implies greater understanding between the [MISC Jordanians  ] and the [MISC Saudis.  ] ---------------------------------------- DISCUSSION OF THE GULF SECURITY DIALOGUE ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Turning to the [ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] ( [ORG GSD  ] ) , [PER Dagan  ] said that enhancing the capabilities of the [LOC Gulf  ] states " is the right direction to go , " especially as they are afraid of [LOC Iran  ] . 
Such a [LOC U.S.  ] commitment will be a stabilizing factor in the region . 
[PER Dagan  ] clarified that he would not oppose [LOC U.S.  ] security assistance to [LOC America  ] 's [MISC Arab  ] partners . 
He expressed concern , nevertheless , about the current policies of those partners -- especially with regards to [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Dagan  ] added that if those countries must choose between buying defensive systems from the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC France  ] , then he would prefer they buy systems from the [LOC U.S.  ] , as this would bring them closer to the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] observed that the challenge facing the [LOC U.S.  ] now is how to unite the [LOC Gulf  ] states under a shared policy , and pointed to [LOC Qatar  ] as the weakest link in the chain , trying to play all sides . 
Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] is trying to get [LOC Qatar  ] and its neighbors to look at issues from a regional perspective , and to focus on threats in a unified way . 
Acting PM Assistant Secretary [PER Mull  ] expressed understanding for [LOC Israel  ] 's frustration with how the region looked , but stressed nevertheless that if [LOC America  ] did not engage the [LOC Gulf  ] states through the [ORG GSD  ] , the situation would become much worse . 
It is critical to get the [LOC Gulf  ] states focused on the [LOC Iran  ] threat , and to adopt a regional approach to countering it . 
Encouraging and supporting their counterproliferation efforts would be crucial . 
[PER Dagan  ] said he agreed with this approach , stressing that the threat of radical [MISC Islam  ] is real. --------------------------------------------- ---- IRAN: [PER DAGAN  ] REVIEWS ISRAEL'S FIVE PILLAR STRATEGY --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] led discussion on [LOC Iran  ] by pointing out that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] have different timetables concerning when [LOC Iran  ] is likely to acquire a nuclear capability . 
He clarified that the [ORG Israel Atomic Energy Commission  ] 's ( [ORG IAEC  ] ) timetable is purely technical in nature , while the [ORG Mossad  ] 's considers other factors , including the regime 's determination to succeed . 
While [PER Dagan  ] acknowledged that there is still time to " resolve " the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear crisis , he stressed that [LOC Iran  ] is making a great effort to achieve a nuclear capability: " The threat is obvious , even if we have a different timetable . 
If we want to postpone their acquisition of a [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002652 003 OF 005 nuclear capability , then we have to invest time and effort ourselves . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] described how the [MISC Israeli  ] strategy consists of five pillars: A ) Political Approach: [PER Dagan  ] praised efforts to bring [LOC Iran  ] before the [ORG UNSC  ] , and signaled his agreement with the pursuit of a third sanctions resolution . 
He acknowledged that pressure on [LOC Iran  ] is building up , but said this approach alone will not resolve the crisis . 
He stressed that the timetable for political action is different than the nuclear project 's timetable . 
B ) Covert [PER Measures: Dagan  ] and the Under Secretary agreed not to discuss this approach in the larger group setting . 
C ) Counterproliferation: [PER Dagan  ] underscored the need to prevent know-how and technology from making their way to [LOC Iran  ] , and said that more can be done in this area . 
D ) [PER Sanctions: Dagan  ] said that the biggest successes had so far been in this area . 
Three [MISC Iranian  ] banks are on the verge of collapse . 
The financial sanctions are having a nationwide impact . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's regime can no longer just deal with the bankers themselves . 
E ) [ORG Force Regime Change:  ] [PER Dagan  ] said that more should be done to foment regime change in [LOC Iran  ] , possibly with the support of student democracy movements , and ethnic groups ( e.g. , [PER Azeris  ] , [MISC Kurds  ] , [MISC Baluchs  ] ) opposed to the ruling regime. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] clarified that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Israel  ] and like-minded countries must push on all five pillars at the same time . 
Some are bearing fruit now ; others would bear fruit in due time , especially if more attention were placed on them . 
[PER Dagan  ] urged more attention on regime change , asserting that more could be done to develop the identities of ethnic minorities in [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said he was sure that [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] could " change the ruling regime in [LOC Iran  ] , and its attitude towards backing terror regimes . 
" He added , " We could also get them to delay their nuclear project . 
[LOC Iran  ] could become a normal state . 
" <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] stressed that [LOC Iran  ] has weak spots that can be exploited . 
According to his information , unemployment exceeds 30 percent nationwide , with some towns and villages experiencing 50 percent unemployment , especially among 17-30 year olds . 
Inflation averages more than 40 percent , and people are criticizing the government for investing in and sponsoring [ORG Hamas  ] , saying that they government should invest in [LOC Iran  ] itself . 
" The economy is hurting , " he said , " and this is provoking a real crisis among [LOC Iran  ] 's leaders . 
" He added that [LOC Iran  ] 's minorities are " raising their heads , and are tempted to resort to violence . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] suggested that more could be done to get the [MISC Europeans  ] to take a tougher stand against [LOC Iran  ] . 
Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] agreed , and suggested that [LOC Israel  ] could help SIPDIS by reaching out to the [MISC Europeans  ] . 
[PER Dagan  ] said that [LOC Israel  ] is already doing this , and would continue to do so . 
[PER Dagan  ] reiterated the need to strike at [LOC Iran  ] 's heart by engaging with its people directly . 
[ORG Voice of America  ] ( [ORG VOA  ] ) broadcasts are important , but more radio transmissions in [LOC Farsi  ] are needed . 
Coordination with the [LOC Gulf  ] states is helpful , but the [LOC U.S.  ] should also coordinate with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and countries to the north of [LOC Iran  ] , to put pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] , he said , would be annoyed , but it would be fitting , as [LOC Russia  ] appears bent on showing the [LOC U.S.  ] that it cannot act globally without considering [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] stressed that the [ORG USG  ] is focused on [LOC Iran  ] not only because of its nuclear program , but also because it supports terrorism and Shiite militias in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] approach is currently focused on the diplomatic track and increasing pressure on [LOC Iran  ] through sanctions . 
Work in the [ORG UNSC  ] helps to define the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear threat as one that affects international security , and not just that of [LOC Israel  ] . 
While [ORG UNSC  ] members [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC China  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] will water down efforts to increase pressure on [LOC Iran  ] , it is still worthwhile to push for a third sanctions resolution . 
In the meantime , the [LOC U.S.  ] will encourage the [MISC Europeans  ] , [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC South Korea  ] to implement unilateral sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] outside the [ORG UNSC  ] framework . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002652 004 OF 005 will continue to encourage banks and financial institutions to slow down their operations in [LOC Iran  ] and financially isolate it . 
Regarding military pressure , the Under Secretary noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] has deployed 1-2 carrier battle groups in the [LOC Gulf  ] over the last six months , and that President [PER Bush  ] has stated that he will interrupt [LOC Iran  ] 's activity in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
As for outreach to the [MISC Iranian  ] people , the [ORG VOA  ] is now broadcasting programs in [LOC Farsi  ] , and the [ORG USG  ] is trying to get more [MISC Iranian  ] students to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] to promote people-to-people relations. ----------------------------------------- PAKISTAN: [LOC ISRAEL  ] WORRIED ABOUT [PER MUSHARRAF  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S ) On [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Dagan  ] said that President [PER Musharraf  ] is losing control , and that some of his coalition partners could threaten him in the future . 
The key question , [PER Dagan  ] said , is whether [PER Musharraf  ] retains his commander-in-chief role in addition to his role as president . 
If not , he will have problems . 
[PER Dagan  ] observed that there has been an increase in the number of attempts on [PER Musharraf  ] 's life , and wondered whether he will survive the next few years . 
Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] replied that [LOC South Asia  ] has assumed vital importance in [MISC American  ] foreign policy since September 11 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is committed to denying [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a safe-haven for [MISC Taliban  ] and [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] activity . 
The [ORG USG  ] will continue to support [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Musharraf  ] , and is seeking to boost his military defensive capabilities . 
At the same time , the [LOC U.S.  ] is encouraging [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] to work with each other militarily . 
Turning to [LOC India  ] , Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] noted that [MISC U.S.-Indian  ] economic cooperation is growing , and that the [ORG USG  ] is working effectively to reduce tensions between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan.  ] ----------------------------- LEBANON: [PER DAGAN  ] URGES CAUTION ----------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) [PER Dagan  ] urged caution with respect to [LOC Lebanon  ] , noting that the results of efforts there to bolster the [PER Siniora  ] government would impact [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , he said , are on the edge of achieving something in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and so cannot afford to drop their guard . 
What is necessary is finding the right way to support PM [PER Siniora  ] . 
" He is a courageous man , " [PER Dagan  ] said . 
[LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] are working hard against him . 
[PER Dagan  ] noted that much of what is animating the leadership of [LOC Lebanon  ] to take on [LOC Syria  ] is personal: " [PER Hariri  ] , [PER Jumblat  ] and others had their parents executed by the [MISC Syrians  ] . 
" This anti-Syrian sentiment has forged an alliance based on personal and national interests . 
[PER Siniora  ] has worked well with the situation , but [PER Dagan  ] suggested that the odds are against him . 
Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] is trying to give PM [PER Siniora  ] as much support as possible , and that we would continue to consult closely with [LOC Israel  ] on [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
He noted that he would return to [LOC Israel  ] in October. -------------------- MEETING PARTICIPANTS -------------------- 18 , ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Accompanying Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] in the meeting were: -- Ambassador [PER Richard H.
