Reasons 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Acting [LOC Holy See  ] Foreign Minister [PER Parolin  ] reaffirmed August 18 that the [LOC Holy See  ] remained open to [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG EU  ] membership , notwithstanding recent critical comments by Cardinal [PER Joseph Ratzinger  ] . 
[PER Parolin  ] emphasized that the [ORG Holy See’s  ] position on [MISC Turkish  ] membership in the [ORG EU  ] had not changed from the stance it has described to us in the past ( ref a ) . 
If [LOC Turkey  ] meets the [ORG EU’s Copenhagen  ] criteria , [PER Parolin  ] said , the [LOC Vatican  ] sees “no obstacle” to [ORG EU  ] membership . 
He clarified that Ratzinger’s skeptical view of [ORG EU  ] membership for [LOC Turkey  ] reflected the [ORG Cardinal’s  ] “personal feeling , ” and did not reflect the view of the [LOC Holy See  ] . 
[PER Parolin  ] acknowledged that some within the [LOC Holy See  ] harbored concerns about [MISC Turkey’s  ] [ORG EU  ] bid and its potential impact on the [ORG EU  ] , but maintained that he believed these concerns could be addressed over time , and would not represent insurmountable obstacles . 
He acknowledged that Ratzinger’s statement was incorrectly seen as a [LOC Vatican  ] position , and indicated a willingness to consider clarifying its formal position pending discussions with the [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador -- who had yet to raise the issue -- and with FM [PER Lajolo  ] on his return to [LOC Rome  ] later this month . 
End Summary. -------------------------------------------- [LOC Holy See  ] Still Open to [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG EU  ] Membership -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Acting [MISC Vatican  ] Foreign Minister equivalent Monsignor [PER Pietro Parolin  ] told Charge August 18 that the [LOC Holy See  ] remained open to [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG EU  ] membership . 
He affirmed that recent negative comments about [MISC Turkey’s  ] [ORG EU  ] bid by Cardinal [PER Joseph Ratzinger  ] did not reflect any change in the [ORG Holy See’s  ] formal position . 
That position remained that , if [LOC Turkey  ] fully meets the [ORG EU’s Copenhagen  ] criteria , the [LOC Vatican  ] sees “no obstacle” to [ORG EU  ] membership . 
[PER Parolin  ] made it clear that Ratzinger’s take on the issue was his own , and that he was not speaking on behalf of the [LOC Holy See.  ] “These were his personal feelings , ” [PER Parolin  ] added. “Although he is an important member of the [LOC Curia  ] , he does not speak for the [ORG Secretariat of State.” SIPDIS  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- [MISC Turkey’s  ] [ORG EU  ] Bid: Complexities , but no [ORG Great Obstacles  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While [PER Parolin  ] discounted Ratzinger’s comments -- that [LOC Turkey  ] had always been “in permanent contrast to [LOC Europe”  ] and that linking it to [LOC Europe  ] would be a mistake -- as not reflective of [LOC Vatican  ] foreign policy , he did allow that [ORG EU  ] membership for [LOC Turkey  ] would present challenges . 
He noted the difficulty of [MISC European  ] integration for a country with such a different cultural and religious background , citing existent problems with the integration of [MISC Muslims  ] into [MISC European  ] society as reason for caution when examining [MISC Turkey’s  ] [ORG EU  ] hopes . 
He acknowledged that there were others , including former FM Cardinal [PER Tauran  ] , who share Ratzinger’s concerns . 
[PER Tauran  ] had suggested the [ORG EU  ] look first to Orthodox [MISC Christian  ] countries [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Moldova  ] before addressing [MISC Turkey’s  ] membership . 
[PER Parolin  ] affirmed that the [ORG Holy See’s  ] primary concern with [MISC Turkey’s  ] [ORG EU  ] bid remained religious freedom , particularly the juridical status of churches in [LOC Turkey  ] ( ref a ) . 
In his view , the “difficulties and complexities” did not represent an insurmountable obstacle for [MISC Turkey’s  ] [ORG EU  ] membership , but rather necessary topics of reflection that would have to be addressed before moving forward on accession. ---------------------------------- At Odds with [ORG Papal Muslim Outreach  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Charge pointed out that as an [ORG EU  ] member , [LOC Turkey  ] could help to ease tensions between the [MISC Western  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] worlds , illustrating how a secular state with a [MISC Muslim  ] population could cooperate with countries with a [MISC Judeo-Christian  ] heritage . 
He noted that the [LOC Pope  ] , in his outreach to the [MISC Muslim  ] world , has constantly preached the doctrine of inclusion and integration , even while advocating recognition of [ORG Europe’s Christian  ] roots . 
Ratzinger’s comments , by contrast , suggested a permanent state of conflict and division that appeared to run counter to the [MISC Pope’s  ] broader outreach to the [MISC Muslim  ] world , the Charge observed . 
[PER Parolin  ] acknowledged this contradiction , and indicated that he believed it was possible that [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG EU  ] membership could eventually help the [MISC Christian  ] minority and others suffering from a lack of religious freedom in [LOC Turkey.  ] “We certainly hope for that development , ” he concluded . 
Charge also pointed out that [LOC Turkey  ] has for decades been an important member of [ORG NATO  ] that had contributed significantly to the organization’s success ; there was no reason why it could not contribute equally to the [ORG EU.  ] ---------------------- Clarification Possible ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Charge noted the public confusion generated when a senior [LOC Vatican  ] official as influential as Cardinal [PER Ratzinger  ] makes a political statement on such a sensitive issue , and emphasized the importance of clarifying its official position . 
In this regard , Charge passed [PER Parolin  ] an account of [MISC Turkish  ] Prime Minister [PER Tayyip Erdogan’s  ] sharply critical response to Ratzinger’s comments , including the strong reaction by the [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC American  ] media . 
[PER Parolin  ] had not yet seen [PER Erdogan’s  ] comments , and appeared concerned by their bluntness . 
He also indicated his surprise that the [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador had not yet contacted him , though he said it was possible the Ambassador was on summer leave . 
[PER Parolin  ] indicated that he would wait to hear the [MISC Turkish  ] reaction , and would then discuss with FM [PER Lajolo  ] the possibility of issuing some form of clarification of the [MISC Vatican’s  ] stance. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As we saw most notably during the [LOC Iraq  ] war when individual [ORG Cardinals  ] offered personal criticism of USG policy ( refs b , c ) , the media often characterizes the personal views of high-ranking prelates as “Vatican” stances . 
In this case , Ratzinger’s lofty stature in matters of [MISC Catholic  ] theology made the temptation to do so even greater . 
In fact , Ratzinger’s influence in matters of faith and morals does not translate into direct influence upon [LOC Vatican  ] foreign policy , where his expertise is much more limited . 
[PER Ratzinger  ] has been a leading voice behind the [ORG Holy See’s  ] unsuccessful drive to secure a reference to [ORG Europe’s  ] “Christian roots” in the [ORG EU  ] constitution , and he clearly understands that allowing a [MISC Muslim  ] country into the [ORG EU  ] would further weaken his case for [ORG Europe’s Christian  ] foundations . 
In any case , the [MISC Vatican’s  ] official position remains one of cautious , skeptical openness towards [MISC Turkish  ] integration to the [ORG EU  ] . 
In fact , the [LOC Pope  ] , in his February address to [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador [PER Durak  ] essentially acknowledged [MISC Turkey’s  ] future in [LOC Europe  ] , telling [PER Durak  ] that “as [LOC Turkey  ] prepares to establish new relations with [LOC Europe  ] , ” the Church would insist on “fundamental human rights” for [MISC Turkish  ] Catholics .
