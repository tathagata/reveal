06 TUNIS 2570 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Robert F. Godec  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Summary: The [ORG GOT  ] 's decision last summer to revoke [PER Suha Arafat  ] 's [MISC Tunisian  ] citizenship , which had only been granted less than a year earlier , made international headlines . 
Since the appearance of the official register notice on August 7 , the chattering class in [LOC Tunisia  ] has not ceased to speculate about the reasons behind the decision . 
In a mid-October telcon with Ambassador [PER Godec  ] , [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] attributed her ouster to the personal animus of [ORG First Lady Leila  ] Ben [PER Ali  ] , following a dispute over the forced closure of the [ORG Bouebdelli School  ] , a well-respected private school . 
Had it remained open , the [ORG Bouebdelli School  ] would have represented serious competition to the new [ORG Carthage International School  ] , a joint venture between the two [ORG First Ladies  ] . 
It is doubtful that we will ever know all of the facts in this affair , but the stories of corruption swirling around the [ORG Carthage International School  ] have a ring of truth to them . 
Meanwhile , [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] was not shy in sharing with the Ambassador stinging criticism of President [PER Ben Ali  ] , the [ORG First Lady  ] , and the web of corruption that she says surrounds them .

( C ) On August 7 , the [ORG GOT  ] 's Official Journal contained a one-sentence announcement of decree number 2007-1976 of August 2 , 2007 , revoking the citizenship of [PER Suha Arafat  ] , wife of the late [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] President [PER Yassir Arafat  ] . 
As reported Ref B , the [ORG GOT  ] had only granted [MISC Tunisian  ] nationality , by naturalization , to [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] and her 12 year-old daughter [PER Zahwa  ] in September , 2006 . 
( Note: The [ORG GOT  ] did not revoke the citizenship of [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] 's daughter . 
End Note . 
) The [ORG GOT  ] 's decision to revoke the citizenship of [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] came without warning . 
In an early July telcon with the Ambassador , [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] gave no indication that anything was amiss . 
Indeed , she indicated that she would like to meet with the Ambassador when she returned from her vacation in [LOC Malta  ] later in the summer . 
Nor were there any distress signals in Ref A conversation with [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] , which also took place in early summer. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) In a mid-October telcon with the Ambassador , [PER Ms. Arafat  ] blamed her ouster on the personal animus of [ORG First Lady Leila  ] Ben [PER Ali  ] . 
" I can't believe what she 's has done to me , " [PER Arafat  ] exclaimed , " I 've lost everything ! 
" She charged that all of her properties in [LOC Tunisia  ] had been confiscated , even by falsifying documents transferring ownership . 
( Note: It is rumored that [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] had invested -- and lost -- some 2.5 million euros in the [ORG Carthage International School  ] . 
End Note . 
) In addition , she said , her friends and colleagues in [LOC Tunisia  ] , including her banker , had also come under pressure . 
" Anyone who supports me is punished . 
" ---------------------------------------- But , Why ? : The [ORG School Theory  ] , Version I ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] attributed her ouster to her falling out with [ORG First Lady Leila  ] Ben [PER Ali  ] over the [ORG Carthage International School  ] , a new , private , for-profit school , of which they had been co-owners . 
According to [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] 's version of events , the dispute stemmed from [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] 's decision to force the closure of the [MISC Bouebdelli  ] school ( also known as by the name of its parent group , [ORG Le Fondation Louis Pasteur )  ] , a highly respected private school , from which many of [LOC Tunisia  ] 's elite have graduated . 
( Note: The [MISC Bouebdelli  ] school was notified in mid-May that the Minister of Education had ordered it to close , ostensibly for failure to comply with registration regulations . 
Public outcry ensued , fueled in part by a petition and letter-writing campaign organized by parents of [MISC Bouebdelli  ] schoolchildren . 
Many local and international media reports criticized the decision to close the school as a flagrant attempt to stifle potential competition of the [ORG International School of Carthage  ] . 
The fact that parents of [MISC Bouebdelli  ] schoolchildren were encouraged to enroll their children at the [LOC Carthage  ] school only served to fuel these charges , as did the August 29 Presidential decree in which President [PER Ben Ali  ] granted 1,794,600 [MISC Tunisian  ] Dinars ( approximately [LOC US  ] $ 1.5 million ) to the [ORG Carthage School  ] , an estimated 25 percent of its operating budget . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] asserted that [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] had TUNIS 00001489 002 OF 003 overreached in the decision to force the [ORG Bouebdelli School  ] to close . 
She claimed that she had tried to convince the [MISC Tunisian  ] [ORG First Lady  ] that " what we are doing is unethical , " and that competition ultimately would be healthy for the new school . 
Their arguments over this issue continued to escalate , according to [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] , culminating in the decision to revoke her citizenship while she was on vacation in [LOC Malta  ] . 
[PER Mrs. Arafat  ] told the Ambassador that she intends to remain in [LOC Malta  ] , where her brother serves as [MISC Palestinian  ] Ambassador , but that she hopes to spend [MISC Christmas  ] in the [MISC Palestinian Territories.  ] ----------------------------------------- But Why ? : Version II of the [ORG School Theory  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Other rumors have circulated with a different spin on the school story . 
According to this theory , it was [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] who overreached , not [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] . 
Specifically , it is said that [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] convinced the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] to force the closure of the [ORG Bouebdelli School  ] . 
She reportedly did so by invoking the name of [PER Mrs. Ben Ali  ] . 
Critically , though , according to this theory , [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] was not aware that her name was being invoked . 
Thus , the [MISC Tunisian  ] [ORG First Lady  ] was incensed when she learned about the school 's closure -- and her alleged role in that decision -- in the highly critical pieces in the local and international media . 
( Comment: The fact that the [ORG Bouebdelli School  ] did not reopen , even after the revocation of [PER Suha Arafat  ] 's citizenship , would seem to cast doubt on the accuracy of this theory . 
End Comment . 
) ------------------------------------ But Why ? : An Array of Other Theories ------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Plenty of other theories have stoked the rumor mill in the [PER Suha Arafat  ] affair . 
One well-connected [MISC Palestinian  ] resident in [LOC Tunisia  ] told [LOC EmbOff  ] that what sealed [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] 's fate was that on a recent visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] , she had asked [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Qaddafi  ] for money . 
[PER Qaddafi  ] had readily provided a hand-out , but he reportedly subsequently called President [PER Ben Ali  ] to chastise him for failing to provide adequately for the widow of the late [MISC Palestinian  ] President . 
[PER Ben Ali  ] 's acute embarrassment , so the story goes , quickly turned to wrath . 
It was not long before [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] 's citizenship was revoked . 
Another theory holds that [PER Suha Arafat  ] was ousted because she had absconded with a significant amount of the first family 's assets . 
Finally , in the face of persistent rumors that [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] had secretly married [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] , brother of the [MISC Tunisian  ] [ORG First Lady  ] , some commentators chalked up the whole ordeal to the failure of that relationship. --------------------------------------- Scathing Commentary on the [ORG First Family  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) No doubt as a result of her tribulations , [PER Mrs. Arafat  ] was not shy about sharing with the Ambassador her negative impressions of President [PER Ben Ali  ] , his wife , and her family members , whom , she said , collectively represent a web of corruption . 
Drawing on her close contact with the first family over the past several years , she made several allegations , among them the following: -- President [PER Ben Ali  ] remains weakened by his battle with cancer ( NFI ) ; -- President [PER Ben Ali  ] spends all his time playing with his son and following him around the residence ; -- President [PER Ben Ali  ] simply does what his wife asks him to do ; -- [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] and her family are stealing everything of value in the country ; -- [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] believes that she will succeed her husband as President of [LOC Tunisia  ] ; -- The members of [PER Ben Ali  ] 's extended family can do whatever they want with impunity , including the falsification of documents ; -- [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] dropped the [MISC American  ] curriculum that had been planned for the [LOC Carthage  ] school because she fundamentally wants nothing to do with [MISC Americans.  ] ------- TUNIS 00001489 003 OF 003 Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) It is doubtful that we will ever know all of the facts in the [PER Suha Arafat  ] affair , or , for that matter in the [ORG Bouebdelli School/Carthage International School  ] matter . 
Clearly , having been stripped of her [MISC Tunisian  ] citizenship and deprived of her properties here , [PER Suha Arafat  ] has an ax to grind with the [PER Ben Ali  ] clan , so her allegations must be taken with a big grain of salt . 
Although difficult to prove , there is a certain ring of truth to the stories of corruption swirling around the school issue . 
While it is not clear who was behind the [ORG Bouebdelli  ] closure , the ready-made pool of students for whom [ORG Bouebdelli  ] was no longer an option was certainly convenient for filling the classrooms in the [ORG Carthage School  ] 's opening year . 
Indeed , during a mid-September visit to the [ORG Carthage School  ] , [MISC MgmtCouns  ] learned that the school is filled to capacity . 
Beyond that , no school in recent memory has been constructed so quickly , had municipally provided access roads , street signs , and traffic lights installed so efficiently , or had such ease in getting certified ( although it has not yet received the [MISC French  ] accreditation the [ORG Bouebdelli School  ] had ) . 
Nor is it common practice for the GOT to so generously subsidize a for-profit educational institution . 
Finally , it must be noted that the school affair , while rather blatant , is not an isolated case of favoritism and corruption . 
We will continue to follow this issue and report septel on other corruption charges .
