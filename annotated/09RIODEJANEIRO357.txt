( A ) [MISC RIO 329  ] <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
( B ) RIO 346 [ORG Classified By: Principal  ] Officer [PER Dennis W. Hearne  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary: Rio Principal  ] Officer , accompanied by [ORG PAO  ] , met on 23 October with [PER XXXX  ] ( strictly protect ) , XXX for the [ORG International Committee  ] for the [ORG Red Cross  ] ( [ORG ICRC  ] ) in [LOC Rio  ] . 
[PER XXXX  ] has long [ORG ICRC  ] experience in conflict zones . 
It is his assessment that the situation in many [LOC Rio  ] favelas today is , for all practical purposes , a full-blown internal armed conflict , and not simply an urban crime problem . 
While [PER XXXX  ] recognizes he can say nothing of the sort publicly , and that the de jure definition in [ORG International Humanitarian Law  ] for " internal armed conflict " may not describe precisely the violence in [LOC Rio  ] , he makes a compelling case . 
The corollary is that the [ORG ICRC  ] is quietly working in [LOC Rio  ] favelas in much the way it does in other war zones - attempting to establish " humanitarian spaces " for treating or evacuating the wounded , facilitating release of captives , getting services and supplies to civilians isolated by violence , and requesting access ( not yet granted ) to gang members in prison populations . 
The dichotomy of extensive armed conflict raging in a celebrated and highly developed megacity in an economically powerful democracy may be becoming more than [MISC Brazilians  ] can absorb , and frustration and the focusing effect of the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] in [LOC Rio  ] seem to be galvanizing the public and state and federal governments to seek decisive action .

( C ) In a 23 October meeting with Principal Officer and [ORG PAO  ] sought by [ORG ICRC  ] [PER XXXX  ] in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [PER XXXX  ] , XXXXX made a compelling argument that the continuing violence in [LOC Rio  ] , s favelas constitutes , for all practical purposes , a full-blown " internal armed conflict . 
" [PER XXXX  ] said he would never take such a position publicly , given [MISC Brazilian  ] sensitivities , nor does he argue that [LOC Rio  ] , s violence matches in every detail the de jure definition of " internal armed conflict " under [ORG International Humanitarian Law  ] . 
( Note: The relevant definition is in Protocol II of the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] . 
End Note . 
) Nonetheless , in its main features -- i.e. , organized factions holding the monopoly on violence in their areas while in an open conflict with rival factions or/and state forces , the humanitarian impacts on innocent civilians trapped by violence in favelas dominated by gangs , and the need for [ORG ICRC  ] to operate as though in a war zone to create " humanitarian spaces " -- the gang warfare in [LOC Rio  ] , s favelas resembles other situations worldwide that are formally recognized by governments and international organizations as internal armed conflicts , XXX said . 
[PER XXXX  ] speaks with conviction , reflecting his long [ORG ICRC  ] experience in conflict zones , including in [LOC Haiti  ] , in [LOC Uganda  ] and in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , s civil war . 
In the course of the discussion , XXX made the following specific observations: --Currently [ORG ICRC  ] operates in 7 [LOC Rio  ] favelas: Mare , [PER Parada  ] de [PER Lucas  ] , Cidade de Deus , [LOC Cantagalo  ] , [LOC Pavao/Pavaozinho  ] , [MISC Complexo  ] de [PER Alemao  ] , and [PER Vila Vintem  ] . 
State Security Secretary [PER Jose Beltrame  ] is the [ORG ICRC  ] , s senior interlocutor in [LOC Rio  ] . 
[ORG ICRC  ] also has asked for access to the state prison system , which has not yet been accepted ( although he noted that there was support at federal level , including from Justice Minister [PER Tarso Genro  ] ) ; --The [ORG ICRC  ] works to create " humanitarian spaces " in favela conflict areas , proceeding cautiously , first using local NGOpartners such as AfroReggae and [PER Luta Pela Paz  ] . 
In concrete examples , this has meant trying to convince gang factions to recognize certain places -- e.g. , schools , clinics -- as " safe areas , " working to establish mechanisms to locate and negotiate release of hostages , bringing basic supplies ( including food and water ) to civilians who are regularly isolated by the most extreme violence inside areas XXX called " favelas within favelas . 
" [ORG ICRC  ] is also working with former staffers of Doctors Without Borders to address treatment and evacuation of wounded or deceased persons , [PER XXXX  ] said . 
He noted [ORG MSF  ] closed its operation in the notorious [MISC Complexo  ] de [PER Alemao  ] favela when it was not regularly able to fulfill its mandate of treating wounded citizens , owing to the grim fact that the lethality of the conflict in [LOC Rio  ] , s favelas leaves mostly dead victims ; --Now [ORG ICRC  ] is building up its own network . 
Increasingly , its delegates speak directly with leaders of gangs and militias , as well as with police . 
Contact with gang members is not direct initially , but word of [ORG ICRC  ] interest in contacting specific gang leaders is passed through mediators , and mutually acceptable conditions are set for a meeting . 
[ORG ICRC  ] uses clearly marked vehicles and communicates its movements in advance to all sides , just as in other war zones where it operates ; --ICRC also works on health initiatives as well as education , but XXXXX allowed that such activities were , in part , " cover " for [ORG ICRC  ] , s efforts to protect civilians from violence ; --In prisons , [ORG ICRC  ] is concerned primarily with the human rights situation , and with violence driven by gang dynamics . 
There is also an opportunity to meet with imprisoned gang faction leaders to emphasize that [ORG ICRC  ] , s work in favelas is not political , and is intended to alleviate suffering of citizens . 
And there is the humanitarian issue of facilitating contact with prisoners by family members who may not be able to visit prisons because of factional violence ( e.g. , A family member from a favela controlled by one gang may put themselves and their incarcerated relative at risk if they attempt to enter a prison dominated by a rival gang . 
) ; --XXXX applauds the state [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] ( [ORG FPP  ] ) and the community-based Police Pacification Units ( [ORG UPP  ] ) and sees their value in extending government control and reducing the stigma of living in favelas , but does not believe that the plan is sufficient to fundamentally change the security situation , at least not for several years ( ref A ) ; --ICRC must be sensitive and low-profile in its work , and [PER XXXX  ] pointed out his staff is " hidden " in the basement of the historical headquarters building of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Red Cross  ] national organization . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Red Cross  ] is increasingly engaged by [ORG ICRC  ] to assist in its efforts in the favelas. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: One does not have to completely agree with [PER XXXX  ] assessment to concede that this battle-hardened [ORG ICRC  ] professional makes a cogent case for viewing the situation in many of [LOC Rio  ] , s favelas as one of sustained internal armed conflict , as opposed to simply urban criminal violence . 
The [LOC Rio  ] combatants are , of course , rival criminal gangs , militia groups , and the police , as opposed to political or ethnic factions . 
But in the gangs , complete control of geographic areas ( [PER Rio Governor Sergio Cabral  ] recently referred to gang-dominated favelas as " occupied territories " ) , their relatively elaborate command and control structures , their powerful military weaponry , and in the horrendous body count they leave behind , [LOC Rio  ] , s gangs do resemble combatants in recognized internal armed conflicts worldwide . 
A signal distinction is that [LOC Rio  ] , s internal armed conflict is not generalized throughout a national or even regional theater . 
Instead , it is occurring within relatively discreet urban pockets ( though violence can spill outside favelas ) , spread throughout a celebrated and highly developed megacity , one of two ( with [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ) in a democratic country with one of the world , s largest economies . 
That cruel and decades-old dichotomy may have become , finally , more than [LOC Rio  ] residents and [LOC Brazil  ] , s leaders can absorb , and their frustration and the focusing energy of the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] seem to be galvanizing state , municipal and federal government . 
There is a growing consenus that now is the time to confront the plague of violence in [LOC Rio  ] in a decisive manner , but it remains to be seen whether [LOC Rio  ] , s [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] , possible new federal-level public security initiatives , and additional funding for public security will be sufficient to help [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] quell its long internal armed conflict .
