( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) On January 11 , Minister of Finance [PER Steingrimur J. Sigfusson  ] called in [ORG CDA  ] to express the [MISC Icelandic  ] government 's desire for the [ORG IMF  ] review to take place as scheduled and to seek [ORG USG  ] support within the [ORG IMF  ] . 
( Note: Prior to the President 's refusal to sign the [ORG Icesave  ] bill into law , the next [ORG IMF  ] review was expected to take place in mid-January . 
End note . 
) [PER Sigfusson  ] stated that he was briefing key countries and , in fact , the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador was next in line . 
He noted that the government and parliament had done what was required by the [ORG IMF  ] . 
Further delay of the [ORG IMF  ] program , he stated , would increase enormously the additional negative economic effects caused by the president 's decision . 
Although [LOC Iceland  ] does not need funds urgently , he said , receiving the next tranche would help bolster confidence in the system . 
Building up the reserves would also make it easier to implement the next phase of lifting capital controls and help stabilize the interest rate. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) Both [PER Sigfusson  ] and Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] continue to reach out to their counterparts in the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Netherlands  ] , and the [MISC Nordic  ] countries . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] just returned from a trip to [LOC Norway  ] and [LOC Denmark  ] , and has been in contact with [MISC British  ] Chancellor of the Exchequer Darling and [MISC Dutch  ] Finance Minister [PER Bos  ] , while [PER Sigurdardottir  ] has communicated with the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Ministers . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] said that neither the [LOC UK  ] nor the [MISC Dutch  ] have shown any flexibility and continue to demand that [LOC Iceland  ] honor the deal ; however , all three countries remain committed to keeping open lines of communication. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) [PER Sigfusson  ] , contrary to media reports , expressed doubts regarding the possibility of enlisting a mediator or renegotiating the [ORG Icesave  ] deal . 
Although the [ORG GOI  ] will not exclude these possibilities , it is moving forward in anticipation of the referendum and plans to argue for a " yes " vote from the electorate . 
It is also unlikely , he said , that the [ORG GOI  ] would consider recalling the bill , thus negating the need for a referendum , without a realistic option on the table. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) [PER Sigfusson  ] acknowledged that the President 's decision injected additional political uncertainty into the situation . 
Although he would not categorically state whether or not the ruling coalition would fall should the [ORG Icesave  ] referendum fail , he admitted that the [ORG Icesave  ] issue will likely hurt the coalition 's chances for reelection. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU/NF  ] ) [ORG CDA  ] expressed continued [ORG USG  ] support for [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG IMF  ] program and reiterated the [ORG USG  ] 's position of neutrality and desire for a speedy resolution regarding the [ORG Icesave  ] issue . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] was pleased to hear that details of the meeting would be shared with [ORG Treasury  ] and indicated a desire to speak directly with DAS [PER Christopher Smart  ] about [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG IMF  ] program .
