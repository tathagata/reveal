<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L ASHGABAT 001288 SIPDIS STATE FOR SCA/CEN ; EEB ; NEA/IR ENERGY FOR EKIMOFF/BURPOE/COHEN COMMERCE FOR EHOUSE EO 12958 DECL: 10/13/2019 TAGS PGOV , PINR , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC ENRG  ] , [LOC TX  ] SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN: FORMER DEPUTY CHAIRMAN FOR OIL AND GAS TACHBERDI TAGIYEV ARRESTED REF: ASHGABAT 0876 Classified By: Charge [PER Sylvia Reed Curran  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Former Deputy Chairman for Oil and Gas [PER Tachberdi Tagiyev  ] was arrested in mid-September allegedly on suspicion of corruption , according to multiple sources in the expat business and foreign diplomatic community . 
[PER Tagiyev  ] was serving at the time as head of the oil refinery at [LOC Turkmenbashi  ] . 
According to our sources , [ORG Tagiyev’s  ] houses and vehicles in [LOC Ashgabat  ] were also seized. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Always also mentioned in the same breath as [ORG Tagiyev’s  ] arrest is a rumored internal investigation of Berdimuhamedov’s son-in-law , [PER Dovlet Atabayev  ] , who heads the [LOC London  ] office of the [ORG State Agency for Management  ] and Use of [ORG Hydrocarbon Resources  ] . 
Supposedly , the young man is in trouble for having acquired some nice real estate in the [LOC London  ] area. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) COMMENT: When [PER Tagiyev  ] was fired in July ( reftel ) , the suspicion was that it was connected with the dispute with [ORG Gazprom  ] . 
Someone had to take the blame for the problems with [LOC Russia  ] , and it could not be the President . 
Suspected corruption could also have been a factor . 
It was widely known during [ORG Tagiyev’s  ] time as Deputy Chairman that in order for energy companies to get high-level meetings ( including with President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] ) , a little “something , something” should be offered to the various gatekeepers , including [PER Tagiyev  ] . 
Since many officials are involved in corruption , corruption itself is rarely the issue . 
Sometimes the official has irritated the President for other reasons , and corruption is the handy excuse for prosecution . 
Often , as may have been the case with [PER Tagiyev  ] and may be the problem with the son-in-law , ostentatious corruption lands these officials in hot water . 
END COMMENT .
