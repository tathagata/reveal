( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] [ORG African National Congress Youth League  ] ( [ORG ANCYL  ] ) President [PER Julius Malema  ] probably has received more publicity from the news media in recent months than any other ruling party figure . 
( Note: “Mail and [MISC Guardian”  ] political writer [PER Mandy Rossouw  ] has even recently published a book about [PER Malema  ] . 
End Note . 
) He was the most vocal member of the ruling party during the ANC’s 2009 national election campaign , and his public presence does not seem to be waning now that the new government is in place . 
It has never been adequately answered whether [PER Malema  ] speaks on his own or with backing from senior leaders of the party . 
Regardless of whether his views are sanctioned , however , it is becoming clearer that President [PER Jacob Zuma  ] respects [PER Malema  ] and his place within the movement . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) There has hardly been a day in [LOC South Africa  ] since the national election in April that [ORG ANC Youth League  ] President [PER Julius Malema  ] has not been in the news . 
In recent months , he has been featured in a front page profile article from the “Mail and [MISC Guardian  ] , ” a front page article in the “Sunday Independent , ” and on numerous radio interviews -- including [ORG Talk Radio  ] 702 and Five FM . 
He has been in the news for doing commendable things such as meeting with and supporting [ORG University of the Free  ] State Chancellor [PER Jonathan Jansen  ] last month following the university administrator’s decision to allow students to return to campus following a racist incident . 
He has also been in the news for doing questionable things such as hosting wild parties in northern [LOC Johannesburg  ] that reportedly rage late into the evening and are fueled by alcohol and sex . 
Moreover , [PER Malema  ] has been involved in several court cases in front of the [ORG Equality Court  ] . 
Most recently , a judge on November 2 delayed a case in the Court in which [PER Malema  ] is accused of hate speech . 
[PER Malema  ] earlier this year told an election rally that the woman who accused [PER Zuma  ] of rape in 2006 “had a nice time.” ( Note: The [ORG Sonke Gender Justice Network  ] said the comment was damaging to rape victims and women who were afraid to lodge rape complaints . 
End Note . 
) Clearly , [PER Malema  ] is a force in [MISC South African  ] politics . 
Here are some of the reasons [PER Malema  ] has been in the news: -- On October 29 , [PER Malema  ] met with [ORG University of the Free  ] State Chancellor [PER Jonathan Jansen  ] about his recent decision to pardon the racist behavior of four white students for a 2007 video in which they made black university employees eat contaminated food . 
The decision was controversial because many saw it as one that was made without wide consultation and without acknowledgment that the video was harmful to a non-racial , non-sexist [LOC South Africa  ] . 
The [ORG Youth League  ] initially said that [PER Jansen  ] should be fired and alluded to the government’s new crime strategy of “Shoot to [PER Kill”  ] in saying that those who excuse racism are criminals who deserve to be shot . 
After meeting with [PER Jansen  ] , however , [PER Malema  ] told protesting students at the university that they should support the chancellor because he “is one of our own.” The [ORG ANC Youth League  ] President noted that the [ORG ANC  ] would not agree with any calls that the professor should step down because he is a “symbol of transformation.” [PER Malema  ] also encouraged Qis a “symbol of transformation.” [PER Malema  ] also encouraged [PER Jansen  ] to follow through on a pledge to establish a reconciliation program that would be monitored by the [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] . 
-- On October 25 , [PER Malema  ] said the [ORG ANCYL  ] would work to ensure that [PER Caster Semenya  ] can run as a girl in the future ( FYI: Semenya’s gender is a medical question being investigated by the [ORG IAAF  ] ) . 
[PER Malema  ] in recent months has been one of Semenya’s strongest supporters . 
He greeted her at the airport after she returned from [LOC Europe  ] as a disputed champion in track and field and told reporters that if she were white there would be no question of support from [MISC South Africans  ] . 
At the October 25 session with reporters , [PER Malema  ] blasted the media for “trying to divert the country from celebrating her victory.” He said that when the [ORG Youth League  ] speaks on her behalf , it is doing so because of the poor treatment young women receive in rural areas . 
-- On October 21 , he visited [LOC Standerton  ] in [ORG Mpumalanga Province  ] to investigate ongoing service delivery protests . 
The protests have been some of the most violent in the [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00002263 002.2 OF 003 country this year . 
Following Malema’s meetings with residents and provincial and municipal officials , the [ORG ANC  ] fired the mayor of [LOC Lekwa  ] municipality , the mayoral committee , the speaker of the council and the chief whip . 
-- On October 20 , the [ORG ANCYL  ] President told reporters that [LOC South Africa  ] would nationalize the country’s mines for extra revenue . 
He said , “The nationalization of the mines will happen , the [ORG Freedom Charter  ] says that.” He then added , “We want the [ORG ANC  ] in conference in 2012 to pronounce what is the stand of the [ORG ANC  ] on the nationalization of mines ... we need decisive leadership , we don’t want cowards.” ( Comment: [ORG ANC  ] Treasurer [PER Mathews Phosa  ] , who is often the voice of reason countering Malema’s statements , told [MISC British  ] businesses in early November that the [MISC South African  ] Government would not nationalize the mines . 
End Comment . 
) -- On October 14 , [PER Malema  ] was reportedly stopped for speeding on the road between [LOC Polokwane  ] and [LOC Seshego  ] . 
When his vehicle was pulled over , the [ORG ANC Youth League  ] President is said to have berated traffic officials and asked , “Do you know who I am ? ” [PER Malema  ] then called numerous senior [ORG ANC  ] and government officials and instructed them to discipline the traffic officers . 
A general manager for traffic was ultimately called to the scene and the following day he asked traffic officials to write letters describing how “they mistreated the youth [ORG leader.” Roads Department  ] spokesperson [PER Wisani Ngobeni  ] told reporters that the allegations surrounding the incident were all “a hoax” and “hearsay.” Deputy Transport Minister [PER Jeremy Cronin  ] , however , told the “Sowetan” on November 4 that his ministry is investigating the incident because “nobody is above the law.” -- In late September , [PER Malema  ] was in the news for hosting a wild party at his [LOC Sandton  ] home that included a live band and alcohol . 
When neighbors went to complain about the noise , [PER Malema  ] reportedly asked them “Do you know who I am ? 
Do you know what I can do ? ” He then reportedly slapped a police reservist. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Admittedly , part of the reason [PER Malema  ] is so prominent in the news is because the public is fascinated by him and his outlandish statements , which sell newspapers and draw listeners . 
[PER Rossouw  ] , who published the most definitive account of [LOC Malema  ] so far , has told [PER Poloff  ] in past meetings that [PER Malema  ] speaks for many working class and poor [LOC South Africans  ] and that the [PER Zuma  ] government has effectively used [PER Malema  ] to address difficult issues which would be difficult to tackle without alienating core supporters. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Yet , another part of the reason [PER Malema  ] features in the news is that he is extremely ambitious and wants to advance in [ORG ANC  ] structures . 
There are rumors that [PER Malema  ] currently has the final say over [ORG ANC  ] and government officials in [LOC Limpopo  ] regarding what companies get tenders and what individuals get jobs . 
There is speculation that [PER Malema  ] wants to take over from [PER Joe Maswanganyi  ] as Limpopo’s [ORG ANC  ] provincial secretary at the [MISC ANC’s  ] congress in 2012 . 
There also are rumors that he sees this as a stepping stone toward succeeding [LOC Cassel  ] Mathale as provincial chair in 2016 , which could lead to the provincial premiership. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: Malema’s continued media prominence begs the question: Where is President [PER Zuma  ] on some of these issues ? ( See reftel . 
) After all , it was [PER Malema  ] who went to [LOC Mpumalanga  ] and [LOC Limpopo  ] to quell violent service delivery [LOC QMpumalanga  ] and [LOC Limpopo  ] to quell violent service delivery protests . 
It was [PER Malema  ] who argued recently -- and extensively -- that [LOC South Africa  ] intends to nationalize the mines . 
It was [PER Malema  ] who visited with [PER Jansen  ] after the decision to pardon university students . 
On none of these issues did [PER Zuma  ] make a statement . 
In fact , Zuma’s only comment regarding these issues may have been when he declared publicly on October 26 that [PER Malema  ] is a “good leader worthy of inheriting the [MISC ANC.”  ] ( Note: There were reports that [PER Zuma  ] told [PER Malema  ] before going to [LOC Standerton  ] that he needed to be careful of his statements . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A long string of [ORG ANC Youth League  ] Presidents have won notoriety for making outrageous statements ; viz mid-’90s League President [PER Peter Mokaba’s  ] frequent use of the slogan “kill the [LOC Boer/kill  ] the farmer , ” at the very time when [PER Nelson Mandela  ] was campaigning for reconciliation and peace . 
One respected political analyst commented to us recently that he would be worried if a [ORG Youth League  ] President did not go around sounding off like this , and that having someone saying [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00002263 003.2 OF 003 such things might even serve as something of a safety valve by making disgruntled youth feel that their anger was being heard by the [MISC ANC’s  ] senior leaders . 
We are nonetheless concerned that , as a generation which does not remember the struggle against apartheid comes to adulthood , they may be less content to accept mere rhetoric to express their anger at what they may see as continuing inequality .
