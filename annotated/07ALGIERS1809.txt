<code><pre>S E C R E T ALGIERS 001809 SIPDIS SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 12/19/2027 TAGS PTER , PINS , [ORG ASEC  ] , AG SUBJECT: AFTER THE LATEST ALGIERS BOMBINGS: THIS WILL BE A LONG HAUL Classified By: Ambassador [PER Robert Ford  ] , reason 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: The December 11 bombings in [LOC Algiers  ] demonstrate that [ORG Al-Qaida  ] in the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) can adapt its tactics to discredit the [MISC Algerian  ] government even if it cannot destabilize the state . 
Its tactics have evolved and it is more frequently targeting foreigners . 
[ORG AQIM  ] seeks to copy tactics used by [ORG Al-Qaida  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] and we expect in the future to see [ORG AQIM  ] resort to operations such as kidnapping , attacks by women suicide bombers and more suicide vests , for example . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] security forces appeared to enjoy some success dampening [ORG AQIM  ] operations in October and November , but there is no sign that they can completely secure the capital . 
Indeed , they are warning in public and private that they cannot . 
Their public line is , therefore , that the country must soldier on even with the occasional terrorist atrocity . 
Behind closed doors , however , the December 11 bombings have opened a debate about whether President [PER Bouteflika’s amnesty  ] program is appropriate or not ; some in the security services want to cast it aside and use an iron fist . 
According to the [MISC Portuguese  ] ambassador , who joined his prime minister in a meeting with [PER Bouteflika  ] on December 16 , the [MISC Algerian  ] president appeared shaken and unsure of how to respond to the bombings . 
His advisors appear glum , and [PER Bouteflika  ] himself has yet to say anything to the nation in the wake of the bombings . 
Looking forward , we see a terror organization able to adapt and shift tactics and targets facing a government that easily holds military superiority but is not exactly sure what more it can or should do . 
None of our contacts think the security services will be able to prevent new attacks . 
They do not know when those attacks might occur or what form they will take . 
Thus , the security situation could stay roughly as it is now , or it might deteriorate further ; we do not expect it to improve . 
Our contacts all expect more terror attacks , although none knows when or what form they will take . 
[ORG Al-Qaida  ] tactics in [LOC Iraq  ] are probably the best guide . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] has already adopted stricter security measures for staff and dependents and is urging the non-official [MISC American  ] community in forums like the [ORG OSAC  ] to do the same . 
In the weeks and months ahead , we will have to reevaluate our posture more frequently in response to the greater [ORG AQIM  ] threat . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------------------- [ORG AQIM  ] IS AN ADAPTIVE ORGANISM ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG AQIM  ] is using a variety of tactics to keep the [MISC Algerian  ] government guessing and that are slowly raising concerns among the foreign community and the broader public in [LOC Algiers  ] . 
The following list shows the evolution of [ORG AQIM  ] tactics: -- Summer 2006: ambushes with roadside bombs and gunfire against [MISC Algerian  ] army patrols in the mountains east of [LOC Algiers  ] ; -- October 2006: first car bombs in years in the [LOC Algiers  ] region , hitting two police stations ; -- December 2006: first attack on foreigners in years , using a roadside bomb to hit a [MISC U.S.-Algerian  ] company bus in [LOC Algiers  ] suburb , killing two ( no Amcits ) ; -- February 2007: multiple , coordinated , powerful car bombs in towns scattered in the mountains outside [LOC Algiers  ] ; -- March 2007: another roadside bomb against a bus full of foreigners , this time a [MISC Russian  ] company bus west of [LOC Algiers  ] ; -- April 2007: suicide van and truck bombs simultaneously hit Prime Minister’s offices in downtown [LOC Algiers  ] and destroy a police station east of the city center near the airport ; there were two suicide vehicles against the police station in a tactic very similar to that seen in [LOC Iraq  ] ; -- July 2007: suicide truck bomb hits [MISC Algerian  ] army base at [LOC Lakhdaria  ] , east of [LOC Algiers  ] , killing dozens of soldiers ; -- September 2007: another suicide truck bomb , this one driven by a 15 year old , hits [MISC Algerian  ] coast guard base at [LOC Dellys  ] , east of [LOC Algiers  ] , again killing dozens ; -- September 2007: first suicide vest attack , this one directly targeting President [PER Bouteflika  ] in [LOC Batna  ] , 200 miles east of [LOC Algiers  ] ; -- September 2007: drive-by suicide car bomb attack on a [MISC French/Italian  ] company convoy in the mountains east of [LOC Algiers  ] -- September 2007: suspected planning of a kidnapping of two [MISC French  ] nationals working at the [LOC Algiers  ] airport leads to the sudden departure of the two men ; -- December 2007: roadside bomb attack again targets a [MISC Russian  ] company bus west of [LOC Algiers  ] ; -- December 2007: simultaneous suicide truck bombs destroy [ORG UN  ] offices and damage [ORG Supreme Court  ] building in central [LOC Algiers  ] ; one of the truck drivers was 64 years old , something heretofore unseen here. --------------------------------------------- EXPECT MORE ATTACK METHOD VARIATION A [ORG LA IRAQ  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The [ORG Al-Qaida  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] network , which already has ties to jihadi groups in [LOC Algeria  ] , has strong influence on [ORG AQIM  ] elements . 
The suicide bomber in July 2007 was nicknamed “Abu Musaab” because he was so enamored with [PER Zarqawi  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG AQIM  ] videos strongly resemble videos from [LOC Iraq  ] in terms of the music , Quranic citations and filming of hits on enemy targets they show . 
They strongly pitch the alleged [MISC American  ] wrongdoings in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] to recruit men to join [ORG AQIM  ] . 
[ORG AQIM  ] is also copying tactics we have seen in [LOC Iraq  ] , including use of suicide vehicle bombs and vests . 
( Comment: Notably , during the 1990s violence in [LOC Algeria  ] , there was only one suicide attack . 
We have now seen nine since April 2007 . 
End Comment . 
) Water Resources Minister [PER Abdelmalek Sellal  ] , who previously held top jobs in the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , warned Ambassador on December 16 that it would be easy to imagine [ORG AQIM  ] resorting to SVBIEDs driven by women or women attacking a target wearing a suicide bomb vest . 
Security officers at other embassies have pointed to the use of kidnappings in [LOC Iraq  ] and worry that [ORG AQIM  ] could actively start such a campaign in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
Historically , [ORG AQIM  ] has paused between vehicle bomb attacks , although we do not know if that is due to resource constraints or tactical decisions . 
History suggests we may have a pause lasting as long as months before the next car bomb attack , although it could be much sooner . 
In any case , our intelligence is incomplete and we may not see the next attack , in whatever form it takes , coming. ----------------------------------- [LOC IRAQ  ] AND [LOC PALESTINE  ] HELP RECRUITMENT ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A prominent conservative [MISC Islamist  ] political leader , [PER Abdallah Djaballah  ] , told the Ambassador on December 17 that the suicide attacks demonstrated the influence of the [MISC Iraqi  ] jihadis whose appeal to religious sensitivities finds a ready audience here . 
In addition , he noted , [MISC Islamist  ] extremists released under the government’s amnesty program are hugely frustrated because they can find no jobs and lack any means to support themselves . 
They are easy to recruit , he claimed . 
AQIM’s choice to put a video of [PER Ayman Zawahari  ] ranting about [LOC Palestine  ] last week is likely to further boost recruitment . 
The website has had over 35,000 hits in a week . 
[PER Djaballah  ] warned that many young [MISC Algerians  ] react strongly to any suggestion that foreign forces are attacking [MISC Islam  ] itself , and [LOC Palestine  ] , along with [LOC Iraq  ] , is the perfect symbol . 
[PER Jaghloul Abdelghafar  ] , a counselor at the Presidency working on extremism issues , echoed the point about [LOC Algeria  ] suffering because of [LOC Palestine  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] to the Ambassador December 18 . 
He stated that there is a “hard-core five percent” that will always plague [LOC Algeria  ] . 
Political scientist [PER Lyes Boukraa  ] , who has written two books about the terrorism phenomenon in [LOC Algeria  ] , told DCM December 18 that he thought the terror groups have more potential recruits than they need. ------------------------------------- [MISC ALGERIAN  ] SECURITY FORCES: FRUSTRATED ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The [MISC Algerian  ] government is trying to figure out how best to contain and eliminate the extremist problem . 
[MISC Algerian  ] military forces conducted major sweeping operations in the troublesome mountains east of [LOC Algiers  ] as well as along the eastern border region near [LOC Tebessa  ] in November . 
They also continued to try wrapping up [ORG AQIM  ] support networks and , until the December 11 bombings , they appeared to be having some successes . 
The number of security force casualties reported in the press dropped steadily in October and November 2007 from the spike seen in September 2007 due to the [ORG AQIM  ] suicide attack in [LOC Dellys  ] . 
In contrast to 1994-1996 , the [MISC Algerian  ] army and gendarmerie can deploy to any location in the country and immediately establish control . 
[ORG AQIM  ] in its December 12 communique felt obliged to tell the government very directly that it had not disappeared. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The government now is warning the public that it cannot completely contain the terrorist threat . 
Interior Minister [PER Zerhouni  ] told the press after the December 11 bombings that there was no such thing as perfect security posture since bomb attacks were so easy . 
Other terror attacks are possible even though the terror groups are weakening , [PER Zerhouni  ] told the press December 12 . 
He also commented that the security forces had relaxed somewhat after their successful security measures for the November 29 local elections , and the suicide bombers had exploited that opening . 
Head of the [ORG Defense Ministry’s External Relations Director General  ] Sefendji told DATT on December 17 that the [MISC Algerian  ] military had enjoyed successes in combined air-ground operations against terrorist groups in mountainous areas , but they could not stop suicide attacks in [LOC Algiers  ] . 
[ORG National  ] police chief ( DGSN director ) [PER Ali Tounsi  ] told the press on December 15 that the security services had put in place special measures to protect the [ORG Constitutional Council  ] in view of the threat information the [ORG GOA  ] had . 
However , he commented , there was no way to protect against such an “exceptional” attack . 
[PER Tounsi  ] pledged that the [ORG GOA  ] would stand up new , stronger security measures in [LOC Algiers  ] in the wake of the December 11 bombings . 
Pressed by Ambassador for details about the measures on December 18 , [PER Tounsi  ] would only say that police reinforcements would surge into the capital in the coming days . 
He declined to give more details but said he would consider the Ambassador’s strong suggestion that the DGSN brief the key ambassadors about the new security plan . 
( Comment: [PER Tounsi  ] appeared not entirely on top of the brief and probably couldn’t have provided many details even if he had wanted to . 
The [ORG Interior Ministry  ] is avoiding repeated requests from embassies for information on [ORG Interior Ministry  ] plans and operations . 
End Comment . 
) ----------------------- HARD LINE OR SOFT TOUCH ? ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Water Resources Minister [PER Sellal  ] , who is often rumored to be on a short list to be the next prime minister , told Ambassador December 16 that the [ORG GOA  ] ought to strike much harder against the terrorists than it is doing . 
He was entirely in favor of the iron fist , he stated flatly . 
However , he noted , current political reality ( “la conjuncture politique” ) does not allow for such a tough policy . 
Indeed , Prime Minister [PER Belkhadem  ] had reiterated on December 12 that [MISC Bouteflika’s  ] signature national reconciliation program would continue . 
[PER Ahmed Fattani  ] , publisher of [ORG L’Expression  ] newspaper who has good contacts in the security services , told Ambassador December 17 that many in the security forces want to launch a broad campaign of arrests . 
For this reason , he said , they leaked to him information that some 250 of the [MISC Islamist  ] extremists previously released under President [MISC Bouteflika’s  ] amnesty program had rejoined the [ORG AQIM  ] fight against the government . 
[PER Fattani  ] claimed that some in the security services said the number was even higher , but [ORG L’Expression  ] used the 250 number so as not to anger [PER Bouteflika  ] further. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Bouteflika  ] himself has made no public remarks in the wake of the December 11 bombings . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] ambassador , who accompanied his prime minister in a meeting with [PER Bouteflika  ] on December 16 , told the Ambassador on December 18 that [PER Bouteflika  ] appeared very distressed by the [LOC Algiers  ] bombings and unsure of what to do . 
According to the [MISC Portuguese  ] , [PER Bouteflika  ] urged [MISC Portuguese  ] Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] to convince [MISC European  ] states to help the [MISC Algerian  ] security services . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] reportedly asked for advice on how to secure fixed sites and sought help from the [MISC Europeans  ] to tap cell phones whose SIM cards are changed . 
One of [MISC Bouteflika’s  ] aides , [PER Rachid Aissat  ] , who was the [MISC Algerian  ] DATT in [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Moscow  ] in the 1960s , earnestly asked the Ambassador on December 16 for help in countering car bombs . 
The [ORG GOA  ] , he conceded , had no good sense of how to respond . 
( Comment: Many of our contacts interpret [MISC Bouteflika’s  ] silence since December 11 to his embarrassment that both suicide bombers were previously known to the security services and had benefited from the provisions of the national reconciliation program . 
End Comment . 
) ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [ORG AQIM  ] is very far from being able to bring down the [MISC Algerian  ] government but it can certainly make it look weak and foolish . 
From a narrow security perspective , the December 11 attacks represent not so much the result of diminished [MISC Algerian  ] security capabilities as a successful change in [ORG AQIM  ] targeting to hit the [ORG UN  ] and the [ORG Constitutional Council  ] . 
Security and military contacts have been asking us for a technological fix for the car bomb threat for months . 
They do not seem to fully appreciate the fact that they are now fight an al-Qaida group , and not just the old [MISC Algerian  ] terrorist group [ORG GSPC  ] of the late 1990s . 
[ORG AQIM  ] subscribes to international jihadist goals as well as attacking the [MISC Algerian  ] government . 
The more success the [ORG GOA  ] has killing the senior terrorist leaders from the [ORG GSPC  ] , the more quickly the newer amirs recruited under the al-Qaida banner will rise to the forefront. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Looking forward , we can imagine that the security situation could stay roughly as it is now or deteriorate ; we do not expect it to improve . 
None of our contacts think the security services will be able to prevent more terrorist attacks . 
They do not know when those attacks might occur or what form they will take . 
AQIZ tactics in [LOC Iraq  ] are probably the best guide . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG GOA  ] is slow at best to share information with us . 
As a result , the [MISC Embassy  ] has taken stricter security measures for staff and dependents , and upgraded security of our chancellery and main staff residence . 
We are telling the non-official community in forums like the [ORG OSAC  ] to do the same . 
In the weeks and months ahead , we will need to reevaluate our posture more frequently in response to the greater [ORG AQIM  ] threat .
