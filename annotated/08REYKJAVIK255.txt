1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The brutally sudden collapse of the [MISC Icelandic  ] banking system earlier this month threatens severe economic hardship for the citizens of this import-dependent economy . 
The government has reached a tentative agreement with the [ORG IMF  ] for a [MISC USD  ] 2.1 billion loan , but must raise an additional [MISC USD  ] 4 billion from other sources to conclude the arrangement . 
They have asked us to join what they hope will be a consortium of lending countries by providing [MISC USD  ] 1 billion . 
Despite the obvious hurdles - [LOC Iceland  ] 's status as a developed [MISC European  ] economy , the extent of its need , our own limited resources - this request deserves the most careful consideration: we have long-term national interests in the [MISC North Atlantic  ] that a negative response would jeopardize . 
These include: 2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's strategic importance to [LOC U.S.  ] security . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has hosted an important [MISC American  ] military outpost since [MISC World War II  ] . 
During the years before we redeployed our forces in 2006 , the [LOC U.S.  ] poured a quarter of a billion dollars annually into our base at [LOC Keflavik  ] . 
We turned the base over to [LOC Iceland  ] 's custody in September 2006 , handing over responsibility to [LOC Iceland  ] as [ORG NATO  ] host nation for maintaining the airport and long-range radar installations on behalf of the alliance . 
In the subsequent two years , the Icelanders have provided outstanding support to two large multination [ORG NATO  ] exercises , two [LOC U.S.  ] naval visits , and several deployments of [ORG NATO  ] air policing . 
[MISC French  ] , [MISC Norwegian  ] , and [LOC U.S.  ] fighters have shadowed [MISC Russian  ] bombers and fighter planes from [LOC Keflavik  ] . 
Because the [MISC Icelandic  ] government has maintained the facilities at top-notch operational standards , the base is immediately usable should circumstances warrant . 
A nation crushed by economic depression cannot be the self-sufficient partner we have spent decades and huge amounts of [LOC U.S.  ] taxpayer dollars to develop . 
3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) A well-positioned friend in the [LOC High North  ] . 
If the [LOC U.S.  ] doesn't help out [LOC Iceland  ] when it is flattened by the worst financial crisis in its history , we shouldn't expect the country to see it our way when we ask - as we undoubtedly will -- for cooperation in furthering our own security and economic aims in this increasingly vital region . 
The [ORG NATO  ] conference that [LOC Iceland  ] is hosting to discuss [LOC High North  ] issues this coming January underlines the uncertain implications of the environmental changes occurring in [LOC Iceland  ] 's [MISC North Atlantic  ] neighborhood . 
The melting [MISC Arctic  ] ice means new trade routes and increased competition for gas , petroleum , and other resources . 
The [MISC Russians  ] - who are discussing a loan with the Icelanders - have already signaled their interest in exploring and exploiting [LOC Iceland  ] 's potential undersea oil and gas fields . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] - whom the Icelanders are also approaching for a loan - will be big users of the new sea lanes . 
[LOC Iceland  ] may be small but it is valuable real estate in a region that will only become more important to our economic welfare and our national security . 
We want a firm friend and a stable ally. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>Â¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Clean energy partner and economic investment . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is a world leader in renewable energy and stands to play a significant role in [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to become energy independent . 
They have know-how and enterprise and their experience in harnessing geo-thermal energy is second to none . 
[MISC American  ] firms are capitalizing on [LOC Iceland  ] 's abundant clean energy and technical expertise by investing close to [MISC USD  ] 4 billion in the aluminum sector here . 
We want [LOC Iceland  ] to be in a position to attract foreign investment and continue to develop its energy sector outreach . 
A bankrupt economy would set our partnership back for years just when we need [LOC Iceland  ] 's technical skills and entrepreneurial drive most . 
5 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] is reaching out with increasing desperation to any available source of help as it confronts one of the most trying crises in its history . 
Assistance from the [LOC U.S.  ] at this crucial time would be a prudent investment in our own national security and economic well being . 
The Icelanders take fierce pride in their flawless history of paying back their debt . 
Whatever the financial turmoil and uncertainty of the moment , it 's a good bet that this economy of highly-educated , imaginative , and sophisticated people will take off again . 
And when it does , and when the competition in the [LOC High North  ] really gets underway , it may be more important than we can yet suppose to have the Icelanders remember us as the kind of friend who stands by in fair weather and foul. van Voorst</pre></code>
