( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] After an emergency cabinet meeting lasting into the evening to discuss the appropriate [MISC Brazilian  ] response to [LOC Bolivia  ] 's May 1 nationalization of foreign oil and gas investments ( ref A ) , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] issued a stunningly bland public statement the evening of May 2 recognizing [LOC Bolivia  ] 's sovereignty to act as it did but reaffirming that the [ORG GOB  ] would act to protect the interests of ( partially-privatized parastatal ) [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
According to local media , President [PER Lula  ] will meet his counterparts from [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] on May 4 in [LOC Puerto Iguazu  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] to discuss the situation . 
In contrast to the [PER Lula  ] administration 's feeble public stance , [MISC Brazilian  ] media commentary has been sharp , decrying [LOC Bolivia  ] 's use of troops to occupy oil and gas installations ; some have called for [LOC Brazil  ] to withdraw its Ambassador to [LOC Bolivia  ] ( ref F ) . 
Although [ORG Petrobras  ] may resort to arbitration to protect the approximately [MISC US$1.6  ] billion it has invested in [LOC Bolivia  ] , this amount represents only about 2% of [MISC Petrobras'  ] worldwide investments . 
Given that [MISC Bolivian  ] gas makes up only 4% of [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall energy consumption , most analysts foresee limited impacts even if the gas supply were to be interrupted . 
End Summary . 
Bending to Evo 's Will ? ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] 's formal reaction to the nationalization operation finally emerged early on the evening of 2 May , after marathon meetings chaired by [PER Lula  ] that began at 11:00 am and extended throughout the day . 
The stunningly brief and anodyne presidential press release -- the insipid fruit of an entire day of [MISC Lula-led  ] crisis-mode deliberations for which two cabinet ministers had been called back to [LOC Brasilia  ] from abroad -- consisted of only five points in which the [ORG GOB  ] recognized [LOC Bolivia  ] 's right to " nationalize the riches of its soil and control their industrialization , transport and commercialization , " affirmed the [ORG GOB  ] will act " with firmness and tranquility in all fora " to preserve [MISC Petrobras'  ] rights and carry out mutually beneficial negotiations with [LOC Bolivia  ] , and assured that supplies of natural gas to [LOC Brazil  ] are guaranteed by the will of both countries , as reiterated in a telephone conversation between [PER Morales  ] and [PER Lula  ] ( presumably on 2 May ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The tepid reaction from the presidency -- despite expectations from senior [ORG GOB  ] advisors that [PER Lula  ] would have to make some strong point of protest ( see below ) -- may well fuel criticisms in the opposition and media that the [ORG GOB  ] 's policy toward [PER Morales  ] has been shown to be disastrously inept . 
The announcement that [PER Lula  ] will go [LOC Argentina  ] this week to meet [PER Morales  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] -- who is now widely considered in [LOC Brazil  ] to be the guarantor of [LOC Morales'  ] bold action -- may further reinforce the negative impressions of a president caught asleep at the switch and unwilling to stand up forcefully for vital [MISC Brazilian  ] interests . 
Foreign policy is seldom a major issue in [MISC Brazilian  ] presidential campaigns , but it is a certainty that this episode will feature prominently in the opposition 's campaign. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a private meeting on 2 May ( ref G ) , [PER Marcel Biato  ] , [PER Lula  ] 's deputy foreign affairs advisor , provided insight on the thinking within [PER Lula  ] 's inner circle on the day after [PER Morales  ] made his move . 
The [ORG GOB  ] was not surprised by the content of the nationalization decree -- those are the uncompromising terms [MISC Brazilian  ] negotiators have been hearing for the past 7-10 days . 
[PER Biato  ] said that in March , [ORG Petrobras  ] and [MISC Bolivian  ] interlocutors had been engaged in what appeared to be relatively positive discussions . 
However , [PER Morales  ] abruptly broke the talks off , insisted he would only discuss the issues with [PER Lula  ] directly , and the [MISC Bolivians  ] only re-engaged in recent days , with the stark message they took public on 1 May . 
In the interval between the March talks and the nationalization , [PER Biato  ] observed there was a lot of [PER Morales  ] interaction with [PER Chavez  ] . 
( [PER Note: Per  ] ref D , [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Lula  ] met in [LOC Brasilia  ] on 20 April ; in the meeting [PER Lula  ] was to register his concern about the nature of [MISC Venezuelan  ] involvement with [PER Morales  ] on the hydrocarbons issues . 
End note . 
) It is clear now to the [ORG GOB  ] that [PER Morales  ] was emboldened after hearing that [PER Chavez  ] would ( a ) provide technical help to get gas out of the ground if [ORG Petrobras  ] bails ( which the [ORG GOB  ] doubts the [MISC Venezuelans  ] have the know-how to do ) , and ( b ) buy the product . 
( Comment: This view has now taken hold in the [MISC Brazilian  ] media and opposition as well . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While not surprised by the terms of yesterday 's decree , the timing , lack of diplomatic notice and use of the armed forces ( presumably for dramatic impact in [LOC Bolivia  ] and to show the military 's solidarity with [PER Morales  ] in the action , [PER Biato  ] opined ) angered the [ORG GOB  ] , who anticipated that early [MISC Brazilian  ] references to the action as " unfriendly " would be echoed by [PER Lula  ] in his statement . 
[PER Biato  ] noted there is a domestic requirement that [PER Lula  ] " say something tough " now at a political level , though the [ORG GOB  ] wants to avoid turning this into a [LOC Morales-Lula  ] slugfest . 
( Comment: [PER Biato  ] was wrong -- the anemic presidential statement contains no hint of criticism or official displeasure . 
End comment . 
) As talks proceed over the next six months , [PER Biato  ] said options available to [LOC Brazil  ] include: ( 1 ) [ORG Petrobras  ] operates but prepares to break contractual obligations ( e.g. , non-payment to [LOC Bolivia  ] , with the line that [PER Morales  ] can just deduct what he wants from [LOC Bolivia  ] 's debts to [ORG Petrobras  ] ) . 
[ORG GOB  ] would prefer not to compromise its legal standing by breaking a contract , however , [PER Biato  ] said ; ( 2 ) [ORG Petrobras  ] prepares to pull out unilaterally ; ( 3 ) [ORG Petrobras  ] starts arbitration . 
The latter course looks most likely at this point , [PER Biato  ] said ( but see below ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) However , [ORG Petrobras  ] will not/not accept a massive price increase under any circumstances , and will also not accept a role as just a service provider , [PER Biato  ] confirmed . 
Those are red lines for both the company and the [ORG GOB  ] , as [PER Morales  ] has been told repeatedly . 
In that sense , [PER Biato  ] said " this is a poker game , " where [LOC Brazil  ] 's interests are big , but [LOC Bolivia  ] 's potential for loss is much bigger . 
But in poker , as in diplomatic negotiations , the players must have some sense that their opponents are operating from a base of logic and rationality . 
At this point , the [ORG GOB  ] 's senior level has lost confidence that [PER Morales  ] possesses those qualities , [PER Biato  ] said . 
There is a sense in the [ORG GOB  ] that [PER Morales  ] , " just put this out there , did what he wanted to for his own political reasons , and now expects all the rest of us to sort it out , " [PER Biato  ] said . 
Again , the influence of [PER Chavez  ] must come to mind , [PER Biato  ] acknowledged . 
[ORG Petrobras: Evo Engaging  ] in " [MISC Scare Tactics  ] " ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite [ORG Petrobras  ] President [PER Sergio Gabrielli  ] 's previous public statements that it would leave [LOC Bolivia  ] rather than accept nationalization or become simply a service provider , after the occupation of its oil and gas facilities by [MISC Bolivian  ] troops [ORG Petrobras  ] has hewn to the [PER Lula  ] administration 's bland 2 May public response . 
A Brasilia-based [ORG Petrobras  ] contact told us the company 's strategy after the statement is to let this issue remain at the government-to-government level . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] employees have essentially been told to stay put , shut up , keep their heads down , and let the [MISC Brazilian  ] government negotiate with the [MISC Bolivian  ] government . 
According to our [ORG Petrobras  ] contact , the company regards the timing and drama of the action primarily as a negotiating tactic . 
The slow and contentious contract renegotiations , the pipeline break of last month and the ongoing repairs have obviously called into question [LOC Bolivia  ] 's position as a stable supplier for the [MISC Brazilian  ] gas market . 
The threat of nationalization is meant , he said , to scare [ORG Petrobras  ] and others back to the negotiating table and make them more willing to accept [MISC Bolivian  ] government terms . 
Short Term [LOC Bolivia  ] Risk Already Figures In ------------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A number of contacts have told Econoffs that financial markets already had factored in substantial [LOC Bolivia  ] risk into [ORG Petrobras'  ] share price and expect little disruption in the short term . 
[PER Roberto Troster  ] , the Chief Economist at [LOC FEBRABAN  ] ( the [MISC Brazilian  ] banking industry association ) said that financial circles are in a " wait and see " mode , since there does not appear to be a threat that gas supplies will be cut in the near term and because [LOC Bolivia  ] is such a small percentage of [ORG Petrobras  ] assets . 
Likewise , a [ORG Banco Pactual  ] analyst saw limited effects on [ORG Petrobras  ] in the short term as [LOC Bolivia  ] accounts for less than 3 percent of the company 's oil and gas production and about 2 percent of [ORG Petrobras'  ] US$66 billion assets . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] shares , which opened on the [MISC NYSE  ] May 2 with a small drop , made up the lost ground and closed up overall . 
Limited Economic Impact foreseen -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While gas from [LOC Bolivia  ] is 43-44 percent of the natural gas consumed in [LOC Brazil  ] , it makes up only about four percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's total energy consumption . 
Gas is used principally for cooking , gas-fueled cars and buses , industry ( iron and steel , chemical , ceramics , glass ) and power generation . 
A [ORG Petrobras  ] contact told post that the company 's contingency plan in the event of a gas shortfall is to cutback on gas-fired electricity generation plants to preserve supply for other uses . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is in a good position to do so as currently the reservoirs at [LOC Brazil  ] 's hydroelectric power plants , which make up well over 80% of [LOC Brazil  ] 's power generation capacity , are at high levels . 
This will preserve scarcer gas supplies for industrial uses ( which generate employment ) , as well as domestic and transportation uses . 
A May 2 [ORG Credit Suisse First Boston  ] report estimated that the inflationary and growth impact of the nationalization ( or any reduction in supplies from [LOC Bolivia  ] ) will be low based on the availability of hydroelectric power to supply energy demands . 
Medium to Long Term Alternatives -------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] recently had dusted off its contingency plans to deal with gas supply shortfalls after the [LOC Bolivia  ] pipeline was damaged by recent rains ( ref C ) . 
Local analysts also have pointed out that [LOC Brazil  ] has alternatives in the longer term , as development of the offshore [LOC Campos  ] basin will provide a new domestic gas source to rival the size of current [MISC Bolivian  ] supply in the 2010 to 2012 time frame ( ref I ) . 
In the medium term , however , [LOC Brazil  ] could face a crunch , as expected power demand is projected to exceed projected capacity in the 2009 time-frame . 
Removing the gas-fired thermal generation plants from the power mix likely would bring forward the moment when [LOC Brazil  ] faces power generation shortfalls . 
Industry contacts have told us that the gas-fired electricity generation plants ( many of which are presently idle as hydro power is cheaper ) could be converted to diesel or oil to help deal with the situation . 
The process , however , would take some time and would be expensive ( ref H ) . 
Separately , [ORG Petrobras  ] is examining the feasibility of building two [ORG Liquid Natural Gas  ] ( [ORG LNG  ] ) re-gasification plants , reportedly at a cost of about [MISC US$400  ] million each , to allow gas imports from countries such as [LOC Nigeria  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On the political level , [PER Lula  ] and his foreign policy team could not look worse at this moment . 
The image of [MISC Bolivian  ] soldiers moving into [ORG Petrobras  ] installations is vivid and offensive for [MISC Brazilians  ] of all classes , and will appear to many as a massive rebuke to the [PER Lula  ] administration 's theology of a [MISC Brazilian-led  ] new era of " regional integration . 
" Indeed , in the [MISC Brazilian  ] press and popular imagination , [PER Lula  ] is increasingly seen as outmaneuvered , manipulated and flim-flammed by his " hermanos , " [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Morales  ] . 
The PSDB opposition and much of the media can be counted on to keep this episode alive , pointing it out as another defeat for [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy , and blistering evidence that the ideological bias and operational incompetence of [LOC Lula'  ] government can place key [MISC Brazilian  ] national interests in peril. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On the economic front , [LOC Brazil  ] is likely far less vulnerable to serious immediate damage from [ORG Morales'  ] May 1 nationalization decree than the headlines suggest . 
Although there is clear potential for a medium term energy crunch and certain gas-consuming [MISC Brazilian  ] industry may be hurt , the [ORG GOB  ] has the luxury of time and resources to work on alternatives . 
This makes [PER Lula  ] 's weak-kneed response to the spectacle of [MISC Bolivian  ] troops occupying [ORG Petrobras'  ] facilities -- which itself followed on the heels of [ORG Morales'  ] expulsion last week of [MISC Brazilian  ] steel company EBX -- all the more puzzling . 
Although [ORG Petrobras  ] may nevertheless ultimately seek arbitration , depending on the evolution of events , it will be much harder for it do so without more energetic [ORG GOB  ] backing .
