( B ) THE HAGUE 01903 Classified By: [ORG RSO  ] JOHN HUCKE , REASONS 1.5 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Dutch National Coordinator for Security and Public Safety  ] contacted the [ORG RSO  ] on 07/30 and advised that the incident had actually occurred on 07/26 and not 07/27 as he originally told the embassy . 
As an aside he stated he would determine why he wasn't informed until the evening of 07/27 . 
From other sources we now believe the delay occurred at the lowest level of law enforcement and that the Coordinator contacted us shortly after the report actually came to him. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) LEGATT Brussels met with the controlling prosecutor and the Police in [LOC Rotterdam  ] this morning and afternoon .

There has been a marked improvement in information sharing regarding this case . 
The prosecutor instructed the Police to keep the [ORG LEGATT  ] informed . 
Accordingly there has been a stream of calls doing so . 
While the flow is somewhat fragmentary , important developments are being reported , virtually in real time . 
The two subjects have been closely monitored and were arrested separately , one this morning and the other this afternoon , both without incident . 
Two , as yet unidentified , associates were also arrested . 
[ORG LEGATT  ] reports the Police are searching two houses and two vehicle as of 1710 hours . 
One house is the residence of the subject [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the ownership/occupancy of the other hose is currently unknown . 
It is know that the subjects were followed to this location yesterday .

Police advise that an [PER Uzi SMG  ] was found at the other residence . 
The Prosecutor has authorized continued detention of all of the subjects based on the recovery of a firearm .
