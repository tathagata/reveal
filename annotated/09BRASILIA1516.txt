( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
The Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) expressed disappointment and frustration with the [ORG Conference of the Parties-15  ] ( [ORG COP-15  ] ) to the [ORG UN Framework Convention  ] on [ORG Climate Change  ] ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
President [PER Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  ] principally blamed the position of the [LOC United States  ] on mitigation , which he called " too little " and one that did not evolve during the conference . 
The modest [ORG USG  ] goal for 2020 led to [LOC Europe  ] not increasing its mitigation proposal from 20 percent to 30 percent for 2020 , he explained , and the [ORG USG  ] 's position incentivized [LOC Japan  ] and others to try to eliminate the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
Still , [LOC Brazil  ] accepts the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] and sees it as a step forward . 
Moreover , [PER Lula  ] crowed that [LOC Brazil  ] had the best image at [LOC COP15  ] due to its ambitious proposal . 
END SUMMARY DISAPPOINTMENT AND FRUSTRATION , MAINLY WITH [ORG USG  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] press has generally viewed the [ORG Conference of the Parties-15  ] ( [ORG COP-15  ] ) to the [ORG UN Framework Convention  ] on [ORG Climate Change  ] ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) in [LOC Copenhagen  ] as a failure . 
President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula  ] da [PER Silva  ] , however , has taken a slightly more moderated stance . 
He has not called [LOC COP15  ] a failure nor a fiasco . 
In fact , [PER Lula  ] commented that the final results were " better than expected " compared with the low expectations at the beginning of the conference . 
[PER Lula  ] and the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation have expressed deep frustration on the lack of progress at [LOC COP15.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Lula  ] has singled out the [LOC United States  ] for particular criticism . 
In his December 21 weekly radio address , [PER Lula  ] said the [ORG USG  ] offered " very little " with respect to a 2020 mitigation goal . 
Earlier he told the press that he had wanted to see an improvement or evolution of the [ORG USG  ] position at [LOC COP15  ] , but that didn't happen . 
In his weekly address , he elaborated that the [ORG USG  ] isn't a member of the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] and that with some members of the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] ( [LOC Japan  ] and others ) they pressed for an end to the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
In an earlier interview , [PER Lula  ] linked the [MISC Europeans  ] not raising their proposed reduction in emissions for 2020 from 20 percent to 30 percent to the [LOC United States  ] not making a better offer. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key members of the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation echoed [PER Lula  ] 's comments about the [LOC United States  ] and expanded on the theme . 
Presidential Chief of Staff and presidential candidate [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] called the [ORG USG  ] financing offer , together with others , of [MISC US$30  ] billion through 2012 " ridiculous compared to the needs of the developing world . 
" Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] said at the close of [LOC COP15  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] was disappointed with the results . 
He criticized President [PER Obama  ] , saying the people of the planet expected more of a [MISC Nobel  ] prize winner . 
[PER Minc  ] then urged [PER Obama  ] in the upcoming negotiations " to do something or return the [MISC Nobel  ] prize . 
" However , a key scientific advisor on the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation , Professor [PER Jose Goldemberg  ] of the [ORG University of Sao Paulo  ] , said that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's participation at [LOC COP15  ] was strong and positive , though he added that President [PER Obama  ] probably could have been more effective if he had arrived earlier. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There was criticism for other countries besides the [LOC United States  ] . 
Minister [PER Minc  ] said there had been " bad faith " from various sides . 
He criticized [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] by name , saying that they and others had sought to block the [LOC COP15  ] from approving the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
He added that " there were too many people staring at their navels , and also a climate of distrust that was very bad . 
" The [MISC Brazilian  ] press points to [LOC China  ] as impeding progress through its recalcitrance over allowing international verification . 
[ORG BRAZIL  ] THE HERO <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Lula  ] has portrayed [LOC Brazil  ] as a white knight at [LOC COP15  ] . 
In his radio address , he stated that " [LOC Brazil  ] was considered , during the entire summit , to be the country that presented the best proposal , as the country that worked on this issue correctly . 
" He highlighted [LOC Brazil  ] 's role in working with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] to reach an agreement . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's Ambassador for [ORG Climate Change Sergio Serra  ] told the press that [LOC Brazil  ] had helped mediate between President [PER Obama  ] and the [MISC Chinese  ] to conclude the [ORG Copenhagen Accord.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [PER Lula  ] reiterated the [MISC Brazilian  ] offer to reduce its emissions by 36.1 to 38.9 percent by 2020 compared with " business as usual , " post-COP15 he and his team have remained quiet about [LOC Brazil  ] 's willingness to contribute to a global climate change fund . 
On financing , however , [PER Lula  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] will implement its mitigation activities entirely through its own will . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is not conditioning its efforts on outside financing , though they clearly anticipate receiving significant sums from abroad . 
[PER Lula  ] underscored in his radio address that the mitigation actions [LOC Brazil  ] presented at [LOC COP15  ] have now been enacted as part of domestic legislation . 
With this legislation in place , he explained , [LOC Brazil  ] 's ambitious position on climate change is no longer just " [PER Lula  ] 's position , " but the law , and the next president will have to comply with that law . 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite disappointment and frustration with [LOC COP15  ] , [PER Lula  ] said that he was optimistic about his relationship with [PER Obama  ] . 
He declared , " I am an optimist . 
I think that [PER Obama  ] may produce a pleasant surprise . 
" He added , " I expect at [LOC COP16  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] that we will arrive at an agreement . 
I think this is possible . 
" [PER Lula  ] stated , " Between now and [LOC COP16  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] the world needs to do all it can to reach an agreement . 
" COMMENT <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Lula  ] , his team , and the [MISC Brazilian  ] press left [LOC Copenhagen  ] frustrated and disappointed . 
They attributed much of the lack of progress there to what they viewed as a modest proposal on mitigation by the [LOC United States  ] that did not improve over the course of the conference . 
Nonetheless , [LOC Brazil  ] accepts the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] and is proud that it was part of the small group that negotiated it . 
Despite the grumbling , [LOC Brazil  ] is neither disowning the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] nor backing away from its ambitious proposals on mitigation . 
END COMMENT .
