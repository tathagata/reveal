06 [ORG KINSHASA  ] 1309 Classified By: EconOff W.Brafman for reasons 1.4 b/d/e. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [ORG GDRC  ] arrested the top official of the [ORG DRC  ] 's [ORG Atomic Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG CGEA  ] ) on March 6 , but thus far specific charges have not been made public . 
According to media reports , Professor [PER Fortunat Lumu Badimbayi-Matu  ] , the [ORG CGEA  ] Commissioner and director of [LOC Kinshasa  ] 's [ORG Nuclear Research Center  ] ( [ORG CREN-K  ] ) , is being held in [LOC Kinshasa  ] along with [ORG CREN-K  ] 's Scientific Director . 
EconOff reached [PER Lumu  ] by phone the morning of March 8 , and although he confirmed his arrest , he said could not discuss the matter with EconOff until later in the day . 
According to uncorroborated information from the [ORG Congolese National Police  ] , the investigation may widen and more arrests may occur . 
Further , members of the presidential circle also reportedly met to discuss the matter. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Initial reports in [MISC Congolese  ] opposition newspaper [ORG Le Phare  ] indicated [ORG CGEA  ] officials were charged with trafficking of uranium " bars " and " casques , " but subsequent reports in [ORG Le Phare  ] and another paper have offered other possible reasons . 
( Comment: It is not clear what is meant by casques , but it may be a reference to the heavy , 20 square inch containers that [PER EmbOffs  ] saw at [ORG CREN-K  ] during their July 2006 tour of the facility ( reftel A ) . 
As noted in reftel A , during that July tour , [MISC EmbOffs  ] found no evidence the containers were radioactive or held uranium , popular rumors notwithstanding . 
End comment . 
) One line of speculation is that the arrests are in connection with the [ORG CGEA  ] 's September 2006 partnership deal with [LOC Brinkley Africa  ] , [ORG Ltd.  ] a subsidiary of [ORG London Alternative Investment Market-listed Brinkley Mining  ] ( reftel B ) . 
[PER Lumu  ] reportedly approved this deal , for the purpose of developing nuclear research projects and mining uranium . 
( [PER Note: Brinkley  ] 's website characterizes the agreement as a Memorandum of Understanding . 
End note . 
) [ORG CREN-K  ] and the [ORG CGEA  ] fall under the mandate of the [ORG Ministry of Scientific Research  ] , but it is the [ORG Ministry of Mines  ] that has the authority to approve mining concessions . 
The extent of involvement of either [ORG Ministry  ] in this agreement remains opaque . 
Normally , mining agreements must have both ministerial and presidential approval. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG CREN-K  ] facility , which includes two non-operational research reactors , has 138 nuclear fuel rods and a store of nuclear waste , to which [PER Lumu  ] has access ( reftel C ) . 
[MISC British  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] and [MISC French  ] diplomats toured [ORG CREN-K  ] March 7 , and although they did not specifically discuss the recent arrests , the diplomats neither observed nor did the facility staff mention any unusual activity . 
Uranium is found naturally in [LOC Katanga  ] province , fifteen hundred miles southeast from [LOC Kinshasa  ] , but it is not currently industrially mined ( reftel D ) .
