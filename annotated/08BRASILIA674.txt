( C ) Summary . 
[PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , President [PER Lula  ] 's top domestic policy adviser and apparent favorite to succeed him in 2010 , greatly increased her chances of being her party 's 2010 presidential candidate by an impressive performance before hostile questioning in the [ORG Senate Infrastructure Services Committee  ] on May 7 . 
[PER Rousseff  ] was called to testify on the [ORG Growth Acceleration Program  ] ( [ORG PAC  ] ) ( ref A ) , a keystone of [PER Lula  ] 's second term , as well as her alleged involvement in a scandal over misuse of government credit cards ( refs B , C ) . 
[PER Rousseff  ] performed superbly under pressure , with a thorough command of facts and an unflappable demeanor . 
The presidential palace celebrated and media observers declared her stronger than before . 
Opposition politicians acknowledged mistakes and vowed to have at her again in another committee . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , Chief of the [MISC Civil Household  ] , appeared before the [ORG Senate Infrastructure Services Committee  ] on May 7 to testify on the progress of the [ORG Growth Acceleration Program  ] , a keystone of [PER Lula  ] 's second term . 
Her appearance resulted from a surprise move by opposition senators who caught their government coalition colleagues off guard when they did not have enough votes to defeat the motion . 
The real purpose of bringing her to the committee was to question her on the recent leak to media of data about the use of government credit cards in the [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] ( [ORG FHC  ] ) administration ( 1995-2002 ) . 
The data are privileged , and opposition leaders accused the government of compiling a " dossier " and deliberately leaking it to the media to even the score and divert attention from the damage done over misuse of the cards in the [PER Lula  ] administration , which brought down a cabinet minister ( ref C ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Rousseff  ] 's performance before the committee could have damaged or sunk her presidential prospects if it had gone poorly . 
But [PER Jose Agripino Maia  ] ( [MISC Democrats  ] , opposition ; of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do [ORG Norte  ] ) , the leader of his party in the [ORG Senate  ] , blundered badly when very early in the hearing he noted that she had once said she had lied to military interrogators during the dictatorship , an obvious provocation suggesting she might lie to the committee . 
[PER Rousseff  ] replied that she was brutally tortured by the military and was proud to have lied under torture because it saved the lives of others fighting the dictatorship . 
With this dramatic and unassailable comeback , [PER Rousseff  ] was in complete control of most of the rest of the nearly eight-hour hearing , and even some usually combative opposition senators treated her with muted deference. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Making extensive use of slides on a laptop computer in front of her , [PER Rousseff  ] demonstrated an extensive and detailed knowledge of the [ORG Growth Acceleration Program  ] , a 504 billion reals ( about USD 300 billion ) growth and investment stimulus package that is being implemented under her direction . 
When the subject turned to what the opposition calls a " dossier " of data on credit cards used in the [ORG FHC  ] administration , which the government calls a " data bank , " [PER Rousseff  ] agilely deflected repeated parries by opposition senators , again showing a thorough understanding of the data and how it is kept , controlled , and accessed . 
She claimed to have been the greatest victim of the data leak , and insisted that the leaker should be found and held accountable . 
On May 8 it was revealed that the [ORG Federal Police  ] and government technicians had discovered that the Secretary of Internal Controls for the [MISC Civil Household  ] sent the data to a opposition [ORG Senate  ] staffer , who may have leaked the data to the media . 
The case is still under investigation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) After-action evaluations by media and political analysts concluded that [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] survived her trial by fire brilliantly , and Senator [PER Agripino Maia  ] 's opening gaffe embarrassed the opposition and left it in temporary disarray . 
President [PER Lula  ] and government coalition politicians publicly heaped praised on [PER Rousseff  ] . 
The president of the [ORG Senate  ] , [PER Garibaldi Alves Filho  ] ( [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  ] , government coalition ; of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do [ORG Norte  ] ) said [PER Rousseff  ] 's testimony had " exhausted " the subject , convinced him there was no so-called dossier , and the temporary [ORG Committee  ] of [ORG Congressional Inquiry  ] into the credit card matter should reach the same conclusion. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: Wishful thinkers in the opposition had written off [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] as a political corpse after police discovered that the data leak came from the [MISC Civil Household  ] . 
But after her performance at the [ORG Senate  ] and the apparent discovery of the leaker , it appears improbable that the opposition will be able to unseat her as [PER Lula  ] 's designated successor any time soon . 
[PER Lula  ] remains solidly behind her , and although she still needs to attract broad national support to win the presidency , it is now more likely than ever that she will be the [ORG Workers' Party  ] 2010 presidential candidate .
