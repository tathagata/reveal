End summary . 
IRAN: OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S VIEW ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a January 13 meeting with members of [PER Staffdel Kessler  ] , [PER Francois Richier  ] , [ORG Strategic Affairs Advisor  ] to President [PER Sarkozy  ] , addressed the issue of imposing enhanced sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Richier  ] explained that the [ORG GOF  ] was developing a package of measures that largely targeted the [ORG Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  ] because of its economic holdings and its role as a weapons proliferator . 
This package would include: --Finance - The [ORG GOF  ] is willing to include the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] in targeted sanctions , most likely through some of its subsidiary bodies . 
[LOC Paris  ] is also trying to target an [MISC Iranian Sovereign Wealth Fund  ] which it recently learned has a branch in [LOC Germany  ] . 
[LOC France  ] would also seek to impose sanctions that would cut [LOC Iran  ] 's ability to conduct " correspondent banking . 
" --Transport - These sanctions would ban [MISC Iranian  ] ships from ports and harbors in [LOC Europe  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] envision the possibility of enhanced sanctions that would trace [MISC Iranian  ] ships that have been re-flagged to obscure their origin . 
In addition , [MISC Iranian  ] air cargo planes would be banned from [ORG EU  ] airports. --Insurance and re-insurance - Given the limited number of actors in the re-insurance industry , [LOC France  ] believes prohibiting re-insurance coverage in [LOC Iran  ] would be an effective sanction. --Oil and Gas - [LOC Paris  ] proposes a ban on technical cooperation and investment in [LOC Iran  ] , a well as prohibiting exports of refinery equipment and spare parts for oil and gas industries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Richier  ] said he expects the [ORG EU  ] will agree to " complement " any eventual [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) and [LOC France  ] hopes for a short timeline to secure a new [ORG UNSCR  ] in early February before securing approval at the Council of [ORG EU  ] Foreign Ministers later that month . 
[PER Richier  ] said that we will have to decide whether to accept grudging [MISC Russian  ] concessions in order to get a [ORG UNSCR  ] that may be weak and limited , or whether to " waste time " trying to lobby for a [ORG UNSCR  ] that will be , at best , only marginally better . 
[PER Richier  ] noted that it would be helpful if the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] did not act on sanctions legislation at least until the [ORG UNSCR  ] debate is concluded and he said it might be best to have [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions legislation reference the new [ORG UN  ] resolution . 
Regarding potential [MISC Chinese  ] opposition , he hoped for agreement on a new [ORG UNSCR  ] ( as the prior ones were unanimous ) , but would accept a simple abstention . 
[PER Richier  ] expects [LOC Russia  ] will support the measure because the [MISC Russians  ] were " shocked " by the discovery of the uranium enrichment site in [LOC Qom  ] . 
Nevertheless , the [MISC Russians  ] still need time to adjust their thinking to this reality. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [MISC European  ] countries face three main difficulties in deciding on sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] , according to [PER Richier  ] , and he outlined them as follows: --Most [MISC European  ] countries want a [ORG UN  ] framework , including a new [ORG UNSCR  ] . 
[PER Richier  ] pointed out that a signal from the [MISC Obama  ] administration that we are also prepared to move forward would be very helpful. --Determining the nature of sanctions: Some [ORG EU  ] countries want to put the [ORG UN  ] decision into [ORG EU  ] law , but the [MISC French  ] want to go beyond that and target different sanctions that we are unlikely to get from the next [ORG UNSCR.  ] --Some countries simply hesitate to support sanctions for a variety of reasons , whether protecting their own economic interests , or on ideological grounds . 
This is manageable , but complicated by individual circumstances , according to [LOC Richier.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOF  ] remains concerned about enforcing sanctions with [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] , said [PER Richier  ] , because both have considerable ties to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that [LOC Turkey  ] has made clear it does not want to suffer economically , as it has in the past . 
[PER Richier  ] noted [LOC France  ] 's concern over [LOC Turkey  ] 's " regional policy " towards [LOC Iran  ] , whereas it views [LOC Brazil  ] 's engagement as being more nave and possibly based on misinterpretation of the [MISC Obama  ] decision to try engagement first ( without [LOC Brazil  ] knowing what limits on that engagement should be ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Richier  ] was skeptical that sanctions aimed at exporters of refined oil to [LOC Iran  ] would be effective , although the [ORG GOF  ] has pushed for this , because such a policy would require a verification mechanism requiring an investment of military ships along [LOC Iran  ] 's long coastline and other resources . 
[PER Richier  ] believes such a policy would send a signal to exporters worldwide , but it would be too hard to implement , and would likely only dissuade the honest exporters . 
When asked about [MISC French  ] oil company Total and pending [LOC U.S.  ] congressional legislation , [PER Richier  ] replied Total has not made new investments in [LOC Iran  ] , although it is involved in a buy-back arrangement and said sales of Total 's refined products in [LOC Iran  ] are declining . 
IRAN: MFA SHARES ELYSEE'S VIEWS ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) On January 14 , [PER Martin Briens  ] , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's [MISC DAS-equivalent  ] for Non-Proliferation , largely confirmed what [PER Richier  ] had said , but he provided additional information . 
[PER Briens  ] also highlighted [MISC French  ] ambitions to get a new [ORG UNSCR  ] approved and implemented at the February 25 Foreign Ministers meeting . 
However he said " tough and fast " in the [ORG UNSC  ] was unlikely , so we would probably have to settle for fast . 
A total arms embargo , which [LOC Russia  ] had previously opposed but [LOC China  ] had not , would be a major victory , assuming [LOC Russia  ] actually supported it. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Briens  ] asserted that the June election in [LOC Iran  ] and its aftermath had " changed the equation " within the [ORG EU  ] with respect to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He allowed that pending [LOC U.S.  ] measures will " also enter into the equation . 
" Several countries besides [LOC France  ] , including [LOC Spain  ] , have come to the conclusion that it is time to move from sanctions that specifically target proliferation activities to ones that have a broader impact . 
Given the delays in implementing the last [ORG UNSCR  ] on [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC France  ] and close partners had received [ORG EU  ] approval to prepare modalities of implementation " in parallel " to negotiations in the [ORG UN  ] . 
The [ORG GOF  ] has come to the view that the [ORG EU  ] should take " autonomous " measures that are not merely a magnified application of [LOC UNSCRs  ] , but it is still unclear how far [ORG EU  ] partners would go in this direction . 
[LOC France  ] has noted the UKs adoption of a process to designate individual foreign entities for sanctions and it is now considering doing the same . 
The [ORG GOF  ] also believes that national governments can do more through [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] decisions made by the [ORG G8.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In addition to the potential package of sanctions outlined by [PER Richier  ] ( para 2 ) , [PER Briens  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] wants the [ORG EU  ] to: --Impose a " prior authorization " approach on all [ORG Iran Central Bank  ] transactions which would allow truly sovereign operations by the [ORG Central Bank  ] to be approved , but it would allow greater scrutiny and control , and would slowdown the processing of transactions. --Cast a wide net in banning/targeting [ORG IRGC  ] persons and entities. --Ban trade in equipment for internal repression and identify people involved . 
[PER Briens  ] shared [PER Richier  ] 's doubts on the efficacy of trying to block refined petroleum products ( " the bad guys will just get rich " ) but the technology and parts for the oil and gas sectors , especially for refining should also be denied to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Finally , on the issue of gaining [LOC China  ] 's participation , he suggested emphasizing regional stability and recruiting countries in the region to put pressure on [LOC China  ] as well . 
AFGHANISTAN: KARZAI NEEDS TO FOLLOW UP ON INAUGURATION SPEECH -------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On January 14 [PER Jasmine Zerinini  ] , head of the [ORG GOF  ] 's interagency [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] cell , acknowledged that public opposition in [LOC France  ] to the troop presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] has grown steadily over the past several years , but that this has not resulted in calls for withdrawal or even a significant change in strategy . 
Regarding coordination between the [ORG International Security Assistance Forces  ] , [PER Zerinini  ] said that there had been a great deal of improvement , but that the approach was still too fragmented . 
She said that [LOC France  ] has recognized for the past year that the forces stationed in the north of the country were unable to handle the growing insurgency there . 
General [PER McChrystal  ] understands this , she added , but this has not translated into action. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On civilian assistance , [PER Zerinini  ] said [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC French  ] plans to deploy more civilians are unlikely to bear fruit , because ultimately only the [MISC Afghans  ] themselves can bring effective development . 
However , she opined , the [PER Karzai  ] administration has not shown that it is capable of doing this . 
Although [PER Karzai  ] 's inauguration speech in November was a good first step , he has done nothing since then . 
Therefore , she said , the [LOC London  ] conference is coming far too early - the goal of [LOC London  ] was to renew our partnership with [PER Karzai  ] , but this is difficult without a real roadmap for progress from the [MISC Afghans  ] . 
PAKISTAN: REINFORCING POLITICAL RELATIONS ----------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Zerinini  ] said [LOC France  ] is working to reinforce its political relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] , and was expecting President [PER Sarkozy  ] to visit [LOC Pakistan  ] " early in the second quarter " of 2010 . 
The [ORG GOF  ] does not want to return to a relationship based on military equipment sales , as in the 1980s , and is instead focusing on counter terrorism in addition to economic and trade links . 
[LOC France  ] is also trying to support an [MISC EU-Pakistan  ] dialogue , but she said [LOC Pakistan  ] makes it difficult by rejecting conditionality and attempting to focus exclusively on economic issues . 
[PER Zerinini  ] said the [MISC Pakistani  ] government is eager for trade concessions , but does not want any political dialogue unless it is focused on [MISC Kashmir.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) On the role of the [MISC Pakistani  ] military , [PER Zerinini  ] said General [PER Kayani  ] has " learned the lesson of [MISC Musharraf  ] " and was staying behind the scenes . 
However , he is manipulating the government and parliament , including to prevent change on [LOC Pakistan  ] 's policy towards [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) along the [MISC Afghan  ] border , and also to stir up controversy regarding the [MISC Kerry-Lugar  ] bill that ties continued [LOC U.S.  ] aid to increased civilian control of the military . 
[PER Zerinini  ] also argued that the west had missed its opportunity to push the [MISC Pakistani  ] military to crush the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] taking refuge in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Citing [PER Jalaladin Haqqani  ] as an example , [PER Zerinini  ] said in 2004 he had standing as a leader in the jihadi community , but did not have the organization to represent a significant military threat . 
However , since then , large amounts of funding , predominately from [LOC Gulf  ] donors , have allowed [PER Haqqani  ] to create a network that would be difficult for the [MISC Pakistani  ] military to defeat , even if it had the will to do so. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Zerinini  ] said that bilateral measures alone to strengthen civilian government were unlikely to be effective , and that more coordination was needed among donors , especially the [LOC United States  ] . 
She said the Group of Friends of [LOC Democratic Pakistan  ] , while imperfect , was designed to transform [LOC Pakistan  ] 's political elite and give them more leverage over the military . 
However , [PER Zerinini  ] said it is not being utilized . 
She said the [LOC U.S.  ] was making significant efforts to help develop [LOC Pakistan  ] 's energy sector , but she added " I have not seen any of this in the energy working group of the Friends of [LOC Democratic Pakistan  ] . 
" THE [MISC FRENCH  ] LEFTIST OPPOSITION ----------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Staffdel members met opposition figures from the [MISC French  ] [ORG Parliament  ] and [ORG Senate  ] including Deputy [PER Pierre Moscovici  ] ( former Minister of [ORG European Affairs  ] ) , Senator [PER Jean-Pierre Chevenement  ] ( former Minister of Defense ) , Senator [PER Monique Cerisier  ] ben [PER Guiga  ] ( author of " Going Nuclear in the [LOC Middle East  ] " ) , and Deputy [PER Jean-Michel Boucheron  ] to learn their views on [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] . 
With respect to [LOC Iran  ] , the group generally thought President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's tone had been too harsh and they supported giving dialogue more time to bear fruit . 
[PER Moscovici  ] was the most alarmed at the prospect of [LOC Iran  ] acquiring nuclear weapons capability and he emphasized that he would not rule out any means in dealing with it . 
[PER Boucheron  ] and [PER Cerisier  ] ben [PER Guiga  ] accepted the prospect of a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] with equanimity because they felt [LOC Iran  ] was only seeking to enhance its power rather than seeking to use nuclear weapons for hostile purposes , while [PER Boucheron  ] was more concerned that the [LOC West  ] 's focus on this issue was preventing movement on a host of other issues where [LOC Iran  ] might be helpful , including [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Chevenement  ] said he was prepared to support sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] , but he argued that achieving progress towards peace between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] would be the most effective way of improving relations with the [MISC Iranian  ] regime. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The group generally agreed that the [ORG USG  ] was not moving fast enough on the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process . 
[PER Moscovici  ] thought President [PER Obama  ] could both be a friend to [LOC Israel  ] , as well as being firm when necessary . 
The opposition members said the [ORG USG  ] was not putting enough pressure on [LOC Israel  ] and that the temporary settlement freeze announced by the [ORG Nentanyahu  ] government is inadequate . 
The group 's expectations for what the [ORG Obama Administration  ] could accomplish in the [LOC Middle East  ] were high , and the perceived absence of concrete results could lead to disappointment on the [MISC French  ] left . 
[MISC FRENCH  ] ENERGY MAJOR [PER TOTAL  ] IN [LOC IRAN  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Total 's Vice President for [ORG International Relations Hubert  ] des [PER Longchamps  ] told staffdel members that the company 's current activities in [LOC Iran  ] are legal . 
Much in line with recent statements ( see reftel ) , [PER Longchamps  ] said [PER Total  ] 's focus is on recouping funds , in the form of cash payments , from previous investments in the development of [LOC Iran  ] 's oil and gas blocks . 
He added that [PER Total  ] has no operational responsibility in the [MISC South Pars  ] field , and talks to finalize buy-back arrangements to reimburse [PER Total  ] a " few hundred thousand dollars " should have ended in 2008 . 
In addition , [PER Total  ] provides limited technical services to the [MISC Iranians  ] to safeguard its remaining property interest . 
[PER Longchamps  ] said to walk away from these interests would only reward the [LOC Tehran  ] regime . 
He added that [PER Total  ] from " time to time " sells excess gasoline supplies to [LOC Iran  ] when demand drops in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Longchamps  ] did not quantify the value of this trade , but he said if such deals carried a high political risk , [PER Total  ] was willing to forego the business . 
He reiterated that there is no existing regulation prohibiting such sales , and if [PER Total  ] withdrew entirely from the refined petroleum product markets , the [MISC Indians  ] , [MISC Koreans  ] , and [MISC Chinese  ] would remain active players . 
18 ( C ) Like other energy companies , [PER Total  ] plans to return to [LOC Iran  ] in the future when the political situation improves , [PER Longchamps  ] explained . 
Therefore , [PER Total  ] offers financial support to local communities to develop social and medical projects . 
These programs help maintain a dialogue with the [MISC Iranian  ] society and is a channel of communication that [PER Total  ] wants to keep open . 
He pointed out that [PER Total  ] has not violated any [ORG U.N.  ] , [ORG EU  ] or [MISC French  ] laws . 
[PER Longchamps  ] cautioned the [LOC U.S.  ] against imposing sanctions in [LOC Iran  ] because they would hurt typical [MISC Iranians  ] without impacting the political leadership . 
When the [PER Total  ] Vice President asked the staffdel if pending [LOC U.S.  ] legislation could penalize energy companies for selling refined petroleum to [LOC Iran  ] , staffdel members responded the legislation could possibly impact [PER Total  ] 's recent shale-gas investments in the [LOC U.S.  ] THINK TANK: EFFECTIVENESS OF SANCTIONS -------------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] officials are divided over the effectiveness of sanctions as a response to [LOC Iran  ] 's continued pursuit of nuclear enrichment , according to [PER Bruno Tertrais  ] , senior researcher at the Foundation for [ORG Strategic Research  ] ( a think tank focusing on international security and defense issues whose main client is the [ORG GOF  ] ) . 
[PER Tertrais  ] told staffdel members that he believes sanctions can be efficient , but he noted the importance of defining the end goal . 
He stated the purpose of sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] is not to stop the nuclear program immediately but to exert pressure on the regime and to elicit a gradual change . 
He listed the successful use of sanctions in the past on four different countries -- [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and [LOC North Korea  ] -- the fact that sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] have put a strain on its imports , and the accelerated debate within [MISC Iranian  ] leadership as factors that back the argument that sanctions can be effective . 
He caveated his statements throughout the meeting by saying sanctions would be ineffective if nothing was done to address the black market and business circuits to [LOC Dubai  ] . 
Regarding the [ORG GOF  ] 's stance on sanctions , [PER Tertrais  ] noted that the Office of the Presidency ( [ORG Elysee  ] ) was more supportive of further sanctions and mindful of strategic issues than the [ORG MFA  ] , which tended to take a regional approach and be more dovish . 
Tetrais stated that the history of the late 1980s showed that the more pressure foreign governments placed on the [LOC Tehran  ] regime , the more the [MISC Iranians  ] backed down. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Embassy comment: [PER Staffdel Kessler  ] 's engagement with a broad audience on these issues helped advance our mutual understanding of the challenges and strategies to advance our common interests in [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and on the effectiveness of sanctions. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) [PER Staffdel Kessler  ] did not clear this cable .
