( U ) On June 5 , [MISC Icelandic  ] media reported that the [ORG GOI  ] and the Governments of the [LOC UK  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] had struck a deal over the [ORG Icesave  ] dispute . 
The [ORG GOI  ] has agreed to take a $5.44 billion loan from the [LOC UK  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] to repay the minimum deposit guarantee to those who lost their savings with the collapse of [ORG Landsbanki  ] and its online savings unit [ORG Icesave  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] will lend [LOC Iceland  ] GBP 2.35 billion ( $3.76 billion ) and the [LOC Netherlands  ] [ORG EUR  ] 1.2 billion ( $1.68 billion ) . 
The loan will have a grace period of seven years , during which the [MISC Icelandic  ] Treasury will not contribute to payments , and the total length of the loan is 15 years . 
The loan has an interest rate of 5.5 percent which will start accruing immediately . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] Depositors' and [ORG Investors' Guarantee Fund  ] will issue bonds for the entire loan amount . 
[ORG Landsbanki  ] will be responsible for the [ORG Fund  ] 's payments ( from their liquid assets and from future asset sales ) while the [MISC Icelandic  ] state will act as a guarantor. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Icelandic  ] negotiation team of six was headed by former government minister and current Ambassador to [LOC Denmark  ] , [PER Svavar Gestsson  ] , while the other five are representatives of the [ORG Ministries for Foreign Affairs  ] , Finance and [ORG Business Affairs  ] as well as the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
[PER Sesselja Sigurdardottir  ] , First Secretary in the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's [ORG European Office  ] , who sat in on the negotiations , confirmed to [LOC EmbOff  ] that the agreement had been signed and that the major details outlined in the [MISC Icelandic  ] media were correct . 
She stressed that the agreement is contingent upon the Parliament 's approval of the State being a guarantor for [ORG Landsbanki  ] 's payments. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite months of predictions that such a deal would be reached eventually , the media is reporting the signing of the agreement as an entirely new , shocking development and has estimated the debt to be at 3 million ISK ( $24,000 ) per person . 
The [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) leadership called the terms a " terrible agreement " and described it as " selling the people into slavery " . 
[PER Bjarni Benediktsson  ] , [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) [ORG Chair  ] said that he is not happy with the agreement , but realizes that the [ORG GOI  ] was in a very difficult position . 
A visibly relieved [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Ian Whiting  ] described to [LOC EmbOff  ] an amiable negotiation between the three sides , though he did note some concern over the public hammering the [ORG GOI  ] is now taking over the agreement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is unclear if the proposal will be supported at the [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament and two [MISC Left-Green  ] party ( [ORG LG  ] ) MPs have not yet stated if they will vote for it . 
For her part , [ORG LG  ] Deputy [ORG Chair  ] and Minister of Education , [PER Katrin Jakobsdottir  ] , lamented the opposition response to the proposed agreement , saying it was disappointing that politicians were arguing against a draft agreement that by their own admission they had not yet read . 
However , she admitted to being pleasantly surprised at the muted reaction from [ORG IP Chair Benediktsson  ] , terming it " almost a responsible statement , really . 
" On June 8 , four hundred people attended a protest against the agreement that was partly organized by the [ORG Citizens' Movement  ] ( [ORG CM  ] ) MPs in front of the parliament building at the same time as Finance Minister [PER Steingrimur J. Sigfusson  ] presented an oral report on the agreement . 
[ORG CM  ] MPs say they are not satisfied with the agreement -- some even questioning the principle of [LOC Iceland  ] 's acceptance of responsibility for the deposit guarantees -- and will try to call a referendum on the issue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The government is not out of the woods yet , but has succeeded in removing a major irritant in its relations with [ORG EU  ] member states as a whole and [LOC Britain  ] and [LOC Holland  ] in particular . 
This should smooth the way for a positive review at the [ORG IMF  ] later this summer , as well as for a happier reception of any forthcoming [ORG EU  ] membership application by [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
That said , the major challenge lies in convincing the public that no better deal could have been reached , and that simply refusing the pay was not a realistic option for a small island nation with [MISC European  ] ambitions . 
The lukewarm -- or even negative -- reaction from some of [PER FinMin Sigfusson  ] 's fellow party members shows just how much work lies ahead .
