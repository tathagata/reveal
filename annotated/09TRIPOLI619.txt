End Summary . 
[ORG CAT NEGOTIATIONS  ] COMPLICATED BY [ORG FIVE-YEAR-OLD LAW  ] 2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Minister-equivalent of Economy  ] , [PER Mohammed Ali  ] al-Hweij , told the Ambassador , Pol/Econ Chief , and FCS August 2 that an end was in sight for stalled [MISC CAT  ] negotiations ( Ref A ) . 
Backing down from prior demands that the local , quasi-governmental Economic and [ORG Social Development Fund  ] ( [ORG ESDF  ] ) take full ownership of a would-be [MISC CAT  ] distributorship in [LOC Tripoli  ] , al-Hweij reported that he had personally instructed the [ORG ESDF  ] to offer [MISC CAT  ] a 60-percent/40-percent split deal , with the [ORG ESDF  ] holding the controlling share . 
Qualifying his statement , al-Hweij noted that this would be the agreed-upon arrangement " at least for the first five years . 
" Al-Hweij emphasized that [MISC CAT  ] must comply with a 2004 law governing foreign distributors that the government had recently decided to enforce ( septel ) , whereby all such companies would have to work with [ORG Libyan-owned  ] and operated trade agents in order to sell their products within the country . 
Al-Hweij emphasized that this law would be applied to all foreign companies across the board in an attempt to regulate the market and prevent terrorist finance networks from exploiting the heretofore unregulated environment . 
3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Al-Hweij informed the Ambassador that the [ORG ESDF  ] had already sent [MISC CAT  ] 's Regional Director , [PER Andrew Sheridan  ] , the new proposal . 
[ [PER Note: Sheridan  ] later told FCS that he received the proposal by email only hours before the Ambassador 's meeting with al-Hweij . 
End Note . 
] Al-Hweij went out of his way to prove the veracity of his statement , personally calling the head of [ORG ESDF  ] , [PER Hamed Hoderi  ] , by phone in order for the Ambassador to hear firsthand that the proposal had been extended . 
The Ambassador pressed al-Hweij on the Ministry 's previous implicit threats to reimpose a ban on [MISC CAT  ] imports , stating that discriminatory market barriers would not be viewed favorably . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] reassured the Ambassador that a ban on [MISC CAT  ] imports would not be reimposed , stating that he hoped his Ministry and our Embassy would cooperate effectively to resolve any future issues in order to avoid such drastic measures . 
He designated his deputy for international cooperation , [PER Dia Hammouda  ] , as the point person for addressing bilateral , trade-related issues of concern . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] expressed an interest in meeting more often with the Ambassador to review the status of bilateral trade relations - an idea that the Ambassador welcomed . 
POSITIVE SIGNALS ON BILATERAL TRADE COOPERATION 4 . 
( C ) Al-Hweij was also positive on [ORG TIFA  ] , saying that the text was approved and only a date needed to be set . 
The Ambassador noted that we want the agreement signed before [ORG UNGA  ] and stated that setting a date for the signing was more important than the location . 
In response , the Minister promised to have the agreement finalized before [ORG UNGA  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Hweij  ] agreed in principle to support a [ORG Department of Commerce Executive Trade Mission  ] visit in November , requesting a formal program proposal via diplomatic channels . 
He also asked us to resubmit information on the [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] to improve the commercial legal environment for businesses . 
6 . 
( C ) Regarding visa support for [LOC U.S.  ] business travelers , al-Hweij requested additional information regarding the difficulties that [LOC U.S.  ] businesses face in attempting to obtain visas for travel to [LOC Libya  ] . 
Making sure not to tread outside of his boundaries , he also advised the Ambassador to raise the visa [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000619 002.2 OF 002 issue with the Prime Minister 's office . 
[ [PER Note: During  ] the Ambassador 's first meeting with al-Hweij in March , the latter pledged to help business travelers to secure visas - a pledge he has not been able to uphold . 
( Ref B ) End Note . 
] 7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The fact that the [MISC CAT  ] negotiation process was taking place at the same time that the Ministry was trying to impose a five-year-old law involving distributorships undoubtedly complicated the negotiations . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] 's apparent actions to press the [ORG ESDF  ] to compromise on the [MISC CAT  ] deal are positive and demonstrate that he has at least some authority to be able to make decisions within the business sector . 
His pledge not to reimpose the ban on [MISC CAT  ] equipment and to see that a compromise is achieved is also a positive signal . 
Al-Hweij seemed genuinely interested in improving the environment for foreign investment and in regulating local markets for goods and services . 
Post will follow-up on al-Hweij 's requests for additional information regarding an Executive Trade Mission visit and the [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] .
