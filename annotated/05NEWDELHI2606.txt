Blake  ] , Jr. for Reasons 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Summary: In a April 1 confidential briefing on [ORG GOI  ] detention centers in [LOC Kashmir  ] , [ORG ICRC  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX described to [MISC D/Polcouns  ] torture methods and relatively stable trend lines of prisoner abuses by [MISC Indian  ] security forces , based on data derived from 1491 interviews with detainees during 2002-2004 . 
The continued ill-treatment of detainees , despite longstanding [MISC ICRC-GOI  ] dialogue , have led the [ORG ICRC  ] to conclude that the New [LOC Delhi  ] condones torture . 
The [MISC MEA/MHA  ] recently protested [ORG ICRC  ] presence and activities in [LOC J&K  ] , and keeps the organization in legal limbo , but allows their operations to continue . 
Security forces in [LOC J&K  ] are open to [ORG ICRC  ] seminars in international humanitarian law ( [ORG IHL  ] ) . 
[ORG ICRC  ] stressed that it was not asking for [ORG USG  ] action , but may seek to mobilize support in the future , if its relations with the [ORG GOI  ] do not improve . 
Separately , the media reported that COAS LTG JJ Singh put human rights issues at the center of an April 4 conference of army commanders . 
End Summary . 
[ORG ICRC  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX gave us a confidential briefing on the [ORG ICRC  ] [LOC Kashmir  ] program , the first such detailed and organized presentation Embassy has received in a number of years . 
The [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have limited the information they have exchanged with us to general comments on the human rights situation in [LOC Kashmir  ] and the [ORG Northeast  ] “in order to respect their confidentiality agreement with the [ORG GOI  ] , ” with which relations have been strained . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] intimated that the reason he was departing from this practice was [ORG ICRC  ] annoyance with the [ORG GOI  ] , and his view that the [ORG USG  ] would be an ally in [ORG ICRC  ] attempts to regularize its status in [LOC India  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Holland  ] , and [LOC France  ] would receive the same briefing , he stated . 
Interaction ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [ORG ICRC  ] has been active in [LOC India  ] for 23 years , but signed its first and only [ORG MOU  ] in 1995 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
Since the last ministerial in 1998 , contacts have been at periodic Roundtables with the [ORG MEA  ] and [ORG MHA  ] , led on the [MISC Indian  ] side by a Joint Secretary ( A/S equivalent ) . 
The atmosphere at these meetings has usually been testy , with [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors singling out some [ORG ICRC  ] activities as “not part of the [ORG MOU  ] , ” and occasionally claiming that data presented are “not specific enough” ( even going to far as to call some of them “lies” ) . 
At recent Roundtables , [ORG ICRC  ] has provided thick books to the [ORG GOI  ] , which has over time raised fewer questions about the data and focused more on activities that were not carefully delineated in the [ORG MOU  ] . 
Between these meetings , [ORG ICRC  ] contact is kept to the Deputy Secretary level ( the second lowest in protocol terms ) . 
Thus far , [ORG ICRC  ] staff had not had problems with visas , he stated . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG MOU  ] was facilitated by the Embassy in the early 1990s and resulted from extensive interaction between the [ORG Mission Front Office  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
End Note ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a [ORG MEA  ] Note Verbale from January 30 stated that the [ORG GOI  ] values its relations with the [ORG ICRC  ] , and also its instruction in international humanitarian law ( [ORG IHL  ] ) to security forces . 
However , he said the [ORG MEA  ] also protested the [MISC ICRC’s  ] presence in [LOC Srinagar  ] , asking it to “wind up” its operations , advising that its “public activities must stop” ( believed to be a reference to a seminar [ORG ICRC  ] staff held at [ORG Kashmir University  ] on [ORG IHL  ] in 2004 ) , and warning against “unauthorized contacts with separatist elements” ( which [ORG ICRC  ] acknowledges have taken place , including with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) . 
( Comment: This [ORG GOI  ] request to “wind up” operations in [LOC Srinagar  ] seems more like a warning to keep to the letter of the [ORG MOU  ] than a real threat to close down there . 
End Comment ) Detention Center Visits ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG ICRC  ] staff made 177 visits to detention centers in [LOC J&K  ] and elsewhere ( primarily the [ORG Northeast  ] ) between 2002-2004 , meeting with 1491 detainees , 1296 of which were private interviews . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] considered this group a representative sample of detainees in [LOC Kashmir  ] , but stressed that they had not been allowed access to all detainees . 
In 852 cases , detainees reported what [ORG ICRC  ] refers to as “IT” ( ill-treatment ) : 171 persons were beaten , the remaining 681 subjected to one or more of six forms of torture: electricity ( 498 cases ) , suspension from ceiling ( 381 ) , “roller” ( a round metal object put on the thighs of sitting person , which prison personnel then sit on , crushing muscles -- 294 ) ; stretching ( legs split 180 degrees -- 181 ) , water ( various forms -- 234 ) , or sexual ( 302 ) . 
Numbers add up to more than 681 , as many detainees were subjected to more than one form of [LOC IT  ] . 
[ORG ICRC  ] stressed that all the branches of the security forces used these forms of [LOC IT  ] and torture . 
[ORG GOI Points  ] to Improvements -------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported that during recent [ORG ICRC  ] interactions with the [ORG GOI  ] , officials have maintained that the human rights situation in [LOC Kashmir  ] is “much better than it was in the 1990s , ” a view he also agreed with . 
Security forces no longer roused entire villages in the middle of the night and detained inhabitants indiscriminately , as they had as recently as the late 1990s . 
There is “more openness from medical doctors and the police , ” who have conceded that 95 percent of the information on particular cases is accurate . 
Ten years ago , there were some 300 detention centers ; now there are “a lot fewer , ” he stated . 
General Observations -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) While acknowledging these improvements , XXXXXXXXXXXXmade a number of additional observations based on [ORG ICRC  ] experience in [LOC Kashmir  ] that indicate persistent problems: -- There is a regular and widespread use of [LOC IT  ] and torture by the security forces during interrogation ; -- This always takes place in the presence of officers ; -- [ORG ICRC  ] has raised these issues with the [ORG GOI  ] for more than 10 years ; -- Because practice continues , [ORG ICRC  ] is forced to conclude that [ORG GOI  ] condones torture ; -- Dialogue on prison conditions is [LOC OK  ] , dialogue on treatment of detainees is not ; -- Security forces were rougher on detainees in the past ; -- Detainees were rarely militants ( they are routinely killed ) , but persons connected to or believed to have information about the insurgency ; -- [ORG ICRC  ] has never obtained access to the “Cargo Building , ” the most notorious detention center in [LOC Srinagar  ] ; and -- Current practices continue because “security forces need promotions , ” while for militants , “the insurgency has become a business.” [ORG Trend Lines Constant  ] -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] showed us two graphs depicting data obtained from interviews conducted during the past two years , with lines and bars tracing the various kinds of ill-treatment . 
All the lines were zig-zag in nature , but within bands and largely horizontal . 
There were no clear trend lines , up or down . 
The lines at the end of 2004 were in an order of magnitude roughly comparable to 2002 . 
He did not attribute the spikes up or down to particular policies in place at particular times , but called them “ad hoc changes.” Next Steps ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) The [ORG ICRC  ] official indicated that his organization would seek another Roundtable with the [ORG MEA  ] and [ORG MHA  ] between April and June . 
The [ORG ICRC  ] New [LOC Delhi  ] office also wants its President to visit [LOC India  ] , to raise these and other issues in a meeting with Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] considered this “very important , ” although stressed that it was not agreed . 
After 23 years of activities in country , the [ORG ICRC  ] also wants to regularize its status by concluding a formal agreement with the [ORG GOI  ] like that enjoyed by [ORG UN  ] agencies . 
Most importantly , [ORG ICRC  ] seeks a “purposive , rather than restrictive” interpretation of its existing [ORG MOU  ] and and end to IT and torture . 
Bright Spot ----------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the one bright spot in [ORG ICRC  ] activities was with the security forces . 
Staff have conducted more than 300 sessions with [ORG SF  ] on [ORG IHL  ] in [LOC Kashmir  ] and elsewhere , which have touched an estimated 20,000 junior grade officers in one way or another . 
Discussions are underway for further sessions with officers at the headquarters of the [ORG Southern Command  ] in [LOC Pune  ] ( [LOC Maharashtra  ] ) and [ORG Northern Command  ] in [LOC Udhampur  ] ( [LOC J&K  ] ) . 
[ORG COAS: Velvet Glove  ] , [MISC Iron Fist  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In a separate but related development , the media reported that COAS LTG JJ [PER Singh  ] made military discipline issues the centerpoint of a conference for army commanders April 5 , following reports that Defense Minister [PER Mukherjee  ] was disturbed by continued reports of human rights violations by the security forces . 
Addressing the conference , [PER Mukherkee  ] observed that “we must realize that while dealing with insurgents , we are operating within our own territory and allegations of human rights violations will not only sully the image of the army , but also reduce our effectiveness in tackling militancy.” As part of his “velvet glove , iron fist” approach , [PER Singh  ] has repeatedly stipulated that his officers should use “minimum force” and avoid “collateral damage” in their units in order to reverse declining standards in discipline . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) The fact that [ORG ICRC  ] reversed its practice of the last several years to provide this briefing to us reflects its frustration with the [ORG MEA  ] and [ORG MHA  ] , although we note that their experience with security forces in [LOC J&K  ] is clearly better than in the past , pragmatic and bordering on the positive . 
The data showing stable trend lines of ill-treatment and torture in detention centers are very disturbing , because the practice continues unabated . 
It does not appear that the [ORG GOI  ] is planning anything precipitous , but the [ORG ICRC  ] is clearly upping the ante with the [ORG GOI  ] , which it charges with “not playing ball.” [ORG ICRC  ] considers the status quo “unacceptable , ” and wants substantive dialogue with the [ORG GOI  ] . 
Their approach to us may be a prelude to a more assertive stance vis-a-vis New [LOC Delhi  ] , which could be helpful in goading the [ORG Home Ministry  ] and [ORG MOD  ] to taking firmer action , but also risks backfiring if the [ORG GOI  ] starts to back out of a long-negotiated working relationship which has produced valuable results over the past decade .
