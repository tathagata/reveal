[PER SANTIAGO  ] 332 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Officer [PER Jennifer Spande  ] for reason 1.4 ( b ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami  ] , a 35-year old Socialist parliamentarian and former filmmaker , has burst onto [LOC Chile  ] 's presidential scene in recent weeks . 
Known as one of the " unruly " parliamentarians from the ruling Concertacion coalition , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] is running against his party ( and the Concertacion 's ) official candidate: former president [PER Eduardo Frei  ] . 
For a populace eager for change from boring [MISC Chilean  ] politics , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] offers a fresh , young , charismatic face . 
However , his policy positions -- which few of his supporters seem to know about -- are wildly unpopular stances on controversial topics . 
While a poll released June 3 shows him neck and neck with [PER Eduardo Frei  ] ( with [PER Pinera  ] leading them both ) , analysts are reserving judgement until the more reliable [MISC Centro  ] de [ORG Estudios Publicos  ] poll is released in mid-June . 
More style than substance , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] is unlikely to emerge as a serious presidential contender , but effectively captures the zeitgeist of [MISC Chilean  ] frustration with politics as usual . 
End Summary . 
A Dashing Young Rulebreaker with a Compelling Story --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) A young and attractive filmmaker turned upstart politician , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] symbolizes the break with [LOC Chile  ] 's staid politics that many [MISC Chileans  ] crave . 
Just 35 years old , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] is the son of iconic leftist leader [PER Miguel Enriquez  ] , a founder of the violent [MISC Movimiento  ] [PER Izquierdista Revolucionario  ] ( [ORG MIR  ] ) . 
[PER Miguel Enriquez  ] was dramatically killed in 1974 when he refused to surrender to [MISC Chilean  ] intelligence ( [ORG DINA  ] ) agents , who were backed by hundreds of heavily armed soldiers , tanks , and helicopters . 
[PER Marco  ] 's mother , journalist [PER Manuela Gumucio  ] , remarried . 
Her new husband , [PER Carlos Ominami  ] , a Socialist leader , adopted [PER Marco  ] at a young age. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] worked first as a filmmaker , directing both television programs ( particularly reality shows ) and movies . 
His wife , [PER Karen Doggenweiler  ] , is a television presenter and actress ; they have a young daughter . 
[PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] made his way into politics on his father 's coattails , adding the hyphenated " -Ominami " to his name and running for the lower chamber in the same region that his father represents in the [ORG Senate  ] . 
Both Ominamis were elected in 2001 to represent the same area -- [PER Carlos Ominami  ] in his second term as senator , and [PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami  ] in his first term as deputy . 
Poll Numbers' [PER Meteoric Rise  ] --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] , who only announced his candidacy in April , quickly overtook better-known leftist and independent politicians to become the leading choice outside of frontrunners [PER Eduardo Frei  ] and [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] , who are each backed by one of [LOC Chile  ] 's two political coalitions . 
While initially starting out with support in the 1-3% range ( similar to that of other minor candidates representing small parties or splintering from their own coalition ) , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] has become a phenomenon in recent weeks . 
Several polls over the last few weeks have shown him with between 10-15% support , whereas a poll released on June 3 showed that [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] had as much support as official Concertacion candidate [PER Eduardo Frei  ] . 
When asked to independently name who they would vote for ( " open list " ) , 13% of survey respondents in the June 3 survey chose [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] , 15% chose [PER Frei  ] , and 31% chose opposition candidate [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] . 
When asked to choose among a set of presidential candidates ( " closed list " ) , the young parliamentarian received 26% support to [PER Frei  ] 's 22% and [PER Pinera  ] 's 35% . 
With Such a [LOC Great Image  ] , Who [MISC Cares About Substance  ] ? --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The former filmmaker seems to enjoy the limelight as much as he enjoyed life behind the camera . 
He and other Concertacion parliamentarians earned the nickname of " unruly ones " ( " discolos " ) for their frequent failure to toe the party line , not to mention periodic fist fights . 
Originally meant as a disparaging remark , the group embraced the term , the media attention it brought , and the identity of maverick politicians who challenged the Concertacion establishment . 
They have created their own website , taken polls second-guessing Concertacion leadership , and hosted forums for their own " discolo " Concertacion candidates for mayor. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The young parliamentarian and his attractive wife have been a media sensation since launching his campaign . 
At a June 3 lunch in honor of visiting [ORG Senate  ] Foreign Relations Staffer [PER Carl Meacham  ] , [MISC Chilean  ] pollster [PER Carlos Huneeus  ] suggested that a flattering April profile of the couple in the [MISC Chilean  ] daily [ORG La Tercera  ] had essentially created [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's candidacy . 
While other analysts felt that this was overstated , it is clear that [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] has suddenly been getting more than his fair share of media attention . 
A study released on June 3 found that in April only 6% of media coverage was about [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] . 
By May , however , the three candidates received roughly equal amounts of media attention , even though [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] had much less support ( 4-14% ) than the other candidates and was not considered a serious contender . 
Not only did [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] receive a lot of coverage , media reports about him were more likely to be favorable: 23% reports about [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] were judged to be favorable compared to 15% for [PER Pinera  ] and just 9% for [PER Frei  ] . 
( Note: 60-70% of media coverage for each candidate was deemed to be neutral . 
End Note . 
) Some have called him " the [MISC Chilean  ] [PER Obama  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] appeals to the large segment of [MISC Chileans  ] who are bored by politics and long for new faces ( Ref A ) . 
However , with President [PER Bachelet  ] enjoying the highest approval rating of any [MISC Chilean  ] president since the return to democracy , many of these citizens don't really want to see policies changed . 
When asked why they support [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] , 43% of respondents in the June 3 poll listed his youth , while other top answers were equally vague: " He has new ideas " , " He'll give opportunities to new people " , " I like him " , and " I believe in him . 
" In contrast , [PER Pinera  ] and [PER Frei  ] supporters offered a mix of responses that included experience , specific skills , proposed policy changes , and personal characteristics . 
Behind the Image , Controversial Positions ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) If [MISC Chileans  ] were to investigate the positions that the unruly socialist espouses , they would find them to be extremely unpopular: legalizing gay marriage , giving [LOC Bolivia  ] access to the sea , privatizing the state-owned copper company , and legalizing marijuana . 
While few supporters seem to have scratched under the surface of the [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] campaign , his positions have nonetheless had an impact on other candidates . 
This week both [PER Frei  ] and [PER Pinera  ] announced their support for civil unions for gay couples -- a remarkably progressive position in a conservative [MISC Catholic  ] country which only recently legalized divorce and does not allow abortion under any circumstances . 
What 's In It For Him ? --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) It is not clear why [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] decided to enter the presidential race , nor what -- if any -- end game strategy he has in mind . 
Given his youth and unconventional positions , it is hard to imagine him as a serious presidential contender . 
In a conversation with [PER Poloff  ] , [PER Christian Democrat  ] politician [PER Jorge Navarette  ] speculated that [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] may have decided to run for President because he was bored with his position in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] and wanted a " heroic " way to leave politics . 
Alternatively , [PER Navarette  ] suggested , he may have hoped to earn enough support to fulfill other political ambitions -- perhaps a spot on Concertacion 's senatorial slate. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At this point , [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] 's candidacy seems to have taken on a life of its own , with poll numbers generating media which generate still higher poll numbers . 
The unruly Socialist has announced that he is forming his own list of parliamentary candidates , but so far seems to have had little success in attracting many serious candidates . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Enriquez-Ominami  ] is the talk of the town . 
In this early period in the presidential race -- where more attention is focused on which parliamentary candidates are running in which districts , and campaign teams are still finalizing policy positions , it is hardly possible to have a discussion about presidential politics that does not center around this dark horse candidate . 
Yet it is not yet clear that the " [MISC Marco  ] phenomenon " will last . 
Concertacion frontrunner [PER Eduardo Frei  ] is a tired candidate who has put forward few new ideas . 
His poorly-managed campaign invites younger challengers . 
Radical party ( [ORG PRSD  ] ) leader [PER Jose Antonio Gomez  ] also rose impressively from obscurity to some measure of fame ( and poll popularity ) in February and March before disappearing from the public eye following his defeat in the April regional primary ( Ref B ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Astute observers are careful to note the myriad limitations of the polls conducted in the last few months -- from geographic areas not sampled to reliance on landlines ( which exclude poorer individuals ) to the inclusion of unregistered voters -- and are breathlessly awaiting the release of the [ORG Centro de Estudios Publicos  ] ( [ORG CEP  ] ) poll in mid-June . 
Far more rigorous than the others but conducted only twice a year , the [ORG CEP  ] poll is [LOC Chile  ] 's gold standard . 
The release of this year 's June [ORG CEP  ] poll will be like [LOC Chile  ] 's " Super Tuesday , " one analyst said , with political parties and candidates using the data to assess their chances of victory and deciding whether to remain in the race .
