<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 002452 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/RUS , FOR EEB/ESC/IEC GALLOGLY AND WRIGHT EUR/CARC , [ORG SCA  ] ( GALLAGHER , [ORG SUMAR  ] ) [ORG DOE  ] FOR [ORG FREDRIKSEN  ] , [ORG HEGBORG  ] , [ORG EKIMOFF E.O.  ] 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 08/18/2018 TAGS: <a href='/tag/EPET_0.html'>EPET</a> <a href='/tag/ENRG_0.html'>ENRG</a> <a href='/tag/ECON_0.html'>ECON</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/RS_0.html'>RS</a> 1 . 
( C ) A [LOC Moscow  ] court suspended [ORG TNK-BP  ] CEO [PER Bob Dudley  ] from his post on August 14 due to labor code violations in what [ORG BP  ] 's chief lawyer in [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Michael Drew  ] ( strictly protect ) , described to us as a sham proceeding . 
[PER Drew  ] maintained that the varied and sustained attacks on [PER Dudley  ] and [ORG BP  ] indicated [LOC Kremlin  ] complicity . 
Still , he expressed optimism that an agreement ending the dispute could be reached by year 's end to avoid permanent damage to the company . 
The case is the latest in the string of attacks against [ORG BP  ] 's interests in [ORG TNK-BP  ] -- attacks that will end only with an agreement between the shareholders , probably at GOR instigation , on the future of the company . 
End summary. ----------------------------- SHAM PROCESS , SHAM VIOLATIONS ----------------------------- 2 . 
( C ) [PER Drew  ] told us August 18 [ORG BP  ] had little illusion it would win the case , but that the court 's decision came quicker than expected . 
He said [PER Dudley  ] remains CEO , " with full powers , " until an appellate court rules on [ORG BP  ] 's appeal . 
He said an appeal usually takes 4 to 6 weeks , but he thought the court would rule , and against [ORG BP  ] , within 2 to 3 weeks . 
[PER Drew  ] 's pessimism stems from his belief that the entire proceeding has been a farce , with [ORG TNK-BP  ] shareholders [ORG AAR  ] feeding the labor inspectorate information on which to act . 
He said even his [MISC Russian  ] legal team is surprised and ashamed by the lack of any semblance of due process , including the court 's acceptance of clearly falsified documents and bogus testimony . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Drew  ] explained that this court decision is based on a finding by the labor authorities that six foreign employees of [ORG TNK-BP  ] had not been tested , as required , on their adherence to health , safety , and environmental regulations related to the use of computers . 
He said a CEO can be barred " automatically " for a repeat of a serious offense , or , as in this case , at the discretion of the labor inspectorate for findings of " gross violations , " which he described as high-level malfeasance . 
Obviously , [PER Drew  ] said , [PER Dudley  ] was guilty of neither . 
4 . 
( C ) Expounding on [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's other woes , [PER Drew  ] provided an update on the case ( ref C ) brought by minority shareholder Tetlis , a company linked to [ORG AAR  ] partner [PER Mikheil Fridman  ] 's [ORG Alfa Group  ] . 
An earlier [LOC Tyumen  ] court ruling in this case resulted in [ORG BP  ] pulling all secondees from [ORG TNK-BP  ] in July . 
[PER Drew  ] said [ORG BP  ] recently won an appeal in an [MISC Omsk  ] court that nullified the [LOC Tyumen  ] ruling , but that the same judge from the [LOC Tyumen  ] court , on the same day as the [MISC Omsk  ] ruling , issued a new injunction against continued employment of the secondees. ----------------- [LOC KREMLIN  ] SANCTION ? ----------------- 5 . 
( C ) Given the varied and sustained attacks against [ORG BP  ] 's interests in [ORG TNK-BP  ] , [PER Drew  ] believed that the [LOC Kremlin  ] must be complicit . 
" Either that , or [PER Mikheil Fridman  ] is running the country , " he said . 
( Note: [PER Dudley  ] himself told Ambassador [PER Burns  ] in April that [ORG Alfa Bank  ] co-owner [PER Peter Aven  ] once warned [PER Viktor Vekselberg  ] -- who was then uncertain whether he wished to participate in the attack on [ORG BP  ] -- that &we ( [ORG Alfa Bank  ] ) can do anything , anything we want in this country , 8 and that [PER Putin  ] had told confidants that he was not ready at that time to take on [PER Fridman  ] 's power . 
End Note . 
) [PER Drew  ] was frustrated that the courts , the prosecutors , the [ORG Federal Migration Service  ] , the labor inspectors , all appeared to have been bought by [ORG AAR  ] . 
Meanwhile , according to [PER Drew  ] , there is continued silence from the [LOC Kremlin  ] regarding [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's troubles . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Drew  ] also noted in support of this thesis that in the various cases against [PER Dudley  ] , the CEO had been served papers [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002452 002 OF 002 compelling him to appear at hearings with only a few hours notice , including in courts far from [LOC Moscow  ] , such as the [LOC Tyumen  ] court . 
Furthermore , [PER Dudley  ] had often found the papers " left on his kitchen table " upon his return to his apartment in the evening , presumably left by court or government officials who let themselves into [PER Dudley  ] 's residence. ---------------------- AGREEMENT BY YEAR END ? ---------------------- 7 . 
( C ) [PER Drew  ] said he believes the attacks against [ORG TNK-BP  ] will continue until [ORG BP  ] and [ORG AAR  ] ( and perhaps the GOR ) come to an agreement about the future of the company . 
[PER Drew  ] thinks such an agreement could be reached by the end of the year , if only because the company 's operations are being hampered by uncertainty and the departure of key foreign and [MISC Russian  ] staff ( ref A ) . 
In a separate conversation on August 15 , [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's chief of strategy and business development , [PER Kris Sliger  ] , lamented the " blunt instruments " used by [ORG AAR  ] , but suggested these types of attacks would continue until [ORG AAR  ] believes there is a " greater cost to their actions than the perceived benefit . 
" 8 . 
( C ) With regard to a new CEO , [PER Drew  ] said the shareholders agreement stipulates that [ORG BP  ] has the right to nominate a new CEO , but that [ORG AAR  ] would likely reject [ORG BP  ] 's choice , leaving the company without a CEO until an overall agreement is reached . 
He suggested things would get worse for the company in the interval as it would not be clear who would be " calling the shots . 
" He said one " disastrous " possibility would be [ORG AAR  ] partner [MISC German  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx attempting to direct the operations of the company himself. ------- COMMENT ------- 9 . 
( C ) The court 's decision was expected ( ref A ) . 
It does not significantly alter the prospects for the company or for resolution of the shareholder dispute , both of which remain shaky . 
We had expected and continue to expect that [PER Dudley  ] will not return to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
If [PER Drew  ] is right about a deal being struck before year-end , we would expect it to result from some intervention by the GOR -- intervention that so far has been lacking . 
While there are no signs of imminent GOR action , [PER Medvedev  ] insider [PER Igor Yurgens  ] recently told us with respect to [ORG TNK-BP  ] that there are a couple of " oligarchs whose wings need clipping . 
" End comment .
