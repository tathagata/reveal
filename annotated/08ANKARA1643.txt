( C ) SUMMARY . 
A very public and ugly battle has erupted between Prime Minister [PER Erdogan  ] and the [ORG Dogan Group  ] . 
The conflict dominated the news this week after [PER Erdogan  ] lashed out at business and media mogul [PER Aydin Dogan  ] for reporting on allegations in a [MISC German  ] court that the [MISC German-based  ] [PER Deniz Feneri Charity  ] laundered funds to individuals in [LOC Turkey  ] who are close to [PER Erdogan  ] and the ruling Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] ( [ORG AKP  ] ) . 
The charges focus public attention on widespread allegations about corruption in the [ORG AKP  ] , a key vulnerability for the party . 
Still , [PER Erdogan  ] seems indifferent to reporting on the scandal in other media outlets , and has turned his wrath solely on the [ORG Dogan Group  ] with competing charges about corruption linked to a zoning deal for the [ORG Istanbul Hilton  ] . 
[PER Erdogan  ] launched a milder campaign against the [ORG Dogan  ] group in Febuary for carrying “pornographic” photos of women on its front pages , but the latest attack is a significant escalation of tensions . 
[PER Erdogan  ] has not been this truculent since long before the [ORG AKP  ] court closure case ; ironically , the new scandal has fed speculation that a second closure case could result . 
END summary . 
It Only Took A Spark -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On September 1 the first court case against [PER Deniz Feneri  ] convened in the [ORG Frankfurt Regional Court  ] . 
By September 5 , [MISC German  ] Prosecutor [PER Kerstin Lotz  ] publicly stated that the [MISC Turkish  ] Government “tried to intervene in the case and wanted suspects released.” The next day , [ORG CHP  ] leader [PER Deniz Baykal  ] announced on [ORG NTV  ] , a non-Dogan media outlet , that “Mehmet [LOC Gurhan  ] , International Director at [LOC Kanal 7  ] , acknowledged he took money from the [MISC German  ] [PER Deniz Feneri  ] and passed it to PM [PER Erdogan.” Baykal  ] implied that he Prime Minister and his party were direct recipients of funds embezzled from the charity . 
[ORG Dogan  ] 's three flagship papers – [ORG Hurriyet  ] , [ORG Milliyet  ] , and [ORG Radikal  ] – quickly picked up the story the next day with screaming , front-page banner headlines. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) In response , [PER Erdogan  ] publicly charged [ORG Dogan  ] with corruption regarding a zoning application for new residences at the [ORG Istanbul Hilton  ] . 
[ORG Dogan  ] responded to the allegation by declaring: “The [MISC German  ] judiciary claimed that the Prime Minister was involved in this case . 
The main opposition party leader announced this on [ORG NTV  ] , but I am having difficulty understanding why I stand accused of reporting this in my papers.” In a second attack , the Prime Minister announced that [ORG Dogan  ] had not been granted permission by the [ORG Turkish Board of Television  ] and Radio ( [ORG RTUK  ] ) to use an additional TV terrestrial frequency that he had purchased . 
[ORG Dogan  ] denied [PER Erdogan  ] 's charges and accused the Prime Minister of trying to stifle any press criticism of himself . 
Tango with [LOC Turkey  ] 's [PER Rupert Murdoch  ] ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Dogan Media Holdings  ] owns several mainstream daily newspapers and three major television stations . 
Although relations between [PER Erdogan  ] and [ORG Dogan  ] have never been particularly warm , a detente of sorts has existed for most of the [PER Erdogan  ] administration . 
[ORG Dogan  ] media players were only moderately critical of the Government , and the Goverment did not put undue pressure on [ORG Dogan  ] 's other business interests . 
Long before the public barbs , a familiar behind-the-scenes tango was taking place . 
Because of the [MISC Turkish  ] media ownership structure , media owners use their press resources to curry favor with the Government on behalf of their own businesses . 
They also punish governments that , in their view , do not give them a sufficient cut of Government largesse . 
With control of 30-40 percent of the nation 's media , [ORG Dogan  ] is a major player in this game . 
Two years ago , the goverment fined [ORG Dogan  ] 's [ORG Petrol Offisi  ] $200 million for tax evasion . 
This appears to have been the spark that ignited the current tensions . 
[PER Erdogan Spokesman  ] on the [ORG Media: Feed the Beast  ] or Else [LOC Ankara  ] 00001643 002 of 002 ----------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) PM Spokesman [PER Akif Beki  ] contends , “It 's a media habit . 
They want something ; they don't get it , so they attack.” He defended [ORG RTUK  ] 's refusal to allow [ORG Dogan  ] to use his recently purchased terrestrial television channel by arguing that this station would have put [ORG Dogan  ] in control of more than 50 percent of the media . 
[PER Beki  ] also believes this fight will not last long. “Dogan is wrong , ” he argued , because he is “printing allegations being adjudicated in a [MISC German  ] court as ( if they are ) pure truth.” [ORG AKP  ] Vice Chairman [PER Nihat Ergun  ] made the same point to us in a September 11 meeting at the Parliament . 
( COMMENT: Although [PER Beki  ] contends that [PER Erdogan  ] 's criticism is justifed and that the Prime Minister has actually shown admirable restraint , there are suggestions of a deliberate political move against [ORG Dogan  ] . 
Several weeks ago , Minister of Trade [PER Simsek  ] told a group of investors in [LOC London  ] to sell their [ORG Dogan  ] stock because [ORG Dogan  ] “won't be around much longer.” END COMMENT ) Indeed , after [PER Erdogan  ] 's attacks began last week , [ORG Dogan  ] stock fell 8 percent . 
And although [ORG Dogan Holding  ] showed a profit last year , several media and business sources have indicated the lack of government tenders and contracts is beginning to hurt the massive conglomerate. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Last fall the editorial stance noticeably shifted at [ORG Dogan  ] 's flagship newspaper , [ORG Hurriyet  ] . 
The paper became more critical of the government. xxxxx described for us several factors which he said led to the shift . 
Among them was the [ORG Petrol Offisi  ] case , a decision by the Government not to issue a valuable [MISC Ceyhan  ] oil refinery tender to [ORG Dogan  ] , and a blistering speech [PER Erdogan  ] made to a closed [ORG AK Party  ] meeting where he called [ORG Dogan  ] a crooked businessman . 
The last item was taken personally by xxxxx because [ORG Dogan  ] has supported [PER Erdogan  ] in his press on certain issues in the past . 
Comment -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) This battle could be seen as just a very direct and personal fight between two titans . 
However , coming on the heels of other recent accusations of corruption in the [ORG AKP  ] , the [ORG Dogan  ] attacks may represent a broader shift in [LOC Government-media  ] relations . 
Such shifts have been seen with other governments in the past . 
In earlier cases , however , the media did not generally escalate attacks until a government appeared at the end of its life , like sharks smelling blood in the water . 
With [PER Erdogan  ] 's approval ratings still over 50 percent , it will be difficult to maintain such a criticism level absent hard evidence and actual convictions . 
Still , only six weeks after the conclusion of the [ORG AKP  ] closure case , it is striking that media coverage is predicting the [ORG AKP  ] could face closure again if these or additional corruption charges are substantiated .
