( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary: While  ] achieving some key concessions from [LOC Russia  ] on next steps in the [LOC Georgia  ] conflict , the Sarkozy-Medvedev agreement from September 8 still leaves open questions about the nature and size of [MISC Russian  ] troops , role of [ORG EU  ] observers , and the format of October security talks . 
After contentious talks lasting four hours , the two sides reached agreement on the timing of the withdrawal of [MISC Russian  ] forces from [LOC Georgia  ] , international observer mechanisms , and the convening of an international conference on security and refugees for October 15 in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
FM Lavrov called for [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] to participate in the security conference , and announced [MISC Russian  ] troops would remain in those areas . 
[PER Medvedev  ] made clear that [LOC Russia  ] would not reverse its recognition of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
[PER Medvedev  ] and especially [PER Putin  ] remain defiant toward the [LOC U.S.  ] , with Deputy Chief of General Staff General [PER Nogovitsyn  ] alleging [LOC U.S  ] . 
" complicity " in the armed conflict . 
Pundits claim the September 8 [ORG Sarkozy  ] visit a victory for [LOC Russia  ] , with the [ORG Sarkozy  ] follow-on agreement likely to produce the [LOC Cyprus  ] scenario the [MISC Russians  ] say they are comfortable with . 
End Summary ------------------ Tense negotiations ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In their meeting September 8 , Presidents [ORG Sarkozy  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] discussed their August 12 six-point ceasefire agreement and agreed upon additional points in three areas . 
-- Withdrawal of troops . 
Within seven days , [LOC Russia  ] will withdraw its troops from the observation posts between [LOC Poti  ] and [LOC Senaki  ] , while [LOC Russia  ] will within 10 days following the deployment of " international mechanisms " withdraw its peacekeepers from the zones adjacent to [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] to pre-war positions . 
The document also calls for the complete return of [MISC Georgian  ] armed forces to their bases by October 1 , 2008 . 
-- International observation mechanisms . 
Both the existing [ORG UN  ] and [ORG OSCE  ] observer missions will remain , while " at least 200 " [ORG EU  ] monitors will be deployed by October 1 , 2008 in the zones adjacent to [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] . 
-- International discussions . 
An international conference on [MISC Caucasus  ] security will begin on October 15 , 2008 in [LOC Geneva  ] , devoted principally to security , refugees and internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) . 
The [ORG GOR  ] considers that this conference fulfills the requirements of point six of the [MISC Medvedev-Sarkozy  ] plan of August 12 , 2008 , which calls for international discussions on security and stability arrangements. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG DCM  ] that the atmosphere during the negotiations was quite charged and at times became openly hostile . 
[ORG Sarkozy  ] at one point grabbed FM Lavrov by the lapels and called him a liar in very strong terms , reacting to Lavrov 's denial that [LOC Russia  ] had failed to comply with its previous withdrawal commitments.XXXXXXXXXX said that [ORG Sarkozy  ] had arrived with a " take it or leave it attitude , very [MISC American  ] in style and very confrontational , " and the [MISC Russians  ] Had responded icily . 
[PER Levitte  ] played a central role in negotiating the text with [PER Prikhodko  ] , who seemed to be under a lot of pressure and in fairly bad spirits. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the end , the [MISC French  ] believe they got the best agreement that could be hoped for . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said they attribute their success primarily to the [MISC Russians  ] being ready to reach such a deal -- and in fact anxious to have it as a way of withdrawing their forces . 
[ORG EU  ] unity and harmony between the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] also played a role ; [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed that the [MISC Russians  ] were clearly conscious that they were facing a united front . 
[ORG Sarkozy  ] reportedly warned [PER Medvedev  ] that [LOC Russia  ] 's standing as a " serious power " had been severely harmed and failure to meet the obligations [LOC Russia  ] is assuming under this agreement could do a great deal of further damage. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that the [MISC Russians  ] treated [ORG Barroso  ] harshly and condescendingly , and tried to exclude him from many of the sessions . 
The [MISC French  ] attributed this to the [MISC Russian  ] view that [ORG Barroso  ] is basically a glorified international civil servant " not worthy to be in the [ORG Czar  ] 's [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that [PER Putin  ] was nowhere to be seen during the visit . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002701 002 OF 004 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In their joint press conference after the meeting , [PER Medvedev  ] contrasted the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] roles , calling the [ORG EU  ] " our natural partner , our key partner , " and welcoming the [ORG EU  ] approach as " balanced , " while contrasting it to " exotic or extremist " positions calling for sanctions . 
He again accused the [LOC U.S.  ] of blessing [LOC Georgia  ] 's desire to use force in the conflict , whether by " direct order or silent approval , " and used this purported [LOC U.S.  ] behavior as a reason to call for a new world order . 
[PER Medvedev  ] made clear that [LOC Russia  ] would not reverse its recognition of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Sarkozy  ] in turn renewed the [ORG EU  ] 's rejection of [LOC Russia  ] 's recognition of [LOC South Ossetian  ] and [MISC Abkhazian  ] independence , and at times seemed amused when he thanked [PER Medvedev  ] for speaking as the " representative of the [MISC European  ] position " on [LOC Georgia  ] , and again later when he questioned [LOC Russia  ] 's right to " determine [LOC Georgia  ] 's borders . 
" ------------------ Ambiguities remain ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) By fixing a timeline for withdrawal , the agreement succeeds in rendering obsolete [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's August 14 clarifications to the August 12 points , to which the [ORG GOR  ] maintained it had never agreed . 
However , the September 8 agreement leaves open several points that are unclear or contentious . 
The number and nature of [MISC Russian  ] troops remaining in [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] is not specified . 
Late September 9 , [PER Medvedev  ] declared that [LOC Russia  ] would keep 7,600 troops in the two zones ; 3,800 in each area . 
The [ORG Sarkozy  ] agreement appears to accept [MISC Russian  ] conditionality that [ORG EU  ] observers be limited to the areas " adjacent " to the conflict zones . 
The nature of the international discussions leaves the precise format of the talks open , not clarifying if [LOC Russia  ] will participate as a mediator or as one of the conflict parties , whether and in what capacity [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] will participate , and what the precise goals of the talks are . 
Finally , while [ORG Sarkozy  ] gave [PER Medvedev  ] a non-use of force statement signed by [PER Saakashvili  ] , the document has no legally binding effect , and it is unclear whether there will be an effort to make it legally binding. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Following [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's departure , FM Lavrov used a press conference on September 9 to clarify that [MISC Russian  ] troops ( not peacekeepers ) would remain in [LOC South Ossetia  ] " for a long time , " ostensibly to protect the residents there from [MISC Georgian  ] aggression . 
On the [ORG EU  ] observers , he said their role would be to guarantee that [LOC Georgia  ] would not use force against [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] . 
On the international discussions , he demanded that [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] be given a seat at the table as full-fledged participants. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Ambassadors and [ORG Defense Attaches  ] were invited to a briefing by [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] spokesman General [PER Anatoliy Nogovitsyn  ] September 9 . 
Despite a standing-room only attendance [PER Nogovitsyn  ] disappointed the diplomatic corps by simply rehashing [MISC Russian  ] arguments used to justify [LOC Russia  ] 's actions in [LOC Georgia  ] , highlighting the history of the agreements authorizing [MISC Russian  ] peacekeeping forces and the chronology of events from August 6-10 . 
He noted that in response to a [MISC Georgian  ] request , the [LOC U.S.  ] had quickly helped withdraw [MISC Georgian  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] and transported them to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
By helping [LOC Georgia  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] had " set a precedent of complicity " in the armed conflict , he claimed . 
[PER Nogovitsyn  ] also showed alleged [MISC Georgian  ] plans of attack for [LOC Abkhazia  ] which [MISC Russian  ] forces had " recovered , " arguing that they showed that [LOC Georgia  ] had planned to occupy all of [LOC Abkhazia  ] , target hospitals and civilian infrastructure , prevent refugees from fleeing , etc . 
He claimed they showed an " explicit manifestation of genocide . 
" He said that as of September 9 , [LOC Russia  ] had 2452 peacekeepers in the conflict zone . 
He summarized the plan agreed by [ORG Sarkozy  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] September 8 , only noting that [LOC Russia  ] expected the [ORG EU  ] to send " at least 250 " observers. ---------------------------------- [LOC Russia  ] defiant ; Tandemocracy watch ---------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that the [ORG EU  ] observer mission , limited to [LOC Georgia  ] proper , was a diplomatic success for [LOC Russia  ] , even though the [ORG GOR  ] on the eve of the [MISC Sarkozy-Medvedev  ] meeting had categorically refused to allow [ORG EU  ] observers to participate in the post-crisis management . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] considered the [MISC Sarkozy-Medvedev  ] deal the most likely compromise , and the maximum that either side could expect . 
He called the agreement on [MISC Russian  ] troop withdrawal something [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002701 003 OF 004 that [LOC Moscow  ] needed , in order to escape continued international pressure for not honoring its commitments. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Well-connected editors tell us that the mood within the ruling circles remains defiant . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] both [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] separately told us September 8 that they had seen [PER Putin  ] " at his toughest . 
" [PER Putin  ] brushed aside the significance of any [MISC Western  ] backlash to [LOC Georgia:  ] on the [LOC Sochi  ] [MISC Olympics  ] , " let them cancel it: we'll build one stadium instead of two ; " on energy , " we'll sell [MISC Central Asian  ] gas to those who want it , including [LOC Asia  ] ; " on estrangement with [LOC Europe  ] , " don't worry , [MISC European  ] leaders tell me that everything will be normal . 
" If the [LOC West  ] did not want [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Russia  ] did not need the [LOC West  ] , [PER Putin  ] repeated . 
" They cannot intimidate us . 
" At the same time , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stressed that [PER Putin  ] did not advocate a preemptively punitive response and specifically demurred from pulling [MISC Russian  ] investments from [ORG Fannie Mae  ] and [ORG Freddie Mac  ] , arguing that the markets needed more , not less , predictability . 
[PER Putin  ] maintained that [LOC Russia  ] wanted to be like [LOC China  ] -- to " sit under the roots of the tree " and build its power quietly -- but that immediate global responsibilities forced it to act . 
" When [LOC Russia  ] is challenged , it must respond: we cannot just concede . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the leadership continued to brush aside the market 's punishment of [MISC Russian  ] policies , arguing that they believe the public line that [LOC America  ] 's downturn -- and not [LOC Georgia  ] -- has precipitated [LOC Russia  ] 's beating. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The public allegations made by [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] turned a blind eye to , or encouraged , [LOC Georgia  ] 's August 7 attack on [LOC Tskhinvali  ] continue to be reinforced in private . 
[PER Putin  ] told the editors that the [LOC U.S.  ] was engaged in cynical electoral politics and needed to create an " enemy " to combat , and received no push back in his description of a one-sided [LOC U.S.  ] policy aimed at shoring up the " puppet , " [PER Saakashvili  ] . 
There was also no argument with [PER Putin  ] 's assessment that the [MISC Georgian  ] leader was politically " dead , " likely insane , and irrelevant to [LOC Russia  ] 's decision to recognize [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] marveled at [PER Putin  ] 's posture , noting the Prime Minister was " convinced that right was on his side , " and authoritarian in tone . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , warned us that [MISC Russian  ] actions were animated by a wave of patriotism and anti-American sentiment . 
" Never have [MISC Russians  ] been so united behind [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] " a stance made easier , he noted , by the public revulsion towards [PER Saakashvili  ] , which he shared. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) In assessing the ruling tandem , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stressed that " [PER Putin  ] had proved himself " in the crisis ; while discounting the theory that the Prime Minister intended to return to the [LOC Kremlin  ] soon , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the war in [LOC Georgia  ] made it absolutely clear that [PER Putin  ] did not intend to leave [PER Medvedev  ] alone . 
While [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] downplayed the demise of [PER Medvedev  ] 's reform agenda , he agreed that it had been put to the side . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] struck a more pessimistic note , arguing that the war played to the strengths of the anti-war camp . 
[MISC Russians  ] looked at [LOC U.S.  ] statements and concluded that [LOC America  ] was uncomfortable with [MISC Russian  ] independence and hostile to [MISC Russian  ] strategic interests . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] argued that having " surrounded " [LOC Russia  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] should understand the backlash that it produced. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us on September 9 that the President had emerged stronger because of the [MISC Georgian  ] crisis . 
Whereas [PER Putin  ] appeared to take the lead during the fight , [PER Medvedev  ] showed his mettle by arranging the terms to stop the conflict . 
The decision to recognize the separatist regions was " unavoidable " after the leadership had decided to go beyond the borders of [LOC South Ossetia  ] ( a decision that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] linked to [PER Putin  ] 's personal enmity for [MISC Saakashvilli  ] ) and underscored that [LOC Moscow  ] could not backtrack on that decision . 
[PER Medvedev  ] was apparently comfortable with the state of affairs [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [PER Medvedev  ] looked " relaxed " during a private dinner at [LOC Sochi  ] on September 2 . 
For the time being , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] sawMedvedev as somewhat boxed in and forced to take a more aggressive , " emotional " public stance than his usual lawyerly approach to policy . 
In the current [MISC Russian  ] political environment , any effort at taking a " softer approach " would only make him appear weak. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The September 8 [MISC Sarkozy-Medvedev  ] document is a step [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002701 004 OF 004 forward in setting clear deadlines for [MISC Russian  ] troop withdrawal . 
However , the limits on the [ORG EU  ] observer mission , as well as questions about the October 15 security conference , and [PER Medvedev  ] 's insistence that [LOC Russia  ] will not reverse its decision on recognition , presage the likelihood of a new " [MISC Cyprus-like  ] " frozen conflict in the [LOC Caucasus  ] .
