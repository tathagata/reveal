The [MISC Swiss  ] are considering imposing visa restrictions on [PER Qadhafi  ] family members and/or raising the case in [ORG UN  ] or international judicial channels , but worry that these approaches could serve only to exacerbate tensions - particularly since the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens were taken into custody immediately following a [MISC Swiss  ] decision to block a [LOC Schengen  ] visa for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] confirmed that the [MISC Swiss  ] had no information regarding their two citizens' welfare or whereabouts , and asked for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in pressing this humanitarian issue . 
The Ambassador agreed to raise the issue with [MISC Libyan  ] Government officials , and urged the [MISC Swiss  ] government to think carefully before resorting to public measures which would embarrass the regime and cause it to become even more intransigent . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Swiss  ] State Secretary [PER Michael Ambuhl  ] , in [LOC Tripoli  ] for talks on the two detained [MISC Swiss  ] citizens , met the Ambassador October 19 to brief him on current state-of-play and seek [LOC U.S.  ] views on the way forward . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] was accompanied by [PER Marcel Stutz  ] , head of the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Middle East Division  ] ; [PER Elisabeth Meyerhans Sarasin  ] , Secretary General of the [ORG Federal Finance Department  ] ; and [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] , [MISC Swiss  ] Charge d'Affaires in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] thanked the Ambassador for the [ORG U.S. Government  ] 's active involvement in this issue , noting that he had met regularly with a variety of senior officials , and that the [MISC Swiss  ] Minister of Foreign Affairs had just discussed this issue with the Secretary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although [PER Ambuhl  ] had meetings October 18 with the head of the [MISC Libyan  ] normalization committee , [PER Khaled Kaim  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] A/S-equivalent for [ORG International Cooperation  ] ) , the two sides had not made any progress in resolving the diplomatic standoff . 
The 60-day normalization period called for in the August 20 agreement with [MISC Libyan  ] Prime Minister [PER al-Baghdadi Al-Mahmoudi  ] had expired , and the [MISC Swiss  ] still had no information on the two citizens' welfare and whereabouts or the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] 's preferred approach to resolving the problem . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] said the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] believes the two citizens were taken in custody in direct retribution for [LOC Switzerland  ] 's decision to veto a [LOC Schengen  ] visa for [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi . 
( We understand that the [MISC Swiss  ] had intervened to veto other [LOC Schengen  ] visas for regime figures with other [MISC European  ] nations but did not confirm that with [PER Ambuhl  ] . 
) The [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] insists that the two businessmen were taken into custody to protect them from a planned [MISC Swiss  ] military operation to free them , a claim [PER Ambuhl  ] dismissed as nonsense. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During his talks with [PER Kaim  ] , [PER Ambuhl  ] proposed a way forward . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] would drop all of their visa restrictions on [PER Qadhafi  ] family members and [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] officials , and establish a joint committee on cooperation in exchange for the [MISC Libyans  ] withdrawing all of their complaints against the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens and releasing them immediately . 
[PER Kaim  ] was noncommittal , but promised to give [PER Ambuhl  ] a response today , October 19 - a promise [PER Ambuhl  ] was not sure the [MISC Libyans  ] would keep . 
Khaim also pressed the [MISC Swiss  ] to provide information on who had been responsible for the September 4 leak of photos of the [MISC Swiss  ] policemen allegedly assaulted by [PER Hannibal  ] al-Qadhafi when he was taken into custody , a demand [PER Ambuhl  ] said the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] was unlikely to meet . 
Noting that this case touched directly on [PER Qadhafi  ] family equities , [PER Ambuhl  ] questioned whether [PER Kaim  ] or any [ORG MFA  ] official was empowered to resolve the standoff and noted that the [MISC Libyans  ] appeared to move the goalpost in every round of talks . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] was clearly frustrated by the impasse , telling us: " What I can offer , they don't want ; what they want , I can't offer . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In response to growing and intense domestic pressure , [PER Ambuhl  ] said the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] is considering a " more aggressive " approach to the problem , including visa restrictions " on a bigger circle within the government , " a [ORG UN  ] campaign to " name and shame " [MISC Libyan  ] officials responsible for the crisis , and/or international judicial measures . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] said the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] was concerned about the risks posed by escalation , particularly with respect to the two [MISC Swiss  ] citizens' safety . 
Nevertheless , the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] felt that it did not have any other leverage to push for a resolution of the crisis . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] emphasized that domestic politics were affecting the [MISC Swiss  ] approach ; calls were growing for the [MISC Swiss  ] President 's resignation following two " humiliating , " unsuccessful meetings with [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] on this issue . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000832 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador agreed to raise the issue with [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] officials , stating that he would urge the [MISC Libyans  ] to address the humanitarian angle and the impact of this standoff on [LOC Libya  ] 's broader international engagement goals . 
He suggested that the [MISC Swiss  ] also request [ORG ICRC  ] or some other neutral international organization access to the two [MISC Swiss  ] citizens to confirm their welfare and whereabouts , an idea the [MISC Swiss  ] said they had not yet considered . 
He urged the [MISC Swiss  ] to think carefully before resorting to public measures , noting that any incidents involving the [PER Qadhafi  ] family were highly sensitive for the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] and were not likely to be addressed in a transparent , rational manner. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador also urged the [MISC Swiss  ] to consider reaching out to other international and [MISC Libyan  ] players with influence with the [PER Qadhafi  ] family , in hopes of reaching a solution . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] said the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] had reached out repeatedly to [PER Qadhafi  ] cousin and confidante [PER Ahmed Qadhafadam  ] , to no avail , and in " May or June , " the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] had enlisted the help of [MISC Italian  ] Prime Minister [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] , also to no avail . 
The Ambassador suggested that former [MISC British  ] Prime Minister [PER Tony Blair  ] or [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Hosni Mubarek  ] might be effective interlocutors in this case given their apparent closeness to regime figures. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: While [PER Ambuhl  ] and his delegation appeared to understand the potential negative ramifications of upping the public pressure on [LOC Libya  ] to resolve the case , they also appeared to be at a loss for any alternative measures . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] was insistent that the [MISC Swiss  ] had been humiliated and had reached the end of their tether . 
We agree with [PER Ambuhl  ] 's assessment that [ORG MFA  ] officials will be unable to resolve the standoff on their own accord , as any solution will come from one man only - [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
Given this reality , [LOC Switzerland  ] 's best bet to resolve the conflict may be to pursue its case via other influential players . 
[PER Ambuhl  ] despaired of getting any coordinated help from other [MISC European  ] nations . 
The Ambassador is seeking meetings to discuss the case with appropriate [MISC Libyan  ] officials , and will urge the [MISC Libyans  ] to provide immediate consular access to address the [MISC Swiss  ] [ORG Government  ] 's legitimate humanitarian concerns . 
Coincidentally , the [MISC Canadian  ] Foreign Minister is also visiting [LOC Libya  ] to see if he can resolve the problems caused by perceived slights to [PER Qadhafi  ] and his traveling party during and after his visit to [LOC New York  ] . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] have taken actions against [ORG Petrocanada  ] here and reportedly severely restricted visa renewals for resident [MISC Canadians  ] .
