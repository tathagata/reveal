( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
Following their attendance at the Bilateral [MISC Consultative Mechanism Meeting  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] on October 16 ( Reftel B ) , [PER AUSTR  ] for [LOC Latin America  ] [PER Everett Eissenstat  ] , [PER AUSTR  ] for Industry [PER Meredith Broadbent  ] , and [ORG USTR Brazil  ] and [ORG Southern Cone  ] Director [PER Sue Cronin  ] visited [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
They met with the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] State [ORG Federation of Industries  ] ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) and the [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] ( [ORG Amcham  ] ) to discuss trade issues , and with private sector representatives in the copyright and pharmaceutical areas to discuss intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR  ] ) issues . 
[ORG FIESP  ] and [ORG Amcham  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to maintain [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation in the [MISC Generalized System of Preferences  ] ( [MISC GSP  ] ) program and discussed the outlook for the [LOC Doha Round  ] trade negotiations and ongoing bilateral regional trade negotiations in the [LOC Americas  ] . 
The [ORG USTR  ] officials were interviewed by prominent news , business and economic publications , and received balanced press coverage on [MISC GSP  ] issues in four articles the following day . 
End Summary . 
[MISC Amcham: Focus  ] on Improving the [ORG Business Climate  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG USTR  ] visitors had a productive exchange of information with members of [ORG Amcham  ] 's Executive Board , which has focused on improvement of [LOC Brazil  ] 's business environment as a priority . 
[ORG Amcham  ] is targeting six major areas: 1 ) regulatory framework and infrastructure ; ( 2 ) innovation and intellectual property protection ; ( 3 ) taxation ; ( 4 ) job creation ; ( 5 ) international negotiations ; and ( 6 ) education . 
[ORG Amcham  ] members repeatedly expressed the desire to maintain a good bilateral trade relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , concentrating on common trade interests and promoting " win/win " situations for both countries . 
Although complicated , cooperation on ethanol and the bilateral [MISC Commercial Dialogue  ] are two areas that have shown movement in the right direction . 
According to [ORG Amcham  ] , problems hindering movement in the bilateral economic relationship include: ( 1 ) the lack of a consistent [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign policy ( although according to Board Members , Finance Minister [PER Mantega  ] is providing positive direction ) ; ( 2 ) the perception that alignment with the [LOC U.S.  ] is unpopular with the [MISC Brazilian  ] public , especially given the unpopularity in [LOC Brazil  ] of the current [LOC U.S.  ] administration , [PER Lula  ] 's leftist background , and the priority he gives to promoting [MISC South-South  ] ties ; and , ( 3 ) concern that the sudden termination of the [MISC GSP  ] program will negatively impact mostly [LOC U.S.  ] companies based in [LOC Brazil  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] companies that are producing items that would not ordinarily be produced in the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Amcham  ] 's Concern Over Losing [MISC GSP Benefits  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Amcham  ] views itself as a facilitator in the bilateral relationship , for example hosting a lunch meeting during the June visit of Secretary of [LOC Commerce Gutierrez  ] . 
[ORG Amcham  ] voiced concern , however , over the possible non-renewal of [MISC GSP  ] for [LOC Brazil  ] and the negative impact such a decision would have on the present [LOC U.S.  ] - [LOC Brazil  ] relationship . 
[ORG Amcham  ] has recently advocated for the continuation of [MISC GSP  ] benefits for [LOC Brazil  ] and the reduction of [LOC U.S.  ] import tariffs on ethanol . 
In October , [ORG Amcham  ] headed a delegation to meet with members of the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] to support [MISC GSP  ] renewal and sent a second delegation November 13 - 15 , prior to [MISC GSP  ] expiration on December 31 , 2006. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Brazilians  ] appear to be shocked at the abruptness of a possible [MISC GSP  ] termination . 
A representative from 3M gave as an example the manufacture of ear plugs . 
[MISC GSP  ] benefits enable 3M to export them to the [LOC U.S.  ] from [LOC Brazil  ] at a competitive price ; however , removal of the benefits would create a ripple effect making the production and export of this product unprofitable . 
[ORG Eaton Truck Components  ] offered a similar example . 
The company produces gear boxes in a smaller volume than could be profitably produced in the [LOC U.S.  ] If [MISC GSP  ] benefits are discontinued , the company might in the future move production to [LOC China  ] 's cheaper labor market . 
The major issue expressed by [ORG Eaton  ] , however , was the suddenness of [MISC GSP  ] removal - if it were to happen - and the fear of the negative impact of such a decision on [MISC Brazil-U.S.  ] bilateral relations . 
A more palatable decision , in the company 's view , would be the gradual phasing out of the [MISC GSP  ] program. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response , [PER AUSTR Broadbent  ] explained in detail the original intent and purpose of the [MISC GSP  ] program and the current review process . 
She underscored that the entire program is under review , not just [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation . 
[ORG USTR  ] will make a recommendation , which will go to [ORG Congress  ] for approval . 
She noted the strong [MISC Brazilian  ] response in favor of continuing [MISC GSP  ] , with approximately 800 letters sent to [ORG USTR  ] . 
[PER AUSTR Eissenstat  ] followed with an overview of the [LOC U.S.  ] trade agenda in the hemisphere , discussing the current status of [ORG NAFTA  ] , the [LOC Chile  ] Free Trade Agreement ( [ORG FTA  ] ) , [LOC CAFTA-DR  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Panama  ] , [LOC Uruguay  ] , and [LOC Peru  ] . 
He then gave his impressions of the five hour meeting in [LOC Brasilia  ] the previous day with [PER Rodrigo Azevedo  ] , the Director of Monetary Policy , [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
[PER Sue Cronin  ] closed the conversation with a short discussion of [LOC Mercosul  ] , giving an explanation of the more comprehensive [LOC US  ] perspective on trade with this organization . 
[ORG FIESP: Econ/Pol Outlook  ] , [LOC Stalled Doha Round  ] , [MISC GSP  ] Worries <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During an afternoon lunch meeting at [ORG FIESP  ] , the [ORG USTR  ] visitors met with Deputy Director for International Affairs , [PER Carlos Cavalcanti  ] , former [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC US  ] ( and [ORG FIESP  ] advisor ) [PER Rubens Barbosa  ] , International Negotiations Coordinator [PER Diego Bonomo  ] , and staff members . 
[PER Cavalcanti  ] opened the meeting with his impressions of the economic and political outlook . 
He thinks that [PER Celso Amorim  ] will continue as the Foreign Minister , as he has unfinished business with the [LOC WTO Doha Round  ] . 
In matters of trade , he believes the likelihood of meaningful official dialogue between the GoB and the [ORG USG  ] is limited , given the official stance of the [PER Lula  ] government . 
The only alternative is for the private sector to facilitate business , concentrating on more exports and investments , in the hope that trade can be separated from foreign policy . 
Trade will have to continue to be conducted under the present regulations , as most changes contemplated would require amending the [MISC Constitution  ] , which would be very difficult under a second [PER Lula  ] administration . 
If there is no legislative movement on trade issues , then [ORG FIESP  ] is prepared and committed to move forward on its own. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One of [ORG FIESP  ] 's biggest concerns is what it feels is the misperception of [LOC Brazil  ] 's role in the [LOC Doha Round  ] , especially among members of the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] . 
[PER Cavalcanti  ] clearly felt this during his visit to [LOC Washington  ] in conjunction with the [MISC Amcham-led  ] delegation to discuss [MISC GSP  ] renewal . 
( Comment: In private conversations with various members of the delegation after their trip , most related that [LOC Brazil  ] 's role in the [LOC Doha Round  ] negotiations was consistently brought up as a major point of contention in considering [MISC GSP  ] renewal for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
One [ORG FIESP  ] participant related that several of the congressional offices approached did not have any substantive discussions with the delegation , but instead referred them to Senator [PER Grassley  ] 's office . 
A CIESP ( [LOC Sao Paulo State Industrial Center  ] ) representative said there was minimum reception at congressional offices and few meetings with actual [MISC Congressmen  ] , leaving a less than positive perception of the delegation 's treatment while in the [LOC U.S.  ] End Comment . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the discussion , [PER AUSTR Broadbent  ] stressed the need for [LOC Brazil  ] to differentiate itself from [LOC India  ] , especially with regard to non-agricultural market access ( [ORG NAMA  ] ) issues . 
[PER AUSTR Eissenstat  ] made similar comments concerning the [MISC Doha G-20  ] proposal , where both [LOC India  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] 's name appear on the proposal . 
In differentiating between [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC India  ] , he suggested that it would be advisable for [LOC Brazil  ] to bring a measurable offer to the table . 
[ORG FIESP  ] was concerned that if [MISC GSP  ] is not renewed , it would be seen as a " punishment " of [LOC Brazil  ] , resulting in an official GOB response that would only exacerbate the negative perception of the [LOC U.S.  ] This scenario , according to [PER Cavalcanti  ] , would be a " lose/lose " situation for both [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] All three [ORG USTR  ] officials stressed that the [MISC GSP  ] program was never conceived as a permanent program , but rather as a temporary program with a stated end date . 
Previous end dates received a similar review , and the program was renewed . 
The ongoing program renewal review is administrative , objective and transparent , and is not solely a review of [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation , but a review of the entire program . 
Thus , [LOC Brazil  ] can best serve its own interests by continuing to dialogue with [ORG Congress  ] and by offering viable , logical , and clearly understood arguments for [MISC GSP  ] renewal , all the while keeping in mind that the program is not permanent , and its goal is to stimulate the development of competitive companies that eventually do not rely on [MISC GSP  ] benefits . 
[ORG IPR: Movie Industry Satisfied  ] , but Book Publishers Frustrated <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [ORG USTR  ] officials also held meetings with representatives of the various copyright industry associations . 
[PER Steve Solot  ] , Senior Vice President for the [ORG Motion Picture Association  ] ( [ORG MPA  ] ) in the [MISC Latin American  ] region , is relatively happy with the GOB 's recent activities to combat piracy and IPR crime in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
At the [MISC MPA Annual Meeting  ] this year , the head of the [ORG Brazilian National Council  ] to [ORG Combat Piracy  ] and [ORG Intellectual Property Crimes  ] ( [ORG CNCP  ] ) will be honored with the [ORG Association  ] 's first annual anti-piracy award in recognition of the [ORG Council  ] 's recent efforts to fight piracy . 
[PER Dalton Morato  ] , Legal and Administrative Director for the [ORG Brazilian Association for Reproduction Rights  ] ( [ORG ABDR  ] ) , which represents 90% of the publishers in [LOC Brazil  ] , was very concerned with the actions of three major universities in [LOC Sao Paulo State  ] , which allow 100% reproduction of foreign textbooks at their copy centers on campus . 
These are the [ORG University of Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG USP  ] ) , the [PER Getulio Vargas Foundation  ] ( FGV - a major business school ) , and the [ORG Catholic University of Sao Paulo  ] ( [ORG PUC-SP  ] ) . 
This accounts for an annual loss to publishers of approximately USD 15 million . 
[ORG ABDR  ] has appealed to the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] , which has ignored the appeals , stating that they cannot do anything since the universities are private . 
The [ORG CNCP  ] has been unable to do anything either , as they have no control over university policies . 
There has been some action on enforcement against this practice at the state level ; however , police consider book-related crimes to be of lesser importance and of lower priority , and react accordingly . 
Pharmaceutical Industry: Problems with Patents and Piracy <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) The pharmaceutical industry was represented by [PER Gaetano Crupi  ] , President of [PER Eli Lilly  ] ; [PER Joao Sanchez  ] , [ORG Governmental Relations  ] Director for [ORG Merck Sharp & Dohme  ] ; [PER Walban Damasceno Souza  ] , Director of [ORG Governmental Relations  ] at [ORG Bristol Myers Squibb  ] ; and , [PER Ronaldo Pires  ] , IPR Specialist for [MISC Interfarma  ] . 
General discussion focused on the need for continued improvements with [LOC ANVISA  ] , the regulatory agency responsible for pharmaceutical patents . 
The patent system now protects the investment and investor , and new examiners were hired recently , but there is still a backlog . 
All agreed that private companies are not investing enough to combat piracy and that the piracy issue is a cultural one as well , as the predominant [MISC Brazilian  ] attitude does not yet consider piracy a crime and an economic drain on society . 
In the area of research , there are currently 43 biotech parks in [LOC Brazil  ] and 23 incubators of companies . 
With regard to [MISC AIDS  ] medications , the companies believe that [LOC Brazil  ] is using the compulsory licensing issue to advance its reputation , gain support from the developing world and play a leadership role . 
All agreed that compulsory licensing should not be government policy. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
