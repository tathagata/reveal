The Minister promised a more formal response but offered his personal assurances that travel documents would not be issued , and said monitoring of the last two returnees was constant and ongoing . 
Ambassador also raised the need for [MISC GoK  ] outreach to the Parliament to prioritize passage of pending legislation to criminalize terror financing ; [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] said politics was hindering progress on this issue and on many other important bills , including one to criminalize cyber crimes , but said his Ministry was committed to pursuing radical extremists and ensuring the safety of [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Kuwait  ] , with or without new laws . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Iran  ] on my mind ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The blunt and outspoken Minister of Interior , [PER Shaykh Jaber Al-Khaled Al Sabah  ] , told Ambassador and DCM February 16 that [LOC Iran  ] is his major concern . 
[LOC Iran  ] is intent upon exporting its revolution and [MISC Shi'ism  ] , has a gameplan , and will only be deterred from achieving its objectives - including a nuclear weapons capability - by force . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will not be able to avoid a military conflict with [LOC Iran  ] , if it is serious in its intention to prevent [LOC Tehran  ] from achieving a nuclear weapons capability . 
In [LOC Yemen  ] , the [MISC Houthis  ] have shown remarkable resilience - where is their power coming from ? 
[MISC Yemeni  ] extremists are making money from the drug trade , moving narcotics into [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The [MISC GoK  ] has been able to block some of the flow of these drugs from [MISC Saudi  ] into [LOC Kuwait  ] , but remains very concerned about this . 
[LOC Iran  ] is involved , clearly , as a producer of drugs and a facilitator of transit along the [MISC Afghanistan-Iran-Somalia-Yemen  ] pipeline . 
Now [LOC Iran  ] is trying to expand its influence in [LOC Egypt  ] , seeking to exploit poverty there and infiltrate the security services . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Mythology Resonates ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] said that the [MISC Sunni-Shi'a  ] balance in the region is at risk and chaos could ensue . 
[LOC Iran  ] is " calling the shots " in [LOC Iraq  ] , and has so convinced the region of its stories - that [PER Shi'a  ] and [LOC Iran  ] will " fight to the end " where others will not , that only the [PER Shi'a  ] and [LOC Iran  ] really stand up to [LOC Israel  ] - that now many [MISC Palestinians  ] want to convert to [MISC Shi'ism  ] . 
As a consequence , [LOC Iran  ] has become " the beating heart of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism . 
" The Minister apologized for speaking so frankly , but said he wanted to clearly convey what is of greatest concern to the [LOC GoK.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Note: The Interior Minister 's concern about [LOC Iran  ] may have been informed by a couple of recent incidents briefed February 17 to the [ORG US Navy  ] LNO at the [LOC Kuwait  ] [ORG Navy Base  ] ( see IIR septel for details ) . 
In one incident , on February 6 , [ORG IRGC Navy  ] speedboats harassed [MISC Kuwaiti  ] fishermen ; in a more serious incident on February 15 and again on February 16 , three [ORG IRGC Navy  ] speedboats approached a joint [MISC Kuwait/Saudi  ] oil terminal in international waters ( located in the [LOC Al-Hout  ] field off [PER Mina Az-Zour  ] ) , approached as close as fifty meters and lingered for forty-five minutes on the first occasion , but only fifteen minutes the second time ( perhaps [LOC KUWAIT  ] 00000142 002 OF 003 as a result of the presence of the [MISC Kuwaiti  ] patrol boat Istiqlal that was dispatched to the terminal to hold station after the first incident ) . 
End Note . 
Pressure Track and [LOC Yemen  ] Clarification --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador took issue with the Minister 's characterization of [LOC Iran  ] 's role in [LOC Iraq  ] and then moved to review [LOC U.S.  ] efforts along the " pressure track " with [LOC Iran  ] . 
In [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Iran  ] may no doubt try to exploit the situation with the [MISC Houthis  ] , but the causes of the conflict were largely internal and would require [MISC Yemeni  ] President [PER Saleh  ] to pursue a political and social effort as well as a military campaign - as was noted in the recent [LOC London  ] conference , many of [LOC Yemen  ] 's challenges are ones of governance . 
[PER Shaykh Jaber  ] agreed , characterizing [PER Saleh  ] as having " an [ORG NCO  ] 's mentality that you can win everything with money " when what is needed is less corruption and a more proactive security posture . 
The Minister noted that [MISC Kuwaiti  ] Salafists are sympathetic to the cause of the southern secessionists in [LOC Yemen  ] and are being watched by the [MISC GoK  ] ; he stated , however , that no [MISC Kuwaitis  ] are actively involved in the fighting . 
Ambassador noted that some in the [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence community believe that a considerable number of [MISC Kuwaitis  ] are involved with [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] , particularly in the [ORG AFPAK  ] theater ; [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] said [MISC Kuwaitis  ] tend more to be sympathizers than practitioners , but said they all were being watched closely . 
[ORG GTMO Assurances/Clarifications Needed  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador raised the issue of the remaining two [MISC Kuwaiti  ] [ORG GTMO  ] detainees , and sought the Minister 's confirmation that the commitments outlined in the latest draft diplomatic note on oversight of returnees - particularly with reference to constant monitoring and withholding of passports - were both legal and accurately reflected [MISC GoK  ] intent . 
Clarification of the pending assurances would likely be necessary given the greater seriousness of the cases against the remaining two . 
The Minister promised a more formal response later , and made clear that he could not interfere with the activities of the judiciary , but said he was sure the two most recent returnees did not have passports , and characterized their level of monitoring by the security service as " so close they can smell us and feel our breath on the back of their necks . 
" Need for Passage of AML law --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador - as she had earlier with the Foreign Minister ( reftel ) - noted that [LOC Kuwait  ] is now the only country on the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] not to have criminalized terror financing . 
A pending law is before parliament , but Speaker [PER Jassem Al-Khorafi  ] had commented privately to the Ambassador that the government had not made its passage a priority for the current legislative session . 
[PER Shaykh Jaber  ] responded that politics was getting in the way of much needed legislation , not just TF , but also a bill to define cyber crime . 
The Minister offered his assurances that the [MISC GoK  ] is very serious on the matter of terror financing and facilitation , with or without the law , and was committed to this and to protecting [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Kuwait  ] . 
At the close of the meeting , the Ambassador provided [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] with drop copies of two previous requests for information on alleged anti-American plotters in [LOC Kuwait  ] , acknowledging that these could be " poison pen " cases , but requesting a formal response from the Ministry to ensure appropriate due diligence had been done . 
Comment -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament late last Fall , but the [MISC GoK  ] expended only enough effort to ensure his victory by a relatively narrow margin . 
The reported cost of that governmental support ( arranged by a Prime Minister from whom [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] is estranged ) was [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] 's acceptance that KSS Chief 'Athbi Al-Fahad [PER Al Sabah  ] would report directly to the PM , not to the Interior Minister as has traditionally been the case . 
The Interior Minister 's tough and candid talk on [LOC Iran  ] , consequently , while it offers useful insight into the private worries likely shared by many of [LOC Kuwait  ] 's seniormost leadership , should not necessarily be seen as an articulation likely to result in any meaningful [MISC GoK  ] policy initiatives .
