[PER Charette  ] applauded the positive results of [LOC U.S.  ] policies across the [LOC Middle East  ] -- on [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] -- and even assigned blame for the “embarrassing” downturn in relations over [LOC Iraq  ] to President [PER Chirac  ] .

Charette’s gesture , unprecedented in our memory , reportedly came at the behest of [ORG UMP  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
The views he expressed are , just as clearly , those of the politician currently best placed to end Chirac’s tenure as President . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Former Foreign Minister [PER Herve de Charette  ] called on Ambassador [PER Leach  ] March 1 in his capacity as head of international relations of the governing [ORG UMP  ] party . 
( Note: [ORG UMP  ] President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] recently named [PER Charette  ] to this position . 
De [PER Charette  ] is also vice-president of the [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] of the [ORG National Assembly  ] . 
He served as Foreign Minister from 1995 to 1997 under Prime Minister [PER Alain Juppe  ] . 
) [PER Charette  ] , referring to recent events in the [LOC Middle East  ] -- [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] -- observed that [LOC U.S.  ] policies have prospered . 
The [ORG UMP  ] applauds these positive results . 
He and the [ORG UMP  ] also agree with the [ORG USG  ] thesis that “the [LOC Middle East  ] is immobile politically because it is immobile economically.” He cited Secretary Rice’s view -- which he shares -- that it is necessary to work with the world as it is , but we need not accept that it must remain as it is . 
( This is a view , he added , that comes more naturally to a great power ; smaller countries generally must accept the hand they have been dealt . 
) [PER Charette  ] said that this commonality of views had led the [ORG UMP  ] to the conclusion that it should “organize a useful relationship with the [PER U.S.” Charette  ] spoke specifically of reaching out to [LOC U.S.  ] political parties -- to its natural partner the [ORG Republican Party  ] , but also to the [MISC Democrats  ] . 
In addition to contacts with parties , the [ORG UMP  ] would be interested in meeting official visitors to [LOC Paris  ] , as deemed appropriate by the Ambassador. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Commenting further on the current scene , [PER Charette  ] posited that “the relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] is the basis of [MISC French  ] foreign relations.” The last two or three years have been “embarrassing.” [PER Charette  ] pointed the finger of blame in one direction: “The President of the [LOC Republic  ] went down a route that didn’t make things any easier.” ( Note: In February 2003 , [PER Charette  ] was one of only a handful of [MISC French  ] parliamentarians to warn against a [MISC French  ] veto of a new [ORG UNSC  ] resolution . 
) The [ORG UMP  ] welcomes the positive turn of recent weeks , said [PER Charette  ] . 
He put particular stress on recent progress on [MISC Palestinian-Israeli  ] relations , returning several times to a refrain , commonly heard here , that this is the key issue for [MISC European-U.S.  ] relations . 
[LOC France  ] , he said , needs to adjust its approach so that it does not always “fall on the same ( i.e . 
[MISC Palestinian  ] ) side of the road.” The [LOC U.S.  ] , which tends to fall on the other side , has been right to reproach the [MISC Palestinians  ] for never being able to control their terrorist movements . 
The second intifada was disastrous -- for the [MISC Palestinians  ] , for the peace camp in [LOC Israel  ] , and because it encouraged the establishment of more settlements . 
The new [MISC Palestinian  ] leadership will not be able to escape the need to settle matters with the terrorists . 
The [MISC Israelis  ] , for their part , cannot hope to keep 250,000 of their own in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories . 
The situation is extremely complex , said [PER Charette  ] , requiring all the energy of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
He said he remains extremely anxious about the situation , and skeptical . 
It is not at all clear that the conditions for peace are at hand -- bearing in mind the downward spiral that occurred after promising beginnings in the 1990s. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Leach  ] took the opportunity to ask [PER Charette  ] his views regarding [LOC Turkey  ] and the [ORG EU  ] , given his chairmanship of the [ORG Franco-Turkish Friendship Group  ] in the [ORG National Assembly  ] . 
[PER Charette  ] said that the [MISC French  ] people have a “deep and strong conviction against [MISC Turkish  ] entry . 
It is a feeling that will not disappear over time.” ( Note: This view , in contrast to that of President [PER Chirac  ] , reflects the opposition of [ORG UMP  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] and the majority of the [ORG UMP  ] membership .
