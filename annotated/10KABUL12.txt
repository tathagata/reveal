( C ) SUMMARY: Since [LOC Kunduz  ] authorities helped stand up pro-GIRoA militia forces in early Fall 2009 , the forces have evolved in very different directions . 
In [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] district , a well-disciplined force has brought about a marked improvement in security , while the picture in the [MISC Aqtash  ] areas of [LOC Khanabad  ] district is much less positive because the [ORG GIRoA  ] clearly lacks adequate control over the fighters . 
End Summary . 
BAKCGROUND <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In June 2009 , [LOC Kunduz  ] Governor [PER Mohammad Omar  ] announced the creation of an [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Public Protection Force  ] ( [ORG APPF  ] ) in [LOC Kunduz  ] province , for which 150 to 200 men were to be recruited in each district to complement regular [ORG ANP  ] . 
In July , Gov. [PER Omar  ] and provincial security officials conducted shuras throughout the province , in which elders and former mujahedeen commanders were asked to identify suitable recruits for the force . 
[PER Omar  ] subsequently learned , however , that [ORG APPF  ] would not be expanded to [LOC Kunduz  ] province and increasingly frustrated with a shortage of [ORG ANSF  ] , especially [ORG ANP  ] , [LOC Kunduz  ] authorities moved to stand up militia forces which would work with the [ORG ANSF  ] to combat the growing insurgency . 
Funding for the initiative was obtained primarily through the [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) . 
QAL-E-ZAL: A MODEL FOR COMMUNITY- BASED SECURITY <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the northwestern district of [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] , militia forces under the command of [PER Nabi Gichi  ] have been the most organized and disciplined of the various militia groups operating in [LOC Kunduz  ] province . 
A large part of the credit for this must go to District Manager [PER Mohammad Nazir  ] , who was involved from the beginning in the standing up of a pro-GIRoA militia and recruiting for its leader , the [MISC Turkmen  ] former mujahedeen commander [PER Nabi Gichi  ] from [LOC Mazar-e-Sharif  ] . 
The commanders received some weapons as well as funding from the [ORG NDS  ] to supplement to supplement their own weapons , and community elders agreed to provide some food for the militia members . 
The commanders submitted to [ORG Nabi  ] as the overall commander in the district , and they promised not to collect taxes from or harass the population . 
According to [PER Nazir  ] , each sub-commander of [ORG Nabi  ] is responsible for a certain area , and those forces are not permitted to operate outside of the area . 
In the event of a security incident or allegations of misconduct by militia members , [PER Nazir  ] told us , he holds the sub-commander of the area personally responsible. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Nabi  ] 's forces proved themselves in fighting insurgents in September , at a time when insurgents appeared close to taking over much of [LOC Kunduz  ] province . 
Together with [ORG ANSF  ] , his forces successfully fended off an insurgent attack on a border police post in [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] , along the border with [LOC Tajikistan  ] , and have successfully driven insurgents from much of [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] district . 
During a visit by [LOC PRT Kunduz  ] in November to the district to assess the situation and explore opportunities for quick-impact projects , [ORG Nabi  ] 's forces were present , yet both the commander himself and his forces ( identifiable by their wearing of a yellow armband ) remained discreetly in the background and visibly deferential to the District Manager . 
The local population expressed strong appreciation for the improvement in security [ORG Nabi  ] 's forces have brought . 
KHANABAD: [ORG GIROA  ] HAS LITTLE CONTROL <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In [LOC Khanabad  ] district in eastern [LOC Kunduz  ] province , particularly in the [LOC Aqtash  ] area , militias have also been active , but the picture is altogether different from that in [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] . 
While in [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] a commander was recruited from outside the area , the move to support militias in [LOC Khanabad  ] district has significantly increased the influence of local power brokers from the area . 
The most powerful of the militia leaders in [LOC Khanabad  ] are [PER Mohammad Omar  ] ( unrelated to the [LOC Kunduz  ] Governor of the same name ) , an ethnic [PER Pashtun  ] ; and [PER Mir Alam Khan  ] , a [MISC Tajik  ] commander and the most powerful power broker in the province . 
[PER Mir Alam  ] is also the brother-in-law of [LOC Kunduz  ] [ORG NDS  ] Chief Gen. [PER Mohammad Daoud  ] . 
While the full extent of the cooperation between [ORG NDS  ] and [PER Mir Alam  ] is not clear , it is likely that [PER Mir Alam  ] 's relationship to Gen. [PER Daoud  ] has given him a privileged position in receiving [ORG NDS  ] support. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The most problematic aspect of developments in [LOC Khanabad  ] district is the lack of adequate [ORG GIRoA  ] control over the forces operating in the area , an issue over which both [LOC KABUL  ] 00000012 002 OF 002 District Manager [PER Nezamuddin Nasher  ] and [LOC Kunduz  ] Deputy [ORG NDS  ] Chief [PER Karim Atrafi  ] have repeatedly expressed concern . 
In [PER Atrafi  ] 's assessment , unlike in [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] , the situation in [LOC Aqtash  ] has become quite confused , and neither [ORG NDS  ] nor other [ORG GIRoA  ] authorities have much control over the situation . 
According to [PER Atrafi  ] , the fighters active in [LOC Aqtash  ] do not have a clear chain of command , and these militia forces are also fighting among themselves and settling old scores . 
[PER Atrafi  ] also noted that some groupings were cooperating with both insurgents and [ORG GIRoA  ] , changing their behavior opportunistically depending on their own interests. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Already , there are indications that the situation in [LOC Aqtash  ] , which militia forces cleared just before the election , is quite fragile , and reports from the area suggest there is significant resentment among the local population toward the militias' practices of collecting taxes . 
Further complicating the picture is the complex ethnic makeup of [LOC Khanabad  ] district . 
Unlike in [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] , where the population is overwhelmingly [MISC Turkmen  ] , [LOC Khanabad  ] district , like the province as a whole , comprises a plurality of [PER Pashtuns  ] as well as smaller numbers of [PER Tajiks  ] , [PER Hazaras  ] , and [MISC Uzbeks  ] . 
As the militias loyal to [PER Mir Alam  ] are mostly [PER Tajiks  ] , there exists a real risk that conflict between the population and militias or among the militias themselves will take on an ethnic dimension , in which the militias are perceived by [PER Pashtuns  ] as not anti-Taliban but anti-Pashtun. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The very different development in [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] and in [LOC Khanabad  ] highlight the significant benefits and risks associated with such informal security mechanisms . 
In [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] , the militias have undoubtedly been a stabilizing force . 
The involvement of the District Manager from the start , the inclusion of the community into the process , their benign behavior toward the population ( not collecting taxes ) , and the ( comparatively ) clear chain of command have all helped to make the force in [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] a success . 
The picture in [LOC Khanabad  ] is much less clear , and it remains to be seen whether the security gains that have been made there will be durable , or if they came at the price of increasing ethnic tensions in the long-term . 
Furthermore , as [MISC Afghan  ] officials increasingly see a need to bring the militia forces into an official framework , these different characteristics among militia groups will have significant implications for any possible future integration of the forces into [ORG ANSF  ] . 
Post will engage with [ORG GIRoA  ] authorities on the potential for that integration and will continue to monitor the development of these informal security mechanisms .
