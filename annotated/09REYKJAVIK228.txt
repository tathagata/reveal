( U ) After months of debate , [LOC Iceland  ] 's parliament passed the [ORG Icesave  ] bill late in the evening of December 30 by a vote of 33 to <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
Passage of the bill allows the government to provide a state guarantee for the [ORG Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund  ] 's repayment of up to $5.5 billion to the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments for loans covering losses by their depositors as a result of the October 2008 [MISC Icelandic  ] banking collapse . 
The opposition voted uniformly against the bill while most members of the coalition government supported the measure . 
Only two members of the coalition , [PER Lilja Mosesdottir  ] and [PER Ogmundur Jonasson  ] , broke ranks and voted against the bill . 
The one independent in the parliament , [PER Thrainn Bertelsson  ] , voted in favor of the [ORG Icesave  ] bill . 
The president now has two weeks to sign the bill into law. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Steingrimur [PER J. Sigfusson  ] , the leader of the [ORG Left Green Party  ] , hailed the vote as an important step in [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery . 
" It is my firm belief and conviction , " he said , " that the new year will bring economic recovery . 
" The opposition , on the other hand , feels that this decision will saddle the [MISC Icelandic  ] people with crippling debts for generations to come . 
The leader of the [ORG Independence Party  ] , [PER Bjarni Benediktsson  ] , said that " by passing this bill , the [MISC Icelandic  ] government ( the coalition government of the [MISC Social Democrats  ] and the [ORG Left Greens  ] ) wants to make the debts of private banks the debts of the [MISC Icelandic  ] public without taking the issue to court . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) This is the second time that [LOC Iceland  ] 's parliament has voted on the [ORG Icesave  ] agreement this year . 
In its first iteration , which passed in August , parliament added significant amendments to the original agreement signed with the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] governments in March . 
Those two governments found the amended version of the agreement to be unsatisfactory . 
Renegotiations forged a new agreement that the [MISC Icelandic  ] Parliament officially accepted in the December 30 vote. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The opposition tried to amend this bill to require a general referendum to be held on the issue within six weeks . 
The proposed amendment was struck down by the same 33-30 margin of the bill . 
The President , [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] , has two weeks to sign the bill into law and has stated that he intends to examine the matter closely before making a final decision . 
He said that he cannot ignore the large percentage of [MISC Icelandic  ] voters ( more than 45,000 ) who signed a petition asking him not to sign the bill in order to force the matter to go to a national referendum . 
President [PER Grimsson  ] plans to honor his promise to the leaders of the group that organized the petition , InDefence , and meet with them before making a final decision. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Assuming the President signs the [ORG Icesave  ] bill into law , it will be a significant step for [LOC Iceland  ] because it opens the door for economic recovery and allows economic policymakers to look forward rather than backward . 
This step ensures that the [ORG IMF  ] program and [MISC Nordic  ] loans will continue and allows the government to direct its limited resources towards other pressing matters . 
The decision is largely unpopular with the general public and even those Icelanders who supported the agreement felt the nation had been backed into a corner . 
The matter sparked unrest and , at least on one occasion several months ago , threatened to topple the government . 
At this point , the coalition seems adequately cohesive to continue . 
Although the issue has been resolved in parliament , the wounds created by the [ORG Icesave  ] controversy will likely heal slowly and affect the country for years to come . 
End comment .
