END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. -------------------------------- THE K-STYLE IN DOMESTIC POLITICS -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] 's personalistic , often erratic operating and decision-making style defines current [MISC Argentine  ] policymaking and is characterized by an overarching focus on the short-term and politically expedient accumulation and maintenance of domestic political power . 
Close [PER Kirchner  ] insiders have described [PER Kirchner  ] 's decision-making process to Emboffs as one in which [PER Kirchner  ] consults with a small number of trusted advisors , generally one-on-one , and then makes all of the final decisions himself . 
The [MISC Argentine  ] political system places a great deal of authority into the hands of the President , and President [PER Kirchner  ] is a strong president even in the [MISC Argentine  ] historical context . 
As a result , the " [MISC K-Style  ] " defines the [ORG GOA  ] policymaking process and gives the policy process a short-term focus . 
As Legal and Technical Secretary [PER Carlos Zannini  ] , a close [PER Kirchner  ] advisor , told the [ORG DCM  ] , " The President and I get up every morning , look at the morning papers , and try to figure out how to survive the day . 
" Another long-time [PER Kirchner  ] associate , former [PER Santa Cruz Governor  ] [PER Sergio Acevedo  ] told us that [PER Kirchner  ] focuses very much on day-to-day issues , but always with the long-term strategic goal of retaining political power . 
( COMMENT: [PER Kirchner  ] 's focus on retaining political power leads us to discount speculation that [PER Kirchner  ] will step aside in 2007 and make his wife [PER Cristina  ] the presidential candidate . 
For 2011 , assuming [PER Kirchner  ] 's health holds , we would expect him to either modify the Constitution to allow him to run for a third term , or to pass the mantel on to his wife . 
END COMMENT . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] 's domestic political style leaves no room for dissent and utilizes divide-and-conquer tactics to weaken [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001462 002 OF 005 the political opposition . 
[PER Kirchner  ] is quick to silence any opposition to his policies from within his movement , as when he recently expelled congresswoman [PER Maria del Carmen Alarcon  ] from the presidency of the [ORG Lower House Agricultural Committee  ] and from [PER Kirchner  ] 's [ORG Victory Front  ] ( [ORG FPV  ] ) after [PER Alarcon  ] criticized the [ORG GOA  ] beef policy ( See Reftel A ) . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has also proven adept at co-opting members of the opposition and exploiting divisions within opposition parties . 
Through the skillful use of his fiscal powers , [PER Kirchner  ] has been able to draw in the majority of the [ORG Radical Civic Union  ] ( [ORG UCR  ] ) governors , and many [ORG UCR  ] mayors ( See Septel on deteriorating provincial finances and [PER Kirchner  ] 's use of fiscal power for political aims ) . 
He has also been able to co-opt the political leadership from the now defunct center-left [MISC Frepaso  ] and most of the [MISC Peronists  ] formerly aligned in opposition to [PER Kirchner  ] with former President [PER Eduardo Duhalde  ] . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has exploited divisions within the [ORG UCR  ] by heavily courting [PER Mendoza Governor  ] [PER Julio Cobos  ] , long-time rival of [ORG UCR  ] President [PER Roberto Iglesias  ] , even encouraging rumors that [PER Cobos  ] may be [PER Kirchner  ] 's running mate in 2007 . 
[PER Kirchner  ] also does not accept criticism from those outside of the political arena , attacking the press , the [MISC Catholic  ] Church and business leaders that have been publicly critical of the [LOC GOA.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While utilizing leftist , populist rhetoric at times , in practice [PER Kirchner  ] has demonstrated that his ideological leanings are always less important than the practicalities of domestic politics . 
As [PER Acevedo  ] recently told us , President [PER Kirchner  ] has no true ideology . 
For example , the issue of human rights and his political affiliations in the 1970s were non-issues in the 20 years of [PER Kirchner  ] 's political life as Mayor of [LOC Rio Gallegos  ] and Governor of [LOC Santa Cruz  ] province . 
[PER Acevedo  ] said [PER Kirchner  ] 's recent support for the Mothers of the [LOC Plaza de Mayo  ] and a renewed focus on human rights crimes committed under the last dictatorship was driven by his need to develop a core base of support within the left wing of the [MISC Peronist  ] movement . 
[PER Kirchner  ] was also a big proponent of the 1990s privatizations at the time they occurred , but has since vehemently attacked them . 
This does not mean that [PER Kirchner  ] does not have left-wing sympathies , but rather that these are completely subordinate to his personal political interests and ambition ( See Reftel B ) . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's left-wing sympathies have not stopped him from forming alliances of convenience with center-right [MISC Peronist  ] leaders , such as [PER Luis Barrionuevo  ] of [LOC Catamarca  ] , [PER Cordoba Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota  ] , or the largely conservative [MISC Peronist  ] political machine in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] province. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] 's style of policymaking has become more pronounced after the October 2005 elections and November 2005 cabinet changes left [PER Kirchner  ] firmly in charge of all aspects of [ORG GOA  ] decision making ( See Reftel C ) . 
Prior to the October elections , [PER Kirchner  ] had to consider former President [PER Duhalde  ] 's opinion in making major decisions . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's resounding victory in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] province in the elections left him in control of the [ORG Peronist Party  ] ( [ORG PJ  ] ) and banished [PER Duhalde  ] from the center stage of the political scene . 
Before [PER Kirchner  ] 's November cabinet changes , [PER Kirchner  ] also had to contend with his independent-minded Minister of the [ORG Economy  ] , [PER Roberto Lavagna  ] , in making economic policy decisions , and with then-Foreign Minister [PER Rafael Bielsa  ] , who occasionally exhibited an independent streak . 
Their replacements , [PER Felisa Miceli  ] and [PER Jorge Taiana  ] are loyal soldiers who follow presidential orders . 
For example , recently [PER Miceli  ] was give a copy of a communique that had been issued to a news agency by the [PER Casa Rosada  ] with [PER Miceli  ] 's comments criticizing a recent speech by [PER Lavagna  ] before [PER Miceli  ] had actually spoken . 
As leading pollster [PER Roberto Bacman  ] told [PER Poloff  ] , " Never since the return to democracy ( 1983 ) has [LOC Argentina  ] had a President that was also the Minister of the [ORG Economy  ] . 
" --------------------------------------------- KIRCHNER'S PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE SETS K-STYLE --------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) According to recent studies , [PER Kirchner  ] 's psychological profile includes a need to always be in control , quick and decisive decision making , and a constant struggle against perceived enemies . 
[PER Kirchner  ] does not delegate policymaking , [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001462 003 OF 005 making all of the important decisions himself . 
[PER Kirchner  ] only consults with a narrow group of long-time advisors , who are part of [PER Kirchner  ] 's inner circle primarily because of their loyalty , not their technical abilities ( See Reftel D ) . 
He often does not even consult or give warning to top [ORG GOA  ] officials before making major policy statements in their respective areas of responsibility . 
According to [ORG Central Bank  ] officials , for example , [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Martin Redrado  ] found out that the [ORG GOA  ] was going to use nearly 10 USD billion in [ORG Central Bank  ] reserves to pay off the [ORG IMF  ] when [PER Kirchner  ] publicly announced it . 
[PER Casa Rosada  ] insiders have described [PER Kirchner  ] as prone to making quick , sometimes even rash decisions . 
For example , [PER Kirchner  ] reportedly made a snap decision to institute a six-month ban on beef exports after learning that the price of beef had risen a significant amount the previous day in the country 's most important beef market . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has lashed out at has perceived enemies , both domestic and foreign , throughout his presidency . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's targets have included the [ORG IMF  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , the media , the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , the [MISC Argentine  ] military , the foreign and domestic business community , supermarkets , foreign gas stations , anything that happened in the 1990s , former Presidents [PER Carlos Menem  ] , [PER Fernando de la Rua  ] and [PER Eduardo Duhalde  ] . 
[PER Kirchner  ] often targets unpopular groups or individuals as a means to increase his own public approval ratings. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) When confronted with a problem , [PER Kirchner  ] 's first instinct is to go on the offensive , rather than negotiate , upping the ante if his initial efforts fail to win the desired result . 
When [PER Kirchner  ] faced resistance from the business and agricultural sector on his efforts to control inflation earlier in the year , [PER Kirchner  ] instituted a ban on the export of beef and appointed the unorthodox [MISC Peronist  ] economist [PER Guillermo Moreno  ] to run the [ORG GOA  ] 's anti-inflation efforts through bullying and threatening individual producers to lower their prices . 
When [MISC Uruguayan  ] President [PER Tabare Vazquez  ] did not respond well to [PER Kirchner  ] 's insistence that [LOC Uruguay  ] halt the construction of two paper plants on the [MISC Argentine  ] border to conduct additional environmental studies , [PER Kirchner  ] 's rhetoric encouraged the residents of the affected province to step up their blockade of the bridges connecting the two countries , resulting in millions of dollars of lost trade and tourism income for [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
Faced with rising gas prices in early 2005 , [PER Kirchner  ] called for a national boycott of [ORG Shell Oil  ] and sent thousands of piqueteros to blockade [ORG Shell Oil  ] gas stations until they agreed to lower their prices. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] has a reputation for taking slights or any perceived lack of respect from others personally , but is also known for quick changes in temperament . 
[PER Acevedo  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that once then-Governor [PER Kirchner  ] became enraged with his Deputy Energy Minister for making a statement regarding [LOC Santa Cruz  ] energy policy he did not personally approve . 
[PER Kirchner  ] called the Deputy Minister into his office and proceeded to scream at him at the top of his lungs , ultimately effectively throwing him out of his office physically . 
Everyone in the provincial government leadership expected the Deputy Minister to be fired . 
[PER Kirchner  ] did not speak to him for two weeks , until he unexpectedly called him asking for some trout for a dinner that [PER Kirchner  ] was hosting . 
[PER Acevedo  ] said this individual had a reputation for knowing where to get the best trout in [LOC Rio Gallegos  ] . 
The Deputy Minister complied with the request , and two days later [PER Kirchner  ] invited him for coffee . 
[PER Kirchner  ] greeted him warmly , thanked him for the trout , and proceeded to chat with him for a long period , as if the previous incident had never happened , to the shock of everyone else present , including the Deputy Minister . 
In the end , the Deputy Minister was not fired , and [PER Kirchner  ] did not raise the issue again. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] 's health condition exacerbates , and perhaps helps define , [PER Kirchner  ] 's emotions and psychology . 
President [PER Kirchner  ] has reportedly suffered from irritable bowel syndrome for many years . 
According to the [ORG American Medical Association  ] , the psychological effects of this condition leads those who suffer from it to be " often rigid , methodical persons who are conscientious , with obsessive-compulsive [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001462 004 OF 005 tendencies . 
" [PER Kirchner  ] also reportedly works himself to exhaustion and needs to take frequent vacations to recover . 
The [ORG AMA  ] further states " Psychologic and social stresses are often present in patients with irritable bowel syndrome , and may be related in a temporal sense to the exacerbation of symptoms . 
" This may account for [PER Kirchner  ] 's lack of attention to protocol that involves long ceremonies or tight schedules , where [PER Kirchner  ] would not have quick access to a bathroom. ----------------------------------- FOREIGN POLICY NOT KIRCHNER'S FOCUS ----------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Foreign policy in the [PER Kirchner  ] government is always subservient to domestic political considerations . 
[PER Kirchner  ] , at least initially , took a hard line on the paper mills dispute with [LOC Uruguay  ] -- despite the damage to [LOC Mercosur  ] and regional relations -- because of the strong [MISC Argentine  ] public concern about the paper mills , particularly in ruling-party-run Entre Rios province that is on the opposite side of the river from the plants . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's explicit and harsh criticism of the [LOC U.S.  ] during his speech during the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] in [LOC Mar del Plata  ] can only be understood in the context of dismal public perceptions of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [PER Kirchner  ] 's desire to appeal to his leftist political base ( See Reftel E ) . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's hardball tactics during negotiations over [LOC Argentina  ] 's private sector debt and his criticism of foreign companies that run major enterprises that were privatized in the 1990s do not earn him any support from foreign investors , but are popular with the [MISC Argentine  ] public . 
Likewise , [PER Kirchner  ] cut [MISC Argentine  ] gas exports to [LOC Chile  ] in 2005 to cover shortages in the internal market despite the existence of valid contracts between [LOC Chile  ] and local gas suppliers. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) President [PER Kirchner  ] is not skilled at international diplomacy and often ignores basic protocol . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's gaffes with foreign dignitaries are legendary . 
In June 2004 , [PER Kirchner  ] left [MISC Russian  ] leader [PER Vladimir Putin  ] waiting at the [LOC Moscow  ] airport for a meeting that never happened , reportedly because [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] wanted to spend more time shopping at their previous stop in [LOC Prague  ] . 
The [ORG GOA  ] claimed that " bad weather " had delayed their takeoff when weather reports showed sunny conditions in [LOC Prague  ] . 
Later that year , President [PER Kirchner  ] failed to attend a state dinner he was supposed to host for visiting [MISC Vietnamese  ] President [PER Tran Duc Luong  ] . 
In like fashion , [PER Kirchner  ] failed to attend a reception in honor of the State visit of [ORG Queen Beatriz of Holland  ] in March of 2006 . 
[PER Kirchner  ] also never receives new Ambassadors , as state protocol would dictate , relegating this responsibility to Vice President [PER Daniel Scioli.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] relies on an ever-shrinking group of long-time advisors to make key decisions , many of whom lack international , business and economic expertise ( See Reftel D ) . 
No one from the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is part of [PER Kirchner  ] 's inner circle of advisors , and very few of [PER Kirchner  ] 's close associates had overseas experience before [PER Kirchner  ] became President ( See Reftel F ) . 
As a result , [PER Kirchner  ] often receives poor advice on international issues , such as when Legal and Technical Secretary [PER Carlos Zannini  ] reportedly convinced [PER Kirchner  ] that taking a tough line publicly on counter terrorism would , in the eyes of the [ORG USG  ] , compensate for being critical of the [LOC U.S.  ] in other areas and opposing the [ORG FTAA  ] at the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ( See Reftel E ) . ------------------------------------ COMMENT -- IMPLICATIONS FOR THE [LOC U.S.  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] 's peculiar operating and decision-making style defines [MISC Argentine  ] policymaking , and in the coming year , may lead to more challenges in the [MISC U.S.-Argentine  ] relationship , as [PER Kirchner  ] focuses on shoring up his center-left political base for the 2007 elections . 
Given poll numbers that show [MISC Argentines  ] have the least positive view of the [LOC U.S.  ] out of all nations in the region , the [LOC U.S.  ] will be a convenient target for [PER Kirchner  ] . 
As during the 2003 presidential campaign , [PER Kirchner  ] will likely portray himself [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001462 005 OF 005 as the lone true defender of [LOC Argentina  ] in the world community . 
The [ORG Casa Rosada  ] has reportedly already begun an effort to link [PER Roberto Lavagna  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] , for example by encouraging press articles that the [LOC U.S.  ] approved and is sponsoring a potential [PER Lavagna  ] campaign for President. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] has a history of using international disputes , like the paper mill conflict with [LOC Uruguay  ] , to gain domestic popular support . 
We have been told by our [MISC British  ] colleagues that relations between the [LOC U.K.  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] are at their lowest point in 15 years because [PER Kirchner  ] has chosen a confrontational attitude with the [LOC U.K.  ] on the [LOC Falkland Islands  ] dispute , thereby making political use of an issue that is at the core of [MISC Argentine  ] national identity . 
As leading political analyst [PER Rosendo Fraga  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] , " This year , [PER Kirchner  ] will use the [LOC U.K.  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] as targets , and next year , it will be the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" [PER Kirchner  ] has been described to us by his close associates as someone who constantly focuses on the costs and benefits of his political decisions . 
During a recent trip to [LOC Spain  ] , [PER Kirchner  ] criticized the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's " absence " and lack of significant assistance to the region . 
Former Minister [PER Lavagna  ] told the Ambassador that [PER Kirchner  ] did this in order to counter the image that he had been too forthcoming with [MISC Spanish  ] multinationals during the trip . 
As the 2007 presidential campaign approaches , we cannot rule out occasional anti-U.S. diatribes by [PER Kirchner  ] in order to placate his leftist supporters .
