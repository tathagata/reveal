REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: The [ORG Head of Libya  ] 's [ORG Housing  ] and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] [PER Mohamed Abujela  ] al-Mabruk told the Ambassador on February 15 that approximately half of [LOC Libya  ] 's 2008 projected investment of 62 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars ( USD 47 billion ) in construction projects had been awarded , primarily to foreign companies . 
He noted that the projected investment was expected to increase by nearly 10 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars within the next few years . 
While [LOC China  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] had received the most contracts thus far , [PER Mabruk  ] highlighted that there was plenty of room left for [LOC U.S.  ] companies to compete , potentially for even larger projects than had been awarded to date . 
He welcomed the February 20-23 [ORG U.S. Trade Mission  ] and expressed an interest in closer bilateral trade engagement . 
End Summary . 
DEVELOPMENT BUDGET LIKELY TO INCREASE 2 . 
( C ) During a February 15 meeting with the Ambassador , the [LOC Head  ] of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Housing  ] and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] ( [ORG HIB  ] ) , [PER Mohamed Abujela  ] al-Mabruk , accompanied by Dr. [PER Ibrahim Shukri  ] , [ORG HIB  ] 's head of the [ORG Follow-up Department  ] , explained that [LOC Libya  ] 's projected investment in infrastructure construction of 62 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars ( USD 47 billion ) would probably increase to at least 70 billion LYD ( USD 55 billion ) over the next few years . 
The reason for the increase , according to [PER Mabruk  ] was the absence of " a lot of information " from the previous estimate . 
Whereas the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( Ministry-equivalent ) for Planning and Finance estimated in 2005 that 420,000 houses would need to be constructed over the next five years to accommodate [LOC Libya  ] 's growing population , rapid demographic changes -- including hundreds of additional expatriate families -- had led to a current estimate of 500,000 housing units . 
Although the estimated number of additional construction projects had increased , the investment budget has not yet increased , he explained . 
He estimated that nearly 25 billion LYD would still be contracted out over the next few years . 
3 . 
( C ) According to [PER Mabruk  ] , the [ORG HIB  ] builds to the government 's order and does not contribute to determinations of construction figures or the allocation of the housing units . 
[ORG HIB  ] has been charged with building 200,000 housing units throughout [LOC Libya  ] and is the only authority in [LOC Libya  ] appointed to upgrade existing and new public infrastructure . 
Over 25 percent of [ORG HIB  ] 's contracts ( more than 10 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars ) have been awarded to [MISC Chinese  ] companies , representing the bulk of [ORG HIB  ] 's contracts . 
" And they will get more , " [PER Mabruk  ] predicted . 
[MISC Turkish  ] firms are the second highest recipient of [ORG HIB  ] contracts , worth 3 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars ) . 
In addition to the [ORG HIB  ] , [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Organization for the Development of Administrative Centers  ] ( [ORG ODAC  ] ) was also tasked with building housing units , as well as large public projects such as schools , universities , and hospitals . 
Both organizations fall under the authority of the General Board of [ORG Public Works  ] , along with three city-specific development agencies , in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Benghazi  ] and [LOC Ghadames  ] . 
Outside of this authority , only the [ORG Ministry of Transportation  ] manages urban planning projects , specifically for airports , roads , bridges , railways , and ports . 
[PER Mabruk  ] remarked that the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] was also involved in limited , specific development projects . 
[LOC U.S.  ] COMPANIES WELCOME TO BID ON CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS 4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador highlighted the February 20-23 [ORG U.S. Trade Mission  ] and inquired whether there was still room left in the infrastructure construction sector for [LOC U.S.  ] companies . 
[PER Mabruk  ] explained that nearly half of [LOC Libya  ] 's construction investment budget , or approximately 34 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars had been awarded in contracts so far . 
However , he believed that [LOC U.S.  ] firms would be highly competitive for future bids , particularly in infrastructure construction projects for small cities , construction supervision , project management , engineering , water treatment and waste management , and architecture and design . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mabruk  ] explained the process for [LOC U.S.  ] firms to bid on [ORG HIB  ] projects -- namely that a company must first contact the [ORG HIB  ] with a letter of intent and begin negotiations with the agency . 
He noted that the [ORG HIB  ] is willing to initiate negotiations with a company even before the company is legally registered in [LOC Libya  ] . 
If a contract is awarded , the [ORG HIB  ] will send the company a letter , which is required for a company to register itself . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000166 002.2 OF 002 Companies that enter into joint venture partnerships with [MISC Libyan  ] firms will be given preference by the [ORG HIB  ] , and if a foreign company partners with the [ORG Economic and Social Development Fund  ] ( [ORG ESDF  ] ) , it can be awarded contracts without having to compete with other bids . 
( Note: Other agencies have informed us of the same preferential treatment to joint-venture firms . 
End note . 
) According to [PER Mabruk  ] , the Prime Minister-equivalent has recently moved to allow joint-ventures partnerships to be comprised of less than a 35-percent share for [MISC Libyan  ] partners and a 65-percent share or greater for foreign partners . 
Prior to the change , a foreign partner could not own more than a 65-percent share in a joint-venture . 
He pointed to the example of a recent [ORG HIB  ] contract that was signed on a public works project in the [LOC Green Mountains  ] , by which the [MISC Libyan  ] government allowed an [MISC Italian  ] firm to take a 76-percent stake in the joint-venture project . 
If the Prime Minister-equivalent approved the contract , [PER Mabruk  ] remarked that it would be precedent for future joint-venture partnerships . 
[ORG AECOM:  ] A MODEL FOR [LOC U.S.  ] BUSINESS IN [LOC LIBYA  ] 6 . 
( C ) [PER Mabruk  ] explained that since 2008 , [ORG HIB  ] has been working with the [MISC American  ] company [ORG AECOM  ] as the direct program manager for every [ORG HIB  ] contract . 
After a company approaches the [ORG HIB  ] with interest in negotiating a contract , [ORG HIB  ] refers the company to [ORG AECOM  ] , which prequalifies bidders and refers them back to the [ORG HIB  ] according to company size and specialization . 
After the [ORG HIB  ] selects a company and signs a contract , [ORG AECOM  ] is responsible for managing the work of that company . 
[PER Mabruk  ] noted that [ORG HIB  ] 's partnership with [ORG AECOM  ] was the first and largest of its kind in [LOC Libya  ] , whereby a foreign company is , for all intents and purposes , managing all of the [ORG HIB  ] 's work. xxxxxxxxxxxx He said that many infrastructure projects throughout the country were facing problems due to faulty contractors , but that [ORG AECOM  ] was limited in the manner in which it could address such issues . 
BIO AND COMMENT 7 . 
( C ) [PER Mohamed Abujela  ] al-Mabruk moved to [LOC Seattle  ] in 1977 to study engineering . 
In 1978 , he enrolled in the [ORG University of Southern California  ] 's [ORG Graduate School of Engineering  ] , where he stayed until 1983 . 
He earned a Master 's Degree and Doctorate in [LOC Engineering  ] from [ORG USC  ] . 
In 1983 , he moved back to [LOC Tripoli  ] and become a professor at [ORG Al Fatah University School of Engineering  ] , where he taught [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi . 
He remained in that position until 1995 , when he was named Chairman of the [ORG Industrial Steel Company  ] of [LOC Misurata  ] ( 1995-2005 ) . 
During the second half of 2005 , he was dual-hatted as head of the [ORG Authority of Infrastructure and Development  ] , a precursor to the [ORG HIB  ] . 
In 2006 he was named Deputy Head of the [ORG HIB  ] , serving under then-chairman [PER Abuzeid Dorda  ] . 
From 2007-2009 he served as Minister of [ORG Transportation  ] , and in 2009 , he was appointed head of the [ORG HIB  ] . 
8 . 
( C ) Like other GOL interlocutors that we have met in advance of the [ORG Trade Mission  ] , the [ORG HIB  ] was extremely welcoming of [LOC U.S.  ] investment in [LOC Libya  ] and was very willing to coordinate meetings between the [ORG HIB  ] and the twenty-five companies that will participate in the delegation . 
His assessment of current and future investment estimates shows that [LOC Libya  ] will continue to be a land of opportunity well into the foreseeable future .
