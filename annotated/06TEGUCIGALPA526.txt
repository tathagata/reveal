( C ) Summary: [MISC Honduran  ] President [PER Jose Manuel  ] " [PER Mel  ] " [PER Zelaya  ] and his [ORG Administration  ] have now been in office approximately 45 days . 
While [PER Zelaya  ] is clearly a friend of the [ORG USG  ] , as Post predicted his personality , administration , and policy decisions are making working with him a challenge . 
On the plus side , [PER Zelaya  ] has moved with resolve to conclude [ORG CAFTA  ] for an April 1 implementation , supports [ORG USG  ] efforts on counter-narcotics , has cooperated on deportation issues , and has accepted [LOC U.S.  ] DOD assistance in drafting a [ORG Honduran National Security Strategy  ] , with a workshop for his [ORG Administration  ] planned for May 5-7 . 
However , there have been delays in reforming [MISC Immigration  ] , crime appears to have worsened , and economic policy is a mixed bag , with fuel being a particularly controversial issue . 
Post is also concerned by the attention being paid to the more ideological voices within the [PER Zelaya  ] administration . 
Some in the [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] may be showing their true colors -- some populist or radical , other merely concerned with protecting their business interests . 
[PER Zelaya  ] strikes us as a pro-U.S. political pragmatist , but one somewhat beholden to the competing forces within his party . 
Ambassador and [PER Zelaya  ] had a lengthy discussion March 14 ( hosted by Former President [PER Carlos Flores  ] ) to try to clear the air and improve bilateral communication . 
While communication will hopefully improve , [PER Zelaya  ] must take a more active leadership role if he seeks to establish rational policymaking in his [ORG Administration  ] . 
End Summary . 
Pressure From Different Camps in [ORG Liberal Party  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador and the [ORG Country Team  ] have established a close working relationship with President [PER Zelaya  ] and his cabinet . 
As President-elect , [PER Zelaya  ] and three of his advisors met on January 20 with the [ORG Country Team  ] at the Embassy for a one-hour country briefing followed by a half-hour session dedicated specifically to [ORG CAFTA  ] ( ref J ) . 
This meeting came after a January 11 [ORG Country Team  ] briefing of several of [PER Zelaya  ] 's designated ministers , and a January 13 luncheon meeting between the Ambassador , DCM , and the President-elect and his private secretary , [PER Raul Valladares  ] ( ref K ) . 
President [PER Zelaya  ] has also held meetings with the Ambassador several times at the Ambassador 's residence , both before and after his inauguration . 
From day one , [PER Zelaya  ] has relished the idea of meeting President [PER Bush  ] ( a [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000526 002.2 OF 007 meeting is tentatively set for June ) and he literally made the [MISC Central American  ] presidents and [MISC Mexican  ] President [PER Vicente Fox  ] wait outside while he made Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] the first official meeting of his presidency ( ref I ) . 
Even before that , with one day 's notice he brought his most senior leadership to [LOC San Pedro  ] Sula to see R [PER U/S Hughes  ] and [ORG WHA  ] Assistant Secretary [PER Shannon  ] , and he changed his Foreign Minister-designee at the Ambassador 's request . 
There has been a consistent thread in [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] , whether from [PER Zelaya  ] himself , his VP , or his ministers , and it has been pro-U.S. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) What appears to be causing some confusion in [PER Zelaya  ] 's policies are competing camps in the [ORG Liberal Party  ] seeking to influence [PER Zelaya  ] 's decisions . 
[ORG Liberal Party  ] President [PER Patricia Rodas  ] and two prominent cabinet ministers , Minister of Government and Justice [PER Jorge Arturo Reina  ] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [PER Milton Jimenez  ] , have a strong left-leaning backgrounds . 
( However it is critical to note that these same advisors go out of their way to make clear they value the bilateral relationship with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) In a possible indication of more ideological influence from these advisors , and in a possible contradiction to then-head of transition and now Minister of Finance [PER Hugo Noe Pino  ] 's December 2005 statements to [PER PolChief  ] that a [PER Zelaya  ] government projects no change in relation with [LOC Taiwan  ] or [LOC China  ] , [LOC Honduras  ] appears to be toying with closer relations to the [LOC Peoples Republic of China  ] ( [LOC PRC  ] ) at the potential expense of [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
This is despite the fact that [PER Zelaya  ] plans to visit [LOC Taiwan  ] soon . 
While the [ORG GOH  ] may just be seeking an expanded commercial relationship with the [LOC PRC  ] , an understandable goal , and not want to break relations with [LOC Taiwan  ] , its repeated discussion of the issue leads Post to wonder what the [ORG GOH  ] 's intentions are . 
( See refs D and F for details . 
) On [LOC Cuba  ] , as [PER Noe Pino  ] told [PER PolChief  ] prior to the inauguration and [PER FM Jimenez  ] has reiterated publicly , [PER Zelaya  ] intends to send an Ambassador to [LOC Cuba  ] , probably in 2007 . 
Bilateral relations were reestablished by the [ORG Flores Administration  ] and maintained by the [ORG Maduro Administration  ] . 
There has been a Charge d'Affaires but not yet an Ambassador. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The different camps in the [ORG Liberal Party  ] , led by [PER Rodas/Jimenez  ] , [PER Reina  ] , [LOC San Pedro  ] Sula business tycoon [PER Jaime Rosenthal  ] ( father of Minister of the Presidency [PER Yani Rosenthal  ] ) , former President [PER Carlos Flores  ] ( who appears to be seeking to bolster Vice President [PER Elvin Santos'  ] standing ) , and others , leaves a [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] torn in different directions . 
While some of this may be healthy , in that he is receiving competing views , much of it is counterproductive as different factions fight for power and influence . 
Contacts in the [ORG National Party  ] have voiced their interest in this intra-party fight . 
[PER Zelaya  ] has chosen to appoint six of his seven easily vanquished presidential primary opponents to cabinet-level positions , and appointed the seventh 's son ( [PER Yani Rosenthal  ] ) also to the cabinet . 
This despite the fact that congressmen who ran on [PER Zelaya  ] 's ticket in the primaries constitute 46 of the 63 [ORG Liberal Party  ] congressmen , including President of [ORG Congress Roberto Micheletti  ] - seen as a [PER Flores  ] ally , giving [PER Zelaya  ] what should be fairly strong loyalty from 74 percent of [ORG Liberal Party  ] congressmen. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) It appears to Post that when [PER Zelaya  ] does choose a policy direction , such as on fuel ( reftels [MISC A-C  ] ) , the [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000526 003.2 OF 007 President may have different goals than that of his advisors/ministers . 
[PER Santos  ] has clashed with [PER Rodas  ] ever since he was chosen as [PER Zelaya  ] 's running mate , and in February [PER Santos  ] told the Ambassador he was considering resigning , but during [PER Zelaya  ] 's recent trip to [LOC Panama  ] and [LOC Chile  ] [PER Santos  ] appears to have hit his stride . 
He is acting like a confident VP not worried about threats to his influence from within the party . 
Post would like to see [PER Zelaya  ] do the same and take the lead on what is best for [LOC Honduras  ] , with the [ORG USG  ] being a countervailing power to help [PER Zelaya  ] turn aside self-interested/corrupt groups within his party ( and [MISC Honduran  ] society ) and conduct responsible political and economic reform . 
However it often seems that the fight is between an entrenched establishment , those seeking more radical change , and the great mass of [MISC Hondurans  ] who need to feel tangible benefits to regain faith and democracy and free markets , with [PER Zelaya  ] 's policies not yet showing a consistent thread. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Former President [PER Flores  ] hosted a meeting the evening of March 14 between the Ambassador and President [PER Zelaya  ] , with [PER Flores  ] and [PER FM Jimenez  ] participating in most of the meeting , in an attempt to help enhance bilateral relations and clarify any recent communication problems , such as during the ongoing fuel issue ( reftels [MISC A-C  ] ) . 
Before the meeting began [PER Flores  ] told the Ambassador privately that [PER Zelaya  ] does not seem to understand the consequences of his public statements . 
[PER Zelaya  ] , after telling the Ambassador that he makes some key decisions ( such as fuel ) on his own , told the Ambassador to stay in close contact with [PER FM Jimenez  ] , despite the fact that it was clear to the Ambassador that on crucial issues it will be necessary to go straight to [PER Zelaya  ] . 
[PER Flores  ] emphasized to [PER Zelaya  ] that aside from political considerations in his party , the only people a [MISC Honduran  ] President needed to consult with were [MISC Roman Catholic  ] Cardinal [PER Oscar Rodriguez  ] and the [MISC American  ] Ambassador . 
[ORG Regional Security  ] a [ORG Highlight  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Zelaya  ] strongly supports [ORG USG  ] efforts on counter-narcotics , and has accepted [LOC U.S.  ] DOD assistance in drafting a [MISC Honduran  ] [ORG National Security Strategy  ] , with a workshop for his [ORG Administration  ] planned for May 5-7 . 
Combined training events are proceeding as planned , and a [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] 15-person team recently visited to assess the operational capabilities of the [MISC Honduran  ] military . 
Minister of [ORG Defense Aristedes Mejia  ] 's decision to keep intact the military leadership ( with some changes recently ) has strengthened a strong relationship built during his tenure as President of the [ORG Supreme Electoral Tribunal  ] when the military was one of the few nonpartisan institutions that actually worked in the contested election . 
The [MISC Honduran  ] military has also been at the forefront of the [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] 's nascent efforts to protect natural resources , specifically to try to prevent illegal logging . 
The Embassy has found the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] to be a bright spot in the infant [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] , helped by the fact that [ORG MOD Mejia  ] is close to President [PER Zelaya  ] ( see ref G ) . 
[ORG Immigration Reform Stalled  ] -------------------------- [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000526 004.6 OF 007 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] has continued [ORG GOH  ] cooperation on deportation issues , including being the first [MISC Central American  ] country to conduct video interviews of [MISC Hondurans  ] awaiting deportation , with planes coming in daily , including permission for Saturday flights . 
In addition , [ORG GOH  ] approval for use of [LOC San Pedro  ] Sula for deportation flights continues , although the lack of promised resources from the [ORG USG  ] means that [LOC San Pedro  ] Sula has not yet been prepped for the intake of thousands of deportees. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOH  ] has not yet made discernible progress in reforming [MISC Honduran  ] Immigration . 
Despite President [PER Zelaya  ] telling the Ambassador that he would move the immigration function from the [ORG Ministry of Government and Justice  ] to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , it has not been moved . 
Indeed , the Director of [PER Immigration  ] told ConGen on March 7 that he had resigned after the [ORG Presidential Palace  ] pressed his office to violate procedures to issue the President 's children diplomatic passports . 
( This resignation is not yet public as it will be accepted by the [ORG MinGov March  ] 16 . 
) A scandal broke , also in early March , when citizens of [LOC Albania  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and [LOC Bosnia  ] were admitted in apparent violation of [MISC Honduran  ] immigration law . 
The scandal has the hallmarks of all [MISC Honduran  ] scandals , i.e. several days of outraged newspaper articles , with intimations of private interests at stake , followed by grandstanding by law enforcement officials and , finally , no meaningful action or change . 
The Ambassador raised this scandal with President [PER Zelaya  ] during their March 14 discussions , in an attempt to break away from the dysfunctional status quo on [PER Immigration  ] . 
President [PER Zelaya  ] told the Ambassador in that discussion that [MISC German  ] [LOC Espinal  ] , former executive director of the [ORG National Anti-Corruption Commission  ] , would be named to lead Immigration out of the [ORG Ministry of Government and Justice  ] , but left it unclear if [PER Immigration  ] would be an independent entity . 
Ambassador and EmbOffs met with [ORG MinGov Reina  ] March 16 and he announced he would form a commission to identify procedures for finding a new Director of [PER Immigration  ] to begin the reform process . 
[ORG MinGov Reina  ] left open the possibility that immigration would remain in his [ORG Ministry  ] or be moved elsewhere . 
Ambassador told [ORG Reina  ] that the [MISC Mission  ] looked forward to working with and supporting his reform efforts . 
Further details of this conversation will be reported septel . 
[ORG Ministry of Public Security Adding Cops but Slow to Reform  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There is a widespread perception that street crime has increased significantly since [PER Zelaya  ] took over . 
While the statistics are not authoritative , there is certainly more crime reported in the press . 
There is no doubt that more [MISC Mission  ] members have been crime victims in recent weeks than before . 
These crimes have involved the use of firearms and have taken place in upscale residential neighborhoods . 
( See ref H for more details . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) There are a disturbing number of indications that police personnel are involved in some crimes , though such allegations , and evidence , are not unique to this government . 
While both [PER Zelaya  ] and Minister of [ORG Public Security  ] [PER Alvaro Romero  ] have stated support for the rehabilitation of criminals , especially past gang members , preferring a multi-disciplinary approach that utilizes [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000526 005.4 OF 007 governmental programs as well as NGOs with rehabilitation projects , the message sent has been criticized by many . 
In fact , one hypothesis is that weak leadership in the [ORG Ministry of Public Security  ] has allowed bad elements in the police to act with greater impunity than before . 
[PER Romero  ] , despite his bold statements about police being part of the problem , has yet to take any measures to shake up the corrupt ranks of the police . 
On a positive note and fulfilling a campaign promise , [PER Zelaya  ] has begun to increase the police force by incorporating hundreds of military policemen who have recently completed their military service into the police force . 
He has also kept the [ORG Maduro Administration  ] 's policy of boosting police patrols with military forces under " [LOC Honduras  ] [ORG Segura  ] . 
" Economic Policy a Mixed [PER Bag: Trade Good  ] , Fuel Bad --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG Trade:  ] The [ORG GOH  ] has worked diligently to vet all proposed [MISC CAFTA-required  ] legislation and regulations with the [ORG USG  ] , and submitted those proposals to the [MISC Honduran  ] [ORG Congress  ] , which passed them March 15 . 
Minister of [ORG Trade and Industry  ] [PER Elizabeth Azcona  ] said she believes the needed approvals will be enacted in time for an entry into force of [ORG CAFTA  ] on April 1 . 
Post finds it particularly significant that the [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] , following directly from [PER Zelaya  ] 's pro-free trade position , has accepted all key [ORG USG  ] demands , and gotten congressional approval quickly over changes that will have significant impact on some key domestic interest groups. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [MISC Energy: As  ] discussed in refs [MISC A-C  ] , the [ORG GOH  ] has announced the nationalization of all fuel imports , and has threatened to also build its own storage facilities if existing facility owners do not agree to store the imported fuel at rates the [ORG GOH  ] finds acceptable . 
If implemented , this action could constitute expropriation of a [LOC U.S.  ] investment. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Macroeconomic policy: The [ORG GOH  ] continues to outperform [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] targets . 
However , the [ORG GOH  ] has privately asked the [ORG IMF  ] to loosen certain targets , notably including public sector wages and overall fiscal deficit ceilings . 
There would be room in the program to do so and still attain minimum targets , but the [ORG IMF  ] is concerned that the apparent flagging political will this early in the administration to make the difficult decisions bodes poorly for later years. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Mining: In a February 10 meeting , Minister of Environment and [ORG Natural Resources  ] ( [ORG SERNA  ] ) [PER Mayra Mejia  ] told Ambassador that she understood the need to balance environmental protections and investor protections . 
She said she undertook to improve efficiency and transparency in her ministry . 
The following week , [PER Mejia  ] renewed the two-year old moratorium on new mining projects for another year , effectively blocking any new investment or significant expansion of existing investment . 
[LOC U.S.  ] firm [ORG Mayan Gold  ] , meanwhile , continues to suffer at the hands of illegal artesanal miners squatting on their gold-mining concession . 
To date , the company reports , neither [ORG SERNA  ] nor the [ORG Public Ministry  ] has taken any action to correct this illegal action . 
The mining legislation , pending since last summer , appears to be finally back on table for discussion . 
[ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000526 006.3 OF 007 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [MISC Agriculture: Based  ] on the proposed sectoral budget for agriculture , the [ORG GOH  ] appears to plan to shift significant resources ( perhaps 60 percent of the overall sector budget ) into supporting basic grains production ( ref E ) . 
If enacted , this strikes Post as a significant step backwards , into an era of state-supported production of non-competitive commodities . 
It is also a rejection of the recent successes of projects demonstrating the economic benefits of producing non-traditional crops for export. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG Telecommunications:  ] The [ORG GOH  ] has thus far failed to pass pending telecommunications reform legislation , and reports indicate that efforts are underway in some quarters to gut the legislation , provide additional state support for failing parastatal Hondutel , and significantly weaken state telecommunications regulator Conatel . 
Post is cautiously optimistic that most of these negative changes will be reversed during the mark-up process , but laments the lack of [ORG GOH  ] leadership seen thus far on the issue. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] ( [ORG MCA  ] ) : The [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] has been willing to dedicate substantial efforts to launching the [ORG MCA  ] program and as a result has received the first disbursement under the program . 
However , [ORG MCC  ] staff are concerned that some selection of personnel has been based on personal relationships with the President and that competitive processes have been used to produce pre-determined results . 
In one case , this has resulted in [ORG MCC  ] objecting to the appointment of the Director for [ORG FONADERS  ] ( a project implementation unit in the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] - see para . 
20 ) . 
[ORG MCC  ] and other donors are also being lobbied by [ORG GOH  ] officials to use concrete rather than asphalt in improvements to the major highway . 
While there may be legitimate reasons to use concrete , including problems with asphalt on stretches of the same road , Post is concerned that this may be motivated by [PER Jaime Rosenthal  ] , who owns a substantial portion of the production capacity for concrete in [LOC Honduras.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Transparency: While the [ORG Zelaya Administration  ] has announced that the private business interests of [ORG GOH  ] ministers involved in the [ORG MCA  ] process will not be able to bid on any [ORG MCA  ] contracts , Post is increasingly concerned at the persistent [ORG GOH  ] failure to grasp the essence of transparency in decision-making . 
The [ORG GOH  ] has repeatedly shown that it considers inviting a wide group of participants to a meeting where the decision is presented as a fait accompli to be " transparent " - such as in the fuel issue . 
Another example is that [ORG FONADERS  ] recently ran an open and competitive hiring process for its new director . 
President [PER Zelaya  ] overruled the review panel 's choice and instead insisted on installing a person he thought highly of from his days in the [ORG Flores Administration  ] but with no agricultural background in the position . 
Early Enough to Change Direction -------------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Comment: It is early enough in [LOC Zelaya  ] 's presidency to make some key course corrections ( especially on fuel ) , sideline some of his questionable advisors , and act decisively . 
He must both resist the temptation to act rashly to seek change for change 's sake , but also realize [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000526 007.3 OF 007 that his honeymoon will end and if he is unwilling to take tough decisions he will soon find himself in the situation that President [PER Ricardo Maduro  ] did after six months . 
[PER Maduro  ] established that he was successful on fiscal policy , seen as trying to be successful on crime , and was not really serious about implementing any other fundamental changes . 
This impression , and his low popularity , stuck with him the remainder of his presidency , aside from a few hills and valleys ( notably his clashes with teachers unions ) . 
Post is hopeful that [PER Zelaya  ] can adapt and set a bolder course that will help reform [LOC Honduras  ] without breaking it. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Comment Continued . 
To do this [PER Zelaya  ] must rely on his sincere pro-U.S. attitude and get past his apparent resentment of [MISC Honduran  ] dependency on the [LOC U.S.  ] , with some of his advisors grating at the obvious nature of [LOC U.S.  ] political and economic power . 
As [ORG Flores  ] advised [PER Zelaya  ] , he must realize he cannot " fool the [MISC Americans  ] , " and recognize his own inexperience and need for counsel . 
Post is guardedly optimistic that this early heart-to-heart between the Ambassador and President [PER Zelaya  ] will help prevent future disconnects and help [PER Zelaya  ] realize that his statements and actions will often have greater impact that his privately shared intentions . 
End Comment .
