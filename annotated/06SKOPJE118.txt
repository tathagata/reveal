End Summary . 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN EARLY SUMMER , CONCERNS ABOUT OPPOSITION TACTICS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a dinner with Ambassador , DCM , DATT , and P/E Chief on February 1 , PM [PER Buckovski  ] said parliamentary elections likely would be held in late June or early July to allow the next government to organize itself during the summer . 
The draft electoral code would enter parliamentary debate by the first week of March , with passage expected by mid-March . 
[PER Buckovski  ] , who was accompanied by his foreign policy and national security advisers , said he was hopeful the parliament would have passed important judicial reform laws ( on the police and on the courts ) before the election date. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Buckovski  ] said he was concerned that opposition center-right party [MISC VMRO-DPMNE  ] would play a " destructive " role during the electoral campaign and elections . 
He cited recent demonstrations by unemployed tobacco workers from [LOC Kumanovo  ] and [LOC Prilep  ] , and ongoing street blockades by an [ORG NGO  ] protesting government plans to privatize the state electrical power company , as typical examples of [MISC VMRO-DPMNE  ] destabilization tactics . 
( Comment: We agree there was a partisan political dimension to the protests , in addition to the underlying socio-economic complaints by workers and citizens . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Noting [MISC VMRO-DPMNE  ] objections to government plans to staff local election boards with civil servants , [PER Buckovski  ] said that previous elections had been marred by the appointment of political party members to those boards , which made the board members susceptible to manipulation and fraud . 
The government proposal would , he claimed , be more reassuring to voters , especially in primarily ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] areas where fraud had typically been most prevalent . 
Ethnic [MISC Albanians  ] would put more stock in the integrity of civil service professionals than they would in party representatives . 
DPA'S RETURN TO [ORG PARLIAMENT  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Buckovski  ] thanked Ambassador for her constructive role in persuading the ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] opposition party [ORG DPA  ] to return to the [ORG Parliament  ] after a 9-month hiatus to protest irregularities during local elections last March and April ( reftel ) . 
He said that he would welcome receiving [ORG DPA  ] 's suggestions for amendments to the draft electoral code , and would discuss those amendments the following day ( February 2 ) with a [ORG DPA  ] representative . 
During the conversation , [PER Buckovski  ] spoke by phone with [ORG DPA  ] Vice President [PER Menduh Thaci  ] , and with Speaker of [ORG Parliament  ] [PER Jordanovski  ] , to arrange for [ORG DPA  ] 's return to [ORG Parliament  ] the week of February 6 . 
[ORG NATO  ] ACCESSION [ORG SKOPJE  ] 00000118 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ambassador briefed [PER Buckovski  ] on the upcoming visit by a high-level [LOC US  ] delegation to review [LOC Macedonia  ] 's progress toward meeting its MAP goals . 
She said it would be important for [LOC Macedonia  ] to demonstrate that it was a net contributor to security . 
The country had to convince some skeptical [ORG NATO  ] members that bringing [LOC Macedonia  ] into the [ORG Alliance  ] would not be tantamount to " importing instability . 
" Also , the [ORG GOM  ] would have do more to combat corruption , including better coordination of existing anti-corruption efforts and more aggressive efforts to prosecute high-level corruption cases. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Buckovski  ] agreed that more needed to be done to fight corruption . 
He accepted the need for stronger coordination , and said Foreign Policy Adviser [PER Mersel Biljali  ] was in charge of " finding a methodology " for tackling the problem . 
[PER Buckovski  ] noted his personal ties to both the Public Prosecutor ( " a friend " ) and the Minister of Justice ( a former law student of his ) and even offered personally to head the effort to improve coordination among the various judicial agencies to enhance anti-corruption efforts . 
[ORG ICTY  ] RETURN OF CASES -- REQUEST FOR DELAY <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Responding to the Ambassador 's request for an update on the status of the return of four unindicted cases from the [ORG ICTY  ] to [MISC Macedonian  ] jurisdiction , [PER Buckovski  ] said that Chief Public Prosecutor [PER Prcevski  ] would meet with [ORG ICTY  ] investigators in late February to ask orally for a delay in the return . 
[PER Buckovski  ] did not want a paper trail or any documentation of the request for a delay , since that could later be used by the opposition to attack the government for being soft on the ethnic [MISC Albanians  ] ( all four cases involved eAlbanians alleged to have committed war crimes during the 2001 internal armed conflict . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Buckovski  ] 's information was at odds with FM [PER Mitreva  ] 's report to the [ORG EU  ] Special Representative this week that [PER Prcevski  ] would travel to The [LOC Hague  ] on February 2 to request the delayed return of cases . 
This discrepancy reflects the general lack of coordination on this matter between the Prime Minister , [PER Mitreva  ] , and the President -- the only three [ORG GOM  ] officials with the authority to make decisions regarding the return of cases . 
[PER Buckovski  ] reportedly told the press on February 2 that he expected the return of cases " to coincide with completion of the judicial reforms , " and that the cases likely would be returned " by the end of 2006 . 
" End Comment . 
[ORG KOSOVO FINAL STATUS  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On [LOC Kosovo  ] final status , [PER Buckovski  ] said he could see no other possible outcome but independence . 
He said he agreed with the [LOC US  ] position , that [LOC Kosovo  ] final status should be determined " the sooner , the better " to reduce the potential for future instability in the region . 
As a positive example to [LOC Kosovo  ] and the region of [LOC Macedonia  ] 's multi-ethnic experience , he said , the [ORG GOM  ] planned to host in [LOC Ohrid  ] in August the 5th anniversary commemoration of the signing of the [ORG Ohrid Framework Agreement  ] , which ended the 2001 internal armed conflict in [LOC Macedonia  ] . 
[PER Buckovski  ] said he hoped for high-level representation at the event from those countries and organizations that had signed the original agreement , in particular the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] . 
EL-MASRI: STAY THE COURSE <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NOFORN ) Concerning the case of a [MISC German  ] citizen of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent who has claimed that [MISC Macedonian  ] authorities detained him in January 2004 and handed him over to the [ORG CIA  ] for a rendition flight to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Buckovski  ] noted that the [ORG GOM  ] would stay the course and would continue to support the Minister of Interior , who has declined to discuss the matter with the local press . 
[PER Buckovski  ] was relieved to hear from the Ambassador that we would not shift course , either , and would continue to decline to discuss in public specific cases . 
The Prime Minister suggested that the Ambassador coordinate on the issue with the [MISC German  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [ORG Skopje  ] , suggesting that the [MISC Germans  ] were putting pressure on the [MISC Macedonians  ] to be more forthcoming . 
The Ambassador demurred . 
TRILATERAL MEETING ALONG A-3 LINES [ORG SKOPJE  ] 00000118 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Buckovski  ] mentioned that he was organizing a " trilateral meeting " in [LOC Tirana  ] with his [MISC Albanian  ] and [MISC Croatian  ] counterparts ( mirroring the [ORG Adriatic Partnership  ] ) , and hoped the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador in [LOC Tirana  ] would be able to participate . 
He gave no specifics regarding the objective of the meeting , other than to mention that it would strengthen regional cooperation . 
COMMENT <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Buckovski  ] characterized the dinner as a chance to further strengthen the close cooperation between the [ORG Embassy  ] and his office . 
He pledged " open and frank " communication between his office and the [ORG Embassy  ] , and suggested [LOC Macedonia  ] continues to view the [LOC U.S.  ] as its single most important " strategic partner . 
" [PER Buckovski  ] clearly was eager to get feedback on sensitive issues , and to portray himself as a pragmatic leader who can listen to arguments at odds with his own views , and who is ready to compromise when needed . 
With parliamentary elections likely in summer 2006 and the campaign season about to begin , [PER Buckovski  ] also feels it is necessary to show that he has international community support , especially from the [LOC US  ] , and that his policy stances do not conflict with ours on any high-profile matters .
