Introduction ------------ <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Baku Iran  ] watcher has conducted approximately thirty interviews since the June 12 [MISC Iranian  ] presidential elections with [MISC Iranians  ] ( both [MISC Baku-based  ] and resident in [LOC Iran  ] ) and [MISC Azerbaijani  ] [LOC Iran  ] experts . 
Interviews dealt with reactions to , and analyses of , the election results ; subsequent protests ; protest mechanics ; faction maneuvering ; and/or predicted geopolitical implications . 
Most sources were ordinary [MISC Iranians  ] ( students , business people and professionals ) with involvement in and/or credible knowledge of the matters discussed , and a story to tell . 
The following attempts to summarize the information and insights garnered from these interviews in ways that respond to some of the most frequent questions being raised by [LOC Washington  ] policy makers and analysts . 
While the following incorporates comments from many [MISC Iranian  ] residents , it is ultimately a view from [LOC Baku  ] , with all of the advantages and limitations of distance that this suggests . 
The aim of this cable is to assist in assembling the larger post-election [MISC Iranian  ] jigsaw puzzle together by putting a view of many of the pieces in one place . 
End Introduction. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Begin Questions and Answers . 
Question #1 . 
How great was [PER Mousavi  ] 's support ? -------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Out of a pre-election survey of about thirty [MISC Iranians  ] , all but three told [LOC Iran  ] watcher that they and most people they knew would support [PER Mousavi  ] . 
Well before the election itself , [ORG Baku Iran  ] watcher repeatedly heard comments from [MISC Iranian  ] sources ( most resident in [LOC Iran  ] ) to the effect that " [PER Mousavi  ] will win the election unless it is stolen " ( see refs B and C ) . 
However , other interlocutors asserted that " [PER Ahmadinejad  ] will be unable to steal the election " if [PER Mousavi  ] won by more than four million votes ) an outcome increasingly predicted as Election Day approached . 
Question #2: Why did the fraud occur ? ------------------------ [PER Answer:  ] ( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Baku  ] interlocutors provide two possibly complementary explanations: Explanation A: " The fraud was a desperate defensive move , in the face of [PER Mousavi  ] 's surge , by Supreme leader [PER Khameini  ] , his son [PER Mojtaba  ] , and their immediate circle . 
" The upshot is that both sides were engaged in a game of political chess in which [PER Khameini  ] 's circle ordered the fraud because it perceived its political survival to be at stake . 
In support of this explanation , an [MISC Iranian  ] academic related that before the election a friend with access to [PER Khameini  ] 's circle told him that [PER Khameini  ] suspected that a [PER Mousavi  ] victory would be followed by the sidelining and/or removal of [PER Khameini  ] by [PER Rafsanjani  ] and [PER Mousavi  ] , due to " illness . 
" The pre-election source added that " while [PER Rafsanjani  ] can possibly remove [PER Khameini  ] , [PER Khameini  ] cannot remove ( the politically entrenched ) [PER Rafsanjani  ] . 
" Explanation [MISC B:  ] " The fraud was organized to protect the vested interests of cliques tied to the [ORG Revolutionary Guard  ] , the [ORG Basiji  ] leadership , and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
" This , more common analysis relegates [PER Khameini  ] to a supporting role , and suggests longer pre-election fraud preparation and planning . 
Since the 2005 election , " second generation " [ORG Revolutionary  ] figures , many [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war [ORG Revolutionary Guard  ] or [ORG Basij  ] veterans , have taken over all security agencies and most lucrative positions within the state and key parastatals . 
The core of this network allegedly planned the fraud well before the election , as a calculated step to permanently consolidate their dominance . 
[ORG BAKU  ] 00000575 002 OF 006 Question #3: Why was reaction so intense ? ---------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Interlocutors cite two reasons for the intense public anger: First , pre-election openness raised hopes for change even among the skeptical . 
The perceived election fraud cynically and brutally dashed these hopes , making people feel like fools . 
Many people felt swindled , and others humiliated because they had actively worked to produce a large voter turnout . 
One of the latter related that he had led twenty people to the ballot box . 
He tearfully asked " how can I face these friends ? 
" Second , the perceived blatancy of the fraud added insult to injury . 
All post-election [LOC Baku  ] watcher interlocutors were angered by the fraud , but many were positively boiling over its crass " in your face " magnitude . 
As one furious contact commented , " they didn't even try to pretend that the count was real " ( e.g. , by making the official results closer ) . 
One interlocutor argued that the fraud 's blatancy was deliberate , designed to send a message to [MISC Iranians  ] that " we are nothing , and should forget about changing anything . 
" Comment: This sense of personal insult maybe central to understanding the staying power of the public protests and continued widespread anger . 
End Comment . 
Question #4: Are the protests broadly-based ? -------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [LOC Tehran  ] was the epicenter , interlocutors ( including some on the scene ) reported large protests over several days in [LOC Kermanshah  ] , [LOC Isfahan  ] , [LOC Rasht  ] , [LOC Karaj  ] , [LOC Shiraz  ] , [LOC Ahwaz  ] , and other cities ( including smaller towns such as Gulshahr and [LOC Najafabad  ] ) . 
Several Tehran-area sources stressed that [LOC Tehran  ] protests were not limited to ( middle and upper class ) [LOC North Tehran  ] , asserting that large numbers of people from [LOC South Tehran  ] also protested , and that there was considerable post-election violence in [MISC South Tehran  ] . 
[ORG Baku Iran  ] watcher has heard no reports of significant rural protest activity . 
Question #5: Why weren't protests larger in [LOC Tabriz  ] ? -------------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( C ) Public protests in [LOC Tabriz  ] were relatively less intense and frequent than some expected , given [PER Mousavi  ] 's [MISC Azerbaijani  ] nationality , and [LOC Tabriz  ] , long history as a center for protest activities . 
Four [LOC Tabriz  ] interlocutors explained this by claiming that many [MISC Azerbaijani  ] cultural nationalists and intellectuals are unenthusiastic about [PER Mousavi  ] personally and diffident toward what they saw as an intra-regime power struggle with little relevance to their most keenly-felt regional interests ( e.g. , recognition of [MISC Azeri  ] as a language of government , authorized use of [MISC Azeri  ] in local schools , teaching of [MISC Azerbaijani  ] culture , etc . 
( S ) Former [LOC Republic of Azerbaijan Ambassador  ] to [LOC Iran  ] [PER Nasib Nasibili  ] , who maintains broad ties to the [MISC Iranian Azeri  ] cultural leadership , told [LOC Iran  ] watcher on July 10 that many [MISC Azeri  ] intellectuals now realized that continuing to maintain this distance from the issue " is probably a mistake . 
" He predicted that [MISC Iranian  ] [MISC Azeri  ] participation in election protests will increase , should these opposition activities continue in [LOC Tehran  ] and elsewhere , but asserted that " the drifting away " of [MISC Iranian  ] [LOC Azerbaijan  ] from the center is likely to continue . 
Question #6: What is the impact of [PER Khameini  ] ? ------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several [LOC Baku  ] interviewees related that they took part in large protest demonstrations until hearing [PER Ayatollah Khameini  ] 's June 19 sermon , and observing the related security build-up . 
All of these ( ranging in age from twenty to sixty-nine ) cited fear of arrest and physical [ORG BAKU  ] 00000575 003 OF 006 violence , not respect for [PER Khameini  ] , as their reason for not marching . 
In the week after the [PER Khameini  ] sermon several contacts predicted that public protest would continue but focus on off-street and passive resistance . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Over the longer term , many [MISC Iranian  ] interlocutors saw the destruction of [PER Khameini  ] 's long-cultivated image as an independent , ethical " father figure , " and fit successor to the [PER Ayatollah Khomeini  ] was the most important impact of his sermon . 
Comments to this effect began coming in within hours of the sermon , and continue to this day . 
As one [MISC Iranian  ] observed , [PER Khameini  ] is now seen as " just another faction leader within the regime . 
" Question #7: What is the impact of [PER Rafsanjani  ] ? --------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( C ) [LOC Baku  ] commentators ( including one who attended the [LOC Tehran  ] Friday prayer service ) dwelled on the " re-galvanizing " effect of [PER Ayatollah Rafsanjani  ] 's July 17 sermon on protesters . 
An [MISC Iranian  ] businessman who is closely following the protests and returned from a ( self-described ) " fact-finding " visit to [LOC Tehran  ] on July 18 noted that the Friday prayer venue was a green light for a massive turnout , and that [PER Mousavi  ] aides had signaled his desire for a large turnout through diverse media ( see item #14 below ) . 
( C ) He added that similar alternative media was used to prepare the prayer attendees -- don't wear green armbands until you get there , assemble peacefully , and chant " the opposite " of whatever regime slogans are recited . 
He claimed to notice an alleged change in mood among the protesters , from a belief that resistance is dwindling , to a renewed confidence and willingness to engage in resistance . 
All contacts praised [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's speech for its barbed nuances and evidence of support for protesters and continued pressure on the regime . 
One commented that " ( [PER Rafsanjani  ] ) showed us that there are still deep splits " in the regime . 
Question #8: What regime cracks have appeared ? --------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( S ) Well-sourced information on this topic is hard to come by . 
A senior figure in the [LOC Melli  ] Mazhab movement told [LOC Baku  ] watcher on July of [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's alleged efforts to replace [PER Khameini  ] with a Council ( " [MISC Shura  ] " ) of religious elders ( ref A ) . 
A wealthy [MISC Iranian  ] businessman who has just returned from [LOC Iran  ] claimed on July 17 that many in the lower and medium levels of the security establishment are also opposed to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , and/or the repression of protests , and are prepared to look the other way to facilitate opposition activities , including ( he claimed ) overlooking sabotage . 
Question #9: Are there splits among the [ORG Basij  ] ? --------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( C ) Two [LOC Tehran  ] sources claimed to know [ORG Basij  ] whom they said were not supportive of [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , however , one of these had nonetheless seen her " anti-Ahmadinejad " [ORG Basij  ] acquaintance repressing post-election protesters . 
The bottom line , sources felt , is that whether for reasons of discipline , brainwashing , or money most [ORG Basij  ] members are reluctant to defy official orders , whatever their purported private opinions may be . 
Question #10: How involved are [MISC Iranian  ] clerics ? --------------------------------- A: ( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Baku Iran  ] watcher contacts , including those resident in [LOC Iran  ] , do not seem to be waiting in anticipation for guidance from the clerical establishment . 
That being said , support from this quarter is regarded as tactically necessary , and is actively welcomed when it emerges ( e.g. , from [MISC Grand Ayatollahs  ] [PER Montazeri  ] and [PER Sanei  ] ) . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some sources have observed that the majority of [MISC Ayatollahs  ] and [MISC Grand Ayatollahs  ] have taken no public position on the election and subsequent protests . 
While most saw this [ORG BAKU  ] 00000575 004 OF 006 as a positive signal , others cynically dismissed it as reflecting an alleged clerical focus on self-preservation , and holding back comment until the smoke clears . 
Question #11: What is [PER Sistani  ] 's position ? --------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( S ) Najaf-based [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] , originally from [LOC Isfahan  ] , reportedly has the largest personal following of any [PER Ayatollah  ] in [LOC Iran  ] . 
A contact close to [PER Sistani  ] 's circle strongly doubted that either [PER Sistani  ] , or his [LOC Qom  ] representative [PER Jamal Shahristani  ] , are participating in the ongoing [MISC Iranian  ] political debate . 
The source , formerly chief of staff to [PER Ayatollah  ] al-Khoei , explicitly dismissed press reports that [PER Shahristani  ] participated in recent meetings of senior [LOC Qom  ] clerics that reportedly discussed post-election political issues . 
( C ) The source emphasized that [PER Sistani  ] is extremely judicious in determining when and how he personally engages in political matters . 
That being said , he speculated that individuals trusted by [PER Sistani  ] , but lower profile than [PER Shahristani  ] , may be actively monitoring the [MISC Iranian  ] situation for him . 
Question #12: What will happen next ? ---------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( C ) Most [MISC Iranian  ] contacts ( some more nervously than others ) admit that they don't know what will happen next ( though one predictedc an anti-Khameini coup led by the [ORG Revolutionary Guard  ] leaders " who will then be allowed to keep all their money . 
" ) . 
At the same time , most thought that widespread resistance ( on and off-street ) will continue , arguing that " there is no going back " to the pre-election tacit acceptance of [PER Khameini  ] 's and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's rule . 
" All our old caution and fear of civil war is gone " insisted one businessman . 
" Both sides hope to wear down the other , " another commentator observed . 
Question #13: What off-street protests will occur ? ------------------------------------ [PER Answer:  ] ( C ) While most interlocutors said that they have stopped participating in public demonstrations , all expressed continued anger and resentment toward the regime , and several added that their friends are still going to rooftops at night to shout " [PER Allah Akbar  ] . 
" Others also claim to be launching green balloons , and flashing their car lights while driving on main streets . 
Two interlocutors asserted that other " passive resistance " and similar strategies will be deployed , including work slowdowns and turning on all power in homes to cause blackouts during [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and [PER Khameini  ] speeches . 
( Note: According to reports , this actually happened in several [MISC Iranian  ] cities including [LOC Tehran  ] during [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's televised July address -- well after the preceding interview . 
End Note ) . 
In an new development , two contacts just returned from [LOC Iran  ] told [LOC Iran  ] watcher on July 20 and 21 separately related that a campaign is underway to boycott [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] consumer products . 
Question #14: Is there a protest " organization " ? ---------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( C ) According to four separate but complementary sources ( one inside [LOC Iran  ] ) , protesters look to [PER Mousavi  ] ( e.g. , his facebook homepage ) for specific guidance on what to do , not a local leadership cadre or organization . 
Sources explained that people communicate information on upcoming protests and strategies by utilizing email networks , land lines , and word of mouth . 
An [MISC Iranian  ] businessman just returned from [LOC Iran  ] explained said that most protest guidance is released by [PER Mousavi  ] aides through known intermediaries several days before the planned event . 
Question #15: How does the word get out ? 
[PER Answer:  ] ( C ) Interlocutors asserted that the use of diverse information media as outlined in item #14 above works [ORG BAKU  ] 00000575 005 OF 006 effectively in getting the latest word out to potential protesters . 
A businessman said that he uses his 120-plus email [MISC Iranian  ] contact list to forward information that he receives , in the expectation that recipients in turn will forward the information to others . 
" After three days , a huge number of people are informed , " he noted . 
A source in [LOC Shiraz  ] said that people without access to internet can usually get information at bus stops , public parks , and in taxis ( often shared by several people ) . 
( Note: Use of Twitter and other internet media by protesting [MISC Iranians  ] has noticeably increased since about July 10 . 
End Note . 
) Question #16: How is the regime responding ? ------------------------------ [PER Answer:  ] ( [ORG SBU  ] ) When pressed , most [LOC Baku  ] contacts assert that the army and most of the [ORG Revolutionary Guard  ] will never fire on election protesters , but no one seems completely sure of this . 
One interlocutor commented that unlike the past , people are not focusing on regime response -- " we are fed up , " he said . 
( S ) Some contacts suggest that the regime may be stripping smaller towns of [ORG Basij  ] and police forces in order to confront the protests in [LOC Iran  ] and other large cities . 
A source from [LOC Gulshahr  ] ( near [LOC Tehran  ] ) described July 11 marches there as proceeding in a peaceful holiday-like atmosphere , with only a handful of police or [ORG Basij  ] to be seen . 
Another source provided a similar picture of July 17 protests in [LOC Najafabad  ] , near [LOC Isfahan  ] . 
Question #17: Are there plans for a General Strike ? ------------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( S ) There are widespread assertions that a General Strike is planned as a " final bullet " against the regime , to be deployed immediately and without further guidance should [PER Mousavi  ] be arrested . 
This was initially heard by [LOC Iran  ] watcher from [MISC Baku-based  ] contacts , but is now also appearing on Twitter . 
A businessman with contacts in the [PER Mousavi  ] camp told [LOC Iran  ] watcher shortly after the election claimed that this strategy originated with [PER Mousavi  ] , whom he said wanted to hold off on a general strike as a last resort , which may be called even if [PER Mousavi  ] is not arrested . 
Question #18: Are there signs of a work slowdown ? ----------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( S ) There are many assertions that work slowdowns are likely , planned , or already occurring , but little evidence . 
An energy sector businessman , described slowdown as an interim step that would increase pressure on the regime short of a general strike . 
This source also predicted that sabotage and work stoppages at oil and other energy facilities will also occur if the regime continues in power . 
( C ) Reports from [LOC Baku  ] and inside-Iran contacts of intermittent bazaar closures and short hours in several cities ( including [LOC Tehran  ] , [LOC Isfahan  ] , [LOC Shiraz  ] , and [LOC Kermanshah  ] ) have recurred since the beginning of the post election period . 
Others have complained that customs clearance and normal truck delivery distribution has been disrupted , negatively affecting their businesses . 
It is still unclear whether some or all of these problems reflect temporary responses to an unsettled situation , bureaucratic disarray , or political protests . 
Question #19: Is the nuclear program affected ? -------------------------------- [PER Answer:  ] ( S ) Former [ORG Azerbaijani Presidential Advisor Vafa Guluzadeh  ] and former GOAJ Ambassador to [LOC Iran  ] [PER Nasib Nasibili  ] separately told [LOC Iran  ] watcher that as a result of post-election developments in [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG Khameini/Ahmadinejad-led Government of Iran  ] will seek to test a nuclear device as soon as possible , i.e. , even before weaponization or delivery systems are ready , has significantly increased . 
[PER Guluzadeh  ] and [PER Nasibili  ] explained that , whatever the original ( probably mixed ) objectives motivating the [MISC Iranian  ] government 's pursuit a bomb , it is [ORG BAKU  ] 00000575 006 OF 006 driven by domestic political objectives , as " the only card ( [PER Khameini  ] and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ) have left to play " to win support from the [MISC Iranian  ] people , and regain some legitimacy . 
( S ) [PER Nasibili  ] pointed out that [PER Ayatollah Khomeini  ] famously used the [MISC Iran-Iraq  ] war to eliminate enemies and consolidate power , and speculated that any ensuing international uproar and pressure would be used in a similar way by [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and [PER Khameini  ] . 
[PER Guluzadeh  ] speculated that the two may believe that even a worst-case scenario would make them into heroic figures . 
( C ) [LOC Baku  ] [MISC Iranians  ] are not knowledgeable about the nuclear program , but several speculated that the current regime will try to do something " dramatic " to regain the initiative: testing a bomb , provoking a war , or faking domestic terrorist attacks are among the possibilities mentioned . 
Question #20: Should the [MISC West  ] still seek dialogue ? ------------------------------------ [PER Answer:  ] ( C ) Former [ORG Presidential Advisor Guluzadeh  ] , formerly a strong supporter of U.S.- [MISC Iranian  ] dialogue " without preconditions " ( ref D ) , told [LOC Iran  ] watcher that recent events have completely changed his thinking on this issue . 
" They have no interest in dialogue with you , or any concessions , you may offer " he said flatly ; " their only interest is their survival . 
" He added that " their only reason for talking to you would be to claim a 'victory' " in front of the [MISC Iranian  ] people , " and to stall you while continuing to do what they want . 
" ( S ) [PER Guluzadeh  ] nonetheless said that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [MISC West  ] must continue to be seen as extending every opportunity to the regime for compromise " in order to show the rest of the world that you have done so , " prior to eventual punitive action . 
[PER Guluzadeh  ] said , the [MISC West  ] should begin planning now for dealing with a defiant , uncompromising , nuclear [MISC Iranian  ] regime -- with a view towards permanently removing this threat .
