( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: In a 4/29 parliamentary briefing on bilateral defense talks earlier in the week , FM [ORG Haarde  ] continued to emphasize that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] governments are moving forward constructively to develop new defense arrangements in preparation for the upcoming closure of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) . 
PM Asgrimsson 's party , the coalition junior partner , continued to distance itself from [ORG Haarde  ] 's " loss " of the base , while opposition members variously expressed impatience with the government 's failure to finalize a post-NASKEF defense plan and called on the government to hold the [LOC U.S.  ] accountable on labor and environmental transition issues. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary continued: We expect these themes to echo during the run-up to the May 2007 parliamentary election . 
If by this time next year we have new defense and security arrangements in place - and have resolved pending base closure legal , financial , and technical issues - we expect the defense issue to move off center stage . 
End summary. ----------------- Government Briefs ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister and [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) Chairman [PER Geir Haarde  ] met with the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Parliament  ] 's ( [ORG Althing  ] 's ) [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] April 29 , following April 26-27 defense negotiations with a joint State-DOD team ( reftel ) . 
[ORG Haarde  ] told his parliamentary colleagues: -- The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] have not finalized a plan to provide for [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense following closure of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) at the end of the fiscal year , and detailed bilateral discussions will continue . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , responsible for [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense , is doing the technical work for the plan . 
-- [LOC Iceland  ] is not now asking any [MISC European  ] country to provide for [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense ; [ORG Haarde  ] is focusing on reaching an agreement with the [LOC U.S.  ] and expects that the ongoing talks will produce such an agreement . 
( Note: in March and April PM Halldor Asgrimsson , chair of the coalition junior partner [ORG Progressive Party  ] , repeatedly suggested that [LOC Iceland  ] look to [LOC Western Europe  ] for defense guarantee . 
End note . 
) -- A recent [MISC French  ] offer to Minister of Justice [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] to increase [MISC French  ] naval patrols of the [ORG North Atlantic  ] is positive news but will not substitute for ideas being discussed with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
-- [LOC Iceland  ] would seek a common document/declaration to be issued at the end of talks that would address the include the [MISC EUCOM-authored  ] defense plan , the status of the 1951 Defense Agreement , cooperation to combat nontraditional threats , and police cooperation. ----------------- Opposition Snipes ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Opposition politicians responded to [ORG Haarde  ] 's briefing with a repetition of themes they have stressed since the March 15 announcement that the [LOC U.S.  ] would realign NASKEF: -- Main opposition [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) : [ORG MP Thorunn Sveinbjarnardottir  ] expressed impatience with the slow pace of defense planning and urged the government to collaborate with [ORG NATO  ] on replacing [LOC U.S.  ] assets . 
( Note: [ORG Haarde  ] had traveled to [LOC Sofia  ] April 27- 28 for the [ORG NATO  ] ministerial , but we are unaware of any sign that he used the opportunity to explore [ORG Alliance  ] alternatives to [MISC EUCOM  ] proposals . 
End note . 
) [ORG MP  ] and former party chairman [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] used an op- ed in the country 's largest circulation newspaper , [ORG Frettabladid  ] , to lambaste [ORG Haarde  ] for failing to secure continued operation of the [MISC IADS  ] radar stations and praise [PER Bjarnason  ] for " put ( ting ) us in the [MISC French  ] sphere of influence . 
" -- Left [MISC Greens  ] ( LG ) : [ORG MP  ] and Party Chairman [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] argued that " instead of sitting and waiting for proposals from the [LOC United States  ] and trying to hang on to some kind of minimal , pseudo-defense capability , the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government should demand of the [LOC United States  ] military and the [ORG U.S. Government  ] that things be left in decent condition here , that the pollution they have caused be cleaned up , and that they accept their responsibilities toward the people who have worked for them . 
" ------------------------------------ [ORG Coalition Partner Keeps its Distance  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Asgrimsson 's [ORG Progressive Party  ] reiterated its disappointment in the manner of the [LOC U.S.  ] departure . 
[ORG MP Magnus Stefansson  ] , deputy chairman of the [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] , remarked that the [LOC U.S.  ] should already have had a follow-on defense plan ready when we decided to close the base . 
He conceded , however , that " the issue is complicated , especially as regards the grounds of the base , and it is not surprising that this will take time . 
" ------- Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Reactions to the latest round of defense talks fall along party lines , where we expect them to remain . 
[ORG Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] asks Icelanders to `stay the course' and trust in the government 's ability to continue to deliver security . 
Asgrimsson 's Progressives seek to distance themselves from [ORG Haarde  ] 's " loss " of the base . 
The [ORG Alliance  ] uses defense as a wedge issue to push its goal of [ORG EU  ] accession . 
The Left [MISC Greens  ] castigate the [LOC U.S.  ] while playing populist and , well , green. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We expect to hear similar themes repeatedly in the run-up to the May 2007 parliamentary elections . 
If by this time next year we have new defense and security arrangements in place - and , equally importantly , have resolved pending [ORG NASKEF  ] transition issues related to land return , residual value , [ORG NATO  ] property and environmental cleanup - we believe the defense issue will move off political center stage .
