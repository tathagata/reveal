( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The directors of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy have traditionally placed [ORG Central America  ] on their periphery . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has a history of peacekeeping in that region and runs a trade surplus , but the GoB has generally not expended a great deal of resources to expand its influence there . 
As part of his hemispheric outreach , however , President [PER Lula da Silva  ] is attempting to improve [LOC Brazil  ] 's ties to the region , building on initiatives undertaken in the latter stages of the previous [PER Cardoso  ] administration . 
End Summary . 
[MISC View From Brasilia  ] ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Julio Espirito Santo  ] and [PER Antonio Carlos Atunes  ] of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's [LOC Mexico  ] , [ORG Central America  ] , and [ORG Caribbean Division  ] ( [ORG DCC  ] ) told [PER Poloff  ] on March 23 that the [ORG Ministry places Central American  ] countries outside of [LOC Brazil  ] 's normal " sphere of influence " because of [LOC Mexico  ] 's proximity and the long-standing [LOC U.S.  ] role . 
President [PER Lula  ] has certainly boosted [LOC Brasilia  ] 's focus on [MISC South American  ] integration , but less so with the rest of [LOC Latin America  ] , according to the two [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] academics have argued that [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) has not cultivated close relations with many of the [ORG Central American  ] leftist parties because of differing formative experiences and base constituencies. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] nonetheless has a history with [ORG Central America  ] that provides a foundation for closer ties . 
[LOC Brazil  ] contributed limited numbers of peacekeepers , monitors , and demining experts in the aftermath of [ORG Central America  ] 's sundry [MISC Cold War  ] insurgencies . 
[LOC Brazil  ] participated in the [ORG UN Inspection Mission  ] in [LOC Guatemala  ] ( [ORG MINGUA  ] ) and provided training to public security forces in the region . 
In addition , [LOC Brasilia  ] donated significant quantities of assistance and forgave [LOC El Salvador  ] 's debt after Hurricane [PER Mitch  ] , the [ORG DCC  ] officials pointed out . 
Besides working with the [ORG Central American  ] countries in [LOC OAS  ] fora , [LOC Brazil  ] has interacted with these nations in the [ORG Rio Group  ] setting , where [ORG Central American  ] countries comprise almost a third of the membership , [PER Espirito Santo  ] said . 
Getting Past the [MISC G-20  ] --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] became the first [MISC Brazilian  ] head of state to travel to the isthmus when he attended a trade conference in [LOC San Jose  ] in 2000 . 
That conference sought to increase ties between Mercosul and the [ORG Central American Free Trade Area  ] ( [ORG CAFTA  ] ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's trade with the region is relatively small , but it involves a significant trade surplus with all the countries . 
For example , [LOC Brazil  ] 's exports to [LOC Honduras  ] in 2000 were valued at more than 31 million dollars , while it imported less than 700,000 dollars worth of [MISC Honduran  ] products. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The seminal event for [LOC Brazil  ] 's future relations with the isthmus was the formation of the [MISC G-20  ] for the [ORG WTO Cancun  ] meeting , [PER Espirito Santo  ] noted . 
He told [PER Poloff  ] that [LOC El Salvador  ] , [LOC Guatemala  ] , and [LOC Costa Rica  ] were charter members along with [LOC Brazil  ] of the [MISC G-20  ] , but [LOC Washington  ] 's " natural leverage " soon spliced off the [ORG Central Americans  ] . 
The [ORG DCC  ] officials underscored that [LOC Brazil  ] has not written off [ORG Central America  ] as a potential partner in trade negotiations after the [MISC G-20  ] experience , but will likely focus on the formal multilateral ( [MISC Mercosul-CAFTA  ] ) exchanges . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will also continue to work with individual countries , as occurred with [LOC Honduras  ] on coffee pricing issues , the [ORG MFA  ] officials added . 
Next Steps ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Atunes  ] concurred with press reports that [LOC Panama  ] is likely to be of the greatest interest to [MISC Brazilian  ] investors and business in the foreseeable future . 
Brazilian/Panamanian trade reportedly increased 43 percent from 2002 to 2003 and [MISC Brazilian  ] construction companies are anxious to participate in [LOC Canal  ] maintenance contracts . 
[PER Espirito Santo  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] has yet to actively engage the [ORG Central American  ] countries on the GoB 's bid for a permanent seat on the [ORG UNSC  ] , but that [LOC Brazil  ] 's past peacekeeping-related activities in the region and planned [ORG PKO  ] contribution in [LOC Haiti  ] will be used as selling points . 
While [LOC Brazil  ] 's approach to foreign policy makes [LOC Costa Rica  ] its most natural partner in multilateral fora , the [ORG DCC  ] officials assessed that President [PER Lula  ] appears to be developing a good relationship with conservative [MISC Guatemalan  ] President [PER Oscar Berger  ] .
