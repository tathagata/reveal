<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L WELLINGTON 000605 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EAP/ANP NSC FOR GREEN , JONES EO 12958 DECL: 07/15/2014 TAGS PGOV , PREL , [ORG PINR  ] , [LOC NZ  ] SUBJECT: [LOC NEW ZEALAND  ] IMPOSES “STRICT CONSTRAINTS” ON DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP WITH [LOC ISRAEL  ] IN WAKE OF SPY SCANDAL Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION , DAVID R. BURNETT FOR REASONS 1 . 
5 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) In an escalating diplomatic row , two [MISC Israeli  ] men were sentenced July 14 by the [ORG High Court of New Zealand  ] to six months in jail on charges of trying to obtain a false [LOC New Zealand  ] passport . 
The [ORG GoNZ  ] has not pursued allegations that the men are agents of [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence agency [ORG Mossad  ] . 
While Prime Minister [PER Helen Clark  ] would not confirm which service employed the men , she noted “if one were to lay espionage charges , one would have to be prepared to offer the kind of evidence in court which our intelligence agencies don’t like coming forward to display . 
We have very strong grounds for believing these are [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence agents.” [MISC Israeli  ] citizens [PER Uriel Zoshe Kelman  ] and [PER Eli Cara  ] were sentenced to six months in jail , and ordered to each make a [MISC NZ$50,000  ] ( [MISC US35,000  ] ) donation to the [ORG Cerebral Palsy Society  ] . 
( Note: In attempting to procure a passport , they had procured the birth certificate of a cerebral palsy sufferer . 
) The light sentence reflected the fact that the two men were not the principal actors in the plot , which was led by [MISC Israeli  ] Zev [PER William Barkan  ] , who has fled [LOC New Zealand  ] and is still wanted . 
[PER Cara  ] and [PER Kelman  ] pled guilty earlier this month to three charges , including attempting to obtain a [LOC New Zealand  ] passport and participating in an organized crime group to obtain a false passport , and faced a maximum sentence of five years . 
The latter charge is a relatively new provision in the [LOC New Zealand  ] Crimes Act , designed to counter transnational crime . 
Fallout - “Strict Constraints” ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Helen Clark  ] suspended high-level contact with [LOC Israel  ] and announced a range of diplomatic sanctions , including placing [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and Trade ( MFAT ) officials under “strict constraints” in their contact with [MISC Israelis  ] . 
[PER Clark  ] justified her actions by stating “the [MISC Israeli  ] agents attempted to demean the integrity of the [LOC New Zealand  ] passport system . 
The [MISC Israeli  ] Government was asked for an explanation and an apology three months ago . 
Neither has been received.” [MISC Israeli  ] Foreign Minister [PER Silvan Shalom  ] responded via radio , saying “we are sorry about this matter . 
It will be dealt with and all will be done to restore [MISC Israel’s  ] long history of good relations with [ORG New Zealand.”  ] [PER Clark  ] refused to accept this informal apology . 
She has announced [LOC New Zealand  ] will continue plans to require [MISC Israeli  ] officials to apply for visas , to postpone all [MISC Israeli  ] consultations this year , and to delay the agrement for a new [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador , resident in [LOC Australia  ] . 
[MISC Israel’s  ] president , [PER Moshe Katsov  ] , was expected to visit [LOC New Zealand  ] in August , but the [ORG GoNZ  ] will likely refuse his request. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a separate , but possibly related incident , a [MISC Jewish  ] cemetery in [LOC Wellington  ] was vandalized July 15 , and headstones were desecrated . 
[PER Clark  ] immediately condemned the attack. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] The [MISC GoNZ’s  ] public reaction is its strongest diplomatic retaliation in 20 years ) since [MISC French  ] spies bombed the [LOC Rainbow Warrior  ] in [LOC Auckland  ] harbor in 1985 . 
Clark’s limitations on diplomatic contact go further than the [ORG GoNZ  ] reaction in 1985 , however , and it was reported that she toughened the language of her response from that put forward by MFAT . 
The [ORG GONZ  ] has little to lose by such stringent action , with limited contact and trade with [LOC Israel  ] , and possibly something to gain in the [MISC Arab  ] world , as the [ORG GoNZ  ] is establishing an Embassy in [LOC Egypt  ] and actively pursuing trade with [MISC Arab  ] states . 
With [MISC Israeli  ] Government officials eager to repair the relationship , and no time limit on the [MISC GoNZ’s  ] restrictions , it is possible the issue may be resolved in six months , when the [PER Cara  ] and [PER Kelman  ] have served their time , and leave the country .
