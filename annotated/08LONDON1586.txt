END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) USG officials met on May 15-16 in [LOC London  ] to discuss the [MISC Iranian  ] banking sector’s activities in the [LOC UK  ] . 
State’s Under Secretary for Economic , Energy and Agricultural Affairs , [PER Reuben Jeffery  ] , Treasury’s Assistant Secretary for Terrorism Finance and [ORG Financial Crime  ] , [PER Patrick O’Brien  ] , and [ORG DCM  ] [PER Richard LeBaron  ] met with the [ORG Financial Services Authority’s  ] ( [ORG FSA  ] ) Chief Executive [PER Hector Sants  ] and Director of [ORG Financial Crime and Intelligence Division  ] [PER Phil Robinson  ] . 
[ORG Federal Reserve Board  ] Governor [PER Kevin Warsh  ] also attended the [ORG FSA  ] meeting . 
[PER O’Brien  ] , accompanied by Treasury’s [PER Colleen Eddy  ] and [PER Michelle Zager  ] , also met separately with [ORG HM Treasury’s  ] ( [ORG HMT  ] ) [PER Stephen Pickford  ] , Managing Director of Finance and International , [PER Patrick Guthrie  ] , [ORG Head of Asset Freezing  ] , [PER Pete Maydon  ] , [ORG Deputy Asset Freezing  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and the [ORG Foreign Office’s  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) [PER Carl Newns  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER Stephen McCormick  ] , [ORG Head of International Organizations Sanctions Team  ] . 
[PER O’Brien  ] and [PER McNerney  ] , accompanied by [PER Eddy  ] , [PER Zager  ] , and State’s [PER Anthony Ruggiero  ] , [PER Matthew Gershwin  ] , [PER Jeffrey Harvey  ] , [PER Pam Tremont  ] , [PER Bart Barbessi  ] and [PER Mark Johnson  ] held Proliferation Finance meetings with the [ORG Foreign Office’s  ] [PER Paul Arkwright  ] , [PER Eleanor Petch  ] and [PER Isabella McRae  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Guthrie  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and [ORG Ministry of Defense’s  ] [PER Catherine Simpson  ] . 
[ORG UK Financial Services Authority  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) U/S [PER Jeffery  ] and [PER A/S O’Brien  ] described the progress made by the international community in putting financial pressure on those individuals and entities involved in [LOC Iran’s  ] nuclear and missile programs . 
[PER Jeffery  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] share the same goal of shutting down [LOC Iran’s  ] proliferation activities , and that our efforts are having a noticeable effect . 
[PER O’Brien  ] explained that [LOC Iran  ] is using state-owned financial institutions - including [ORG Bank Sepah  ] , [ORG Bank Melli and  ] [ORG Bank Saderat  ] - to facilitate its proliferation efforts and support for terrorism , and welcomed the EU’s plan to designate [ORG Bank Melli  ] . 
[PER O’Brien  ] applauded the private sector’s voluntary risk-based analyses which have led them to go beyond legal requirements in avoiding doing business in [LOC Iran  ] . 
These independent decisions are having a noticeable effect on [LOC Iran’s  ] ability to conduct business as usual , he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On the other hand , [PER O’Brien  ] explained that the USG is hearing from public and private sectors around the world that governments are unwilling to get out ahead of [LOC Europe  ] in their interpretation of [ORG UN  ] and [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) -related obligations as they consider additional domestic measures against [MISC Iranian  ] banks . 
In the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] , particularly the [LOC UAE  ] , officials point to their proximity to [LOC Iran  ] as a reason why they can not take a harder line on [MISC Iranian  ] banks than the [MISC Europeans  ] . 
With four [MISC Iranian  ] banks continuing to operate in [LOC London  ] , [PER O’Brien  ] said that [LOC Middle East  ] and [MISC Asian  ] countries are not likely to take any action on its [MISC Iranian  ] banks unless [LOC London  ] moves first . 
If the [LOC UK  ] acted publicly , the [LOC U.S.  ] would be willing to take that message to the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Asia  ] to press for similar action in other jurisdictions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Sants  ] assured that the [ORG FSA  ] takes [ORG UNSCR  ] implementation very seriously and has instituted an intense supervisory [LOC LONDON  ] 00001586 002 OF 004 regime over the [MISC Iranian  ] banks , but the [ORG FSA  ] would need direct evidence of specific actions taken by the [MISC London-based  ] individuals and institutions in order to take additional action against them . 
[PER Sants  ] said , however , that the [ORG FSA  ] cannot reveal the full extent of its actions to the public. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Robinson  ] explained further how the burden rests upon the bank applicant to prove it is a fit and proper entity when applying for a license , but that the burden shifts to the [ORG FSA  ] and [ORG HMT  ] to prove otherwise once a license has been granted . 
The [LOC UK  ] has taken all the evidence provided by the [LOC U.S.  ] and applied it as far as it can legally , but does not have sufficient evidence that it can put in front of a tribunal in taking further action against [ORG Sepah  ] . 
[PER O’Brien  ] acknowledged the independent legal status of the subsidiaries , but urged that the parent’s actions should be relevant to the “fit and proper” analysis applied to a wholly-owned subsidiary . 
[PER O’Brien  ] pointed out that at the time of the [ORG UN  ] designation of [ORG Bank Sepah  ] , the parent and the [LOC London  ] subsidiary shared the same CEO . 
[PER O’Brien  ] encouraged the [ORG FSA  ] to review whether , in light of the [MISC UNSCRs  ] , the parent banks are “fit and proper” enough to maintain subsidiaries in the [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Robinson  ] said the [ORG FSA  ] has “pushed the boundaries” of what it can do in looking at the parent entities in [LOC Tehran  ] , but must prove “intent” of the person transferring the money . 
All the [MISC Iranian  ] banks are “keeping their noses clean” in the [LOC UK  ] , explained [PER Robinson  ] , and the [ORG FSA  ] can only address actions of the [MISC London-based  ] subsidiary. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Robinson  ] observed that [LOC Iran  ] had been effectively cut off from both the USD and the pound sterling , and suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] explore with the [ORG EU  ] the possibility of limiting [LOC Iran’s  ] use of the euro by removing its access to the [MISC European  ] [LOC Central Bank’s  ] settlement mechanism ( known as “TARGET” ) . 
He also mentioned that it might be possible to go after [ORG Saderat  ] based on that bank’s links to [ORG Hizbollah  ] if the [LOC UK  ] were to designate [ORG Hizbollah  ] as a terrorist organization . 
[PER O’Brien  ] stressed that the USG believes there is sufficient evidence of intent on the part of [ORG Sepah  ] , evidenced by its direction to correspondents to remove its name from transactions , and noted that the subsidiary itself is designated under the [MISC UNSCRs  ] . 
Update from [ORG HM Treasury  ] on [ORG UK Action  ] against [MISC Iranian  ] banks --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER O’Brien  ] also raised the symbolic importance of publicizing [LOC UK  ] action on [MISC Iranian  ] banks with [ORG HM Treasury  ] given views heard from [LOC Gulf  ] countries . 
[PER O’Brien  ] commended [MISC European  ] diplomatic leadership in garnering international consensus on financial sanctions , and encouraged more domestic actions - especially from the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
He also prodded HMG to stake out a strong political position on the level of litigation risk they are willing to tolerate , and offered [ORG USG  ] help in brainstorming or sharing [LOC U.S.  ] experiences . 
[PER O’Brien  ] acknowledged that [LOC Europe  ] may be worried about [LOC China  ] and others stepping in to fill the void left by [MISC European  ] companies , but noted that [LOC Iran  ] cannot meet all of its critical infrastructure needs with second-tier technology and will continue to rely on [MISC European  ] and other sources of advanced technology in key sectors of the economy ( e.g. , energy ) . 
[PER Pickford  ] expressed concern that the [LOC UK  ] approach to oversight of [MISC Iranian  ] banks was being misconstrued in the [LOC Gulf  ] , and agreed to consider ways that [ORG HM Treasury  ] - if not the [ORG FSA  ] - could publicize [LOC UK  ] regulatory actions over [MISC Iranian  ] banks in [LOC London.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER O’Brien  ] urged HMG to take the most robust possible interpretation in enforcing [MISC UNSCRs  ] 1737 , 1747 , and 1803’s paragraph 10 which calls for vigilance over all [MISC Iranian  ] banks . 
[PER Pickford  ] assured that the [LOC UK  ] would be vigorous in its implementation of 1803 , but [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cautioned that the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 would not likely give the [LOC UK  ] the room to remove operating licenses from [MISC Iranian  ] banks in [LOC London  ] . 
[PER Pickford  ] explained that the [LOC UK  ] looked at whether it would be more advantageous if the [MISC London-based Iranian  ] banks were branches rather than subsidiaries - as they are currently - and determined that under a branch system , it would be easier to prove the direct link between [LOC Tehran  ] and [LOC London  ] , but harder to prevent funds from flowing back to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
For that reason they have decided to maintain the banks as subsidiaries . 
A branch would be easier to close up quickly , but there would be a greater risk that the money would flow back to [LOC Iran  ] - although under the licensing regime that money should be frozen now. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) On the status of [ORG Bank Sepah  ] , [PER O’Brien  ] noted that over a year has elapsed since [ORG Bank Sepah  ] was sanctioned by [LOC LONDON  ] 00001586 003 OF 004 the [ORG UN  ] , which should be sufficient time to allow for legitimate parties to extract themselves from their business relationships . 
He called on the [LOC UK  ] to intensify its reviews of reserve requirements and the fit and proper nature of the banks to see if additional pressure can be put to bear on [ORG Sepah  ] and the others . 
[PER Pickford  ] said the [LOC UK  ] was winding down [ORG Bank Sepah  ] and trying to prevent money from going to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Guthrie  ] explained that the [LOC UK  ] was licensing a small number of [ORG Bank Sepah’s  ] prior commitments to be fulfilled , but that [ORG HMT  ] denied the majority of transactions . 
Both [ORG HMT  ] and [ORG FSA  ] confirmed that [ORG Sepah  ] has enough deposits to keep it sufficiently capitalized , but [ORG HMT  ] is not permitting [ORG Bank Sepah  ] to acquire new deposits . 
[PER Pickford  ] noted that the recent “hiccups” in the [ORG Bank Sepah  ] licensing process highlighted the need for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] to stay engaged from the beginning of the process. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) HMT’s [PER Guthrie  ] observed that the culture at [ORG FSA  ] has changed over the past six months . 
[ORG FSA  ] previously stressed their political independence , but now seems to understand the full extent of the issue and is stepping up supervision in [LOC London  ] . 
According to [PER Guthrie  ] , [ORG HMT  ] is concerned about disclosure requirements , the strength and classified nature of the evidence being used , and the fit and proper status of the [MISC Iranian  ] parent banks . 
[ORG FSA  ] has reviewed the intelligence provided by the [ORG USG  ] and has brought in Special Counsel to advise them , but are told that the [MISC Iranian  ] parents do not exercise sufficient ownership and control over the [LOC London  ] banks for the [ORG FSA  ] to step in . 
[PER Guthrie  ] said the [LOC UK  ] takes on board the criticism about being too legalistic , but needs to find a balance between protecting its legal framework while still viewing things from the big picture . 
[ORG HMT  ] lawyers are reconsidering their approaches and should have an opinion on how aggressive [ORG HMT  ] can be within a few weeks. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On next steps , [PER Pickford  ] said that one approach is to push the envelope on what [ORG HMT  ] and [ORG FSA  ] can do to make life difficult for the banks . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] U.S.-UK Proliferation Finance Dialogue -------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During the May 16 meeting on proliferation finance , both the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] presented briefings to ensure each side had the most up-to-date information on [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation finance activities . 
[LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] participants also agreed to work together on several next steps: -- Continued and regularized information-sharing between intelligence , financial and diplomatic officials ; -- Cooperation in [ORG FATF  ] , including raising the profile of advisory notices so as to create a greater deterrent effect ; -- Coordination with the [MISC French  ] , [MISC Germans  ] , [MISC Italians  ] to try and move [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 implementation of measures forward ; -- Expand the scope of 1803 measures and include greater participation from other nations ; -- Look towards the next [ORG UNSCR  ] utilizing evidence of financial displacement of activity ; -- Increase diplomatic outreach and coordinate [MISC U.S./UK  ] approach to [LOC Malaysia  ] , [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Indonesia  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , etc . 
-- Hold a secure video conference before August in order to maintain the momentum on these issues . 
Asset Freezing -------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Maydon  ] explained that HMT’s appeal to the [LOC High Court  ] decision on asset-freezing would be heard in mid-June . 
[ORG HMT  ] is preparing a contingency plan which will include legislative solutions , but they have not yet come up with the specifics . 
If they lose the case , HMG will have to move quickly to maintain the current freeze , perhaps by obtaining an interim order . 
The government is also looking at other authorities , such as stepping up police surveillance , Control Orders , or other - undefined - measures to prevent money from leaking out. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) This cable was cleared by [PER U/S Jeffery  ] and [ORG A/S LONDON  ] 00001586 004 OF 004 [PER O’Brien  ] .
