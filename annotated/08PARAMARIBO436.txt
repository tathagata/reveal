( [ORG U  ] ) Summary . 
President [PER Venetiaan  ] 's September 29 State of the [LOC Republic  ] speech made clear that he and his coalition government are finally moving into pre-election mode . 
In the lead-up to the 2010 elections , [PER Venetiaan  ] focused on the government 's plans for development of the interior , and for implementing infrastructure , housing , and school projects . 
Most of the plans mentioned , however , were not new but plans that had been previously announced during his administration . 
While his 2007 speech focused on specific examples of bilateral cooperation , this year [PER Venetiaan  ] stressed multilateral cooperation -- and neglected to make specific mention of even [LOC China  ] or [LOC Cuba  ] as partners . 
As usual , [PER Venetiaan  ] made no direct reference to [LOC Suriname  ] 's partnership with the [LOC United States  ] , although the President did , characteristically , indulge in a passing remark about the current financial crisis , in what used to be the most powerful country on earth . 
End Summary. -------------------------------- MULTILATERAL COOPERATION: NO MENTION OF [LOC CHINA  ] OR THE [LOC U.S  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On September 29 , President [PER Ronald Venetiaan  ] held his annual , constitutionally required State of the [LOC Republic  ] speech at the Parliament . 
Like last year , [PER Venetiaan  ] mentioned the global crises faced by small countries like [LOC Suriname  ] , including natural disasters , food and energy crises , and war . 
Characteristically , the President also indulged in a passing swipe at the [LOC United States  ] , referring to the current financial crisis , in what used to be the most powerful country on earth . 
( [PER Note: This  ] was the only allusion he made to the [LOC United States  ] . 
End Note . 
) [PER Venetiaan  ] said his administration 's policies and [LOC Suriname  ] 's flexibility spared [LOC Suriname  ] from being strongly affected by these crises , but we need to stay vigilant . 
Unlike in previous years , when [PER Venetiaan  ] focused heavily on bilateral cooperation , during this year 's speech he focused more on development based on cooperation with [LOC Suriname  ] 's multilateral partners , specifically referencing the [ORG United Nations  ] , the [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] , the [ORG European Union  ] , and [ORG CARICOM  ] . 
While it is customary for President [PER Venetiaan  ] to avoid mentioning support provided by the [LOC United States  ] in his speeches , it was noticeable that he also did not refer to [LOC Suriname  ] 's partnerships with [LOC China  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , as he had in 2007. ----------------- AMBITIOUS PLANS ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The President 's speech seemed crafted to make clear that his administration is taking citizens' concerns seriously . 
With the 2005 inclusion of the [ORG A-Combination Party  ] in the [ORG New Front  ] plus coalition government , the administration is under increased political pressure from the [ORG Maroon  ] parties and their constituencies to pay attention to the country 's interior . 
In apparent response , [PER Venetiaan  ] mentioned ambitious plans for the interior , such as economic stimulation projects , infrastructure projects in the interior , land rights for [PER Maroons  ] and indigenous peoples , and the building and renovating of schools and boarding schools . 
He also mentioned scheduled road rehabilitation/building along the coastal strip , in both the districts and inwards into the interior. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Since the start of the current administration in 2005 , there has been much controversy and public dissatisfaction regarding the government 's land and housing policies . 
Making big pre-campaign promises , [PER Venetiaan  ] re-announced and went into detailed explanation of government plans to execute an electronic system of land management , build 900 low cost homes in various districts before the end of 2009 , and continue to expand the current low cost housing programs . 
[PER Venetiaan  ] spent several minutes referencing the government 's renewed focus on youth , the country 's Youth Parliament , and sports . 
[LOC Suriname  ] holds the portfolio for Culture , Gender , Youth and Sport within the [ORG CARICOM  ] , and [PER Venetiaan  ] had been criticized after his 2007 speech for not mentioning either the Youth Parliament or policies on youth issues. ----------------- MIXED REACTIONS ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Reactions to the speech were mixed . 
[PER Radjkoemar Randjietsingh  ] , Secretary of the [ORG United Reform Party  ] ( [ORG VHP  ] , coalition member party headed by Vice-President [PER Ramdien Sardjoe  ] ) , praised the government 's prudent monetary policies and claimed the government 's 2009 plans clearly show its long term planning vision . 
The political opposition characterized the speech as nothing new and said it provided no answer to the developmental challenges [LOC Suriname  ] is facing . 
[PER Sham Binda  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Association for Small and Medium-Sized PARAMARIBO  ] 00000436 002 OF 002 Enterprises , noted the absence of government plans for [ORG Public Sector Reform  ] , the lack of policies to stimulate the production sector , and the lack of a policy to mitigate the effects of the rising gas prices on local production. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Comment . 
With general elections only 18 months away and the current low approval ratings for the [PER Venetiaan  ] government , it was very important for the President to use his 2008 State of the [LOC Republic  ] speech to start making re-election campaign promises . 
So he seized the opportunity to announce the government 's plans for housing , land , and education , and to address other issues which have been bottlenecked over the past five years . 
There is nothing new , however , about the announced plans , as most had been previously announced by his administration . 
It is now more important than ever for the government to actually deliver on these promises , as [PER Desi Bouterse  ] 's opposition [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) and its [ORG Mammoth Coalition  ] continue to ramp up for the 2010 elections by making promises , staging rallies , throwing parties , and continually accusing [PER Venetiaan  ] 's administration of inaction . 
Faced with such an aggressive opponent , the President will do well to deliver on the promises he made on September 29 .
