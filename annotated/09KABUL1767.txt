( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
In a series of meetings this week , I discussed with President [PER Karzai  ] a number of issues , including [PER Karzai  ] 's concerns with the future of [LOC US  ] policy on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and his opinions on where [LOC US  ] policy here had failed . 
The meetings were cordial , but raised certain concerns for me about the status of the [MISC US-Afghan  ] relationship , both in the lead up to the election and over the long term , should [PER Karzai  ] win reelection . 
[PER Karzai  ] 's comments reinforce my belief that our relationship must be a two-way partnership of obligations and responsibilities . 
We must also convince [PER Karzai  ] to put his backing behind democratic institutions and professionalized security forces are better equipped to lead [LOC Afghanistan  ] into the future , rather than [PER Karzai  ] 's preference for tribal structures and informal power networks . 
This cable summarizes the content of these four recent meetings , as well as a subsequent conversation with Interior Minister [PER Atmar  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I met with [PER Karzai  ] on four occasions this week: on June 30 with COMISAF Gen. [PER McChrystal  ] and most of [PER Karzai  ] 's national security team , and three times on July 1 , xxxxxxxxxxxx , and finally with [ORG CODEL Ellsworth  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] maintained a calm demeanor throughout , but at several times displayed views that troubled me with their potential implications for [MISC US-Afghan  ] relations . 
I also called on [PER Atmar  ] on July 2 . 
[LOC Kandahar  ] Incident ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At the June 30 meeting with [PER Karzai  ] and his national security advisors , Gen. [PER McChrystal  ] and I briefed [PER Karzai  ] on a June 29 incident in which a [MISC USG-funded  ] , equipped , and mentored paramilitary force attacked a [LOC Kandahar  ] courthouse . 
The incident resulted in the deaths of several [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG National Police  ] officers . 
[PER Karzai  ] had earlier received phone calls from high-level [LOC US  ] officials regretting the incident , so was calm and did not display the type of emotive anger he has shown following civilian casualty incidents . 
In the later one-on-one meeting with me , I reminded [PER Karzai  ] that he had selected and introduced this paramilitary unit 's recruits to the [ORG USG  ] in 2002 , a fact that he had conveniently omitted in larger group settings. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] insisted that units operating outside of the [MISC Afghan  ] armed forces must be brought under the legitimate control of the [MISC Afghan  ] government . 
Gen. [PER McChrystal  ] and I agreed that both counterterrorism paramilitary units and private security companies ( [MISC PSCs  ] ) require more rigorous oversight and be brought under the eventual control of the [MISC Afghan  ] government . 
[MISC PSCs  ] required stronger regulations , yet the government should also adopt more transparent licensing procedures . 
[ORG US Policy  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] declared in all four meetings that he believed the [LOC US  ] was not speaking clearly to [MISC Afghans  ] on its goals in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] contended that in 2002 the [LOC US  ] had stated a clear purpose for being involved in [LOC Afghanistan  ] but had lost its purpose over the past six years . 
As he has in past meetings with us , [PER Karzai  ] either stated his belief in or repeated rumors questioning the [LOC US  ] commitment to a strong partnership with [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] reported [MISC Pakistani  ] intelligence officials had alleged to [MISC Afghan  ] officials that the [LOC US  ] intended to divide [LOC Pakistan  ] and weaken [LOC Afghanistan  ] in order to pursue its fight against terrorist groups . 
At the same time , [PER Karzai  ] accused [LOC Iran  ] of trying to weaken [LOC Afghanistan  ] by supporting the presidential campaign of [PER Abdullah Abdullah  ] in order to promote a decentralization agenda that would strip power from the central government to give to sub-national actors over whom [LOC Iran  ] believed it would have more control . 
Incredulously , [PER Karzai  ] appeared to accept so-called rumors that the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Iran  ] were working together to support [PER Abdullah  ] against him. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I pushed back strongly on this misinformation in the June 30 meeting with [PER Karzai  ] 's national security team , reiterating to [PER Karzai  ] that there was no overt or covert [LOC US  ] program to support any presidential candidate . 
I then asked [PER Karzai  ] if he took me at my word on this issue . 
[PER Karzai  ] , perhaps not wanting to back down in front of his advisors , said that he did not . 
[PER Karzai  ] said the [LOC US  ] had actively encouraged [PER Abdullah  ] , [PER Ashraf Ghani  ] , and [PER Zalmay Khalilzad  ] to run for the presidency . 
At one point [PER Karzai  ] joked that I should " consult my ( above ) buddies " on national security issues . 
I repeated that the [LOC US  ] had no favored candidates in [LOC Kabul  ] 00001767 002 of 003 the race and the formal setting of the meeting was not a proper forum to make such inappropriate comments . 
He was embarrassed and helpfully shifted the conversation to another topic . 
I also urged [PER Karzai  ] to move away from conspiratorial thinking and instead focus on bringing ideas for the future into his campaign . 
Introducing a clear platform now will put him in a better position to move forward if he wins reelection . 
[ORG US Mistakes  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Karzai  ] and I held a one-on-one meeting shortly before meeting [ORG CODEL Ellsworth  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] agreed with my suggestion to make a better effort to present the case for continued and productive [LOC US  ] engagement in his meetings with [ORG USG  ] visitors from [LOC Washington  ] . 
However , as the [ORG CODEL  ] meeting began , [PER Karzai  ] reverted to old form and launched into a familiar review of the many instances where he believed the [LOC US  ] had miscalculated its policies in the region . 
In summary: The [LOC US  ] had failed to formulate an effective post-2001 policy on [LOC Pakistan  ] , had pulled out of southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( particularly [LOC Helmand  ] ) too soon and given too much responsibility to ill-equipped and casualty-averse [ORG NATO  ] allies , had failed to effectively engage with and pay respect to the importance of tribal leaders in [MISC Afghan  ] society , and had allowed tribal leader networks to be decimated by insurgent attacks . 
I spoke up then , observing that I had visited [LOC Helmand  ] several years ago before other [ORG NATO  ] forces took over military operations there and witnessed signs that governance and security were declining under then-Gov . 
Sher [PER Mohammed Akhundzada  ] . 
[PER Atmar  ] on [PER Karzai  ] 's Paranoia ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I told Interior Minister [PER Atmar  ] at our July 2 meeting that with his conspiratorial behavior , [PER Karzai  ] would run the risk of leaving [ORG USG  ] interlocutors with the impression that we have accomplished very little here and that the [MISC Afghan  ] government believed most of the failures lay with us . 
This is not a dialogue that will lead to an effective partnership . 
The [LOC US  ] has been clear in its past shortcomings in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but we have yet to see [PER Karzai  ] admit to the serious shortcomings in his administration. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Atmar  ] agreed with the importance of [PER Karzai  ] presenting himself as a better international partner . 
He also detailed three existing paranoias that affected [PER Karzai  ] 's worldview: ( 1 ) [PER Karzai  ] did not understand [LOC US  ] policy in the region and suspected ulterior motives in our relationship with neighboring countries ; ( 2 ) he suspected the [LOC US  ] was contemplating a short-term strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that would result in our disengagement within the next two years ; and ( 3 ) the [LOC US  ] was intent on dumping [PER Karzai  ] and supporting another candidate . 
A fourth emerging paranoia was of a [LOC US  ] plot to divide and weaken [PER Pashtuns  ] on both sides of the [MISC Afghan-Pakistani  ] border . 
Despite these paranoias , [PER Atmar  ] assured me that [PER Karzai  ] had confidence in his personal relationship with me and recognized the need to meet more frequently to work through his misperceptions of [LOC US  ] policy and intentions . 
Our Relationship with [PER Karzai  ] ---------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In these meetings and other recent encounters with [PER Karzai  ] , two contrasting portraits emerge . 
The first is of a paranoid and weak individual unfamiliar with the basics of nation building and overly self-conscious that his time in the spotlight of glowing reviews from the international community has passed . 
The other is that of an ever-shrewd politician who sees himself as a nationalist hero who can save the country from being divided by the decentralization-focused agenda of [PER Abdullah  ] , other political rivals , neighboring countries , and the [LOC US  ] . 
In order to recalibrate our relationship with [PER Karzai  ] , we must deal with and challenge both of these personalities. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The danger of long-term damage to our relationship with and thus our influence over [PER Karzai  ] ) who for now is the clear favorite to win the election ) is real , but not irreversible . 
We need to carefully ensure that the distance between us and [PER Karzai  ] does not grow over the remaining weeks before the election . 
[PER Karzai  ] has invited me for a series of one-on-one meetings in the near future . 
According to [PER Atmar  ] , [PER Karzai  ] recognizes the importance of a closer dialogue . 
I will use this opportunity and others to re-focus our dialogue on several points that can improve our mutual understanding , including: <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We need to seriously examine the issue of armed groups that currently operate outside of the purview of [LOC Kabul  ] 00001767 003 of 003 official [MISC Afghan  ] government control . 
The activities of paramilitary units and [MISC PSCs  ] , combined with civilian casualties , night searches , and others issues related to the presence of foreign forces , play into the manifestation of [LOC Afghans'  ] anger that they are not in control of their own country . 
[PER Karzai  ] claims only to be a vessel for his peoples' anger . 
All hubris aside , he is expressing a legitimate concern of his constituents . 
These problems will be a barrier to moving forward in other areas of our relationship until we have properly addressed them. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At the same time , we must convince [PER Karzai  ] that the [MISC US-Afghan  ] relationship is a two-way street of obligations and responsibilities . 
While we accept our own responsibilities , [PER Karzai  ] must accept and act on our expectation that he elucidate a clear vision for how he intends to lead [LOC Afghanistan  ] over the next five years in a way that encourages democratization , promotes economic development , and recognizes the poisonous effects corruption has had on his government 's ability to win the trust and respect of its people . 
If reelected , it is my hope that a [PER Karzai  ] who no longer needs to run for reelection will be better positioned and in a healthier frame of mind to pursue this agenda , as well as a meaningful national reconciliation. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) I will work now to lay the foundation for improved trust and advances on the two key themes outlined above . 
I will work in tandem with Gen. [PER McChrystal  ] on both of these fronts . 
On the discussion of shared responsibilities , I will begin a frank , collaborative ( and perhaps , at times , confrontational ) dialogue with [PER Karzai  ] . 
No alternative approach is now evident . 
[PER Karzai  ] 's current vision for [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's future relies too strongly on warlords , tribal chiefs , and other personalities of the past who would be difficult to reconcile with our commitments to build strong government institutions and professional security forces .
