C ) [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00021 Classified By: E/Pol Counselor [PER Juan A. Alsace  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b & d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) Interior Minister [PER Perez Yoma  ] told the Ambassador February 6 that he is concerned about the potential radicalization of [LOC Chile  ] 's indigenous population , including funding from foreign terrorist groups and/or [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] would like to draw on [LOC U.S.  ] experience in addressing indigenous issues . 
[PER Perez Yoma  ] said U.S.-Chile cooperation on security matters is excellent but would like his Ministry to serve as a central clearinghouse for coordination between the various [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOC  ] agencies , including training and information sharing . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Simons  ] paid a courtesy call February 6 on new Minister of Interior [PER Edmundo Perez Yoma  ] , who took office January 6 , as part of President [PER Bachelet  ] 's third cabinet change ( ref C ) . 
The Ambassador was accompanied by E/Pol Counselor , RAO Chief , [PER Legatt  ] , and Acting DEA Chief. ------------- I 'm In Charge ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After exchange of pleasantries - [PER Perez Yoma  ] was curious about the previous day 's [LOC U.S  ] . 
" Super Tuesday " electoral results and appreciated the Ambassador 's readout - the Minister agreed with Ambassador 's assessment that the bilateral security relationship is excellent . 
He preferred , however , to have his Ministry " more fully informed " concerning the nature and scope of programs offered to [MISC Chilean  ] police and security organs by individual [ORG USG  ] agencies . 
[PER Perez Yoma  ] stressed he did not seek to impede direct contacts between [ORG USG  ] agencies and the national police ( [ORG Carabineros  ] ) or investigative police ( [ORG Policia  ] de [ORG Investigaciones  ] de [LOC Chile  ] ) , both of which fall under Interior 's operative and administrative control , but that top levels of Interior should be apprised to better ensure [ORG GOC  ] coordination . 
The [ORG Carabineros  ] , for example , will sometimes " act independently , " [PER Perez Yoma  ] said , implying that if Interior has a global view of [ORG USG  ] programming with the [ORG Carabineros  ] and other [ORG GOC  ] security organs , he would be better able to ensure all are working from the same page . 
He suggested he and the Ambassador talk regularly ; " our objectives are 100 percent the same as yours . 
" The Ambassador agreed , adding that [ORG USG  ] training programs , coordination with [ORG GOC  ] security organs , and sharing of information are both effective and purposefully low-key. -------------------------------------- Indigenous Radicals Funded Externally ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) As had [ORG Secretariat General of the Presidency  ] Minister [PER Viera-Gallo  ] the week before ( ref A ) , [PER Perez Yoma  ] raised with the Ambassador [ORG GOC  ] concern with the " [MISC Mapuche  ] issue , " [LOC Chile  ] 's largest indigenous group and one that has over the past several months seemingly taken a turn to radical and sometimes violent action ( ref B ) . 
While intelligence is unclear , funding of the [MISC Mapuche  ] by the [ORG FARC  ] " and [PER Chavez  ] " is possible although , he noted , he wasn't sure some of the monies aren't being funneled off to other activities since [MISC Mapuche  ] radicals remain " weak and disorganized . 
" Potential [MISC Mapuche  ] ties to [ORG ETA  ] are also possible . 
" I would like , " he said , " your help in following the money . 
" RAO Chief noted his agency is working with [MISC Chilean  ] colleagues to identify [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ETA  ] actors outside [LOC Chile  ] who might have potential links to [MISC Mapuche  ] radicals . 
[PER Legatt  ] added that the [ORG FBI  ] is coordinating with the [ORG Carabineros  ] to assist in identification and potential prosecution of actors within [LOC Chile.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Perez Yoma  ] said he would appreciate drawing on the broader experience of [ORG USG  ] experts on indigenous issues . 
E/Pol Counselor replied the [MISC Embassy  ] is currently coordinating internally on how to best provide assistance to the [ORG GOC  ] . 
Besides intelligence sharing , we are considering how to use public diplomacy assets . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has experience at both national and state levels on the integration of indigenous peoples into the broader [LOC U.S.  ] society . 
We want to identify and share with the [ORG GOC  ] what has and hasn't worked for us . 
[PER Perez Yoma  ] suggested the [MISC Embassy  ] work closely with Deputy Secretary [PER Felipe Harboe  ] on this issue . 
( Note: [MISC Embassy  ] has [ORG SIPDIS  ] an excellent working relationship with [PER Harboe  ] on other law enforcement issues . 
) ------- Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Perez Yoma  ] was reportedly brought on as seasoned political operator intended to bring discipline and focus to [PER Bachelet  ] 's sometimes unruly administration . 
As Interior Minister he directs cabinet meetings when [PER Bachelet  ] is not present ; press reports suggest he used his first meeting to hammer home the message he is in charge . 
He was all business in this initial call and very clearly concerned that the [MISC Mapuche  ] issue has the potential to underscore [PER Bachelet  ] 's perceived weakness on public security , an issue that falls squarely within his bailiwick . 
End comment .
