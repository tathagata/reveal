( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Chile  ] 's president-elect , [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] , is a savvy , Harvard-educated billionaire and former senator known to work seven days a week . 
Although described by some international press as " right wing " and sometimes compared to [LOC Italy  ] 's scandal-prone [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] , neither is accurate . 
[PER Pinera  ] is an anti-Pinochet centrist who will be challenged to satisfy his broad [ORG Alianza  ] coalition which spans from the center to the far right . 
He has pushed the envelope in his political and business dealings in the past , but is now moving his substantial investments into blind trusts to avoid conflicts of interest . 
His unquestioned devotion to his wife of 30-plus years and his [MISC Catholic  ] faith provide little fodder for personal scandal .

After making a small fortune as a financial advisor , [PER Pinera  ] started [LOC Tolten  ] , a homebuilding business .

[ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000025 002 OF 004 Pining for the [ORG Presidency: Fourth Time  ] 's a Charm --------------------------------------------- -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pinera  ] 's political career began with his campaign for senator in eastern [LOC Santiago  ] in 1989 as an independent supporting the center-right [ORG National Renewal party  ] ( [ORG RN  ] ) . 
After winning the election , he officially aligned himself with the party . 
During his eight years as senator , [PER Pinera  ] gained the respect of his colleagues for his work on a variety of issues , including on the [ORG Senate Finance Committee  ] . 
In a vote of his peers , [PER Pinera  ] was chosen as one of the two best senators for the period of 1990-1998 . 
He did not run for reelection . 
[PER Pinera  ] became president of the [ORG National Renewal  ] party in 2001 and successfully shifted the party towards the center during his mandate. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Leading [LOC Chile  ] has long been [PER Pinera  ] 's dream . 
His first attempt , in 1992 , ended prematurely when a secretly recorded phone call was released showing him colluding with a journalist to undermine his rival , [PER Evelyn Matthei  ] ( Ref B ) . 
He was [ORG RN  ] 's presidential pre-candidate in 1999 but stepped aside so his [ORG Alianza  ] coalition counterpart , [PER Joaquin Lavin  ] of the [ORG Independent Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG UDI  ] ) , could run unhindered . 
( [PER Lavin  ] lost to [PER Ricardo Lagos  ] by a small margin in the runoff . 
) In 2005 , [PER Pinera  ] decided to run as [ORG RN  ] 's presidential candidate , splitting the [ORG Alianza  ] coalition , as [PER Lavin  ] was running again as the [ORG UDI  ] candidate . 
[PER Pinera  ] edged out [PER Lavin  ] in the first round -- generating resentment in the [ORG UDI  ] -- but then lost by seven percentage points to the Concertacion coalition 's [PER Michelle Bachelet  ] in the runoff . 
After his loss , [PER Pinera  ] quickly shifted his sights to the 2009 presidential campaign . 
Where Do [PER Pinera  ] 's [ORG Loyalies Lie  ] ? 
With the Center , Center-right , or Right ? --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Growing up in a [MISC Christian Democrat  ] family--his father was one of the party 's founders--influenced [PER Pinera  ] 's early political leanings .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Pinera  ] has an uneasy relationship with [ORG Alianza  ] coalition members from the far right .

More recently , his outspoken criticism of [PER Pinochet  ] , support for civil unions for gay couples , and backing of the day-after contraceptive pill have made [LOC Chile  ] 's far right uncomfortable . 
In an effort to appease the far right , [PER Pinera  ] gave a speech during his campaign to a large group of retired military , promising to bring an end to " eternally " pending human rights abuse [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000025 003 OF 004 cases against the military. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Throughout his campaign , [PER Pinera  ] billed himself as a centrist and promised to continue many of President [PER Bachelet  ] 's popular social policies . 
Since his victory , he has promised to work with the outgoing Concertacion government for a smooth transition . 
Advisors [PER Rodrigo Hinzpeter  ] and [PER Cristian Larroulet  ] recently had their first meeting with outgoing Interior Minister [PER Edmundo Perez Yoma  ] . 
Analysts are anxiously awaiting the announcement of [PER Pinera  ] 's cabinet -- scheduled to be announced in February -- and whether or not he will include former [MISC Pinochet-era  ] officials in high level government positions . 
No Stranger to Scandal ------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .

In 2007 , he paid a USD 700,000 fine to [LOC Chile  ] 's equivalent of the [ORG Securities and Exchange Commission  ] for insider trading but never admitted culpability .

( C ) As a presidential candidate , [PER Pinera  ] tried to eschew his billionaire image and show his human side . 
He campaigned tirelessly around [LOC Chile  ] , calling himself the " locomotive , " and he embraced new social networking technology like [ORG Facebook  ] and [ORG Twitter  ] . 
Despite his efforts to cultivate a " man of the people " image , he surrounds himself with elite businessmen and academics [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000025 004 OF 004 and continues to pilot his private helicopter to his vacation homes .

Comment ------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Pinera  ] , a highly educated and wildly successful businessman , brings a substantial change to [LOC Chile  ] after 20 years of Concertacion rule . 
Intelligent , hard-working , and determined , [PER Pinera  ] will be a hands-on president .
