End Summary . 
[ORG ISLAMIC TERRORISM  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Secretary [PER Camacho  ] began by emphasizing the importance of interchanges with the [LOC U.S.  ] for [LOC Spain  ] 's security . 
In response to the Deputy Secretary 's question about lessons learned from the January 19 arrest of suspected terrorists in [LOC Barcelona  ] , [PER Camacho  ] noted that [LOC Spain  ] had detained over 300 [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists in recent years . 
He said the operation had reinforced the value of exchanging information as quickly as possible . 
He noted that the operation had been carried out by the [ORG Guardia Civil  ] but with information from the intelligence services and from third countries . 
He noted problems of coordination of services within [LOC Spain  ] and from other countries . 
Deputy Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] praised the [MISC GOS'  ] expertise in disrupting [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] cells operating in [LOC Maghreb  ] countries and linked to [LOC Europe  ] . 
He asked whether we could do more together , such as joint recommendations for [ORG UNSCR  ] 1267 designations . 
[PER Camacho  ] said the [MISC Spanish  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] services shared information , that his meeting with the head of the [ORG National Counterterrorism Center  ] had been valuable , and that [LOC Spain  ] was willing to consider any formula that would lead to faster exchange of information and breaking old habits. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Camacho  ] said terrorists from the [LOC Maghreb  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Iraq  ] all were present in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He believed [LOC Spain  ] had detained more terrorists than any other [MISC European  ] country . 
He said the [ORG GOS  ] regularly told the [ORG USG  ] and other partners about the danger posed by [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] in the [LOC Maghreb  ] . 
He said [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Tunisia  ] , and [LOC Mauritania  ] all were affected and that the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] governments each had good relations with the governments of the four countries . 
[LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] , [LOC Spain  ] 's two enclaves on the [MISC North African  ] mainland , also were threatened . 
He lamented the failure of northern [LOC Europe  ] to clearly understand the threat . 
He said that [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] was always referring to recovering " al-Andalus , " ( the [MISC Arabic  ] name for the [MISC Iberian  ] territory the [MISC Arabs  ] had held for hundreds of years ) . 
[PER Camacho  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was directly menaced by [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and that [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] needed to work together to deal with this threat now in order not to have a greater problem later . 
He added that [LOC Maghreb  ] radicalization was not only a [MISC European  ] problem , as terrorists crossed borders easily to plan attacks in one country and carry them out in another . 
[ORG TERRORISM FINANCE  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Deputy Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] noted that the financial system also was interconnected and that terrorists and weapons proliferators were looking for the weakest points in the system . 
[PER Camacho  ] said that [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist financing was very complicated and unique , adding that many of [LOC Spain  ] 's terrorism-related detentions were for financial actions such as funding the travel of mujaheddin to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG Guardia Civil  ] had stepped up its analysis of [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism financing , leading to better operations against cells . 
The Deputy Secretary noted that the Director of the [ORG U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  ] would visit [LOC Spain  ] in April and that the [ORG GOS  ] should ask him for anything they needed , though he thought information exchange through existing channels was good . 
In response , [PER Camacho  ] suggested the creation of a task force to work together , going beyond the traditional practice of exchanging information but working separately . 
The Deputy Secretary promised to discuss the idea with the [MISC Embassy  ] and in [LOC Washington  ] . 
DESIGNATIONS ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary asked about the status of designations of [PER Eddin Barrakat Yarkas  ] and [PER Driss Chebli  ] . 
[PER Camacho  ] noted that [PER Yarkas  ] had been in jail since 2001 and had been convicted in 2006 for his role in the September 11 attacks . 
He said the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] had passed information to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] to be used in [ORG UNSC  ] designation . 
He said the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] was working on this effort but that it had not yet been completed . 
[PER Camacho  ] said [PER Chebli  ] had been acquitted , implying that this was the reason he was not the subject of any [MISC Spanish  ] designation effort . 
IRAN/BANKING ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary asked how the [ORG EU  ] would implement [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 in [LOC Brussels  ] and at the member state level . 
He noted that it named two new banks , [ORG Bank Saderat and  ] [ORG Bank Melli  ] , as warranting particular vigilance . 
[PER Camacho  ] said [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Financial Intelligence Unit  ] , [ORG SEPBLAC  ] , had investigated [ORG Bank Saderat  ] . 
He thought both [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Spain  ] were aware of the risks of [LOC Iran  ] and its ongoing experiments and that [LOC Europe  ] would take all necessary measures . 
The Deputy Secretary noted that [LOC Iran  ] was a state sponsor of terrorism with budget line items that supported [MISC Middle Eastern  ] terrorist groups that also had activities in [LOC Europe  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , and elsewhere . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] 's central bank , [ORG Bank Markazi  ] , coordinated the involvement by state-owned banks in illicit activities . 
The [ORG USG  ] had shared information showing that [ORG Saderat  ] funded [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] terrorism in [LOC Lebanon  ] via [LOC London  ] . 
[LOC Sepah  ] , [LOC Melli  ] , and [MISC Mellat  ] were funding the weapons proliferation program and missile delivery systems . 
The previous week the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] , and that week the [ORG UNSC  ] , had said to be careful with any [MISC Iranian  ] bank , especially Banks [LOC Melli  ] and [ORG Saderat  ] . 
The [ORG UNSCR  ] had called on member states to exercise vigilance over export credit programs to avoid contributing to [MISC Iranian  ] acquisition of nuclear missile systems. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Deputy Secretary told [PER Camacho  ] that he had informed the [ORG Central Bank  ] and the [ORG Economy Ministry  ] ( see septels ) that two [MISC Spanish  ] banks , [ORG Santander  ] and [ORG Sabadell  ] , maintained correspondent relationships with [MISC Iranian  ] banks . 
He noted that in [LOC Iran  ] it was almost impossible to know your customer and said that the [MISC Iranians  ] were using unwitting banks for proliferation-related transactions . 
[PER Camacho  ] noted that the [MISC Spanish  ] banks had a long tradition of cooperation with the government 's financial intelligence unit , [ORG SEPBLAC  ] . 
[ORG Santander  ] , [LOC Spain  ] 's most important bank , always was credited with good cooperation . 
This was not just an issue of banks being potentially used by [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists ; [LOC Spain  ] had a long history of domestic [ORG ETA  ] terrorists seeking to use [MISC Spanish  ] banks . 
He had no doubt that [ORG Santander  ] would end any suspicious operation that it found without the need for [ORG GOS  ] involvement . 
He encouraged the [ORG USG  ] to send any information that [ORG SEPBLAC  ] could use , and he asked for more information on the types of operations that should require special care . 
Deputy Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] acknowledged that the [MISC Spanish  ] banks had a good reputation in the [LOC U.S.  ] but said his concern was not about their policy or compliance . 
He said the only way to avoid the possibility of being misled by [LOC Iran  ] was to end these relationships . 
[MISC British  ] , [MISC French  ] , and [MISC German  ] banks had ended correspondent relationships , and the [MISC Iranian  ] banks had moved southwards to [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , and [LOC Switzerland.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) This message was cleared by Deputy Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] .
