( [ORG SBU  ] ) " We love you a lot , Mr. [PER Zapatero  ] , but we love [LOC Catalonia  ] even more , " declared [ORG Generalitat  ] and [ORG PSC  ] president [ORG Jose  ] at the close of the [ORG PSC  ] eleventh party congress . 
For the [ORG PSC  ] , [PER Montilla  ] 's words were especially poignant , a sign that their responsibilities of governing [LOC Catalonia  ] would take some priority over supporting their co-religionists in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
Substantial policy differences between the [ORG PSC  ] and the [ORG PSOE  ] also emerged as the [MISC Catalans  ] refused to follow [ORG PSOE  ] 's sharp turn to the left . 
This new push to claim the center reflects the unusual electoral situation for the [ORG PSC  ] , which does not battle for votes with the [ORG Popular Party of Catalonia  ] ( [ORG PPC  ] ) , but with nationalist , center-right coalition [ORG Convergence and Union  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] ) . 
At their party convention the [MISC Democratic Convergence of Catalonia  ] ( [ORG CDC  ] ) , the majority party of [ORG CiU  ] , emphasized a " big tent " form of nationalism that seeks to welcome the entire nationalist spectrum , from moderates who favor the status quo to those who favor outright independence . 
The [MISC Republican  ] Left ( [ORG ERC  ] ) , the other independence party , one of [ORG PSC  ] 's coalition partners in the tripartite government ( Govern ) , attempted to address why it has lost so many votes since 2006 . 
The ultimate winner of a four-way presidential race ran on a " stay the course " platform , but with a bare plurality , new president [PER Joan Puigcercos  ] will not lead with a mandate and will have to carefully balance the demands of the [ORG ERC  ] 's partners and his intra-party critics . 
The convention of the [ORG PPC  ] ( [ORG PPC  ] ) was extremely contentious , as their newly-elected president was practically forced upon them by the national leadership . 
The [ORG PPC  ] 's major problem is that many [MISC Catalans  ] perceive them to be actively undermining [LOC Catalonia  ] 's interests , hardly a winning strategy in a region with a strong national spirit. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [MISC Catalan  ] parties used the summer to sort out internal issues and re-position themselves vis-a-vis each other , this fall will see them work together to some degree to wrest even more autonomy from [LOC Madrid  ] . 
First , the [MISC PSOE-led Spanish  ] government and the [MISC PSC-led  ] [ORG Generalitat  ] are negotiating the terms of a new system for financing the [MISC Catalan  ] government . 
[LOC Catalonia  ] regularly provides more revenue to the central government than it receives in services ; thus , all the parties except for the [ORG PPC  ] , are in favor of receiving more money from the central government . 
The other point of contention continues to be implementation of the [ORG Estatut  ] ( [ORG Statute  ] ) governing relations between [LOC Catalonia  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] . 
Approved via referendum in 2006 , the [ORG Estatut  ] granted increased powers to the [ORG Generalitat  ] , including its own police force . 
It was , however , immediately challenged in the [ORG Constitutional Tribunal  ] ( [ORG TC  ] ) , [LOC Spain  ] 's highest constitutional authority . 
The [ORG TC  ] is expected to issue a final ruling on the [ORG Estatut  ] this fall . 
In their conventions , the parties called on the [ORG TC  ] to keep the [ORG Estatut  ] intact , though they have not outlined concrete plans in the event it receives a negative ruling . 
END SUMMARY PSC: [LOC Catalonia  ] First <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At its party congress this summer , the [ORG Socialist Party of Catalonia  ] ( [ORG PSC  ] ) , long accused by the nationalist parties of putting [ORG PSOE  ] ahead of [LOC Catalonia  ] , struck an independent tone from [ORG PSOE  ] in hopes of shoring up support . 
On the ideological front , the [ORG PSC  ] 's centrist move was mainly intended to seize the center from [ORG CiU  ] . 
In their platform , the [ORG PSC  ] did not call for wider access to abortion , support for euthanasia , nor removal of religious symbols from official ceremonies and schools , which were all moves [ORG PSOE  ] made just weeks before . 
However , this was not just a political move , as historically the [ORG PSC  ] has had a less confrontational attitude with the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in [LOC Catalonia  ] than [ORG PSOE  ] does with the wider [MISC Spanish  ] Church . 
This difference is attributed to the close relationship the [MISC Catalan  ] Socialists have with the progressive sections of the [MISC Catalan  ] Church , which date back to the [MISC Franco  ] era , as well as the overall reputation for moderation that the [MISC Catalan  ] bishops have . 
While the [ORG PSC  ] 's newfound moderate attitude is an important development for the party , more surprising is its more confrontational stance with [ORG PSOE  ] . 
Vowing that they would aggressively pursue a fairer financing scheme for [LOC Catalonia  ] , the [ORG PSC  ] seeks to neutralize one of [ORG CiU  ] 's most effective weapons against them . 
At the same time , however , the [ORG PSC  ] realizes that they must balance demands from [ORG PSOE  ] and [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
Although the [ORG PSC  ] is technically an independent party , it has sat with [ORG PSOE  ] in the same parliamentary group in the [ORG Congress  ] of Deputies . 
While some sections of the party seek for it to have its own group , the leadership realizes that this , and other 's eparatist' actions can damage both parties . 
If [ORG PSC  ] completely breaks away , [ORG PSOE  ] would have to form a [MISC Catalan  ] federation of its own , the way it operates in the rest of [LOC Spain  ] , and something it has not had since 1978 . 
This would most likely lead to the defeat of both parties at the national and regional levels . 
Thus , the [ORG PSC  ] seeks [ORG BARCELONA  ] 00000076 002.2 OF 003 balance in order to maintain power both in [LOC Catalonia  ] , and with [ORG PSOE  ] in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
ERC: Where Do We [MISC Go From Here  ] ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The leftist , independence party , the [ORG ERC  ] scored surprising electoral victories in the early part of the decade , enabling it to join the [MISC PSC-led  ] coalition in the [MISC Govern  ] in 2003 and 2006 . 
Since then , however , the [ORG ERC  ] has suffered a large drop in votes , going from 8 seats to 3 in the [ORG Congress  ] of Deputies after the March 2008 elections . 
After this defeat , party president , [PER Josep Lluis Carod Rovira  ] resigned that office , though he remained Vice President of the [ORG Generalitat  ] . 
The internal struggle to replace him was a proxy battle over the future direction of a party seeking to regain its popularity. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A bitter 4-way race for the top two party positions , evolved , pitting two " stay-the-course " tickets against two " new direction " tickets . 
The winners , [PER Joan Puigcercos  ] for president and [PER Joan Ridao  ] for general secretary , won on a platform to largely continue the party 's current policies , albeit their low share of the rank-and-file 's vote ( 37.2% and 37.5% respectively ) was not a solid endorsement of their views . 
Indeed , the presidential runner-up , [PER Joan Carretero  ] , campaigned as a harsh critic of both [ORG Carod  ] and Puigcercos' policies , especially in regards to the party 's relation with the [ORG PSC  ] . 
Many in the [ORG ERC  ] feel the Socialists compromised too much with [LOC Madrid  ] over the [ORG Estatut  ] , so much so that the [ORG ERC  ] called for a 'no' vote on the referendum . 
In dealing with these critical factions , [PER Puigcercos  ] has vowed to mark three lines the [MISC Govern  ] cannot cross without losing the [ORG ERC  ] 's support . 
These are: unwavering support for the current [ORG Estatut  ] ; promotion of [MISC Catalan  ] language and culture , including having [LOC Catalonia  ] 's 1= million new arrivals learn [MISC Catalan  ] ; and a new finance regime that allocates more tax revenue for [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
To further appease intra-party critics , [PER Puigcercos  ] said he will ask President [PER Montilla  ] for a formal meeting between the tripartite partners to " evaluate the accomplishments " of the coalition . 
It is clear that [PER Puigcercos  ] will have to carefully balance the demands from both his coalition partners and critics inside the party . 
Failure to do so could lead to the dissolution of the [MISC Govern  ] and even harder times for the [ORG ERC  ] . 
ICV: A Third , But Important , Wheel <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The third member of the tripartite coalition , also known as the [PER Entesa Catalana  ] de [ORG Progres  ] , the [ORG ICV  ] , did not hold a convention this summer , opting instead to convene next year . 
The [ORG ICV  ] , while not independence-minded , desires more power for [LOC Catalonia  ] , and largely supports the Socialists on most issues . 
However as a [ORG Green  ] party , they are stern critics of the [ORG PSC  ] 's environmental policies . 
[ORG ICV  ] leader and [MISC Catalan  ] Councilor for the Interior , [PER Joan Saura  ] , often tries to maintain balance between the [ORG PSC  ] and [ORG ERC  ] . 
[MISC CDC:  ] Fighting an [LOC Uphill Battle  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CDC  ] , the majority party of [ORG CiU  ] , has focused on recovering the presidency of the [ORG Generalitat  ] since they were unable to win a majority in 2006 . 
[ORG CDC  ] 's convention this summer underlined a party strategy that will mostly continue its current policies with minor adjustments . 
Among these slight tweaks was the adoption of party leader [PER Artur Mas  ] 's pet project of " the great house [MISC Catalan-ism  ] " ( la casa gran del catalanisme ) . 
It is an attempt to make the party appear more welcoming of the different strands of [MISC Catalan  ] nationalism , thus trying to expand its electorate and regaining a majority in the [ORG Generalitat  ] . 
The party 's platform does not explicitly call for independence , though it does emphasize [LOC Catalonia  ] 's right to self-determination and vaguely foresees [LOC Catalonia  ] as a free and sovereign state in 21st century [LOC Europe  ] . 
[ORG CiU  ] will also have a seat at the negotiating table this summer and fall as the regional and national governments wrangle over a new financing system. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a perennial move , the [ORG CDC  ] reiterated its desire to completely merge with rightist [ORG Democratic Union of Catalonia  ] ( [ORG UDC  ] ) into a single party , which [ORG UDC  ] , again , flatly refused , although it has not held a convention this summer . 
However , the two will continue as partners in [ORG CiU  ] . 
The [ORG CDC  ] also opted for more inclusion of the rank-and-file in decision-making , stating that the executive committee will consult with the membership on those matters of vital political transcendence , but their opinion will not be binding . 
Long accustomed to being perceived as the socially centrist choice among [MISC Catalan  ] parties , it is not yet clear how the [ORG CDC  ] will respond to the [ORG PSC  ] 's move to the middle . 
[PER PPC: Down  ] but Not Quite Out [ORG BARCELONA  ] 00000076 003.2 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG PPC  ] , the [ORG Popular Party  ] 's [MISC Catalan  ] subsidiary , is plagued by the same problems faced by the national party: unpopular leaders pushing unpopular ideas . 
For example , party members arrived at their convention to find that national [ORG PP  ] president , [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] , had unilaterally imposed a last-minute candidate for [ORG PPC  ] president , [PER Alicia Sanchez-Camacho  ] , a senator from [LOC Girona  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] also dispatched the new [ORG PP  ] Secretary for Organization , [PER Ana Mato  ] to persuade the other candidates , bitter rivals [PER Alberto Fernanez-Dmaz  ] and [PER Daniel Sirera  ] to drop their bids . 
Still , a fourth candidate , [LOC Montserrat  ] [LOC Nebrera  ] , refused to end her candidacy , and in the final vote , lost to [PER Sanchez-Camacho  ] by a slim 53%-47% vote. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Still , unpopular leaders are not the [ORG PPC  ] 's only obstacle to winning elections . 
In 2006 , the [ORG PP  ] opposed the [ORG Estatut  ] for the complete opposite reason as the [ORG ERC  ] ; they claimed it gave too much autonomy to [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
This is but one instance in which the [ORG PP  ] was thought by most [MISC Catalans  ] to be working against [LOC Catalonia  ] 's interests . 
In a region dominated by fervent nationalists , undermining [LOC Catalonia  ] is hardly a winning strategy . 
If the entire goal of a political party is to win elections , the [ORG PPC  ] has to drastically reform the way it does business if it ever hopes to govern [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
COMMENT <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As in many other ways , [MISC Catalan  ] politics differ markedly from the rest of [LOC Spain  ] , a product of the strong [MISC Catalan  ] national spirit that has seen a resurgence in the past three decades of democracy . 
Still , despite this deep-seated nationalism , less than a third of [MISC Catalans  ] support full independence from [LOC Spain  ] . 
In [LOC Barcelona  ] , the beating heart of [MISC Catalan  ] politics and economy , support is even lower . 
It is difficult to imagine [LOC Spain  ] without [LOC Catalonia  ] and impossible to imagine [LOC Catalonia  ] without [LOC Barcelona  ] . 
Why , then , are the [MISC Catalan  ] parties strongly advancing even more autonomy ? 
Why are the [MISC Catalan  ] Socialists pushing against [ORG PSOE  ] , ranking " [MISC Catalan  ] " over " socialist " ? 
The answer is that while the vast majority of [MISC Catalans  ] do not want independence , they do want respect from the rest of [LOC Spain  ] . 
They want recognition of the importance of the region in the [MISC Spanish  ] context - that they pay more into the system than they get out of it , that they are , at least in their own minds , the hardest working , most productive , and most efficient . 
We also believe they want acceptance of [LOC Catalonia  ] as a people with a different " story " , much like the [MISC Basques  ] or the [MISC Galicians  ] , that make them unique in [LOC Spain  ] . 
And recent history indicates that Madrid is ready to give them that respect , as the development of the [ORG Estatut  ] showed . 
The central government voluntarily limited its power over the region , allowing the [MISC Catalans  ] to police and educate themselves . 
Now , despite much bickering and hand wringing on all sides , most signs point to a new financing system that allows them to better fund themselves. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since presiding over the [ORG Generalitat  ] , the [ORG PSC  ] has fully acknowledged that this desire for respect exists , and that to keep power , they must accommodate it . 
However , as the next regional elections ( scheduled for 2010 ) approach , the [ORG PSC  ] will have to strike careful balances , not only between [ORG PSOE  ] and [LOC Catalonia  ] , but between its left flank and the need to win the center . 
To some extent , the tripartite alliance is a real boon , as the [ORG PSC  ] 's partners , the [ORG ERC  ] and [ORG ICV  ] , will mostly likely pick up the leftist votes lost by the Socialists' attempt at the middle . 
This complicates things enormously for the [ORG CiU  ] , which lacks a similar arrangement on the right . 
The [ORG PPC  ] , though an occasional ally in the past , is so fraught with its own problems that it can provide little support ; even should both parties desire it . 
In this light , the [ORG CiU  ] 's new policy of big-tent nationalism comes across as an aggressive electoral strategy to woo the staunch independents of the [ORG ERC  ] , and win an absolute majority . 
In addition to placing nationalism at the forefront , the [ORG CiU  ] can also hope that [LOC Spain  ] 's current economic woes , expected to last well into 2009 , tarnish the incumbent Socialists enough to win . 
Indeed it may be that this is [ORG CiU  ] 's best hope , since the resolution of the [ORG Estatut  ] and successful negotiations for a new finance system may fulfill [LOC Catalonia  ] 's desire for greater respect .
