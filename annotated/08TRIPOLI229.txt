REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Representatives of [ORG Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG HRW/PHR  ] ) visited [LOC Tripoli  ] in mid-March to perform an independent medical assessment of detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi and discuss his release with interlocutors from the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] is expected to be released from the hospital by late March in exchange for his tacit agreement to remain silent about his detention and refrain from making political statements . 
He is expected to convalesce initially in [LOC Tripoli  ] for several weeks in lodging provided by the [ORG QDF  ] , before traveling to either [LOC Benghazi  ] for further recovery at his family home there , or to the [LOC U.S.  ] for further diagnosis and treatment . 
The [ORG QDF  ] has indicated that it does not oppose facilitating issuance of a passport to el-Jahmi or his travel abroad , provided that he honors the terms of the agreement for his release . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] 's medical condition remains serious but is essentially stable ; [ORG PHR  ] assesses that he is medically able to return home provided he receives needed ongoing care on an outpatient basis . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] 's family has expressed concern about underwriting such treatment ; the [ORG QDF  ] may help defray those expenses . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] , which will likely issue a press statement coordinated with [ORG QDF  ] today or tomorrow , believe the focus for the next several weeks should be on confirming el-Jahmi 's safe return home , verifying his access to needed outpatient care and facilitating issuance of a passport and arranging travel abroad for further care . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] ( [ORG HRW  ] ) Senior Emergencies Researcher [PER Fred Abrahams  ] and Acting Regional Relations Director [PER Gasser Abdel Razzak  ] gave P/E Chief a readout March 15 of their meetings in [LOC Tripoli  ] with detained human rights activist [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi and his family . 
[ORG Physicians for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG PHR  ] ) representative Dr. [PER Scott Allen  ] , who accompanied [PER Abrahams  ] and [PER Abdel Razzak  ] and performed an independent medical assessment of el-Jahmi , had already departed [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[PER Abrahams  ] and [PER Abdel Razzak  ] conveyed the substance of his medical assessment . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] 's daugher , [PER Najla  ] , who lives in [LOC Benghazi  ] , traveled to [LOC Tripoli  ] to meet with [ORG HRW/PHR  ] and discuss next steps in her father 's case . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] 's son , [PER Muhammad  ] , and his wife also met with the [ORG HRW/PHR  ] team . 
EL-JAHMI FREE TO LEAVE HOSPITAL , IN FAMILY'S CUSTODY 3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] 's ( [ORG QDF  ] ) [ORG Human Rights Director  ] , [PER Saleh Abdulsalam  ] , was the primary interlocutor for [ORG HRW/PHR  ] ; [PER Abrahams  ] and [PER Allen  ] also spoke by telephone with [ORG QDF Executive  ] Director Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] , currently on travel outside the country . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] described the [ORG QDF  ] 's cooperation as " superb , forthright and professional " . 
[PER Abdulsalam  ] stressed that from the perspective of the [ORG GOL  ] and the [ORG QDF  ] , el-Jahmi 's legal issues were " closed matters " and the [ORG GOL  ] was " out of the picture " . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] had been free to return home since his " release " was announced on March 11 ; his family , who have legal custody of him now , may take him home at any time provided that his treating physician signs a medical release indicating it is medically safe to do so . 
( Note: [PER El-Jahmi  ] 's treating physician told P/E Chief March 12 that in his professional opinion , el-Jahmi could safely leave hospital ( ref A ) . 
He has since then indicated that el-Jahmi requires an additional one week to ten days in the hospital for " beta blockers " treatment for his heart . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] doctor has consulted both the family and [ORG PHR  ] 's [PER Allen  ] regarding this recommended treatment , and the family is in agreement . 
End note . 
) EL-JAHMI EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED BY LATE MARCH 4 . 
( C ) The family , led by daughter [PER Najla  ] , told [ORG HRW/PHR  ] and the [ORG QDF  ] they are prepared to take el-Jahmi home as soon as they can prepare his room in the family home in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
( Note: The home was ransacked and then occupied and damaged in 2004 when el-Jahmi , his wife and his son , [PER Muhammad  ] , were detained . 
The [ORG QDF  ] has offered to provide a small house or apartment in [LOC Tripoli  ] for el-Jahmi to stay in while the family 's [LOC Tripoli  ] home is being rennovated . 
End note . 
) The tacit condition for his release to his family is that he remain silent about his detention and refrain from making political statements . 
( Note: This is consistent with what [PER Sawani  ] told P/E Chief on March 3 ( ref B ) . 
End note . 
) El-Jahmi 's daughter , [PER Najla  ] , reportedly played a key role in convincing her father that he should agree to remain quiet , stressing to him that his focus - for now - should be on recovering his health and protecting his family . 
TRAVEL ABROAD FOR TREATMENT POSSIBLE , IF EL-JAHMI REMAINS QUIET [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000229 002 OF 004 ABOUT DETENTION 5 . 
( C ) Conceding that [ORG HRW  ] 's preference would have been to physically escort el-Jahmi out of the hospital and to his home , [PER Abrahams  ] said the [ORG QDF  ] flatly rejected that scenario , stressing the need to avoid the perception that [ORG HRW/PHR  ] and/or the [LOC U.S.  ] had " dictated " el-Jahmi 's release to the [ORG GOL  ] . 
The plan , coordinated with the [ORG QDF  ] , is for el-Jahmi to convalesce for several weeks at the family home in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
After that , it is expected that he will fly either to [LOC Benghazi  ] to continue convalescing at his family home there , or to [LOC Cairo  ] and onward to the [LOC U.S.  ] for further medical evaluation and treatment . 
[PER Allen  ] stressed that el-Jahmi will not be fit to travel by air for at least several weeks . 
[PER Abdulsalam  ] , confirming earlier remarks to [LOC Emboffs  ] , told [ORG HRW/PHR  ] that the [ORG QDF  ] " is not opposed " to el-Jahmi traveling abroad for treatment , but stressed that he would need to honor the terms of his release in order for such to occur . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] will engage with [PER Abdulsalam  ] in coming weeks to encourage the [ORG GOL  ] to issue el-Jahmi a new passport so he may travel ; Post will dual-track those efforts with [PER Sawani  ] . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] STATEMENT EXPECTED 6 . 
( C ) [PER Allen  ] and [PER Abdel Razzak  ] departed [LOC Tripoli  ] on March 15 ; [PER Abrahams  ] is scheduled to depart today . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] will remain in telephone and email contact with multiple members of el-Jahmi 's family to confirm that he is eventually transferred home without complication . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] intend to release a joint press statement , previewed with the [ORG QDF  ] , on/about March 18 . 
According to [PER Abrahams  ] , the statement will: 1 ) confirm el-Jahmi 's release and welcome it as a positive development ; 2 ) acknowledge the [ORG QDF  ] 's constructive role in securing el-Jahmi 's release ; 3 ) stress that el-Jahmi should not have been detained in the first place and express concern about the manner in which legal proceedings were conducted , and 4 ) note that while his medical care dramatically improved in the last two months , there is no question but that the net result of his detention and the delay in providing him treatment was a dramatic deterioration in his health . 
The [ORG QDF  ] 's [PER Abdulsalam  ] disputed the last point , asking how [ORG HRW/PHR  ] could determine that el-Jahmi 's deterioration resulted from conditions of his detention . 
Reprising arguments we 've heard from [PER Sawani  ] , [PER Abdulsalam  ] claimed that many factors , including el-Jahmi 's age ( he 's 66 years old ) and the possibility that he had refused treatment , may have precipitated his medical complications . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] pushed back and made it clear that the language will be included in the statement . 
MEDICAL CONDITION: RELATIVELY STABLE ( FOR NOW ) , BUT FURTHER CARE NEEDED 7 . 
( C ) [ORG HRW/PHR  ] visited el-Jahmi several times at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) , where he remained as of March 15 . 
Four to five plainclothes security officers were present . 
The man described as el-Jahmi 's nurse , [PER Abdullah Bashir  ] , was also present and facilitated access to el-Jahmi . 
[PER Allen  ] reviewed el-Jahmi 's case extensively with his treating physician , Dr. [PER Abdulrahman Mehdy  ] , and performed an independent medical examination of el-Jahmi . 
[PER Allen  ] and [PER Abdel Razzak  ] were the only individuals in the room during the examination . 
[PER Allen  ] concurred in [PER Mehdy  ] 's diagnosis and virtually all prescribed treatment , which he conveyed directly to el-Jahmi 's family , as well as to [PER Mehdy  ] and the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] . 
( Note: There were professional differences over the relative merits of different medications , but no other points of disagreement . 
End note . 
) MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN CARDIAC CONDITION 8 . 
( C ) [PER Allen  ] assessed el-Jahmi 's condition as being essentially stable , but noted that his heart condition is serious and that he is at some risk of heart attack " at any time " . 
El-Jahmi was " not a well man " and had been " pushed , medically , to the edge " by the lack of treatment in 2007 . 
Nonetheless , el-Jahmi 's his treatment at the [ORG TMC  ] - once initiated in late December/early January - was " good " and his health had improved " markedly " . 
El-Jahmi was able to walk ( with difficulty ) and his heart efficiency rate improved from 17 percent in July 2007 to 38 percent in late February , and to 52 percent on March 14 . 
[PER Allen  ] performed a basic cognitive awareness test and assessed that el-Jahmi did well considering his long period of isolated detention and lack of access to needed medication . 
He did show signs of short term memory loss ; [PER Abrahams  ] and [PER Abdel Razzak  ] said there were points during their visit when el-Jahmi " wasn't there , mentally " . 
[PER Allen  ] concurred with [PER Mehdy  ] 's assessment that from a medical standpoint , el-Jahmi may be safely released from [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000229 003 OF 004 the [ORG TMC  ] and treated on an outpatient basis . 
[PER Allen  ] noted that given his current condition , el-Jahmi would have already been discharged from a western hospital to free up bed space . 
FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC EXAMS NEEDED 9 . 
( C ) Nonetheless , el-Jahmi does have medical issues that will require ongoing care . 
[PER Allen  ] recommended that el-Jahmi undergo two procedures in the next several months: a biopsy of his enlarged prostate gland and a heart catheterization procedure to evaluate blockages and bloodflow . 
Both procedures are performed regularly at the [ORG TMC  ] ; [PER Allen  ] assessed the overall quality of care and the center 's ability to safely perform the two procedures as good . 
El-Jahmi agreed to undergo the biopsy procedure ; he has not yet consented to the heart catheterization . 
In addition , [PER Allen  ] assessed that the stent implanted in el-Jahmi 's heart in [LOC Jordan  ] in 1995 is likely nearing the end of its lifespan and will need to be replaced . 
OUTPATIENT CARE CRITICAL 10 . 
( C ) [PER Allen  ] stressed to the family the need for proper outpatient care after el-Jahmi 's expected release . 
The [ORG QDF  ] clearly understands ongoing , outpatient treatment and access to prescribed medications and diagnostic exams will be needed , and agreed to help facilitate those . 
Per the [ORG QDF  ] , there will be no restrictions on el-Jahmi 's ability to return to the [ORG TMC  ] for ongoing care on either an inpatient or outpatient basis ; however , the family flatly stated they do not trust Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] and will seek another treating physician in consultation with [PER Allen  ] . 
The family believes it will not be a problem to identify a physician in [LOC Benghazi  ] should el-Jahmi return there in future ; however , they expressed concern about identifying an appropriate physician in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[ORG HRW  ] and [ORG PHR  ] requested copies of el-Jahmi 's full medical records , including treatment at the [ORG TMC  ] and any treatment administered prior to his admission there . 
FAMILY CONCERNED ABOUT FINANCING CARE , [ORG QDF  ] MAY HELP 11 . 
( C ) [PER Abrahams  ] stressed the family 's concern about how they will underwrite el-Jahmi 's ongoing care . 
Family properties in [LOC Benghazi  ] and [LOC Tripoli  ] had been confiscated or damaged in connection with el-Jahmi 's long-running criticism of the [ORG GOL  ] ; some properties were also sold to help make ends meet . 
( Note: El-Jahmi 's contentious relationship with the [ORG GOL  ] goes back more than two decades and has progressively worsened . 
End note . 
) The family asked [ORG HRW  ] whether it could request compensation from the [ORG QDF  ] and/or [ORG GOL  ] . 
Stressing that [ORG HRW  ] would not/not be directly involved in such negotiations , [PER Abrahams  ] said [ORG QDF Human Rights Director Saleh  ] [PER Abdulsalam  ] suggested the [ORG QDF  ] could help defray el-Jahmi 's medical expenses and explore the possibility of compensation . 
El-Jahmi 's son , [PER Muhammad  ] , is to contact [PER Abdulsalam  ] directly to follow up on those issues . 
NEXT STEPS 12 . 
( C ) [PER Abrahams  ] said that from the perspective of [ORG HRW/PHR  ] , the focus in the next several weeks should be on: 1 ) confirming that el-Jahmi has safely returned home ; 2 ) verifying access to appropriate outpatient care ( to include resolving attendant financial issues ) , and 3 ) urging the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] to issue el-Jahmi a passport and facilitate his travel abroad for further treatment . 
[ORG HRW/PHR  ] may try to facilitate a visit by a cardiologist from [LOC Cairo  ] or [LOC Tunis  ] in approximately two weeks to assess el-Jahmi 's condition and outpatient care . 
13 ( C ) Comment: [ORG HRW/PHR  ] believe that the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG GOL  ] have an interest in seeing that el-Jahmi 's health does not seriously deteriorate while he is in [LOC Libya  ] and will therefore be likely to facilitate his travel abroad for care . 
We concur , but his physical security in the near-term remains a concern . 
[PER Sawani  ] told P/E Chief on March 3 that the [ORG QDF  ] had to intevene in 2004 to pre-empt efforts by unspecified regime elements to kill el-Jahmi outright ( rather than detain him ) after he gave an interview to satellite television channel al-Hurra criticizing Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and the [ORG GOL  ] . 
The presence of security officials outside el-Jahmi 's room at the [ORG TMC  ] is doubtless motivated in part by a desire to monitor his activities and visitors , but also by the [ORG GOL  ] 's interest in ensuring his physical safety . 
Post will remain in contact with el-Jahmi 's family members and will visit him at home after his expected return to assess his condition there and arrangements for his outpatient treatment . 
We will also remain in contact with the [ORG QDF  ] to urge issuance of el-Jahmi 's passport and dispensation for [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000229 004 OF 004 him to travel abroad . 
Whether el-Jahmi honors the terms of the tacit agreement for his release will be critical in determining the extent to which we , the [ORG QDF  ] and [ORG HRW/PHR  ] are able to ensure his physical safety and facilitate issuance of a passport and travel abroad for treatment .
