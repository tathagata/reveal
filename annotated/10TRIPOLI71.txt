Guests included prominent print and television journalists , academics , businesspeople , and young scholars . 
The event began at 9 AM EST with a discussion of the [MISC Internet  ] 's influences on political , economic , and social discourse in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Low bandwidth ultimately prevented the continuation of the live feed of the speech . 
Instead , Embassy 's [ORG PAO  ] continued the discussion , with conversation touching on all of the themes that the Secretary mentioned in her speech . 
Following the discussion , several guests opined that this was one of the best , most open conversations they had ever enjoyed in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Most guests acknowledged that while the [MISC Internet  ] is not censored in [LOC Libya  ] -- no pages are blocked -- local security agencies monitor [MISC Internet  ] activities . 
Some guests defended the practices of the government in enforcing the country 's moral ethos and [MISC Islamic  ] values. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] distributed copies of the Secretary 's remarks as delivered in [MISC English  ] and [MISC Arabic  ] and posted the texts on the Embassy 's website . 
A photographer and journalist from [ORG Oea  ] newspaper , a daily newspaper owned by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qaddafi 's al-Ghad Company , attended the event , but according to international press , the newspaper 's operations were suspended the following day . 
( Note: A subsequent [MISC Libyan  ] press report quoted a local government source as denying the news that the publication was shut-down . 
We do not believe the possible closure of the paper was related to the reporter 's attendance of our event . 
End note . 
) The speech was not reported in local media .
