( C ) [ORG SUMMARY: The Government of Cuba  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) used the [ORG UN Climate Change Conference  ] in [LOC Copenhagen  ] to distract attention from problems within [LOC Cuba  ] and ferociously vent against the [LOC United States  ] and , in particular , President [PER Obama  ] . 
While some elements within the [ORG GOC  ] are legitimately concerned about the environment , the harsh and well orchestrated response was pure political posturing . 
Like the world financial crisis before it ( ref A ) , climate change provides a perfect platform for the [ORG GOC  ] to join its [ORG ALBA  ] friends to decry capitalism and blame the West for all of the world’s ills . 
At the heart of [MISC Cuba’s  ] complaints was not the substance of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] but rather the process , in particular the fact that [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] were not involved in the negotiations . 
Despite the circus-like treatment that [MISC Cuba’s  ] mercurial leader afforded to climate issues , many in the [ORG GOC  ] are actually serious about climate change . 
END SUMMARY . 
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL BATTLE IN HUMAN HISTORY --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Communist Party  ] leader and former President [PER Fidel Castro  ] has mentioned or focused on the [ORG Copenhagen Conference  ] and the role of the [LOC United States  ] in nearly every one of his “Reflection” articles since September 2009 . 
Previously , [PER Fidel  ] had only sporadically written on climate change , although he has been obsessed with President [PER Obama  ] since the 2008 elections . 
[PER Fidel  ] began to hint that the [ORG Copenhagen Summit  ] would fail after an [ORG ALBA Summit  ] held in [LOC Bolivia  ] in mid-October and by early November , he was openly predicting failure . 
In a December 14 message to [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] following an [ORG ALBA  ] summit held in [LOC Havana  ] , [PER Fidel  ] wrote that [LOC Copenhagen  ] represented “the most important political battle of human history.” On December 17 , [PER Fidel  ] quoted extensively from speeches by [PER Chavez  ] and [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] at the conference while criticizing a planned meeting between President [PER Obama  ] and twenty-plus countries scheduled for the following day. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the conference , [PER Fidel  ] wrote three straight Reflections devoted to attacking President [PER Obama’s  ] participation in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
[PER Fidel  ] called President [PER Obama’s  ] conference remarks “deceitful , demagogic and ambiguous.” In a January 3 Reflection , [PER Fidel  ] claimed “the yanki president , [PER Barack Obama  ] , and a group of the richest states on the planet , resolved to dismantle the binding commitments of [LOC Kyoto.”  ] This is in sharp contrast to his mid-September Reflection that one of President [PER Obama’s  ] two positive features was his concern for climate change ( concern for health care was the other ) . 
FOREIGN MINISTER ACTS OUT FIDEL’S REFLECTIONS --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fidel  ] wrote on December 19 , as if he were still in charge of the country , that Foreign Minister [PER Bruno Rodriguez  ] would explain in a press conference upon his return from [LOC Copenhagen  ] “the truth” of what happened . 
Like a good soldier , the otherwise calm FM [PER Rodriguez  ] blamed President [PER Obama  ] in a December 21 press conference for the “failure” of the climate conference . 
[PER Rodriguez  ] said “at the summit , there was only imperial , arrogant [PER Obama  ] , who does not listen , who imposes his positions and even threatens developing countries.” [PER Rodriguez  ] accused President [PER Obama  ] of maintaining the same position that had prevented the [LOC United States  ] from ratifying the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
[PER Rodriguez  ] claimed President [PER Obama  ] knew he was lying when he said he was confident an agreement would be reached after the President departed but before the end of the conference . 
In addition to President [PER Obama  ] , [PER Rodriguez  ] also targeted [ORG UK Prime Minister  ] [PER Gordon Brown  ] for allegedly trying to blackmail countries into accepting [LOC HAVANA  ] 00000011 002.2 OF 003 the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
This was only his fourth press conference since becoming Foreign Minister following one on the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo in September 2009 , the situation in [LOC Honduras  ] in June , and a meeting with [ORG EU  ] commissioner [PER Luis Michel  ] in March of that same year . 
WHY SO ANGRY ? ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the heart of [MISC Cuba’s  ] complaints was not the substance of the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] but rather the process , in particular the fact that [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] were not involved in the negotiations . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has reported hourly details of how the events unfolded from President [PER Obama’s  ] arrival and departure to the eventual departure of the [MISC Cuban  ] delegation , highlighting [PER Obama’s  ] short visit and meetings with “selected” countries . 
[PER Rodriguez  ] labeled the conference an “antidemocratic , exclusionary , arbitrary farce.” The [ORG GOC  ] detailed the efforts of presidents [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Morales  ] to defend ALBA’s position and not accept any agreement that did not place all the responsibility on the developed nations , including repayment of a massive “climate debt” to developing nations . 
IDEOLOGUES TRUMP SCIENTISTS --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A [MISC British  ] diplomat told us that there are in fact moderates in the [MISC Cuban  ] government that were interested in negotiating a productive agreement for the sake of the environment . 
[MISC Cuba’s  ] position was apparently still up in the air until the [ORG ALBA  ] summit in [LOC Havana  ] when hardliners in the government took over the issue . 
Our contact told us , “the moderates had nothing to offer ; the hardliners had [PER Chavez  ] and his oil.” USEFUL DOMESTIC DISTRACTION --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Copenhagen  ] also provided the international media with a distraction from the fruitless domestic meetings taking place at the same time within [LOC Cuba  ] . 
In the midst of [MISC Fidel’s  ] and Bruno’s outbursts , current President [PER Raul Castro  ] barely mentioned the conference in his December 20 speech to the [ORG National Assembly  ] , and what he did say had a more diplomatic and reflective tone . 
[PER Raul  ] did not mention President [PER Obama  ] at any time in his speech . 
He lamented that the climate change conference ended without “tangible results” , but focused on what [LOC Cuba  ] was doing to improve its water supply , to encourage the planting of trees , to teach new generations about nature , and to plan for coastal dangers and vulnerabilities for the years 2050-2100 . 
The rest of the [ORG National Assembly  ] was a significant disappointment with the only sound bites coming from [PER Raul Castro’s  ] own [LOC U.S.  ] bashing regarding the December arrest of an Amcit and USINT efforts to monitor [ORG Human Rights Day  ] activities ( Ref B ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Another common theme in [MISC Fidel’s Reflections  ] , Foreign Minister Rodriguez’s press conference and the official press was the “brutality of the [MISC Danish  ] police force against thousands of protesters and invitees , ” all stated without any sense of irony . 
One western diplomat commented that the events in [LOC Copenhagen  ] provided the perfect diversion from the GOC’s own repressive actions on [ORG Human Rights Day  ] December 10 ( Ref C ) . 
[MISC CUBA’S  ] SELF-INTEREST IN CLIMATE CHANGE -------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite the circus-like treatment that [MISC Cuba’s  ] mercurial leader afforded to climate issues , many in the [ORG GOC  ] are actually serious about climate change . 
An international journalist who follows environmental issues in [LOC Cuba  ] told us that within the [ORG GOC  ] there is much interest in climate change and a willingness to adapt and implement measures to combat the effects . 
This is partly due to [MISC Cuba’s  ] vulnerability to rising temperatures and sea levels , most notably the potential flooding of an area with great biodiversity on the [LOC HAVANA  ] 00000011 003.2 OF 003 southwest coast ( [LOC Zapata Swamp  ] ) . 
She said the [ORG GOC  ] includes environmental considerations in all national development plans . 
The [MISC British  ] diplomat told us that a month before the [LOC Copenhagen  ] conference a group of [MISC British  ] experts visited [LOC Cuba  ] and had “serious” discussions with [MISC Cuban  ] officials about exploring options for alternative energy . 
He said the [MISC Cubans  ] are desperate for diversifying energy sources , but lack the necessary funding and technology. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG UN Development Program  ] has a $25.5 million program in [LOC Cuba  ] for 2008-2012 focused on climate change and sustainable energy . 
Projects include supporting conservation and biodiversity , implementing sustainable agriculture , and promoting the safe management of the bays in [LOC Havana  ] and [LOC Cienfuegos  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] also constructively participates in regional [ORG UN  ] projects , including hosting [ORG UN Environment Program  ] workshops and providing ( [MISC EU-funded  ] ) technical assistance to other [LOC Caribbean  ] countries like [LOC Haiti.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Several [LOC U.S.  ] environmental groups , like the [ORG Environmental Defense Fund  ] , have close relationships with [MISC Cuban  ] officials in the [ORG Ministry of Environment , Science and Technology  ] . 
These NGOs provide some technical assistance , but tell us that they are not allowed to pursue their own projects but rather are limited to respond to [ORG GOC  ] requests . 
In particular , any research or work related to [MISC Cuba’s  ] oil refineries and nickel plants is strictly off limits . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the area around the nickel mines in [LOC Moa  ] , [LOC Holguin  ] consistently reports the sickest population in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
One [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expert told us that oil production , refining , and electricity generation facilities in [LOC Cuba  ] are generations behind [LOC U.S.  ] and international environmental standards . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] countered in response to the [ORG GOC  ] outbursts following [LOC Copenhagen  ] that [MISC Cuban  ] authorities were in no position to judge due to [MISC Cuba’s  ] disastrous treatment of its land , water , air and biodiversity . 
[PER Espinosa Chepe  ] then used official [MISC Cuban  ] statistics to support his claim . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Climate change is [PER Fidel Castro’s  ] latest pet project in which poor , socialist countries are the victims and rich , capitalist countries are entirely to blame . 
Climate change provides [PER Fidel  ] the perfect opportunity to play statesman with little risk to his brother’s credibility at home . 
FM Rodriguez’ fiery remarks during his December 21 press conference were out of character and resembled past [PER Fidel Castro  ] speeches . 
Some element of the [ORG GOC  ] may see climate change as a legitimate concern , but the view from the top is that of a political propaganda goldmine .
