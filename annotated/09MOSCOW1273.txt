[LOC MOSCOW  ] 572 Classified By: DCM [PER Eric Rubin  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Economic ties , especially long-term gas contracts , are a pillar of [MISC Russia-Italy  ] relations and affect [MISC Italy’s  ] policies toward [LOC Russia  ] . 
[MISC Italian  ] gas company [ORG ENI  ] and [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Gazprom  ] have supply commitments in place until 2035 , as well as a joint-construction agreement for the [ORG South Stream  ] pipeline . 
ENI’s company representative is often called [MISC Italy’s  ] second ambassador to [LOC Russia  ] . 
The personal relationship between Prime Ministers [PER Vladimir Putin  ] and [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] is the other key element of [MISC Russia-Italy  ] relations , with Putin’s family spending long visits at the [PER Berlusconi  ] family mansion in [LOC Sardinia  ] at [LOC Berlusconi’s  ] expense . 
[MISC Italian  ] diplomats enjoy excellent access to [MISC Russian  ] officials . 
Should [LOC Italy  ] stop seeking to moderate [MISC European  ] states’ [MISC Russian  ] policies , the [ORG GOR  ] would likely need to alter its political calculus . 
End Summary . 
Economics affects politics -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] obtains significant economic benefits from [LOC Italy  ] , gaining access to its equipment and technology , its stable market for gas and oil , and its highly desired consumer goods . 
In return , [LOC Russia  ] provides [LOC Italy  ] good offices for access to [MISC Central Asian  ] supplies of gas and consumer markets . 
[MISC Italian  ] companies have also looked to invest in [LOC Russia’s  ] aviation sector and electricity generation , although the economic crisis put many of these efforts on hold. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) However , the economic interdependency does not come without other costs . 
[MISC Italian  ] Embassy First Secretary [PER Lorenzo Fanara  ] told us that the countries’ economic ties were strong enough to affect [MISC Italy’s  ] political stance toward [LOC Russia  ] . 
He said [MISC Italian  ] leaders , politicians , and businessmen would always be “careful” in dealing with [LOC Russia  ] , as [LOC Italy  ] exported to [LOC Russia  ] over 10 billion [MISC Euros  ] worth of goods annually , most of it produced by small and medium-sized companies. “Russia is simply too important of an economic partner for us , ” [PER Fanara  ] explained . 
While the [ORG GOI  ] understood the shortcomings of the [MISC Russian  ] government ( read: adherence to democratic values and freedoms ) , it could not afford to be too harsh in its criticism . 
Deep ties on gas ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The crown jewels of [MISC Italy’s  ] business interests with [LOC Russia  ] are ENI’s gas contracts with [ORG Gazprom  ] through 2035 and its 50-50 partnership with [ORG Gazprom  ] in the [ORG South Stream  ] pipeline project .
