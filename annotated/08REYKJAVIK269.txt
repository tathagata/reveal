Some [MISC Icelandic  ] foreign service staff at overseas posts will be moved back to [LOC Reykjavik  ] , and nonessential travel has been frozen .

As part of the fallout , [LOC Iceland  ] 's Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] will be transferred several years ahead of schedule in early 2009 , though we have been assured in [LOC Reykjavik  ] that the [ORG MFA  ] will make staffing in [LOC Washington  ] one of its top priorities . 
With the cuts , the Foreign Minister is sending a clear signal that she will be demanding fiscal responsibility from the coalition 's other ministers . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On November 12 , Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] announced Ministry for Foreign Affairs ( [ORG MFA  ] ) plans to cut its expenditures in FY 2009 . 
In the context of the current economic crisis , the [ORG MFA  ] is the first ministry to propose cutting its allocations in the draft budget bill currently with the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) . 
The [ORG MFA  ] plans to cut a total of [MISC ISK  ] 2.3 billion ( roughly $17 million ) or 20 percent of its share of the proposed 2009 budget . 
Most notably , four [MISC Icelandic  ] missions will be closed: the [MISC Icelandic  ] Embassy in [LOC Pretoria  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] ; the [ORG Permanent Mission  ] to the [ORG Council of Europe  ] in [LOC Strasbourg  ] , [LOC France  ] ; the [ORG Permanent Mission  ] to the [ORG United Nations Agencies in Rome  ] ; and an [ORG Icelandic International Development Agency  ] office in [LOC Colombo  ] , [LOC Sri Lanka  ] that handles [LOC Iceland  ] 's development aid . 
Six [MISC Icelandic  ] Ambassadors will retire in 2009: two at the beginning of the year and four later in the year ; they will not be replaced , thereby reducing a major salary expense for the [ORG MFA  ] . 
FM [PER Gisladottir  ] appointed one new Ambassador , [PER Kristin Arnadottir  ] , who previously was a Special Envoy for [LOC Iceland  ] 's bid for a [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat and will now serve in effect as her Chief of [LOC Staff.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's diplomatic presence in the [LOC U.S.  ] will also be affected . 
Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] [PER Albert Jonsson  ] will leave his post in early 2009 to head the [MISC Icelandic  ] liaison office in the [LOC Faroe Islands  ] . 
[PER Jonsson  ] 's departure will shorten his tenure by several years from the traditional ambassadorial tour of duty , as he has only been in [LOC Washington  ] a little less than two years . 
Post had also initially understood that the Deputy Chief of [ORG Mission  ] post in [LOC Washington  ] would not be filled when the incumbent transfers next summer ; however , senior [ORG MFA  ] officials here tell Ambassador that the [ORG MFA  ] is committed to staffing [LOC Washington  ] with the best people it can find . 
In [LOC New York City  ] , two positions at the Consulate General will be moved to [LOC Iceland  ] , and the position of Consul General will not be filled when the current Consul General retires at the end of this year . 
This is part of a worldwide shift in which foreign service staff at different overseas posts will be moved back to [LOC Reykjavik  ] to work at the [ORG MFA  ] main office. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The cost cutting will also affect defense-related spending . 
The [ORG MFA  ] proposes that this be cut by [MISC ISK  ] 257 million ( about $1.9 million ) , from the previous allocation of [MISC ISK  ] 1.4 billion ( roughly $10.3 million ) . 
Post learned from a contact at the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] that the [ORG MFA  ] had simply notified them that their budget had been cut by a certain percentage , but that the details would be left up to the agency . 
The contact did not indicate what that percentage was . 
In the announcement , the FM suggested that the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] would reduce the frequency of air policing by other [ORG NATO  ] member states from four to three deployments annually . 
However , in a subsequent conversation with Ambassador , [ORG MFA  ] officials stressed that they were looking first at overtime and " inflated " salaries at the [ORG IDA  ] as targets for cuts . 
The [ORG MFA  ] is making every effort to avoid cuts that will have a direct operational impact on the [MISC IDA.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The [ORG MFA  ] has also proposed to lower [LOC Iceland  ] 's contribution to international aid . 
Allocations to this spending item would decrease by [MISC ISK  ] 1.67 billion ( approximately $12.3 million ) . 
The [ORG GOI  ] planned to contribute 0.35 percent of GNP to international aid , but after the proposed reduction the share will be 0.24 percent of GNP . 
The [ORG GOI  ] had hoped to reach the [ORG UN  ] benchmark of 0.7 percent of GNP in the next couple of years , but the cost-cutting measures at the [ORG MFA  ] will without a doubt put that goal on hold for the unforeseeable future . 
Initial reaction from the [LOC NGO  ] community here was measured ; the Head of the [ORG Icelandic Human Rights Center  ] , which has long pressed the [ORG MFA  ] to increase development aid , said the cuts were " understandable " given the economic situation in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[LOC REYKJAVIK  ] 00000269 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) One of the [ORG MFA  ] 's showpiece public diplomacy and trade promotion tools also came under the knife . 
The [ORG MFA  ] had expected to spend [MISC ISK  ] 485 million ( about $3.6 million ) on [LOC Iceland  ] 's participation in the [MISC World Exposition  ] at [LOC Shanghai  ] in 2010 . 
The [ORG MFA  ] now proposes that only [MISC ISK  ] 140 million ( about $1 million ) be spent on the [LOC EXPO  ] . 
This is a 71-percent reduction from the total budgeted amount. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The Foreign Minister is the first agency head here to announce what specific programs she will cut in light of [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic collapse . 
She obviously intends to use this example to press other ministries to follow her lead . 
Some are concerned that closure of embassies will be a mistake in the long run , but cuts here and in defense spending address two of the most commonly-criticized areas of the [ORG MFA  ] 's budget: expensive overseas operations and defense spending in a country without a military . 
On the other hand , bloggers and pundits are having a field day with the appointment of [PER Kristin Arnadottir  ] , a long-time friend and colleague of FM [PER Gisladottir  ] , as Ambassador . 
Observers also see political motives in the transfer of Ambassador [PER Jonsson  ] from the [LOC United States  ] to the [LOC Faroe Islands  ] , with some calling it humiliating for both [PER Jonsson  ] and his long-time mentor [PER David Oddsson  ] , former PM and current [ORG Central Bank  ] Chairman . 
[PER Oddsson  ] and [PER Gisladottir  ] are known to be political rivals , so the shift is unsurprising in that regard . 
That said , we expect that the [ORG MFA  ] will place a priority on staffing the [LOC Washington  ] Embassy well .
