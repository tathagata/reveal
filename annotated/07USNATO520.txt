( C ) Afghanistan: Secretary General de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] expressed worry at the breaks of silence by two nations ( comment: [LOC France  ] and [LOC Spain  ] ) in the [ORG Military Committee  ] ( [ORG MC  ] ) , which threaten [ORG MC  ] approval of a proposal that would common-fund contract helicopter transport lift for [ORG ISAF  ] and address one of the mission , s longstanding weaknesses . 
He implored nations to resolve the breaks of silence urgently . 
In their later interventions , both Ambassador [PER Nuland  ] and [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Eldon  ] strongly supported the [ORG SYG  ] , with Ambassador [PER Nuland  ] also noting the beneficial effect the initiative could have by eventually providing lift for [ORG ANA  ] units to do more .

He described [MISC Australian  ] satisfaction with their relationship with the [LOC Netherlands  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , but concern at overall force levels in [LOC RC-South  ] and the ability of the [ORG Taliban  ] to return to areas cleared by [ORG ISAF  ] in the absence of capable [MISC Afghan  ] security forces . 
[LOC Australia  ] is the 10th largest contributor to [ORG ISAF  ] and the leading contributor among [ORG NATO  ] partners. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Alluding to September 19 press reports of a new major [ORG ISAF  ] operation in the [LOC South  ] , SHAPE DCOS for Operations MG [PER Wright  ] noted to PermReps this was just a continuation of ongoing operations in the [LOC Upper Gereshk Valley  ] .

MG [PER Wright  ] supported the [ORG SYG  ] by re-emphasizing the importance of the helicopter initiative to [ORG ISAF  ] , s operational success , and urged nations to do better on counter-IED training for personnel deploying to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
IEDs are the most lethal threat to [ORG ISAF  ] personnel , he stated , and nations continue to send personnel to the theater with inadequate training . 
Training is a national responsibility according to [ORG NATO  ] doctrine , [PER Wright  ] said , but [ORG NATO  ] would start developing its own counter-IED training syllabus in view of the training , s importance and weaknesses in Allied nation programs. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

Ambassador [PER Eldon  ] asserted the [ORG IRGC Qods Force  ] has made several arms shipments to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , that it maintains a strategic relationship with the [ORG Taliban  ] , and that it may have attempted to conceal its activities from other branches of the [MISC Iranian  ] government .

Supporting the [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador , who asked for more [ORG NAC  ] discussion on police training , she suggested a joint brief to the [ORG NAC  ] by CSTC-A Commander MG Cone and the new head of the [ORG EUPOL  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( whose role [LOC Belgium  ] highlighted ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
