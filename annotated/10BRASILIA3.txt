<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L [LOC BRASILIA  ] 000003 SIPDIS STATE FOR T , PM AND WHA E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 2020/01/05 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/ETTC_0.html'>ETTC</a> <a href='/tag/MASS_0.html'>MASS</a> <a href='/tag/BR_0.html'>BR</a> SUBJECT: FX2 at the End of 2009 REF: [LOC BRASILIA  ] 1124 ; [ORG IIR  ] 6 809 0156 10 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Lisa Kubiske  ] , Charge d'Affaires a.i. ; REASON: 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) As 2009 comes to end , [LOC Brazil  ] 's FX2 competition remains undecided . 
It had been expected that President [PER Lula  ] would make a decision before the end of the year , so as to be able to complete the sale during his tenure . 
Practically speaking , however , even if a Presidential decision were to be made immediately , the time needed for contract negotiation and appropriation of funds means that the final decision to buy the planes will fall to the next President in 2011 . 
Embassy contacts in the [ORG Ministry of External Relations and Ministry of Defense  ] believe that Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] will meet with [PER Lula  ] later in January to try to make a decision . 
SEPTEMBER: [ORG RAFALE PREFERRED  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Lula  ] has made no secret of his preference for the [ORG Dassault  ] [MISC Rafale  ] , announcing during President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's September 7 visit ( ref a ) that he planned to negotiate the purchase with [LOC France  ] , before even reading the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's ( [ORG BRAF  ] ) technical evaluation . 
During the following three months , it was clear that [PER Lula  ] had instructed his government , including [PER Jobim  ] , to focus on making the deal with [LOC France  ] work . 
In September , [PER Lula  ] told the [MISC Brazilian  ] press that negotiations with [LOC France  ] would focus on attaining a price for the aircraft similar to what [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG Saab  ] were asking . 
( Reportedly , [ORG Dassault  ] 's best offer was 40% higher . 
) Despite another [PER Sarkozy  ] visit to [LOC Brazil  ] in November and [PER Jobim  ] 's later stop in [LOC Paris  ] , the [MISC French  ] were not able to meet [MISC Brazilian  ] requests for a lower price , but their lack of responsiveness ( ref b ) did not seem to affect the [MISC Brazilian  ] preference . 
Initial statements in September from [PER Lula  ] and FM [ORG Amorim  ] attempted to portray the [MISC French  ] as somehow offering a superior level of technology transfer as justification for the higher price , but as details emerged from the technical evaluation process , it became clear that all three competitors were generally meeting [ORG BRAF  ] tech transfer requirements . 
DECEMBER: NEW MOD INTEREST IN [ORG BOEING  ] , [ORG SAAB  ] STILL A CONTENDER <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During October and November , contacts by Embassy officials and [ORG Boeing  ] representatives were received politely , but with little real interest as the focus remained on the [MISC French  ] . 
In recent weeks , however , there has been a notable change from the Minister of Defense . 
Beginning with [PER A/S Valenzuela  ] 's December 14 meeting with [PER Jobim  ] ( reported septel ) , there has been renewed interest in the USG/Boeing proposal . 
While [PER Jobim  ] repeated concerns about " bad precedents " for policies regarding transfer of [MISC U.S.-origin  ] technology ( in reality complaints about export licensing procedures ) , he said he understood that the [ORG USG  ] had a new approach and was interested in [ORG Boeing  ] 's industrial cooperation offer . 
[ORG Boeing  ] has strengthened its case by promoting its new " [MISC Global Super Hornet  ] " initiative , which would transfer important elements of production of all [MISC F/A 18  ] aircraft ( including those for the [LOC U.S.  ] military ) to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
By globalizing [MISC Super Hornet  ] production and including [LOC Brazil  ] in the process , [ORG Boeing  ] not only is in position to create and maintain more jobs in [LOC Brazil  ] , but can assuage [MISC Brazilian  ] paranoia about theoretical [ORG USG  ] cutoffs of fighter supply by pointing out that any such cutoff would affect the [LOC U.S.  ] Navy as well . 
In a recent interview with the newspaper [ORG Folha de Sao Paulo  ] , [PER Jobim  ] was careful not to commit , mentioning the " strategic alliance " with [LOC France  ] but also noting that cost , technology transfer and overall aircraft capability were important. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Along with the revival of [ORG Boeing  ] 's hopes , the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG Gripen  ] remains a strong competitor . 
As noted in ref b , many [MISC Brazilians  ] perceive it to be an attractive alternative to the [ORG Rafale  ] because it has the lowest sticker price . 
[ORG Saab  ] 's plan to co-develop the new generation [ORG Gripen  ] with [LOC Brazil  ] has also garnered support in [LOC Brazil  ] 's aviation industry among those who believe that such development will increase local aircraft design capabilities . 
[PER Jobim  ] , however , has been openly dismissive of the [MISC Swedes  ] on the basis of the [ORG Gripen  ] 's lesser capability and because the " [MISC New Generation  ] " variant offered to [LOC Brazil  ] does not yet exist . 
A recent story in [MISC Isto  ] C ) magazine with sourcing to the [ORG BRAF  ] pointed out that military aircraft development programs normally run over deadlines and budgets , negating the [ORG Gripen  ] 's purported price advantage. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
While the [ORG Rafale  ] 's high price and doubts about the [ORG Gripen  ] 's development would seem to make the [MISC Super Hornet  ] the obvious choice , the fact remains that [PER Lula  ] is reluctant to buy an [MISC American  ] aircraft . 
It is possible that the renewed interest in the [ORG USG  ] offer is merely a ploy to gain leverage on the [MISC French  ] or that the delay in the decision is intended to allow [ORG Dassault  ] to find a way to lower its price . 
In [ORG Mission  ] 's view , the chance to win the FX2 competition is real . 
We know that the [MISC Super Hornet  ] received the most favorable technical evaluation from the [ORG BRAF  ] and is the choice of the operators . 
We have also been successful in answering most of the doubts raised about [ORG USG  ] technology transfer policies , particularly with the technical evaluation team . 
There remains , however , the formidable obstacle of convincing [PER Lula  ] . 
Our goal now should be to make sure that [PER Jobim  ] has as strong a case as possible to take to [PER Lula  ] in January . 
[ORG Mission  ] recommends the following steps: [ORG B7 Continue  ] to underline full [ORG USG  ] support in all high-level contacts with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
As [ORG Mission  ] has pointed out previously , repeated assurances from President [PER Obama  ] to [PER Lula  ] in the course of their normal contacts are the single most effective means of making our case . 
[ORG B7  ] Use [PER Ambassador-Designate Shannon  ] 's initial contacts with the [MISC Brazilian  ] leadership to make the point that we have worked hard to ensure we have the best offer . 
[PER B7 Maintain  ] our public affairs campaign to highlight that not only has the [ORG USG  ] completed its approval of tech transfer , but [ORG Boeing  ] is confident enough in the offer to be prepared to shift part of production ( including hundreds of jobs ) to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER B7 Coordinate  ] with [ORG Boeing  ] to ensure the advantages of the [MISC Global Super Hornet  ] program are made known to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] and media .
