ADDIS  ] ABABA 2945 [PER B. LILONGWE  ] 690 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Gene A. Cretz  ] , Ambassador , US Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( S/NF ) Rumors persist that [LOC Libya  ] is seeking an unprecedented second consecutive term as [ORG African Union Chair  ] , driven largely by its continued " dinar diplomacy , " much of it delivered by personal envoys of [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
Recent gifts , both public and discreet , to member states have been interpreted by some diplomatic missions as part of an orchestrated campaign to insert [LOC Libya  ] into position above [LOC Malawi  ] or its [ORG Southern Region  ] neighbors . 
A series of head-of-state visits , a [MISC C-10  ] summit ( reportedly focused on [ORG UN  ] reform ) and the recent announcement of a $250 thousand gift to the [MISC Ghanaian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] have added fuel to the rumors . 
However , we have also learned that [LOC Malawi  ] -- next in line to chair the [ORG AU  ] -- has not been moved by either [LOC Libya  ] or the other [MISC African  ] states [LOC Libya  ] has sought to influence through its largesse . 
2 . 
( C ) Diplomats from two [MISC North African  ] embassies separately told [PER Poloff  ] that they expected [LOC Libya  ] 's " donations " to continue but that they did not expect [LOC Libya  ] to make the coordinated push for the Chairmanship that it did last year . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] [PER Poloff  ] commented that the [MISC Libyans  ] already have " their plate full " with the March 2010 [ORG Arab League  ] summit , for which the government is constructing opulent guest quarters and a new meeting hall in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
He noted that while [LOC Libya  ] cleared the way for its [ORG AU  ] candidacy last year through [MISC CEN-SAD  ] coordination meetings , several ( un-named ) [MISC CEN-SAD  ] partners oppose a second term for [PER Qadhafi  ] and that " it would be very difficult for [LOC Egypt  ] to support . 
" He assessed that [LOC Libya  ] 's donations were " business as usual " for [MISC Libyan  ] diplomacy and likely represented a hedge should the chairmanship become open , rather than a strong push for a second term . 
3 . 
( C ) The same contact assessed that [LOC Libya  ] was continuing its policy of cash donations to [MISC African  ] countries in order to retain good relations with countries that " hate " [PER Qadhafi  ] 's leadership of the [ORG AU  ] . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] [PER Poloff  ] said he took rumors that [LOC Libya  ] intended to focus on [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Fatah-Hamas  ] reconciliation efforts during its [ORG Arab League  ] presidency as a sign that al-Qadhafi preferred to change course instead of pushing forward an [MISC AU  ] agenda of immediate political union that had made little progress despite two [MISC Libyan-controlled  ] summits . 
( [ORG Hamas  ] leader [PER Khalid Mashal  ] was in [LOC Tripoli  ] for consultations on December 20 . 
) The consensus among [MISC AU-member  ] diplomats polled was that should [LOC Malawi  ] unexpectedly waiver due to [MISC Libyan  ] pressure , that other [ORG Southern Region  ] states that were " fed up " with [PER Qadhafi  ] 's chairmanship would fill the gap , per regional rotation rules . 
4 . 
( C ) Comment: [MISC Pan-African  ] messages feature heavily in the image al-Qadhafi has created for himself . 
State media outlets append " President of the [ORG African Union  ] " to his customary title of " Leader of the Revolution " ( and , less frequently " King of the Traditional Kings of [LOC Africa  ] " ) . 
On a personal level , it is likely al-Qadhafi would like to retain that title ; on a practical level , it is unclear that [LOC Libya  ] intends to pursue that role vigorously given competing concerns . 
Rumors of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's plans for the [ORG AU  ] chairmanship likely will persist barring a strong statement from [LOC Malawi  ] or another [ORG Southern Region  ] member affirming their intent to assume the chairmanship . 
We recommend monitoring [LOC Libya  ] 's moves in both the [ORG AU  ] and [ORG Arab League  ] before approaching high-level officials on al-Qadhafi 's intentions , as providing notice of our high-level interest may have unintended consequences for both our bilateral and multilateral interests .
