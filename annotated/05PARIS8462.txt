End summary . 
Kosovo:Access to Alleged secret detention center --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a December 12 meeting with the Ambassador , [ORG Council of Europe  ] ( [ORG COE  ] ) Secretary General [PER Terry Davis  ] complained of what he described as continued [ORG NATO  ] unresponsiveness to [ORG COE  ] requests for access to [MISC KFOR-run  ] detention centers in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
He claimed he had sent seven separate letters to [ORG NATO  ] SYG de [PER Hoop Sheffer  ] , none of which had elicited a satisfactory response . 
[PER Davis  ] described [LOC Kosovo  ] as a " black hole " for the [ORG COE Committee  ] on the [ORG Prevention of Torture  ] , notwithstanding the fact that the [ORG COE  ] charter gives the organization the right to visit any detention place in member states . 
Given [ORG NATO  ] 's obsructionism , [PER Davis  ] told the Ambassador -- " as a courtesy , " he said -- that he would have no/no choice but to " go public " over the issue in early 2006. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Davis  ] concluded that others , but not he , had begun to " connect the dots " and were speculating that [LOC Kosovo  ] might be a site for secret [ORG CIA  ] prisons free from international scrutiny . 
We note that on November 26 , [ORG Le Monde  ] carried an article in which the [ORG COE  ] 's [ORG Human Rights Commissioner  ] , [PER Alvaro Gil-Robles  ] , is reported as claiming that a September 2002 visit to [PER Camp Bondsteel  ] had given him the impression that it may have served as a detainee camp . 
This story was rebutted the following day in [ORG Le Figaro  ] and [ORG Le Monde  ] by the [MISC French  ] general who was in charge of [ORG KFOR  ] at the time , who stated that all interrogations of suspects at [PER Bondsteel  ] had been conducted in the presence of [ORG NATO  ] -- that is to say , [MISC French  ] -- officers . 
Renditions ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On the renditions issue more broadly , [PER Davis  ] noted that PACE President van der [PER Linden  ] and investigator [PER Marty  ] , rather than he , were addressing the matter for the [ORG COE  ] . 
He assured the Ambassador that he personally viewed the question as one between the [ORG COE  ] and its member states , not between the [ORG CoE  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Davis  ] noted that the [ORG COE  ] had asked [MISC European  ] member state governments , in light of allegations of secret prisons , whether they were in any way involved. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Van  ] der [PER Linden  ] and [PER Dick Marty  ] , for their part , continue to seek to keep the issue alive . 
[PER Marty  ] declared to the press December 13 that he found the allegations of [LOC U.S.  ] renditions credible , even if he allowed that it was still too early " to assert that there had been any involvement or complicity of ( [ORG CoE  ] ) member states in illegal actions . 
" . 
He publicly chastised the [LOC U.S.  ] for failing to provide any " information or explanations , " putting aside any mention of the Secretary 's December 5 statement on the controversy ( ref c ) , which was provided to [PER Marty  ] under a cover letter from Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] on December 7 . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) For any number of reasons , including some that may have more to do with institutional rivalries rather than the issue at hand , van der [PER Linden  ] and [PER Marty  ] appear to have decided to take a much more confrontational , public approach than [PER Davis  ] on the renditions issue . 
The result is that , whatever their motivations , the renditions issue appears likely to stay on the front burner . 
The [ORG PACE Committee  ] on [ORG Legal Affairs and Human Rights  ] announced December 13 that it will ask the [ORG PACE  ] to schedule debate on the issue at the January 23-27 plenary session .
