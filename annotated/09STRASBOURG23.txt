( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG The Council of Europe’s  ] ( [ORG COE  ] ) [ORG Parliamentary Assembly  ] ( [ORG PACE  ] ) elected September 29 [PER Thorbjorn Jagland  ] of [LOC Norway  ] as the new [ORG COE  ] Secretary General . 
The [ORG PACE  ] noted that [LOC Georgia  ] had met most and [LOC Russia  ] had met almost none of their respective [ORG COE  ] commitments post-August 2008 . 
The [ORG PACE  ] rejected , however , a resolution suspending the [MISC Russian  ] delegation’s credentials . 
Visiting former [LOC White House  ] adviser [PER Kathleen McGinty  ] effectively provided [ORG PACE  ] members her views regarding the [LOC U.S.’  ] commitment to fighting climate change ; several members praised [LOC U.S.  ] engagement on the issue in the run-up to [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
[PER Mikhail Gorbachev  ] , speaking at a [ORG COE  ] function October 1 , sharply criticized [ORG NATO  ] enlargement as slowing down the construction of a “Common [MISC European  ] Home.” End summary [PER JAGLAND  ] ELECTED SECGEN - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The election of new [ORG COE  ] Secretary General [PER Thorbjorn Jagland  ] ( former [MISC Norwegian  ] PM and FM and current President of [MISC Norway’s  ] parliament ) was the highlight of the [ORG Parliamentary Assembly  ] of the [ORG Council  ] of [ORG Europe’s  ] ( [ORG PACE  ] ) September 28-October 2 session . 
[PER Jagland  ] noted after the election that “Europe is the greatest peace project ever in history , ” and that the [ORG Council of Europe  ] has been “indispensable in that respect.” [PER Jagland  ] took office October 1 , telling assembled ambassadors that he would pursue reform and that he wanted the [ORG COE  ] to focus more on its key priorities ( democracy , human rights , and the rule of law ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC Polish  ] candidate , rather than show solidarity and grace in defeat by attending [MISC Jagland’s  ] post-election remarks to the [ORG PACE  ] , departed [LOC Strasbourg  ] immediately after the vote’s results became known . 
The [MISC Polish  ] Ambassador complained bitterly to us October 1 , claiming that the “Russophile [PER Jagland”  ] had told the [MISC Russians  ] during his election campaign that he had consistently opposed [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG EU  ] enlargement toward [LOC Russia  ] . 
( Action request for Embassy Oslo: Please provide any information you may have on [MISC Jagland’s  ] views regarding [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG EU  ] enlargement . 
) WORDS BUT NO ACTIONS AGAINST MOSCOW - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [MISC PACE’s  ] discussion of the consequences of the war between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] provided harsher and more widespread criticism of [LOC Russia  ] than at previous sessions . 
The [ORG PACE  ] noted that [LOC Georgia  ] had met most of the [MISC PACE’s  ] demands regarding the situation while [LOC Russia  ] had met almost none of its commitments . 
The [ORG PACE  ] also reiterated its support for [MISC Georgia’s  ] sovereignty and territorial integrity . 
The [ORG PACE  ] rejected , however , a call to suspend the [MISC Russian  ] delegation’s credentials . 
While the [MISC Georgian  ] delegation and several of its [MISC Nordic  ] supporters stressed that the [MISC COE’s  ] credibility is at stake , many [ORG PACE  ] members argued that dialogue , rather than suspension of credentials , is the only way to find a solution between the two countries . 
The [MISC Danish  ] Ambassador , no apologist for [MISC Moscow’s  ] behavior , summed up for us the [MISC COE’s  ] approach to us , “While it’s difficult to work with them , it is impossible to work without them.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A separate discussion on “the situation of human rights defenders and the increasing violence in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] region of the [LOC Russian Federation  ] , ” while less heated , also demonstrated a rift between the [MISC Russian  ] delegation’s analysis and that of most [ORG PACE  ] members . 
Several speakers noted that the [ORG PACE  ] wants to help [LOC Russia  ] address problems , including “a pattern of impunity.” All [MISC Russian  ] speakers noted that , in addition to human rights workers , police and regional and local government officials had also been targeted by bandits and terrorists . 
Throughout the [ORG PACE  ] session , several [ORG PACE  ] members and guests , including [MISC French  ] State Secretary for [MISC European  ] Affairs [PER Pierre Lellouche  ] , also called on [LOC Russia  ] to ratify Protocol 14 to streamline the [ORG European Court of Human Right’s  ] procedures . 
[LOC U.S.  ] SPEAKER: WORKING WITH THE WORLD ON CLIMATE CHANGE - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Former [LOC White House  ] adviser [PER Kathleen McGinty  ] effectively outlined her views of the [ORG Obama Administration’s  ] commitment to fighting climate change to the [ORG PACE’s Environment Committee  ] September 29 . 
[ORG CG  ] underscored the need for all countries , including developing ones , to cut carbon emissions as part of any agreement coming out of the [LOC Copenhagen  ] conference . 
Subsequently , [ORG PACE  ] members welcomed the [LOC U.S.’  ] commitment to fighting climate change , although several noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] is the “world’s largest per capita polluter.” [MISC Nobel Peace Prize  ] winner [PER Rajendra Pachauri  ] joined the plenary debate , nothing the need to review how climate change exacerbates the “energy STRASBOURG 00000023 002.2 OF 002 poverty” affecting “more than two billion people” using biomass for a variety of applications . 
Separately , the [ORG PACE  ] approved a resolution calling on member states to adopt an additional protocol to the [ORG European Convention of Human Rights  ] on the “right to a healthy environment.” The [ORG PACE’s Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee  ] had opposed the resolution and one western ambassador told us the [ORG COE’s Council of Ministers  ] “will bury” the proposal . 
OTHER ISSUES: [ORG OECD  ] , [ORG UN  ] REFORM , GORBY - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG OECD  ] Secretary General [PER Gurria  ] briefed members on the [MISC OECD’s  ] activities to address the financial crisis . 
[ORG PACE  ] passed a largely descriptive resolution on the crisis and the [MISC OECD’s  ] actions while several members called on [PER Gurria  ] to provide a better idea of the “lessons learned” from the crisis . 
The [ORG PACE  ] also passed a resolution on [ORG UN  ] reform that , inter alia , called for the incorporation of a “parliamentary element in UNGA’s structure” and for the non-use of veto power in the [ORG UNSC  ] on human rights issues . 
Finally , former [MISC Soviet  ] leader [PER Mikhail Gorbachev  ] , [ORG European Commission  ] President [ORG Barroso  ] , [MISC Slovene  ] President [PER Turk  ] , and several other [MISC European  ] figures addressed the [MISC COE’s  ] sixtieth anniversary celebration in [LOC Strasbourg  ] October 1 . 
Most praised the vision of the [MISC COE’s  ] founders and the work of the organization . 
[PER Gorbachev  ] , however , while noting many of the [MISC COE’s  ] successes , also stressed that construction of [ORG Europe’s  ] “common home” had been slowed down by NATO’s expansion to the East .
