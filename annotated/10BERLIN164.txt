( C ) [MISC German  ] FM [PER Westerwelle  ] told [PER Amb February  ] 5 that it was important to refocus [LOC Afghanistan  ] efforts on civilian reconstruction ; that we needed to avoid suggesting [MISC German  ] troops engaged in less risk than other countries ; that he did not invite [MISC Iranian  ] FM [PER Mottaki  ] to [LOC Germany  ] or seek a meeting with him ; that any discussion of non-strategic nuclear weapons needed to be conducted at 28 at [ORG NATO  ] ; and that he could not influence any decision by the [ORG European Parliament  ] on the SWIFT agreement . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about [PER Westerwelle  ] 's first 100 days in office . 
Though in an ebullient mood , [PER Westerwelle  ] said things were very difficult ( [ORG FDP  ] slipped another percentage point in the polls hours before the meeting ) . 
He said he had been in [LOC France  ] February 4 for a joint cabinet meeting , but that nothing substantive came of it . 
He observed that one never really knew what was going to happen with [PER Sarkozy  ] involved. -------------- [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador reviewed his own recent trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He shared his impression that the [MISC Germans  ] were doing a superb job at all levels from the [MISC RC-North  ] commander on down . 
He learned how critical mentoring and partnering with [MISC Afghan  ] security forces had become . 
He noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] was sending substantial forces to [MISC RC-North  ] , where they would conduct training and be under [MISC German  ] command . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] responded that this was important for [LOC Germany  ] and for international cooperation . 
The Ambassador added that the [LOC U.S.  ] was sending substantial helicopter support as well . 
He said that [MISC Germans  ] could be proud of their troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] responded that this was good news . 
He said that the [ORG London Conference  ] bore an excellent conclusion , and was particularly useful for its focus on civilian progress . 
He emphasized the importance of underscoring civilian reconstruction. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With a request for confidentiality , [PER Westerwelle  ] referred to the January 20 " [ORG Bild Zeitung  ] " interview with General [PER McChrystal  ] , in which the general is quoted as urging the [MISC Germans  ] to take more risks . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] recounted that he himself had had to answer questions about this article for ten days , explaining that the [MISC Germans  ] were not " peace soldiers " while other countries provided the combat troops . 
He said it was important that [MISC German  ] troops not be " relativized " and cast as second-class troops . 
He observed that [LOC Germany  ] had originally deployed 3,500 troops , increased that mandate to 4,500 , and was now planning an increase of another 500 plus a reserve . 
He emphasized that this was a major contribution compared with other [MISC European  ] countries. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador noted that he had gained the impression in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that police training was more challenging than he had originally understood . 
Troops were usually required to provide force protection . 
But [MISC German  ] police training was the best. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked how the prospective February 26 Bundestag debate to extend the [MISC Bundeswehr  ] mandate in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would play out . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] said the question was how large a majority would approve the new mandate . 
He said that [ORG SPD  ] caucus chief [PER Steinmeier  ] displayed good will on this issue . 
However , [ORG SPD  ] chairman [PER Gabriel  ] wanted to politicize the issue for domestic political gain . 
Nevertheless , he thought some in the [ORG SPD  ] would support the new mandate . 
However , [PER Westerwelle  ] expected no support from the [ORG Greens  ] . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] noted that the May NRW state elections were also affecting the issue in a negative way . 
That said , he said he could not see [PER Steinmeier  ] opposing the larger mandate . 
He hoped the Ambassador would speak with [ORG Steinmeier.  ] ------ [LOC IRAN  ] ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Asked about the February 5 visit of [MISC Iranian  ] FM [PER Mottaki  ] to the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] , [PER Westerwelle  ] emphasized that he ( [PER Westerwelle  ] ) had not invited [PER Mottaki  ] to come to [LOC Germany  ] , and [PER Westerwelle  ] had also not requested a meeting with [PER Mottaki  ] . 
Rather , it was [PER Mottaki  ] who was asking to see [PER Westerwelle  ] . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] said he had still not decided whether he would talk to [PER Mottaki  ] or not . 
He reflected concern that [LOC Tehran  ] might try to exploit [PER Mottaki  ] 's visit to [LOC Germany  ] as a distraction , and continue executing people during the visit . 
In any case , [PER Westerwelle  ] said his position was exactly the same as the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Iran  ] , and he would share the results of any meeting with [PER Mottaki  ] , if it took place . 
[LOC BERLIN  ] 00000164 002 OF 002 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Westerwelle  ] said he would meet [MISC Russian  ] FM Lavrov and ( separately ) [MISC Chinese  ] FM [PER Yang  ] February 5 . 
He suggested that [LOC Moscow  ] had been changing course on [LOC Iran  ] sanctions since the [LOC Qom  ] revelations . 
The [MISC Russians  ] now saw [LOC Iran  ] as playing games on the nuclear issue . 
However , he observed that [LOC China  ] was " hesitant , " or even in opposition to sanctions . 
Reflecting on his recent visit to [LOC China  ] , [PER Westerwelle  ] said he had not perceived any " good will " there at present . 
He said he would ask [PER Yang  ] again about [LOC Iran  ] and then share the results with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Westerwelle  ] opined that it was important also to focus on [LOC Brazil  ] as an opinion leader in the [MISC Third World  ] . 
He noted that President [PER Lula  ] had received [PER Ahmadinejad  ] warmly several months ago . 
He added that he was uncertain what the [MISC Saudis  ] thought , but that the other [MISC Persian Gulf  ] countries seemed to be in an existential panic about the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program. ----------- [ORG TAC NUKES  ] ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Touching briefly on arms control , [PER Westerwelle  ] stated unequivocally that tactical nuclear weapons was an issue for [ORG NATO  ] . 
He said that when he had received [PER Kissinger  ] , [PER Schulz  ] , [PER Perry  ] and [PER Nunn  ] on February 3 to talk about their global zero proposal , tactical nuclear weapons was not discussed . 
He said that the four statesmen were very supportive of President [PER Obama.  ] ---------- [ORG TFTP  ] --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised the challenge of getting the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] to approve an agreement to share data with the [LOC U.S.  ] on tracking terrorist finance . 
The Ambassador noted the extensive efforts of the [ORG Treasury Department  ] and other [LOC U.S.  ] agencies to explain the importance of the program to our common security . 
He asked how one could get better support for the program . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] replied that the [MISC German  ] government had been able to come up with a solution for itself a few months ago when the issue first surfaced . 
( Comment: In fact , [MISC German  ] Interior Minister [PER de Maziere  ] 's vote to abstain in the [ORG EU Council  ] vote on [ORG TFTP  ] on November 30 reflected the complete deadlock within the [ORG Coalition Government  ] between [ORG TFTP  ] advocates in the [MISC CDU-controlled  ] [ORG Interior Ministry  ] and [ORG TFTP  ] opponents in the [MISC FDP-controlled  ] [ORG Justice Ministery  ] . 
End Comment . 
) However , [PER Westerwelle  ] said that now that the issue was in the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] , he had no ability to influence it . 
He said that he was very , very aware of the Secretary 's interest in this issue . 
Nevertheless , he had a sense that almost all groups in the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] had concerns with the proposed agreement . 
He emphasized that this was not an issue that only concerned his party , the [ORG FDP  ] , but rather many others as well. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Westerwelle  ] shared that he had not yet appointed a new Coordinator for [MISC German-American  ] cooperation. ---------- COMMENT --------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Westerwelle  ] ( who spoke with ease in [MISC English  ] ) was in a buoyant mood and more confident on his issues than we have seen him so far . 
He seemed ready to defend any intimation that he was less than supportive of a troop surge ( Defense Minister [PER zu Guttenberg  ] told the Ambassador two days ago that [PER Westerwelle  ] had worked for no increase of [MISC German  ] troops for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , see [LOC Berlin  ] 157 ) with invocations of the importance of civilian reconstruction . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , he leapt at the chance to tell us he had not invited [PER Mottaki  ] . 
His dodges on both tactical nuclear weapons and terrorist finance were all but practiced . 
His comment that he was unable to affect the vote in the [ORG EU Parliament  ] on [ORG TFTP  ] was a bit disingenuous ; on February 4 , an [ORG MFA  ] official acknowledged to visiting [ORG Treasury  ] officials in [LOC Berlin  ] that [MISC German  ] MEPs were in fact leading the charge against [ORG TFTP  ] in the [ORG EU Parliament  ] with the tacit support of the [ORG FDP  ] , if not of specialists in the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] and [ORG MFA  ] themselves . 
[PER Westerwelle  ] still cuts a good image in meetings and in the press here , even though his party continues a bout of free fall in the polls . 
His ministry , though , still wonders ( privately to us ) where he gets his policy direction from . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Ambassador did not have the chance to clear this cable before departing [LOC Berlin  ] .
