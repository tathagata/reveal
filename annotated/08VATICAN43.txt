( C ) Ambassador , accompanied by the Deputy Chief of Mission , met May 31 with Monsignor [PER Pietro Parolin  ] , the [LOC Holy See  ] 's Undersecretary for Relations with [MISC States  ] ( Deputy FM equivalent ) to discourage the [LOC Holy See  ] from granting [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] a Papal audience during his visit to [LOC Rome  ] for the [ORG FAO  ] summit . 
[PER Parolin  ] said the [LOC Holy See  ] always finds it difficult to say no to a request for an audience from a head of state , and that the [LOC Holy See  ] 's preference is always for dialogue . 
Nevertheless , he confirmed that [PER Pope Benedict  ] would not see [PER Ahmadinejad  ] during his stay in [LOC Rome  ] , but the reason given will be " technical " , having to do with the fact that so many heads of state wanted to see the [PER Pope  ] in the brief period during the [MISC FAO Summit  ] . 
Not being able to accommodate them all , but not wanting to show favoritism , the [PER Pope  ] decided not to see any of the leaders . 
[PER Parolin  ] also confirmed that there would not be any group meeting with the visiting heads of state . 
Asked about the possibility of a future papal audience for [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [PER Parolin  ] said the [LOC Holy See  ] 's impression is that he may find it difficult ( for internal reasons ) to get permission to leave the country for such a visit. ------------------------------------------- [ORG Holy See Press Office  ] Affirms " No " Decision ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On Tuesday , June 3 , the [ORG Holy See 's Press Office  ] released a statement confirming that contrary to " certain journalistic suppositions " circulating in the media , [PER Pope Benedict  ] would be unable to agree to meet with any of the requests for private audiences he received from heads of state who were visiting [LOC Rome  ] for the [ORG FAO Summit  ] . 
The reason provided was " the number of requests , the limited time available , and prior commitments.' 
The statement indicated that Cardinal Secretary of State [ORG Bertone  ] had written each leader personally informing them of the [ORG Holy Father  ] 's disappointment at the impossibility of meeting on this occasion and reaffirming his willingness to receive them on a future occasion . 
The statement also mentioned that this has been the [LOC Holy See  ] 's practice since April 2006 .
