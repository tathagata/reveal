END SUMMARY. --------------------------- A TALE OF ROYAL PROPORTIONS --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] major institutions and processes of the [MISC Moroccan  ] state are used by the Palace to coerce and solicit bribes in the real estate sector . 
While corrupt practices existed during the reign of [MISC King Hassan II  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , they have become much more institutionalized with [MISC King Mohammed VI  ] . 
Institutions such as the royal family 's holding company , [ORG Omnium Nord Africaine  ] ( [ORG ONA  ] ) , which now clears most large development projects , regularly coerce developers into granting beneficial rights to [ORG ONA  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG ONA  ] 's [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reportedly told his interlocutors that [LOC Morocco  ] 's major investment decisions were effectively made by three individuals: the [LOC King  ] , [LOC Fouad El  ] [PER Himma  ] the former Deputy Minister of Interior who now leads the [ORG Palace-backed Party of Authenticity and Modernity  ] , and [PER Mohamed Mounir Al Majidi  ] , who is the head of the [MISC King 's  ] private secretariat and his principal financial advisor .

( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's experience demonstrate a reality , of which most [MISC Moroccans  ] dare only whisper -- the influence and commercial interest of the [LOC King  ] and some of his advisors in virtually every major real estate project here . 
A former [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to the [LOC Morocco  ] , who remains closely connected to the Palace , separately lamented to us what he termed the appalling greed of those close to [MISC King Mohammed VI  ] . 
This phenomenon seriously undermines the good governance that the [MISC Moroccan  ] government is working hard to promote .
