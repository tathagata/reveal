ASTANA 65 B. ASTANA 225 Classified By: AMBASSADOR ORDWAY FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) 1 . 
( C ) On January 15 , [ORG KazMunaiGas First Vice  ] President [PER Maskat Idenov  ] expelled from a meeting [ORG Chevron  ] executives [PER Guy Hollingsworth  ] , President for [ORG Chevron Eurasia  ] , [LOC Europe  ] , and [LOC Middle East Exploration  ] and Production , and [PER James Johnson  ] , [ORG Chevron Eurasia Strategic Business Unit Managing  ] Director . 
In press reports , an unnamed source stated that the two were thrown out of the meeting because of “improper comments on [MISC Kashagan  ] negotiations and disrespectful conduct towards [ORG KazMunaiGas  ] management.” [PER Johnson  ] told us later that the incident occurred at the end of a meeting that had gone generally well , and resulted from an innocent issue over the newly-arrived [PER Johnson  ] not having his cell phone number handy to exchange with [PER Idenov  ] . 
[PER Idenov  ] , s version of the conversation was heavy with descriptions of [PER Hollingsworth  ] &pounding on the table8 and [PER Johnson  ] slowly tapping a business card on the table while telling [PER Idenov  ] all he needed was his secretary , s phone number . 
[PER Idenov  ] almost immediately sent a letter of protest to [ORG Chevron  ] CEO [PER Dave O  ] , [PER Reilly  ] , and faxed ( twice ) a cc to the Ambassador . 
Knowledge of the incident , and the letter , have been the talk of the diplomatic and business community ever since , with sources ranging from the [MISC Indian  ] Ambassador to the local [ORG ABN Amro  ] chief raising it with the Ambassador. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In subsequent conversations with the Ambassador and [ORG Eurasian Energy Diplomacy  ] Coordinator [PER Steve Mann  ] , [PER Idenov  ] emphasized that his actions were not an indication of poor relations with [ORG Chevron  ] . 
In both conversations , [PER Idenov  ] amplified his anger with [PER Hollingsworth  ] by explaining that [PER Hollingsworth  ] does not understand &how we are doing business now8 ) followed immediately by a detailed recitation of [PER Hollingsworth  ] , s extensive contacts with [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] in locations ranging from the [LOC Astana  ] golf course to the beach in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
What really appears to be at issue here is [PER Idenov  ] demonstrating that he , not [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] , is now the &go to8 guy in [MISC Kazakhstani  ] oil and gas . 
[PER Idenov  ] , the chief negotiator for [LOC Kazakhstan  ] on [MISC Kashagan  ] , is now &number 1A8 at [LOC KMG  ] , according to one international oil company representative . 
Under restructuring at [LOC KMG  ] , all employees report to [PER Idenov  ] , and only [PER Idenov  ] to [ORG KMG  ] President [PER Uzakbay Karabalin  ] . 
The ascendant [PER Idenov  ] appears determined to show the international majors that they need to deal with him . 
In an early stage of the [MISC Kashagan  ] negotiations , he tossed some less senior [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] representatives out of a meeting to deliver the message that he should be dealing with the upper levels of [ORG KMG  ] , s corporate partners . 
In the case of [ORG Chevron  ] , he felt secure enough to throw out of a meeting executives from one of [MISC Kazakhstan’s  ] biggest money-makers . 
It is difficult to imagine that any [ORG KMG  ] official would have so criticized [PER Kulibayev  ] , even in private to [MISC American  ] diplomats , if he were not very confident of his position. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) One very substantive aspect of determining who , s on top is related to the oil pipeline that must be built to connect [MISC Kashagan  ] ( and [LOC Tengiz  ] ) to the planned trans-Caspian oil terminal in [LOC Kurik  ] . 
Both [PER Hollingsworth  ] and Prime Minister [PER Masimov  ] have told the Ambassador that discussions are underway to make this pipeline project a joint project between the [ORG GOK/KMG  ] and [ORG Chevron  ] . 
[PER Masimov  ] has noted that the [MISC Kashagan  ] companies , the natural partners for such a pipeline , have been unable to agree on how to do this despite several years of trying . 
[ORG Chevron  ] , which is not involved with [MISC Kashagan  ] , has a major interest in additional transportation routes for [LOC Tengiz  ] crude ) which it is 100 percent responsible for marketing . 
The proposed pipeline would run right past the [LOC Tengiz  ] field on its way to the terminal ; even a 25 percent [ORG Chevron  ] share would give them an inside track at getting their crude into that pipeline if there were capacity problems with both [MISC Kashagan  ] and [LOC Tengiz  ] volumes . 
[PER Idenov  ] , by contrast , told the Ambassador and [PER Mann  ] that [ORG KMG  ] would build the pipeline &100 percent by ourselves8 and conclude commercial contracts with the [MISC Kashagan  ] shippers to transport their oil . 
He specifically said that it would be a violation of business principles to cut the [MISC Kashagan  ] partners out of the process of determining how to build the pipeline ) a direct swipe at the [ORG Chevron  ] proposal . 
To make this mix even more complicated , [ORG ExxonMobil  ] country rep told [PER Mann  ] that his company was working with [ORG KMG  ] on a new legal basis to build the pipeline that would allow the [MISC Kashagan  ] partners to share ownership. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Idenov’s actions are designed not only to demonstrate that he , s up , but that [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] is down , if not actually out . 
We had already concluded that [PER Kulibayev  ] , s influence in the oil and gas sector had been significantly reduced with his removal late last year from a senior executive position at [LOC Samruk  ] , the state holding company that owns [ORG KMG  ] . 
Shortly after [PER Kulibayev  ] was fired , [PER Hollingsworth  ] told us that [PER Kulibayev  ] had explained ( during a golf game ) that it was the desire of the President to &protect8 him from responsibility for the [MISC Kashagan  ] negotiations if they went wrong . 
This appears to be somewhat self-serving: A former [ORG USG  ] official told the Ambassador that she had been at a dinner in [LOC Astana  ] with the CEO of [LOC Samruk  ] , [PER Kanat Bozumbayev  ] , immediately after [PER Kulibayev  ] lost his position . 
According to [PER Bozumbayev  ] , he had been instructed to personally deliver the news of the firing to [PER Kulibayev  ] , who appeared to have no inkling that it was going to happen . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Kulibayev  ] is still the head of [LOC Kazenergy  ] , the semi-official trade group , and has obvious links to key government officials , including his father-in-law , the President . 
[PER Kulibayev  ] is by all accounts a very savvy and effective businessman . 
[ORG Samruk Board  ] Chairman [PER Richard Evans  ] ( retired CEO of [LOC BAE  ] ) , told the Ambassador that [PER Kulibayev  ] was the one real businessman he had met in the entire [LOC Samruk  ] structure . 
Our guess is that [PER Nazarbayev  ] , in the aftermath of the [PER Rakhat Aliyev  ] affair , decided to minimize risks to him and his reputation by removing all of his close relatives from major government positions .
