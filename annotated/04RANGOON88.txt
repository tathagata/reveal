( [ORG S/NF  ] ) An expatriate businessmanXXXXXXXXXXXX recently volunteered to an Embassy Officer that he had heard rumors that a nuclear reactor was being built near [LOC Minbu  ] , in central [ORG Magway Division  ] on the [LOC Irawaddy River  ] . 
The businessman added that he personally had seen a “massive” barge containing large-sized rebar being unloaded on a trip to the area . 
After asking local residents about the rebar’s purpose , he was told that similar size barge shipments were arriving almost weekly and that the rebar was to be used in the construction of unnamed/unidentified factories . 
In the opinion of the businessman , the quantities involved as well as the diameter of the rebar suggested a project larger than “factories.” Along these lines , the businessman noted that there was a new airport near [LOC Minbu  ] with a landing strip that , based on its length and thickness , seemed excessive , adding that “you could land the space shuttle on it.” <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Comment:  ] Rumors of construction of a nuclear facility in/near [ORG Magway Division  ] date back to 2002 and generally refer to alleged Goverment of [LOC Burma  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) and [MISC Russian  ] cooperation on a nuclear research reactor project . 
Similar rumors , sans the “Russia” angle , have been circulating with greater frequency within diplomatic and expatriate circles since a November 2003 [MISC Far Eastern Economic Review  ] ( [ORG FEER  ] ) article which described signs of growing military ties between [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Burma  ] . 
While we have no direct evidence of this alleged cooperation , rumors of ongoing construction of a nuclear reactor are surprisingly consistent and observations of activity such as that described above appear to be increasing , as are alleged sightings of [MISC North Korean  ] “technicians” inside [LOC Burma  ] .
