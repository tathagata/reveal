( U ) All public and official signs are that the [ORG GoB  ] still feels solid self-satisfaction over its performance at [LOC Cancun  ] . 
It displays zero compunction over [LOC Cancun  ] 's collapse or the possible damage to the [ORG WTO  ] 's future , while reaffirming that the [ORG WTO  ] remains the planet 's indispensable multi-lateral trade-policy forum . 
This general sentiment seems to reign across the spectrum of [MISC Brazilian  ] opinion , aside from a few muted worries or warnings by independent commentators . 
The common if vague [MISC Brazilian  ] sense is that the G-21 's actions constituted an overdue , laudably successful demand to be taken seriously , and that any adverse reaction by the [LOC U.S.  ] or [ORG EU  ] simply demonstrates that the rich-country club is loath to accept developing countries' standing up to defend their rights. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [ORG USTR  ] [PER Zoellick  ] 's September 22 Financial Times opinion column ( " [LOC America  ] will not wait for the won't-do countries " ) unquestionably hit a sensitive spot . 
It was published the next day in [MISC Portuguese  ] translation by top circulation daily `Folha de [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , ' and no-one in the [ORG GoB  ] pretended to doubt that [ORG USTR  ] 's criticisms were aimed squarely at [LOC Brazil  ] . 
However , those criticisms from abroad have had no evident effect in swaying [MISC Brazilian  ] opinion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) If anything , official reaction to the column has just further tightened the [ORG GoB  ] 's rhetorical ranks . 
Finance Minister [PER Palocci:  ] " [LOC Brazil  ] has been characterized in this episode and in others by a clear will to negotiate . 
There is no reason to doubt the decision , the will , and the potential of [LOC Brazil  ] and its partners in the negotiations . 
" Agriculture Minister [PER Rodrigues:  ] " [PER Zoellick  ] 's statement was a mistake . 
" Development Minister [PER Furlan:  ] " [LOC Brazil  ] is simply putting its interest on the table , knowing that a negotiation means give and take . 
" Less restrainedly on the non-government side , [ORG Folha  ] columnist [PER Clovis Rossi  ] summed up that " [PER Zoellick  ] 's op-ed is an open declaration of war on [LOC Brazil  ] , with the explicit threat of leaving the country behind in trade negotiations . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] himself , in an official release , responded unrepentantly to the [ORG USTR  ] op-ed , inter alia by saying that " Having maintained a constructive position , [LOC Brazil  ] does not consider it useful to be involved in an exercise of blame over the difficulty of reaching consensus in [LOC Cancun  ] . 
" See full substantive text of the [ORG Itamaraty  ] release below at [LOC Para 10  ] . 
Media have since quoted [PER Amorim  ] as asserting that " ( i ) f someone changed , it was the [LOC United States  ] and not [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The position defended by [LOC Brazil  ] in [LOC Cancun  ] coincides 70% to 80% with the earlier [LOC U.S.  ] position . 
" ( NOTE: presumably referring to specific agricultural issues such as export-subsidy phase-out . 
END NOTE . 
) President [PER Lula  ] is reported to have publicly echoed this assertion on September 25 in [LOC New York.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The [MISC Brazilians  ] continue to declare that [LOC Cancun  ] has not altered the [ORG WTO  ] 's status as the world 's legitimate , necessary forum for multilateral trade negotiations . 
The [ORG Itamaraty  ] release includes the declaration: " From [LOC Brazil  ] 's perspective , what is most important now is , in accordance with the declaration approved in [LOC Cancun  ] by the ministers , to promptly resume the negotiations in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
" FM [PER Amorim  ] repeatedly asserted in his September 17 testimony to [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] that resumption of [ORG WTO  ] and Doha-Round business as usual may at worst suffer a six or twelve-month delay ( Ref B ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) FM [PER Amorim  ] as well as presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Marco Aurlio Garcia  ] have also gone out of their way to deny that the [ORG GoB  ] 's trade-policy course is a product of any " anti-American " bias . 
[PER Amorim  ] told [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] that " the relationship between [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] has never been as good as now , " and that official and unofficial sources confide to him that President [PER Bush  ] " has only made praiseworthy references to [PER Lula  ] . 
" [PER Amorim  ] seemed to dismiss the notion that [LOC Cancun  ] will have far-reaching consequences for trade talks or relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , saying that occasional criticisms during trade and political talks are just " part of the game . 
" ( Ref B . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) In like vein , top national dailies made much of the report that , just one day after [ORG USTR  ] 's criticism of [LOC Brazil  ] 's position at [LOC Cancun  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Treasury Secretary [PER Snow  ] spoke to [MISC Brazilian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Palocci  ] in [LOC Dubai  ] in complimentary tones . 
" We spoke about [LOC Cancun  ] , and ( [PER Snow  ] ) made it very clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] government will continue with its multilateral agenda of trade negotiations , and that they have great interest in keeping a close cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] , " [PER Palocci  ] was quoted repeatedly. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There are a few well-informed exceptions to the breezy trend . 
Aside from the occasional media commentator warning that [LOC Brazil  ] will be left behind in a future process of bilateral trade negotiations , these include [ORG Itamaraty  ] U/S for [ORG WTO  ] [PER Clodoaldo Hugueney  ] . 
Over lunch with us on September 25 , [PER Hugueney  ] left no doubt that he felt " the [LOC Doha  ] train had been derailed , " due , in his judgment , to poor preparation that had left the [ORG WTO  ] leadership badly unaware of the state of play over [LOC Singapore  ] issues . 
[PER Hugueney  ] said he believed that , were it not for the abrupt [MISC Singapore-issue  ] fiasco , [LOC Cancun  ] could have produced an agricultural paper " albeit with brackets " that could have met minimum Doha-Round needs . 
Now , it was hard to see how a way out or forward could be found , he opined. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In public , the [ORG GoB  ] front remains united behind [ORG Itamaraty  ] , but there is the occasional suggestion of dissension in the ranks . 
One post-Cancun media article has referred to Ministers [PER Furlan  ] , [PER Palocci  ] and [ORG Rodrigues  ] lining up against [ORG Itamaraty  ] over a specific trade-policy issue at a recent meeting of the [ORG CAMEX  ] . 
Supposedly , they rejected [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's advocacy that [LOC Brazil  ] unilaterally revise its schedule for submission of [ORG FTAA  ] offers . 
It was not plain from the article whether the offers in question are ones [LOC Brazil  ] has already made , on schedule , or ones for the well- known areas vis-a-vis which [LOC Brazil  ] is already months behind the [ORG FTAA  ] timetable. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Following is the [ORG Itamaraty  ] release responding to [ORG USTR  ] [PER Zoellick  ] 's September 22 opinion piece in the [ORG Financial Times  ] . 
( [PER Begin  ] text ) In regard to the article published today ( . 
) by the [ORG U.S. Trade Representative  ] ( [ORG USTR  ] ) , about the results of the [ORG Fifth Ministerial Conference  ] of the [ORG World Trade Organization  ] ( [ORG WTO  ] ) - in which [LOC Brazil  ] is explicitly cited five times - Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] has the following comments to make: -- each country has the right to present its own evaluation of [LOC Cancun  ] ; -- [LOC Brazil  ] , secure that it maintained a constructive position , does not consider it useful to get involved in the attribution of guilt over the difficulties in reaching a consensus in [LOC Cancun  ] ; -- [LOC Brazil  ] would rather focus on strengthening the [ORG WTO  ] , in coordination with trade partners that are interested in the liberalization of agricultural trade and in the elimination of subsidies , according to the [LOC Doha  ] mandate ; -- if the explicit references to [LOC Brazil  ] reflect the importance that is attributed to our performance in the [ORG WTO  ] , this criticism , either implicit or explicit , comes in contrast with the comments made by the [ORG USTR  ] to the head of the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation - on the eve of the closing of the conference - that the declaration made just hours before in the name of the [MISC G-20  ] " plus " had been " businesslike , " which constituted in and of itself a positive indication ; -- this criticism is also surprising because , until recently , the [LOC United States  ] shared in large measure the same level of ambition expressed by the [MISC G-20  ] " plus " in regard to the three pillars of agricultural trade reform ; -- from [LOC Brazil  ] 's perspective , what is most important now is , in accordance with the declaration approved in [LOC Cancun  ] by the ministers , to promptly resume the negotiations in [LOC Geneva  ] ; -- [LOC Brazil  ] will continue to commit itself to building genuine consensus leading towards the legitimate aspirations of all participants , especially developing countries . 
( End Text of Statement ) COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We judge there to be little chance in coming weeks of the [ORG GoB  ] repenting or reforming its recent [LOC Cancun  ] actions and current trade-policy attitude . 
Ill-advised and ultimately damaging to [LOC Brazil  ] itself though they may prove , those actions and attitude have not been a matter of caprice . 
They have evolved consistently from the stew of [ORG GoB  ] priorities and considerations -- political , social , developmental as well as " just " commercial -- which we tried to describe in detail last July in Ref C , and recently updated in Ref [PER A. Politically  ] , [PER Lula  ] , FM [PER Amorim  ] and [ORG Congress  ] alike for now perceive this as a sure domestic and international winner. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We credit the [ORG GoB  ] with believing its own rhetoric that it will be better to delay than to accept a " bad " deal , i.e. , one insufficiently attentive to their demands . 
Implicit in its position is the assumption that trade talks cannot move forward without [LOC Brazil  ] , that , in effect , the latter has a kind of veto on real progress . 
One positive aspect to underline is that , despite what we do see as tinges of 1970s ideological antipathy amongst the professional castes of [ORG Itamaraty  ] , [ORG GoB  ] actions are not/not being propelled by anti-U.S. antagonism . 
On the contrary: the [ORG GoB  ] is unrealistically counting on being able to both have its cake and eat it -- to stand up to the rich nations with developing- country demands , while paying little or no price in terms either of the [ORG WTO  ] 's future effectiveness or of overall bilateral relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC VIRDEN</pre></code>  ]
