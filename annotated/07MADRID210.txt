[PER Eduardo Aguirre  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] called Ambassador [PER Aguirre February  ] 7 to discuss [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] in advance of the February 8-9 [ORG NATO  ] ministerial in [LOC Sevilla  ] . 
The Ambassador had previously spoken with Defense Minister [PER Alonso  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor Casajuana  ] on the same subject ( reftel ) , and [PER Moratinos  ] was returning the Ambassador 's call. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) The Ambassador told [PER Moratinos  ] that both he and [LOC Washington  ] were disappointed by President [PER Zapatero  ] 's decision not to increase [LOC Spain  ] 's troop commitment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He noted that it was the [ORG Department 's  ] understanding after [PER Moratinos  ] and Secretary [PER Rice  ] met in [LOC Paris  ] January 25 that [LOC Spain  ] would be willing to be a more active partner in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The Ambassador also told [PER Moratinos  ] that the GOS should not interpret the Embassy 's current silence in the media as in any way diminishing our disappointment with the decision. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Moratinos  ] replied that he believed there must have been a misunderstanding from the [LOC Paris  ] meeting , saying that he intended simply to underscore [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to [ORG NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] and the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He had not meant to suggest that the [LOC U.S.  ] could count on a [MISC Spanish  ] expansion of its forces. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Turning to the Ambassador 's initial comments , [PER Moratinos  ] said that the [LOC United States  ] at times seemed to highlight the negative aspects of the bilateral relationship as it saw fit and often failed to focus on the positive . 
He outlined [LOC Spain  ] 's robust development assistance and military commitments to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including infrastructure and training programs . 
He argued that [LOC Spain  ] is one of the lead contributors in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and he said that such commitments should underscore President [PER Zapatero  ] 's commitment both to [ORG NATO  ] and to [ORG ISAF  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] suggested that no one is giving [LOC Spain  ] credit for what it has done thus far. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) After clarifying that he was only offering his personal opinion without instructions , [PER Moratinos  ] speculated that the situation might have been different had Secretary [PER Rice  ] been able to visit in the fall of 2006 as initially planned , as she could have pressed President [PER Zapatero  ] on the importance of the mission . 
He expressed chagrin at the fact that the Secretary had not visited [LOC Spain  ] and suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] only treated [LOC Spain  ] as a first world [ORG NATO  ] ally when convenient . 
The Ambassador replied that the Secretary maintains an unquestionably professional schedule and reiterated that the postponement of the fall 2006 visit was unavoidable . 
He did not mention the possibility of a March visit , but he reiterated USG disappointment with [LOC Spain  ] 's decision. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) COMMENT: [PER Moratinos  ] , who waited several hours to return the Ambassador 's call , had clearly prepared and scripted his message . 
Noticeably agitated , he took to the offensive , whereas [PER Alonso  ] made clear his unhappiness with [PER Zapatero  ] 's decision and [ORG Casajuana  ] expressed greater understanding and sympathy with our position .
