Key Points -- ( [ORG SBU  ] ) U.S.- [LOC Egypt  ] military relationship is strong , but should change to reflect new regional and transnational threats. -- ( [ORG SBU  ] ) More focus is needed on combating emerging threats , including border security , counter terrorism , civil defense , and peacekeeping. -- ( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] continues to improve efforts to combat arms smuggling into [LOC Gaza  ] , but a decision by [ORG Field Marshal Tantawi  ] to delay a counter tunneling project threatens progress. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: General Schwartz  ] , welcome to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Since our [ORG Foreign Military Financing  ] ( [ORG FMF  ] ) program began almost 30 years ago , our strong military relationship has supported peace between [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] and ensured critical [LOC Suez Canal  ] and overflight access for [LOC U.S.  ] military operations . 
The relationship , however , should now change to reflect new regional and transnational security threats . 
In [LOC FY2009  ] , [ORG Congress  ] removed conditions on [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
We and the [ORG GOE  ] will be able to make the best case for continuing a robust [ORG FMF  ] program by targeting funding for shared priorities like peacekeeping and border security , and must take more action on emerging regional security threats such as piracy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary continued . 
Your visit comes as [LOC Egypt  ] continues its efforts to mediate a permanent cease-fire between [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] , to facilitate intra-Palestinian negotiations to form a new , interim government , and to stop the smuggling of arms into [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Many [MISC Egyptians  ] see the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration as a cause for cautious optimism in both the bilateral relationship and in [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with the region . 
Special Envoy for the [LOC Middle East  ] Senator [PER George Mitchell  ] has visited [LOC Egypt  ] and the region twice and will likely return to [LOC Cairo  ] in April . 
Your visit will fall on the anniversary of the April 6 , 2008 nation-wide strike protesting political and economic conditions . 
At least one opposition group has called for another April 6 strike this year . 
We have requested meetings for you with Chief of [ORG Staff Lieutenant General  ] [PER Sami Anan  ] and [ORG Air Marshal  ] [PER Reda  ] . 
End summary. ----------------------------------------- [ORG Mil-Mil Cooperation: Ready  ] for Next Level ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] and military leaders view our military assistance program as the cornerstone of our mil-mil relationship and consider the USD 1.3 billion in annual [ORG FMF  ] as “untouchable compensation” for making and maintaining peace with [LOC Israel  ] . 
The tangible benefits to our mil-mil relationship are clear: [LOC Egypt  ] remains at peace with [LOC Israel  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] military enjoys priority access to the [LOC Suez Canal  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] airspace . 
We believe , however , that our relationship can accomplish much more . 
Over the last year , we have engaged [ORG MOD  ] leaders on developing shared strategic objectives to address current and emerging threats , including border security , counter terrorism , civil defense , and peacekeeping . 
Our efforts thus far have met with limited success. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Decision-making within [ORG MOD  ] rests almost solely with Minister of [ORG Defense Field Marshal Tantawi  ] . 
In office since 1991 , he consistently resists change to the level and direction of [ORG FMF  ] funding and is therefore one of the chief impediments to transforming our security relationship . 
During his tenure , the tactical and operational readiness of the [MISC Egyptian  ] Armed Forces ( [ORG EAF  ] ) has degraded . 
But he retains President [PER Mubarak’s support  ] , and so he and the top brass will most likely stay in position until [PER Mubarak  ] leaves the scene . 
[PER COS Anan  ] will welcome the lack of conditions on [MISC Egyptian  ] assistance in FY 2009 funding and will seek support in convincing [ORG Congress  ] of [ORG Egypt’s  ] strategic importance . 
[PER Anan  ] should be reassured that [LOC Egypt  ] remains a key [LOC U.S.  ] ally , but stress that given the current economic downturn , [LOC Egypt  ] should do more to justify continuing value by demonstrating through action its support for our shared regional security goals <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) One way to demonstrate [ORG Egypt’s  ] continued strategic importance is through shifting more [ORG FMF  ] funding to address asymmetric threats like terrorism and improving border security along its long and porous borders . 
We should also stress that our mil-mil relationship is much greater than the yearly flow of military assistance . 
[LOC Egypt  ] could play a more active and influential role in regional security issues , including supporting and training the [MISC Iraqi  ] military , deploying more peacekeeping troops to [LOC Sudan  ] , joining neighbors in combating piracy , and stemming the flow of illegal migration . 
Another concrete display of a forward-looking security strategy would be to support CENTCOM’s efforts to re-invent [ORG Bright Star  ] . 
[PER Anan  ] may lament the loss of large-scale [ORG Bright Stars  ] . 
We should stress that [ORG Bright Star  ] continues to be an important strategic statement for the [LOC U.S.  ] and its regional allies , and solicit his input for ways to make [ORG Bright Star  ] more relevant. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Both [PER Anan  ] and [PER Reda  ] will express concern over releasability issues and frustration with [ORG Egypt’s  ] inability to procure restricted weapons systems . 
Some systems are not releasable because of [MISC Egyptian  ] refusal to sign the necessary agreement ( [ORG CISMOA  ] ) providing end-use assurances and ensuring proper protection of certain [LOC U.S.  ] origin technology . 
Releasability is of special concern to the [ORG EAF  ] as they prepare to purchase 24 [MISC F-16  ] aircraft that will require a costly retrofit with less-advanced weapons systems . 
Since 2006 , the [ORG Department of State  ] has notified [ORG Congress  ] of six potential end-use violations by the [MISC Egyptian  ] military . 
We are currently investigating two additional cases , one involving the visit of a [MISC Chinese  ] military official to an [MISC F-16  ] facility on an [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] base . 
Other systems are either not releasable to any country or denied for political reasons , mainly due to concerns regarding [ORG Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) . 
We should stress that decisions to release advanced weapons system are made on a country-by-country basis , but signing a [ORG CISMOA  ] and expanding cooperation on current regional threats would be welcomed steps to our dialogue on releasability. ----------------------------------- Israel-Palestine , Counter Smuggling ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The election of President [PER Obama  ] generated much optimism in [LOC Egypt  ] and hopes that the new administration would quickly focus on problems in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
In particular , the [MISC Egyptian  ] leadership wants the [LOC U.S.  ] to urgently address the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict , and Senator [PER Mitchell  ] has assured them that the Administration will press hard for progress . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] have traditionally served as an intermediary between us , the [MISC Israelis  ] , and the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
Since the January 2008 [ORG Hamas  ] breach of the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border , the [MISC Egyptian  ] role has shifted to focus on intra-Palestinian reconciliation and the establishment of a lasting [MISC Hamas-Israel  ] cease-fire . 
EGIS Chief [PER Soliman  ] has worked to cement a [MISC Israeli-Hamas  ] cease-fire but believes he was badly undercut by the [MISC Israeli  ] introduction of the release of IDF Corporal [PER Gilad Shalit  ] as a new pre-condition for the cease-fire . 
For the moment , rocket strikes from [LOC Gaza  ] are relatively low in frequency. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Egyptian  ] security forces continue to improve counter-smuggling efforts along the [LOC Gaza  ] border and further afield , through increasing their security presence in northern [MISC Sinai  ] and giving greater focus to preventing weapons from entering the [MISC Sinai  ] . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] officials claim to have identified and sealed over 100 tunnels since the beginning of the year , with new discoveries occurring daily . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] General [PER Intelligence Service  ] ( EGIS ) requested [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to purchase 16 X-ray screening systems to monitor vehicular traffic into the [MISC Sinai  ] for weapons and explosives , and we are currently exploring ways to provide the requested assistance . 
A recent decision by [PER Tantawi  ] to delay a [MISC FMF-funded  ] counter smuggling project , however , threatens progress . 
In February , [PER Tantawi  ] insisted that the [ORG Army Corps of Engineers  ] sever the satellite link necessary to calibrate seismic-acoustic sensors being installed along the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border to detect tunneling activity . 
He also insisted that the ACE disable GPS technology needed to accurately pinpoint tunneling activity . 
This decision will result in a four to five month delay to develop and implement a technical alternative . 
USG efforts to encourage [PER Tantawi  ] to reconsider , including from CENTCOM Commander General [PER Petraeus  ] , have been unsuccessful. --------------- Regional Issues --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] has shown increasing confidence that [LOC Iraq  ] has turned the corner , although concerns remain that the [MISC Shi’a-led  ] government is prone to [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] is concerned by rising [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region , has supported [ORG UN  ] sanctions , and is increasingly active on countering [LOC Iran  ] , e.g. in [LOC Gaza  ] and to some extent in [LOC Lebanon  ] , working with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and other [MISC Arab  ] states to support [MISC Lebanese  ] political and territorial sovereignty . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has deployed peacekeeping troops to the [ORG UN  ] Mission in [LOC Darfur  ] , just agreed to send troops to the [ORG UN  ] Mission in [LOC Congo  ] and is taking a greater role within the [ORG African Union  ] on regional security and political issues. ------------------------------- Internal Politics and Economics ------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We continue to promote democratic reform in [LOC Egypt  ] , including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism , and respect for human rights . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] democracy and human rights efforts , however , are being stymied , and the [MISC GoE  ] remains skeptical of our role in democracy promotion , complaining that any efforts to open up will result in empowering the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , which currently holds 86 seats in [ORG Egypt’s  ] 454-seat parliament . 
Economic reform is ongoing although [LOC Egypt  ] still suffers from widespread poverty affecting 35-40% of the population . 
[ORG Egyptian-U.S.  ] trade has more than doubled in the last four years , reaching almost $9 billion in 2008 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC Egypt  ] about twice as much as it imports . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] banks operate very conservatively and have been spared involvement in risky financial products , but the effects of the global economic crisis on [LOC Egypt  ] are beginning to be felt . 
As the global credit crunch worsens , [LOC Egypt  ] remains vulnerable as exports , [LOC Suez Canal  ] revenues , tourism , and remittances -- its largest sources of revenue -- are all down and likely to continue to fall .
