End Summary . 
[PER HAMDANI  ] ACUITTED OF IMMIGRATION CHARGES 2 . 
( C ) [ORG Swiss Charge  ] [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] confirmed press reports that [MISC Swiss  ] businessman [PER Rachid Hamdani  ] had been cleared of all immigration-related charges , and his 16-month prison sentence had been overturned in a January 31 ruling by the appeals court . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] said that [PER Hamdani  ] had attended the appeals hearing at the immigration court on January 24 , accompanied by [PER Lazarotto  ] , the [MISC German  ] Ambassador , a [LOC UK  ] diplomat , and a [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] representative . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] said that [PER Hamdani  ] had been allowed to represent his case and was able to return to the Embassy after the trial . 
He credited the positive verdict in part to [PER Hamdani  ] 's participation in the hearing . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] believed that with the verdict , the [MISC Swiss  ] were " 20% there and had 80% of the way to go " toward resolving the issue . 
ONE MORE APPEAL AND TWO TAX VERDICTS TO GO 3 . 
( C ) [PER Lazarotto  ] noted that the second [MISC Swiss  ] businessman , [PER Max Goeldi  ] , had attended his appeals trial at the immigration court on January 28 and expected to hear a verdict in that case on February 4 . 
[PER Goeldi  ] was accompanied to his trial by the [MISC Swiss  ] Charge , [MISC German  ] Ambassador , diplomats from the [MISC Austrian  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] , and [MISC Danish  ] embassies , and a [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] representative . 
The trial lasted about 40 minutes , the court provided interpretation , and [PER Goeldi  ] 's lawyer was able to present oral and written arguments in his client 's defense . 
Like [PER Hamdani  ] , [PER Goeldi  ] was allowed to return to the [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy after the hearing . 
Although [PER Lazarotto  ] hoped for another positive outcome , he noted that the [MISC Swiss  ] were still waiting on two verdicts from the tax court . 
The hearings for [PER Goeldi  ] and [PER Hamdani  ] on tax-related charges took place on January 30 and 31 , respectively , which both men attended . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] related that they expect to receive verdicts before February 7 , at which point " the picture will be much clearer . 
" FORWARD MOVEMENT ON POLITICAL TRACK 4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Resolution of the legal aspects of the [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] contretemps , according to [PER Lazarotto  ] , will facilitate progress toward piecing back together the bilateral political relationship . 
He said the latest development was " confidence building " and bolstered the [MISC Swiss  ] Government 's continued cautious optimism . 
The [MISC Germans  ] have mediated two rounds of political talks to amend the situation , and [PER Lazarotto  ] expects a third round to be conducted in the near future . 
Separately , the [MISC German  ] Ambassador also expressed increased optimism that the situation was nearly resolved . 
He told the Ambassador on January 26 that the [MISC German  ] mediator , Ambassador [PER Born  ] , who has been designated by the [MISC Swiss  ] as the negotiator with the [MISC Libyans  ] , indicated that during his last visit here , [PER Born  ] was empowered to lift the visa freeze immediately if the [MISC Libyans  ] would hand over the two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen and permit them to leave . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] for " technical " reasons were not prepared to do that , but [PER Born  ] has been charged with returning to [LOC Libya  ] with the same proposal . 
That trade would then set off a set of agreements leading to a return to normalization . 
The [MISC German  ] Ambassador was not sure whether this potential resolution had yet been properly blessed by the [MISC Qadhafi  ] family . 
5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [MISC German-sponsored  ] diplomatic initiative , coupled with [MISC Swiss  ] hardball tactics on [LOC Schengen  ] visas for [MISC Libyan  ] officials , appears to be paying dividends . 
If the legal rulings continue in a positive direction , they set the stage for an overall political solution to this 18-month drama . 
The recent legal rulings in favor of the two [MISC Swiss  ] citizens could indicate that the necessary approvals from the [MISC Qadhafi  ] family have been obtained . 
We will continue to monitor the situation .
