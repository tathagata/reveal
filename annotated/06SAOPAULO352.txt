Senator [PER Charles Grassley  ] ( [LOC IA  ] ) - Chairman of the [ORG Senate Finance Committee  ] - and his delegation visited [LOC Maringa  ] , [LOC Parana  ] state and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , March 22-23 . 
Other members of the delegation included [PER Senators Crapo  ] ( [LOC ID  ] ) and [ORG Allard  ] ( [LOC CO  ] ) ; [PER Representatives Peterson  ] ( [LOC MN  ] ) , [MISC English  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) , King ( [LOC IA  ] ) , [PER Issa  ] ( [LOC CA  ] ) , and [MISC Carnahan  ] ( [LOC MO  ] ) ; and Assistant [LOC U.S. Trade Representative  ] for the [ORG Americas Everett Eissenstat  ] . 
In [LOC Maringa  ] the delegation toured a sugar mill and ethanol plant . 
In [LOC Sao Paulo  ] they met with the leadership of the [ORG Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo State  ] ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) and the [MISC American  ] Chamber of [LOC Commerce  ] ( [ORG AMCHAM  ] ) , and visited a [ORG General Motors  ] facility where they learned about the manufacture and operation of [MISC FlexFuel-engine  ] automobiles . 
This cable addresses the delegation 's visit to the sugar mill , ethanol plant and the automobile factory , and discussions concerning ethanol and [MISC FlexFuel-engine  ] automobiles . 
The trade aspects of the visit , and [PER Rep. Issa  ] 's separate meeting with the [MISC Brazilian-Lebanese  ] community , will be reported septels . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------- VISIT TO A SUGAR MILL AND ETHANOL PLANT --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
On March 22 , [PER CODEL Grassley  ] traveled to [LOC Maringa  ] , [LOC Parana  ] state to visit the [ORG Vale  ] do [ORG Ivai  ] sugar mill and ethanol plant . 
The group learned about the mill 's operations as well as its business activities , including partnerships in port facilities and a trading company focused on ethanol and sugar exports . 
[PER Mark Lyons  ] , managing director of [ORG Vale  ] do [ORG Ivai  ] 's [MISC American  ] joint venture partner [ORG Alltech  ] , described [ORG Alltech  ] 's activities in [ORG Sao Pedro  ] do [ORG Ivai  ] . 
3 . 
The [PER CODEL  ] took a walking tour of the crushing facilities , distilleries and [ORG Alltech  ] 's new yeast fermentation facility . 
Delegation members asked a broad range of questions on such topics as production costs and productivity for sugar and ethanol , use of ethanol in the [MISC Brazilian  ] fuels matrix , agricultural production techniques in southern [LOC Brazil  ] , and environmental controls in plant operations . 
After the tour , the delegation , along with the Mayor of [ORG Sao Pedro  ] do [ORG Ivai  ] , the President and Superintendent of the [ORG Parana Sugar and Alcohol Producers' Association  ] , and the Director of Cocamar , a major agricultural cooperative in the region , attended a lunch hosted by the mill. --------------------------------------------- --- CONVERSATIONS ON ETHANOL AT THE [ORG AMCHAM  ] BREAKFAST --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
During a discussion of trade issues ( septel ) at the delegation 's breakfast meeting at [LOC AMCHA  ] , Board Member [PER Joseph Tutundjian  ] suggested that ongress consider forming a [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] Ethanol Cucus as a symbolic gesture with the possibility of aking substantive progress on an issue importantto both sides . 
This suggestion led to a broaderdiscussion of ethanol . 
One immediate problem isthat demand is rapidly outstripping supply , drivin prices up . 
Both countries need to prioritize exanding their production facilities to satisfy grwing demand . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] 's case , according to theAMCHAM members , there is a shortage of the invesment capital needed to expand the capacity of refieries . 
Impediments to investment cited by [ORG AMCHAM  ] embers include the high cost of capital in [LOC Brazi  ] , caused in part by an extremely high tax burden particularly on industrial production ; the burden placed on [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000352 002 OF 004 [MISC American  ] companies investing and operating in [LOC Brazil  ] by the [ORG Sarbanes-Oxley Act  ] ; and inefficient infrastructure , especially the high cost of transportation and inefficient port facilities. --------------------------------------------- [ORG GENERAL MOTORS  ] - FOCUSING ON EMERGING MARKETS --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[PER CODEL Grassley  ] next visited [ORG General Motors  ] do Brasil ( [ORG GMB  ] ) in [LOC Sao Caetano  ] do Sul ( greater [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ) . 
[ORG GMB  ] President [PER Ray G. Young  ] greeted the delegation and gave an overview of the company 's history , followed by a presentation on [ORG GMB  ] 's experience with [MISC FlexFuel  ] ( engine systems that run on gasoline , ethanol , or any mix of the two fuels ) . 
[PER Young  ] pointed to [ORG GMB  ] 's extensive experience in the [MISC Brazilian  ] market - the company has been operating in [LOC Brazil  ] since 1925 . 
Currently , 90 percent of [ORG GMB  ] 's product is produced locally because [LOC Brazil  ] 's high tariffs on automobiles ( 35 percent ) discourage imports . 
GM believes in the [ORG BRIC  ] moniker ( identifying the key emerging markets as [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC China  ] ) and is currently focused on operations in these key markets . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has been a particularly successful market for [ORG GMB  ] , precisely because it is so closed to imports . 
Accordingly , [ORG GMB  ] engineers its cars specifically for the [MISC Brazilian  ] market , and several of the models produced here are exclusive to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Because [LOC Brazil  ] is still a relatively low-income economy , the key consumer factors in [MISC Brazilian  ] auto sales are low price and high resale value - two factors that would later come into play with [MISC FlexFuel  ] popularity. ---------------------------- THE RISE AND FALL OF ETHANOL ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[ORG GMB  ] has over thirty years of experience with ethanol as an automobile fuel . 
During the 1970s oil crisis , the [ORG GoB  ] began to regulate gasoline usage . 
In 1976 , the [ORG GoB  ] banned the use of gasoline in auto races . 
Race-car engine manufacturers switched to ethanol to use in [LOC Brazil  ] 's popular [ORG Formula  ] 1 races . 
The racetrack proved a useful testing ground for the technology , and in 1978 when the [ORG GoB  ] mandated that all government fleets be run on alternative fuels , [ORG GMB  ] stepped in with its ethanol engine technology . 
Mass ethanol engine production began in earnest in 1979 , the year that the [ORG GoB  ] began to offer attractive tax incentives for purchasers of alternative fuel cars . 
Throughout the early 1980s , ethanol technology flourished and consumer demand rose dramatically . 
By 1986 , ethanol-burning cars accounted for 90 percent of [MISC Brazilian  ] automobile production . 
The ethanol heyday was short-lived , however . 
In 1988-89 , sugar prices rose sharply . 
From one day to the next , ethanol was no longer a cost-competitive fuel . 
As a result , thousands of [MISC Brazilian  ] consumers who had purchased ethanol cars lost their investments and [MISC Brazilians  ] generally lost confidence in alternative fuel technologies. ------------------------- THE EMERGENCE OF [MISC FLEXFUEL  ] ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
It wasn't until 1992 that [ORG GMB  ] began to run its first [MISC FlexFuel  ] studies . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] consumers felt burned by their experience with ethanol engines in the 1980s . 
[ORG GMB  ] , however , still believed in ethanol technology and sought to develop an engine that could serve as a hedge against fuel price fluctuations . 
[MISC FlexFuel  ] engines were developed with this goal in mind , with flexible fuel usage , meaning that the engines can run on gasoline , ethanol , or any combination of the two fuels . 
The [MISC FlexFuel  ] engine system has a fuel sensor that continually monitors the mix of ethanol and gasoline in the tank and instructs the engine to alter performance based on the fuel mix . 
[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000352 003 OF 004 When burning ethanol , for example , pistons need a higher compression ratio , and the fuel sensor instructs the engine to adjust accordingly . 
The first [MISC FlexFuel  ] concept car was built in 1995 , and mass production for the consumer market began in 1999. -------------- [MISC FLEXFUEL  ] MANIA -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
In 2004 , demand for cars with [MISC FlexFuel  ] engines began to soar . 
Because of widespread ethanol use in the 1980s , [MISC Brazilian  ] gas stations were still ethanol-capable . 
Moreover , ethanol distribution networks were still in place . 
In 2004-05 , with ethanol prices half those of gasoline , owners found that their cars were not only cheaper to operate , but that their resale value was at an all-time high . 
These two factors drove [MISC FlexFuel  ] production to higher-than-anticipated levels . 
Industry estimates in 2003 placed [MISC FlexFuel  ] market saturation at 80 percent by 2008 . 
[MISC FlexFuel  ] 's popularity , however , shattered these estimates , and by 2005 [MISC FlexFuel  ] cars accounted for 90 percent of [MISC Brazilian  ] new car production . 
In 2005 , [ORG GMB  ] 's flagship [LOC Sao Caetano  ] do Sul plant was 100 percent [MISC FlexFuel  ] production , and overall [ORG GMB  ] production was 98 percent [MISC FlexFuel  ] . 
All major automotive companies operating in [LOC Brazil  ] - [ORG Ford  ] , [ORG Fiat  ] , [ORG Renault  ] , Volkwagen - were producing cars with [MISC FlexFuel  ] engines . 
By all measures , [MISC FlexFuel  ] was a hit . 
[LOC Brazil  ] began to draw international attention and kudos for its widespread use of alternative fuel technology. ------------------- [ORG FLEXFUEL CHALLENGES  ] ------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
FUEL QUALITY - Despite [MISC FlexFuel  ] 's success , the technology is not without its challenges . 
One concern is low fuel quality . 
[ORG GMB  ] reports that [MISC Brazilian  ] gas stations frequently dilute their fuel ( gasoline and ethanol ) with water . 
This can confuse the internal sensor mechanism in the [MISC FlexFuel  ] engine and compromise fuel efficiency . 
Currently , [ORG GMB  ] is campaigning against this practice at the fuel distributor level and working to re-engineer the sensor system to detect water in the fuel mix. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
RISING ETHANOL PRICES - Another concern is the recent increase in the price of ethanol over the first few months of 2006 . 
The popularity of [MISC FlexFuel  ] cars and the increasing price of sugar on the international market have constricted ethanol supply in [LOC Brazil  ] 's internal market and have consequently driven up ethanol prices . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is at the tail end of the 2005 sugar harvest season and is just beginning to process last year 's sugar yield . 
Thus , domestic ethanol supply may pick back up in a few months . 
In addition to ethanol 's higher price , the fuel is also less efficient than gasoline . 
Although it increases an engine 's horsepower by 2 to 5 horses , ethanol offers fewer miles per gallon than gasoline. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
ETHANOL'S BREAK-EVEN POINT - The break-even point for choosing ethanol over gasoline is 70 percent . 
This means that as long as the price of ethanol is 70 percent of the price of gasoline at the pump or less , it is more economical for consumers to fill-up with ethanol . 
If the price of ethanol exceeds 70 percent of that of gasoline , then gasoline is the better choice . 
Ethanol 's 70 percent benchmark represents a trade-off between price and efficiency . 
In [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , the biggest [MISC FlexFuel  ] and ethanol market , the price of ethanol is currently 71 percent of that of gasoline , so right now it s more cost-effective for [MISC FlexFuel  ] car owners to buy gasoline . 
If the price of ethanol remains over 70 percent for a long period of time , this may suppress demand for [MISC FlexFuel  ] cars . 
[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000352 004 OF 004 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
A SILVER LINING - Overall , [ORG GMB  ] believes that the spike in ethanol prices can be positive , because it shows the consumer the flexibility of [MISC FlexFuel  ] technology . 
There is no loss to consumers if the price of ethanol spikes - they can simply switch to gasoline . 
[ORG GMB  ] hopes this will go a long way towards restoring consumer confidence in alternative fuels , a confidence that has been lagging since the ethanol spike of the late 1980s. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's successful ethanol fuel model has generated great interest in the [LOC United States  ] and throughout the world . 
[ORG FlexFuel  ] technology appears to have solved the problem of gasoline price fluctuations . 
The main constraints to even greater internal use and exports are problems in expanding the supply of ethanol quickly enough .
