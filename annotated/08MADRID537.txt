MADRID 00000537 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: [ORG CDA Hugo Llorens for Reasons  ] 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Two months after suffering a second straight defeat at the hands of President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] , opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] finds himself in the midst of a crisis that threatens the future of his party leadership . 
In the days following the March 9 general election , [PER Rajoy  ] announced that he would remain the [ORG PP  ] leader--reminding [MISC Spanish  ] citizens that [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] lost two elections to [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] before finally winning in 1996--and received the public support of nearly every senior party official . 
[PER Rajoy  ] then took steps to soften the party 's tone and remake it in his own image , in an attempt to dilute the influence of [PER Aznar  ] . 
To that end , he eased out [ORG Congressional  ] spokesman [PER Eduardo Zaplana  ] and Secretary General [PER Angel Acebes  ] and announced he would be taking the party in a new direction. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The cracks in [ORG PP  ] unity began to show on April 7 , when [LOC Madrid Regional  ] President ( [LOC U.S.  ] governor equivalent ) [PER Esperanza Aguirre  ] refused to rule out a challenge to [PER Rajoy  ] at the upcoming party conference in June . 
The potential for a challenge to [PER Rajoy  ] 's leadership was a major news story in [LOC Spain  ] for the next several days , with some in the [ORG PP  ] even discussing the feasibility of conducting a [MISC U.S.-style  ] primary system to choose the party 's next leader . 
[PER Rajoy  ] and his supporters tried to douse any speculation of a leadership change , but the crisis has not gone away . 
More wood was added to the fire on May 12 when the popular [ORG PP  ] leader in the [LOC Basque Country  ] , [PER Maria San Gil  ] , announced that she would not serve again on the committee drafting the party 's political program because she no longer had confidence in [PER Rajoy  ] or his team . 
Immediately after this announcement , senior party officials including [PER Aguirre  ] , [PER Acebes  ] , [LOC Madrid Councilwoman  ] ( and wife of President [PER Aznar  ] ) [PER Ana Botella  ] , and former [PER Aznar  ] Interior Minister [PER Jaime Mayor Oreja  ] , expressed their support for [LOC San Gil  ] 's decision and called on [PER Rajoy  ] to reflect on the current turmoil within his party . 
For the first time since the March 9 elections , we are now hearing serious speculation that [PER Rajoy  ] may not be able to hold on to power. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During the week of May 5 ( in the middle of the controversy over the future of [PER Rajoy  ] 's leadership but before the uproar caused by the [LOC San Gil  ] announcement ) , the Charge d'Affaires held separate meetings with [PER Gustavo de Aristegui  ] , [ORG PP Congressional  ] Spokesman for Foreign Affairs , and [PER Jorge Moragas  ] , [ORG PP  ] Director of International Relations and a key [PER Rajoy  ] advisor . 
[PER Aristegui  ] was very critical of [PER Rajoy  ] 's actions in the wake of the electoral loss , saying that he seemed to be blaming everyone but himself for the results . 
He said [PER Rajoy  ] 's actions to force out [PER Zaplana  ] and [PER Acebes  ] and bring in a new team were akin to the captain of a ship , not only abandoning ship , but leaving his crew in the sinking vessel . 
[PER Aristegui  ] said that [PER Rajoy  ] 's lack of loyalty to those who had been with him all along was not sitting well with other [ORG PP  ] leaders . 
He opined that [PER Rajoy  ] needed to open up the June party conference and allow all interested officials to present their candidacy for [ORG PP  ] leadership . 
He said that if [PER Rajoy  ] was able to defeat challengers in a fair and open process , his leadership would no longer be questioned . 
[PER Aristegui  ] said that [PER Rajoy  ] may be able to maintain control beyond the June convention , but opposition to his leadership would grow if the [ORG PP  ] does poorly in the next rounds of [MISC Spanish  ] regional elections in the [LOC Basque Country  ] ( currently scheduled for April 2009 ) and [PER Galicia  ] ( June 2009 ) . 
It should be noted that [PER Aristegui  ] perhaps feels personally betrayed since [PER Rajoy  ] has clearly demoted him in the party 's foreign policy circles. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As expected , [PER Moragas  ] was more upbeat in his comments to the Charge and , while acknowledging that there were currently concerns about [PER Rajoy  ] 's leadership , predicted that the party would eventually fall back in line . 
He said that in the coming weeks [PER Rajoy  ] would attempt to remain above the fray and look towards the next four years in opposition by issuing position papers on topics such as the economy , security , and regional issues . 
He said that President [PER Zapatero  ] and his Socialist government were in for a very rocky way ahead with the economy continuing to tank and key issues in [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [LOC Basque Country  ] coming to a head . 
He said it is more vital than ever for the party to remain united and seize the moment when [PER Zapatero  ] stumbles . 
[PER Moragas  ] said that he and [PER Rajoy  ] developed a close working relationship during the campaign and that he is now one of [PER Rajoy  ] 's closest advisors . 
He added however that he was not a " [PER Rajoy  ] guy , " but rather a loyal party member who responded when asked to serve. //COMMENT// MADRID 00000537 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Rajoy  ] does not posses great charisma , and many were surprised when former President [PER Aznar  ] hand-picked him as his successor in 2003 . 
Many more were surprised when [PER Rajoy  ] did not bow out five years later after a second straight electoral loss . 
We believe [PER Rajoy  ] owes his longevity as much as anything to the lack of a credible successor within his own party . 
Would-be challengers such as [PER Esperanza Aguirre  ] , Madrid Mayor [PER Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon  ] , or [LOC Valencia Regional President  ] [PER Francisco Camps  ] all have their own drawbacks , and none enjoys the national stature of [PER Rajoy  ] ( and both [PER Ruiz-Gallardon  ] and [PER Camps  ] appear to still be backing [PER Rajoy  ] ) . 
However , a groundswell of opposition may be building . 
[PER Maria San Gil  ] 's public criticism of [PER Rajoy  ] 's leadership was certainly noteworthy , but maybe more so is the number of senior [ORG PP  ] leaders coming out of the woodwork to express solidarity with her , and to call on [PER Rajoy  ] to seriously respond to the current unease among the party faithful . 
[PER Rajoy  ] may hold onto power for the time being due to the lack of a viable alternative , but we agree that further losses in [LOC Spain  ] 's regional elections over the next two years will make it difficult for him to remain the [ORG PP  ] 's national candidate in <a id='par2012' href='#par2012'>¶</a>2012 . 
[ORG PP  ] leaders have traditionally been members of [ORG Congress  ] due to the visibility afforded and the need for the opposition leader to be able to confront the sitting president directly in weekly debates , but some credible voices are mentioning the name of former [ORG IMF  ] director and past [MISC Spanish  ] Vice President [PER Rodrigo Rato  ] ( now in the private sector ) as a possible candidate to lead the party into the future .
