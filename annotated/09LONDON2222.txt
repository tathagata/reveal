( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Prime Minister Brown’s September 23 announcement at the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] ( [ORG UNGA  ] ) that the [LOC UK  ] is prepared to consider reducing from four to three the number of its nuclear submarines caught many in [ORG HMG  ] by surprise . 
That said , there has been increased discussion in recent months within [ORG HMG  ] and [ORG Conservative Party  ] circles about the most effective way to cut defense costs , in the face of a surging budget deficit , and maintain an effective defense , even if [ORG HMG  ] sources downplay the fiscal basis for a possible fleet reduction . 
[ORG HMG  ] sources stress that the [LOC UK  ] remains committed to maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent -- as did [PER Brown  ] himself during his [ORG UNGA  ] speech . 
[ORG HMG  ] sources also note that reducing the number of submarines from four to three would not necessarily reduce the total number of missiles or operational nuclear warheads in the [MISC British  ] arsenal . 
They strongly emphasize that any reduction must be consistent with maintaining a “continuous at sea deterrent.” [PER Julian Miller  ] , the Deputy Head of the Foreign and [ORG Defence Policy Secretariat  ] at the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] , assured the Political Minister Counselor September 24 that [ORG HMG  ] would consult with the [LOC U.S.  ] regarding future developments concerning the [MISC Trident  ] deterrent to assure there would be “no daylight” between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU/NF ) [ORG Cabinet Office  ] and [ORG Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) officials confirmed to Poloff September 23 Prime Minister Brown’s plans to announce at [ORG UNGA  ] that [LOC Great Britain  ] would be prepared to reduce from four to three the number of nuclear submarines that carry nuclear weapons . 
Foreign Minister [PER Miliband  ] publicly explained the decision by observing that “President [PER Obama  ] has injected new drive into the effort to meet the goals of the ( Nuclear ) [ORG Nonproliferation Treaty  ] , which is a world free of nuclear weapons , and our Prime Minister , [PER Gordon Brown  ] , is determined that [LOC Britain  ] plays its full part in those discussions.” ( [MISC Note:  ] The [LOC UK  ] [MISC Trident  ] system consists of 160 operational nuclear warheads carried by [ORG Trident II  ] ( D5 ) ballistic missiles aboard four [MISC Vanguard-class  ] nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines . 
The warheads and submarines are [MISC British  ] built , but with substantial [MISC American  ] design assistance .

( SBU ) According to the transcript of PM Brown’s wide-ranging September 23 speech to [ORG UNGA  ] ( a transcript is available at www.number10.gov.uk ) , [PER Brown  ] stated that “all nuclear weapons states must play their part in reducing nuclear weapons as part of an agreement by non nuclear states to renounce them...In line with maintaining our nuclear deterrent , I have asked our national security committee to report to me on the potential future reduction of our nuclear weapons submarines from four to three.” He described his overall proposal regarding nuclear weapons reduction as a “grand global bargain between nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapons states.” [ORG HMG  ] officials confirmed to [PER Poloff  ] that [PER Brown  ] would elaborate on his proposal at the September 24 UNSC Heads of State meeting . 
Timing is Everything -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The announcement of a proposed fleet reduction caught many in the [ORG MOD  ] , [ORG FCO  ] and [ORG Cabinet Office  ] by surprise . 
Dr. [PER Richard Freer  ] ( strictly protect ) Head of [ORG Defence and Security Policy  ] in the [ORG Cabinet Office’s Foreign and Defence Policy Secretariat  ] , told [PER Poloff  ] September 23 that “in an ideal world , we’d have done a bit more pre-vetting.” One of [ORG Freer’s Cabinet Office  ] deputies was blunter , separately telling [MISC Poloff  ] that the announcement was “unexpected” by [ORG Cabinet Office  ] staff . 
[ORG MOD  ] officials separately told [MISC DAO Embassy London  ] that the announcement was unexpected. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Both [PER Freer  ] and [PER Judith Gough  ] ( strictly protect ) , Deputy Head of the [ORG Security Policy Group  ] at the [ORG Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] , stressed to [ORG Poloff  ] that [ORG HMG  ] has not formally decided to scale back the deterrent but would only do so if a government defense review determines , in [MISC Freer’s  ] words , that it would be “technically feasible” to maintain “continuous deterrence patrols” with three submarines instead of four . 
All sources stressed that [ORG HMG  ] remains committed to an independent nuclear deterrent . 
The [ORG PM’s  ] spokesman publicly affirmed that [ORG HMG  ] is committed to maintaining “an [LOC LONDON  ] 00002222 002 OF 003 effective nuclear deterrent.” [PER Freer  ] criticized media for exaggerating the significance of Brown’s announcement , opining that it was “not really a major disarmament announcement , ” but rather a reaffirmation of HMG’s commitment to nuclear disarmament , albeit not unilaterally . 
[ORG P5 Reassurances  ] --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Mariot [PER Leslie  ] , the Director General for [ORG Defence and Intelligence  ] at the [ORG Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) , told representatives of [ORG P5  ] embassies at a September 23 briefing that [ORG HMG  ] remains committed to a nuclear deterrent “at a minimum level consistent with ( the [MISC UK’s  ] ) deterrence doctrine.” She underscored that [ORG HMG  ] had not made a commitment to reduce its fleet from four to three submarines , but would only do so if three submarines could maintain “continuous at sea deterrence.” She stated that HMG’s eventual decision would not depend upon the actions of other nuclear weapons states , but would be based entirely on [MISC Britain’s  ] defense needs . 
She referenced the [MISC UK’s  ] 2006 [ORG White Paper  ] , that mentioned the possibility of reducing the submarine fleet from four to three vessels , if consistent with defense requirements . 
She also noted that the review of the number of submarines was unrelated to the issue of how many missiles and warheads the [LOC UK  ] would retain , a point that other [ORG HMG  ] officials also made to [ORG Poloff.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) . 
[PER Leslie  ] explained to the [ORG P5  ] embassy representatives that she had requested a meeting with them in order to respond to “speculation” in the [MISC British  ] press about what PM [PER Brown  ] would announce at the [ORG UN  ] . 
She underscored the importance of close coordination among the [ORG P5  ] , especially in the lead up next year’s Nuclear [ORG Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) [ORG Review Conference  ] ( [ORG RevCon  ] ) , and she urged [ORG P5  ] delegations “to keep in touch in New York.” She stressed HMG’s commitment to a successful [ORG RevCon  ] , and underscored that [ORG P5  ] cooperation was essential for a successful outcome. “No Daylight” ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Julian Miller  ] , the Deputy Head of the Foreign and [ORG Defence Policy Secretariat  ] at the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] , assured the Political Minister Counselor September 24 that [ORG HMG  ] would consult with the [LOC U.S.  ] regarding future developments concerning the [MISC Trident  ] deterrent to assure there would be “no daylight” between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] . 
He noted that it is “still an open question” as to whether three new submarines would be able to provide continuous deterrence . 
Like [PER Leslie  ] , [PER Miller  ] referenced the 2006 [ORG White Paper  ] , stressing that a possible reduction from four to three submarines was not a “fundamentally new position.” [PER Money Matters  ] ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) In recent months there has been increased discussion within [ORG HMG  ] and [ORG Conservative Party  ] circles and among defense analysts about the most effective way to cut costs while getting value for money , in the face of a surging budget deficit . 
Many estimates indicate that it would cost 20 billion pounds , spread over two decades , to replace all four of the aging [ORG Vanguard  ] fleet . 
It is debatable how much cost savings would be generated by cutting the replacement program by one quarter ; one estimate places total savings as low as three billion pounds . 
[ORG Defence  ] Secretary [PER Bob Ainsworth  ] declared in a September 15 speech that operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] illustrate that the world has rapidly and significantly changed in the decade since [LOC Britain  ] last conducted a [ORG Strategic Defense Review  ] ( [ORG SDR  ] ) . 
He noted that “some assumptions of the [ORG SDR  ] have now been overtaken by events.” [PER Ainsworth  ] stressed that “there will be tough choices ahead” and that “major shifts” in defense spending could not be ruled out . 
He outlined the process for an updated [ORG SDR  ] , starting with a [ORG Defence Green Paper  ] to be published in early 2010 . 
In an interview following the speech , [PER Ainsworth  ] indicated , in regard to the [MISC UK’s  ] independent [MISC Trident  ] nuclear deterrent , that “if we can provide that at-sea deterrent with three submarines and not four submarines we will look at that.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Conservative Party  ] defense sources have privately affirmed to [MISC Embassy  ] officers their commitment to the [MISC Trident  ] deterrent . 
They have also acknowledged that reducing to three submarines would be one effective cost-saving measure to consider as part of a [ORG Strategic Defense Review  ] , which the [LOC LONDON  ] 00002222 003 OF 003 Conservatives have promised to undertake if they win next year’s general election . 
Shadow [ORG Conservative Defense Secretary  ] [PER Liam Fox  ] told the [ORG BBC  ] following [ORG Brown’s  ] speech that the [ORG PM’s  ] proposal seemed “reasonable and sensible , ” so long as the [LOC UK  ] could maintain a continuous at-sea deterrent . 
Liberal [MISC Democrat  ] leader [PER Nick Clegg  ] welcomed [ORG Brown’s  ] announcement to consider scaling back [MISC Trident  ] , stating that it is “unrealistic” to believe the [LOC UK  ] could foot the bill for renewing [ORG Trident.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] publicly rejected on September 22 assertions that scaling back [MISC Trident  ] would be a cost-cutting measure . 
[PER Julian Miller  ] also downplayed the potential fiscal impact of a reduction , telling the Political Minister Counselor that it is still unclear whether a reduction to three submarines would create significant savings . 
[PER Miller  ] stressed that a reduction in the number of submarines was one way to “show commitment to the disarmament agenda.” [MISC Comment: A Popular Decision  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Brown’s  ] readiness to cut the size of [MISC Britain’s Trident  ] fleet will please a large segment of the [MISC British  ] public -- both fiscal hawks and disarmament doves , although some in the latter camp would just as soon see the [LOC UK  ] scrap its deterrent entirely . 
Indeed , July polling indicates that 54 percent of [MISC British  ] voters would “prefer to abandon nuclear weapons rather than put money into a new generation of [MISC Trident  ] warheads.” ( Ref B ) [ORG HMG  ] sources stress that both [PER Brown  ] and [PER Miliband  ] are personally committed to nuclear disarmament , albeit not unilaterally . 
[PER Miliband  ] most recently signaled his commitment to disarmament in an op-ed in the September 20 “Guardian” newspaper , reminding readers that the [LOC UK  ] has reduced its nuclear arsenal 75 percent since the end of the [MISC Cold War  ] . 
( Ref D ) Toward the end of the op-ed , he hinted at PM [ORG Brown’s  ] readiness to scale back [MISC Trident:  ] “As soon as it becomes useful for the [LOC UK  ] arsenal to be included in a broader negotiation , we stand ready to participate and act.” Visit London’s Classified Website: http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Unit ed_Kingdom SUSMAN</pre></code>
