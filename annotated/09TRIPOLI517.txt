( C ) Summary: [ORG Verenex  ] , a [MISC Canadian  ] oil firm , continues to experience delays from the [ORG Libyan National Oil Company  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) on approving the proposed sale of [ORG Verenex  ] to [ORG China National Petroleum Company International Ltd  ] ( [ORG CNPCI  ] ) in a deal estimated at 400 million [LOC U.S.  ] dollars . 
In the latest round of stalling , the [ORG NOC  ] introduced allegations of misconduct during [ORG Verenex  ] 's initial bid . 
The head of [ORG Verenex  ] believes the [MISC Libyan  ] authorities are trying to force down the proposed share price ( 10 [MISC Canadian  ] dollars ) in order to buy the company itself . 
The reasoning behind the [ORG NOC  ] 's stone-walling remains elusive , but may be related to a number of issues , including: [MISC Libyan  ] concerns about the [MISC Chinese  ] offer , [ORG NOC  ] 's interest in accumulating funds for the [ORG Compensation Fund  ] agreed to with the [LOC U.S.  ] , or bureaucratic incompetence . 
Regardless of the [ORG NOC  ] 's reasoning ( or lack thereof ) , [ORG Verenex  ] 's troubles may have broad implications for other foreign firms doing business here , as [ORG GOL  ] 's actions to stall the sale appear to violate the sanctity of its contract with [ORG Verenex  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On April 23 , [PER Jim McFarland  ] ( strictly protect ) , President of [ORG Verenex  ] , a relatively small [MISC Canadian  ] oil firm with exploration activities in [LOC Libya  ] , provided an update on the proposed sale of [ORG Verenex  ] to [ORG CNPCI  ] . 
As reported in [MISC Refs A  ] and B , the proposed sale requires the approval of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG NOC  ] under the terms of [ORG Verenex  ] 's Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) with the [ORG NOC  ] and contains a clause allowing the [ORG NOC  ] to pre-empt any bid that has been offered . 
[PER McFarland  ] believes that the [MISC Libyans  ] are dragging out the approval process in an attempt to drive down [ORG Verenex  ] 's share-price and pre-empt the [ORG CNPCI  ] offer of 10 [MISC Canadian  ] dollars per share ( a deal that would amount to roughly $400 million USD ) . 
He also stated that while the [MISC Libyans  ] have political concerns about the [MISC Chinese  ] offer , they want to avoid offending the [MISC Chinese  ] government. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The sizable profit that [ORG NOC  ] stands to gain in acquiring [ORG Verenex  ] could be intended to repay the [ORG GOL  ] entity ( reportedly [ORG NOC  ] ) for its contributions to the [MISC Libyan  ] terrorism compensation fund agreed to by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] and completed on October 31 , 2008 . 
[ORG NOC  ] [PER Ghanem  ] has reportedly been under intense pressure to make up for the [MISC Libyan  ] funding that resolved the issue. xxxxxxxxxxxx told Pol/Econ Chief on June 28 that [ORG NOC  ] is developing various creative ways to try to collect money from the IOCs for the fund . 
[ORG NOC  ] 's acquisition of [ORG Verenex  ] 's fields would be consistent with that goal . 
On April 23 , [PER McFarland  ] noted that an NOC-owned subsidiary , [ORG African Gulf Oil Co  ] . 
( [ORG AGOCO  ] ) , which previously operated in [ORG Verenex  ] 's block , may be trying to re-acquire the area. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER McFarland  ] said the consideration of the proposed sale of [ORG Verenex  ] has shifted from the [ORG NOC  ] to the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] ) , which is led by the Secretary of the [ORG GPC  ] ( prime minister-equivalent ) al-Baghdadi [PER Ali al-Mahmoudi  ] . 
[PER McFarland  ] commented that the chair of the [ORG NOC  ] [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] , had been straightforward with him regarding the deal and wanted to avoid tarnishing the [ORG NOC  ] 's reputation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to regular meetings with al-Baghdadi , [ORG Verenex  ] is now meeting with the [ORG GPC  ] 's legal counsel . 
The lead attorney is [PER Ahmed Messalati  ] . 
[ORG Verenex  ] 's lawyers " did some checking " on [PER Messalati  ] , including asking the [ORG State Department  ] about him . 
It appears he was one of the main negotiators on the 2008 claims compensation agreement between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER McFarland  ] said the reports he received about [PER Messalati  ] were positive and that [ORG Verenex  ] appreciated knowing that a serious interlocutor would be working on the case . 
[ORG Verenex  ] also expects [PER Messalati  ] to be a shrewd negotiator , who will try to win the best deal for the Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER McFarland  ] said [ORG Verenex  ] had recently received letters from the [ORG NOC  ] saying the legal authorities in [LOC Libya  ] were investigating allegations that [ORG Verenex  ] was improperly pre-qualified to bid in the [ORG EPSA  ] IV first bid round in January 2005 , under which [ORG Verenex  ] acquired its rights to its exploration zones ( [PER Area  ] 47 ) in [LOC Libya  ] ( see [MISC Ref A  ] ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx He believes the investigation is being carried out by the auditors of the [ORG GPC  ] , as part of their review of the [ORG Verenex  ] " file . 
" He said they had had plenty of time to investigate the deal , including since last September when the process for selling [ORG Verenex  ] began . 
He noted the first [ORG EPSA  ] bidding round did not have clear criteria in the first place ; thus , [ORG GPC  ] allegations had no real basis . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000517 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG Verenex  ] is also keeping the [MISC Canadian  ] Embassy informed of the progress of their negotiations and the ongoing challenges . 
The [MISC Canadian  ] Ambassador told the Ambassador that he has raised the [ORG Verenex  ] issue with high-level officials in [LOC Tripoli  ] and has requested a meeting with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi to discuss [ORG Verenex  ] , among other issues . 
[ORG Verenex  ] has also kept the [LOC UK  ] Ambassador apprised of the latest developments , given the important role [MISC British  ] companies play in the oil and gas sector in [LOC Libya.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: A  ] number of reasons could be driving [ORG GOL  ] 's blocking of the [ORG Verenex  ] sale , including [MISC Libyan  ] concerns about the [MISC Chinese  ] offer , [ORG NOC  ] 's interest in accumulating funds for the compensation fund , revenge on the part of [MISC Libyan  ] stakeholders whose ox had been gorged by the initial permission for [ORG Verenex  ] to operate , or simple bureaucratic incompetence . 
While it would appear the [ORG Verenex  ] saga is not of direct concern to us ( although there are a considerable number of [MISC American  ] shareholders ) given its status as a small [MISC Canadian  ] company that perhaps entered the [MISC Libyan  ] market to make a quick profit and then exit , the case has broader implications for other foreign firms doing business here . 
[ORG GOL  ] 's stone-walling of [ORG Verenex  ] 's sale to the [MISC Chinese  ] , and the last-minute introduction of allegations of misconduct in initial bidding rounds , raise strong concerns about [LOC Libya  ] 's commitment to the sanctity of contract , a principle that is essential for companies operating in [LOC Libya  ] . 
We intend to raise this troubling aspect of the case in future discussions with [ORG GOL  ] officials . 
End comment .
