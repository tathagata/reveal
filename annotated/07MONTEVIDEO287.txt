04 STATE 135930 Classified By: Charge [PER D'Affaires James D. Nealon  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) This telegram contains an action request for the [ORG Department in paragraphs  ] 1 and 6. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: It has recently come to our attention that a promising counter-trade deal between the [ORG GOU  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] firm [ORG General Electric  ] ( [ORG GE  ] ) includes the key participation of a nefarious former [MISC Tupamaro  ] guerrilla named [PER Henry ENGLER Golovchenko  ] . 
[PER Engler  ] was credibly implicated in the 1970 murder in [LOC Uruguay  ] of [ORG then-USAID Security Advisor  ] Daniel [PER Anthony Mitrione  ] . 
As far as we can ascertain from old sensitive reporting , [PER Engler  ] was not a participant in the actual execution of [PER Mitrione  ] , but he is reported to have ordered the execution and provided the weapons used to kill him . 
The [MISC Embassy  ] had been helping to broker the triangular deal among [ORG GOU  ] ministries and the [LOC U.S.  ] company , but upon learning of [PER Engler  ] 's recent return to [LOC Uruguay  ] and his planned prominent role in the project , we see his presence as an outright show stopper . 
[MISC Embassy  ] seeks the [ORG Department 's  ] guidance on how best to proceed and whom to inform on this delicate matter . 
End Summary . 
Counter-trade Deal ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Over the past few months , the [MISC Embassy  ] has been helping to facilitate a creative deal worth $12 million between [ORG General Electric  ] and the [ORG GOU  ] 's ministries of Health , Energy and Agriculture . 
Under the terms of what amounts to a creative counter-trade agreement , [ORG GE  ] would provide some of its sophisticated medical equipment to a [MISC Uruguayan  ] cancer center in exchange for [MISC Uruguayan  ] commodities such as rice , cement and wood chips . 
[ORG GE  ] Trading would then sell the commodities on the world market . 
The deal would be a first for [ORG GE  ] in [LOC Latin America  ] and could pave the way for future even larger deals -- possibly including power generation plants . 
The project is well-advanced and was highlighted during the recent POTUS visit to [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
But the problem ( as we recently found out ) is that [PER Henry Engler  ] is now a contracted advisor for [ORG GE  ] who would play a prominent role in the medical portion of the project . 
Brief Background ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On July 31 , 1970 [PER Daniel Mitrione  ] , [ORG USAID Public Safety Advisor  ] , [ORG AmEmbassy Montevideo  ] , was driving from home to work when his vehicle was intercepted and hit by another vehicle . 
[PER Mitrione  ] 's police driver was disarmed . 
The kidnappers forced [PER Mitrione  ] out of his vehicle and a struggle ensued . 
[PER Mitrione  ] was shot in the thorax and kidnapped by [ORG Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional-Tupamaro  ] ( MLN-T ) terrorist . 
[PER Mitrione  ] was transported to a " People 's Jail " where his wound was treated by the kidnappers ( two of whom were medical students ) . 
The [ORG Tupamaros  ] demanded the release of 150 jailed comrades . 
The police engaged in a massive manhunt and arrested an additional 20 [MISC Tupamaro  ] suspects . 
Three other [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy officials were kidnapped in the same time frame ( [PER Rosenfeld  ] , [PER Jones  ] and Fly ) . 
At some point during his ordeal [PER Mitrione  ] was allegedly castrated by [PER Antonio Mas Mas  ] , a medical student who later disappeared and may have died . 
On August 10 , [PER Mitrione  ] was shot by [PER Mas  ] [PER Mas  ] and his body was left in a stolen car . 
[PER Henry ENGLER Golovchenko  ] ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Engler  ] was imprisoned during the [MISC Uruguayan  ] military dictatorship , spending some 13 years in captivity . 
According to police records , he was a member of the [ORG MLN Executive Committee  ] from 7 August 1970 until March 15 , 1972 . 
[PER Engler  ] was arrested on 17 August 1972 , and remained in captivity until he was amnestied by President [PER Sanguinetti  ] in 1985 . 
( Comment: We do not know if [PER Engler  ] was actually convicted of [PER Mitrione  ] 's murder . 
End Comment . 
) According to open sources , [PER Engler  ] was responsible for the military section of the 15th ( MLN-T ) column and helped plan the [PER Mitrione  ] kidnap and assassination . 
[PER Engler  ] was not involved in the assassination itself but provided some or all of the weapons to [PER Mas  ] [PER Mas  ] . 
After his 1985 release , [PER Engler  ] moved to [LOC Sweden  ] and completed medical school there. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Engler  ] is believed to be a [MISC Swedish  ] citizen . 
He is presently Medical Director of the [ORG PET Center  ] at the [ORG Uppsala University  ] in [LOC Sweden  ] . 
He travels widely in [LOC Europe  ] , and according to the [MISC Uruguayan  ] press , may be nominated for a [MISC Nobel  ] prize in medicine for his pioneering work in combating Alzheimer 's disease . 
He apparently now works with [ORG General Electric  ] and will manage a medical project at [LOC Hospital de Clinicas  ] in [LOC Montevideo  ] . 
In 2004 , Embassy [LOC Montevideo  ] attempted to reopen the investigation into [PER Mitrione  ] 's murder , but the request was denied ( reftels ) . 
Comment: -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We have been spreading the message that the [LOC U.S.  ] favors good relations with governments in the region that respect democracy , the rule of law and human rights , regardless of their political label . 
We also regularly interact with [ORG Tupamaros  ] who represent a significant portion of the [ORG Frente Amplio  ] government . 
However , we draw the line in dealing with individuals who were credibly involved in the kidnapping or murder of [MISC American  ] citizens such as [PER Dan Mitrione  ] . 
Despite the promising aspects of the [MISC GE/GOU  ] counter-trade deal , we think the [MISC Embassy  ] should distance itself from this project and discreetly inform the interested parties that the reason is the involvement of Dr. [PER Engler  ] , no matter how much he has tried to rehabilitate his image . 
Our other main concern is that we do not wish to reopen old wounds from the [MISC Cold War  ] any more than is necessary . 
This is because we have worked very hard to establish an excellent bilateral relationship with a pragmatic left-leaning government that for the most part eschews violence . 
Embassy requests the [ORG Department 's  ] guidance on how best to proceed and whom to inform in this delicate matter .
