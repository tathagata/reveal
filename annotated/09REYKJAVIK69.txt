[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's government is committed to supporting [ORG NATO  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] but new pledges of assistance are unlikely before parliamentary elections at the end of April , based on discussions with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister . 
In separate meetings with Ambassador , both ministers repeated the [ORG FM  ] 's pledges at [LOC Strasbourg/Kehl  ] to continue support for operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
For his part , [PER FM Skarphedinsson  ] noted that simply keeping [LOC Iceland  ] 's small [ORG ISAF  ] contingent in place has been a victory in view of pressure from the other party in government to withdraw entirely . 
Post does not anticipate a massive shift after the election ; all we can realistically hope for given the economic situation here is a plus-up by a handful of billets . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador delivered ref A points to [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] , [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs Permanent  ] Secretary [PER Benedikt Jonsson  ] , and Minister for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] in meetings April 6-8 . 
In each case , officials took the opportunity to reaffirm [LOC Iceland  ] 's commitment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but made no new pledges of support . 
PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] , not previously outspoken on [ORG NATO  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , or foreign affairs in general , noted the [LOC Strasbourg/Kehl Summit  ] 's strong focus on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Ambassador made the case that [LOC Iceland  ] 's international reputation has taken a beating due to the country 's economic difficulties . 
In these times , being seen as an active contributor to international reconstruction and stabilization efforts may be one of the most effective means to help displace " economic collapse " as the first association foreign observers have when thinking about [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The Prime Minister sidestepped a direct commitment but made it clear that Ambassador 's points were taken on board. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In subsequent meetings at the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , Ambassador made the same case , that the sterling reputation of its peacekeepers was a plus point in the eyes of the international community that the government should not let drop . 
Foreign Minister [PER Skarphedinsson  ] called the Ambassador 's argument persuasive , and agreed that efforts within [ORG NATO  ] or additional civilian reconstruction efforts would help improve the way the world sees [LOC Iceland  ] . 
However , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] , visibly wincing at the thought of financial contributions to overseas ventures in tough budget times , drew attention to the difficulty of making new commitments right now . 
He added that the [LOC U.S.  ] should be happy that [LOC Iceland  ] had fallen short of the Ambassador 's worst fears , i.e. , that the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG ISAF  ] contingent would be called home immediately when the [MISC Left-Greens  ] came in to government in February . 
The [PER FM  ] said his [ORG Social Democratic  ] party is under pressure from their [MISC Left-Green  ] coalition partners to cut back on [ORG NATO  ] activities , but that he has successfully countered these efforts so far . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] pledged to keep the Ambassador 's arguments in mind when looking at the budget again , but implied strongly that this would not happen before the April 25 parliamentary elections. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: The ministers' responses confirm what other senior officials have told post in recent weeks ; namely , that although ministry staff are strongly in favor of maintaining or expanding [LOC Iceland  ] 's [MISC Afghan  ] presence , the political leadership is not interested in moving before the elections . 
Both the PM and [ORG FM  ] stated strong faith in opinion polls that show the current government holding power after April 25 , and we believe they may be more open to reexamining the issue at that point . 
However , given the strong pressure to cut budgets at the [ORG MFA  ] and elsewhere , we may at best only be able to hope for an increase by a few billets in police advising or other " civilian-oriented " fields. van Voorst</pre></code>
