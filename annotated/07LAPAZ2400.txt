[ORG LA PAZ  ] 2386 Classified By: A/DCM [PER Mike Hammer  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . - - - - Summary - - - - <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Following Minister of the [ORG Presidency Quintana  ] 's August 29 attacks on [ORG USAID  ] in which he accused the [ORG USG  ] of supporting the opposition and told [ORG USAID  ] to get in line with government policies or leave the country , the opposition , [ORG NGOs  ] and pundits are defending [ORG USAID  ] and criticizing the government for the unwarranted attack . 
The official [ORG State Department  ] response to the [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's accusations has received wide coverage , and many editorials are suggesting that the [ORG MAS  ] attack on [ORG USAID  ] is a smokescreen to cover recent domestic problems including civic strikes , rising inflation and [MISC Venezuelan  ] cash assistance. - - - - - - - Blowing Smoke - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Many political commentators and opposition politicians have drawn attention to the timing of Minister [PER Quintana  ] 's diatribe , coming as it did only a day after six of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's nine departments shut down in strikes against the ruling [ORG MAS  ] government . 
The head of the opposition party [ORG National Unity  ] ( [ORG UN  ] ) [PER Samuel Doria Medina  ] said , " It 's an old method of ( [ORG Hugo  ] ) [ORG Chavez  ] . 
Every time he has a domestic problem , he insults the [LOC U.S.  ] government and fights with them . 
It 's no coincidence that on Tuesday there was a massive strike against the government of [PER Evo Morales  ] , and that now [ORG Quintana  ] comes out to tell lies and hoaxes . 
" In the words of [PER Carlos Hugo Molina  ] , one of the former government officials ( under [PER Goni Sanchez de Lozada  ] ) listed by [PER Quintana  ] as evidence that [ORG USAID  ] is financing the " old way " and the opposition: " They are trying to scare us...this should be denounced at international levels . 
" Another [ORG USAID  ] contractor , [PER Juan Carlos Urenda  ] ( a [PER Santa Cruz  ] civic leader ) described the [ORG MAS  ] accusations as an attempt to cast a smokescreen over the " serious problems in this country , " and opined that this was " another mistake of the government that will do no less than deepen the differences and confrontations in the country . 
" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Pay No Attention to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Behind the Curtain - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On August 29 , as Minister [PER Quintana  ] criticized [ORG USAID  ] 's " flagrant interference in [MISC Bolivian  ] politics " , President [PER Morales  ] was handing out [MISC Venezuelan  ] checks to mayors in the department of [ORG La Paz  ] . 
In the past , President [PER Morales  ] has publicly called for [MISC European  ] , [MISC Japanese  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] aid to be more like [MISC Venezuelan  ] aid , which in practice would mean almost no accountability or transparency . 
In his attack on [ORG USAID  ] , Minister [PER Quintana  ] praised [MISC European  ] aid for being transparent and for following [MISC Bolivian  ] laws . 
Although [PER Quintana  ] did not directly mention [MISC Venezuelan  ] aid , the [ORG MAS  ] is clearly responding to criticism of the increasing [MISC Venezuelan  ] influence in the country . 
The official government news source ABI on August 30 ran an article describing how President [PER Morales  ] has been handing out " cooperation checks " from [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
This attempted conflation of [MISC Venezuelan  ] and [MISC European  ] aid seems to be a [ORG MAS  ] attempt to both isolate the [LOC United States  ] and justify its acceptance of increasing [MISC Venezuelan  ] involvement in the country . 
Following [PER Quintana  ] 's presentation , Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] announced that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government will push for a new law to control the destination of international aid and will [ORG LA PAZ  ] 00002400 002 OF 003 investigate the programs of all international aid in [LOC Bolivia.  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Biting the Hand that Continues to Feed You - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Many Bolivians are concerned about the more immediate and concrete impact that could result from poking a stick at the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [MISC Bolivian  ] [ORG External Trade Institute  ] ( [ORG IBCE  ] ) is concerned for the future of [ORG ATPDEA  ] , pointing out that [LOC Bolivia  ] is even now preparing a proposal for the extension of [ORG ATPDEA  ] trade preferences . 
[ORG IBCE  ] head [PER Gary Rodriguez  ] stated , " We understand that the ( [MISC Bolivian  ] ) Government doesn't need trade preferences , but the workers do need them , as do entrepreneurs who seek to consolidate and not lose free access for their exports . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) More directly , many observers are pointing out that [LOC Bolivia  ] cannot afford to risk [MISC USD120  ] million in assistance from [ORG USAID  ] . 
Few are suggesting that all [ORG USAID  ] assistance could be lost , but concerns are rife that funding could be reduced in the future . 
While [PER Morales  ] and the [ORG MAS  ] may be willing to wave goodbye to our assistance , other officials either doubt that [LOC Venezuela  ] will step up to completely fill the gap or , pragmatically , see a benefit in receiving as much aid as possible from various sources . 
( Comment: At a time when Vice President [PER Linera  ] is heading to [LOC Washington  ] to , among other issues , push for [LOC Millennium Challenge  ] aid to [LOC Bolivia  ] and a continuation of [ORG ATPDEA  ] trade benefits , the timing of the attacks against the [ORG USG  ] seems self-defeating .

( C ) Minister [PER Quintana  ] also announced his " suspicions of [LOC U.S.  ] double morality " in the fight against drugs , questioning the [LOC U.S.  ] focus on cocaine in [LOC Bolivia  ] while claiming that marijuana is not part of counternarcotics programs here . 
[PER Quintana  ] said that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government is investigating NAS assistance and will publish their findings in the following weeks . 
( Comment: It is understandable that a government whose president is also the head of the coca-growers union would turn its sights on NAS 's programs . 
Considering the egregious accusations that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government has just leveled at [ORG USAID  ] , we expect that their 'investigation' of NAS will be equally rigorous .

( C ) In the wake of [PER Quintana  ] 's press conference , [ORG USAID  ] has received an outpouring of support . 
Many partner [ORG NGOs  ] are publicly challenging the government 's accusations , and some have requested more information from [ORG USAID  ] in order to repudiate the [ORG MAS  ] stance . 
Morale in [ORG USAID  ] could take a hit , particularly among the [MISC Bolivian  ] locally-engaged staff , some of whom fear that after [PER Quintana  ] 's threats and insinuations about 'traitors' who 's ell out their country' , they may be targeted by the [ORG MAS  ] in the future . 
Their fears are not unfounded , considering that [PER Quintana  ] named [ORG USAID  ] contractors , listed their posts in previous governments , and accused them of working against the [ORG MAS  ] program of change . 
To address initial concerns and assure employees of [ORG USG  ] support , [ORG USAID  ] held an all-hands staff meeting right after [PER Quintana  ] 's press briefing . 
The Ambassador will hold a mission wide townhall meeting immediately upon his return to [LOC La Paz  ] .
