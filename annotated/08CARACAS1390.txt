( [LOC C  ] ) The evening of September 30 , [ORG American Airlines Country Manager  ] [PER Omar Nottaro  ] ( strictly protect throughout ) called Econoff to report that the captain and crew of [ORG American Airlines  ] flight 903 were being held at the airport . 
He explained that upon landing a crew member said " Welcome to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Local [PER Chavez  ] time is " X . 
( NOTE: In December 2007 [LOC Venezuela  ] created its own time zone , moving the clock back half an hour on a permanent basis . 
The crew member was likely trying to remind passengers of this and to suggest they turn their watches back 30 minutes . 
END NOTE . 
) According to [PER Nottaro  ] , a passenger and friend of [ORG Venezuelan National Assemblyman  ] [PER Carlos Echezuria Rodriguez  ] , thought the crew member had said " loco [PER Chavez  ] time . 
" [PER Nottaro  ] 's report of what the crew said is contradicted by a copy of the [ORG Venezuelan Immigration  ] ( [ORG ONIDEX  ] ) report obtained by a [ORG Consular Section  ] Interpol contact which states the announcement had instead been , " the hour of the crazy [PER Chavez  ] and his women " . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The passenger , [PER Nestor Maldonado Lanza  ] , told Deputy [PER Rodriguez  ] who was waiting for him outside , that the pilot had called President [PER Chavez  ] crazy . 
The Deputy called [MISC Venezuelan  ] Vice President Carrizales to report the incident . 
The Vice President called civil aviation authority ( [ORG INAC  ] ) President [PER Martinez  ] who went to the airport . 
The Directorate for [MISC Venezuelan  ] Domestic Intelligence and Prevention , [ORG DISIP  ] , opened an investigation . 
However , because [ORG ONIDEX  ] had not allowed the crew to go through customs , [ORG DISIP  ] backed out of investigation and turned it over to [ORG ONIDEX  ] which had jurisdiction as the crew had not officially entered [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The crew then waited inside the airport for the results of a meeting between airport , [ORG ONIDEX  ] , [ORG INAC  ] and [ORG American Airlines  ] staff. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Nottaro  ] stated Deputy [PER Rodriguez  ] demanded to hear the on-board recordings of in-flight announcements and wanted each crew member to give a statement . 
[PER Nottaro  ] was able to diffuse the situation by promising to put the crew back on the empty airplane as soon as it was refueled and get the captain and crew out of the country immediately . 
[PER Nottaro  ] also apologized in person to [ORG INAC  ] President [PER Martinez  ] and committed to writing several letters of apology on October 1 . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] authorities accepted [PER Nottaro  ] 's offer and the crew left [LOC Venezuela  ] at 11:30 pm . 
[MISC American  ] made the decision to turn the plane around even though it meant canceling [MISC AA  ] flight 902 out of [LOC Caracas  ] the morning of October 1 , at considerable cost to the airline. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) This is the second incident involving [LOC U.S.  ] flight crews at the [LOC Caracas  ] airport in the last month . 
The first incident on September 13 involved a [LOC Delta  ] flight crew ( reftel ) . 
It is yet another example of how heightened sensitivities are in the bilateral relationship when a chance remark escalates within minutes to the level of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Vice Presidency .
