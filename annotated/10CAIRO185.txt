[PER Afifi  ] said the criticism is largely focused on [MISC Egyptian  ] foreign policy , especially [LOC Cairo  ] 's relations with [LOC Israel  ] , but [MISC Algerian  ] media has also " attacked the political equilibrium and the future of power in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
" [PER Afifi  ] said the [MISC Egyptian  ] media had complied with a request from the [ORG GOE  ] to cease attacks on [LOC Algeria  ] in early December , and did not understand why [MISC Algerian  ] media attacks continued . 
He said some believe the continuing criticism is related to internal [MISC Algerian  ] politics ; he noted that President [PER Boutiflika  ] and [PER FM Medelci  ] had been careful in their statements , but Said [PER Boutiflika  ] , ( the president 's younger brother ) had been leading the antagonism. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

Nevertheless , [PER Afifi  ] said the [ORG GOE  ] policy will continue to focus on a positive public posture toward [LOC Algeria  ] .
