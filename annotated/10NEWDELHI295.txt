( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Indian  ] Army’s “Cold Start Doctrine” is a mixture of myth and reality . 
It has never been and may never be put to use on a battlefield because of substantial and serious resource constraints , but it is a developed operational attack plan announced in 2004 and intended to be taken off the shelf and implemented within a 72-hour period during a crisis . 
[ORG Cold Start  ] is not a plan for a comprehensive invasion and occupation of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Instead , it calls for a rapid , time- and distance-limited penetration into [MISC Pakistani  ] territory with the goal of quickly punishing [LOC Pakistan  ] , possibly in response to a [MISC Pakistan-linked  ] terrorist attack in [LOC India  ] , without threatening the survival of the [MISC Pakistani  ] state or provoking a nuclear response . 
It was announced by the [MISC BJP-led  ] government in 2004 , but the government of Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] has not publicly embraced [ORG Cold Start  ] and [ORG GOI  ] uncertainty over [MISC Pakistani  ] nuclear restraint may inhibit future implementation by any government . 
If the [ORG GOI  ] were to implement [ORG Cold Start  ] given present [MISC Indian  ] military capabilities , it is the collective judgment of the [LOC Mission  ] that [LOC India  ] would encounter mixed results . 
The [ORG GOI  ] failed to implement [ORG Cold Start  ] in the wake of the audacious November 2008 [MISC Pakistan-linked  ] terror attack in [LOC Mumbai  ] , which calls into question the willingness of the [ORG GOI  ] to implement [ORG Cold Start  ] in any form and thus roll the nuclear dice . 
At the same time , the existence of the plan reassures the [MISC Indian  ] public and may provide some limited deterrent effect on [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Taken together , these factors underline that the value of the doctrine to the [ORG GOI  ] may lie more in the plan’s existence than in any real world application . 
End Summary . 
What It Is and What It Is Not ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As we understand it , [ORG Cold Start  ] is an operational plan devised by the [ORG Indian Army  ] and designed to make a rapid and limited penetration into [MISC Pakistani  ] territory with the goal of quickly punishing [LOC Pakistan  ] over some event , such as a [MISC Pakistan-linked  ] terrorist attack in [LOC India  ] , without threatening the survival of the [MISC Pakistani  ] state or provoking a nuclear response . 
[ORG Cold Start  ] is not a plan for the comprehensive invasion or occupation of [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG Cold Start  ] is said to have been formulated after the [MISC Indian  ] Army’s slow and drawn-out 2002 mobilization in response to the fatal 2001 [MISC Pakistan-linked  ] terror attack on the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Parliament  ] . 
The lengthy process of mobilization , lack of strategic and operational flexibility , and the resulting lack of any element of surprise drew criticism from [MISC Indian  ] politicians and opinion leaders , which prompted [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Army  ] planners to devise [ORG Cold Start  ] . 
( See Reftel for further details on [ORG Cold Start’s  ] genesis ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In order to avoid the [MISC Indian  ] Army’s slow and lumbering military mobilization process and preserve the element of surprise in attack , [ORG Cold Start  ] attacks could begin within 72 hours after the attack order has been given , and would be led by armored spearheads launched from prepared forward positions in [LOC Punjab  ] and [LOC Rajasthan  ] . 
As described , the plan emphasizes speed and overwhelming firepower: armored formations and accompanying infantry would advance into eastern [LOC Pakistan  ] with limited goals in terms of distance and in terms of duration . 
Although the plan reportedly has a significant air support component , it is unclear to us how much joint versus parallel planning has taken place . 
We have not heard of a major operational role for the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Navy  ] or parallel sea-launched attacks . 
( [PER Reftel  ] provides further analysis of the military aspects of [ORG Cold Start  ] doctrine and implementation ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A positive attribute of [ORG Cold Start  ] from the [MISC Indian  ] perspective is that the short 72-hour time period between decision and attack could shield the [ORG GOI  ] from international pressure to refrain from taking military action against [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
India’s prolonged 2002 mobilization period gave the international community notice of [MISC Indian  ] troop movements and allowed plenty of time for a series of [MISC Western  ] interlocutors to lobby [ORG GOI  ] leaders . 
Even if the plan is never actually implemented -- and there is considerable question as to [ORG GOI  ] intent to ever implement it -- news of [ORG Cold Start’s  ] existence has already paid dividends to [MISC Indian  ] policymakers by providing reassurance to the [MISC Indian  ] public that the [ORG GOI  ] has the means to punish [LOC Pakistan  ] for attacks on [MISC Indian  ] soil without triggering potential mutually-assured nuclear destruction . 
From the [MISC Indian  ] perspective , the unimplemented plan has the added virtue of accentuating [MISC Pakistani  ] discomfiture and angst , which in theory may have some deterrent value . 
Prospects for [ORG Cold Start  ] ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As noted above , [ORG GOI  ] intent to ever actually implement [ORG Cold Start  ] is very much an open question . 
The [ORG Cold Start  ] doctrine was announced in April 2004 by the [MISC BJP-led  ] government that was replaced shortly thereafter by the [PER Manmohan Singh  ] government , which has not since publicly embraced [ORG Cold Start  ] . 
A political green-light to implement [ORG Cold Start  ] , fraught as it is with potential nuclear consequences , would involve a highly opaque decision-making process and would likely necessitate broad political consensus , a factor that could prolong the time between a precipitating event such as a [MISC Pakistan-linked  ] terror attack and [ORG Cold Start  ] deployment ( which in turn could reduce the element of surprise ) . 
We lack firm details of the decision-making process that the political leadership would use in the event of an incident that would trigger consideration of [ORG Cold Start  ] or other military action against [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
The precise function of the [ORG Cabinet Committee  ] on Security in ratifying decisions to take military action , the character of the military’s advisory responsibilities to the [ORG Cabinet  ] , the possible ad hoc nature of decision-making in the upper levels of the [MISC Indian  ] government and the role of [ORG Congress Party  ] figures like [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] in this process are not clearly understood. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) If the [ORG GOI  ] were to implement [ORG Cold Start  ] given present [MISC Indian  ] military capabilities , it is the collective judgment of the [LOC Mission  ] that [LOC India  ] would likely encounter very mixed results . 
[MISC Indian  ] forces could have significant problems consolidating initial gains due to logistical difficulties and slow reinforcement . 
Reftel sets forth in detail the various resource challenges that [LOC India  ] would have to overcome , challenges that range from road and rail transportation to ammunition supply . 
In addition , [ORG Cold Start’s  ] reliance on swift mobile advance would have to contend with a large number of built-up populated areas in [LOC Pakistan  ] that the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Army  ] did not have to face in 1971 , the last time it advanced in force into [MISC Pakistani  ] [LOC Punjab  ] and [LOC Sindh.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Indian  ] leaders no doubt realize that , although [ORG Cold Start  ] is designed to punish [LOC Pakistan  ] in a limited manner without triggering a nuclear response , they can not be sure whether [MISC Pakistani  ] leaders will in fact refrain from such a response . 
Even in the absence of a [MISC Pakistani  ] nuclear response , [ORG GOI  ] leaders are aware also that even a limited [MISC Indian  ] incursion into [LOC Pakistan  ] will likely lead to international condemnation of [MISC Indian  ] action and a resulting loss of the moral high ground that [ORG GOI  ] leaders believe [LOC India  ] enjoys in its contentious relationship with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We think that the November 2008 [MISC Pakistan-linked  ] terror attack in [LOC Mumbai  ] and its immediate aftermath provide insight into [MISC Indian  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] thinking on [ORG Cold Start  ] . 
First , the [ORG GOI  ] refrained from implementing [ORG Cold Start  ] even after an attack as audacious and bloody as the [LOC Mumbai  ] attack , which calls into serious question the GOI’s willingness to actually adopt the [ORG Cold Start  ] option . 
Second , the [MISC Pakistanis  ] have known about [ORG Cold Start  ] since 2004 , but this knowledge does not seem to have prompted them to prevent terror attacks against [LOC India  ] to extent such attacks could be controlled . 
This fact calls into question [ORG Cold Start’s  ] ability to deter [MISC Pakistani  ] mischief inside [LOC India  ] . 
Even more so , it calls into question the degree of sincerity of fear over [ORG Cold Start  ] as expressed by [MISC Pakistani  ] military leaders to [ORG USG  ] officials . 
[ORG Cold Start  ] is not India’s only or preferred option after a terrorist attack . 
Depending on the nature , location , lethality , public response , and timing of a terrorist attack , [LOC India  ] might not respond at all or could pursue one of several other possible options . 
Finally , several very high level [ORG GOI  ] officials have firmly stated , when asked directly about their support for [ORG Cold Start  ] , that they have never endorsed , supported , or advocated for this doctrine . 
One of these officials is former [ORG National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan  ] , who has recently been replaced . 
While the army may remain committed to the goals of the doctrine , political support is less clear .
