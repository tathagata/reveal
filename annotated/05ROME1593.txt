( [ORG S  ] ) Summary and Recommendation: On May 5-6 , PM [PER Berlusconi  ] spoke to both houses of Parliament about the joint investigation and separate reports of the March 4 shooting of [MISC Italian  ] Intelligence officer [PER Nicola Calipari  ] by [LOC US  ] forces near [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
While [PER Berlusconi  ] defended the [MISC Italian  ] report and took issue with some of the [LOC US  ] report’s findings ( see synopsis of his remarks at para 3 ) , he reaffirmed the points of most importance to us: the incident was unintentional ; US-Italy relations and our alliance remain strong ; and [LOC Italy  ] remains committed to its involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
We continue to recommend letting the [LOC US  ] report speak for us rather than prolonging public debate . 
While the issue appears to be losing steam here , we still must deal with the MLAT requests and the possibility of a continuing investigation by [MISC Italian  ] prosecutors . 
End summary and recommendation <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On May 5 , PM [PER Berlusconi  ] briefed the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] and the [ORG Senate  ] on the [MISC Italian  ] and [LOC US  ] reports that concluded the work of the joint investigation in to the March 4 shooting of [MISC Italian  ] Intelligence officer [PER Nicola Calipari  ] by [LOC US  ] forces near [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] , in televised session , was flanked by FM [MISC Fini  ] and other cabinet ministers . 
A debate followed . 
A synopsis of his remarks , as reported in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] transcript follows ( his report to the [ORG Senate  ] was nearly identical ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Begin synopsis of transcript: The impossibility of reaching shared conclusions....certainly mean that the joint investigation...was not able to bring its task to full completion . 
Nonetheless , it is also true that the [LOC US  ] decision to open a joint investigation with [LOC Italy  ] is unprecedented and came in response to a request by the [MISC Italian  ] government . 
Investigations were objectively conditioned by the lack of preservation of the scene of the incident . 
This notwithstanding , the work of the joint investigation team was carried out in a climate of strong mutual cooperation and the [MISC Italian  ] members of the team had full access to -- and were enabled to acquire -- all the information available . 
Discrepancies between the [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC American  ] reports turned out to be irreducible and I will certainly not be the one to minimize the size of the disagreement . 
Discrepancies in the two texts touch on aspects that are far from being marginal . 
The [LOC US  ] considered reliable testimony and data that do not coincide with what we collected and which we found were reliable . 
In particular , the declarations by the two [MISC Italian  ] survivors are in contrast with those by the [LOC US  ] military . 
Given that the impartiality and good faith of the [LOC US  ] investigators cannot be under discussion , and I think we all agree on this , we cannot but respect their conclusions , noting that they do not coincide with ours . 
This is even the opinion of the [MISC Americans  ] on our results and also , their report converges with ours on this -- it recognizes that not everything worked as it should have in preparing/locating and managing that blocking position . 
Both sides , however , recognize that the incident was unintentional and both sides recognize the need to take concrete operational measures to avoid similar occurrences in the future . 
Still , one thing is to conclude like the [MISC Americans  ] did , because of disciplinary measures , and another is to underscore , as we did -- and I quote -- on the basis of acquired evidence that there was a lack of intention . 
The absence of criminal intent -- the intention -- does not rule out the guilt/responsibility that is ascribable to negligence , imprudence or even simply inexperience . 
And this , you will agree , is not a small difference . 
The [MISC Italian  ] report concluded that the blocking positions was irregular . 
It was set up with no written or specific instructions and was located where it had little visibility and could not protect the security of the military manning it nor that of drivers of vehicles approaching it . 
Accusations and criticism of the Government for how it managed the [PER Calipari  ] case and for the conclusion of the joint investigation are paradoxical . 
If we believe one vision of the facts is credible rather than another , it evidently cannot be friendship to make one change one’s mind . 
This is elementary and holds true for both the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Italy  ] . 
The friendship between [LOC Italy  ] and the [LOC US  ] is not under discussion . 
The alliance and the friendship with the [LOC United states  ] have solid foundations , foundations that we are committed to consolidating every day against the threat of totalitarianism and terrorism . 
Our friendship has overcome even more difficult tests . 
To this day , [LOC Italy  ] recognizes itself in the [ORG Le Monde  ] headline after the 9/11 tragedy that read , “We are all [MISC Americans.”  ] Our commitment to do what is possible to ascertain the truth and possible responsibilities remains unchanged . 
It is a commitment we intend to honor , first and foremost for the respect we owe to the memory of [PER Nicola Calipari  ] . 
The [MISC Italian  ] judiciary can count on the firm support of the Government . 
I want to free the ground from any misunderstanding: there is no connection between the investigation into the circumstances of the death of [PER Calipari  ] and the continuation of the [MISC Italian  ] commitment toward reconstruction in Iraq...We do not intend to establish any kind of link between the assessment of the event in which our official lost his life and [MISC Italy’s  ] role in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Italy  ] is in [LOC Iraq  ] in compliance with a [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] . 
End synopsis of transcript. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In response to press questions after the debate , [PER Berlusconi  ] said: The [MISC Center-Left  ] opposition’s attitude was “responsible , ” because they did not place under discussion the alliance nor the friendship with the [LOC US  ] . 
The opposition continues to ask for our withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] , which is in the plans , in agreement with the [LOC Iraq  ] government and the allies . 
In the past , we have made announcements to this effect and we hold to this prospect . 
There is no reason today to say , “everybody home.” It would sound irresponsible and incomprehensible . 
On the progressive withdrawal of troops from [LOC Iraq  ] we already announced our position some time ago . 
We already discussed it with our main allies . 
We will continue to talk with them . 
A progressive reduction of our presence will certainly occur . 
I had even given an indication of when . 
Everything will be in agreement with the [MISC Iraqi  ] government and with our allies . 
I even spoke about it directly and personally with [MISC Bush  ] and [PER Blair  ] . 
Therefore , we continue in this direction . 
An international conference on [LOC Iraq  ] will soon take place . 
[MISC Italian  ] efforts for the reconstruction of [LOC Iraq  ] are not isolated and even [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG EU  ] are now involved. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) COMMENT: Berlusconi’s remarks , while reassuring on [LOC Iraq  ] and on [MISC US-Italy  ] relations , also reflect a position he and his government staked out on the [PER Calipari  ] case from the beginning: a commitment to fix responsibility . 
Although this commitment was not actually included in the joint investigation’s terms of reference , [PER Berlusconi  ] evidently felt an obligation to adhere to it . 
We believe this was at the heart of [MISC US-Italian  ] disagreements over the joint investigation conclusions and set the tone of both the [MISC Italian  ] report and Berlusconi’s remarks to Parliament . 
In particular , the determination to avoid any criticism of Calipari’s own role led the [MISC Italian  ] government and investigators to ignore a question that seemed obvious to the [LOC US  ] investigation: out of the 30 cars that came to the blocking position , why was this the only car fired upon that night ? 
As in [LOC Reftel  ] , we continue to urge [LOC Washington  ] to discourage USG spokespeople from point-by-point refutation of the [MISC Italian  ] report or Berlusconi’s remarks . 
As much as possible , we should allow our report to speak for itself on our view of the incident . 
This will hasten the fading of the case from the political radar screen. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [LOC Baghdad  ] minimize considered .
