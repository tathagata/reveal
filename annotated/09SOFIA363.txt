SOFIA  ] 0069 B. [PER SEPTEL Classified  ] By: Ambassador [PER Nancy McEldowney  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: Bulgaria’s highest profile energy project -- the [ORG Belene Nuclear Power Plant  ] ( [ORG BNPP  ] ) is dogged by cost overruns , financing woes , construction delays , and now serious safety and quality assurance concerns . 
[ORG Belene  ] may end up costing [LOC Bulgaria  ] more than money in the long run . 
Despite the repeated objections by project experts , END SUMMARY. --------------------------- SAFETY AND QUALITY IGNORED --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Marred by many technical , political , and financial problems , the [ORG Belene  ] NPP project continues to move forward despite strong warnings about project safety and quality by project experts . 
[ORG NEC  ] , which controls 51 percent of the project along with strategic investor Germany’s [ORG RWE  ] with 49 percent , keeps pressing to start the “Site Preparation [MISC Phase”  ] in September 2009 even before the “Demolition [MISC Phase”  ] is completed in August 2009 . 
( Demolition Phase includes the destruction and removal of the existing old site infrastructure . 
) According to project insiders , <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Pressed to meet its own self-imposed deadlines , XXXXXXXXXXXX to the “overnight creation” of temporary structures , and the lack of a [ORG Quality Assurance  ] ( [ORG QA  ] ) [ORG Program Plan  ] for the temporary structures . 
( Construction of temporary structures during the “Demolition [MISC Phase”  ] and “Site Preparation [MISC Phase”  ] is a routine process and facilitates the storage of equipment and manufacturing of key construction components such as concrete ) . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Another problem area is the lack of an overall detailed technical and quality assurance plan for [ORG BNPP  ] . 
As of late June 2009 , [PER Russia’s Atomstroyexport  ] ( [ORG ASE  ] ) -- [ORG Belene  ] NPP’s main foreign contractor -- has yet to provide [ORG NEC  ] with an overall [ORG Quality Assurance  ] ( [ORG QA  ] ) [ORG Program Plan  ] . 
A [ORG QA Program Plan  ] is required before the Technical Design Approval Order ( [ORG TDAO  ] ) can be issued and certainly well before the [MISC Bulgarian  ] [ORG Nuclear Regulatory Agency  ] ( [ORG NRA  ] ) can issue a Construction Permit for [ORG BNPP  ] , making the targeted start dates of September 2009 and December 2010 virtually impossible. ------------------------------- LESS THAN A GLOWING ENDORSEMENT ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG NEC  ] is rushing to complete the “Demolition [MISC Phase”  ] and start the “Site Preparation [MISC Phase”  ] to make [ORG Belene  ] look financially viable , attract additional international funding , [LOC SOFIA  ] 00000363 002 OF 002 and keep [ORG RWE  ] as a strategic investor . 
Our contacts told us [ORG RWE  ] will not provide funding until “financial closure” and it sees the “first concrete poured , ” which is currently estimated for December 2010 . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG RWE  ] is clearly feeling “buyer’s remorse” about its participation in [LOC Belene  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX [LOC Belene  ] experts said that [ORG RWE  ] remains “in the dark” on most on-site day-to-day and technical issues . 
During a late May 2009 [LOC Belene  ] project meeting , [ORG RWE  ] asked numerous basic questions , indicating that they have not seen any of the on-site safety and environmental reports . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX Media reports theorize that [ORG RWE  ] is trying to pull out of [LOC Belene  ] . 
Some contacts suggest that [ORG RWE  ] will wait until after the [MISC Bulgarian  ] ( July 5 ) and [MISC German  ] ( September ) elections before announcing the fate of its future participation in [ORG BNPP  ] , as GERB officials have expressed strong negative views toward the project. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The current [MISC BSP-led  ] government has repeatedly pushed for [LOC Belene  ] , especially with 700 million euros in sunk costs and priceless political capital invested in the project . 
The [MISC Bulgarians  ] and [ORG RWE  ] initially wanted commercial financing for the entire project , but were unable to attract funding from [MISC Western  ] banks -- wary of extending a large loan to an increasingly questionable project in the midst of the global financial crisis . 
In early June , [MISC Bulgarian  ] Energy Holding ( [ORG BEH  ] ) CEO [PER Galina Tosheva  ] confirmed [MISC Russian  ] approval for a 3.8 billion EUR ( 5.4 billion USD ) loan for [LOC Belene  ] . 
The [MISC Bulgarians  ] are still in the dark on actual details . 
[PER Tosheva  ] told us that she expects [MISC Russian  ] PM Putin will dictate the loans terms directly to [MISC Bulgarian  ] PM [PER Stanishev.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT: Vested interests -- the current [MISC BSP-led  ] government , [ORG NEC  ] , well-connected politicians , [MISC Bulgarian  ] energy oligarchs , and [MISC Russian  ] investors -- keep pushing the project . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX Since [ORG BNPP  ] began , the corresponding technical documentation , the ongoing demolition , and site preparation activities have not been investigated , audited , or approved by the [ORG International Atomic Energy Association  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) . 
[PER Bisser Boev  ] , a member of GERB’s economic team , told us that as of late June , [LOC Belene  ] also has no updated economic or technical feasibility study . 
We should encourage the next government to quickly begin its due-diligence on the project ; stressing the importance of meeting all international safety and quality assurance standards , and bringing in the [ORG IAEA  ] and the [ORG EU’s European Atomic Energy Community  ] ( [ORG EURATOM  ] ) to perform an on-site inspection . 
END COMMENT .
