( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
Mission [LOC Brazil  ] herewith recommends annual recertification by the President of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Air Bridge Denial Program  ] ( [ORG ABD  ] ) , based on the information below , which is formatted in paras 2-9 in accordance with [ORG Department 's  ] instructions in ref [PER A. End  ] summary . 
PART A: GOB ADHERENCE TO AGREED SAFETY AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Per ref B instructions , [MISC PolCouns  ] , Air Attache and Assistant Air Attache met on 13 July at the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] with [ORG Major Brigadeiro  ] do [LOC Ar  ] ( three star equivalent ) [PER Ricardo Machado Viera  ] , who commands [LOC Brazil  ] 's integrated air defense and air traffic control system ( [ORG COMDABRA  ] ) , to consult on the status of [LOC Brazil  ] 's air bridge denial ( " shootdown " ) program . 
[PER Machado  ] , who was accompanied by two other officers from the ministry , has senior operational command authority over all aspects of air defense and air traffic control in [LOC Brazil  ] , and has been involved in all discussions with the [ORG USG  ] on the shootdown issue for several years . 
[PER Machado  ] understands the [ORG USG  ] 's process for renewal of the [MISC Presidential Determination  ] covering [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] in its [ORG ABD  ] program , and he provided ( or undertook to provide ) answers regarding issues raised in reftel . 
On key points , he affirmed: ( 1 ) that there have been no/no lethal force events in the program over the past year , and ( 2 ) there have been no/no changes in the operational and safety procedures referenced in the September 2004 exchange of diplomatic notes between the GOB and [ORG USG  ] . 
Moreover , he offered a review of the program 's functioning in practice , reiterated that [LOC Brazil  ] 's program is focused on dissuasion , and offered ( in confidence ) his assurance that [LOC Brazil  ] 's air force would only use lethal force in the context of a carefully pre-planned operation coordinated with police authorities , in which there is certainty about the criminal identity and intent of any suspect , non-cooperative aircraft. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) With regard to ref B issues , [PER Machado  ] affirmed to [MISC PolCouns  ] and [ORG DAO  ] officers that: -- There have been no/no incidents of use of lethal force since the advent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program until the present date -- neither warning shots nor rounds fired with the intent of disabling/destroying a suspect aircraft ; -- There have been no/no changes of any kind in the [MISC Brazilian  ] program 's operational and safety procedures from those referenced in the September 2004 exchange of notes between the GOB and [ORG USG  ] regarding [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program ; -- [LOC Brazil  ] 's ability to " see " and track unusual and suspect air activity has improved dramatically with the full implementation of the [ORG SIVAM  ] Amazon surveillance system ( which uses both ground radar and [MISC Embraer R-99  ] AWACs-type aircraft ) , introduction of the [MISC A-29  ] [ORG ALX  ] " [MISC Super Tucano  ] " fighter aircraft and secure data links . 
As a result , there is an increase in the number of " air tracks of interest " recorded by [ORG COMDABRA  ] over the past year . 
[PER Machado  ] undertook to provide asap his command 's statistics on ATOIs , interceptions , and force downs from October 2005 to 30 July 2006. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the operational and safety procedures of [LOC Brazil  ] 's program are unchanged from those referenced in the September 2004 exchange of notes , the increased capacity and sophistication of [ORG BRAF  ] equipment and methods are enhancing the program 's efficiency and safety , [PER Machado  ] said . 
The [MISC R-99  ] airborne radar aircraft acquired for [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG SIVAM  ] program are providing vastly improved coverage , especially when deployed for intensive patrols to areas where there is a perceived spike in irregular air activity . 
The [MISC R-99  ] aircraft can interact seamlessly via data links with ground bases and with the [MISC A-29  ] interceptors now coming on line with the [ORG BRAF  ] , which are faster , have longer range , and possess sophisticated avionics and surveillance equipment . 
For example , [PER Machado  ] said an [MISC R-99  ] can locate and track a suspect aircraft beyond visual range , then " stand off " on station as an [MISC A-29  ] moves into position to trail the suspect craft . 
The [MISC A-29  ] can transmit video images of the suspect plane in real time to both the [MISC R-99  ] and [ORG COMDABRA  ] ground stations , and all radio communications between the [ORG BRAF  ] interceptor and the suspect plane are also transmitted . 
Hence the type , tail number and physical aspect of the plane can be seen , facilitating identification by [ORG BRAF  ] and the police . 
The video and audio records are available for after-action assessment or investigation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Machado  ] said that the [ORG BRAF  ] and [ORG COMDABRA  ] now also have superior data bases and modalities in operation for checking suspect aircraft . 
[ORG COMDABRA  ] center commanders are linked directly by secure phones to senior [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] ( [ORG DPF  ] ) officials in [LOC Brasilia  ] and can instantly check tail numbers or other data against police records . 
All coordination with the [ORG DPF  ] is centralized at [ORG DPF  ] headquarters in [LOC Brasilia  ] , and the [ORG BRAF  ] will not act on information or requests for air force support coming from [ORG DPF  ] field offices , or from state police agencies . 
The [ORG BRAF  ] also has its own data base of tail numbers of civil aircraft that have irregular or suspect flight histories in [MISC Brazilian  ] air space. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Emphasizing that the GOB 's approach to its [ORG ABD  ] program has always been focused on its use as a tool of dissuasion , [PER Machado  ] noted that , before implementation of the shootdown legislation , narcotrafficking pilots would brazenly ignore [ORG BRAF  ] fighters' orders , and even non-criminal pilots would sometimes take a nonchalant attitude toward responding to air force hails . 
Now , aircraft intercepted , hailed and interrogated by [ORG COMDABRA  ] aircraft have a " 100 percent " rate of responding and obeying , he added . 
PART B: SITE VISITS TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTERS: <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ref A requested site visits by Embassy officers to at least two air traffic control facilities in [LOC Brazil  ] , to confirm the level of awareness among [ORG ATC  ] personnel of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program and its procedures . 
[ORG Mission  ] reiterates ref C information that all/repeat/all air traffic control in [LOC Brazil  ] , including civil aviation , is handled by uniformed [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] personnel . 
The [ORG ATC  ] centers are co-located with air defense centers at four [ORG BRAF  ] facilities which conduct ATC/air defense for the entire country . 
These four regional [ORG BRAF Centers  ] for [ORG Air Defense  ] and [ORG Air Traffic Control  ] ( [ORG CINDACTA  ] 's ) are in addition to air traffic " towers " at larger airfields which control only local take-offs and landings . 
Hence unlike the [LOC U.S.  ] , civil air traffic control in [LOC Brazil  ] is not dispersed to various regional , state , and municipal airports , but is concentrated exclusively in the four air force centers . 
Embassy has received [ORG BRAF  ] authorization to visit two of the centers on 26-27 September: [ORG CINDACTA  ] II in [LOC Recife  ] ( covering northeastern [LOC Brazil  ] ) and [ORG CINDACTA  ] I in [LOC Brasilia  ] ( covering central [LOC Brazil  ] ) . 
Embassy [ORG DAO  ] personnel will make the site visits and we will report findings immediately thereafter via septel . 
PART C: GOB EFFORTS TO PUBLICIZE [ORG ABD  ] PROGRAM: <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) On 16 September , [MISC PolCouns  ] , [ORG Air Attache  ] and Assistant [ORG Air Attache  ] again met with [PER Brigadeiro Machado  ] , [ORG COMBADRA  ] commander , at his headquarters in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
Per ref A questions , [PER Machado  ] provided the following information on GOB and [ORG BRAF  ] measures to publicize the existence and procedures of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG ABD  ] program since it entered into force in October 2004: -- [PER Machado  ] confirmed that the GOB had issued Notice to Airmen ( [ORG NOTAM  ] ) bulletins , per international procedures , when [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002002 003 OF 003 [LOC Brazil  ] 's program was publicly announced by then-Defense Minister Viegas in October 2004 . 
Per standard [ORG NOTAM  ] procedures , the [ORG NOTAM  ] remained published for 56 days , until such time as information about the [ORG ABD  ] program was permanently incorporated into [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Aeronautic Information Package  ] ( [ORG AIP  ] ) . 
The information is now contained in the [ORG AIP  ] , and is available on the [ORG BRAF  ] 's website , [PER Machado  ] said , adding that [LOC Brazil  ] 's civil aviation law has also been amended to reflect the [ORG ABD  ] program 's existence and scope . 
-- The GOB and [ORG BRAF  ] also undertook a 30-day media campaign in October 2004 , with both the Defense Minister and [PER Machado  ] conducting extensive interviews with national TV , radio and print media , [PER Machado  ] said . 
In addition , posters outlining the [ORG ABD  ] program and its procedures have been posted in public spaces and pilot ready rooms ( where flight plans are logged ) at airports throughout [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Machado  ] said . 
PART D: STATISTICS: <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to [ORG Mission  ] request , the [ORG BRAF  ] provided in an official communique to the [ORG Mission  ] the following statistics for the [LOC Brazil  ] [ORG ABD  ] program , for the period from 1 September 2005 through 31 July 2006: I. Unknown air tracks: 4,567 II . 
Suspect air tracks ( i.e. , considered suspect owing to routes utilized , but not necessarily illegal ) ; OBS: This number is included in I: 108 III . 
Interceptions realized: 254 IV: Enforcement measures applied: a . 
Change of route: 1 b . 
Obligatory landing: 1 c . 
Warning fire: 0 d . 
Destructive fire: 0 [PER V. Quantity  ] of drugs aprehended by police authorities as consquence of realized interceptions: 564 kg . 
VI . 
Statistic for daily average of unknown air tracks: 21.7 ( Embassy [PER Note: Machado  ] confirmed that IV a and b , and V refer to the joint [ORG BRAF-Federal Police  ] operation described by [PER Machado  ] in ref [PER C. End  ] Embassy note . 
) [ORG MISSION  ] RECOMMENDATION: <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is this [ORG Mission  ] 's assessment that [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] and GOB procedures for the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Bridge Denial  ] program continue to fully comply with the mutually agreed terms referenced in the September 2004 USG-GOB exchange of diplomatic notes constituting our bilateral understanding of [LOC Brazil  ] 's program . 
On that basis , and subject to septel provision of information deemed satisfactory by Department for Part B above , this [ORG Mission  ] recommends Presidential recertification of the [LOC Brazil  ] [ORG ABD  ] program in October 2006 .
