[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 208 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Gene A. Cretz  ] , Ambassador . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: State media took over the quasi-independent al-Libiyya satellite television channel on April 24 in the middle of an interview program featuring [ORG Revolutionary Committee  ] ( [ORG RevComm  ] ) member [PER Mustafa Zaidi  ] . 
The state-run al-Jamahiriya channel immediately began to simulcast its programming on al-Libiyya 's signal . 
According to the opposition website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm , al-Libiyya station manager and deputy director of the [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] Abdelsalam al-Mishri was arrested on the same day and the host of the program in progress was interrogated by security services before being allowed to leave the broadcast studio . 
Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi , son of [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , chairs the [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] which includes al-Libiyya TV as well as two daily newspapers and a second satellite TV channel aimed at a young adult demographic . 
Al-Ghad newspapers covered al-Mishri 's arrest and announced that al-Libiyya would relocate overseas with the help of an unnamed investor . 
End summary . 
AL-LIBIYYA BROADCAST CUT MID-PROGRAM 2 . 
( C ) Management of the quasi-independent al-Libiyya satellite television channel changed abruptly on the evening of April 24 when the live broadcast of [PER Ain Qurb  ] ( " Up Close " ) interview show was interrupted mid-way through the show and the station 's signal was replaced by content from the state-run al-Jamahiriya channel . 
The show 's host , [LOC Hala  ] al-Misrati , was interviewing [ORG Revolutionary Committee  ] member [PER Mustafa Zaidi  ] in a " [MISC Hardball-type  ] " format when the feed was cut and state security officers entered the studio and started questioning her and others who were present . 
Station manager and deputy director of the [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] Abdelsalam [MISC Mishri  ] was reportedly detained on April 26 in conjunction with an investigation into the channel 's activities . 
Al-Mishri 's job was rumored to be in jeopardy for several months under suspicion of financial impropriety . 
Local press and observers , noting the timing and method of the station 's shutdown , speculate that matters of programming content are more likely to blame . 
According to media contacts , [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi visited the station headquarters earlier on the day of the shutdown . 
3 . 
( C ) Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi , son of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi , launched al-Libiyya two years ago as part of his [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] venture . 
While the group 's assets feature more diverse programming and news coverage than the circumspect state-run outlets , they are rarely openly critical of the regime and adhere to the " red lines " delineated by Saif al-Islam . 
Al-Ghad retains one other satellite channel , al-Shabibiyya , and two daily newspapers , [PER Oea  ] ( oealibya.com ) , and [PER Quryna  ] ( quryna.com ) . 
[PER Oea  ] ran an interview with [PER Ain Qurb  ] host [PER Hala  ] al-Misrati on April 29 describing her interrupted interview with state officials . 
Al-Misrati downplayed the interruption of her program , saying the individuals who questioned her were not security officers and characterizing their questions as benign . 
She blamed differences of opinion between her guest , [ORG RevComm  ] member [PER Zaidi  ] , and other [ORG RevComm  ] members for the crisis and criticized the strictures placed on journalists in [LOC Libya  ] by reactionary regime figures . 
4 . 
( C ) The Saif-owned daily paper [PER Quryna  ] featured a front-page article on April 28 attributing al-Mishri 's arrest and al-Libiyya 's potential move to [LOC London  ] to programming critical of [LOC Egypt  ] 's policies in [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] . 
( [PER Note: Al-Libiyya  ] 's closure came at the same time as [LOC Libya  ] 's Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] were leading a cabinet delegation to [LOC Cairo  ] to discuss bilateral trade and security issues . 
End note . 
) [PER Quryna  ] also ran a cartoon showing a character representing the satellite channel getting off an airplane in [LOC London  ] though remained mute on a partnership with a foreign investor announced by al-Ghad in a press release on April 25 . 
NEW MANAGEMENT AT AL-LIBIYYA AND AL-GHAD 5 . 
( C ) State press announced that al-Atti al-Mizughi took over as station manager of al-Libiyya and [PER Mohamed Kilani  ] as CEO in the wake of al-Misrati 's dismissal . 
Both officials are from state-owned al-Jamahiriya 's staff . 
In related news , opposition website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm reported that [PER Salah Abdelsalam Salah  ] was appointed director of [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] . 
[PER Salah  ] also heads Saif al-Islam 's [ORG Human Rights Committee  ] under the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] banner . 
He has facilitated visits to hospitalized regime critic [PER Fathi  ] al-Jahmi and personally escorted released critic [PER Idriss Boufayed  ] to his flight out of [LOC Libya  ] . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000359 002 OF 002 6 . 
( C ) Comment: The reasons for the government 's aggressive move against al-Libiyya are unclear . 
One theory is that program content provoked the ire of Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] ( by being too critical of his regime , and/or by angering [LOC Egypt  ] ) . 
Another theory is that the Leader wanted to further reduce the power-base of his popular son Saif al-Islam in the lead-up to the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought al-Qadhafi to power . 
After years as the heir apparent and champion of reform , Saif al-Islam has suffered a year of setbacks: government restructuring has been twice postponed ; [LOC Libya  ] 's first constitution in 40 years remains in secret , draft form ; his attempts to negotiate an end to the [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] contretemps failed ; and a March 2 government reshuffle seems to have increased the influence of some who have complained about his calls for reform . 
His brother and chief rival for leadership , [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , on the other hand , recently completed a highly-publicized visit to [LOC Washington  ] and appears to be taking on a larger role in [LOC Libya  ] 's security , intelligence , and foreign policy spheres .
