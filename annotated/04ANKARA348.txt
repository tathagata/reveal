[PER Erdogan  ] goes to washington: how strong a leader in the face of strong challenges ? ( U ) Classified by Ambassador [PER Eric Edelman  ] ; reasons: 1.5 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: P.M. [PER Erdogan  ] expects [LOC Washington  ] to focus on [LOC Cyprus  ] , economic reform , and anti-terrorism cooperation among other issues . 
In turn he will press for ( 1 ) concrete [LOC U.S.  ] actions to block what [LOC Turks  ] believe is the formation by accretion of a de facto [MISC Kurdish  ] state in n . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ; ( 2 ) concrete [LOC U.S.  ] actions against the [ORG PKK  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] ; and ( 3 ) clear USG support for his government . 
While the [MISC Turkish  ] side sees the visit as mainly about developing our broad common strategy , [PER Erdogan  ] is also looking for a public outcome he can characterize as concrete results . 
At the same time , although [PER Erdogan  ] is currently unchallenged as the paramount political figure in [LOC Turkey  ] , he and his party face deep challenges which , if he cannot rise to them , will affect his longevity in government , [LOC Turkey  ] 's democratic development , and [MISC U.S.-Turkish  ] cooperation . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) P.M. [PER Erdogan  ] appears to be riding a political high and uncommon luck as he prepares for his Jan. 28-29 visit to [LOC Washington  ] , where he hopes to demonstrate the Administration recognizes him as an equal partner. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] has been primed to hear plainspoken expressions of [LOC U.S.  ] interest in [MISC Turkish  ] action ( 1 ) to reach a [LOC Cyprus  ] settlement by May 1 ; ( 2 ) to hew to credible economic reform and macro policies ; ( 3 ) to cooperate unreservedly against terrorist groups of all stripes , including [MISC Islamist  ] ones ( he rejects the term “Islamic terrorism” ) ; ( 4 ) to cooperate on [LOC Iraq  ] ; ( 5 ) to open the border with [LOC Armenia  ] ; and ( 6 ) to reopen the [PER Ecumenical Patriarchate  ] 's [PER Halki  ] seminary in a way acceptable to the [LOC Patriarchate.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In turn [PER Erdogan  ] will argue that raising [MISC U.S.-Turkish  ] relations to a higher level depends directly on ( 1 ) clear USG political and diplomatic actions to dispel the conviction and consequent resentment among [LOC Turks  ] of all political stripes that the [LOC U.S.  ] is tolerating step-by-step formation of a de facto independent [MISC Kurdish  ] state in northern [LOC Iraq  ] ; ( 2 ) concrete USG actions to remove the [ORG PKK  ] threat from [LOC Iraq  ] ; ( 3 ) high-level , sustained USG support for the GOT 's new [LOC Cyprus  ] initiative ; and ( 4 ) the clearest possible signal that the [LOC U.S.  ] stands behind the democratically-elected government . 
Who are we dealing with ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Charismatic  ] , and possessing a common touch and phenomenal memory for faces and functions of thousands of party members across the country , [PER Erdogan  ] has a strong pragmatic core . 
His pragmatism has led him away from the radical [MISC Islamist  ] milieu of his past , a point noted to us unhappily by his ( radical ) former spiritual leader [PER Kemal Hoca  ] . 
His pragmatism has also led him to avoid precipitously pushing [MISC Islamic  ] agenda items such as the wearing of [MISC Islamist  ] headscarves while using his outstanding preacher skills and persona as someone persecuted by the secularist [ORG Establishment  ] to maintain his hold on the hearts of his more religious supporters. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In short , a natural politician , [PER Erdogan  ] has a common touch and an ability to communicate his empathy for the plight and aspirations of the common citizen . 
He projects the image of the [ORG Tribune of Anatolia  ] , ready to take on corruption and privilege and to defend conservative traditions . 
As a result his [ORG AK Party  ] won a two-thirds parliamentary majority in Nov. 2002 national elections . 
Owing to [ORG AK  ] 's image as the party of change at the national level , good record in providing services at the municipal level , and lack of viable political alternatives , [ORG AK  ] could gain around 50% of the vote in March 28 nationwide local elections . 
Party insiders project that such a result would give [ORG AK  ] control of 65% or more of the 3,200 municipalities in [LOC Turkey  ] , including probably [LOC Istanbul  ] and [LOC Ankara  ] and perhaps even [LOC Izmir  ] , where [ORG AK  ] has not done well to date , plus most of the other large cities . 
Every step by the [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG Establishment  ] to try to diminish him – whether by blocking legislation or attacking his motives – cements his popularity in [LOC Turkey  ] 's urban sprawls and across the [MISC Anatolian  ] heartland . 
While opposition to him remains bitter in various loci of the State apparatus , [PER Erdogan  ] currently faces no credible political opponent or party. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Moreover , [PER Erdogan  ] knows his government has gained credit well beyond [ORG AK  ] supporters , as well as in the [ORG EU  ] , for political reforms which , if fully implemented , will substantially strengthen democracy in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
His government 's inability to pass legislation or regulations favored by [ORG AK  ] supporters – land registry reform , [ORG Supreme Education Board  ] ( [ORG YOK  ] ) reform , [MISC Koran  ] course reform – has not eroded support . 
Indeed , even right-of-center [LOC Turks  ] who remain wary of [ORG AK  ] readily tell us the [ORG Establishment  ] 's opposition to such reforms is counterproductive . 
Even if one can attribute [LOC Turkey  ] 's lowest inflation and interest rates in 30 years to luck , [ORG Central Bank  ] skill , and global emerging market trends rather than to the [ORG AK  ] government 's actions , [PER Erdogan  ] has reaped the political benefit. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Taking a high-profile approach in pursuing [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] candidacy through direct campaigning in [ORG EU  ] capitals , [PER Erdogan  ] has relished being feted by [ORG EU  ] leaders for the past year . 
He will have had positive visits by [ORG EU Commission President Prodi  ] and [MISC German  ] [PER FonMin Fischer  ] before his [LOC Washington  ] trip and looks forward to the February visit by [MISC German  ] Chancellor [PER Schroeder  ] . 
He sees himself at this point as one of ( if not the ) most important leaders of the [MISC Muslim  ] world . 
[PER Erdogan  ] 's view of relations with the [LOC u.s.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] recognizes that [LOC U.S.  ] support can be important for [LOC Turkey  ] 's economy and [ORG EU  ] aspirations . 
He sees his task as managing [LOC Turks  ] 's ambivalence toward us ; at the same time he wants to avoid being labeled pro-American . 
From the low point in bilateral relations in March 2003 he has taken several supportive steps , while being careful not to be too closely associated with us since opening [MISC Turkish  ] airspace for the [LOC Iraq  ] war . 
[PER Erdogan  ] agreed to a ground line of communication for [ORG Coalition  ] forces in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He pushed through authorization for a [MISC Turkish  ] deployment in support of the [ORG Coalition  ] . 
He agreed to [LOC U.S.  ] troop rotation through [LOC Incirlik  ] airbase . 
In line with long-standing [LOC U.S.  ] desires , he took a bold step in Nov. 2002 to try to move [LOC Turkey  ] away from its no-solution stance on [LOC Cyprus  ] and may be prepared now to do more . 
He seems to be more open than any previous Prime Minister to a re-opening of the [PER Ecumenical Patriarchate  ] 's [MISC Halki  ] seminary. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On the other hand he has made public his discomfort with what most fellow [LOC Turks  ] also see as [MISC American  ] complicity in creation of a de facto independent [LOC Kurdistan  ] in northern [LOC Iraq  ] and lack of concrete [LOC U.S.  ] action against the [ORG PKK/KADEK/KHK  ] . 
He has not controlled anti-American suspicions among the [ORG AK  ] parliamentary group or within the Cabinet ( [PER DefMin Gonul  ] told us recently on the margins of a symposium in [LOC Istanbul  ] that in closed meetings [PER FonMin Gul  ] continues to praise the Parliament 's March 1 , 2003 turndown of [LOC U.S.  ] deployment and to advocate a more [MISC Arab/Islamic  ] foreign policy orientation as a counter to relations with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) . 
Nevertheless , [PER Erdogan  ] and Ministers like [PER Gonul  ] and Justice Minister Cicek see [LOC U.S.  ] support for his government as essential to his survival , and he wants a successful visit . 
The deeper challenges for erdogan <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] , [ORG AK  ] , and his government face half a dozen serious domestic challenges which , if he does not manage them well , will begin to put a severe strain on his ability to govern by late 2004 and on his and our ability to maintain dynamic , deep [MISC U.S.-Turkish  ] cooperation: –Erdogan 's character: [PER Erdogan  ] has traits which render him seriously vulnerable to miscalculating the political dynamic , especially in foreign affairs , and vulnerable to attacks by those who would disrupt his equilibrium . 
First , overbearing pride . 
Second , unbridled ambition stemming from the belief [PER God  ] has anointed him to lead [LOC Turkey  ] ( [PER Mustafa Bilginer  ] , a close confidant of [PER Erdogan  ] and his wife [PER Emine  ] from 1997-2003 , has analyzed this trait in a draft book on [PER Erdogan  ] 's character ; [PER Erdogan  ] used [MISC Koranic  ] allusion in his speech to the [ORG AK Congress  ] in Oct. 2003 to make the point about his [MISC God-appointed  ] mission ) . 
Third , an authoritarian loner streak which prevents growth of a circle of strong and skillful advisors , a broad flow of fresh information to him , or development of effective communications among the party headquarters , government , and parliamentary group . 
This streak also makes him exceptionally thin-skinned . 
Fourth , an overweening desire to stay in power which , despite his macho image , renders him fearful and prone to temporizing even at moments which call for swift and resolute decisions . 
Fifth , a distrust of women which manifests itself not only in occasional harsh public comments but also in his unwillingness to give women any meaningful decision-making authority in [LOC AK.  ] –Rival centers of power: Cabinet Ministers , [PER Erdogan  ] advisors and a raft of [MISC M.P.s  ] constantly tell us of the tensions between [PER Erdogan  ] and [PER Gul  ] , with the latter appearing repeatedly to try to undercut [PER Erdogan  ] . 
Parliamentary Speaker [PER Bulent Arinc  ] , who has a strong following among more [MISC Islamist  ] [ORG AK  ] [MISC M.P.s  ] , has also caused problems for [PER Erdogan  ] on controversial questions like pushing the right to wear headscarves at State functions . 
Although [PER Arinc  ] has kept a low profile for the past seven months , he remains a locus of troublemaking , especially on questions involving the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( e.g. , troop rotation through [LOC Incirlik  ] ) . –Lack of technocratic depth: While some [ORG AK  ] appointees appear to be capable of learning on the job , others are incompetent or seem to be pursuing private or lodge ( cemaat ) interests . 
[ORG AK  ] is far from bringing the bureaucracy under control or making it work efficiently . 
We hear constant anecdotal evidence , not only from those on the secularist left who have deep prejudices against [ORG AK  ] but also from contacts on the right , that [ORG AK  ] appointees , at the national and provincial levels , are incompetent or narrow-minded [MISC Islamists  ] . 
[ORG AK  ] officials – from Cabinet Ministers to local-level party activists across the country – admit to us that the party 's choice of competent and broadly acceptable candidates for the March local elections will be exceptionally difficult and the election of controversial or inept [ORG AK  ] candidates would complicate [ORG AK  ] 's ability to govern both at the local and national level. –Weakness of public relations and the image of hidden agendas: [PER Erdogan  ] lacks advisors who are able to pre-empt or handle the news cycle ; none of his advisors has good working relations with the [MISC Turkish  ] military . 
His government has failed continually to consult broadly and openly or to prepare public opinion for legislative initiatives , long-overdue reforms , or foreign policy steps ( e.g. , pre-war [LOC U.S.  ] troop deployment or troop rotation ) . 
As a result [ORG AK  ] creates the impression , exploited by the [LOC Establishment  ] , that it harbors an anti-republican , deep [MISC Islamist  ] agenda or is selling out the country , leading to [ORG Establishment  ] ( dis ) information campaigns which cause the government to retreat. –Corruption: [ORG AK  ] rode to power on the common citizen 's revulsion against corruption . 
Charges that [PER Erdogan  ] amassed his fortune through kickbacks as mayor of [LOC Istanbul  ] have never been proven but we now hear more and more from insiders that close advisors such as private secretary [PER Hikmet Bulduk  ] , [PER Mucahit Arslan  ] , and [PER Cuneyd Zapsu  ] are engaging in wholesale influence peddling. xxxxx that [PER Erdogan  ] and he benefited “directly” from the award of the [MISC Tupras  ] ( state petroleum refinery ) privatization to a consortium including a [MISC Russian  ] partner . 
[PER Erdogan  ] 's direct acquisition of a significant interest in a food distribution company has become a public controversy. –Islamist complexes and prejudices: Some appointments , such as Prime Ministry Undersecretary [PER Dincer  ] ( who stands by his 1995 article calling into question the relevance of the [MISC Republic  ] ) , [ORG Education Ministry  ] Undersecretary [PER Birinci  ] ( who in the past called himself an “ummetci” , i.e. , a follower of a greater [MISC Islamic  ] order and an opponent of the [MISC Republic  ] ) , and head of [MISC State-run Turkish Radio  ] and [ORG Television Demiroz  ] ( who once paid homage to [MISC Afghan  ] fundamentalist [ORG Hekmatyar  ] ) , have made the core of the State Establishment – Armed Forces , Presidency , and Judiciary – profoundly uneasy . 
[PER Erdogan  ] 's refusal to condemn these positions , the question of the level of influence of [MISC Islamic  ] brotherhoods and groups ( including the followers of [PER Fethullah Gulen  ] ) on the government , and the presence of [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG Hizbullah  ] supporters in [ORG AK Party  ] provincial structures in the [MISC Southeast  ] have also raised deep concerns among many long-standing Embassy contacts who themselves are pious . 
[PER Erdogan  ] himself recognizes the pernicious effect of a “closed brotherhood mentality” ( cemaatcilik ) in political affairs , as reflected in his Jan. 10 speech to a symposium in [LOC Istanbul  ] , but how well he can control the phenomenon remains a very open question . 
Comment <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As [PER Erdogan  ] rides the twin desires for reform in [LOC Turkey  ] and for wider prosperity , he challenges those who have traditionally reserved power and wealth for themselves at least to yield pride of place to a different elite . 
While his ultimate direction and success remain to be seen , at this time [PER Erdogan  ] is the only partner capable of advancing toward the [LOC U.S.  ] vision of a successful , democratic [LOC Turkey  ] integrated into [LOC Europe  ] .
