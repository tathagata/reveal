( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Charge  ] , accompanied by EconOff , met with [PER Gregorio Martinez  ] , Chief of Staff to Interior Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] , on May 9 . 
[ORG Charge  ] stressed the need for better inter-agency cooperation in [LOC Spain  ] in the fight against terrorism . 
Responding to the [ORG Charge  ] 's expressions of concern regarding the front-page April 28 [ORG El Pais  ] article ( reftel ) suggesting that [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] had financed terrorist cells from his jail cell , [PER Martinez  ] said he would provide information on what had happened . 
He claimed that designating [PER Yarkas  ] would not have made a practical difference and that , in any event , the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] had been responsible for the lack of action on designating [PER Yarkas  ] . 
End Summary COORDINATION KEY ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Charge  ] emphasized that [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] counterterrorism cooperation continued to be strong and good . 
[PER Martinez  ] agreed and noted that [LOC Spain  ] 's experience in fighting [ORG ETA  ] had given it plenty of " knowhow " in combating terrorists , including [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists . 
The [ORG Charge  ] agreed with this assessment , although he suggested that there remained room for improvement in [LOC Spain  ] with respect to better coordination between the [ORG Centro Nacional de Inteligencia  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] - [ORG National Intelligence Center  ] ) , the [ORG Guardia Civil  ] ( [ORG Civil Guard  ] ) and the [ORG Policia Nacional  ] ( [ORG National Police  ] ) . 
The [ORG Charge  ] recalled that in connection with the January 19 Barcelona arrests of 14 suspected [MISC Islamic  ] militants , the [ORG CNI  ] had tasked the [ORG Guardia Civil  ] with conducting the arrests . 
Unbeknownst to the [ORG Guardia Civil  ] , the [ORG Policia Nacional  ] was also investigating some of the same individuals . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities feared that there could have been a real problem with the arrest operation had they not discovered immediately prior to the arrests that both national law enforcement agencies were shadowing the [MISC Barcelona-based  ] group . 
[PER Martinez  ] attempted to downplay what had happened , but he certainly understood the [ORG Charge  ] 's concerns . 
He agreed that the upcoming May 20 event in the [ORG Charge  ] 's residence with representatives from [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement agencies was a good idea . 
( Note: Twice a year , we try to bring together [MISC American  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] counterterrorism officials from different agencies as part of an effort to improve bilateral coordination and avoid " stovepiping . 
" ) APRIL 28 [ORG EL PAIS  ] ARTICLE ON BARAKAT YARKAS POSSIBLY FINANCING TERRORIST CELLS FROM JAIL -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Charge  ] noted that the April 28 article had elicited concern and questions from the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Martinez  ] said that the article was probably a " fabrication . 
" However , he understood that the article which ran in the normally pro-government [ORG El Pais  ] that is considered by most observers to be [LOC Spain  ] 's " newspaper of record , " would logically prompt questions . 
[PER Martinez  ] committed to getting back to the [ORG Charge  ] with the facts . 
The [ORG Charge  ] stressed that [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] was a special [MISC American  ] concern for two reasons . 
First , he was connected to the September 11 plot . 
Second , the [ORG USG  ] has been pressing [LOC Spain  ] to designate [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] for several years . 
[PER Martinez  ] responded by saying that a designation would not have made a practical difference . 
EconOff countered by pointing out that a designation would have frozen Yarkas' assets so presumably he would not have been able to receive and cash ( if that is what happened ) two checks worth over euros 50,000 . 
[PER Martinez  ] did not respond directly but said that the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] did not oppose specific and ad hoc designations . 
In fact , [PER Martinez  ] said that the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] had recommended that the [MISC Spanish  ] government designate [PER Yarkas  ] and others by getting the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] to issue an executive order . 
However , the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] was opposed to this proposal and preferred a more " garantista " ( legally watertight ) approach that would create a new " mechanism " for designations . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] approach required legislative action . 
[PER Martinez  ] said that the inter-agency difference was the reason that no action had been taken to designate [PER Yarkas  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to fighting terrorism is strong . 
In fact , the [MISC Spaniards  ] are good at it . 
According to the 2007 [ORG EU Terrorism Situation  ] and [ORG Trend Report  ] , during the October 1 , 2005 to December 31 , 2006 period , 257 terrorists were tried and convicted on terrorism charges in the [ORG EU  ] . 
Out of the 257 convictions , 172 were in [LOC Spain  ] . 
However , competition between [LOC Spain  ] 's intelligence and law enforcment services remains endemic . 
Regarding the terrorism finance aspect to fighting terrorists , at this stage we are simply not sure what to make of the [ORG El Pais  ] article and will have to wait to hear back from [PER Martinez  ] . 
Should the the [ORG El Pais  ] article be accurate , that would of course strengthen our arguments for more expeditious designations . 
BIO NOTE -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gregorio Martinez  ] has been a good Embassy contact for several years and is also a former International Visitor to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Martinez  ] told the [ORG Charge  ] that he would remain in his position for the time being .
