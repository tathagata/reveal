( C ) On October 24 , the [ORG Central Bank  ] sent a letter to the [LOC New York  ] [ORG Federal Reserve Bank  ] requesting a one billion USD loan or currency swap . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] requested and today received a copy of the letter , which was addressed to [PER Timothy Geithner  ] , President of the [ORG Bank  ] . 
In a cover memo dated October 28 , the [ORG Central Bank  ] emphasized to the [ORG Embassy  ] the importance of a medium term loan or currency swap arrangements. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Although aware of existence of the letter , the [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] had not received a copy as of this morning and was uncertain as to its contents . 
[PER Benedikt Jonsson  ] , Acting Permanent Secretary , told the Ambassador that the [ORG MFA  ] was sensitive about making sure the correct [ORG USG  ] authorities received the [MISC Icelandic  ] request . 
[PER Jonsson  ] told the Ambassador to expect a request from the [LOC GOI  ] for a loan " through proper channels " , perhaps as early as this afternoon. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] is obviously struggling with problems of coordination and turf in dealing with the financial crisis . 
Away for the first couple of weeks of the turmoil ( due to brain surgery ) , the Foreign Minister is attempting to reassert her normal role in foreign affairs . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] , however , is guarding its perceived prerogatives closely--and , judging from the events of the last few weeks , unwisely . 
End Comment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Begin Text  ] of memo to Embassy: Please find attached the letter with Chairman [PER David Oddsson  ] sent to President [PER Geithner  ] of the [ORG Federal Reserve Bank  ] of [LOC New York  ] last Friday . 
Please take note that even though the letter emphasizes the importance of a medium term loan , a swap arrangement could serve the same purpose , not least if there is understanding that it would be rolled over for a period of time that would be commensurate with the financing of the economic program of the Government .

( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Begin Text  ] of letter to [ORG Federal Reserve:  ] October 24 Mr. [PER Timothy F. Geithner  ] , President [ORG Federal Reserve Bank  ] of [LOC New York  ] 33 [LOC Liberty Street New York  ] , [LOC NY  ] 10045 [LOC USA  ] Dear [LOC Tim  ] , Friday afternoon , October 24 , 2008 , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] announced that an agreement had been reached with the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] on a stand-by arrangement subject to [ORG IMF Executive Board  ] approval which could take place early in the week of November 3 , 2008 . 
The details of the program will remain confidential until late next week . 
For the program to succeed , financing beyond that provided by the [ORG IMF  ] will be necessary . 
I refer to the discussions which we had towards the end of September on our request for a currency swap arrangement between the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] and the [ORG US Federal Reserve  ] . 
I also refer to the discussions which we had earlier in the year on the same subject . 
As you explained to us , the main reasons for the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] not wishing to enter into a swap arrangement with the [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] were the relative size of the [MISC Icelandic  ] banking system and then in September discussions the absence of an [ORG IMF  ] arrangement . 
As you are no doubt well aware of , the [MISC Icelandic  ] banking system has now shrunk significantly . 
Additionally , as mentioned at the outset , the Government has announced an agreement with the [ORG IMF  ] on a standby arrangement . 
For it to succeed , financing beyond that provided by the [ORG IMF  ] will be necessary . 
I hereby request participation from the [ORG Federal Reserve Bank  ] in the financing of the economic program . 
Swap liens are short term in nature , but we need a financing commitment over a longer term horizon . 
Because of this , the [ORG Central Bank  ] ideally needs a loan from the [ORG Federal Reserve  ] of a medium term maturity , preferably in an amount of 1 billion USD . 
We are also seeking financing from other sources . 
I look forward to your prompt and favourable consideration of our request . 
As always , I stand ready to provide additional information as needed . 
Attached for your information is today 's press release issued by the Government . 
Yours sincerely [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000253 002 OF 002 [ORG Central Bank of Iceland  ] [PER David Oddsson  ] , Governor and Chairman of the [ORG Board of Governors End Text  ] .
