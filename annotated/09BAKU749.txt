( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's President [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] utilizes distinctly different approaches to foreign and domestic policies . 
He typically devises the former with pragmatism , restraint and a helpful bias toward integration with the [LOC West  ] , yet at home his policies have become increasingly authoritarian and hostile to diversity of political views . 
This divergence of approaches , combined with his father 's continuing omnipresence , has led some observers to compare the Aliyevs with the fictional " Corleones " of Godfather fame , with the current president described alternately as a mix of " [PER Michael  ] " and " [PER Sonny  ] . 
" Either way , this Michael/Sonny dichotomy complicates our approach to [LOC Baku  ] and has the unfortunate effect of framing what should be a strategically valuable relationship as a choice between [LOC U.S.  ] interests and [LOC U.S.  ] values . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) This striking aspect of President [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] 's governing style was very neatly summed up recently by the witty , but somewhat past-his-prime [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) . 
Commenting on the [ORG GOAJ  ] 's harsh reaction to the [ORG YouTube  ] " donkey video " ( Reftel A ) , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] quipped to the Charge that what one must understand about [PER Aliyev  ] , " He 's not [PER Michael Corleone  ] , he 's [PER Sonny  ] . 
" To some in [LOC Baku  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Godfather analogy seems apt - capturing essential truths not only about [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] , but his father [PER Heydar  ] , who becomes by implication the " [PER Vito Corleone  ] " of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
With that in mind , this cable attempts to explain who [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] is and why he does what h does . 
Aside from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] analogy , it also owe much to the appraisals of [PER Michael  ] and [PER Sonny  ] from " The Godfather Doctrine ( 2008 ) , " by [PER John Hulsman  ] and [PER A. Wess Mitchell  ] . 
" That 's my family , [PER Kay  ] . 
It 's not me . 
" --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] inherited a newly independent , resource-rich state , brought to order in the post-Soviet era by this father , [PER Heydar Aliyev  ] , scarred by a catastrophic war with [LOC Armenia  ] that resulted in occupation of the [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] enclave and seven surrounding [MISC Azerbaijani  ] regions . 
He assumed the presidency in 2003 , concurrent with his father 's death , in an election marked by a lack of competition and debate , at a time when [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's re-developed oil and gas resources were being brought on line for export . 
Dogged by widespread doubts about his suitability for leadership based on his age ( then 41 ) , lack of achievements and a " playboy " image , he oversaw the launch of a one million-barrels-per-day oil pipeline , which has flooded official and unofficial coffers in [LOC Baku  ] and serves as the financial backbone of the country. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The President and his cohorts , who largely were carried over from his father 's administration , now seek predictability , stability and continuity to preserve and protect public and private fortunes . 
[PER Ilham Aliyev  ] 's landslide 2008 re-election was followed by a hastily-called March 2009 referendum , which among other things removed term limits for the President . 
[PER Aliyev  ] 's cabinet has changed very little over the years , with few " reformers " brought in or remaining in power . 
The Prime Minister position is largely ceremonial and weak . 
Because of family connections , dynastic succession , the strong arming of the opposition and the creation of an elaborate patronage/protection network , the [ORG Aliyev Administration  ] has developed an " organized crime " image in some quarters , leading some analysts to see [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] at times in a mafia-like role . 
" Never hate your enemies . 
It affects your judgment .

( C ) In their short study " The Godfather Doctrine , " [PER Hulsman  ] and [PER Mitchell  ] present brothers [PER Sonny  ] and [PER Michael Corleone  ] from " The Godfather " as exemplars of two out of three schools of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy thought ( with consigliere [PER Tom Hagen  ] representing the third . 
) However , there are important points they raise about the two that apply well to [PER Aliyev  ] and his policies abroad and at home . 
[PER Michael  ] , they write , is a talented balancer of alliances , aware of limitations on his own power who , importantly , knows when something isn't personal , but only business . 
[PER Sonny  ] , by contrast , is brash , impulsive , and puts blind faith in force to address affronts to the [PER Corleone  ] family . 
For him , business is personal . 
Finally , [PER Sonny  ] refuses to contemplate a present or a future in which the [PER Corleone  ] family does not dominate [LOC New York  ] , despite obvious and growing portents to the contrary . 
" This is business , not personal " - Balanced Foreign Policy --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Aliyev  ] inherited from his father a clever , realistic foreign policy that he has largely maintained . 
With the overarching goal of maintaining and increasing [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's independence and sovereignty , he encourages involvement with [ORG NATO  ] and [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] security and political structures and supports a policy of westward transit of [MISC Azerbaijani  ] oil and gas through non-Russian channels . 
Otherwise , though , he alternates between assertiveness and appeasement where his powerful neighbors [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] are concerned . 
For example , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] routinely accuses [LOC Russia  ] of supplying [LOC Armenia  ] with weapons and pointedly absents itself from the [ORG Collective Security Treaty Organization  ] ( [ORG CSTO  ] ) , while participating in [LOC GUAM  ] . 
At the same time , [PER Aliyev  ] constantly plays up his relations with President [PER Medvedev  ] with frequent visits and has kept open the channels of negotiation on energy issues , concluding a small but symbolically important agreement with [ORG Gazprom  ] to supply gas to [LOC Dagestan  ] ( Reftel B ) . 
He is assertive enough to defend [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's prerogative for an independent policy , but discreet enough that he is in no danger of joining [PER Saakashvili  ] on [LOC Moscow  ] 's hit list. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In foreign policy , [PER Aliyev  ] has also been able to maintain generally the distinction between " business and personal . 
" For all his bluster about [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's legal right to liberate the Armenian-occupied territories by force , [PER Aliyev  ] has worked constructively on the [LOC Minsk  ] [MISC Group-proposed Basic Principles  ] and developed a reportedly good rapport with [MISC Armenian  ] President [PER Sargsian  ] - in contrast to the much more confrontational relationship between the countries' foreign ministers . 
Similarly , even as [PER Aliyev  ] regards with horror the prospect of [LOC Turkey-Armenia  ] rapprochement ahead of [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] resolution , the President has instructed [ORG SOCAR  ] to continue gas transit and supply talks with [LOC Turkey  ] , and no one in [LOC Baku  ] has dared to consider a cut in oil exports through the [ORG BTC  ] pipeline . 
The gas transit talks are a hardball affair to be sure , but [PER Aliyev  ] surely recognizes that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] cannot really afford a total rupture with [LOC Turkey  ] and certainly is not going to go so far as to foreclose on options out of pique while the [MISC Turkey-Armenia  ] question remains open . 
" You touch my sister again and I'll kill you . 
" - The Hardliner --------------------------------------------- ----------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) For all of the cool-headed calculation that generally influences [PER Aliyev  ] 's foreign policy , his domestic policies are another matter . 
As [PER Aliyev  ] perceives a challenge to his authority or affronts to his family dignity , even minor ones , he and his inner circle are apt to react ( or overreact ) , much to the detriment of the country 's democratic development and movement toward [MISC Western  ] alliances . 
The example of the crude retaliation against the young bloggers [PER Emin Milli  ] and [PER Adnan Hajizade  ] is the most recent and public example ( Reftel A ) . 
Earlier , defending his decision to rescind licenses for foreign broadcasters , [PER Aliyev  ] expressed his anger that Radio [ORG BAKU  ] 00000749 003 OF 004 Liberty had mocked his plan to build the world 's tallest flagpole in the [LOC Baku  ] port area , demonstrating exceedingly thin skin ( Reftel C ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S/NF ) It is examples like these that inspired [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] quip to the Charge about [PER Sonny  ] and [PER Michael  ] . 
[MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] elaborated on the point in that conversation , recalling times when he was an [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and similar situations arose . 
[PER Heydar  ] would never have allowed himself to be goaded into ridiculous reactions , he said . 
( Note: [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] memory on this might be a little selective , but he has a point that the space for opinion was wider under the last President , a view often echoed by journalists who look back to the 1990s nostalgically . 
End Note . 
) [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] , in [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] view , is not inclined to subtlety or deliberation in his response to these kinds of issues . 
" I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out . 
Just my enemies . 
" Q----------------------------------- -------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Aliyev  ] takes the actions he does in order to eliminate even the semblance of risk to his political prominence . 
His goal appears to be a political environment in which the [PER Aliyev  ] dynasty is unchallenged , which was demonstrated by the hastily organized March 2009 constitutional referendum removing presidential term limits . 
This strangled the hopes of any and all pretenders to succession , including his wife ( who in [MISC Azeri  ] politics is thought of as a rival [PER Pashayev  ] , not an [PER Aliyev  ] ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The dissonance between [PER Aliyev  ] 's sensible approach to foreign affairs , manifested by the cosmopolitan image he presents to [MISC Western  ] visitors , with his tailored suits and flawless [MISC English  ] , and the unpleasant reality of his approach to domestic issues raises the obvious question of how these two realities coexist . 
One explanation is that [PER Aliyev  ] is insecure in domestic politics and relies heavily on the advice of old-line [MISC Soviet-style  ] political figures carried forward from his father 's administration , such as Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Ramiz Mehdiyev  ] . 
Alternatively , [PER Aliyev  ] 's domestic actions are free choices made in accordance with his instincts , with [PER Mehdiyev  ] and others playing the " heavy . 
" . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Occasionally , [PER Aliyev  ] 's confident tough-guy image gives way to an impression that he is yielding on domestic issues . 
Outside pressure does not always fail . 
A recent positive example was the outcome of the parliament 's initiative to ram through a [MISC Russian-style  ] law on [ORG NGOs  ] . 
In the face of a domestic outcry - including from government-supported [ORG NGOs  ] , the [ORG Presidential Administration  ] intervened to prevent the law as drafted from passing ( Reftel D ) . 
Likewise , the President recently rejected a bill from parliament that would have required foreign-based entities to hire vetted [MISC Azerbaijanis  ] citizens as deputy directors . 
The business community strongly opposed this bill ( Reftel E ) . 
Also , the government earlier this year released one of the prominent journalists whose imprisonment was widely believed to have been politically motivated ( Reftel F ) . 
" Keep your friends close and your enemies closer . 
" --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: It is clear that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] 's future development would better suit [LOC United States  ] policy goals if [PER Aliyev  ] pursued his domestic policies in a manner that resembled his foreign policy methods , however imperfect they may be . 
A full-scale democratic conversion , however , is an unlikely outcome , and the record of presidents in this region leaving office voluntarily is rather thin . 
What is desirable and perhaps achievable , however , is that [PER Aliyev  ] would govern as a manager of alliances , viewing the political space occupied by dissents as a source of ideas and a warning system for when policies are hurting the national interest ; and ceasing to feel that he should strike hard at every criticism that arises , or that he can do so without consequences . 
At least this type of evolution would better prepare [LOC Azerbaijan  ] for the post-Ilham [PER Aliyev  ] era , whenever [LOC BAKU  ] 00000749 004 OF 004 that begins. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment Continued: Here is where the Godfather analogy begins to break down . 
In [LOC Azerbaijan  ] the role of loyal consigliere to the father and the son is played by the long-time head of [ORG Presidential Administration  ] [PER Ramiz Mehdiyev  ] . 
[PER Mehdiyev  ] is no calm , conciliating [PER Tom Hagen  ] . 
We do not know if President [PER Aliyev  ] personally ordered the many iron-fisted domestic initiatives , although he almost certainly approved them , even if after-the-fact . 
We do see [PER Mehdiyev  ] 's fingerprints all over the arrests of journalists , the stifling of opposition leaders , the closure of mosques , the restrictions on the media and the general law-and-order approach to governance . 
Is he the puppet or the puppet-master ? 
At age 71 and often seen in frail health , this is an increasingly important question . 
While the rule of 47-year old [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] could continue for decades , it would be most likely without the benefit of his consigliere . 
Without [PER Mehdiyev  ] , it is not clear whom [PER Aliyev  ] will turn to for help in maintaining the same firm grip on the instruments of power. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) " [PER Don Corleone  ] , I need a man with powerful friends . . . 
I need all of those policians you carry around in your pocket , like so many nickels and dimes .
