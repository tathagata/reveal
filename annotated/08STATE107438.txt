Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
See para . 
4. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Department views the “good offices” mission of the [ORG UN  ] Secretary [PER General’s Special  ] Representative ( SRSG ) to [LOC Burma  ] as an important vehicle for encouraging democratic progress in [LOC Burma  ] . 
Consequently , Department has viewed with growing concern the lack of progress on core political steps that the [ORG UNSC  ] called on [LOC Burma  ] to take such as the immediate release of political prisoners and the opening of a meaningful , time-bound political dialogue with democratic and ethnic minority leaders , in particular , with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] ( ASSK ) , over the course of SRSG [ORG Gambari’s  ] four missions to [LOC Rangoon  ] . 
Indeed , it appears that [ORG Gambari’s  ] access to regime officials and ability to secure results has only contracted over the course of these missions . 
His access to democratic leaders has been constrained by both the regime and more recently a loss of confidence in [PER Gambari  ] among leaders of the democracy movement. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Gambari  ] appears unrealistically upbeat , pursuing and reporting progress on peripheral matters ( e.g. , a possible economic forum , the possible placement of a [ORG UN  ] staff member in [LOC Rangoon  ] ) that are a distraction from what the [ORG Security Council  ] has articulated as critical goals and identified as [ORG Gambari’s  ] mandate. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Considering the key role of the good offices mission and [ORG Gambari’s  ] inability to secure significant progress from the [MISC Burmese  ] regime , USUN is asked to demarche SYG Ban or Ambassador Kim to seek [ORG Gambari’s  ] dismissal as SRSG for [LOC Burma  ] . 
This demarche should occur as soon as practical. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Taking into account [ORG Gambari’s  ] usefulness in his concurrent role as [ORG UN  ] advisor on the [MISC International Compact  ] with [LOC Iraq  ] , as well as SYG Ban’s likely sensitivities in regard to a possible dismissal , Department provides the following talking points ( not/not to be left as a non- paper ) for use by USUN in this demarche: <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/rel to [ORG UN  ] ) [PER Begin  ] points: -- Over time , the [LOC United States  ] has become increasingly concerned that the [ORG UN  ] good offices mission in regard to [LOC Burma  ] is in dire jeopardy . 
-- Special Representative [ORG Gambari’s  ] fourth and latest trip to [LOC Burma  ] continued a disturbing pattern of regime-managed itineraries ; restricted access to key regime officials and activists ; and complete lack of progress on the critical issues that form the core of Mr. [ORG Gambari’s  ] mandate: the opening of a meaningful and time-bound dialogue with democratic and ethnic minority leaders , including [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , toward democratization and national reconciliation , and the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners . 
-- While the main responsibility for this lack of progress should be attributed to regime intransigence , Mr. [PER Gambari  ] has not been willing to acknowledge it . 
This lack of progress , Mr. [ORG Gambari’s  ] inappropriate claims of success regarding peripheral issues , and his unwillingness to press the regime more forcefully for progress have caused us to conclude that his continued involvement undermines the good offices mission and should therefore be ended . 
-- We have no wish to embarrass Mr. [PER Gambari  ] and have no intent to link any removal with a lack of progress in [LOC Burma  ] , but we would ask that you find a way to terminate gracefully his participation in this particular mission . 
In particular , we cannot support further travel to [LOC Burma  ] for discussions with regime leadership by Mr. [PER Gambari  ] as part of the good offices mission . 
-- We urge you not to rush to name a replacement . 
There have been a series of Special Representatives , none of whom have succeeded due to regime intransigence . 
Absent some sign that the regime is willing to engage seriously , we fear appointment of a new envoy could actually encourage the regime and some of its friends to continue to emphasize process over substance . 
As you requested , however , we are willing to share ideas of possible candidates as you consider next steps . 
-- There is talk of your ramping up your personal involvement on [LOC Burma  ] , or perhaps even visiting . 
We think you could play an important role but understand you will have to consider carefully how you would engage . 
Although a trip by you could be useful , we believe it’s critical that the groundwork be laid so you can be confident that your visit will result in tangible progress . 
-- We understand that the [MISC Burmese  ] are unlikely to make major concessions as a condition for your visit . 
However , we do not believe you should go without a strong indication ahead of time that your visit would coincide with some tangible , positive steps . 
Steps that we recommend you insist upon are: the release of high-profile political prisoners ; the release of [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] or at least the easing of her house arrest ; insistence that you and any subsequent Special Representative will be able to determine your own schedules , including meeting with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , political prisoners , activists , and whomever else you wish ; and that you will have access to the senior most leadership of the [MISC Burmese  ] regime ; agreement on specific steps to begin a dialogue with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] and other democratic and ethnic leaders ; and a guarantee that any Special Representative will be granted a multiple entry visa . 
End points .
