Furnish  ] , [ORG POL  ] , ConGen Curacao , State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Local opposition parties are using rising fuel prices and fears of regional conflict to attempt , unsuccessfully , to stir up popular opposition to the [LOC U.S.  ] counter-drug Forward Operating Location ( [ORG FOL  ] ) . 
Local media reports have also highlighted recent [MISC Venezuelan  ] government criticism of the [ORG FOL  ] . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] air traffic controllers have threatened [LOC U.S.  ] and allied counter-drug flights in the area , challenging [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC French  ] , [MISC British  ] and [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] aircraft operating in international airspace . 
Missoffs have sought to provide friendly [ORG GONA  ] officials with information to counter the criticisms , but we probably can expect more negative attention in the run-up to renewal of the [ORG FOL  ] agreement , which expires in 2011 . 
END SUMMARY OPPOSITION SEIZES ON AIRSPACE VIOLATION TO CRITICIZE [ORG FOL  ] 2 . 
( U ) Leaders of [PER Curacao  ] 's opposition parties have used the recent , alleged [MISC Venezuelan  ] airspace violation by a USAF [MISC S-3  ] plane flying out of [PER Curacao  ] ( REF . 
A ) to attempt to stir up local fears over the presence of the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] counter-drug [ORG FOL  ] here . 
Party leaders [PER Nelson Pierre  ] of the Not One [MISC Step Backwards List  ] ( [ORG PLNP  ] ) and [PER Helmin Wiels  ] of [ORG Sovereign People  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) party have taken to local media to plant the idea that the [LOC U.S.  ] is attempting to use the [ORG FOL  ] as a staging area for military incursions into VE , and that [LOC Curacao  ] could eventually become caught in the middle should any military action occur . 
The opposition called for a public meeting on the issue in the [ORG Island Council  ] , now set for June 24 . 
BREAK AT THE PUMP FOR GIVING [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG FOL  ] THE BOOT ? 3 . 
( U ) This action follows recent criticism and strike action over the annoucement of significant retail fuel price increases on [LOC Curacao  ] . 
Opposition parties are telling the public that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] will not consider giving [LOC Curacao  ] a better deal on fuel as long as the [ORG FOL  ] ( which he reportedly considers a potential threat ) is allowed to operate . 
The [MISC Curacao-owned  ] , but [MISC Venezuelan  ] ( [ORG PdVSA  ] ) -operated , oil refinery supplies all fuel to local retailers . 
WHO IS FUNDING LOCAL OPPOSITION ? 4 . 
( C ) A pro-U.S . 
[ORG Curacao Island Council  ] member called on [ORG COM  ] recently to discuss possible [MISC Venezuelan  ] interference in this and related issues . 
Source informed us that he and other members of the government are concerned that the opposition parties and certain labor unions are suddenly better organized and funded , and that they plan to use the upcoming council meeting to put political pressure on the [ORG GONA  ] , including regarding the [ORG FOL  ] . 
He reported that a recent strike and public demonstration by the taxibus drivers' union over fuel prices was far more organized and coordinated than prior events . 
He noted especially the involvement in the strike of former [ORG GONA  ] cabinet member and avowed [ORG Chavista Errol Cova  ] of the now-defunct [ORG Labor People 's Crusade  ] party . 
MISSOFFS REACH OUT 5 . 
( C ) Opposition leaders will reportedly raise the [MISC Venezuelan  ] airspace incident and try to link it with the fuel price issue at the [ORG Island Council  ] meeting to suggest that the [ORG GONA  ] get rid of the [ORG FOL  ] . 
In an effort to help pro-U.S. officials counter the criticism , [ORG COM  ] and the [MISC JIATF-South  ] liaison officer briefed [MISC Island  ] Governor and Council head [PER Lisa Dindial  ] , and later [ORG PM  ] Elhage on May 25 regarding the airspace incident ( using approved press guidance ) . 
Missoffs provided background information on the limited , counter-drug mission of the [ORG FOL  ] and on its many benefits to [LOC Curacao  ] . 
During the meeting with the [ORG PM  ] , Missoffs were surprised to encounter visiting [MISC Dutch  ] State Secretary for [MISC Kingdom Affairs  ] [PER Ank Bijleveld  ] and [LOC Netherlands  ] local representative [PER Rob Vermaas  ] . 
The [ORG PM  ] invited them to sit in on the meeting , where they also expressed concern about possible [MISC Venezuelan  ] interference . 
The Lt. Governor and [ORG PM  ] planned to pass the [ORG FOL  ] information to friendly island commissioners so that they can better respond to the accusations and allegations that the opposition is likely to make at the June 24 public meeting . 
[MISC VENEZUELAN  ] DRUMBEAT OF CRITICISM <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) For its part , [LOC Venezuela  ] is apparently ramping up its public criticism of the [ORG FOL  ] and taking an increasingly aggressive posture against counter-drug flights from [LOC Curacao  ] . 
In President [PER Chavez  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Cuba  ] , he reportedly referred , as he has previously , to the threatening U.S.military bases in [LOC Curacao  ] and [LOC Manta  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] ( REF . 
B ) . 
Local media also report that former [MISC Venezuelan  ] Vice President [PER Vicente Rangel  ] again cited the [MISC Curacao  ] [ORG FOL  ] as a potential threat during his weekly TV program . 
Other current and former [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials have also been quoted locally as calling the [ORG FOL  ] a threat to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
CHALLENGES TO [MISC BRITISH  ] , [MISC FRENCH  ] , [MISC ANTILLEAN  ] COUNTER-DRUG FLIGHTS <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Perhaps partly as a result of the airspace violation and high-level political attention , [MISC Venezuelan  ] air traffic control authorities seem to be taking a more aggressive stance toward [LOC U.S.  ] and allied counter-narcotics flights in the region . 
On three occasions over four days , June 14-17 , we understand that [MISC Venezuelan  ] air traffic control ( [ORG ATC  ] ) at [LOC Maiquetia  ] airport has challenged the presence of counter-narcotics aircraft operating within its [ORG Flight Information Region  ] ( [ORG FIR  ] ) but within international airspace . 
On these three occasions , [MISC British  ] , [MISC French  ] and [MISC Antillean  ] counter-drug reconnaisance planes were told they needed [MISC Venezuelan  ] clearance to transit the [ORG FIR  ] . 
The aircraft commanders have responded that no such clearance is necessary as they are state aircraft operating in international airspace with due regard to other traffic . 
In the first incident , the [MISC British  ] pilot was told that if he entered the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG FIR  ] again , he will be intercepted by military aircraft . 
A Dash-8 operated by the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] Coast Guard was challenged the following day and voluntarily turned around . 
Finally , the [MISC French  ] aircraft , which remained in international airspace , was reportedly shadowed for 15-20 mintues by what were apparently two unidentified [MISC Venezuelan  ] military planes 150 miles away and flying over [LOC Venezuela  ] on a paralell course . 
WORKING-LEVEL RESPONSE SUGGESTED <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] [MISC Foreign Affairs Directorate  ] ( [ORG FAD  ] ) called ConGen June 15 to ask about unofficial complaints from the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG ATC  ] regarding the first of these incidents . 
[ORG COM  ] corrected the claim that [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft were involved , and encouraged the [ORG FAD  ] to deal with the matter first at the technical , working level . 
[ORG COM  ] updated the [ORG FAD  ] Director and Deputy PM on the margins of the June 16 [ORG FOL  ] change of command ceremony here . 
The [ORG FAD  ] director , who had just returned from talks with [LOC Venezuela  ] on the future of the [LOC Curacao  ] refinery ( run by [ORG PDVSA  ] ) , agreed . 
He noted that similar incidents two years ago were handled on a mil-mil basis at a low level . 
He also predicted that the [ORG GOV  ] would not succeed should it attempt to link the [ORG FOL  ] to the refinery negotiations . 
[ORG COM  ] also expects to discuss the issue during a visit to [LOC JIATFSouth HQ  ] next week where he will be joined by the Governors of the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] , and the [MISC Curacao-based Dutch  ] Commander of [ORG CTG  ] 4.4 . 
9 . 
( C ) Comment: The opposition parties , while small , have a dedicated following , mainly among working-class citizens who are already wary of [MISC Dutch  ] influence and control . 
Opposition leader [PER Nelson Pierre  ] ( a reputed former drug addict ) of the [ORG PLNP  ] is known to deliver lengthy , screaming rants on local radio shows , accusing [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] interests of wide-ranging conspiracies against [LOC Curacao  ] and the region . 
Post suspects that some oppositon leaders have links with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government and may receive funding from it . 
We expect more opposition attacks on our military presence in the runup to renewal of the [ORG FOL  ] agreement , which expires in 2011 . 
We will continue efforts to promote the [ORG FOL  ] as a multinational effort to work with the [MISC Antilles  ] ( and [LOC Aruba  ] ) to combat drug trafficking , and to show the Opposition parties that there is a political cost to not supporting that fight in defense of their own people . 
We will also continue to highlight the [ORG FOL  ] 's counterdrug mission and success , along with its positive economic and social impact in the community , in order to influence already generally favorable public opinion .
