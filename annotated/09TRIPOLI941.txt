Polaschik  ] , Charge d’Affaires , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
This is an action request ; see para 13. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Summary: Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi told the Ambassador November 27 that [LOC Libya  ] had halted the shipment of its final [ORG HEU  ] stockpiles because it was “fed up” with the slow pace of bilateral engagement . 
[PER Saif  ] claimed that [LOC Libya  ] had not received the “compensation” it was promised in exchange for an end to its WMD programs , including cooperation in the military , security , nonproliferation , civilian-nuclear , and economic spheres . 
[LOC Libya  ] sought a high-level reaffirmation of the [MISC United States’  ] commitment to the bilateral relationship , in the form of a message to [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , in order to move forward on the [ORG HEU  ] shipment . 
[PER Saif  ] al-Islam , who claimed that he was “back” on the [LOC U.S.  ] portfolio , said his father did not want to move back to “square one” and wanted to develop a positive relationship with the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] . 
The Ambassador underscored the gravity of the situation and noted that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government had chosen a very dangerous venue to express its pique . 
He also noted that many of the holdups in the bilateral relationship had been due to [MISC Libyan  ] political missteps and bureaucratic bungling . 
The Ambassador told [PER Saif  ] he would try to get some kind of statement along the lines requested , but the [ORG HEU  ] shipment should in no way be held hostage to any specific actions beyond that . 
[PER Saif  ] assured the Ambassador that once that message was conveyed to [LOC Tripoli  ] , he would immediately “fix” the problem . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Once again exhibiting their flair for the dramatic , and after almost one week of stonewalling regarding the decision to not allow the departure of the [ORG HEU  ] shipment to [LOC Russia  ] , the [MISC Libyan  ] leadership authorized a meeting between [PER Saif  ] al-Islam ( accompanied by an assistant ) and the Ambassador ( accompanied by Pol-Econ Counselor ) as the Ambassador was departing for the airport to travel to [LOC Washington  ] . 
During the November 27 meeting , the Ambassador expressed his deep concern about [ORG Libya’s  ] decision to halt shipment of its remaining Highly Enriched Uranium ( [ORG HEU  ] ) stockpile to [LOC Russia  ] for treatment and disposal . 
The Ambassador said that [ORG Libya’s  ] WMD commitments were the cornerstone of the relationship , and the last-minute , unexplained disapproval of the shipment seemed to renege on those commitments . 
He emphasized that the [MISC Libyans  ] must move forward with the shipment as soon as possible , for security reasons and to preserve the bilateral relationship . 
The Ambassador pressed [PER Saif  ] to explain why the shipment was held up and insisted that the [MISC Libyans  ] must improve communication in times of crisis , stating that [MISC Libyan  ] officials cannot simply ignore calls from high-level [ORG USG  ] officials and refuse to explain their decisions that negatively affect bilateral interests . 
This was no way to conduct a relationship . 
The decision to halt the shipment and create this crisis was intensified by the timing and the international context , given the [MISC President’s  ] focus on non-proliferation and the problems engendered by [LOC Iran  ] . 
By its actions , [LOC Libya  ] was jeopardizing its relationship with the whole international community. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] al-Islam explicitly linked [ORG Libya’s  ] decision to halt the [ORG HEU  ] shipment to its dissatisfaction with the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship . 
[PER Saif  ] said the shipment was halted because the regime was “fed up” with the pace of the relationship and what it perceived as a backing-out of commitments to bilateral cooperation . 
The areas of specific concern were [ORG Libya’s  ] purchase of military equipment ( non-lethal and lethal weapons ) , an update on what was being done with [ORG Libya’s  ] centrifuges , movement on the [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] , and financial assistance for the chemical weapons destruction program , including construction of the destruction facility . 
[PER Saif  ] pledged to solve the [ORG HEU  ] crisis and to allow the shipment to move forward as early as next week if the [ORG USG  ] expressed a renewed commitment to the relationship and to deeper engagement . 
[PER Saif  ] noted that the message needed to be conveyed to ( or addressed to ) [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] continued that prevailing domestic opinion and conservative forces were critical of [ORG Libya’s  ] decision to dismantle its nuclear weapons program . 
Noting that he personally had played an important role in [ORG Libya’s  ] re-engagement with the [LOC West  ] , [PER Saif  ] asserted that “If something goes wrong , people will blame me , whether I am in a certain official position or not.” [PER Saif  ] stated that [ORG Libya’s  ] decision to give up its WMD programs was contingent upon “compensation” from the [LOC U.S.  ] , including the purchase of conventional weapons and non-conventional military equipment ; security cooperation ; military cooperation ; civil-nuclear cooperation and assistance , to include the building of a [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Facility  ] ; and the end of “double taxation” and economic cooperation , such as the signing of a [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIFA  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] noted that [LOC Libya  ] was a small , rich country , surrounded by large , powerful , poorer neighbors . 
Yet [LOC Libya  ] , the only [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG MTCR  ] ) signatory in the region , had given up all of its conventional weapons and could not purchase replacement systems or military equipment from the [LOC United States  ] . 
He highlighted [LOC Egypt  ] , a non-MTCR signatory , as an example of a neighboring country that receives millions of dollars in [LOC U.S.  ] aid and military assistance but did not have to share [ORG Libya’s  ] nonproliferation commitments . 
Relative to such neighbors , [ORG Libya’s  ] decision to dismantle its nuclear programs had weakened its ability to defend itself . 
He stated , “We share rich natural resources -- oil and gas -- along the borders , yet we have no capacity to defend that wealth.” [PER Saif  ] complained that [LOC Libya  ] could not purchase conventional weapons from the [LOC United States  ] or even from [LOC Sweden  ] or [LOC Germany  ] due to [LOC U.S.  ] holds on the sale of those weapons to [LOC Libya  ] -- “even until now , seven years later , there is an embargo on [ORG Libya’s  ] purchase of lethal equipment.” He specifically mentioned a problem purchasing “Tiger” vehicles outfitted with [MISC American-manufactured  ] engines from [LOC Jordan  ] , due to a [LOC U.S.  ] legal restriction on [ORG Libya’s  ] purchase of [MISC American-equipment.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Inquiring about the status of the centrifuges [LOC Libya  ] gave up as part of its WMD commitments , [PER Saif  ] argued that the [LOC U.S.  ] had used the “deal” as a public relations coup for the previous administration . 
He said that the fact that the centrifuges were sent to the [LOC United States  ] and are still there , rather than under [ORG IAEA  ] surveillance and control was a “big insult to the [MISC Leader.”  ] The fact that [LOC Libya  ] was never “compensated” for the centrifuges added to the insult . 
In addition to the centrifuge problem , he complained that [LOC Libya  ] had to pay for the destruction of its chemical weapons . 
[PER Saif  ] insisted that [LOC Libya  ] was not able to pay to destroy its chemical weapons stock , noting that the construction of the destruction facility alone was estimated to cost [LOC US  ] $25 million . 
For these and other reasons relating to “non-compensation” for WMD decisions , he stated that certain voices in [LOC Libya  ] were pressuring the Leader to withdraw from the [ORG MTCR  ] agreement . 
He lamented that “slowly , slowly , we are moving backward rather than forward.” He told the Ambassador that in order for the relationship to progress , the [LOC U.S.  ] needed to make a move. “The ball is in your court , ” [PER Saif  ] urged. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Continuing his lament , [PER Saif  ] said the [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] relationship was “not going well.” Since his last visit to the [LOC United States  ] in 2008 , [PER Saif  ] said that both sides had deviated from the roadmap that had been agreed upon at that time , which specified cooperation in the military , security , nonproliferation , civilian-nuclear , and economic spheres . 
He asserted that the roadmap had gotten “lost” due to his own “disappearance” from the political scene and “preoccupation with other issues overseas.” He acknowledged that he was disconnected for a long time but that he was back on the political scene -- although he was careful to caveat that he had not yet accepted an official role in the regime. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] raised a few recent incidents that he argued illustrated how things were going wrong . 
First , he pointed to [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi’s recent trip to [LOC New York  ] , which in [MISC Saif’s  ] opinion had not gone well , because of the “tent and residence issues and his [ pere Qadhafi’s ] inability to visit ground zero.” He said that all three issues had been complicated by local [LOC U.S.  ] authorities and had humiliated the [MISC Libyan  ] leader -- “even tourists can see ground zero without permission , but a Head of State cannot ? ” Secondly , [PER Saif  ] believed that his father’s [MISC UNGA  ] speech had been misinterpreted by [LOC U.S.  ] audiences ; he specifically focused on statements involving moving the [ORG UN Headquarters  ] outside of the [LOC United States  ] and various assassination investigations ( [LOC JFK  ] , [PER Rafik al-Hariri  ] , etc . 
) . 
[PER Saif  ] stated that the elder [PER Qadhafi  ] meant no offense by his statements , but was merely trying to “pave the way” for any future decisions that [ORG POTUS  ] might make related to those issues . 
Lastly , [PER Saif  ] noted that the [MISC Libyan  ] leader was worried about [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The elder [PER Qadhafi  ] was also against the linguistic and political division of [LOC Africa  ] into “North” and “Sub-Saharan” [LOC Africa  ] and wanted countries such as the [LOC United States  ] to treat [LOC Africa  ] as a single entity rather than two blocs. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] said that [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] was serious about deepening engagement with the [LOC United States  ] and establishing a relationship with the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
[PER Saif  ] said that his father did not want to “go back to square one , ” but wanted to move the bilateral relationship forward . 
[PER Saif  ] emphasized the [MISC Libyan  ] leader’s interest in meeting [ORG POTUS  ] in a third country if a meeting in the [LOC United States  ] was not possible . 
Such a meeting would help overcome the negative history that our nations shared , would support the rebuilding of trust , and might even help with [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy operations and activities in [LOC Libya  ] , according to [LOC Saif.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador noted that the relationship had seen several advancements and several serious setbacks since [MISC Saif’s  ] last visit to the [LOC United States  ] , including the August 20 hero’s welcome accorded to [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi by [PER Saif  ] himself . 
Megrahi’s return had severely offended [MISC American  ] sensitivities and renewed tensions that set the relationship back . 
Until that point , there had been significant progress , with a military-to-military agreement signed in January and the positive April visit of [ORG National Security Advisor Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi and his meeting with the Secretary . 
Although the death of [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi had been a setback to the relationship , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] had found a productive way forward through the establishment of a bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] . 
Regarding concerns about [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in [LOC Africa  ] , the Ambassador reminded [PER Saif  ] that Colonel [PER Qadhafi  ] and General [PER Ward  ] had had what we believed to be a very productive meeting several months ago , which we had hoped would have dispelled any concerns the [MISC Libyans  ] had about [LOC U.S.  ] intentions in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The Ambassador explained that [MISC Americans  ] were hoping for a more forward-leaning statement by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi in [LOC New York  ] but instead heard a series of remarks that were not agreeable to the [MISC American  ] public . 
As a result , the relationship has been placed on a “low-burner” since August. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In spite of these issues , the Ambassador said the [LOC U.S.  ] had managed to keep moving ahead in the areas of security , military , political , civilian-nuclear , and economic cooperation . 
However , many of the delays in implementation were due to [ORG Libya’s  ] opaque bureaucracy . 
The [MISC Section 505  ] end user agreement , for example , had languished in the [LOC GOL  ] for months , as had [ORG Libya’s  ] response on [ORG TIFA  ] . 
[ORG Libya’s  ] slow-rolling on visa approvals for official [MISC American  ] travelers had delayed movement in areas such as civilian-nuclear cooperation and on the [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Facility.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] acknowledged that he was disconnected for a long time from the bilateral relationship and recognized that the hero’s welcome for [PER Megrahi  ] had set engagement back . 
He reiterated that he was “back” on the scene and could serve as the “trouble-shooter” for any future problems . 
He urged the Ambassador to contact his office directly in times of crisis . 
He also promised to resolve the visa issue , stating that he understood the importance of a transparent and reliable system of issuance . 
In their one-on-one discussion afterwards , the Ambassador asked [PER Saif  ] to explain his actions when he accompanied [PER Megrahi  ] back to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[PER Saif  ] said he knew what the reaction in the [LOC West  ] would be , but that it did not constitute an “official” welcome . 
He had worked on the release for a long time , he was not a public official , and there were no international media like [PER Al Jazeera  ] present . 
In addition , [PER Saif  ] claimed that the [MISC Libyans  ] would someday find a way to show that [PER Megrahi  ] was innocent . 
The Ambassador reiterated the damage the welcome had done and said no amount of justification could undo that . 
[PER Saif  ] nodded his understanding . 
[PER Saif  ] also replied that if he is confirmed in his new position , he was as yet not sure whether he would retain his current position as head of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] . 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Libyan  ] Government has chosen a very dangerous issue on which to express its apparent pique about perceived problems in the bilateral relationship , a point the Ambassador underscored with [PER Saif  ] al-Islam . 
If [PER Saif  ] is to be believed , it appears we might have a way forward . 
If the Department is willing , we would urge a phone call from the Secretary to [PER Musa Kusa  ] with a message for Colonel [PER Qadhafi  ] comprising a general statement of commitment to the relationship , a commitment to work with the [MISC Libyans  ] to move the relationship ahead , and a strong point insisting that the [ORG HEU  ] shipment be allowed to go forward immediately and not be held hostage to any further actions . 
BIO NOTE <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Saif  ] met the [LOC Ambassdor  ] in an office on the [MISC Bab Al-Aziziya  ] compound . 
The office was filled with books , including a high stack of art and interior design books and several brochures distributed by the [ORG Embassy’s Public Affairs Section  ] . 
[PER Saif  ] conducted the meeting in [MISC English  ] . 
He was accompanied by his personal assistant , [PER Mohamed Ismail Ahmed  ] ( [LOC DOB  ] 07/06/1968 ) , who said that he was born in [LOC Alexandria  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and spent his childhood years traveling abroad with his diplomat father , including in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the late 1970s , where he attended the [MISC American  ] School . 
[PER Ahmed  ] was soft-spoken and spoke fluent [MISC English  ] . 
He asked Pol/Econ chief to provide him with additional information on the status of [ORG Libya’s  ] military procurement requests and Letters of Offer and Assistance ( LOA’s ) .
