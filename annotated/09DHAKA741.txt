Moriarty  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
( U ) This is an action request , please see para 8 below . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Ambassador recently urged the Prime Minister , s Energy Adviser , [PER Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury  ] , to resolve several pressing issues , including awarding offshore blocks for natural gas exploration and authorizing coal mining . 
The Adviser indicated that [ORG Conoco Phillips  ] would likely be awarded two of the uncontested blocks and that [ORG Chevron  ] would likely soon receive permission to go ahead with the first of three compressors necessary to improve flow in [LOC Bangladesh  ] , s main gas pipeline . 
With respect to coal , [PER Chowdhury  ] requested technical assistance for evaluating the technical and environmental problems associated with different types of mining . 
The Ambassador and the [ORG Energy Advisor  ] agreed that regional cooperation among the [MISC South Asian  ] countries would benefit all concerned . 
Blocking it off for gas exploration ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [PER Adviser  ] told the Ambassador during a meeting on July 23 that [ORG Conoco Phillips  ] would likely be awarded the two uncontested offshore blocks for natural gas exploration . 
( Note: Later that day , the [ORG Cabinet  ] referred the matter to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] for further scrutiny . 
At issue is the ongoing dispute between [LOC Bangladesh  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Burma  ] over the demarcation of territorial waters in the [LOC Bay of Bengal  ] . 
[ORG Conoco Phillips  ] , s initial bid for exploration in eight blocks was approved , but the award has been stalled for almost a year . 
The company wants to eventually receive all the offshore blocks for which it was the winning bidder but is willing to start out in the blocks where there was no territorial dispute . 
End note . 
) Increasing the flow ------------------- 3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador noted that one way for the [ORG GOB  ] to begin to address [LOC Bangladesh  ] , s energy shortage would be to add compressors to the country , s main gas pipeline ; compressors would greatly increase the flow of gas from [ORG Chevron  ] , s [ORG Bibiyana  ] gas field . 
[PER Chowdhury  ] replied that the [ORG GOB  ] was on the verge of giving [ORG Chevron  ] permission to go ahead with one of the three compressors necessary . 
( Note: Tenders are being invited for the other two compressors , though [ORG Chevron  ] states that it is not interested in bidding on the remaining two compresssors . 
End note . 
) [ORG Chevron  ] would fund the purchase itself and then be reimbursed by [PER Petrobangla  ] ( the owner of the pipeline ) out of profits from the increased flow of gas . 
[PER Chowdhury  ] warned , however , that it would take time for the [ORG GOB  ] to obtain the other two compressors . 
Prices had risen rapidly , and the [ORG GOB  ] would have to obtain additional assistance from the [ORG Asian Development Bank  ] . 
Moreover , compressors of this magnitude were built to order and would take some time to manufacture after the financing was arranged . 
Coal as a potential solution ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Ambassador noted that [LOC Bangladesh  ] , s coal reserves were vast and of the highest quality ; coal appeared to provide a potential way to at least partly resolve the country , s energy crisis . 
[PER Chowdhury  ] replied that because of global concerns about green house gas emissions and air pollution , multilateral financial institutions had become reluctant to finance coal mining projects . 
He pointed out however , that the international community should focus on clean coal technology . 
He asked for technical assistance from the [LOC U.S.  ] to determine what type of mining would work best in [LOC Bangladesh  ] and how the environmental impact could be mitigated ; he added that the [ORG GOB  ] would also stress the need [LOC DHAKA  ] 00000741 002 OF 002 to rehabilitate the mined areas . 
The Ambassador promised that the [ORG USG  ] would look for ways to help the [ORG GOB  ] and added that open pit mining seemed the best way forward , if the rehabilitation of lands could be done properly. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [PER Adviser  ] remarked that the proposed coal mine in [LOC Phulbari  ] was politically sensitive , in light of the impoverished , historically oppressed tribal community residing on the land . 
( Comment: Just as important , the [ORG Awami League  ] vigorously opposed the project when it was in opposition . 
End comment . 
) He said the government would seek to ensure the rights of the local community and build support for the project through the parliamentary process . 
( Note: [ORG Asia Energy  ] , the company behind the [LOC Phulbari  ] project , has sixty percent [LOC U.S.  ] investment . 
[ORG Asia Energy  ] officials told the Ambassador on July 29 they were cautiously optimistic that the project would win government approval in the coming months . 
End note . 
) Regional cooperation afoot ? --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Ambassador and the Adviser also discussed USAID , s [MISC South Asian  ] Regional Initiative for Energy ( SARI/E ) ( which promotes energy security in the region through cross border energy trade , energy markets and access to clean energy ) . 
The Ambassador welcomed continued cooperation such as the visit of a high level [ORG GOB  ] delegation to [LOC India  ] in mid July . 
He noted that the [ORG USG  ] had always believed that the countries of [LOC South Asia  ] should address their energy problems together and that opponents of transit and regional cooperation in [LOC Bangladesh  ] had no strong arguments . 
Integration onto a regional energy grid would be more politically palatable than simply trying to resolve differences bilaterally , he pointed out . 
The [PER Adviser  ] concurred: The opposition [ORG Bangladesh Nationalist Party  ] ( [ORG BNP  ] ) asserted that the [ORG Awami League  ] was selling out the country , s sovereignty whenever the government undertook any projects bilaterally with [LOC India  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Despite its enormous potential , [LOC Bangladesh  ] still faces daunting challenges as it attempts to resolve its energy crisis . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has focused on the energy sector as a core component of Prime Minister [PER Sheikh Hasina  ] , s agenda . 
The appointment of [PER Chowdhury  ] , a seasoned bureaucrat with the ear of the Prime Minister , underscores the emphasis the [ORG GOB  ] has placed on the energy issue . 
In the absence of a Minister for Energy , [PER Chowdhury  ] is the lead official on energy matters . 
Harnessing [LOC Bangladesh  ] , s natural gas reserves and vast quantities of coal in the [LOC Phulbari  ] region , could improve the lives of 150 million [MISC Bangladeshis  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] energy sector cooperation also offers the prospect of commercial benefit . 
Action Request -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Embassy [LOC Dhaka  ] requests [LOC Washington  ] agencies , help in responding to the [ORG GOB  ] , s request for technical assistance in determining what type of coal mining would be appropriate and also in mitigating the environmental impact of open pit and other forms of mining . 
On that score , [PER Chowdhury  ] indicated that [LOC U.S.  ] companies had provided invaluable advice in the past ; he was looking to see whether the [ORG USG  ] could provide names of companies/individual consultants who could provide objective , reliable advice in an area where the [ORG GOB  ] lacked expertise .
