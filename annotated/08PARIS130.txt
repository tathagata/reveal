( U ) In this annual [MISC New Year  ] 's message to the [ORG Diplomatic Corps  ] on delivered on January 18 , President [PER Sarkozy  ] laid out a theoretical justification for recasting [LOC France  ] 's role on the international scene in the twin challenges before the international community: climate change and the " return of the religious extremism " as a factor in international politics . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] called for " four innovations " to prevail over these challenges: 1 ) returning [LOC France  ] to the " heart of the occidental family , " 2 ) dedicating [LOC France  ] to a " diplomacy of reconciliation , " 3 ) affirming " diversity " while demanding " its corollary , reciprocity , " and 4 ) working towards the " construction of a world order adapted to the emergence of new powers and therefore capable of dealing effectively with the challenges of the 21st century . 
" The specific initiatives [PER Sarkozy  ] said [LOC France  ] would be pursuing during the coming year -- from reform of the [ORG UNSC  ] to pressing for continued sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] , from expansion of the [MISC G-8  ] to the hosting of an [LOC Afghanistan  ] donors' conference -- all link to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's projected role for [LOC France  ] as leading the way towards the international unity needed to meet the environmental challenge to humanity from global warming and the political challenge to secular democracy from religious fundamentalists . 
END SUMMARY . 
NEW YEAR'S BEST WISHES TO THE [ORG DIPLOMATIC CORPS  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] delivered the [MISC French  ] president 's annual [MISC New Year  ] 's best wishes to the [ORG Diplomatic Corps  ] on the afternoon of January 18 . 
Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] and [PER DCM Pekala  ] attended the event -- remarks followed by reception -- at the [LOC Elysee  ] palace . 
Traditionally , [MISC French  ] presidents have used these events to review administration achievements and to unveil or re-iterate upcoming foreign policy initiatives . 
True to form , [PER Sarkozy  ] went beyond review of achievements and listing of initiatives , and laid out the justification for his projected reform of [LOC France  ] 's role on the international scene . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] began by pointing out -- as he does in connection with nearly every area of public policy -- " I was not elected to accept things as they are . 
I was elected to reform [LOC France  ] through a continuous process of profound reform . 
" He also underlined that [LOC France  ] 's foreign policy " had to stem from a lucid analysis , realistic about [LOC France  ] 's place in the world as the world is today . 
" TWO GREAT CHALLENGES -- AND THE NEED FOR UNITY --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's analysis of the state of the world today posits two great challenges -- climate change and religious fundamentalism . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] said that global warming 's " menace to humanity " and the intention of " certain groups to impose a fundamentalist , hegemonic and intolerant " religiosity would " restructure international society in the 21st century possibly more than ideologies did in the 20th . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] then argued that these challenges could be successfully met only " on one condition " -- " finding the unity " necessary for concerted , effective international action . 
The four major " innovations " in [LOC France  ] 's international affairs posture that [PER Sarkozy  ] then claimed he had or was putting in place , and the range of specific initiatives that he said [LOC France  ] would be pursuing in the coming year link directly , in [PER Sarkozy  ] 's view , to fostering the international unity necessary for taking effective action against these two challenges . 
COMMENT: In his presentation to the members of the diplomatic corps [PER Sarkozy  ] projected as a candidate on the campaign trail -- working hard to win over his listeners to his way of looking at things . 
As he has always done in connection with his domestic reform campaigns , [PER Sarkozy  ] sets great store in bringing people around to share his diagnosis of the situation , from which follow the courses of action he proposes . 
END COMMENT . 
FOUR " INNOVATIONS " ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The four foreign policy " innovations " [PER Sarkozy  ] claimed to be implementing are: 1 ) returning [LOC France  ] to the " heart of her [LOC Occidental  ] family , " 2 ) pursuing a " diplomacy of [LOC PARIS  ] 00000130 002.6 OF 003 C [ORG O R R E  ] C T E D C O P Y ( ADDED TAGS ) conciliation , " 3 ) affirming " diversity " while demanding that " its corollary , reciprocity " be honored by others , and 4 ) advocating a reformed international institutional order " adapted to the emergence of new powers and therefore capable of dealing effectively with the challenges of the 21st century . 
" While he rejected previous government 's use of the word " hyperpower " to describe the [LOC U.S.  ] , he did describe a multi-polar worldview with [LOC Europe  ] become one of the active poles. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
In connection with the first , he evoked [LOC France  ] 's new-found closeness to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Sarkozy  ] underlined that [LOC France  ] was a " voluntary partner " of the [LOC U.S.  ] , and an " independent ally and friend , " while clearly implying that [LOC France  ] , for the sake of its own effectiveness and credibility , was right to abandon its pretensions to representing an alternative to [LOC U.S.  ] leadership . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] also underlined , inQnection with [LOC France  ] 's getting back in step with the major western democracies , that doing so was key to advancing [LOC France  ] 's leadership role in the [ORG EU  ] . 
He said that " it was [LOC France  ] 's ambition to see the [ORG EU  ] emerge as an important global actor in the 21st century , " and that that required " the development of an effective [MISC European  ] defense " capability ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) independent of [ORG NATO  ] . 
He stressed that , in the face of today 's " range of threats and crises " [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG ESDP  ] were complimentary spans of a single security and defense architecture for [LOC Europe  ] . 
He said that [LOC France  ] 's new-found unity with the [LOC U.S.  ] and new-found unity with its [ORG EU  ] partners had reinforced [LOC France  ] 's leadership credibility both " internally , " among the western democracies , and " externally , " throughout the rest of the world. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Sarkozy  ] argued that [LOC France  ] 's " diplomacy of conciliation " worked to attenuate differences , and , by implication , promote the unity necessary for effective international action . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] justified his recent dealings with [PER Qadhafi  ] and [PER Hugo Chavez  ] in terms of this constructive engagement , [MISC French-style  ] , that he calls " diplomacy of conciliation . 
" He went on to say that [LOC France  ] 's foreign policies would henceforth be anchored in the affirmation of " diversity , and its corollary , reciprocity . 
" He justified the elevation of " diversity " to a guiding principle for foreign policies as follows , " Even more than the fight for democracy , it seems to me that the fight for diversity -- for openness , tolerance , acceptance of others in all their difference -- is fundamental . 
It is , in a way , the precondition for extending liberty and durably implanting democracy . 
" Lastly , [PER Sarkozy  ] claimed the " innovation " of advocating a reformed system of multi-lateral institutions , and again justified these proposals as necessary for achieving needed unity in the face of global challenges . 
SPECIFIC INITIATIVES ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Once he had dispatched the carefully constructed theoretical underpinnings of his framework for [LOC France  ] 's foreign policy , [PER Sarkozy  ] took up the range of specific initiatives that [LOC France  ] would be pursuing in the coming year . 
[PER NOTE: Sarkozy  ] 's speech , in its entirety , is available , in [MISC English  ] , on the [LOC Elysee  ] website at www.elysee.fr ; in addition , post has reported separately ( ref ) on the outlook for [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy as reflected in the speech ; furthermore , [MISC French  ] policy under [PER Sarkozy  ] in the critical areas of [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [ORG NATO/ESDP  ] , and [LOC Middle East Peace  ] have the subject of extensive and regular reporting . 
END NOTE . 
Among the most salient of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's specific initiatives aimed at reforming international institutions are enlarging the [ORG Security Council  ] in its two categories of members , and enlarging the [MISC G-8  ] to include , " progressively " [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] . 
In addition , [PER Sarkozy  ] called for reform of the [ORG IMF  ] , calling on it to become more inclusive of emerging economic powers and to develop a way of engaging the large international oil and other similarly profitable global companies , in financing the alleviation of poverty . 
He also said that " all must be done " to produce an agreement by 2009 up to the " colossal challenge of global warming via the [LOC Bali  ] process . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) He reiterated [LOC France  ] 's commitment to continuing sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] , while aiming to return [LOC Iran  ] to full respectability " once it respects international law . 
" [PER Sarkozy  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00000130 003.2 OF 003 confirmed that [LOC France  ] would host the next [LOC Afghanistan  ] donors conference . 
He said [LOC France  ] would support " the process envisaged at [LOC Annapolis  ] " to result " in the creation of a [MISC Palestinian State  ] side-by-side to the [MISC State of Israel  ] . 
" He reviewed [LOC France  ] 's priorities for its upcoming presidency of the [ORG EU  ] -- the [LOC Lisbon  ] treaty , the environment and energy , immigration , agriculture , and implementing [ORG ESDP  ] -- and he recommitted to " launching that important civilizational project , " the [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) In this speech , [PER Sarkozy  ] did not unveil any new or unexpected initiatives , but he did attempt to link [LOC France  ] 's foreign policy initiatives to pressing international problems without referring to " [LOC France  ] 's glory " or " [LOC France  ] 's history and civilization " . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] nevertheless articulated an ambitious foreign policy framework that should help guide our understand of the [MISC French  ] approach over the coming months including during its Presidency of the [ORG European Union  ] that begins in July .
