REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In [LOC Libya  ] , major business deals are both political and personal . 
The ongoing drama surrounding efforts by the [LOC U.K.  ] government and investors to keep open the [ORG Marks & Spencer  ] retail store in [LOC Tripoli  ] , and a campaign by some [ORG GOL  ] officials to close it , affords a prime example . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials at the highest levels have publicly attacked a major [MISC European  ] retailer - damaging bilateral ties with the [LOC U.K.  ] in the process - largely due to a personal grievance between the Prime Minister and the [MISC Libyan  ] businessman at the center of the deal . 
The fate of the store and the businessman are closely intertwined , and the ensuing test of wills reportedly has the potential to end in violence . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] Embassy , which is closely involved , has flatly told us they view the ultimate outcome of the case as an important bellwether of the investment climate in [LOC Libya  ] and will advise potential [LOC U.K.  ] investors accordingly . 
End Summary . 
THE TRAVAILS OF “MARKS & SPARKS” CONTINUE <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] retailer [ORG Marks & Spencer  ] ( [ORG M&S  ] ) , affectionately referred to in the [LOC U.K.  ] as “Marks & Sparks” , opened a location in [LOC Tripoli  ] in April that has since been a magnet for controversy ( ref A ) . 
The store has been closed by [MISC Libyan  ] authorities on at least two occasions , and there is a very good chance that it will be shut permanently in coming months . 
According to a local business contact with good second-hand knowledge of the situation , Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi’s office has become directly involved in the matter , and has directed that the franchise either be sold to unspecified government officials , or suffer an immediate freeze on further import of stock and be closed permanently by year’s end . 
[ORG M&S  ] employees have received close scrutiny by [MISC Libyan  ] security officials , who have been used as a strongarm adjunct in this political play ; employees were all taken in for a second round of questioning in early June . 
[ORG GOL  ] ADOPTS REPUGNANT ANTI-SEMITIC TACTICS <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Libyan  ] government’s public narrative has taken the form of persistent anti-Semitic rhetoric alleging that the company is a “Zionist entity” with [MISC Jewish  ] origins that supports [LOC Israel  ] and “the killing of [MISC Palestinians”  ] . 
A strongly-worded statement released to [MISC Libyan  ] media outlets in early June by the General Union of [ORG Chambers of Commerce and Industry  ] ( which ostensibly represents all private businesses in [LOC Libya  ] , both [MISC Libyan  ] and foreign ) condemned the fact that the store was still open and called for its permanent closure . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Chamber also voiced its disapproval of a recent stop at the [ORG M&S  ] store by the visiting [LOC U.K.  ] Trade Minister . 
According to the statement , the visit violated the [MISC Libyan  ] people’s sensibilities , as it fell “on the eve of al-Nakba” ( i.e. , the date of the [MISC Israeli  ] military victory in 1948 that created the modern state of [LOC Israel  ] ) . 
The [ORG U.K. Commercial Counselor  ] told us that [ORG M&S  ] had been removed in 2007 from the [MISC Arab League’s  ] list of companies to be boycotted because of [MISC Jewish  ] ownership or [MISC Israeli  ] equities , and that both [ORG M&S  ] and the [LOC U.K.  ] Embassy had done careful vetting with the [ORG GOL  ] before the [LOC Tripoli  ] store opened in an attempt to preclude any related complications . 
HOW DID IT COME TO THIS ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In typical fashion , while the GOL’s public criticism has comprised pseudo-populist rhetoric against “the forces of [LOC Zionism”  ] , the crux of the matter is in fact about personal relations and politics . 
The primary [MISC Libyan  ] agent for the [ORG Marks & Spencer  ] franchise in [LOC Libya  ] is well-known businessman [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was arrested in March 2007 as part of a government crack-down on several prominent businesspeople accused of illegally engaging in monopolistic business practices ( ref B ) . 
He has since been subject to a travel ban on several occasions , most recently in April-May . 
His impressive personal fortune , prominent public profile and dominance over several categories of consumer goods in [LOC Libya  ] gall government insiders and state-supported “men of commerce” . 
His acrimonious relationship with Prime Minister [PER Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi  ] is well-known - as reported ref B , he derisively referred to al-Mahmoudi as “that [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000480 002.2 OF 002 man” in a meeting of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Businessmens’ Council  ] to discuss private sector reform . 
Another member of Libya’s business elite described [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] as “dangerously candid” , noting that he does not mask his general disdain for the [ORG GOL  ] and its officials . 
AND HOW DOES IT END ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to a well-placed embassy [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contact , there is a genuine threat that state security officials may visit personal harm on [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( and others like him ) at the direction of “old guard” regime figures . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Telling our contact [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that “in the old days we would just arrest him” , they offered that they would instead “clip him down to nothing” by dismantling his business empire piecemeal and undertaking a campaign to diminish his business influence . 
They then noted darkly that if those methods proved insufficient , they would see to it that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was involved in a fatal car accident. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: The ongoing drama of [ORG M&S  ] illustrates the confluence of the personal and the political in a commercial climate in which senior regime officials have a direct stake in virtually anything worth owning or selling . 
The fact that a small number of business elites like [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have managed to amass considerable fortunes without paying the tithe that senior regime officials consider to be their due rankles greatly . 
PM al-Mahmoudi’s attack on [ORG M&S  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , motivated as far as most observers can tell solely by personal animus , has created friction with the [LOC U.K.  ] and prompted questions by [MISC Libyan  ] and foreign concerns about the extent to which the business and investment climate has actually improved . 
Some [MISC Libyan  ] observers have expressed concern that [ORG M&S  ] was allowed to open in the first place if the government’s position was that it was a “Jewish-owned company” and therefore should not be allowed to operate in [LOC Libya  ] . 
A prominent business contact told us that the travails of [ORG M&S  ] served as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences for investors of the sheer lack of coordination and fecklessness in the [ORG GOL  ] . 
The public and ham-fisted manner in which the [ORG GOL  ] is pursuing this matter has ensured that any action taken against [ORG M&S  ] and/or [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] will quickly become common knowledge , which may give the [ORG GOL  ] pause before it acts too rashly against either . 
[LOC U.K.  ] Emboffs have flatly told us that they view the ultimate outcome of the case as an important bellwether of the investment climate in [LOC Libya  ] and will advise potential [LOC U.K.  ] investors accordingly .
