( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
Embassy Abu [LOC Dhabi  ] looks forward to welcoming you to the [LOC UAE  ] on May 7 . 
[LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UAE  ] officials have had a number of productive meetings on the topic of counterterrorism , the most recent of which came on April 22 , when [PER Fran Townsend  ] , Assistant to the President for [ORG Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  ] , met over lunch with Abu [ORG Dhabi Crown  ] Prince Sheikh [MISC Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( MbZ ) and his brother , Foreign Minister [PER Sheikh Abdullah  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( [ORG AbZ  ] ) . 
Your visit builds on our ongoing dialogue and efforts to push the [LOC UAE  ] on several areas of interest to the [MISC USG:  ] counterterrorism , counter terror finance , [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and ideological extremism ( each is covered in the scenesetter ) . 
We have requested separate meetings with Foreign Minister [PER Sheikh Abdullah  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( [ORG AbZ  ] ) , whom you met in [LOC New York  ] last September , and [ORG State Security  ] Director [PER Sheikh  ] Hazza bin [PER Zayed  ] , whom Deputy Coordinator [PER Urbancic  ] met last October . 
In your meetings , you should commend the [LOC UAE  ] for its assistance and cooperation , including its strong condemnation of the April 24 bomb attack in [LOC Dahab  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] remains a committed partner in the global war on terror , but it continues to take an ad hoc approach to countering terrorism that " solves " the problem for the [LOC UAE  ] locally , but fails to contribute on a transnational basis . 
In January , the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UAE  ] held the first meeting of the [ORG Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating Committee  ] ( [ORG JTFCC  ] ) . 
Treasury [PER U/S Levey  ] is currently in the [LOC UAE  ] to hold a second meeting that will focus on cash couriers and charities. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Although the [LOC UAE  ] regards [LOC Iran  ] as one of its most serious threats to national security , [LOC UAE  ] officials are reluctant to take actions that could provoke their neighbor and compromise their extensive trading relationship . 
At the same time , we are seeing more of a willingness on the part of the [LOC UAE  ] to support [ORG USG  ] initiatives without the full approval of the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] ( [ORG GCC  ] ) . 
As tensions escalate between [LOC Iran  ] and the international community , the [LOC UAE  ] is growing increasingly nervous . 
The [LOC UAE  ] leadership , which has told us they consider [ORG Hamas  ] a terrorist organization , plans to uphold its previous commitments of humanitarian assistance to the [MISC Palestinian  ] people . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has taken an active role in encouraging [MISC Sunni  ] participation in the [MISC Iraqi  ] political process and continues to condemn the sectarian violence that is preventing stabilization of the country . 
In the face of growing ideological extremism in the [LOC Gulf  ] , the [LOC UAE  ] leadership is politically determined not to allow [MISC Islamist  ] extremists to gain a foothold on [LOC UAE  ] soil . 
End Summary . 
Counterterrorism Efforts ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] is concerned about the terrorist threat to the [LOC UAE  ] , but lacks a comprehensive implementation strategy for reducing its vulnerability ( ref A ) . 
The [LOC UAE  ] considers homeland security one of its top priorities , but rather than prioritizing national security projects , its efforts have focused on contracting risk assessments , forming committees , and procuring equipment . 
In your meetings , we recommend that you inquire about the government 's plan , announced by President [PER Khalifa  ] in December 2005 , to place all the security agencies under a newly established [ORG National Security Council  ] . 
MbZ , asked by [PER Townsend  ] if the [LOC UAE  ] was worried about its oil infrastructure , responded emphatically , " absolutely . 
" He told [PER Townsend  ] that there are three international companies currently conducting risk assessments of the [LOC UAE  ] oil infrastructure and maritime security for the [ORG UAEG  ] . 
[PER Townsend  ] offered [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in helping the [LOC UAE  ] to reduce its vulnerability ( ref O ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG UAEG  ] reacts quickly when presented with evidence of a terrorist presence inside the [LOC UAE  ] , but does not approach the problem from a transnational posture . 
The [LOC UAE  ] 's immediate response when terrorists pose a risk is to deport them . 
[LOC UAE  ] agencies do not investigate fully to see how far the problem goes or whether there is an international network involved . 
Although the U.S./UAE counterterrorism cooperation is strong ( with the [LOC UAE  ] working closely with the [ORG USG  ] on specific cases ) , [PER Emiratis  ] do not consistently share lead information found in the possession of individuals in their custody with each other or with the [ORG U.S. Government  ] . 
These tactics limit law enforcement and intelligence services' ability to use intelligence to disrupt extremist cells and planned attacks . 
The [LOC UAE  ] 's insistence on deportation as a solution does not protect the country long-term or truly address the nature and scope of the problem . 
[PER Townsend  ] discussed this matter with MbZ and urged the [LOC UAE  ] to instead to fully investigate terror suspects and share the results of those inquiries with the [ORG USG  ] . 
Counterterrorism Finance ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] has made significant strides in regulating the financial sector against money laundering and terrorist financing ( ref B ) . 
Although the [LOC UAE  ] now has a strong legal framework in place , it must turn its efforts to enforcement . 
It is imperative that [LOC UAE  ] authorities investigate and prosecute violators of terror finance/anti-money laundering , cash courier , and charity laws and regulations . 
To date , investigation and prosecution have been weak . 
In an effort to increase [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UAE  ] cooperation on terrorist financing , the first meeting of the [ORG U.S/UAE Joint Terrorist Finance Coordinating Committee  ] ( [ORG JTFCC  ] ) was held in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] on January 24 , 2005 ( ref C ) . 
The [LOC UAE  ] team had representatives from the [ORG Central Bank  ] , [ORG State Security , Ministries of Interior  ] , Foreign Affairs , and [ORG Justice  ] . 
However , no one participated from [LOC Dubai  ] . 
In order for the [ORG JTFCC  ] to be an effective committee , [LOC Dubai  ] 's Police , [ORG State Security , Customs  ] , and the [ORG Department of Islamic Affairs and Charities  ] must participate . 
The April 30 meeting will focus on cash couriers and charity regulations . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [MISC S/NF  ] ) [LOC UAE  ] leaders are very concerned about escalating tensions between [LOC Iran  ] and the international community . 
[ORG AbZ  ] publicly expressed his country 's concern , and the entire region 's " vulnerability , " at a press conference in [LOC Kuwait  ] April 25 , while urging a peaceful resolution ( ref M ) . 
Commercial ties between [LOC Dubai  ] and [LOC Iran  ] are significant ( [LOC Dubai  ] is [LOC Iran  ] 's largest non-oil trading partner ) , and as a result the [ORG UAEG  ] walks a fine line between maintaining and encouraging this trade and working to prevent suspected [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation activities . 
Although the [ORG UAEG  ] is worried about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions , its short-term policy decisions regarding [LOC Iran  ] center on not provoking its neighbor . 
The [ORG USG  ] has approached the [ORG UAEG  ] four times since January , asking it to interdict and inspect cargo suspected of going to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear and/or missile programs . 
None of those instances has resulted in a successful interdiction . 
In the first two instances [LOC UAE  ] officials simply refused to take action ( refs F and G ) . 
The Director of [LOC Dubai  ] 's [ORG State Security Organization  ] explained during the 11 February U.S./UAE Counterproliferation [ORG Task Force  ] meeting that the decision not to inspect the containers had been a political decision based on the [LOC UAE  ] 's concern that [LOC Iran  ] might retaliate ( ref H ) . 
In the two later instances ( ref K ) , ships that had been scheduled to arrive in [LOC Dubai  ] went directly to [LOC Bandar Abbas  ] . 
[PER AbZ  ] told [PER U/S Joseph  ] during his April 8 visit to [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] that the [ORG USG  ] should approach the [LOC UAE  ] on interdiction requests " only as a last resort " ( ref N ) . 
Two weeks later , he assured [PER Townsend  ] that the [ORG UAEG  ] does not want [LOC Iran  ] to take advantage of the [LOC UAE  ] 's open trading environment . 
He said the [LOC UAE  ] was in the final stages of ratifying its export control law and that it would be announced " soon . 
" In an encouraging development , the [LOC UAE  ] on April 15 privately endorsed the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] 's Statement of [ORG Interdiction Principles  ] ( ref L ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In recent meetings with senior [ORG USG  ] officials , [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] 's ruling family has expressed clear support for [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives against [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UAE  ] have a " common desire to succeed , " [PER AbZ  ] told [PER U/S Joseph  ] , noting that the combination of [LOC Iran  ] and terrorism is something that cannot be tolerated . 
" The threat from al-Qa'ida would be minor if [LOC Iran  ] has nukes , " [PER AbZ  ] said ( ref N ) . 
MbZ told [PER Townsend April  ] 22 that the [MISC Iranians  ] think that the [LOC U.S.  ] will not do anything about their recent declaration that they have successfully enriched uranium . 
He added that he thought the [MISC Iranians  ] were wrong . 
MbZ and [ORG UAE Vice  ] President and Prime Minister Sheikh [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Rashid  ] agreed with Secretary Rice February 23 about the need to counter [LOC Iran  ] 's growing influence in the region and its nuclear ambitions , although they specified that any sanctions should target the key [MISC Iranian  ] leadership , not the [MISC Iranian  ] people ( ref I ) . 
MbZ told [ORG A/S Welch  ] March 28 that he did not think it was necessary to wait for all [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] ( [ORG GCC  ] ) countries to agree before proceeding with any [LOC U.S.  ] plans against [LOC Iran  ] ( ref E ) . 
He told [ORG A/S Welch  ] that the [LOC UAE  ] would prepare a paper responding to [ORG USG  ] concerns about [LOC Iran  ] and mechanisms for addressing the challenge posed by [LOC Iran  ] . 
In a March 27 meeting with [ORG CENTCOM Commander  ] General [PER Abizaid  ] , [PER MbZ  ] spoke about the [MISC Iranian  ] threat with a greater sense of urgency . 
He was strongly in favor of taking action against [LOC Iran  ] and its president sooner rather than later . 
" I believe this guy is going to take us to war. .. . 
It 's a matter of time , " [PER MbZ  ] warned , adding that action against [LOC Iran  ] and President [PER Ahmedinejad  ] should be taken this year or next year. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [MISC S/NF  ] ) SSD Director [PER Hazza  ] told [ORG A/S Welch  ] March 29 that the [PER Ayatollah Ali Khameini  ] had once issued a fatwa prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons by [LOC Iran  ] , but noted that this should not be considered a guarantee . 
[PER Hazza  ] assessed that [LOC Iran  ] is also a threat due to its ties to international terrorist organizations , including al-Qaida , as well as their financial support to [ORG Hamas  ] . 
He added that the relationship between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , and their links to [ORG Hizballah  ] , was also of concern , as was [LOC Iran  ] 's attempts to expand its influence in [LOC Iraq  ] and elsewhere in the world . 
[PER MbZ  ] also expressed to [ORG A/S Welch  ] March 28 the concern that [ORG Hizballah  ] was supporting [ORG Hamas  ] . 
During your meetings , you should explain the graduated approach to addressing [LOC Iran  ] in the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] and encourage the [LOC UAE  ] to isolate Iran--regardless of potential economic backlash . 
You should also explain the importance of the [LOC UAE  ] working closely with the [ORG USG  ] on interdiction requests . 
These meetings will be a good follow-on to the discussion [PER U/S Joseph  ] had with [ORG AbZ April  ] 8 , when [PER Joseph  ] outlined the [ORG USG  ] 's policy priorities for [LOC Iran  ] . 
( Note: While [PER AbZ  ] , like [PER MbZ  ] , expressed support for [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives against [LOC Iran  ] , he stated that the [ORG USG  ] should come to the [LOC UAE  ] as a " very last resort. .. . 
If you can solve something without involving the [LOC UAE  ] , please do so . 
" End Note . 
) [MISC Palestinian  ] Territories/Hamas ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC UAE  ] leaders have told us that they consider [ORG Hamas  ] a terrorist organization and that they would not fund [ORG Hamas  ] unless they denounce violence ( refs D and E ) . 
However , after [ORG Hamas  ] political chief [PER Khaled Meshaal  ] visited [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] on March 22 and met with [LOC UAE  ] Minister of Presidential Affairs Sheikh [LOC Mansour  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] al-Nahyan and Minister of [ORG State for Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Mohammed  ] al-Sha'ali , [PER Meshaal  ] publicly claimed that the [ORG UAEG  ] had pledged to continue to provide financial assistance to the Hamas-led [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( ref J ) . 
[PER MbZ  ] told [ORG A/S Welch  ] March 28 that the [ORG UAEG  ] allowed [PER Meshaal  ] to come , but that " officially , we don't recognize [PER Khaled Meshaal  ] . 
" [PER MbZ  ] said that once a new [MISC Palestinian  ] Prime Minister is selected , [ORG UAEG  ] officials will travel to the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories to ascertain that [ORG UAEG  ] assistance is " going to the right people . 
" In his meeting with [PER Townsend  ] , [PER MbZ  ] said that the [LOC UAE  ] " felt the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] rally behind [ORG Hamas  ] " after its electoral victory in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories , and that the [ORG Hamas  ] victory should be a lesson to the [LOC West  ] . 
[LOC UAE  ] Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Rashid  ] sounded a note of optimism when he told Secretary Rice February 23 that [ORG Hamas  ] , " with some pressure , " [ORG SIPDIS  ] would understand the need to respect the will of the international community. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] has historically provided significant financial assistance to the [MISC Palestinian  ] people . 
Typically , the [LOC UAE  ] sends aid to the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories through charity organizations , or by projectized assistance ; but the [ORG UAEG  ] has also provided financial assistance directly to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , most recently $20 million in March 2006 to [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] for salaries . 
In the wake of the [ORG Hamas  ] electoral victory , [LOC UAE  ] leaders told us they intend to honor their previous commitments of humanitarian assistance ( including the $100 million Sheikh [PER Khalifa  ] housing complex that was announced last year ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In his meeting with [ORG A/S Welch  ] March 29 , SSD Director [PER Hazza  ] assessed that there was both a positive and a negative side to the [ORG Hamas  ] election win . 
On the negative side , he cited [MISC Hamas'  ] position with regard to [LOC Israel  ] , and their violent agenda . 
On the positive side , [PER Hazza  ] noted the fact that [ORG Hamas  ] was now in power and was accountable to the international community . 
He spoke to [ORG A/S Welch  ] of the threat posed by the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
[PER Hazza  ] also asked [ORG A/S Welch  ] how the [ORG USG  ] would react to those countries that did support the [ORG Hamas  ] government , and whether they would run afoul of [LOC U.S.  ] laws restricting support to terrorist organizations . 
[ORG A/S Welch  ] replied that that would be a problem , emphasizing that no money should go to the government unless [ORG Hamas  ] renounced violence and accepted [LOC Israel  ] . 
[ORG A/S Welch  ] also told [PER Hazza  ] that it was not the responsibility of the [LOC U.S.  ] or other Arab countries to pay the salaries of the new [ORG Hamas  ] government , underscoring the need for [ORG Hamas  ] to show accountability . 
[PER MbZ  ] told [ORG A/S Welch  ] that [ORG Hamas  ] benefited from " official and private contributions " from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , and [LOC Qatar  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] said it was " easy to take $1 million in a suitcase " to [LOC Lebanon  ] , alluding to cash couriers . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) A partner in the war on terror , the [LOC UAE  ] continues to provide [LOC U.S.  ] forces access , overflight clearances , and other critical logistical assistance to [ORG Operation Iraqi Freedom  ] and [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has also been a helpful supporter of [LOC Iraq  ] 's burgeoning political process . 
It has worked with [MISC Iraqi  ] political and religious figures to encourage greater [MISC Sunni  ] integration , and it has consulted with Ambassador [PER Khalilzad  ] on a number of occasions about the need to stem sectarianism in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [LOC UAE  ] has publicly condemned acts of sectarian and terrorist violence in [LOC Iraq  ] , most recently , the February 22 bombing of the al-Askariya [LOC Shrine  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] told [PER Townsend  ] that he had " no confidence " in the new [MISC Iraqi  ] Prime Minister-designate , [PER Jawad al-Maliki  ] , and he reiterated his concern about [LOC Iran  ] 's meddling in [LOC Iraq  ] 's internal affairs . 
He has pledged the [LOC UAE  ] 's support to the fight against al-Qaida . 
Ideological Extremism --------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] ruling family continue to be outspoken on the issue of [MISC Muslim  ] extremists and the threat they pose to the region . 
[PER MbZ  ] told [PER Townsend  ] that if there were an election in [LOC Dubai  ] tomorrow , the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] would take over . 
He said the challenge is to find a way to remove the extremists in a way that they never come back . 
One way he and his brothers have been trying to accomplish this is by reforming the education system , which they say was penetrated by the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] in the late 1960s . 
( Note: The [LOC UAE  ] has announced that half of the members of the [ORG Federal National Council  ] would be elected while half would continue to be appointed by the rulers of the various emirates . 
Despite this announcement , the [LOC UAE  ] still lags behind other Gulf states in terms of democratization . 
End Note . 
) [LOC UAE  ] officials publicly and strongly condemn extremism and terrorist attacks , anti-extremism has been the focus of government-approved Friday sermons in the mosques .
