Bell  ] , Acting Economics Chief , [ORG US Department of State , Economics Section  ] ; [ORG REASON:  ] 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) We expect [LOC Serbia  ] will continue to obstruct and undermine [MISC Kosovo’s  ] sovereignty in the lead up to and following the [ORG International Court of Justice’s  ] advisory opinion , which most believe will be ambiguous . 
Regardless of the position taken by the [ORG ICJ  ] , [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence and sovereignty are irrefutable . 
[MISC Serbia’s  ] government is unified in its refusal to accept that fact but is internally divided regarding how to push its claim to [LOC Kosovo  ] after the [ORG ICJ  ] issues its opinion in spring 2010 . 
President [PER Boris Tadic  ] and his office appear willing to follow our and the EU’s advice and to quietly accept any outcome while moving [LOC Serbia  ] toward [ORG EU  ] integration , but are lacking a coordinated plan to do so . 
In contrast , Foreign Minister [PER Vuk Jeremic  ] , driven by personal interest in self promotion and a misperception of the domestic political landscape , is planning a new diplomatic offensive on [LOC Kosovo  ] on the heels of any [ORG ICJ  ] opinion . 
Absent an alternative approach by [PER Tadic  ] , we expect [PER Jeremic’s  ] more confrontational plan will win out . 
To temper [MISC Serbia’s  ] post [ORG ICJ  ] strategy and to limit its duration and impact , we will need to be well coordinated with our [ORG EU  ] allies and encourage the [ORG EU  ] to wisely use its significant remaining carrots and sticks with [LOC Serbia  ] to elicit the cooperative resolution of this issue , while assuring [MISC Kosovo’s  ] territorial integrity . 
We must also be prepared to fight [LOC Serbia  ] in the [ORG UNGA  ] if necessary . 
End Summary . 
Preparing for the [ORG Advisory Opinion  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over the next several months as the [ORG ICJ  ] deliberates , we expect Foreign Minister [PER Jeremic  ] to maintain an offensive posture and continue his globe spanning travels , heralding the upcoming [ORG ICJ  ] decision at each stop . 
He will try to prevent any further recognitions of [LOC Kosovo  ] during this interim period and to shore up support from [MISC Serbia’s  ] allies , particularly [LOC Russia  ] , the [ORG EU  ] non-recognizers ( [LOC Cyprus  ] , [LOC Greece  ] , [LOC Romania  ] , [LOC Slovakia  ] and [LOC Spain  ] ) and members of the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] . 
Previewing his intentions , [MISC Serbian  ] media reported on December 25 that [PER Jeremic  ] sent a letter to foreign ministers of countries which have not recognized [LOC Kosovo  ] , expressing gratitude for upholding the [ORG UN Charter  ] and the hope that they would continue to respect [MISC Serbia’s  ] sovereignty and territorial integrity . 
In addition , [PER Jeremic  ] wrote that the [ORG ICJ  ] opinion “must not be obstructed in any way , ” suggesting that political meddling could influence the court’s opinion . 
Absent direct intervention from President [PER Tadic  ] , we expect [PER Jeremic  ] will continue his quixotic global campaign with vigor . 
[ORG ICJ Opinion Likely  ] to be Ambiguous ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Serbian  ] government expects the [ORG ICJ  ] to deliver its opinion to the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] by spring 2010 . 
Media and analysts have speculated that the most likely scenario is for the [ORG ICJ  ] to issue multiple opinions , with some supporting [LOC Kosovo  ] and others [LOC Serbia  ] . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] Minister [PER Goran Bogdanovic  ] told local media on December 25 that he expected there would be significant political pressure to make the ICJ’s decision “more neutral.” [LOC Serbia  ] is thus preparing for an outcome that remains ambiguous , with both sides claiming victory . 
While the ruling’s expected ambiguity could provide [LOC Serbia  ] an opportunity to end its campaign against [LOC Kosovo  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Jeremic  ] has already said [LOC Serbia  ] will take no action that implies [MISC Serbia’s  ] recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] ( reftel ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Serbian  ] politicians , including influential Minister of Labor and Social Affairs [PER Rasim Ljajic  ] , have told us that [LOC Serbia  ] cannot merely forget [LOC Kosovo  ] out of fear that the vocal and numerous opposition will accuse [PER Tadic  ] of treason . 
[PER Ljajic  ] pointed to the recent Progressive ( SNS ) victory in the [LOC Belgrade  ] municipality of [LOC Vozdevac  ] as a clear sign that the opposition has the potential to [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000003 002 OF 004 pose a real threat to the governing coalition . 
As a result , [MISC Serbian  ] officials are now contemplating how vocal and obstructive the [ORG GoS  ] should be after any final [ORG ICJ  ] ruling in order to assure their political majority . 
[ORG Tadic’s Unclear Path  ] -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Over the past month several [MISC European  ] interlocutors have stressed with President [PER Tadic  ] the need to move beyond [LOC Kosovo  ] and to focus on [MISC Serbia’s European  ] integration . 
We believe the message is beginning to sink in with [PER Tadic  ] , but he still lacks a coordinated strategy to implement . 
[ORG Tadic’s National Security Advisor  ] , [PER Miki Rakic  ] , told [ORG Charge Brush  ] on December 10that the government still had no plan for its post-ICJ policy and was only then beginning to consider alternatives . 
In separate meetings with [ORG Charge Brush  ] on December 28 and 29 , Defense Minister [PER Sutanovac  ] and informal presidential advisor [PER Srdjan Saper  ] both seemed confused when [ORG Charge Brush  ] asked about [ORG Tadic’s  ] post-ICJ strategy , with neither even willing to speculate on what the President might be thinking. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG EU  ] sources in [LOC Belgrade  ] confirm that during his December 15 meeting with [PER Tadic  ] [ORG EU  ] Director General for Foreign Affairs [PER Robert Cooper  ] encouraged [LOC Serbia  ] to think carefully about how it would handle [LOC Kosovo  ] issues after the [ORG ICJ  ] opinion . 
According to our [ORG EU  ] sources , [PER Tadic  ] and his foreign policy advisor [PER Jovan Ratkovic  ] told [PER Cooper  ] that [LOC Serbia  ] was currently analyzing four possible post [ORG ICJ  ] scenarios , but had yet to “draw any firm conclusions.” Specifically [PER Tadic  ] mentioned consideration of the [MISC China-Taiwan  ] model and the “two [MISC Germanies”  ] scenario , recognizing that any outcome would need to be tailored to [MISC Kosovo’s  ] “special situation.” [PER Tadic  ] reportedly told [PER Cooper  ] that after the [ORG ICJ  ] advisory opinion [LOC Belgrade  ] would be more than ready to talk to [LOC Pristina  ] -even directly- as long as talks were not perceived or portrayed as [LOC Serbia  ] directly or indirectly recognizing [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Thoughts of [MISC Partition  ] still in their Heads ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Tadic  ] reportedly told [PER Cooper  ] that he recognized that there needed to be a degree of clarity and finality to any outcome , cognizant that the [ORG EU  ] would be unwilling to accept another “Cyprus-like” state as a member . 
[PER Ratkovic  ] more explicitly told [PER Cooper  ] that while [LOC Belgrade  ] would need to accept that it would not govern [LOC Kosovo  ] again , [LOC Kosovo  ] would have to come to the realization that it would not effectively be able to extend its governance north of the [LOC Ibar river  ] . 
[PER Tadic  ] reiterated to [PER Cooper  ] that ultimately [MISC Serbia’s  ] post [ORG ICJ  ] strategy was being developed to avoid [LOC Serbia  ] being a problem to its international partners but where its “concerns were taken care of.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Belgrade’s Quint ( [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Italy  ] ) have frequently discussed the seriousness of [MISC Serbia’s  ] plans . 
Although listening to FM [PER Jeremic  ] would lead one to believe that the Minister actually has a plan for new status talks , neither he nor any other [ORG GoS  ] official has ever publicly fleshed out [MISC Serbian  ] goals , much less the details for any such talks . 
In a January 6 conversation with [MISC ChargC  ] ) [ORG Brush  ] , [PER Ratkovic  ] would say only that “Serbia did not send the [LOC Kosovo  ] issue to the [ORG ICJ  ] just to have it come back and blow everything up ; we will use the ruling to increase regional stability.” [PER Jeremic’s Preferred Path  ] ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Despite claims from [ORG MFA Political  ] Director [PER Borko Stefanovic  ] [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000003 003 OF 004 to [ORG Charge Brush  ] on December 21 that the [ORG MFA  ] was seeking “a way out of its [LOC Kosovo  ] strategy post ICJ” we believe FM [PER Jeremic  ] intends to continue to beat the [LOC Kosovo  ] drum throughout 2010 . 
[PER Jeremic  ] is reportedly championing an alternative scenario under which the [ORG GoS  ] would seek to “legalize any [ORG ICJ  ] opinion , ” as [ORG MFA State  ] Secretary [PER Stefanovic  ] told [PER Cooper  ] on December 14 . 
[MISC Serbia’s  ] goal could be to again use the [ORG UN  ] to bolster the political legitimacy of its stance against [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence . 
We expect the [ORG MFA  ] envisions a multi-month process during which [LOC Serbia  ] would try to persuade the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] to adopt a resolution welcoming the [ORG ICJ  ] ruling ( or perhaps the portions favorable to [MISC Serbia’s  ] position ) and calling for new negotiations as a result . 
If the [ORG UN  ] effort is unsuccessful , the [ORG GoS  ] might energize the [ORG NAM  ] to issue a statement calling for new talks. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Under [PER Jeremic’s  ] scenario we expect [LOC Serbia  ] would aim to reopen negotiations on [MISC Kosovo’s  ] status . 
The [ORG MFA  ] would likely not seek direct talks with [LOC Pristina  ] authorities but rather would insist upon a new , “impartial” international negotiator from a non-recognizing country . 
While [MISC Serbia’s  ] goal would be to reopen talks , it would not be in any hurry to conclude them and instead would try to drag out any talks for years . 
The ruling [ORG Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG DS  ] ) would likely want to postpone any result until after parliamentary elections scheduled at the latest for May 2012 . 
[PER EU’s Carrots  ] and Sticks ----------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While no [ORG EU  ] state expects [LOC Serbia  ] to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] , [MISC Serbia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] path will remain muddled without recognizable and accepted borders between [LOC Serbia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] must lead the charge in making this clear to [LOC Serbia  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] must be willing to offer [LOC Serbia  ] carrots and sticks until there is a clearly accepted understanding of where [LOC Serbia  ] ends and the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Kosovo  ] begins , while maintaining [MISC Kosovo’s  ] current territorial integrity . 
Levers at the [PER EU’s  ] disposal include determining when to unblock the [LOC SAA  ] with [LOC Serbia  ] , the disbursement of [ORG IPA  ] funds , and the speed with which the [ORG EU  ] will consider [MISC Serbia’s  ] recently submitted application for [ORG EU  ] candidacy . 
We also must be wary of [ORG EU  ] states offering [LOC Serbia  ] the wrong carrots . 
The [LOC UK  ] Ambassador to [LOC Belgrade  ] recently suggested to us that we should no longer push for additional countries to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] , in an effort to dissuade [PER Jeremic  ] from his own globe-trotting efforts to dissuade recognitions . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Approach ------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The arrival of the new [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador , coupled with two upcoming [ORG CODELS  ] ( [PER Voinovich  ] and [PER Pomeroy  ] ) , may provide the [ORG USG  ] excellent opportunities to help President [PER Tadic  ] orient his rhetoric to [MISC European  ] integration and the benefits thereof . 
During his December 15 meeting with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , [PER Jeremic  ] invited her to visit [LOC Serbia  ] in 2010 . 
A visit in advance of the [ORG ICJ  ] decision ( the first since [PER Powell  ] visited in 2003 for PM Djindjic’s funeral ) would highlight [ORG USG  ] support for [ORG Tadic’s  ] [ORG EU  ] path and help steer him away from any pressure to consider new status negotiations . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) If [LOC Belgrade  ] follows the path that President [PER Tadic  ] appears to favor , [LOC Serbia  ] will be able to move forward with [ORG EU  ] integration while still not recognizing [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
If however , when the [ORG ICJ  ] opinion is issued , [PER Jeremic  ] is the only one with a plan , the [ORG GOS  ] is likely to pursue the misguided idea of continuing to battle in the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
This course will at least delay and at worse threaten [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000003 004 OF 004 [MISC Serbia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] aspirations . 
In either case , we must snuff out any further roundabout talk on partition by both President [PER Tadic  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Jeremic.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) We must use the next few months before the [ORG ICJ  ] issues its opinion to press [PER Tadic  ] to put the battle for [LOC Kosovo  ] behind him once and for all and focus all of his government’s energy on [ORG EU  ] accession . 
The initial step is to encourage our [ORG EU  ] Quint members to clearly state to [PER Jeremic  ] and [PER Tadic  ] that [LOC Serbia  ] risks complicating its [ORG EU  ] path if it continues to push for new status negotiations after an [ORG ICJ  ] opinion . 
[ORG EU  ] Quint members in [LOC Belgrade  ] have told us they intend to meet with [PER Jeremic  ] soon to stress this specific point , pending guidance from their capitals . 
This message , however , will need to be reinforced directly by [ORG EU  ] capitals and from [LOC Brussels  ] . 
If our strategy is to be effective , we need to encourage [LOC Brussels  ] to have a clear , coordinated policy regarding the linkage between [MISC Serbia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] path and resolving practical issues with [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
If [LOC Serbia  ] fails to heed this message we and our like minded [MISC European  ] partners will need to prepare to defeat any new [LOC Kosovo  ] resolution in the [ORG UNGA  ] next fall . 
This will require an aggressive strategy to counter [MISC Serbia’s  ] lobbying. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Any strategy must include a coordinated statement from [LOC Washington  ] and [MISC European  ] capitals at the highest levels that [MISC Kosovo’s  ] partition is not an option and that continued defacto partition through [MISC Serbian  ] interference will also put [MISC Serbia’s  ] [ORG EU  ] membership on hold . 
This will require a coordinated effort with the [ORG European Union  ] , which must be persuaded to use its leverage in tangible ways . 
A visit by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary to [LOC Belgrade  ] before the [ORG ICJ  ] ruling would help solidify this message both in [LOC Belgrade  ] and in [ORG EU  ] capitals .
