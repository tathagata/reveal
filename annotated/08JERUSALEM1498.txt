He said [ORG PASF  ] chiefs also gave the [ORG IDF  ] commanders a list of requests to improve security coordination , handling of fugitives and the local economy , including: -- Ending uncoordinated [ORG IDF  ] incursions and transferring security responsibility to the [ORG PA  ] in agreed areas ; -- Expediting clearance for the [ORG PA  ] to move between towns ( and A/B areas ) and eliminating the requirement for advance approval for altering [ORG PA  ] checkpoints inside [LOC Area A  ] ; -- Opening [PER Shavei Shomron  ] checkpoint until midnight daily and setting its status as " open , no inspections " ( as reported Ref A , the recently opened road gate currently closes at 1800 ) and removing [LOC Hamra  ] checkpoint ( SE of [LOC Tubas  ] on the foothills above the [LOC Jordan Valley  ] ) ; -- Better facilitating entry of [MISC Arab-Israelis  ] into [LOC Jenin  ] , including allowing their personal vehicles to enter [LOC Jenin  ] with outbound inspections ( discussed Ref C ) ; -- Expediting the amnesty timeline for fugitive accepted into the disarmament/amnesty program. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG MG  ] [PER Ali  ] and other [ORG PASF  ] chiefs told [PER PolOff  ] and [ORG POL FSN  ] that [ORG BGs Tibon  ] and [PER Mordechai  ] said they will consider the requests and provide an answer at a follow-up meeting next week ( no date set ) . 
He said the general tenor of the meeting was highly positive , but as the [ORG IDF  ] did not commit to act on the requests , the meeting was incomplete . 
He commented that [PER JERUSALEM  ] 00001498 002 OF 002 past meetings had not usually resulted in major improvements on the ground . 
He said the [ORG IDF  ] 's repeated denials of [ORG PA  ] requests to deploy additional forces in [LOC Hebron  ] was a problem and the [ORG PA  ] assesses that , separate from concern about [MISC Hizb  ] al-Tahrir activities , [LOC Hebron  ] most needs a security campaign to eliminate terrorist and organized criminal threats .
