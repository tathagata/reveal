08 [LOC MADRID  ] 1280 [LOC MADRID  ] 00000113 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Arnold A. Chacon  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: During a January 29 lunch , the [ORG CDA  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] MOD Secretary General for Policy [PER Luis Cuesta  ] discussed a possible [ORG MOD  ] visit to [LOC Washington  ] in June , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the bilateral Agreement on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] , an incident during a port call in [LOC Barcelona  ] , [LOC Gaza  ] arms smuggling , and so-called [LOC Guantanamo  ] flights . 
End summary . 
[ORG MOD Visit  ] to [LOC U.S.  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Cuesta  ] said [ORG MOD Carme  ] [PER Chacon  ] hoped to visit [LOC Washington  ] at the beginning of June ( preferably traveling June 1 and meeting June 2 or 3 ) for a meeting with [ORG SECDEF  ] . 
[PER Cuesta  ] noted [LOC Spain  ] 's interest in perhaps scheduling the next bilateral [ORG High-Level Defense Committee  ] meeting in the [LOC U.S.  ] in conjunction with that visit . 
( [MISC Note:  ] This annual [ORG HLDC  ] meeting alternates between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] . 
It was held in the [LOC U.S.  ] in 2008 . 
End note ) . 
He mentioned [PER Chacon  ] might also travel to [LOC Pensacola  ] , [LOC Florida  ] after visiting [LOC Washington  ] to join celebrations of the 450th anniversary of that city 's founding by the [MISC Spanish  ] . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Cuesta  ] alluded to recent press articles which suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] was increasingly concerned about [MISC Afghan  ] Government corruption and ineffectiveness and skeptical of President [PER Karzai  ] . 
[PER Cuesta  ] suggested this mirrored [MISC Spanish  ] thinking . 
The [ORG CDA  ] pressed [PER Cuesta  ] on what [LOC Spain  ] might be planning to contribute in support of the [MISC Afghan  ] elections and an increased long-term [MISC Spanish  ] commitment to the larger allied effort . 
[PER Cuesta  ] made clear that the question of additional [MISC Spanish  ] resources was one that would be decided personally by President [PER Zapatero  ] . 
[PER Cuesta  ] said a definitive [MISC Spanish  ] position was unlikely to be articulated before the [ORG NATO  ] Foreign Ministers' meeting in February . 
He stressed the importance of a high-level [LOC U.S.  ] approach to [LOC Spain  ] , suggesting the meeting FM [ORG Moratinos  ] was seeking with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] could be a key opportunity . 
On the elections , [PER Cuesta  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was looking at a financial contribution but noted that with the elections still months away , no decision was imminent . 
Agreement on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On the issue of [PER Chacon  ] 's suggestion that the [ORG ADC  ] be elevated to treaty status in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( ref a ) , [PER Cuesta  ] suggested [PER Chacon  ] had been cornered on the issue by the press . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] appreciated the difficulties of presenting the [ORG ADC  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senate  ] for approval , and looked forward to receiving the definitive [ORG USG  ] position on the matter . 
Without providing a comprehensive list , [PER Cuesta  ] repeated what he has told us before: [LOC Spain  ] will be looking merely for " improvements " to the [ORG ADC  ] . 
The examples he cited seem to concern issues arising from [MISC Spanish  ] military presence in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( drivers' licenses , dependents' health care , etc . 
) . 
Incident During Port Call in [LOC Barcelona  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During a January 22 port call in [LOC Barcelona  ] , a civilian crewmember of the [ORG USS Mount Whitney  ] was accosted by plain-clothes municipal police who did not adequately identify themselves and who pointed a gun at his shipmates ( ref b ) . 
During his arrest , the crewmember was knocked to the ground and later received several stitches to his head . 
That same evening he was released without being charged . 
There were suggestions the incident might have been racially motivated ( the crewmember was [MISC African-American  ] ) . 
The [ORG CDA  ] underscored the seriousness of this incident and its potential negative impact , if the [ORG GOS  ] did not take appropriate action. shared with [PER Cuesta  ] a note verbal sent to the MFA January 28 requesting an explanation of the incident . 
[PER Cuesta  ] expressed shock and promised to do what he could do see that the incident was properly investigated . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 00000113 002.2 OF 002 [ORG Gaza Arms Smuggling  ] ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Cuesta  ] said [LOC Spain  ] understood the importance of stopping arms smuggling into [LOC Gaza  ] and appreciated why this was part of the [MISC Israeli  ] bottom-line , but he doubted [LOC Spain  ] would be in a position to contribute military forces to the effort . 
Nevertheless , he said [LOC Spain  ] did want to be involved in discussions of the issue . 
( [ORG Note:  ] the [MISC Spanish  ] MFA Political Director told the [ORG CDA  ] January 23 that [LOC Spain  ] would attend the February 4-5 workshop in [LOC Denmark  ] . 
End note . 
) [MISC Guantanamo Flights  ] ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On the long-running saga of alleged [LOC U.S.  ] flights passing through [LOC Spain  ] carrying detainees to Guantanamo ( ref c ) , [PER Cuesta  ] said the judge hearing a related case in the [MISC Spanish National Court  ] was a " good man and serious professional . 
" [PER Cuesta  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] regarded the issue as a sideshow and hoped that with the news that the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] planned to close the detention facility , the story would eventually die away . 
In any case , the [ORG GOS  ] would stick to its position that the [LOC U.S.  ] had not broken any laws in [LOC Spain  ] and had complied with relevant bilateral agreements . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Cuesta  ] 's assertion that any additional [MISC Spanish  ] effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] will be personally approved by [PER Zapatero  ] is doubtless correct ( the matter is too controversial domestically for anyone else to take responsibility ) . 
Senior [ORG GOS  ] officials have repeatedly said [LOC Afghanistan  ] requires a new strategy . 
It will be important to them to be able to say to their voters that the [ORG GOS  ] has been consulted and its views have been heard . 
Having a senior [ORG USG  ] official reach out to them on [LOC Afghanistan  ] is important . 
In the meantime , engaging the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] would be useful . 
He is well-connected here . 
On the [ORG ADC  ] , this is not the first time [PER Cuesta  ] has seemed to downplay the [ORG MOD  ] 's suggestion that the [LOC U.S.  ] should elevate the agreement to the status of a [MISC Senate-approved  ] treaty . 
Although he described her comments as resulting from a press encounter gone wrong , in fact she repeated her statements to congress and in private with Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] , who undertook to provide her with a definitive [ORG USG  ] reaction .
