( C ) Summary: [MISC Dutch  ] opponents of the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) fired the opening salvo in their efforts to perusade Cabinet not to sign the [ORG JSF  ] follow-on [ORG MOU  ] by the end of the year . 
A member of the main opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) claimed [ORG Labor  ] would cancel a signed [ORG MOU  ] should [ORG Labor  ] come to power following the 2007 national elections . 
Meanwhile , the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] remains confident the [ORG MOU  ] will be signed -- assuming the [MISC Dutch  ] are allowed to participate in the operational test and evaluation phase . 
End summary . 
Opposition Tips Its Hand ? ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] press reported May 3 extensively on comments made by [ORG Labor  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) [ORG Defense Acquisitions  ] spokesperson [PER Luuk Blom  ] , who called on the [MISC Dutch  ] Cabinet not to sign the [ORG JSF  ] follow-on [ORG MOU  ] at the end of the year . 
[PER Blom  ] said during an interview in the [MISC Dutch  ] weekly " " [MISC Intermediair  ] " " that the [ORG Labor Party  ] did not want to inherit [ORG JSF  ] when it comes to power following the 2007 national elections . 
He said a [MISC Labor-dominated  ] government would cancel a signed [ORG MOU  ] -- " " not a single [ORG JSF  ] will be bought under [ORG Labor  ] . 
" " [PER Blom  ] argued that the [ORG JSF  ] business plan is " " based on quicksand , " " and that there was no guarantee that the [MISC Dutch  ] would see a return on their investment . 
He also said all contracts awarded to the [MISC Dutch  ] to date have been granted to [ORG Stork  ] , representing " " covert government support " " for a single company. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] newspaper " " [ORG Telegraaf  ] " " ( center-right ) carried an editorial May 3 arguing that the [ORG Labor Party  ] should " " come to its senses " " because [ORG JSF  ] is the best and cheapest option . 
According to [ORG Telegraaf  ] , canceling [ORG JSF  ] will cost the [MISC Dutch  ] hundreds of jobs and its international credibility . 
Instead , the [MISC Dutch  ] Cabinet should make a decision of [ORG JSF  ] in the fall . 
Government on Track ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador met with [ORG MOD  ] State Secretary [PER Cees van der Knaap  ] and [ORG MOD  ] Director for [MISC Defense  ] procurement [PER Dirk van Dord  ] May 2 . 
Also in attendance were [ORG MOD Advisor  ] to the State Secretary [PER Marleijn van Diepen  ] , and Office of [ORG Defense SIPDIS Cooperation  ] Chief COL [PER David Kelly  ] , [ORG LTC Ralph King  ] , and polmiloff [PER Jason Grubb.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] and [PER van Dord  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] remains positive on [ORG JSF  ] ; the defense procurement aspect of [ORG JSF  ] has been staffed at the [ORG MOD  ] working level . 
[PER Van Dord  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] Cabinet will soon become more involved in preparation for the planned [ORG JSF  ] follow-on [ORG MOU  ] signing at the end of the year . 
He noted that [LOC Norway  ] 's recent reservations may slightly complicate matters , as the [ORG GONL  ] will then be forced to explain to Cabinet why a [ORG JSF  ] partner chose to abandon the program . 
The ambassador noted that [LOC Norway  ] 's possible departure may result in more contracts for [MISC Dutch  ] industry , while COL [PER Kelly  ] said any departure might result in more expensive planes and questions of confidence. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] raised the [MISC Dutch  ] request to be included in the operational test and evaluation phase of [ORG JSF  ] , and noted [MISC Dutch  ] plans to buy three planes in advance for just such a reason . 
If the [MISC Dutch  ] cannot participate in the testing phase , then there is no reason to buy the advance planes -- or even make a purchase order for the rest , van der [PER Knaap  ] said . 
The ambassador noted the [MISC Dutch  ] position was clear . 
COL [PER Kelly  ] said [LOC Washington  ] principals were well aware of the [MISC Dutch  ] request , as indicated by a letter from [MISC Dutch  ] CHOD Gen. Berlijn to Gen. [PER Myers  ] . 
He added that [LOC Washington  ] was currently examining details that might allow the [MISC Dutch  ] to participate in the testing phase. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Van der Knaap  ] and [PER van Dord  ] also raised possible plans for a " " [MISC European  ] footprint " " through a [ORG JSF  ] sustainment and support center . 
They said the [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Italians  ] had agreed [LOC Italy  ] would provide the final assembly line for the aircraft built in [LOC Europe  ] , while the [LOC Netherlands  ] would be responsible for engine maintenance . 
[PER Van Dord  ] said [LOC Denmark  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Norway  ] have agreed to this approach , and were currently discussing further details . 
COL [PER Kelly  ] noted the [ORG JSF Executive Committee  ] in [LOC Oslo  ] in mid-May would present an ideal opportunity for the [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Italians  ] to present their proposal ; van [PER Dord  ] replied they were considering such a presentation. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) From the political side of things , van der [ORG Knaap  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] government already possessed a majority in Parliament to support the signing of the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] , despite the apparent opposition of the [ORG Labor Party  ] as made known by [PER Blom  ] 's comments . 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] said [ORG Labor  ] was " " crazy -- and crazy about [ORG JSF  ] " " and now seemed committed to making it an election issue . 
He said [ORG Labor  ] 's objections are purely political -- [ORG JSF  ] was the best plane for the best price , and would bolster [MISC Dutch  ] employment . 
As such , he had a difficult time believing [PER Blom  ] 's remarks represent [ORG Labor  ] 's true position . 
The ambassador said labor unions play a key role ; van der [ORG Knaap  ] agreed , and noted [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] VP [PER Tom Burbage  ] 's meeting with [MISC Dutch  ] labor unions on May 12 . 
The ambassador said he would attend the meeting. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The ambassador asked for van der [ORG Knaap  ] 's bottom line: was he worried , especially as [ORG Labor  ] appeared poised to control the government coalition following the elections in 2007 ? 
[PER Van der Knaap  ] said [ORG Labor  ] leaders had indicated during negotiations of the latest [MISC Balkenende  ] government that [ORG JSF  ] would not be an issue ; he still believes that is the case , and that recent [ORG Labor  ] opposition is nothing more than political posturing . 
He added that recent news of yet another contract award by [MISC Dutch  ] industry -- to be announced during [PER Burbage  ] 's meeting with union leaders -- would be very helpful in undermining critics who claim the [MISC Dutch  ] will not see a return on their investment . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Blom  ] 's remarks likely represent a trial-balloon from [ORG Labor  ] to determine if [ORG JSF  ] will play well in the elections -- it is hard to believe [PER Blom  ] 's bluster that [ORG Labor  ] would " " cancel " " an [ORG MOU  ] signed by the previous government , especially if [ORG Labor  ] looks to form a coalition with several parties from the current coalition . 
Nevertheless , we take [ORG Labor  ] 's opposition seriously -- if this is the hand they are playing , we will work on the labor unions to mitigate [ORG Labor  ] 's message . 
Meanwhile , the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] continues to proceed as though [ORG JSF  ] will happen -- as long as the [MISC Dutch  ] are included in the testing phase .
