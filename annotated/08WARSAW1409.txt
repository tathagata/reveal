( S ) SUMMARY: Like us , [LOC Poland  ] seeks to draw key countries on the eastern boundary of [LOC Europe  ] , like [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] , towards [MISC Western  ] institutions . 
An increasingly active regional player , [LOC Poland  ] has evolved since 1989 from aid-recipient to donor , helping us to spur reforms in the region . 
[LOC Warsaw  ] has lead [ORG EU  ] engagement with its eastern neighbors through the joint [ORG Polish-Swedish  ] [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] proposal , which was accelerated in the shadow of the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis and is now embedded in [ORG European Commission  ] strategy . 
Yet growing self-confidence and an historical distrust of [LOC Russia  ] can sometimes lead [LOC Poland  ] to get too far out in front -- like when the [MISC Poles  ] transferred sensitive armaments to [LOC Georgia  ] and took a gamble by pushing through the sudden removal of most [ORG EU  ] sanctions against [LOC Belarus  ] . 
Despite the occasional overstepping , [LOC Poland  ] 's [MISC Eastern Policy  ] is an excellent complement to our own , and projects like the [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] merit our support . 
END SUMMARY . 
STRATEGY BEHIND EASTERN [ORG PARTNERSHIP  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] -- a proposal championed by [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] to deepen [ORG EU  ] relations with [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Moldova  ] , [LOC Belarus  ] , [LOC Armenia  ] , and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] -- embraces the central goals of [LOC Poland  ] 's increasingly active regional policy: -- Counter [LOC Russia  ] 's influence in [ORG Eastern Europe  ] ( although [LOC Russia  ] is officially welcome to take part in the [ORG Partnership  ] ) ; -- Energize [ORG EU  ] engagement with eastern neighbors in the face of enlargement fatigue ; and -- Entice former [MISC Soviet  ] states to embrace [MISC Western  ] democratic and free-market principles by offering tangible benefits -- particularly a free trade area and eventual visa-free travel. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] and other [MISC Polish  ] policies in the region aim to counter a resurgent [LOC Russia  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Sikorski  ] told [LOC U.S.  ] officials the [ORG GoP  ] used to think [LOC Russia  ] would be a danger in 10-15 years , but after the [LOC Georgia  ] crisis , it could be as little as 10-15 months . 
[MISC Polish  ] analysts tell us having a pro-Western buffer zone in [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Belarus  ] would keep [LOC Poland  ] off the front line with an increasingly assertive [LOC Russia  ] . 
By offering former [MISC Soviet  ] republics the prospect of free trade and visa-free travel to the [ORG EU  ] , the [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] can spur the reforms needed for eventual [ORG EU  ] membership and stem growing [MISC Russian  ] influence . 
MFA officials note that the holder of a [MISC Russian  ] passport in [LOC Georgia  ] currently faces fewer travel restrictions in [LOC Europe  ] than a holder of a [MISC Georgian  ] passport . 
On the economic front , [MISC Polish  ] officials believe a larger western business presence in countries like [LOC Belarus  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] will provide an alternative to [MISC Russian  ] state-controlled companies , and [ORG EU  ] good governance programs can fight the corruption that facilitates [MISC Russian  ] political and economic influence. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Convinced that the [ORG EU  ] has greater leverage with [LOC Moscow  ] than do individual [MISC Member States  ] , the [ORG Tusk Government  ] has shed the confrontational rhetoric of its predecessor and sought to build coalitions among [ORG EU  ] members . 
Foreign Minister [PER Sikorski  ] developed the [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] with [MISC Swedish  ] FM [MISC Bildt  ] , and [MISC Polish  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] embassies in [ORG EU  ] capitals jointly lobbied other [MISC Member States  ] to support the package . 
[ORG EU  ] colleagues in [LOC Warsaw  ] praise the undertaking as a real coming of age for [LOC Poland  ] in the [ORG EU  ] . 
[ORG Tusk  ] has also striven to improve relations with [LOC Germany  ] , which the [MISC Polish  ] MFA hopes will bring more financial backing for the [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] . 
The Prime Minister struck a deal with [LOC Paris  ] in March 2008 to support [MISC French  ] proposals on the [ORG EU  ] 's southern dimension initiative in exchange for [LOC France  ] 's support for the [ORG Partnership.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Poland  ] itself has evolved from aid recipient to assistance provider , bilaterally allocating [MISC PLN  ] 26 million ( [MISC USD  ] 8.7 million ) to [LOC Belarus  ] and [MISC PLN  ] 16 million ( [MISC USD  ] 5.3 million ) to [LOC Ukraine  ] in 2008 . 
The aid will enhance independent broadcasting media , border cooperation , public administration , and people-to-people contacts . 
[LOC Poland  ] has also committed 6 million euro ( [MISC USD  ] 7.8 million ) to [LOC Georgia  ] for the period 2008-2010 . 
[PER Robert Tyszkiewicz  ] , the Deputy Chair of the [ORG Sejm  ] 's Foreign Relations Committee , described [LOC Poland  ] 's assistance as " modest , but useful and credible , because we struggled with many of the same post-Communist challenges . 
" MFA officials have called for a high-level strategic dialogue between [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Brussels  ] -- with [LOC WARSAW  ] 00001409 002 OF 003 [MISC Polish  ] participation -- on targeting assistance to eastern neighbors . 
STRENGTHENING THE NATIONAL SECURITY UMBRELLA -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) To complement increased [ORG EU  ] engagement , [LOC Warsaw  ] seeks to bolster the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] security stance in [ORG Eastern Europe  ] . 
[MISC Polish  ] officials perceive [LOC Russia  ] 's invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] in August as a vindication of their warnings about [LOC Moscow  ] , s aggressive behavior . 
According to the " [PER Sikorski Doctrine  ] , " any further attempt by [LOC Russia  ] to redraw borders by force or subversion should be regarded by [LOC Europe  ] as a threat to its security , entailing a proportional response by the entire [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] community . 
[LOC Poland  ] has pushed hard for [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] accession , and called on [ORG NATO  ] to make sure it can make good on [ORG Article V  ] guarantees . 
[PER Sikorski  ] has complained that [ORG NATO  ] has evolved into a political club with no teeth and warned that [LOC Poland  ] would not be able to ignore a repetition of the [LOC Georgia  ] scenario in [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
He has also told [LOC U.S.  ] officials that , in light of [MISC Russian  ] excesses in [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Poland  ] 's risky policy of arming the [MISC Georgians  ] with [MISC MANPADS  ] proved the right thing to do despite [ORG USG  ] objections ( Ref B ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Poland  ] 's perennial concerns about the adequacy of its Allies' security guarantees played a key role in the decision to sign the [MISC Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement  ] ( [ORG BMDA  ] ) with the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG GoP  ] wants [ORG US/NATO  ] boots ( and infrastructure ) on the ground so that the [LOC U.S.  ] will feel obliged to defend [LOC Poland  ] 's territorial sovereignty in the event of a conflict . 
Immediately after [LOC Russia  ] 's invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Tusk  ] emphasized [LOC Poland  ] 's sense of vulnerability when he asked high-level [LOC U.S.  ] officials , " Now do you see why we wanted the Patriot missiles and further security guarantees ( as requested during the [MISC Missile Defense  ] talks ) ? 
" RUSH TO REDUCE [LOC MINSK  ] SANCTIONS ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Polish  ] government -- lead by [PER Sikorski  ] -- pushed through the temporary repeal of almost all [ORG EU  ] visa sanctions against [MISC Belarusian  ] President [PER Lukashenka  ] 's regime , despite [ORG USG  ] calls for a more gradual easing of sanctions . 
[PER Sikorski  ] publicly suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] was engaging in double standards because of our close relations with a " dictatorship in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , but not in [LOC Belarus  ] . 
" Both [PER Sikorski  ] and [ORG Tusk  ] acknowledge that the [ORG GoP  ] risks being perceived as embracing a dictator ; but they argue that engaging [LOC Belarus  ] is particularly important after the [MISC Russian  ] invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister told [LOC U.S.  ] officials in August that [LOC Poland  ] is responding to [MISC Belarus'  ] signals of interest in dialogue , and , like the [LOC U.S.  ] , to the release of political prisoners in [LOC Belarus.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Tusk  ] and [PER Sikorski  ] see engagement with [MISC Belarusian  ] authorities as the lesser of two evils . 
In the [MISC Poles'  ] view , an isolated [LOC Belarus  ] could become completely ensnared by [LOC Russia  ] , with or without [PER Lukashenka  ] in power . 
[MISC Russian  ] domination would jeopardize democratic transformation and -- more importantly , in [LOC Warsaw  ] 's view -- would dash hopes that [LOC Belarus  ] could become a buffer state between [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [ORG GoP  ] is betting that [PER Lukashenka  ] enjoys enough power to resist the elimination of independent [MISC Belarusian  ] institutions and maintain his freedom of maneuver . 
MFA officials tell us that in response to the lifting of [ORG EU  ] visa sanctions , [LOC Belarus  ] has signaled [LOC Brussels  ] that [LOC Minsk  ] would ease some media restrictions . 
CHALLENGES AHEAD ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) MFA officials understand [LOC Poland  ] 's eastern policies could elicit a sharp [MISC Russian  ] reaction , but they see a greater danger in doing nothing since they believe a resurgent , aggressive [LOC Russia  ] is here to stay . 
[LOC Poland  ] has sought to mitigate the risk of a backlash by maintaining a cordial dialogue with [LOC Moscow  ] and pursuing a united [MISC US-EU  ] front vis-a-vis [LOC Russia  ] on sensitive energy and security issues . 
President [PER Lech Kaczynski  ] , the Prime Minister 's top political rival , takes a more confrontational approach to [LOC Russia  ] ; he often visits [LOC Georgia  ] and makes pronouncements there without coordinating with the government . 
To a certain extent , [PER Kaczynski  ] 's lurching east takes pressure off the [ORG Tusk Government  ] to be tough in public with [LOC Russia  ] , but the two leaders' divergent approaches could also hamper their ability to achieve the shared goal of extending [MISC European  ] and trans-Atlantic institutions eastward. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] competes for [ORG EU  ] financing with other projects , particularly the [ORG Union  ] 's [ORG Southern WARSAW  ] 00001409 003 OF 003 Initiative with [MISC Mediterranean  ] countries . 
The [ORG European Commission  ] 's [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] proposal included a request for 350 million euro in fresh funds for 2010-13 , which was much less than the 600 million euro sum originally proposed by [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] . 
In contrast to the [ORG Southern Initiative  ] , the [ORG Partnership  ] lacks a high-level special coordinator who can advocate on the program 's behalf within the [ORG EU  ] bureaucracy . 
[MISC Polish  ] MFA officials also point out that the success of the program depends on identifying and implementing credible projects . 
HELPING THE EASTERN [ORG PARTNERSHIP  ] SUCCEED --------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC Poland  ] can be a reliable ally as we looks for ways to enhance western influence beyond [ORG NATO  ] 's eastern borders . 
[MISC Russian  ] President [PER Medvedev  ] 's threat to deploy [MISC Iskander  ] missiles in [LOC Kaliningrad  ] in response to the [MISC Missile Defense  ] program has redoubled [MISC Polish  ] determination to work with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] to shore up its eastern neighbors as a bulwark against [MISC Russian  ] encroachment . 
It is also very much in our interest to work closely with [LOC Warsaw  ] , [LOC Brussels  ] , and the incoming [MISC Czech  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] presidencies to ensure the [ORG Partnership  ] 's success in enhancing [ORG EU  ] ties with its eastern neighborhood .
