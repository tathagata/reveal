End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG DCM  ] and [ORG Econoff  ] met with [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] Commissioner and [ORG Ministry of Fisheries  ] Director of [ORG International Affairs  ] [PER Stefan Asmundsson  ] and one of his deputies , [PER Hrefna Karlsdottir  ] on May 14 to deliver reftel points . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] cordially began the meeting by announcing that because [LOC Iceland  ] supports the sustainable use of whaling , they will support the [LOC U.S.  ] bowhead quota renewal provided that " we are talking about sustainable levels " and the [ORG Science Committee  ] supports it . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] stressed that it 's not just about the number of whales but the stock structure and said the worse case scenario would be perhaps not a five year block quota but a one or two year quota. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Asmundsson  ] stated he put the [LOC US  ] proposal in context with the [MISC Japanese  ] proposal . 
He said they were not directly linked , but that [LOC Iceland  ] would apply the same principles of sustainability to both . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] said the [MISC Japanese  ] had already been in to see him but that he would not support the proposal if it were " just x number of animals " ; he stressed that [LOC Iceland  ] only supported sustainable whaling and the [MISC Japanese  ] need to prove sustainability. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding a Revised Management Scheme , [PER Asmundsson  ] said he saw no indication that progress will be made . 
He mused that " if anyone has a good idea , we 'd love to see it " but feels that without a change in the present political situation nothing would happen . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] said efforts should be focused on getting political backing rather than working on a new compromise proposal. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Asmundsson  ] described the [ORG Conservation Committee  ] as " anti-use . 
" He said in principle [LOC Iceland  ] supports conservation but they have problems with the basis for the work of the committee . 
He said they tried to change the language of the committee 's establishment resolution and then worked for two years within the committee to try to change its basis . 
He said [LOC Iceland  ] can't take part now in the committee without a change in the committee 's foundation then back-tracked and said they had not made a final decision about whether they will ignore the committee or wait for positive noises. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Asmundsson  ] asked whether we expect there to be a resolution against current whaling operations and if so , would the [ORG USG  ] support it. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding [LOC Iceland  ] 's current commercial whaling operations , [PER Asmundsson  ] said there had been no decision on increasing the quota , but there was substantial interest in updating the existing whaling legislation that dates from the 1940s . 
He said the last of the 200 minke sample for the research program would be caught this summer and the data would be analyzed , but it was premature to close the door on the research program altogether . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] said should further information be needed then the program might continue and also added that no decision had been made on implementing the fin or sei whale portion of the original research plan announced in 2003 .
