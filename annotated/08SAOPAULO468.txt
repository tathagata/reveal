( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: In response to reftel , [PER Econoff  ] conducted three separate site visits and was able to confirm receipt of the parts by Foreign Consignee [ORG Embraer  ] . 
Site visits revealed that [ORG Embraer  ] 's license application contained erroneous information about consignee [ORG Darrigo & Valente Transportes  ] , [ORG Ltda.  ] , including incorrect company name and address . 
The site visits conducted on the basis of the request were insufficient to assess the operations and on-site security of [MISC Transportes Darrigo Ltda  ] , the company that actually receives and transports USML items for [ORG Embraer  ] . 
Following the site visits , [ORG Embraer  ] provided proof that parts were received . 
Post recommends that [ORG PM/DTCC  ] meet with [ORG Embraer  ] 's [ORG Senior Legal Counsel  ] , [PER Werner Buff Neto  ] , during the upcoming visit to [LOC Brazil  ] on September 24 , and conduct follow-up site visits to the locations where [MISC Transportes Darrigo Ltda  ] actually operates from . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On August 28 , 2008 [PER Econoff  ] conducted a site visit to [ORG Darrigo  ] E [PER Valente  ] Transportes , [PER Ltda  ] . 
( located at [LOC Rua Dublin  ] , 98 , [PER Vila Letonia  ] , [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [PER Campos  ] ; alias [ORG Darrigo &  ] [PER Valente  ] Transportes ) and spoke with the company Director , [PER Rafael Darrigo Valente  ] . 
[PER Econoff  ] conducted a subsequent site visit to [ORG DEX Logistica  ] ( located at [ORG Rua Oslo  ] , 187 , [PER Vila Letonia  ] , [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [PER Campos  ] , which is the address listed on the license application ) , but the Manager , [PER Carlos Sergio Martins  ] , was not available . 
[PER Econoff  ] subsequently visited foreign consignee [ORG Embraer  ] where she spoke with the company 's [ORG Senior Legal Counsel  ] , [PER Werner Buff Neto  ] , about the discrepancies in the license request. ----------------------------------------- SITE VISIT: [ORG DARRIGO  ] E [PER VALENTE  ] TRANSPORTES ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Darrigo  ] E [PER Valente  ] Transportes , [PER Ltda  ] . 
( [ORG Rua Dublin  ] , 98 , [PER Vila Letonia  ] ) claimed to have received no packages from the [LOC United States  ] nor delivered any packages to [ORG Embraer  ] in 2008 . 
According to Director [PER Rafael Darrigo Valente  ] , the company has been at the address [LOC Rua Dublin  ] , 98 since June 2004 . 
[PER Valente  ] produced and provided copies of contracts to back this claim . 
[PER Valente  ] rents the property from [MISC Portuguese  ] citizen [PER Manuel Fernando Duarte Pereira  ] for [MISC R$750/month  ] ( equivalent to $470 USD ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The facility has no identifying external sign , website or otherwise easily accessible contact information , and the Director 's business card does not include an address . 
Regarding security , the facility does not have an electronic security system or well-organized files . 
The company has one old computer , three administrative staff , and a few additional employees . 
[PER Econoff  ] did not observe any boxes or other material germane to a transportation company , save two small vans . 
[PER Valente  ] does not speak [MISC English.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Valente  ] claims to have worked as an outsourced contractor of [ORG Fedex  ] since 1990 for the city of [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [PER Campos  ] and surrounding municipalities . 
This relationship changed in 2002 when [ORG Fedex  ] consolidated contracts from twenty-two companies to three . 
The company that won the contract for the South-Southeast of [LOC Brazil  ] ( where [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [PER Campos  ] is located ) was [ORG Transportadora Americana  ] . 
At that time , [ORG Darrigo  ] E [PER Valente  ] Transportes was contracted via [ORG Transportadora Americana  ] to continue providing services for [ORG Fedex  ] . 
[PER Valente  ] claimed that during this time his company was co-located at [ORG Transportadora Americana  ] 's facilities . 
( [PER Note: Later  ] , [PER Valente  ] said his company was located at [ORG Rua Oslo  ] , 187 until 2004 . 
End Note ) In November 2007 , this relationship was terminated at [ORG Transportadora Americana  ] 's request . 
[PER Valente  ] explained that it was a cost-saving measure. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Valente  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that since November 2007 , the company works as an " Advance [ORG Fedex Shipping Center  ] " . 
[PER Valente  ] explained that this means that clients who do not have a corporate account with [ORG Fedex  ] can send and receive packages utilizing [ORG Darrigo  ] E [PER Valente  ] Transportes' account . 
[PER Econoff  ] observed a folder containing [ORG Fedex  ] shipping slips from 2008 and there appeared to be no more than a couple dozen such slips . 
The [ORG FedEx  ] website lists [ORG Darrigo &  ] [PER Valente  ] Transportes Ltda. as an authorized shipper. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Throughout the 60 minute conversation with [PER Econoff  ] , [PER Valente  ] appeared nervous , defensive , eager to control conversation , but cooperative . 
After speaking with [PER Econoff  ] for over an hour and insisting that his company has done no work for [ORG Embraer  ] in the past year , [PER Valente  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that he has a 'branch office' at [LOC Guarulhos International Airport  ] in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
The branch office is named " [MISC Transportes Darrigo Ltda  ] . 
" and they work exclusively with [ORG Embraer  ] . 
( Comment: [PER Econoff  ] was surprised that it took over an hour for this information to surface . 
[PER Econoff  ] was clear from the [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000468 002 OF 002 beginning that the shipment was for [ORG Embraer  ] . 
[PER Valente  ] had already told [PER Econoff  ] on several occasions that his company does not work for [ORG Embraer  ] . 
[ORG Embraer  ] later told [PER Econoff  ] that the company works for them out of [LOC Viracopos  ] airport in [LOC Campinas  ] . 
End comment ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Subsequent on-line research revealed that both [ORG Transportes Darrigo Ltda.  ] and [ORG Darrigo &  ] [PER Valente  ] Transportes are listed at the city 's chamber of commerce as located at the following address: [PER Rua Talim  ] , 55 . 
Jd . 
[LOC Aeroporto  ] . 
At no time did [PER Valente  ] indicate to [PER Econoff  ] that he had another facility in the neighborhood nor does this address appear in any of the rental contracts [PER Valente  ] produced . 
In a post-visit phone call , [PER Valente  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that [ORG Darrigo &  ] [PER Valente  ] Transportes no longer is located at the [LOC Rua Talim  ] address. ------------------------- SITE VISIT: [ORG DEX LOGISTICA  ] ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Valente  ] accompanied [PER Econoff  ] to [ORG DEX Logistica  ] , a shipping company located at [ORG Rua Oslo  ] , 187 , [PER Vila Letonia  ] , [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [PER Campos  ] , which is the address listed on the license application . 
[PER Valente  ] produced a rental contract for this facility , indicating that in 2004 he rented the facility to [LOC Porto Uniao  ] Representacoes E [ORG Comercio Ltda.  ] , a food distribution company . 
In 2007 , the facility was rented to [ORG DEX Transportes  ] E [ORG Logistica  ] , [ORG Ltda.  ] , a logistics and shipping company . 
Monthly rental is [MISC R$  ] 2500 ( $1,560 USD ) . 
The facility appeared bona fide , with forklifts , electronic security , website , and other material germane to a shipping company . 
[PER Valente  ] claims that relationship between [ORG Darrigo &  ] [PER Valente  ] Transportes and [ORG DEX  ] is strictly a rental relationship . 
( [PER Note: Econoff  ] did not have an opportunity to speak with the manager therefore this information was not confirmed . 
End Note . 
) ------------------------ [ORG EMBRAER  ] LEGAL DEPARTMENT ------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the site visit , [PER Econoff  ] met with [ORG Embraer  ] 's [ORG Senior Legal Counsel  ] and person responsible for export controls , [PER Werner Buff Neto  ] . 
[PER Econoff  ] indicated her concern about the lack of clarity with regards to both the company and address listed on the license application . 
[PER Buff  ] showed [PER Econoff  ] a copy of the purchase order and license application , together with [ORG Embraer  ] 's contract with [MISC Transportes Darrigo  ] [PER Ltda  ] . 
Following the visit , [PER Buff  ] furnished documents confirming receipt of parts . 
[PER Buff  ] told [PER Econoff  ] that [ORG Embraer  ] has an extensive relationship with [ORG Transportes Darrigo Ltda.  ] and that the company has been a reliable partner as an [ORG Embraer  ] freight forwarder , transporting goods between [ORG Embraer  ] sites . 
[PER Buff  ] provided [PER Econoff  ] a copy of the service contract , signed in April 2005 . 
The company 's listed address in the contract is [PER Rua Talim  ] , 55 and the contract was signed by [PER Luiz Guilherme Darrigo  ] , who is listed as the Director and President of the company . 
[MISC Transportes  ] [PER Darrigo Ltda  ] 's 1992 by-laws lists the following people as owners: [PER Luiz Guilherme Darrigo  ] and [PER Maria Auxiliadora  ] do [PER Prado Darrigo  ] . 
Nowhere in the dozens of pages of legal documents about the company is there mention of [ORG Darrigo  ] E [PER Valente Transportes  ] , [ORG Ltda.  ] , [PER Rafael Darrigo Valente  ] , the [ORG Rua Dublin  ] address , or the [ORG Rua Oslo  ] address. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the visit , [PER Buff  ] offered to look at the issue in more detail and indicated concern that their license application contained erroneous information . 
Following [PER Buff  ] 's investigation into the matter , he explained to [PER Econoff  ] that according to [ORG Embraer  ] 's files , [ORG Darrigo  ] E [PER Valente  ] Transportes is part of [MISC Transportes Darrigo  ] [PER Ltda  ] and does occasional work for [MISC Transportes Darrigo  ] [PER Ltda  ] as a subcontractor. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: In light of [LOC Brazil  ] 's onerous and complicated tax system , it is not unusual to find companies entangled in complex legal arrangements designed to avoid a heavy tax burden . 
The obscure relationship between [ORG Darrigo  ] E [PER Valente  ] Transportes and [MISC Transportes Darrigo  ] [PER Ltda  ] may be more of an indication of the difficulty of doing business in [LOC Brazil  ] than that the company is engaged in wrongdoing . 
The visit by PM/DTCC on September 24 for Blue Lantern training and outreach will give post an additional opportunity to look into this case while also explaining to the business community the exigencies of [LOC US  ] export controls related to [MISC USML  ] items . 
END COMMENT .
