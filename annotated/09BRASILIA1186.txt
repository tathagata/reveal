REF: A ) STATE 91633 , B ) [LOC BRASILIA  ] 1170 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
The [ORG Government of Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) is concerned about [LOC Iran  ] 's and [LOC Syria  ] 's nuclear activities and wants all parties to work with the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) to answer the outstanding questions . 
The [ORG GOB  ] does not see the latest [ORG IAEA  ] reports on these countries as closing those cases . 
Still , the [ORG GOB  ] is not supportive of the [LOC Iran  ] case being with the [ORG UN Security Council  ] or the idea of the [ORG UNSC  ] imposing additional sanctions . 
The [ORG GOB  ] strongly objects to the use of unilateral military action in the case of [LOC Syria  ] and is very concerned about the possibility of force being used against [LOC Iran  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On September 11 Science Counselor and Science Officer met with [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Acting Director of the [ORG Division for Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies  ] ( [ORG DDS  ] ) [PER Fabio Simao Alves  ] to discuss the [ORG USG  ] 's views - per REFTEL A - on the latest [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) reports on [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Alves  ] was well informed about both matters , and he reiterated the [ORG Government of Brazil  ] 's ( [ORG GOB  ] ) cautious approach to both cases . 
[LOC IRAN  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Alves  ] stressed that only through discussion can the dispute with [LOC Iran  ] be resolved . 
The [ORG GOB  ] is interested in learning the nature of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program and it does not rule out the possibility that the program has military aims . 
Thus , the [ORG GOB  ] is supportive of the [ORG IAEA  ] investigating the matter and getting answers . 
[PER Alves  ] stressed that the [ORG GOB  ] sees the [ORG IAEA  ] as the appropriate forum for dealing with [LOC Iran  ] and not the [ORG UN Security Council  ] ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) . 
The [ORG GOB  ] wants the [ORG IAEA  ] to become more active . 
Now that [LOC Brazil  ] is going back on the [ORG UNSC  ] it is particularly interested in the thinking of the [MISC P-5  ] plus [LOC Germany  ] about [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that [LOC Brazil  ] would not be supportive of the [ORG UNSC  ] imposing additional sanctions , but it will fully comply with measures adopted by the [ORG UNSC.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] would like [LOC Iran  ] to be more cooperative , he said . 
Then , he added that the [ORG GOB  ] would like unnamed " other member states " to share more information about [LOC Iran  ] with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
[PER Alves  ] appeared to be suggesting that there was a lack of sharing of information on [LOC Iran  ] and that this was somehow impeding the [ORG IAEA  ] 's efforts to understand the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] is " very concerned " about a possible military strike against [LOC Iran  ] by another state , emphasized [PER Alves  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] wants a peaceful solution to the [LOC Iran  ] question. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Alves  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] could not publicly support a call for [LOC Iran  ] to comply with an Additional Protocol . 
Since [LOC Brazil  ] has not signed up to an Additional Protocol , it will not support calls that other countries comply with them. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] had heard reports , [PER Alves  ] noted , that [MISC Iranians  ] were saying in [LOC Vienna  ] that [LOC Iran  ] should not be pressured so hard , but rather should be treated like [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has an enrichment program and it is not being put under a microscope or being compelled to sign/comply with an Additional Protocol . 
[PER Alves  ] seemed unhappy about these reports and emphasized that the [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] situations are quite different. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] at the [ORG IAEA  ] would have a balanced statement about [LOC Iran  ] , according to [PER Alves  ] . 
[LOC SYRIA  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] was not planning to make a statement about [LOC Syria  ] at the [ORG IAEA  ] , [PER Alves  ] said . 
He declared that the [ORG GOB  ] strongly condemned the use of force by a country against [LOC Syria  ] ; [LOC Brazil  ] viewed this as impairing the work of the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
Nonetheless , he acknowledged that there were outstanding questions about [LOC Syria  ] 's activities and these should be cleared up . 
He added that the [ORG GOB  ] has serious concerns about the [MISC Syrian  ] program and did not consider it a case closed. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As with the [LOC Iran  ] case , [PER Alves  ] wanted unnamed " other member states " to share their imagery and other intelligence about [LOC Syria  ] with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
He indicated that this unwillingness to share hindered the [ORG IAEA  ] 's efforts to understand the [MISC Syrian  ] activities . 
COMMENT <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] recognizes that there are serious questions outstanding about [LOC Iran  ] 's and [LOC Syria  ] 's nuclear activities and does not see these latest [ORG IAEA  ] reports as closing those cases . 
The [ORG GOB  ] , however , doesn't seem willing to go much further than calling for everyone to cooperate more with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
It strongly opposes unilateral military action and doesn't like the [LOC Iran  ] case being with the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] 's interest in the proposals and activities of the [MISC P-5  ] and [LOC Germany  ] is more that they want to be well-informed than an interest in trying to contribute to crafting new measures to pressure [LOC Iran  ] . 
We do see that the [ORG GOB  ] 's objection to an Additional Protocol for [LOC Brazil  ] is having an impact in the international arena , as the [ORG GOB  ] is unwilling to call [LOC Iran  ] on not complying with an Additional Protocol . 
END COMMENT .
