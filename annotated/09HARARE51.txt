08 [LOC HARARE  ] 1016 Classified By: Ambassador [PER James D. McGee  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( SBU ) In mid-January , a local chief in the diamond rich and violence-ridden [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] informed us of the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] military 's intention to displace as many as 25,000 villagers from their homes [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The military operation is intended to establish control over the diamond fields as well as to provide village-based housing to troops . 
The plan was temporarily delayed due to the discovery of gold ore in the region where the villagers were to be relocated . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------------------------------- Military Operation to Displace Thousands ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the local chief in the conflict-ridden [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] diamond fields of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , met with poloff to describe a military operation intended to displace the region 's 20,000 to 25,000 residents . 
He said that the military had informed them that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had been named a " government reserve area " and consequently , it was authorized to displace all the local residents in and around the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] diamond fields . 
He estimated that the area in question encompassed several hundred square kilometers , which is well in excess of the 70 hectare site currently being hand-panned. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Chief [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that the military 's plan had been to move the residents in mid-January from their villages to a site near the town of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , some 60 kilometers north [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has a farm in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] where the villagers would be placed . 
While the area is within the boundaries of the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] farm , the land was described by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] as " just rough bush . 
" The villagers were to be provided with tents for shelter , but no other accommodations were to be made for their benefit . 
However , the chief said that the plan was scuttled because an unnamed [MISC Russian  ] gold mining group with operations in the area informed the military that they had recently discovered gold at [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Consequently , the military is now seeking an alternate relocation site for the villagers. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also explained that the operation was motivated by both a desire to control the area and a need to provide housing for the military brigades currently stationed in the [LOC Marange  ] region . 
An independent NGO in the area , as well as the chief , reported that troops routinely force the local villages to provide them with food and shelter , while making residents dig for diamonds. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Chief [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is establishing a trust intended to raise funds for the legal defense and protection of displaced people in the area and sought our help in the endeavor. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The relocation of these villagers , if it occurs , is the next preparatory step in the [ORG GOZ  ] 's plan to use the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] diamond fields to bail out the failed [MISC Zimbabwean  ] [LOC HARARE  ] 00000051 002 OF 002 economy and prop-up the [PER Mugabe  ] patronage system ( reftels ) . 
While we are highly skeptical of the success of that scheme , what is certain is that it would result in additional suffering for [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] residents .
