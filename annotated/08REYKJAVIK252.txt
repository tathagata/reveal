1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During the October 24 visit of [ORG U.S. Treasury Department  ] Acting [PER DAS Eric Meyer  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] desk officer [PER Larry Norton  ] , the visiting [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] team in [ORG Reykjavik  ] announced it had reached an agreement with [MISC Icelandic  ] officials on a 2.1 billion USD loan deal . 
With this agreement on the table , the GOI focused its conversations with [ORG Treasury  ] on plans to move forward , including discussing the obstacles to floating the krona , and finding the additional cash loans to supplement the [ORG IMF  ] funds . 
The Prime Minister and Finance Minister traveled to [LOC Helsinki  ] on October 26 to meet with their counterparts to ask for additional funding . 
No [MISC Icelandic  ] official asked for [ORG USG  ] funding support . 
However , [PER DAS Meyer  ] indicated that [ORG USG  ] would support the [ORG IMF  ] deal within the [ORG IMF  ] . 
Several officials took the opportunity to complain about [MISC British  ] actions at the outset of the crisis ( including freezing the banks' [LOC U.K.  ] assets under an anti-terrorist law ) , with [ORG Central Bank Head  ] [PER David Oddsson  ] going to the extreme of comparing [PER Gordon Brown  ] to [PER Mussolini  ] . 
The [MISC Russian  ] loan still seems to be a possibility , but the [ORG IMF  ] deal has pushed this prospect to the back burner . 
Everyone acknowledged that the road ahead would be painful , but maintained a sense of cautious optimism . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor of the Board [PER David Oddsson  ] opened his meeting with the [ORG Treasury  ] visitors by asserting that the [ORG Financial Times  ] had misquoted him in saying he blamed the [ORG Fed  ] and other [ORG Central Banks  ] for the [MISC Icelandic  ] collapse ; he had said only that he was " disappointed in them . 
" He emphasized the need for a show of strength and predicted that the [ORG IMF  ] loan would be small and would be disbursed incrementally . 
[PER Oddsson  ] and Director of [ORG International Markets Sturla Palsson  ] warned of investors hedging " against us " and the need to show strong reserves so that " we can stand a speculative run against the [MISC Icelandic  ] krona . 
" [PER Palsson  ] said they were prepared to use a tight monetary policy and the priorities were to 1 ) create the new banks , 2 ) get the payment systems in order , and 3 ) get the bond market up and running . 
They were cautiously optimistic on the economic outlook , and [PER Palsson  ] asserted , " the time to normalcy will be shorter than the textbooks tell us . 
" He was confident the krona could be floated sooner than the [ORG IMF  ] estimate of six months to a year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Oddsson  ] was clearly bitter about the [LOC UK  ] 's freezing of [MISC Icelandic  ] assets and compared [PER Gordon Brown  ] 's actions to [PER Mussolini  ] 's [MISC Ethiopian  ] venture in 1935 in which a large country brought about the ruin of a defenseless small one . 
[PER Oddsson  ] said they were doing their utmost to respond to creditors in a " fair and open way " and cited the hiring of known specialists to ensure there is no favoritism . 
He said that the government 's new emergency law prioritizes depositors over other creditors and that the law lumps all depositors together ( retail and wholesale ) . 
[PER Oddsson  ] said that the [ORG EU Directive  ] on banking establishes a bank fund to serve as a guarantor of the deposits . 
This works well in a system in which hundreds of banks contribute , but obviously is not a good system when there are only three banks . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] bank fund isn't sufficient to guarantee the losses that have been incurred by the bankruptcy of the three [MISC Icelandic  ] banks . 
The legal question now is whether the state is the back-up institution when the bank fund is exhausted . 
The [LOC UK  ] argues yes , but [LOC Iceland  ] sees it completely differently . 
This is a question that must be settled in court . 
Regarding the bond holders , [PER Oddsson  ] said that creditors will be surprised when they receive much more than what is currently being traded . 
Both [PER Oddsson  ] and [PER Palsson  ] reiterated how important it is to restore trust in the system. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) At the [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority  ] ( [ORG FME  ] ) , Head of Foreign Operations Hlynur [PER Jonsson  ] gave a technical description of recent events . 
He said that the three new banks ( [ORG New Glitnir  ] , [ORG New Kaupthing  ] and [ORG New Landsbanki  ] ) had been formed from the [MISC Icelandic  ] deposits and internal business of the old banks ; the old banks would receive a bond , which would be evaluated by an international evaluator within 90 days , for the new banks . 
The state will have to capitalize the new banks with bonds issued by the old bank to cover the difference . 
[PER Jonsson  ] said they needed to liquidate the old banks without ruining [LOC Iceland  ] 's international reputation . 
[PER Jonsson  ] said the foreign operations were left in the old banks and are limited because of the authorities in various jurisdictions . 
He said the situation is most complex in the [LOC UK  ] and in [LOC Luxembourg  ] , " where huge repos with the [ORG European Central Bank  ] and the mother company owing subsidiaries might make it possible to save the subsidiaries . 
" [PER Jonsson  ] said that they are talking with their counterparts in other countries and that everything is going well except with the [LOC U.K.  ] When asked about the long term impact of what has happened , [PER Jonsson  ] and [PER Gudrun Jonsdottir  ] , Head of the [ORG Securities Market  ] , said they were still putting out fires and were not able to answer just yet. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Finance Minister [PER Arni Mathiesen  ] said the [ORG IMF  ] deal was not complicated ; its focus was on banking structures , monetary policy ( key to restoring some confidence in the currency ) and fiscal policy ( how the government manages the very high debt it will incur as a [LOC REYKJAVIK  ] 00000252 002 OF 002 result of the crisis . 
) [PER Mathiesen  ] said in his mind , there were no areas of disagreement . 
He said he would travel with the Prime Minister on October 26 to [LOC Helsinki  ] for two days of meetings with their [MISC Nordic  ] counterparts where they anticipate raising further funds . 
When asked whether [LOC Iceland  ] had approached the [ORG EU  ] , [PER Mathiesen  ] said he had talked to [MISC French  ] Finance Minister [PER Lagarde  ] and that it seems the [ORG EU  ] does not have a structure to tackle these kinds of financial problems and that the assistance would likely be in post-program . 
He said Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] and [PER Lagarde  ] may be coming to [LOC Iceland  ] at some point . 
He expected the krona to plunge when it is floated but hoped it would stabilize at more or less the current level ( 115 ISK to 1 [ORG USD  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Permanent Secretary of the Prime Minister 's Office , [PER Bolli Bollason  ] , said the formal decision to seek [ORG IMF  ] assistance had been approved in a [ORG Cabinet  ] meeting earlier in the day ( Oct. 24 . 
) [PER Bollason  ] understood the size of the [ORG IMF  ] package was unusual relative to [LOC Iceland  ] 's size ( as a percentage of [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG IMF  ] quota , the program will be bigger than most in [ORG IMF  ] history ) and said that it was fundamental to restore stability in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
He said that the main concern is passing the hurdle of floating the ISK . 
He said that the Prime Minister was preparing for the [MISC Nordic  ] Prime Ministerial meeting in [LOC Helsinki  ] on Monday with his [MISC Nordic  ] counterparts , to request funds or swap lines or both . 
Asked about how [LOC Iceland  ] would fill the 4 billion [ORG USD  ] gap between the [ORG IMF  ] funding and the purported 6 billion [ORG USD  ] necessary , [PER Bollason  ] said they asked [ORG Central Bank  ] Governor [PER Oddsson  ] to call his counterparts in the [MISC Nordics  ] and ask how far they are willing to go . 
[PER Bollason  ] said in his personal opinion , he didn't expect the [MISC Russians  ] to contribute money , that [LOC Iceland  ] had not been in contact with the [MISC Russians  ] since the [MISC Icelandic  ] team left [LOC Moscow  ] , but said " let 's see how things develop . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Director of the [ORG Institute of Economic Studies  ] at the University of [LOC Iceland  ] [PER Gunnar Haraldsson  ] told [PER Meyer  ] and [ORG Norton  ] that the repercussions of the crisis would be painful . 
He predicted inflation , mass layoffs , business bankruptcies , and a brain drain . 
He described the hardships that many Icelanders now face with their payments on foreign currency loans ( on their houses and cars ) resetting with the krona 's depreciation . 
He saw the [ORG IMF  ] as the only way out , and even with their help , it would be a rough 6 to 12 months ahead. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
