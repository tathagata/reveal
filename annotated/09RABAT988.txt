[LOC OUAGADOUGOU  ] 1158 [LOC RABAT  ] 00000988 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: DCM ROBERT P. JACKSON FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In separate meetings on December 16 with the [MISC Moroccan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Taieb Fassi Fihri  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the Mission learned that the health of wounded [MISC Guinean  ] junta leader Captain [PER Moussa Dadis Camara  ] has improved and that his release from the hospital may be imminent . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] told the Ambassador that the [ORG GOM  ] would keep [PER Dadis Camara  ] in [LOC Morocco  ] until the end of the month , while [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] outlined some of the reasons [PER Dadis  ] should not resume a role in [MISC Guinean  ] politics . 
Both described ethnic politics in [LOC Guinea  ] and the need for free and fair elections . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] noted as well that elections would not solve the problems because the army is so factionalized and ethnic conflict in [MISC Guinean  ] society is so prevalent . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a December 16 meeting with the Ambassador , [MISC Moroccan  ] Foreign Minister [PER Fassi Fihri  ] related that he had visited [PER Dadis Camara  ] on Wednesday , December 9 , and that he had been conscious but not coherent . 
[PER Dadis  ] arrived in a coma , and doctors removed bullet fragments from his skull . 
He continued to recover , according to [PER Fassi Fihri  ] , and was now able to speak . 
He has reportedly asked the [ORG GOM  ] to help him tape a five-minute television appearance for [MISC Guinean  ] television . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] stated that [PER Dadis  ] 's admission to [LOC Morocco  ] was a humanitarian gesture and that the [ORG GOM  ] would keep him in [LOC Morocco  ] until the end of December . 
The Minister noted as well that [LOC Libya  ] would be willing to accept [PER Dadis Camara.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Fassi Fihri  ] also said that the [MISC Guinean  ] Defense Minister , General [PER Sekouba Konate  ] , had told the [ORG GOM  ] that he wished to visit [LOC Morocco  ] to meet with [PER Dadis  ] , presumably to evaluate his ability to govern . 
The [ORG GOM  ] was likely to honor [PER Konate  ] 's request but only after the December 18 release of the report on the September massacre . 
However , [PER Fassi Fihri  ] also expressed pessimism about a [MISC Konate-led  ] government , calling the [PER Konate  ] a drunkard. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Also on December 16 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG PolOff  ] that [MISC Moroccan  ] doctors are expected imminently to release [PER Dadis Camara  ] from the hospital , but that there could be long-term health consequences from the failed December 3 shooting . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported that [MISC Moroccan  ] officials have not allowed him , [MISC Guinean  ] dignitaries , or the [MISC Guinean  ] Ambassador to visit [PER Dadis Camara  ] , but that he received regular medical updates from an unnamed [MISC Moroccan  ] source who was providing care for the junta leader at the [ORG Mohammed V Military Hospital  ] in [LOC Rabat  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Dadis  ] was alert but was not expected to return fully to his previous state of health. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described the " ethnicization " of [LOC Guinea  ] and the risk of conflict and violence like in [LOC Rwanda  ] . 
He stated that [PER Dadis Camara  ] has recruited mercenaries from [LOC South Africa  ] and [LOC Israel  ] and assembled them , along with some of his own men , in [LOC Forecariah  ] , in the ethnically [LOC Sussu  ] region in the west of the country , while [PER Dadis  ] was from the [LOC Forest  ] region to the east . 
His militia numbered 2,000-3,000 and wss armed with weapons from [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
The risk of conflict and destabilization threatened the entire region , he said. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] handed a handwritten document of unknown origin to [ORG PolOff  ] describing [PER Dadis  ] as a philandering , mentally unstable , heavy drinker and drug abuser given to delusions . 
The document also outlined a plan for the future of [LOC Guinea  ] , proposing that [MISC Guinean  ] Minister of [ORG National Defense  ] [PER Sekouba Konate  ] lead a ten-member civilian/military committee to restore order in the country , after which trade [LOC RABAT  ] 00000988 002.2 OF 002 unionist Dr. [PER Ibrahima Fofana  ] would serve as transitional president for six months until presidential elections were held. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Fassi Fihri  ] , s discussion of [LOC Guinea  ] contrasted sharply with his much more emotional , less objective discussion of [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
In any case , with [PER Dadis Camara  ] evidently recovering and the [ORG GOM  ] agreeing to keep him in [LOC Morocco  ] only until the end of December , the situation in [LOC Guinea  ] could become more complicated unless the international community can persuade [PER Konate  ] and the [ORG Economic Community of West African States  ] to act quickly . 
End comment. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
