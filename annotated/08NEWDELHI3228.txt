( C ) [MISC Summary: On  ] the floor of parliament , [MISC Indian  ] Home Minister [PER P. Chidambaram  ] officially dismissed comments made by the [ORG Minority Affairs Minister  ] [PER A.R. Antulay  ] that implied [MISC Hindutva  ] elements may have been involved in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
[PER Antulay  ] sparked a political controversy on December 17 with comments insinuating that the killing of [ORG Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad  ] ( [ORG ATS  ] ) Chief [PER Hemant Karkare  ] by the [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorists was somehow linked to Karkare’s investigation of bombings in which radical [MISC Hindus  ] are suspected ( reftel ) . 
The outlandish comments suggested that somehow [MISC Hindutva  ] elements were in league with the [LOC Mumbai  ] attackers , or used the attacks as cover to kill [PER Karkare  ] . 
The opposition [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) immediately called for [PER Antulay’s  ] resignation and protested with boisterous walkouts in parliament over the course of five days . 
Compounding matters , the [ORG Congress Party  ] , after first distancing itself from the comments , two days later issued a contradictory statement which implicitly endorsed the conspiracy . 
During this time , [PER Antulay’s  ] completely unsubstantiated claims gained support in the conspiracy-minded [MISC Indian-Muslim  ] community . 
Hoping to foster that support for upcoming national elections , the [ORG Congress Party  ] cynically pulled back from its original dismissal and lent credence to the conspiracy . 
Regardless of Chidambaram’s dismissal ( and [PER Antulay’s  ] party-ordered retraction ) , the [MISC Indian Muslim  ] community will continue to believe they are unfairly targeted by law enforcement and that those who investigate the truth are silenced . 
The entire episode demonstrates that the [ORG Congress Party  ] will readily stoop to the old caste/religious-based politics if it feels it is in its interest . 
End Summary . 
Killed in [LOC Mumbai  ] Attacks , [PER Karkare  ] Led Investigation into “Hindu Terror” --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Indian  ] Minorities Affairs Minister [PER A.R. Antulay’s  ] sparked controversy on December 17 with comments insinuating that the killing of [ORG Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad  ] ( [ORG ATS  ] ) Chief [PER Hemant Karkare  ] by the [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorists was somehow linked to Karkare’s investigation of “Hindu terrorists.” Two of the [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorists gunned down [PER Karkare  ] , and his [ORG ATS  ] colleagues Additional Commissioner of Police [PER Ashok Kamte  ] and Inspector [PER Vijay Salaskar  ] the first night of attacks , November 26 . 
The three officers were killed as they reached a hospital the terrorists entered after attacking the [LOC Mumbai  ] train station. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As [ORG Maharashtra  ] ATS Chief , [PER Karkare  ] led the investigation into the September 2008 Malegaon blasts which claimed the lives of six people . 
Initially the police suspected [MISC Muslim  ] terrorists . 
However , authorities recently arrested eleven [MISC Hindus  ] , including an [MISC Indian  ] Army Lieutenant Colonel . 
Police identified five of those arrested as having ties to the BJP’s youth wing in their earlier years . 
Two others had ties to a recent addition to the [MISC Sangh Parivar  ] family of [MISC Hindu  ] nationalist organizations . 
[PER Antulay’s  ] Comments ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On December 17 , even as a solemn debate on the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks and counterterrorism was taking place in parliament , [PER Antulay  ] made a series of public comments drawing attention to a possible link between Karkare’s killing and his investigation . 
He offered no evidence to back-up his claims. -- “Superficially speaking they had no reason to kill [PER Karkare  ] . 
Whether he was a victim of terrorism or terrorism plus something , I do not know.” -- “Karkare found that there are non [MISC Muslims  ] involved in the NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003228 002 OF 002 acts of terrorism during his investigations in some cases . 
Any person going to the roots of terrorism has always been the target.” -- “Unfortunately his end came . 
It may be a separate inquiry how his end came.” -- “There is more than what meets the eyes.” [ORG Congress Party  ] Dismisses... --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Most Congress Party  ] leaders quickly disassociated the [ORG Party from Atulay’s  ] comments . 
[ORG Congress Party  ] spokesman [PER Abishek Singhvi  ] told the press , “We do not accept the innuendo and the aspersions cast . 
This should be the end of the matter . 
The [ORG Congress  ] does not agree with [PER Antulay’s  ] statement.” Another [ORG Congress Party  ] spokesman , [PER Manish Tiwari  ] , followed the next day with , “The [ORG Congress  ] in any manner does not endorse [PER Antulay’s  ] views.” Just as quickly [ORG BJP  ] leaders called for [PER Antulay  ] to resign or be sacked. ...Then Equivocates... ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) However , on December 21 senior [ORG Congress  ] leader [PER Digvijay Singh  ] told the media , “I don’t think [PER Antulay  ] made a mistake . 
What he asked for is a probe . 
What is objectionable in his statement ? ” Two days earlier the [MISC Congress-led  ] government of [ORG Maharashtra  ] rejected a demand for an inquiry into Karkare’s death . 
The opposition [ORG BJP  ] took exception to both the substance of [PER Antulay’s  ] comments and the [ORG Congress Party’s  ] inconsistent response . 
Shouting slogans , the [ORG BJP  ] staged a walkout in the parliament three days in a row and demanded a formal clarification from the government . 
Emboldened by the equivocation , [PER Antulay  ] refused to apologize or retract his statements and said they reflected the views of a large segment of the [MISC Muslim  ] population. ...And Finally Dismisses ------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) After taking flack for nearly a week , the [ORG Congress Party  ] finally gave its official view when Home Minister [PER Chidambaram  ] stated in parliament , “There is no truth whatsoever in the suspicion that there was conspiracy.” [PER Chidambaram  ] called [PER Antulay’s  ] comments “regrettable.” Shortly thereafter [PER Antulay  ] backed down and told the press , “For me the matter is settled.” He ruled out his resignation . 
[ORG Congress Party Plays Cynical Politics  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: While the killing of three high level law enforcement officers during the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks is a remarkable coincidence , the [ORG Congress Party’s  ] initial reaction to [PER Antulay’s  ] outrageous comments was correct . 
But as support seemed to swell among [MISC Muslims  ] for [PER Antulay’s  ] unsubstantiated claims , crass political opportunism swayed the thinking of some [ORG Congress Party  ] leaders . 
What’s more , the party made the cynical political calculation to lend credence to the conspiracy even after its recent emboldening state elections victories . 
The party chose to pander to [MISC Muslims’  ] fears , providing impetus for those in the [MISC Muslim  ] community who will continue to play up the conspiracy theory . 
While cooler heads eventually prevailed within the [ORG Congress  ] leadership , the idea that the party would entertain such outlandish claims proved once again that many party leaders are still wedded to the old identity politics . 
The seventy-nine year old [PER Antulay  ] was probably bewildered to find that his remarks , similar in vein to what he would have routinely made in the past to attack the [ORG BJP  ] , created such a furor this time .
