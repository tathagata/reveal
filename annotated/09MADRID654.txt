( C ) Summary: President [PER Zapatero  ] 's main worry at present is [LOC Spain  ] 's faltering economy . 
The unemployment rate is over 18% and is headed for 20% . 
The perception that the economy is shedding jobs and that [PER Zapatero  ] does not know how to stop it has begun to take a political toll on his administration . 
In effect , jobs have become the line in the sand for this President: if he cannot convince the public that the unemployment news will improve in the medium term , his political base will begin to erode at an ever-increasing rate . 
The recession is expected to last longer than elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] , and the ruling party has suffered at the polls and in the legislature . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has engaged in aggressive fiscal stimulus but must soon cut spending and increase taxes to head back towards the [ORG EU  ] 's deficit limit . 
The banking sector has been relatively healthy so far , but delinquency rates are rising and the [ORG GOS  ] just established a rescue fund to help it deal with an expected wave of troubled institutions . 
The [ORG GOS  ] does not face any more elections until [LOC Catalonian  ] regional elections late next year , and the opposition 's own problems have prevented it from taking more advantage . 
Nonetheless , the economy is expected to make the second half of 2010 uncomfortable for [PER Zapatero  ] and his government . 
End Summary . 
Unemployment Rising , GDP Falling -------------------------------- 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Zapatero  ] is facing sustained economic difficulties made even more unpleasant by the contrast with occasional encouraging signs in the [LOC U.S.  ] and elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] . 
The worst of his problems is the unemployment rate , which at over 18% is the [ORG EU  ] , s highest . 
The rate is expected to top 20% later this year or early in 2010 . 
While [LOC Spain  ] 's unemployment benefits are more generous than those in the [LOC U.S.  ] and last for up to two years , benefits for those who lost their jobs at the start of the slowdown will soon begin to run out . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's troubles began before those of much of [LOC Europe  ] when its housing boom lost steam in 2007 , and its recession is expected to last longer than those in most of [LOC Europe  ] . 
Many non-GOS observers do not expect growth to resume until 2011 . 
Inaccurate Optimism and Political Consequences --------------------------------------------- - 3 . 
( C ) Since the slowdown began , [PER Zapatero  ] and his ministers ( with the occasional exception of the now-departed [PER Pedro Solbes  ] ) have consistently put optimistic spins on macroeconomic prospects . 
This tendency was most pronounced in the runup to the March 2008 elections but has continued since then , perhaps affected by [PER Zapatero  ] 's apparent focus on the importance of consumer and investor confidence in sustaining economic activity . 
For almost two years now , every [ORG GOS  ] economic growth prediction has proven overly optimistic and has soon been followed by less upbeat predictions from outside analysts . 
While the crisis has proven worse than almost anyone inside or outside government had expected , press reports suggest that this track record and [PER Zapatero  ] 's continued expressions of optimism may have hurt his credibility . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] lost seats in this month 's [MISC European  ] Parliament elections and lost control of [ORG Galicia  ] 's regional government in April elections . 
Even its good showing in the April [MISC Basque  ] regional elections has complicated matters . 
The [MISC Basque  ] chapters of the [ORG PSOE  ] and the conservative opposition [ORG PP  ] formed a coalition to take control of the regional government , the first time in the democratic era that the [ORG Basque Nationalist Party  ] ( [ORG PNV  ] ) did not control the government . 
In response , the [ORG PNV  ] has stopped voting with the [ORG PSOE  ] in the national legislature , forcing the [ORG PSOE  ] into a difficult search for support from other small parties each time it hopes to get legislation passed . 
Clearly [PER Zapatero  ] realizes the political danger he is in . 
Every job lost is another small nail in his coffin . 
When he met with visiting Transportation Secretary [PER LaHood  ] in May , [PER Zapatero  ] emphasized the importance of keeping open [ORG Opel  ] 's plant in [LOC Zaragoza  ] after the impending sale of [ORG Opel  ] and asked the Secretary for help conveying that message to [ORG GM  ] . 
At some point , [PER Zapatero  ] may face the unhappy prospect of ballooning the budget deficit to extend unemployment benefits . 
It will be a " damned if you do , damned if you don't " choice , since the opposition parties will excoriate him either way . 
[ORG MADRID  ] 00000654 002.2 OF 002 Budget To Bring More Headaches ------------------------------ 4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When the economy began slowing in 2007 , the [ORG GOS  ] had a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio of below 40% . 
That gave it room to respond with aggressive fiscal stimulus , through increased spending and tax cuts ( along with the automatic stimuli of more unemployment benefit spending and lower tax revenues ) . 
This year 's deficit is expected to approach 10% of GDP . 
However , the [ORG GOS  ] will need to start to reduce its deficit if it is to reach the [ORG EU  ] limit of 3% by 2012 . 
Even if the [LOC GOS'  ] growth predictions are accurate , it expects to need to reduce nonfinancial spending by 4.5% in 2010 , which will force difficult and unpopular choices . 
On the revenue side , the [ORG GOS  ] earlier this month hiked cigarette and fuel taxes and is said to face competing pressures from different parties to raise either the value-added tax or income taxes for 2010 . 
To top it off , the [ORG GOS  ] still has not been able to reach agreement with regional governments in a longrunning dispute over regional financing issues . 
Worries over [ORG Banking Sector  ] --------------------------- 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While conservative central bank regulation helped [MISC Spanish  ] banks avoid the financial turmoil that hit much of the continent last year , the construction slump and overall economic slowdown have boosted delinquency rates . 
Banks and especially savings banks ( " cajas " ) are expected to face increasing difficulty over the next year as delinquency rates continue to rise . 
The [ORG GOS  ] last week established a rescue fund to help it encourage mergers and intervene in troubled institutions as needed ( reftel ) . 
However , the restructuring that is expected to result is likely to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs in what is a relatively overbanked country . 
6 . 
( C ) Despite the gloomy outlook , [PER Zapatero  ] does have a couple of things going for him . 
There are no national elections until 2012 and no regional elections until [LOC Catalonia  ] 's in late 2010 . 
Also , the opposition [ORG PP  ] has been hurt by scandals and infighting and has not presented an attractive alternative . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency in the first half of 2010 will give [PER Zapatero  ] a chance to be more of a player on the international stage , but the economy is likely to make for uncomfortable times between now and then .
