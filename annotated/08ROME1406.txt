Spogli  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
The political conditions in [LOC Italy  ] are dramatically different from the conditions that existed when you last visited in July 2006 . 
[PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] has returned to power after two years of a divided and ineffectual [ORG Prodi  ] government . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] enjoys unparalleled levels of public support and his broad base of power has allowed us to make good progress in advancing our agenda , including successfully pressing for significant reductions on caveats imposed on [MISC Italian  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] by the previous government and approval of a major and crucial base expansion at [LOC Vicenza  ] . 
During your visit , I hope you can publicly announce the establishment of [LOC AFRICOM  ] , s [ORG Army  ] and [ORG Navy  ] subcomponent commands in [LOC Italy  ] , an important symbol of the strength of our close bilateral security relationship. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Our reenergized cooperation with [PER Berlusconi  ] , however , does not extend to all issues . 
Berlusconi’s close , personal relationship with [PER Putin  ] has translated into [MISC Italian  ] support for nearly every [MISC Russian  ] initiative intended to weaken transatlantic support for [ORG NATO  ] expansion and our efforts to curb the [MISC Kremlin’s  ] worst instincts . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , after a period of [MISC Italian  ] support for [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] efforts to resolve the nuclear issue , Italy’s policy has become unfocused and even critical of the international process . 
I hope you can let [PER Berlusconi  ] know that Italy’s renegade initiatives to soften international and transatlantic positions on [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] can only serve to create confusion and reduce collective security . 
On the economic front , Italy’s banks have avoided the worst of the financial meltdown , but the broader economy will suffer from the ensuing global economic slow-down . 
End Summary . 
Domestic Politics: [PER Berlusconi  ] Firmly in Control - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] is in an enviable position domestically , enjoying so comfortable a majority in Parliament that he can pass virtually any legislation without the support of the opposition . 
He used his first months back in government to deliver results on election promises , though long-term solutions to most problems are still needed . 
The trash problem in [LOC Naples  ] is not yet permanently solved , but the streets are cleared and troops are keeping dumps and incinerators open . 
Public worries about street crime have been addressed by a sweeping new security law . 
A public finance law has overhauled the annual budget process , which traditionally has eaten up months of Parliament’s time , but Italy’s faltering economy casts doubt on whether budget targets will be met . 
Berlusconi’s government drafted and passed these laws mostly without consulting the center-left opposition , which has grown more fragmented and less effective . 
Most foreign policy initiatives will be directed by [PER Berlusconi  ] personally without the need of any legislation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] has made a few missteps , such as his awkward attempt at a joke , in referring to President-Elect [PER Obama  ] as “suntanned” , and center-left contacts argue that the honeymoon period may end soon . 
Clearly Berlusconi’s current level of popularity is unsustainable over the long run , but predictions that the wind is changing already are premature . 
The center right’s first major electoral test will be the [MISC European  ] elections in June , which will be a critical moment for the center left to evaluate whether it needs new leadership and for the center right to see if it continues to enjoy such high levels of approval from the [MISC Italian  ] people . 
Transatlantic Relationship: All [LOC Russia  ] All the Time - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Berlusconi’s close personal ( and , some suspect , financial ) relationship with [PER Putin  ] has led him to champion unquestioningly every initiative the [LOC Kremlin  ] has rolled out . 
Italy’s [LOC Russia  ] policy is his personal game , one which he conducts on a tactical basis to gain the trust and favor of his [MISC Russian  ] interlocutors . 
He consistently rejects the strategic advice of his demoralized , resource-starved , and increasingly irrelevant [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] in favor of his business cronies , many of whom are deeply dug into Russia’s [LOC ROME  ] 00001406 002.2 OF 003 [MISC European  ] energy strategy . 
As a result of his short-sighted obsession with [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Berlusconi  ] has thrown his support behind [ORG Medvedev’s  ] calls for a new security architecture in [LOC Europe  ] to supersede [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG OSCE  ] , has publicly called for [MISC Ukrainian  ] and [MISC Georgian  ] [ORG NATO  ] aspirations to be put on hold in deference to [MISC Russian  ] sensitivities , has called on President-Elect [PER Obama  ] to withdraw support for [LOC Missile Defense  ] , and continues to insist that [LOC Russia  ] acted properly during the [LOC Georgia-Russia  ] conflict . 
He has even called on the [ORG EU  ] to admit [LOC Russia  ] as a member . 
Most disturbingly , [PER Berlusconi  ] has attempted to portray himself inside the [ORG EU  ] as the bridge between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
In practice , this has meant that the [ORG GOI  ] has consistently worked to water down [ORG EU  ] stances on [LOC Russia  ] , and tried to derail [MISC U.S.-led  ] efforts to contain Moscow’s worst instincts . 
His efforts to encourage greater “dialogue” have created more confusion between [LOC Russia  ] and the transatlantic community , not less . 
We have pushed back forcefully on this ( ref a ) but you can provide a sense of realism to [PER Berlusconi  ] by letting him know that his efforts are working against [LOC U.S.  ] and transatlantic efforts . 
Muddying the Waters on [LOC Iran  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] came into power with a tough public stance on [LOC Iran  ] and showed himself eager to support the [ORG P5-plus-1  ] . 
This initial clarity has given way to an unfocused , even critical policy with respect to building international consensus for further sanctions . 
FM [PER Frattini  ] recently questioned the efficacy of the [ORG P5  ] 1 approach in public comments , and reached out to [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear negotiator , [PER Saeed Jalili  ] , to invite him to [LOC Rome  ] for consultations . 
Even while working within the [ORG EU  ] framework to discuss further national measures , working-level [ORG GOI  ] officials continue to question the efficacy of further sanctions . 
Economic Crisis: Banks [LOC OK  ] , but economy suffers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Stodgy , old fashioned banking practices allowed [LOC Italy  ] to avoid being directly hit by the global financial melt-down . 
[MISC Italian  ] banks simply did not engage in the kind of sub-prime lending that got others in trouble , and [MISC Italian  ] banks did not buy significant amounts of the toxic derivatives that are causing so much trouble around the globe . 
But [LOC Italy  ] is being affected by the results of the financial crisis: [MISC Italian  ] stock prices have plummeted , stirring fears of possible foreign buy-outs of [MISC Italian  ] firms , and Italy’s already shaky economy will be hard-hit by the global recession that was sparked by the financial crisis . 
As for Italy’s preferred response to the crisis , the [MISC Italians  ] seem to be following [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] lead , and seem to share his enthusiasm for major reform of the international finance institutions . 
As is the case in many other countries , [LOC Italy  ] is also looking at the possibility of government support for industries hurt by the recession. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Italy’s Finance Minister , [PER Giulio Tremonti  ] , often supports protectionist , anti-globalization positions , but in the ongoing discussion of the financial crisis we expect [LOC Italy  ] to adhere to the more moderate consensus policies hammered out by the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Little Room  ] for Expanding Presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Italy  ] is the sixth-largest contributor to [ORG ISAF  ] with 2,200 troops , a [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Herat  ] , and command of [LOC RC-West  ] . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] has made good on his pledge to President [PER Bush  ] last June to remove geographic caveats and send 34 Carabinieri to train [MISC Afghan  ] police , and he has promised to address allegations of [MISC Italian  ] protection payments to insurgent leaders . 
Additionally , FM [MISC Frattini  ] has announced his intention to host a [ORG G8 Ministerial  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] with a special focus on providing a regional solution to the [MISC Afghan-Pakistan  ] border region . 
But the [MISC Italians  ] now say that new troop deployments above the [MISC Parliamentary-approved  ] cap of 2,300 troops will be impossible for budgetary reasons , and that its only new contribution to [ORG ISAF  ] this fall will be in the form of four [MISC Tornado  ] jet fighters . 
[LOC Italy  ] has also been cool toward our requests to provide donor support to [ORG ANA  ] expansion and election preparation , citing budgetary [LOC ROME  ] 00001406 003.4 OF 003 concerns . 
You should stress that Italy’s decision to reduce defense expenditures ( which will put them even further below the [MISC NATO-recommended  ] threshold of 1% of GDP ) is of major concern to us , and it risks making [LOC Italy  ] a less reliable partner in international security operations , just at a point when the need for greater contributions from partners may grow in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Rolling out [LOC AFRICOM  ] - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Your visit will provide an opportunity to highlight our cooperation on [LOC Africa  ] through Italy’s hosting of portions of [LOC AFRICOM  ] . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials were initially hesitant to sign off , due to concerns over how and under what circumstances [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Italy  ] might deploy to potential conflict zones in [LOC Africa  ] . 
The [ORG GoI  ] eventually agreed to the establishment of [ORG AFRICOM’s Army  ] and [ORG Navy  ] subcomponent commands in existing facilities in [LOC Italy  ] on October 1 , but asked us to delay announcing the move ( ref b ) . 
The [LOC South East Europe Task Force  ] ( [ORG SETAF  ] ) in [LOC Vicenza  ] has assumed the [ORG Army  ] component functions and a component of [ORG NAVEUR  ] in [LOC Naples  ] is now fulfilling the naval functions . 
[MISC Italian  ] concerns focused on [ORG SETAF  ] and hinged on two issues -- one legal and the other local and political . 
The classified 1954 Bilateral [ORG Infrastructure Agreement  ] ( [ORG BIA  ] ) limits [LOC U.S.  ] basing in [LOC Italy  ] exclusively to troops deployed for [ORG NATO  ] purposes . 
After long negotiations , the [ORG GOI  ] accepted our broad interpretation of the [ORG BIA  ] and the [ORG NATO  ] SOFA as applicable to the [LOC AFRICOM  ] subcomponents due to their role in supporting [ORG NATO  ] Operations in [LOC Africa  ] and their availability for other [ORG NATO  ] missions as required . 
But the [ORG GOI  ] asked for us to delay public announcement of the shift due to local controversy over the expansion of the base in [LOC Vicenza  ] to the [PER Dal Molin  ] airfield. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOI  ] responded positively to our proposal for a joint announcement of the shift during your visit to [LOC Italy  ] . 
A joint statement acknowledging the establishment of the two entities would allow us to highlight the security assistance and humanitarian aspects of [MISC AFRICOM’s  ] mission and also divorce the issue as much as possible from base expansion controversy in [LOC Vicenza  ] . 
It will also provide an opportunity to showcase the synergies between [LOC AFRICOM  ] and the GOI’s own efforts to encourage stability in [LOC Africa  ] and also their excellent work at training primarily [MISC African  ] peacekeepers through its [ORG Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units  ] ( [ORG COESPU  ] ) , a joint [MISC U.S.-Italian  ] G8 initiative which is also located in [LOC Vicenza  ] . 
When Will the [MISC Honeymoon End  ] ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Most of our contacts within [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] own party as well as in the center left expect this government’s honeymoon period to end in the first half of 2009 , as [MISC Italians  ] focus on the nation’s systemic problems that have no easy solution , most importantly the economy . 
[ORG Democratic Party  ] officials tell us that they see the declining standard of living among the middle class as the greatest opportunity to gain strength before the [MISC European  ] elections in June . 
Should the rescue efforts for [ORG Alitalia  ] remain unresolved in the face of continued strikes or should the protests against education reform gain traction with a broader segment of the electorate , [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] popularity will suffer . 
Conclusion - - - - - - <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] shoot-from-the-hip style and frequent gaffes frequently create bumps in the relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] Nevertheless , he staunchly supports and admires the [LOC U.S.  ] and its people . 
Despite its economic malaise , [LOC Italy  ] remains a close and influential partner and will continue to be an important ally for the [LOC U.S.  ] in [ORG NATO  ] , the region and the world . 
Your visit will be an important sign of the strength and closeness of the bilateral relationship and I am delighted that you are taking the opportunity to visit [LOC Rome  ] .
