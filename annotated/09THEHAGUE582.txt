Mann  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] supports the [LOC U.S.  ] position on the [PER Goldstone  ] report , but some members in the [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] will try to pressure FM [PER Verhagen  ] to take a more skeptical approach toward [LOC Israel  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] intimated there is a split on [LOC Israel  ] policy between FM [PER Verhagen  ] and Development Minister [ORG Koenders  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Post delivered reftel points to key [ORG MFA  ] contacts , and the PolEcon Counselor and Pol Deputy met September 24 with Mr. [PER Henne Schuwer  ] , newly arrived Director of the [LOC North Africa  ] and [LOC Middle East Department  ] . 
[PER Schuwer  ] stated we're in the same place . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] want to maintain the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] ( [ORG HRC  ] ) focus on the report , rather than referring it to [LOC New York  ] . 
We should let the parties comment on the report , said [PER Schuwer  ] , we don't need to rush . 
[PER Schuwer  ] further agreed that the mandate of the report was flawed , and that the report is too focused on [LOC Israel  ] . 
Nonetheless , it was clever to pick [PER Goldstone  ] , given his stature . 
Because it 's a serious report , we will need to respond . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] had encouraged the [MISC Israelis  ] to participate in the process with the aim of producing a better final product . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will encourage the [ORG EU  ] to keep debate on the report at the [ORG HRC  ] , but [PER Schuwer  ] did not anticipate the [ORG EU  ] could reach consensus on this. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) When the [PER Goldstone  ] report was first released , FM [PER Verhagen  ] publicly stated that it was one-sided , with too much focus on [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Schuwer  ] noted the FM may have spoken a bit Qfocus on [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Schuwer  ] noted the FM may have spoken a bit soon , and [PER Verhagen  ] sent a letter to [LOC Parliament  ] on September 21 that it was too soon to offer an assessment . 
Responding to subsequent criticism from [LOC Parliament  ] , [PER Verhagen  ] agreed to submit the [ORG MFA  ] 's position to [LOC Parliament  ] on September 28 . 
[LOC Parliament  ] will then debate the issue the next day . 
[PER Schuwer  ] acknowledged that we won't be able to hide the split on [LOC Israel  ] policy . 
( [PER Note/Comment: Verhagen  ] and his party , the [PER Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , have traditionally defended [LOC Israel  ] . 
Minister for Development Cooperation [PER Koenders  ] and his [ORG Labor Party  ] are more skeptical of [LOC Israel  ] 's commitment to human rights . 
In sharp debates over [LOC Israel  ] 's human rights policies , the [ORG CDA  ] is challenged by [ORG Labor  ] and other parties on THE HAGUE 00000582 002 OF 002 the left . 
Post does not expect next week 's debate to change the [MISC Dutch  ] approach in the [ORG HRC  ] as described by [PER Schuwer  ] in paragraph 2 . 
End Note/Comment .
