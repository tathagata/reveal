( C ) Introduction: Ambassador , accompanied by [PER PolCouns  ] , met on 19 August 2005 with Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] and his chief of staff , to review a range of issues ( with focus on reftel [LOC Haiti  ] demarche ) and discuss the Ambassador 's departure from [LOC Brazil  ] later in the year to assume the Chief Executive Officer position at the [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] congratulated the Ambassador on the [ORG MCC  ] appointment , while expressing regret at his departure , and listened with interest to explanations of the functioning and mission of the [ORG MCC  ] as envisaged by the [ORG USG  ] and congress . 
[PER Amorim  ] said that he is considering a trip to the [LOC United States  ] on 27 September to address the [ORG U.S.-Brazil Business Council  ] , but would only go if he could also secure a " substantive " meeting on that date with Secretary [PER Rice  ] , where he would hope to discuss [LOC Haiti  ] and [ORG UN  ] reform . 
( Ambassador undertook to follow-up with Department . 
) Detailed reporting of the meeting , issue by issue , follows below . 
End introduction. . 
[LOC HAITI  ] ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) FM [PER Amorim  ] , on his own initiative , raised [LOC Haiti  ] with Ambassador . 
Noting his discussions on [LOC Haiti  ] with Secretary [PER Rice  ] on the margins of the [ORG OAS General Assembly  ] and in a subsequent telcon , [PER Amorim  ] said he believed the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOB  ] are in substantial agreement on most aspects of the way ahead . 
[PER Amorim  ] then raised the following concerns and questions: --Brazil and other [ORG MINUSTAH  ] contingents had launched successful " robust operations " in areas of [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] over the past several weeks , [PER Amorim  ] said . 
In that context , he asked about [ORG USG  ] funds for civil affairs and humanitarian projects that he had been led to understand would follow immediately on forceful [ORG MINUSTAH  ] suppression actions against gangs and violent groups . 
[PER Amorim  ] could not cite specific information about the funds , but reiterated that the [ORG GOB  ] had believed targeted assistance efforts would come immediately in the wake of military operations , in order to consolidate stability and gain public good will . 
He said reports he was receiving did not indicate that such efforts had moved ahead , and [PER Amorim  ] stressed their importance. --A second priority , [PER Amorim  ] opined , was the urgent need to reinforce the size and capacity of [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's police component . 
Follow-up actions with the civilian population in the wake of military operations , as well as general public order efforts and training of local police , are best carried out by civilian police contingents , rather than soldiers , [PER Amorim  ] opined. --Thirdly , [PER Amorim  ] asked to work with the [ORG USG  ] on broad public diplomacy efforts that can increase the international and [MISC Brazilian  ] publics' understanding and support for [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's mission in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Noting the protests and criticism by some NGOs that followed [ORG MINUSTAH  ] 's aggressive recent actions , and the risk of " collateral damage " to civilians inherent always in such operations , [PER Amorim  ] said there is a need to counter negative reactions with a strong message that focuses on the assistance and stability that [ORG MINUSTAH  ] and the international community are trying to bring to [LOC Haiti.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador undertook to follow up with [LOC Washington  ] on the questions and issues raised by [PER Amorim  ] , and then made reftel demarche points to [PER Amorim  ] on the importance of maintaining a strong [ORG MINUSTAH  ] presence in [LOC Haiti  ] beyond the February 2006 elections . 
( Note: [MISC PolCouns  ] had also provided reftel demarche points on 15 August to MRE Assistant Secretary for [ORG International Organization Affairs Antonio  ] SIPDIS [PER Guerreiro  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Amorim  ] said that he agreed with reftel 's position . 
He added that President [PER Lula da Silva  ] has also come to believe that a solid international presence over a longer term beyond the election and a carefully planned draw down are essential for [LOC Haiti  ] 's stability . 
[PER Amorim  ] noted that [PER Lula  ] had recently viewed a documentary on the [LOC Rwanda  ] genocide which had left a strong impression , and the president had told [PER Amorim  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] must remain committed in [LOC Haiti  ] and do everything it can to assure the country does not face a violent meltdown . 
[PER Amorim  ] expressed high confidence in [LOC Brazil  ] 's new ambassador in [LOC Port-au-Prince  ] and in the new [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MINUSTAH  ] commander , and also expressed gratitude for [ORG USG  ] support for retaining a [MISC Brazilian  ] in overall command of the mission . 
[PER Amorim  ] did note that election year debates and pressures in 2006 may become a factor for the [ORG GOB  ] in defending its continued commitment in [ORG MINUSTAH  ] , and hence a public diplomacy effort , per comments above , could be helpful . 
[PER Amorim  ] also said [LOC Brazil  ] continues to work on its national assistance projects with [LOC Haiti  ] , notably a waste treatment facility and a school meals program , but that these had moved slowly and were on a limited scale in comparison to [ORG USG  ] assistance plans . 
[ORG OAS  ] SOCIAL CHARTER ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador raised [ORG USG  ] concerns regarding [MISC Venezuelan  ] Government efforts to put forward a draft Social Charter for the [ORG OAS  ] at a [MISC GOV-sponsored  ] " ministerial " meeting in [LOC Caracas  ] on 28 August . 
He stressed that the [ORG USG  ] will not send a ministerial-level representative . 
The [ORG USG  ] believes , he added , that the national proposal coming from [LOC Venezuela  ] does not merit special consideration . 
[LOC U.S.  ] and other member states also have contributions and views that must be taken into account in discussing a charter . 
[PER Amorim  ] replied that he definitely would not be attending the [LOC Caracas  ] meeting , and was not aware of plans to attend by any other [ORG GOB  ] minister . 
The [ORG GOB  ] position is that a social charter , as with other [ORG OAS  ] documents , must be a product of consensus and appropriate institutional discussions among all [ORG OAS  ] member states , [PER Amorim  ] affirmed . 
COMPULSORY LICENSING -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador voiced continued [ORG USG  ] concerns about the potential for compulsory licensing of [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] medications in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Amorim  ] replied that he strongly prefers a negotiated settlement of the question with [LOC U.S.  ] companies , and will continue to work with the health ministry and others to achieve that outcome . 
[PER Amorim  ] did opine that , in his view , [LOC U.S.  ] companies need to produce more forward-leaning proposals for negotiation . 
Further , [PER Amorim  ] 's view is that it is legitimate under the [LOC TRIPS  ] mechanism for [LOC Brazil  ] to implement compulsory licensing given the free , public health aspect of its [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] programs , if a negotiated outcome is not reached . 
Ambassador noted that this would be a misuse of [LOC TRIPS  ] , in the [ORG USG  ] 's view . 
[PER Amorim  ] rejoined that he and his ministry seek a negotiated accord . 
POSSIBLE POTUS VISIT -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Amorim  ] asked about plans for a POTUS visit later in the year , and was assured by Ambassador that planning continues apace for a visit and there may be a public announcement after in the near future . 
[PER Amorim  ] and the Ambassador agreed that a two-stop visit , including [LOC Brasilia  ] and one other destination in [LOC Brazil  ] , would be attractive and should be further considered . 
A visit would be salutary for bilateral relations , both agreed , as would further efforts to develop joint [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] assistance projects in both [LOC Haiti  ] and [MISC Africa.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[PER Amorim  ] was relaxed and amiable in the forty-minute meeting , and [LOC Haiti  ] was clearly his central theme . 
His personal commitment appears solid , and we also believe that [PER Lula  ] likely considers the [MISC Brazilian-led  ] [LOC Haiti  ] mission as a legacy achievement for his mandate . 
Hence the [ORG GOB  ] appears to be on board with contributing to a continued international presence beyond the February 2006 elections , but its worries about negative public-relations blowback from forceful military operations may continue and intensify as [LOC Brazil  ] 's own 2006 elections approach , and if the corruption scandals rocking [PER Lula  ] 's government weaken [ORG GOB  ] credibility in defending a mission that does not enjoy a broad base of support in [MISC Brazilian  ] society . 
On that point , [PER Amorim  ] 's appeals for a public diplomacy campaign and immediate civil affairs and humanitarian projects to consolidate [MISC Haitian  ] support are real and urgent requests for efforts that may reinforce the [ORG GOB  ] 's position with its own public .
