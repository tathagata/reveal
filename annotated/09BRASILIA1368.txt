[LOC BRASILIA  ] 1230 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001368 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: Acting Charge [PER D'Affaires Cherie Jackson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This message covers our initial readout of the visit to [LOC Brazil  ] by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] . 
Follow-up messages will be sent once we obtain a more in-depth readout of the conversation between President [PER Lula  ] and President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
Summary ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Lula  ] welcomed President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] on November 23 , calling him a " good friend " and publicly supporting [LOC Iran  ] 's right to a nuclear program for civilian use , but declined public comment on the actual aims of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , the [ORG IAEA/P5  ] 1 proposal , or the state of democracy and human rights in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's public comments were relatively restrained , including a lengthy endorsement of [LOC Brazil  ] 's main goal -- [ORG UN Security Council  ] reform and a permanent [ORG UNSC  ] seat for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He also said of the 5 1 offer that [LOC Iran  ] " in principle agrees with the proposal presented , " before backtracking . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] and [PER Lula  ] met privately for three hours , but we have no solid information yet about their conversation . 
The visit featured the signing of several expected bilaterals , including agreements to promote commercial cooperation and to exempt diplomatic passport holders of certain visa requirements . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's visit illustrated critical foreign policy differences between [PER Lula  ] 's PT and other political parties ; front-running 2010 presidential candidate [PER Jose Serra  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) wrote an editorial opposing the visit . 
A planned early evening speech by [PER Ahmadinejad  ] in a local university was canceled , in part because the crowd was hostile and security precautions were weak . 
End summary . 
[ORG Three-Hour Meeting  ] ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After arriving late morning , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] spoke with President [PER Lula  ] in [ORG Itamaraty  ] ( [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] , or [ORG MRE  ] ) for three hours before advancing to the press conference . 
( Note: In part , the length of the meeting might be due to the necessity of interpreting from [LOC Farsi  ] to [MISC English  ] to [MISC Portuguese  ] and back again throughout . 
End note . 
) [ORG MRE  ] officials have told us that , as is standard for such meetings , no one at [ORG MRE  ] below Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] was present for any length of time . 
In a conversation with poloff the following day , [PER Ricardo Luis Pires Ribeiro  ] , [ORG Iran/Central Asia Desk  ] Director and control officer for the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit , expressed confidence based on his post-visit conversations with [PER Lula  ] 's staff that the President of [LOC Brazil  ] had pressed [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to accept the 5 1 proposal and that " progress had been made . 
" [PER Pires  ] saw [PER Lula  ] when he emerged from the meeting with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , visibly tired , to tell his staff he was " satisfied " with the conversation . 
Press Conference ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the late afternoon press conference , [PER Lula  ] made clear that [LOC Brazil  ] " defends the right of [LOC Iran  ] to develop and enrich uranium for the production of energy for peaceful purposes , " pointing out that [LOC Brazil  ] is defending the same rights for itself as it develops its own civilian nuclear technology . 
He also emphasized that nuclear disarmament and civilian technology must advance together . 
[PER Lula  ] encouraged [LOC Iran  ] to continue talking with the international community to reach a solution with regard to its nuclear program . 
He did not offer any value judgments on the actual status or aims of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear programs , nor did he make any statements endorsing or otherwise evaluating the 5 1 proposal . 
Nor did [PER Lula  ] directly address the health of democracy and human rights in [LOC Iran  ] , although he did make several general statements about human rights and tolerance in his remarks at the joint press event that were clearly designed to appease critics of [LOC Iran  ] 's human rights record. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's public statement was also relatively restrained , emphasizing the need for [ORG UN Security Council  ] reform -- including a permanent [ORG UNSC  ] seat for [LOC Brazil  ] -- and [ORG IMF  ] reforms , among other objectives . 
His public remarks were much milder than the prepared remarks sent by the [MISC Iranian  ] Embassy to the media the previous night , which blamed the [LOC United States  ] for a multitude of sins and strongly suggested [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001368 002.2 OF 003 [MISC Brazilian  ] solidarity in these views . 
[PER Pires  ] said that [ORG Itamaraty  ] had been alarmed upon seeing those remarks , and that [PER Lula  ] in turn agreed to press [PER Ahmadinejad  ] during the meeting to tone down his comments at the joint press conference . 
The result was a speech that often sounded unrehearsed , spoke in generalities , and criticized " the west " rather than specific nations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Only one question was permitted from the media -- a question about the aims of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program -- which [PER Lula  ] promptly deflected to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] without giving a substantive answer . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] spoke at length , claiming that [LOC Iran  ] had met all [ORG IAEA  ] requirements and asserting [LOC Iran  ] 's preferred solution to purchase fuel to enrich uranium . 
He later said that [LOC Iran  ] " in principle agrees with the ( [ORG P5  ] 1 ) proposal presented , " and that the [MISC Iranian  ] government " wants to finalize an accord . 
" He then backtracked , issuing a series of vague complaints about hegemomy and imperialism , and blaming the various actions of past [LOC U.S.  ] presidents for creating [LOC Iran  ] 's current predicament . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] generally stayed on the joint [MISC Iran-Brazilian  ] message about the right to nuclear enrichment for peaceful means . 
Voices of Dissent ----------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The President of [LOC Iran  ] 's visit provoked several demonstrations from civilian groups across the country , including in [LOC Rio De Janeiro  ] , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Curitiba  ] , and [LOC Florianopolis  ] . 
The [MISC Jewish  ] , [ORG Baha'i  ] , and GLBT communities were most prominent , often protesting together . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] had been scheduled to address students in the early evening at a local [LOC Brasilia  ] university , [ORG IESB  ] , in an event roughly modeled on the 2007 [PER Ahmadinejad  ] engagement at [ORG Columbia University  ] . 
According to [PER Pires  ] , [ORG MRE  ] recommended canceling shortly before the engagement upon finding that the 1,000 students waiting in line included a large number of protestors and that the police had not properly vetted the site for security concerns until the morning of the visit . 
After returning to his hotel , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] apparently still planned to attend but later changed his mind and held another short press conference at his hotel , in which he made more pointed remarks about the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , the Holocaust , and other topics . 
What the [MISC Ahmadinejad Visit Reveals About  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] Politics --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [PER Ahmadinejad  ] visit revealed sharp differences in foreign policy world views among [MISC Brazilian  ] political parties , which figure to help shape [LOC Brazil  ] 's approach to [LOC Iran  ] after the October 2010 presidential and congressional elections . 
On November 23 , front-running presidential contender [PER Jose Serra  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) published an editorial in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [ORG Folha  ] newspaper strongly criticzing [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's visit . 
In his op-ed [PER Serra  ] drew contrasts with [PER Lula  ] by characterizing [LOC Iran  ] 's recent presidential elections as fraudulent , condemning [MISC Iranian  ] support of terrorist activities beyond its borders ( including in [LOC Argentina  ] ) , and arguing that [LOC Brazil  ] must not undermine its case as an aspirant to a [ORG UNSC  ] permanent seat by standing next to a government that does not meet its [ORG IAEA  ] obligations . 
Other [ORG PSDB  ] members were even more vocal against the visit , as was the center-right opposition [PER Democratas  ] ( DEM ) party. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) While members of [PER Lula  ] 's Worker 's Party ( [ORG PT  ] ) defended the visit in public and in private conversations with us , often with mild reservations , other parties within the President 's governing coalition have been decidedly less enthusiatic . 
[ORG Senate  ] President [PER Jose Sarney  ] and [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] President [PER Michel Temer  ] , both from [ORG PMDB  ] , the largest party in [ORG Congress  ] , met briefly with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ; the discussion with [PER Temer  ] was frosty , with [PER Sarney  ] it was non-substantive . 
[ORG Chamber Presidency  ] staff later told poloff that [PER Temer  ] did not want to do the meeting , calling it " a necessary matter of protocol but still embarrassing . 
" He had been resigned to the meeting 's eventuality after giving the green light for [MISC Israeli  ] President [PER Shimon Peres  ] to speak to a joint session of [ORG Congress  ] earlier in the month ( [PER Peres  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Abbas  ] visits to be reported septel ) . 
Other leading figures within the governing coalition were more strongly negative , including Senator [PER Francisco Dornelles  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , who told poloff the visit was a " travesty . 
" [MISC Comment: A Qualified Success  ] for [PER Lula  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Although the way both [PER Ahmadinejad  ] and [PER Lula  ] have handled previous visits created concern about what each might [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001368 003.2 OF 003 say , this visit turned out to be unexpectedly tame . 
Gone was the tone from the November 20 visit by President [PER Abbas  ] , when [PER Lula  ] blamed the [LOC United States  ] for problems in the [LOC Middle East  ] and said the [ORG USG  ] should not be mediating discussion in the region . 
By taking the unusual step of sticking to the tight script provided by [ORG Itamaraty  ] and his advisors , [PER Lula  ] was able to lay out [LOC Brazil  ] 's key foreign policy goals -- a [ORG UNSC  ] permanent seat , development of a domestic nuclear program , and an increased profile in the world -- without raising further red flags . 
While we do not yet know the full content of [PER Lula  ] 's three-hour discussion with [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's apparent success in strongly reining in [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's prepared public discourse indicates that he took [PER Lula  ] 's advice seriously . 
[PER Lula  ] and [ORG Itamaraty  ] almost certainly achieved their own goals with the visit , but thee objectives have not been well communicated to he [MISC Brazilian  ] public , media , or other political prties , nor is it likely that they will be in advance of [PER Lula  ] 's planned visit to [LOC Iran  ] , scheduled fo April 2010 . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's relations with [LOC Iran  ] will reain a contentious issue domestically , which suggsts that the GOB 's emerging friendship with Iranwill continue to be carefully qualified and open to revision .
