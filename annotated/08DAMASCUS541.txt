<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 000541 NOFORN SIPDIS DEPT FOR NEA/ELA NSC FOR ABRAMS/SINGH EO 12958 DECL: 08/03/2028 TAGS PGOV , PTER , SY , LE , IS SUBJECT: TOP [MISC ASAD  ] SECURITY AIDE ASSASSINATED Classified By: Pol/Econ Counselor [PER Tim Pounds  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Syrian  ] Presidential security aide [ORG Brigadier General  ] [PER Muhammad Sulayman  ] was assassinated by a sniper late on the evening of August 1 in the coastal city of [LOC Tartous  ] . 
[PER Sulayman  ] enjoyed a reputation among Embassy contacts as having special status and proximity to [PER Bashar  ] . 
[PER Sulayman  ] was said to have managed special projects for [MISC Asad  ] , some of which may have been unknown to the broader [MISC Syrian  ] military leadership . 
Our expectation is that the [ORG SARG  ] will try to keep this incident under wraps as long as possible , but that will become more difficult as regional and international press run with the story . 
End summary. ---------------------------- Details Murky After Official News Blackout ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On August 3 , the [MISC Israeli  ] daily [ORG Ha’aretz  ] cited “senior sources in [LOC Damascus”  ] in reporting [MISC Sulayman’s  ] assassination on its website , identifying [PER Sulayman  ] as Asad’s “liaison” to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[ORG Al Hayat  ] and the news ticker [ORG Al Bawaba  ] also reported the story . 
A reliable Embassy press contact said that he had heard of the attack yesterday , and said that the version of the story he had heard was that [MISC Sulayman’s  ] entire family had also been killed . 
According to the contact , [MISC Syrian  ] security services quickly cordoned and searched the entire beach neighborhood where the shooting had occurred . 
Other Embassy sources would say little except that [MISC Syria-based  ] reporters are under instructions not to report the story . 
As of late August 3 , all [MISC Syrian-based  ] press remains silent. ------------------------ Pointing the [ORG SARG Finger  ] ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As in other recent assassinations in [LOC Syria  ] , speculation about who could have done it will likely be rampant . 
The most obvious suspects are the [MISC Israelis  ] . 
[ORG SARG  ] security services are well aware that the coastal city of [LOC Tartous  ] would offer easier access to [MISC Israeli  ] operatives than would more inland locations such as [LOC Damascus  ] . 
[PER Sulayman  ] was not a highly visible government official , and the use of a sniper suggests the assassin could visually identify [PER Sulayman  ] from a distance . 
As [LOC Tartous  ] is also close to the northern-most part of the [MISC Syrian-Lebanese  ] border , the [ORG SARG  ] might blame pro-Saudi [MISC Islamist  ] militants from [LOC Tripoli  ] or the Nahr al-Barid camp . 
Some may even go so far as to suggest the ( comment: unlikely ) possibility that this was an inside job to prevent [PER Sulayman  ] from damaging the [MISC Syrian  ] regime. ------------ Implications ------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although officially just a [ORG Brigadier General  ] , [PER Sulayman  ] was considered President Asad’s top security aide and was known to manage several special projects for [PER Bashar  ] -- some of which may have been unknown to the broader [MISC Syrian  ] military leadership . 
Sulayman’s proximity to [MISC Asad  ] granted him special status in the eyes of more senior [MISC Syrian  ] military officials . 
DAMASCUS 00000541 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) If the [ORG SARG  ] were to suspect an [MISC Israeli  ] role in the assassination , it may be reluctant to level public accusations as ( 1 ) they may not know who did it ; ( 2 ) such accusations could impair or end Syria’s nascent peace negotiations with [LOC Israel  ] ; and ( 3 ) publicizing the event would reveal yet another lapse in Syria’s vaunted security apparatus . 
[LOC Syria  ] could seek to retaliate against [LOC Israel  ] via proxies and allies in [LOC Lebanon  ] or elsewhere . 
If terrorist groups are suspected , this may prompt a domestic crackdown or counterstrikes on targets within the suspected group. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although unlikely , elements within the [ORG SARG  ] may suspect or allege a [LOC U.S.  ] role . 
Possible responses could include staged demonstrations against [LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC Syria  ] , retaliatory diplomatic or security measures , or the threat of targeting [LOC U.S.  ] installations via proxies . 
To date , Post has no indications that the [ORG SARG  ] is seeking to blame the [ORG USG  ] for the assassination , impose retaliatory measures , or retreat from its commitment to ensure security for our facilities and personnel . 
Additionally , core country team assesses that no immediate , new threats have been identified as a result of post-incident reporting. ---------------------------- Probable Short-term Reaction ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) For now , the most likely default [ORG SARG  ] response will be to clamp down on information and say nothing while the various security services scramble to identify a culprit and avoid being blamed . 
However long the [MISC Syrians  ] can hold out without saying anything , they will . 
[ORG SARG  ] leaders will likely view any publicity of the assassination as a net loss for the regime. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As press in [LOC Lebanon  ] and elsewhere in the region reports Sulayman’s assassination , it will be increasingly difficult for the [ORG SARG  ] to keep a lid on this high-profile attack . 
Coinciding with Bashar’s trip to [LOC Tehran  ] and on the heels of the latest round of indirect talks with [LOC Israel  ] , the assassination will likely weaken advocates of the peace negotiations , including [PER Bashar  ] himself .
