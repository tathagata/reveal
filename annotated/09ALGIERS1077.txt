Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] ( [ORG AFRICOM  ] ) Commander General [PER William Ward  ] met [MISC Algerian  ] President [PER Abdelaziz Bouteflika  ] November 25 , during [PER Ward  ] 's first visit to [LOC Algeria  ] since assuming command of [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
[PER Ward  ] said [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's strategy was to assist [MISC African  ] nations in providing for their own security needs , not do the job for them . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recognized [LOC Algeria  ] 's leadership in the region , and [ORG AFRICOM  ] was prepared to assist [LOC Algeria  ] and its neighbors combat terrorism . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] said [LOC Algeria  ] wanted to be a strategic partner , not an adversary . 
Our military relationship already included training and technical cooperation . 
End-use-monitoring requirements infringed on [LOC Algeria  ] 's national sovereignty and therefore imposed some limits on military engagement . 
But the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] shared a common goal in combating terrorism . 
Terrorism in the region had taken a dangerous form , and [LOC Sahel  ] countries were prepared to address the problem jointly . 
More needed to be done to ensure the participation and commitment of [LOC Mali  ] 's political leadership in the regional struggle . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] told [PER Ward  ] the [MISC Malian  ] president needed to understand he could not be friends with both the thieves and their victims at the same time . 
Trans-Sahara heads of state still planned to convene a security and development summit in [LOC Bamako  ] but had yet to set a firm date . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] also reviewed [MISC Egyptian-Algerian  ] tensions in the aftermath of a [MISC World Cup  ] qualifying match , [LOC Western Sahara  ] , the negative repercussions of [MISC Israeli  ] settlement activities , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
On the soccer issue , he made a point of telling [PER Ward  ] that the king of [LOC Morocco  ] -- in contrast to the strain with [LOC Egypt  ] -- had sent him a very warm congratulatory message after the game . 
At the end of the meeting , [PER Bouteflika  ] invited [PER Ward  ] to return to [LOC Algeria  ] in the near future . 
End summary . 
Addressing [LOC Common Challenges  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Visiting [ORG Africa Command  ] ( [ORG AFRICOM  ] ) Commander General [PER William Ward  ] met with [MISC Algerian  ] President [PER Abdelaziz Bouteflika  ] November 25 at the presidential residence . 
With [PER Bouteflika  ] were Chief of Staff of the [ORG Algerian National Popular Army  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) Lieutenant General [PER Ahmed Gaid-Salah  ] , [ORG Ministry of National Defense  ] ( [ORG MND  ] ) Director of External Relations and [ORG Cooperation General  ] [PER Nourredine Mekri  ] , [ORG ANP  ] Chief of [ORG Organization and Logistics Major General  ] [PER Abdelhamid Ghriss  ] and a translator . 
The Ambassador , General [PER Ward  ] 's foreign policy advisor , Dr. [PER Raymond Brown  ] , the [ORG DATT  ] and [PER Poloff  ] ( notetaker ) accompanied General [PER Ward  ] to the meeting , which lasted two hours . 
[PER Ward  ] emphasized that his visit to [LOC Algiers  ] was symbolic of our countries' growing bilateral relationship . 
[ORG Africa Command  ] 's mission was to assist [MISC African  ] nations address their own security challenges , not to do it for them . 
The purpose of his visit , [PER Ward  ] said , was to listen to [LOC Algeria  ] 's perspective on enhancing our cooperation as we seek ways to work together to address common challenges in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Ward  ] recognized that these challenges were complex and required development and political solutions , not just military intervention . 
Going forward , we sought to cooperate in areas that [LOC Algeria  ] determines are priorities . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] welcomed the regional counterterrorism efforts [LOC Algeria  ] has engaged in with neighboring [LOC Sahel  ] countries . 
[LOC Algeria  ] is leading the effort ; we will work with [LOC Algeria  ] and its neighbors to assist in eliminating the terrorist threat in the region. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Bouteflika  ] said that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] shared a common objective and the will to work cooperatively in the fight against terrorism . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] noted the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] started to work more closely together during the [PER Clinton  ] administration when both sides came to realize they were fighting the same problem . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] underscored that after 9/11 , [LOC Algeria  ] was the first [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] country to send a message of solidarity to President [PER Bush  ] . 
Subsequently , despite the unpopularity of some [PER Bush  ] policies , political and economic relations between our countries improved . 
Today , relations were excellent , he said , noting that [LOC Algeria  ] was the [LOC United States'  ] second largest trading partner in the [LOC Middle East  ] after [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and our largest trading partner in [LOC Africa  ] . 
President [PER Obama  ] 's new approach to [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy was " a breath of fresh air " and well regarded by developing world countries . 
But this meant there were also high expectations for his administration . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] predicted that our bilateral relationship would continue in a positive direction . 
He commented that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] were moving forward with cooperation , recognizing the value of dialogue across all leadership levels . 
In this regard , [PER Bouteflika  ] declared he was ready to assist [PER Ward  ] and invited him to visit [LOC Algeria  ] again . 
[ORG Military Cooperation  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bouteflika  ] attached importance to [LOC Algeria  ] 's military-military cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] but noted that [LOC U.S.  ] end-use monitoring requirements contravened [LOC Algeria  ] 's national sovereignty . 
Nonetheless , we had made progress on training and technical cooperation . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] said the capabilities of [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Algerian  ] forces were well understood in the region . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] argued that frank , direct talks were the key to a successful military dialogue , as well as recognizing that , in some cases , there would be limits on the extent of cooperation . 
" Tell us what you want , and we will tell you what we can do . 
" [LOC Algeria  ] , he continued , wanted to be a strategic partner for the [LOC U.S.  ] in the region , not an adversary. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Ward  ] thanked [PER Bouteflika  ] for his candid assessment of our mil-mil relationship . 
He said the President , secretaries of State and [ORG Defense  ] , and [ORG US Joint Chiefs  ] of Staff , all recognized the value of the [MISC US-Algeria  ] partnership . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] responded that he would help us to consolidate that partnership . 
[PER Ward  ] argued that to enhance our partnership , [LOC Algeria  ] needed to tell us how we can contribute best to achieve mutual objectives . 
Despite the bad things sometimes said about [ORG AFRICOM  ] , [PER Ward  ] said with a smile , his command had not been created to take over [LOC Africa  ] . 
Without missing a beat , [PER Bouteflika  ] replied with an even bigger smile that he had been unsure about this himself until [PER Ward  ] came . 
[PER Ward  ] said that , as we continue our military dialogue , we want to do the things [LOC Algeria  ] tells us are important . 
[PER Ward  ] affirmed [LOC Algeria  ] had long recognized the challenge of extremism and demonstrated its ability to fight back . 
[ORG AFRICOM  ] would do its part to support [LOC Algeria  ] and its neighbors in this effort . 
Addressing [PER Bouteflika  ] 's point on end-use-monitoring requirements , [PER Ward  ] suggested focusing our efforts in areas where cooperation was possible , i.e. , training and equipping . 
He acknowledged that some [LOC U.S.  ] laws and regulations may preclude for now [LOC Algeria  ] 's participation in other forms of engagement . 
Civil-Military Relations ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Bouteflika  ] underscored that [LOC Algeria  ] 's military " absolutely " respected the authority of civilian leadership . 
" This is not at all like [LOC Turkey  ] , " he said . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] asserted that the army was forced to take drastic measures during the violence of the 1990s in order to save the country . 
This was a difficult period , but constitutional rule had been restored . 
" The house is now in order , " he stressed , " and I can tell you that the army obeys the civilians . 
There is one constitution and all obey it . 
" [PER Bouteflika  ] acknowledged , however , that the problems of the past still haunted the country . 
He cited foreign press reports referring to [LOC Algeria  ] as a dictatorship and argued that the term was sometimes used carelessly . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] constitution had established the rule of law . 
In 2004 it was decided that there was no more historical " revolutionary legitimacy " . 
The only legitimacy was the constitution . 
" Anyone can be a candidate for election , in accordance with the constitution , even a general . 
" He paused , then grinned and said , " but the generals realize the difficulties and none has been a candidate yet . 
" Counterterrorism ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Bouteflika  ] said terrorism in [LOC Africa  ] had taken a dangerous form . 
The situation in [LOC Somalia  ] was hopeless , he commented . 
Meanwhile , the [LOC Sahel  ] region presented a complex set of issues . 
Fortunately , most [LOC Sahel  ] countries were determined to cooperate and have the capability to fight the threat if they work together . 
[LOC Mauritania  ] expressed a clear commitment as did [LOC Niger  ] , although [PER Bouteflika  ] recognized [LOC U.S.  ] concerns with President [PER Tandja  ] . 
[LOC Mali  ] 's full cooperation remained elusive , however . 
[LOC Mali  ] 's policies have failed to create stability in the north . 
The result is a lawless environment in which smuggling , along with arms and drug trafficking , enable terrorism . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] said the region was prepared to tackle this problem , and bilateral and regional efforts were already underway . 
In this regard , [LOC Algeria  ] was closely monitoring [LOC U.S.  ] military assistance to [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Niger.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ward  ] told [PER Bouteflika  ] that he planned to visit [LOC Bamako  ] after [LOC Algiers  ] and would encourage [LOC Mali  ] 's leaders to cooperate in the region 's counterterrorism efforts . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was providing military assistance to [LOC Mali  ] , and we hoped it complemented the work [LOC Algeria  ] was doing . 
[PER Ward  ] emphasized that , ultimately , defeating terrorism was the responsibility of the region . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] expressed his appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Mali  ] and said [LOC Algeria  ] also provided aid , including some equipment . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to tell [MISC Malian  ] President [PER Amadou Toumani Toure  ] that " he cannot be a friend to the thieves and victims at the same time . 
" Many in [LOC Mali  ] 's security services shared the same concern , [PER Bouteflika  ] asserted . 
In the past , he said , [LOC Algeria  ] has waited for the chance to debrief terrorist suspects held in [LOC Mali  ] , only to find out later that [MISC Malian  ] officials were conducting negotiations for the terrorist 's release back to the terrorist organizations at the same time . 
" It is difficult to cooperate in these conditions , " he said . 
Despite difficulties , [PER Bouteflika  ] said regional leaders still planned to convene a security and development summit in [LOC Bamako  ] . 
All agreed on the need for the summit , he said , but there was still no set date . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] said that [LOC Algeria  ] would be open to sharing information with the [LOC U.S.  ] regarding [LOC Algeria  ] 's cooperation with its neighbors . 
General [PER Ward  ] said [ORG AFRICOM  ] would do the same for [LOC Algeria  ] regarding [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives in the region . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG Ward-Bouteflika  ] meeting was significant in a number of respects . 
The [MISC Algerian  ] president spoke repeatedly of his readiness to build a strategic relationship with the [LOC US  ] . 
He transmitted clear readiness for closer coordination and contact on [LOC Sahel  ] counter-terrorism issues . 
The simple fact of the meeting with the president was itself a green light to the military bureaucracy on stepped-up bilateral military cooperation . 
Not least , the warm and high-level official reception provided a powerful antidote to the persistent negative mythology about [ORG Africa Command  ] since the command 's rollout . 
It was also noteworthy that , in the presence of three generals , including the chief of staff , [PER Bouteflika  ] spoke assertively to [PER Ward  ] about civilian control of the military . 
He described the revolutionary origins of military influence in [LOC Algeria  ] , said this so-called revolutionary legitimacy ended in 2004 , and the military now obeys the civilians and they all obey the constitution . 
In the course of his regional political review , [PER Bouteflika  ] delivered [LOC Algeria  ] 's views on [LOC Western Sahara  ] in familiar terms . 
But in doing so , he also struck an unusually positive note about [LOC Morocco  ] and the king 's message . 
Clearly , in the context of the high emotions stirred in [LOC Algeria  ] over the controversial [MISC World Cup  ] contest with [LOC Egypt  ] , [PER Mohammed VI  ] 's message of congratulations struck a chord with [PER Bouteflika  ] .
