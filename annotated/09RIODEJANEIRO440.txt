POSITIVE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD IN PACIFIED FAVELAS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Human rights and favela community representatives generally support [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] ( reftel A ) and report no killings related to the 450 [ORG Pacification Police Unit  ] ( [ORG UPP  ] ) officers that patrol the four favela shantytowns now under " pacification . 
" [PER Rafael Dias  ] of [LOC Global Justice  ] , one of the most prestigious human rights groups in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , told us on December 1 that the record of the [ORG UPP  ] on human rights was thus far positive , explaining there have been no reported killings by the [ORG UPP  ] officers since [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] state and municipal authorities launched the program one year ago . 
( [ORG Note: Authorities  ] have to date " pacified " four favelas , i.e. eliminated drug-trafficking elements , established a sustained [ORG UPP  ] presence , and started provisions of basic services . 
[MISC Anti-narco  ] trafficking operations are still underway in a fifth favela ( reftel B ) , which will receive [ORG UPP  ] officers to conduct community policing as soon as the security situation fully stabilizes . 
End note ) . 
[PER Franciso Marcelo  ] from the [ORG Observatory of Rio  ] de [PER Janeiro Favelas  ] told us on November 30 that crime indicators - especially homicides - are much lower in pacified communities and the provision of basic services , such as electricity and trash collecting , is steadily improving . 
[PER Itamar Silva  ] , Director of the [ORG Observatory of Rio  ] de [LOC Janeiro Favelas  ] also offered conditional praise of the [ORG UPP  ] , citing the experience of the pacified favela [PER Santa Marta  ] , where local residents support the [ORG UPP  ] presence due to a vastly improved security climate ( reftel C ) . ...BUT IN STARK CONTRAST TO OVERALL POLICE RECORD <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although the [ORG UPP  ] 's record to date on respecting human rights is positive , the number of allegations of human rights abuses by the [LOC Rio  ] state Military Police , especially extrajudicial killings , is not . 
On December 8 , [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] ( [ORG HWR  ] ) published a report entitled " [MISC Brazil: Lethal Force  ] , " which focuses on police violence in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Sao Paolo  ] . 
[ORG HWR  ] 's Director for the [ORG Americas Jose Miguel Vivanco and Associate  ] Director [PER Daniel Wilkenson  ] , who announced the release of the report in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , expressed specific concern over alleged resisting-arrest killings . 
During a meeting with a [ORG Harvard University  ] alumni group - attended by [PER Poloff  ] and PAO - on the day of the release , [PER Vivanco  ] and [PER Wilkenson  ] said the 1,137 police killings documented as resisting arrest in [LOC Rio  ] state in 2008 constituted a " dramatic " figure . 
They claimed forensic evidence and case studies compiled over the past four years led them to conclude many such incidents were extrajudicial killings . 
While condemning such acts , [PER Vivanco  ] and [PER Wilkenson  ] conceded Military Police faced a " huge challenge " of critical violence in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , and praised the [LOC RIO DE JAN  ] 00000440 002 OF 003 receptiveness of [LOC Rio  ] 's Governor [PER Sergio Cabral  ] to the report 's findings and proposals . 
The following day , however , [LOC Rio  ] 's [ORG State Security for Public Security Jose  ] [PER Mariano Beltrame  ] publically called the report biased , and defended the [ORG UPP  ] law enforcement model as the best way to reduce the number of killings documented as resisting arrest . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG HRW  ] report referred to the [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] as a positive initiative , but did not independently evaluate the program . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Cabral  ] also later came out in the press criticizing the report as highlighting only the negative aspects of police conduct , and not recognizing " good police . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Local human rights groups also strongly criticize the levels of force exercised by conventional police forces , as well as wide-spread corruption . 
According to [LOC Global Justice  ] 's [PER Dias  ] , military police do not make a distinction between criminals and ordinary favela residents , part of the cause for the large number of police-related killings . 
Furthermore , he stated corrupt police fueled violence in the favelas , recalling incidents where police even rented out arms , ammunition , and vehicles to rival drug factions engaged in de facto wars for control of favela territory and narcotics markets . 
[PER Monica Francisco  ] of Group Arteiras , a favela women 's rights group , complained of a history of rampant police corruption in the communities , which fomented a high level of mistrust of the police . 
Rosino deCastro [PER Diniz  ] , President of the [ORG Federation of Rio de Janeiro Favela Associations  ] said the risk of [ORG UPP  ] corruption was his greatest concern about the [ORG Pacification Program  ] . 
In fact , according to [PER Itimar Silva  ] , Director of the [ORG Brazilian Institute for Social Analysis  ] ( [ORG IBASE  ] ) , police corruption is what ultimately led to the demise of an initiative similar to the [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] in 1986 . 
" The police tried this before , " he said , " until they themselves got involved with drug trafficking . 
" THE [MISC OLYMPICS  ] AND HUMAN RIGHTS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to human rights experts , the 2016 [MISC Olympic Games  ] offer both an opportunity and possible challenge to improve [LOC Rio  ] 's human rights climate . 
[ORG HWR  ] 's [PER Vivanco  ] said the [MISC Olympics  ] were " the best news for human rights in [LOC Rio  ] , " as the designation of host city would put the spotlight on the problem and offer authorities an opportunity to capitalize on increased attention and resources . 
[ORG HWR  ] 's [PER Wilkenson  ] cautioned , however , that the [MISC Olympics  ] could worsen the situation in [LOC Rio  ] , recounting the experience in [LOC Beijing  ] , when government respect for human rights worsened prior to and during the [MISC Games  ] . 
He offered further caution by recalling [LOC Rio  ] 's hosting of the 2007 [MISC Pan American Games  ] , when police killed some 20 persons in the massive favela [MISC Complexo  ] de [PER Alemao  ] in one day alone . 
Global Justice 's [PER Dias  ] also expressed concern that a large police crackdown due to the [MISC Olympics  ] would result in more extrajudicial killings . 
With the [MISC Pan American Games  ] experience in mind , Global Justice has already started discussing this issue with large , international human rights groups , such as [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] and the [ORG International Federation for Human Rights  ] , to create a global network of groups with a specific focus on the [MISC Olympics  ] . 
GROUPS QUESTION MOTIVES OF PACIFICATION <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While acknowledging there were no reports of [ORG UPP  ] human rights violations thus far , human rights activists and [MISC NGO  ] leaders express suspicion over the government 's true aims in pushing the [ORG Pacification Program  ] . 
[PER Francisco Marcelo  ] from the [ORG Observatory of Rio de Janeiro Favelas  ] questioned the construction of walls around various favela communities . 
Although the [ORG Rio Municipal Government  ] states these walls are necessary to protect surrounding rainforest from further encroachment , as in the case of pacified favela [PER Dona Marta  ] , or as highway noise shields for favela residents , as in the case of [LOC Complexo de Mare  ] , [PER Fernando  ] said these explanations were not credible and masked authorities' attempts to further segregate favelas from mainstream communities ( reftel D ) . 
Group Arteiras' [PER Monica Francisco  ] also suspected the implementation of [ORG UPP  ] officers in favelas constituted nothing more than a short-term " emergency response " to the demands by [LOC Rio  ] 's residents to address the favela issue . 
Global Justice 's [PER Dias  ] also questioned the presence of short-circuit video cameras in the pacified favela [PER Dona Marta  ] , stating locals viewed the cameras as an " intrusion . 
" ( Comment: While hosting a tour of a pacified favela for Principal Officer and other consulate officers , [ORG State Security Secretary Beltrame  ] explained these cameras were a crucial component in the [ORG UPP  ] 's security scheme for the favela . 
End Comment ) . 
[PER Francisco  ] echoed this sentiment , explaining that while supporting the pacification of the favela where he lived , he would oppose any installation of cameras in as an intrusion of privacy and unreasonable means of " control . 
" He also hoped that [ORG UPP  ] officers would not resort to the same sort of corruption and violence he had witnessed in other conventional forces during prior operations in his favela . 
COMMENT <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Considering the legacy of heavy-handed violence by the military police and the mistrust between them and [LOC Rio  ] 's poorest and most violent favela communities , it is noteworthy that [ORG UPP  ] officers have had as much success sustaining their operations , without major incidents , over a year 's time . 
The absence of allegations of human rights abuses or police corruption in these four pacified favelas from organized groups is equally significant . 
Security officials have adopted special standards for [ORG UPP  ] officers , such as accepting only new recruits so as to avoid the risk of prior corruption and instituting mandatory human rights training , which have undoubtedly been factors in the [ORG UPP  ] 's good human rights record so far . 
In addition , narco-trafficking groups have yet to openly resist the [ORG UPP  ] forces , either with directed violence or general propaganda . 
Should they do so , this could test the [ORG UPP  ] 's heretofore solid human rights record .
