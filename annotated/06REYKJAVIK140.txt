( C ) Summary: Recent discussions with [MISC Icelandic  ] Government personnel and the first three meetings of a bilateral working group managing base closure issues offer indications of [ORG GOI  ] expectations for the [ORG EUCOM  ] briefing 4/26 in [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
Although the [MISC Icelandic  ] leadership understands the classified nature of the [ORG EUCOM  ] plan to defend [LOC Iceland  ] , they are looking for a briefing that is concrete enough to allow ministers to explain its basic elements to a skeptical public . 
With [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) preparing for closure , it is also urgent that we come to a swift understanding with the [PER Icelanders  ] on transition issues to include status of the Agreed Area , [ORG IADS  ] , environment , real estate , and airport operations . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Since the last round of bilateral defense talks March 31 ( reftel ) , Ambassador , [ORG DCM  ] , and poloff have canvassed senior [MISC Icelandic  ] diplomats for their reactions and hopes for the next round , now scheduled for April 26 . 
In addition , a working group of [MISC Icelandic  ] and [MISC Embassy  ] , [ORG NASKEF  ] , and [ORG Iceland Defense Force  ] officials has met three times to discuss nuts-and-bolts aspects of the [LOC U.S.  ] military 's departure . 
Post 's findings and recommendations: -------- The Plan -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The plan to defend [LOC Iceland  ] after the withdrawal of the combat aircraft that [ORG EUCOM  ] presents will need to meet the following criteria if it is to respond to [MISC Icelandic  ] concerns about the optics of the bilateral defense relationship as well as about security: -- [PER Intelligibility: Briefers  ] should keep in mind that [PER Icelanders  ] have limited competence in military matters , and no one at their side of the table this week will have military experience . 
We must take care to facilitate [MISC Icelandic  ] engagement through plain speaking in layman 's terms . 
-- Specificity: Foreign Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] and other government ministers must be able to reassure the public that there is a blueprint for [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials understand that part of the blueprint will necessarily be classified , but must also to be able to express confidence that our defense plan for [LOC Iceland  ] is reasonably concrete -- and to disclose enough details to make it credible to a public accustomed to the very " visible defense " offered by the departing aircraft and base personnel . 
-- [MISC Input:  ] The [ORG GOI  ] wants and needs to be seen to have had input into the plan . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] chief negotiator [PER Albert Jonsson  ] and FM [PER Haarde  ] have made it clear that the [MISC Icelandic  ] government expects to comment on and perhaps contribute ideas to any [LOC U.S.  ] plan before it is finalized . 
-- Air cover: The [PER Icelanders  ] still want force posture that is " visible and robust , " i.e. planes here at least some of the time and , ideally , some facilities left here to service them . 
In addition , they want a schedule of exercises . 
-- [MISC Radars:  ] The [ORG GOI  ] insists on continued operation of the [ORG NATO-controlled Integrated Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) . ----------------- [ORG Transition Issues  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The bilateral [ORG Transition Work Group  ] that has been meeting to handle the practicalities of base drawdown ( ref B ) has identified several areas of [MISC U.S.-Icelandic  ] disagreement that we need to address promptly , before the [MISC Icelandic  ] position hardens to a point where negotiation will become impossible . 
The main issues are: -- Agreed [MISC Area:  ] The [ORG GOI  ] believes the USG is responsible for continued utility costs , maintenance of , and security for the Agreed Area even if we withdraw our forces and that there is no point to the [MISC Defense Agreement  ] if we do not accept this view . 
They have suggested that any [LOC U.S.  ] actions must be approved by the [ORG NATO Infrastructure Committee  ] . 
-- Environment/real estate: The [PER Icelanders  ] want to move quickly on land return and need to be told whether the [LOC U.S.  ] will ask for residual value payments ( note: which they have said they do not wish to pay ; end note ) and who should be responsible for environmental and [ORG UXO  ] cleanup ( note: they argue it should be us ; end note ) . 
-- [ORG Airport operations:  ] The [PER Icelanders  ] want us to hand over equipment needed to maintain the airfield ; we have thus far said that the [LOC U.S.  ] is open to providing the equipment but that the question of whether and how much we would expect in payment is an open one . 
The [ORG MFA  ] has promised a formal letter of request for specific equipment. ------------------------ Comment/Action Requested ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The bilateral talks scheduled for April 26 are a key event for the [MISC Icelandic  ] government . 
The [ORG EUCOM  ] team must deliver the briefing on " the plan " that they promised the Icelanders March 31 , at the risk of damaging our credibility and undercutting our well-wishers in the [MISC Icelandic  ] government . 
The [ORG EUCOM  ] team must come to [LOC Iceland  ] with the object not just of briefing the government but of soliciting [LOC Reykjavik  ] 's input . 
We need to tell the government enough about how we would defend this [ORG NATO  ] ally so that FM [PER Haarde  ] and his colleagues can say they have confidence that the [LOC U.S.  ] has considered possible threats and knows how we would deal with them . 
On another track , we also need to reach interagency agreement on transition issues very soon and get to work on implementing our decisions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On base transition issues , we recommend that an interagency team empowered formally to negotiate -- not just to brief on [LOC U.S.  ] views -- be dispatched as early in May as feasible. van Voorst</pre></code>
