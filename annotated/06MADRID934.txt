( U ) Summary . 
Two years after it lost in the dramatic elections of March 14 , 2004 -- three days after the March 11 terrorist attacks -- [LOC Spain  ] 's main opposition party , the [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) finds itself outmaneuvered and either isolated with radical nationalists or forced to collaborate with the Socialist government of [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] on the most important issues of [MISC Spanish  ] domestic politics . 
Even when the governing [ORG PSOE  ] ( Socialist ) party was losing ground in opinion polls , the statistics did not reflect any increase in popularity for the [ORG PP  ] , only a fall in the government approval rating because of uncertainty about regional questions in [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [LOC Basque Country  ] . 
The recent ceasefire announcement by the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] has raised the government 's poll ratings significantly , and marks a monumental inflection point for the [ORG PP  ] in its search for the critical swing votes at the center of the political spectrum . 
A combination of leadership and message problems has kept the [ORG PP  ] from capturing the imagination of the [MISC Spanish  ] electorate , along with a consistent underestimation of the political skill of the [PER Zapatero  ] government . 
It may take an internal revolution in the party or a significant recalibration of strategy for the [ORG PP  ] to come back in the immediate future . 
End summary. ---------------- No to Everything ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Since losing the March 2004 elections , the [ORG Partido Popular  ] , led by [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] and his team of veterans from the government of [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] , has struggled to make headway against the ruling Socialist Party ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) and the government of [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] . 
Blaming the [ORG PP  ] loss on the March 11 train bombings and the evil machinations of the [MISC Socialists  ] , Embassy [ORG PP  ] contacts have consistently seemed to think that their election loss was really a mistake , a massive " misunderstanding " on the part of the electorate , ignoring the very real issues voters disagreed with them on: the war in [LOC Iraq  ] -- which 90% of [MISC Spaniards  ] opposed -- and , importantly , the [PER Aznar  ] government 's handling of the March 11 attacks . 
The party has spent the last two years trying to win support by harassing the [PER Zapatero  ] government on everything it does ( including when it is cooperating with the [ORG USG  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG PP  ] contacts have told us that their party strategy has been to attack the government at every turn . 
These attacks made ideological sense when the [ORG PP  ] criticized the government on issues such as gay marriage , education reform ( reducing the influence of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church ) or even in opposing GOS policy on [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
However , the [ORG PP  ] also chose to take the government to task over [MISC Spanish  ] military presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the participation of the [MISC Spanish  ] frigate [PER Alvaro Basan  ] in the US [PER Theodore Roosevelt  ] battle group in the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] , policies of this government which support US goals . 
The [ORG PP  ] 's attacks on these policies were therefore inconsistent with their own stated aims. -------- The [PER Hook  ] -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) According to numerous public opinion polls , the [ORG PP  ] made little or no dent ( beyond its own base ) in the government 's popularity with its attack strategy , until a truly divisive issue came about: the reform of the [MISC Catalan  ] [LOC Autonomy Statute  ] ( " [MISC Estatut  ] " in the [MISC Catalan  ] language ) . 
As the [MISC Catalans  ] tried to declare in the legal document defining their relations with [PER Madrid  ] that they constitute a " nation , " many [MISC Spaniards  ] wanted to know why the government seemed to be letting them pull out of the [MISC Spanish  ] nation they supposedly already belonged to . 
In addition , the new [MISC Estatut  ] was to give [LOC Catalonia  ] broad fiscal independence , beyond what any other region of [LOC Spain  ] had ever been granted . 
While the issue of the [MISC Estatut  ] did not worry all [MISC Spaniards  ] , enough were concerned that government approval ratings began to fall . 
This was exacerbated last autumn by floods of [LOC Sub-Saharan  ] would-be immigrants charging [MISC Spanish  ] borders at [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] , as well as by speculation that the Socialist government was holding talks with [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The [MISC Estatut  ] , immigration and terrorism concerns gave the [ORG PP  ] the hook it needed to be able to craft a message that might help it benefit from the government 's falling popularity . 
[PER Rajoy  ] , [MISC Catalan  ] [ORG PP  ] leader [PER Josep Pique  ] , and [ORG MADRID  ] 00000934 002 OF 004 national leaders such as [ORG PP  ] Secretary General [PER Angel Acebes  ] and Parliamentary Spokesman [PER Eduardo Zaplana  ] began speaking of national unity , equality for all [MISC Spaniards  ] ( in other words , no special privileges for [MISC Catalans  ] and [MISC Basques  ] ) , and joining together to put forth a strong face internationally ( harkening back to the [PER Aznar  ] days , when the [ORG PP  ] says [LOC Spain  ] had more prestige both within the [ORG European Union  ] as well as on the wider international stage ) . 
Nonetheless , while government popularity continued to fall , the [ORG PP  ] did not pick up any support for itself with this message . 
And now , the [ORG ETA  ] ceasefire has diminished public concerns about negotiating with the [MISC Basque  ] group , and raised [PER Zapatero  ] 's poll numbers substantially , by as much as eight percentage points in one poll. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Interestingly , [ORG PP  ] leaders do not seem persuaded of the need to change the message , influence the poll numbers or attract more swing voters . 
[PER Zaplana  ] told the Ambassador on March 29 that the [ORG PP  ] base would likely carry the party in any future elections ( once again reflecting the [ORG PP  ] belief that the 2004 loss was a one-off fluke ) , and that it was important to take care of that base . 
In a meeting with the Ambassador , [PER Acebes  ] explained that the [ORG PP  ] 's platform was one of [MISC Spanish  ] unity , stable public administration , and a solid economic plan . 
The [ORG PP  ] claims repeatedly that this platform is one of principle , whose correctness will be recognized in time by the electorate . 
Meanwhile , it continues to paint a picture of gloom and doom for the country under the [PER Zapatero  ] , with [PER Aznar  ] claiming that the " Balkanization of [LOC Spain  ] " is near , with an independent [LOC Catalonia  ] and [LOC Basque Country  ] . 
It is true that the message and apocalyptic image rally the [ORG PP  ] base [PER Zaplana  ] spoke of , a base that is somewhat larger than [ORG PSOE  ] 's , and most non-PP [MISC Spaniards  ] certainly do not want to see the break up of [LOC Spain  ] . 
Nevertheless , the Socialists' poll numbers rise. ---------- Leadership ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A key reason the [ORG PP  ] was not able to capitalize on the [ORG PSOE  ] poll decline is its top leadership , with personalities ranging from lackluster to radioactive . 
The principal leaders of the [ORG PP  ] were all close to former President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] , and are closely associated with the [PER Aznar  ] era . 
During the 2004 elections , before the March 11 attacks , association with [PER Aznar  ] was a positive , given the President 's popularity . 
His former Vice President [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] was expected to sweep to victory as leader of the party . 
But since the attacks , the team has been tainted by the [PER Aznar  ] government 's handling of the aftermath of the March 11 bombings , when it claimed that [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] was responsible and appeared to keep information on [MISC Islamist  ] involvement from the public. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Rajoy  ] is generally considered a competent and intelligent leader , but not especially charismatic . 
[PER Acebes  ] , who was Interior Minister in March 2004 , is viewed in a particularly negative light because of his direct involvement in the handling of the attacks . 
[PER Zaplana  ] is also closely identified with the [PER Aznar  ] legacy , and is often criticized for his very conservative stance on most issues ( he recently commented in a congressional debate on Vice President [PER Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega  ] 's wardrobe choices , to feminist indignation ) . 
( See reftel A for more on [PER Acebes  ] and [PER Zaplana  ] . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) And then there is the ever-present former president , [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] , who carries only a ceremonial title in the [MISC Partido Popular  ] , but who casts his large shadow over everything the party does ( see reftel B ) . 
After an extremely successful eight years in office , during which the [MISC Spanish  ] economy flourished and [LOC Spain  ] 's standing in the world increased substantially , [PER Aznar  ] stepped down as party leader and appointed [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] his successor . 
Because of his success , he is still enormously admired within the party . 
When [PER Aznar  ] enters a room full of [ORG PP  ] activists , a hush falls over the crowd . 
When [PER Aznar  ] walked into a book presentation for [ORG PP  ] Parliamentarian ( and self-proclaimed " shadow Foreign Minister " ) [PER Gustavo de Aristegui  ] 's latest book , " Jihad in [LOC Spain  ] , " [PER Aristegui  ] gave a spontaneous speech on how [PER Aznar  ] had been his inspiration . 
In his first meeting with Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] on December 15 , 2005 , [PER Aznar  ] claimed that he and his think tank [ORG FAES  ] were careful not to interfere in national political battles ; yet , in reality , at every opportunity , [PER Aznar  ] leverages his past influence ( including his access to high-level USG officials ) to affect current political discourse . 
And because of his cult status within the party ranks , the current leadership of the party has difficulty setting the course. ------------------------- Underestimating the Enemy [ORG MADRID  ] 00000934 003 OF 004 ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) All of the leaders of the [ORG PP  ] machine -- [PER Rajoy  ] , [PER Acebes  ] , and [PER Zaplana  ] -- as well as former President [PER Aznar  ] speak of President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] with scorn and condescension . 
[PER Zaplana  ] told the Ambassador that [PER Zapatero  ] is full of himself and has too much confidence in his ability to maneuver politically , particularly in an election campaign . 
[PER Aznar  ] called him " weak and vacillating " ( reftel B ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In reality , while the question of whether [PER Zapatero  ] 's policies are intelligent or correct is certainly open for discussion , it is clear that the government has outmaneuvered the opposition on the two most controversial issues of this parliamentary session: the [MISC Catalan  ] [ORG Statute  ] and the future of [ORG ETA  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] united at the last moment with the centrist [MISC Catalan  ] nationalist party [ORG Convergencia i Unio  ] , working all night with party leader [PER Artur Mas  ] to hammer out an accord agreeable to both sides and passable in Parliament . 
The [ORG PP  ] opposed the agreement , leaving it isolated in Parliament with the ultra-nationalist [MISC Catalan  ] party [ORG ERC  ] , the only two parties to vote against the text. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) After the [ORG PP  ] spent months accusing the government of " negotiating with terrorists " by talking to [ORG ETA  ] , the group announced a ceasefire , using some of the least demanding language ever seen in its communiques . 
Polls indicate that swing voters are turning toward the government , and around 64% of [MISC Spaniards  ] say the government should look into the possibility of peace negotiations and the [ORG PP  ] should join in that effort . 
The [ORG PP  ] has found itself obligated to cooperate with [PER Zapatero  ] in pursuit of peace , with little hope of political gain . 
If the ceasefire turns out to be permanent , the [PER Zapatero  ] government will get the credit for peace . 
Yet if [ORG ETA  ] begins demanding too much in negotiations and the [ORG PP  ] turns against the process , it could be blamed for the failure . 
This supposedly weak president has managed completely to isolate the more politically experienced opposition on both issues . 
And if , as post suspects , [PER Zapatero  ] manages to keep negotiations with [ORG ETA  ] going until after the general elections expected in early 2008 ( or if he succeeds outright in bringing peace through negotiation ) , he will be difficult to defeat , given the continued strength of the economy and the prospect of the end of [ORG ETA  ] after almost 50 years of existence. ----------- Revolution ? ----------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Given the rigid structure of political parties in [LOC Spain  ] , barring internal party revolution , it is nearly impossible for politicians to come to leadership in a party without working their way through the ranks and spending years paying homage to their elders . 
An internal [ORG PP  ] revolution is not impossible , however: if the party continues to underestimate the governing party and fails to put forth a strategy to win votes , future election losses -- perhaps in 2008 -- will force radical change in the leadership . 
In such a case , certainly [PER Acebes  ] and [PER Zaplana  ] would have to depart center stage , and probably most of the former ministers from the [PER Aznar  ] government. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) There are several [ORG PP  ] personalities who would be well-positioned in the event of such a revolution . 
They are slightly more centrist on social issues , solidly conservative on economic issues , with wide cross-over appeal to [ORG PSOE  ] voters . 
All have extensive and successful experience in public administration. --Alberto [PER Ruiz-Gallardon: Consistently  ] one of the most popular politicians in [LOC Spain  ] , according to opinion polls , the mayor of [LOC Madrid  ] has nonetheless not been in the inner circle within his own party , and is despised by the far right wing of the [ORG PP  ] . 
He has challenged party orthodoxy on several occasions , supporting non-consensus candidates for leadership positions and criticizing his party 's time in government . 
After [LOC Madrid  ] lost its bid to host the [MISC Olympic Games  ] in 2012 , when several [ORG PP  ] politicians outrageously blamed the loss on the [ORG PSOE  ] government 's deteriorated relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Gallardon  ] -- who had spearheaded the bid -- commented , " If anyone is to blame , it is me . 
Don't let anyone place the responsibility anywhere else ; I assume it all . 
" In his speech at the [ORG PP  ] national convention in March 2006 , he proposed that his party look at the possibility of " neutralizing the radical discourse... that is taking over , and to reinvent it using a moderating message to reassure the citizens.. . 
We need to fight for the things we need to fight for , but we cannot let dogmatic attitudes carry us away to dogmatism . 
Our place is with the people , with their real [LOC MADRID  ] 00000934 004 OF 004 concerns.. . 
" With statements such as these , [PER Gallardon  ] comes across to swing voters ( and to many Socialists ) as principled , rather than partisan . 
After eight years as President of the [ORG Madrid Region  ] and now three years as mayor , he has extensive political and administrative experience . 
His controversial urban renewal plan for [LOC Madrid  ] , which has caused great upheaval on the highways and in the subways of the city , is still a wildcard , as many [PER Madrilenos  ] ( and [MISC Embassy  ] employees ) spend hours in traffic jams around construction sites all over the city . 
If the work comes out well , however , the renewal of [LOC Madrid  ] could be a strong positive for [PER Gallardon  ] 's political ambitions. --Francisco [PER Camps: Camps  ] , anointed by [PER Eduardo Zaplana  ] , followed in his footsteps to become President of the [ORG Generalitat Valenciana  ] ( [ORG Valencia Region  ] ) and regional [ORG PP  ] president . 
Since he was elected in 2003 , he has fallen out with his former mentor and worked hard to forge his own political identity , both within the [ORG Generalitat  ] and nationally . 
After he worked across parties to agree on a the reform of the [ORG Valencia Regional Statute  ] in 2005 , he has become the [ORG PP  ] poster child for bipartisan cooperation , the party 's proof on the national stage that it really can work with the opposition party . 
Though still relatively young , his national stature has grown substantially , and he seems a good candidate to move into the [ORG PP  ] national leadership in the event of a major shake-up. --Esperanza Aguirre: President of the [ORG Madrid Region  ] as well as regional [ORG PP  ] president , [PER Aguirre  ] has been very close to the current [ORG PP  ] inner circle ( and a sworn enemy of [PER Gallardon  ] ) , serving as [PER Aznar  ] 's Education Minister during his first term , and President of the [ORG Senate  ] during his second . 
Nonetheless , she retains a wider base and , because of her regional experience , a certain distance that would likely allow her to take on a leadership role in the party in a time of change , despite her ties to the old guard . 
She describes herself as a " neoliberal , " but has advocated a certain pragmatism on social issues when dealing with the [PER Zapatero  ] government , for example describing the [ORG PP  ] leadership 's insistence in taking the new gay marriage law to the constitutional court as " politically inopportune . 
" Because of her extensive political experience and national stature , she could be good transition leader in a redirected [MISC Partido Popular.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) All three of these politicians are expected to re-win their positions in regional and municipal elections coming up in 2007 , consolidating [LOC Madrid  ] and [ORG Valencia  ] as [ORG PP  ] strongholds . 
The current [ORG PP  ] leadership hopes these elections will give the party the push it needs nationally to win national elections in 2008 . 
In the two years left before the elections , there may yet be surprises that would give the [ORG PP  ] a real advantage: if [ORG ETA  ] negotiations break down , or if the strong [MISC Spanish  ] economy falters , the [ORG PP  ] could find its chance to take votes away from [PER Zapatero  ] . 
With peace on the horizon and a strong enconomy , however , on their current trajectory [PER Zapatero  ] and [ORG PSOE  ] look well-placed to win again , perhaps even with an increased majority . 
At that point , the [ORG PP  ] would have to start looking at these regional leaders to take it in a new direction nationally .
