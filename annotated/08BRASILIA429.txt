A ) [ORG BRASILIA  ] 236 [PER B. B  ] ) OSD REPORT DTG 251847Z MAR 08 [PER C. C  ] ) [ORG BRASILIA  ] 175 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Clifford Sobel  ] . 
Reason: 1.5 d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] 's March 18-21 visit to [LOC Washington  ] focused on [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to modernize its defense institutions and on possible avenues for bilateral cooperation and identified several areas for further work , particularly completion of a General Security of [ORG Information Agreement  ] ( [ORG GSOIA  ] ) and a possible [ORG Defense Technology Security Dialogue  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] also used the visit to make the point that [LOC Brazil  ] seeks defense modernization that will benefit its domestic industries , while keeping open the possibility of purchasing [LOC U.S.  ] fighter aircraft . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] coverage of the visit , however , has largely ignored the real possibilities for cooperation and focused on [PER Jobim  ] 's advocacy of a [MISC South American  ] Defense Council ( [ORG SADC  ] ) . 
In meetings with [PER Secretaries Rice  ] and [PER Gates  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor SIPDIS Hadley  ] , [PER Jobim  ] remained cautious on enhancing bilateral defense cooperation , reflecting the more negative approach of the [ORG Ministry for External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) which had sought to curtail [PER Jobim  ] 's trip and to inhibit the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] dialogue on defense issues . 
While there are good prospects to improve our defense relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] , [ORG MRE  ] obstruction will continue to be a problem . 
Our best avenues for progress will be through completing the [ORG GSOIA  ] ( to which the [ORG MRE  ] does not object ) , to look for opportunities to underline that [LOC Brazil  ] will have the same access to [LOC U.S.  ] military technology as other friendly nations and to try to get high level support within the [MISC Brazilian  ] government for the [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) , which would allow the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] to pursue cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] military without the current [ORG MRE  ] veto . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As reported in ref b , [MISC Brazilian  ] Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] focused on [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to modernize its defense institutions and on possibilities for bilateral cooperation . 
Coming out of [PER Jobim  ] 's meetings , Mission has identified several priorities for the bilateral defense relationship , including the [ORG DCA  ] , [ORG GSOIA  ] , the [ORG Defense Techology Security Dialogue  ] , a possible visit by [ORG Air Force Science Officers  ] and closer engagement on Joint matters . 
[PER Jobim  ] did not , however , express optimism about the [ORG DCA  ] , even though the [ORG MOD  ] has cleared on the current draft of the text . 
The current [ORG DCA  ] draft is with the [ORG MRE  ] , which seems in no hurry to act on it . 
Separately , [ORG MRE  ] political military advisor [PER Marcos Pinta Gama  ] expressed the view that the [ORG DCA  ] would require high level intervention and should be a deliverable for a future Ministerial level meeting . 
On defense modernization , [PER Jobim  ] 's message was clear: [LOC Brazil  ] 's priority will be to benefit its domestic defense industries . 
Purchases from [LOC U.S.  ] suppliers will be most competitive when they enable [MISC Brazilian  ] production of future military systems . 
[PER Jobim  ] understands the need for improving [LOC Brazil  ] 's military capabilities , but will seek to do so in the context of independent domestic production. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Air Force  ] presentation on the [MISC F35  ] impressed the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation , both with the aircraft 's capabilities and the cooperative approach being used for its production . 
[PER Jobim  ] did , however , express reservations about the plane 's cost and the degree to which [MISC Brazilian  ] industries would benefit . 
This will be the determining factor for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
If there would be a possibility for integration of [MISC Brazilian  ] made hardware or weapons , the [MISC F35  ] would be a leading candidate for [LOC Brazil  ] 's next generation fighter . 
[MISC Pinta Gama  ] underlined that [LOC Brazil  ] will not be making a decision immediately , but in the context of requirements derived from the [ORG Defense Modernization Plan  ] , to be completed in September . 
At the same time , he expressed a lack of confidence in Minister for Planning [PER Unger  ] 's leadership of defense planning , indicating that [PER Jobim  ] would do better. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] coverage of the visit has focused on [PER Jobim  ] 's advocacy for the proposed [ORG SADC  ] based on the assumption that the [LOC U.S.  ] would oppose such an organization . 
[ORG BRASILIA  ] 00000429 002 OF 002 Folha of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] commented that the [ORG SADC  ] did not make sense as its purpose seemed to be to exclude the [LOC U.S.  ] Working level [MISC Brazilian  ] staffers accompanying [PER Jobim  ] expressed surprise that the [LOC U.S.  ] reaction to the [ORG SADC  ] proposal was positive because of a divergence of views on what the [ORG SADC  ] could do . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] views a [ORG SADC  ] as a means to improve [MISC South American  ] military cooperation and facilitate peacekeeping , on the model of the [ORG African Union  ] , the [MISC Brazilians  ] see its value more in terms of reinforcing [MISC Brazilian  ] leadership , moderating [LOC Venezuela  ] President [PER Chavez  ] and facilitating common military production ( primarily in [LOC Brazil  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While the [PER Jobim  ] visit served to clarify the prospects for future [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] military cooperation , [PER Jobim  ] remained reserved on the subject . 
While he told [MISC SecDef Gates  ] that he wanted to strength the defense relationship , he also stuck to rather shopworn talking points on why the [LOC U.S.  ] made this difficult . 
He dusted off the complaint that [LOC U.S.  ] refusal to allow [LOC U.S.  ] origin components in the [MISC Super Tucano  ] aircraft to be sold to [LOC Venezuela  ] led to [PER Chavez  ] purchase of much higher tech [MISC Russian  ] fighters . 
In his public remarks at [ORG CSIS  ] , [PER Jobim  ] avoided the subject of defense cooperation and stuck to recent history and the [ORG SADC  ] proposal . 
It is likely that on his own [PER Jobim  ] would have been more forward leaning on defense cooperation but was somewhat constrained by the [ORG MRE  ] ( which sent a " handler " along for the trip ) . 
As [PER Jobim  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] in February ( ref a ) , he had pushed the [MISC Brazil-France  ] [ORG SOFA  ] through over [ORG MRE  ] objections . 
As a result , the [ORG MRE  ] is now keeping a closer watch on [PER Jobim  ] as seen by the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy 's foot dragging over scheduling [PER Jobim  ] 's visit . 
While [PER Jobim  ] was telling Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that he wanted a full schedule , including the visit to [LOC Norfolk  ] and meetings with representatives of [LOC U.S.  ] defense industries , the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy in [LOC Washington  ] was telling us that the visit would be curtailed . 
[PER Jobim  ] 's chief of staff , [PER Murilo Barboza  ] told embassy officers that the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy had made several attempts to change the Minister 's schedule in favor of a shorter , less substantive visit. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) EMBASSY COMMENT: Given the resistance from the [ORG MRE  ] to the development of the bilateral defense relationship , the most effective way forward will be to pick the low hanging fruit , i.e. to push forward with areas of cooperation which the [ORG MRE  ] will support . 
Specifically , a [ORG GSOIA  ] and the beginning of a [ORG Defense Technology Security Dialogue  ] should be first steps . 
The [MISC Brazilians  ] are interested in the [ORG Security Dialogue  ] as a means to improve their effectiveness in gaining access to [LOC U.S.  ] technology through better compliance with [LOC U.S.  ] export control regulations . 
While pursuing these items , we should also continue to urge completion of the [ORG DCA  ] , looking for high-level opportunities to make the case . 
The main advantage of the [ORG DCA  ] will be to allow the [ORG MOD  ] and DoD to work together on supplementary protocols that could enhance the already good cooperation at the forces level without having to rely on case by case approvals from the [ORG MRE  ] . 
END COMMENT .
