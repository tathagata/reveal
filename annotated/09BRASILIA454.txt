SECSTATE  ] 31102 B. 08 [LOC BRASILIA  ] 1312 Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION LISA KUBISKE , REASONS 1.4 B , D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Charge delivered assistance request ( ref A ) on April 8 to Ambassador [PER Roberto Jaguaribe  ] , Under Secretary for Political Affairs , who had recently returned from the [ORG Hague Conference  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In response to the specific requests , he noted that the [MISC Brazilian  ] congress recently reduced the foreign technical assistance budget , although that did not rule out seeking funding , but he estimated [LOC Brazil  ] 's capacity to make a cash contribution as " very low . 
" On food contributions , [PER Jaguaribe  ] said it might be possible and he would get back to us . 
There are three main obstacles to overcome with regard to the assistance requests: a ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's budget , b ) political receptivity , and c ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's difficulty in " buying into something it did not formulate . 
" " [LOC Brazil  ] is not a relevant actor " - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Jaguaribe  ] shared with Charge a few observations about [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , in part based on his participation at the [ORG Hague Conference  ] . 
Noting that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is " remote and distant " for [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Jaguaribe  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] follows developments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] but is not " a relevant actor , " although were [LOC Afghanistan  ] to open an embassy in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] would give consideration to opening one in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
He said the new [LOC U.S.  ] policy has many positive elements , and the [ORG USG  ] was correct to identify a need for a very broad regional stategy . 
He said it is very important to incorporate [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's neighbors into the strategy , above all [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
It was a positive development that Special Envoy [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] spoke with [MISC Iranian  ] representatives recently , and this should be continued . 
[LOC Iran  ] could turn out to be the most important player in the process , he added . 
Security for whom ? - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Afghanistan  ] needs internal political support to succeed since a military solution will never be definitive , and military action must complement the goal of greater internal political strength , [PER Jaguaribe  ] commented . 
Military actions in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] erode rather than fortify internal political strength , he added , although he conceded that the [LOC U.S.  ] has better information than [LOC Brazil  ] about the situation on the ground . 
He recommended looking for ways to expand President [PER Karzai  ] 's political base ; " Security for whom ? 
" he asked , suggesting that security for the goverment and the capital are insufficient conditions to build the broad support that success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] requires. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As with earlier requests ( ref B ) , Mission does not expect any further response from the GOB on this matter .
