[PER Fassi Fihri  ] said the [MISC Serbian  ] [ORG Foreign Minister  ] has also requested a meeting . 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Welch  ] began by underscoring that this is an important year for the region and that the President is determined to make progress on the [ORG MEPP  ] . 
[PER Welch  ] briefed the King and the Minister on the process and assured them that the [MISC Israelis  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] are making progress , but the public is unaware of it . 
On [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Welch  ] averred that [MISC Israeli  ] Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] is focused on the least bad option . 
For his part , the King expressed deep concern about the humanitarian situation in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[LOC LEBANON  ] ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to the continuing leadership vacuum in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER A/S Welch  ] said that we see three options: 1 ) to continue efforts to elect a President by consensus ; 2 ) to elect a President with 50 percent of the vote plus one ; or 3 ) to support the [ORG Siniora  ] government . 
[PER Welch  ] indicated that we increasingly believe the third option affords the best means to support [LOC Lebanon  ] , s institutions . 
Asked about [ORG Arab League  ] Secretary General [PER Amr Moussa  ] 's visit to [LOC Beirut  ] , [PER Fassi Fihri  ] SIPDIS characterized it as 'a catastrophe.' 
[LOC SYRIA  ] AND THE [ORG ARAB LEAGUE  ] SUMMIT -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Noting that Kings [PER Mohammed VI  ] and [PER Abdullah II  ] of [LOC Jordan  ] had come to power at approximately the same time as RABAT 00000185 002 OF 003 President [PER Bashar al-Assad  ] , [PER Welch  ] decried [LOC Syria  ] , s lost opportunities . 
[PER Welch  ] said that he understood that the [MISC Syrian  ] Foreign Minister would be in [LOC Marrakech  ] on February 26 to deliver an invitation to the [LOC Arab Summit  ] in [LOC Damascus  ] , and [PER Welch  ] predicted that attendance would be poor . 
The King said he understood that the [ORG Emir  ] of [LOC Kuwait  ] did not plan to attend , implying that [LOC Morocco  ] would be represented at the ministerial level at best . 
[LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Welch  ] asked if he might say a few words about [LOC Iran  ] and its pursuit of nuclear weapons . 
The King responded that he understood that [LOC Iran  ] had suspended its nuclear weapons program . 
[PER Welch  ] thanked the King for the opportunity to clarify , declaring that the [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence estimate had been misunderstood and that the reporting on this issue has been unclear . 
[PER Welch  ] said that we continued to believe that [LOC Iran  ] was pursuing nuclear weapons ; so President [PER Bush  ] was seeking a middle ground " between the bomb and bombing , " without giving up any option . 
Diplomatic pressure is best for now . 
When the King asked what that middle ground might look like , [PER Welch  ] said that more Security Council-approved sanctions loom and that [LOC Iran  ] must accept a diplomatic solution . 
[LOC ALGERIA  ] ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The conversation then turned to [LOC Algeria  ] , and [PER Welch  ] asked if the [ORG GOM  ] had any views on President [PER Abdelaziz Bouteflika  ] , s plans . 
The King said he understood that [PER Bouteflika  ] was amending the [MISC Constitution  ] to permit a third term , and [PER Welch  ] noted wryly that [PER Bouteflika  ] was doing so without [MISC Syrian  ] assistance . 
The King praised the " frustrated " [MISC Algerian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Rabat  ] for his tireless efforts to improve bilateral relations , stating , &We have no relations with [LOC Algeria  ] , except for limited cooperation on security issues . 
" In spite of obvious opportunities for cooperation in agriculture , energy and a host of other areas , President [PER Bouteflika  ] and his government clearly prefer the status quo . 
The King noted that he had even traveled to [LOC Algiers  ] to try to break the impasse , but the [ORG GOA  ] continues to insist on the [LOC Western Sahara  ] issue being resolved before proceeding with other bilateral or regional initiatives . 
[LOC WESTERN SAHARA  ] -------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The King and [PER Fassi Fihri  ] expressed grave concern about the [ORG POLISARIO  ] 's stated plans to move people into the area east of the berm . 
The King said bluntly that [LOC Morocco  ] could not allow that . 
Praising the King , s autonomy initiative , [PER Welch  ] urged the [ORG GOM  ] to press ahead with the [LOC Manhasset  ] talks . 
He said support for [LOC Morocco  ] , s position is growing ever so slowly . 
Separately , [PER Welch  ] cautioned the King 's intelligence chief against militarization of the dispute . 
[LOC MAURITANIA  ] ---------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Looking at [LOC Western Sahara  ] 's neighbor [LOC Mauritania  ] , the King stressed that [LOC Mauritania  ] needs help and that he will see the [MISC Mauritanian  ] President in [LOC Dakar  ] . 
[MISC AMERICAN SCHOOLS  ] ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Welch  ] took advantage of a few private minutes with [PER Fassi Fihri  ] to underscore the need for an agreement on the status of the [MISC American  ] schools in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
Noting that he had attended the [ORG Rabat American School  ] ( [ORG RAS  ] ) as a child , [PER Welch  ] said if a solution is not found soon that [ORG RAS  ] could not produce more [PER David Welches  ] . 
[PER Fassi Fihri  ] replied that he had [ORG RABAT  ] 00000185 003 OF 003 been in contact with Prime Minister [PER Abbas El Fassi  ] and Director General of [ORG Taxation Nouredine Bensouda  ] about our proposal . 
[LOC U.S.  ] HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM ------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Welch  ] also raised made the Minister aware of the planned signing of an accord between the [LOC U.S.  ] Holocaust Memorial Museum and the [ORG Moroccan National Archives  ] . 
[PER Welch  ] also mentioned that the Museum still planned to host a conference on the Holocaust in [MISC Arab  ] lands . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Although his face looked puffy , the King appeared relaxed and rested after four weeks in [LOC France  ] . 
The meeting itself underscored how much [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] views coincide .
