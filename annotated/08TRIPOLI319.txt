( C ) Summary: With [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Vladimir Putin  ] scheduled to arrive on April 16 for an overnight visit , hundreds of [MISC Russian  ] security and support staff have descended on [LOC Tripoli  ] , filling the capital 's major hotels , old city and shopping districts . 
Confirming media reports , [MISC Russian  ] Embassy officials say [PER Putin  ] 's agenda for meetings with Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] will include rescheduling [MISC Soviet-era  ] debt , and discussing military equipment sales , gas production and a possible civilian nuclear energy agreement . 
Officials from [ORG Rosoboroneksport  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] will accompany [PER Putin  ] . 
End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] will overnight at [LOC Tripoli  ] 's sole ( nominal ) five-star venue , the [ORG Corinthia Baab Afriqiya Hotel  ] ( which also houses the US Embassy ) . 
Hundreds of busy [MISC Russian  ] advance officials have managed to make time to tour [LOC Tripoli  ] 's [LOC Old City  ] and to shop for inexpensive knock-off clothing and goods in adjacent markets . 
The [MISC Slovak  ] Ambassador told the [ORG CDA  ] that the [MISC Russian  ] delegation comprises some 580 individuals arriving in [LOC Triopli  ] on six to eight [MISC Russian  ] aircraft . 
3 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian  ] Poloff [PER Evgeny Kozlov  ] told P/E Chief on April 14 that after fierce negotiations with the [ORG GOL  ] over the venue for the visit , [PER Putin  ] will remain in [LOC Tripoli  ] for meetings with Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
It is not expected that [PER Putin  ] will travel to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's hometown of [LOC Sirte  ] , where he often prefers to host visiting heads of state . 
Confirming media reports , [PER Kozlov  ] said [PER Putin  ] 's agenda for his meetings with [PER Qadhafi  ] consist of rescheduling [MISC Soviet-era  ] debt and discussing conventional military equipment sales , natural gas production and a possible civilian nuclear energy agreement . 
[PER Kozlov  ] said finalizing a mechanism for settling [LOC Libya  ] 's debt , which he put at " several billion dollars " , was a key priority for [PER Putin  ] . 
( [ORG Note: Media  ] reports , citing [LOC Russia  ] 's 2007 budget , claim a figure of $3.5 billion . 
End note . 
) He conceded that a possibility was an arms-for-debt structure akin to that brokered by [LOC Russia  ] with neighboring [LOC Algeria  ] in 2006 . 
In that deal , he said , [LOC Russia  ] forgave [MISC Soviet-era  ] debt and [LOC Algeria  ] agreed to purchase [MISC Russian  ] military equipment . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Kozlov  ] said an arms-for-debt deal had been under discussion for " several years " under the rubric of a joint [MISC Russian-Libyan  ] military cooperation council established in the late 1990 's ( see ref B ) . 
[MISC Russian  ] news agency [ORG Interfax  ] reported April 14 that the deal would include $2.5 billion worth of anti-aircraft systems , MiG and [ORG Sukhoi  ] tactical aircraft , helicopters , submarines and warships . 
[PER Kozlov  ] confirmed that officials from [ORG Rosoboroneksport  ] were among [PER Putin  ] 's delegation . 
( [ORG Note: As  ] reported reftel , a [LOC Rosoboroneksport  ] official told former Congressman [PER Curt Weldon  ] that sales of tactical and strategic airlift aircraft and armored vehicles , and overhaul of [MISC Libyan  ] naval vessels , would be on the table . 
End note . 
) 5 . 
( C ) Confirming that [ORG Gazprom  ] officials would also number among [PER Putin  ] 's party , [PER Kozlov  ] said discussions with [PER Qadhafi  ] were expected to touch on greater involvement by [MISC Russian  ] hydrocarbon giant [ORG Gazprom  ] in projects in [LOC Libya  ] in connection with [MISC Italian  ] company [ORG Eni  ] . 
Following a publicized meeting in [LOC Moscow  ] last week between [ORG Eni  ] chief executive [PER Paolo Scaroni  ] and [ORG Gazprom  ] chief [PER Alexei Miller  ] , it was announced that [ORG Gazprom  ] is in talks with [ORG Eni  ] about a potential asset swap that would give [ORG Gazprom  ] access to gas fields in [LOC Libya  ] . 
As reported ref B , [ORG Gazprom  ] won exploration and production rights in the December 2007 Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement bid round for three blocks of area 64 in the [LOC Ghadames Basin  ] . 
Local oil and gas contacts say [ORG Gazprom  ] is keen to expand its presence in [LOC Libya  ] ; media reports suggest the company 's expansion into [LOC Libya  ] is part of a deliberate strategy to further monopolize gas supplies for [LOC Europe  ] 's lucrative market . 
6 . 
( C ) Although media attention to the issue has abated in the run-up to the visit , [PER Kozlov  ] reiterated remarks reported ref A that [LOC Russia  ] intends to capitalize on a " golden opportunity " to sign a general framework agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation during [PER Putin  ] 's visit . 
Other diplomatic contacts have reported that the [MISC Russians  ] hope to exploit the fact that [MISC French-Libyan  ] civilian nuclear cooperation has not progressed to the [ORG GOL  ] 's satisfaction since a parallel agreement was signed during President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's visit to [LOC Libya  ] last year . 
[PER Kozlov  ] suggested that a [LOC Russia-Libya  ] civilian nuclear agreement could/could also be linked to forgiving [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC Soviet-era  ] debt . 
( Note: It is unclear how this would work , since the civilian nuclear deal has been characterized to us as a general framework agreement , with commercial details to be negotiated and finalized in the future . 
End note . 
) 7 . 
( C ) Comment: Following in the tradition of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's visit [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000319 002.2 OF 002 to [LOC Tripoli  ] and [PER Qadhafi  ] 's December 2007 stops in [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Madrid  ] , [PER Putin  ] appears poised to engage in some high-stakes commercial diplomacy . 
The [ORG GOL  ] traditionally uses high-value commercial contracts as expressions of its political goodwill , and is working to cast the visit as one more manifestation of its policy of successful engagement with [MISC European  ] partners . 
End comment .
