Introduction and Comment ------------------------ <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The strains between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] play out in leaders’ statements , the [MISC Russian  ] economic embargo , the separatist conflicts , and a number of other public ways , but they also play out on a level that is at least slightly below the surface: [MISC Russian  ] “active measures” ( or covert actions ) aimed at [LOC Georgia  ] . 
This cable summarizes some of the suspected [MISC Russian  ] active measures undertaken in recent years , ranging from missile attacks and murder plots to a host of smaller-scale actions . 
It is a long list , and it is very much on the minds of [MISC Georgian  ] leaders as they make decisions about how to deal with [LOC Moscow  ] . 
For many of the suspected [MISC Russian  ] activities , such as blowing up a [MISC Georgian  ] police car or plotting to kill an opposition figure -- or even the missile attack in [LOC Kodori  ] in March -- it is difficult to understand what the [MISC Russians  ] hoped to gain that would be worth the risk of exposure . 
[MISC Georgian  ] officials often tell us that [LOC Russia  ] has set out on a policy of regime change in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
No doubt the [MISC Russians’  ] would like to see [PER Saakashvili  ] removed , but the variety and extent of the active measures suggests the deeper goal is turning [LOC Georgia  ] from its [LOC Euroatlantic  ] orientation back into the [MISC Russian  ] fold . 
Even the smaller of the active measures serve this purpose by promoting a sense of instability , which the perpetrators may hope will scare off [LOC Georgia’s  ] would-be [MISC European  ] partners and/or provoke the [MISC Georgian  ] leadership into a rash reaction that separates [LOC Georgia  ] further from the [LOC West  ] . 
As a high [MISC Russian  ] FSB official reportedly told a [MISC Georgian  ] counterpart recently , Russia’s goal is not [LOC Abkhazia  ] or [LOC South Ossetia  ] , but all of [LOC Georgia  ] ( ref C ) . 
While the [MISC Russians  ] typically make some efforts to reduce their fingerprints on actions -- making it hard to say with 100% certainty that they are responsible for many of them -- the cumulative weight of the evidence of the last few years suggests that the [MISC Russians  ] are aggressively playing a high-stakes , covert game , and they consider few if any holds barred . 
End Introduction and Comment . 
Direct Military Attack ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Probably the most notorious recent incident was the missile attack on [MISC Georgian  ] positions in the [LOC Upper Kodori Gorge  ] on the night of May 11-12 , 2007 . 
As documented by a [MISC UN-led  ] joint investigation , the attack included one or more helicopters that apparently fired a missile into the headquarters of the [MISC Georgian-backed  ] “Government-in-Exile” of [LOC Abkhazia  ] , as well as ground-fired missiles that struck near other targets in the area . 
[ORG UN  ] investigators have told us privately that they agree with the [MISC Georgians  ] that only [LOC Russia  ] could have launched the attack , noting that while the final written report does not directly assign blame , “any reasonable person” would conclude from it that [LOC Russia  ] was responsible ( ref B ) . 
[LOC Russia  ] did not make any serious effort to cooperate with the investigation , claiming its [MISC Caucasus  ] radar systems were turned off at the time of the attack , leaving it with no records to share . 
[MISC Georgian  ] officials strongly suspect that a subsequent violation of their airspace May 20 was a [MISC Russian  ] attempt to plant false evidence regarding the ground-based firings , although in the end investigators did not visit the area in question. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) March 11 was not the first time the [MISC Russians  ] were believed to have conducted a bombing raid on [MISC Georgian  ] territory . 
[MISC Russian  ] planes were widely believed to be responsible for a bombing of the [LOC Kodori  ] in October 2001 , and for bombings of the [LOC Pankisi Gorge  ] , a [MISC Georgian  ] area that borders [LOC Chechnya  ] , in 2001 and 2002 , drawing criticism from the [ORG USG  ] and elsewhere in the international community , despite [MISC Russian  ] denials of responsibility . 
Murders and Attempted Murders ----------------------------- [PER TBILISI  ] 00001732 002 OF 004 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) On February 1 , 2005 a bomb exploded in a car at the police station in [LOC Gori  ] , the largest [MISC Georgian  ] city close to [LOC South Ossetia  ] , killing three [MISC Georgian  ] police officers . 
Following an investigation , [MISC Georgian  ] Minister of [ORG Internal Affairs Merabishvili  ] said publicly that the bombing was masterminded by [MISC Russian  ] military intelligence ( [ORG GRU  ] ) officer [PER Anatoly Sinitsyn  ] ( ref E ) , leader of the [ORG GRU  ] team that was subsequently broken up in the September 2006 spy arrests ( see paragraph 8 ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On June 8 , 2006 , neighbors approached a suspicious man loitering around the home of [PER Koba Davitashvili  ] , a leading opposition politician . 
The man fired two shots from a gun equipped with a silencer , slightly wounding one of the neighbors , and fled . 
He left behind a small bag that included a newspaper photo of [PER Davitashvili  ] and [MISC Russian  ] cell phone company SIM cards . 
Following a [MISC Georgian  ] investigation , Minister of [ORG Internal Affairs Merabishvili  ] publicly identified the suspect as [PER Giorgi Kurtaev  ] , a [MISC Russian  ] citizen who had been monitoring [PER Davitashvili  ] for several weeks , with one interruption for travel back to [LOC Russia  ] . 
Following the June 8 incident [PER Kurtaev  ] fled again to [LOC Russia  ] , from where [MISC Georgian  ] officials unsuccessfully sought to extradite him . 
[MISC Georgian  ] officials have stated publicly that the incident was a provocation perpetrated by a foreign intelligence service , and an attempt to discredit the [PER Saakashvili  ] government ( ref H ) . 
Sabotage -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On January 22 , 2006 , near-simultaneous explosions in the [MISC Russian  ] region of [LOC North Ossetia  ] ripped into natural gas pipelines running from [LOC Russia  ] into [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Later that day , an explosion in the [LOC Karacheyevo-Cherkessia  ] republic in [LOC Russia  ] knocked out a high-voltage line supplying [LOC Georgia  ] with electricity ( ref M ) . 
The attacks immediately plunged [LOC Georgia  ] into a major energy crisis , with virtually no ability to heat homes in the coldest part of winter . 
The [MISC Russian  ] government claimed these were “terrorist” attacks , but [PER Saakashvili  ] repeatedly suggested the [MISC Russian  ] government was responsible for the well-coordinated attacks in a heavily monitored part of the [LOC North Caucasus  ] ( ref N ) . 
This impression was further reinforced in [MISC Georgian  ] minds by the fact that the gas magically resumed just as [LOC Armenia  ] -- which receives its gas through [LOC Georgia  ] -- was about to exhaust its reserves. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In September 2006 , the [MISC Georgian  ] government arrested 29 activists of [PER Igor Giorgadze’s  ] [ORG Justice Party  ] on charges of planning an explosion outside the headquarters of the ruling [ORG National Movement  ] , intended to be the prelude to a coup . 
Evidence included seized bombmaking equipment , recorded conversations , and the testimony of ten witnesses . 
Giorgadze himself is a former [MISC Georgian  ] Minister of Security believed to be living in [LOC Russia  ] to avoid a [MISC Georgian  ] warrant for his arrest in connection with a 1995 assassination attempt against then-President [PER Shevardnadze  ] . 
His [ORG Justice Party  ] has never been popular in [LOC Georgia  ] , and it was widely believed that the party was funded almost exclusively from [LOC Russia  ] ( refs F and G ) . 
It is interesting that one of the defendants , [PER Maia Topuria  ] , has hired two [MISC U.S.-based  ] lawyers and a [LOC Washington  ] law firm to lobby [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG NATO  ] capitals over alleged rule of law abuses with regard to the case . 
Espionage --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Georgian  ] authorities arrested four [MISC Russian  ] military officers and eleven [MISC Georgians  ] for espionage on September 27 , 2006 . 
The [MISC Georgian  ] government subsequently released evidence collected over a long investigation , including video footage showing money being exchanged for documents , as well as audio tapes and transcripts of incriminating conversations between the [MISC Russian  ] officers and their [MISC Georgian  ] agents ( ref D ) . 
According to the [MISC Georgian  ] government , this [MISC Russian  ] operation was conducted by the same [ORG GRU  ] team responsible for the deadly [LOC Gori  ] bombing in 2005 . 
[LOC Georgia  ] released the officers October 2 , after which [LOC Russia  ] cut air links to [LOC Georgia  ] and began a campaign of deportation and harassment of [MISC Georgians  ] living in [LOC Russia  ] , reportedly resulting in four deaths of [MISC Georgian  ] citizens. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In April 2006 , a pro-Kremlin television journalist in [LOC Moscow  ] aired recorded cellphone conversations between [PER Givi Targamadze  ] , chair of the [MISC Georgian  ] [ORG Parliament’s Defense Committee  ] , and contacts in the [MISC Lithuanian  ] [ORG MFA  ] and in [LOC Washington  ] , in which [PER Targamadze  ] is critical of [MISC Belarusian  ] opposition leader [PER Alexander Milinkevich  ] . 
In one recording [PER Targamadze  ] appears to speak of having [PER Milinkevich  ] killed . 
It is widely believed in [MISC Georgian  ] political circles that [MISC Russian  ] electronic eavesdropping is ever-present ; this case appears to confirm that suspicion , with the eavesdroppers apparently deciding that the conversations -- perhaps doctored or [ORG TBILISI  ] 00001732 003 OF 004 selectively edited -- were so embarrassing to [PER Targamadze  ] and [PER Milinkevich  ] that it was worth it to make them public . 
Support for [MISC Separatists  ] ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russian  ] government has provided direct , if at times thinly veiled , support to the separatist regions of [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] , without informing or obtaining the consent of the [MISC Georgian  ] government . 
In [LOC South Ossetia  ] , many de facto cabinet ministers and advisors to Kokoity are [MISC Russian  ] officials -- in most cases believed to be FSB -- serving a rotation in [LOC South Ossetia  ] before returning to work in [LOC Russia  ] . 
It is widely understood that [LOC Russia  ] is paying , in full or in part , the salaries of police and other civil servants in [LOC South Ossetia  ] -- and that [LOC Russia  ] recently increased these payments as a disincentive for [LOC South  ] Ossetian officials to defect to the Georgian-backed temporary administrative unit of [PER Dmitry Sanakoyev  ] . 
The [LOC South  ] [MISC Ossetians  ] have reportedly received arms and equipment from [LOC Russia  ] , including GRAD missiles , on various occasions , including during recent tensions ( ref A ) . 
The [MISC Russians  ] undertook a number of unilateral construction projects in [LOC South Ossetia  ] in 2006 that they later claimed were in fulfillment of [LOC Russia’s  ] pledge to the [ORG OSCE  ] donors’ economic rehabilitation program , but in fact took place outside the donors’ program as well as in violation of a 2000 agreement on [MISC Georgian-Russian  ] economic cooperation that calls for economic projects in coordination with all sides . 
[LOC Russia  ] is widely reported to be working on projects to connect [LOC South Ossetia  ] to [MISC Russian  ] gas and telephone networks . 
[LOC Russia  ] has distributed passports widely to residents of [LOC South Ossetia  ] ( and [LOC Abkhazia  ] ) to such an extent that Kokoity has claimed to [ORG USG  ] officials that 95 percent of the population of [LOC South Ossetia  ] is made up of dual [MISC Russian  ] citizens ( refs I and O ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The de facto government of [LOC Abkhazia  ] appears to have a somewhat greater degree of independence from [LOC Moscow  ] than does its counterpart in [LOC South Ossetia  ] ; [LOC Russia  ] is considered more aligned with the [ORG Abkhaz  ] opposition led by de facto vice-president [PER Khajimba  ] , who despite [MISC Russian  ] backing lost the 2004 presidential contest to current de facto president [PER Bagapsh  ] . 
Nevertheless , it is clear [LOC Russia  ] has great leverage over [PER Bagapsh  ] , who frequently travels to [LOC Moscow  ] for consultations , not to mention a trip to [LOC Moscow  ] for emergency medical treatment in April -- getting there , the [MISC Georgians  ] tell us , on an FSB plane . 
Several sources have also told us that a senior FSB officer actually lives in a separate residence on Bagapsh’s presidential compound . 
An [ORG Abkhaz  ] representative told the Ambassador in the fall of 2006 that [LOC Russia  ] was at the time putting strong pressure on [PER Bagapsh  ] to attack the [MISC Georgians  ] in response to their successful operation in July in the [LOC Upper Kodori Gorge  ] . 
[MISC Georgian  ] officials do not believe that the [ORG Abkhaz  ] were aware of the March Kodori missile attacks in advance , but that the [ORG Abkhaz  ] are required to accept the [MISC Russians’  ] use of their territory for such incidents . 
[MISC Russian  ] peacekeepers in [LOC Abkhazia  ] have committed -- or permitted the [ORG Abkhaz  ] to commit -- repeated violations of existing agreements ( ref L ) . 
Support for Minority Extremists ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [MISC Georgian  ] officials in [LOC Tbilisi  ] and [LOC Akhalkalaki  ] , as well as local community leaders and political activists , have confirmed that the [MISC Russian  ] government has funded radical ethnic-Armenian nationalists in [LOC Samtskhe-Javakheti  ] in a bid to destabilize this mutli-ethnic , politically fragile region . 
Tensions peaked during spring 2006 when scattered violent demonstrations occurred in [LOC Akhalkalaki  ] in March ( ref K ) , following the murder of an ethnic [MISC Armenian  ] in the city of [LOC Tsalka  ] , and on May 2 ( ref J ) , when protesters briefly halted SIPDIS the first stage of [MISC Russian  ] base withdrawal . 
As the withdrawal moved ahead , disturbances in [LOC Akhalkalaki  ] dropped off precipitously , lending credence to [MISC Georgian  ] allegations that the tensions were being stoked by elements operating from within the [MISC Russian  ] base . 
Disinformation -------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) It is especially difficult to nail down the origin of any of the multitude of rumors , conspiracy theories , and political speculation in [LOC Georgia  ] , but [MISC Georgian  ] officials are convinced that [MISC Russian  ] services are making an active effort to spread false information designed to undercut the [PER Saakashvili  ] government and to deflect responsibility for provocative actions away from [LOC Russia  ] onto other alleged culprits . 
One particularly tangible example of disinformation serving [MISC Russian  ] interests was a “Psychological Study” of [PER Saakashvili  ] widely disseminated by e-mail in January 2007 from an address purporting to be the [ORG “Georgian Association for Strategic and International Studies.”  ] The study makes a number of highly prejudicial judgments about [LOC TBILISI  ] 00001732 004 OF 004 [PER Saakashvili  ] , and diagnoses him as suffering from an “expansive type of paranoid dysfunction...combined with narcissist type of hysteroid personality.” Post had never heard of the organization that distributed the study -- many recipients likely confused it with the respected [ORG Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies  ] , which receives support from the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy -- and a check of the [LOC Tbilisi  ] street where it was supposedly located revealed that its address did not exist .
