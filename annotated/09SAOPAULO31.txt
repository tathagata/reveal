( C ) SUMMARY: On January 12 , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met with [PER Antonio Delfim Netto  ] . 
( [PER NOTE: Delfim Netto  ] is a three-time former Minister , former [ORG Federal Deputy  ] , and currently an economics professor at the [ORG University of Sao Paulo  ] . 
He writes a newspaper column , which is well read by the political elite , and he is also an informal , personal advisor to President [PER Lula  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Delfim Netto  ] emphasized that a bilateral tax and investment treaty between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] continues to be the most important area for growth between the two countries . 
He shed light on [LOC Brazil  ] 's requirements for its upcoming purchase of fighter aircraft . 
He talked about the future of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] ( [ORG BCB  ] ) , and discussed his views on the effect of the financial crisis in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A bilateral tax and investment treaty shows the greatest potential for a growing partnership between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , according to [PER Delfim Netto  ] . 
He believes there are many profitable projects in [LOC Brazil  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] organizations could finance . 
[PER Delfim Netto  ] told the Ambassador that passage of the treaty would lead to the absorption of between $35-$40 billion worth of [LOC U.S.  ] capital into the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy over the next six years , and that even marginal [LOC U.S.  ] investment could solve many of [LOC Brazil  ] 's liquidity problems. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Regarding the FX2 program , he emphasized that technology transfer regulations have been the most significant obstacle to the sale of [ORG Boeing  ] 's [MISC F-18s  ] to the [ORG GoB  ] . 
He believes that the purpose of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's purchase of these planes extends beyond simple defensive capabilities . 
The [ORG GoB  ] wants to build an entire industry around them , for which it needs the technology transfer license . 
In his view , this is what has allowed [LOC France  ] to remain such a strong contender in the field , while hampering [ORG Boeing  ] 's bid. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Delfim Netto  ] commended current [ORG BCB  ] President [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] on a job well done , especially vis-a-vis the injection of liquidity into frozen credit markets . 
He anticipates that [PER Meirelles  ] will ride his success into the political arena by running for governor of the state of [LOC Goias  ] in the middle of this year . 
[PER Delfim Netto  ] expects the [ORG GoB  ] to continue its tradition of respecting the autonomy of the [ORG BCB  ] by choosing a qualified and independent candidate . 
He suggested that [PER Luciano Coutinho  ] , the current President of the [ORG Brazilian Development Bank  ] , is the front-runner to replace [PER Meirelles.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's relatively higher level of liquidity has helped it weather the financial crisis thus far . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , however , still faces a problem of trusting its workers , companies , and banks to spend money . 
[PER Delfim Netto  ] fears that these players will continue to save and , while this would help liquidity , it would further diminish growth in the short-term . 
He predicts that the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy will grow between 2.5 and 3 percent next year. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [LOC Brazil  ] has historically emphasized the development of domestic industries and [PER Delfim Netto  ] 's analysis is consistent with what both [ORG GOB  ] and industry interlocutors are telling the Mission with regard to why [LOC France  ] 's jet fighter continues to remain a contender , even though it is still in a design phase and technically inferior . 
With the financial crisis and looming unemployment issues at the front of [PER Lula  ] 's agenda , the transfer of technology that will allow boosting production by [MISC Brazilian  ] companies in [LOC Brazil  ] will almost certainly become even more important to the [ORG GoB  ] 's final decision on which jet fighter to purchase . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) This cable was cleared by Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] .
