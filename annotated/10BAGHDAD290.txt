( C ) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: [LOC Iraqiyya  ] coalition leader [PER Ayad Allawi  ] told [LOC A/DCM  ] on February 2 that the [ORG Accountability  ] and [ORG Justice Commission  ] 's ( [ORG AJC  ] ) effort to eliminate candidates on de-Ba'athification grounds was symptomatic of a broader problem of intimidation in the [MISC Iraqi  ] political system . 
He attributed this intimidation to PM [PER Maliki  ] 's " centralizing , authoritarian " tendencies , citing as proof the PM 's recent intervention in the [LOC Salah  ] ad-Din provincial dispute and widespread arrests of political rivals over the last year . 
[PER Allawi  ] shared details of his recent meeting with [LOC Iran  ] 's ambassador to [LOC Baghdad  ] and worried about the impact of an [MISC Iranian-sponsored  ] " resistance " conference in [LOC Lebanon  ] in late January on [MISC Iraqi  ] and broader regional stability . 
In light of recent polls that show [PER Allawi  ] and [PER Maliki  ] as top contenders for the premiership , we anticipate that they will use the upcoming campaign to attack each other 's track records . 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT . 
DE-BA'ATH PART OF A BROADER INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Former PM and [LOC Iraqiyya  ] coalition head [PER Ayad Allawi  ] told [LOC A/DCM  ] on February 2 that the de-Ba'athification process was destabilizing [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He claimed this was part and parcel of PM [PER Maliki  ] 's " campaign of intimidation " to alter the political atmosphere in his favor , including by targeting political rivals in widespread arrest operations . 
[PER Allawi  ] underscored the " irrationality " of the [ORG Accountability  ] and [ORG Justice Commission  ] 's ( [ORG AJC  ] ) list of disqualified candidates , pointing to the inclusion of [PER Iskander Witwit  ] , deputy governor of [LOC Babil  ] and one of [LOC Iraqiyya  ] 's candidates , as a particularly egregious example . 
[PER Allawi  ] 's ally , [PER MP Maysoon  ] al-Damlougi , explained that [PER Witwit  ] was a leader of the [MISC Shi'a Shaabaniya  ] uprising against [PER Saddam Hussein  ] in 1991 and had lost several brothers who opposed the previous regime . 
( NOTE: A complete readout on the de-Ba'athification discussion from this meeting was provided in ref [PER A. END  ] NOTE . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Allawi  ] thanked the [ORG USG  ] for staying engaged on the de-Ba'athification issue , and encouraged the [MISC Embassy  ] and [LOC Washington  ] to underscore the repercussions of an illegitimate election . 
Although the [LOC United States  ] was " losing muscle " with the drawdown of military forces , he commented , it should still act firmly to uphold democratic principles so as not to allow [LOC Iran  ] to capitalize on its diminished presence . 
[LOC A/DCM  ] emphasized that the [LOC United States  ] would push the [LOC Independent High Electoral Commission  ] ( [ORG IHEC  ] ) to ensure that the ballot printed on February 6 did not exclude candidates who had not had their legal appeals finalized by the [ORG Cassation Chamber  ] . 
( NOTE: Per ref B , the [ORG Cassation Chamber  ] issued a legal decision February 3 ordering [ORG IHEC  ] to allow all candidates who had appealed their de-Ba'athification disqualifications to run in the elections .

END NOTE . 
) [ORG MALIKI AS  ] " AUTHORITARIAN CENTRALIZER " ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Allawi  ] faulted PM [PER Maliki  ] for his tendency to " overly centralize " power in [LOC Baghdad  ] , either in his own hands or those of his allies , comparing it to [PER Saddam  ] 's heavy-handed tactics . 
He told [LOC A/DCM  ] that the PM 's direct intervention in the conflict between the [ORG Provincial Council  ] and the ousted [MISC Qthe  ] conflict between the [ORG Provincial Council  ] and the ousted governor of [LOC Salah  ] ad-Din was tied to his deal with Parliament Speaker [PER Sammarrai'e  ] to attain the [ORG Iraqi Islamic Party  ] 's ( [ORG IIP  ] ) support in government formation . 
( NOTE: Details septel . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Allawi  ] asserted that [PER Maliki  ] 's efforts to concentrate power would have wide-reaching implications for national security , due to the PM 's patronage appointments in the intelligence services . 
( NOTE: This subject will be addressed septel . 
END NOTE . 
) PRESSURE ENGULFS IRAQI-IRANIAN RELATIONS ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Allawi  ] shared that , at President [PER Talabani  ] 's behest , [LOC Iraqiyya  ] 's leaders , including [ORG Iraqi Front  ] for [ORG National Dialogue  ] ( [ORG IFND  ] ) head [PER Saleh al-Mutlaq  ] , met with [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador [PER Qomi  ] in late January to discuss the de-Ba'athification situation . 
[PER Allawi  ] reportedly challenged [PER Qomi  ] to prove [LOC Iran  ] 's good intentions in [LOC Iraq  ] by making a public statement calling for fair , transparent elections in [LOC Iraq  ] and by telling his " friends " in [LOC Iraq  ] , including senior officials in Shi'a-dominated [ORG Iraqi National Alliance  ] ( [ORG INA  ] ) and [ORG State of Law coalitions  ] , to respect the democratic process and not violate the [MISC Iraqi  ] Constitution in order to promote their own electoral chances . 
He said that the [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador did not respond to these suggestions . 
[PER Allawi  ] noted that he stressed the danger of disproportionate [MISC Iranian  ] interference and influence in [LOC Iraq  ] during his recent meetings with [MISC Egyptian  ] , [MISC Saudi  ] and [MISC Emirati  ] leaders , and asked those [MISC Arab  ] states to engage more closely with [LOC Iraq  ] . 
President [PER Mubarak  ] reportedly promised [PER Allawi  ] that he would raise this issue with a high-level [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] delegation visiting [LOC Egypt.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Expressing his concern about a late January " resistance conference " organized by [LOC Iran  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Allawi  ] told [LOC A/DCM  ] that it brought together [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Hezbollah  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] , other terrorist organizations with a number of legitimate political actors like [PER Ammar al-Hakim  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] chairman ) from across the region . 
Characterizing [PER Hakim  ] as " stupid " for attending the conference , [PER Allawi  ] said that [PER Hakim  ] was pressured at the meeting to drop the political solution he and [ORG INA  ] partner Badr chief [PER Hadi al-Amiri  ] had developed to resolve the de-Ba'ath crisis ( ref B ) . 
[PER Allawi  ] confided that [PER Nabih Berri  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] 's speaker of parliament , asked him to make a brief trip to [LOC Lebanon  ] in late January to discuss the conference . 
[PER Berri  ] 's representative reportedly told [PER Allawi  ] that [LOC Iran  ] had spent USD 70 million on the conference and used the event to direct proxy groups in [LOC Lebanon  ] to " cause trouble " between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Egyptians  ] by provoking actions on the [MISC Sinai  ] or along the [LOC Gaza  ] border .
