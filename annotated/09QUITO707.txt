( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy [ORG Quito  ] warmly welcomes the delegation headed by Senator [PER Bob Graham  ] for the inauguration of President [PER Correa  ] on August 10 , held on the 200th anniversary of [LOC Ecuador  ] 's first call for independence . 
While we do not agree with the [PER Correa  ] government on every issue , we have enjoyed strong cooperation in some areas and seek to continue a productive partnership. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The " [ORG Grito de Independencia  ] " on August 10 , 1809 , was not the date that [LOC Ecuador  ] actually gained independence . 
Although a group of [ORG Quito  ] citizens overthrew the president of the [ORG Royal Audience of Quito  ] ( a [MISC Spanish  ] colonial administrative unit ) on that date and established an autonomous government , [MISC Spanish  ] troops reasserted control a few months later and killed those involved in the rebellion . 
[LOC Ecuador  ] won its independence from [LOC Spain  ] as part of " [MISC Gran Colombia  ] " in 1822 , and then became the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Ecuador  ] in 1830 when it split from [MISC Gran Colombia.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The inauguration will take place in the [ORG National Assembly  ] building 's main meeting room . 
Just to be aware , at the front of that room is a modern mural by a famous [MISC Ecuadorian  ] painter , [PER Mario Oswaldo Guayasamin  ] , called " [LOC Ecuador  ] Frustration and [PER Hope  ] . 
" This mural , which seeks to capture the protagonists of [MISC Ecuadorian  ] history , includes an anti-U.S. piece that has a [MISC Darth Vader-like  ] black figure with [ORG CIA  ] written underneath . 
When former Secretary of State [PER George Schulz  ] visited the [ORG Assembly  ] in 1988 , he expressed considerable displeasure at the depiction . 
Because of that incident , many [MISC Ecuadorians  ] believe high-level [LOC U.S.  ] officials are reluctant to attend events in the [ORG Assembly  ] . 
While this is not true , you may have some media interest in visible reactions to the offensive mural. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The presidents of [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [LOC El Salvador  ] , [LOC Guyana  ] , [LOC Honduras  ] ( [LOC Zelaya  ] ) , [LOC Paraguay  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Nicaragua  ] , [ORG Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic  ] ( which which we do not have diplomatic relations ) , [LOC Suriname  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] will attend the ceremony . 
[PER Prince Felipe  ] of [LOC Asturias  ] of [LOC Spain  ] ; the prime ministers of [LOC Antigua  ] and [LOC Barbuda  ] , [LOC Saint Vincent  ] and the [ORG Grenadines  ] ; and the vice presidents of [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Guatemala  ] and [LOC Uruguay  ] , as well as 17 foreign ministers , will also attend . 
Representatives from international organizations will include the [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [PER Insulza  ] and his deputy ) and the [ORG Andean Development Corporation  ] ( [PER Enrique Garcia  ] ) . 
We understand that [LOC Iran  ] may be represented by its Commerce Minister . 
[ORG U.S. Activities Related  ] to the Bicentennial ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] has identified two emblematic documents in a local archive that will be restored with [ORG Embassy  ] funding as part of the USG contribution to the bicentennial celebrations: a handwritten copy of the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] national anthem from the 1860s , and one of the earliest maps of [LOC Ecuador  ] produced by renowned [MISC Ecuadorian  ] scholar and scientist [PER Pedro Vicente Maldonado  ] in 1750 . 
In June 2009 , the [ORG Embassy  ] sponsored the visit of a jazz quartet from [LOC New York  ] for a series of concerts in three cities , which was also linked to the cultural celebrations for the bicentennial . 
In February 2009 , the [ORG Embassy  ] and the Municipality of [ORG Quito  ] jointly re-dedicated the Plaza [PER Abraham Lincoln  ] directly in front of the Ambassador 's residence . 
During the public ceremony on [PER Lincoln  ] 's birthday , the Ambassador 's remarks linked the bicentennial of [PER Lincoln  ] 's birth to the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] bicentennial in 2009 . 
Domestic Political Developments ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Ecuador  ] has been a fragile democracy caught in cycles of political instability , reflecting popular disillusionment with traditional power structures and weak institutions . 
[PER Rafael Correa  ] was elected to his first term in 2006 by successfully presenting himself as the " change " candidate . 
He is the first president since the 1979 return to democracy to enjoy sustained popularity in all regions of the country and among a broad array of class and demographic groups. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A core element of [PER Correa  ] 's political program was convoking a [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] to draft a new constitution , [LOC Ecuador  ] 's 20th . 
Nearly 64% of voters approved the constitution in a September 28 , 2008 referendum . 
Proponents believe it will give the citizens a real voice in government decisions and expand guarantees of rights . 
Critics fear that it will centralize power in the Executive and result in drastically increased government spending. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Elections were held in April 2009 , two years into [PER Correa  ] 's term , as required under the new constitution . 
[PER Correa  ] was re-elected in the first round , taking 52 percent of the vote , compared to 28 percent for former president [PER Lucio Gutierrez  ] , his nearest rival . 
[PER Correa  ] 's Proud and [ORG Sovereign Fatherland  ] ( [ORG PAIS  ] ) movement also won the largest legislative block in the new [ORG National Assembly  ] , although not a majority . 
[ORG PAIS  ] did not fare as well in local elections , winning only 72 of 221 mayoral offices and eight of 23 prefect positions . 
Economic Outlook and Policies ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Ecuador  ] 's economic performance has been solid since it adopted the dollar as its currency in 2000 , following a major banking crisis and recession in 1999 . 
Growth has been supported by the stability brought by dollarization , high oil prices , strong domestic consumer demand , increased non-traditional exports , and growing remittances from abroad . 
Per capita income increased from $1,296 in 2000 to $3,670 in 2008 , and the poverty rate fell from 51% in 2000 to 42.6% in <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
Real economic growth declined in 2007 to 2.5% ( after a six-year average of 5.18% ) , due in part to declining oil production , but also uncertainty about the direction of economic policy under the [ORG Correa Administration.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Growth has been modest in 2008 ( 5.3% ) and early <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
By the end of 2008 , the global financial crisis and economic downturn led to falling remittances and oil revenues for [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
In January 2009 , claiming a balance of payments crisis , the government invoked the [ORG WTO  ] balance of payments safeguard provision to increase tariffs beyond [ORG WTO  ] bindings and impose quotas on consumer goods . 
The government also announced that it was cutting or restricting public sector spending , and was reducing subsidies in a number of areas. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Correa  ] entered office looking to make a number of changes to the economic system in [LOC Ecuador  ] and address a number of unmet social needs . 
His government has increased income transfers to the poor and increased spending on health education and basic infrastructure , although given weak government institutions , it has been slow in implementing some of these programs . 
The overall direction of economic policy under the [ORG Correa Administration  ] is difficult to define , in part because there are often differences between [PER Correa  ] 's public discourse - which can be populist - and his policy decisions - which are often more pragmatic . 
The [ORG Correa Administration  ] is strengthening government regulation over certain sectors and increasing the government 's revenue from sectors such as petroleum and mining , but the government appears intent on maintaining an important role for the private sector even in these strategic sectors. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The new constitution envisions a strong role for the state in the economy , although a number of important provisions , such as identifying strategic sectors and including a social dimension to the definition of property , have parallels in the previous constitution . 
Many of the economic provisions in the new constitution will have to be further clarified by implementing legislation . 
Economic Ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] is [LOC Ecuador  ] 's most important trading partner , accounting for 37% ( $409 million ) of its exports and 26% ( $286 million ) of its imports in 2008 . 
The [ORG Andean Trade Preferences Act  ] ( [ORG ATPA  ] ) , which [ORG Congress  ] extended until December 2009 , has helped promote a number of new , labor-intensive export industries in [LOC Ecuador  ] , such as flowers and processed vegetables . 
The Government of [LOC Ecuador  ] estimates that [ORG ATPA  ] supports 350,000 jobs in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] companies and individuals have invested in a wide range of [MISC Ecuadorian  ] industries . 
Investors in regulated sectors such as petroleum and electricity have a number of investment disputes , while those in more lightly regulated sectors have had relatively few disputes . 
The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] have a bilateral investment treaty , and several [LOC U.S.  ] investors have filed for international arbitration with the [ORG World Bank 's International Center  ] for the [ORG Settlement of Investment Disputes  ] ( [ORG ICSID  ] ) under the treaty . 
On July 12 , 2009 President [PER Correa  ] issued a decree in which [LOC Ecuador  ] formally withdrew from [ORG ICSID  ] . 
This decision does not affect arbitration cases that [ORG ICSID  ] already has under consideration . 
[LOC Ecuador  ] Foreign Policy ---------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Correa  ] controls [LOC Ecuador  ] 's foreign policy decision-making . 
His main foreign policy strategies are to establish and maintain constructive relations with a wide variety of countries and to promote [MISC Latin American  ] integration . 
His goal is to strengthen [MISC South American  ] institutions and expand the number of [LOC Ecuador  ] 's political and commercial partners ( which also reduces its dependence on the [LOC United States  ] ) , while protecting the country 's national sovereignty. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The regional organizations where [LOC Ecuador  ] is most active are the nascent [ORG Union of South American Nations  ] ( [ORG UNASUR  ] ) and the [MISC Venezuelan-led Bolivarian Alternative  ] for the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG ALBA  ] ) . 
[LOC Ecuador  ] will assume the presidency of [ORG UNASUR  ] the morning of the same day of [PER Correa  ] 's inauguration , August 10 . 
There has been friction between [LOC Ecuador  ] and other members of the [ORG Andean Community  ] ( [ORG CAN  ] ) , but it remains a member of that grouping . 
[LOC Ecuador  ] also supports the [ORG Bank of the South  ] and the new council of [MISC South American  ] defense ministers . 
In addition , it participates in [ORG Rio Group  ] meetings. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the region , the [PER Correa  ] administration enjoys good relations with [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Chile  ] , in addition to [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Correa  ] has made a number of visits to [LOC Europe  ] , particularly [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Italy  ] ( which have large numbers of [MISC Ecuadorian  ] immigrants ) , [LOC Belgium  ] ( where he once studied and the birthplace of his wife ) , and [LOC France  ] . 
In addition , President [PER Correa  ] has demonstrated an interest in strengthening bilateral relations with [LOC China  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] . 
He traveled to [LOC China  ] in November 2007 and [LOC Iran  ] in December 2008 , and plans to visit [LOC Russia  ] in October 2009. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Correa  ] remains unwilling at this point to reestablish diplomatic relations with [LOC Colombia  ] , despite ongoing mediation efforts by the [ORG Organization of American States  ] . 
The [ORG GOE  ] set five conditions that [LOC Colombia  ] must meet before resuming diplomatic relations , including ending what it considers a [MISC Colombian  ] information campaign against [LOC Ecuador  ] and handing over the information found on the computers at the site of the attack on March 1 , 2008 . 
Also , since July 13 , [LOC Ecuador  ] has applied a foreign exchange safeguard measure to [MISC Colombian  ] imports , as a measure to " protect [MISC Ecuadorian  ] products from [LOC Colombia  ] 's currency devaluation . 
" Despite the break in relations and [LOC Ecuador  ] 's protectionist measures , commercial ties remain strong and consular operations continue in both countries . 
[ORG U.S.- Ecuador Relations  ] ----------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] is cooperating with [LOC Ecuador  ] in a number of areas where we share interests , including poverty reduction , counter-narcotics , and environmental protection . 
The low point of our relationship under the [PER Correa  ] administration was in February , when [PER Correa  ] expelled two [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats following the suspension of assistance to two specialized police units as a result of disagreement over implementation of long-standing procedures under which the two countries jointly vet personnel to ensure their integrity before sensitive information is shared with them . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] are currently moving ahead to conclude agreements to formalize and re-initiate some areas of cooperation with the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] police. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] launched a Bilateral [ORG Dialogue  ] with [LOC Ecuador  ] in November 2008 during which we discussed cooperation in human development and poverty reduction , economic development , commerce and investment , and migratory issues . 
When Foreign Minister [PER Fander Falconi  ] met with the Secretary of State on June 12 in [LOC Washington  ] , the two agreed to continue the [ORG Dialogue  ] . 
Preparations have begun for the second plenary session , likely to occur in late October . 
The [ORG GOE  ] recently proposed adding a security pillar to the [ORG Dialogue  ] agenda . 
Our objectives for the [ORG Dialogue  ] include emphasizing publicly and privately the breadth of our cooperation , advancing current areas and exploring new areas of cooperation . 
We do not consider it a negotiating forum . 
Security -------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Ecuador  ] 's greatest security challenge remains the presence of [MISC Colombian  ] illegal armed groups , principally elements of the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) , in its northern border region . 
The [ORG FARC  ] is believed to use [MISC Ecuadorian  ] territory for rest , recuperation , resupply , and training . 
The [ORG Correa Administration  ] , while maintaining the country 's traditional neutrality with respect to the [MISC Colombian  ] conflict , has opposed armed encroachments across its borders . 
While there have been some notable successes in this effort , insufficient resources and the challenging border region terrain have made it difficult to thwart cross-border incursions. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) USG efforts in the area aim to prevent spillover of drug cultivation and trafficking and illegal armed group activity into [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
They include development assistance to improve the quality of life and spur licit economic growth ; counter-narcotics aid to curb smuggling of precursor chemicals , cocaine , and heroin ; and military-to-military assistance to strengthen [LOC Ecuador  ] 's ability to secure its northern border and control its territorial waters . 
Refugee Issues -------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( U ) The [ORG UN High Commissioner for Refugees  ] ( [ORG UNHCR  ] ) estimates there are at least 180,000 persons of concern in the northern provinces of [LOC Ecuador  ] who have fled [LOC Colombia  ] due to violence or threat of violence . 
In 2009 , the [ORG State Department  ] provided over $1 million in funding for refugees in [LOC Ecuador  ] to [ORG UNHCR  ] , and another $1.5 million to the [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] ( [ORG IOM  ] ) , the [ORG World Food Program  ] , and a handful of [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] carries out direct assistance projects to foster development , while [ORG IOM  ] focuses on emergency assistance and local capacity building . 
Since April 2009 , the [ORG GOE  ] has been implementing its [ORG Enhanced Registration Program  ] , a process by which it hopes to register 50,000 [MISC Colombian  ] refugees by the end of 2009. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOE  ] 's June 20 , 2008 announcement that it would drop the tourist visa requirement for all nationalities has encouraged an inflow of migrants , adding to the current presence of small immigrant populations from countries such as [LOC China  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] . 
The new 90 day visa waiver has also created numerous humanitarian problems , including an increase in human smuggling , counterfeiting of travel documents , forced labor and corruption . 
DHS has already documented an increase of migrants wishing to use [LOC Ecuador  ] as a stopping point on the way to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG Counter-Narcotics Cooperation and Military Support  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Ecuadorian  ] leaders have identified narcotics traffickers and other criminal organizations as threats to national sovereignty , and are focusing the police , military , judiciary and others on disrupting and dismantling these organizations . 
Since 2001 the Embassy 's [ORG Narcotics Affairs Section  ] has provided almost $94 million of [ORG State Department  ] funds to enhance the capacity of the anti-narcotics police throughout [LOC Ecuador  ] , assist the military in providing security for citizens and protecting [LOC Ecuador  ] 's sovereignty on the northern and maritime borders , and improve the criminal justice system . 
The [ORG Military Group  ] has also provided an additional $20 million to the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] military to enhance its operational capacity in the northern border region. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Manta Forward Operating Location  ] ( [ORG FOL  ] ) was an important asset in our regional counter-narcotics efforts . 
President [PER Correa  ] campaigned on a platform that the [ORG FOL  ] violated [LOC Ecuador  ] 's sovereignty . 
On July 29 , 2008 , the [ORG GOE  ] sent a diplomatic note notifying the [LOC U.S.  ] that it would not extend the agreement when it expired on November 11 , 2009 . 
The [LOC United States  ] flew the last counter-narcotics flight on July 17 , 2009 and will turn over the facility on September 18 , 2009 . 
Development Programs -------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( U ) The [LOC U.S.  ] has supported [LOC Ecuador  ] 's development since 1942 , working especially through [ORG USAID  ] in education , health and family planning , environment , agriculture , micro-enterprise , and economic growth . 
[ORG USAID  ] 's 2009 funding is $26 million . 
Current programs focus on cooperation with national and local governments to improve stability and livelihoods , democratic governance , economic growth and environmental management. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( U ) [ORG USAID  ] 's Peace and Security program along the northern and southern borders aims to increase employment and income , strengthen local governments , and improve the production and marketing of local business clusters . 
In FY 2008 , [ORG USAID  ] financed the construction of 39 infrastructure projects including roads , bridges , irrigation canals , and water and sanitation systems , benefiting 36,364 people along the northern border . 
[ORG USAID  ] also created 2,754 new full-time equivalent , legitimate jobs in the northern border region ; farmers' income increased on average 22 percent , from $983 to $1,200 ; and 2,000 new hectares of legal crops were planted. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( U ) [ORG USAID  ] 's broader poverty reduction program promotes trade and competitiveness and private sector competitiveness . 
[ORG USAID  ] created new supply and value-chains where small producers and businesses have now become specialized suppliers for larger firms with local and international markets . 
In FY 2008 , [ORG USAID  ] invested $704,279 and the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] private sector contributed $784,564 to create 10 value chain activities . 
These clusters are in agro-industrial export sectors such as dairy products , hearts of palm , [LOC Panama  ] hats , and jewelry . 
As a result of this effort , revenues increased for 1,865 small and medium firms. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( U ) Under democracy and governance , [ORG USAID  ] has supported 56 local governments to implement participatory planning processes and improve their municipal management practices . 
More than 1,000 citizens and local officials in 16 cities received training in areas such as financial management , citizen participation , and budgeting . 
One result of this assistance was that in just three months the municipalities reduced delinquent taxes by 4 percent and in two municipalities a two-month " lightning plan " helped municipalities recover approximately 10 percent of back taxes. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( U ) [LOC Ecuador  ] is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world , so [ORG USAID  ] 's environmental programs focus on management of the [ORG National System of Protected Areas  ] , indigenous territories , watersheds , and coastal lowlands and mangroves . 
The program seeks to create economic benefits for communities in and around protected areas , providing the means and motivation for better conservation .
