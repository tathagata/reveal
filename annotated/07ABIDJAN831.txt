However , it was not attended by [MISC Ivorian  ] opposition leaders [PER Henri Konan Bedie  ] ( [ORG Democratic Party of Cote  ] d'Ivoire/Parti [LOC Democratique de Cote  ] d'Ivoire -- [ORG PDCI  ] ) and [PER Alassane Outtara  ] ( [MISC Republican  ] Alliance/Rassemblement des Republicains -- [ORG RDR  ] ) , and former Prime Minister [PER Charles Konan Banny  ] . 
The [MISC South African  ] and [MISC Indian  ] Ambassadors told [ORG Poloffs  ] at an August 1 diplomatic reception that the stadium in [ORG Bouake  ] was filled to capacity with about 20,000 persons and that several thousands followed the ceremony from outside the stadium . 
President [PER Laurent Gbagbo  ] , in remarks during the ceremony , proclaimed that war is ended and peace has arrived in [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire . 
[PER Gbagbo  ] praised Prime Minister [PER Guillaume Soro  ] for being willing to engage with him in the dialogue that led to the [ORG OPA  ] and said that preparations to hold elections would immediately begin . 
Prime Minister [PER Soro  ] , in his speech , described [ORG Bouake  ] as a " capital of peace " and told [PER Gbagbo  ] that [PER Gbagbo  ] bears the heavy responsibility of turning the peace that was being celebrated at [ORG Bouake  ] into a lasting and true peace . 
[PER Soro  ] said the peace process is irreversible and [MISC Cote  ] d'Ivoire is once again united , and encouraged internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) to return to their homes. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Communications Director at the Prime Minister 's Office , [PER Alain Lobognon  ] , told [ORG Emboffs August  ] 2 that organizing the ceremony was a " challenge " for [PER Soro  ] and said it was the result of President 's [PER Gbagbo  ] request to visit the north . 
According to [PER Lobognon  ] , the ceremony demonstrated that [MISC Cote  ] d'Ivoire is no longer a divided country . 
He said the next step is to implement the [ORG OPA  ] by restarting the " audiences foraines " identification tribunals in August . 
[PER Lobognon  ] said the issue of nomination of sub-Prefects is under discussion . 
[PER Lobognon  ] expressed regret that [PER Bedie  ] and [PER Ouattara  ] did not attend the ceremony , although they were invited , and noted that the decision to hold the ceremony was made at the council of leaders set up by the [ORG OPA  ] , at which all political parties are represented . 
[PER Lobognon  ] said the scheduling of the ceremony accelerated the issue of having [MISC Burkinabe  ] troops come to [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire . 
[PER Lobognon  ] asserted that the [ORG OPA  ] calls for [MISC Burkinabe  ] troops to come to [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire to ensure that the peace process moves forward . 
[PER Lobognon  ] told [ORG Poloffs  ] that some officials in [LOC Burkina Faso  ] stated publicly that 150 paratroopers were coming to protect the Prime Minister . 
The Prime Minister saw this as an affront to [MISC Cote  ] d'Ivoire 's capacity to protect its Prime Minister and decided to ask [LOC Burkina Faso  ] President [PER Blaise Compaore  ] to postpone their arrival . 
According to [PER Lobognon  ] , [MISC Burkinabe  ] troops may come to [LOC Cote  ] d'Ivoire , although a date has not yet been established and must be decided on by the Government of [LOC Burkina Faso.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Chief of [ORG UNOCI  ] Disarmament , Demobilization , and [ORG Reintegration Unit Jean-Luc Stalon  ] told [ORG Poloff August  ] 6 that [ORG ABIDJAN  ] 00000831 002 OF 002 the ceremony was significant because it marked President [PER Gbagbo  ] 's return to the north and demonstrated that [PER Soro  ] is in charge of the [ORG FN  ] and that the [ORG FN  ] will implement the [ORG OPA  ] . 
[PER Stalon  ] noted that the ceremony was symbolic and not an exercise in disarmament . 
According to [PER Lobognon  ] , while some in Prime Minister [PER Soro  ] 's entourage have made statements indicating that the ceremony may mark the end of the disarmament process , that is not [PER Soro  ] 's position . 
[PER Lobognon  ] said that during the ceremony , the weapons to be burned were placed in a container doused with a flammable liquid . 
He said that when the container was lighted , there was a small explosion and the [MISC VIPs  ] attending the ceremony quickly moved away . 
[PER Stalon  ] said that , in a very symbolic action , President [PER Gbagbo  ] took hold of Prime Minister [PER Soro  ] 's hand and they moved away from the fire together . 
[PER Stalon  ] said the next step is for the government to take concrete steps to effect disarmament. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG PDCI  ] Secretary-general [PER Alphonse Djedje Mady  ] told [ORG Emboffs August  ] 3 that the declarations made at [ORG Bouake  ] that the war has ended are positive , but that concrete results showing that the conflict is over are lacking . 
[PER Mady  ] said reunification of the armed forces has not yet occurred and militias are still armed . 
He noted that prefects and judges have not yet assumed their duties in the north and said that one administrative system to run the country must be put in place if the country is truly to be united . 
[PER Mady  ] said [ORG PDCI  ] leader [PER Bedie  ] did not attend the ceremony because he only received an invitation the Friday before the Monday ceremony , which he interpreted to mean that he was not really wanted . 
[PER Mady  ] , who headed the [ORG PDCI  ] delegation to the ceremony , stated that opposition political party representatives were relegated to back seats . 
[PER Mady  ] stated that only the government can take the actions needed to effectively bring about peace , adding that the President decides everything . 
[PER Mady  ] said it is important to encourage all small gains on the path to peace and said he believes the holding of elections in 6 or 7 months will be difficult , but possible , if the political will exists . 
[PER Mady  ] was extremely critical of the international community for eliminating the position of High Representative for Elections . 
[PER Mady  ] said that the government bodies that will certify the elections , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and the [ORG Constitutional Council  ] , are controlled by [PER Gbagbo  ] and accused the international community of doing what [PER Gbagbo  ] wants since there is currently no violence in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] .
