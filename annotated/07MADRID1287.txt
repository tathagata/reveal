Former [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] told the Ambassador on June 28 that he viewed with great concern the " malignant affect " that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's policies were having on [LOC Spain  ] , and he was dismayed to see the [MISC Spanish  ] nation slowly eroding as more power continued to devolve to [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [MISC Basque  ] region .

The Ambassador urged that the [ORG PP  ] refrain from complicating [MISC Spanish  ] deployments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] , given the strategic importance of those missions . 
[PER Aznar  ] replied that the [ORG PP  ] had never pressured [ORG Zapatero  ] on either deployment and would not do so in the future .

( C ) Ambassador and [PER Mrs. Aguirre  ] hosted former [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] and his wife [PER Ana Botella  ] to a June 28 dinner at the residence . 
President [PER Aznar  ] said that he had just come from a meeting at his [ORG FAES  ] think tank that was attended by current [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] and most of the [ORG PP  ] leadership . 
[PER Aznar  ] said that he and other [ORG PP  ] members had been surprised by that day 's announcement by [ORG IMF Managing  ] Director [PER Rodrigo Rato  ] that he would step down this fall and return to [LOC Spain  ] to spend more time with his family . 
( [PER Comment: Rato  ] was Minister of the Economy in [PER Aznar  ] 's government and rumors have circulated in [LOC Spain  ] that [PER Rato  ] might make a strong running mate for [PER Rajoy  ] in [LOC Spain  ] 's national elections next year . 
[MISC Spanish  ] press on June 29 reported that [PER Rato  ] provided advanced notice of his resignation only to [PER Rajoy  ] . 
End Comment ) . 
[PER Aznar  ] said he was aware that [PER Rato  ] had become bored with his position at the [ORG IMF  ] and yearned to return to [LOC Spain  ] , and he believes that [PER Rato  ] may now assume a leading position in [LOC Spain  ] 's private sector. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Aznar  ] told the Ambassador that [LOC Spain  ] was currently in the hands of a very bad government whose policies were " malignantly affecting " the fabric of the country . 
[PER Aznar  ] views with great concern the continued devolution of power to [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [MISC Basque  ] region that is " slowly eroding [LOC Spain  ] , " as well as [ORG Zapatero  ] 's insistence on dredging up [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Civil War  ] past . 
The Ambassador asked [PER Aznar  ] what his role would be if , in the former President 's view , the [ORG Zapatero  ] government continued to pursue policies deleterious to [LOC Spain  ] , and [PER Rajoy  ] and the [ORG PP  ] failed to gain any ground . 
[PER Aznar  ] responded that , " if I saw that [LOC Spain  ] was really in despair , I may have to step back in to national politics . 
" [PER Aznar  ] said that he could accept a Socialist government in [LOC Spain  ] , but not this President and not this government . 
[PER Aznar  ] posited that the recently completed regional and local elections had been essentially a draw , and said that it was nearly impossible to predict what would happen in national elections that must be held by March 2008 . 
[PER Aznar  ] said that the [ORG PP  ] 's biggest threat was voter apathy , as most [MISC Spanish  ] citizens are complacently content with their personal economic situation , and that only a " major event " could shake the [MISC Spanish  ] out of their lethargy . 
During the dinner , the Ambassador gave [PER Aznar  ] several opportunities to comment on the strengths of current [ORG PP  ] leader [PER Rajoy  ] , but the President offered only lukewarm support for his successor. //ADMONITION ON WESTERN SAHARA// MADRID 00001287 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Aznar  ] told the Ambassador that the [LOC U.S.  ] should cease its efforts to work with [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] to find a solution to the problems in [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
[PER Aznar  ] stated flatly that recent [LOC U.S.  ] policy to move closer to [LOC Morocco  ] on this issue was a " bad idea . 
" The former President 's opinion was that the [LOC U.S.  ] would make concessions to [LOC Morocco  ] and offer assistance , but then [LOC Morocco  ] would " misuse these things . 
" //LEBANON AND AFGHANISTAN// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador expressed condolences for the six [MISC Spanish  ] soldiers killed on June 24 in [LOC Lebanon  ] and said he hoped the [ORG GOS  ] would still fulfill its commitments both in that country and in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The Ambassador said it is vital for [LOC Spain  ] to maintain a united front on key strategic issues such as these . 
[PER Aznar  ] replied that [ORG Zapatero  ] was weak and would cave to political pressure to reduce [LOC Spain  ] 's presence in overseas deployments . 
The Ambassador replied that much of the political pressure on [ORG Zapatero  ] in regards to [MISC Spanish  ] deployments was in fact coming from the [ORG PP  ] itself ( [ORG REFTEL  ] ) . 
[PER Aznar  ] denied that the [ORG PP  ] had put political pressure on [ORG Zapatero  ] to reduce [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to its overseas deployments , the [ORG PP  ] only wanted [ORG Zapatero  ] to better explain the nature of the deployments to the [MISC Spanish  ] people . 
He said the [ORG PP  ] would not pressure the [ORG GOS  ] on this in the future either. //LATIN AMERICA// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) President [PER Aznar  ] briefly provided the Ambassador with his view on select [MISC Latin American  ] countries . 
He said that Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos' April  ] visit to [LOC Havana  ] was " predictable , " as current [MISC Spanish  ] leaders are " sympathetic to [PER Castro  ] , Communism , and this type of left-wing government . 
" [PER Aznar  ] had just completed a trip to [LOC Mexico  ] and believes that President [PER Calderon  ] is doing a " credible job . 
" [PER Aznar  ] said [PER Calderon  ] admitted to having completely misjudged the depth and breadth of corruption in [LOC Mexico  ] and that the pervasive influence of narcotics in the country was beyond comprehension . 
Turning to [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Aznar  ] said that President [PER Uribe  ] needs [LOC U.S.  ] assistance and that recent [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congressional  ] actions to alter assistance to that country would do long-term damage to both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] interests. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[PER Aznar  ] 's lack of enthusiasm for his hand-picked successor , [PER Rajoy  ] , was noteworthy . 
[PER Aznar  ] never really left [MISC Spanish  ] politics , but a public decision to resume a political career would likely reignite the pitched battle generated by the nature of the [ORG PP  ] 's loss following the March 11 , 2004 terrorist attacks . 
[PER Aznar  ] clearly is troubled by what he believes is happening in [LOC Spain  ] and may have doubts that [PER Rajoy  ] is the man to return the [ORG PP  ] to power . 
Although [PER Rajoy  ] and the current [ORG PP  ] leadership trumpeted the results of regional elections , [PER Aznar  ] believes that it was a draw . 
The [ORG PP  ] is confident heading into national elections , but a positive outcome is far from assured . 
If [PER Rajoy  ] cannot return his party to national power , individuals such as [PER Rodrigo Rato  ] , Madrid Mayor [PER Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon  ] , and perhaps former President [PER Aznar  ] may be waiting in the wings .
