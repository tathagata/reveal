[LOC RABAT  ] 00000022 001.2 OF 002 Classified By: DCM [PER Robert P. Jackson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Following  ] the Secretary , s conversation with [ORG Minister of Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Taieb Fassi Fihri  ] , the Embassy was surprised to learn January 12 of the Government of [LOC Morocco  ] , s ( [ORG GOM  ] , s ) abrupt decision to discharge [MISC Guinean  ] junta leader [PER Dadis Camara  ] from the [PER Mohammed V Military Hospital  ] in [LOC Rabat  ] and send him by medical plane to [LOC Ouagadougou  ] . 
A January 11 telephone conversation between King [PER Mohammed VI  ] and [MISC Burkinabe  ] President [PER Blaise Compaore  ] , [ORG Security Council  ] consideration of the report on the September 28 massacre in [LOC Conakry  ] , and pressure from [PER Dadis  ] , supporters to repatriate him appear to have motivated the [ORG GOM  ] , s action . 
Believing that President [PER Campaore  ] may have torpedoed [MISC French  ] , [MISC Moroccan  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to find an [MISC African  ] country that would accept [PER Dadis  ] for resettlement , King [PER Mohammed VI  ] intended to place responsibility for continued mediation of the [LOC Guinea  ] conflict squarely in [PER Campaore  ] , s court . 
The [ORG GOM  ] supported [LOC U.S.  ] requests to keep [PER Dadis Camara  ] from using contracted civilian air arranged by his supporters for return to [LOC Conakry  ] , and transported him via [MISC Moroccan  ] &medical8 airlift to [LOC Burkina Faso  ] without telling him that he would not be returning to [LOC Conakry  ] . 
Finally , the [ORG GOM  ] pledged continued support for [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC French  ] requests to establish a new residence for [PER Dadis Camara  ] to keep him out of [LOC Guinea  ] and for [LOC Guinea  ] , s transition . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] learned the afternoon of January 12 that the [ORG GOM  ] intended to facilitate the departure of [PER Dadis Camara  ] for [LOC Burkina Faso  ] by the end of the day . 
According to Ambassador [PER Nasser Bourita  ] , Chief of Staff of the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation  ] , [PER Dadis Camara  ] was aware of events in [LOC Guinea  ] , had been well enough to travel for at least three weeks , and his return had been formally requested by the [MISC Guinean  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] through the [MISC Moroccan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[PER Bourita  ] stated that King [PER Mohammed VI  ] , who reportedly spoke with [LOC Burkina Faso  ] President [PER Blaise Compaore  ] on January 11 , wanted [PER Compaore  ] to assume responsibility as mediator of the [MISC Guinean  ] conflict vice remaining angry that he had not been party to the [ORG Rabat Declaration  ] of January 5 . 
It was the king , s further desire that [PER Dadis Camara  ] not be in [LOC Morocco  ] when the [ORG UN Security Council  ] considered the contents of the [ORG United Nations  ] report on the September massacres in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[PER Bourita  ] asked for [LOC U.S.  ] support to keep the travel secret from the Government of [LOC Burkina Faso  ] , which he stated was not advised until shortly before Dadis' arrival of the [ORG GOM  ] , s intent to deliver [PER Dadis Camara  ] to [LOC Ouagadougou  ] that day. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] demarched the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] late January 12 , requesting the [ORG GOM  ] not permit [PER Dadis Camara  ] to utilize a rented airplane arranged by his supporters in [LOC Guinea  ] for return to [LOC Guinea  ] . 
The [ORG GOM  ] honored that request and [PER Dadis Camara  ] departed [LOC Rabat  ] for [LOC Ouagadougou  ] between 1845 and 1900 [MISC GMT  ] aboard a [MISC Moroccan  ] &medical plane8 in the company of two [MISC Moroccan  ] doctors ( one an anesthesiologist ) , a [MISC Moroccan  ] nurse , a [MISC Lebanese  ] doctor , and a [MISC Guinean  ] cardiologist . 
[PER Dadis  ] reportedly thought he was going to [LOC Conakry  ] and was &calm8 although the previous day , he had reportedly told [PER Fassi Fihri  ] that he wanted to return to [LOC Conakry  ] to &cut off hands and heads.8 [PER Camara  ] landed in [LOC Ouagadougou  ] before 21:45 [MISC GMT  ] on January 12. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOM  ] expressed its intent to reach out to the Government of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in support of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC French  ] demarches urging [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to accept [PER Dadis Camara  ] for residency , just as King [PER Mohammed VI  ] had reached out to [MISC Gabonese  ] President [PER Ali Bongo  ] , who declined to host [ORG Dadis  ] . 
The [ORG GOM  ] also reached out to General [PER Sekouba Konate  ] on both January 12 and 13 to reassure him that [LOC Morocco  ] remained [LOC RABAT  ] 00000022 002.2 OF 002 supportive of his efforts to lead a transition . 
The [ORG GOM  ] reportedly also urged President [PER Campaore  ] to host [PER Dadis Camara  ] for more than five days -- as [PER Campaore  ] had reportedly stated the night [PER Dadis  ] arrived. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: The timing of the king , s decision was surprising , if not entirely unexpected . 
While not in accord with the spirit of the January 5 declaration , the [ORG GOM  ] had always said that it needed a legal basis to keep [PER Dadis  ] and did not want him in [LOC Morocco  ] when the [ORG Security Council  ] considered the report on the massacre . 
The [ORG GOM  ] remains hopeful that [PER Dadis Camara  ] will not return to [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[LOC Morocco  ] , s willingness to work with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] to prevent [PER Dadis  ] from taking contracted air back to [LOC Guinea  ] , bought some time . 
Moreover , [LOC Morocco  ] remains interested in participating in the international contact group meeting in [LOC Addis Ababa  ] in late January .
