END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On 21 January 2010 the Ambassador met for 75 minutes with the chief of the [ORG Hellenic National Police  ] ( [ORG HNP  ] ) , [PER Eleftherios Ikonomou  ] , in the latter’s office at the headquarters of the [ORG Ministry of Citizen Protection  ] ( [ORG MCP  ] ) . 
This was the second in a series of meetings by the Ambassador to hear from senior [MISC Greek  ] officials about the ongoing reorganization of [MISC Greece’s  ] security , intelligence , and law enforcement agencies under the umbrella of the [ORG MCP  ] , which was formed in October 2009 . 
( The [MISC Ambassador’s  ] meeting with the commandant of the [ORG Hellenic Coast Guard  ] [ [ORG HCG  ] ] on 20 January was reported in reftel . 
) [PER Ikonomou  ] became chief of the [ORG HNP  ] on November 5 , 2009 , after the previous chief , [PER Vasileios Tsiatouras  ] , was unceremoniously and quite publicly fired on October 22 by the [MISC Greek  ] Minister of [ORG Citizen Protection  ] , [PER Michalis Chrysochoidis  ] . 
The Ambassador was accompanied by the [ORG DCM  ] , the [MISC RAS  ] chief , the [PER Legatt  ] , the ICE chief , and an LES interpreter , while [PER Ikonomou  ] was unaccompanied. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This was the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] first meeting with [PER Ikonomou  ] , so he began the meeting by congratulating [PER Ikonomou  ] on his appointment , expressing appreciation for the importance of his position for [MISC Greek  ] society , and wishing him good luck in his duties . 
The Ambassador also extended his profound thanks for the excellent work done by the [ORG HNP  ] to safeguard his personal security and to protect the embassy’s facilities and personnel . 
In reply , [PER Ikonomou  ] thanked the Ambassador for opening up a direct channel of communication . 
He commented on the historically close ties between [LOC Greece  ] and the [LOC United States  ] and praised the extensive cooperation between the two countries in the area of security . 
He stated that “the challenges of the times” required even closer collaboration , which he pledged to pursue . 
[ORG Hellenic National Police Reorganization  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Opening the substantive portion of the meeting , the Ambassador asked [PER Ikonomou  ] for his assessment of how the reorganization of the [ORG HNP  ] was proceeding under the plans sketched out by [PER Chrysochoidis  ] . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] replied that the restructuring of the [ORG MCP  ] was still in process , but its overarching goal was to organize [MISC Greece’s  ] security agencies in a way that fostered cooperation . 
He described the decision to create the [ORG MCP  ] on the basis of the former [ORG Ministry of Public Order  ] but to fold in a number of agencies that had belonged to other government elements , most notably the [ORG HCG  ] in its new form but also [ORG Civil Defense  ] . 
It was essential to bring all of these agencies into the same structure , so that they could share a common base that spurred interaction institutionally and personally . 
Personal ties were essential , [PER Ikonomou  ] continued , noting that the new Deputy Director General of the [ORG Greek National Intelligence Service  ] ( [ORG EYP  ] ) , [PER Fotis Papageorgiou  ] , was a long-time police official who formerly had headed the [ORG HNP’s Counterterrorism Unit  ] . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] pointed out that he and the Director General of [ORG EYP  ] , [PER Konstantinos Bikas  ] , have traveled together to [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC France  ] to hold discussions on bilateral cooperation . 
In essence , [PER Chrysochoidis  ] was mandating the creation within the [ORG MCP  ] of a crisis-management system of the sort that characterized the various [MISC Greek  ] agencies in the run-up to the [MISC Olympic Games  ] in 2004 , when all agencies worked together , many officers received training in modern security techniques , and many officers served rotations in other agencies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador recognized the importance of close interaction between senior agency officials , but asked how much progress was being made at integrating the new constituent elements of the [ORG MCP  ] at the working level . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] admitted that much work remained to be done in this regard . 
He cited the challenge of fingerprinting illegal immigrants detained at border points . 
In [LOC Greece  ] only the [ORG HNP’s Criminal Investigations Directorate  ] is allowed to process and store fingerprints , but its capabilities and work practices are ill suited to the task . 
As a result , an initiative is underway to speed up access to this information and to employ modern technology to store and analyze data , so that an official at the border could search against the database and have immediate connectivity and results . 
It is also essential that these databases be linked in some way the resources and information held by other countries , including the [LOC United States  ] , via the most modern software . 
The Challenge from Illegal Migration ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ikonomou  ] described the [MISC Greek  ] government’s strategy for dealing with the challenge posed by illegal immigration . 
Most important , the borders need to be defended as well as possible . 
This will require close cooperation between the MCP’s elements , especially [ORG HNP  ] and [ORG HCG  ] , and the military , including the army and the navy . 
The biggest problem is along [MISC Greece’s  ] eastern border , since [LOC Turkey  ] Is not making any meaningful effort to stop the flow of illegal immigrants across both the land and sea borders . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] said that he appreciated that [LOC Turkey  ] has its own problems with illegal immigration , which is why this is a problem for the international community that ultimately has to take into consideration the countries of origin . 
He pointed out that if the [MISC Greek  ] authorities detained a [MISC Pakistani  ] entering [LOC Greece  ] illegally from [LOC Turkey  ] , the illegal immigrant needed ultimately to be returned to [LOC Pakistan  ] and not to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Given the possibility of the radicalization of illegal immigrants and refugees indefinitely staying in [LOC Greece  ] , the government wants the [MISC European  ] and international communities to focus on this issue as soon as possible. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the meantime , [PER Ikonomou  ] continued , [LOC Greece  ] was taking some strong short-term actions . 
Most notably , the authorities were sealing [MISC Greece’s  ] exits to [LOC Western Europe  ] , especially the ports of [LOC Corinth  ] , [LOC Patras  ] , and [LOC Igoumenitsa  ] , as well as the airports in [LOC Athens  ] and [LOC Thessaloniki  ] . 
In their recent trip to [LOC Italy  ] [PER Ikonomou  ] and [PER Bikas  ] explained this approach to their [MISC Italian  ] counterparts , so that the services of both countries could conduct joint operations , share best practices , etc . 
By closing the exits , [LOC Greece  ] wants to send a strong message to the organized-crime rings , as well as the illegal immigrants themselves , that they cannot achieve their dreams of getting to [LOC Western Europe  ] through [LOC Greece  ] . 
Organized Crime Task Force -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador asked for an update on plans to create a new body within the [ORG HNP  ] to deal with organized crime . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] replied that he was in full agreement with [PER Chrysochoidis  ] that the [ORG HNP  ] needed a task force with jurisdiction over all [MISC Greek  ] territory that dealt with serious crimes . 
The [ORG MCP  ] is still studying what kind of task force to create , although its outline is taking shape . 
It will report directly to the [ORG HNP  ] chief . 
It will have divisions for cyber crime , homicides , robberies , kidnappings , extortion , economic crime , and human trafficking . 
A decision has not been made yet about what to do with counterterrorism , whether to make it a division within this task force or to create a separate counterterrorism entity . 
The task force will have intelligence and analytical sections to collate , process , and study information from casework and ongoing investigations that is centralized in a single database . 
The software will ensure interconnectivity with other agencies , especially the [ORG HCG  ] . 
It is intended to be a “small [ORG FBI  ] , ” building up from an initial group of 100 newly hired specialists , for whose positions vacancy notice already have been issued . 
[LOC Chania  ] Synagogue Arson ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Replying to a direct question from the Ambassador , [PER Ikonomou  ] condemned the arson attack of January 16 on a synagogue in [LOC Chania  ] , [LOC Crete  ] . 
He said that the [ORG HNP  ] was taking the issue very seriously . 
He stressed that the police would have no tolerance for anti-Semitic or extreme-right violence in any form . 
The police had been caught off guard , because there had not been any previous problems in that region . 
The [ORG HNP  ] has now instituted security measures around the synagogue and is investigating the incident fully . 
[ORG C/T Cooperation  ] -------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked for an update on the RPG attack against the embassy in January 2007 , [PER Ikonomou  ] stated that combating [MISC Greek  ] domestic terrorism was a top priority for the [ORG HNP  ] . 
He said that terrorist acts were condemnable from any point of view . 
Domestic terrorism was problematic not only because of its past focus on diplomatic missions , but also because of its potential to destabilize [MISC Greek  ] society . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] side knows what the [ORG HNP  ] knows about domestic terrorists , because it shares all of its information . 
He would not predict the timing of any arrests , but expressed optimism that the [ORG HNP  ] was making significant progress and would be able in the relatively near future to dismantle these organizations . 
He stressed that it was important to act as soon as possible , because the groups on the extreme left acted as “waiting rooms” for future terrorists and because of the increasing intersection of domestic terrorist groups and organized crime . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] concluded by telling the ambassador that he should not hesitate to call him directly if he had any question or problem related to domestic terrorism. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador , reviewing briefly the history of counterterrorist training provided to the [ORG HNP  ] , especially by [ORG FBI  ] , [ORG DEA  ] , and ICE , urged the [ORG HNP  ] to forward requests for training to assist with its reorganization and to instill new skills in its changing workforce . 
The ambassador proposed to [PER Ikonomou  ] that the two sides consider forming a local working group composed of senior [ORG HNP  ] and [ORG EYP  ] officials on the [MISC Greek  ] side and senior [ORG FBI  ] and embassy security officials on the [LOC U.S.  ] side to discuss on a monthly basis the status and requirements of collaboration against domestic and international terrorists . 
[PER Ikonomou  ] replied that he was positively disposed to the idea and promised to discuss the notion with the leadership of [ORG EYP  ] .
