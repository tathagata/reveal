12958: [PER N/A TAGS:  ] <a href='/tag/OREP_0.html'>OREP</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/ECON_0.html'>ECON</a> <a href='/tag/BR_0.html'>BR</a> SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE VISIT OF CODEL GRASSLEY <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC United States Mission  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] warmly welcomes your planned March 19-26 visit to [LOC Manaus  ] , [LOC Santarem  ] , [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Maringa  ] , and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
I will , unfortunately , be out of the country at that time , but the Acting Deputy Chief of Mission will greet you in [LOC Manaus  ] on Sunday evening , March 19 prior to your active schedule of events . 
During your stay in-country , we have arranged sessions for you with Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Celso Amorim  ] , Minister of [ORG Agriculture  ] [PER Roberto Rodrigues  ] , Vice-Minister of Trade [PER Ivan Ramalho  ] , and various members of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Senate  ] and [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] . 
In addition , you will meet with private sector agricultural figures and tour soybean , sugar/ethanol , and flex-fuel vehicle assembly facilities. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Your trip , arriving soon after the Carnaval holiday , comes at a transition point on the political scene . 
During the second semester of 2005 , congressional deputies from [PER Lula  ] 's governing coalition were accused of accepting bribes , while officials from the President 's party ( the [MISC PT  ] ) were alleged to have engaged in influence peddling and illegal campaign fund-raising . 
These revelations forced the resignation of several members of [PER Lula  ] 's inner circle , including his Chief of Staff ( who was also expelled from [ORG Congress  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , " scandal fatigue " has set in , and President [PER Lula  ] has successfully used the slack time over the [MISC Brazilian  ] holidays to recover lost political ground . 
Recent polls show [PER Lula  ] regaining the lead in the presidential race , and he is currently engaged in a busy schedule of visits around the country - campaigning in all but name - while the leading opposition candidates from the [ORG PSDB  ] party have stalled in the polls as their party decides who to field against [PER Lula  ] . 
As we get closer to the October presidential elections , [PER Lula  ] will likely expand anti-poverty programs and increase pork-barrel spending , to cement his standing among working class voters . 
THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While relations between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] are friendly , often the [ORG USG  ] encounters major difficulties in gaining the cooperation of senior policymakers on issues of significant interest to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Eager to assert its own influence , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government shies away from cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] - unless it can clearly be characterized as a reciprocal exchange among equals . 
Indeed , hyper-sensitivity on issues viewed as infringing on [LOC Brazil  ] 's sovereignty can get out of hand and may be seen as signs of political immaturity . 
Many [MISC Brazilians  ] believe the [LOC U.S.  ] has designs on the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
Our fingerprinting of visitors to the [LOC U.S.  ] drew reciprocal treatment for [MISC Americans  ] here ; visa and immigration issues remain sensitive points. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During recent months , our ongoing dialogue with the [MISC Brazilians  ] has focused on a variety of potentially useful projects for both sides . 
We sought to interest the [ORG GOB  ] in a [ORG Defense Cooperation Accord  ] , but the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] rejected the proposal even though the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] was supportive . 
Gaining agreement on privileges and immunities to be granted [LOC U.S.  ] servicemen engaging in military exercises has been just as tough sledding , as the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] saw it as " a foot in the door " and linked it with [LOC Brazil  ] 's strong opposition to [ORG Article  ] 98 agreements . 
We are receptive to renegotiation of a stalled bilateral agreement governing space launches at the country 's equatorial base at [LOC Alcantara  ] , but the [ORG GOB  ] has moved glacially to re-engage , even though the agreement clearly serves [MISC Brazilian  ] interests . 
On trade issues , when unscripted , President [PER Lula  ] has characterized the [ORG FTAA  ] as " off his agenda . 
" In addition , in the wake of its [ORG WTO  ] victory against the [ORG USG  ] on cotton subsidies , [LOC Brazil  ] has been vocal in seeking to get the [ORG USG  ] to enact remedies immediately , notwithstanding the fact that our [ORG Congress  ] is still working on the [MISC Farm Bill  ] . 
IPR is another sore point , as it has become clear that the [ORG USG  ] and the [MISC Brazilian  ] government have different views on the degree of protection to be afforded to intellectual property . 
Only after much lobbying have we gotten the [ORG GOB  ] to: a ) turn the corner on copyright piracy , and b ) persuaded policymakers to seek negotiated solutions rather than compulsory licensing of [MISC AIDS  ] anti-retrovirals. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , not all our conversations are difficult . 
At the personal level , [PER Lula  ] has met President [PER Bush  ] several times and the two have a good rapport . 
On issues involving matters perceived as technical in nature - i.e. , law enforcement and science ( but not the environment or counter-terrorism ) - the [ORG GOB  ] is eager to engage . 
For example , from 2003 to 2004 , the [ORG GOB  ] worked quietly with us on the timing and details of its shoot-down program to accommodate our statutory requirements ( although now a new crop of [ORG GOB  ] bureaucrats appears to be unaware of the government 's past promises ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On development assistance issues , our dialogue is positive - but constrained . 
Notwithstanding lackluster results to date , the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000478 002 OF 005 [MISC Brazilian  ] government 's multi-billion dollar poverty alleviation program -Zero Hunger - receives substantial funding from the [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG IDB  ] . 
Given [ORG USG  ] budget constraints and the fact that [ORG Zero Hunger  ] is , in essence , a cash transfer program ( albeit with conditions ) , [ORG USAID  ] support has been limited . 
Instead of focusing on cash transfers to the poor , [ORG USAID  ] has sought to target its efforts towards promoting sustainable livelihoods - inter alia , through working with small and medium-sized enterprises . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] 's Public Affairs programs aimed at promoting young leaders take a similar targeted approach . 
This difference in focus , broad cash transfers versus targeted assistance , ends up putting the [ORG USG  ] at the margins of [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall anti-poverty efforts . 
[ORG AGRICULTURE  ] ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Agriculture is a major sector of the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy , and is key for economic growth and foreign exchange . 
Agriculture accounts for 13% of GDP ( and 30% when including agribusiness ) and 36% of [MISC Brazilian  ] exports . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is the world 's largest producer of sugar cane , coffee , tropical fruits , frozen concentrated orange juice ( [ORG FCOJ  ] ) , and has the world 's largest commercial cattle herd ( 50% larger than the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) at 170 million head . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is also an important producer of soybeans ( second to the [LOC United States  ] ) , corn , cotton , cocoa , tobacco , and forest products . 
The remainder of agricultural output is in the livestock sector , mainly the production of beef and poultry ( second to the [LOC United States  ] ) , pork , milk , and seafood . 
ENVIRONMENT ----------- 9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As one of the world 's " megadiverse " countries , environmental issues loom large in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Of the world 's known plant species , 22% exist in [LOC Brazil  ] , and the figures for birds ( 17% ) , mammals ( 11% ) , and fish ( 11% ) are also significant . 
The [LOC Amazon  ] basin holds 20% of the world 's fresh water . 
Presently , approximately 22% of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [LOC Amazon  ] is set aside as official indigenous reserves and an additional 12% of the [LOC Amazon  ] should be protected in parks over the next ten years . 
[LOC Amazon  ] deforestation rates , however , have been very high the last two years , driven by strong expansion in [MISC Brazilian  ] agriculture , particularly the drive for land by the cattle and soy industries. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Internationally , [LOC Brazil  ] is an energetic advocate on environmental issues and treaties including the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
Yet , for many , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government has not met the high and largely exaggerated expectations of many environmentalists during the first years of the [ORG Lula Administration  ] . 
The early 2005 passage of a Biosafety law , representing an opportunity to legalize [ORG GMO  ] crops , drew especially strong criticism from environmentalists . 
The agricultural industry 's lobbying for expansion of the transportation network in the [LOC Amazon  ] has raised additional concern . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG Ministry of Environment  ] and others in the government have launched several policy initiatives focused on sustainable development and conservation in the [LOC Amazon  ] and [ORG Atlantic Forests  ] , hoping to broaden the policymaking base for environmental protection . 
As in other policy areas , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] is more centrist on environmental issues than much of its devoted , leftist political base expected . 
ETHANOL ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The success of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethanol program has made it a model for the world in terms of alternative energy . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's comparative advantage is its ability to inexpensively produce ethanol from sugarcane , which has the highest starch content of any plant stock . 
In addition to obtaining five harvests from one planting , cane hulls ( bagasse ) are used to produce the thermal energy necessary to power the conversion process . 
Cane also requires less processing than ethanol produced from corn -- which is the method used in the [LOC U.S.  ] to manufacture ethanol . 
According to the [ORG World Bank  ] , at current prices , [LOC Brazil  ] can make ethanol for about [MISC US$1  ] a gallon , compared with the international price of about [MISC US$1.50  ] a gallon for gasoline . 
At the pump ethanol receives favorable tax treatment from the [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
It is exempted from the largest federal tax on gasoline ( [ORG CIDE  ] ) and is subject to lower rates on two other federal levies ( PIS and COFINS ) . 
Nevertheless , ethanol prices can vary substantially from state to state . 
In contrast , gasoline prices tend to vary less and are controlled by the government . 
1 <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Since the 1980s , [LOC Brazil  ] has attempted , without great success , to promote ethanol fuel exports to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] tariffs and charges make [MISC Brazilian  ] imports uncompetitive here . 
In addition to import tariffs of 1.9 to 2.5 percent , the [LOC U.S.  ] imposes a 54 cents/gallon charge on ethanol imported for use as fuel . 
This [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000478 003 OF 005 charge must be paid by countries not covered by FTAs or other trade preference arrangements . 
Given the requirements of its fast-growing domestic market , whether [LOC Brazil  ] will indeed be able to produce enough ethanol to supply international markets is an open question . 
Some estimate that over the next one to two years , the maximum percentage of [LOC Brazil  ] 's cane crop which can be devoted to ethanol production is 54% . 
If so , this would mean that [MISC Brazilian  ] ethanol production is already running at 95 percent of capacity ; and the country 's ability to expand its sugarcane acreage is limited to perhaps 20 percent over the next 3-4 years . 
FOREIGN POLICY -------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Reflecting [LOC Brazil  ] 's ambivalence towards the [LOC United States  ] , President [PER Lula  ] has run an activist foreign policy with a focus on [LOC South America  ] and the Third World , seeking to forge alliances with other mid-sized powers ( [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC India  ] , etc . 
) . 
He has traveled extensively in pursuit of a higher international profile for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Despite prodding from the [ORG USG  ] and others , [PER Lula  ] has refused to condemn [LOC Cuba  ] for human rights violations and , in fact , has pushed for [MISC Cuban  ] membership in the [ORG Rio Group  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has also advocated a [MISC Cuba-Mercosul  ] trade pact , and has now agreed to upgrade [LOC Venezuela  ] from associate membership to full membership status in [LOC Mercosul  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has worked to increase both its economic and political ties with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Enhanced integration of the two countries' energy sectors is high on its agenda . 
[PER Lula  ] has been especially solicitous of [PER Chavez  ] . 
During the September 29-30 , 2005 [ORG South American Community of Nations  ] Summit in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [PER Lula  ] praised the [MISC Venezuelan  ] President 's democratic credentials ( " if anything , [LOC Venezuela  ] has an excess of democracy " ) and declared that the [PER Chavez  ] government had been demonized by its foes . 
[PER Lula  ] reiterated these themes during an early December visit by [PER Chavez  ] to the [MISC Northeastern  ] state of [LOC Pernambuco.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given its size and natural resources , [LOC Brazil  ] has long seen itself as the natural leader of the region ( even though that perception is not shared by its neighbors ) . 
Emblematic of [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to gain greater standing on the world stage is its tenacious pursuit of a permanent [ORG UN Security Council  ] ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) seat . 
In fact , many observers point out that [LOC Brazil  ] has " subordinated " other economic and political interests with such countries as [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] in exchange for support ( which has not been forthcoming ) for its [ORG UNSC  ] aspirations . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and other G4 states ( [LOC India  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Japan  ] ) are , despite recent setbacks , continuing to press their campaign for a vote on a resolution on [ORG UNSC  ] reform . 
This stance is at odds with the position of many [MISC Latin American  ] countries , including those which [LOC Brazil  ] believes should follow its " natural leadership . 
" 15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] has long seen international fora as a way to enhance its international stature . 
Reflecting this , in 2005 it launched failed national candidates for the top jobs at both the [ORG WTO  ] and the [ORG IDB  ] . 
The failure of both , together with the unlikely prospects for a permanent seat in the [ORG UNSC  ] , has widely been seen in [LOC Brazil  ] as a " political disaster . 
PRESIDENT [PER LULA  ] -------------- 16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] was inaugurated in January 2003 after a career as a [LOC Sao Paulo  ] metalworker and labor leader . 
He founded the left-of-center [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) in 1980 and lost three presidential campaigns before winning in the October 2002 elections . 
[PER Lula  ] is eligible to run for reelection in October 2006 . 
Elected in large part on promises of promoting an ambitious social agenda , including a " [MISC Zero Hunger  ] " program , [PER Lula  ] 's government has failed to deliver much in this area , as managerial shortcomings and the public 's top concern - crime and public security - have not improved under this administration. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As noted above , in recent months the [ORG Lula Administration  ] has been beset by a grave political crisis as interlocking influence peddling/vote-buying scandals have plagued elements of [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG PT  ] party . 
During the second half of 2005 , the crisis placed [PER Lula  ] on the defensive and politics were dominated by investigations , accusations and revelations . 
The President 's Chief of Staff resigned his post and was later expelled from [ORG Congress  ] . 
Meanwhile , several other congressmen are the subjects of investigations and expulsion proceedings owing to bribery allegations . 
However , influential Finance Minister [PER Palocci  ] remains on the job , notwithstanding corruption allegations against him - which he has forcefully denied . 
Thus far , [MISC Brazilian  ] society - including the opposition - seems disinclined to hold [PER Lula  ] personally responsible for the scandals , and he is recovering lost ground in public opinion . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000478 004 OF 005 MACRO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS --------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Lula  ] and his economic team have implemented prudent fiscal and monetary policies and pursued necessary microeconomic reforms . 
As a result , [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy , aided by a benign international environment , has flourished . 
GDP growth of 4.9% in 2004 has coupled with booming exports , healthy external accounts , tame inflation , decreasing unemployment and reductions in the debt-to-GDP ratio . 
While GDP growth in 2005 registered 2.3% -- with third quarter growth coming in at negative .08% -- economic activity should pick up in early 2006 . 
In recent months the real has risen sharply against the dollar while the [LOC Sao Paulo Stock Exchange  ] ( [ORG BOVESPA  ] ) has hit record levels . 
In March 2005 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government declined to renew its [ORG Stand-By Agreement  ] with the [ORG IMF  ] and in mid-December 2005 it announced it would prepay both its remaining [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG Paris Club  ] obligations. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Overall , while [LOC Brazil  ] has made considerable progress , problems remain . 
Despite registering its first year-on-year decline in 2004 , [LOC Brazil  ] 's ( largely domestic ) government debt remains high , at 51% of GDP . 
Real interest rates ( at nearly 12 percent ) are among the highest in the world . 
Income and land distribution remain skewed . 
Investment ( including FDI ) is low . 
The country 's sovereign risk ratings are two to three levels below investment grade . 
And the informal sector constitutes between 35 to 40 percent of the economy , in part because the tax burden ( nearly 38 percent of GDP ) is so high . 
The good news is that the uncertainty surrounding the political scandal has not frightened away foreign investors. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sustaining hgh growth rates in the longer term depends on the impact of President [PER Lula  ] 's structural reform program and efforts to build a more welcoming climate for investment , both domestic and foreign . 
In its first year , the [PER Lula  ] administration passed key tax and pension reforms to improve the government fiscal accounts . 
Judicial reform and an overhaul of the bankruptcy law , which should improve the functioning of credit markets , were passed in late 2004 , along with tax measures to create incentives for long-term savings and investments. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Public-Private Partnerships , a key effort to attract private investment to infrastructure , also passed in 2004 , although implementation of this initiative still awaits promulgation of the necessary regulations . 
Labor reform and autonomy for the [ORG Central Bank  ] were on the agenda for 2005 , but now look unlikely to be addressed until after the the October 2006 elections . 
Despite this well-considered reform agenda , much remains to be done . 
The government needs to improve the regulatory climate for investment , particularly in the energy sector ; to simplify torturous tax systems at the state and federal levels ; and to further reform the pension system . 
Given the proximity of the October elections , prospects for much of this reform agenda are dim for the remainder of [PER Lula  ] 's term . 
TRADE POLICY ------------ <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To increase its international profile ( both economically and politically ) , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) is seeking expanded trade ties with developing countries , as well as strengthening the [MISC Mercosul  ] customs union with [LOC Uruguay  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
Arguably the GoB has fallen short on this latter objective . 
The [MISC Brazil-Argentine  ] relationship is rife with trade disputes , recently leading to adoption of a safeguard mechanism for bilateral trade . 
Meanwhile , [LOC Uruguay  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] regularly complain that [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] reap a disproportionate share of benefits from the bloc , and threaten the group 's solidarity in various ways -- for instance , [LOC Uruguay  ] 's recent open discussion of a possible [ORG FTA  ] with the [LOC United States  ] , which would contravene [MISC Mercosul  ] rules. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Nonetheless , the bloc remains engaged in certain external trade negotiations . 
In 2004 , [MISC Mercosul  ] concluded free trade agreements with [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Peru  ] , adding to its existing agreements with [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] to establish a commercial base for the newly-launched [ORG South American Community of Nations  ] . 
As noted earlier , [MISC Mercosul  ] is upgrading [LOC Venezuela  ] 's status from associate to full membership . 
In addition to [LOC Cuba  ] , the bloc is currently exploring free trade talks with [LOC Israel  ] , the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [LOC Panama  ] and states of the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] , as well as trying to build on partial trade liberalization agreements concluded with [LOC India  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] in 2004. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC China  ] , which was offered market economy status by [LOC Brazil  ] as a part of [PER Lula  ] 's effort to secure [LOC PRC  ] support for [LOC Brazil  ] 's bid for a [ORG USNC  ] seat , has increased its importance as an export market [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000478 005 OF 005 for [MISC Brazilian  ] soy , iron ore and steel , becoming [LOC Brazil  ] 's fourth largest trading partner and a potential source of investment . 
However , low-priced [MISC Chinese  ] imports , particularly in the textile , footwear , and toy sectors , are now threatening to displace domestic [MISC Brazilian  ] production . 
As many [MISC Brazilian  ] observers have indicated , all this effort is aimed at countries which together represent less than a third of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign trade . 
Free trade negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] continue to languish . 
[ORG DOHA AGENDA  ] - [ORG WTO  ] ----------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [LOC Brazil  ] emphasizes [ORG South-South  ] trade through [MISC Mercosul  ] 's bilateral negotiations , it uses that [ORG Doha Development Agenda  ] ( [ORG DDA  ] ) negotiations as the main forum for engaging with developed country partners . 
The [ORG DDA  ] is [LOC Brazil  ] 's top trade priority , viewed as the last chance for perhaps 15-20 years to secure fundamental changes in international trade rules , in particular , for international agricultural trade . 
[LOC Brazil  ] leads the [MISC G-20  ] group of developing countries that is pressing for agricultural trade reform in the [ORG DDA  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's assertive leadership of the [MISC G-20  ] was blamed in some quarters for causing the failure of the [ORG WTO Cancun Ministerial  ] in September 2003 . 
Since then , [LOC Brazil  ] has been more constructively engaged in the [LOC Doha Round  ] , initially as a member of the " [MISC Five Interested Parties  ] " and more recently [ORG G-6  ] informal group , although many of its positions are still at odds with [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
At the December 2005 [LOC Hong Kong  ] Ministerial meeting , [LOC Brazil  ] was key to brokering the deal - albeit one of limited ambition - coming out of that session . 
[LOC Brazil  ] can be expected to maintain its assertive stance in the [LOC Doha Round  ] on agricultural trade reform while taking more defensive postures in the discussions covering industrial products and services . 
FREE TRADE OF THE AMERICAS - [ORG FTAA  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As indicated above , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] shows no serious interest in pursuing the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Despite serving as co-chair and having secured in the November 2003 [LOC Miami  ] meeting a new framework for negotiation , [LOC Brazil  ] has shown no inclination to move the process along and has so far declined to convoke the next [ORG FTAA Ministerial  ] - which is now overdue .
