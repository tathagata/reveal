[ORG REF: VATICAN  ] 82 [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000113 001.2 OF 003 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Rafael Foley  ] , Polchief . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The upcoming visit of the Archbishop of [LOC Canterbury  ] to [LOC Rome  ] November 21 will take place with the background of the Vatican’s far-reaching decision to facilitate the conversion of disaffected [MISC Anglicans  ] to [MISC Catholicism  ] . 
Embassy contacts approving the measure interpret it as a bold and appropriate response to the legitimate request of conservative [MISC Anglicans  ] . 
Skeptics worry that it will weaken and change the tone of dialogue between [MISC Catholics  ] and other [MISC Christian  ] denominations , and that it will accentuate tradition at the expense of accommodation . 
Critics see it as opportunistic preying on the internally divided [MISC Anglican  ] Communion . 
While Archbishop [PER Williams  ] has said that the [LOC Vatican  ] decision is in a sense a consequence of [MISC Anglican-Catholic  ] dialogue , the [LOC Vatican  ] informed but did not seek the [MISC Archbishop’s  ] approval before announcing the decision . 
End summary . 
Go It Alone ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On October 22 , POL/ECONOFF spoke with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [ORG Pontifical Council for Christian Unity  ] , which is responsible for ecumenical dialogue--i.e. , relations with non-Catholic [MISC Christian  ] Churches--is concerned about the effect of the announcement on the ongoing dialogue with the [MISC Anglican  ] Church and has resisted pressure to put out a statement in support of the decision. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During the press conference announcing the upcoming release of the “apostolic constitution” that will set the implementing mechanism to bring in particular groups of [MISC Anglicans  ] , Cardinal Levada--Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the [MISC Faith--  ] reported that Archbishop [PER Rowan Williams  ] knew about the [LOC Vatican  ] decision “a month earlier.” However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [MISC Anglican  ] leadership was most likely only notified on October 19 , when [PER Levada  ] and [PER Williams  ] met . 
Another source [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told poloffs that when [PER Williams  ] expressed concern about the implications of the announcement , [PER Levada  ] responded that the [LOC Vatican  ] had already made its decision and was moving forward with it . 
Most appealing to conservatives ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a separate conversation , [MISC British  ] Ambassador [PER Francis Campbell  ] told Ambassador [PER Diaz  ] that if many [MISC Anglicans  ] decide to join the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in response to the Vatican’s--yet to be released--new rules , the [LOC Vatican  ] could face unforeseen obstacles . 
[PER Campbell  ] cited the difference between the [MISC Anglican  ] Stipend and [MISC Catholic  ] Allowance as chief among them . 
Because of the need to provide for families , [MISC Anglican  ] priests are paid far more than their [MISC Catholic  ] counterparts . 
With many parishes already financially stretched , a large transition of [MISC Anglican  ] converts could overwhelm the financial resources of many dioceses . 
Within the [MISC Anglican  ] Church , the groups most likely to join with [LOC Rome  ] tend to be the most conservative . 
This is particularly true in the [LOC U.S.  ] , because the issues dividing [MISC Anglicans--the  ] ordination of women and acceptance of homosexuality--are more prominent in the [LOC United States  ] than elsewhere . 
Other Embassy contacts and media analysis agree that it is the [MISC Anglican  ] conservative groups that will find it most appealing to become [MISC Catholics  ] in groups that would be allowed , according to [PER Levada  ] , to maintain most of their [MISC Anglican  ] traditions--except the [MISC Anglican  ] freedom to openly voice dissent . 
[MISC Anglicans  ] who take the Vatican’s offer will be expected to accept Papal rule. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a recent article , [LOC Vatican  ] specialist and author [PER John Allen  ] ( [LOC U.S  ] . 
) concluded that “when the dust settles , the centuries-old breach between [LOC Rome  ] and [LOC Canterbury  ] will remain [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000113 002.2 OF 003 intact.” In this view , the apostolic constitution will not make the [MISC Catholic  ] Church in the [LOC U.S.  ] or elsewhere more conservative , because the numbers of converts will not be significant . 
Worldwide , he writes , there are 77 million [MISC Anglicans  ] ( including 2.2 [MISC American  ] Episcopalians ) , while there are 1.2 billion [MISC Catholics  ] . 
An Embassy contact pointed out that it is entirely possible that conservative [MISC Anglican  ] bishops may also decide not to join the [MISC Catholic  ] Church and bring their parishes with them , because they will have to relinquish their positions as bishops . 
The apostolic constitution will allow [MISC Anglican  ] priests to become [MISC Catholic  ] priests , but [MISC Anglican  ] bishops would not come in as bishops . 
The harshest critic ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The harshest public criticism for the decision has come from a former friend of the [PER Pope  ] , the [MISC Swiss  ] theologian [PER Hans Kung  ] . 
In an article published in several major [MISC European  ] newspapers , [PER Kung  ] states that “having brought back the extreme anti-reformist faction of the [PER Pius X  ] fraternity into the fold , [PER Pope Benedict  ] now hopes to fill up the dwindling ranks of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church with [MISC Anglicans  ] sympathetic to [MISC Rome”  ] . 
For all its color , Kung’s criticism is not influential with mainstream [MISC Catholics  ] , according to an Embassy contact who is himself skeptical about the wisdom of the apostolic constitution . 
[PER Kung  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] adds , comes across as personally bitter and has used such a strong language in criticizing the [PER Pope  ] that moderate reformists would not want to be associated with him or his opinion pieces: “with [PER Kung  ] , it is all about [MISC Kung.” Views  ] from the [MISC Pope’s  ] loyalists ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy contacts who are most loyal to the [PER Pope  ] and are the first to defend his decisions have explained the announcement about the apostolic constitution as the charitable response to the legitimate [MISC Catholic  ] longings of specific [MISC Anglican  ] groups . 
An [ORG Opus Dei  ] professor of theology told poloffs that the [LOC Vatican  ] was not so much acting , but reacting , to the petition that the Traditional [MISC Anglican  ] Communion -an association of churches that is separate from the [MISC Anglican  ] Communion and reportedly has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide--made in 2007 to unite with the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , provided the [LOC Vatican  ] allowed it to maintain its [MISC Anglican  ] rites. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Pope’s  ] response , the professor adds , is very progressive , because it allows for greater diversity of rites within the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , and because it permits individuals who are already forming a community to come to the Church together ( what the Church calls a “corporate” conversion ) as oppose to asking them to undergo the more daunting individual conversion . 
( Note: with respect to the diversity of rites , another Embassy contact said that some of the [MISC Anglican  ] rites that the apostolic constitution may allow are very traditional , for example in the use of [LOC Latin  ] for the masses . 
End note ) . 
For the professor , the [PER Pope  ] is redefining ecumenism ( i.e. , the process of uniting the once-upon-a-time single [MISC Christian  ] family ) by moving from the “getting to know you” ecumenical dialogue to specific ecumenical action with measures that make it easier for a greater union to materialize , even if incompletely. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The professor also maintained that the apostolic constitution does not have anything to do with a relaxation of priestly celibacy . 
Currently , former [MISC Catholic  ] priests who have left the Church to become married [MISC Anglican  ] priests are already banned in [PER Cannon  ] ( Church ) law from re-entering the [MISC Catholic  ] Church as priests . 
He also notes that , even if the number of married ( convert ) priests will increase , there will be no married bishops in the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , just like there are married priests but no married bishops in the [MISC Oriental Catholic  ] Churches . 
Comment: winners and losers ---------------------------- [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000113 003.2 OF 003 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As the dust settles , it is possible to see the winners and losers of the [MISC Pope’s  ] decision . 
On the winning side is Cardinal [PER Levada  ] , the [MISC American  ] “Faith Czar” who will have a direct say on the final form of the new procedures . 
Also on the winning side are [LOC Vatican  ] officials and theologians in tune with the [MISC Pope’s  ] preference for depth of conviction over broadening the appeal of the [MISC Christian  ] message . 
Traditionalists groups who cherish the use of [LOC Latin  ] and older rites also gain , as their practices get reinforcement from unexpected quarters . 
[MISC Anglicans  ] wishing to convert to [MISC Catholicism  ] also come out stronger , as their options increase . 
The [MISC Pope’s  ] own anti-secular agenda also wins . 
In uniting traditionalist [MISC Anglicans  ] with the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , the [PER Pope  ] is bringing together two groups strongly committed defending to Europe’s [MISC Christian  ] heritage--a theme he strongly champions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On the losing side , the Archbishop of [LOC Canterbury  ] and Cardinal [PER Kasper  ] , the [MISC German  ] prefect of the [ORG Pontifical Council  ] for [ORG Christian Unity  ] who has lead with increasing difficulty--since Cardinal [PER Ratzinger  ] became Pope--the Vatican’s ecumenical dialogue . 
Archbishop [PER Williams  ] was already in a very difficult situation trying to hold together an increasingly-divided [MISC Anglican  ] Communion . 
Among his critics who want nothing to do with the [LOC Vatican  ] , recent events “confirm” him as the weak leader they always said he was . 
Cardinal [PER Kasper  ] , who might have been intentionally spared from the difficult trance of standing next to [PER Levada  ] when the announcement was made ( he was out of the country ) , also loses . 
The ecumenical dialogue will continue , but it will be a different dialogue now . 
His ecumenical interlocutors will not help but to wonder if anything that [PER Kasper  ] says really matters . 
Finally , those who might have hoped that changing attitudes towards a variety of social issues ( homosexuality and women’s ordination among them ) in non-Catholic denominations might lead the [LOC Vatican  ] to reconsider its own position have reasons to be disappointed .
