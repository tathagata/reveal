REF: MADRID 1191 AND PREVIOUS Classified By: Deputy Cheif of [ORG Mission Hugo Llorens  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Odyssey Marine Exploration  ] representatives [PER Marie Rogers  ] and [PER Ali Nasser  ] requested a meeting with EconOff June 26 to informally update the Embassy on the [MISC American  ] company 's plans to sail out from [LOC Gibraltar  ] . 
Despite assurances that the [MISC Spanish  ] would indeed attempt to execute the warrant against [ORG Odyssey  ] , possibly leading to the detention of its vessel/s in disputed international waters , [PER Nasser  ] said the company had decided nonetheless to leave port as soon as possible. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Odyssey  ] representatives outlined a 3-step timeline for one or both vessels' departure from port which could occur as early as next week . 
The first step would be the drafting of an " Affidavit of Events " leading up to [ORG Odyssey  ] 's " [ORG Black Swan  ] " find ( reftel ) . 
US [ORG Odyssey  ] lawyers are currently drafting that affidavit which will include a declaration that in Fall 2006 , [ORG Odyssey  ] head [PER Greg Stemm  ] met with the [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] on what eventually turned out to be the " [ORG Black Swan  ] " find . 
Once this affidavit is complete , the second step is for [ORG Odyssey  ] representatives to once more approach the [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] , affidavit in hand , to attempt to reach a compromise . 
From the date of this meeting , [ORG Odyssey  ] employees will begin the third step of divesting its vessels of the expensive exploration equipment currently onboard . 
Once this divestment is complete , the [ORG Odyssey  ] vessels will set sail with an [MISC American  ] master , with representatives [PER Ali Nasser  ] and [PER Marie Rogers  ] , and with a filming crew on board . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Nasser  ] said that in the interests of transparency , [ORG Odyssey  ] will notify the [MISC Spanish  ] [LOC Guardia Civil  ] the night before of their intentions to set sail . 
If the [MISC Spanish  ] do not detain the ships , then they will sail on to [LOC Great Britain  ] . 
[PER Nasser  ] also indicated that should the [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] be receptive to compromise , [ORG Odyssey  ] representatives would offer to sail their vessels into [MISC Spanish  ] waters to allow a search while avoiding an international dispute over the waters around [LOC Gibraltar  ] . 
[PER Nasser  ] said that [ORG Odyssey  ] was also prepared to invite GoS along on its next salvaging trip to the [ORG Black Swan  ] site . 
However , [PER Nasser  ] caveated , these offers would only be given if the [MISC Spanish  ] guarantee that they will not detain [ORG Odyssey  ] ships . 
Econoff expressed appreciation for [ORG Odyssey  ] efforts towards compromise , and encouraged continued flexibility in reaching a solution that would avert contestation in international waters where all parties , including [ORG Odyssey  ] , would lose. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: [ORG Odyssey  ] 's current strategy is to provide a " face saving " way out for [LOC Spain  ] that would also allow the [ORG Odyssey  ] to regain the use of their ships . 
The [ORG Ministry of Culture  ] and its corresponding [MISC Andalucian  ] stakeholders will be the key to how this issue proceeds . 
Though the offer to allow a [MISC Spanish  ] representative to be on board when the [ORG Odyssey  ] returns to the [ORG Black Swan  ] site may be tempting to [ORG MoC  ] , it is difficult to predict how emotions or local political gamesmanship will affect the outcome . 
Ultimately , the larger issue for both parties is ownership of the coins , a theme where neither [ORG Odyssey  ] nor the different [MISC Spanish  ] factions have expressed a willingness to budge . 
[ORG Odyssey  ] 's thoughts on how to approach this dispute are ever changing , and hence there is always a possibility that their course of action may change . 
Nonetheless , [ORG Odyssey  ] representatives advised Post that they would continue to keep us in the loop of developments .
