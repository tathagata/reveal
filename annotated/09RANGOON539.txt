[ORG RANGOON  ] 534 Classified By: P/E Chief [PER Jennifer Harhigh  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) Summary -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Burma  ] 's senior generals used [ORG Senator Webb  ] 's visit to deliver an unequivocal message: the GOB wants better relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
They want direct communication with [LOC Washington  ] and have identified an envoy -- regime insider and former Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] U [PER Thaung  ] . 
It is certain [PER Than Shwe  ] believes he has unclenched its fist -- granting a first-ever meeting with a [LOC U.S.  ] official , arranging a session for [ORG Senator Webb  ] with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , and deporting an [MISC American  ] prisoner as a sign of " friendship . 
" The generals will look for a response . 
We should allow [MISC Burmese  ] Foreign Minister [PER Nyan Win  ] to visit the Embassy in [LOC Washington  ] following [LOC UNGA  ] . 
We should undertake immediate discourse with U [PER Thaung  ] , including soon at the [LOC Washington  ] level , to sketch out mutual expectations . 
Meanwhile , we should renew efforts publicly and privately to encourage dialogue between the regime and a " pragmatic " [ORG National League for Democracy  ] , while seeking to consult with [ORG ASSK  ] throughout the process . 
End summary . 
A Fist Unclenched ? ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The first [LOC U.S.  ] official meeting with [PER Than Shwe  ] was decidedly more upbeat than expected . 
He was clearly in listening mode . 
He did not appear angry or hostile , even upon mention of [ORG ASSK  ] . 
He smiled and greeted [ORG Senator Webb  ] and [ORG Charge  ] warmly . 
He peppered the conversation with mentions of " friends " and friendship . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Than Shwe  ] and Prime Minister [PER Thein Sein  ] worked from the same script during their separate meetings with [ORG Senator Webb  ] ( Refs A and B ) . 
Both cited an earlier , more positive era in [LOC U.S.-Burma  ] relations while stressing that the current relationship could be better . 
The generals left no doubt they are reaching out , requesting " direct " bilateral relations , appointing U [PER Thaung  ] as an envoy with a direct line to [LOC Nay Pyi  ] Taw , and suggesting an upgrade to Ambassador on both sides. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Than Shwe  ] and his top brass clearly heard [ORG Senator Webb  ] 's message that [ORG ASSK  ] 's fate is critical to the [ORG USG  ] and an obstacle that must be addressed for meaningful improvement in relations . 
When the [ORG Senator  ] raised the matter of [ORG ASSK  ] 's release with [PER Than Shwe  ] , his reply was brief and non-committal , perhaps because the [ORG Senator  ] broke in to give the conversation took a different turn ( the [ORG Senator  ] told us later he preferred to leave [ORG ASSK  ] 's status open rather than elicit a negative reply ) . 
Nonetheless , [PER Than Shwe  ] could have taken any opportunity to launch into a tirade against [ORG ASSK  ] . 
He did not . 
[ORG ASSK  ] 's own [MISC National League for Democracy  ] ( [ORG NLD  ] ) leaders told us ( Ref C ) and repeated to [ORG Senator Webb  ] they perceive a possible shift in [PER Than Shwe  ] 's attitude and are hopeful he is prepared for dialogue . 
Expectations are High --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In another indication of the regime 's intentions , the government mouthpiece [ORG New Light of Myanmar  ] , in both [MISC Burmese  ] and [MISC English  ] editions , hailed [ORG Senator Webb  ] 's visit as a success under the headline " The first step of a long journey . 
" The article explained that [LOC Burma  ] enthusiastically cooperated with [ORG Senator Webb  ] because of " its stance to deepen bilateral relations and relieve the disagreements between the two countries . 
In conclusion , the article said the [ORG Senator  ] 's visit is the " first step to promotion of the relations between the two countries...the first step towards marching to a 1000-mile destination . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Meanwhile , expectations here are high among both government officials and ordinary citizens , with nearly all hoping the [ORG Senator  ] 's meetings will lead to a more positive bilateral relationship . 
Embassy officials were inundated by well-wishers , many of whom expressed their satisfaction that positive progress had been made toward improving relations , at a national day reception following the visit . 
The trip is dominating tea shop talk throughout [LOC Rangoon  ] , with many curious about the possible longer-term implications. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX Extending Our Hand... --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The generals no doubt believe they have taken an important and conciliatory step . 
[PER Than Shwe  ] agreed to meet with a [LOC U.S.  ] official for the first time ever -- which has particular resonance here since the regime uses access to signal where countries stand in its pecking order ( [LOC China  ] gets [ORG SPDC  ] members at its national day event ; we get [ORG MOFA  ] bureaucrats ) . 
The regime allowed [ORG Senator Webb  ] to meet with [ORG ASSK  ] , after turning down [ORG UNSYG Ban  ] . 
( Note: To our knowledge , [ORG Senator Webb  ] did not insist on an [ORG ASSK  ] meeting prior to the visit , rather the regime previewed the possibility , asking if the [ORG Senator  ] would be interested . 
End note . 
) On a note we perceive as less significant but still important , they deported an [MISC American  ] prisoner as a sign of goodwill. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The senior generals will expect a [LOC U.S.  ] response , likely soon . 
We do not for a moment believe the [LOC U.S.  ] should entertain a major shift in [LOC Burma  ] policy based on the [LOC CODEL  ] , s outcome . 
However , we do believe the [LOC U.S.  ] should take steps to acknowledge the GOB 's invitation for direct communication and to explore what might be possible over time . 
In that context , we offer the following recommendations for [LOC Washington  ] consideration . 
Let the Foreign Minister go to [LOC Washington  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MOFA  ] officials have indicated Foreign Minister [PER Nyan Win  ] wants to visit a renovation project at the [MISC Burmese  ] Embassy in [LOC Washington  ] following [LOC UNGA  ] . 
The regime likely views this as an equivalent goodwill gesture by the [LOC U.S.  ] We have no indication the FM will request Administration meetings . 
We understand the political implications of the recent [ORG ASSK  ] verdict and the significance of September 2007 anniversaries . 
However , Post strongly supports granting a visit to [LOC Washington  ] , even if certain conditions limiting duration or interaction are imposed . 
Seek a Meeting with U [PER Thaung  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We should seek a meeting in the near future with U [PER Thaung  ] to establish initial contact , explore his role and mandate , and ascertain his level of access to senior generals . 
Following an initial meeting at the [ORG Charge  ] level , a meeting with a [MISC Washington-based  ] official , perhaps at the DAS level and in a third country , would be an appropriate next step . 
Messages to U [PER Thaung  ] could include reiterating [ORG USG  ] support for resolution of [ORG ASSK  ] 's status , following up on discussions in [LOC Phuket  ] , including on [LOC North Korea  ] , and exploring perceived win/win issues for future cooperation , such as [ORG POW/MIA  ] remains recovery , raised by the Prime Minister . 
Advocate for Dialogue between Regime and [ORG ASSK  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG ASSK  ] could not have been clearer . 
Her top priority is commencing , without pre-conditions , direct dialogue with the regime . 
[ORG ASSK  ] also emphasized the party 's pragmatic and flexible approach and a willingness to cooperate with the regime to find common ground , including on sanctions ( Ref D ) . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
We propose a letter to [PER Aung Ky  ] from the [ORG Charge  ] on these points . 
It would be useful to explore , perhaps in coordination with [ORG Senator Webb  ] , publicizing some of her remarks to clarify to the world her position and combat the regime 's argument that she is rigid and uncompromising . 
We should also let it be known she supports outsiders visiting [LOC Burma  ] , and even meeting with the [ORG SPDC  ] , so long as they seek a balanced impression of the country 's situation . 
Request Meeting with [ORG ASSK  ] ------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The terms of [ORG ASSK  ] 's current house arrest are less restrictive on paper , though its remains uncertain how they will be implemented in practice . 
As we maintain our insistence on [ORG ASSK  ] 's release ( along with other political prisoners ) , we should also encourage -- certainly in private and perhaps also publicly -- interim steps by the regime to allow her interaction with members of her party and outside visitors . 
She herself never raised the topic of her own release in meetings with [ORG Senator Webb  ] . 
She did , however , emphasize the necessity of consulting with the [ORG NLD  ] , including to discuss the party 's position on the 2010 elections . 
Taking cues from her , we should urge the regime to allow her regular , unsupervised access to visitors . 
We should also consider how we might respond if , in fact , the regime eases the conditions of her house arrests and enters into meaningful dialogue with her . 
Even CEC members acknowledge the possibility of dialogue and progress with regime while [ORG ASSK  ] remains in detention ( Ref C ) . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We propose to seek a meeting with [ORG ASSK  ] at the Embassy level to follow up on [ORG Senator Webb  ] 's visit , and to inquire how the [LOC U.S.  ] can best promote an internal dialogue between the [ORG NLD  ] and the regime . 
If our efforts are successful , we could pursue a meeting with a [MISC Washington-based  ] official , perhaps in conjunction with a routine visit to post . 
We note that other diplomatic missions are seeking our coordination as they contemplate similar requests to meet [ORG ASSK  ] . 
We Must Be Practical , [MISC Keep Talking  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Throughout her meeting with [ORG Senator Webb  ] , [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] emphasized her practicality: " We have a dream list . 
We have a wish list . 
But we're practical . 
We want a solution . 
" She also stressed her willingness to talk to the regime without preconditions . 
As related to [ORG Senator Webb  ] , [ORG ASSK  ] told [PER Aung Kyi  ] in 2007 , " Let 's agree we won't stop talking . 
Let 's take things step by step . 
" From our perspective , the [ORG USG  ] should strive for the same end , seeking practical solutions step by step , while always continuing the conversation . 
That process can start , in our view , by responding to the regime 's recent overtures .
