06 [LOC PARIS  ] 5733 [LOC PARIS  ] 00001501 001.2 OF 006 Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor [PER Kathleen Allegrone  ] , 1.4 ( b/ d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The revised [LOC Africa  ] policy President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] announced after taking office in May 2007 is taking shape . 
This new policy features a reduction and consolidation of [LOC France  ] 's military presence to align it more closely with [LOC Africa  ] 's regional structures , more " business-like " relations replacing the " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " model , larger [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] roles , and increased expectations in terms of transparency , good governance , and results on the part of [MISC Africans  ] receiving [MISC French  ] aid . 
While the advantages of [MISC France-Afrique  ] allowed that model to endure for decades , its saliency has weakened as the colonial era grows more distant and as the political and economic costs to [LOC France  ] of backstopping former colonies have become harder to sustain . 
In modernizing and normalizing relations with [LOC Africa  ] , the [MISC French  ] risk losing some influence while reducing a number of burdens . 
This is a trade-off they believe they must make , and seem confident that the [LOC France  ] engaged with [MISC Africans  ] on these new terms will be an attractive partner capable of sustaining old relationships and cultivating and nurturing new ones across the continent . 
The new policy may also provide opportunities for the [LOC U.S.  ] to extend its influence in [LOC Africa  ] without meeting [MISC French  ] resistance or interference . 
Part I ( this message ) provides historical background and outlines [PER Sarkozy  ] 's policy shift ; Part II ( septel ) focuses on its implementation and [MISC African  ] reaction ; Part III ( septel ) centers on the new policy 's military/security aspects . 
END SUMMARY . 
" [MISC France-Afrique  ] " ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Former [PER Cote  ] d , Ivoire President [PER Houphouet-Boigny  ] reputedly coined the phrase " [MISC France-Afrique  ] " ( in [MISC French  ] , the more evocative " francafrique " with a cedilla under the " c " ) to describe the complex web of economic , military , political , social , and cultural ties that linked [LOC France  ] with its former colonies and to a lesser extent non-francophone [LOC Africa  ] . 
These ties , built over decades of colonial rule , persisted after independence in the 1960s , and provided a mutually beneficial environment for both sides , with [MISC Africans  ] enjoying [MISC French  ] protection , military and security support , and , not least , foreign aid. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The governmental , educational , legal , military , bureaucratic , and administrative systems and methods of many former [MISC African  ] colonies were modeled on [MISC French  ] structures , and many still are . 
[MISC French  ] is often the official language and lingua franca ( sometimes in competition with a dominant local language ) in several [MISC African  ] countries . 
Often , air travel between nearby [MISC African  ] countries could only be done by transiting [LOC Paris  ] . 
These factors alone guaranteed continuing [MISC French  ] influence post-independence in many [MISC African  ] societies . 
Other " benefits " were manifest: [MISC African  ] leaders were able to amass private fortunes sometimes transformed into vast real estate and other holdings in [LOC France  ] and elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] , cases of which the press continues to uncover to this day . 
[LOC France  ] profited from a ready-made set of compliant client states and leaders , easy access to resources and markets for exports , and a tacitly accorded freedom of action , both private and official , for [MISC French  ] and locals alike , of the sort that produced cases like the " [MISC Falcone Affair  ] , " the long-running arms trafficking case in [LOC Angola.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Culturally , [MISC Africans  ] of the colonial and independence eras were deeply steeped in [MISC French  ] ways , with some achieving high positions in [LOC France  ] , e.g. , [PER Houphouet-Boigny  ] 's serving in the [MISC French  ] government and [LOC Senegal  ] President [PER Senghor  ] 's rise to the very pinnacle of [MISC French  ] society with his election to the [ORG Academie Francaise  ] . 
The [MISC African  ] elite and their children were often schooled in [LOC France  ] , with the ever-expanding " francophonie " movement [LOC PARIS  ] 00001501 002.2 OF 006 ensuring that they remained part of [LOC France  ] 's global network . 
At the other end of the scale , tens of thousands of [MISC African  ] colonial troops fought for [LOC France  ] during the [MISC World Wars  ] and other conflicts , with surviving veterans still receiving pensions for their service to [LOC France.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC France-Afrique  ] operated well for decades , under the tutelage of a succession of " Mr. [MISC Africas  ] " at the [MISC French  ] [LOC Presidency  ] , beginning with the legendary and controversial [PER Jacques Foccart  ] , [ORG Africa Advisor  ] to [PER de Gaulle  ] , [PER Pompidou  ] , and , briefly , [ORG Mitterrand  ] and [ORG Chirac  ] . 
Others in that role have included [ORG Mitterrand  ] 's son [PER Jean-Christophe  ] . 
For many years , the [ORG Africa Advisor  ] at the [LOC Presidency  ] did not report to the President 's [ORG Diplomatic Advisor  ] ( the [MISC French  ] equivalent of our [ORG National Security Advisor  ] ) but directly to the President , thus enjoying a status equal to or perhaps even greater than that of the [ORG Diplomatic Advisor  ] ( who had to worry about the rest of the world ) , a fact not lost on those currying favor at the [LOC Presidency  ] . 
Nothing Lasts Forever -------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As the 20th century drew to a close , [MISC France-Afrique  ] as an effective model began having trouble adjusting to a changing global landscape . 
We noted certain factors in Ref A ( 05 [LOC Paris  ] 5459 -- The Future of [LOC France  ] in [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] ) . 
These include shrinking older generations on both sides wedded to [MISC France-Afrique  ] ; younger generations lacking such knowledge and experience and less reflexively inclined to view relations through the [MISC France-Afrique  ] optic ; increased exposure of [MISC Africans  ] to other parts of the world , either first hand or through the omnipresent global media ; aggressive pursuit of [MISC African  ] resources and commerce by hitherto outsiders ( e.g. , especially [LOC China  ] -- see Ref B , 06 [LOC Paris  ] 5733 -- [LOC China  ] in [LOC Africa  ] ) ; and , culturally and socially , a growing exposure to non-French films , fashions , sports , music , and literature , with the [LOC U.S.  ] enjoying an advantage in this area . 
Francophone [MISC Africans  ] began to lose their tendency to look to [LOC France  ] as their model . 
In short , [MISC France-Afrique  ] began falling victim to several of globalization 's effects. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) For [LOC France  ] , the cost of maintaining [MISC France-Afrique  ] started becoming less commensurate with its returns , both political and economic . 
[LOC France  ] shifted to an all-volunteer military in 2001 , which immediately increased the cost of sustaining a global military presence . 
EU requirements limit deficit spending , [LOC France  ] 's traditionally generous safety net and an aging population strain finances , and booming and resource-hungry economies elsewhere raise the cost of commercial transactions , threatening [MISC French  ] privilege in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Cost-cutting , at home and abroad , has become a priority for the [ORG GOF  ] , and maintaining the qualitative and quantitative investment [MISC France-Afrique  ] entailed is becoming harder to accomplish. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Politically , brush fires have occurred that are harder and more expensive to put out . 
The [MISC French  ] are quite bitter about [LOC Cote d  ] , [PER Ivoire  ] , once a crown jewel of [MISC France-Afrique  ] , which spiraled into chaos after the death of one of [MISC France-Afrique  ] 's biggest advocates and beneficiaries , [PER Houphouet-Boigny  ] , reaching a nadir with the November 2004 bombing by [LOC Cote d  ] , [PER Ivoire  ] of [MISC French  ] forces in [LOC Bouake  ] . 
Operation Licorne in [LOC Cote d  ] , [PER Ivoire  ] , perhaps [LOC France  ] 's last unilateral military intervention in the old style , has cost [LOC France  ] about 250 million euro per year , or well over a billion euro in total , without yielding decisive results. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Other brush fires and scandals , which in earlier days might have been ignored or covered up , have erupted with regularity: [PER Borrel  ] in [LOC Djibouti  ] , [PER Kieffer  ] in [LOC Cote d  ] , [PER Ivoire  ] , and [PER Falcone  ] in [LOC Angola  ] , to name a few . 
In addition to [PER Falcone  ] , other renegade [MISC French  ] in recent times have been making mischief across the continent -- [PER Bob Dennard  ] repeatedly in the [LOC Comoros  ] , Gnassingbe advisor [PER Charles Debbasch  ] and arms dealer [PER Robert Montoya  ] in [LOC Togo  ] ( with effects in [LOC Cote d  ] , [PER Ivoire  ] ) , and , recently , the [ORG Zoe  ] 's [LOC Ark  ] " rescue " [LOC PARIS  ] 00001501 003.2 OF 006 mission of [LOC Darfur  ] children. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In the past , the [ORG GOF  ] might have tacitly or openly tolerated or even supported some of these activities . 
Now , with an instant global media and the weakened cover afforded by a deteriorating [MISC France-Afrique  ] , these become problems , if not major scandals , that must be addressed in a less sheltered environment . 
One old-timer , commenting on [PER Sarkozy  ] 's trip to [LOC Chad  ] in the [ORG Zoe  ] 's [LOC Ark  ] case to seek the partial release of [MISC French  ] and other [MISC Europeans  ] implicated in the " adoption " scandal , sniffed that " it used to be that one phone call from the [LOC Elysee  ] would have settled this . 
How far we have come that the President himself has to go there , and even then , doesn't really finish the job . 
" In pushing for good governance , transparency , accountability , and a free press as part of its democratization , foreign assistance , and human rights agendas , [LOC France  ] has partly become its own victim , as those forces have helped bring scandals to light. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [MISC France-Afrique  ] provided privileges to [LOC France  ] but carried a burden of expectation that has become harder to shoulder . 
Everyone acknowledged [LOC France  ] 's primacy in parts of [LOC Africa  ] , but this created expectations that when problems arose , " the [MISC French  ] will take care of it . 
" [LOC France  ] was long able and willing to face these challenges when everyone accepted this reality , but that is no longer the case . 
France-Afrique has sometimes been a double-edged sword , with some , including [MISC Africans  ] , wanting [LOC France  ] to intervene forcefully when problems arise , but with others happy to accuse [LOC France  ] of acting unilaterally or as a " neo-colonialist " when it does . 
" Damned if you do , damned if you don't " has become an underlying theme in the debate over [LOC France  ] 's role in [LOC Africa.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG Chirac  ] government , while aware of [ORG France-Afrique  ] 's stagnation , was disinclined to do much about it and tried to preserve [ORG France-Afrique  ] 's facade . 
Acting in the old style , [ORG Chirac  ] , to some embarrassment , was quick to mourn the 2005 death of his " friend " [PER Eyadema  ] in [LOC Togo  ] and to accept quickly the questionable process that led to his son 's taking power . 
The [LOC Presidency  ] , citing " executive privilege , " refused to turn over records to judicial authorities investigating the [PER Borrel  ] case , although [PER Michel de Bonnecorse  ] , the [LOC Presidency  ] 's last " Mr. [LOC Africa  ] , " had to suffer the indignity of having his personal home and vacation house searched . 
As in the heyday of [MISC France-Afrique  ] , the [MISC French  ] military was given a relatively free hand in responding militarily to rebel incursions in [LOC Chad  ] and C.A.R. prior to the end of the [ORG Chirac  ] era . 
[PER Sarkozy Brings Change  ] --------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) As he did in other areas on taking office in May 2007 , [PER Sarkozy  ] wrought change to the [LOC Africa  ] account . 
His basic approach has been to try to clean the slates , rid relations of the colonial era hangover , and conduct more " normal and business-like " relations with [MISC Africans  ] . 
He is quick to attribute events and activities before his [LOC Presidency  ] to " past [MISC French  ] governments , " always suggesting that he represents a new era. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Sarkozy  ] did away with the " Mr. [LOC Africa  ] " position -- at least on paper . 
He named [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] ( who had the same job under [ORG Chirac  ] before becoming [ORG UN  ] PermRep and then Ambassador to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) as his [ORG Diplomatic Advisor  ] , and [PER Bruno Joubert  ] as [PER Levitte  ] 's Deputy . 
[PER Joubert  ] , however , is also the President 's senior advisor on [LOC Africa  ] and was previously [ORG MFA A/S for Africa  ] . 
The " Mr. [LOC Africa  ] " position no longer officially exists , but [PER Joubert  ] , already wearing one hat as [PER Levitte  ] 's Deputy , functionally also wears the hat the former [ORG Africa Advisors  ] wore , although he now reports to [PER Levitte  ] rather than directly to the President . 
Two " technical counselors " work with him -- [PER Remi Marechaux  ] ( francophone [LOC Africa  ] plus [LOC South Africa  ] , a specialty ) , and [PER Romain Serman  ] ( non-francophone [LOC Africa  ] , [ORG UN  ] issues , and crises ) . 
When one of [PER Marechaux  ] 's countries goes into crisis , [PER Serman  ] will often [LOC PARIS  ] 00001501 004.2 OF 006 take charge . 
[PER Marechaux  ] was an [ORG MFA AF DAS-equivalent  ] when [PER Joubert  ] was [ORG MFA AF A/S  ] , and [PER Serman  ] previously covered [LOC Africa  ] at the [ORG UN  ] . 
[PER Marechaux  ] earlier worked at the Department under the [ORG Fellowship of Hope  ] exchange program. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Joubert  ] , [PER Marechaux  ] , and [PER Serman  ] make an effective team , with complementary styles -- [PER Joubert  ] a classic diplomat , smooth , and savvy bureaucratically ; [PER Marechaux  ] intellectual , cerebral , and somewhat reserved ; and [PER Serman  ] fiery , action oriented , and a master of rapid repartee in both [MISC French  ] and [MISC English  ] . 
They dominate [MISC African  ] issues within the [ORG GOF  ] , and although they collaborate closely with [ORG MFA  ] colleagues , they seem to win intra-GOF disputes . 
Their [ORG MFA  ] counterparts -- [ORG AF A/S Jean  ] de [ORG Gliniasty  ] and [PER DASs Helene Le Gal  ] , [PER Christine Fages  ] , and ( temporarily ) [PER Christian Daziano  ] -- are also quite capable and friendly , but they do not have the same drive or clout that comes with being in close proximity to the hyperactive and demanding [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
[PER Joubert  ] ( who knew her when he was [ORG MFA AF A/S  ] ) and [ORG Gliniasty  ] handpicked [PER Charlotte Montel  ] , a virtual first-tour officer ( and 2009 IVLP member ) , to serve in FM [ORG Kouchner  ] 's cabinet , ensuring the presence of a dependable colleague on [MISC African  ] issues within [ORG Kouchner  ] 's inner circle . 
[PER Montel  ] 's role has increased with the recent departure of [PER Laurent Contini  ] ( new Ambassador to [LOC Zimbabwe  ] ) , who was [ORG Kouchner  ] 's senior [ORG AF Advisor  ] but who will not be replaced . 
The [ORG New Policy  ] -------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] used three speeches to express publicly the new direction [LOC Africa  ] policy would take , in [LOC Dakar  ] on July 26 , 2007 , in [LOC Lisbon  ] at the [LOC EU-Africa Summit  ] on December 8 , 2007 , and in [LOC Cape Town  ] on February 28 , 2008 . 
The general theme emerging from these speeches is that [LOC France  ] will seek to modernize relations , get rid of lingering colonialist and post-colonialist baggage , engage with [MISC Africans  ] on a more business-like and arms-length basis , no longer seek to play a paternal role , and instead opt for a partnership among equals . 
To be sure , [PER Sarkozy  ] promises continued [MISC French  ] engagement , but engagement based on a calculation of interests rather than on inertia and outdated sentiments deemed to be relics of the past . 
He calls on [MISC Africans  ] to meet this challenge and to begin relating to [LOC France  ] and others on the same basis. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The speeches -- and the outlines of the new policy -- were received with varying degrees of acceptance . 
The [LOC Dakar  ] speech included apologies for [LOC France  ] 's colonial past but also suggested that [MISC Africans  ] needed to acknowledge that they derived benefits from the colonial period . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] stated that [MISC Africans  ] needed to become more self-reliant , less dependent , and to take charge of their destinies without raising " colonialism " and its ills as the continuing source of their problems or as excuses . 
Some [MISC Africans  ] welcomed [PER Sarkozy  ] 's speech as a necessary dose of reality while others claimed that his call for a less paternalistic relationship was delivered in a distinctly paternalistic and condescending manner . 
( See [LOC Part II  ] , septel , for a discussion of [LOC Africa  ] reactions to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's policy . 
) <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Presidential Advisor  ] [PER Serman  ] later said that the [LOC Dakar  ] speech was drafted by [PER Henri Guaino  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's [ORG Special Advisor  ] , and had not been vetted by [PER Levitte  ] , [PER Joubert  ] 's unit , or the [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Serman  ] believed the speech was too provocative and not " diplomatic " enough and would have been revised had [PER Guaino  ] not given it , uncleared , directly to [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
( Of note , on July 26 , 2008 , one year after the [LOC Dakar  ] speech , [PER Guaino  ] published a self-serving article in [ORG Le Monde  ] justifying the approach he took in the speech . 
) The [LOC Lisbon  ] and [LOC Cape Town  ] speeches received closer vetting and their tone was less aggressive , although their contents built on the foundation laid in [LOC Dakar  ] . 
The [LOC Lisbon  ] speech , delivered at the [LOC EU-Africa Summit  ] , stressed the importance of a strong [LOC Europe  ] working with a strong [LOC Africa  ] . 
The centerpiece of the [LOC Cape Town  ] speech was [PER Sarkozy  ] 's plan to change [LOC France  ] 's military posture in [LOC Africa  ] ( analyzed in [LOC Part III  ] , septel ) . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00001501 005.2 OF 006 " Reward the Good , Punish the Bad " --------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Our [ORG GOF  ] contacts say that [PER Sarkozy  ] 's [LOC Africa  ] policy intends to " normalize " relations with [LOC Africa  ] , strip them of the [MISC France-Afrique  ] veneer , make them more transparent , hold [MISC Africans  ] to certain standards of accountability and responsibility , and end [MISC France-Afrique  ] 's long cycle of dependency and paternalism . 
[PER Serman  ] puts it succinctly: " [PER Sarkozy  ] wants to reward the good and punish the bad . 
" The [ORG GOF  ] views some of the [ORG Defense Agreements  ] ( see [LOC Part III  ] , septel ) maintained with eight [MISC African  ] countries as patently absurd and out of date -- for example , [PER Serman  ] says that several agreements give [LOC France  ] exclusive monopoly rights to natural resources . 
" Nobody pays any attention to this , so we need to get rid of it all and stop playing pretend . 
" [LOC U.S.  ] an Attractive Partner in [LOC Africa  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's policy acknowledges the growing role in [LOC Africa  ] of former outsiders such as [LOC China  ] and takes a favorable view towards increased [LOC U.S.  ] engagement . 
Although skeptical at first and sensitive about protecting [MISC French  ] influence , the [MISC French  ] have gradually come to accept , if not welcome , [LOC U.S.  ] activities such as [ORG AFRICOM  ] , [ORG TSCTP  ] , [ORG ACOTA  ] , [ORG AGOA  ] , [ORG MCC  ] , and other Africa-centric [LOC U.S.  ] projects . 
The [MISC French  ] do not find them threatening and , moreover , they offer the possibility of a new [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to " share the burden " in [LOC Africa  ] that earlier fell largely on [LOC France  ] . 
Moreover , the [MISC French  ] are comfortable with an expanding [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Africa  ] as a counterbalance to [LOC China  ] 's regional expansion . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's policy , combined with his generally favorable views of the [LOC U.S.  ] , may allow the [LOC U.S.  ] a freer hand in [LOC Africa  ] , at least as far as the [MISC French  ] are concerned. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Similarly , the [MISC French  ] are seeking to increase [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] engagement in [LOC Africa  ] as another form of burdensharing and to allow [LOC France  ] to operate discreetly behind [ORG EU  ] and/or [ORG UN  ] cover . 
The [MISC French  ] have actively sought [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] involvement in recent years , from elections support in a number of places to military support in [ORG DRC  ] and [ORG Chad/C.A.R  ] . 
Success in lobbying [ORG EU  ] members ( and some non-members ) to deploy [ORG EUFOR  ] in [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC C.A.R.  ] , although deployment required the [MISC French  ] to provide more troops and equipment than first desired , was a significant political milestone in [MISC French  ] eyes and the [ORG EUFOR  ] case may represent the way the [MISC French  ] will try to engage the [ORG EU  ] in future crises . 
The [MISC French  ] went out of their way to depict this as an [ORG EU  ] and not [MISC French  ] activity . 
The possible transformation of [ORG EUFOR  ] into a [ORG UN  ] PKO would also be consistent with [MISC French  ] desires to increase the [ORG UN  ] 's role in crisis management , a process that has also worked in [LOC Cote d  ] , Ivoire with the linkage between the [ORG French Operation Licorne  ] and [ORG UNOCI.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) As noted in Ref B and above , the [MISC French  ] remain concerned about [LOC China  ] 's growing influence in [LOC Africa  ] and believe that the [MISC Chinese  ] employ methods to achieve their ends that are no longer practiced ( at least not so overtly or boldly ) by [LOC France  ] and the [LOC West  ] . 
They express frustration that the [MISC Chinese  ] can operate so effectively , acknowledge that many [MISC African  ] countries are easily seduced by [MISC Chinese  ] practices , but also are quick to notice any [MISC African  ] backlash suggesting that there is " too much [LOC China  ] too fast " in [LOC Africa  ] , a backlash that seems to be gathering momentum . 
Publicly , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's attitude has been that [LOC France  ] has no objection to [LOC China  ] 's becoming more present in [LOC Africa  ] -- so long as [MISC Africans  ] apply the same rules to the [MISC Chinese  ] that are applied to everyone else . 
Policy as a Reflection of Personality ------------------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) The new [LOC Africa  ] policy -- a break with the past , the shelving of relations based on history and sentiment , the call for rationalizing relations and having them reflect the shared interests of equals , the insistence on transparency and accountability , the desire to work constructively in [LOC PARIS  ] 00001501 006.2 OF 006 [LOC Africa  ] with partners such as the [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG EU  ] , and [ORG UN  ] -- seems very much a reflection of [PER Sarkozy  ] himself , who came to office in a hurry to initiate reform left and right , and not simply to tinker on the margins . 
There have been a few setbacks on the domestic front , where he has had to compromise when faced with entrenched groups willing to push back . 
In foreign affairs , however , he has had a freer hand , and in some ways [MISC France-Afrique  ] was an institution waiting to be changed . 
Previous [MISC French  ] leaders talked about changing [LOC France  ] 's relations with [LOC Africa  ] and may have taken a few steps but [PER Sarkozy  ] is doing significantly more than that , at least from today 's vantage point.. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) One close observer reminds that [PER Sarkozy  ] , himself a sharp break with [MISC French  ] tradition , is the first [MISC French  ] President to have grown up without meaningful personal experience with the colonial era and is therefore free of sentimental attachment to [MISC France-Afrique  ] . 
To [PER Sarkozy  ] , [MISC France-Afrique  ] no longer makes sense , with [LOC France  ] and [LOC Africa  ] needing to modernize their ties and move on , based on a calculation of interests on both sides , which , in [PER Sarkozy  ] 's view for the [MISC French  ] , boils down to " reward the good , punish the bad . 
" <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) How have the [MISC French  ] gone about implementing this new policy and how have [MISC Africans  ] reacted to it ?
