( C ) Summary: In a February 8 meeting with Ambassador , [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) presidential hopeful , current media darling and president of the [LOC Poitou-Charentes  ] region [PER Segolene Royal  ] left no doubt as to her determination to win election as president of [LOC France  ] in 2007 .

( Current polls show that [PER Royal  ] could make a formidable candidate in [LOC France  ] 's presidential election , now 14 months away . 
These polls show she is one of only two or three contenders that over half of voters now say they could be willing to vote for as president . 
) Conceding that " polls are not elections ( ref D ) " but adding that " they stop being in error about six months before the elections , " [PER Royal  ] expressed optimism that her popularity would hold until then -- and for six months thereafter , notwithstanding the predictions of pundits to the contrary . 
[PER Royal  ] went to considerable lengths to express her openness and friendliness towards the [LOC U.S.  ] and mentioned the possibility of visiting [LOC Washington  ] during an upcoming trip to [LOC New York  ] to speak at [ORG Columbia University  ] . 
End summary . 
A DISARMINGLY DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In her discussion with Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] and Embassy officers on February 8 , [PER Segolene Royal  ] lived up to her image as an uncommonly charismatic , subtle and determined politician . 
She very matter-of-factly reviewed her sustained , high poll numbers ( ref C ) and made no bones about her intention to pursue the presidency so long as " other people think it 's possible for me . 
" Unaffectedly applying to herself the term " willful " often used about her by detractors , [PER Royal  ] said she was determined to stay in the presidential race until eliminated or victorious . 
( Comment: According to a recent biography of [PER Royal  ] , she wanted to test the waters by running in 2002 , and rues having allowed herself to be discouraged from doing so by fellow [ORG PS  ] heavyweights . 
In this biographer 's account , she is determined to stay in there to the end this time around . 
End comment . 
) " I'M THE ONE TO BEAT " FOR THE [ORG PS  ] NOMINATION ------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Royal  ] betrayed no qualms about her ability to shape to her benefit the process that is leading to the [ORG PS  ] 's selection of a candidate for 2007 by primary vote among party members next November . 
In contrast to her public remarks about securing the [ORG PS  ] nomination , where she often quotes former president [PER Mitterrand  ] in saying that , in politics " you have to give time to time , " [PER Royal  ] was much more direct with the Ambassador , shrugging off the chances of her more senior rivals in the [ORG PS  ] by pointing out that , " I 'm the one to beat . 
" ( Note: Among [ORG PS  ] party members , who will be the only voters in next November 's party primary , [PER Royal  ] 's current popularity ratings nearly double those of her nearest rival , former prime minister [PER Lionel Jospin  ] . 
The popularity of [PER Royal  ] , as a potential presidential standard bearer has risen steadily among party members since last summer ( ref F ) . 
Among the public at large , she also far outpaces [PER Jospin  ] and other [ORG PS  ] heavyweights in current polls as the most preferred [ORG PS  ] presidential candidate . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Royal  ] said that the attraction of winning -- with her as the standard-bearer most clearly able to deliver victory -- was a powerful galvanizer of opinion among party members . 
She judged that her relatively junior standing as a party leader and alleged lack of qualifications need not stand in the way of her garnering enough support to win from among the party 's 130,000 card-carrying members . 
Briefly reviewing her electoral and governmental record , she believed her experience was more than adequate to overcome any qualms party members ( and thereafter , voters ) might have about it . 
( Note and comment: [PER Royal  ] has been elected to the [ORG National Assembly  ] four times ; has served junior minister for the environment , junior minister for elementary education and junior minister for families , children and the handicapped . 
Most recently ( in 2004 ) she won the presidency of the [LOC Poitou-Charentes  ] region , beating the hand-picked candidate of then Prime Minister [PER Raffarin  ] . 
[PER Royal  ] 's is a distinguished record of achievement and experience . 
What issue there may be over her qualifications within the [ORG PS  ] has to be seen in light of , for example , former prime minister [PER Laurent Fabius'  ] experience as prime minister , president of the [ORG National Assembly  ] , head of the [ORG PS  ] party group in the [ORG National Assembly  ] , minister of economy and finance and regular re-election to parliament since 1978 . 
Since the February 8 meeting , it has become obvious that former prime minister [PER Jospin  ] , in many ways the party 's most senior figure , is actively seeking the nomination ( ref A ) . 
End Note and comment . 
) GOLD-PLATED IMAGE PLUS FAMILIES-SCHOOLS-NEIGHBORHOODS --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Royal  ] outlined a carefully crafted strategy designed to cast her as the candidate of safe change -- i.e. , the candidate who answers best [MISC French  ] voters' simultaneous eagerness for change and fear of it . 
[PER Royal  ] said that she believed " people want a new kind of political discourse . 
" This conviction , she continued , was prompting her to skip the political talk shows and deliberately focus instead on the family , school and environmental issues that are her strength and " are what matter most to ordinary people . 
" She argued that her focus on " soft " social services issues , coupled with her very positive public image , her sterling center-left credentials and proven effectiveness as a grass-roots politician , make her a potent political force . 
[PER Royal  ] said that the core of her candidacy is " having the courage to have confidence in the voters . 
" NOT A LOT OF POLICY SPECIFICITY ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Royal  ] spoke in very general , indeed , rather vague , terms about what she stands for as a presidential candidate . 
( Comment: Given her popularity , it is probably not in her interest to furnish policy prescriptions at this time lest she alienate potential supporters . 
End comment . 
) She described a crisis of confidence among ordinary [MISC French  ] people who , she said , " are prey to a feeling of decline . 
" She evoked how prospects for those in the middle class are shrinking , for their children even more so . 
She pointed to narrowing the quality gap between [LOC France  ] 's elite schools and its regular schools and universities as key to re-invigorating upward mobility in [MISC French  ] society . 
She also criticized the [ORG Villepin  ] government 's emphasis on employment as the engine of upward mobility , lamenting the " destabilizing effects " for family life of the increased job insecurity implicit in many of the government 's employment initiatives . 
[PER Royal  ] said that she would like " to lead a national project " that would succeed by renewing " hope in the people . 
" Implicitly addressing criticism directed against the absence of a program , [PER Royal  ] noted that the successful record of the [PER Jospin  ] government didn't prevent him from losing in his bid for the presidency in 2002 , concluding that " you don't win elections on your record or your program " but rather on the expectations generated by a candidacy . 
OPENNESS TO THE [LOC U.S.  ] -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Though she did not dwell on foreign policy issues , [PER Royal  ] did make an effort to convey openness towards the [LOC U.S.  ] Echoing the remarks of other political interlocutors across the board , she duly noted her opposition to the [LOC U.S.  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] but went to considerable length in assuring the Ambassador that a socialist government would " never have actively campaigned against the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Africa  ] , " for example , and would have handled differences in a more understanding and less confrontational manner than President [PER Chirac  ] and then-FM de [ORG Villepin  ] . 
[PER Royal  ] recalled , with evident fondness , her work organizing the 1981 [LOC Versailles Summit  ] between Presidents [PER Reagan  ] and [PER Mitterrand  ] . 
This was her first experience with presidential-level diplomacy and apparently involved liaising with the [ORG U.S. Secret Service  ] ; [PER Royal  ] expressed her surprise , at the time , discovering the massive logistical underpinnings required by such events . 
[PER Royal  ] also made clear , through a reference to watching " Desperate Housewives , " that she did not reject [MISC American  ] popular culture . 
[PER Royal  ] did not augment her friendly sentiments toward the [LOC U.S.  ] with any vision for [MISC U.S.-France  ] relations . 
She did suggest a need " to find [LOC France  ] 's place in the world , " with the [ORG GoF  ] showing less arrogance in how it speaks to the world . 
The latter factor , she suggested , had played a role in the defeat of [LOC France  ] 's 2012 [MISC Olympics  ] candidacy. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Royal  ] said she would be visiting the [LOC U.S.  ] soon , probably in the context of accepting an invitation to speak at [ORG Columbia University  ] in [LOC New York  ] this spring . 
She mentioned the possibility of also visiting [LOC Washington  ] at that time . 
The Ambassador said he would be pleased to work with her and her staff to design an appropriate program . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
[PER Royal  ] clearly believes her determination , concern for ordinary people and uncommon mix of strengths as a candidate make her a real contender , notwithstanding the predictions of pundits and her political rivals that the " [MISC Segolene  ] phenomenon " will not last . 
Opponents , whether from center-right ( with the exception of Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] ) or her own center-left , either insist on her " unfitness " for the job ( ref D ) or suggest she is a stalking horse for a " draft " of former PM [PER Jospin  ] . 
Although it is not unfair to be skeptical about [PER Royal  ] 's staying power or even her qualifications , it is also true that much of the disparagement of her stems from envy of the popularity of a female upstart , who is also challenging the unwritten rules of the political establishment . 
It is also undeniable that [PER Royal  ] has managed to tap into the feelings of an electorate looking for change. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
[PER Royal  ] appeared to be well disposed towards the [LOC U.S.  ] That said , as is the case for many on the left of the [MISC French  ] political spectrum , it would be a mistake to translate a high comfort level with [MISC American  ] culture into approval for a wide range of [LOC U.S.  ] polices , foreign and domestic . 
[PER Royal  ] has only made brief trips to the [LOC U.S.  ] as a tourist .
