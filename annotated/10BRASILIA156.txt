( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
The [ORG Brazilian Forest Code  ] 's requirement that a rural landowner in the [LOC Amazon  ] maintain 80 percent of the native forest as a legal reserve has produced a heated dispute between the agriculture and environmental communities . 
Environmentalists see it as a potentially powerful tool to prevent deforestation , and the agriculture sector views it as economically ruinous for millions of ranchers and farmers . 
As a practical matter , that legal reserve requirement has never been effectively implemented , and President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] has decided , once again , to postpone implementation till June 2011 - after the upcoming national elections . 
While the debate continues over the [ORG Forest Code  ] , the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] 's other policies have contributed to a sharp decline in the rate of [LOC Amazon  ] deforestation from 21.5 thousand square kilometers in 2002 to 7.0 thousand last year . 
END SUMMARY FOREST CODE'S CONTROVERSIAL RESERVE REQUIREMENT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Brazilian Forest Code  ] ( Law 4,771 from Sept. 15 , 1965 ) began its life as much a tool for sound soil and water resources management as to promote forest conservation . 
The law required maintenance of forests in strategic areas , such as along rivers , streams and lakes , on tops of hills and mountains , and on steep hillsides , to protect water quality and prevention erosion . 
At the time of its enactment in 1965 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government supported policies to clear the [LOC Amazon  ] for agricultural production . 
The [MISC Constitution  ] still includes a provision requiring a landowner to make productive use of the land , which is commonly read to mean that landowners must clear some forests for agriculture purposes or risk losing the land . 
The [ORG Forest Code  ] initially required rural properties in the [LOC Amazon Region  ] to maintain 50 percent of the native forest on the property . 
This area is called the " reserva legal " ( or legal reserve ) . 
The legal reserve was 20 percent for rural areas in the savannah ( or " [LOC Cerrado  ] " ) region and also 20 percent for the rest of the country. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to massive deforestation in the [LOC Amazon  ] , then-President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] sought to turn the [ORG Forest Code  ] into a central tool to conserve the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
In 1996 he issued a " [MISC Provisory Measure  ] " to amend the [ORG Forest Code  ] to raise the legal reserve requirement in the [LOC Amazon  ] to 80 percent and in the [LOC Cerrado  ] to 35 percent . 
Opposition from the powerful rural bloc in [ORG Congress  ] , however , ensured that this measure was not brought up for a vote . 
Instead , the Presidency reissued the measure 67 times to keep it in effect , until 2001 when the rules governing [MISC Provisory Measures  ] were changed . 
Today , although the [ORG Congress  ] never voted on it , the 2001 [MISC Provisory Measure  ] is generally viewed as having the effect of law. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) has not pursued violators of the legal reserve requirement in the [LOC Amazon  ] , whether using the 50 percent or the 80 percent standard . 
It looked as though this was about to change on December 11 , 2009 . 
That was the date when legislation on environmental crimes , including possible criminal sanctions and stiff fines for violating the [ORG Forest Code  ] , was scheduled to enter into effect . 
Previously , the government lacked the authority to severely punish violators of the [ORG Forest Code  ] 's reserve requirement . 
( [ORG REFTEL  ] A ) A REPRIEVE UNTIL AFTER THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On December 10 , 2009 , President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] signed Presidential Decree number 7029 , which postponed the criminal and stiffer penalties for violations of the [ORG Forest Code  ] . 
This new Decree creates the [ORG Program Mais Ambiente  ] ( or " More Environment " ) that provides a three year period for all land owners to register their lands with the competent government authority . 
In order to become legal , the landholder will need to register the size of the legal reserve with appropriate documentation and in case the reserve size is under the 80 percent , the landholder must enter an agreement with the government , committing to correct this problem . 
To calm the environmental sector , President [PER Lula  ] decided that there will be fines and criminal penalties for those landholders who do not register their holdings under the program and those who are not in compliance with the [ORG Forest Code  ] 's reserve requirements starting June 11 , 2011 , giving errant landholders at least an 18 months' reprieve . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Agriculture Minister [PER Reinhold Stephanes  ] supported the decision by saying that if Presidente [PER Lula  ] hadn't set a new deadline over three million agricultural producers would have become criminals . 
Out of that total , one million farmers and ranchers would have likely been in a position to lose their land . 
Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] sought to make the best of the decision . 
He stated that " The [ [ORG Mais Ambiente  ] ] [ORG Program  ] will help those producers who want to protect the environment to make their property legal . 
The [ORG Program gives  ] a hand to those who want to protect the environment , which is mandatory . 
" COMMENT . 
It is no surprise that the government stepped away from turning millions of farmers and ranchers into criminals who could potential lose their land ; especially in light of the upcoming October 2010 national elections . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The vocal environmental community had foreseen the [ORG GOB  ] 's lack of support for the [ORG Forest Code  ] . 
Back in October 2009 , a group made of fifteen important environmental non-governmental organizations ( [ORG NGOs  ] ) wrote an open letter criticizing the [ORG GOB  ] 's efforts to make , what they considered one of [LOC Brazil  ] 's most important environmental legislation , less stringent . 
These [ORG NGOs  ] contended that the [ORG Forest Code  ] is not as draconian as painted by the rural lobby . 
The fines and penalties are supposed to be implemented in a flexible way . 
For example , sanctions for violations of the [ORG Code  ] are to be imposed after a determination that a violation has taken place and the landholder has been officially notified . 
After notification , a landholder would normally have 180 days to solve any pending issues with the authorities . 
( NOTE: As a practical matter , identifying and notifying violators would be a slow process due to the size of the [LOC Amazon  ] and the limited staff in the region , as well as the lack of information about particular landholdings . 
If the [ORG GOB  ] becomes serious about penalizing the large number of landholders in violation of the [ORG Forest Code  ] , the national government can expect stiff opposition and possibly even violent push back , like those that occurred in the municipality of [LOC Tailandia  ] last year after government raids on illegal loggers or in [LOC Novo Progresso  ] , where even [MISC Brazilian  ] researchers viewed as " snooping " around were run off . 
END NOTE ) LONG TERM SOLUTION NEEDED 8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Lula  ] 's postponement of the implementation of criminal penalties and fines for violation of the legal reserve only defers this controversial issue , but does not solve it . 
Currently , there are about thirty proposals in [ORG Congress  ] to modify the [ORG Forest Code  ] , most of which call for changing the legal reserve requirement . 
The [ORG National Agriculture Confederation  ] ( [ORG CNA  ] ) told Post that while they support efforts to reduce deforestation , they view the current 80 percent requirement as unworkable . 
There are a number of proposals to return the requirement to 50 percent , which would make it possible for large numbers of ranchers and farmers who couldn't economically sustain themselves at the 80 percent level to comply with the law . 
Environmental groups in [LOC Brazil  ] are divided on this step too . 
[ORG Greenpeace  ] calls reducing the requirement a sell-out , but [ORG Friends of the Earth  ] consider it a pragmatic and constructive step . 
The head of the [ORG Special Commission  ] in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] looking at amending the [ORG Forest Code  ] , [PER Aldo Rebelo  ] ( [ORG Communist Party-Sao Paulo  ] ) , wants to bring the proposed amendments to a vote in April , including one heavily criticized by environmentalists that would allow each state to establish the applicable legal reserve . 
In a recent press interview , [PER Rebelo  ] complained that the [ORG GOB  ] through the 2001 [MISC Provisory Measure  ] the [ORG GOB  ] had " altered the [ 1965 [ORG Forest Code  ] ] without listening to anyone . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the dispute over the 80 percent legal reserve requirement continues , a couple of practical solutions are coming into play . 
The [ORG Forest Code  ] provides ( [ORG Article  ] 16 ) that an [PER Economic-Ecological Zoning  ] ( [ORG ZEE  ] ) can reduce the legal reserve to 50 percent . 
The small western [MISC Amazonian  ] state of [LOC Acre  ] has a [ORG ZEE  ] in place and is taking advantage of this option . 
Unfortunately , this is not a solution for the whole region because of the lack of ZEEs ( it is an extremely complex and long study ) and , as a political matter , the government doesn't want to use this exception to throw out the 80 percent requirement on a wholesale basis . 
Another possible solution is being pursued by The [ORG Nature Conservancy  ] ( [ORG TNC  ] ) , which seeks to work with landowners to satisfy the 80 percent requirement by using compensatory land tracts . 
The concept is that the landholder instead of meeting the 80 percent requirement with its land would conserve the required amount of forests on other lands in the biome . 
This theoretically could work , but needs further development and approval by the government . 
MEANWHILE - REGISTERING TITLE <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While it remains an open question of when , if ever , and in what form the [ORG Forest Code  ] will be enforced , [LOC Brazil  ] is pursuing less controversial measures that may have a far greater impact on deforestation . 
These include establishing large protected areas and indigenous reserves , increasing law enforcement efforts against illegal land grabs , and cutting off financial credits for areas responsible for large amounts of deforestation . 
Moreover , the national and state governments have sought to clarify the murky question of land title in the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
In a January 2010 presentation , the [ORG World Bank  ] estimated that 85 percent of the land occupied by private interests ( which is about 30 percent of the total ) lacks documentation or are based on suspicious or fraudulent title documents . 
The government last year passed a law ( REFTEL B ) that creates a path for clear title for small parcels of land in the [LOC Amazon  ] region . 
Further , by tying financial credits to a municipality 's registration of land titles , the national government is giving an incentive for resolving the ownership question . 
For example , the municipality of Paragominas - previously one of the more prolific deforesters - should meet the registration requirement in a few months and its mayor has called for zero deforestation . 
Preliminary information suggests that when landholders obtain clear title they begin to behave more responsibly and reduce the rate of deforestation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: The [ORG Forest Code  ] 's 80 percent legal reserve requirement in the [LOC Amazon Forest  ] has generated much heated debate in [LOC Brazil  ] since its proposal in 1996 . 
Never having been implemented , it has served principally as a point of dispute between the agriculture and environmental communities , while others less controversial policies have been effective at reducing the deforestation rate in the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
Since coming into office , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] has overseen a decline in the rate of deforestation in the [LOC Amazon  ] from 21.5 thousand square kilometers in 2002 to 7.0 thousand last year . 
If the deforestation rate continues to drop , then the environmentalist community may be willing to show more flexibility about a pragmatic compromise on the [ORG Forest Code  ] when the issue comes up again in 2011 .
