( C ) SUMMARY: The [MISC Kazakhstani  ] authorities recently launched a well-publicized anti-corruption campaign that has resulted in the arrest of several high-ranking individuals , including the Minister of [ORG Environment  ] and a Deputy Minister of Defense , and in convictions of a number of others . 
The campaign appears to have the full support of President [PER Nazarbayev  ] , who has repeatedly called on the government and the ruling [ORG Nur Otan  ] party to battle this “most serious evil.” Political analysts and civil society leaders remain skeptical , however , that the government’s clean-up efforts will bring permanent results . 
Most see the campaign simply as evidence of a power struggle among elite groups within the [MISC Kazakhstani  ] government and doubt that any of the “biggest fish” will be affected . 
END SUMMARY . 
GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Kazakhstani  ] authorities recently launched a well-publicized anti-corruption campaign that seems to be aimed at the higher echelons of the government and has already brought down several senior individuals . 
Over the past two months , the [ORG Agency for Fighting Economic Crimes and Corruption  ] ( also known as the [ORG Financial Police  ] ) launched investigations against several government officials on suspicion of corruption and abuse of power . 
The list includes Minister of [ORG Environment  ] [PER Nurlan Iskakov  ] and two of his deputy ministers , the director of the [ORG Astana City Construction Company  ] and one of his deputies , the Chairman of the [ORG Water Resources Committee  ] , and the Director of the [ORG Astana Health Department  ] . 
All of the officials have been removed from their positions and are currently in detention or under house arrest pending the outcome of investigations against them . 
Investigations have also been launched against numerous mid-level officials and officials in local government , and two regional governors -- for [LOC South Kazakhstan  ] and [LOC East Kazakhstan  ] oblasts -- have been replaced and are under investigation . 
In addition , on April 13 , the [ORG Committee for National Security  ] ( [ORG KNB  ] ) detained Deputy Defense Minister [PER Kazhimurat Mayermanov  ] on suspicion of abuse of office ( i.e. , corruption ) in connection with government contracts with two [MISC Israeli  ] defense firms to design and manufacture new artillery systems. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several high-ranking government officials were charged or prosecuted for corruption-related crimes in an earlier “wave” last year . 
In August 2008 , [PER Yuriy Tleumuratov  ] , the Chairman of the [ORG Financial Control Committee  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , and [PER Ruslan Yusupov  ] , an office director in the same committee , were arrested and charged with bribery and abuse of power . 
( NOTE: [ORG Then-Tax Committee  ] Chairman [PER Nurlan Rahkmetov  ] resigned shortly thereafter , stating that ethics rules demand he share responsibility for the wrong-doings of his subordinates . 
Some commentators suggested , however , that he had been directly involved in the crimes . 
END NOTE . 
) In November 2008 , [PER Zhaksybek Kulekeyev  ] , the former chairman of the national railroad company [ORG Temir Zholy  ] , was convicted of accepting bribes and abusing his authority ( see ref A ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Perhaps the most high-profile official convicted of corruption-related crimes is [PER Serik Burkitbayev  ] , the former head of [ORG KazMunaiGaz  ] and a one-time advisor to President [PER Nazarbayev  ] ( see ref B ) . 
[PER Burkitbayev  ] was tried in a closed trial and convicted on March 24 for abuse of power , misappropriation of property , and embezzlement . 
His case , however , is surrounded by political intrigue -- [PER Burkitbayev  ] was at one point a close associate of [PER Rakhat Aliyev  ] , Nazarbayev’s exiled former son-in-law , and some press reports have suggested that his conviction was the result of his links to [PER Aliyev  ] rather than his corrupt dealings . 
Some media accounts claimed that [PER Burkitbayev  ] provided [PER Aliyev  ] with the eavesdropping equipment he apparently used to record embarrassing conversations among senior government officials which were later uploaded to the [MISC Internet  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] himself publicly criticized the conviction and vowed to bring the attention of the international community to the case . 
ORDER COMES FROM THE TOP <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The anti-corruption drive certainly has the highest backing . 
On April 1 , President [PER Nazarbayev  ] commended [MISC Financial Police  ] head [PER Kairat Kozhamzharov  ] for his anti-corruption efforts and told him to continue the fight “irrespective of people’s status and connections.” [PER Nazarbayev  ] has repeatedly called on the government and the ruling [ORG Nur Otan  ] party to battle this “most serious evil , ” and there is evidence that his words have been taken to heart . 
Following the President’s criticism of the “corrupt state” of the [ORG Shymkent Medical Academy  ] , the [ORG Health Ministry  ] reorganized it , shutting down all but three faculties and transferring close to three thousand students to other institutions . 
The [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( MVD ) recently announced that in response to “goals set forth by the President , ” the [ORG Ministry  ] will reorganize its hiring and promotion processes to increase transparency . 
And the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] publicly committed to cleaning up corruption at schools and universities . 
BIG FISH OR SMALL FRY ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite the high publicity surrounding the round-up of corrupt officials , independent analysts remain skeptical that the government’s clean-up efforts will bring permanent results . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us on April 7 that arrests of individual “wayward” officials will have little effect unless systemic corruption -- “the gray economy in government services” -- is addressed . 
Evidence of corrupt dealings could be dug up against numerous high-level government officials , argued [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] , so the decision about which officials to bring to justice becomes a purely political one . 
He predicted that the campaign will bring down the level of corruption in the short-term -- “some will think twice” -- but will have little effect on the system as a whole. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Political analyst [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] sees the recent convictions more as a sign of intra-elite warfare than evidence of a concerted anti-corruption effort . 
As evidence , he pointed to the cases of [LOC Kulikeyev  ] and [PER Burkitbayev  ] , both of whom [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes were convicted on marginal evidence . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] sees the anti-corruption effort as little more than a fight for property in uncertain economic times -- “the accused are the unlucky losers.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Civil society activist [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also describes the discredited officials as “the weak links in the chain” and believes that the “real sharks” are continuing to operate with impunity . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the criminal investigations themselves are hardly transparent and some , like the investigation against former Vice Minister of [ORG Environment Alzhan Braliyev  ] , are border-line illegal . 
( NOTE: A contact of our [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] who knows [ORG Braliyev  ] personally questioned the veracity of the evidence against him and maintained to us that he is “taking the fall” for his boss , former Minister of [ORG Environment  ] [PER Nurlan Iskakov  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that several of [MISC Bralieyev’s  ] associates and friends are coming together to fund his defense . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ascribed the recent “fury of activity” to new management at the [ORG Financial Police  ] . 
[PER Kozhamzharov  ] was appointed in December 2008 and was given what [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes were express orders from President [PER Nazarbayev  ] to clean up the government , “within reason , of course.” OPPOSITION LEADERS SEE EFFORTS AS “FUTILE” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Key opposition leaders also voiced skepticism about the efficacy of the anti-corruption efforts . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] sees the campaign as “selective punishment” that will not touch the highest echelons of the government . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXdescribed it as a power struggle between leading elite groups “with corruption used as an excuse.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested that the campaign was aimed at eliminating the competition of [PER Nazarbayev  ] son-in-law [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] , who [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes has been selected as his successor . 
( COMMENT: XXXXXXXXXXXX’s view appears to be a bit off base , since Kulibayev’s strongest competitors as potential [PER Nazarbayev  ] successors -- such as Astana Mayor [PER Imangali Tasmagambetov  ] -- have not been affected by the anti-corruption campaign . 
END COMMENT . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that Kazakhstan’s endemic corruption problems can only be addressed through appropriate changes to legislation -- “all else is futile.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Corruption is endemic among [MISC Kazakhstani  ] officialdom , as it is across the [ORG CIS  ] . 
Blessed with strong tax revenues , government salaries are high in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] compared to its neighbors -- for example , Prime Minister Masimov’s salary is over $50,000 a year -- but most senior officials live lifestyles that require much higher incomes . 
In many instances , they receive profits from businesses registered in the names of their spouses or other relatives . 
In other cases , they’re stealing directly from the public trough . 
The officials taken down by the anti-corruption campaign are thus just a tiny fraction of those with dirt on their hands . 
The ongoing anti-corruption campaign does appear to be targeting some officials who have gone too far -- and don’t have adequate protection from above to ward off the law enforcement authorities . 
In other cases , however , it seems likely that officials no more corrupt than any one else have been targeted by rivals taking advantage of the anti-corruption campaign to bring them down . 
END COMMENT .
