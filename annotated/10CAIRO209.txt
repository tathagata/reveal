Prevalence and [ORG Sectored Distribution of Exploitive Child Labor  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) There are no current comprehensive studies of the extent of exploitative child labor in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
In late 2009 , [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Manpower and Migration and Migration  ] ( [ORG MOMM  ] ) announced that it had reached agreement with the [ORG ILO  ] to conduct a comprehensive child labor study , with technical and financial support from the [ORG ILO  ] . 
In a 2001 study released in 2006 , the government reported that 2.7 million children were engaged in some form of labor , although not necessarily exploitative . 
Street children are especially vulnerable to labor exploitation . 
While some independent experts believe that there may be up to one million street children in [LOC Egypt  ] , government experts - citing a 2009 survey of central [LOC Cairo  ] conducted with technical and financial assistance from the [ORG World Bank  ] and the [ORG Arab Urban Development Institute  ] which identified approximately 5200 street children - believe the number to be significantly lower . 
[ORG NGOs  ] report that street children work as beggars , street vendors and in prostitution . 
Children , including street children , are subject to domestic servitude , but there are no reliable statistics . 
Children are also recruited for seasonal agricultural work . 
A credible local labor rights organizations estimates that up to 3.5 million [MISC Egyptian  ] children may work in the agricultural sector during harvest season . 
Local experts estimate that 60% of working children are employed in the agricultural sector . 
According to local [ORG NGOs  ] , some children employed in domestic and agricultural work may face conditions of involuntary servitude , restrictions on movement , non-payment of wages , threats , and physical abuse . 
In recent years , [ORG NGOs  ] have documented children working in hazardous conditions in stone quarries in the [LOC Minya  ] area. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The government did not publish data on exploitative child labor . 
2B . 
Laws and Regulations <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In 2008 , [LOC Egypt  ] amended its [ORG Child Protection Law  ] to raise the minimum working ages from fourteen to fifteen years for regular employment and from twelve to thirteen years for seasonal employment . 
( [PER Law  ] 126 of the Year 2008 ) . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG Labor Law  ] ( [PER Law  ] 12 of the Year 2003 ) permits children to enroll in apprenticeship programs beginning at age 12 . 
A 2003 decree by the [ORG MOMM  ] barred children under 18 from 44 hazardous occupations ( Decree 118 of the Year 2003 ) . 
The 2008 [ORG Child Protection Law  ] amendments criminalized any " abuse , trafficking , sexual harassment and commercial or economic abuse of children " and also criminalized the production or broadcasting of " pornographic materials involving children . 
" [LOC Egypt  ] has ratified [ORG ILO Conventions  ] 138 regarding the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and 182 concerning the [ORG Worst Forms of Child Labor.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The legal and regulatory framework of [LOC Egypt  ] is generally adequate for addressing exploitive child labor in the formal , non-agricultural sector . 
However , enforcement is inconsistent especially in the informal sector which comprises up to 80% of the economy . 
Moreover , [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG Labor Law  ] ( [ORG Law  ] 12 of 2003 ) , does not apply to child workers engaged in agricultural , domestic service , or employed by family owned businesses .

Government Policies on Child Labor <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] has a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the worst forms of child labor . 
In 2006 , the [ORG MSFP  ] , working with [ORG MOMM  ] , the [ORG Egyptian Trade Union Federation  ] ( [ORG ETUF  ] ) , the [ORG ILO  ] , [ORG UNICEF  ] and the [ORG Ministries of Social Solidarity  ] , Agriculture , Health and Interior developed [LOC Egypt  ] 's " [ORG First National Strategy  ] for the Elimination of Child Labor . 
" Throughout 2009 , [ORG MSFP  ] continued to implement the national strategy , a key component of which is a [ORG U.S. Department of Labor  ] funded project implemented by the [ORG World Food Program  ] to remove children for the work force and to identify and closely monitor other " at risk " children . 
In late 2009 , the [ORG MOMM  ] and [ORG ILO  ] entered into an agreement whereby CAPMAS , the government statistical agency , would perform an comprehensive survey of child labor in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Also in 2009 , the [ORG MOMM  ] announced that it had formed a committee of government , trade union and employer representatives to develop a national action plan , based on the 2006 strategy , to combat the worst forms of child labor. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Through its [ORG National Strategy  ] , the government incorporates exploitive child labor as an issue to be addressed in other social policies. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

( [ORG U  ] ) Not applicable 2F . 
Social Programs to Eliminate or Prevent Child Labor <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The cornerstone of the government 's child labor prevention effort is the [ORG National Protection Program  ] , under the auspices of the [ORG MSFP  ] , an initiative to identify and monitor children at risk for labor exploitation . 
A component of the [ORG National Protection Program  ] is a [ORG World Food Program  ] ( [ORG WFP  ] ) project to remove children from the workforce and provide them intensive social services . 
In addition , the [ORG MSFP  ] 's child labor unit promotes public awareness of the issue through media campaigns through its [ORG National Observatory for Child Rights  ] , initiated in January 2009 in partnership with [ORG UNICEF.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Through the [ORG National Protection Program  ] , the government incorporated child labor specifically as an issue to be addressed in its social programs. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) While no statistics are available on government child labor efforts , 11,000 at risk children and children removed from the labor force are included in a data base developed as part of the [ORG WFP  ] project .

( [ORG U  ] ) Not applicable <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .

2G . 
Continual Progress <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Challenges , especially wide-spread poverty and the traditional practice of employing children in seasonal agricultural work , continue but the government appears to be making serious efforts towards eliminating the worst forms of child labor , including through efforts to enforce the amendments to the [ORG Child Protection Law  ] enacted in 2008 , its agreement in 2009 to conduct a survey , in compliance with international standards , to assess exploitative child labor in [LOC Egypt  ] , and the formation in 2009 of a committee to develop a national action plan . 
While child labor , driven by tradition and poverty , remains a problem , [ORG NGOs  ] report that public and government awareness of the problem and concern for the well-being of impoverished children is on the rise .
