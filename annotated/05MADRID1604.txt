Robert Manzanares  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In a meeting with Charge April 22 , Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Jose Bono  ] said the only reason [LOC Spain  ] was selling military ships to [LOC Venezuela  ] was to help troubled [ORG Izar  ] shipyard . 
Protesting [ORG Izar  ] workers had put a lot of pressure on the [ORG Zapatero  ] government , said [PER Bono  ] . 
He assured Charge that none of the ships would have offensive capabilities . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] " is with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" on international security issues , such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but it seems the [LOC U.S.  ] only focuses on the problems in the [MISC Spain-U.S.  ] relationship . 
[PER Bono  ] hopes his May 3 meeting with [PER SecDef Rumsfeld  ] is very positive and shows [MISC Spanish  ] voters the countries' defense relations are excellent . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On the sale to [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Bono  ] asked Charge not to pay attention to press accounts of the sale because " every time the press talks about it we're selling something different . 
" The opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] is interested in ruining relations between the [ORG Zapatero  ] and [ORG Bush  ] administrations and so fuels inaccurate media accounts of the sale . 
[LOC Spain  ] , said [PER Bono  ] , is selling a total of eight patrol ships to the [PER Chavez  ] government and 12 transport planes . 
The planes will have no armaments and the patrol ships will have only machine guns . 
Neither the planes nor the ships will be used offensively . 
Charge countered the notion that the [ORG USG  ] 's concern about the sale was related to [LOC U.S.  ] commercial interests . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] believed the sale would contribute to [PER Chavez'  ] military might and political credibility and would make him more able to destabilize the region and continue his anti-democratic maneuvers in his own country. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] said that if he spoke [MISC English  ] he would have called [PER Rumsfeld  ] himself to explain why [LOC Spain  ] was making this sale . 
He said it boiled down to saving the ailing state-owned shipyard [ORG Izar  ] . 
[ORG Izar  ] 's workers have been protesting against [ORG Zapatero  ] government , clamoring for a fix for the company 's financial woes . 
[PER Bono  ] said the [LOC Venezuela  ] sale was one way the [ORG Zapatero  ] government could significantly help [ORG Izar  ] . 
The sale would be [ORG Izar  ] 's biggest in the last 10 years . 
[PER Bono  ] added that he had informed [MISC Colombian  ] president Uribe of the sale , and he raised no objections. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In addition , said [PER Bono  ] , other [MISC European  ] countries with good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] sell military equipment to [LOC Venezuela  ] , such as [LOC Sweden  ] . 
Also , the [LOC U.S.  ] does not limit military sales only to democratic countries -- the [LOC U.S.  ] sells military equipment to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] said [LOC Spain  ] is " with the [LOC United States  ] , " and has demonstrated this by deciding to lead a provincial reconstruction team and forward support base in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He noted that even though the [ORG Aznar  ] government wanted to take [MISC Spanish  ] troops out of [LOC Kosovo  ] , the [ORG Zapatero  ] government has decided to leave them there . 
He also cited [LOC Spain  ] 's troop presence in [LOC Haiti  ] as another example of [LOC Spain  ] 's willingness to cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] on international security matters . 
When considering how loyal [LOC Spain  ] has been as an ally , the [LOC U.S.  ] should also look at the access [LOC Spain  ] has continued to give [LOC U.S.  ] troops at [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] military bases . 
" It seems , " [PER Bono  ] said , " that we are doing everything the [LOC U.S.  ] wants , but the [LOC U.S.  ] still doesn't like what we're doing . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] said he hopes his visit to [LOC Washington  ] will show the [MISC Spanish  ] public that relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] are excellent . 
" I have to show my clients the trip was worth it , was very productive " commented [PER Bono  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] reminded Charge that he was the only minister to attend the [ORG Embassy  ] 's election night party in November . 
" We would like to be rewarded for our cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] , not required to pay a toll , " said the minister. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to the [MISC S-80  ] submarine weapons system contract , [PER Bono  ] said the [MISC Spanish  ] government is nearing a decision on the deal . 
He said the two [MISC American  ] companies vying for the deal are well positioned , but [MISC French  ] president [ORG Chirac  ] has asked [ORG Zapatero  ] to give the contract to a [MISC French  ] company . 
[PER Bono  ] intimated that the [MISC S-80  ] contract had the potential to improve [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations and is " not just a project to build four submarines , " said [PER Bono  ] , " but will involve future contracts for 35-40 years . 
" If awarded to an [MISC American  ] company , the contract would also increase interoperability between the [MISC Spanish  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] navies. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] also said he hoped he could get closure from Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] on the releasability to [LOC Spain  ] of the SIPDIS [MISC Tomahawk  ] missile . 
Charge mentioned that [ORG Embassy  ] had the impression based on meetings with high-ranking members of the [MISC Spanish  ] military that [LOC Spain  ] was undecided about purchasing the missile if it were made available . 
" We want the [MISC Tomahawk  ] , " said [PER Bono  ] , " I want to be clear on that . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Bono  ] is a [ORG Socialist Party  ] " baron " whom [ORG Zapatero  ] narrowly beat out in 2000 to lead the party . 
He is one of the Socialists' main [MISC Catholic  ] conservatives and remains one of the most popular political figures in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He thus has considerable influence and popularity if not lengthy experience with substantive defense issues . 
And while the chief of defense is well respected , he defers to [PER Bono  ] , as do the services. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment continued: [PER Bono  ] took pains to convince us the only reason [LOC Spain  ] was selling military equipment to the [PER Chavez  ] government was to help ailing [ORG Izar  ] . 
Although saving [ORG Izar  ] is likely the principal reason for the sale , [ORG Zapatero  ] 's interest in engaging [PER Chavez  ] is no doubt another goal . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] believes that by engaging [PER Chavez  ] , he can gain some influence over him . 
[PER Bono  ] 's remarks also show he believes [LOC Spain  ] has not gotten enough credit from the [LOC U.S.  ] for its cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and other areas , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] government is focusing only on the problem areas in our relations with [LOC Spain  ] , not on the positives .
