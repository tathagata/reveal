Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] does not currently have an established security dialogue with [LOC Libya  ] . 
However , [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , Muatassim al-Qadhafi , expressed his interest in establishing a political-military ( pol-mil ) dialogue during his April 2009 meeting with the Secretary in [LOC Washington  ] ( Ref B ) . 
The Embassy 's country team views the establishment of a bilateral pol-mil dialogue as valuable to enhanced strategic engagement with [LOC Libya  ] and in this geopolitically important region . 
We aim to achieve the following objectives , among others , within the context of a bilateral pol-mil dialogue: -- [LOC Libya  ] 's participation in the [ORG Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership  ] ( [ORG TSCTP  ] ) , in which [LOC Libya  ] is currently reluctant to take part ; -- Signing of the [MISC Section 505 End-User Agreement  ] ; -- Discussing budget transparency ; -- Addressing [LOC Libya  ] 's Foreign Military Sales interests ; -- Addressing [LOC Libya  ] 's concerns about the eight [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG C-130  ] 's in [LOC Marietta  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] ; -- [LOC Libya  ] 's acceptance of [ORG MANPAD  ] 's destruction and humanitarian demining assistance ; -- [LOC Libya  ] 's fulfillment of its [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG SCUD-B  ] destruction ) commitments ; -- [MISC Libyan  ] contribution of helicopters to [MISC UNAMID  ] ; -- Increased [MISC Libyan  ] cooperation with [ORG AFRICOM  ] ; and -- Civil-Military training and seminar opportunities ( [ORG International Military Education and Training  ] , [ORG Marshall Center/NESA/Africa Center for Strategic Studies  ] ) . 
2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Embassy envisions the launching of the dialogue by the [ORG A/S for Political and Military Affairs  ] and most likely the [ORG Libyan National Security Advisor  ] , during the early part of 2010 . 
Recent discussions with senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials have made it clear that it will be difficult to make progress on the many disparate elements of our security agenda without an overall framework and single point of contact to marshal [LOC Libya  ] 's slow-moving and inefficient bureaucracy . 
Based on previous discussions with the [MISC Libyan  ] Government , it appears that [ORG NSA  ] Muatassim al-Qadhafi would be that person . 
We appreciate the [ORG Department 's  ] assistance in moving forward the bilateral agenda through the launching of a political-military dialogue with [LOC Libya  ] .
