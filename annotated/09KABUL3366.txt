( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: Provincial authorities in [LOC Kunduz  ] , increasingly alarmed at the deterioration of the security situation in the province , have turned to a last resort: supporting local mujahedeen commanders to fight the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
While supporting local commanders has some short-term security benefits , these are likely to come at the expense of formal institutions such as the police if there is no outlook for their future integration into the [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) . 
One neighboring governor , [PER Atta Mohammad Noor  ] in [ORG Balkh Province  ] , disagreed with the arming of local militias in [LOC Kunduz  ] , and the outgoing [MISC German  ] commander of [LOC RC-North  ] also signaled his concern . 
We will continue to monitor the evolution of this local defense initiative and similar ones throughout the country . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Kunduz  ] Governor Eng . 
[PER Mohammad Omar  ] and [ORG National Directorate of Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) officials announced at a September 13th weekly meeting on security issues with the [ORG PRT  ] and others that they were providing support to local militias to combat the insurgency . 
[LOC Kunduz  ] Deputy [ORG NDS  ] Chief [PER Karim Atrafi  ] told [ORG State PRTOff  ] that , for the past two months , [ORG NDS  ] has been paying mujahedeen commanders so that they could buy arms on the local market . 
[PER Atrafi  ] added a positive spin on the program , arguing that it was driving up the cost of arms on the market , making it more expensive for the [ORG Taliban  ] to do business . 
[PER Atrafi  ] asserted that the support provided by [ORG NDS  ] was financial only ( i.e. not in the form of arms ) and that the militia forces were under the authority of the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Based on conversations with the Governor , [ORG NDS  ] , [ORG UNAMA  ] , and the [ORG PRT  ] 's J-9 , it appears the effort to support mujahedeen commanders to fight the insurgency has focused on the districts of [LOC Imam Saheb  ] ( northern [LOC Kunduz  ] province ) , [LOC Khanabad  ] ( eastern [LOC Kunduz  ] ) , and [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] ( northwestern [LOC Kunduz  ] ) . 
According to [ORG NDS  ] , in [LOC Chahar Dara  ] district insurgent infiltration was too high for a similar effort to be feasible , but the September 4 coalition airstrike disrupted the insurgent network in [LOC Chahar Dara  ] to such an extent that [ORG NDS  ] has also begun efforts there to support friendly militias. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In [LOC Khanabad  ] district , the power broker behind the militias is the [MISC Tajik  ] commander [PER Mir Alam  ] , who was formerly police chief of [LOC Baghlan  ] and who , according to many observers , has ambitions on the post of [LOC Kunduz  ] provincial police chief . 
[PER Mir Alam  ] 's sub-commanders have reportedly driven out [ORG Taliban  ] from villages in the volatile area of [LOC Aqtash  ] ; however there are conflicting accounts from [ORG ANP  ] and other sources regarding whether this was done more through negotiation or actual fighting. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In [LOC Imam Saheb  ] , members of the [MISC Uzbek  ] [PER Ibrahimi  ] family ( who hold several key government positions in the area , including [PER Imam Saheb  ] district police chief , Governor of neighboring [LOC Takhar  ] province , and a seat in parliament ) have , along with local commanders and community elders , pressed [LOC Kunduz  ] authorities to provide them with arms and ammunition . 
We understand that authorities initially told them they should have enough arms in their possession to resist the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
However , when the commanders themselves came under threat from insurgents , authorities relented and agreed to have [ORG NDS  ] provide them with a limited quantity of weapons. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In [LOC Qala-e-Zal  ] , militias controlled by [MISC Turkmen  ] commander [PER Nabi Gichi  ] have had some success in fighting the insurgency in the northern part of the district . 
According to the Governor and [ORG NDS  ] , [PER Gichi  ] 's forces killed twenty insurgents and convinced a [ORG Taliban  ] commander to join the government side . 
[PER Gov. Omar  ] suggested at a recent meeting that [PER Gichi  ] should be brought into a government position. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Atta Mohammad Noor  ] , the Governor of [ORG Balkh Province  ] , has publicly criticized the move to arm local militias in [LOC Kunduz  ] . 
When Ambassador [PER Wayne  ] visited [LOC RC-North  ] on October 1 , outgoing [ORG RC-North Commander  ] [PER Vollmer  ] briefed on his perspective of the sources of instability and violence , but signaled that he was not comfortable with the use of militias to counter the problem . 
He said what was needed was about 2500 more police in the province. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Provincial authorities have become increasingly frustrated over the past several months over the rapidly deteriorating security situation in [LOC Kunduz  ] province and what they see as the lack of adequate [ORG ANSF  ] ( particularly [ORG ANP  ] ) and ISAF forces to take on the insurgency . 
The effort to support local militias to combat the insurgency is a sign of how deeply frustrated , almost desperate , [LOC KABUL  ] 00003366 002 OF 002 they have become . 
Their willingness to discuss these efforts , the legality of which is not clear , suggests they have received a green light as well as funding from someone in the central government in [LOC Kabul.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Beyond reversing even the limited progress toward disarmament made under [ORG DDR  ] ( Disarmament , Demobilization and Reintegration ) and [ORG DIAG  ] ( Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups ) programs , the implications of supporting local militias to combat the insurgency are both complex and uncertain . 
In many cases , these militias are likely considerably stronger in both numbers and arms than the under-staffed and under-equipped police , which puts the official assertion of MoI/ANP control over the militias in doubt . 
In addition , provincial authorities do not appear to have plans to integrate these militias into the [ORG ANSF  ] , raising questions about how long funding for them will continue and what will become of them ( and their arms ) once the threat from the insurgency is mitigated. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The short-term security benefits of supporting militias led by mujahedeen commanders are significant . 
However , these benefits are likely to come at the expense of [MISC Afghan  ] institutions such as the [ORG ANP  ] if support to militias is not coupled with [MISC GIRoA  ] monitoring , stepped-up efforts to build up the [ORG ANP  ] and a plan to eventually draw down and disarm the militias or integrate them into [ORG ANSF  ] . 
In particular , the effort is likely to undermine Gen. [PER Abdul Rizzaq Yaqubi  ] , an unusually competent and professional provincial police chief , while at the same time strengthening former commander [PER Mir Alam  ] , a figure with a history of human rights abuses and administrative incompetence as police chief of [LOC Baghlan  ] . 
Mission will continue to monitor closely the evolution of this local defense initiative and similar ones throughout the country .
