( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary: Although  ] an alluring market for the oil and gas industry , [LOC Libya  ] is an exceptionally difficult place in which to operate . 
In their daily operations , international oil companies ( [ORG IOC  ] 's ) face numerous challenges on visas , staffing and taxation issues , and their profit margins are comparatively narrow . 
The situation is likely to worsen in coming years , as [MISC Libyan  ] authorities seek to extract additional concessions from energy companies operating in the country to maximize [LOC Libya  ] 's profits , even at the expense of continuing to attract further participation by reputable [ORG IOCs  ] in the critical oil and gas sector that is the nation 's lifeblood . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The results of [LOC Libya  ] 's latest Exploration and Production Sharing ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) bid round , which is focused on natural gas , are due to be released December 9 , and the country appears to be moving ahead with plans to develop its oil and gas industry . 
The [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) has implemented three successful [ORG EPSA  ] bid rounds since January 2005 , and has also concluded lucrative one-off deals with major international oil companies ( [ORG IOCs  ] ) to develop new territories ( ref A ) . 
The third ( i.e. , most recent ) [ORG EPSA  ] round , has attracted almost 60 companies from more than 25 countries as operators and investors . 
With more than forty [ORG IOCs  ] already operating in [LOC Libya  ] and oil prices at record highs , it would seem that the sector is the place to be in [LOC Libya  ] ; however , [ORG IOCs  ] describe it as an extremely challenging environment that consistently tests their patience and financial limits . 
What follows is a summary of some of the most pressing difficulties they face ; Post will outline challenges faced by oil service companies septel . 
[ORG NOC  ] TAKES A HARD LINE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition to renegotiating existing agreements to extract additional concessions ( ref B ) , the [ORG NOC  ] is taking a hard line in a number of other areas . 
The general sense in the [ORG GOL  ] appears to be that the [ORG NOC  ] holds all the cards . 
[ORG NOC  ] Chairman [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] put it a bit more diplomatically at the recent [ORG World Energy Congress  ] in [LOC Rome  ] , where he said the [ORG NOC  ] is in a position to dictate policies that reflect " changing conditions " in energy markets . 
The fierce competition among [ORG IOCs  ] to enter the [MISC Libyan  ] market and book reserves has fed the [ORG NOC  ] 's perception that it is a seller 's market . 
It has also led to the reality that [LOC Libya  ] features some of the smallest profit margins in the world for [ORG IOCs  ] . 
One senior [ORG IOC  ] official , whose company produces oil in partnership with a state-run firm , recently said his firm makes the same profit in a neighboring country in which its production is only one-quarter that of its production in [LOC Libya  ] . 
That dramatic difference underscores the comparatively high operating costs for oil/gas producers in [LOC Libya  ] and raises grave doubts about the profitability of deals agreed in the last two [ORG EPSA  ] bid rounds , which featured razor-thin production sharing factors , reportedly as low as 6.8 percent of future production in at least one case. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG NOC  ] appears to be actively looking for ways to extract additional concessions , or to cut services previously provided to the [ORG IOCs  ] . 
Part of this may be the result of the fact that the [ORG NOC  ] is unable to effectively stave off other players in the bureaucracy , particularly the powerful General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] ) for [ORG Manpower  ] , Training and Employment . 
Led by long-time cabinet minister and regime insider [PER Matug Matug  ] , the ministry has been one of the most active in pressuring [ORG IOC  ] 's to hire greater numbers of [MISC Libyans  ] , many of whom are unqualified , The [ORG NOC  ] is striking hard bargains with thin profit margins at the same time that it is asking [ORG IOCs  ] to absorb ever-increasing costs -- direct and indirect -- for work done in [LOC Libya  ] . 
The end result is a substantially more difficult and less profitable operating environment that has given [ORG IOCs  ] pause to consider how seriously they want to pursue further concessions . 
HERE , HAVE A MANAGER .. . 
BETTER YET , HAVE TWO <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The increasingly restrictive labor regulations for [ORG IOCs  ] and service companies , mandated by the [ORG GPC  ] for [ORG Manpower  ] , Training and Employment are particularly onerous . 
The [ORG GPC  ] for [ORG Manpower  ] recently directed that for every new expatriate hired by an [ORG IOC  ] , one [MISC Libyan  ] must be added to the company payroll as [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000979 002 OF 003 well . 
It is required that certain key positions in [LOC IOCs'  ] local offices - deputy country manager , finance manager and human resources manager - be staffed by [MISC Libyans  ] . 
Companies have tried various ways to comply with these requirements , from hiring competent managers away from [MISC NOC-run  ] companies to hiring and immediately marginalizing an " empty suit " employee . 
Other tactics include adding a lightly disguised expatriate layer atop the position encumbered by a [MISC Libyan  ] and stalling with respect to encumbering positions designated for [MISC Libyan  ] nationals . 
Expatriate [ORG IOC  ] representatives consistently bemoan the time and training required to bring new [MISC Libyan  ] hires up to speed ; a lack of candidates with professional fluency in [MISC English  ] and other basic skills is a persistent problem . 
[ORG IOC  ] managers stress that they invest considerable time and resources training locally-engaged staff everywhere in the world ; however , they describe [MISC Libyan  ] employees as being less able upon hiring than most , necessitating longer , more costly training . 
[ORG VISA WOES  ] CONTINUE TO RANKLE <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the heart of the [LOC IOCs'  ] struggle to succeed in [LOC Libya  ] 's difficult operating environment is the constant difficulty of obtaining visas and work permits . 
The [ORG NOC  ] has increasingly used visas and residency permits as a tool by which to enforce compliance with the " hire [MISC Libyan  ] " policy , refusing to issue visas or residency permits to expatriates encumbering deputy manager , finance manager or [ORG HR  ] manager slots . 
Expatriate employees often have to leave the country as their residency permit runs out and remain outside the country for weeks or months while their company works to get the permit renewed . 
Many companies are forced to use two-week business visas , which may be renewed twice , for up to six total weeks in country . 
The [MISC Byzantine  ] visa requirements put a tremendous administrative burden on [ORG IOCs  ] , which typically maintain up to a half-dozen locally-engaged employees to work on nothing but visas and residency permits . 
The [ORG GPC  ] for [ORG Manpower  ] 's edict that a new [MISC Libyan  ] employee be hired for each new expatriate hired has an additional , visa-related wrinkle: for each renewal of a one-year visa for an expatriate employee , an additional [MISC Libyan  ] employee must be hired . 
An expatriate employee staying on for three years could be accountable for the addition of four [MISC Libyan  ] employees ( one counterpart at hiring plus one for each visa issued ) . 
The [ORG NOC  ] reportedly opposes this requirement , but has been trumped by the [ORG GPC  ] for [ORG Manpower  ] . 
THE TAX MAN COMETH <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Various arms of the [MISC Libyan  ] government are also working to extract additional tax revenue from energy sector activities . 
This is reflected in the imposition of a two percent " Stamp Tax , " which will be assessed on all contracts falling under the December [ORG EPSA  ] round and all new contracts signed after that . 
This tax has been sporadically applied to other areas of the economy , specifically where foreign investment is involved , since it first appeared on the books in 1955 . 
An effort by the [ORG Libyan Tax Authority  ] to collect it on contracts under previous [ORG EPSA  ] rounds was successfully contested by the affected companies , leading to the [ORG Tax Authority  ] 's announcement that all future contracts would be subject to it . 
There is also a move afoot to extract additional tax revenue from offshore exploration and drilling . 
The [ORG GOL  ] had previously allowed the servicing of these activities out of [LOC Malta  ] , but is now moving to curtail that and to require that they be based out of [LOC Libya  ] . 
The relocation of onshore support services for offshore operations generates considerable income for the [ORG Tax Authority  ] ; offshore drilling operations can cost up to $750,000 per day for deep-water operations . 
In addition , the [ORG NOC  ] recently decided it would no longer act as an intermediary between the [ORG IOCs  ] and the [ORG Tax Authority  ] . 
[ORG IOCs  ] have been forced to hire additional staff and devote considerable resources to parsing through [LOC Libya  ] 's amorphous tax system to determine what their obligations are and how to meet them . 
RISING SALARIES GUTTING STATE-RUN COMPANIES <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] 's state-owned companies continue to protest what they consider to be unreasonably high rates for expatriate labor , and have attempted to hold a line at the rate schedule employed in 2002 during the sanctions period . 
Overall salaries [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000979 003 OF 003 have risen about ten percent for each of the past two years , but the state-owned operator oil companies ( e.g. , [ORG Waha  ] , [ORG Zeuitina  ] ) still lag well behind the [ORG IOCs  ] in terms of compensation . 
They are accordingly hemorrhaging seasoned workers , who are taking advantage of high international demand for oil/gas worker to leave [LOC Libya  ] for more lucrative opportunities in the [LOC Gulf  ] and elsewhere . 
As the state-run firms fail to offer competitive wages for expatriate workers , they are unable to fill current vacancies . 
An example is the state-run firm [ORG Waha  ] , which has at least 100 expatriate vacancies at present , constituting roughly one third of its expatriate workforce . 
The situation affects not only these companies and the [ORG NOC  ] , but also the [ORG IOCs  ] that depend on state-run firms as operating partners . 
This is the arrangement for almost all companies engaged in production and export activities . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's decision ( under Law No. 43 of 2006 ) to pull back the [ORG NOC  ] 's procurement offices in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Dusseldorf  ] ( [PER Umm Jawaby  ] and [LOC Medoil  ] , respectively ) also creates problems for state-run firms , which have had their supply lines interrupted by the disruption of a long-established logistics system and the ongoing movement of more than two hundred state employees from [LOC Europe  ] back to [LOC Libya  ] . 
9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [LOC Libya  ] 's oil and gas sector is in many respects the bellwether for the rest of its emerging economy . 
The fact that [ORG IOCs  ] , which successfully operate in some of the most forbidding environments in the world , are having such a difficult time underscores how far the [ORG GOL  ] has to go in terms of reform if it is to achieve its stated goal of attracting greater foreign investment and commercial interest to [LOC Libya  ] . 
We consistently hear expressions of disappointment from senior [ORG GOL  ] officials that more [LOC U.S.  ] firms have not rushed to enter [LOC Libya  ] 's market since sanctions were lifted and [LOC Libya  ] was removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list . 
Pernicious requirements such as the " one expat-one [MISC Libyan  ] " hiring policy and capricious visa policies , however , do nothing to encourage other [LOC U.S.  ] and foreign companies with less international experience than the [ORG IOCs  ] to enter the [MISC Libyan  ] market .
