( C ) On March 6 , [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador to [LOC France  ] [PER Fernando Cepeda Ulloa  ] described [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] relations as " poor " in a breakfast meeting with Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] and [ORG WHA PDAS  ] [PER Craig Kelly  ] . 
[PER Cepeda  ] encapsulated the current distrust between the two governments by suggesting that the [LOC GOF  ] considers [LOC Colombia  ] a banana republic that takes policy direction from the [LOC United States  ] . 
He complained that the [LOC GOF  ] coordinates public messaging with [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] hostage [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] 's family in a way that undermines President [PER Uribe.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Cepeda  ] recalled that under [ORG Chirac  ] he felt only limited pressure concerning [PER Betancourt  ] . 
[ORG Chirac  ] simply urged [PER Cepeda  ] to tell President [PER Uribe  ] that " a military solution is not the best option . 
" There was little movement on the issue until [PER Sarkozy  ] took office in May 2007 . 
Since then , [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] relations have essentially been compressed to this single issue , according to [PER Cepeda  ] , who is reportedly close to President [PER Uribe  ] . 
He attributed President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's single-minded focus on securing [PER Betancourt  ] 's freedom to a personal enmity towards former Prime Minister [PER Dominique de Villepin  ] and the desire to prove [PER Sarkozy  ] could accomplish what [PER Villepin  ] could not . 
He described the [PER Betancourt  ] family efforts to publicize [PER Ingrid  ] 's detention as a textbook media success and a textbook disaster to achieving her freedom . 
Despite his claim of " poor " overall relations , [PER Cepeda  ] did note that [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] relations were positive with fruitful cultural exchanges , and welcome trade and investment flows . 
There is also good bilateral counter-narcotics cooperation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal involvement in the [ORG FARC  ] hostage case may have contributed to securing the release of some lower-profile hostages while perversely raising [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] , s value to the [ORG FARC  ] as a hostage . 
A desire to best his rival [PER de Villepin  ] , who failed after expending tremendous effort to win [PER Betancourt  ] 's freedom , may have triggered [PER Sarkozy  ] 's intervention . 
However , [PER Betancourt  ] , s long-standing public profile in [LOC France  ] predates [PER Sarkozy  ] 's presidency and release would have naturally appealed to [PER Sarkozy  ] as a challenge and as a demonstration of his ability to apply his will and bring results . 
Despite positive fundamentals in the [MISC Franco-Colombian  ] relationship , this hostage situation negatively colors what should be a good news story between [LOC France  ] and [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .
