( C ) SUMMARY: CODEL [PER Cardin  ] , in a February 18 meeting with President [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] , [PER FM Muallim  ] , [ORG Presidential Advisor for Political and Media Affairs Shaaban  ] , and Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Mustafa  ] conveyed [LOC U.S.  ] concerns regarding [LOC Iran  ] 's pursuit of a nuclear weapon , [MISC Syrian  ] human rights abuses , the [MISC Israel-Syria  ] peace process , upcoming [MISC Lebanese  ] elections , and [MISC Syrian  ] support for terrorism . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] encouraged the SARG to address these issues in order to lay the groundwork for a more productive future dialogue . 
[PER Asad  ] argued [LOC Syria  ] essentially shared the same position as the [LOC U.S.  ] on the majority of these issues , but [LOC Syria  ] 's approach toward solving these problems was clearly different . 
[PER Asad  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] needed to look at the larger regional political picture , as [LOC Syria  ] did , if it truly wanted to find satisfactory resolutions . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Asad  ] maintained [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring would ensure [LOC Iran  ] 's pursuit of nuclear power for civilian purposes only . 
Regarding human rights , [PER Asad  ] stated [LOC Syria  ] was making progress , but the [ORG CODEL  ] needed to understand this issue in the larger context of [LOC Israel  ] 's aggression in [LOC Gaza  ] , the suffering of [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees , and terrorist attacks on [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] rejected the notion that [LOC Syria  ] facilitated the transit of foreign fighters into [LOC Iraq  ] , pointedly asking the [ORG CODEL  ] what interest would he have in doing so ? 
The upcoming elections in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Asad  ] surmised , would not change the composition of the government dramatically nor [LOC Syria  ] 's determination to continue the process of establishing a full diplomatic presence in [LOC Beirut  ] . 
On future [MISC Israel-Syria  ] peace negotiations , [PER Asad  ] was more vague . 
He offered no specifics on re-opening talks , but expressed [LOC Syria  ] 's desire for the process to continue with [LOC U.S.  ] involvement . 
Finally , in response to the [ORG CODEL  ] 's repeated concerns about [MISC Syrian  ] support for [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] , [PER Asad  ] remarked that these were democratically elected organizations in the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] ; dealing with them was simply part of the reality of politics in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
END SUMMARY. -------------------------------- The Opening [ORG Gambit: Human Rights  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Following a warm exchange of pleasantries in which Senator [PER Cardin  ] thanked [PER Asad  ] for sending [MISC Imad Mustafa  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] as [LOC Syria  ] 's Ambassador ( " He 's in our offices so much we 've thought of charging him rent ! 
" ) , Senator [PER Cardin  ] noted the [ORG CODEL  ] had come to [LOC Syria  ] for two major reasons: ( 1 ) As a fact-finding mission with an eye toward reinvigorating the [MISC Syria-Israel  ] peace process ; and ( 2 ) to learn more about the [MISC Iraqi  ] refugee situation . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] added " there are new opportunities . . . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has a new president who wants to work " with countries in the region . 
Regarding [LOC Syria  ] , he said , " there are areas of major concern , " one of them being [LOC Syria  ] 's human rights record . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] told [PER Asad  ] he could give specific examples of citizens jailed for their political views . 
[PER Asad  ] responded , " we are a country in process of reform . 
We aren't perfect . 
You are talking about 12 people out of 20 million . 
It 's a process . 
We are moving forward , not fast , but methodically . 
" ( [PER NOTE: Asad  ] 's mention of " 12 people " refers to the 12 members of the [ORG Damascus Declaration National Council  ] convicted in October 2008 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Asad  ] admitted [LOC Syria  ] had very strong security laws , but argued they were necessary to protect the nation . 
The members of the [ORG Damascus Declaration  ] had been convicted for their " contact with an individual in [LOC Lebanon  ] who had invited the [LOC U.S.  ] to attack [LOC Syria  ] . 
This is against our law . 
" Senator [PER Cardin  ] replied he realized this was a domestic issue ; he was not asking [LOC Syria  ] to be exactly like the [LOC U.S.  ] , but [LOC Syria  ] should nonetheless adhere to widely accepted international standards . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] argued that " when the [LOC U.S.  ] is challenged , you see it on the front page of the newspaper " and that such challenges were an important part of a national dialogue . 
" You do not see this ( freedom of expression ) anywhere in the region , " [PER Asad  ] chuckled in reply , " let 's talk about [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Widening the human rights conversation beyond the scope of [MISC Syrian  ] prisoners of conscience , [PER Asad  ] admonished the [ORG CODEL  ] for focusing on 12 individuals without taking into account half a million [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees in [LOC Syria  ] alone , and the continued suffering of people in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
" Human rights , " [PER Asad  ] philosophized , " is related to the whole upgrading of society . 
This will produce new laws . 
" In a final bid to put the subject of human rights to rest , [PER Asad  ] stated he was a popular president and that if he were working against his people , he would not enjoy such popularity . 
" Don't worry about human rights , we're moving forward , " he said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Turning to conflict and reform in the region , [PER Asad  ] observed many societies in the region ( including [LOC Syria  ] ) were experiencing a shift in political alignment to the right . 
As a result , the process of political reform had become increasingly difficult . 
[PER Asad  ] warned that countries , like [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] , which had strived for rapid reform in the past , had only set the stage for more conflict . 
In the case of [LOC Algeria  ] during the 1980s , [MISC Islamists  ] had tried to use a sudden political opening to gain power and this had sparked a conflict lasting twenty years . 
Similarly , [PER Asad  ] continued , [LOC Lebanon  ] 's reform process and the May 29 elections had been the cause of the subsequent sectarian violence . 
[PER Asad  ] contended the real issues were " peace and fighting terrorism . 
" ------------------------------- The [ORG Middle Game: A Nuclear Iran  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Whitehouse  ] raised [LOC Iran  ] , agreeing with Senator [PER Cardin  ] 's assessment of the new political terrain and asserting: " We have a moment of opportunity for new policies . 
" [PER Whitehouse  ] cautioned [PER Asad  ] that it was also " a time for choices . 
" The manner in which the [LOC U.S.  ] would proceed depended on " honest , sustained cooperation in the region , " he said . 
The senator emphasized the time-frame for this cooperation was quite short . 
The one thing that could bring it to a premature close would be [LOC Iran  ] 's development of nuclear weapons . 
" If [LOC Iran  ] insists , " Senator Whitehorse stated , " it will create an atmosphere challenging for negotiations . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Asad  ] swiftly responded , " we're not convinced [LOC Iran  ] is developing nuclear weapons . 
" He argued [LOC Iran  ] could not use a nuclear weapon as a deterrent because nobody believed [LOC Iran  ] would actually use it against [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] noted an [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear strike against [LOC Israel  ] would result in massive [MISC Palestinian  ] casualties , which [LOC Iran  ] would never risk. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Second , he continued , the [ORG IAEA  ] had reported no evidence of a nuclear weapons program in [LOC Iran  ] existed . 
Arguing [LOC Syria  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] were actually closer than they realized on these issues , [PER Asad  ] said [LOC Syria  ] adamantly opposed any " weapons of mass destruction " in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
But as signatories to the [ORG Treaty  ] on the [ORG Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) both [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Syria  ] had the right to pursue nuclear power for civilian purposes . 
[PER Asad  ] asserted demands for [LOC Iran  ] to " stop " its nuclear program were unproductive and a violation of its rights under the [ORG NPT  ] . 
Instead , he said , " the argument should be about how to monitor their program , " as outlined in the [ORG NPT  ] . 
" Without this monitoring , " [PER Asad  ] warned , " there will be confrontation , and it will be difficult for the whole region . 
" [PER Asad  ] leaned slightly forward and said: " Let 's work together on this point . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Senator Whitehorse replied , " I hope monitoring is enough , " noting the difficulty of such a project in a closed society such as [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] responded an international system for monitoring was in place and should be followed . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] interjected , " we believe [LOC Iran  ] 's goals are the opposite of what you describe . 
We think they want to change the equation " ( of power in the region ) . 
[PER Asad  ] asked the [ORG CODEL  ] to put aside this point of view and focus on monitoring . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] said , " we agree on monitoring , but we think [LOC Iran  ] should give up its nuclear ambitions . 
" [PER Asad  ] reiterated monitoring was the best institutional way to control [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
Senator [PER Wicker  ] challenged [PER Asad  ] 's assertion [LOC Iran  ] was not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and that monitoring alone would work . 
[PER Asad  ] replied his impression was that [LOC Iran  ] 's program was for peacful purposes with the caveat " we have no evidence as we are not in [LOC Iran  ] . 
" Senator [PER Wicker  ] advised [PER Asad  ] the international community assessed otherwise ; the question now was what the appropriate response to [LOC Iran  ] should be . 
" Everyone wants to avoid a military reaction , " he noted , " but it was the clear view of the former administration and is the clear view of the current administration that something will have to be done . 
" [PER Asad  ] observed " you have my impression . 
Everything you mention is guessing . 
Monitoring will make everything clear . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Representative [PER Moore  ] argued that while monitoring was a mechanism appropriate to " nation states , " it would not be effective in controlling [LOC Iran  ] 's military proxies , [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
She stated both [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] provided financial support to the two groups and there was no way to rule out categorically the possibility that [LOC Iran  ] might provide nuclear material to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
" The ability of the international community to monitor [LOC Iran  ] on [ORG NPT  ] is understood . 
It 's the role of the proxies that is the problem , " she said . 
[PER Asad  ] replied , " if you don't trust the mechanisms of the [ORG NPT  ] , let 's cancel it . 
" He maintained these proxies " would go away " if there was a comprehensive [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] peace agreement . 
He asked who had created these proxies ? 
" We didn't and [LOC Iran  ] didn't . 
How were they created ? 
By conflict because [LOC Lebanon  ] was occupied by [LOC Israel  ] . 
It 's normal to have resistance . 
This is the reality we have to deal with . 
" -------------------------- Testing The [LOC Flank: Lebanon  ] -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Wicker  ] asked [PER Asad  ] to give his prognosis for the upcoming [MISC Lebanese  ] elections , the prospect of [LOC Syria  ] sending an ambassador , and whether [ORG Hizballah  ] would disarm . 
In a tone of resigned pessimism , [PER Asad  ] replied that the [MISC Lebanese  ] elections would not make much of a difference . 
In [LOC Lebanon  ] , he explained , any party can get a " veto third . 
" [PER Asad  ] maintained the key issue was whether the [MISC Lebanese  ] would vote along political lines or sectarian lines . 
If the latter occurred , then [PER Shi'as  ] would elect [PER Shi'as  ] , [MISC Christians  ] would elect [MISC Christians  ] , and so on , which would result in conflict . 
" If you don't have consensus , you will have civil war . 
This is how it has always been in [LOC Lebanon  ] , " he said . 
Conflict in [LOC Lebanon  ] would preclude normal relations between the two countries. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On the subject of a [MISC Syrian  ] ambassador to [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Asad  ] characterized the delayed appointment as being part of a deliberate political process . 
[PER Asad  ] pointed out [LOC Syria  ] had opened an embassy and staffed it , actions they would not have taken if they did not fully intend to send an ambassador . 
[PER Asad  ] argued an appointment like this was a political step requiring the proper timing . 
He added " we know who and when , but we're not going to announce it today . 
" Senator [PER Wicker  ] deftly rejoined " we could make news ! 
" eliciting laughter from everyone , including [ORG Asad.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Regarding the disarmament of [ORG Hizballah  ] , [PER Asad  ] argued " [ORG Hizballah  ] has no specific interest in [LOC Israel  ] besides securing [LOC Lebanon  ] 's borders and preventing threats to [LOC Lebanon  ] 's integrity , like [LOC Israel  ] 's daily violations of [MISC Lebanese  ] airspace . 
" [PER Asad  ] noted [ORG Hizballah  ] was the most powerful political party in [LOC Lebanon  ] , was democratically elected , and if peace in the region were to be achieved , " the small things " with [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] would disappear . 
" Let 's talk about the peace . 
This is the big picture that will solve everything . 
" [PER Asad  ] likened the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's approach to [ORG Hizballah  ] to trying to patch an old suit when a new suit was needed . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] countered that peace would very likely go forward if [LOC Syria  ] would stop the arms flow to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
The senator noted many countries thought [LOC Syria  ] was concerned about possible repercussions with [LOC Iran  ] if it were to take the initiative on stopping arms to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] responded [LOC Syria  ] had been in negotiations with [LOC Israel  ] with no concern for [LOC Iran  ] 's opinion . 
He told the story of how [MISC Iranian  ] President [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] called him just before the [LOC Annapolis  ] conference and implored him not to send anyone , that it was a " bad meeting , " but that they sent a representative anyway . 
" I told him I know it ( [LOC Annapolis  ] ) is just a photo op . 
But I am sending someone anyway . 
We do what we think is good for our interests ; it 's not dependent on [LOC Iran  ] , " he contended. ------------------------------ A New [ORG Tempo: The Peace Process  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) Senator [PER Tom Udall  ] asked what message [PER Asad  ] wanted the [ORG CODEL  ] to deliver to the new administration . 
[PER Asad  ] replied he saw two key common interests between [LOC Syria  ] and the [MISC U.S.:  ] peace in the region and combating terrorism . 
[PER Asad  ] argued [LOC Syria  ] had been at the forefront of fighting terrorism ever since it put down the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] in 1982 . 
He claimed that in the mid-1980s , [LOC Syria  ] had sent a delegation to [LOC Europe  ] to articulate the need for a coalition to fight terrorism , but nobody had listened . 
[PER Asad  ] said [LOC Syria  ] wanted to know when the [LOC U.S.  ] would adopt a new approach toward terrorism , adding that " it 's not a question of how much you can destroy , but how much dialogue you can make . 
" The [MISC Europeans  ] , [PER Asad  ] continued , knew more about the region than the [LOC U.S.  ] and he urged the [ORG CODEL  ] to turn to them for guidance . 
[PER Asad  ] stated the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] shared a common interest on " 70 percent " of the issues at hand , the difference was all in " point of view , principles , culture , and approach . 
" Keen to press the topic of engagement , [PER Asad  ] attempted to refute the idea that a new dialogue would only make [LOC Syria  ] stronger: " No , you make yourselves stronger because you have interests in the region . 
" <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Agreeing that dialogue was crucial and an essential component of the [ORG Helsinki Commission  ] , Senator [PER Cardin  ] advised [PER Asad  ] that if he were serious about engagement , he would expel [ORG Hamas  ] leaders from [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] replied , " What if [ORG Hamas  ] supported peace ? 
" Senator [PER Cardin  ] explained [ORG Hamas  ] was a symbol--it launched rockets into non-military areas and this was the definition of terrorism . 
[PER Asad  ] replied [ORG Hamas  ] was an uninvited guest ; it was really the very [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] organization [LOC Syria  ] had combatted through the 1980s . 
" If you want me to be effective and active , I have to have a relationship with all parties . 
[ORG Hamas  ] is [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , but we have to deal with the reality of their presence . 
" Senator [PER Cardin  ] pointed out not expelling [ORG Hamas  ] sent a signal to the international community that [LOC Iran  ] , given its support for [ORG Hamas  ] , might be making the decisions in [LOC Damascus.  ] -------------------------------- En [ORG Passant:  ] The [ORG DCS  ] , [ORG ACC  ] and [ORG ALC  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) When confronted with Senator [PER Cardin  ] 's observation that the [ORG SARG  ] 's closure of the [ORG Damascus Community School  ] ( [ORG DCS  ] ) , the [ORG American Culture Center  ] ( [ORG ACC  ] ) , and the [ORG American Language Center  ] ( [ORG ALC  ] ) had hurt [MISC Syrians  ] more than [MISC Americans  ] , [PER Asad  ] assured the [ORG CODEL  ] that this was merely a public relations gesture on his part . 
" We were attacked by the [LOC U.S.  ] army , " [PER Asad  ] replied , " Seven civilians were killed . 
I had two choices: fight the [LOC U.S.  ] army or do something symbolic . 
It 's something temporary . 
You'll open it next year . 
" Senator [PER Cardin  ] told [PER Asad  ] he understood " symbolic gestures , but not when they hurt your own people . 
" ------------------------------ The End [ORG Game: Foreign Fighters  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) " What interest does [LOC Syria  ] have in letting foreign fighters go to [LOC Iraq  ] ? 
" [PER Asad  ] pointedly asked in response to Representative [PER McIntyre  ] 's question about why [LOC Syria  ] had not done more to monitor and staunch the flow of transiting fighters across the [MISC Syria-Iraq  ] border . 
[PER Asad  ] continued: " Can you stop the immigration of [MISC Mexicans  ] into the [LOC U.S.  ] ? 
[MISC No. All  ] borders are porous . 
There is no army on the border ; you don't have soldiers on the border . 
Do your homework . 
My job is to protect my people , not your soldiers . 
We have terrorists . 
Two months ago there was a car bomb in [LOC Syria  ] and that car came from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" ( NOTE: We assume [PER Asad  ] is referring to the September 27 , 2008 car bomb attack against a [ORG SARG  ] military facility , though [MISC Syrian  ] Military Intelligence has reportedly stopped several cars rigged with explosives since then . 
END NOTE ) . 
[PER Asad  ] noted that the lack of cooperation with military forces in [LOC Iraq  ] contributed to the problem . 
With [LOC Turkey  ] , he said , the border was more complicated and the terrain worse , but because [LOC Syria  ] enjoyed better cooperation it was less porous. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Asad  ] recounted how when ( then [ORG NEA A/S  ] ) [PER William Burns  ] and representatives from the [ORG Army  ] and [ORG CIA  ] came to [LOC Damascus  ] , " we said we were ready to cooperate . 
We took the delegation to the border , then after they left we waited for a proposal , but nothing came of it . 
They didn't want to cooperate . 
" [PER Asad  ] added [LOC Syria  ] lacked the financial and technical means , such as night-vision goggles , to tighten its control of the area . 
[PER Asad  ] then said , somewhat contradicting himself , that 80 percent of controlling the border was about controlling the country . 
Representative [PER McIntyre  ] asked , " but are you willing to monitor ( the border ) ? 
" The president demurred , " this is a different problem , " at which point Ambassador [PER Mustafa  ] interjected with " I will brief you on the details . 
" <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The three main objectives [PER Asad  ] felt the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] should work on were ( 1 ) Eliminating WMD in the region ; ( 2 ) pursuing a shared interest in a stable [LOC Iraq  ] ; and ( 3 ) working for peace and combating terrorism . 
[PER Asad  ] re-affirmed that [LOC Syria  ] was not an enemy of the [LOC U.S.  ] , " I have saved [MISC American  ] lives . 
" In 2002 , [PER Asad  ] explained , he passed information to the King of [LOC Bahrain  ] about an imminent attack on [MISC American  ] citizens . 
Ambassador [PER Mustafa  ] added that then Secretary of State [PER Colin Powell  ] had sent the [MISC Syrian  ] government a letter expressing his gratitude for its assistance . 
If the [LOC U.S.  ] wished for similar coordination in the future , [LOC Syria  ] could not begin security cooperation without concomitant political cooperation , [PER Asad  ] stated. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Beginning with the visit of President [PER Carter  ] last December , President [PER Asad  ] 's exposure to [LOC U.S.  ] politicians has steadily increased . 
This encounter was a good example of how [PER Asad  ] has been able to hone his responses to [LOC U.S.  ] accusations that [LOC Syria  ] is a bad actor in the region . 
At no point in the conversation did [PER Asad  ] ask about the appointment of a [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador to [LOC Syria  ] or economic sanctions , which suggests to us that he is doing everything possible to avoid the appearance of being the supplicant , despite the [MISC Syrian  ] press 's heavy focus on [LOC Syria  ] 's desire to see an end to sanctions and the appointment of a [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) COMMENT CONTINUED: We have heard anecdotally that [PER Asad  ] was not pleased with the tenor or substance of his meeting with the [ORG CODEL  ] . 
The [ORG SARG  ] is reportedly interpreting the group 's position on [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and human rights to be a continuation of , rather than a departure from , the previous Administration 's policy toward [LOC Syria  ] . 
We note that the [ORG CODEL  ] 's discussion with [PER Asad  ] was frank but cordial . 
Senator [PER Cardin  ] and the [ORG CODEL  ] members aired [LOC U.S.  ] policy concerns publicly from their perspective as elected legislators in press remarks , framed in the context of their desire to explore whether cooperation with [LOC Syria  ] is viable . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] press and many of our interlocutors have come to view re-engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] as a fait accompli , as something long-overdue and very much owed to [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Asad  ] 's displeasure with the [ORG CODEL  ] may be his first recognition that [LOC U.S.-Syria  ] bilateral relations will require more on his end than originally anticipated .
