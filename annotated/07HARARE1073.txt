Parallel exchange rate: ZW$2,000,000:US$1 Official exchange rate: ZW$30,000:US$1 Sugar on the parallel market jumped to [MISC Z$1.2  ] million/2kg vs. controlled price of [MISC Z$247,000/2kg Cooking  ] oil on the parallel market Z$5 million/750 ml vs. new controlled price of [MISC Z$440,000/750  ] ml Fuel - Z$2.4 million/liter vs. Z$60,000/liter at controlled price ( and scarcer than ever ) ----------------------------- On the [ORG Political/Social Front  ] ----------------------------- Proposed Changes to [ORG Electoral Laws Positive  ] , But - The [ORG Electoral Laws Amendment Bill  ] published on Nov. 16 and pending debate in Parliament proposes to amend the [ORG Zimbabwe Electoral Commission Act  ] and the [ORG Electoral Act  ] to provide an improved electoral framework . 
Major changes to the electoral law would include: continual registration of voters ( up until the day before candidates are formally nominated ) , less restrictive procedural requirements for voter registration , electronic copies of voter rolls to political parties , exclusion of security forces from running polling stations , equal access to state media for editorial time and advertising , and foreign election observers ( although the justice minister may ban some groups ) . 
It is important to note that an improved electoral law will be significant only if the political atmosphere , which continues to feature violence and intimidation , is improved ; and if there is time for the opposition to take advantage of the electoral law and other changes before elections take place . 
Police Bash 22 Activists During [MISC Mbeki Visit  ] - Some 400 [ORG National Constitutional Assembly  ] ( [ORG NCA  ] ) activists turned out in [LOC Harare  ] on Nov. 22 to protest against continuing state-sanctioned political violence against opposition and civil society activists . 
The group intended to intercept the motorcade of [MISC South African  ] President [PER Mbeki  ] who was in town to press for a quick conclusion to the drawn-out mediation talks between the ruling party and the opposition . 
Ironically , one of the key issues still under discussion is the cessation of the political violence . 
[PER Maddock Chivasa  ] , [ORG NCA  ] spokesperson , told us that police dispersed the crowd using batons and injuring nine activists just before [PER Mbeki  ] was to pass by the demonstration . 
Soon after , suspected state agents in plain clothes forced 22 [ORG NCA  ] members into minibuses and took them to [LOC ZANU-PF  ] provincial offices in [LOC Harare  ] where they were beaten . 
The activists were turned over to police later that evening and then eventually released some hours later after paying a fine . 
[PER Chivasa  ] reported that all 22 required medical attention for their injuries ; 10 required hospitalization . 
[LOC Zimbabwe  ] Low On [ORG U.N. Human Development Index  ] - The 2007 [ORG U.N. Human Development Index  ] , released this week , put [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , [ORG DRC  ] and [LOC Zambia  ] at a lower level of development than they enjoyed in 1975 . 
Most countries have seen their human development index rise over the last 30 years , but in 16 countries it was lower than in 1990 . 
The index ranks 175 [ORG U.N.  ] member countries plus two territories by life expectancy , education levels and real per capita income . 
[LOC Senegal  ] 's [PER Wade  ] Visits [LOC Harare  ] - [MISC Senegalese  ] President [PER Abdoulaye Wade  ] visited [LOC Harare  ] on Wednesday and proposed a committee of at least five heads of state , including [LOC South Africa  ] 's [PER Thabo Mbeki  ] , to mediate an improvement of relations between [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] . 
[PER Wade  ] was reported as stating that while he did not condone [LOC HARARE  ] 00001073 002 OF 004 President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] 's policies , they should be understood in their historical context . 
While praising [ORG SADC  ] 's mediation efforts under [PER Mbeki  ] , [PER Wade  ] said they were inadequate and that [LOC Africa  ] should do more to help [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
For his part , [PER Mbeki  ] said he was unaware of the visit . 
Prelude to the [LOC EU-AU Summit  ] - [PER Tomaz Salomao  ] , [ORG SADC  ] executive secretary , said [ORG SADC  ] would pull its 14 members out of the [MISC EU-AU  ] SIPDIS summit , scheduled for December 8-9 in [LOC Lisbon  ] , unless [MISC European  ] leaders agreed not to single out [LOC Zimbabwe  ] for criticism . 
[LOC Zimbabwe  ] will most likely be discussed not as a separate agenda item but as part of a discussion on governance and human rights . 
[PER Mugabe  ] intends to attend ; [ORG UK Prime Minister  ] [PER Gordon Brown  ] has stated he will not . 
Zanu PF All Set For [MISC Million Men And Women  ] March - Zanu PF has launched a major media campaign , using radio and TV adverts , to encourage people to join the million men and women march set for Friday November 30 , 2007 , and show support for President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] 's candidacy for 2008 . 
Additional train and bus service is being provided for marchers coming from out of town , with over 150 buses having reportedly been pledged by private transport owners . 
The march is expected to start at 11 am in the center of [LOC Harare  ] and end in [LOC Highfield  ] , a low density suburb located approx 12 km out of town . 
Although the war veteran 's association under the leadership of [PER Jabulani Sibanda  ] was initially at the forefront of campaign marches in support of [PER Mugabe  ] , [LOC ZANU-PF  ] has appropriated the organization after various party bigwigs expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership of [PER Sibanda  ] , who had been expelled from the party . 
[ORG WOZA Marks  ] " 16 Days Of [MISC Activism Against Gender Violence  ] " With [MISC Peaceful Demonstration  ] - On Tuesday 27 November , approximately 1000 members of [ORG WOZA  ] marched through central [LOC Bulawayo  ] to support the global campaign 16 Days of [MISC Activism Against Violence Against Women  ] . 
" The group walked for four blocks singing and chanting slogans before it was stopped by police who told the group the official government campaign did not begin until the following day . 
The marchers dispersed without incident . 
[ORG WOZA  ] leader [PER Jenni Williams  ] told us that the march was the fourth demonstration in a row [ORG WOZA  ] had managed to stage without arrest . 
She also said high ranking police officers were becoming increasingly conciliatory toward [ORG WOZA  ] demonstrators . 
[ORG UK Lifts Ban  ] on Deportation of [MISC Zimbabweans  ] , Appeal Expected - The [ORG UK Embassy  ] confirmed media reports that the [ORG UK Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  ] ( [ORG AIT  ] ) upheld the Court of Appeal 's 2006 ruling that [MISC Zimbabweans  ] face no automatic risk of persecution following deportation . 
Since 2002 , [ORG UK Immigration  ] has fought a legal bar on deporting [MISC Zimbabweans  ] who are denied asylum , allowing thousands to remain indefinitely in the [LOC UK  ] without legal basis . 
The [ORG AIT  ] 's Nov. 23 decision to lift that ban , however , is unlikely to result in the immediate resumption of deportations , according to the [ORG UK Embassy Head of Visas  ] [PER David Ashford  ] ; [ORG UK Immigration  ] officials expect the decision to be appealed again , almost certainly requiring another moratorium on deportations . 
The [LOC UK  ] officials don't wish to repeat the embarrassing scenario of August 2006 when a similar ruling resulted in only one successful deportation before the moratorium was imposed . 
[LOC Canada  ] has a similar moratorium on [MISC Zimbabwean  ] deportations resulting from a court case also under appeal ; the USG deports [MISC Zimbabweans  ] for all manner of reasons , including failed asylum applications . 
[LOC Bulawayo  ] 's [ORG Water Crisis  ] Deepens - [ORG Bulawayo City Council  ] is decommissioning the [ORG Invankuni Dam  ] today , leaving [LOC Zimbabwe  ] 's second city with only one supply dam , according to the [ORG Chronicle  ] . 
The state-owned newspaper reported that water rationing in the city would spread to the central business district ; residential areas [LOC HARARE  ] 00001073 003 OF 004 would receive supplies once a week , and industrial areas twice a week . 
See [LOC Harare  ] 1051 for details of [LOC Bulawayo  ] 's water woes . 
[LOC Zimbabwe  ] 's [LOC Deteriorating Public Health System  ] - [LOC Harare  ] 1047 describes how [LOC Zimbabwe  ] 's public health care system , once among the best in [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] , is being eroded by mismanagement and under funding which have led to deteriorating infrastructure , low public expenditure , and high attrition of human resources . 
As a result , the system today is characterized by inadequate staffing , reduced accessibility by the general population , shortages of essential drugs and medical supplies , and outdated and poorly functioning equipment . 
Many health indicators have worsened , and while the [MISC HIV  ] prevalence rate has declined , [LOC Zimbabwe  ] is still home to one of the worst [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] epidemics in the world . 
The [ORG GOZ  ] is able , but unwilling , to address the current economic and health crises . 
While current donor support in the health sector is primarily focused on [MISC HIV  ] and reproductive health , many programs are designed with intentional spill-over effects to strengthen systems within the public health sector . 
Such programs are enabling the continuation of some basic health care services for an increasingly impoverished population . 
[ORG USAID Celebrates World AIDS Day With Award Ceremony  ] - [ORG USAID  ] hosted the 7th Annual [PER Auxillia Chimusora Awards  ] on November 29 . 
The award celebrates the bravery and leadership of the first woman to publicly announce her [MISC HIV  ] status in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] ( in 1987 ) , at a time when stigma was extremely high . 
The awards , prestigious in the [MISC HIV  ] community , are given to individuals and organizations in the fields of media , arts , corporate responsibility , orphans and vulnerable children , and advocacy to recognize leadership in the field of [MISC HIV  ] and [MISC AIDS  ] and impact achieved on reducing stigma . 
While [PER Auxillia Chimusora  ] is deceased , she was represented at the event by her daughter and other family members . 
Ambassador [ORG McGee  ] presided over the event , attended by approximately 400 guests , and was joined in formal remarks by Minister of Health [PER David Parirenyatwa  ] and [ORG USAID  ] Director [PER Karen Freeman.  ] --------------------------- [ORG Economic and Business News  ] --------------------------- [ORG Independent Press Reports New Currency Launch  ] on December 1.- The [ORG Independent  ] reported on November 29 that the [ORG RBZ  ] would rollout " [ORG Sunrise II  ] " - introduction of a new currency - on December 1 and that the changeover would require a minimum of three days instead of the 48 hours initially suggested . 
[PER Gono  ] announced last weekend cash deposit limits of [MISC Z$50  ] million for individuals , [MISC Z$200  ] million for businesses , and Z$1 billion for wholesalers and other large cash handlers , effective December 1 , unless one can account for the source of the cash . 
In spite of the pressure to bank one 's cash , its availability at banks did not improve this week . 
However , more cash began to circulate in the informal market , wiping out the premium at which it had been trading and sharply driving down its value vis a vis hard currencies . 
Z$58 Trillion Cash In Circulation ; Is There Hoarding ? - [ORG Reserve Bank  ] officials said that about [MISC Z$30  ] trillion of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] 's total Z$58 trillion cash in circulation was being held outside the banking system . 
Using that figure , [ORG RBZ  ] Governor [PER Gono  ] lashed out at " cash barons " for hoarding notes and fuelling the parallel market in currency and goods . 
But commentators were quick to note that [MISC Z$30  ] trillion divided among a population of roughly 10 million ( on the high side ) averaged out to only [MISC Z$3  ] million per person , hardly a hoard when it doesn't even suffice to buy a small bottle of cooking oil on the street in these hyperinflationary times . 
Finance Minister [PER Announces Z$7.8  ] Quadrillion Budget - With starry-eyed projections of 4 percent growth in 2008 and inflation falling to 1,978% by December 2008 , Finance Minister [PER Samuel Mumbengegwi  ] announced a [PER Z$7.8  ] quadrillion " People 's Budget " ( that 's [LOC HARARE  ] 00001073 004 OF 004 Z$7,800,000,000,000,000 , or [MISC US$3.9  ] billion at the parallel exchange rate and about [MISC US$260  ] billion at the official rate ) on November 29 .

More [MISC Staples Appear In Supermarkets  ] , But At [MISC Exorbitant Prices - Supermarkets  ] appear to be getting more frequent deliveries of bread , soft drinks , local beer , some chicken and sausages , but the goods disappear quickly amid consumer uncertainty about supplies . 
In addition , the lid appears to be off prices in apparent reaction to Industry Minister [PER Mpofu  ] 's announcement on November 22 that there would be no repeat of the disastrous price crackdown of the last months . 
[ORG Air Zambia Suspends Direct Flights To Harare  ] - On the heels of [ORG British Airway  ] 's withdrawal from [LOC Zimbabwe  ] last month , [ORG Air Zambia  ] announced suspension of its [ORG Lusaka Harare  ] direct flight effective December 1 . 
Contacts in the industry told us the airline was operating at a loss on the route , especially due to the high fuel prices and fluctuations in the [LOC Zimbabwe  ] dollar exchange rate . 
In the meantime , [ORG Air Zimbabwe  ] increased its fares across the board: roundtrip [ORG Harare Johannesburg  ] went from [MISC Z$84  ] million to [MISC Z$195  ] million , [ORG Harare Lusaka  ] shot to [MISC Z$130  ] million from [MISC Z$54  ] million , and a return flight to [LOC London  ] now sets a traveler back [MISC Z$1.3  ] billion - up from [MISC Z$600  ] million a week ago . 
[ORG Mobile Carriers Raise Tariffs  ] , Too - [ORG Econet  ] , [ORG Telecel  ] and Net One announced new rates this week for phone calls and text messages . 
[ORG Econet  ] 's tariffs went up by about 650% ; a local text message now costs [MISC Z$11,000  ] ( less than one [LOC US  ] cent on the parallel market ) . 
Analysts commented that the tariffs were still very low in real terms , well below regional comparisons , and , for [ORG Econet  ] , below its own target of about 15 [LOC US  ] cents/message . 
A text messages from GOZ-owned Net One increased to [MISC Z$8,000  ] . 
[ORG World Bank Concludes Mission  ] , Not [MISC Sanguine About GOZ Economic Stabilization Plan  ] - [ORG World Bank Mission  ] Chief [PER Naoko Kojo  ] and the Acting [MISC Country Manager  ] [PER Mungai Lenneiye  ] expressed skepticism to the diplomatic community on November 29 about the prospects for the successful implementation of the [ORG GOZ  ] 's plan , approved by the cabinet , to introduce a one-year Stabilization and [ORG Short-Term Recovery Program  ] in January . 
At the conclusion of the two-week mission , they lamented the lack of cooperation and consensus on the way forward among the [ORG GOZ  ] 's competing economic policy institutions: the [ORG RBZ  ] , the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Economic Development  ] . 
Details to follow septel . 
[ORG IMF Mission  ] Due in December - [ORG IMF  ] staff will visit [LOC Zimbabwe  ] December 13-19 . 
The primary purpose of the mission , according to [ORG World Bank Mission  ] Chief [PER Kojo  ] , is data compilation . 
Embassy [LOC Harare  ] is coordinating a business briefing for the mission by representatives of the [ORG American Business Association of Zimbabwe  ] on day-one of the visit and [ORG Amb  ] will host a debrief for fellow ambassadors on December 18 .
