On [ORG TFTP  ] , [LOC Spain  ] intends to continue its strong efforts in support of a long-term agreement . 
On the [MISC Summit  ] , [PER Bastarreche  ] presented both Spain’s and the [MISC EU’s  ] position , which differed .

END SUMMARY Terrorist Financing Tracking [MISC Program Interim Agreement  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Bastarreche’s first priority was to discuss the state of play with the [ORG TFTP  ] agreement . 
He was very concerned that the interim agreement on [ORG TFTP  ] was reached on the last possible day before the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] came into force , which meant that [LOC Spain  ] needed to be serious about damage control in the wake of suspicions that the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG EU Council  ] colluded to pre-empt Parliamentary action on the agreement . 
Regrettably , there had also been inefficiencies and inadequate follow-up to the interim [ORG TFTP  ] agreement , [PER Bastarreche  ] said . 
As an example , [PER Bastarreche  ] cited a call he received on January 17 from the [ORG Cabinet of European Parliament  ] President [PER Jerzy Buzek  ] , asking why the [ORG Spanish Presidency  ] had not responded to [MISC Buzek’s  ] letter - a letter no one had seen . 
[PER Bastarreche  ] said the [ORG Spanish Presidency  ] was determined to be diligent about follow-up and keeping the [ORG Parliament  ] informed . 
He cited the involvement of [MISC Spanish  ] Prime Minister [PER Zapatero  ] , who had since responded to [PER Buzek  ] with detailed legal arguments , as an indication of the high level of support for this issue . 
Regarding Information ( and incoming [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Fundamental Rights  ] ) Commissioner [PER Viviane Reding’s  ] recent public comments against [ORG TFTP  ] , [PER Bastarreche  ] called the remarks irresponsible , saying , “She is not entitled to speak against the position of the [ORG Commission.”  ] He characterized such anti-TFTP views as in keeping with her populist politics , i.e. , done for public favor. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) For next steps on [ORG TFTP  ] , [PER Bastarreche  ] said [LOC Spain  ] will continue to try to convince the [MISC Germans  ] to support [ORG TFTP  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] also planned to discuss on February 2 , at the Council level , a letter to [ORG Parliament  ] which provides encouragement and justification for members of the [ORG European Parliament  ] to wait for the interim mandate to expire in October 2010 and thus delay a definitive vote . 
By waiting , they can be assured that the duratnt while the U.Sessions that l the current [ORG Parliament  ] instead feels they need to show their strength . 
As a result , work on many issues is parayzed . 
[LOC U.S.  ] - [ORG EU  ] Summit <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Regarding Qhe proposed [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] , [PER Bastarreche  ] preseted both the [MISC Spanish  ] and the [ORG EU  ] views . 
[LOC Madrid  ] sees a visit by President [PER Obama  ] as extremely had become a strained bilateral relationship under President [PER Bush  ] . 
However , if [LOC Washington  ] chose not to pursue the [MISC Summit  ] during the [ORG Spanish Presidency  ] , but could commit itself now to a bilateral meeting in [LOC Madrid  ] later this year , then [LOC Spain  ] would be satisfied . 
The [ORG EU  ] thinks it would be a mistake for the [ORG United State  ] to opt out of the [MISC Summit  ] , given the substantive issues that will need to be addressed this semester , including [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC China  ] . 
[PER Bastarreche  ] stated PM [PER Zapatero  ] has more latitude on those key issues than Commission President [PER Barroso  ] or [ORG EU Council  ] President [PER Van Rompuy  ] . 
[PER Bastarreche  ] said climate change is another reason not to delay a summit until the second semester , as that would put the conversation near the [LOC Mexico  ] climate change conference . 
The proximity to the [LOC Mexico  ] conference could influence the agenda at a time when the issue needs to be “de-dramatized.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Kennard  ] assured [PER Bastarreche  ] the [MISC Summit  ] was under consideration in [LOC Washington  ] at present , but stressed the importance the [PER Obama  ] administration places on results . 
He said the [LOC White House  ] understands the important symbolism of the [MISC Summit  ] , but is very focused on the domestic agenda and overseas travel would have to lead to tangible outcomes . 
Ambassador [PER Kennard  ] assured [PER Bastarreche  ] that he would pass his concerns on to [LOC Washington  ] and would let him know directly when a decision was made . 
( NOTE: Ambassador [PER Kennard  ] placed a phone call to [PER Bastarreche  ] later that evening and eventually informed [PER Bastarreche  ] of the [LOC White House  ] decision on the morning of February 2 . 
END NOTE ) [PER KENNARD  ] .</pre></code>
