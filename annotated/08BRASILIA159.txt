( S ) Summary . 
Discussions between Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] and Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] , along with [MISC Brazilian  ] defense-related activities with [LOC France  ] and [LOC Russia  ] and in [LOC South America  ] suggest the key elements shaping [LOC Brazil  ] 's new defense posture . 
The military 's traditional role in maintaining internal stability and its potential roles as domestic crime-fighter and international peacekeeper will be important elements in shaping [LOC Brazil  ] 's new national defense strategy ( septel ) . 
However , it is becoming clear that regional stability , particularly with regard to [LOC Venezuela  ] , traditional sovereignty and border concerns , and [LOC Brazil  ] 's " rightful " place on the regional and world stage will remain central , and perhaps overriding motivations for the [ORG GOB  ] . 
As we prepare for [PER Jobim  ] , s March visit to [LOC Washington  ] , understanding of these basic [MISC Brazilian  ] motivations regarding security will be important in defining our approach to this new opportunity for security engagement . 
End summary . 
[PER Jobim  ] 's Focus Becoming Clearer ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Over the course of several discussions with the Ambassador ( refs A and B ) , the most recent on the eve of his departure on January 25 for [LOC France  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Jobim  ] revealed in increasing detail his goals for these visits and his activities in the hemisphere . 
The key elements that emerged are 1 ) pursuit of a nuclear submarine , using [MISC French  ] assistance on propulsion as well as other systems ; 2 ) a general desire to increase [LOC Brazil  ] 's domestic manufacturing capability for weapons via technology transfer ; 3 ) more specifically , an interest in becoming a service hub in [LOC South America  ] for [MISC Russian  ] equipment , driven by a desire to have greater leverage over [PER Hugo Chavez  ] 's [LOC Venezuela  ] ; 4 ) a focus on rebuilding [LOC Brazil  ] 's military capacity , including fighter aircraft ; and 5 ) a new , more structured organization of [MISC South American  ] defense ministers . 
What Does It Mean ? ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Jobim  ] 's visits to [LOC France  ] and [LOC Russia  ] ( refs C and D ) are the [ORG GOB  ] 's first significant move to actively pursue these priorities with countries that he believes will be willing to provide the necessary technology transfer as well as equipment . 
Moreover , [PER Jobim  ] was joined , exceptionally , by presidential foreign policy advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , [ORG MRE  ] Secretary General ( Vice Minister ) [PER Samuel Guimaraes'  ] chief of SIPDIS staff [MISC Marcos Pinta Gama  ] , and [ORG Long Term Planning  ] Minister [PER Roberto Mangabeira Unger  ] . 
The presence of the first two individuals , in particular , make clear that , for the first time in decades , [LOC Brazil  ] is beginning to consider security issues as an important element of foreign policy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Although [PER Jobim  ] himself has not commented extensively [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000159 002 OF 003 on the [ORG GOB  ] 's motivations for focusing on these items , they dovetail with [LOC Brazil  ] 's traditional focus on regional stability , the new regional threat posed by [LOC Venezuela  ] , and the need to defend its national sovereignty and borders . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's military and foreign policy elite make consistently clear that regional stability is their overriding concern within [LOC South America  ] . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] has now become the central focus of [LOC Brazil  ] 's regional stability concerns . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] observers regularly and publicly express general concerns about [PER Chavez  ] 's destabilizing influence on [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] , as well as his troubled relationship with [LOC Colombia  ] , even though [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) contacts refuse to admit to us even in private that they are worried about [MISC Venezuelan  ] interference in other countries . 
More importantly , the Ambassador has now been told by three respected members of the foreign policy elite--Senate Foreign Affairs and [ORG National Defense Committee  ] head [PER Heraclito Fortes  ] ( refs E and F ) , sitting senator and former president [PER Jose Sarney  ] ( refs G and H ) , and Former Finance Minister [PER Antonio Delfim Netto  ] ( ref I ) --that they believe [LOC Venezuela  ] under [PER Chavez  ] could well make a military effort to reclaim the half of [LOC Guyana  ] ( west of the [LOC Essequibo River  ] ) that it considers lost territory , principally as a way to deflect public attention from domestic woes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The general policy approach of [PER Lula  ] and his foreign policy team in seeking to maintain stability in the region does not differ enormously from that of his predecessors ; historically , [MISC Brazilian  ] governments have avoided taking sides in [LOC Latin America  ] and followed a policy of trying to maintain good relations with all of their neighbors . 
Uncertainty about [LOC Venezuela  ] has added a new element , however , leading to a more concerted effort to contain [PER Chavez  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is the leading advocate of [MISC Venezuelan  ] admission to [LOC Mercosul  ] , a move that , if approved by the [MISC Brazilian  ] and [MISC Paraguayan  ] congresses , will further complicate both the stated economic integration and political objectives of the organization . 
From [PER Lula  ] , s point of view , bringing [PER Chavez  ] into a political organization in which [LOC Brazil  ] has strong influence makes sense. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Similarly , [PER Lula  ] 's proposal to create a new organization of [MISC South American  ] regional defense ministers , which [PER Jobim  ] is actively pursuing , may achieve little in the way of defense coordination , but would serve a political objective of bringing [LOC Venezuela  ] and other regional troublemakers into a common organization that [LOC Brazil  ] could use to exercise a measure of control . 
Finally , while the proposal to serve as a hub for servicing [MISC Russian  ] equipment in the region will do little to develop [LOC Brazil  ] 's defense manufacturing capacity or to serve [LOC Brazil  ] 's own defense needs , it does make sense if [LOC Brazil  ] believes that performing such a function could help control the spread of [MISC Russian  ] weapons in the region . 
This objective might also explain the interest in allowing a [MISC Russian  ] military jeep manufacturer to set up shop in [LOC Porto Alegre  ] ( ref A ) , a capability [LOC Brazil  ] does not need but which might serve to entice [MISC Russian  ] interest in allowing [LOC Brazil  ] to serve as an equipment hub. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Border security and sovereignty concerns also continue to be a driving factor for [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire to re-build its military , develop a domestic manufacturing capacity for military equipment , and beef up its air defenses , in particular . 
[MISC Brazilians  ] continue to perceive their long border with ten neighboring countries as vulnerable , justifying maintenance of a strong defense posture . 
The most likely scenarios with direct military implications for [LOC Brazil  ] involve non-state actors such as the [ORG FARC  ] and international criminal organizations operating across borders . 
Nonetheless , although it seems highly unlikely that the [ORG GOB  ] 's first reaction would be to send in the troops , [MISC Brazilians  ] see a military incursion by [PER Chavez  ] into a neighboring country as [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000159 003 OF 003 plausible , in light of [PER Chavez  ] 's unpredictability , and see having a strong military as a deterrent . 
Moreover , they continue to hold suspicions regarding the intentions of the international community--including the [LOC United States  ] ( ref J ) --with regard to the [LOC Amazon  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] sees a strong military as an important element in backing up these assertions of sovereignty over the [ORG Amazon.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Beyond concerns about [PER Chavez  ] and regional and border security more generally , [PER Jobim  ] 's priorities suggest that [MISC Brazilian  ] interests are also motivated by [LOC Brazil  ] 's growing desire to take its " rightful " place among the world 's powers and to be seen as a worthy of a permanent [ORG UN Security Council  ] seat . 
It is this objective , which senior [ORG GOB  ] policy makers place above all other foreign policy goals , that is driving [LOC Brazil  ] 's interest in a nuclear submarine ( ref K ) . 
What does it mean for us ? ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [MISC Brazilian  ] leaders believe that now is their time to play a more important global role . 
This , combined with [LOC Brazil  ] 's continuing concerns regarding regional stability , the threat posed by [LOC Venezuela  ] , and border security , will form the backdrop to the discussions and to [MISC Brazilian  ] positions . 
While we may not agree with [MISC Brazilian  ] views of [LOC Brazil  ] , s security situation , they will nonetheless form a framework within which we must approach our discussions with Minister [PER Jobim  ] and other [ORG GOB  ] officials . 
While we should seek to focus on more realistic areas for bilateral defense cooperation , such as peacekeeping , we cannot afford to dismiss these core [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns , which will be important considerations as we seek to exploit the opportunities presented by [PER Jobim  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] in March and Pol-Mil talks in April .
