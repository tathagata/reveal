( [ORG SBU  ] ) A new and more restrictive draft of the [ORG Strategic Sectors Law  ] ( [ORG SSL  ] ) and relevant amendments to the [ORG Subsoil Law  ] are circulating and are expected to be considered by the [ORG Duma  ] soon . 
Most significantly , the new draft would limit to 10% the unsupervised acquisition by foreigners of entities that own licenses to develop " strategic subsoil assets . 
" State-owned enterprises would be exempt from these restrictions -- a key exemption since [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG Rosneft  ] , for example , continue to float shares internationally . 
The foreign investment community is concerned about the law and is preparing a coordinated approach to the [ORG GOR  ] , which we plan to help facilitate . 
End summary. ------------- NEW DRAFT [ORG SSL  ] ------------- 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Ministry of Industry and Energy Legal  ] Chief [PER Vladimir Taraskin  ] told us February 21st that a revised version of the [ORG SSL  ] and relevant amendments to the [ORG Subsoil Law  ] will be considered by the [ORG Duma  ] on March 19th . 
The new version is reportedly a [LOC Kremlin  ] produced compromise among the various ministries and factions competing over the law . 
The [ORG Petroleum Advisory Forum  ] ( [ORG PAF  ] ) , the association of western oil companies in [LOC Russia  ] , suggested to us that the bill was being fast-tracked and could be considered even earlier . 
However , [ORG PAF  ] added that [ORG Duma  ] Deputy Chairman [PER Yazev  ] has said that [ORG Subsoil Law  ] amendments will not pass in the near future because of continuing disagreements , including over the leadership of the proposed commission that would adjudicate foreign investments over the limits , which is still being contested between the [ORG Ministry of Economic Development and Trade  ] and the FSB . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The new draft is much more restrictive with regard to foreign ownership of " strategic subsoil assets " than the previous version , which had left untouched the current de facto limit of less than 50 percent foreign ownership , and also compares unfavorably with the 50 percent limit that exists in other strategic sectors ( such as space , aviation , etc . 
) . 
The new draft specifically limits unsupervised foreign acquisition of [MISC Russian  ] companies that hold licenses to explore and develop a " strategic " field to 10% . 
Entities partly owned by foreign governments would face an even stricter 5% limit on unsupervised ownership . 
Foreign entities seeking a greater share of relevant [MISC Russian  ] companies would need [ORG GOR  ] approval from the special commission . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The package to be discussed by the [ORG Duma  ] will also include amendments to the [ORG Subsoil Law  ] that would define " strategic fields " as oil fields with extractable reserves of more than 70 million tons , gas fields with more than 50 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) , and all off-shore fields . 
According to [ORG PAF  ] and other industry insiders , these limits are too low and define even relatively small fields as " strategic . 
" 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Companies of which the [ORG GOR  ] is a majority owner , in particular [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG Rosneft  ] , would be exempt from limitations on foreign ownership . 
This key provision resulted from the unexpected realization during internal [ORG GOR  ] debates that both [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG Rosneft  ] are already more than 10 percent owned by foreigners , since their shares are publicly traded on foreign exchanges. ----------------- INDUSTRY CONCERNS ----------------- 6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The foreign investment community has reacted with concern to the restrictive new draft . 
[ORG PAF  ] has already expressed its concerns directly to the [ORG GOR  ] . 
AmCham and its [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00000499 002 OF 002 [MISC European  ] counterpart , the [ORG Association of European Businesses  ] ( [ORG AEB  ] ) are reviewing the legislation and are considering next steps . 
Individual oil companies are doing their own analyses . 
[ORG PAF  ] is planning to host a roundtable discussion before the end of February to bring together all interested parties and to agree on a coordinated approach to the [ORG GOR  ] . 
7 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] 's [LOC Russia  ] chief [PER Richard Spies  ] shared some specific concerns with the Ambassador on February 21st . 
He said that [ORG BP  ] and [ORG TNK-BP  ] are concerned about the " grandfathering " provision in the new drafts . 
Although the draft law would not be applicable retroactively , it is not clear how the proposed law would affect new discoveries of strategic fields by existing ventures such as [ORG Rosneft-BP  ] ( a 51/49 venture on the [LOC Sakhalin  ] shelf ) or [ORG TNK-BP  ] or [ORG ConocoPhillips-Lukoil  ] . 
[PER Spies  ] said it was unclear if these joint ventures have to submit discoveries to the commission for approval in order to retain the field . 
8 . 
( C ) Given [ORG BP  ] 's [LOC Sakhalin  ] shelf venture with [ORG Rosneft  ] , [PER Spies  ] said his company was especially concerned about the off-shore limitation in the [ORG Subsoil  ] amendments , which would apply to all fields regardless of size . 
According to [PER Spies  ] , the new proposal is also less clear than previous versions in defining what " foreign control " means , i.e. how many foreigners on the board , or on the management committee , and whether foreigners had effective control over certain transactions regardless of their level of shareholding . 
In that regard , he noted that although [ORG Rosneft  ] was the majority shareholder , the [ORG Board of the Rosneft-BP  ] JV was composed of two representatives from each company . 
9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition , the 10% limitation may become a problem for non-state-owned oil and gas companies with foreign owners , according to an analysis [ORG TNK-BP  ] shared with us . 
[ORG TNK-BP  ] pointed out , for example , that brokerages may limit transactions of oil and gas stocks because of the 10% limit of the proposed law. ------- COMMENT ------- 10 . 
( C ) Despite [LOC Kremlin  ] support , it is not clear that the new laws will pass as quickly as planned . 
For one thing , the issue of who heads the commission has been a major stumbling block in the past and could prove so again . 
We believe there is still time for the foreign investment community , with our support , to voice concerns about the letter and spirit of the draft laws . 
As such , we plan to help [ORG PAF  ] organize the proposed roundtable and to encourage [MISC European  ] diplomatic involvement with the goal of agreeing on a unified approach to the [ORG GOR  ] .
