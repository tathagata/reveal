End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The discussion opened with aviation security issues . 
Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] conveyed her appreciation for [LOC Mexico  ] 's coordination of a regional conference on aviation security , and said that the [MISC Christmas  ] day events in [LOC Detroit  ] must be used to increase global standards . 
Once terrorists enter international air networks , they can move anywhere . 
Thus , we must build the capacity of all countries . 
The [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] ( [ORG ICAO  ] ) must help build capacity and raise standards , particularly in the weakest nations . 
President [PER Calderon  ] said that there is no alternative but to push for global cooperation and to increase [LOC Latin America  ] 's capacity . 
[LOC Iran  ] , he noted , is focusing on places like [LOC Venezuela  ] to establish operations . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] are also vulnerable . 
[PER Calderon  ] is also concerned that organized criminal groups may try to establish contacts with terrorists . 
He cited the nexus between the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) and organized crime in [LOC Colombia  ] as an example . 
Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] responded that , although we have not seen evidence to this effect , the potential is there , and this is all the more reason to share information on passengers and screening technology , as well as assist countries in their efforts to upgrade . 
[PER Calderon  ] also noted that the [ORG Mexican Army  ] ( [ORG SEDENA  ] ) and [ORG Air Force  ] are looking for three dimensional radars to better detect illicit air traffic. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Most of the rest of the discussion focused on the status of [LOC Mexico  ] 's counternarcotics fight , the way ahead in [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] , and how the [LOC United States  ] can support these efforts . 
In response to Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] 's question on the status of [LOC Mexico  ] 's battle against the cartels , [PER Calderon  ] noted that [LOC Mexico  ] in the past several months has seen positive results , including the December takedown of [PER Arturo Beltran Leyva  ] in [LOC Cuernavaca  ] ( ref a ) and the January arrest of [PER Diego Teodoro Garcia Simental  ] ( " [ORG El Teo  ] " ) in [LOC Tijuana  ] ( ref b ) . 
He said that [LOC Mexico  ] 's capacity for joint interagency operations is improving , but that there are still some problems with execution . 
[PER Calderon  ] highlighted the [ORG Mexican Navy  ] ( [ORG SEMAR  ] ) in particular as more aptly handling intelligence , but also said that the [ORG Public Security Secretariat  ] 's ( [ORG SSP  ] ) [ORG Federal Police  ] and [ORG SEDENA  ] are making progress . 
The President said that with [LOC U.S.  ] support , [MISC Mexican  ] security services are obtaining more effective access to counternarcotics targets. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Calderon  ] focused attention on the violence problem in [ORG Ciudad Juarez  ] . 
He said that [LOC Mexico  ] finds itself in a critical moment following the January 31 Salvarcar massacre of fifteen youths ( ref c ) . 
This is an opportunity , he continued , to mobilize civil society and for the [ORG GOM  ] to respond to public pressure that something be done in the city . 
[LOC Mexico  ] needs the right [ORG USG  ] counterparts , and [PER Calderon  ] asked whether the [LOC El Paso Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG EPIC  ] ) might fill that role . 
Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] responded that [ORG EPIC  ] can help to identify the right organized crime targets , but that [LOC Mexico  ] must move beyond military deployments and establish a police capacity in [ORG Ciudad Juarez  ] capable of policing every block and street . 
Social services and rule of law must also be extended [LOC MEXICO  ] 00000111 002 OF 003 throughout the city . 
Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] promised that the [ORG USG  ] will assist in any way we can . 
[ORG Ciudad Juarez  ] 's struggles with violence have become emblematic of the challenge confronting [LOC Mexico  ] and the menace of organized crime. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) President [PER Calderon  ] embarked on a discussion of the historical and societal factors that led to [ORG Ciudad Juarez  ] 's record levels of violence - up to 40 percent of [LOC Mexico  ] 's capital crime occurs in [LOC Juarez  ] or [LOC Chihuahua  ] . 
Among these key factors , [PER Calderon  ] said [ORG Juarez  ] 's position as a primary border crossing and rapid growth have contributed to the crime quandary . 
The societal fabric is weak . 
Tens of thousands of families moved to [PER Juarez  ] from all over [LOC Mexico  ] . 
Many of these new families were headed by single mothers with unsupervised children who turned to drug consumption and crime rather than school . 
[ORG Juarez  ] 's transition from a city on a critical trafficking route to also being a main consumption center has contributed to the growth in other crimes , including extortion and kidnapping . 
Additionally , [PER Calderon  ] observed that up until about three years ago , the [ORG Juarez cartel  ] controlled the city . 
More recently , the [LOC Sinaloa  ] cartel has moved in to try to claim the territory , which has pitted the two organizations against each other and caused them to recruit gangs to fight their battles . 
A comprehensive solution to the violence problem is complex , [PER Calderon  ] said , and has to address the city 's social ills , economic development , health services , and the corrupt police and court system . 
The President exhorted that [LOC Mexico  ] and the [LOC United States  ] work together. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] said that [ORG Ciudad Juarez  ] 's proximity to the [LOC United States  ] has drawn [LOC U.S.  ] attention to the violence problem and underscored the need to establish the rule of law and a real civilian police presence . 
As the [LOC United States  ] learned with [LOC New York  ] and [LOC Los Angeles  ] , a visible police presence assigned to specific areas is key , and people must be arrested for even minor offenses to get criminals off the streets . 
[PER Calderon  ] noted that [ORG Ciudad Juarez  ] - with assistance - is in the process of renewing the municipal police , and indicated that he favors the " [PER Bratton  ] approach " to the city ( [ORG Note: New York Transit Police  ] Chief [PER William Bratton  ] in the early 1990s applied a " zero tolerance " anti-crime strategy based on the " [MISC Broken Windows  ] " theory , which proposes that attention to and a reduction in low-level crime will also help prevent major crime ) . 
[PER Calderon  ] said the government must establish real enforcement of the law and a sense of authority in [LOC Juarez  ] . 
The government cannot , as some advocate , make concessions on more minor crimes , like illegal vehicles , to focus only on the major issues. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Calderon  ] said [ORG Operation Joint Chihuahua  ] only temporarily reduced crime after the new troop and [ORG Federal Police  ] deployment in March 2009 , but then crime exploded as kids fought each other on the street to control the drug trade . 
Now , the [ORG GOM  ] is making important policy decisions . 
It has augmented the [ORG Federal Police  ] in [LOC Juarez  ] and has given the [ORG SSP  ] primary responsibility for security in the city . 
The President underscored the continued need for an [ORG Army  ] presence , but noted that its role has shifted to mostly patrolling the outskirts . 
[LOC Mexico  ] needs to focus on building civilian institutions , as well as developing a more robust intelligence capacity . 
The [ORG GOM  ] is launching a program to reclaim public spaces like parks and soccer fields. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] and Ambassador [PER Pascual  ] reviewed the strong [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to provide support . 
Representatives from [ORG EPIC  ] have been going daily to the [ORG Federal Police  ] command and control center to assess mechanisms to transmit operational intelligence . 
A comprehensive planning session in [LOC El Paso  ] the week of February 22 will test every aspect of the [ORG GOM  ] plan . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will produce a complementary plan to provide support , including ties to [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies across the border . 
We will also look at secure communications , training and vetting for municipal police , building prosecutable cases , and planning support [LOC MEXICO  ] 00000111 003 OF 003 for a comprehensive [ORG GOM  ] socioeconomic revitalization program. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The discussion then focused on [LOC Mexico  ] 's southern border . 
President [PER Calderon  ] said the [ORG USG  ] can help as [LOC Mexico  ] intensifies its [ORG Southern Border Strategy  ] . 
Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] noted that the [MISC Guatemalan  ] border 's dense vegetation and terrain make patrolling difficult and asked whether there are areas to the north in which [LOC Mexico  ] can create a choke point for inspections . 
[PER Calderon  ] indicated that this , indeed , is how they are working , and Secretary of Government [PER Fernando Gomez Mont  ] said that checkpoints are being used at [LOC Mexico  ] 's more narrow isthmus . 
[ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOM  ] officials noted the entrance of [MISC Somalis  ] , [MISC Eritreans  ] , and even [MISC Iranians  ] through the southern border . 
[PER Calderon  ] underscored that the use of technology - including non-intrusive inspections of vehicles and radars - are necessary for border control . 
He does not want to continually employ the [ORG Army  ] and other forces in such pursuits in fear that they will be corrupted . 
[LOC Mexico  ] 's Secretary of Foreign Relations , [PER Patricia Espinosa  ] , said that [LOC Guatemala  ] is open to regional security cooperation , but the [MISC Guatemalan  ] government itself acknowledged that its team is fragile . 
[PER Calderon  ] suggested that vetting and checkpoints in [LOC Guatemala  ] would be a start , and indicated his concern about criminals smuggling people from [LOC Guatemala  ] to the northern border . 
These smugglers extort migrants with relatives in the [LOC United States  ] , and kill those who do not. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The meeting concluded with a final discussion of [LOC Juarez  ] and cooperation on the capture of high-value counternarcotics targets . 
[PER Calderon  ] asked for advice on police professionalization , and help with all aspects of [LOC Juarez  ] 's municipal police apparatus . 
Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] said that [LOC Juarez  ] can still be economically competitive . 
Its border location is a huge and unique asset . 
But security is a major factor affecting investment . 
The federal and municipal police must become effective first responders to public safety concerns . 
Both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] have a shared interest , and we committed to work effectively and rapidly to curb the violence in [LOC Juarez  ] and assert the state 's authority to sustain the rule of law .
