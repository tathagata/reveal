( C ) SUMMARY . 
[MISC German  ] officials have been uniformly positive about the new [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] strategy and largely supportive of our proposed deliverables for the [ORG NATO  ] and [MISC U.S.-EU  ] summits . 
The [MISC Germans  ] are committed to covering almost all of the outstanding requirements in the north of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including election support forces , OMLTs , [ORG ANA  ] infrastructure , and police trainer/mentors . 
[LOC Germany  ] 's contribution to the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] remains under internal discussion , but Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] is expected to make an announcement on this at the [ORG NATO  ] Summit . 
[LOC Germany  ] stands by a previous commitment to double its contribution of police trainers/mentors to [ORG EUPOL  ] , but it is becoming increasingly convinced that the [ORG Focused District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) police training program has greater potential for success . 
END SUMMARY . 
FOLLOW-UP <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As reported ref A , Post delivered points from refs B and C to officials in the [ORG MFA  ] , [ORG MOD  ] and [LOC Chancellery  ] on March 26 , outlining the results of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategic Review  ] and our desired deliverables for the [ORG NATO  ] and [MISC U.S.-EU  ] summits . 
Post followed up with officials on March 30-31 to get a further read-out of [MISC German  ] views . 
ELECTION SUPPORT FORCES AND OMLTs <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] ISAF Action Officer [PER Lukas Wasielewski  ] said [LOC Germany  ] agreed that at the [ORG NATO  ] Summit , Allies should demonstrate that they are committed to fully staffing the election support forces and deploying the necessary additional [ORG Operational Mentoring  ] and [ORG Liaison Team  ] ( OMLTs ) . 
He noted that [LOC Germany  ] would deploy some 620 additional soldiers in the north by June -- 220 for temporary election support and 400 for permanent augmentation of the [MISC German  ] presence ( to increase the [MISC RC-North  ] QRF to battalion size and beef up force protection at the [LOC PRTs  ] in [LOC Kunduz  ] and [LOC Feyzabad  ] ) . 
He claimed that with the [MISC German  ] contribution , the entire Combined Joint Statement of Requirements ( CJSOR ) for election support in the north would be fulfilled . 
He also noted that [LOC Germany  ] would help partners suffering budgetary problems because of the economic crisis make their election support contributions . 
For example , [LOC Germany  ] is providing airlift to move a company of [MISC Hungarian  ] infantry from [LOC Budapest  ] to the [MISC Hungarian  ] PRT in [LOC Baghlan Province.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] claimed that by the end of the year , [LOC Germany  ] and other northern partners would also fulfill all of the OMLT requirements for the two [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) brigades currently based in the north . 
He noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] is proposing to move forward the establishment of the 3rd Brigade in the north from 2013 to 2011 . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] volunteered that [LOC Germany  ] was not against this idea and would be ready , in cooperation with northern partners , to provide the OMLTs for that brigade as well . 
He noted that [LOC Germany  ] had just recently built a garrison in [LOC Feyzabad  ] for a company of [ORG ANA  ] troops of the 2nd Brigade , and was prepared to consider building the infrastructure needed for the 3rd Brigade as well. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] emphasized that [LOC Germany  ] was committed to helping Combined [ORG Security Transition Command  ] ( [ORG CSTC-A  ] ) carry out its initiative to establish a series of branch schools for the [ORG ANA  ] , including expanding the logistics school in [LOC Kabul  ] into a combat support school and building the proposed engineer school in [LOC Mazar-e Sharif  ] . 
He acknowledged that there was wrangling within the [MISC German  ] government about how to fund these projects , especially the engineer school , but gave assurances that we will do it . 
[ORG ANA TRUST FUND  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] said that [LOC Germany  ] welcomed the decision to expand the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] to cover sustainment costs and agreed it was important that it be adequately financed . 
However , confirming what we were told last week by the [ORG MOD  ] ( ref A ) , he said it was still not clear how much [LOC Germany  ] would contribute . 
He acknowledged that no single ministry had sufficient resources to cover the entire $100 million annual contribution requested by the [LOC U.S.  ] Therefore , the decision would have to be taken at the highest levels of the government , i.e. , the Chancellor herself . 
He thought the [LOC Chancellery  ] was well aware that the Chancellor had to be ready to say something about this at the [ORG NATO  ] Summit. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We followed up with [PER Ina Schuett  ] , an action officer in the [ORG Security Affairs Office  ] at the [LOC Chancellery  ] , who confirmed that the issue was still under discussion . 
While she could not name a figure at this point for how much [LOC Germany  ] would contribute , she too thought that the Chancellor would make an announcement on this at the [ORG Summit  ] . 
[ORG NTM-A  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] reiterated that [LOC Germany  ] supported the establishment of [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission-Afghanistan ( [ORG NTM-A  ] ) and hoped that the [MISC French  ] and the other [MISC European  ] [ORG Gendarmerie Force  ] ( [ORG EGF  ] ) members would , in the end , decide to deploy their paramilitaries through [ORG NTM-A  ] . 
He noted that [MISC French  ] FM [PER Kouchner  ] 's proposal at the informal [ORG EU  ] Gymnich meeting this past weekend to deploy the [ORG EGF  ] as an independent [MISC European  ] contribution , and to seek ad hoc logistical and force protection from [ORG NATO  ] , had fallen flat . 
He said even High [PER Rep Solana  ] , who presumably would tend to favor this approach , saw problems with the [MISC French  ] proposal . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] noted that the [MISC Italians  ] favor deploying the [ORG EGF  ] via [ORG NTM-A  ] , but he conceded it was unclear whether [LOC France  ] would accept having the [ORG EGF  ] subordinated to the dual-hatted [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG CSTC-A  ] commander. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] Deputy [MISC European  ] Correspondent [PER Thomas Schieb  ] confirmed that [PER Solana  ] voiced caution when [PER Kouchner  ] made his [ORG EGF  ] proposal at the [MISC Gymnich  ] meeting . 
He noted that the [MISC French  ] were also looking to share the costs of the [ORG EGF  ] deployment , presumably through [ORG EU  ] common funding . 
[PER Schieb  ] said [LOC Germany  ] 's position was that costs should lie where they fall , with each [ORG EGF  ] country paying its own way . 
POLICE MENTORS: [ORG FDD  ] VS . 
[ORG EUPOL  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] revealed that while [LOC Germany  ] would stand by its commitment to double its contribution of police mentors/trainers to [ORG EUPOL  ] to 120 as part of the doubling of the entire [ORG EUPOL  ] mission to 400 , it saw greater potential for success with the [ORG Focused District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) police training program . 
He noted that the initial reports from [LOC Germany  ] 's experience since beginning [ORG FDD  ] in January in districts around [LOC Mazar-e Sharif  ] were very positive . 
As a result , there were already internal discussions about possibly doubling the [MISC German  ] [ORG FDD  ] commitment from 10 districts to 20 . 
He explained that there are now some 50 [MISC German  ] civilian police trainer/mentors dedicated to the mission -- 20 who work at the training center in [LOC Mazar-e Sharif  ] , where district police forces get their initial training , and 32 more who are ( or will soon be ) deployed on police mentoring teams ( 4 per team ) that accompany and mentor district police forces when they return to their districts after basic training . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] pointed out that each police mentoring team ( PMT ) also includes 4 [MISC German  ] military policemen , and that a total of 45 military policemen are dedicated to the mission. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] noted that [ORG FDD  ] had a much better reputation among members of parliament than [ORG EUPOL  ] and was therefore easier to sell in seeking additional resources and support . 
He also noted that [ORG FDD  ] was proving more attractive than [ORG EUPOL  ] in recruiting [MISC German  ] policemen to go to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , since it offered the opportunity , unlike [ORG EUPOL  ] , to get off the compound and do something . 
The rate of satisfaction was significantly higher among [MISC German  ] policemen working on [ORG FDD  ] compared to those assigned to [ORG EUPOL  ] . 
[PER Wasielewski  ] conceded that there was already an internal debate brewing about how [LOC Germany  ] should allocate its scarce police resources in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the future . 
Still , he emphasized , there was no question that [LOC Germany  ] would stand by its existing commitment of providing 120 police mentors/trainers to [LOC EUPOL.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] noted that the current criteria for [MISC German  ] participation in [ORG FDD  ] required that the district in question be within an hour 's drive of a [MISC German  ] PRT or other installation . 
He acknowledged that this restriction would have to be re-examined once the close-in districts around the provincial capitals in the north were taken care of . 
One idea , he said , was setting up safe houses in the outer districts that are going through [ORG FDD  ] , where the [MISC PMTs  ] could overnight . 
These safe houses would be manned by a force of 50 or so soldiers , as the [ORG Provincial Advisory Team  ] ( [ORG PAT  ] ) in [LOC Takhar Province  ] is . 
CIVILIAN-MILITARY PLANNING CELLS <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] admitted that while [LOC Germany  ] saw little need for a civilian-military planning cell in [LOC RC-North  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] should not take [MISC German  ] rejection of the idea at last week 's [ORG NATO  ] PermReps coffee as the final word . 
That reaction was spurred by a sense that this had been suggested as a one-size-fits-all solution , without taking into consideration the different situation in the north . 
[LOC Germany  ] looked forward to receiving more information about the idea and was open to being convinced . 
ELECTION FINANCING <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Wasielewski  ] reported that [LOC Germany  ] would donate $12 million this year on a bilateral basis in support of the upcoming [MISC Afghan  ] elections , up from the $10 million it contributed last year . 
EU-PAKISTAN SUMMIT <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Deputy [MISC European  ] Correspondent [PER Schieb  ] agreed that the [ORG EU  ] has an important role to play in assisting [LOC Pakistan  ] and promoting its stability , and that a [ORG EU-Pakistan Summit  ] would be useful in forging a closer relationship . 
However , he did not think it would be realistic to hold such a summit before some time next year . 
He stressed it was important that such a summit have a clear agenda and be properly prepared .
