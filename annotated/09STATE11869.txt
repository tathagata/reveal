( U ) SUMMARY: A team of export control experts from the [ORG Departments of State and Commerce  ] met 22-24 September 2008 in [LOC Brasilia  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] with country team , [MISC Brazilian  ] government , and industry officials to discuss implementation of the [ORG Blue Lantern  ] end-use monitoring program and [LOC U.S.  ] export control licensing and policy issues in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The visit 's primary objective was to improve [MISC Brazilian  ] understanding of [LOC U.S.  ] export controls and to troubleshoot some long-standing difficulties in conducting [ORG Blue Lantern  ] checks in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
While the visit in [LOC Brasilia  ] included productive meetings with the country team and [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) officials , [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) , Customs , and [ORG Federal Police  ] officials refused to meet with the team despite repeated efforts by the [ORG Embassy  ] , an unusual occurrence suggesting the need for further engagement to foster [MISC Brazilian  ] appreciation for the importance of these issues . 
The visit in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] included site visits to ammunition manufacturer [PER Companhia Brasileira  ] de [MISC Cartuchos  ] and aircraft manufacturer [ORG Embraer  ] . 
The visits appear to have met the objectives of improving understanding of [ORG Blue Lantern  ] end-use monitoring and [ORG USG  ] defense trade laws and regulations as the [LOC U.S.  ] seeks to enhance bilateral defense trade with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Administered by [ORG PM/DDTC  ] 's [ORG Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance  ] ( [ORG PM/DTCC  ] ) , [ORG Blue Lantern  ] is a global program designed to verify the end-use , end-users , and disposition of commercially exported defense articles , technology , and services . 
This visit to [LOC Brazil  ] was part of [ORG PM/DTCC  ] 's ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of [ORG Blue Lantern  ] through outreach visits with posts , host governments , and industry. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The members of the team were [PER Judd Stitziel  ] , compliance specialist , [ORG Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance  ] ( [ORG PM/DTCC  ] ) ; [PER Yolanda Gantlin  ] , senior licensing officer , [ORG Office of Defense Trade Controls Licensing  ] ( [ORG PM/DTCL  ] ) ; and [PER Timothy Mooney  ] , export policy analyst , [ORG Bureau of Industry and Security , Department of Commerce  ] . 
[ORG PREPARATORY MEETING  ] AT [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] EMBASSY IN [LOC WASHINGTON  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In order to help lay the groundwork for a successful visit , [PER Caroline Croft  ] and [PER Benjamin Chiang  ] from the [ORG Department 's Brazil  ] desk accompanied the export control team to a meeting with [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) and [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) officials at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] on September 16 . 
The [MISC Brazilians  ] , led by [PER Achilles Zaluar  ] , Minister Counselor for Multilateral and [ORG International Security Affairs  ] at the [ORG MRE  ] , conditioned discussion of the [ORG Blue Lantern  ] program on receiving a status update on an unrelated [ORG PM/DTCC  ] compliance case . 
After receiving this update , the [MISC Brazilian  ] officials seemed more receptive to discussing the originally proposed topics . 
COUNTRY TEAM AND CONGEN SAO PAULO BLUE [MISC LANTERN BRIEFINGS  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) At [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] , [ORG DCM Lisa Kubiske  ] chaired a special meeting of the country team to discuss the [ORG Blue Lantern  ] program in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Attendees included [MISC John Erath  ] , political officer and [ORG Blue Lantern  ] point-of-contact in [LOC Brasilia  ] ; [PER Charles Allen  ] , [ORG U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ] ( [ORG ICE  ] ) attache ; Lt. Col. [PER Sam Prugh  ] , acting head of the [ORG Military Liaison Office  ] ( [ORG MLO  ] ) , [ORG MILGRP  ] ; a representative from the [ORG Office of Regional Affairs  ] ; [PER David Brassanini  ] , [ORG Legal Attache  ] ; [PER Mark Knight  ] , country attache , [ORG Drug Enforcement Administration  ] ; and [PER Chris Culver  ] , [ORG Regional Security Officer  ] . 
At Consulate General [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , Econ/Pol Chief [PER James Story  ] chaired a special meeting that included [PER Sara Ainsworth  ] , economic officer ; [PER Sean Kelly  ] , [ORG Foreign Commercial Service  ] ; [PER Kim Wong  ] , [ORG ICE  ] special agent ; and a representative from the [ORG Office of Regional Affairs.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In both meetings , [PER Stitziel  ] briefed the mission and STATE 00011869 002 OF 004 results of [ORG Blue Lantern  ] , both globally and in [LOC Brazil  ] , which is an important country for the program . 
Since 2002 , [ORG PM/DDTC  ] has received over 4,000 applications for commercial defense exports to [LOC Brazil  ] worth more than two billion dollars . 
From 2002 until the visit , [ORG PM/DTCC  ] attempted to conduct 67 [ORG Blue Lantern  ] checks in [LOC Brazil  ] , evenly divided between pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications . 
Responses to some of these requests were problematic due to lengthy response times and inability to complete checks , which adversely affected both specific license applications and bilateral defense trade in general. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the last year , the [ORG U.S. Mission to Brazil  ] has taken steps to improve this situation and has reduced its backlog of overdue cases from a half dozen to zero . 
With the designation of a full-time pol/mil officer as [ORG Blue Lantern  ] POC , [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] has centralized responsibility for coordinating [ORG Blue Lantern  ] checks throughout the country , drawing on the support of the consulates general and other country team members , including the [ORG Military Liaison Office  ] ( [ORG MLO  ] ) , [ORG ICE  ] , and the [ORG Foreign Commercial Service  ] ( [ORG FCS  ] ) . 
ConGen [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's econ/pol section and [ORG MLO Brasilia  ] have been instrumental in helping to clear the backlog over the last year . 
Front office guidance has underlined to all [ORG Mission  ] elements the importance of completing checks on schedule . 
The political section also has established a new tracking system to ensure that all [ORG Blue Lantern  ] requests are followed up . 
During the visit , [ORG DCM Kubiske  ] and Econ/Pol Chief Story pledged their support to ensure that [ORG Mission  ] continues to provide effective and timely responses to [ORG Blue Lantern  ] requests . 
EXPORT CONTROL DISCUSSIONS WITH DIVISION OF TRADE PROMOTION OPERATIONS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The [MISC DOS-DOC  ] export control team discussed export controls , including end-use monitoring , with several [MISC Brazilian  ] officials responsible for developing and implementing [LOC Brazil  ] 's export control laws and regulations . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] system of export controls does not include formal links between agencies , relying instead on a " gentlemen 's agreement . 
" A visit led by [ORG State Department  ] exporters therefore generated little interest in the law enforcement community . 
Participants included [MISC Norton  ] de [PER Andrade M. Rapesta  ] , Head , and [PER Thiago Couto Carneiro  ] , Secretary , of [ORG MRE  ] 's Division of [ORG Trade Promotion Operations  ] ; [ORG Marcos Pinta Gama  ] , [ORG Special Advisor  ] to the Deputy Minister , [ORG MRE  ] ; and [PER Osvaldo Monteiro  ] de [PER Carvalho Junior  ] , [ORG Advisor  ] , [ORG Nuclear Technology & Export Control  ] , Coordination-General for Sensitive Items , [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] . 
After receiving overview briefings on the [ORG Blue Lantern  ] program as well as State and [LOC Commerce  ] export control laws , regulations , and practices , the [MISC Brazilians  ] expressed gratitude for the information exchange and posed several detailed questions . 
[ORG Pinta Gama  ] stressed the need to " think ahead " in the area of export controls in order to ensure that [LOC Brazil  ] receives the best defense articles possible as [MISC U.S.-Brazilian  ] bilateral technology transfers becomes increasingly sophisticated . 
After asserting that export controls work in both directions , as [LOC Brazil  ] also can offer the [LOC U.S.  ] technology , [PER Rapesta  ] offered an overview of the policies and practices of [MISC Brazilian  ] export controls. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Promoting a better understanding of [ORG USG  ] export control regulations and policies was a central goal of the November 20-21 Defense Bilateral Working Group . 
In the past , [MISC Brazilians  ] have tended to interpret strict [ORG USG  ] regulations , as well as licensing delays generally caused by exporter negligence , as indicators of an anti-Brazilian bent to [LOC U.S.  ] export controls . 
Post will be building on the [ORG BWG  ] , including during the 2009 pol/mil dialogue , with further efforts to engage the GOB for better cooperation across the range of export control issues . 
SITE VISITS TO [LOC COMPANHIA BRASILEIRA DE  ] [MISC CARTUCHOS  ] AND [ORG EMBRAER  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) ConGen [LOC Sao Paulo  ] arranged a site visit to [LOC Companhia Brasileira  ] de Cartuchos ( [ORG CBC  ] ) in [LOC Ribeirao Pires  ] , a large ammunition manufacturer which has been both the named STATE 00011869 003 OF 004 end-user on scores of [ORG DDTC  ] licenses and the subject of several recent [ORG Blue Lantern  ] checks . 
Among the dozen company executives and employees who attended the meeting were [PER Arthur Liuz Silva  ] , [ORG Logistics & Supply Director  ] ; [PER Marco Vinicius Goncalves  ] , Purchasing Supervisor ; [PER Alexandre Vigano  ] and [PER Amanda Camara  ] , [ORG Import Analysts  ] ; [PER Claudia Bonan  ] , [ORG Marketing & Strategy Manager  ] ; and [PER Gilberto Salm  ] , Export Director. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After thanking the export control team for its briefings on the [ORG Blue Lantern  ] program and [LOC U.S.  ] export controls , [ORG CBC  ] officials offered an overview of their company 's operations . 
According to [ORG CBC  ] 's presentation , the privately owned company was founded in 1926 and is the world 's third largest ammunition manufacturer , with 1,550 employees , distribution centers in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , and two manufacturing facilities in [LOC Brazil  ] and one in [LOC Germany  ] . 
[ORG CBC  ] 's products are marketed in the [LOC U.S.  ] under the brand name MAGTECH . 
Approximately 70 percent of [ORG CBC  ] 's production ( 510 million rounds in 2008 ) is exported to customers in some 70 countries , including 31 military end-users . 
During discussion , the export control team emphasized that [LOC U.S.  ] laws prohibit the unauthorized re-transfer or re-export of [LOC United States  ] Munitions List ( [MISC USML  ] ) items , especially to prohibited destinations like [LOC Venezuela  ] , one of the countries that [ORG CBC  ] identified as a customer . 
In response , [ORG CBC  ] representatives expressed eagerness to fully comply with all [LOC U.S.  ] export control regulations and to cooperate with end-use monitoring checks , stressing the importance to the company of the [LOC U.S.  ] market . 
The export control team thanked the [ORG CBC  ] officials for their hospitality and explained that ConGen [LOC Sao Paulo  ] officials would be contacting them soon to ask for their assistance with a post-shipment [ORG Blue Lantern  ] check. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The export team also conducted a briefing and site visit at [LOC Empresa Brasileira de  ] [PER Aeronautica S.A  ] . 
( [ORG Embraer  ] ) in [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [LOC Campos  ] . 
Among the two dozen company executives and employees who attended the meeting were [PER Lizandra Karen de Lima  ] , [ORG Senior Legal Counsel  ] ; [PER Terena Penteado Rodrigues  ] , [ORG Associate General Counsel  ] ; [PER Helio Bambini Filho  ] , Vice President , [ORG Supply Chain  ] ; and [PER Falvia Sekles  ] , [ORG Institutional Relations Director  ] . 
Established as a state-owned company in 1969 , the well known aircraft manufacturer was privatized in 1996 and currently has more than 33,500 employees . 
[LOC U.S.  ] export controls are of particular concern to the company , as 60 percent of its customers are based in the [LOC U.S.  ] , its annual [LOC U.S.  ] exports total almost 1.8 billion dollars , and it has manufacturing facilities in [LOC China.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During and after the export control team 's briefings on the [ORG Blue Lantern  ] program and [LOC U.S.  ] export controls , [ORG Embraer  ] officials asked very informed and specific questions and demonstrated expert knowledge of [LOC U.S.  ] export control laws and regulations . 
In addition to providing a corporate overview , [ORG Embraer  ] officials outlined the company 's impressive export control compliance program , which appeared to incorporate many of best practices advocated by [ORG State and Commerce  ] officials during corporate educational seminars and conferences . 
Among the elements of [ORG Embraer  ] 's compliance program were the following: it was established by a resolution of [ORG Embraer  ] 's CEO and is a [ORG Global Corporate Policy  ] ; [MISC U.S.-based  ] training of employees directly responsible for implementation through forums like [ORG SIA  ] conferences ; export control training for 100 percent of procurement personnel ; internal training of over 1,000 employees ; internal procedures and practices , including [ORG Supplier  ] 's Certification of [ORG Item Classifications  ] and screening of countries and entities against published sanctions and embargo lists ; corporate policies governing storage and distribution , ensuring segregation of export-controlled items and technologies ; standard end-user forms based on [LOC U.S.  ] requirements ; strong contractual requirements for suppliers and clients ; and a commitment to making sure that [ORG Embraer  ] 's customers understand the restrictions that they are subject to . 
The [ORG Embraer  ] officials said they are currently in the process of developing an export control compliance manual and are committed to constantly improving , updating , and benchmarking their export control compliance policies and procedures .
