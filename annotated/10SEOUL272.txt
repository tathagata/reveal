VFM [PER Chun  ] on Sino-North [MISC Korean  ] Relations... ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) During a February 17 lunch hosted by Ambassador [PER Stephens  ] that covered other topics ( septel ) , [ORG ROK  ] Vice Foreign Minister and former [ORG ROK  ] [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] ( 6PT ) Head of [ORG Delegation Chun  ] [PER Yung-woo  ] predicted that [LOC China  ] would not be able to stop [LOC North Korea’s  ] collapse following the death of [PER Kim Jong-il  ] ( [ORG KJI  ] ) . 
The [ORG DPRK  ] , [PER Chun  ] said , had already collapsed economically ; following the death of [ORG KJI  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] would collapse politically in “two to three years.” [PER Chun  ] dismissed [ORG ROK  ] media reports that [MISC Chinese  ] companies had agreed to pump 10 billion USD into the [LOC North’s  ] economy ; there was “no substance” to the reports , he said . 
The VFM also ridiculed the [MISC Chinese  ] foreign ministry’s “briefing” to the [ORG ROK  ] embassy in [LOC Beijing  ] on [PER Wang Jiarui’s  ] visit to [LOC North Korea  ] ; the unidentified briefer had “basically read a [ORG Xinhua  ] press release , ” [PER Chun  ] groused , adding that the [LOC PRC  ] interlocutor had been unwilling to answer simple questions like whether [PER Wang  ] had flown to [LOC Hamhung  ] or taken a train there to meet [ORG KJI.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG VFM  ] commented that [LOC China  ] had far less influence on [LOC North Korea  ] “than most people believe.” [LOC Beijing  ] had “no will” to use its economic leverage to force a change in Pyongyang’s policies and the [ORG DPRK  ] leadership “knows it.” [PER Chun  ] acknowledged that the [MISC Chinese  ] genuinely wanted a denuclearized [LOC North Korea  ] , but the [LOC PRC  ] was also content with the status quo . 
Unless [LOC China  ] pushed [LOC North Korea  ] to the “brink of collapse , ” the [ORG DPRK  ] would likely continue to refuse to take meaningful steps on denuclearization . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to the [MISC Six Party Talks  ] , [PER Chun  ] said it was “a very bad thing” that [PER Wu Dawei  ] had retained his position as chief of the [MISC PRC’s  ] delegation . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said it appeared that the [LOC DPRK  ] “must have lobbied extremely hard” for the now-retired [PER Wu  ] to stay on as China’s 6PT chief . 
[ NAME REMOVED ] complained that [PER Wu  ] is the [MISC PRC’s  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] an arrogant , Marx-spouting former [ORG Red Guard  ] who “knows nothing about [LOC North Korea  ] , nothing about nonproliferation and is hard to communicate with because he doesn’t speak [PER English.” Wu  ] was also a hardline nationalist , loudly proclaiming -- to anyone willing to listen -- that the [MISC PRC’s  ] economic rise represented a “return to normalcy” with [LOC China  ] as a great world power. ...China’s “New Generation” of [MISC Korea-Hands...  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Sophisticated [MISC Chinese  ] officials [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stood in sharp contrast to [PER Wu  ] , according to VFM Chun.XXXXXXXXXXXX [PER Chun  ] claimed [ORG XXXXXXXXXX  ] believed [LOC Korea  ] should be unified under [ORG ROK  ] control.XXXXXXXXXXXX , [PER Chun  ] said , were ready to “face the new reality” that the [ORG DPRK  ] now had little value to [LOC China  ] as a buffer state -- a view that since [LOC North Korea’s  ] 2006 nuclear test had reportedly gained traction among senior [LOC PRC  ] leaders. ...PRC Actions In A [MISC DPRK Collapse Scenario...  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Chun  ] argued that , in the event of a [MISC North Korean  ] collapse , [LOC China  ] would clearly “not welcome” any [LOC U.S.  ] military presence north of the [ORG DMZ  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Chun  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [LOC PRC  ] would be comfortable with a reunified [LOC Korea  ] controlled by [LOC Seoul  ] and anchored to the [LOC United States  ] in a “benign alliance” -- as long as [LOC Korea  ] was not hostile towards [LOC China  ] . 
[MISC Tremendous  ] trade and labor-export opportunities for [MISC Chinese  ] companies , [PER Chun  ] said , would also help salve [LOC PRC  ] concerns about living with a reunified [LOC Korea  ] . 
Chundismissed the prospect of a possible [LOC PRC  ] military intervention in the event of a [ORG DPRK  ] collapse , noting that China’s strategic economic interests now lie with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , and [LOC South Korea  ] -- not [LOC North Korea  ] . 
Moreover , [PER Chun  ] argued , bare-knuckle [LOC PRC  ] military intervention in a [LOC DPRK  ] internal crisis could “strengthen the centrifugal forces in China’s minority areas.” ...and [LOC Japan  ] ------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Chun  ] acknowledged the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] point that a strong [MISC ROK-Japan  ] relationship would help [LOC Tokyo  ] accept a reunified [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] under Seoul’s control . 
[PER Chun  ] asserted that , even though “Japan’s preference” was to keep [LOC Korea  ] divided , [LOC Tokyo  ] lacked the leverage to stop reunification in the event the [LOC DPRK  ] collapses .
