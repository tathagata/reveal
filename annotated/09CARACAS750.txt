CAULFIELD  ] , REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
This message is the end of tour analysis of the political situation in [LOC Venezuela  ] by [ORG Embassy Deputy Political  ] Counselor [PER Dan Lawton.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Despite President [PER Chavez  ] 's professed allegiance to socialism , his political project lacks any consistent ideology . 
Instead , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] president exercises an increasingly authoritarian playbook that ensures his unquestioned , indefinite leadership and concentrates more and more power in his hands . 
The Government of the [LOC Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG GBRV  ] ) aggressively defends its democratic legitimacy at the same time that it targets key opposition leaders , polarizes society along political and class lines , and hypes the existence of external and internal enemies to justify repressive measures . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's preference for loyalty over competence , creation of parallel [MISC Bolivarian  ] institutions , efforts to forge a one-party state , and chest-thumping nationalism also smack of creeping totalitarianism . 
Overall , [PER Chavismo  ] poses a serious threat to democracy not just in [LOC Venezuela  ] but throughout the region , and it directly competes against [LOC U.S.  ] influence in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Moreover , it is becoming ever more difficult to begin any dialogue with a [ORG GBRV  ] increasingly consumed by its own solipsistic " revolutionary " fervor and outsized ambition . 
End Summary. --------------------------------------------- ------ One - There Is Only One [MISC Great  ] , Indispensable Leader --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Chavez  ] has carefully cultivated his own personality cult , such that for most [MISC Venezuelan  ] voters , President [PER Chavez  ] embodies [PER Chavismo  ] . 
Outsized billboards and posters of [PER Chavez  ] dominate public buildings as well as the rallies and campaigns of his [ORG United Socialist Party of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG PSUV  ] ) . 
[MISC Venezuelans  ] can buy a wide range of [PER Chavez  ] paraphernalia from [PER Chavez  ] action figures to [PER Chavez  ] watches to a compact disc of [PER Chavez  ] singing [MISC Venezuelan  ] folk songs . 
He dominates all state media , which also broadcast his Sunday " [MISC Alo  ] , Presidente " talk show . 
[PER Chavez  ] regularly requires all local television and radio networks to carry his speeches ( " cadenas " ) ; he has wracked up over 1200 such hours ( 50 days ) on the air . 
He has not groomed any successor and he frequently rebukes even his most trusted advisors publicly. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In pursuing the elimination of presidential term limits , [PER Chavez  ] declared publicly numerous times that he is indispensable to his [MISC Bolivarian  ] Revolution . 
While voters rejected his constitutional reform package in December 2007 , he succeeded in winning public approval of the elimination of term limits for all elected offices in the February 2009 referendum . 
[PER Chavez  ] has repeatedly stated that he plans to govern at least until 2020 . 
A corollary to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] president 's protagonism is that there can be no [PER Chavismo  ] without [PER Chavez  ] . 
No [PER Chavez  ] supporter who has broken with [PER Chavez  ] has prospered politically . 
The formerly pro-Chavez Podemos party is all but broken after opposing [PER Chavez  ] 's 2007 constitutional reform package . 
Former Defense Minister [PER Raul Baduel  ] also spoke against indefinite reelection ; he is currently sitting in a [LOC Caracas  ] military prison awaiting trial on corruption charges. ---------------------- Two - [ORG Centralize Power  ] ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Chavez  ] 's " Socialism of the 21st Century " exalts the government 's active role in the economy and vilifies capitalism , but in the minds of most [MISC Venezuelans  ] , it remains a vague notion of a state bearing benefits . 
The thread that most consistently ties together [PER Chavez  ] 's political project is the increasing concentration of power in his hands . 
[PER Chavez  ] has firm control over all the other branches of government . 
The opposition foolishly boycotted [ORG National Assembly  ] elections in 2005 , and currently only approximately 15 former government supporters do not automatically support [PER Chavez  ] in the 167-seat unicameral legislature . 
With few exceptions , the judiciary rules in favor of the executive branch , even in civil cases bereft of political implications. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Chavez  ] is also squeezing state and local governments from above and below . 
He recently promulgated a law that allows the central government to take state control over ports , airports , and highways . 
The central government has done just that in states run by opposition governors . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00000750 002 OF 004 Moreover , [PER Chavez  ] created an appointed position to take over virtually all the functions and budget of the opposition mayor of [LOC Caracas  ] . 
The [ORG National Assembly  ] is considering creating presidentially appointed regional vice presidencies that would undermine elected governors . 
The [MISC Venezuelan  ] president also created community councils nationwide which are registered by and report directly to the Office of the Presidency . 
[PER Chavez  ] diverted 30 percent of state and local discretionary development funds to these community councils. -------------------------------------------- Three - [PER Hype External  ] and Internal " Enemies " -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Chavez  ] insists on depicting the [LOC United States  ] ( which he habitually refers to as " The [ORG Empire  ] " ) as [LOC Venezuela  ] 's enemy . 
Although most [MISC Venezuelans  ] are not anti-American , [PER Chavez  ] 's radical foreign policy plays to his base of firm supporters and serves as a convenient rallying cry during [LOC Venezuela  ] 's frequent elections . 
Although he holds virtually absolute power in [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Chavez  ] tries to reframe public perceptions by depicting himself as [PER David  ] fighting [MISC Goliath  ] , usually the [LOC United States  ] , but also occasionally [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , or [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] and other senior [ORG GBRV  ] leaders have tempered this script somewhat since the election of President [PER Obama  ] . 
They tend to praise the President and Secretary personally , while quickly adding that " imperial " political power continues to be exercised in the [LOC United States  ] by big business , the military establishment , and the [MISC CIA.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Although domestic opposition to [PER Chavez  ] is weak and disunited , [PER Chavez  ] and senior [ORG GBRV  ] officials regularly accuse it of plotting to overthrow or assassinate the [MISC Venezuelan  ] president in coordination with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] does not produce proof or in most cases actually pursue charges ; such allegations conveniently serve to circle the wagons within [PER Chavismo  ] , to prevent across-the-aisle political dialogue , and to discredit the opposition . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] regularly reminds voters that large sectors of the opposition participated in the short-lived 2002 coup to give greater credence to current " threats . 
" [PER Chavez  ] also accuses the opposition of doing the [ORG USG  ] 's bidding , calling them " pitiyanquis . 
" Moreover , government supporters regularly accuse opposition-oriented press outlets of " media terrorism , " essentially building the case for continued government harassment of the vestiges of independent media. --------------- Four - Polarize --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Railing against the " oligarchs , " [PER Chavez  ] exploits class divisions in stratified [LOC Venezuela  ] for political gain . 
By playing almost exclusively to the over 70% of [MISC Venezuelans  ] who are poor , [PER Chavez  ] has maintained a reliable electoral majority ( with the exception of the 2007 constitutional referendum vote when many [PER Chavistas  ] abstained ) . 
He is not only channeling government resources to the economically disadvantaged , but also prioritizing the [ORG GBRV  ] 's role in the economy at the expense of the private sector . 
Such policies squeeze the middle class and are feeding a growing brain drain of professionals , sectors of society traditionally associated with the opposition . 
They also increase citizens' economic dependence on the [MISC GBRV.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Politically , [PER Chavez  ] tolerates no middle ground . 
Although increasingly large numbers of voters consider themselves politically neutral , most [MISC Venezuelans  ] still habitually self-identify themselves as either with " the process " or against . 
Moreover , the [ORG GBRV  ] has a good idea where most voters stand . 
Those that signed the 2004 recall referendum soon found themselves on the infamous " [PER Tascon List  ] " by which the [ORG GBRV  ] discriminated in terms of government jobs , contracts , and other benefits . 
In his speeches , [PER Chavez  ] frequently cites mentor [PER Fidel Castro  ] , bellowing in stark terms , " With the revolution , everything ; outside , nothing . 
" After its most recent registration drive , the [ORG PSUV  ] claims over seven million members . 
Local analysts believe the [ORG PSUV  ] party list is becoming the " reverse [PER Tascon List  ] " -- if your name is not on it , you cannot expect to get government services ( at least not without paying intermediaries ) . --------------------------------------- Five - Insist on [MISC Democratic Credentials  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Senior [ORG GBRV  ] leaders insist that " participatory " [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000750 003 OF 004 democracy is superior to " representative " democracy . 
They contend that real democracies give priority to " social rights " and argue that concepts such as checks and balances and institutional autonomy are discredited " bourgeois " concepts . 
[PER Chavez  ] also regularly stresses that he has held national elections almost yearly since he was first elected in 1998 , blurring any distinction between being elected democratically and governing democratically . 
Anxious to preserve their democratic legitimacy at home and abroad , [PER Chavez  ] and senior [ORG GBRV  ] officials lash out immediately and disproportionately to any criticism of [ORG GBRV  ] abuses . 
They traditionally dismiss any criticism as interference in [LOC Venezuela  ] 's domestic affairs and insult or try to discredit any government or organization that faults the [ORG GBRV  ] ( without ever engaging on the substance of the critique ) . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] forcibly expelled a [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] leader and a member of the [ORG European Parliament  ] when they publicly took issue with the [ORG GBRV  ] 's human rights record while in [LOC Caracas.  ] ------------------------------------ Six - Reward Loyalty Over Competence ------------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The single most important common characteristic of [PER Chavez  ] 's ministers and other senior officials is their unquestioning loyalty to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] president . 
He tends to rotate a small coterie of firm supporters through senior positions , simultaneously rewarding his inner circle while preventing them from accruing either real expertise or an independent power base . 
A substantial portion of [PER Chavez  ] 's appointed officials participated in his failed 1992 military coup . 
Moreover , [PER Chavez  ] retains loyalists despite their poor administrative or electoral track records . 
He named [PER Diosadado Cabello  ] , who last year lost his re-election for the [PER Miranda Governorship  ] , to be Minister of [ORG Infrastructure and Telecommunications  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] appointed [PER Jessie Chacon Information  ] Minister after he lost the mayoral race in the [LOC Sucre  ] borough of [LOC Caracas  ] . 
By contrast , [PER Chavez  ] 's [ORG PSUV  ] temporarily expelled [PER Henri Falcon  ] , the then widely hailed competent mayor of [LOC Barquisimeto  ] , only to quickly reinstate him after it became obvious that [PER Falcon  ] would win the governorship of [ORG Lara State  ] in 2008 with or without the [ORG PSUV  ] 's endorsement. --------------------------- Seven - [PER Repress Selectively  ] --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The [ORG GBRV  ] picks its political victims carefully , making examples of sector leaders . 
Such calibrated repression has so far avoided any significant public backlash while at the same time created a climate of fear in civil society and fostered self-censorship in the media . 
Examples abound . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] recently pressed corruption charges against [LOC Maracaibo Mayor  ] and 2006 consensus opposition presidential candidate [PER Manuel Rosales  ] ; [PER Rosales  ] fled to [LOC Peru  ] where he was granted asylum . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] jailed [PER Carlos Ortega  ] , the leader of the largest opposition trade union confederation . 
He escaped from military prison in 2006 and was also granted asylum in [LOC Peru  ] . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] closed the only critical free-to-air television network in 2007 and is threatening to do the same to opposition-oriented cable news network [ORG Globovision  ] . 
Prominent electoral NGO Sumate has been subject to numerous government investigations . 
[PER Chavez  ] and other senior [ORG GBRV  ] officials have blasted prominent [MISC Catholic  ] Church officials for defending democracy , and pro-Chavez thugs briefly occupied the Cardinal 's residence in downtown [LOC Caracas.  ] ---------------------------------- Eight - Create Parallel Structures ---------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Over the last ten years , the [ORG GBRV  ] and its supporters and allies have created new bodies and institutions in an effort to undermine and outflank organizations that it could neither control nor co-opt . 
Domestically , the [ORG GBRV  ] and its adherents have spawned pro-government [ORG NGOs  ] , business groups , labor unions , television and radio networks , and even a socialist spin-off of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's social programs ( " misiones " ) generally sidestep and starve long established government ministries of resources . 
Internationally , [PER Chavez  ] is endeavoring to establish multilateral organizations that both magnify [LOC Venezuela  ] 's influence and combat purported " [LOC U.S.  ] imperialism . 
" From the [ORG GBRV  ] 's perspective , [ORG ALBA  ] , [ORG Petrocaribe  ] , [ORG UNASUR  ] , and the [ORG Bank of the South  ] are tools with which to supplant or weaken the [ORG OAS  ] , [ORG IMF  ] , and the [ORG World Bank  ] . 
[LOC CARACAS  ] 00000750 004 OF 004 ------------------------- Nine - [ORG Party Equals State  ] ------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Since creating the [ORG United Socialist Party of Venezuela  ] ( [ORG PSUV  ] ) in 2007 , President [PER Chavez  ] has been trying to forge a one-party state . 
[PER Chavez  ] uses government resources , especially state media , and pressures the over two million government employees to support the [MISC Venezuelan  ] president , [ORG PSUV  ] candidates , and his referendum proposals during elections . 
The [ORG National Electoral Council  ] ( [ORG CNE  ] ) staffs [ORG PSUV  ] registration drives . 
[PER Chavez  ] demanded that all pro-government parties join the [ORG PSUV  ] , but three parties , the [ORG Communist Party  ] ( [ORG PCV  ] ) , [PER Patria Para Todos  ] ( [ORG PPT  ] ) , and the [ORG Podemos  ] party , declined . 
[ORG Podemos  ] later joined the opposition in 2007 . 
The [ORG PSUV  ] declined to support any [ORG PPT  ] or [ORG PCV  ] gubernatorial and mayoral candidates in the 2008 state and local elections and neither party now exercises any meaningful local power . 
Moreover , the [ORG National Assembly  ] is seriously considering an electoral law that would almost certainly expand the [ORG PSUV  ] 's absolute legislative majority and diminish the influence of the [ORG PPT  ] and [ORG PCV  ] after the 2010 parliamentary elections. ---------------------------- Ten - Monopolize Nationalism ---------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Calling himself the heir to [MISC Venezuelan  ] founder [PER Simon Bolivar  ] , [PER Chavez  ] asserts exclusive claim to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's forefathers and national symbols . 
He regularly cites [PER Bolivar  ] and other national heroes out of context , insisting that they were early socialists . 
One of [PER Chavez  ] 's stock stump speech messages is that his [MISC Bolivarian  ] Revolution liberated [LOC Venezuela  ] from being an [MISC American  ] colony and will make [LOC Venezuela  ] a world power in coming decades . 
In contrast , [PER Chavez  ] and his supporters depict the opposition as unpatriotic , stateless , or paid [LOC U.S.  ] agents . 
[PER Chavez  ] 's own exaggerated demonstrations of patriotism conveniently distract public attention from local problems or demonstrate incontrovertibly that he can do what he wants . 
In 2006 , [PER Chavez  ] added a star to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] flag and flipped the horse on the national seal to make it run left , not right . 
In 2007 , he eliminated three zeros from the currency and changed its name from " bolivars " to " strong bolivars . 
" He also added the prefix " [ORG People 's Power  ] " to all ministries and ordered all [MISC Venezuelan  ] clocks changed by thirty minutes to create a unique [MISC Venezuelan  ] time zone . 
In 2008 , he suggested that he would exhume [PER Bolivar  ] 's body to prove that he was poisoned ( He has not done so yet ) . ------- Comment ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The increasingly authoritarian nature of [LOC Chavismo  ] , not to mention its habitual and politically convenient vilification of the [LOC United States  ] , pose considerable challenges to any effort to improve bilateral ties . 
[PER Chavez  ] and other senior [ORG GBRV  ] officials publicly express interest in greater dialogue with the [ORG USG  ] , but the reality is that to date , the [ORG GBRV  ] has been reluctant to create meaningful and easily accessible channels of communication , let alone engage substantively on issues that should be of common interest . 
The [ORG GBRV  ] also makes it clear that it will not accept or look past any [ORG USG  ] criticism , however well-founded or required by congressionally-mandated reports or testimony . 
Facing no checks on his power at home , [PER Chavez  ] craves international attention and influence abroad . 
Whether it is funneling arms and money to the [ORG FARC  ] , sending suitcases of money to the [MISC Kirchner  ] campaign in [LOC Argentina  ] , or exporting elements of [LOC Chavismo  ] to [ORG ALBA  ] countries , to name just a few prominent examples , [PER Chavez  ] 's outsized ambition backed by petrodollars makes [LOC Venezuela  ] an active and intractable [LOC U.S.  ] competitor in the region .
