( C/NF ) Summary . 
Convicted [PER Pam Am  ] 103 bomber Abdelbasset al-Megrahi has inoperable , incurable cancer , but it is not clear how long he has to live , according to two separate medical opinions obtained by officials at [LOC Greenock  ] prison near [LOC Glasgow  ] , where [PER Megrahi  ] is currently serving a life sentence . 
Preparatory hearings for the second appeal of [MISC Megrahi’s  ] conviction , meanwhile , are continuing , but the appeal itself will probably not begin until late 2009 , according to the [MISC Scottish  ] Crown . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] government is therefore pursuing [MISC Megrahi’s  ] early release through two other channels , the [ORG FCO  ] reports: compassionate release under [MISC Scottish  ] law , and the as-yet unsigned [ORG UK-Libya Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] ( [ORG PTA  ] ) . 
[ORG HMG  ] has made clear to the [MISC Libyans  ] , to [ORG Embassy London  ] and to the media that it will take no official position on [MISC Megrahi’s  ] early release , but will leave the decision - whether through compassionate release or the [ORG PTA  ] - to the devolved [MISC Scottish  ] government . 
At the same time , [ORG FCO  ] contacts tell us that [ORG HMG  ] is adamant that , despite devolution , [LOC London  ] controls foreign policy for the [LOC UK  ] , not the [MISC Scottish  ] . 
[ORG Embassy London  ] is working with the [ORG FCO  ] and the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] to find a way to represent USG views on the matter to the [MISC Scottish  ] government , should we wish to , without making any implicit statement about [LOC UK  ] national foreign policy prerogatives. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Summary cont . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] have not yet made a formal application for compassionate release for [PER Megrahi  ] , but [ORG HMG  ] believes that the [MISC Scottish  ] may be inclined to grant the request , when it comes , based on conversations between [MISC Scottish  ] First Minister ( PM-equivalent ) [PER Alex Salmond  ] and [LOC UK  ] Justice Secretary [PER Jack Straw  ] . 
Although the general practice is to grant compassionate release within three months of end of life , this is not codified in the law , so the release , if granted , could occur sooner rather than later . 
End summary . 
[MISC Megrahi’s Diagnosis  ] ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Megrahi  ] was first diagnosed on September 23 at [LOC Inverclyde Royal Hospital  ] , both the [ORG FCO  ] and the [MISC Scottish  ] Crown office have told us ; the second diagnosis was on October 10 . 
The two diagnoses match: he has prostate cancer that has spread to his bones , the cancer has advanced rapidly , and it is inoperable and incurable . 
[PER Megrahi  ] could have as long as five years to live , but the average life expectancy of someone of his age with his condition is eighteen months to two years . 
Doctors are not sure where he is on the time scale , and therefore , how much longer he has to live . 
He has visibly deteriorated in recent weeks , according to those who have visited him . 
His visitors have included a [MISC Libyan  ] oncologist , who expressed satisfaction with the medical treatment [PER Megrahi  ] has been receiving . 
[ORG FCO North Africa Group Head Rob Dixon  ] told us October 22 that [PER Qadhafi  ] apparently complained about the [MISC Scots’  ] treatment of [PER Megrahi  ] , but that complaint was unspecific and hasn’t been repeated . 
[PER Megrahi  ] has told his family he is dying , and is receiving regular visits from a imam . 
Compassionate Release --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC Libyans  ] are pursuing two tracks to obtain [MISC Megrahi’s  ] release , apart from the appeal , [PER Dixon  ] told us . 
The first is the possibility of early release on compassionate grounds . 
FCO Minister for the [LOC Middle East  ] [PER Bill Rammell  ] sent [MISC Libyan  ] Deputy FM Abdulati al-Obeidi a letter , which was cleared both by [ORG HMG  ] and by the [ORG Scottish Executive  ] , on October 17 outlining the procedure for obtaining compassionate release ( text of letter sent to [ORG NEA  ] and L ) . 
It cites [ORG Section  ] 3 of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings ( [LOC Scotland  ] ) Act of 1993 as the basis for release of prisoners , on license , on compassionate grounds . 
Although the [ORG Scottish Crown  ] informed the families of the [ORG Pan Am  ] 103 victims in an email October 21 that the time frame for compassionate release is normally three months from time of death , [PER Dixon  ] stressed to us that the three month time frame is not codified in the law . 
Although [MISC Scottish  ] Justice Minister [PER Kenny MacAskill  ] would normally make the final decision , [MISC Scottish  ] First Minister [PER Alex Salmond  ] told [PER Jack Straw  ] that he will make the final decision in this case . 
[PER Salmond  ] told [PER Straw  ] that he would make the decision based on humanitarian grounds , not foreign policy grounds ; [PER Dixon  ] told us [ORG HMG  ] has interpreted this to mean that [PER Salmond  ] is inclined to grant the request . 
Publicly , [PER Salmond  ] has refused to speculate on what decision he might make. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC Libyans  ] have not yet requested compassionate release , but have indicated to the [ORG FCO  ] that they will . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials are currently seeking a meeting with the [ORG Scottish Executive  ] to discuss the situation . 
If [PER Megrahi  ] were to be released on compassionate grounds , he would be released into [LOC Scotland  ] , but could be transferred back to [LOC Libya  ] . 
According to [PER Dixon  ] , [PER Megrahi  ] does not have to drop his appeal in order to be granted compassionate leave . 
[ORG Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) The second track that the [MISC Libyans  ] are pursuing to obtain [MISC Megrahi’s  ] early release is the [ORG UK-Libya Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] . 
The text of the [ORG PTA  ] is not yet concluded between [ORG HMG  ] and [LOC Libya  ] , although the [MISC Libyans  ] are now pushing for this process to be expedited , [PER Dixon  ] tells us . 
Once the two governments reach agreement on the text , [ORG HMG  ] will proceed to clear it with the devolved governments of [LOC Northern Ireland  ] , [LOC Wales  ] , and [LOC Scotland  ] . 
[PER Salmond  ] publicly expressed his ire to then-PM [PER Tony Blair  ] for not consulting with [LOC Scotland  ] beforehand when [ORG HMG  ] announced its intention to pursue a [ORG PTA  ] with [LOC Libya  ] in 2007 ; nonetheless , [PER Dixon  ] says the current draft [ORG PTA  ] contains standard language that the [MISC Scottish  ] have cleared for other countries . 
Once the three devolved governments agree to the text , [MISC Libyan  ] and [MISC British  ] officials will sign it . 
[PER Dixon  ] says the signing will probably take place before Christmas . 
Once it is signed , under [MISC British  ] law the [ORG PTA  ] needs to sit for 21 days before the [ORG House of Commons  ] and in the Lords before it is enacted , meaning that late January 2009 is the earliest the [ORG PTA  ] could come into effect . 
[PER Megrahi  ] cannot be transferred under the [ORG PTA  ] while he has an appeal pending . 
[PER Dixon  ] says that [PER Megrahi  ] is not specifically mentioned in the text ; however , there are no other prisoners currently in the [LOC UK  ] prison system to which the [ORG PTA  ] would apply . 
Status of [LOC Megrahi’s Appeal  ] -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG Scottish High Court’s  ] October 15 decision to allow all grounds for appeal to be considered , including grounds that had been previously rejected by the [ORG Scottish Criminal Case Review  ] commission ( text sent to [ORG NEA/MAG  ] and [ORG L/LEI  ] ) , slows the whole appeal process down , according to [ORG Scottish Court Head of Policy  ] [PER John Logue  ] . 
[PER Logue  ] and [PER Dixon  ] both estimate that the appeal itself probably won’t begin until late 2009 , and probably won’t conclude until 2010 , [PER Dixon  ] said . 
Under [MISC Scottish  ] law , even if [PER Megrahi  ] dies before the appeal is completed , a third party “with a legitimate interest” can continue the appeal on his behalf . 
The [ORG Scottish Crown  ] is therefore proceeding with the case , [PER Logue  ] said . 
UK: Between a Rock and A [ORG Hard Place  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG HMG  ] is in an awkward position , [PER Dixon  ] and [ORG Cabinet Office North Africa  ] officer [PER Ben Lyons  ] confided to us . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] have told [ORG HMG  ] flat out that there will be “enormous repercussions” for the [ORG UK-Libya  ] bilateral relationship if [MISC Megrahi’s  ] early release is not handled properly . 
At the same time , in keeping with the practice of devolution , [ORG HMG  ] has made clear to the [MISC Libyans  ] , to the media , and to us that it will take no official position on [MISC Megrahi’s  ] early release , but will leave the decision on early release - whether through compassionate release or the [ORG PTA  ] - to the [MISC Scottish  ] government , and the decision on the appeal to the [MISC Scottish  ] courts . 
But [ORG HMG  ] is also adamant that , despite devolution , [LOC London  ] controls foreign policy for the [LOC UK  ] , not [LOC Edinburgh  ] . 
Added to the mix are [PER Alex Salmond  ] and his [ORG Scottish National Party  ] , whose stated goal is an independent [LOC Scotland  ] , with a referendum on the issue to be held in 2010 ; [PER Salmond  ] and the [ORG SNP  ] will look for opportunities to exploit the [PER Megrahi  ] case for their own advantage . 
This is the first time [ORG HMG  ] has had to deal with a foreign policy issue under devolution , [PER Dixon  ] said , and [ORG HMG  ] is feeling its way forward , as are the [MISC Scottish  ] ; [PER Logue  ] told us that [LOC Scotland  ] , for example , has never before granted compassionate release to a foreign national . 
We noted that while we understand the complexities of the issue for [ORG HMG  ] , we need to find a channel for consultation and representation of [ORG USG  ] views on the matter to the [MISC Scottish  ] government , should we wish to , while taking [ORG HMG  ] equities into account . 
Our [ORG HMG  ] interlocutors agreed to explore options with us . 
[PER Comment: Devolution  ] and Foreign Policy --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) This is the first time that [ORG HMG  ] - and the [ORG USG  ] - will face a foreign policy decision made under the constraints of devolution , and the channels that we establish now will set a precedent for future cases . 
In creating these channels , we will need to take into account sensitivities on the sides of both [ORG HMG  ] and the [ORG Scottish Executive  ] , while ensuring that whatever position we may want to convey in the [PER Megrahi  ] case gets to the right officials in a timely manner. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
