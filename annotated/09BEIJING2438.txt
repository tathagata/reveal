Reasons 1 . 
4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: The  ] unstable post-election political climate in [LOC Iran  ] likely precludes the initiation of formal negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] on ceasing its uranium enrichment program , according to a [LOC PRC  ] scholar . 
Though [LOC Iran  ] is sincere in wishing to reach out to the [LOC United States  ] on broader bilateral issues , it remains wary of " falling into a trap " in bilateral negotiations . 
Under these circumstances , the scholar suggests , the [LOC United States  ] should undertake " se cret " talks with [LOC Iran  ] that would entail a [LOC U.S.  ] concession allowing [LOC Iran  ] some nuclear enrichment activities in return for [LOC Iran  ] 's adherence to a strict [ORG IAEA  ] safeguard agreement , its cessation of support for [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizbollah  ] , and cooperation in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC China  ] has encouraged [LOC Iran  ] to enter into negotiations with the [LOC United States  ] , according to our contact , while the [LOC United States  ] is involved in regional conflicts where [LOC Iran  ] could play a positive role . 
However , the scholar stressed , pressing for additional sanctions through the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] mechanism would be counterproductive and put [LOC China  ] in a " difficult position " of having to side with either the [LOC United States  ] or [LOC Iran  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Director of the [ORG Center for Middle East Studies  ] at the [ORG MFA-affiliated China Institute  ] for [ORG International Studies  ] ( [ORG CIIS  ] ) and frequent media commentator on [LOC Middle East  ] issues [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told PolOff August 24 that though the unexpected turmoil surrounding the June 12 [MISC Iranian  ] election had politically weakened both President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] and supreme leader [PER Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  ] , both they and opposition candidate [PER Mir Hussein Moussavi  ] were " one side of a coin " in that none of them supported the suspension of [LOC Iran  ] 's uranium enrichment activities . 
Post-Election Atmosphere Not Right for Negotiations --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] argued that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's congratulatory letter sent to President [PER Obama  ] following the 2008 [LOC U.S.  ] elections had been a sincere indication of the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership 's willingness to talk . 
[PER Li  ] said he had learned that former [MISC Iranian  ] foreign minister [PER Ali Akbar Velayati  ] had discreetly contacted [ORG USG  ] officials prior to the June 12 presidential election in [LOC Iran  ] , agreeing to resume bilateral contacts after the election concluded , but that the turmoil and the lingering instability in [LOC Iran  ] had prevented movement on that initiative . 
[PER Li  ] reported that his contacts in [LOC Iran  ] had recently said that the [MISC Iranian  ] political climate post-election was still not stable enough for the leadership to engage in public negotiations on the nuclear issue . 
" [PER Obama  ] Factor " -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] said an additional factor adding to the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership 's reticence to reach out to the [LOC United States  ] was President [PER Obama  ] 's positive image among the [MISC Iranian  ] public . 
( " [PER Obama  ] is with us , " was an example of public sentiment reported to him by his [MISC Iranian  ] contacts . 
) Despite the fact that the leadership was satisfied with President [PER Obama  ] 's statements after the June election , [MISC Iranian  ] leaders were wary of " falling into a trap " in negotiations with [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Li  ] suggested that [PER Khamenei  ] remained suspicious of the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] based on the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership 's perception that these countries had played a role in stirring post-election turmoil . 
Grand Bargain in the Works ? --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] stated that [LOC Iran  ] agreeing to suspend uranium enrichment unilaterally or completely was a " non-starter . 
" [PER Li  ] cited unnamed contacts in the [LOC United States  ] " with close access to policy-makers on [LOC Iran  ] " to support his belief that the [LOC United States  ] would be willing to accept some internationally-supervised uranium enrichment by [LOC Iran  ] . 
This would be a concession , [PER Li  ] said , that " the [MISC Europeans  ] would have great difficulty accepting . 
" To make such a concession diplomatically palatable , [PER Li  ] continued , the [LOC United States  ] in return would expect [LOC Iran  ] 's cessation of support for [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizbollah  ] , among other terrorist groups in the region , and its cooperation in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In addition , [PER Li  ] suggested , the [LOC United States  ] would expect [LOC Iran  ] to agree to a stricter [ORG IAEA  ] safeguard agreement that would control [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear activities and include terms that would be integrated into the NPT as a basis for further safeguards governing all [LOC BEIJING  ] 00002438 002 OF 002 NPT signatory countries ( reftel ) . 
He stated that before agreeing to a low level of [MISC Iranian  ] enrichment activity , the [LOC United States  ] would insist [LOC Iran  ] implement a six-to-twelve-month freeze on nuclear enrichment activities. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] stressed that any [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program negotiations , which he believed would be lengthy , should be " se cret " and seek to produce a " win/win " scenario for both countries . 
[PER Li  ] stated that [LOC Iran  ] had doubts about the [ORG USG  ] 's ability to enter such a bargain , given [LOC U.S.  ] political pressures , and that to the [MISC Iranians  ] , a signal of [LOC U.S.  ] sincerity to move forward might come through an unofficial visit along the lines of [PER Henry Kissinger  ] 's late June trip to [LOC China  ] to discuss [LOC North Korea  ] sanctions or former President [PER Clinton  ] 's early August visit to [LOC Pyongyang  ] to effect the release of the two [MISC American  ] journalists , which in his view had allowed the atmosphere for negotiations with the [LOC DPRK  ] to improve . 
[PER Li  ] suggested that former President [PER Clinton  ] could perhaps secure the release of the [MISC American  ] hikers detained by [MISC Iranian  ] authorities . 
[PER Li  ] stated that the key element of a [PER Kissinger  ] visit would be the former Secretary of State 's ability to have discreet , private and informal discussions . 
[LOC China  ] Urges [LOC Iran  ] to [ORG Reach Out  ] to the [LOC United States  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite [MISC U.S.-Iranian  ] tensions , the [LOC PRC  ] had encouraged [LOC Iran  ] to take advantage of current circumstances to mend ties with the [LOC United States  ] , according to [PER Li  ] , arguing that the [LOC United States  ] would be more open to making concessions now because it was in a relatively weaker position tending to a number of trouble spots around the world , including the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC South Asia  ] , and needed [LOC Iran  ] 's help in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , as the [LOC United States  ] regained its position of strength , according to [PER Li  ] , its willingness to make concessions would disappear . 
[PER Li  ] reported that MFA West [MISC Asian  ] and [MISC North African Affairs Department Director General Song  ] Aiguo had affirmed to him recently that [LOC China  ] " would do whatever it could " to assist communication between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
Asked whether [LOC Iran  ] viewed [LOC China  ] as a fair broker , [PER Li  ] said , " [LOC Iran  ] trusts nobody . 
" While [LOC Iran  ] understood [LOC China  ] 's interests in [LOC Iran  ] , the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership believed that when pushed to make a choice , [LOC China  ] would side with the [LOC United States  ] over [LOC Iran  ] . 
P5 plus 1: A Show for Public Consumption ---------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Li  ] stated that the P5-plus-1 process " was for public consumption " and that expectations of its success should be minimal . 
Acknowledging the increasing pressure for additional sanctions given [LOC Iran  ] 's current unresponsiveness to offers of engagement , [PER Li  ] stated that pushing for additional sanctions would play to the hard-liners' advantage in [LOC Iran  ] and not bring any change in [MISC Iranian  ] behavior . 
In addition , the prospect of imposing additional sanctions would put [LOC China  ] in a " difficult position " of choosing between its interests vis-a-vis the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , a choice it hoped to avoid .
