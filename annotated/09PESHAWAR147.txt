( C ) [MISC Summary: As  ] the government of [LOC Pakistan  ] has worked to prepare for its upcoming ground operation in [ORG South Waziristan Agency  ] ( [ORG SWA  ] ) against [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] ( ref C ) and the [ORG Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan  ] ( [ORG TTP  ] ) , it has narrowed the focus of its operation by attempting to keep neutral the two other major militant leaders in the area and building two other more minor leaders up against [PER Baitullah  ] . 
The government has worked through jirgas led by [ORG Deobandi  ] clerics associated with the [ORG Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam  ] ( [ORG JUI-F  ] ) to isolate [PER Baitullah  ] and his lieutenants ; as the operation has become more imminent ( and to [ORG JUI-F  ] leader [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] 's chagrin ) , these jirgas have been sidelined . 
Tribal maliks , though included in those jirgas , are too cowed to play anything other than supporting roles , and the [ORG SWA Political Agent  ] , while talented , is rarely able to even enter [ORG SWA  ] due to security concerns . 
Political actors will continue to work around the edges , but they are ceding the field to the military and militants for the foreseeable future . 
End summary . 
[PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] and His Lieutenants ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) 35-year-old [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] has been the most prominent militant in [LOC Waziristan  ] since the death of [MISC Wazir  ] leader [PER Nek Mohammad  ] in 2004 and the most notorious militant in [LOC Pakistan  ] since his announcement of the formation of the [ORG TTP  ] and assassination of [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] in December 2007 . 
He has undisputed control over the [PER Mehsud  ] home areas of northeastern [ORG SWA  ] and significant influence in areas with [PER Mehsud  ] diaspora populations such as Tank and [LOC Dera  ] [PER Ismail Khan  ] districts . 
Since the formation of [ORG TTP  ] , an umbrella group whose expressed aim is to overthrow the government of [LOC Pakistan  ] and secure its [ORG FATA  ] safehaven in order to support cross-border attacks into [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Mehsud  ] and his allies had established significant levels of effective control in part or all of [LOC Kurram  ] , [LOC Orakzai  ] , [LOC Khyber  ] , [LOC Mohmand  ] , and [LOC Bajaur  ] agencies , as well as in [LOC Swat  ] , [LOC Shangla  ] , [LOC Buner  ] , and [LOC Lower Dir  ] districts prior to recent military operations . 
In all of these areas , Consulate contacts and [MISC Pakistani  ] press have reported a strong presence of [PER Mehsud  ] tribesmen and allied [MISC Uzbek  ] militants supporting local elements fighting against the government. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Qari Hussain  ] has long been [PER Baitullah  ] 's most feared lieutenant from [LOC Waziristan  ] ; a post contact in the [ORG NWFP  ] parliamentary assembly included him as one of six militants whose death would prove that the [MISC Pakistani  ] government was " serious " about finally getting tough on militants . 
He was notable over the period 2006-8 for claiming the most extreme and offensive actions taken by the [ORG TTP  ] , particularly in the wake of the government 's July 2007 operation against the [LOC Lal Masjid  ] in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
These actions included suicide bombings throughout the [ORG NWFP  ] , the kidnapping of [LOC FC  ] personnel , and an attack on the Tank family residence of the Political Agent for [MISC Khyber Agency  ] which killed many of his relatives and guests , among them surrendering women and girls , violating one of the strongest taboos under [MISC Pashtun  ] tribal law . 
[PER Baitullah  ] disavowed most of these activities , though they generally directly benefited him . 
In late 2008 , after the conclusion of the most recent peace deal in [ORG SWA  ] , [PER Baitullah  ] " exiled " him to [MISC North Waziristan  ] because of his poor image ; he recalled him to [ORG SWA  ] recently . 
[PER Hussain  ] may have been killed in an air strike on a post-funeral meeting on June 23 in [LOC South Waziristan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) [PER Hakimullah Mehsud  ] , a first cousin to [PER Baitullah  ] , has come to prominence more recently , initially commanding [ORG TTP  ] forces assisting [MISC Sunni  ] militants who were fighting [MISC Shi'a  ] militants in [LOC Kurram  ] agency and neighboring [LOC Hangu  ] district . 
His activities quickly spread to [LOC Orakzai  ] , where he masterminded an October 2008 suicide bombing of a jirga that killed over fifty tribal maliks and broke virtually all organized resistance to [ORG TTP  ] control in most of the agency . 
By early December 2008 , his men in [LOC Khyber  ] were launching regular raids on trucking depots around [ORG Peshawar  ] and burning hundreds of trucks containing supplies for [MISC American  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
A [MISC Pakistani  ] military operation in [LOC Khyber  ] in January 2009 reduced [ORG TTP  ] effectiveness operating out of that agency , but [PER Hakimullah  ] continued to plan and execute attacks out of his base in [LOC Orakzai  ] [ORG PESHAWAR  ] 00000147 002 OF 005 prior to returning to [ORG SWA  ] in late May , reportedly with large numbers of those under his command and in preparation for the upcoming [ORG SWA  ] operation . 
[PER Misbahuddin Mehsud  ] and [ORG Turkestan  ] Bhittani - GOP Surrogates --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Misbahuddin Mehsud  ] , the 23-year-old younger brother of the recently assassinated [PER Qari Zainuddin  ] ( ref C ) , is [PER Zainuddin  ] 's apparent successor as leader of a group of Mehsuds independent of [PER Baitullah  ] who have engaged in tit-for-tat assassinations and street battles with the [ORG TTP  ] in the areas of Tank and [LOC Dera  ] [PER Ismail Khan  ] over the past several months . 
[PER Zainuddin  ] was generally considered raw and untested ; his close familial relation ( first cousin ) to deceased militant leader [PER Abdullah Mehsud  ] and the clear [MISC Pakistani  ] government backing given to him , however , had made him the pole around which anti-Baitullah militants had coalesced . 
[PER Misbahuddin  ] is even more untried . 
He is reportedly more poorly educated and rougher of manner than [PER Zainuddin  ] ( [PER Misbahuddin  ] 's nickname is [PER Tofan  ] , meaning " storm " and referring to his temper ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Turkestan  ] [MISC Bhittani  ] , a 40-year-old soldier who retired from the [MISC South Waziristan Scouts  ] ( [ORG Frontier Corps  ] ) in 1998 to fight for the [MISC Taliban  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , was an ally of [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] until 2007 . 
Following his break with [PER Baitullah  ] , he formed a militia composed primarily of members of the [MISC Bhittani  ] tribe . 
The [MISC Bhittani  ] , whose population lives primarily in the area along the border between [ORG SWA  ] and Tank and controls access between [PER Mehsud  ] territory and the settled areas to the east , has a history of feuds with the Mehsuds ; relatively few Mehsuds are settled in [LOC Jandola  ] and the other [MISC Bhittani-dominated  ] areas around it . 
A June 2008 incident in which TTP-affiliated Mehsuds overran the town of [LOC Jandola  ] and carried off thirty [MISC Bhittani  ] tribesmen and killed over twenty of them ( including many close relatives of [ORG Turkestan  ] ) solidified [MISC Bhittani  ] tribal opposition to the [ORG TTP  ] . 
As [PER Qari Zainuddin  ] 's group gained mass over recent months , [ORG Turkestan  ] allied his own , longer-lived group to it , and this alliance seems unlikely to change with [PER Zainuddin  ] 's death . 
A [MISC Bhittani  ] contact told us that it was [ORG Turkestan  ] 's firm control of [LOC F.R. Tank  ] that allowed [PER Qari Zainuddin  ] space to grow his group ; [ORG Turkestan  ] had and continues to have a strong personal interest in assisting any group that would weaken the [ORG TTP  ] . 
[PER Hafiz Gul Bahadur  ] - Siding with the [ORG TTP  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Hafiz Gul Bahadur  ] , a senior militant commander in [MISC North Waziristan Agency  ] ( [ORG NWA  ] ) and erstwhile rival of [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] for the title of " leader " of the [MISC Tehrik-i-Taliban  ] , is an [PER Utmanzai Wazir  ] in his late 40s . 
Despite considerable effort by the [MISC Pakistani  ] government to keep him on the sidelines and an initial period in which his quiescence appeared to indicate that he would stay out of the fight , [PER Bahadur  ] allowed and then claimed a series of escalating ambushes of [MISC Pakistani  ] military convoys June 26-28 . 
His spokesman then announced on June 29 that the February 2008 peace deal with the government that [PER Bahadur  ] had hitherto more or less respected was now a dead letter due to continued drone strikes in and [MISC Pakistani  ] military operations near [ORG NWA  ] ( ref B ) . 
( Note: Consulate contacts told us that [PER Bahadur  ] had faced pressure from lieutenants to confront the [MISC Pakistani  ] military . 
) The government responded with airstrikes against his positions on June 30 , but reiterated its commitment to the peace deal . 
A low-level conflict has ensued since , with occasional minor attacks by militants on [MISC Pakistani  ] military installations . 
[PER Maulavi Nazir  ] - Neutral ? ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Maulavi Nazir  ] , the senior militant commander in southern and western [ORG SWA  ] , is an [PER Ahmadzai Wazir  ] in his 30s . 
Our contacts from and in [ORG SWA  ] consider [PER Nazir  ] to have been the [MISC Pakistani  ] government 's man ever since his 2007 campaign against [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] ally [PER Haji Omar  ] and associated [MISC Uzbek  ] militants residing in [MISC Ahmadzai  ] areas of [ORG SWA  ] , though [PER Nazir  ] signed on to the February 2009 alliance with [PER Baitullah  ] . 
Like [PER Bahadur  ] , he has remained silent about the upcoming operation ; on July 2 , he told [ORG PESHAWAR  ] 00000147 003 OF 005 a jirga that he would maintain neutrality . 
A well-connected [PER Ahmadzai Wazir  ] who resides part-time in [LOC Wana  ] told us that [PER Nazir  ] will stay out of the fight unless a spillover from the campaign creates significant casualties among [PER Ahmadzai Wazir  ] militants or civilians . 
In such a circumstance , [PER Nazir  ] would come under considerable pressure to retaliate proportionately . 
This is a plausible eventuality . 
According to a Consulate contact in [ORG SWA  ] , since the beginning of June , an [MISC Ahmadzai  ] lieutenant of [PER Nazir  ] in the Angoor Adda area of [ORG SWA  ] ( near the [MISC Afghan  ] border ) has repeatedly detonated roadside bombs against [MISC Pakistani  ] military vehicles , killing several soldiers and wounding dozens of others . 
More recently , over the past two weeks rockets have been fired from [PER Ahmadzai Wazir  ] areas toward [MISC Pakistani  ] military installations in and around [LOC Wana  ] . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] army has retaliated in each instance by shelling militant positions in the areas from which attacks have been launched . 
The Haqqanis - Staying Out of the Fight --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Jalaluddin Haqqani  ] and his son [PER Sirajuddin  ] , [MISC Afghans  ] who are based primarily in [ORG NWA  ] , are involved primarily in the fight against coalition forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Jalaluddin  ] , a former anti-Soviet mujahid from the [MISC Zadran  ] tribe who had been aligned with [ORG Hizb-i-Islami  ] ( [PER Khalis  ] ) , is now in his 70s and is considered by our contacts to have a close relationship with [MISC Afghan  ] [MISC Taliban  ] leader [PER Mullah Mohammed Omar  ] . 
[PER Sirajuddin  ] , in his 30s , runs day-to-day affairs for the [PER Haqqani  ] network . 
This [MISC Taliban  ] group operates primarily in [LOC Khowst  ] and [LOC Paktika  ] provinces but is also suspected of having a hand in some of the most audacious [MISC Taliban  ] attacks in [LOC Kabul  ] , including the July 2008 bombing of the [MISC Indian  ] embassy there . 
The Haqqanis have generally taken the stance that attacks against [LOC Pakistan  ] 's government are illegitimate , and they have worked to keep militant leaders in [MISC Waziristan  ] focused on the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] - without success in the case of [PER Gul Bahadur  ] . 
They appear to be hunkering down as well ; a Consulate contact in the inner circle of the [ORG NWFP  ] 's ruling [ORG Awami National Party  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) says that they have moved their families out of the agency and to [LOC Rawalpindi  ] ( ref A ) . 
[PER Maulana  ] [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] and the [LOC Deobandis  ] - The [MISC Would-Be Mediators  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The opening moves to the government 's [ORG SWA  ] campaign have occasioned a flurry of jirgas aimed at mediating between the [MISC Pakistani  ] government and the various militant leaders . 
These jirgas have been very similarly composed: led by elected officials or prominent mullahs ( and usually both ) , they have been composed in equal measure by maliks from the affected areas and prominent mullahs active in the region but outside of tribal structures . 
The most active jirga , which has been shuttling between the [MISC Pakistani  ] government and [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] , has been led by Senator [PER Saleh Shah  ] , a [ORG Deobandi  ] cleric in his thirties from [ORG SWA  ] ( but not a [PER Mehsud  ] or [PER Wazir  ] ) who leads two madrassas , one in the [LOC Tirarzia  ] tehsil of [ORG SWA  ] ( north of [LOC Wana  ] , in the [PER Mehsud  ] area ) and the other in the [MISC Mehsud-settled  ] [PER Murtaza  ] area of Tank . 
In his absence ( when the [ORG Senate  ] is in session ) , jirga leadership has generally fallen to [PER Maulana Esamuddin Khan  ] , a [ORG Mehsud Deobandi  ] cleric who has led a madrassa in [LOC Makeen  ] , the heart of the area controlled by [PER Baitullah  ] . 
[PER Maulana Mirajuddin Qureshi  ] , another [ORG Mehsud Deobandi  ] cleric who is a former [ORG National Assembly  ] member , has also played a leading role . 
Over the past two weeks , activity by this jirga has tailed off as military operations have increased their pace. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Saleh Shah  ] , [PER Esamuddin  ] , and [PER Qureshi  ] ( along with fellow repeated jirga leaders [PER Noor Mohammad  ] among the [PER Ahmadzai Wazirs  ] and [PER Maulavi Nek Zaman  ] among the [PER Utmanzai Wazirs  ] ) are affiliated with the [ORG Deobandi Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam  ] party faction under the direction of [PER Maulana Fazlur  ] [PER Rehman  ] ( [MISC JUI-F  ] ) . 
[PER Fazlur Rehman  ] , whose hometown is nearby Dera [PER Ismail Khan  ] , has positioned himself and his party as a primary mediator between the government and militants ; his affiliates have been mediators in each of the five peace agreements concluded in the [MISC Waziristans  ] since 2004 . 
His decreasingly oblique criticisms of [MISC Pakistani  ] military operations in [LOC Swat  ] and the surrounding [ORG Malakand PESHAWAR  ] 00000147 004 OF 005 division and his more direct criticisms of a follow-on [MISC Waziristan  ] operation have kept pace with the increasing drumbeat of official talk about [MISC Waziristan  ] . 
[PER Fazlur Rehman  ] 's upset at the prospect of such an operation may in part be a reaction the political support that his party continues to carry there ( significantly greater than that enjoyed by his party in [ORG Malakand  ] ) , but it also reflects the fact that the beginning of such an operation will represent the eclipse of his affiliates' mediating role in favor of force wielded by parties outside of his control . 
The Maliks - A Non-Factor ------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The peace jirgas of the past two months , led and partially staffed by [ORG Deobandi  ] clerics , have generally been filled out by [PER Mehsud  ] maliks ( tribal elders ) . 
Our contacts from [ORG SWA  ] have uniformly dismissed them as entirely cowed by [PER Baitullah  ] and irrelevant in mediation ; the deaths of over three hundred other [MISC Waziristan  ] maliks over the past four years appear to have sapped them of the willingness to confront [PER Baitullah  ] in any way and rendered them essentially placeholders in the jirgas for sake of form . 
Asked if there were any maliks of sufficient stature to chart an independent course at all , one contact responded with a [MISC Pashtun  ] proverb in which a prince , queried on how he kept his kingdom under control , replied by silently chopping off the tops of all of the tallest poppies in the field where he was walking . 
[PER Shahab Ali Khan  ] - The [ORG Absentee Political Agent  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Shahab Ali Khan  ] , a [LOC Bannu  ] native in his mid-30s , was appointed [ORG Political Agent  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) of [ORG SWA  ] in September 2008 . 
He has been in district government service for just over ten years ; before his current posting , [PER Khan  ] had most recently served as District Coordination Officer in the sectarian strife-ridden [LOC Hangu  ] district from 2007 . 
[PER Shahab Ali  ] has been described by his peers and locals as a good negotiator in an agency where many consider such skills a necessity , and he most recently played a secondary role in the release of the kidnapped students from [ORG Razmak Cadet College  ] . 
He reportedly holds conservative views and is pious . 
His youth is noted by his colleagues , though it is not his greatest handicap: effective militant control over virtually all of " his " agency makes it difficult to travel outside of [LOC Wana  ] and makes life dangerous even in that city . 
He reputedly spends most of his time in Tank . 
The Division Commanders - A Mixed Bag ------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The commanders of the three [MISC Pakistani  ] military divisions that will bear the brunt of the fight in [MISC Waziristan  ] come from widely varying backgrounds . 
The [ORG Seventh Division  ] , headquartered in [PER Miram Shah  ] , [ORG NWA  ] , is commanded by [MISC Major General  ] [PER Navid Zaman  ] . 
[PER Zaman  ] , a [MISC Punjabi  ] from [LOC Rawalpindi  ] , spent several successful years as a staff officer at [LOC Pakistan  ] 's [ORG General Headquarters  ] ( [ORG GHQ  ] ) prior to assuming command in October 2008 . 
The [ORG Ninth Division  ] , headquartered in [LOC Wana  ] , [ORG SWA  ] , is commanded by [PER Khalid Rabbani  ] . 
[PER Rabbani  ] , who has previous experience as a brigade commander in the [LOC FATA  ] , was most recently assigned as [LOC Pakistan  ] 's [ORG Defense Attache  ] to [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] , which face counterinsurgency challenges of their own . 
He left that position at the end of 2007 and was given command of the [ORG Ninth Division  ] at roughly that time , making him the longest-serving of the three in their current capacities ( ref E ) . 
The [ORG Fourteenth Division  ] , headquartered in Tank , is commanded by [MISC Major General  ] [PER Ijaz Chaudhry  ] , of whom less is known ; he assumed command of the division in September 2008 . 
Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] and the military are the predominant actors in [MISC South Waziristan  ] . 
However , as the government plays out a strategy of divide and rule , the alliances , feuding , and maneuverings of other militants as well as tribal and political [ORG PESHAWAR  ] 00000147 005 OF 005 figures bears watching in assessing the direction that operations in [MISC South Waziristan  ] will take .
