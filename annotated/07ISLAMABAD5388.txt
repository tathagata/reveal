Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] has unofficially selected former [MISC Punjab  ] Chief Minister and current head of the party’s [LOC Punjab  ] chapter , [PER Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi  ] , as its candidate for the Prime Ministership following the January 2008 national elections . 
[PER Elahi  ] , who until the November 15 dissolution of the provincial governments served as Punjab’s Chief Minister , has long been a prominent figure in center-right politics in the [LOC Punjab  ] province . 
While [PER Elahi  ] lacks the personal charisma of other major political leaders , such as the late [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] and [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , his political instincts and organizational skills more than compensate for this deficiency . 
Unlike [PER Bhutto  ] and [PER Sharif  ] , who run their parties as personal fiefdoms based on the sheer force of their personalities , [PER Elahi  ] and his cousin/brother-in-law [PER Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain  ] have a history of deal-making and coalition-building with Pakistan’s center-right , that has created personal and political ties between them and most of the Punjab’s feudal and industrial elite. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Elahi  ] first came to prominence along with his older cousin and brother-in-law [PER Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain  ] as supporters of center-right leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] . 
As [MISC Lahore-based  ] Kashmiris who relied primarily on the army and intelligence agencies for political elevation , the [ORG Sharifs  ] lacked personal ties and common ground with most of Punjab’s center-right politicians who hailed from the province’s traditional feudal and industrial families . 
The [ORG Chaudhrys  ] , industrialists from [LOC Gujrat  ] , were among the first to recognize the [MISC Sharifs’  ] rising influence in center-right politics and first formed business and later political ties to the family . 
For this reason , both [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] and [PER Ch  ] . 
Shujaat were ultimately admitted to the [MISC Sharifs’  ] inner circle , making them arguably the second most powerful family in the [ORG Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz  ] . 
The [ORG Sharifs  ] came to rely on the [ORG Chaudhrys  ] for much of the political strategy and deal-making that kept the coalition of [MISC Punjabi  ] feudals and industrialists -- on which the party was based -- working in tandem ( despite [PER Nawaz Sharif’s  ] notoriously difficult personality ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Chaudhrys’  ] major rift with the [ORG Sharifs  ] came following the 1997 elections . 
[PER Nawaz Sharif  ] had ostensibly promised [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] and [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Shujaat  ] that , in return for engineering an election campaign that resulted in a two-thirds majority for the party in the [ORG National Assembly  ] , [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] would be made Chief Minister of the [LOC Punjab  ] . 
Following the party’s victory , however , [PER Nawaz  ] broke his word and instead elevated his brother [PER Shahbaz  ] to the Chief Ministerial office -- leaving [PER Elahi  ] as Speaker of the [ORG Provincial Assembly  ] . 
While [PER Elahi  ] remained loyal to [PER Nawaz  ] and the [MISC PML-N  ] , the relationship between the two families never fully recovered . 
[PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] has raised this story on more than one occasion with the Principal Officer , as evidence of [PER Sharif’s  ] lack of trust in non-family members , and as a reason for the break between the two families following the 1999 coup. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The decision to remain with the [MISC PML-N  ] in 1997 , despite differences with the [ORG Sharifs  ] , was largely due to the [MISC Chaudhrys’  ] distaste for the [PER Bhutto  ] family -- a rivalry that pre-dates the current generation . 
The [ORG Chaudhrys  ] hold [PER Benazir Bhutto’s  ] father responsible for the death of [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] Elahi’s father and for the imprisonment and torture of [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Shujaat Hussain’s  ] father during the elder [PER Bhutto’s  ] tenure as Prime Minister . 
Both [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] and [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Shujaat  ] were briefly detained by the elder [PER Bhutto  ] . 
[PER Ch  ] . 
Shujaat’s father was a close advisor to [PER Gen. Zia-ul-Haq  ] following his 1979 coup against [PER Bhutto  ] , and is believed to have encouraged [PER Gen. Zia  ] to have [PER Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto  ] executed . 
Rumor in [LOC Lahore  ] is that [PER Ch  ] . 
Shujaat’s father loaned [PER Gen. Zia  ] his pen to sign [PER Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s  ] death warrant . 
[PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] ostensibly purchased the same pen at an auction some years later . 
The [ORG Chaudhrys  ] are believed to have actively opposed a pre-electoral deal devised between [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] and President [PER Musharraf  ] in September 2007 , largely due to their personal animosity for [PER Bhutto  ] . 
Since her death , [PER Elahi  ] , in conversation , has suggested that he would be able to form a solid working relationship with either of her likely successors , [PER Amin Faheem  ] or [PER Bhutto’s  ] husband , [PER Asif Ali Zardari  ] . 
ISLAMABAD 00005388 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Following the 1999 coup both [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] and [PER Ch  ] . 
Shujaat were detained by the [ORG National Accountability Bureau  ] on corruption charges relating to unpaid state-owned bank loans that were made to their companies . 
Charges against both were dropped following an agreement they made to defect from the [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] - [PER Nawaz  ] and assist President [PER Musharraf  ] in building a new center-right [ORG Muslim League  ] in [LOC Punjab  ] . 
The [ORG Chaudhrys  ] are believed to have been offered this deal at the behest of [ORG National Security Council  ] Secretary [PER Tariq Aziz  ] -- who they once counted as a close SIPDIS political ally ( they have since fallen out over differences relating to the award of PML tickets in 2002 and 2005 , and Musharraf’s negotiations with the late [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] ) . 
The [ORG Chaudhrys  ] carried out this new role in much the same manner as they had for the [ORG Sharifs  ] , putting together a party based upon personal ties between them and other [MISC Punjabi  ] feudals and industrialists . 
While the party had no grassroots supporters , its candidates in both 2002 and 2005 performed well due to their personal influence in their local areas. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) As a reward for his political service , [PER Ch  ] . 
[PER Pervaiz  ] was appointed as Punjab Chief Minister following the 2002 national elections -- the post earlier denied to him by [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] . 
By all accounts , [PER Elahi  ] performed exceptionally well in his role as an administrator . 
He clearly defined his government’s priorities ( health care , education , and infrastructure development ) ; devoted significant financial resources to these priority areas ; and appointed capable , competent ministers to head these departments . 
International donor agencies have certified that Elahi’s government achieved significant improvements in many of the key indicators in these areas. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Elahi  ] has been a strong supporter of President Musharraf’s enlightened moderation agenda and favors swift , decisive law enforcement action against terrorists and extremist organizations . 
Senior law-enforcement officials , who worked with [PER Elahi  ] as Chief Minister , claim that he gave clear instructions that significant resources were to be devoted to infiltrating and dismantling terrorist organizations and to monitoring and curtailing the activities of religious leaders believed to have extremist tendencies . 
Under his leadership , the [LOC Punjab  ] police were successful in bringing down a number of terrorist cells in the province. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) At the same time , [PER Elahi  ] believes that the government must make a clear distinction between terrorists , and conservative religious figures . 
While [PER Elahi  ] and his family are followers of moderate [MISC Sufi  ] traditions , he has , largely for political reasons , built ties with more conservative [ORG Deobandi  ] religious institutions , particularly the [ORG Deobandi  ] madrassa board and the [ORG Tablighi Jamaat  ] . 
These individuals , who had been traditionally ignored by Punjab’s center-right politicians ( almost all of whom follow the [MISC Sufi  ] school of through ) , have provided [PER Elahi  ] with a source of influence in these communities -- unparalleled by other main-stream politicians . 
[PER Elahi  ] has used this influence to encourage reform within Punjab’s madrassas and obtain strong statements from these leaders condemning terrorist violence and declaring its un-Islamic . 
Absent the support he enjoyed in these quarters , it is doubtful that the government could have proceeded with its admittedly incomplete ISLAMABAD 00005388 003 OF 003 religious-reform agenda. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Elahi  ] is a close advisor of President [PER Musharraf  ] , and is regularly consulted by him on political strategy . 
This advice , however , is not always followed -- leading to a certain degree of tension in their relationship . 
[PER Elahi  ] believes that if he and [PER Shujaat  ] had been listened to , the entire Chief Justice episode and the state of emergency could have been avoided . 
If elected Prime Minister , [PER Elahi  ] will not content himself with the titular role played by his predecessors and will insist on full control over broad aspects of domestic policy and political strategy . 
This will inevitably bring him into conflict with the President , although given their prior relationship , these issues can probably be resolved quite amicably. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Elahi  ] was born in 1945 and educated at [LOC Lahore’s  ] [ORG Forman Christian College  ] and [ORG Watford College of Technology  ] in [LOC London  ] . 
He is married with two sons . 
The elder is a [MISC Sufi  ] religious scholar , who avoids politics and public appearances . 
The younger , [PER Moonis Elahi  ] , attended the [ORG Wharton Business School  ] and is being groomed by his father as the family’s political heir , [PER Moonis  ] is contesting his first provincial assembly elections in January 2008 , for seats in both [LOC Lahore  ] and the family’s base in [LOC Gujrat  ] .
