KEY POINTS -- ( C ) [ORG GOE  ] officials , including presidential advisor [PER Soliman Awad  ] , expressed displeasure with the number and the tone of [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations at the February 17 [ORG UN Human Rights Council 's Universal Periodic Review  ] ( [ORG UPR  ] ) of [LOC Egypt  ] 's human rights record. -- ( C ) The [ORG MFA  ] noted it had accepted [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations to lift the [ORG State of Emergency  ] and replace it with a counterterrorism law guaranteeing civil liberties , and to amend the legal definition of torture to be consistent with its obligations under the [ORG UN Convention Against Torture.  ] -- ( C ) Human rights activists criticized the [ORG GOE  ] for " wrongly " rejecting [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations , and " denying the facts of its human rights violations . 
" Activists said they would follow up with the [ORG GOE  ] on implementing recommendations although the [ORG GOE  ] 's commitments are non-binding. -- ( U ) In local media coverage , independent outlets reported western countries' recommendations for the [ORG GOE  ] to improve its human rights record , while the pro-government media emphasized [ORG GOE  ] officials' responses to the recommendations. --------------------------------------------- --------------- [ORG GOE  ] Displeased with [LOC U.S.  ] Recommendations --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On February 24 , presidential advisor [PER Soliman Awad  ] expressed concern to the Ambassador over the number of [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations . 
[PER Awad  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] should focus on principles regarding religious freedom , not conversions and proselytizing which " makes [MISC Egyptians  ] suspicious , " he claimed . 
[ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director for [ORG Human Rights  ] [PER Omar Shalaby  ] told us the [ORG GOE  ] was displeased with both the number and the tone of [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations , " especially in light of recent bilateral cooperation in the [ORG UN Human Rights Council  ] . 
" He said that on instruction from the [ORG MFA  ] , Ambassador [PER Shoukry  ] had conveyed this message to Vice President [PER Biden  ] 's staff during a meeting to discuss the Vice President 's planned upcoming visit to [ORG Cairo  ] , and the [MISC Egyptian  ] Permanent Representative in [LOC Geneva  ] had made these points to the [ORG U.S. Mission  ] . 
[PER Shalaby  ] explained that although [MISC European  ] countries made many of the same recommendations , the [ORG GOE  ] was " less bothered " because it does not enjoy " the same level of cooperation with the [MISC Europeans  ] . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Shalaby  ] disputed the [LOC U.S.  ] recommendation to eliminate legal and bureaucratic restrictions on an individual 's choice of religion , claiming that the obstacles are practical , not legal . 
We pushed back , noting court rulings against converts from [MISC Islam  ] to Christianity . 
" The number of recommendations in itself is an issue , " [PER Shalaby  ] noted , and he said the high number led to [ORG GOE  ] speculation over [LOC U.S.  ] motives . 
According to [PER Shalaby  ] , some in the [ORG GOE  ] wondered whether the [LOC U.S.  ] was under " external pressure " to be more " hawkish " on human rights in [LOC Egypt  ] , or whether the [LOC U.S.  ] intervention was " retribution " for [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] differences over procedure during the 2009 [LOC Israel  ] [ORG UPR  ] . 
We told [PER Shalaby  ] that the recommendations reflect [LOC U.S.  ] concern over a broad range of human rights issues in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
( Note: The [ORG MFA  ] 's February 18 public statement did not mention [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations . 
The statement welcomed the [ORG UPR  ] process as an opportunity to demonstrate " [LOC Egypt  ] 's human rights progress , " and rejected recommendations " by a few [ORG CAIRO  ] 00000253 002 OF 003 western countries " on " issues related to homosexuals , " and marriage and divorce . 
End note .

( C ) [PER Shalaby  ] said the [ORG GOE  ] believed it had accepted some important recommendations , such as those by the [LOC U.S.  ] to replace the [ORG State of Emergency  ] with a counterterrorism law guaranteeing civil liberties , and to ensure the legal definition of torture conforms with its obligations under the [ORG UN Convention Against Torture  ] . 
He also noted the [ORG GOE  ] accepted recommendations to combat religious discrimination . 
[PER Shalaby  ] was pleased with [ORG GOE  ] interactions with [MISC Egyptian  ] civil society during the [ORG UPR  ] , saying that Parliamentary Affairs Minister [PER Mufeed Shehab  ] met twice with [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Geneva.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- Activists Critical of [ORG GOE Performance  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights  ] Director [PER Hossam Bahgat  ] who attended the [ORG UPR  ] assessed that the [ORG GOE  ] delegation was " very weak on substance . 
" According to [PER Bahgat  ] , the [ORG GOE  ] was " wrong " in rejecting as inaccurate [LOC U.S.  ] recommendations on arrests of activists under the [ORG Emergency Law  ] , and restrictions on choosing religion . 
[PER Bahgat  ] wished the [LOC U.S.  ] had explicitly noted [ORG GOE  ] arrests of [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] members . 
[ORG Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies  ] Director [PER Moataz El-Feigery  ] criticized the [ORG GOE  ] for " denying facts , " and demonstrating a lack of political will . 
He was pessimistic that the [ORG GOE  ] would implement recommendations . 
[PER El-Feigery  ] believed [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] were able to successfully influence western countries' recommendations . 
He welcomed western countries' recommendations , but would have liked more discussion of [ORG GOE  ] legal restrictions on presidential candidates ( ref B details these restrictions ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Human Rights  ] lawyer [PER Nasser Amin  ] who attended the [ORG UPR  ] called [ORG Arab League  ] and [ORG Organization of the Islamic Conference  ] support for [LOC Egypt  ] " absurd . 
" He believed these interventions were coordinated , due to their similarity in heaping praise on superficial [ORG GOE  ] efforts . 
[PER Amin  ] said Minister [PER Shehab  ] told [ORG NGOs  ] privately that he wanted to " open a new page with civil society , " but [PER Amin  ] criticized [PER Shehab  ] for not " seriously addressing " the issues during the [ORG UPR  ] session . 
President of the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG Organization  ] for [ORG Human Rights Hafez  ] [PER Abu Seada  ] said he will press the [ORG GOE  ] to implement the recommendations it accepted , especially on amending the legal definition of torture . 
[PER Abu Seada  ] , who is also a member of the quasi-governmental [ORG National Council for Human Rights  ] , told us he asked Minister [PER Shehab  ] to involve civil society in implementing the recommendations. ----------------------------- [ORG Local Media Coverage  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Egyptian  ] media covered the [ORG UPR  ] session and its aftermath in news stories , but provided little analytical commentary . 
The independent print press focused its reporting on western countries' recommendations , while the pro-government media covered the [ORG GOE  ] 's responses to the recommendations . 
A popular satellite television talk show aired comments from activists and opposition politicians criticizing the [ORG GOE  ] for not engaging more [ORG CAIRO  ] 00000253 003 OF 003 with civil society in advance of the [ORG UPR  ] , and for violating [MISC Egyptians'  ] human rights . 
Pro-government paper " [PER Rose El-Youssef  ] , " which is close to the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , reported Minister [PER Shehab  ] saying [LOC Egypt  ] would not accept recommendations conflicting with its " social and cultural context . 
" " [PER Rose El-Youssef  ] " also reported that the [ORG MFA  ] 's February 18 statement rejected recommendations on " issues related to homosexuals .
