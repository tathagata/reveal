End Summary . 
Focus on [LOC Kandahar  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [ORG SCR  ] told [ORG AWK  ] the attention of the [MISC Afghan  ] government , with [ORG ISAF  ] support , would turn to [LOC Kandahar  ] in the months ahead and it was likely this would be predominantly a political contest that would require the leadership from the highest level of the [MISC Afghan  ] government . 
[ORG SCR  ] discussed the governance strategy for [LOC Kandahar City  ] and surrounding districts . 
[ORG AWK  ] understood the next phase of operation [PER Moshtarak  ] would be on [LOC Kandahar  ] and offered his support . 
[ORG SCR  ] responded this would be an [MISC Afghan  ] Government-led effort and the coalition would be focusing its resources on building up that capacity . 
[ORG SCR  ] was clear the coalition would not tolerate individuals working at odds to [ORG ISAF  ] campaign aims . 
[ORG AWK  ] stated " nobody is that stupid . 
" [ORG Better Security and Economy  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [ORG AWK  ] told the [ORG SCR  ] that security has improved in [LOC Kandahar  ] over the past year . 
Freedom of movement had increased across the province , he said , citing his driving to the meeting at [LOC Kandahar  ] Airfield with minimum security . 
[PER AWK  ] said insurgents no longer have the capability to launch large scale attacks ; for example , [ORG AWK  ] does not fear an insurgent attack on his home . 
[PER AWK  ] expressed concern about a series of assassinations aimed at [MISC Afghan  ] officials and [MISC Afghan  ] citizens who work for the coalition in the city , noting this could only be solved by intelligence assets . 
[PER AWK  ] said economic activity had increased in the [LOC Kandahar City  ] area , but noted his belief that President [PER Karzai  ] is largely unaware of these gains . 
[PER AWK  ] told the President about increased economic activity in [LOC Arghandab  ] related to [ORG AVIPA Plus  ] and the President was very surprised , he said . 
[PER AWK  ] said the President did not understand the changing circumstances in the province . 
[LOC Kandahar  ] Politics Are Local --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [PER AWK  ] said that it was important to get district-level tribal dynamics right to bring stability to [LOC Kandahar City  ] and its environs . 
[PER AWK  ] specifically stated the need to rely on local , village elders to choose representatives to district shuras . 
This would ensure a representative shura for district level officials , said [ORG AWK  ] and pointed to the succession of [MISC Arghandab-based  ] [ORG Alikozai  ] leader [PER Mullah Naqib  ] . 
[PER AWK  ] said the [ORG Alikozais  ] chose [PER Mullah Naqib  ] 's son , [PER Karimullah  ] , to lead the [ORG Alikozai  ] . 
[ORG SCR  ] pointed out coalition conventional wisdom that President [PER Karzai  ] had interfered in that process to appoint [PER Karimullah  ] , which led to certain [ORG Alikozai  ] elements to support the [MISC Taliban  ] in [LOC Arghandab  ] . 
[PER AWK  ] said , unconvincingly , this was not the case . 
[PER AWK  ] then contradicted himself and said [PER Karimullah  ] , in fact , did not lead the [ORG Alikozai  ] , but [PER AWK  ] 's deputy at the provincial council [LOC Dastegeeri  ] , was the most influential [ORG Alikozai  ] in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
Police in the [LOC South  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [ORG SCR  ] told [PER AWK  ] the coalition would not accept powerbroker interference with the police and used the example of citizens in [MISC Marjah  ] telling [MISC Marines  ] they would not [LOC Kabul  ] 00000693 002 of 003 support GIRoA due to past xxxxxxxxxxxx abuses xxxxxxxxxxxx [LOC Kandahar  ] does not have similar issues of interference with the police , he said , but [ORG SCR  ] pressed saying we are aware of a recent incident when the [LOC Kandahar  ] governor sought to remove the [LOC Panjwa'i  ] chief of police , but someone had intervened to halt that removal . 
[PER AWK  ] , who is believed to have prevented Governor [PER Weesa  ] from firing the police chief , said the governor had the power to remove police officials and should exercise that authority in [LOC Panjwa'i  ] . 
[PER AWK  ] characterized Governor [PER Weesa  ] as honest and a powerful figure in [LOC Kandahar  ] , but he needed to be more aggressive . 
In the same breath , [PER AWK  ] said he was the most powerful official in [LOC Kandahar  ] and could deliver whatever is needed . 
Capture of [PER Mullah Baradar  ] ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [ORG SCR  ] asked [PER AWK  ] his views on the recent capture in [LOC Pakistan  ] of [MISC Taliban  ] leader [PER Mullah Baradar  ] . 
[PER AWK  ] said [LOC Pakistan  ] detained [PER Baradar  ] and other [MISC Taliban  ] leaders because they were prepared to discuss reintegration with the [PER Karzai  ] government . 
Senior [MISC Taliban  ] fighters in [LOC Pakistan  ] may be prepared to reintegrate , he said , but are forced by the [ORG Pakistan Government  ] to continue to fight . 
[PER AWK  ] said some [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] commanders cannot return to [LOC Afghanistan  ] because they are on the [ORG Joint Priority Effects List  ] ( [ORG JPEL  ] ) and are told by the [MISC Pakistanis  ] they must continue to fight or will be turned over to the coalition . 
It is important to remove such fighters from the [ORG JPEL  ] for reintegration to work , he argued , adding that he has been working on the reconciliation issue with the [MISC Saudis  ] for two-three years . 
[PER AWK  ] offered a meeting with [ORG SCR  ] and his older brother and former Member of [LOC Parliament  ] for [LOC Kandahar  ] [PER Kayyum Karzai  ] in the next few weeks to discuss ongoing reintegration discussions with the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
Drug Trafficker: Where is the [MISC Polygraph  ] ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) Unprompted , [PER AWK  ] raised allegations of his involvement in narcotics , telling the [ORG SCR  ] that he is willing to take a polygraph anytime , anywhere to prove his innocence and that he has hired an attorney in [LOC New York  ] to clear his name . 
He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin , which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation . 
[PER AWK  ] dismissed the narcotics allegations as part of a campaign to discredit him , particularly by the media , saying the allegations are " like a spice added to a dish to make it more enticing to eat . 
" A [ORG Political Party  ] for [ORG Southern Pashtuns  ] ? ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [ORG SCR  ] asked [PER AWK  ] if there are discussions to create a [MISC Pashtun-oriented  ] political party in the [LOC South  ] . 
[PER AWK  ] said such a party would be announced shortly and it would encompass southern [MISC Pashtuns  ] from [LOC Herat  ] to [LOC Kandahar  ] ; Tajiks also would be represented . 
[PER AWK  ] said [MISC Afghans  ] are reluctant to join political parties because they are associated with the communist party and [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalist movements , like the [MISC Taliban  ] . 
He added that he could not be part of another election because he had to personally manage promises to hundreds of thousands of voters in the last election . 
[PER Gulaga Sherzai:  ] Competitor -------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [ORG SCR  ] raised the recent 1,500 person shura co-hosted by [PER AWK  ] and [PER Sherzai  ] in [LOC Kandahar City  ] ( Reftel B ) . 
[PER AWK  ] said [PER Sherzai  ] was not to be trusted , but he was willing to work with him on a peace jirga to deliver peace to the south . 
[PER AWK  ] passionately presented his history of working with the [LOC United States  ] since 2001 and told the [ORG SCR  ] that he could deliver anything needed . 
Missing [PER Wrigley  ] --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [PER SBU//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) Further emphasizing his links to the [LOC United States  ] , [PER AWK  ] fondly recalled his days in [LOC Chicago  ] as a restaurant owner close to [LOC Chicago  ] 's [LOC Wrigley Field  ] . 
His [LOC Kabul  ] 00000693 003 of 003 restaurant was a hub for [MISC American  ] in the [LOC Midwest  ] who had worked or lived in [LOC Afghanistan  ] prior to the [MISC Soviet  ] invasion , he said . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [PER S//Rel NATO  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] ) [PER AWK  ] was eager to engage and rarely stopped talking in the two hour meeting . 
While he presented himself as a partner to the [LOC United States  ] and is eager to be seen as helping the coalition , he also demonstrated that he will dissemble when it suits his needs . 
He appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities , and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign , particularly relating to his influence over the police . 
We will need to monitor his activity closely , and deliver a recurring , transparent message to him of where are redlines are and what we expect of him in the months ahead .
