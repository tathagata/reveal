[PER Nancy McEldowney  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Despite its status as Bulgaria’s highest priority energy project , the [ORG Belene Nuclear Power Plant  ] ( [ORG NPP  ] ) is foundering . 
Marred by cost over-runs , financing problems , infighting between strategic partners , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and serious delays , the project is looking increasingly like a lemon . 
The relationship between the government and the project’s strategic investor , the [MISC German  ] [ORG RWE  ] , is one of mutual buyer’s remorse . 
But with 700 million euros in sunk costs , in addition to priceless political capital already invested , the government is unlikely to walk away from the project . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) When [MISC Bulgarians  ] talk about the [LOC Belene  ] nuclear power plant , they increasingly do so in hushed tones . 
Issues of delays , financing woes , non-transparent horse-trading and side deals , [MISC Russian  ] influence , middle-man rent seeking , and the interests of well-connected politicians and energy oligarchs inevitably come up . 
Belene’s construction offered the perfect chance for [LOC Bulgaria  ] to decrease its independence on [MISC Russian  ] energy sources . 
But the [MISC Stanishev-led  ] government , indebted to [MISC Russia-connected  ] energy oligarchs , let the opportunity slip away . 
In 2006 , [LOC Bulgaria  ] chose [MISC Russian  ] company AtomStroyExport over a [MISC Skoda-led  ] consortium as [ORG Belene  ] NPP’s main contractor . 
The tender was managed by former Minister of [ORG Economy and Energy  ] [PER Rumen Ovcharov  ] , a pro-Russia energy maestro , who left office ( but not political life ) in June 2007 after an energy-related corruption scandal . 
The [ORG Belene  ] deal lacked transparency and reeked of side deals involving the proposed [LOC South Stream  ] gas pipeline and the long-term gas transit contract [PER Ovcharov  ] was negotiating with [ORG Gazprom  ] at the same time. ------------------------------- ONE OLD PROJECT GETS A NEW LIFE ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Belene  ] was originally started in the 1980s , but was abandoned in the early 1990s due to lack of funds . 
In 2005 , to make up for the [MISC European  ] Commission’s decision to close Bulgaria’s Kozluduy [ORG NPP  ] reactors 1-4 , the [MISC Bulgarian  ] government approved the construction of a new 2000 MWe plant at [LOC Belene  ] . 
( Note: Kozluduy units 1 and 2 were shut down due to safety concerns in 2003 , while units 3 and 4 were taken off-line at the end of 2006 , on the eve of Bulgaria’s [ORG EU  ] accession . 
) The [ORG Bulgarian National Electric Company  ] ( [ORG NEC  ] ) hired [ORG WorleyParsons  ] as the strategic architect engineer for the financing and construction of the plant in 2005 . 
[LOC Belene  ] , s two units ( 1 and 2 ) will be of the [MISC Russian  ] A-92 design ( third generation ) with pressurized water reactor ( [ORG PWR  ] ) , each producing 1000 MW electric power . 
The main contractor of the project , AtomStroyExport , is working with the main foreign contractor [ORG CARSIB Consortium  ] ( [ORG Areva  ] and [ORG Siemens  ] ) . 
In December 2008 [ORG NEC  ] and [ORG RWE  ] ( [LOC Germany  ] ) signed a strategic investor agreement for the project with [ORG NEC  ] controlling 51 percent and [ORG RWE  ] with 49 percent. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Bulgarian  ] company participation in the [LOC Belene  ] project is approximately 30 percent . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXThe [MISC French  ] bank [ORG PNB Paribus  ] financed the pre-construction loan of 250 million [MISC Euros  ] . 
Currently , teams are preparing the site for new construction by tearing down old infrastructure from the 1980s . 
The plant’s construction is expected to begin in late 2009 or early 2010 . 
Construction will be in two stages . 
[ORG Unit  ] 1 was originally planned to come on-line in 2014-2015 followed by [ORG Unit  ] 2 in 2015-2016 , according to the [ORG Belene  ] [ORG NPP Managing Director  ] , [PER Jordan Georgiev  ] . 
These time frames are now widely in doubt. --------------- BUYER’S REMORSE --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Despite its due diligence , our contacts tell us [LOC Belene  ] , s strategic investor , [ORG RWE  ] , is now experiencing regret about its purchase . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG RWE  ] [LOC SOFIA  ] 00000069 002 OF 002 worries about the project’s lack of transparency and the need to work with AtomStroyExport . 
[ORG RWE  ] wants to enforce [MISC European  ] business practices , and is now demanding to review all Belene-related agreements . 
[ORG RWE  ] is reportedly negotiating with Belgium’s [ORG Electrabel  ] to join it as a subcontractor ( likely to be announced in mid-March ) to help re-inforce standard [MISC European  ] business practices . 
RWE’s insistence on reviewing all agreements is causing [LOC Bulgaria  ] heartburn . 
Delays of 3-5 years have already been announced , and [LOC Belene  ] is not expected to come on-line until 2016-2017 . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG RWE  ] realizes that working with [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Bulgarian  ] companies in the energy sector is a “poisonous combination” for [MISC European  ] investment . 
Transparency is affecting financing . 
[ORG RWE  ] ( and [ORG Electrabel  ] ) want [MISC European  ] banks to finance their half of the project , hoping [ORG EU  ] restrictions and western lending standards would help with transparency . 
However , with the current global financial crisis , they believe finding a [MISC European  ] bank will be difficult and may reluctantly have to turn to [LOC Russia  ] for the money. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Bulgarians  ] are also experiencing buyer’s remorse . 
Despite Russia’s offer to extend a loan of about four billion [MISC Euros  ] for the project , rumors abound that the [MISC Russians  ] do not have the money to finance the project and the [MISC Bulgarians  ] have been reluctant to take the money in any event , for fear of being seen as “too close” to the [MISC Russians  ] . 
For their part , the [MISC Bulgarians  ] at [LOC Belene  ] are chafing at [ORG RWE  ] , s close scrutiny of all decisions and complain that this approach is needlessly slowing the project . 
Our contacts say that some [MISC Bulgarian  ] officials are beginning to admit privately that in [LOC Belene  ] , they have bought “a lemon.” [ORG NEC  ] has sunk approximately 700 million euros into the project , while the [MISC Russians  ] are not out of pocket and could walk away losing nothing . 
Meanwhile , cost estimates for [LOC Belene  ] continue to creep up , running as high as eight billion euros , double the original price. ------------------------------ [LOC BELENE  ] VS [ORG KOZLUDUY UNITS  ] 7 & 8 ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The rumors of trouble at [LOC Belene  ] have resurrected the idea of a competing project at Bulgaria’s only working nuclear power plant , [PER Kozluduy  ] . 
[MISC Bulgarian  ] Minister of Energy and [ORG Economy  ] [PER Petar Dimitrov  ] has been actively and publicly courting [MISC Westinghouse  ] to invest in a project to build two new reactors at [LOC Kozluduy  ] -- units 7 and 8 . 
Contacts say that the existing infrastructure , powerlines connecting [PER Kozluduy  ] to the national power grid , and a highly-skilled workforce close by at currently-operating [ORG Kozludy  ] 5 and 6 give [ORG Kozluduy  ] 7 and 8 at least a one billion euro cost edge over [LOC Belene  ] . 
[MISC Westinghouse  ] officials are cautiously interested , but only if the [LOC Belene  ] project is abandoned and [MISC Bulgarian  ] government financial support is put into [PER Kozluduy  ] . 
They want to avoid being used simply to create a new sense of urgency to jump-start [LOC Belene.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: There is clearly something amiss at [LOC Belene  ] . 
Asked whether the project was in jeopardy , a senior [ORG WorleyParsons  ] official privately told us that while the project was still likely to go forward , “countries walk away from deals like this all the time.” With elections on the horizon and 700 million euros in sunk costs , in addition to priceless political capital already invested , the government is unlikely to abandon the project any time soon . 
But it may be on a very slow track .
