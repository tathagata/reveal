( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The top [ORG UNHCR  ] official in [LOC Tripoli  ] voiced concern that Italian-Libyan cooperation to return migrants interdicted in the [MISC Mediterranean  ] to [LOC Libya  ] was violating the migrants' human rights and endangering bona fide asylum seekers . 
He noted that some migrants had been forcibly and violently returned by [MISC Italian  ] officials , leaving several migrants in need of urgent medical care . 
[LOC Libya  ] , in turn , did not grant [ORG UNHCR  ] officials access to screen returned migrants for asylum seekers until several days after their return . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] remains hopeful that the [ORG European Commission  ] will lean on both [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Libya  ] to fulfill their commitments under international conventions and will press [LOC Libya  ] to sign a formal [ORG MOU  ] allowing [ORG UNHCR  ] to operate normally in the country . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] reported that it was focusing more attention on resettlement to the [LOC U.S.  ] and expects the first visit of the regional [ORG Overseas Processing Entity  ] ( [ORG OPE  ] ) to visit [LOC Libya  ] shortly after [PER Ramadan  ] ( early October ) . 
The Chief of [MISC Mission  ] asked that the [ORG USG  ] remain open to resettlement via [MISC UNHCR-run  ] processing centers in [LOC Europe  ] and asked for further guidance on whether migrants screened by the [ORG OPE  ] and subsequently transferred to [LOC Romania  ] would need to begin the entire resettlement process again . 
End summary . 
UNHCR: REFUGEE CRISIS AS SOURCE OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS FROM [LOC ITALY  ] , [ORG LIYBA  ] 2 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) In a July 28 meeting with [MISC Pol/Econ  ] chief and [ORG Poloff  ] , [ORG UNHCR  ] Chief of [MISC Mission Mohammed  ] al-Wash complained that [LOC Italy  ] was breaking its commitments to support [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] charters on human rights by returning asylum seekers to [LOC Libya  ] with other economic migrants , and strongly denounced the [MISC Italian  ] [ORG Coast Guard  ] 's tactics while forcing migrants to return . 
He cited the example of the return of 80 migrants -- including several refugees registered with [ORG UNHCR  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Addis Ababa  ] , and [LOC Cairo  ] -- interdicted by [LOC Italy  ] on or around July 1 who later related their story to [ORG UNHCR  ] staff . 
When the vessel carrying the migrants was stopped , three [MISC Eritrean  ] representatives reportedly asked to speak with the [MISC Italian  ] ship 's commander to inform him of their refugee status . 
Several on the boat produced their [ORG UNHCR  ] attestations for the commander . 
Replying that he was under strict orders from his government to return migrants to [LOC Libya  ] , the [MISC Italian  ] commander reportedly ordered that all migrants - including those registered with [ORG UNHCR  ] -- be removed from their vessel for transport to [LOC Libya  ] . 
Some of the migrants refused , leading to physical altercations between the migrants and the [MISC Italian  ] crew that ended with the [MISC Italians  ] beating some [MISC Africans  ] with plastic and metal batons , leaving at least six injured . 
Migrants on the boat reportedly filmed the incident with their mobile phones , leading the [MISC Italian  ] crew to confiscate phones , documents , and personal belongings that have not yet been returned . 
3 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) The migrants were eventually delivered to an oil platform ( operated by [ORG ENI  ] ) off the coast of [LOC Libya  ] on or around July 2 , from which point they were delivered to [LOC Libya  ] 's [LOC Zawiya  ] detention center . 
After two days of asking for access , [ORG UNHCR  ] was allowed to visit [LOC Zawiya  ] detention center ( approximately 25 miles west of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) to visit 13 women and children from the group . 
One pregnant woman was in urgent need of medical care . 
Two days later , [ORG UNHCR  ] was granted access to the men in [LOC Zwara  ] detention center ( approximately 80 miles west of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) , where they interviewed migrants with fresh stitches on their heads and faces who recounted the events surrounding their forced return to [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] then submitted these claims to the [ORG GOI  ] in [LOC Rome  ] and has not yet received a response . 
4 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) [PER Al-Wash  ] alleged that the [MISC Italian  ] government was intentionally stonewalling the [ORG UN  ] . 
According to al-Wash , [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador [PER Francesco Trupiano  ] refuses to meet with [ORG UNHCR  ] and told al-Wash that he was a " troublemaker . 
" [PER Al-Wash  ] believed that that [PER Trupiano  ] was single-mindedly focused on returning migrants to [LOC Libya  ] and claimed to be unaware that [LOC Rome  ] had agreed in principle to accept 63 refugees for resettlement from [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] has also submitted to the [ORG GOI  ] a list of 93 refugees that have been returned since [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Libya  ] began joint patrols in May . 
According to al-Wash , [LOC Rome  ] agreed to accept " 20 or 30 " of the 93 refugees , provided [ORG EU  ] states committed to a burden-sharing agreement , though states did not seem eager to undertake one . 
[PER Al-Wash  ] was hopeful the [ORG EC  ] would intercede to bring [LOC Italy  ] in line , citing the [ORG EC  ] 's inclusion of [LOC Libya  ] signing an [ORG MOU  ] with [ORG UNHCR  ] as part of its requirements for a [ORG Framework Agreement  ] ( ref A ) and a recent letter from the [ORG Commission  ] to the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000637 002.2 OF 002 [MISC Italian  ] [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , reminding it of its obligations under the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Human Rights Charter  ] . 
REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT: [ORG UNHCR  ] PLANNING FOR IN-COUNTY PROCESSING 5 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Wash  ] reported that the [LOC Tripoli  ] office was shifting its focus to beginning refugee resettlement to the [LOC U.S.  ] via the standard processing route , i.e. pre-processing by [ORG IOM Cairo  ] before in-country DHS interviews . 
[PER Al-Wash  ] said he had already been in touch with [ORG IOM Cairo  ] , which will send a team of five [MISC Egyptian  ] officers to [LOC Tripoli  ] in early October to begin screening the first tranche of refugees . 
Since early June , [ORG UNHCR  ] [LOC Tripoli  ] has submitted over 80 cases to the regional hub in [LOC Beirut  ] with an eye toward resettlement in the [LOC U.S.  ] in early 2010 . 
He said they were continuing to locate and identify new cases each day in the hopes that they could have all 120 cases allotted by the [ORG USG  ] ( ref b ) ready for screening this fall . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Wash  ] noted , however , that the change in tack would not be without challenges . 
He highlighted that there were no official interpreters for [LOC Tigrinya  ] or [LOC Afar  ] in [LOC Libya  ] , necessitating the use of informal translators from the community . 
Those community members would need to be trained and made to sign codes of conduct regarding confidentiality and accuracy . 
With only three weeks remaining before a month-long break for [PER Ramadan  ] , al-Wash is eager to finalize plans with the regional [ORG OPE  ] to prevent last-minute surprises . 
Without a functioning [ORG International Committee  ] of the [ORG Red Cross  ] office in [LOC Libya  ] , [ORG UNHCR  ] would also need to obtain travel documents from [LOC Tunis  ] , adding both time and complication to the resettlement process . 
7 . 
( C ) On a more positive note , al-Wash said several [MISC Eritrean  ] refugees slated for resettlement in the [LOC U.S.  ] had been released from detention in [LOC Misrata  ] ( approximately 125 miles east of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) and were now located in [LOC Tripoli  ] , making both prescreening and eventual DHS interviews significantly less complicated . 
[ORG Poloff  ] stressed that continuing those efforts would be key as DHS would not be able to interview refugees in detention during the scheduled visit December 6-22 . 
While al-Wash was hopeful that recent developments would make in-country processing possible , he asked that the [ORG USG  ] remain open to processing migrants via [LOC Romania  ] or a new facility in [LOC Eastern Europe  ] . 
Anticipating that last-minute surprises could derail efforts to resettle to the [LOC U.S.  ] via in-country processing , al-Wash sought guidance as to whether refugees pre-screened by [ORG IOM Cairo  ] would be forced to begin the process anew were they to be subsequently transferred to [LOC Romania  ] , or whether DHS would be able to conduct their screening there more quickly due to the in-country pre-screen . 
8 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) Comment: Stemming the flow of migrants to [LOC Italy  ] was a key component of the [MISC Italian-Libyan  ] " Friendship [MISC Treaty  ] " signed last August . 
In recent G-8 coordination meetings with the [ORG UN  ] , [MISC Italian  ] diplomats boasted that they had finally gotten [LOC Libya  ] to fulfill that obligation ; this incident seems to indicate the [LOC Italy  ] may be pushing [LOC Libya  ] to do so at the expense of both countries' obligations regarding the protection of [MISC UN-protected  ] asylum seekers . 
[LOC Libya  ] appears to be caught between two strong desires: to reduce the strain that foreign migrants and refugees cause on its prison and security systems , while at the same time seeking to improve relations with [LOC Italy  ] . 
Both of these pressures - internal and external - may ultimately create a political opening for [LOC Libya  ] to regularize the processing of [MISC UNHCR-recognized  ] refugees and accept refugee resettlement to the [LOC United States  ] .
