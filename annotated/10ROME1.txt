C ) Summary: The Ambassador visited recuperating Prime Minister [PER Silvio Berlusconi  ] at his [LOC Lombardy  ] estate for a private luncheon December 30 . 
The Ambassador had suggested he visit [PER Berlusconi  ] after the Prime Minister was assaulted at a [LOC Milan  ] rally in mid-December . 
Accompanied by [PER Gianni Letta  ] , the Undersecretary in the Prime Minister’s office and effectively [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] second in command , Ambassador flew up for the meeting on the Prime Minister’s plane . 
Bandaged and bruised from the December attack , [PER Berlusconi  ] was nonetheless upbeat and eager to show off his new project for training [MISC Italy’s  ] elite and share his thoughts on [MISC European  ] leaders and domestic politics . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] was effusive about [MISC U.S.-Italian  ] relations and [PER Letta  ] promised action on roping in [ORG ENI  ] operations in [LOC Iran  ] and pushing ahead on Megaports . 
End Summary The Recuperating Prime Minister ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
C ) Following the Ambassador’s call to [PER Gianni Letta  ] suggesting the Ambassador visit the Prime Minister during his recuperation , [PER Letta  ] , the Undersecretary in the Prime Minister’s Office , invited Ambassador [PER Thorne  ] to accompanied him to [LOC Milan  ] on December 30 for a private afternoon with the [ORG Prime Minister  ] . 
The three hour session , held in [MISC Italian  ] , involved only the [ORG Prime Minister  ] , [PER Letta  ] and the Ambassador , and included a visit to [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] latest endeavor , a private training school for [MISC Italy’s  ] elite , and a wide-ranging lunch with the two top decision makers in the [MISC Italian  ] government. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] was still bandaged and scarred from the assault in early December where a mentally unstable man hurled a die cast model of [MISC Milan’s  ] cathedral at his head . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] noted that the missile had struck a glancing blow to his cheek , cutting him , breaking his nose and some of his teeth , but if it had hit him straight on “it would have killed” him . 
[PER Letta  ] recounted separately that [PER Berlusconi  ] had slumped into a depression following the attack - “he’s an impresario , he wants everyone to love him “ - but that had snapped out of it and was on the mend . 
[PER Letta  ] also noted that their tour of [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] new project site was the Prime Minister’s first excursion outdoors since his release from the hospital . 
[MISC U.S.-Italy:  ] A Prized Relationship --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
C ) In luncheon discussions , [PER Berlusconi  ] unabashedly stated that he prized [MISC Italy’s  ] relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] and that his government stood ready to help us , whatever the issue . 
He noted that [LOC Italy  ] owed the [LOC United States  ] a debt of gratitude for salvation during [MISC World War II  ] , and for protection throughout the [MISC Cold War  ] . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , basing issues , and other tough problems , [LOC Italy  ] was committed to helping the [LOC U.S.  ] get to the right solution . 
He noted that he hoped that the [MISC Italian  ] increase in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would help President [PER Obama  ] and address the situation on the ground . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] on [MISC European  ] Leaders ------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
C ) The Prime Minister and [PER Letta  ] also gave their run down of current [MISC European  ] political leadership . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] assessed that Sarkozy’s star was clearly waning in [MISC European  ] circles and that the [MISC French  ] President did not command the same influence he did a year ago . 
[PER Letta  ] was less convinced , noting to the Ambassador that both [PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] were “big dogs angling for the same spotlight.” [PER Berlusconi  ] recounted how he had played an instrumental role in the Spring in persuading a reluctant [MISC Erdogan  ] to accept [MISC Danish  ] PM [PER Rasmussen  ] as the new [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General , overcoming the [MISC Turkish President’s  ] profound irritation at [PER Rasmussen  ] for not silencing [MISC Kurdish  ] language radio stations despite numerous requests . 
On [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Berlusconi  ] felt that [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] got along well , respected each other , and had an effective relationship . 
In fact , farewells after lunch were unexpectedly cut short by an incoming call from [PER Putin  ] . 
[PER Iran: Appalled  ] by violence , Will try to rope in [ORG ENI  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
C ) On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Berlusconi  ] noted that he was appalled by the [MISC Iranian  ] crackdown . 
He offered the capabilities of the [MISC Italian  ] intelligence services and assured full sharing of information gathered on the internal dynamics in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
[PER Letta  ] , as the supervising authority over [MISC Italy’s  ] intelligence services , assured the Ambassador of a continuation of our [LOC ROME  ] 00000001 002.2 OF 003 already excellent bilateral cooperation on the issue . 
[PER Letta  ] also promised that he would talk to [ORG ENI  ] CEO [PER Scaroni  ] about the energy giant’s ongoing operations in [LOC Iran  ] and , if he could , persuade them to halt activities . 
Megaports - GOI to determine [ORG POC  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
C ) In response to the [LOC U.S.  ] request to move forward on Megaports , [PER Letta  ] told the Ambassador that the issue would be discussed at the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] meeting on January 8 and that they would be in contact soon thereafter to convey which ministry would have lead in the GOI for implementing the project and as such be the primary interlocutor for our Embassy . 
[ORG Italy’s Courts  ] - Problem [MISC Number One  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] forthrightly identified the magistratura - [MISC Italy’s  ] judiciary and courts -- as [MISC Italy’s  ] “biggest problem” and told the Ambassador that he was ready to forge an alliance with the center left opposition to implement judicial reform . 
He noted that a legal system where issues were never definitively resolved -- where you can be absolved of a crime and yet have the case resurrected later - sapped [MISC Italy’s  ] political and economic system . 
He argued that this is what has happened in his own case , where he has been cleared in the past but the same charges keep on returning repeatedly . 
He said that he had allies in the opposition on the need for reform , including [ORG PD Leader  ] [PER Bersani  ] . 
[PER Letta  ] cautioned the government won’t know if it has the clout to deliver on such an idea unless it secures a decent showing in regional elections in March 2010 . 
[ORG Smart Guys  ] in the Opposition ---------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Letta  ] displayed a great deal of respect for opposition leaders . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] praised the [ORG Democratic Party Leader  ] , [PER Pier Luigi Bersani  ] as a “straight shooter” who was fair with a top rate intellect . 
Separately [PER Letta  ] was also complimentary about former Prime Minister ( and archrival ) [PER Massimo D’Alema  ] who he credited with showing courage and integrity during the [LOC Balkans  ] crisis and taking some very tough decisions . 
[PER Letta  ] noted that D’Alema’s prickliness and “smartest guy in the room” demeanor made dealing with him a chore , but acknowledged his judgment and political effectiveness , which was why [PER Berlusconi  ] backed him for the EU Foreign Minister position despite their differences . 
[PER Letta  ] told the Ambassador that he did not have a clear judgment on how [PER DiPietro  ] will play in domestic politics and looked forward to future conversations . 
On other domestic political issues , [PER Letta  ] thought that the current estrangement between the governing [ORG PDL  ] party and [MISC Sicilian  ] President [PER Lombardo  ] was a minor issue and they would patch it up quickly . 
Worried about a flat 2010 ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
C ) Both [PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Letta  ] expressed concern about the limited prospects for economic growth in 2010 . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] thought that [LOC Italy  ] had weathered the past year of the financial crisis fairly well but thought it would be a challenge to produce enough growth in 2010 to start replacing jobs lost . 
The Prime Minister was less concerned that a financial meltdown in [LOC Greece  ] would have [MISC EU-wide  ] impact . 
He said that he had a good relationship with [MISC Greek  ] PM Papendreou and was confident that he could right the situation . 
New Media - Important for Liberty --------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
C ) In response to the Ambassador’s questions to the Prime Minister about the role of the internet , [PER Berlusconi  ] shot back “it’s important for liberty.” New media - particularly [ORG Facebook  ] which has been instrumental in the past month in organizing a national “No [PER Berlusconi  ] Day” and more controversially in continuing to host “Kill [MISC Berlusconi”  ] pages - has vexed the GOI , - but the Prime Minister stated that he felt the evolving media was both critical to the future and also to the preservation of liberty . 
But he felt there needed to be better tuned controls to prevent the most extreme use of the new outlets . 
The [ORG Berlusconi Leadership Academy  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
C ) The Prime Minister commenced the visit by personally [LOC ROME  ] 00000001 003.2 OF 003 conducting a guided tour of his most recent project , a private academy to train [MISC Italy’s  ] brightest young minds . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] led [PER Letta  ] and the Ambassador on a personal tour of a newly rehabbed [LOC Lombardy  ] estate that will serve as the home of the enterprise . 
The completely renovated 17th century country mansion , [PER Villa Gernetto  ] , will house a special school set to open in March for one hundred of [MISC Italy’s  ] most talented young leaders , completely funded from [LOC Berlusconi’s  ] personal fortune . 
The Prime Minister intends to choose the students himself and he envisions an environment where [MISC Italy’s  ] best and brightest live and study , taught by world leaders “like [PER Blair  ] and [ORG Clinton.” Comment  ] ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
C ) The Ambassador’s intimate afternoon with [MISC Italy’s  ] two top decision makers was both a testament to the priority [PER Berlusconi  ] gives the [MISC U.S.-Italy  ] relationship but also perhaps a sign that the GOI has achieved its long-sought level comfort and ease with the [PER Obama  ] administration . 
It is also a dividend of the Ambassador’s cultivation of the relationship with [PER Letta  ] , which has opened up a personal channel to the Prime Minister . 
The [MISC Italian  ] press coverage of the following day clearly took this message from what they viewed as an extraordinary private session . 
The Prime Minister was clear that he expects to be called upon to deliver for the [LOC U.S.  ] , which he will do out of principle , not self-interest . 
Despite being given numerous openings , neither the Prime Minister nor [PER Letta  ] asked for anything from the [LOC U.S.  ] during the lengthy luncheon . 
A striking aspect of the session was Letta’s clear position as co-regent , with [PER Berlusconi  ] deferring regularly to his colleague and with [PER Letta  ] airing opposing points of view to his boss during the luncheon .
