REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Introduction . 
Reftel discussed Mission , s views that , despite interesting media reports that President [PER Lula da Silva  ] , s foreign policy in a second term could shift toward closer ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] , we could not see yet concrete evidence of such a trend . 
We remain circumspect on this question . 
At the same time , candid and encouraging conversations with top [ORG GOB  ] officials on the day after [PER Lula  ] , s strong victory at the polls left Ambassador and emboffs wondering about the possibility that some change may be brewing . 
We report what we heard below , with the caveat that we remain in a cautious " wait and see mode " for the time being . 
End introduction. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador and PolCouns visited the [LOC Planalto Palace  ] on 30 October , and found a Presidency in an open mood of jubilant celebration . 
A steady column of [ORG VIPs  ] streamed through for audiences with re-elected President [PER Lula  ] . 
A relieved and buoyant [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] , Chief of [PER Lula  ] , s Personal Staff , received Ambassador and poloff for a courtesy call , which turned into a compelling conversation about the direction of policy in [PER Lula  ] , s second term . 
[PER Carvalho  ] , who is perhaps [PER Lula  ] , s closest long-time advisor , made the following comments: --On foreign policy , [PER Carvalho  ] said that [PER Lula  ] , s first term had seen a broad opening of [LOC Brazil  ] to new alliances and diplomatic arrangements worldwide . 
Now , with this base established , the second [PER Lula  ] government will re-focus priority on " quality relationships with traditional partners . 
" Specifically , for [LOC Brazil  ] to grow with new investment , the [ORG GOB  ] will need to engage more intensively with the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Carvalho  ] stressed. --Ambassador welcomed this observation , but said he remained concerned when he heard certain [MISC Brazilian  ] officials speak of the need to " counterbalance " against the [LOC U.S.  ] , and opined that two democracies should be able to debate and work together directly , without such contrivances . 
[PER Carvalho  ] was emphatic in agreeing , said there will be no further discussion of counterbalances , and asked for the Ambassador , s understanding if rhetoric during the election campaign had occasionally seemed critical of the [LOC U.S.  ] He again assured Ambassador that the second [PER Lula  ] government wants investment and growth , and sees relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] as central to this. --At the conclusion of the meeting , [PER Carvalho  ] provided his private telephone numbers to Ambassador and PolCouns and encouraged them to contact him directly at any time if there was problematic development in relations between the two governments , of if they wished to present an issue directly to President [PER Lula  ] . 
[PER Carvalho  ] said he would welcome this direct channel with the Ambassador. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a separate meeting at [LOC Planalto  ] with General [PER Jorge Armando Felix  ] , [PER Lula  ] , s Minister for [ORG Institutional Security  ] , Ambassador , PolCouns and [ORG Regional Affairs  ] Chief raised the subject of intensified [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] exchanges and cooperation in intelligence and security . 
Ambassador noted that President [PER Lula  ] , in a brief aside at the [LOC UNGA  ] in [LOC New York  ] , had encouraged continued engagement with General [PER Felix  ] , presumably on such issues . 
General [PER Felix  ] then announced that he had , subsequent to an earlier meeting with Ambassador , commissioned a formal paper outlining specific areas for consultation and collaboration at the policy level with the [ORG USG  ] in the intelligence field . 
Ambassador and [PER Felix  ] agreed [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002293 002 OF 002 that the [ORG GOB  ] could also specify in the paper specific equipment or training they might require , and decided to plan together for a high-level bilateral intelligence meeting early in 2007 in [LOC Brasilia.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In an earlier conversation on the same day , [ORG Development and Industry  ] Minister [PER Luiz Furlan  ] told Ambassador that [PER Lula  ] was pressing him to stay on in a second government , and [PER Furlan  ] appeared to be considering this option . 
[PER Furlan  ] , a moderate with a business background who has long pressed within [PER Lula  ] , s cabinet for closer cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] , seemed to be of the view that [PER Lula  ] , s second term priorities would be shifting in the direction of closer engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other developed nations. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment . 
Our senior interlocutors were in high spirits yesterday , with a kind word for the world , including the [LOC U.S.  ] But without major changes in the foreign ministry 's senior staffing and orientation , we wonder about the viability of a tilt toward the [LOC U.S.  ] and developing world , and away from the south-south priorities of the first [PER Lula  ] term . 
Nonetheless , it is intriguing that we have received such a steady stream of strong signals from senior [PER Lula  ] advisors on the day after his victory . 
Watch this space .
