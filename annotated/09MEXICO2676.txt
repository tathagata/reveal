Reason: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( c ) Summary: DATT , ODC Chief , [ORG DOJ Attache  ] and [PER Pol MinCouns  ] met with officials from the [ORG National Defense Secretariat  ] ( [ORG SEDENA  ] ) on September 7 to discuss initiating a human rights dialogue with the [MISC Mexican  ] military that would allow us to understand the legal process in the [MISC Mexican  ] system of military justice and clarify specific questions with regards to alleged violations . 
General [PER Lopez Portillo  ] , the [ORG Senior Human Rights  ] official in [ORG SEDENA  ] and a veteran military prosecutor , was the lead official on the [MISC Mexican  ] side , accompanied by a Director General level representative from the [MISC Mexican  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG SRE  ] ) . 
They welcomed the beginning of a dialogue with the Embassy on human rights matters and proposed regular senior formal meetings ( he suggested 2-3 a year ) as well as working level discussions to clarify specific cases . 
( A list of all participants is provided in para 7 ) . --------------------------------------------- Willing to Talk but a Dialogue Will Take Work --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( c ) Although we previously had provided a list of specific questions on several cases involving alleged human rights violations through official [ORG SEDENA  ] and [ORG SRE  ] channels , and our meeting had been coordinated a month in advance through the [ORG SEDENA  ] Protocol office ( S2 ) , [PER Lopez Portillo  ] did not receive our questions before the meeting . 
This was not an indication of [ORG SEDENA  ] 's unwillingness to discuss the cases , but rather reflects a lack of experience in engaging on the human rights topic and their somewhat rigid rules for transmitting information to and within the [ORG SEDENA  ] bureaucracy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( c ) Unaware of the questions we had provided on allegations related to the specific cases , General [PER Lopez Portillo  ] organized a general and open agenda for the meeting , aimed at facilitating an open and frank discussion on internal legal and judicial procedures within the [MISC Mexican  ] military . 
Throughout the meeting , our [MISC Mexican  ] interlocutors were well-disposed to answering our questions and establishing a collaborative dialogue . 
We noted our interest in reviewing the details of some specific cases as part of an ongoing dialogue on human rights issues that would allow us to understand better how [ORG SEDENA  ] and the [MISC Mexican  ] legal system handled crimes involving military personnel and civilians . 
We provided a copy of the questions we had provided prior to the meeting and suggested a follow-up meeting to go over the cases in more detail. ------------------------------------ [ORG SEDENA  ] AND [ORG SRE  ] SUGGEST A WAY FORWARD ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( c ) [ORG SRE  ] Director General for [ORG Human Rights and Democracy  ] [PER Alejandro Negrin  ] agreed with [PER Lopez Portillo  ] that we should establish a formal and regular dialogue to discuss both the specific cases and larger framework of how the [MISC Mexican  ] judicial system works in response to crimes involving military personnel and civilians . 
He noted relevant legal reforms and the ongoing effort by [ORG SEDENA  ] to clarify its procedures and respond to responsible questions . 
[PER Lopez Portillo  ] noted [ORG SEDENA  ] 's interest in continuing to do more in this regard and was supportive of establishing a bi-lateral mechanism that would allow us to work together to help clarify allegations . 
He suggested formal senior level meetings several times a year , with working level meetings in between. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( c ) [PER Lopez Portillo  ] promised a timely written response to the written questions we had provided earlier . 
He also undertook to set up meetings to review military legal procedure , particularly with regard to crimes involving military and civilians . 
He suggested that we work closely and collaboratively to clarify procedures and outstanding allegations , many of which he observed , were designed to cast doubt and dispersion on the [MISC Mexican  ] military and not to establish the truth . 
Both sides agreed that new questions [LOC MEXICO  ] 00002676 002 OF 002 about additional cases in the future should be provided through [ORG SRE  ] channels with a courtesy copy given to [ORG SEDENA  ] . 
The official response to specific cases would be delivered from [ORG SEDENA  ] through the [ORG SRE  ] . 
[PER Lopez Portillo  ] said that he was eager to work together with us to ensure that there would be a satisfactory response on all human rights allegations. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( c ) Establishing a productive human rights dialogue with the [MISC Mexican  ] military will take some work and considerable fine tuning . 
This is not an area that the [MISC Mexican  ] military has traditionally discussed with any outsiders . 
While the [MISC Mexican  ] military has made some progress in establishing mechanisms to review human rights allegations in response to internal constitutional reforms and [LOC Mexico  ] 's international obligations , it is still a delicate subject and one they are likely to manage cautiously and not always adroitly . 
We are encouraged by our initial meeting but much remains to be done . 
We will follow up promptly with [ORG SEDENA  ] and [ORG SRE  ] to set up our next meeting . 
[PER Lopez Portillo  ] provided repeated assurances that [ORG SEDENA  ] is prepared to respond in writing -- supplemented by working level discussion to clarify any questions of procedure and translation -- to our questions on specific cases . 
We will also expand current training and subject matter expert exchanges that could help provide [ORG SEDENA  ] with support in their efforts to address human rights issues in a more comprehensive and transparent way. ------------ PARTICIPANTS ------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( c ) The [MISC Mexican  ] side was led by [ORG MG Jaime Lopez Portillo  ] and included [ORG Col. J.J. Juarez  ] , [ORG Section  ] 5 [ORG DH  ] , [ORG Ltc  ] [PER Marcas Burgos Legorretta  ] , [ORG Section  ] 5 [ORG DH  ] , Major [PER C.S. Lopez  ] , and [ORG Ltc A. Santos  ] , S-2 as well as [PER Alejandro Negrin  ] , the Director General of [ORG Human Rights and Democracy  ] in the [ORG SRE  ] .
