( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a December 9 meeting in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] ( other meetings reported septel ) , Deputy Secretary of Energy [PER Daniel Poneman  ] told [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Crown Prince [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Zayed  ] ( [PER MbZ  ] ) that the [ORG USG  ] shared many energy policy priorities with the [LOC UAE  ] , including renewable energy development and the importance of critical energy infrastructure protection . 
[PER Poneman  ] briefed [PER MbZ  ] on the [ORG Teheran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) proposal and [LOC Vienna  ] talks . 
[PER MbZ  ] said he would be surprised if [LOC Iran  ] accepted the [ORG P5+1/IAEA  ] proposal and warned that [LOC Iran  ] was already acting like a nuclear power . 
Further , and more dangerously , [LOC Iran  ] is establishing " emirates " across the [MISC Muslim  ] world , including [LOC South Lebanon  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] , sleeper " emirates " in [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Bahrain  ] , and the [ORG Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia  ] , the mother of all " emirates " in [LOC Southern Iraq  ] , and now [LOC Saada  ] in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] is misreading the situation in [LOC Yemen  ] and failing to recognize strong evidence of [MISC Iranian  ] support . 
End Summary . 
[ORG POTENTIAL COOPERATION: RENEWABLES  ] , INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Crown Prince asked DepSec [PER Poneman  ] several questions about [LOC U.S.  ] energy development plans , including the outlook for the next 25 years . 
[PER Poneman  ] explained President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Chu  ] have a strategic vision of a new energy economy with a low carbon profile . 
In the short term , [PER Poneman  ] said DOE is investing [ORG Recovery Act  ] funds to improve efficiency and support new technologies , but that the [ORG USG  ] seeks to facilitate energy development through a portfolio approach , not dictate what the market should pursue . 
On nuclear , [PER MbZ  ] specifically asked what progress could be expected within the next three years . 
[PER Poneman  ] said there are a number of active deals under development , and strong public support for nuclear power , but that capital costs continue to be a challenge . 
( Comment: [PER MbZ  ] pressed hard on [LOC US  ] plans for a nuclear renaissance , suggesting to us that he is worried we may compete with his program in the hunt for nuclear engineering and technical talent . 
End Comment . 
) Turning to renewable energy and efficiency , the DepSec noted that [ORG USG  ] goals are very much in line with [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] 's own [LOC Masdar  ] ( [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Future Energy Company ) and that he looked forward to greater [MISC DOE-Masdar  ] cooperation ( septel ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Poneman  ] also told [PER MbZ  ] that the [ORG USG  ] is interested in supporting [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] 's critical energy infrastructure protection ( [ORG CEIP  ] ) plans and said a [ORG DOE  ] team was discussing cooperation potential with the [ORG Critical National Infrastructure Authority  ] ( [ORG CNIA  ] , reported septel ) . 
Learning from Hurricane [MISC Katrina  ] , [ORG DOE  ] was focused on survivability of assets , resiliency and recovery . 
[PER MbZ  ] said he was personally very interested in greater cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [ORG CEIP  ] , through [ORG DOE  ] , other [ORG USG  ] entities and/or the private sector . 
He stressed that citizens' confidence in their government was very important , noting " We're doing our best to make them feel secure . 
" [PER MbZ  ] added that while [LOC UAE  ] is a small country , it has the resources to protect itself , and is willing to invest in top-quality infrastructure protection . 
[LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) DepSec [PER Poneman  ] briefed [PER MbZ  ] on the international proposal for [LOC Iran  ] to ship 1,200 kg of [ORG Low Enriched Uranium  ] produced at [LOC Natanz  ] to a location outside [LOC Iran  ] and where it would be enriched to 20 percent for use to produce medical radioisotopes at the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] . 
[PER Poneman  ] stressed that the [ORG IAEA  ] , the [MISC Russians  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] had all taken every possible step to address stated [MISC Iranian  ] concerns , including a first-ever official [ORG USG  ] statement of support for the proposal . 
He stressed that the offer would not remain open indefinitely ; as DG [PER El Baradei  ] had said , this is a " fleeting " opportunity . 
He also explained that the extra effort had strengthened international cooperation , with [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] supportive of the recent [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] resolution . 
[PER Poneman  ] stressed that the deal was not offered out of naivete , but rather out of the view that if [LOC Iran  ] agreed it would remove a significant amount of LEU from [LOC Natanz  ] and if [LOC Iran  ] refused it would help build international support - beginning with [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] - for tougher sanctions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Crown Prince said he would be " very surprised " if a deal was possible , as [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program is not an issue of internal conflict but rather one of national pride for the vast majority of [MISC Iranians  ] . 
He stressed that [LOC Iran  ] is not [LOC North Korea  ] , because 1 ) it is looking to reestablish a [MISC Persian  ] empire in the 21st century , 2 ) [LOC Iran  ] has resources and lacks neighbors , including the [LOC UAE  ] , who can pressure it , 3 ) the leadership has not changed ( it is the same people who seized Embassy [LOC Tehran  ] in 1979 ) , and 4 ) [LOC Iran  ] believes itself to be a superpower . 
[PER Poneman  ] said the [ORG USG  ] does not disagree with [PER MbZ  ] 's analysis , but believes pride makes the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership more susceptible to the pressure of the world community uniting against them , whereas [LOC North Korea  ] revels in its own isolation . 
[PER MbZ  ] agreed , and emphasized the strategic importance of creating a [LOC Palestinian State  ] ( i.e. , resolving the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict ) as the way to create genuine [MISC Middle Eastern  ] unity on the question of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and regional ambitions . 
[LOC YEMEN  ] ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MbZ  ] said [LOC Iran  ] already acts like a superpower and explained that , while the [LOC UAE  ] is a federation of emirates , [LOC Iran  ] 's " emirates " have a larger army and budget that the [LOC UAE  ] . 
In addition to [LOC Iran  ] 's established emirates in [LOC South Lebanon  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] , sleeper emirates in [LOC Kuwait  ] , [LOC Bahrain  ] , the [ORG Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia  ] , and the mother of all emirates in [LOC Southern Iraq  ] . 
Now [LOC Iran  ] has an emirate in [LOC Saada  ] . 
[PER MbZ  ] told [PER Poneman  ] , " We believe you don't want us to believe " the mounting evidence of [MISC Iranian  ] involvement in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
He stressed that he doesn't believe [PER Ali Abdullah Saleh  ] either , but this is " not like cracking the enigma code " ( in [MISC World War II  ] ) , there are [MISC Iranian  ] ships unloading weapons for the [MISC Houthis  ] , and " you have the capability to track this . 
" He warned , " We know your priority is [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] , but don't forget [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Al-Qaeda  ] is not going to get a nuclear bomb ; [LOC Iran  ] is a matter of time . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) DepSec [PER Poneman  ] has cleared this cable .
