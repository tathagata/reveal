( C ) Poloff met with incoming [ORG Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) [MISC North Africa Director  ] [PER Philippa Saunders  ] on February 23 . 
During a conversation that focused almost entirely on [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Saunders  ] explained that fear over how [LOC Tripoli  ] will handle Megrahi’s eventual funeral remains a major concern and one that [ORG HMG  ] continues to raise regularly . 
Under the direction of [ORG FCO  ] MENA Director [PER Christian Turner  ] the [ORG UK Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] is currently engaged in an effort to identify all possible [LOC UK  ] &levers of influence8 with [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Unfortunately , &there aren , t too many , 8 although she mentioned [PER Tony Blair  ] and a private doctor who has a personal relationship with the [MISC Gaddafi  ] family . 
The effort partially originated from the assumption that there will be &maybe a 48-hour window if we , re lucky8 between [PER Megrahi  ] , s eventual death and a funeral and the [ORG FCO  ] wants to ensure [ORG HMG  ] is in a position to act quickly. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Saunders  ] noted that there is “very little political appetite” for engaging with [LOC Libya  ] at the moment , further contributing to the sense of being in a holding pattern . 
She noted that she and the new [LOC UK  ] Ambassador designate , along with [ORG UK Embassy Tripoli  ] , would be working on developing a new [LOC Libya  ] strategy which she predicted would be ready to share with a possible new government following the upcoming [ORG UK General  ] elections ( expected May 6 ) . 
[PER Saunders  ] predicted the strategy would likely present a spectrum of engagement possibilities and the various threats associated with each. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Saunders  ] , who has only been in her position for a few weeks , said that [LOC Libya  ] has taken , and she believes will continue to take , the majority of her time . 
Summing up the relationship , she described it as being “in limbo” and “lacking clarity” on several fronts . 
She lamented that the [MISC Swiss  ] visa crisis ( reftel ) was taking most their embassy’s time , quickly adding her belief that the [ORG UK Embassy  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] was closely engaged with our [ORG Embassy  ] on the issue. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .
