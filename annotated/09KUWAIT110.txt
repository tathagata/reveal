( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] During a February 3 meeting in their ongoing dialog on US-Kuwait CT cooperation , [MISC Kuwaiti  ] Minister of Interior [PER Shaykh Jaber  ] al-Khalid [PER Al Sabah  ] discussed with Ambassador [LOC US  ] and [MISC Kuwaiti  ] efforts to locate and apprehend terror financiers ( including [PER Mohammed Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Al-Ali  ] , aka [PER Jawad/Abu Umar  ] ) , applauded improved liaison information exchange , expressed skepticism [LOC Kuwait  ] would ever develop a rehabilitation center for former [ORG GTMO  ] detainees and other extremists supporting jihad , and suggested the [LOC US  ] should release current [ORG GTMO  ] detainees back into [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where they could be killed in combat . 
He sardonically questioned why [LOC US  ] NAVCENT forces had gone to the trouble of rescuing foundering [MISC Iranian  ] hashish smugglers two weeks earlier , saying " [PER God  ] meant to punish them with death and you saved them . 
Why ? 
" Characterizing the previous Saturday 's provincial elections as a " huge success , " [ORG Shaykh Jaber  ] expressed his belief that President [PER Obama  ] and the [LOC US  ] had the tools necessary to successfully confront all challenges . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador called on [ORG Shaykh Jaber  ] February 3 to review progress on our CT liaison relationship and to seek the Interior Minister 's support for operational concepts aimed at intercepting individuals involved in the exploitation of traditional smuggling routes in the northern [LOC Gulf  ] to move would-be jihadists and their financier/facilitators between [LOC Kuwait  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG Shaykh Jaber  ] began the meeting by applauding the " huge success " of the provincial elections in [LOC Iraq  ] and expressing his confidence in the ability of President [PER Obama  ] and the " super power " [LOC US  ] to address current challenges. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador noted she 'd met recently with [PER VADM McCraven  ] , now [ORG JSOC  ] commander for this region , and that they 'd discussed alternative approaches to staunching the flows of terror financing , given the constraints of [LOC Kuwait  ] 's current legal and political systems . 
Offering his support for these approaches ) and underscoring that he was as concerned about terrorist influences from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] as from [LOC Iran  ] , given the loose border controls -- the Minister expressed his understanding of what he characterized ( fairly ) as improved information exchange between our services , while acknowledging the ongoing deficiencies in [LOC Kuwait  ] 's legal system that stymie effective prosecution and restraint of these individuals once captured. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador noted recent press reports that self-confessed jihadi recruiter and financier [PER Mohammed al-Bathali  ] had been released on a 500 dinar bond after being sentenced to three of a possible five years imprisonment for " inciting jihad against a friendly state . 
" ( Reftel ) At the same time , [LOC Kuwait  ] 's Ambassador to the [LOC US  ] , [ORG Shaykh Salem Al Sabah  ] , had approached S/WCI Ambassador [PER Clint Williamson  ] to inquire after the status of [LOC Kuwait  ] 's four remaining [ORG GTMO  ] detainees . 
Ambassador clarified that President [PER Obama  ] 's announcement of our determination to close the detention center at [LOC Guantanamo  ] did not mean we no longer had security concerns which would be factored into any release scenarios ; the [MISC Kuwaiti  ] detainees were nasty , unrepentant individuals and [LOC Kuwait  ] 's record had been tarnished by the example of former [ORG GTMO  ] detainee al-Ajmi , who 'd allegedly blown himself up in [LOC Mosul  ] following his release to the [MISC Kuwaiti  ] authorities . 
Ambassador asked the Interior Minister the status of the rehabilitation center Prime Minister [PER Shaykh Nasser Mohammed Al Sabah  ] had mentioned in his September 18th conversation with then-Secretary [ORG Rice  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Ambassador noted that we were aware of the stories of [MISC Saudis  ] who 'd gone through SAG rehabilitation centers only to re-emerge with [PER Al Qaeda  ] in [LOC Yemen  ] ; nonetheless , the [ORG GOK  ] had to take steps to show its seriousness in changing and controlling the behaviors of extremists within its society. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Shaykh Jaber  ] replied with an anecdote: Following the 1990 invasion of [LOC Kuwait  ] and [LOC Desert Storm  ] , General [PER Schwarzkopf  ] had raised the issue of " rehabilitating " [MISC Kuwaitis  ] who 'd been exposed to the brutality of war so that they could re-integrate into society . 
[PER Shaykh  ] ( Ret , d General ) [ORG Jaber  ] had replied: " But you are thinking of the [LOC Vietnam  ] model , where young war veterans came home to empty apartments or anonymous urban environments . 
That is not who we are . 
We are a small , close-knit society and everyone knows each other . 
No one will feel alienated: those who can heal will heal naturally with family ; those who cannot heal in that environment will never heal . 
" Relating this to the current topic , [ORG Shaykh KUWAIT  ] 00000110 002 OF 002 [ORG Jaber  ] told the [MISC Ambassador:  ] " You know better than I that we cannot deal with these people ( i.e. the [ORG GTMO  ] detainees ) . 
I can't detain them . 
If I take their passports , they will sue to get them back ( [MISC Note:  ] as happened with [MISC Al-Ajmi  ] . 
End note . 
) I can talk to you into next week about building a rehabilitation center , but it won't happen . 
We are not [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] ; we cannot isolate these people in desert camps or somewhere on an island . 
We cannot compel them to stay . 
If they are rotten , they are rotten and the best thing to do is get rid of them . 
You picked them up in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; you should drop them off in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , in the middle of the war zone . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Ambassador then raised with the Minister developing an SOP for dealing with incidents such as the recent rescue by [LOC US  ] NAVCENT forces in the northern [LOC Gulf  ] of seven [MISC Iranian  ] smugglers whose boat was foundering while engaged in smuggling hashish . 
In the event , the [MISC Omanis  ] had agreed to repatriate the [MISC Iranians  ] but we nonetheless needed to think about dealing with similar episodes in future in expeditious fashion . 
The initial response of the [ORG Kuwaiti Coast Guard  ] had been to refer the matter to the Minister of Interior , via the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] . 
The Ambassador noted our supposition that the [ORG Kuwaiti Coast Guard  ] must have had similar experiences with [MISC Iranian  ] smugglers who needed repatriation to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Smiling broadly , the Interior Minister deflected the question , saying " [PER God  ] wished to punish them for smuggling drugs by drowning them , and then you saved them . 
So they're your problem ! 
You should have let them drown . 
" In any case , he added , the [MISC Kuwaitis  ] generally sent the [MISC Iranians  ] back to [LOC Iran  ] in their own boats so there had not been a question of physically handing them over. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In closing , Ambassador noted that the Minister had created the position of [ORG Special Advisor  ] to [ORG Shaykh Jaber  ] for [ORG Kuwait Security Services  ] ( our GRPO liaison counterpart ) and assigned [PER Shaykh Salman Sabah  ] al-Salem al-Humoud [PER Al Sabah  ] to that role . 
Ambassador asked whether the Minister believed there was any appropriate liaison relationship between the Embassy and [PER Shaykh Salman  ] , to which the Minister replied in the negative . 
Finally , the Ambassador invited the Minister to join her in attending the [LOC US  ] Ambassador 's reception February 24 at the [MISC IDEX  ] event in [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , as part of our efforts to boost the relationship. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The Minister was as frank and pessimistic as ever when it came to the subject of apprehending and detaining terror financiers and facilitators under [LOC Kuwait  ] 's current legal and political framework . 
Ongoing tensions between parliament and the PM and his cabinet make any changes highly unlikely any time soon . 
The remaining [ORG GTMO  ] detainees remain a particularly thorny issue for the leadership here , who privately recognize the downsides of taking custody and readily acknowledge their inability to manage them but who remain under strong domestic political pressure to " bring their boys home . 
" Telling was the fact that press accounts of the Ambassador 's February 3 meeting with the Minister ( which was one-on-one with a notetaker ) and her meeting two days earlier with the [ORG MFA U/S  ] focused solely on the [ORG GTMO  ] issue , although it was discussed only marginally .
