THE HAGUE 1766 Classified By: AMBASSADOR [PER ROLAND ARNALL  ] FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B/D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] is confident his [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) will do better than originally expected in the upcoming November elections , possibly even beating Labor ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) to remain the largest party in Parliament . 
[PER Balkenende  ] welcomed the adoption of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1701 on [LOC Lebanon  ] , but was noncommittal on a possible [MISC Dutch  ] contribution to a peacekeeping force . 
On [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Balkenende  ] stressed that [MISC Dutch  ] remain concerned about [PER Chavez'  ] ambitions but feel they must take a " " subtle " " approach to dealing with him . 
The Prime Minister remains committed to the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) project but wants to avoid handing an election issue to the opposition . 
Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] briefed [PER Balkenende  ] on upcoming [ORG Embassy  ] plans to promote diversity and [MISC Muslim  ] outreach and received an enthusiastic response . 
END SUMMARY . 
DOMESTIC POLITICS: [ORG CDA  ] ON THE REBOUND: --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a 45 minute tour d'horizon meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] on August 14 , an obviously well-rested Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] expressed cautious optimism about the [PER Christian Democrats'  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) prospects for November 's parliamentary elections . 
He noted that the gap between [ORG CDA  ] and the leading opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) had narrowed dramatically since the local elections last March , when polls showed [ORG PvdA  ] leading by 30 seats ; today , only a few seats ( 4-5 ) separated the two parties . 
[PER Balkenende  ] credited the shift primarily to the strong performance of the [MISC Dutch  ] economy -- which , he said , vindicated the government 's tough reform policies -- but said that [ORG PvdA  ] leader [PER Wouter Bos'  ] missteps on pension reform and other issues were also contributory factors . 
[PER Balkenende  ] made clear that the [ORG CDA  ] intended to campaign vigorously on his government 's record in upcoming months . 
LEBANON: [MISC DUTCH  ] STILL CAUTIOUS ON PEACEKEEPING ROLE: --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Turning to the [LOC Middle East  ] , Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] thanked the [MISC Dutch  ] for their strong demonstration of support for [ORG UNSCR  ] 1701 ( reftel ) and generally responsible approach to the conflict . 
[PER Balkenende  ] reiterated [MISC Dutch  ] support for the resolution , but stressed that implementation on the ground could be difficult . 
In response to the Ambassador 's query , [PER Balkenende  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] " " did not rule out " " participating in the anticipated peacekeeping force in some way at some point in the future , but argued that taking on a new military role would be extremely difficult at this time . 
[MISC Dutch  ] forces , he noted , are currently deployed in [LOC Africa  ] , the [LOC Balkans  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] ( via [MISC NTM-I  ] ) , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Adding a new mission during an election year may be too much to ask . 
Echoing a familiar [MISC Dutch  ] theme , [PER Balkenende  ] added that the anticipated deployment provided a good opportunity for " " other allies " " who are not as stretched to shoulder greater international responsibilities . 
VENEZUELA: " " [MISC SUBTLE  ] " " APPROACH NEEDED: ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Noting recent [MISC Dutch  ] mixed signals regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] 's bid for a [ORG UN Security Council Seat  ] ( ref b ) , Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] pushed for a clear sign of support for [LOC Guatemala  ] . 
[PER Balkenende  ] responded that the issue was being reviewed by the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] . 
He stressed , however , that the [ORG GONL  ] remained deeply concerned by [PER Chavez'  ] " " meddling " " in the [MISC Dutch  ] Antilles and elsewhere . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] agreed completely on the need to restrain [PER Chavez'  ] ambitions , they had no interest in needlessly provoking a large and powerful neighbor . 
For that reason , [PER Balkenende  ] argued that the [MISC Dutch  ] had no choice but to deal " " subtly " " with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] threat . 
[ORG JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER:  ] POLITICAL HOT POTATO: -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] briefed [PER Balkenende  ] on the upcoming Parliamentary visit ( septel ) to the [LOC United States  ] to review the current state of play on the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) project . 
[PER Balkenende  ] said that his government remained committed to the project , but cautioned that it could become a difficult issue in an election year . 
While some senior [ORG PvdA  ] leaders , he noted , understood that the [ORG JSF  ] was " " the best plane for the best price , " " [PER Balkenende  ] worried that , in the THE HAGUE 00001782 002 OF 002 heat of an election campaign , more extreme elements would force the party to take a hard-line position -- one it would then not be able to change if/when the [ORG PvdA  ] came into government . 
[ORG MUSLIM OUTREACH/DIVERSITY DIALOGUE: DUTCH SOCIETY  ] CHANGING: --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] expressed strong interest in the [ORG Embassy  ] 's plans to host a " " [MISC Diversity Dialogue  ] " " conference bringing [MISC Dutch  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Muslim  ] communities together in November , as well as in its plans to host a follow-up conference on diversity in the workplace . 
He pointed out that during the [MISC Dutch  ] [LOC EU Presidency  ] in 2004 , he had personally promoted a [MISC European-wide  ] discussion of " " values and norms . 
" " Such issues were critical given the demographic and social changes occurring in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Balkenende  ] agreed with the Ambassador that providing real economic opportunities for immigrants was one of the most important steps in the integration process . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Recently returned from vacation -- during which [MISC Dutch  ] papers ran photos of him sunning on a [MISC Mediterranean  ] beach -- [PER Balkenende  ] appeared confident and relaxed throughout the meeting . 
The devastating results of the March local elections -- after which [PER Balkenende  ] 's personal polls reached historic lows -- and June 's government crisis are clearly behind him ; if anything , these events appear to have energized both [PER Balkenende  ] and the [ORG CDA  ] for the difficult fight ahead . 
While the [ORG CDA  ] still lags behind [ORG PvdA  ] in most polls , they are gaining ground and -- unlike the [ORG PvdA  ] -- can count on at least one other large party -- the [MISC Liberals  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) -- to help form a majority in Parliament and serve in a coalition government . 
The real campaigning will not begin in earnest for several weeks , but [PER Balkenende  ] appears not only up to the challenge , but positively eager to at last have an opportunity to get his message out to the public .
