( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) in [LOC Bavaria  ] has celebrated the outcome of the federal coalition negotiations , which awarded the party with three ministries and several state secretary positions .

Singling out newly sworn-in Defense Minister [PER zu Guttenberg  ] for praise , [PER Seehofer  ] expects him to compete successfully for world attention with new Foreign Minister and [ORG FDP  ] chairman [PER Westerwelle  ] . 
[PER Seehofer  ] has signaled that he expects to be working with the [ORG FDP  ] for a long time . 
End Summary . 
[ORG CSU  ] Thrilled with [ORG Coalition Negotiations Results  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) " We could not be more satisfied with the outcome , " [PER Michael Hohenberger  ] , a senior State Chancery contact told us October 28 , adding that " even with a better election result the [ORG CSU  ] could hardly have emerged stronger in the new cabinet . 
" Although some [MISC Bavarian  ] observers have deplored the fact that the [ORG CSU  ] lost ministerial posts in financial and economic affairs at the Federal level , all agree that having Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] as Defense Minister is a very positive development . 
A [ORG CSU  ] party senior advisor , [PER Christian Kattner  ] , told us privately on the same day that he could " understand Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] 's point in giving the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] at this difficult time to an experienced man like ( former Interior Minister ) [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] ( [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] ) [ORG CDU  ] ) rather than to a young man at the beginning of his political career . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kattner  ] insisted that the [ORG CSU  ] had left its mark with regard to substance . 
[PER M-P Seehofer  ] had promised tax cuts , which are now in the works , and aid measures for farmers , for which he obtained an agreement on public aid amounting to 700 million [MISC Euros  ] . 
The [ORG CDU/CSU  ] stood united in rejecting [ORG FDP  ] demands they considered too business friendly at the expense of social justice concerns , he said . 
[MISC Bavarian  ] Justice Minister [PER Merk  ] , who at the beginning of the coalition negotiations expressed concerns about [ORG FDP  ] " weaknesses " on internal security and counterterrorism , told the CG October 27 that " she was very comfortable with the results . 
" Strong [ORG CSU  ] [MISC Bavarian  ] [ORG Line-Up  ] in [LOC Berlin  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As for the [ORG Cabinet  ] , in addition to zu [PER Guttenberg  ] at Defense , there is [PER Peter Ramsauer  ] heading the [ORG Transportation Ministry  ] , where he will have national influence and a huge budget . 
[PER Ilse Aigner  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) remains Minister of Agriculture . 
Five of the the parliamentarian State Secretaries are [MISC Bavarian  ] , four from the [ORG CSU  ] r and one from the [ORG FDP  ] . 
This gives the [ORG CSU  ] and [LOC Bavaria  ] generally important influence at the sub-Cabinet level and sets up influential and direct [MISC Bavarian  ] connections between the [ORG Bundestag  ] and [ORG Cabinet  ] . 
In the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] , well-respected [PER Christian Schmidt  ] retained his position , as did [PER Gerd Mueller  ] in Agriculture . 
[PER Hartmut Koschyk  ] moves to the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] , providing the [ORG CSU  ] with important direct influence with Minister [PER Schaeuble  ] . 
The 35-year old [PER Andreas Scheuer  ] from [LOC Passau  ] will assist [PER Peter Ramsauer  ] at the [ORG Transportation Ministry  ] . 
The fifth [MISC Bavarian  ] is [PER Max Stadler  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , who will support [PER Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) at the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] . 
A well-respected lawyer from [LOC Passau  ] , [PER Stadler  ] is an excellent choice and a real legal expert with [MISC American  ] experience as a 1993 [MISC International Visitor Program  ] alumnus . 
[PER Seehofer  ] Expects [ORG Long-Term Cooperation  ] with [ORG FDP  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the [ORG CSU  ] party convention on October 26 , where the coalition agreement was approved , [PER MP Seehofer  ] made clear that the [ORG CSU  ] , s main rival will now be the [ORG FDP  ] , " which no longer is a small party but clearly intends to become a people , s party , " he said , predicting " they will be targeting the same voters as the [ORG CSU  ] . 
" The [ORG CSU  ] , he added , will have to act as the guardian of the little people " to ensure that MUNICH 00000273 002 OF 002 social justice prevails . 
" Later , upon signing the coalition agreement in [LOC Berlin  ] , [PER Seehofer  ] indicated that he intends to remain in the [ORG CSU  ] leadership . 
Noting that this was the second time he had signed an agreement with the [ORG FDP  ] , following the agreement in [LOC Bavaria  ] one year earlier , he said he might be able to do the same again for the third and fourth time in 2013 . 
The media jumped on this statement since it insinuated that [PER Seehofer  ] had given up hope of the [ORG CSU  ] regaining its absolute majority in the 2013 [MISC Bavarian  ] state elections . 
" This statement might come back to haunt him , " one journalist commented . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Bavarian  ] leaders are strong at home and in [LOC Berlin  ] . 
Contrary to media speculation , [PER Horst Seehofer  ] remains uncontested as [ORG CSU  ] chairman and [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister-President . 
Our contacts in the party , State Chancery and [ORG CSU  ] caucus unanimously rejected speculation about an imminent revolt against his leadership , although several acknowledge there will be discussions of a possible change in 2011 in preparation for the next [MISC Bavarian  ] election in 2013 . 
In the capital , Defense Minister zu [PER Guttenberg  ] will be a serious competitor to Foreign Minister [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] on the diplomatic parquet . 
In foreign and security affairs , zu [PER Guttenberg  ] is better connected in [LOC Washington  ] , fluent in [MISC English  ] , and more experienced in the key issues . 
Moreover , his good relations with the [ORG USG  ] , which started in [LOC Bavaria  ] , extend beyond the [ORG Department of State  ] to the [ORG Department of Defense and Congress  ] , notably through the vehicle of the annual [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] ( next iteration February 5-7 , 2010 ) , where he is a regular and prominent organizer and participant .
