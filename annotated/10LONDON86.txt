End Summary . 
Overly Optimistic ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Susman  ] paid an introductory call on [ORG Liberal Democratic Party  ] leader [PER Nick Clegg  ] on January 12 . 
[PER Clegg  ] may find himself cast into the role of kingmaker if neither the [ORG Labour  ] nor [MISC Conservative  ] parties win an outright parliamentary majority . 
As he has done recently with the press , [PER Clegg  ] refused to be pinned down as to which party the [ORG Lib Dems  ] would support in the event of a hung parliament , insisting instead that his strategy was to “focus on the long term goals.” Despite the fact that current polls indicate that [ORG Lib Dems  ] are unlikely to even hold onto the 63 parliamentary seats they currently have , [PER Clegg  ] appeared optimistic that his party would make progress towards his goal of doubling their number of seats . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] noted that while the [ORG Lib Dems  ] have been very vocal in their opposition to coalition efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] , his party has always supported military action in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Clegg  ] perceived that “a real page had been turned , ” with Obama’s announcement of our new strategy . 
[PER Clegg  ] particularly welcomed the [ORG Obama  ] administration’s increased emphasis on civilian engagement . 
( [PER Note: Clegg  ] has been extremely critical of HMG’s prosecution of the war effort . 
Last summer , for example , he wrote in an op-ed that “recent events have led me to question , for the first time , whether we’re going about things in the right way...Our young men and women’s lives are being thrown away because our politicians won’t get their act together.” Reftel outlines senior [ORG Lib  ] Dem statesman [PER Paddy Ashdown’s  ] views on challenges in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and his belief that [ORG Lib Dems  ] were “in for the long haul.” ) Ambassador [PER Susman  ] expressed [LOC U.S.  ] appreciation for the important contribution made by [LOC UK  ] forces , confirmed our long-term commitment , and stressed the importance of reconciliation in our future efforts . 
Relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clegg  ] stressed that one “could not overestimate” the “amount of goodwill” his party has for the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
He quickly accepted Ambassador Susman’s offer of a briefing on the 2003 extradition treaty . 
( We believe the [ORG Lib Dems  ] misunderstand the facts . 
) [PER Clegg  ] further noted that of the three major political parties in the [LOC UK  ] , the [ORG Lib Dems  ] are , and have always been , the biggest supporters of a strong [ORG EU  ] . 
He stressed his belief that the [LOC UK  ] had an important role to play in advocating mutual objectives in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
In response to [MISC Clegg’s  ] question on key priorities the [ORG USG  ] would be looking for from any new [MISC British  ] government , Ambassador [PER Susman  ] noted the need for support on the full range of mutually-shared foreign policy objectives including , among others: [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC MEPP  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC China  ] and climate change . 
Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Clegg  ] came across as very smooth , a bit like Tory Leader [PER David Cameron  ] . 
While critical of the previous administration , [PER Clegg  ] expressed considerable admiration for President [MISC Obama  ] . 
He downplayed his party’s likely leverage in the event of a hung parliament or minority government , claiming it was “not as much leverage as people think.” Nevertheless , should the elections bring that result , [MISC Clegg’s  ] choices will be critical . 
Much will depend , however , on whether he can keep his often fractious parliamentarians in line .
