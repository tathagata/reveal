( S ) SUMMARY . 
GOP officials are not privy to the full range of [LOC U.S.  ] planning and thinking with regard to the prospective [MISC Patriot  ] battery rotation here , but they do have expectations -- some naive , some tactical -- that they are making increasingly clear . 
For example , when told last autumn that the [ORG Patriots  ] would not be integrated -- at least initially -- into the [MISC Polish  ] air defense system , Deputy Defense Minister [PER Komorowski  ] angrily responded that [LOC Poland  ] expected to have operational missiles , not “potted plants.” Merited or no , our [MISC Polish  ] interlocutors believe: 1 ) ( assuming successful [ORG SoFA  ] talks ) [ORG Patriots  ] will start rotating to [LOC Poland  ] this year regardless of the outcome of Washington’s review of the [ORG Missile Defense  ] program ; 2 ) the battery will have some undefined “operational capability ; ” 3 ) the garrison remaining in [LOC Poland  ] after 2012 will have the same size and composition as the uniformed elements that will staff the rotations ; and 4 ) access to [MISC Patriot  ] equipment for training will not be substantially impeded by provisions of the [ORG Export Control Act  ] . 
To help us manage these issues , this cable lays out what we understand about [MISC Polish  ] expectations and the backstory of how they got there . 
END SUMMARY . 
PATRIOTS AND MD - CONNECTED OR NO ? <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) The proposed [MISC Patriot  ] rotation was a condition of [MISC Polish  ] agreement to sign the [MISC Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement  ] ( [ORG BMDA  ] ) , and the [LOC U.S.  ] would likely not have offered it outside of that context . 
A ( very ) simplified recounting of the story of how we got here seems in order. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The question of [ORG Patriots  ] in [LOC Poland  ] hung ( largely silently ) over the [ORG BMDA  ] negotiations for much of last spring . 
The final breakthrough in the [ORG BMDA  ] negotiations in fact came with a July 7 [MISC Polish  ] non-paper , which indicated a GOP willingness to contribute to the deployment of a [MISC Patriot  ] battery in [LOC Poland  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] non-paper response of 10 August said that “in the context of a broader and deeper bilateral security relationship , including the deployment of missile defense interceptors in [LOC Poland  ] , the [LOC United States  ] is prepared to deploy a [ORG U.S. Army  ] [MISC Patriot  ] battery in [LOC Poland  ] ( emphasis added ) .” The [MISC Patriot  ] deployment plans were made public in the [ORG Declaration of Strategic Cooperation  ] , signed at the time of the [ORG BMDA  ] , where we agreed to intensify our security and defense cooperation , including through “the deployment of a [ORG U.S. Army  ] [MISC Patriot  ] air and missile defense system in [LOC Poland”  ] starting in 2009. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Since then both sides have used this connection to urge greater negotiating energy on the part of the other: the [LOC U.S.  ] saying clearly that it will not move forward on [ORG Patriots  ] without ratification of the [ORG BMDA  ] and [ORG SOFA  ] ( a condition outlined in the 10 August non-paper ) , and the [MISC Poles  ] moving cautiously at times on [ORG SOFA  ] talks out of concern that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not on schedule for a 2009 commencement of the [MISC Patriot  ] rotation . 
Correctly or not , the [MISC Poles  ] believe that ratification of [ORG SoFA  ] and the [ORG BMDA  ] gets them [ORG Patriots  ] in 2009 , independent of a [ORG USG  ] decision on BMD , and that the [ORG Strategic Declaration  ] signed at the time of the [ORG BMDA  ] stands on its own . 
They have even turned our language on us in making the point , asking that the [LOC U.S.  ] not be so “transactional” in tying its obligations to [MISC Poland’s  ] defense to new thinking about interceptors . 
WHEN IS A [MISC PATRIOT  ] A [MISC PATRIOT  ] ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The [ORG Declaration of Strategic Cooperation  ] outlines some parameters for the proposed [MISC Patriot  ] “deployment , ” allowing that a [MISC Patriot  ] battery rotation “will include joint training opportunities that will enhance [MISC Polish  ] air defense capabilities.” The [MISC Poles  ] interpret “will include” to mean “not limited to” and they expect that [MISC Polish  ] air defenses will be enhanced in some operational capacity by the [MISC Patriot  ] rotation . 
Repeated [LOC U.S.  ] statements since August 2008 that the battery will not be operational are interpreted by the [MISC Poles  ] to be part of a larger discussion of [LOC C4ISR  ] and the inter-operability of [MISC Patriot  ] in their overall air defense architecture . 
After months of back and forth , we think the [MISC Poles  ] now understand that the rotation battery will not be fully operational and cannot be integrated immediately into the [MISC Polish  ] system and that the battery will focus on training and exercises. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) However , this is a good juncture to point out the most glaring gap in understanding between us and the [MISC Poles  ] . 
The [MISC Poles  ] have not been told that the battery will rotate without actual missiles -- i.e. , not only will the rotation not be operational in the initial phase ( due to [LOC C4ISR  ] and other issues ) but it will also not be operational , and certainly interoperable , at any point in our current plans . 
This will be a question of basic definitions for the [MISC Poles:  ] is it a [MISC Patriot  ] battery if it doesn’t have live missiles ? 
The [MISC Poles  ] think the [ORG Patriots  ] will become not only operable , but interoperable , over time - thus enhancing [MISC Poland’s  ] air defense . 
When told last Fall that the [ORG Patriots  ] would not be operational , at least at first , Deputy Defense Minister [PER Komorowski  ] angrily responded that [LOC Poland  ] expected to receive operational [MISC Patriot  ] missiles , “not potted plants.” WHAT IS A GARRISON ? 
WHAT IS JOINT TRAINING ? <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) The GOP also has a different concept of the footprint involved when the [LOC U.S.  ] agreed ( also in the [ORG Declaration  ] ) to establish a “garrison to support the [ORG U.S. Army Patriot  ] battery” by 2012 . 
The [MISC Poles  ] believe the permanent battery arrangement will have around 110 personnel -- about the same number required to staff planned temporary rotations between 2009 and 2012 -- which is to say that the [MISC Poles  ] expect the “garrison” to convert the rotation itself into a permanent presence . 
Current [LOC U.S.  ] planning appears to call for only 20-30 permanent personnel to maintain forward deployed equipment . 
In addition , the [MISC Poles  ] understand that technology transfer regulations would normally restrict their access to [MISC Patriot  ] equipment for purposes of training and exercises , but have interpreted the clause in the [ORG Declaration  ] allowing for “joint training opportunities” to mean that they will have greater access to technology than is generally granted by the [ORG Export Control Act  ] . 
COMMENT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) We need to navigate the way forward carefully . 
We may be able to close some of the gaps between our plans and the [MISC Poles  ] expectations with time and focus and patience on both sides . 
However , the “potted plant” problem , is much more tricky . 
Prime Minister Tusk , neither a fan of MD nor as wed to the [MISC U.S.-Polish  ] strategic relationship as his predecessors , sold the [ORG BMDA  ] to the [MISC Polish  ] public as enhancing [MISC Polish  ] security because of the [MISC Patriot  ] agreement . 
Assuming the [MISC European  ] missile site plans don’t completely wither on the vine , the [MISC Poles  ] will expect the [MISC Patriot  ] rotation to not only go forward , but to have some operational , if not eventual interoperational capability . 
As we move forward , we will want to be careful not to stumble into this chasm . 
We need a strategy for how we will consult with the [MISC Poles  ] to close the gap before it undoes much good work to date .
