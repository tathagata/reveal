Summary . 
Over the past two months , credit rating agencies and other international financial firms have released a torrent of reports raising questions about the state of the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy and the activities and stability of [LOC Iceland  ] 's major banks . 
These reports have been widely covered in the international financial press , causing a marked drop in the value of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Krona  ] and of shares listed on the [MISC Icelandic  ] stock exchange . 
This new level of scrutiny is also making it more challenging for [MISC Icelandic  ] banks to secure financing on international markets . 
There is no question that certain imbalances have emerged in the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy , including a high current account deficit , high inflation and high private sector debt levels . 
It remains an open question , however , whether these imbalances render [LOC Iceland  ] particularly vulnerable to an economic crisis . 
Financial analysts have articulately argued both sides of the case . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
The release of a report by the credit rating agency [ORG Fitch  ] in mid-February expressing concerns about overly risky practices on the part of [MISC Icelandic  ] banks and troubling signs for the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy provoked a sudden drop in the value of the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Krona  ] and the main stock exchange index ( the [MISC ICEX  ] ) . 
The [ORG Fitch  ] report has subsequently been followed by a slew of other reports from international rating firms such as [ORG Moody 's  ] and [ORG Standard and Poor  ] 's , and from investment and commercial banks including [ORG Merrill Lynch  ] , [ORG Morgan Stanley  ] and [PER JP Morgan  ] . 
Speculation and analysis about [LOC Iceland  ] 's economy now appears almost daily in the international press , including leading publications such as the [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] , Financial Times , and The [MISC Economist.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The various reports run the gamut from concluding that the [MISC Icelandic  ] financial sky is falling to the view that despite a few economic indicators being out of balance , the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy is sound and the negative prognostications wildly exaggerated . 
In any case , just the fact that the [MISC Icelandic  ] economy is now under the microscope -- fairly or unfairly -- has made the domestic and international markets jittery about the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Krona  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] securities . 
As a result , the [ORG Krona  ] has fallen 15 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year , and the stock exchange index has dropped 18 percent since reaching an all- time high on February 16. ---------------------------------------- The Case for Looming Economic Difficulty ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The main areas of economic concern most often cited by analysts are [LOC Iceland  ] 's large current account deficit ( some 16 percent of GDP ) , high inflation ( 4.4 percent ) , high personal indebtedness , and high levels of short-term foreign debt carried by [LOC Iceland  ] 's three major banks -- debt that the banks are now having some difficulty rolling over except by agreeing to pay higher interest rates . 
In addition , some analysts maintain that [LOC Iceland  ] 's major banks ( all of which do both commercial and investment banking ) engage in overly risky practices and have " incestuous " relationships with the other banks and major domestic conglomerates These factors , it is argued , indicate that serious challenges and difficulties are looming on the horizon for the banks and the economy generally. --------------------------------------------- -- The Case that Analysts' Warnings Are Overstated --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Nonetheless , significant arguments have also been put forward that the threats posed by certain imbalances in the economy , and by extensive international borrowing on the part of the banks , have been exaggerated and misinterpreted , and do not pose the danger many have posited . 
For example , the high current account deficit is in large part due to the three huge capital investment construction projects currently underway in [LOC Iceland  ] -- two huge aluminum smelter facilities ( including one owned by [ORG Alcoa  ] ) and a massive hydroelectric power plant . 
These projects represent some $2.5 billion being pumped into a $15 billion economy over just a couple of years . 
When these projects are all completed , sometime during 2007 , the current account situation will likely return to normal ( from 2000-2003 the average deficit was minus 4 percent ) . 
The [ORG Krona  ] 's recent return to a more realistic level will also help even out the current account deficit by dampening imports. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
It is also pointed out that government debt at 30 percent of GDP is low by most standards ( and about half the level as in the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] ) . 
As for inflation , when real estate price increases are removed , the " core " rate of inflation is a mere 1.8 percent . 
While the banks have indeed been borrowing heavily to finance [MISC Icelandic  ] conglomerates' investments abroad , these foreign investments have largely been in non-speculative , low-risk sectors such as banking , pharmaceuticals and clothing and food retailing . 
Another argument holds that rather than suggesting underlying weakness or instability , the fact that [MISC Icelandic  ] banks now find it more difficult ( i.e. , costly ) to tap financing most likely implies the banks will simply have to curtail their recent expansive lending activity and settle for " normal " growth instead of the torrid double- and triple-digit growth rates of the last few years. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The most compelling analysis offered to date in defense of the [MISC Icelandic  ] banks , the soundness of the economy , and the government 's ability to handle any financial crisis comes from the well-respected [LOC U.S.  ] credit rating firm [ORG Moody 's  ] . 
In a report entitled " [LOC Iceland  ] 's Solvency and Liquidity Are Not at [LOC Risk  ] , " issued April 4 , [ORG Moody 's  ] offers the following conclusions: -- " While we have warned of the risks that may accompany increased leverage in the economy , [LOC Iceland  ] has our top rating with a stable outlook , and we believe these concerns have recently been exaggerated . 
" -- " [LOC Iceland  ] is a very wealthy country engaged in a major process of economic diversification . 
It possesses ample sources of alternate external liquidity above and beyond the banks own liquidity positions that should enable the government and banking system to weather a period of market turbulence . 
" -- " [LOC Iceland  ] is well positioned to deal with any potential claims on government resources that might emanate from a systemic problem in any sector of the economy . 
Our Aaa rating for [LOC Iceland  ] is compatible with such an extreme scenario . 
" --------------------------------------------- ------- Government Defends Economy , but Warnings not Ignored --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
While the government has reacted to the current furor by consistently reiterating the message that the economy is sound and there is no need to worry , economic policymakers have also clearly taken some of the warnings on board . 
For example , the [ORG Central Bank  ] raised its official rate by a more- than-expected 0.75 percent ( to 11.5 percent ) at its last rate-setting meeting . 
This action sent a signal that the government is indeed determined to rein in inflation , while also helping to ease the decline of the [ORG Krona  ] . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] has also sought to quell market jitters through reassuring statements that [LOC Iceland  ] 's financial system stands up to all its stress tests . 
In addition , a new ( though long in the works ) joint [ORG Central Bank-Financial Supervisory Authority  ] committee has been established to watch for signs of weaknesses in the financial sector and to formulate contingency plans for correcting them. --------------------------------------------- ---------- Consequences of Altered Economic Conditions/Perceptions --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
Comment: Certainly going forward the banks will have to curtail their lending activity now that foreign financiers are less willing to continue extending easy credit . 
And the [MISC Icelandic  ] stock market 's phenomenal growth rate will undoubtedly return to more realistic levels now that [MISC Icelandic  ] firms will be compelled to take a more incremental approach to foreign expansion in response to changed market conditions . 
This evolving economic landscape has government forecasters envisioning [MISC Icelandic  ] GDP growth going from 6 percent in 2005 to 4.5 percent in 2006 , and cooling further to between 0 and 2.0 percent in 2007. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
Comment continued: Given the intense financial media scrutiny [LOC Iceland  ] has been under for the past two months , it can be argued that the country 's economy , major conglomerates , banks , and financial markets have actually weathered the storm fairly well ( e.g. , the currency and stock market declines might have been far worse ) . 
As the [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] put it in an April 10 article , " The jury is still out on whether it ( the current economic turmoil ) is anything more than a rough spot .
