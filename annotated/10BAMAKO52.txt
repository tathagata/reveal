<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 BAMAKO 000052 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/29/2020 TAGS PTER , KCRM , PINS , PGOV , ML SUBJECT: KIDNAPPING AND LIBERATION OF [MISC KOUNTA  ] LEADER ILLUMINATES POLITICAL FISSURES IN NORTH REF: 09BAMAKO280 [ORG Classified By: Political Counselor  ] [PER Peter Newman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: In the early morning of Jan 22 , [PER Kounta  ] traditional chief and Mayor of [PER Anafis Baba  ] ould [PER Sidi Elmoctar  ] was kidnapped from his residence in [PER Anafis  ] in theKidal region . 
POL sources concur that [ORG Telemsi Arab  ] smugglers kidnapped the octogenarian leader as a reprisal for an ambush ould [MISC Sidi Elmoctar’s  ] son led against a joint [MISC Telemsi/Imghad  ] drug smuggling caravan . 
The [PER Kounta  ] are one of the traditionally important tribes of northern [LOC Mali  ] . 
His kidnapping had the possibility of escalating a simmering conflict over smuggling routes to open warfare between the [ORG Telemsi  ] and [ORG Imghad  ] communities on one side and the [ORG Kounta  ] and [ORG Ifoghas  ] on the other . 
The [ORG GOM  ] sent a delegation to negotiate and successfully secured ould [MISC Sidi ElMoctar’s  ] release , avoiding a broader conflict for the time being . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On Friday , Jan 22 before dawn , [ORG Telemsi Arab  ] and [LOC Imghad Tuareg  ] smugglers kidnapped octogenarian and diabetic [ORG Kounta  ] traditional chief [PER Baba  ] ould [MISC Sidi Elmoctar  ] from his residence . 
The [MISC Malian  ] press has characterized this incident as a settling of scores between rival drug smugglers . 
Both POL contacts and the [MISC Malian  ] press reported an ambush of a drug caravan in [LOC Kidal  ] region during the week of Jan 10-16 . 
The smugglers reportedly were [MISC Telemsi Arabs  ] and [LOC Imghad Tuaregs  ] . 
The group that ambushed the caravan was reportedly led by the son of ould [PER Sidi Elmoctar  ] and was comprised of [ORG Kounta Arab  ] and [LOC Ifoghas Tuareg  ] fighters . 
POL contacts have said the caravan was carrying five truck-mountable automatic weapons and cocaine . 
Estimates of the size of the cargo range wildly from several kilograms to several tons of cocaine. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Northern [MISC Malian  ] communities generally viewed the kidnapping of ould [MISC Sidi  ] [PER Elmoctar  ] as disrespectful and dangerous to the relative calm experienced in northern [LOC Mali  ] at present . 
One contact commented this is the first time in almost twenty years such a prominent tribal leader has been kidnapped . 
The last incident was in 1993 , when now [MISC Malian  ] Army [ORG Colonel Elhedji  ] ag [LOC Gamou  ] kidnapped Attaher ag [LOC Intallah  ] , the overall chief of the [LOC Ifoghas Tuareg  ] clan of [LOC Kidal  ] . 
PolFSN , who is a [MISC Tuareg  ] from [LOC Kidal  ] , commented that the two events cannot be equated in severity because the context is totally different . 
Attaher ag [LOC Intallah  ] was kidnapped during a period of open warfare in the north , while the kidnapping of ould [MISC Sidi  ] [PER Elmoctar  ] was a greater affront as it occured during ostensibly a time of peace , ongoing smuggling and political conflicts notwithstanding. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On Monday , Jan 25 , the [ORG GOM  ] sent a delegation comprised of Minister of Culture [PER Mohamed Elmoctar  ] , [MISC Malian  ] Army Colonel Abderhamane ould Meydou , Tarkint Mayor [PER Baba  ] ould Choueck , and [MISC Malian  ] Gendarmerie Colonel [PER Guichma  ] to negotiate the release of ould [PER Sidi Elmoctar  ] . 
All members are [ORG Telemsi Arabs  ] except [PER Guichma  ] , who is [MISC Songhai  ] . 
A former [ORG DGSE  ] ( [MISC Malian  ] intelligence agency ) director told [ORG PolCouns  ] he believed the mission was so promptly dispatched because the risks of broader conflict were high as a result of the kidnapping . 
On Jan 27 , the kidnappers released ould [MISC Sidi Elmoctar  ] in [LOC Gao  ] , after two days of successful negotiations and strong social pressure opposing the kidnapping. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Although the consensus opinion is the kidnapping was a reprisal for an ambush and theft of contraband , POL contacts believe this event is indicative of a trend toward greater inter-tribal conflict in northern [LOC Mali  ] , and thus , is of greater import . 
Two POL contacts specifically commented that northern [LOC Mali  ] is quickly splitting into two political camps: one allied with the [ORG Telemsi Arab  ] and [LOC Imghad Tuareg  ] communities of [LOC Gao Region  ] , and the other allied with the [ORG Kounta Arab  ] and [LOC Ifoghas Tuareg  ] communities of [LOC Kidal Region  ] . 
These two camps are now formalizing their political existence as the [ORG Kounta/Ifoghas  ] led “Reseau de Plaidoyer” and the [MISC Telemsi/Imghad  ] “Forces du Changement.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) By way of background , the [ORG Kounta  ] and [ORG Ifoghas  ] have been the traditional leaders of the [MISC Tuareg  ] and [MISC Arab  ] communities of northern [LOC Mali  ] for the past century and a half . 
The [ORG Telemsi  ] and [ORG Imghad  ] have been under their tutelage . 
Part of the current friction arises from the arrival of a form of democracy to northern [LOC Mali  ] in recent years , with allegations arising that the [ORG Telemsi  ] , among other groups that have BAMAKO 00000052 002 OF 002 traditionally been smugglers/traders , are using their wealth to buy elections ( particularly in the April 2009 communal elections ) and are using the means of the state to usurp traditional authority in northern [LOC Mali  ] ( see reftel ) . 
If this conflict were to leave the confines of proxy battles via smuggling and elections , and enter the realm of outright warfare , it would not be the first instance: the [ORG Telemsi  ] and [ORG Kounta  ] communities engaged in a protracted conflict in the early-2000s .
