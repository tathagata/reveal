Susman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C//NF ) Summary . 
The [MISC Secretary’s  ] visit to [LOC London  ] comes on the heels of the [ORG Labour  ] , [MISC Conservative  ] , and [ORG Liberal Democrat  ] political party conferences -- their last before the [LOC UK  ] elections which must be held by June 2010 . 
The domestic political situation remains in flux , but with the [MISC Conservatives  ] enjoying a consistent lead in the polls . 
A [MISC Conservative  ] victory is not assured , however ; the [MISC Conservatives  ] have done a better job of criticizing [ORG Labour  ] policies than of selling [MISC Conservative  ] solutions . 
The cumulative contraction of the [LOC UK  ] economy by 5.7 percent over the last five quarters has focused electoral discussions on economic issues . 
The major foreign policy issues for the election are the [MISC UK’s  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which all parties continue to back for now in spite of eroding public support and a lively debate in the media , and the [MISC UK’s  ] role in the [ORG EU  ] , which [ORG Labour  ] has been using as an example of the [MISC Conservatives’  ] “isolationist” tendencies on economic and foreign policy . 
Politically , PM [PER Brown  ] and Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] will want the [MISC Secretary’s  ] visit to demonstrate the strength of their relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] administration in order to counter domestic press speculation about a perceived decline in the “special relationship” following Megrahi’s release and President [PER Obama’s  ] reported “snubbing” of PM Brown’s requests for one-on-one meetings at the [MISC G-20  ] and [LOC UNGA  ] . 
Some of the key issues of import to the [LOC UK  ] Government are [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Northern Ireland  ] , and non-proliferation . 
End summary . 
The [LOC UK  ] on Key Issues -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) The [MISC Secretary’s  ] meetings with PM [PER Gordon Brown  ] and Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] likely will focus on the following key issues: -- [LOC Afghanistan  ] - As the second largest force contributor in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [LOC UK  ] has lost 219 soldiers since operations began in 2001 . 
The up-tick in [MISC British  ] casualties in July and August 2009 has contributed to renewed public debate on the [MISC UK’s  ] engagement there . 
Public support for the war effort is tepid . 
Rather than questioning the reasons for the [MISC UK’s  ] presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , many critics instead have asserted that [PER Brown  ] has provided insufficient troops and equipment ( including helicopters ) to get the job done . 
In his September 25 discussion with the President , [PER Brown  ] said [MISC Afghan  ] forces must shoulder a greater portion of the burden and take more responsibility for their own affairs and asserted the [LOC UK  ] would not be “cutting out” of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , though it lacks the capacity to commit additional troops . 
[PER Brown  ] and [PER Miliband  ] made similar statements to General McChrystal on October 1 and [ORG Admiral Mullen  ] and [ORG Admiral Stavridis  ] October 2 , and the [MISC PM’s  ] Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Simon McDonald  ] has asked the USG to show “understanding of the political pressures that the PM is under.” However , [LOC UK  ] military officials claim that 1,000 - 2,000 additional troops are available for deployment . 
[PER Brown  ] , [PER Miliband  ] , and [MISC British  ] military leaders would like other [ORG NATO  ] allies to assume a greater share of combat operations , stressing that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] and a few other allies have borne the brunt of the fighting . 
The PM very much wants to see strong [LOC U.S.  ] leadership and is anxious to see the Administration’s policy review completed soon . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] - The [LOC UK  ] has privately shared with us that it is ready to proceed with designations of the [LOC Islamic Republic of  ] [ORG Iran Shipping Lines  ] ( [ORG IRISL  ] ) and [ORG Bank Mellat  ] under their [MISC Counter Terrorism Act  ] powers , an action that requires parliamentary approval . 
In the wake of the October 1 [ORG P5  ] 1 meeting in [LOC Geneva  ] , however , [LOC UK  ] officials are likely to want to consult with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the best timing for announcing the designation . 
[LOC UK  ] officials may also raise the issue of [PER Nosratollah Tajik  ] , former [MISC Iranian  ] ambassador to [LOC Jordan  ] , currently under arrest in the [LOC UK  ] and awaiting extradition to the [LOC U.S.  ] on charges of procuring restricted military items ( night-vision goggles ) for the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
[PER Tajik  ] has exhausted all judicial appeals in the [LOC UK  ] and all that stands in the way of the extradition is approval by the Home Secretary . 
Before approving the extradition , the [LOC UK  ] wants to be sure the timing is right and will not interfere with our joint efforts through the [ORG P5  ] 1 to engage with [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- [LOC Pakistan  ] - Because of immigration and economic ties , [LOC Pakistan  ] has an important domestic dimension for the [LOC UK  ] and will feature in public debates in the run-up to the [MISC UK’s  ] 2010 elections . 
Following the Friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] meeting on September 25 , the [LOC UK  ] announced it will provide an extra [MISC GBP  ] 50 million ( [MISC USD  ] 80 million ) to improve infrastructure and security in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] border areas . 
However , [LOC UK  ] officials later confirmed that these are not new funds and will instead come from the current [MISC GBP  ] 655 million ( [MISC USD  ] 1 billion ) already designated for [LOC Pakistan  ] aid . 
[MISC British  ] leaders view a secure [LOC Pakistan  ] as key to regional stability . 
They recognize [MISC Pakistan’s  ] now more effective response to the [ORG Taliban  ] and other extremists , but say more is needed . 
-- [LOC Northern Ireland  ] - Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] and [LOC Northern Ireland  ] Secretary [PER Shaun Woodward  ] will probably ask the Secretary to urge [LOC Northern Ireland  ] First Minister [PER Peter Robinson  ] and Deputy First Minister [PER Martin McGuinness  ] to accept the “Westminster Package , ” regarding the devolution of justice and policing powers , which was recently presented by Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] . 
[ORG HMG  ] would like to reach an agreement with the parties this week , before the [MISC Secretary’s  ] arrival . 
[ORG HMG  ] argues that the proposal is a good deal for [LOC Northern Ireland  ] . 
If the agreement is not completed by the weekend , there is potential that some of the parties could seek to draw in the Secretary . 
The best approach is to urge all parties to work together patiently to reach agreement . 
An agreement would be a strong , positive signal to potential investors . 
-- Nuclear Non-proliferation - Both PM [PER Brown  ] and FS [PER Miliband  ] welcome [LOC U.S.  ] leadership on the global nuclear non-proliferation agenda , including the April 2010 Nuclear Security Summit in [LOC Washington  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] firmly agrees with us on the importance of close [ORG P5  ] and P3 cooperation in the lead up to next year’s Nuclear [ORG Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) review conference . 
At [LOC UNGA  ] , [PER Brown  ] emphasized that the onus is on non-nuclear states to prove they are not developing nuclear weapons . 
He also pledged the [MISC UK’s  ] support for sponsoring a uranium bank and offering civil nuclear power to non-nuclear states that fulfill their responsibilities . 
He also announced that , subject to the sustained ability to maintain continuous deterrence , the [LOC UK  ] will consider reducing its fleet of [MISC Trident  ] nuclear-armed submarines from four to three . 
The move also is regarded as a cost-cutting measure for a government facing significant fiscal challenges in the coming years . 
-- [ORG Defense Trade Treaty  ] - The PM and FS [PER Miliband  ] may ask about the status of the [ORG Defense Trade Treaty  ] and when the [ORG Senate  ] will ratify it . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] told [LOC UK  ] officials on September 30 that her goal is to have the [ORG Senate  ] act on the treaty by year’s end . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] and [PER A/S Shapiro  ] are working to counter the [ORG SFRC  ] staff’s belief that implementing legislation is necessary to enforce the treaty and to address their concerns about [ORG Congressional  ] consultations and notifications . 
-- [ORG Arms Trade Treaty  ] - [PER Miliband  ] frequently raises with senior [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors the possibility of negotiating an ATT . 
We continue to have doubts about the possibility of negotiating an effective treaty , but are willing to move forward on the condition that it will proceed on the consensus basis traditional for multilateral arms control and nonproliferation negotiations . 
-- [PER Gary McKinnon  ] Extradition Case - The PM will likely raise with the Secretary ( as he has with the Ambassador ) the extradition case of [PER Gary McKinnon  ] . 
[PER McKinnon  ] is a 43-year old computer hacker with [ORG Asperger’s Syndrome  ] who is wanted for prosecution in the [LOC U.S.  ] ; he is accused of hacking into [LOC U.S.  ] government systems in 2001 and 2002 . 
[PER McKinnon  ] has gained enormous popular sympathy in his appeal against extradition ; the [MISC UK’s  ] final decision is pending . 
The case has also caused public criticism of the [MISC U.S.-UK  ] extradition treaty . 
In August , PM [PER Brown  ] , in a one-on-one meeting with the Ambassador , proposed a deal: that [PER McKinnon  ] plead guilty , make a statement of contrition , but serve any sentence of incarceration in the [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Brown  ] cited deep public concern that [PER McKinnon  ] , with his medical condition , would commit suicide or suffer injury in imprisoned in a [LOC U.S.  ] facility . 
The Ambassador has raised this proposal with [PER AG Holder  ] and would be happy to brief the Secretary in more detail . 
Domestic Politics in Flux in [LOC Run-up  ] to Elections --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) The annual political party conferences currently underway have thrust the [LOC UK  ] into electoral campaigning mode , with the [ORG Labour  ] , [MISC Conservative  ] , and [ORG Liberal Democrat  ] parties all positioning themselves for the general elections , which must occur before June 2010 . 
The recent conferences have given each party in turn an up-tick in the polls , though with the [MISC Tories  ] consistently enjoying a significant overall lead . 
PM [PER Brown  ] is unchallenged as leader of the [ORG Labour Party  ] , but remains embattled by the [LOC UK  ] media . 
Many in his party question if [ORG Labour  ] can win the next elections with him at the helm despite his strong showing at the [ORG Labour  ] conference . 
Honing its campaign message , the [ORG Labour Party  ] plans to make the elections about class divisions , highlighting Labour’s strong public services record and its economic vision for [LOC Britain  ] . 
At present , the major foreign policy issues shaping the electoral debate are the [MISC UK’s  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which all parties continue to back for now in spite of eroding public support and a lively debate in the media , and the [MISC UK’s  ] role in the [ORG European Union  ] , which [ORG Labour  ] has been using as an example of [MISC Conservative  ] economic and foreign policy “isolationist” tendencies. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) [MISC Conservative  ] leader [PER David Cameron’s  ] headline message to the media as the [MISC Tory  ] conference began October 5 was about the [MISC UK’s  ] “twin crises” of debt and unemployment and the [MISC Tory’s  ] to-be-unveiled “big , bold , and radical” scheme to “get [LOC Britain  ] working.” The [MISC Tories’  ] platform during the June [MISC European  ] and local elections was based on keeping in focus bedrock issues such as the economy , job creation , and health and education reform ; casting [ORG Labour  ] as profligate and irresponsible ; and portraying the [MISC Conservatives  ] as the party of thrift , responsible spending and transparency . 
Ireland’s “yes” vote on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] has highlighted internal [MISC Conservative  ] party divisions on the [ORG EU  ] as the conference gets underway . 
PM [PER Brown  ] and FS Miliband may ask the Secretary to emphasize [LOC U.S.  ] support for a “strong [MISC Europe”  ] as a way to highlight [MISC Conservative  ] schisms. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) In response to the summer 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal , which has alienated some voters from the political class and the mainstream parties , [PER Cameron  ] has been credited with reacting more decisively than [PER Brown  ] - a performance that some political commentators have said demonstrated impressive leadership , especially compared to [PER Brown  ] ( who throughout his prime ministership has had to fight accusations of indecisiveness ) . 
Keeping the public focused on the economy , [PER Cameron  ] has said the [MISC Conservatives  ] would be judged by their response to the [MISC UK’s  ] debt crisis and has called for an “age of austerity.” While spending cuts are expected to be a large part of the future [MISC Conservative  ] program , neither [PER Cameron  ] nor Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer [PER Osborne  ] has offered details on where government spending should be cut , beyond just saying there will be a ten percent cross-the-board cut with only education and the [ORG National Health Services  ] remaining untouched . 
Many in the [LOC UK  ] public remain skeptical of the [MISC Tories’  ] unspecified plans for major cuts. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C//NF  ] ) The [MISC UK’s  ] relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] has also become a campaign issue . 
During the fever pitch of [LOC UK  ] media reporting on the release of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi , the [MISC Conservatives  ] blamed [ORG Labour  ] for damaging the “special relationship.” The [LOC UK  ] media has refused to let the issue die , continuing its mischievous reporting of recent alleged USG snubs of senior [LOC UK  ] officials , particularly during [ORG UNGA  ] . 
Overview of [LOC UK  ] Economy ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 and has suffered a cumulative contraction of 5.7 percent over the last five quarters . 
In July , the [ORG IMF  ] forecast a further contraction of 4.2 percent in 2009 and growth of 0.2 percent in 2010 . 
[ORG HM Treasury  ] expects a contraction of 3.5 percent in 2009 and growth of 1.25 percent in 2010 . 
Unemployment stands at 7.8 percent , its highest since 1995 , and is expected to climb to more than 10 percent in early 2010 . 
Unemployment is particularly acute among 18-to-24 year olds at 17 percent . 
The economic downturn is taking a heavy toll on trade . 
According to [ORG U.S Commerce Department  ] and [ORG U.S. International Trade Commission  ] monthly trade statistics , [LOC U.S.  ] goods exports to the [LOC UK  ] declined by 21.7 percent from January to June 2009 , compared to the same period in 2008 , and [LOC UK  ] exports to the [LOC U.S.  ] declined by 25.6 percent . 
Concerns about employment figures remain high , with unemployment rates near eight percent and expected to peak just in advance of the parliamentary elections. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Public debt stands at GBP 800 billion ( 56.8 percent of GDP ) , its highest level since records began in 1974 , and up from 56.6 percent last month . 
However , [LOC UK  ] debt as a percentage of GDP is still lower than in the other G7 countries . 
How to manage and finance the [MISC UK’s  ] debt burden is a key issue dividing the two parties , and is expected to emerge as one of the top economic issues during the political campaign .
