[LOC DUBLIN  ] 849 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Thomas C. Foley  ] ; Reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . 
Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Foley  ] met with [MISC Irish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Dermot Ahern  ] on December 19 to discuss a wide range of issues . 
In recent days , [PER Ahern  ] has tamped down the public reaction to a report of the [ORG Irish Human Rights Commission  ] ( [ORG IHRC  ] ) on extraordinary renditions . 
[PER Ahern  ] indicated that the 3500-strong [ORG EU  ] peacekeeping force for [ORG Eastern Chad  ] , led by [MISC Irish  ] Lt. General [PER Pat Nash  ] and including 450 [MISC Irish  ] troops , will be deployed in January or February 2008 . 
He stated that [LOC Ireland  ] , the [ORG Framework Nation  ] in [LOC Kosovo  ] , intends to remain in [LOC Kosovo  ] on the basis of the pre-December 10 mandate and plans to contribute to the planned [ORG EU  ] ESDP police mission there . 
[PER Ahern  ] revealed that the [ORG Department of Foreign Affairs Conflict Resolution Unit  ] will tackle [LOC East Timor  ] as its first venture into international conflict resolution intervention . 
Regarding the [ORG EU Reform Treaty  ] , [PER Ahern  ] predicted that there will be a tough battle to get out sufficient " yes " votes . 
He predicted that the recently proposed DHS full pre-clearance agreement with [LOC Ireland  ] will be substantially altered by the [ORG Irish Attorney General  ] . 
The Ambassador thanked [PER Ahern  ] for accepting ten [MISC Cuban  ] refugees currently encamped at [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
[PER Ahern  ] advised the Ambassador that the [ORG Department should  ] liaise with Ambassador [PER Michael Collins  ] in planning the 2008 [PER St. Patrick  ] 's Day bilateral . 
He once again raised the [ORG Irish Government  ] 's concern about the status of [MISC Irish  ] illegal aliens in the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Ahern  ] 's warm , open welcome of the Ambassador is a measure of the importance the [MISC Irish  ] attach to the bilateral relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] End summary . 
Extraordinary Renditions ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Foley  ] thanked [PER Ahern  ] for his staunch rejection of the [ORG Irish Human Rights Commission  ] 's ( [ORG IHRC  ] ) demand that the [ORG Irish Government  ] inspect aircraft landing in [LOC Ireland  ] that are alleged to have been involved in so-called extraordinary rendition flights ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Ahern  ] declared that the [ORG IHRC  ] report contained no new information , but warned that opposition parties [PER Fine Gael  ] and [ORG Labour  ] could be expected to continue to raise the issue from time to time in efforts to politically embarrass the [ORG Fianna Fail-run Government  ] . 
[PER Ahern  ] said that several alleged rendition flights had been inspected during the past year and fully cleared ; the last flight , he wryly noted , was carrying six touring golfers . 
[PER Ahern  ] said that a public response by the [ORG Embassy  ] would not be useful , but suggested that the Ambassador personally engage [PER Fine Gael  ] leadership to explain the [LOC U.S.  ] position. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] noted that he had " put his neck on the chopping block " and would pay a severe political price if it ever turned out that rendition flights had entered [LOC Ireland  ] or if one was discovered in the future . 
He stated that he " could use a little more information " about the flights , musing that it might not be a bad idea to allow the random inspection of a few planes to proceed , which would provide cover if a rendition flight ever surfaced . 
He seemed quite convinced that at least three flights involving renditions had refueled at [LOC Shannon Airport  ] before or after conducting renditions elsewhere. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: While [PER Ahern  ] 's public stance on extraordinary renditions is rock-solid , his musings during the meeting seemed less assured . 
This was the only issue during the meeting that agitated him ; he spent considerable time dwelling on it . 
[PER Ahern  ] seemed to be fishing for renewed assurances from the Ambassador that no rendition flights have transited [LOC Ireland  ] , or would transit in the future . 
Highlighting the recent attention drawn to renditions by the [ORG IHRC  ] report , later the same day the Parliamentary [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] held a hearing on the matter . 
The hearing , attended by POLOFFs , generally confirmed the Government 's view that there is no evidence that rendition flights have transited [LOC Ireland  ] . 
The hearing , which was barely reported by the press , failed to achieve any traction for critics of [MISC American  ] policy . 
End comment . 
Chad/Darfur ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In November , [PER Ahern  ] visited [LOC Chad  ] in preparation for [LOC DUBLIN  ] 00000916 002 OF 003 the deployment of a 3500-strong [ORG EU  ] peacekeeping force , led by [MISC Irish  ] Lt. General [PER Pat Nash  ] and including 450 [MISC Irish  ] troops . 
[PER Ahern  ] , who also visited [LOC Darfur  ] in 2006 , indicated that the situation in [ORG Eastern Chad  ] is not as dire as [LOC Darfur  ] , but that conditions are deteriorating . 
He said that the Government of [LOC Chad  ] , unlike the Government of [LOC Sudan  ] , is reasonably positive about the intervention of the [ORG EU  ] force . 
He stated that force equipment requirements , which have somewhat delayed the mission , have been sorted out and that force deployment would begin in January or February 2008. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In an aside on [LOC Sudan  ] , [PER Ahern  ] expressed despondency about progress in [LOC Darfur  ] , saying that he didn't believe the leaders of [LOC Sudan  ] , including President al-Bashir , were serious about resolving the [LOC Darfur  ] situation . 
He labeled al-Bashir and [MISC Sudanese  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ismail  ] as untrustworthy , saying they had both lied to him . 
He described [LOC Khartoum  ] as booming and al-Bashir as scoffing at [MISC Western  ] sanctions . 
" The [MISC Chinese  ] are everywhere in [LOC Khartoum  ] , " he said . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] said that [LOC Ireland  ] intends to remain in [LOC Kosovo  ] under the pre-December 10 mandate . 
( Note: [LOC Ireland  ] is the [ORG Framework Nation  ] in [LOC Kosovo  ] , responsible for commanding , controlling , and directing operations of the multilateral peacekeeping force ( [ORG KFOR  ] ) operating there . 
End note . 
) [LOC Ireland  ] also intends to contribute to the [ORG EU  ] ESDP police force recently authorized for [LOC Kosovo  ] , according to [PER Ahern  ] . 
While [LOC Ireland  ] is worried about the repercussions of a unilateral declaration of independence in [LOC Kosovo  ] , [PER Ahern  ] indicated that he sees independence there as inevitable . 
If the [ORG EU  ] decides to recognize an independent [LOC Kosovo  ] , he said , [LOC Ireland  ] will go along ( Ref D ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In a separate discussion on December 20 with [PER Jim Kelly  ] , Director , [ORG Europe Division  ] , [ORG Department of Foreign Affairs  ] , [PER Kelly  ] told [ORG POLOFF  ] that assessments of the legality of continuing the pre-December 10 mandate had been positive . 
He indicated that the door was now open for [ORG UN  ] Secretary General Ban to signal a green light for the ESDP policing mission . 
[PER Kelly  ] commented on meetings that Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Ahern  ] and he had held about November 9 in [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Serbia  ] with Kosovar Prime Minister-elect [PER Hashim Thaci  ] and [MISC Serbian  ] Prime Minister [PER Vojislav Kostunica  ] . 
[PER Kelly  ] characterized both leaders as wary of precipitous action . 
In spite of [PER Thaci  ] 's public rhetoric , [PER Kelly  ] noted that [PER Thaci  ] was privately talking about " managed " independence rather than a " unilateral declaration " of independence . 
Similarly , [PER Kelly  ] said that [PER Kostunica  ] indicated he was not willing to use military force to retain [LOC Kosovo  ] , though [PER Kostunica  ] said he would utilize any measure short of military action , including an economic blockade . 
Conflict Resolution Unit ( [ORG CRU  ] ) ------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] revealed that the Government has decided to focus the efforts of the newly formed [ORG CRU  ] , which is housed in the [ORG Department of Foreign Affairs  ] , on [LOC East Timor  ] . 
He indicated that the Government of [LOC East Timor  ] is favorably disposed to the intervention , in part because of good relations built up with [ORG Timorese Government  ] officials during [MISC Irish  ] troop engagements in the past . 
[PER Ahern  ] reiterated that he would welcome collaborative Irish/U.S. conflict resolution initiatives there . 
( Comment: [PER Ahern  ] will lead a team to [LOC Dili  ] in February or March 2008 . 
[ORG Embassy Dublin  ] will liaise with [ORG Embassy Dili  ] to arrange meetings for [PER Ahern  ] with Ambassador [ORG Klemm  ] and other [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
End comment . 
) [ORG Reform Treaty Referendum  ] ------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Emphasizing that the Government of [LOC Ireland  ] is calling the [ORG EU  ] treaty the " [ORG Reform " Treaty  ] rather than the " [LOC Lisbon  ] " [ORG Treaty  ] , [PER Ahern  ] indicated that the constitutionally mandated referendum would likely be held during the first half of 2008 and would be linked with a referendum on a constitutional amendment on children 's rights ( Ref E ) . 
He predicted a hard battle , which , he said , would be joined by treaty opponents from across [LOC Europe  ] . 
He said that in spite of the fact that the [MISC Irish  ] people are generally supportive of the [ORG EU  ] and the [ORG Reform Treaty  ] , getting out the " yes " vote might be a problem . 
Pre-Clearance Agreement ----------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] indicated that he had reviewed the draft DHS agreement to establish a full [LOC U.S.  ] pre-clearance facility in [LOC DUBLIN  ] 00000916 003 OF 003 [LOC Ireland  ] ( Ref C ) . 
He was generally supportive of the proposed agreement , calling it " significant and practical . 
" Nonetheless , he was skeptical of certain provisions , e.g. , that [LOC Ireland  ] would be responsible for any radioactive waste discovered , and predicted that the draft agreement would be much altered after the [MISC Irish  ] Attorney General reviewed the document . 
[MISC Cuban  ] Refugees -------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Foley  ] thanked [PER Ahern  ] for the [MISC Irish  ] Government 's willingness to accept ten [MISC Cuban  ] refugees currently encamped at [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
( Note: A team from the [ORG Irish Ministry of Justice  ] visited [LOC Guantanamo  ] the week of December 10 and identified the refugees who will be settled in [LOC Ireland  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Ahern  ] 's view of the post-Castro future of [LOC Cuba  ] was uncertain ; he indicated that [LOC Ireland  ] would be guided by the [ORG EU  ] on future relations with the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Government  ] . 
[PER St. Patrick  ] 's Day Bilateral --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [PER Ahern  ] advised the Ambassador that he and the [ORG Department should  ] liaise with Ambassador [PER Michael Collins  ] in [LOC Washington  ] in planning the 2008 [PER St. Patrick  ] 's Day bilateral . 
While [PER Ahern  ] agreed that , in light of the progress in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] , the format of the bilateral could be somewhat revised ( such as the stations of the cross ) , he noted that the shamrock ceremony , which has a long tradition , should not be altered . 
Undocumented [MISC Irish  ] ------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] once again raised the [MISC Irish  ] [ORG Government  ] 's concern about the status of [MISC Irish  ] illegal aliens in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( Ref A ) . 
He said that political opponents are accusing the [ORG Government  ] of ignoring the problem , when , in fact , there is nothing the [ORG Government  ] can do influence [LOC U.S.  ] immigration policy . 
He asked the Ambassador to meet separately with opposition leaders to explain the [ORG U.S. Government  ] 's position . 
Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Ahern  ] genuinely welcomed the Ambassador . 
He appeared engaged , warm , and open , acting as if he had all the time in the world . 
Such demeanor is a measure of the importance the [MISC Irish  ] attach to the bilateral relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC FOLEY</pre></code>  ]
