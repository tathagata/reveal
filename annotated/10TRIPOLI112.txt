2 . 
( C ) On February 7 , a [MISC Libyan  ] tax court issued a " not guilty " verdict to [PER Rachid Hamdani  ] , one of two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen detained in [LOC Libya  ] since July 2007 . 
[MISC Swiss  ] Charge [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] confirmed that following [PER Hamdani  ] 's successful January 27 appeal in the [ORG Immigration Court  ] ( reftel ) , [PER Hamdani  ] is officially cleared of all legal charges the [MISC Libyan  ] government has held against him . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] Embassy and [PER Hamdani  ] 's [MISC Libyan  ] lawyer are working to determine what other " conditions " must be fulfilled in order for [PER Hamdani  ] to leave the country , as the [ORG GOL  ] is still holding [PER Hamdani  ] 's passport . 
3 . 
( C ) The [PER Hamdani  ] verdict came a day after the same [MISC Libyan  ] tax court fined the other [MISC Swiss  ] businessman , [PER Max Goeldi  ] , 1000 [MISC Libyan  ] Dinar ( approximately [MISC US$801  ] ) for violating [MISC Libyan  ] tax laws . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] said that [PER Goeldi  ] does not intend to appeal that decision . 
He reported that [PER Goeldi  ] 's appeals trial before the immigration court , which was postponed for unclear reasons last week , had been rescheduled for this Thursday , February 11 .

( C ) [PER Lazarotto  ] noted that the political track continues to move forward in [LOC Bern  ] . 
According to [PER Lazarotto  ] , the [MISC Libyans  ] and [MISC Swiss  ] have been in " continuous talks " via [LOC Germany  ] over the past few weeks . 
While they have not yet achieved resolution on all points of disagreement , they are slowly moving toward normalization . 
One sign of progress is that the [MISC Libyans  ] issued the new [MISC Swiss  ] Vice Consul a two-year , multiple entry visa and a residency permit . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] believes that the [MISC Libyans  ] want to give [LOC Switzerland  ] the capacity to issue visas as soon as normalization is achieved . 
The first piece of normalization will be the visa policy , and the [MISC Swiss  ] are ready to begin issuing Schengen visas as soon as the [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen are allowed to leave the country and an agreement is signed . 
Official and working visas will be their first priority issuances . 
They expect to begin processing 40 visa applications per day and to gradually increase to the previous average of 70-80 applications per day . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Lazarotto  ] 's latest comments suggest that the [MISC Swiss  ] are anxious to end the [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen saga and have directly mapped out a solution for the [MISC Libyans  ] -- release the two [MISC Swiss  ] and the visa hold will be lifted . 
The series of positive court rulings over the last few weeks indicate that the [MISC Libyans  ] are willing to work within those parameters . 
Now that the [ORG GOL  ] has no legal reason to keep [PER Hamdani  ] in the country , the coming days will tell whether [LOC Libya  ] intends to fulfill its end of the bargain .
