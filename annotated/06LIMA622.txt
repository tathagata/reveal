( S ) SUMMARY . 
[ORG National Intelligence Directorate  ] Chief [PER Julio Raygada  ] sees [ORG SL  ] as collaborating with the narcotics trade , but does not consider the Senderistas to be simply " narco-terrorists ; " he asserts that the group remains ideologically focused in its activities . 
[PER Raygada  ] points out that in recent fatal attacks , [ORG SL  ] employed its traditional tactic of using a temporary strike force that fades back to civilian cover . 
He believes [ORG SL  ] intends to use this technique to increase the pace of its " popular war " through selective assassinations and armed take-overs of villages , eventually carrying its struggle from the countryside to the cities . 
There is increased [ORG SL  ] political activity throughout the country , including reinvigoration of regional committees , and infiltration of vulnerable institutions . 
[ORG SL  ] is thriving militarily by preying on economic activity in [LOC Peru  ] 's interior , not just from protecting narcotics trafficking , but also through bribes from illegal loggers , fuel smugglers , fruit growers and sugar producers . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador received a briefing on 1/26 from [MISC DINI  ] ( [ORG National Intelligence Directorate  ] ) Chief Admiral ( R ) [PER Julio Raygada  ] on the organization and current direction of [ORG Sendero Luminoso  ] ( [ORG SL  ] ) . 
[PER Raygada  ] had served as the Acting Director of [ORG National Intelligence for over  ] a year while [LOC Peru  ] 's intelligence systems were undergoing reorganization , and he became the permanent [MISC DINI  ] head after the regulations on [LOC Peru  ] 's new [ORG National Intelligence System  ] ( [ORG SINA  ] ) were published in the [MISC Official Gazette  ] on January 4 . 
On 2/2 , [PER Raygada  ] gave D/Polcouns an expanded version of the [ORG SL  ] briefing , the salient points of which follow. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Although he stressed at the outset that he does not equate [LOC Peru  ] 's situation with [LOC Colombia  ] 's , [PER Raygada  ] expressed concern about the growth of coca cultivation here . 
[MISC DINI  ] believes that coca cultivation has grown from 44,000 hectares in 2004 to 56,000 hectares currently . 
In addition , the density of cultivation has increased , especially in non-traditional areas , meaning that the potential for cocaine production in [LOC Peru  ] has increased by an even greater margin . 
Traffickers export coca paste and cocaine with relative ease using medium to large ocean-going vessels , departing in many cases from the southern coast of [LOC Peru  ] . 
Areas of intense coca cultivation , in particular the [LOC Monzon Valley  ] , have become in essence liberated areas , with little state presence . 
Groups with political agendas , not just [ORG SL  ] but also [PER Ollanta Humala  ] 's [ORG Nationalist Party  ] and the [ORG Peruvian Communist Party  ] , are attempting to portray themselves as the advocates of coca producers. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Although [PER Raygada  ] sees [ORG SL  ] as collaborating with the narcotics trade in ways that are similar to [LOC Colombia  ] 's [ORG FARC  ] , he does not believe that the Senderistas have morphed into " narco-terrorists . 
" He thinks instead that [ORG SL  ] continues to adhere to many of its own distinct tactics and long-term objectives . 
[ORG SL  ] does not maintain a uniformed standing army . 
[ORG SL  ] tactics in recent fatal attacks ( Refs ) have tended even more toward their traditional approach of putting together a temporary strike force that carries out an operation and goes back to civilian cover . 
[ORG SL  ] intends to use this technique to increase the pace of its " popular war , " eventually carrying this struggle from the countryside to the cities . 
There are indications that [ORG Sendero  ] is reviving its practice of selective assassinations , and of armed take-overs of villages to capture and gather information on opponents. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG SL  ] is also undergoing renewed efforts to fortify its infrastructure and bases of support . 
10,057 persons accused or convicted of terrorist activity were released from jail between 1982 and 2005 , and many have retained their connection with [ORG SL  ] . 
[PER Raygada  ] believes that [ORG SL  ] has 2,000 active members at present , although just a few hundred are armed combatants . 
[ORG SL  ] documents recently seized by the police refer to the group 's historic and doctinaire view of their struggle to come to power . 
The documents make reference to the " Fight on Two [MISC Fronts  ] " ( i.e. armed and political , abbreviated as L2L in [MISC Spanish  ] ) , and to passing into the " [MISC Fourth Phase  ] " ( NFI ) of [ORG SL  ] 's revolution against the [ORG Peruvian State.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [ORG SL  ] 's political strategy is to organize " pockets " of activity: reinvigorated regional committees in the north , south , central highlands , [LOC Huallaga Valley  ] and metropolitan [LOC Lima  ] ; " popular committees " engaged in fund-raising in 70 villages throughout the coca zone ; control of [ORG Peruvian Popular Aid  ] ( [ORG Socorro Popular del Peru  ] ) , an NGO that was initially created to support families of prisoners ; infiltration of rural peasant patrols ( groups originally created to oppose [ORG Sendero  ] ) in coca-growing areas ; infiltration of the radio broadcast industry , in particular in the northern cone of [LOC Lima  ] ; and positioning members in key positions in universities and in the national teachers union . 
[PER Raygada  ] also alleged that NGOs such as the [ORG Legal Defense Institute  ] ( [ORG IDL  ] ) and Living Justice ( [PER Justicia Viva  ] ) , which have received [MISC Embassy  ] funding support , are knowing advocates of [LOC Sendero.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Militarily , the [ORG SL  ] combatants in the north ( [LOC Huallaga Valley  ] ) are well organized in columns [ORG SL  ] refers to as " mobile networks " of 12 to 30 individuals . 
These groups prey upon the economic activity ( licit and illicit ) along the [MISC Belaunde  ] and [ORG Basadre Highways  ] . 
There are three different groups of [ORG SL  ] combatants in the south ( [PER Apurimac  ] and [PER Ene Valleys  ] ) . 
These groups are more widely separated than those in the north , and tend to live in jungle camps , rather than under cover in villages ( as in the north ) . 
Besides " assessments " ( cupos ) for protecting narcotics trafficking , the [ORG SL  ] combatants in both regions receive money from illegal loggers , fuel smugglers , fruit growers and sugar producers . 
[ORG DINI  ] recently received information that [ORG SL  ] had gotten $10,000 ( possibly a loan ) from the [ORG Peruvian Communist Party  ] . 
[ORG DINI  ] believes [ORG SL  ] has also solicited funds from the [ORG FARC  ] .
