FOR S/CT - AMB.DAILEY AND EUR EO 12958 DECL: 04/14/2018 TAGS PREL , PGOV , [LOC PTER  ] , [LOC UK  ] SUBJECT: PROPOSALS FOR AMBASSADOR’S CT FUND REF: STATE 20081 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Robert H. Tuttle  ] for reasons 1 . 
4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Embassy London  ] welcomes the offer made by S/CT Ambassador [PER Dailey  ] for S/CT to consider granting funds of up to 50,000 USD to support projects to counter violent extremist ideology . 
[ORG Embassy London  ] submits the following two proposals: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC REVERSE RADICALISM: Working  ] with [ORG Her Majesty’s Government  ] , the [ORG Embassy  ] would contract an [MISC American  ] academic to carry out a study of those individuals currently residing in the [LOC United Kingdom  ] who allege they were once on the path to radicalization and terrorism but stepped back from it . 
These include the noteworthy number of individuals who have come forward to work on counter radicalization in the wake of the publication of “the Islamist” by [PER Ed Hussein  ] . 
Many of these individuals say they were radicalized on the streets and in the mosques of [LOC London  ] in the 1990s and now wish to work to use that experience to encourage [MISC British  ] youth not to become radicalized . 
Post believes the [LOC UK  ] is unique in the number of its former radical [MISC Islamists  ] and their increasingly public profile . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] and [ORG HMG  ] are aware of other , similar individuals who have begun to speak of their experience but are not yet known to the general public and may , or may not , be dedicated to using their knowledge to dissuade [MISC British  ] youth from supporting terrorism or extremist ideology . 
[ORG Embassy  ] would coordinate with appropriate [ORG HMG  ] officials on gaining access to individuals known to [ORG HMG  ] who would be useful participants . 
The purpose of the survey would be to: 1 ) attempt to quantify how many of these individuals are known by the [ORG Embassy  ] , [ORG HMG  ] and [MISC British  ] NGOs and think tanks now engaged in the study of radicalization ; 2 ) create a pool of individuals that could serve as a source of information on radicalization in the [LOC UK  ] -- its causes and what they believe will work to deflate it ; 3 ) evaluate whether there is a common history which explains why these individuals stepped back from terrorism which is potentially applicable outside the [LOC UK  ] context in the [LOC U.S.  ] and elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] . 
4 ) determine which of these individuals we might use to support counterterrorism efforts and how best to use them. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Embassy  ] estimates costs for the [MISC Reverse Radicalism  ] project to be 43,000 USD to cover travel costs ( including airfare , lodging , M&IE , honorarium , and local transportation ) and research expenses including phone calls . 
Funds not spent on the [MISC Reverse Radicalism  ] project ( should the [ORG Embassy  ] and [ORG HMG  ] not find a qualified individual to carry out the study , should the sample size prove smaller than anticipated , or should S/CT prefer not to allocate funds to the [MISC Reverse Radicalism  ] project ) would be dedicated to [ORG Embassy  ] participation in the [ORG Ramadan Festival UK.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG RAMADAN  ] FESTIVAL UK: Based on the highly successful [MISC Dutch  ] model , [ORG Embassy London’s  ] contacts in the [MISC British Muslim  ] community plan on holding a “Ramadan Festival” this year aimed at highlighting the diversity of the [MISC British  ] mainstream . 
The event will help raise the standard of dialogue on extremism and promote understanding between Britain’s [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim communities . 
Part of the festival is a series of “Ramadan Nights , ” focused on bringing together the [MISC British Muslim  ] community in a positive atmosphere of learning and a global sense of community . 
The [ORG Festival  ] has asked the [ORG Embassy  ] to provide an [MISC American Muslim  ] performance group which could appeal to both older and younger audiences. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] proposes to bring the “Allah [MISC Made Me  ] Funny” comedy troupe to the [LOC UK  ] to participate in the [ORG Festival  ] , building on the unparalleled success we achieved with their [LOC UK  ] program last fall . 
Their appeal in not restricted on an particular age group of background , and the message their performance would send , of [MISC American  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , proud to be both “American” and “Muslim” is a powerful message that would open [MISC British Muslim  ] eyes to [MISC American  ] cultural and religious diversity as well as encourage reflection on the part of [MISC British Muslim  ] community in a positive , self-defining direction . 
Our expected outcome would be to reach thousand of [MISC British  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , including the disproportionately high youth population , with these positive messages . 
[LOC LONDON  ] 00001113 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
S/CT funds , should they be dedicated to the [ORG RAMADAN  ] FESTIVAL [LOC UK  ] would be allocated to cover travel costs ( including airfare , lodging , M&IE , honorarium , and local transportation ) for the [MISC Allah Made Me  ] Funny group . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] estimates cost for bringing the “Allah [MISC Made Me  ] Funny” troupe to the [LOC UK  ] to be 39,000 USD .
