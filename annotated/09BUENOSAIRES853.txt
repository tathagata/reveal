REF: [LOC BUENOS AIRES  ] 0827 Classified By: [ORG CDA  ] Tom [PER Kelly  ] for reasons b , d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary/Introduction . 
The devastating setback dealt by [MISC Argentine  ] voters to the government in the June 28 mid-term elections has restored to respectability last year 's fashionable political forecast -- that [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) will not reach the end of her term as President in 2011 . 
Like last year , some of this conjecture is little more than wishful thinking by the government 's opponents , but not all of it . 
The ruling couple 's political weakness , erratic behavior , looming economic challenges , and [LOC Argentina  ] 's history of truncated presidential terms lead some serious observers to worry about the government 's staying power . 
A larger group of observers , this Mission included , believe that [ORG CFK  ] will probably make it to the end of her term , if only by muddling through ( reftel ) . 
In this report , we evaluate the main arguments behind the proposition that the [PER Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] government will fall and explain why we and others think that , at present , that scenario remains unlikely . 
End Summary/Introduction . 
[PER Kirchner  ] Vulnerability: A [ORG New Phenomenon  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Kirchners'  ] political weakness is still a relatively new phenomenon , dating back to their mishandling of last year 's farm protests . 
In the run-up to the October 2007 presidential elections , public approval ratings for outgoing President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] ( [ORG NK  ] ) went as high as 77% , as [MISC Argentines  ] credited him for the country 's remarkable economic recovery after its 2001-02 economic meltdown . 
Buoyed by her husband 's popularity , [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) easily won the presidency in the first round of the 2007 election . 
With 45% of the vote , she outdistanced her nearest opponent by more than twenty percentage points and doubled the vote received in 2003 by [ORG NK  ] , who was then the little-known governor of remote [PER Santa Cruz  ] . 
The ruling couple 's considerable political capital dissipated last year as a consequence of their confrontation with the farm sector . 
[ORG CFK  ] and [ORG NK  ] 's plummeting poll numbers , their sudden inability to stay ahead of the curve , and their abandonment by many of their allies set the stage for a humiliating [ORG Senate  ] defeat of government legislation that would have ratified the export tax increase at the heart of the controversy one year ago. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) This political rout led to speculation in 2008 that [ORG CFK  ] might fail to reach the end of her term -- which would make her the first elected [MISC Peronist  ] president since the restoration of democracy in 1983 to meet that ignominious fate . 
We even spotted the graffitied question " Se Kae ? 
" ( roughly translated , " Kollapsing ? 
" ) on a few [LOC Buenos Aires  ] walls last year . 
Much of the speculation was fed by the government 's most bitter opponents . 
[PER Diego Guelar  ] , a foreign policy advisor to [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Mayor [PER Mauricio Macri  ] , told a visiting congressional staffer last August that " this government won't last 60 days " -- just minutes after his boss had said that it would . 
But there was concern within government circles . 
A former aide to [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Province Governor [PER Daniel Scioli  ] confided to us recently that he and other colleagues had urged [PER Scioli  ] to break ranks with the [MISC Kirchners  ] last year over the farm controversy . 
[PER Scioli  ] said he wouldn't because " If I do , they'll fall , and I 'm no coup monger . 
" During the farm crisis , the [ORG MFA  ] even took the unusual step of registering its concern with the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Taiana  ] 's Chief of Staff [PER Alberto D'Alotto  ] ( protect ) told a Mission contact in May 2008 that the [ORG MFA  ] was " very concerned " about the government 's staying power . 
The Prophets of [LOC Doom  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the end , the [PER Kirchner  ] government survived the farm crisis and made it into 2009 . 
With its defeat in the June 28 mid-term election , the speculation has returned , though it has not reached last year 's fever pitch . 
( A large majority of analysts do not/not feel that it is the most likely scenario . 
) Those who predict an early exit for the [MISC Kirchners  ] tend to stress to varying degrees the following factors that , in their view , make a [PER Kirchner  ] collapse more likely: -- Political: The [MISC Kirchners'  ] opponents smell blood after the June 28 election and are waiting for the right moment to remove them , abetted by a public that abhors weak leaders ; -- Psychological: The [PER Kirchner  ] psychodrama is contributing to a series of bad decisions that will lead to the first couple 's political demise ; and BUENOS AIR 00000853 002 OF 005 -- [ORG Economic:  ] The ruling couple 's post-election turn to the left dooms them to botch an increasingly difficult economic situation , sweeping [ORG CFK  ] from office . 
Se Kae: Political Arguments and Scenarios ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There are some influential political analysts ( [PER Rosendo Fraga  ] , and with less certainty , [PER Manuel Mora  ] y [PER Araujo  ] ) who believe that this country 's political volatility will cause [ORG CFK  ] 's fall from power . 
[PER Mora  ] y [PER Araujo  ] argues that [MISC Argentine  ] society abhors weak political leadership . 
If [MISC Argentines  ] sense that their ruler is enfeebled , he argues , they tend to collectively say " that 's enough . 
" The consequent withdrawal of support makes the damaged ruler vulnerable to overthrow by the scheming political class . 
The governor of [LOC Tierra del Fuego  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] that [MISC Argentines  ] were " absolutists " in how they viewed politicians as either winners or losers , with no gray areas in between. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Echoing a commonly heard refrain , pollster [PER Doris Capurro  ] adds that the [MISC Argentine  ] press , particularly the dominant [MISC Clarin  ] media group , often serves as " [MISC Coup Central  ] . 
" [MISC Clarin  ] , she said , fomented [PER Fernando de la Rua  ] 's departure from power in 2001 , and its owners are fierce critics of the [MISC Kirchners  ] . 
For their part , most politicians have focused on jockeying for future position , but a few important ones sometimes seem to be circling prey . 
[ORG Civic Coalition  ] leader [PER Elisa Carrio  ] said soon after the [ORG GOA  ] 's mid-term loss that " if [PER Cristina  ] doesn't react within a week , she 's going to have problems governing . 
" Along the same lines , [MISC Radical  ] leader [PER Gerardo Morales  ] said a few days ago that " if the ( current ) dialogue falls apart , the Government will have so little margin for error that anything could happen . 
" Over the weekend , dissident labor leader [PER Luis Barrionuevo  ] said plainly that " I see [PER Julio Cobos  ] finishing [PER Cristina  ] 's term . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fraga  ] argues that the history of [LOC Argentina  ] 's post-dictatorship democracy does not bode well for the [MISC Kirchners  ] . 
Over that 25-year period , three elected governments lost mid-terms . 
The two that were led by Radicals ( [PER Alfonsin  ] in 1987 and de [PER la Rua  ] in 2001 ) did not survive ; the one headed by a [MISC Peronist  ] ( [PER Menem  ] in 1997 ) made it to the term 's end . 
But [PER Fraga  ] thinks that the [MISC Kirchners  ] should take little comfort from [PER Menem  ] 's survival . 
Unlike the [MISC Kirchners  ] , [PER Menem  ] never lost control of the [ORG Congress  ] nor his hold over the [MISC Peronist  ] party . 
Economist [PER Carlos Melconian  ] adds that in 1997 " the economy was doing fine , and economic policy remained on autopilot until the presidential elections two years later . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Fraga  ] thinks that the [MISC Kirchners  ] will fail to change course , leading to the gradual deterioration of their already dire political situation . 
He pointed out that with [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] 's overthrow in [LOC Honduras  ] , [ORG CFK  ] ( with approval ratings around 28% ) is now the elected [MISC Latin American  ] president with the lowest popularity rating in her country . 
According to [PER Fraga  ] , the December 10 seating of the victors of the June 28 election will create a [ORG Congress  ] with the power to remove [ORG CFK  ] from office . 
( [PER Note: Impeachment  ] and removal from presidential office would actually require two-thirds support in each chamber of [ORG Congress  ] , which the opposition -- even after December 10 -- will not have . 
) [PER Fraga  ] believes that [MISC Peronists  ] and forces close to Vice President [PER Julio Cobos  ] will conspire to remove [ORG CFK  ] from office to replace her with [PER Cobos  ] . 
[PER Fraga  ] describes the scenario as perfect for [MISC Peronists  ] -- it removes the [MISC Kirchners  ] from the scene , follows the Constitutional line of succession , and saddles [MISC Radical  ] [PER Cobos  ] with the burden of taking the tough political decisions needed to govern [LOC Argentina  ] in an economic downturn . 
For the non-Peronist opposition , the scenario seems less attractive -- a senior [MISC Radical  ] politician has described it to us as a trap -- but [PER Fraga  ] maintains that the ambitious Vice President has already decided to accept power in such a circumstance. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As for the Kirchners , [PER Fraga  ] claims that they ( especially [PER Nestor  ] ) may see this scenario as their best long-term bet if their political situation deteriorates further . 
They would portray [ORG CFK  ] 's forced removal from office , in this view , as an illegitimate usurpation of the democratic order , enabling them to escape to a sympathetic foreign country as democratic martyrs . 
They would then hope that the situation under [PER Cobos  ] would degenerate into political and economic chaos , helping to set the stage for their eventual political comeback . 
For [PER Fraga  ] , this strategy explains [ORG CFK  ] 's deep interest in the coup against [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] , which took place on the same weekend as her electoral setback . 
It also , he says , means that she will not resign , regardless of how bad the political situation . 
BUENOS AIR 00000853 003 OF 005 Psychodrama: Behavioral Arguments ---------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Other observers stress psychological factors in their prediction of an impending democratic crisis . 
This school of thought has two variants: that strongman [ORG NK  ] is too set in his uncompromising ways to adapt , or that he ( or he and [ORG CFK  ] ) are becoming increasingly erratic and incapable of governing . 
As a well-connected banker told us , the [MISC Kirchners  ] could recover by altering course and embracing a more moderate and consensus-driven course , but [ORG NK  ] in particular is incapable of change . 
Instead , in this view , he will embark on a disastrous jeremiad against internal " traitors " whom he blames for the electoral defeat , leading the government off a cliff . 
In support of this view , [PER Fraga  ] argues that [PER Nestor  ] 's personality " cannot change , " but that [MISC Argentine  ] public opinion has . 
It no longer wants an obdurate fighter as it did when [ORG NK  ] took office in 2003 ; these days , [MISC Argentines  ] want consensual leadership that the Kirchners cannot and will not provide. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to the second variant , [PER Nestor  ] has indeed changed . 
In fact , he 's gone crazy . 
[PER Jorge Brito  ] , once known as " [PER Nestor  ] 's banker , " seems to believe this theory , confiding to the [ORG CDA  ] that [ORG NK  ] appears increasingly obsessive and disinclined to listen to advice . 
" He used to listen to me , " [PER Brito  ] recalled , " but now he doesn't bother . 
" Another banker told us that " [PER Nestor  ] has basically had a nervous breakdown . 
" Economic Arguments: Surf 's Up ----------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some economists and financial market participants stress that economic factors are most likely to lead to the [MISC Kirchners'  ] downfall . 
In the words of economist [PER Carlos Melconian  ] ( a [PER Macri  ] ally ) , " whenever [MISC Argentine  ] governments that came out weakened from mid-term elections faced a deteriorating economic situation , the result was an economic policy that aimed at 's urfing' the economic waves . 
However , the surfing strategy may have to be aborted halfway: the economy may collapse before the date of the presidential elections , as was the case in the [MISC Alfonsin-Menem  ] transition between 1987 and 1989 . 
" In other words , unless [ORG CFK  ] 's government raises its economic policy game , it may face the same bleak fate as the [PER Alfonsin  ] and de [PER la Rua  ] governments. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) But the prospects for more sensible economic policies seem slim , prompting some to suggest that the [ORG GOA  ] will be overwhelmed by the economy 's many problems . 
The [ORG GOA  ] 's economic policy team is an object of derision among serious economists here . 
[PER Miguel Broda  ] complains that " there 's not a single serious macroeconomist on the whole [ORG Economy Ministry  ] staff . 
" Banker [PER Brito  ] described the [ORG GOA  ] to us as " made up of people who can't even add or subtract . 
" He was particularly scathing about [PER Guillermo Moreno  ] , the Internal Commerce Secretary who serves as [ORG NK  ] 's Interventionist in Chief , whom he called a " psychopath " who " thinks he 's a genius " but " is as dumb as the rest of them . 
" [PER Mario Blejer  ] , a former [ORG Central Bank  ] chief and [ORG IMF  ] Officer who reportedly turned down an offer to take over the [ORG Economy Ministry  ] a few weeks ago , told the [ORG CDA  ] that the problem is [PER Nestor  ] 's control over [ORG GOA  ] economic policy . 
According to [PER Blejer  ] , " [PER Nestor  ] knows nothing about economics , and to make matters worse , he thinks he does , so he doesn't listen to advice . 
" This leads to an economic policy framework described by another former [ORG Central Bank  ] president as " autistic . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) These economy-focused pessimists disagree on what the precipitating cause of a government collapse might be . 
The financial community 's leading bear , [ORG Deutsche Bank Argentina  ] 's president [PER Marcelo Blanco  ] , focuses on the possibility of another sovereign default , noting that the [ORG GOA  ] faces several challenging payments in the near-term future , starting with more than [MISC US$  ] two billion in " Boden 2012 " payments that come due in August . 
( According to [PER Blejer  ] , another [MISC US$10.5  ] billion in debt payments awaits the [ORG GOA  ] in 2010 . 
) [PER Blanco  ] told econoff that he thought there was a " high probability " that the economy will spin out of control post-election and the Kirchners will ultimately be unable to govern. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) Political analyst [PER Jorge Castro  ] stresses the government 's fiscal situation as the [MISC Kirchners' Achilles  ] heel . 
The [ORG GOA  ] , he argues , is ungovernable without a fiscal surplus . 
If the central government 's fiscal accounts fall into deficit , he said , the government could collapse . 
The Kirchners , in particular , have relied on their discretionary BUENOS AIR 00000853 004 OF 005 control of federal revenue sharing to keep governors and mayors in line . 
If the [ORG GOA  ] starts suffering cash flow problems , it could encounter political turbulence and have to contend with rebellious governors . 
[PER Brito  ] worries that radicalization of the regime 's economic agenda could be the straw that breaks the camel 's back . 
If [ORG NK  ] pursues more radical economic measures , such as pursuing new nationalizations , he told us , the [ORG GOA  ] 's core of support would shrink from 30 to 15% percent of the population , setting the stage for its abrupt demise . 
Another economist , [PER Orlando Ferreres  ] , suggests that in such a scenario the [MISC Peronists  ] would be the ones who depose [ORG CFK  ] , reasoning that " no one is more conservative than a frightened [MISC Peronist  ] . 
" Why We Think [MISC CFK Will Make  ] It to 2011 ------------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C/NF ) This recompilation of many arguments making the rounds about the durability of [ORG CFK  ] 's regime is not intended to create the impression that the government is doomed . 
At the [MISC Mission  ] , we believe that [ORG CFK  ] will remain president until December 2011 , and that remains the opinion of most of our interlocutors here -- a motley crew that includes anti-Kirchneristas like [PER Eduardo Duhalde  ] and [PER Mauricio Macri  ] , press moguls like [PER Clarin  ] managing director [PER Jose Aranda  ] , and former [PER Kirchner Cabinet  ] chief [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] . 
We recently wrote a cable ( reftel ) on the reasons why we thought that a muddling-through scenario was most likely . 
Rather than recapitulating all of those arguments here , we outline the main political and economic factors supporting the contention that [ORG CFK  ] will remain president until 2011. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C/NF ) Our best-connected contacts in the political establishment tell us that the focus is on the 2011 presidential election , not coup plotting . 
A key [PER Macri  ] aide tells us that the main contenders for the 2011 election -- his boss , [PER Carlos Reutemann  ] , and [PER Hermes Binner  ] , to name a few -- have predicated their planning on [ORG CFK  ] making it to the end of her term . 
None find taking the reins at a time of economic crisis particularly appealing , and [ORG CFK  ] 's premature departure could undermine their respective strategies for making it to the [PER Casa Rosada  ] in 2011 , when the economy should be stronger . 
The preferences of these frontrunners are critical , because in the wake of the June 28 elections , they influence other political actors. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/NF ) To further complicate the lives of would-be coup plotters , [ORG CFK  ] is a [MISC Peronist  ] . 
The fractious [MISC Peronist  ] establishment , though undoubtedly disgruntled with the Kirchners , is unlikely to end [ORG CFK  ] 's term if those efforts could redound to the benefit of non-Peronist politicians . 
Political analyst [PER Mora y Araujo  ] notes that , since 1983 , [MISC Peronist  ] presidents have proven far harder to dislodge from office before the end of their term than non-Peronists . 
We would also point out that the Kirchners' forte is tactical -- they are generally more nimble and adroit than their rivals and opponents . 
That said , [ORG NK  ] is also a high-stakes gambler , often betting heavily on the element of surprise in dealing with his adversaries . 
Given his penchant for unpredictability , he could easily over-play his hand one of these days , and one of his " surprise " moves may backfire on him. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C/NF ) The fear factor also plays in [ORG CFK  ] 's favor . 
Opposition politicians from both the right ( [PER Mauricio Macri  ] ) and center-left ( [MISC Radical  ] leader [PER Oscar Aguad  ] ) tell us that [MISC Argentines  ] remember the chaos that followed [PER Fernando de la Rua  ] 's departure from office in December 2001 , and are not anxious to repeat the experience . 
[PER Macri  ] told a visiting [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senate  ] staffer last year that [MISC Argentines  ] would be " happy " for the Kirchners to fall ( " if this glass of water was the [ORG Kirchners  ] , everyone would fight to push it over " ) except for one thing -- they fear that the government 's collapse would risk a return to bedlam . 
[MISC Argentines  ] also seem impassive or unmoved by outrageous cases of corruption or other developments that elsewhere would have caused major scandals ( " valijagate " comes to mind ) , making us wonder what it would take to get people into the streets . 
Most Think that the [ORG Economy Won't Push CFK from Office  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Most of [LOC Argentina  ] 's best economists think that the economic situation will not force the [ORG Kirchners  ] from office . 
Many post contacts believe that the peso exchange rate is a barometer for popular confidence in the government . 
The fact that the [ORG GOA  ] has been able to manage a deliberate , controlled devaluation of the peso for over eight months without a major run on the dollar , even after the June 28 electoral setback , argues for a stable outlook . 
The notion that the economy BUENOS AIR 00000853 005 OF 005 will bring the [ORG Kirchners  ] down ultimately rests on the premise that the government will lack the funds to meet its internal and external obligations . 
For over two years we have been hearing dire forecasts of an impending , overwhelming fiscal crunch just around the corner . 
However , two of our best contacts -- [PER Javier Alvaredo  ] , General Manager of [ORG BICE Bank  ] , and [PER Juan Carlos Barboza  ] , the [ORG Central Bank  ] 's foreign exchange chief -- tell us with some confidence that the [ORG GOA  ] will be able to meet its obligations . 
On the external debt payments front , both of them said independently that the [ORG GOA  ] will have enough funds to meet debt payments in 2009 and 2010 . 
They argue that 2010 will be easier than 2009 because no GDP warrant payment will come due ( there is a big one in December 2009 ) . 
The market , as measured by country risk ratings and bond indices , does not seem spooked. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Our contacts also tell us that the [ORG GOA  ] is unlikely to run out of money before [ORG CFK  ] 's term ends . 
A contact in the [ORG Economy Ministry  ] 's [ORG Finance Secretariat  ] insists that the [ORG GOA  ] will meet its 2009 financing needs from public sector resources ( e.g. , the recent nationalization of private pension funds , which gives the [ORG GOA  ] a huge pile of money to work with ) ; inflows from [ORG International Financial Institutions  ] like the [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG IDB  ] ; and liability management ( buybacks , exchanges , etc . 
) . <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There is also room for adjustment on the expenditure side . 
Economist [PER Daniel Marx  ] notes that the government 's decision to move the mid-term election to June 28 means that its pre-electoral spending spree was relatively brief this year , which will make it easier for the new Economy Minister [PER Amado Boudou  ] to reduce outlays for the balance of this year and next . 
[PER Marx  ] thinks that social spending and subsidies will plummet now that the election is over , easing fiscal pressure on the government ( though he admits that other pressures , such as transfer payments to the provinces demanded by increasingly assertive and desperate governors , will increase ) . <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C/NF ) Ultimately , popular support for , or tolerance of , the [ORG Kirchners  ] rides on Argentines' relative sense of well-being . 
Barring another bout of hyper-inflation or government confiscation of savings or sudden uptick in unemployment , many [MISC Argentines  ] are disinclined to rock the boat for now . 
[LOC Argentina  ] is no stranger to nationwide general strikes that have paralyzed the country ; it is a huge boon for the [ORG Kirchners  ] that , for now , the bulk of organized labor ( historically co-dependent on the [MISC Peronists  ] ) remains in their pockets. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C/NF ) Finally , time is probably on the Kirchners' side . 
Though the economy is currently in bad shape , [LOC Argentina  ] 's impressive human capital and natural resources will drive an eventual rebound . 
[LOC Argentina  ] 's debt levels are manageable , its return on capital high , and it enjoys several strong sectors ( agriculture , mining , high tech ) as well as a relatively competitive industrial sector and decent market size . 
This means that if the [ORG Kirchners  ] make it to the middle of next year , with the external environment improving and some attractive presidential candidates in the mix for the 2011 race , the proximity of the post-Kirchner era may by itself reverse capital inflows and jump-start a robust recovery -- which paradoxically could significantly reduce the chances that [ORG CFK  ] will be removed from office prematurely . 
A Word on the [ORG Psychological Theory  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C/NF ) As for the argument that the ruling couple 's precarious psyches will lead to their fall from power , suffice it to say that this argument is highly speculative and anecdotal . 
Few people maintain that the president and her husband , both well into their fifties , have changed much over the past two years . 
As [MISC Fraga  ] notes , it is [LOC Argentina  ] that has changed , not them . 
That seems like a good ( partial ) explanation for why the [ORG Kirchners  ] fared poorly and misplayed their hand in the mid-terms , but it does not necessarily mean that it will prevent [ORG CFK  ] from reaching the end of her term . 
After all , the [ORG Kirchners  ] have been abrasive , impervious to outside advice , and even paranoid through more than six years of presidential power , and they're still in the [PER Casa Rosada  ] . 
As long as the political establishment remains focused on the next presidential race and the economy doesn't suffer a meltdown , we expect that 's where the [ORG Kirchners  ] will stay until December 2011 .
