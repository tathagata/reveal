Cretz  ] , Ambassador , US Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Libya  ] 's hosting of the 13th [ORG African Union Summit  ] faced myriad troubles from both political and logistical standpoints , but last-minute developments on both fronts helped [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat . 
On [ORG AU  ] business , the headlines were often more impressive than the substance: the much-heralded push for [MISC African  ] unity took a symbolic step forward , while allowing states to stall on implementation ; and member states reiterated their call to have the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] indictment against [LOC Sudan  ] 's President [PER Bashir  ] -- though there was no agreement for the 30 [MISC African  ] parties to the court to withdraw . 
A potential walk-out by [MISC Western  ] diplomats was averted when [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] cancelled his trip to the [ORG Summit  ] 's opening at the eleventh hour . 
That [LOC Libya  ] was able to house and feed all attendees was a minor miracle , enabled by the hosts paying hefty sums on hospitality on the eve of the [ORG Summit  ] . 
The pageantry was likely aimed at currying favor with [MISC African  ] guests , while providing a not-so-subtle reminder of [LOC Libya  ] 's oil wealth for countries hesitant to join with al-Qadhafi 's aggrandizing vision of unification but equally wary of losing out on [LOC Libya  ] 's dinar diplomacy . 
End Summary . 
LIBYA'S OUTCOMES FROM THE SUMMIT -- WHERE'S THE BEEF ? 2 . 
( C ) [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's chairmanship of the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) [ORG Assembly  ] has from the start served as a platform for the [MISC Libyan  ] leader to burnish his international credentials and cement his position as a self-proclaimed " man of history " . 
In a year flush with symbolic milestones -- the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought him to power , the 10th anniversary of the [ORG Sirte Proclamation  ] leading to the formation of the [ORG African Union  ] , [LOC Libya  ] 's seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , and senior [MISC Libyan  ] diplomat [PER Ali Treiki  ] 's presidency of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] all align in September -- al-Qadhafi has vigorously pursued his vision of a " [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Africa  ] " to secure his spot in the pantheon of great leaders . 
The push for unity , however , has been light on technical details and implementation . 
The 13th Ordinary [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG AU  ] heads of state held July 1-3 in [MISC Sirte  ] offered the unpredictable al-Qadhafi a " home-field advantage " to exert greater pressure on leaders to pay lip service to his continental ambitions . 
3 . 
( C ) With his usual predilection toward controversy , al-Qadhafi made waves with his choices of invited guests . 
Embattled [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] 's scheduled but unfulfilled speaking role caused [MISC Western  ] diplomats to scramble for guidance on how to react to expected rants against foreign intervention in [LOC Iran  ] . 
( [PER Note: Poloff  ] saw several members of [MISC Libyan  ] protocol guiding [MISC Iranian  ] officials around the [ORG Summit  ] venue on June 30 and members of the [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] delegations reported that [MISC Iranian  ] officials were booked on the same cruise ship in which they had sought accommodation . 
End Note . 
) [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Hosni Mubarak  ] was also a last-minute cancellation , as the [MISC Egyptian  ] Ambassador waited at [LOC Sirte  ] airport expecting his arrival until at least 10am on July 1 . 
During open sessions , al-Qadhafi 's remarks were uncharacteristically brief , though his talking points were suitably delivered by a [MISC Ghanaian  ] representative of the " traditional kings " of [LOC Africa  ] , who called on the assembled to unify [LOC Africa  ] per al-Qadhafi 's vision . 
4 . 
( C ) While the [ORG Summit  ] was ostensibly aimed at agricultural development and food security in [LOC Africa  ] , nearly all delegations arrived expecting a continuation of al-Qadhafi 's forceful push for a supranational [ORG African Authority  ] . 
After two days of closed-door session with little progress toward securing al-Qadhafi 's agenda , several [MISC Tripoli-based  ] ambassadors of [ORG AU  ] member states told [PER Poloff  ] that they had been told to expect late-night meetings with the Leader on the evening of July 2.The [MISC Egyptian  ] Ambassador told us that night that he expected that Libyan-sponsored initiatives for unity and withdrawal from the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) would fail if al-Qadhafi was unable to propose a face-saving , compromise position . 
5 . 
( C ) Talks with delegation heads and a 14-hour final session apparently led to such a compromise . 
Press reports announced " milestone " decisions toward unity and a strong rebuke of the [ORG ICC  ] . 
However , the final draft of a decision to form an [ORG AU Authority  ] to replace the current secretariat provides little by way of detail and leaves an opportunity to leave the agreement unimplemented while still allowing al-Qadhafi to claim a measured victory . 
Diplomats from [ORG AU  ] countries in [LOC Tripoli  ] said the [MISC Libyans  ] " invented " decisions taken at the April Extraordinary [ORG Summit  ] to make unity a " fait accompli " and derided [PER Qadhafi  ] 's vision for unity as " a dream that is out of touch with the needs of [MISC Africans  ] " . 
Several observer delegations obtained early drafts of an [ORG ICC  ] motion that called on member states to not cooperate with the [ORG Court  ] . 
The final vote , however , did [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000570 002.2 OF 002 not/not call on [ORG States Party  ] to withdraw from the [LOC Rome  ] Statute and called for non-cooperation only in the case of [LOC Sudan  ] 's President [PER Bashir  ] . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] 's heavy-handed tactics left several delegations bristling , with [MISC South African  ] President [PER Jacob Zuma  ] and [MISC Botswanaian  ] Vice President [PER Merafhe  ] publicly deriding the Leader 's stewardship of the [ORG Summit  ] and expressing doubt that the agreements would amount to progress toward unity . 
Other business , including a resolution calling on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] to impose sanctions on [LOC Eritrea  ] for its support of al-Shabaab , was reportedly shepherded by the [ORG AU Commission  ] and not/not the [MISC Libyan  ] hosts . 
SUMMIT PLANNING: ALMOST PERFECT , BUT NOT QUITE 6 . 
( C ) From the beginning , it was clear that [MISC Libyan  ] officials sought to promote a [MISC Qadhafi-centric  ] dog-and-pony show vice the [ORG Summit  ] 's stated goals of Agriculture and [ORG Infrastructure Development  ] . 
Diplomatic missions in [LOC Tripoli  ] were given various moving dates for when " everything about the [ORG Summit  ] " would be explained . 
A June 17 meeting to explain logistics attended by dozens of ambassadors ended abruptly when the [ORG Summit Organizing Committee  ] chair left the dais to answer a phone call without providing details to the assembled diplomats . 
The [MISC Beninese  ] ambassador , who had been given the microphone to ask a question , repeated " I demand to be acknowledged by the [ now absent ] chair " for at least five minutes while the rest of the crowd filed out . 
7 . 
( C ) On a June 20 tour of [ORG Sirte  ] , it was clear that neither detail nor substance had featured prominently in [MISC Libyan  ] planning . 
Apartments reserved for delegations ( and planned for handover as public housing after the [ORG Summit  ] ) were in various stages of construction and no provision had been made for food , transportation to [ORG Sirte  ] ( a six-hour drive from [LOC Tripoli  ] ) , or ground transportation during the [ORG Summit  ] . 
Hotels and villas reserved for [MISC African  ] heads of state and ministers , on the other hand , were prominently shown to assuage [MISC African  ] embassies that their delegations would be accommodated in opulence befitting [LOC Libya  ] 's comfortable financial position . 
Delegations arriving during the [ORG Peace and Security Commission  ] meeting June 24-26 or the Ministerial meetings on June 28-30 reported that food was difficult to locate , with one delegate informing [ORG USAU  ] colleagues that she had slept in a chair for the first two nights of the proceedings . 
8 . 
( C ) By the afternoon of June 30 , however , [MISC Libyan  ] officials apparently decided to open the purse strings to complete all last-minute details . 
Light shows , electronic signs , and free food met attendant pomp as heads of state arrived in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Shuttle jets between [LOC Tripoli  ] and [ORG Sirte  ] began operations , bringing in planeloads of foreign diplomats and " traditional [MISC African  ] kings " . 
Foreign workers abounded: hundreds of [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Greek  ] hospitality staff manned kitchens , buffets , temporary coffee tents , and floating hotels . 
One waiter told [PER Poloff  ] that he had been notified of his travel to [LOC Libya  ] less than 24 hours before getting on a plane to [ORG Sirte  ] . 
Throughout the conference , foreign laborers continued public works projects near delegation lodging sites , including paving sidewalks and building beachfronts . 
9 . 
( C ) Comment: That [LOC Libya  ] did not suffer the embarrassment of public derision for their handling of the [ORG AU Summit  ] is a testament to the power of its purse . 
[MISC African  ] delegations were well cared for -- ministers and heads of state were housed in expansive villas . 
Observers lived in a much more [MISC Spartan  ] manner , on foam beds in public housing flats . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's goal of catering to its [MISC African  ] guests likely served a dual purpose: currying favor with [MISC African  ] leaders while not-to-subtly reminding them of [LOC Libya  ] 's wealth . 
At the same time , the [ORG Sirte  ] venue allowed the [ORG GOL  ] to " hold hostage " delegations reluctant to go along with al-Qadhafi 's aggrandizing vision . 
In the end , [LOC Libya  ] 's last-minute preparations may have been a blessing in disguise ; many [MISC African  ] delegations indicated that they decided to focus on bilateral meetings due to pessimism on the official agenda . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] summit experience is one we may see again , as some [ORG GOL  ] interlocutors have begun laying the groundwork for yet another Extraordinary [ORG Summit  ] , to be held coincident to the 40th anniversary of the [PER Qadhafi  ] revolution , which will be marked September 1 .
