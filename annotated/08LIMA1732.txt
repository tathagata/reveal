END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG NEA A/S Welch  ] , accompanied by DCM , met with FM [MISC Moratinos  ] , Director General for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] , [LOC Magreb  ] and [ORG Near Orient  ] [PER Fidel Sendagorta  ] , and [ORG Policy Planning  ] Director [PER Andres Ortega  ] on October 23 to discuss a wide range of issues including the [LOC Middle East Peace Process ( MEPP  ] ) , the [LOC Magreb  ] , and [LOC Western Sahara  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
[MISC Moratinos'  ] staff had warned in advance that scheduling issues would allow only a brief meeting , but [PER Moratinos  ] , effusive in his welcome , devoted 45 minutes to reviewing multilateral issues . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] , accompanied by his Deputy Director [PER Alberto Ucelay  ] , hosted [PER Welch  ] for a two-hour lunch meeting at the [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] , accompanied by two other members of President [PER Zapatero  ] 's policy planning team , met with [PER Welch  ] at the [ORG Moncloa Presidential Complex  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] was more in " receive mode " but asked many thoughtful questions about [LOC U.S.  ] policy developments , eager to take advantage of the discussion . 
[PER Welch  ] also conducted a well-attended press roundtable that resulted in several articles in the local press and coverage by the wire services. ------------- PEACE PROCESS ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Welch  ] shared information about next steps in the peace process and appealed for [MISC European  ] regional cooperation in support of Quartet principles to create , " a reality both sides can't back away from . 
" FM [PER Moratinos  ] agreed that the [MISC Arab  ] community had not fulfilled its potential to positively influence the situation and that it was important to avoid a vacuum while a new [LOC Israel  ] government was being formed . 
In response to A/S [PER Welch  ] 's point that [PER Abu Mazen  ] needed to , " play it smartly , " [PER Moratinos  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] wanted to engage with [MISC Arab  ] states to encourage them to explore new options ; reconciliation efforts by [LOC Egypt  ] could be constructive . 
[PER Welch  ] noted that it was becoming difficult to gauge the level of seriousness of the many proposals floating around and it was essential to maintain coordination through the Quartet Process to keep the focus on results . 
[PER Moratinos  ] offered to help with keeping the process on track and said , " after her next trip , tell Secretary Rice to call me so I can reinforce her points . 
" In response to [PER Sendagorta  ] 's question about the formation of a new [MISC Israeli  ] government and its impact on the process , [PER Welch  ] said that it was important to show progress in the new year , e.g. , slowdown in settlement construction , fewer roadblocks , improved security , and enhanced economic activity . 
He noted that is was important to query the new [MISC Israeli  ] government privately , without hard [LOC MADRID  ] 00001132 002.2 OF 005 stances that would force its hand . 
During the November Quartet meeting , the Parties should address the structure and goals of the full peace process , with a focus on expected results by the end of the year . 
There should be no public characterization of positions . 
[ORG Policy Planning  ] Director [PER Ortega  ] said that President [PER Zapatero  ] planned to travel to the [LOC Middle East  ] in the near future to push for solutions , although he could not offer details on a possible itinerary. --------- [LOC SYRIA  ] --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said , " we call it as we see it , despite [LOC France  ] thinking that we are too optimistic . 
" When [PER Welch  ] commented that we agreed with the results-based approach contained in the [ORG EU  ] letter to [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said , " I have taken risks reaching out to the [MISC Syrians  ] , but I know the personalities and the issues . 
" He continued , " [LOC Syria  ] wants to be part of the [LOC West  ] , rather than aligning with [LOC Iran  ] they want to be welcomed in [LOC Paris  ] , and moreover , we need them to conclude any comprehensive peace plan . 
" " [PER Walid  ] ( al-Muallem ) wants to normalize with the [LOC U.S.  ] , " [PER Moratinos  ] emphasized . 
The other factor [PER Moratinos  ] noted was that drawing [LOC Syria  ] closer to the [LOC West  ] would serve to marginalize [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to exert influence . 
A/S [PER Welch  ] remarked on the [MISC Moratinos/EU  ] letter on [LOC Lebanon  ] that was sent to [LOC Syria  ] , spelling out benchmarks for improved behavior . 
He emphasized that if [LOC Syria  ] seeks further engagement with the international community , it must take specific , demonstrable actions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Sendagorta  ] claimed that [PER Moratinos  ] , engagement with [LOC Syria  ] paying off ; others in the [ORG EU  ] have come around to [LOC Spain  ] 's position . 
[PER Welch  ] amplified his point , saying that while the [LOC U.S.  ] agrees with an approach based on quantifiable results , a fuller assessment of [MISC Syrian  ] actions is needed , particularly with regard to [LOC Lebanon  ] and foreign fighter flows . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] thought that [LOC Syria  ] would be more careful in the future , given the dramatic , positive evolution of situation in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He agreed foreign fighters can do the [MISC Syrians  ] lots of harm . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] added that [LOC Spain  ] worried for safety of its [ORG UNIFIL  ] troops . 
In response to [PER Welch  ] 's query whether [LOC Spain  ] talked to [MISC Syrians  ] regarding border camps , [PER Sendagorta  ] said " not recently , " but that in July 2008 [LOC Spain  ] had secured a commitment from [MISC Syrian  ] President al-Asad . 
[PER Welch  ] said that [LOC Syria  ] needed to hear more on this issue from the international community . 
Overall , [PER Sendagorta  ] summarized , [LOC Spain  ] thinks [LOC Syria  ] will move in constructive ways in the next few months , in contrast to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Welch  ] reiterated to all [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors that a vigilant [ORG UNIFIL  ] was essential to prevent [ORG Hizballah  ] from reasserting itself and that [LOC Syria  ] shouldn't be allowed to dabble to gain concessions without implementing real reform. ------- [LOC IRAN  ] ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In response to [PER Sendagorta  ] 's question , [PER Welch  ] said there was no decision on opening an [ORG US Interests Section  ] in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG An Interests Section  ] idea , especially if it was empowered to issue visas , could be useful , but it must also serve a broader purpose . 
[PER Welch  ] appealed for more effective political approach/policy on [LOC Iran  ] ; the [ORG EU  ] must be tougher on [LOC Iran  ] if our approach of calibrated response was to work . 
[PER Welch  ] reviewed [LOC Iran  ] 's counterproductive efforts in [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] with all his interlocutors . 
He asked the [MISC Spanish  ] to consider if there are any creative options to add to a coordinated set of incentives and disincentives for the [MISC Iranian  ] regime . 
He also called for more coordinated financial actions , and ensuring that [LOC Iran  ] would not benefit from any new international financial instruments , e.g. , excluding [LOC Iran  ] from bank deposit protections. ------- [LOC IRAQ  ] ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Sendagorta  ] said GOS officials , most likely Deputy Secretary-equivalent [PER Angel Lossada  ] , would visit soon and [PER Welch  ] welcomed efforts to help integrate [LOC Iraq  ] into the international community , adding that a [PER Moratinos  ] visit would be helpful . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] said [LOC Spain  ] was ready to start a new chapter in [LOC Iraq  ] , focusing on commercial activity and [LOC CT  ] cooperation , issues that they had discussed with [LOC Iraq  ] 's ambassador to [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER Ortega  ] also said that while it was difficult for the [ORG PSOE  ] administration , [LOC Spain  ] would engage [LOC MADRID  ] 00001132 003.2 OF 005 with [LOC Iraq  ] , in a non-military way , if it could protect its personnel and address security concerns . 
[LOC Spain  ] wants to do its part to stabilize [LOC Iraq  ] within the current political context . 
[PER Welch  ] briefed on the pending [LOC Iraq  ] [ORG SOFA  ] , which needs to be concluded before year 's end , and explained that [MISC Russian  ] FM Lavrov 's public remarks that [LOC Russia  ] might consider renewal of [ORG UN Iraq  ] mandate were unhelpful because they served to reduce pressure on [MISC Iraqi  ] leaders to deal with [ORG SOFA  ] issue . 
The [ORG UN  ] mandate was not ideal since it limited [MISC Iraqi  ] sovereignty and had negative financial implications . 
He explained that the [ORG US SOFA  ] was very forward leaning , aimed at giving [LOC Iraq  ] jurisdiction and room to maneuver . 
[PER Welch  ] also noted that political involvement by [LOC Spain  ] had its own merit and might help protect against [MISC Iranian  ] intrusions in [MISC Iraqi  ] domestic politics . 
[PER Alberto Ucelay  ] asked to be kept informed of the date of the upcoming [ORG Iraq Neighbors Conference  ] , as it might be the logical point to arrange a [PER Lossada  ] visit to [LOC Baghdad.  ] ------------------------ [LOC MAGREB  ] & [LOC WESTERN SAHARA  ] ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) With regard to the [LOC Magreb  ] , [PER Welch  ] described the recent [LOC Libya  ] settlement that would take the [MISC US-Libya  ] bilateral relationship to a new level , in addition to increasingly strong cooperation with [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] . 
Recognizing [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts , he said that given worrisome trends toward violent extremism in the [LOC Magreb  ] , it was ever more important to encourage broader political reconciliation and foster significant improvements in intra-Magreb cooperation . 
[PER Welch  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] recapped counter-terrorism and stabilization efforts in the [LOC Magreb  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] believed former Ambassador [ORG Ross  ] could be an effective [ORG UNSYG Special  ] Representative on [LOC Western Sahara  ] and that , " we are telling the [MISC Moroccans  ] to give him support . 
" He acknowledged [MISC Moroccan  ] unhappiness with the dismissal of [PER Van Walsum  ] and said that [ORG Ross  ] would need to facilitate communications and build trust among all parties to the negotiations . 
[PER Moratinos  ] suggested a coordination meeting including [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] on the margins of the [ORG NATO  ] ministerial . 
[PER Welch  ] replied that Secretary [PER Rice  ] had attempted a similar meeting during her trip to the region but the [MISC Moroccans  ] and [MISC Algerians  ] did not respond positively ; timing would be a factor for another attempt during the [ORG NATO  ] Ministerial. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Welch  ] and [PER Sendagorta  ] reviewed [MISC Moratinos'  ] idea of arranging meetings of for Secretary [PER Rice  ] and her [MISC French  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] counterparts with [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] to breath life into [LOC Western Sahara  ] issue . 
[PER Welch  ] encouraged the [MISC Spanish  ] to develop the initiative for further consideration . 
[PER Ortega  ] related [LOC Spain  ] 's view that the [LOC Manhasset  ] process itself was critically important , apart from whether or not there were any near-term chances of achieving an accord . 
While [LOC Spain  ] would officially support a referendum , a referendum would only be useful it validated a solution rather than calling for end results . 
[PER Ortega  ] suggested that the [MISC Algerians  ] could be moved forward in their thinking by engaging them indirectly through the Union for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] mechanism . 
In addition , he agreed with [PER Welch  ] that the [LOC Western Sahara  ] dispute would not be solved while the border was closed . 
If [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria  ] could integrate their tourism sectors and enhance economic ties , it would build a foundation of trust that would facilitate other discussions . 
However , [PER Ortega  ] admitted that the [ORG Barcelona Process  ] had never been able to impact the intra-Magreb or Morocco-Algeria dynamics. ------------- [LOC MAURITANIA  ] ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) According to [PER Sendagorta  ] , [LOC Spain  ] views [LOC Mauritania  ] as part of the [LOC Magreb  ] , in contrast to the [LOC US  ] and [LOC France  ] who manage the relationship within an [MISC African  ] context . 
Asking [PER Welch  ] to convey [MISC Spanish  ] views that [LOC Mauritania  ] was a fragile country and therefore , a target for al-Qaeda , [PER Sendagorta  ] argued that since its military gave the country form , we must work with the military to accomplish our goals . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's priorities were counter-terrorism , immigration , and to a lesser extent , fishing rights , and [PER Sendagorta  ] urged a quick solution that would prevent a political vacuum or armed conflict . 
He opined that it would be ideal if the military stepped back and allowed a " [MISC Turkish  ] model " to emerge . 
[LOC Spain  ] doesn't want a failed state a few miles from its territory in the [MISC Canary Islands.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In response to [PER Welch  ] 's points on the need to [LOC MADRID  ] 00001132 004.2 OF 005 reinforce the democratic process , [PER Sendagorta  ] clarified that [LOC Spain  ] was not weak on democracy , but wanted to find the right balance to bring long term solutions . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] claimed [LOC France  ] was coming around to [LOC Spain  ] 's views on this matter . 
Given ongoing consultations in [LOC Mauritania  ] regarding the presidential powers and the parliament 's role , [PER Sendagorta  ] believed an agreement was possible by year end . 
Also , [LOC Spain  ] thought there should be movement to liberate the ex-president without putting him back in power . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's Ambassador in [LOC Mauritania  ] reported the ex-president was well treated and the Parliament was still operational ; hence there was a measure of freedom of expression . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] said [LOC Spain  ] wants to engage with [ORG USG  ] officials , especially the AF bureau , on the issue of [LOC Mauritania  ] with [ORG USG  ] officials . 
[PER Welch  ] encouraged additional cooperation , since the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Spain  ] have different approaches , and reinforced that point with [PER Ortega  ] as well. ------------------------- MULTILATERAL COORDINATION ------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Sendagorta  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] was impressed with [ORG USG  ] administration 's management of many interconnecting foreign policy issues in the second [MISC Bush  ] term . 
[PER Welch  ] reiterated our desire for [MISC European  ] cooperation across the board . 
[PER Sendagorta  ] said the [ORG EU  ] working toward an integrated approach to foreign policy , despite many difficulties as decreasing sovereignty among [ORG EU  ] countries engendered competition among them , leading to uncoordinated foreign policy initiatives ( as [PER Welch  ] had noted during his presentation on the [ORG MEPP  ] ) . ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Sendagorta  ] 's insights on the competition among [ORG EU  ] countries to gain some sort of foreign policy prestige certainly applies to [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts to position itself as a key player in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] has already announced that it plans to initiate a major [LOC Middle East  ] initiative during its January-June 2010 [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
Apart from Foreign Minister [PER Moratino  ] 's long-term personal interest in the issues , [LOC Spain  ] also views itself as the most influential [MISC Mediterranean  ] country , serving as the primary link beween [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Europe  ] based on geography , population flows and history . 
With [LOC Spain  ] actively campaigning for support to have [ORG Barcelona  ] designated as the headquarters of the Union for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] , it is seeking broad support for its candidacy . 
[LOC Spain  ] emphasizes to [MISC Muslim  ] countries that , given the history of [LOC Andalusia  ] , it can serve as an important bridge culture and it has a unique understanding of [LOC Islam  ] that allows " strong fraternal ties . 
" For example , King [PER Juan Carlos  ] offered to host the [MISC Saudi-sponsored  ] 2008 World [MISC Muslim  ] League [ORG Inter-Faith Conference  ] . 
King [PER Juan Carlos  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] officials make regular swings through the [LOC Middle East  ] to promote commercial ties and investment opportunities . 
Moreover , [LOC Spain  ] " markets " itself to [LOC Gulf  ] countries and other states with funds to invest as the natural link to [LOC Latin America  ] , claiming that it has the special understanding and technical skills necessary to successfully expand commercial ties in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Apart from [LOC Spain  ] 's quest for foreign policy prestige and commercial opportunities , it also recognizes the potential challenges and opportunities of increasing [MISC Muslim  ] immigration to [LOC Spain  ] , from the [LOC Magreb  ] and other regions as well. ------------- [PER SENDAGORTA  ] BIO ------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 .
