Andrew Plowman  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: The  ] [MISC Bolivian  ] Government 's decree prohibiting [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Petrobras  ] from exporting refined petroleum products ( reftel ) has drawn an incrementally more robust official response from the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government than previous [MISC Bolivian  ] actions prejudicial to [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
[ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) [LOC Bolivia  ] desk officer [PER Lauro Beltrao  ] told [PER Emboff May  ] 9 that their press statement of the previous day , which notes the " negative effects that this and other unilateral actions might have on cooperation between the two countries " was meant to be a clear signal to [LOC Bolivia  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] expects fair treatment of [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
Meanwhile , [ORG Petrobras  ] has asked for a response by May 10 to its proposal for the sale of its two refineries to [MISC Bolivian  ] parastatal [ORG YPBF  ] stating that it would ask for international arbitration if the [MISC Bolivian  ] government fails to make a fair offer for the two refineries . 
While not tipping his hand as to what [ORG Petrobras  ] will do in the next few days , CEO [PER Gabrielli  ] made clear to the Ambassador May 8 ( septel ) that there would not be any further investment in [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] will be importing liquid natural gas beginning next year to reduce its dependence on [MISC Bolivian  ] gas . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's current dependence on [MISC Bolivian  ] gas constrains its near term response to [LOC La Paz  ] 's decree . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [MISC Bolivian  ] May 6 decree barring [ORG Petrobras  ] from exporting refined petroleum products directly from its two refineries in [LOC Bolivia  ] , and requiring their sale to a [ORG YPFB  ] monopoly trading operation , has effectively " expropriated " the refineries' cash flow and made their operation " unviable , " [PER Gabrielli  ] told the press May 7 . 
[PER Gabrielli  ] announced that [ORG Petrobras  ] was opting to sell the two refineries to [ORG YPFB  ] . 
It had put a proposal on the table to [ORG YPFB  ] , he said , and [ORG Petrobras  ] expected an answer by the morning of May 10 . 
If the [MISC Bolivian  ] government did not offer fair compensation for the refineries , [PER Gabrielli  ] said , [ORG Petrobras  ] would take all necessary legal steps at its disposal . 
[PER Gabrielli  ] did not specify what [ORG Petrobras  ] would consider a fair offer , although the press quoted unnamed [ORG Petrobras  ] sources stating the company is seeking USD 120 to USD 135 million. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Itamaraty  ] [LOC Bolivia  ] desk officer [PER Beltrao  ] confirmed to [PER Emboff  ] in a May 9 conversation the outline of [ORG Petrobras'  ] response so far , including the May 10 deadline for a response to [ORG Petrobras'  ] offer . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] , he noted , made this investment through a [MISC Dutch  ] subsidiary and therefore could use the option it has under the [MISC Bolivia-Netherlands  ] bilateral investment treaty to compel binding international arbitration . 
[PER Beltrao  ] stated that despite [ORG Petrobras'  ] May 10 deadline , [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Morales  ] has said the negotiations would take ten days at least. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Beltrao  ] denied press allegations that the [ORG GoB  ] already has begun to take retaliatory actions , stating the incidents cited as evidence of retaliation ( e.g. cancellation of a high-level meeting between [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Development Industry  ] and Trade and its [MISC Bolivian  ] counterpart ) were taken out of context . 
The [ORG GoB  ] also would continue its strategy of keeping negotiations , to the maximum extent possible , between [ORG Petrobras  ] and [ORG YPFB  ] , according to [PER Beltrao  ] . 
Nevertheless , he implied that the latest [MISC Bolivian  ] action had forced the [ORG GoB  ] to re-evaluate its approach , noting that the language of the [ORG GoB  ] 's press release was meant as a clear signal to [LOC Bolivia  ] that there are limits . 
The press release ( informal translation at paragraph 7 ) does note the " negative effects that this and other unilateral actions might have on cooperation between the two countries . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The subject of [LOC Bolivia  ] came up in the Ambassador 's May 7 meeting with [PER Gabrielli  ] ( septel ) . 
While [PER Gabrielli  ] did not telegraph [ORG Petrobras'  ] specific game plan for the next few days , he did make it clear that [ORG Petrobras  ] would not be investing further in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He also outlined [ORG Petrobras'  ] plans for reducing [LOC Brazil  ] 's dependence on [MISC Bolivian  ] gas by beginning to import liquefied natural gas , including from [LOC Nigeria  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] . 
According to [PER Gabrielli  ] , [ORG Petrobras  ] will bring two floating re-gasification plants to [LOC Brazil  ] in the next two years , the first arriving in May 2008 and the second in January 2009 . 
These would have a capacity to import and re-gasify 20 million cubic meters of natural gas a day . 
One would be placed in [LOC Rio  ] and the second in [LOC Recife.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Although  ] it took over a year since the May 1 , 2006 surprise nationalization decree for the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government to begin to show signs of a stiffer spine , the latest attack on [ORG Petrobras  ] appears finally to have elicited a firmer response . 
In dealing with [LOC Bolivia  ] , however , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] remains constrained by a multitude of other considerations , including the repercussions for its near-term gas supplies and for the thousands of [MISC Brazilian  ] farmers and settlers in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
There remains little desire here for confrontation with [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
End Comment. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Text of [MISC Brazilian  ] press release: Note number 211 , May 7 , 2007 . 
Decision of [LOC Bolivia  ] Regarding the Monopoly over Export of [ORG Petroleum and Gasoline The Government of Brazil  ] expresses its disappointment with the [ORG Supreme Decree  ] 29122 , which gives [ORG YPFB  ] a monopoly over the export of crude petroleum and white gasoline [ distillates ] , which has a direct effect over the economic viability of the [PER Gualberto Villaroel  ] and [PER Guillermo Elder Bell  ] refineries , both properties of [ORG Petrobras  ] . 
The measure harms , and might make unviable , the negotiation process for normalization of the situation of the two refineries within the legal and institutional framework created by the [ORG Supreme Decree  ] 28701 , a process in which [ORG Petrobras  ] was engaging in good faith . 
Independently of whatever legal actions [ORG Petrobras  ] may take in defense of its legitimate interests , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government cannot fail to note the negative effects that this or any other unilateral action might have on cooperation between the two countries .
