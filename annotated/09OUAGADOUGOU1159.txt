SUMMARY: The 9th meeting of the [ORG International Contact Group  ] on [LOC Guinea  ] ( [MISC ICG-G  ] ) held December 13 in [LOC Ouagadougou  ] was marked by a unified international community and capable leadership from the [ORG Economic Community of West African States  ] ( [ORG ECOWAS  ] ) , the [ORG African Union  ] ( [ORG AU  ] ) , and the [ORG UN  ] Representative for [LOC West Africa  ] . 
In the face of an intransigent [ORG CNDD  ] delegation ( that was taken over by pro-Dadis hardliners at the last minute ) , the [MISC ICG-G  ] issued a strong statement calling for continued sanctions against the [ORG National Committee for Democracy and Development  ] ( [ORG CNDD  ] ) , an international observer presence during the transition , and the [ORG CNDD  ] 's agreement not to participate in elections . 
While a compromise position between the [ORG CNDD  ] and the [ORG Forces Vives  ] did not appear any closer , the international consensus in clearly against the return of [PER Dadis  ] and in favor of international involvement in the transition period . 
The declaration pushed mediator [PER Compaore  ] towards a tougher line than he has been willing to pursue up to now .

( U ) The 9th Meeting of the [MISC ICG-G  ] took place on December 13th in [LOC Ouagadougou  ] , [LOC Burkina Faso  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was represented by DAS [PER William Fitzgerald  ] and accompanied by the Charge d'Affaires . 
The meeting was chaired by co-presidents the President of the [ORG ECOWAS Commission  ] , [PER Mohamed Ibn Chambas  ] , and the [ORG AU Special  ] Envoy [PER Ibrahima Fall  ] . 
The leadership dais was also shared by the [MISC Nigerian  ] Junior Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs Bagudu Hirse  ] and [ORG UN  ] SRSG for [LOC West Africa  ] Said [MISC Djinnit  ] . 
Delegations included representatives of [LOC Burkina Faso  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Liberia  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , the [LOC UK  ] , the [ORG European Union Presidency  ] and [ORG European Commission  ] , the [ORG International Labor Organization  ] , the [LOC Francophonie  ] , the [ORG Organization of the Islamic Conference  ] , and the [ORG World Bank  ] . 
Many groups were represented by their representatives in [LOC Conakry.  ] ------------------------------- [MISC French  ] and [ORG U.S. Share Positions  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A pre-meeting breakfast with the [MISC French  ] delegation demonstrated the closeness of the [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] positions regarding the current situation . 
The [MISC French  ] were represented at the ICG by [PER Francois Goldblatt  ] , Ambassador to [LOC Burkina Faso  ] , [PER Jean Grabling  ] , Ambassador to [LOC Guinea  ] , [PER Stephane Gompertz  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Director for [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Indian Ocean  ] , and [PER Charlotte Montel  ] , [ORG Africa Advisor  ] at [ORG MFA  ] , who saw President [PER Compaore  ] 's mediation efforts as weak , and hoped that the events of December 3 would cause [PER Compaore  ] to push the parties toward a solution that would bring a quick election and minimize the role of the [ORG CNDD  ] in the country 's future . 
The [MISC French  ] share the assessment that [LOC Morocco  ] should keep [PER Dadis  ] in country , that any deal with [PER Dadis  ] is impossible , and that [PER Konate  ] is the better if not sole option for the transition. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] shared the assessment that President [PER Compaore  ] can and should play a more productive role as mediator , and that recent events may lead [PER Compaore  ] to believe that it is in his own political and , perhaps , economic interest to create a solution that does not include [PER Dadis  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] claimed not to have any further information on the location of [LOC Dadis'  ] would-be assassin [ORG Toumba  ] . 
The delegation also believed that a clear and firm message delivered to [PER Compaore  ] would be more likely to produce results . 
The [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] shared some concern that [PER ECOWAS' Chambas  ] has not been a forceful spokesperson for the [MISC ICG-G  ] in past meetings and agreed to urge stronger [MISC African  ] voices ( notably [MISC Djinnit  ] ) to speak up ( [MISC Comment: As  ] the meeting progressed this concern was alleviated as all four [MISC African  ] voices were strong starting with [PER Chambas  ] who visibly upset the [ORG CNDD  ] by publicly calling for an [ORG ECOWAS  ] observation and security mission . 
End Comment ) . -------------------------------------------- Co-Chairs stake out a tough opening position -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the group 's first meeting since the violence of September 28 and the attempted assassination of [PER Moussa Dadis Camara  ] , co-presidents [PER Chambas  ] and Fall laid out a tough opening position . 
While condemning the events of December 3 in [LOC Conakry  ] and " any attempt to destabilize the fragile situation that currently reigns , " they cited the " urgency and opportunity of the moment . 
" They described the situation in [LOC Guinea  ] as having all necessary ingredients to become " explosive , " and suggested the need for an international force to protect civilians and provide humanitarian assistance in [LOC Guinea  ] , a suggestion which visibly rankled the [ORG CNDD  ] . 
The chairs also stated bluntly that impunity for repeated human rights violation in [LOC Guinea  ] OUAGADOUGO 00001159 002.2 OF 003 would not remain unpunished. -------------------------------------- [ORG Forces Vives  ] see [LOC Guinea  ] as " [PER Stateless  ] " -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The [ORG Forces Vives  ] were first to discuss their position with the [MISC ICG-G  ] and to take questions . 
The [ORG Forces Vives  ] condemned the prevailing situation in the country , which they categorized as a complete lack of both liberty and personal security . 
They claimed to be heartened by steps taken by [PER Sekouba Konate  ] as the new interim leadership of the [ORG CNDD  ] over the last several days , and believed [PER Sekouba  ] was someone that they could work with . 
They were surprised and disappointed to see the [ORG CNDD  ] delegation was composed of hard liners tied to [PER Dadis  ] and not by the more moderate figures who had been expected ( indeed , the [ORG CNDD  ] delegation was headed by [ORG Col. Moussa Keita  ] -- one of the most virulent and explosive of [LOC Dadis'  ] cadre ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG Forces Vives  ] condemned the attack on President [PER Dadis  ] , but when asked directly by the [MISC French  ] , they stated their belief that there would be greater opportunity for progress if he were to remain in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
They claimed that while they had compassion for the wounded , they had far greater compassion for the [MISC Guinean  ] people . 
The [ORG Forces Vives  ] very clearly declared their support for an international presence ( a " third force " ) in [LOC Guinea  ] that would help to ensure the peace throughout a transition period , and maintained their insistence that the [ORG CNDD  ] ( described as " those who had murdered and raped " ) not participate in any future elections . 
The [ORG Forces Vives  ] expressed their appreciation for the mediation efforts of President [PER Compaore  ] and the ongoing work of the [ORG ICG  ] , but asked that the group make a strong condemnation of the prevailing situation rather than pointing timidly at the problem. ----------------------------------------- [ORG CNDD  ] takes an early break and a hard line ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Perturbed by the opening statements of the [ORG ICG Presidency  ] and reportedly miffed that the [ORG ICG  ] met with the [ORG Forces Vive  ] before them , the [ORG CNDD  ] departed the conference center as soon as the opening session concluded . 
The [ORG ICG  ] then waited for hours for the [ORG CNDD  ] " rewrite " their response before returning to the negotiations , and were met with a deeply entrenched position . 
A sneering and bellicose Col [PER Moussa Keita  ] stated plainly that the presence of any international force , whatever its makeup , on [MISC Guinean  ] soil would be considered an attack on [LOC Guinea  ] 's sovereignty and a declaration of war . 
[PER Keita  ] claimed that the [ORG CNDD  ] was itself capable of managing a peaceful , transparent transition to democracy while protecting the [MISC Guinean  ] public . 
Their only goal , he claimed , was to construct a base for economic growth , peace , and free elections. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CNDD  ] delegation explained that the December 3 attack on [PER Dadis  ] had made the context of negotiations more difficult and had rendered the [ORG ICG  ] 's goal of election in the first half of 2010 unfeasible . 
They confirmed that they were willing to work through the [ORG ICG  ] to find a solution to the crisis , but insisted that any effort to restrict any group from participation in any eventual elections remained completely unacceptable , and would be detrimental to the ideal of a fully-inclusive [MISC Guinean  ] democracy . 
With the speaking role shifting between delegation members , the group decried sanctions on [LOC Guinea  ] as both in violation of international law and counterproductive in encouraging peace and stability . 
The group strongly reiterated their complete confidence in President [PER Compaore  ] in his role as mediator. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [PER Chambas  ] told the [ORG CNDD  ] representation to understand the new democratic mood in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Chambas  ] said that military rule in the region had led to too many catastrophes , and that militaries must stay out of politics . 
He stated that no one can be happy with the current situation of democracy and governance in [LOC Guinea  ] , and that despite [ORG CNDD  ] 's claim that it would be a " referee " in the new [LOC Guinea  ] , it has failed to ensure the safety of the population and its ability to restore democracy is questionable . 
[PER Chambas  ] stated that the " stories " coming out of the country relating to human rights abuses made an international force necessary . 
It was , continued [PER Chambas  ] , in no way an invasion , simply an offer of assistance to the people of [LOC Guinea.  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ An Awkward Intervention [MISC African  ] Mediators to [MISC Step Up  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) he Representative of the [MISC Libyn  ] controlled Community of [LOC Sahel-Saharan States  ] ( [MISC EN-SAD  ] ) intervened to take issue with what he peceived to be the imposition of unacceptabl restrictions on the sovereign state of [LOC Guinea  ] by the [ORG ICG  ] . 
After a long tirade - OUAGADOUGO 00001159 003.3 OF 003 questioning the [ORG ICG  ] 's existence , claiming that the [ORG CNDD  ] saved [ORG Guinee  ] after [PER Conteh  ] , tossing accusations of inappropriate interference in [LOC Guinea  ] 's affairs at the co-presidents , the representative of [LOC Nigeria  ] , and the non-African states participating in the [ORG ICG  ] - the representatives of the [ORG CNDD  ] delivered a hearty round of applause while other members of the [ORG ICG  ] seemed surprised at the outburst. --------------------- Group maintains unity --------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Throughout the negotiations , the international community was by and large on the same footing . 
The absence of [PER Dadis  ] was viewed as an opportunity by the vast majority of the membership of the [ORG ICG  ] . 
There was very little divergence between the positions of the international organization , the [MISC African  ] states , the [MISC Europeans  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] The gaps were especially minimal between the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC France  ] , and the [LOC UK  ] . 
Because of this unity , the [ORG ICG  ] was able to offer a strong statement -- one that most consciously saw as a call for [MISC Burkinabe  ] President [PER Compaore  ] to take a more dynamic and aggressive stance than has been seen to date . 
Most of the negotiation over the text was over semantics , not substance . 
The text includes a renewed call for elections as soon as possible in 2010 , the [ORG CNDD  ] agreement not to participate in those elections , and international presence in [LOC Guinea  ] to ensure the peace. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Comment: The meeting allowed the international community to take stock of the situation following the December 3 attempt on [LOC Dadis'  ] life . 
The ability of the [PER Dadis  ] hard liners to seize control of the [ORG CNDD  ] delegation worked against them -- only convincing the [MISC African  ] leadership through their belligerent manner that there can be no solution involving [PER Dadis  ] . 
The situation demonstrated a remarkable degree of international solidarity -- unfortunately coupled by a general disappointment with President [PER Compaore  ] 's mediation that is seen both as timid and too prone to meet [ORG CNDD  ] demands. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) This cable has been cleared by [PER DAS Fitzgerald.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 .
