( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Bolivian  ] prosecutor investigating a 2009 alleged domestic terrorism plot claims that the perpetrators' leader , [PER Eduardo Rozsa  ] , had been in regular contact with a former [ORG CIA  ] employee and kept him informed of the group 's activities in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
The prosecutor 's assertion is the first specific GOB allegation of [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in the [PER Rozsa  ] affair , in which the [MISC Bolivian  ] government maintains it thwarted an attempt to set up a separatist military force , as well as a conspiracy to assassinate [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Evo Morales  ] . 
Although the prosecutor stopped short of accusing the [ORG CIA  ] of backing [PER Rozsa  ] 's mercenary group , we can expect that GOB officials will make that claim , regardless of the evidence . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Marcelo Soza  ] , the prosecutor in charge of investigating the April 2009 [PER Rozsa  ] case , announced February 5 that a review of [PER Rozsa  ] 's computer hard drive had uncovered evidence of email communication between [PER Rozsa  ] and an alleged ex-CIA employee ( a [LOC U.S.  ] citizen named [PER Belovays  ] ) . 
According to [PER Soza  ] , [PER Belovays  ] had been active in the [LOC Balkans  ] wars , where he supposedly met [PER Rozsa  ] and became his mentor . 
An internet search on [PER Belovays  ] suggested that he has since died , [PER Soza  ] reported ( [PER Rozsa  ] and two others were killed in a police raid ; another two suspects are in custody ) . 
[PER Soza  ] claimed that [PER Rozsa  ] 's computer files show that [PER Rozsa  ] was in constant contact with [PER Belovays  ] -- who , [PER Soza  ] said , is assumed to have been in [LOC Bolivia  ] at some point -- and kept him informed of his group 's activities and plans. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Soza  ] did not provide any details of the alleged exchanges between [PER Rozsa  ] and [PER Belovays  ] , nor characterized [PER Belovays  ] 's role beyond asserting that the alleged former agent had been aware of [PER Rozsa  ] 's conspiracy . 
The [MISC Bolivian  ] press has so far reported the story straight , sticking strictly to [PER Soza  ] 's account but featuring headlines such as , " [PER Soza  ] Says [ORG CIA  ] Knew [PER Rozsa  ] 's Plans " and " [PER Rozsa  ] Informed [ORG CIA  ] Agent of Work . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Soza  ] 's initial claims may be limited in scope , but we expect that [MISC Bolivian  ] government officials will not feel themselves similarly bound by actual evidence . 
For nearly a year , the GOB has maintained that [PER Rozsa  ] and his group represented a grave threat and that they were backed by enemies of President [PER Morales  ] ( including prominent opposition and [PER Santa Cruz  ] civic leaders , who are increasingly the target of [PER Soza  ] 's investigation ) . 
The [MISC Bolivian  ] government is almost certain to seize upon this opportunity to link the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" empire " to the alleged conspiracy and substantiate [PER Morales  ] 's wildest claims about [MISC American  ] skullduggery .
