( [ORG S  ] ) The Executive Session continued discussion from the September 30 [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) meeting in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Both sides presented their primary points of contact for the four newly proposed working groups focusing on previous agreements , mitigation measures for the [MISC F-15  ] sale to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , technical mitigation issues , and intelligence/policy . 
Agreement was reached to begin working on the details of each working group 's meeting schedule and timeline. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] continued to express concern over the [MISC F-15  ] sale to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] participants noted that the [ORG USG  ] is unable to provide more detailed information about the sale until [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] officially sends a Letter of Request ( LOR ) . 
The [ORG GOI  ] expressed additional concerns about stationing these new aircraft at [LOC Tabuk  ] airfield in the northwest corner of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] -- close to the [MISC Israeli  ] border . 
[LOC U.S.  ] participants stated the [ORG USG  ] understanding that this should not be an issue , as the [MISC Saudis  ] are considering stationing new Typhoon aircraft at [LOC Tabuk  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] also raised [ORG AMRAAM  ] sales to [LOC Jordan  ] ; [LOC U.S.  ] participants explained that the new C-7 [ORG AMRAAM  ] is an export version with capabilities similar to the [MISC C-5  ] version -- and therefore provides little to no increase in capabilities . 
[LOC Iran  ] , [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Both sides expressed concern over the recent revelation regarding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear facility at [LOC Qom  ] , and agreed that increased pressure should be applied directly and internationally against [LOC Iran  ] in order to better determine [LOC Tehran  ] 's motives and next steps . 
Both sides agreed that the facility at [LOC Qom  ] should be inspected immediately . 
One member of the [MISC Israeli  ] delegation expressed the opinion that some consideration be given to " shutting [LOC Qom  ] operations down completely " to prevent further progress on obtaining a nuclear weapon . 
That said , the [ORG GOI  ] argued that the international community not become bogged down on the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) and [LOC Qom  ] , thereby diverting focus from [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002500 002 OF 002 the bigger issue of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Several questions were raised about [LOC China  ] 's position on [LOC Iran  ] 's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon . 
Both sides agreed that continued engagement with [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] is needed -- as well as building a consensus in [LOC Europe  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] speculated , and the [ORG GOI  ] concurred , that [LOC China  ] will follow [LOC Moscow  ] 's lead . 
[ORG USG  ] participants argued that [LOC China  ] would seek to avoid an international confrontation over [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] described 2010 as a critical year -- if the [MISC Iranians  ] continue to protect and harden their nuclear sites , it will be more difficult to target and damage them . 
Both sides then discussed the upcoming delivery of [MISC GBU-28  ] bunker busting bombs to [LOC Israel  ] , noting that the transfer should be handled quietly to avoid any allegations that the [ORG USG  ] is helping [LOC Israel  ] prepare for a strike against [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] made the case for " crippling sanctions " ; cooperation between the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] will be necessary in order for these sanctions to be effective . 
[LOC U.S.  ] participants stressed the [ORG USG  ] position that any discussions with [LOC Iran  ] on this subject be finite ; the [ORG USG  ] will continue to monitor whether negotiations are making progress . 
The [ORG GOI  ] stated that it is not convinced the [MISC Iranians  ] will negotiate in good faith unless there are visible and clear threats . 
[LOC U.S.  ] delegation members described eight lanes of sanctions , and outlined a plan to " pivot to apply appropriate pressure " on those points and tracks that have the most impact . 
[LOC U.S.  ] participants concurred that 2010 is a critical year -- but the continued application of pressure is vital. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Regarding [LOC Russia  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] was not confident that [LOC Moscow  ] will be helpful in any [MISC Iranian  ] sanctions effort -- [ORG GOI  ] participants opined that [LOC Russia  ] is considered a " mystery " with respect to their views on [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] raised the [MISC Russian  ] S-300 sale to [LOC Iran  ] , noting that the transfer is still pending . 
[ORG GOI  ] participants argued that [LOC Moscow  ] seeks a return to superpower status , but there are contradictory trends regarding [LOC Russia  ] 's internal condition . 
Dual Citizenship Issues ----------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] raised the issue of dual citizenship within the context of access to sensitive technology . 
[LOC U.S.  ] participants acknowledged [MISC Israeli  ] concerns , noting that the issue is being worked at the highest levels of the [ORG USG  ] to reach consensus on how to proceed . 
The [ORG GOI  ] recommended obtaining a waiver similar to the relationship from which [LOC Canada  ] or [LOC Australia  ] benefit . 
[LOC Turkey  ] ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] raised the current direction the Government of [LOC Turkey  ] has taken toward [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] -- and away from [LOC Israel  ] . 
[MISC Israeli  ] participants argued that [LOC Turkey  ] has been supportive of [ORG Hamas  ] in [LOC Gaza  ] while pursuing a more " [MISC Islamic  ] " direction with the goal of becoming a regional superpower . 
The [ORG GOI  ] argued that the [MISC Turkish  ] military is losing its ability to influence government decisions and strategic direction . 
After this past year , [ORG GOI  ] participants said they have a " bad feeling " about [LOC Turkey  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] noted that the [ORG Israel Air Force  ] ( [ORG IAF  ] ) Commander in the past wanted to speak to the [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG Air Force  ] Commander , but his [MISC Turkish  ] counterpart declined. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] has cleared on this cable .
