( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Gender  ] equality and women 's issues are top priorities in [LOC Iceland  ] and the country has achieved strong results in these spheres .

( [ORG U  ] ) The Global [MISC Gender Gap Index  ] measures how well countries divide their resources and opportunities between women and men , looking at economic participation and opportunity , educational attainment , political empowerment as well as health and survival .

The country also ranked first in political empowerment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The financial and economic crisis that shocked [LOC Iceland  ] in October 2008 led to the downfall of the government and the elevation of veteran politician [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] to the post of prime minister in early 2009 , becoming the first [MISC Icelandic  ] woman to hold that position . 
Women make up 43 percent of the seats in parliament following the most recent parliamentary election held in April 2009 . 
Half of the twelve government ministers are women . 
The Speaker of Parliament and the Chief Justice of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] are also both women. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The combination of powerful female role models and progressive government policies , like three to six months of paid maternity leave , are working to close the gender gap even further . 
One example of a best practice utilized by the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government includes a government-funded center for promoting gender equality located in the town of [LOC Akureyri  ] . 
The center provides counseling and education on gender equality to national and municipal authorities , institutions , companies , individuals , and [ORG NGOs  ] . 
Another example of an [MISC Icelandic  ] success story is an international conference hosted by the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and the University of [LOC Iceland  ] in June 2009 on Women , Peace and Security .

( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] passed the Act on [ORG Equal Status  ] and [ORG Equal Rights of Women and Men  ] in 1976 . 
This legislation decreed that all individuals shall have equal opportunities to benefit from their own enterprise and to develop their skills irrespective of gender . 
Subsequent legislation has included a provision to ensure that there are equal numbers of women and men on public committees , councils and boards . 
[LOC Iceland  ] supports gender equality through central , regional , and national bureaus that oversee the implementation of these laws. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Icelandic  ] government is also actively working to combat trafficking in persons and gender based violence . 
Parliament approved an action plan against trafficking in persons in March <a id='par2009' href='#par2009'>¶</a>2009 . 
In December , the parliament passed an amendment to the General [PER Penal Code  ] with respect to trafficking in persons which clears the road for ratification of the [ORG Palermo Protocol  ] to the [ORG United Nations Convention  ] against [ORG Transnational Organized Crime  ] and the [ORG Council of Europe Convention  ] on Action against Trafficking in [MISC Human Beings  ] . 
In October 2009 the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Justice and Human Rights  ] sponsored a well-attended symposium on human trafficking . 
An action plan against gender-based violence was adopted in 2007 and it is currently being implemented. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Post  ] has engaged with and assisted the [MISC Icelandic  ] Government in its battle against trafficking in persons . 
Notably , [ORG Post  ] sponsored one individual 's travel to the [LOC United States  ] for a two-week IVLP program entitled " Combating Trafficking in Persons . 
" It is [ORG Post  ] 's intention to send another individual on a similar program this summer . 
In addition [ORG Post  ] has worked to increase the lines of communication between [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Reykjavik  ] on the TIP topic . 
There is , for example , a [ORG Digital Video Conference  ] scheduled for January 14 that will allow officials from the [MISC Icelandic  ] government to discuss the matter with their colleagues in [ORG State Department  ] 's [ORG G/TIP  ] office .
