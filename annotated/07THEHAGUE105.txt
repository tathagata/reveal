( C ) Summary: [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] leadership is searching for " " creative ways " " to preserve some 2007 defense investment projects , including unmanned aerial vehicle ( [ORG UAV  ] ) and [MISC CH-47 Chinook  ] helicopter acquisition , and participation in [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG C-17 Strategic Airlift Initiative  ] . 
While [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) participation looks solid , the number of acquired [ORG JSF  ] aircraft will likely be decreased , and acquisition of [MISC Tactical Tomahawk  ] ( [ORG TACTOM  ] ) missiles is all but dead for political reasons . 
[ORG MOD  ] leadership expected no cuts -- or increases -- to future defense budgets as a result of the new government currently in formation . 
[ORG MOD  ] Director for General Policy Affairs [PER Lo Casteleijn  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] CHOD Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] discussed these issues with the Ambassador on January <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
Defense Minister [PER Kamp  ] and [ORG MOD  ] State Secretary van der [ORG Knaap  ] will discuss defense budget options further on January <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
End Summary . 
Hard Decisions ; Looking for Creative Solutions --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Casteleijn  ] acknowledged that the [ORG GONL  ] will need to make some hard decisions on defense investments for 2007 due to over-spending on 2006 defense projects and political sensitivities associated with the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) joining the new government . 
He said [PER Kamp  ] and van der [ORG Knaap  ] were looking for " " creative solutions " " to save or postpone some 2007 investments . 
Embassy contacts report that due to a family crisis and illness , [PER Kamp  ] and van der [ORG Knaap  ] delayed reviewing options until January 24. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) One such project included [MISC Dutch  ] interest in the [MISC U.S. Predator  ] B unmanned aerial vehicle ( [ORG UAV  ] ) program , which [PER Casteleijn  ] argued was vital -- postponing or canceling [ORG UAV  ] acquisition would be a step backward . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] also mentioned the [ORG NATO  ] [ORG C-17 Strategic Airlift Initiative  ] as another targeted project to try and save , but added that much depended on who will be the new defense minister , and whether he/she would prioritize the project after cost increases associated with the initiative . 
[ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Casteleijn  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] will likely purchase two early [ORG JSF  ] aircraft in order to participate in the test and evaluation program . 
He expected the new government to honor all previous [ORG JSF  ] commitments , including participation in the production , sustainment and follow-on phase . 
However , [PER Casteleijn  ] suggested the new government will most likely decrease the number of total planes purchased . 
For planning purposes , the current government has stated plans to purchase 85 [ORG JSF  ] aircraft . 
[ORG TACTOM  ] is Dead -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) For political reasons , [PER Casteleijn  ] said the most likely 2007 defense investment casualty will be the [MISC Tactical Tomahawk  ] ( [ORG TACTOM  ] ) missile acquisition . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] explained that current Defense Minister [PER Kamp  ] fervently supports [ORG TACTOM  ] as a method of maximizing the capabilities of the smaller [MISC Dutch  ] navy , but suggested [PER Kamp  ] is largely isolated on the acquisition . 
[ORG PvdA  ] views [ORG TACTOM  ] as an aggressive , unnecessary weapon with a " " [MISC U.S.-controlled  ] " " targeting system . 
Even PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's [ORG Christian Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) questions the need for [ORG TACTOM  ] , and [PER Kamp  ] 's impending departure from government will all but kill the acquisition. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] argued for prudence , and suggested quietly shelving [ORG TACTOM  ] instead off abandoning it in order to keep options open -- after all , the [MISC Dutch  ] are the third country in the world cleared to acquire [ORG TACTOM  ] . 
[PER Casteleijn  ] took the point , but said that decision will be left to the new defense minister . 
He suggested a new defense minister from [ORG PvdA  ] might want for political reasons to demonstrate independence from the [LOC United States  ] by publicly abandoning [ORG TACTOM  ] . 
[MISC Chinook Delay  ] ? --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] CHOD Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] acknowledged that the [ORG MOD  ] was looking at methods to preserve funding for the acquisition of six [MISC CH-47  ] Chinook helicopters with specialized [MISC Honeywell-configured  ] cockpits . 
[PER Berlijn  ] said [PER Chinooks  ] were vital for the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and the [ORG MOD  ] is working with Finance Minister [PER Zalm  ] on creative methods to preserve the program . 
[PER Berlijn  ] said [PER Zalm  ] understands the importance of the [PER Chinooks  ] , but may not have the political leeway to shift funds from property sales to preserve the acquisition . 
If not , the acquisition may be delayed by three years , [PER Berlijn  ] said . 
Static Defense Budget --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Casteleijn  ] argued the importance of maintaining current defense spending given [MISC Dutch  ] overseas military operations , and anticipated no future defense budget cuts -- or increases -- resulting from the new coalition currently being formed . 
He acknowledged that the " " graying of the population , " " coupled with antiquated education and social security systems could put tremendous pressure on the defense budget . 
However , he described [ORG PvdA  ] leadership as " " pragmatic , " " and said the defense minister , should he come from [ORG PvdA  ] , will understand the importance of preserving the defense budget . 
That said , he did acknowledge that " " efficiency " " cuts across the national budget could affect defense spending -- these " " corrections in course " " had been issued in the past , and reflected fiscal , apolitical decisions .
