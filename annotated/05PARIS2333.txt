[LOC PARIS  ] 280 Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION ALEX WOLFF , FOR REASONS 1.4 B/D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: U.S.-French cooperation on terrorism is mature and broad-based . 
For a number of reasons , including the memory of terrorist attacks in [LOC Paris  ] during the 1980s , the [MISC French  ] bring significant expertise , focus and determination to their C/T activities , and are valued partners for a wide range of [ORG USG  ] agencies . 
C/T cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] is largely insulated from the day-to-day political and diplomatic tussles that can make the [MISC French  ] often difficult allies . 
Notwithstanding this solid foundation , Post has outlined three areas where we believe our C/T objectives can be better served , and proposes suggestions to implement these objectives . 
End summary. --------------------------------- A MATURE , SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Embassy [LOC Paris  ] comprises one of the widest range of [ORG USG  ] agency representation anywhere in the world . 
Many of these agencies play a role in the remarkably broad [MISC U.S.-France  ] security and counter-terrorism relationship . 
In addition to State 's [LOC Consular  ] , [ORG Diplomatic Security , Economic , Political  ] , and [ORG Public Diplomacy  ] sections that each handle pieces of the terrorism portfolio , other non-State sections in [LOC Paris  ] that deal with the [MISC French  ] on terrorism issues include the [ORG DEA  ] , the [ORG Defense Attache  ] , a [LOC DOJ  ] liaison prosecutor , [ORG Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ] ( [ORG ICE  ] ) located in [LOC Paris  ] and in the port cities of [LOC Le Havre  ] and [LOC Marseilles  ] , [LOC Legatt/FBI  ] , [LOC NCIS  ] , [LOC OSI  ] , [LOC ROAL  ] , a [ORG Transportation Security Administration  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) representative , and the [ORG Secret Service  ] . 
A significant portion of the work of the Embassy 's EST office is now counterterrorism-related . 
Other non-traditional security-oriented offices also contribute to counterterrorism work . 
For example , the [ORG Foreign Agricultural Service Office  ] liaises with [MISC French  ] agriculture authorities on biosafety risks . 
In addition , [ORG USG  ] personnel are assigned to [ORG Interpol  ] headquarters in [LOC Lyon  ] , [LOC France  ] 's second largest city. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Two reasons for this breadth of [ORG USG  ] representation are 1 ) [LOC France  ] 's own outsized role internationally and within the [ORG EU  ] on counter-terrorism issues ; and 2 ) a long-term institutional desire by the [ORG GOF  ] to maintain close relations with [ORG USG  ] C/T professionals . 
In addition to this permanent [ORG USG  ] presence , delegations from the [LOC United States  ] often visit [LOC France  ] to discuss specialized aspects of C/T . 
Two noteworthy recent examples were a [MISC DOE/NRC/NSC/STATE  ] visit in January on the protection of nuclear facilities and radiological materials . 
The visit has led to the development of the a multi-year program to share best practices , swap observers at nuclear security exercises , and collaborate scientifically to improve passive security measures for nuclear facilities . 
Also , in December 2004 , then-Secretary of [ORG Health and Human Services  ] [PER Tommy Thompson  ] led an [MISC HHS/STATE  ] delegation to a [MISC G-8  ] meeting hosted in [LOC France  ] to engage at a deeper level on the threat of bioterrorism . 
The ongoing work of the [ORG Bioterrorism Experts Group  ] includes such items as best practices in protection of the food supply ; information sharing on zoonotic diseases ; licensing issues on medical countermeasures ; sharing of information regarding vaccine availability ; and the sharing of national response plans . 
[LOC France  ] hosted two bioterrorism conferences in April in Lyon: the first [ORG Interpol  ] conference devoted to this subject and a [MISC WHO-sponsored  ] meeting on Biosafety and Biorisks . 
[LOC France  ] participates actively in these fora and sends experts to [MISC U.S.-hosted  ] biosafety/biorisk seminars in the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Internationally , [LOC France  ] is a long-standing contributor of military troops and assistance in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and a [MISC French  ] admiral is regularly in the rotation to command [ORG Task Force  ] 150 , a multinational naval force that patrols the [LOC Red Sea  ] and the [ORG Persian Gulf  ] to interdict the movement of suspected terrorists from [LOC Afghanistan  ] to the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] . 
[MISC French  ] Special Forces also operate closely with coalition forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It is a key member of the [ORG UN  ] 's [ORG Counter-Terrorism Committee  ] and the [MISC G-8  ] 's [ORG Counter-Terrorism Action Group  ] , and it has supported ( and co-sponsored , where possible ) terrorist designations to the [ORG UN  ] 's 1267 sanctions committee . 
[LOC Bilaterally  ] , [LOC France  ] recently signed two updated agreements on extradition and counter-terrorism cooperation , and cooperates closely on [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) and airline security issues . 
Domestically , [LOC France  ] continues to hold in pretrial detention 6 of the 7 ex-GTMO [MISC French  ] citizen detainees ( the seventh was declared not an enemy combatant by the [ORG Department of Defense  ] ) . 
All six will be charged with " terrorist conspiracy , " which has a maximum sentence of ten years . 
Most recently , terrorism investigating judges and prosecutors successfully argued for the conviction of [PER Djamel Beghal  ] and five accomplices arrested in 2001 on suspicion of planning to bomb the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Beghal  ] and his five accomplices were convicted on March 15 and all received jail sentences . 
Other significant C/T operations include the dismantling of a local cell of " [MISC French  ] jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] , " a raid on and continuing investigation of the [MISC MEK  ] presence in [LOC France  ] , the dismantling of a [ORG GICM  ] cell , and the near-destruction of [ORG ETA  ] support cells in the south of [LOC France  ] . 
Additional examples are reviewed in ref B. ---------------- AREAS TO IMPROVE ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As noted in ref C , [LOC France  ] often appears to react differently to terrorism and radical [MISC Islam  ] depending on its distance from it . 
Within its borders , the [ORG GOF  ] reacts proactively , with speed and firmness . 
Elsewhere in the world , it is much more equivocal . 
Political and diplomatic considerations carry substantial weight , and sometimes trump security considerations . 
A good example of this is continued [MISC French  ] intransigence within the [ORG EU  ] on [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
It sees the [ORG EU  ] 's listing of [ORG Hezbollah  ] as a bad idea for [LOC Lebanon  ] 's political stability and therefore , it continues to hold a firm line against listing , despite a growing openness within internal security circles to acknowledge that [ORG Hezbollah  ] has committed terrorist acts and should be considered a terrorist organization . 
An approach that combines convincing the [ORG GOF  ] of a case 's merits and , where necessary , isolating [LOC France  ] diplomatically offers the best chance of success , although in this particular situation , it will prove difficult to overcome the firm conviction of President [PER Chirac  ] and others that designating [ORG Hezbollah  ] is a bad idea . 
Nevertheless , [LOC France  ] 's intelligence and security services must be persuaded by the existing evidence that [ORG Hezbollah  ] is a terrorist organization . 
Presenting the [ORG GOF  ] with evidence of [ORG Hezbollah  ] involvement in terrorism in the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] is particularly important , as the [ORG GOF  ] cannot overlook [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's efforts to destroy the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] peace process . 
Having the [MISC Palestinian  ] leadership weigh in with the [MISC French  ] at a high level would be important as well ; up to now , the [MISC French  ] have maintained that only the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] are pressing them on [ORG Hezbollah  ] , while the [MISC Palestinians  ] remain in the background on the issue . 
Second , [LOC France  ] must be isolated within the [ORG EU  ] Clearinghouse . 
A number of [ORG EU  ] countries hide behind [LOC France  ] 's strong opposition , but if they are peeled away , [LOC France  ] may be more amenable . 
In general , [LOC France  ] does not like to be seen publicly as blocking consensus , a fact that worked to our advantage in finally convincing the [ORG EU  ] to designate [ORG Hamas.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Embassy believes that a gap in [MISC French  ] C/T planning is its development of mass-casualty emergency response . 
The [ORG GOF  ] understands they have improvements to make and have begun to conduct exercises to build and test their emergency response capabilities . 
However , [LOC France  ] could benefit from observing the [ORG USG  ] crisis simulation exercises . 
Post would recommend , therefore , for the invitation ( where possible ) for a [ORG GOF  ] official to observe [ORG USG  ] exercises and simulations . 
One good recent example is the inclusion of two high-level [MISC French  ] officials as observers to the [ORG TOPOFF  ] 3 simulation in the [LOC U.S.  ] Expanding on this worthy initiative , [LOC Washington  ] might consider inviting [MISC French  ] officials as observers to other , similar simulations in the [LOC U.S.  ] and abroad , to include [ORG USG  ] training programs with other countries ( such as those referenced in [LOC Jakarta  ] 4212 ) . 
The [MISC French  ] can be prickly if given the impression that they need to be " trained " and in addition , giving them decision-making roles is often best avoided . 
One way to overcome these issues is to focus on " professional exchanges " and invite them to observe USG-organized emergency response simulations and allow them to translate best practices to the [MISC French  ] system . 
In addition , Post will work to procure invitations for the [ORG USG  ] to observe [MISC French-led  ] crisis simulations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As mentioned in para 1 , [MISC U.S.-French  ] C/T cooperation is largely removed from daily political and diplomatic pressures . 
One reason for this is that [ORG GOF  ] counter-terrorism is itself separated from the rest of the government . 
[LOC France  ] 's intelligence-related agencies and coordinating bodies - of which the [LOC DST  ] , the [ORG RG  ] , the [ORG DGSE  ] and the [ORG SGDN  ] are primary examples - all deal with terrorism ( although the [LOC DST  ] has a primary role domestically ) , but their investigations and cases are guarded carefully and rarely shared with the rest of the [ORG GOF  ] . 
Similarly , the renowned terrorism investigating judges - led by Judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] - operate in a different world than that of the rest of the judiciary . 
In short , the [ORG GOF  ] counter-terrorism community is highly professional , but insular and centralized in [LOC Paris  ] . 
Because of this , judiciary and police services not directly involved in counter-terrorism ( but who may play an indirect support role ) have a largely insufficient understanding of [ORG USG  ] counter-terrorism policy and the judicial/investigative procedures that frame this policy . 
To replace working-level and upper management , [LOC France  ] 's counter-terrorism community draws upon the available pool of judicial and security professionals , many of whom have little understanding of the [LOC U.S.  ] , its judicial/law enforcement system , and its law enforcement organizational structure and resource allocations . 
We need to reach these judicial and security professionals as they begin their careers , and not only when they enter the counter-terrorism community , sometimes with already-formed prejudices . 
To this end , Post proposes approaching the [ORG National Magistrate School  ] , other professional academies , and programs for already serving law enforcement officials with offers to deliver lectures on [LOC U.S.  ] approaches to terrorism and law enforcement . 
We would request assistance from [LOC Washington  ] in developing these proposals . 
Although in this case , results would probably not be immediate , in the long run , the [ORG USG  ] would have much to gain by exposing [MISC French  ] judicial and security professionals to the [LOC U.S.  ] counter-terrorism and law enforcement system at an early stage in their careers .
