Reason: 1.4 ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
With their usual light touch and unique sense of timing , the security services appear to be tightening the screws on what they see as [LOC Russia  ] 's internal and foreign enemies along three fronts . 
First was a confidential letter from the [ORG Federal Security Service  ] ( [ORG FSB  ] ) demanding that [ORG USAID  ] stop funding [ORG NGOs  ] in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
Second , the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] has brought pressure on the liberal Higher School of Economics to expel students who took part in anti-government demonstrations in December . 
Third , and most disturbing , we believe the [ORG FSB  ] is behind a personal smear attack [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the [ORG National Democratic Institute  ] 's [LOC Moscow  ] office ( [ORG NDI  ] ) that was emailed to [ORG NDI  ] and [ORG USAID  ] staff this week . 
The second provocation has become a public issue , with critical articles even in the popular tabloid , [ORG Moskovskiy Komsomolets  ] , on [ORG Ren TV  ] , and commentary on prominent blog sites . 
Taken together , we assess that hard-line silovik elements are testing the political waters at home and potentially making waves at a time of otherwise positive signals of interest in improving [MISC US-Russian  ] relations . 
End Summary . 
Warning to [ORG USAID  ] ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A January 17 letter from the [ORG FSB  ] , sent through liaison channels , explicitly warned against continued [ORG USAID  ] funding for [ORG NGOs  ] in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
Citing a November trip by a named [ORG USAID  ] officer , the [ORG FSB  ] alleged that [LOC US  ] funding to the region was " incompetent " and that [ORG USAID  ] was not in a position to guarantee that funds provided for humanitarian programs did not fall into the hands of illegal armed groups . 
Given the tensions in [LOC South Ossetia  ] , as well as the conflict in the [LOC Middle East  ] , the [ORG FSB  ] gave notice that " it is necessary to refrain from financing any [ORG NGO  ] in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] , regardless of [ORG USAID  ] 's goals . 
" The letter closed with an ominous admonition that unless [ORG USAID  ] stops its " incompetent actions , " the [ORG FSB  ] would implement strict preventative measures , including the denial of visas. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG FSB  ] letter attempted to justify its position by highlighting the complexity of nationalities and religions in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] , the prevalence of extremist movements , and the predominant role played by family loyalties as factors that made funding of [ORG NGOs  ] in the region dangerous . 
The [ORG FSB  ] made implicit threats that information about [LOC US  ] funding of illegal groups would likely be made public through the media , damaging [MISC US-Russian  ] counterterrorism efforts . 
Further , the letter noted that " incompetent actions " on the part of the " Embassy sections , like [ORG USAID  ] " could escalate tensions in regions beyond the borders of the [LOC North Caucasus  ] to the detriment of [LOC US  ] and [MISC Russian  ] interests . 
When the Ambassador protested this [ORG FSB  ] salvo , Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Ryabkov claimed  ] ( credibly ) that the security service complaints had not been coordinated with the [ORG MFA  ] . 
Warning to Students ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) In mid-January , the [LOC Moscow  ] branch of the [ORG MVD  ] issued a letter to the Higher School of Economics , raising the issue of four students ( possibly six ) who participated in December opposition marches with the veiled recommendation that they be expelled . 
According to press reports , the letter warned " implementation of un-sanctioned mass acts was one of the forms of extremist activity , carrying a high level of societal danger , and demands adequate reactive measures on the part of the law enforcement organs . 
" The [ORG MVD  ] called on the institute to look into the circumstance of the students' participation in the opposition protests and to consider the efficacy of continuing their education . 
Further , the letter sought comments from the heads of the [MISC Politics  ] and Economics departments about extremism , as well as personal statements from the four students . 
[ORG MVD  ] sources told the newspaper [ORG Moskovskiy Komsomolets  ] ( [ORG MK  ] ) that they were " legally required " to inform the place of employment or school of any citizens violating social stability. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The institute will hold a meeting on February 4 to consider its response , but public comments by the director and rector suggest that the school considers such political activity to be a " personal " decision , beyond the scope of institute censure . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] " no way " that the institute would adhere to the recommendations of the [ORG MVD  ] and underscored the unanimity of the faculty and student body on this issue . 
[ORG Nezavisimaya Gazeta  ] criticized the letter , seeing it as a demonstration of the government 's " panic " after the anti-tariff protests and highlighting the " [MISC Soviet  ] " aspect of going after politically " unreliable " students . 
Besides the usual lineup of opposition newspapers and websites , the [ORG MK  ] article ensures that a broader swath of society will learn about this incident -- already it has spawned a sharp reaction of support for the students and condemnation of the [ORG MVD  ] in [LOC Russia  ] 's blogosphere. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was sure that other institutes and universities had received similar letters , but had chosen not to make the silovik demands public or had quietly capitulated . 
Our consulate in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] noted last year 's closing of the [ORG European University  ] , ostensibly for " fire safety " issues , because of the [ORG Political Science  ] department had taken a grant to do research on electoral politics in [LOC Russia  ] . 
Getting Ugly and Personal with [ORG NDI  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On January 29 , [ORG USAID  ] FSNs received an email from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] with a photoshopped image of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reclining with an underage child . 
The picture was attached to a message , ostensibly from a [MISC Russian  ] citizen , which accused [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of raping her 9-year old daughter . 
This latest provocation falls on the heels of a scandal in [LOC Murmansk  ] alleging [ORG NDI  ] interference in local elections and harassment of [ORG NDI  ] staff [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The Ambassador met with representatives from [ORG NDI  ] on January 30 on harassment of the [ORG NGO  ] , reported septel . 
Panic or Provocation -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Emboldened by the economic crisis , the silovik forces have taken the initiative to stir the waters of [MISC Russian  ] politics , not only with those letters , but also with the proposed revision of the law on treason , on jury trials , and the heavy-handed response to the protests in [LOC Vladivostok  ] . 
Some of those initiatives have been blunted directly , such as [PER Medvedev  ] 's decision to revise the proposed law on treason , others by publicizing the issue ( the letter to the Higher School of Economics , for example , received coverage in the popular tabloid [ORG MK  ] and on [ORG Ren TV  ] ) -- suggesting an intensification of inter-elite conflict. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment . 
We cannot rule out that those provocations may in part be directed at complicating efforts to improve [MISC US-Russian  ] relations . 
At a time when both [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] have indicated the potential for starting with a clean slate in relations with the new [MISC Obama  ] administration , those within the security services who see value ( including to their budgets ) from continued tensions or whose world view is predicated on [MISC US-Russia  ] conflict are likely under pressure to play a spoiler role . 
Ambassador plans to raise all of those incidents forcefully in high-level meetings next week to send a message back flagging the risks inherent in allowing rogue elements to run amok in the relationship .
