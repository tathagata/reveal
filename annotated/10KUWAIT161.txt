STATE 15979 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
KUWAIT 137 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Counselor [PER Pete O'Donohue  ] for reasons 1.4 b and d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
PolCouns on February 23 raised ref a points regarding [ORG USG  ] policy on [LOC Iran  ] 's [LOC Tehran  ] research reactor with Counselor [PER Rashid Al-Hajiri  ] , [ORG MFA  ] 's desk officer for [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Al-Hajiri  ] offered no substantive response to our points , noting merely that the [ORG GOK  ] has been following the issue through its representative to the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
[PER Al-Hajiri  ] added that the [ORG GOK  ] shares [ORG USG  ] concerns about the lack of transparency in [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and regularly encourages [LOC Iran  ] to comply with international safeguards . 
At the same time , [PER Al-Hajiri  ] said , the [ORG GOK  ] hopes that the international community can persuade [LOC Iran  ] to come into compliance through peaceful dialogue rather than through expanded sanctions. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Comment: [PER Al-Hajiri  ] 's tepid response to our demarche reflects the overall [ORG GOK  ] approach to [LOC Iran  ] which , as noted Ref B , consists of quietly urging [LOC Tehran  ] to abide by [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards while maintaining a friendly relationship with its much larger and more powerful neighbor . 
Trapped in a difficult neighborhood , the [ORG GOK  ] will welcome any proposals that can move [LOC Iran  ] off its nuclear path -- including [ORG IAEA  ] proposals noted ref A to ensure that [LOC Iran  ] receives needed medical isotopes -- but will not expose itself to [MISC Iranian  ] ire by getting out front to push for these . 
Emblematic of [LOC Kuwait  ] 's position was the statement by Deputy PM and FM Shaykh Dr. [PER Mohammad Al Sabah  ] February 22 , who told the local press that " We wish our friends ( in [LOC Iran  ] ) can do their best to reassure the international community about the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program so that there will not be an excuse for imposing sanctions . 
There are wise people in [LOC Iran  ] , " he added , continuing to call on [LOC Iran  ] to abide by the requirments of international legitimacy and the [ORG IAEA  ] .
