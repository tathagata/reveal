( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
On December 13 , 2009 , [ORG Treasury Department Acting Assistant Secretary  ] of the [ORG Office of Intelligence and Analysis  ] [PER Howard Mendelsohn  ] , along with [ORG GRPO  ] officers and [ORG Treasury  ] analysts , met with senior [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Mabahith  ] officials to discuss suspected Taliban-related financial activity in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
Prior to this meeting , [ORG Treasury  ] and [ORG GRPO  ] officials shared with [ORG Mabahith  ] detailed information on the financing of the [ORG Taliban  ] and other terrorist and extremist groups based in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] pointed to the General Intelligence Presidency ( GIP ) , [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s overseas intelligence agency , as having the lead on [ORG Taliban  ] matters for the [MISC Saudi  ] [LOC Arabian Government  ] ( SAG ) . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] pledged to disrupt any Taliban-related financial activity in the [LOC Kingdom  ] , including fundraising carried out by [ORG Taliban  ] leaders participating in reconciliation efforts . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] asked [ORG GRPO  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] to provide additional detailed and actionable information to assist in its investigations. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During the course of the multi-hour intelligence exchange session , [ORG GRPO  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] analysts walked through the previously shared intelligence , which suggested that Taliban-related finance officials have visited [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in order to raise funds . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] pledged to follow up on the information provided , to work through intelligence channels to share information and results , and submit additional requests for information . 
END SUMMARY . 
( U ) [ORG Taliban/Haqqani Network  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mendelsohn  ] acknowledged the important steps the [MISC Saudi  ] government has taken to combat al-Qaida financing , and highlighted the importance the [ORG USG  ] places on combating [ORG Taliban  ] financing . 
He stated that the [ORG Taliban  ] receives significant money from narcotics trafficking and extortion , but noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] believes that the group also receives significant funds from the [LOC Gulf  ] , particularly from donors in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the [MISC UAE.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mabahith  ] agreed that the [ORG Taliban  ] is a serious threat and stated that [MISC Saudi  ] authorities can more easily target al-Qaida financing since the group’s members are frequently [MISC Saudi  ] nationals , often with [MISC Saudi  ] addresses and phone numbers . 
[ORG Taliban/Haqqani  ] network fundraisers , however , usually enter the [LOC Kingdom  ] from [LOC Afghanistan  ] or [LOC Pakistan  ] , and may use fabricated travel documents , according to [ORG Mabahith  ] . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] also acknowledged that the [LOC Hajj  ] represents an opportunity for terrorist fundraisers . 
The same officials further acknowledged the historical ties that existed between [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the [ORG Taliban  ] , suggesting that lingering sympathies may create a potential donor base in the [LOC Kingdom.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mendelsohn  ] stated that senior [ORG Taliban  ] officials travel to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to discuss reconciliation issues , but said they also conduct fundraising activities while in the [LOC Kingdom  ] . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] initially responded that [ORG Taliban  ] reconciliation issues were handled by the GIP and stated that the [ORG Mabahith  ] has very little insight or coordination with the GIP in this area . 
After further discussion , [PER Issa  ] said that even if [ORG Taliban  ] fundraisers travel to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] under the auspices of reconciliation , [ORG Mabahith  ] officials would arrest anyone who breaks [MISC Saudi  ] law while in the [LOC Kingdom.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Treasury  ] analysts provided information on [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] three senior [ORG Taliban  ] officials who have made multiple fundraising visits to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , according to [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence . 
( NOTE: Information available to the [ORG USG  ] and shared for this exchange included telephone numbers , e-mail addresses , and passport information for crosschecking against [MISC Saudi  ] customs databases . 
END NOTE . 
) [ORG Mabahith  ] was not familiar with the individuals and pledged to follow up on the identifying information provided by [ORG GRPO  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] . 
[ORG GRPO  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] analysts also shared names and phone numbers of multiple [ORG Taliban  ] and [ORG Haqqani  ] associates known either to reside in or travel to the [MISC Saudi  ] [LOC Arabia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Reviewing a list of several full or partial names of suspected [ORG Taliban  ] donors in the [LOC Kingdom  ] , [ORG Mabahith  ] recognized [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a prominent [MISC Saudi  ] who reportedly gave [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] $30,000 in September 2008 . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] had no information regarding XXXXXXXXXXXX’s financial contributions to the [ORG Taliban  ] , but speculated that the money could have come from a trust or a charity that was associated with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , rather than from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] himself . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] pledged to investigate [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and stated that it would not hesitate to “press him” regardless of his social status . 
[ORG Mendelsohn  ] emphasized the importance of taking actions to delegitimize [ORG Taliban  ] fundraising , just as the [MISC Saudi  ] government has worked hard to delegitimize al-Qaida and deter donors from giving money to the group. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mabahith  ] also detailed the SAG’s new fingerprinting system . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] suggested that the system will likely be more effective against [ORG Taliban  ] fundraisers , who travel through official points of entry , than it will be against al-Qaida-affiliated foreign fighters , who enter the country illegally . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] also stated that this system should reduce the effectiveness of forged travel documents used at official points of entry . 
They pointed out the country’s large borders , highlighting the continuing challenges they expect to encounter . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Jamaat  ] al-Dawa al-Quran wa al-Sunna <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mendelsohn  ] also raised [ORG USG  ] concerns about [MISC Pakistan-based  ] extremist group [ORG Jamaat  ] al-Dawa al-Quran wa al-Sunna ( [ORG JDQ  ] ) and its involvement in attacks against coalition forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG GRPO  ] and [ORG Treasury  ] passed names and other identifying information of suspected [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia-based [ORG JDQ  ] donors and affiliates . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] pledged to investigate the names and follow up through intelligence channels . 
( U ) [ORG Al-Haramain Foundation  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Mendelsohn  ] commended [ORG Mabahith  ] for its successful operations exposing and disrupting the terrorist support activities of the [MISC Saudi-based  ] [ORG NGO al-Haramain Foundation  ] ( [ORG AHF  ] ) , and pledged [ORG USG  ] support for their investigation . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] confirmed that more than 40 [MISC AHF-affiliated  ] individuals had been arrested as a result and that [ORG Mabahith  ] had a strong case against former [ORG AHF  ] Director [PER Aqil  ] al-Aqil . 
[ORG Mabahith  ] candidly noted that [MISC Saudi  ] authorities were embarrassed about the way they had handled [PER Aqil  ] al-Aqil , since they had previously arrested and released him based on an earlier lack of evidence .
