[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In advance of the [ORG November Force Generation Conference  ] , the [ORG Icelandic Defense Department  ] briefed resident [ORG NATO  ] ambassadors October 12 on [LOC Iceland  ] 's air policing wishlist: quarterly Allied deployments featuring planes on the ground at [LOC Keflavik  ] for up to three weeks at a time . 
As incentives , [LOC Iceland  ] would offer participants low-level flying opportunities and will cover major costs . 
[LOC Iceland  ] hopes for generous commitments covering 2008-2010 at the conference . 
While the proposal shows the [ORG GOI  ] has high ambitions for allied support , the very fact that the [ORG MFA  ] hosted a broad consultation on the topic represents a welcome change in thinking at the ministry . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG NC  ] ) [ORG MFA Defense Department  ] Director [PER Thorir Ibsen  ] -- who took over from his longtime predecessor Amb . 
[PER Jon Egill Egilsson  ] in early September -- invited resident [ORG NATO  ] ambassadors on October 12 to a presentation on [LOC Iceland  ] 's concept of air policing ( [ORG AP  ] ) operations . 
The presentation was based on the [ORG NATO Military Committee-  ] and [ORG North Atlantic Council-approved  ] paper on peacetime air defense for [LOC Iceland  ] , which passed silence in the NAC on July 26 . 
That agreement envisions quarterly interceptor deployments to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER Ibsen  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] intends to formally invite [ORG NATO  ] allies to provide [ORG AP  ] services at the [ORG Global Force Generation Conference  ] scheduled to commence on November <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
He also indicated that [LOC Iceland  ] will seek to secure commitments from participating countries for an initial deployment in March/April 2008 and subsequent deployments through 2010. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG NC  ] ) [PER Ibsen  ] stated that [LOC Iceland  ] would provide extensive ground support services including hangar and maintenance space , messing and berthing facilities , and expects the deployed aircraft to maintain a robust schedule of training and exercise play . 
He pointed out that [LOC Iceland  ] offers opportunities for low altitude flying overland year round except for [MISC May-September  ] . 
( Note: We do not yet know definitively if the Icelanders will provide fuel , as they did for the [ORG Northern Viking  ] exercise in 2007 . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG NC  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's ideal [ORG AP  ] scenario: --participating [ORG NATO  ] countries commit to participating in a three year rotational schedule ( 2008-2010 ) ; --aircraft deployed on a quarterly basis , with the first quarterly deployment during the March / April 2008 timeframe ; --deployments in country for up to three weeks ; --a force composition of at least 4 fighters . 
In give-and-take with the ambassadors , [PER Ibsen  ] displayed a healthy pragmatism about these goals . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is aware that [ORG NATO  ] allies' budgets and training schedules are probably already fixed for FY 2008 and in some instances FY 2009 . 
He stressed that [LOC Iceland  ] is willing to accept variations such as deployments shorter than three weeks or less than every quarter ; more than one country at a time providing aircraft during the same deployment ; and other possibilities . 
He admitted that it will be difficult to fill all four quarters in the first year but intends to use a high return on investment ( i.e. , lots of training opportunities and firm support from host nation ) as a selling point. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the connection between quarterly deployments and annual military exercises , [PER Ibsen  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] hoped for an annual [ORG Northern Viking  ] defense exercise in addition to the four annual [ORG AP  ] deployments . 
However , while this would be the ideal scenario for [LOC Iceland  ] , the [ORG GOI  ] would accept what [ORG NATO  ] allies were willing to offer . 
Pressed on specific commitments , [PER Ibsen  ] noted that [LOC Turkey  ] has ruled out participation entirely , while the [MISC Danes  ] and [MISC Norwegians  ] have expressed mild interest . 
The [ORG GOI  ] intends to approach the [MISC German  ] government in bilateral discussions later this month. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG GOI  ] 's wishlist is ambitious , but two positive changes in its thinking are apparent . 
First , the [ORG MFA  ] acknowledged that it is asking for considerable contributions from allies whose available assets and manpower are already under pressure . 
[PER Ibsen  ] was careful to note that variations would be acceptable and that [LOC Iceland  ] would work to ease the burden on contributing Allies . 
Second , the fact that the [ORG MFA  ] hosted a consultative meeting with all [ORG NATO  ] embassies in advance of making any formal proposal represents a sea change in the [ORG GOI  ] 's approach to these issues . 
Previous [ORG GOI  ] initiatives at [ORG NATO  ] uniformly came as a surprise to Allied ambassadors here ; this new approach recognizes the need for better spadework in [LOC Reykjavik  ] and in capitals . 
Both changes in tone and approach are welcome . 
Coming in addition to the [ORG GOI  ] 's announcement of [LOC Iceland  ] 's first-ever defense budget earlier this month , these indicate a new maturity in [MISC Icelandic  ] thinking about its responsibilities for defense and its place in the Alliance .
