[PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] 's four-day visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , the first trip to [LOC Latin America  ] of his papacy , was received with popular enthusiasm and saturation media coverage . 
In his several sermons and other public utterances , the [PER Pope  ] called on the faithful to adhere to Church rules on personal morality and to push back against the materialistic and secular values promoted by the mass media . 
In his meeting with President [PER Lula  ] , the [PER Pope  ] spoke of his hopes to reach agreement on a concordat that would afford the Church a special status in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Perhaps inevitably , his visit intensified the public debate surrounding proposals to legalize abortion in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Pope Benedict  ] also generated some controversy when , in his address inaugurating the [ORG Fifth General Conference of Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean  ] ( [ORG CELAM  ] ) , he asserted that the spreading of the gospel during colonization did not represent " alienation of pre-Columbian cultures nor the imposition of a foreign culture . 
" Though [MISC Brazilians  ] gave the [PER Pope  ] a hearty welcome and especially appreciated the canonization of a revered 18th century friar , it is unclear to what extent and for how long his message will resonate here . 
End Summary. ------------------------------- THE ABORTION DEBATE INTENSIFIES ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
A crowd estimated at about 15,000 gathered late on the afternoon of May 9 in downtown [LOC Sao Paulo  ] in front of the monastery where the [PER Pope  ] was to be lodged . 
Upon arrival , [PER Pope Benedict  ] appeared on the balcony to deliver brief remarks and a blessing . 
By then , he had already sparked controversy with comments he made in an interview with traveling press on the plane . 
Asked about the legalization of abortion in [LOC Mexico  ] , the [PER Pope  ] indicated that when some [MISC Mexican  ] bishops claimed that deputies who voted in favor of legalization had excommunicated themselves from the Church , this was " not something arbitrary " they were asserting , but rather a provision of canon law. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
In the days leading up to the visit , the abortion issue was the subject of some intemperate exchanges between government and [MISC Brazilian  ] church officials . 
Health Minister [PER Jose Temporao  ] , accused some sectors of the Church of making " aggressive statements " that were " far from [PER Jesus  ] 's teachings . 
" Special Secretary for Women 's Policy [PER Nilcea Freire  ] opined that the Church and fundamentalist religious groups should not act as " censors " of public debate . 
Dom [PER Geraldo Majella  ] , Archbishop of [LOC Salvador  ] and outgoing president of the [ORG National Conference of Bishops  ] ( [ORG CNBB  ] ) , accused the government of promoting promiscuity via its sex education program and by calling for a public debate on legalizing abortion . 
President [PER Lula  ] split the difference by stressing on the one hand that abortion is first and foremost a public health question ( though he as a [MISC Catholic  ] personally opposes it ) while noting at the same time that the Church is free to make its own decisions and take its own positions . 
He subsequently indicated that it was up to [ORG Congress  ] to decide whether to convoke a plebiscite on the question of legalizing first-trimester abortions , but that his administration would not sponsor such a proposal , as Minister [PER Temporao  ] had proposed . 
The GoB makes condoms available at no cost as part of its programs combating [MISC AIDS  ] and sexually transmitted diseases . 
Abortion is illegal in [LOC Brazil  ] , except in cases of rape or when the life of the mother is endangered by the pregnancy , but an estimated one million clandestine abortions are performed every year , and some experts believe the figure is much higher. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
In the same interview , the [PER Pope  ] also reiterated his low opinion of liberation theology , asserting that " it is now clear that those easy millenarianisms , which promise revolutions and also sudden conditions for a just life , were mistaken . 
Today everyone knows that . 
" At the same time , he acknowledged that the Church has been losing members in [LOC Latin America  ] and credited the " sects " ( the growing evangelical and Pentecostal denominations ) with giving the faithful something they were not getting from the Church , which he said needs to be more dynamic and missionary in its approach . 
According to a recent [LOC Datafolha  ] poll , [MISC Catholics  ] now make up about 64 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's population , down from 75 percent in 1994 , the first year the poll was conducted . 
Of those , about one third attend [MISC Mass  ] every Sunday . 
Pentecostals now comprise 17 percent of all [MISC Brazilians  ] , and other evangelical groups 5 percent. ---------------------- CHURCH-STATE RELATIONS ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
On May 10 , the [PER Pope  ] met with President [PER Lula  ] and with [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] . 
Per ref A , the signing of a concordat between [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC Vatican  ] was originally contemplated as a deliverable for this visit , but it soon became apparent that there wasn't enough time to conclude the negotiations . 
Instead , [PER Lula  ] and the [PER Pope  ] expressed the hope of signing it before the end of [PER Benedict  ] 's papacy , or of [PER Lula  ] 's presidency ( i.e. , the end of 2010 ) . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is reportedly concerned that certain aspects of the text proposed by the [LOC Vatican  ] could violate the principle of separation of church and state and might also , by granting the Church a privileged status , discriminate against other faiths . 
After the meeting , GoB officials quoted [PER Lula  ] as having told the [PER Pope  ] that , " Our task is to preserve and consolidate the lay state and have religion deal with spirituality and social problems . 
" One point of divergence appears to be a [LOC Vatican  ] proposal to make religious education obligatory in public schools . 
Though the draft agreement reportedly does not mention abortion , many commentators expressed concern that a concordat would increase the Church 's influence and thereby strengthen its hand in opposing legalization. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
The [PER Pope  ] also had a brief ecumenical encounter with a group of religious leaders . 
Participants included the President of the [ORG World Council of Churches  ] , leaders of traditional Protestant ( [MISC Anglican  ] , [MISC Lutheran  ] , [ORG Presbyterian  ] ) and Orthodox ( [MISC Greek  ] , [MISC Syrian  ] ) denominations , as well as Rabbi [PER Henry Sobel  ] of the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] [MISC Jewish  ] Congregation and Sheikh [PER Armando Hussein Saleh  ] , representing [MISC Muslims  ] . 
Some participants expressed disappointment afterwards that there was not sufficient time for any meaningful or substantive dialogue ; the [PER Pope  ] greeted each of the religious leaders and delivered brief remarks on the importance of religions working together in the cause of [PER God  ] . 
In addition , some observers pointed out that by reaching out to leaders of traditional religions , the [PER Pope  ] was essentially ignoring other important religious communities , especially the vibrant , growing evangelical and Pentecostal movements as well as [MISC Afro-Brazilian  ] syncretic religions . 
Others commented that neither Rabbi [PER Sobel  ] nor Sheikh [PER Saleh  ] can be considered truly representative of the [MISC Jewish  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] communities. ------------- FAMILY VALUES ------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
Later the same day , the [PER Pope  ] preached to a crowd of approximately 40,000 young people from all over [LOC Latin America  ] assembled in the city 's main soccer stadium , with some 15,000 more watching on big screens outside , a smaller audience than expected by organizers . 
His address was devoted almost entirely to questions of personal morality . 
Warning that they could become prey to the " assaults of materialism and laicism , " the [PER Pope  ] called upon [MISC Latin American  ] youth to venerate the family , respect the sanctity of marriage , and practice fidelity and chastity . 
He also took the opportunity to deplore the environmental devastation of the [LOC Amazon  ] region and the " threats to the dignity of its people . 
" The plight of the [LOC Amazon  ] is the focus of the [ORG CNBB  ] 's 2007 Fraternity Campaign. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
The high point of the [PER Pope  ] 's visit came on May 11 , when he said [MISC Mass  ] for some 800,000 faithful - again , fewer than the million that organizers had projected , due perhaps in part to the fact that the [MISC Mass  ] was broadcast live on television - at an [ORG Air Force  ] base in the northern part of the city . 
He used the occasion to canonize [PER Antonio Galvao  ] , an enormously popular 18th century friar who is the first [MISC Brazilian-born  ] person to become a saint . 
His unusual albeit not unprecedented decision to celebrate the canonization in the new saint 's home country instead of in [LOC Rome  ] was portrayed by the [LOC Vatican  ] as the [PER Pope  ] 's special gift to [LOC Brazil  ] , making is possible for [PER Frei Galvao  ] 's devotees ( and the beneficiaries of one of his certified miracles ) to be present . 
In his sermon , the [PER Pope  ] reiterated and expanded on some of the themes from his encounter with youth , calling on the faithful to emulate [PER Frei Galvao  ] and live " clean lives with clear souls and simple intelligence , " and to " say no to those media of social communication that make a mockery of the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
In a meeting with [MISC Brazilian  ] bishops in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Cathedral , the [PER Pope  ] expressed concern for those among the faithful who , due to the fragility of their faith , are most vulnerable to " the aggressive proselytism of sects " and are " incapable of resisting the onslaught of agnosticism , relativism , and laicism . 
" Noting that these are hard times for the Church , he lamented that " crimes against life are being justified in the name of individual freedom ; attempts are made against human dignity ; the wound of divorce and free unions is festering . 
" He also reiterated the importance of priestly celibacy and stressed the need for a good spiritual life to avoid " the risk of deviations in the area of sexuality . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
The [PER Pope  ] traveled from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] to the national shrine of [LOC Nossa  ] [LOC Senhora Aparecida  ] in the interior of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state . 
On May 12 , he visited the Estate of [LOC Hope  ] in nearby [LOC Guaratingueta  ] ( [PER Frei Galvao  ] 's hometown ) , a rehabilitation center for the chemically dependent operated by the Church . 
Here he listened as some of the center 's 400 recovering addicts told their life 's story . 
He attributed the phenomenon of drug abuse to " a consumer society turned away from [PER God  ] " and warned that " [PER God  ] will demand satisfaction " from drug traffickers. ------------------------- ADDRESS TO THE CONFERENCE ------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
On his last day in [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Pope Benedict  ] said [MISC Mass  ] at the [LOC Shrine  ] of [LOC Aparecida  ] and formally opened the [ORG Fifth General Conference of Bishops of Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] ( [ORG CELAM  ] ) . 
In his inaugural remarks , the [PER Pope  ] called upon the bishops to help the people " suppress the grave social inequalities and enormous differences in access to goods " that inhibit their ability to enjoy a full life " in the most human conditions , free from the threat of hunger and all forms of violence . 
" He praised ecclesial church communities throughout the region for stimulating lay participation in educational and assistance programs , but also expressed concern about " a certain weakening of [MISC Christian  ] life in the whole of society...due to secularism , hedonism , indifference , and the proselytism of numerous sects , animist religions , and new pseudo-religious expressions . 
" The Church , [PER Benedict  ] said , is " the advocate for justice and for the poor , precisely by not identifying itself with politicians or with party interests , " but rather by maintaining its independence and " teaching great standards and irreducible truths . 
" He criticized both capitalism and [MISC Marxism  ] for their failure to appreciate the need for individual morality . 
He highlighted the tragic legacy of [MISC Marxist  ] governments and decried conditions in the western world , " where the distance between rich and poor grows constantly and a disturbing degradation of human dignity is produced with drugs , alcohol , and other subtle mirages of happiness . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
It was in this address that the [PER Pope  ] , in assessing the significance of Christianity 's historical pre-eminence in [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] , made a comment that he was later obliged to clarify . 
For the peoples of the region , he said , acceptance of the faith meant " getting to know and accept Christ , the unknown [PER God  ] that their forebears , without knowing it , were searching for in their rich religious traditions...In fact , the announcement of [PER Jesus  ] and his [ORG Gospel  ] at no time involved an alienation of pre- [MISC Columbian  ] cultures , nor was it an imposition of a foreign culture . 
Authentic cultures are not closed around themselves nor petrified in a determined moment of history , but rather are open and even seek out encounters with other cultures , hoping to find universality in the encounter.. . 
" Indigenous leaders , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government agency for the indigenous , and [ORG NGOs  ] immediately took issue with this formulation , arguing that for many indigenous peoples , [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Portuguese  ] colonization and the Church 's participation in it did in fact involve forced conversion and other serious violations of human rights . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] opined that the [PER Pope  ] should ask [LOC Latin America  ] 's indigenous for forgiveness for the " genocide . 
" Ten days later in [LOC Rome  ] , while recalling his visit to [LOC Brazil  ] , the [PER Pope  ] tried to mend fences by acknowledging that " The memory of a glorious past cannot ignore the shadows that accompanied the evangelization of the [MISC Latin American  ] continent . 
" ------------------ ONE BISHOP'S VIEWS ------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
In the opinion of Auxiliary Bishop [PER Pedro Luiz Stringhini  ] , who heads the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Archdiocese 's pastoral programs , the [PER Pope  ] , in stressing family and moral issues as opposed to social questions , was merely recognizing and adapting to generational change . 
[PER Young  ] people , Bishop [PER Pedro  ] said , are for the most part not as interested in social action as his own generation was . 
And while taking care of the poor , infirm , elderly , and marginalized populations had always been an important part of the [ORG Church  ] 's mission , pre-dating [PER Marx  ] by many centuries , the liberation theologians were wrong to frame the social debate in the language of [MISC Marxist  ] dialectic . 
Furthermore , while preaching social revolution was at least understandable when [LOC Brazil  ] and much of [LOC Latin America  ] were living under military dictatorship , it was less defensible now. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
Liberation theology made an enormous contribution to [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Stringhini  ] acknowledged , by stimulating the formation of the ecclesial base communities that played a major role in opposing the dictatorship and continue to work to ameliorate the plight of the poor , but in the process the [ORG Church  ] made the costly error of giving short shrift to the spiritual side of its mission . 
Referring to the [ORG Church  ] 's " preferential option for the poor , " [PER Stringhini  ] remarked ruefully that " we opted for the poor , and the poor opted for the evangelical churches . 
" The faithful , he said , expected the [PER Pope  ] and other [MISC Catholic  ] leaders to act as moral policemen , and would have been disappointed if he hadn't reiterated [ORG Church  ] teaching on . 
[PER Stringhini  ] also noted that unlike the 1968 [ORG CELAM  ] meeting in [LOC Medellin  ] , this year 's [ORG CELAM  ] would generate continuity in the [ORG Church  ] 's profile in the region and not bring about fundamental change. -------------------- A SCHOLAR'S ANALYSIS -------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
According to [PER Fernando Altemeyer  ] , Professor of Theology at the [ORG Catholic University  ] ( [ORG PUC  ] ) of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [PER Pope Benedict  ] won over a great many [MISC Brazilians  ] just by showing up . 
Many among the faithful , [PER Altemeyer  ] said , experienced some trepidation about his visit and his entire papacy , remembering him as the [MISC German  ] " [MISC Panzer Cardinal  ] " who had disciplined a number of [MISC Brazilian  ] and other priests and theologians for straying from orthodoxy , in most cases because they were promoting or defending liberation theology . 
Though he was certainly no [PER John Paul II  ] , [PER Benedict  ] demonstrated that he was a genuine human being who appreciated [MISC Brazilians  ] and [MISC Latin Americans  ] . 
He appeared to speak [MISC Portuguese  ] quite well ( though [PER Altemeyer  ] noted that for the most part he was actually just reading speeches and sermons ) , and when he had trouble communicating , he simply slipped into [MISC Spanish  ] or [MISC Italian  ] , and it worked . 
His message was also generally well received , in part because it was what his audience expected him to say . 
Many of the young who went to see him were quite conservative - tickets to the stadium event went to youths hand-picked by [ORG Church  ] leaders - and appreciated his emphasis on family values. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
That is not to say , [PER Altemeyer  ] noted , that young people practice the sexual morality the [PER Pope  ] preached . 
Indeed , surveys show that on questions of sexuality and family planning , a sort of mutual " don't ask , don't tell " understanding operates in much of [ORG Latin America: Parishioners  ] for the most part don't ask their priests for guidance on such questions , and don't tell them if they are cohabiting or using contraceptives ; priests generally don't ask parishioners about the intimate aspects of their lives and don't tell them they have to abide by rigid rules. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
The reason the issue of a possible concordat sparked concern among [MISC Brazilians  ] , [PER Altemeyer  ] said , is that many of the republican leaders who overthrew Emperor [PER Pedro II  ] were freemasons who immediately severed all connection between [ORG Church  ] and state . 
This turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to the [MISC Catholic  ] [ORG Church  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] , he noted , because the [ORG Church  ] was forced to learn how to fend for itself and at the same time was freed from state control . 
The strict separation has become part of the national psyche . 
Marriage can be either civil or religious or both , and divorce has been legal for thirty years . 
While religion should be taught in public schools as part of [LOC Brazil  ] 's history and culture , [PER Altemeyer  ] argued , even most [MISC Catholics  ] do not want to see [MISC Catholic  ] teaching as part of the public education curriculum . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] has different kinds of concordats with different countries , [PER Altemeyer  ] said , and it is difficult to know just what the [LOC Vatican  ] has in mind for [LOC Brazil  ] because the draft document is not publicly available . 
This inevitably gives rise to speculation , some of it irresponsible. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
The most important thing to understand about [PER Pope Benedict  ] 's approach , [PER Altemeyer  ] said , is that he gives priority to quality over quantity . 
His episcopal motto is " Collaborator with the Truth , " and he sees himself and the [ORG Church  ] as possessing the single truth , from which he will not permit deviation . 
If this means there will be fewer [MISC Catholics  ] , so be it , so long as the ones who remain in the [ORG Church  ] fully accept that truth and follow the [ORG Church  ] 's teachings and commit themselves to serving [PER God  ] . 
The [PER Pope  ] doesn't have any problem with [MISC Catholics  ] being a minority in many places . 
In his view , the best way to win lapsed [MISC Catholics  ] back and to gain new converts is for the [ORG Church  ] to return to its core values . 
The real problem , in [PER Altemeyer  ] 's view , is that [LOC Brazil  ] 's 18,000 priests - one for every 10,000 [MISC Brazilians  ] - are increasingly overstretched and unable to meet the often competing demands of their routine parish functions , social and pastoral work in favelas , hospitals , and prisons , and missionary work to win new souls . 
The decline in the number of priests is endemic in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] . 
One solution , he said , would be to permit volunteer married men to perform certain priestly and missionary functions , but [PER Altemeyer  ] does not expect the [ORG Church  ] to adopt such a solution for perhaps another hundred years , and it , and he opined that it will probably take even longer for the [ORG Church  ] to accept ordination of women. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
Though the crowds who attended the [PER Pope  ] 's public events were smaller than organizers had hoped for , they were nonetheless impressive , and those who were there were generally enthusiastic . 
There was a " feel good " quality to the entire visit . 
Much of the criticism that did take place was predictable . 
For example , [PER Leonardo Boff  ] , an early liberation theologian who eventually left the priesthood after several times being disciplined by Cardinal [PER Ratzinger  ] 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the [ORG Faith  ] , wrote that the [PER Pope  ] continues to insist on doing battle with modernity , " seeing in it the arrogance of man seeking to emancipate himself through his own strength , " without seeking [PER God  ] 's help...More than anything he sees in it secularism , materialism , and relativism . 
" Other [MISC Brazilians  ] appeared not to enjoy being told how to live their lives . 
However , many commentators were even-handed , giving the [PER Pope  ] credit for his straight talk and stressing that people were absolutely free to heed him or not , according their own judgment and the dictates of their conscience . 
And there is no doubt that a great many [MISC Catholics  ] were deeply moved by his presence and his words , and by the fact that of all the places he might have visited , he chose [LOC Brazil  ] .
