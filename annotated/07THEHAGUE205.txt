Summary: ( C ) [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) Defense Spokesman [PER Frans Timmermans  ] offered his party 's views on the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter and Afghanistan  ] within the context of on-going government coalition formation talks . 
He said that the [ORG Labor Party  ] will practically concede defeat in its opposition to [ORG JSF  ] , relying on an upcoming third-party independent review of the [ORG JSF  ] business case as an opportunity to " " save face . 
" " On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he said failure is " " not an option , " " and indicated his party 's leadership will support additional budget supplementals aimed at bolstering the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , even if his party opposes increased defense spending . 
[PER Timmermans  ] discussed these issues with Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] on February 1 . 
End summary . 
JSF: Past the [ORG Point of No Return  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] said the [ORG Labor Party  ] will " " more or less " " swallow the [ORG GONL  ] 's plans to purchase the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) . 
[PER Timmermans  ] , who opposed investing in [LOC JSF  ] while State Secretary for Defense during the [ORG Wim Kok Cabinet  ] of the early SIPDIS nineties , admitted that he still regrets the [MISC Dutch  ] decision to participate in [ORG JSF  ] . 
He said , however , that his position on [ORG JSF  ] is more nuanced than some give him credit for , and had been highjacked by others within his party who were unable to articulate a more measured position . 
For example , he acknowledged that [ORG JSF  ] was the best option , and even said for the first time that he " " could not imagine " " the [MISC Dutch  ] buying any other plane. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Timmerman  ] 's criticism of the program hinges on participation in the investment phases -- in order to justify participation , the [MISC Dutch  ] will be compelled to buy a number of planes that exceeds their requirements while limiting leverage to pursue other options , should alternatives become available -- " " that is just not smart , " " [PER Timmermans  ] said . 
That said , [ORG PvdA  ] will push for an independent , third-party review of the [ORG JSF  ] business case to be completed by the end of 2007 . 
Should the review go according to plan , [PER Timmermans  ] said [ORG PvdA  ] will be able to " " save face , " " and acknowledge that [ORG JSF  ] " " makes sense . 
" " At any rate , [PER Timmermans  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] are " " past the point of no return " " on withdrawing from [ORG JSF  ] program participation . 
Afghanistan: Failure is Not an Option ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] indicated that as part of the government coalition formation agreement currently under discussion , the new government will likely support two budget supplementals -- 300 million [MISC Euros  ] each -- for Defense and [ORG Development Assistance  ] aimed at bolstering the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
He acknowledged that his party will " " have problems " " with the increase in spending for defense , and the commitment to [ORG JSF  ] will certainly put pressure on an already tight budget , but failure in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is " " not an option " " -- the [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG NATO  ] must succeed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , even if it means staying longer than the two year commitment . 
[PER Timmermans  ] admitted he initially opposed the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , suggesting that the mission was too difficult for [MISC Dutch  ] forces . 
Once the decision was made in favor of deployment , however , [PER Timmermans  ] noted there was " " no turning back " " in terms of [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] is a direct and honest contact who is well-plugged in to the coalition formation talks . 
He claims to be currently considering the [ORG MFA  ] 's EU Integration State Secretary position in the new government , but may instead opt SIPDIS to head his party in parliament . 
He has long opposed the [ORG JSF  ] investment case ; if he appears ready to concede defeat , then [MISC Dutch  ] procurement of [ORG JSF  ] is in good shape .
