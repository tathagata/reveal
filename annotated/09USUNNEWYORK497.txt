Reasons 1 . 
5 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Assistant Secretary of State for Verification , Compliance and Implementation , [PER Rose Gottemoeller  ] , held several bilateral meetings May 5 and 7 on the margins of the [ORG NPT Preparatory Committee  ] ( [ORG PrepCom  ] ) in [LOC New York  ] . 
This cable reports on her meetings with: Brazil’s Head of [ORG Delegation Luiz Filipe  ] de [PER Macedo Soares  ] , Australia’s Assistant Secretary for Arms Control and Counter-proliferation [PER John Sullivan  ] , Canada’s Ambassador [PER Marius Grinius  ] , Executive Secretary of the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization  ] ( [ORG CTBTO  ] ) [PER Tibor Toth  ] , Egypt’s Ambassador [PER Maged Abdelaziz  ] , [LOC Philippines  ] , Ambassador [PER Libran Cabactulan  ] ( President-designate of the 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] ) , Japan’s Ambassador [PER Tarui Sumio  ] , [ORG Conference  ] on Disarmament President , Algeria’s Ambassador [PER Idriss Jazairy  ] , and the [ORG United Kingdom’s  ] Ambassador [PER John Duncan  ] . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with Brazil’s Ambassador [PER Luiz Filipe de Macedo Soares  ] ( 7 May ) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Gottemoeller  ] opened the meeting by saying that there was a good story to tell on the [ORG Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  ] ( [MISC CTBT  ] ) as the [LOC United States  ] moved toward ratification . 
When the [ORG Senate  ] first addressed the [ORG Treaty  ] in 1999 , there were two main concerns which led to the negative vote in the [ORG Senate:  ] whether the treaty was verifiable and whether the [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear stockpile could be maintained without testing . 
There have been great strides in both these areas in the last ten years , and the [ORG Administration  ] would work closely with the [ORG Senate  ] , and particularly with those [MISC Senators  ] who were not members then , to ensure the facts were presented clearly . 
It would be hard work , but it was achievable. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Soares  ] said there was reason for optimism regarding the current [ORG PrepCom  ] The [MISC Zimbabwean  ] was an able diplomat who had successfully managed adoption of the [ORG Durban Convention  ] in one week . 
[PER Soares  ] noted that the debate thus far was very different from last year , saying contentious issues were not addressed , noting that the [LOC U.S.  ] opening statement had not addressed [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] itself had not been very aggressive . 
With the adoption of the [ORG RevCon  ] agenda and procedures , the essential work had been done . 
Now , if the parties could agree to a short statement , that would be helpful , noting that the Chairman would soon circulate a draft document for parties to consider. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Responding to A/S [PER Gottemoeller  ] , s question regarding his assessment of the state of play in the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] ( CD ) , [PER Soares  ] said that his impression was that the [MISC CD  ] would adopt a program of work ( POW ) along the lines of the [MISC Algerian  ] Ambassador’s proposal . 
[PER Soares  ] opined that he hadn’t heard of any opposition , and [LOC Pakistan  ] , in particular , had agreed to it . 
He wasn’t sure about [LOC Iran  ] , but felt they wouldn’t oppose as it wasn’t in their interest . 
A/S [PER Gottemoeller  ] noted that there was much work to be done in preparing for negotiations , but her impression was everyone could be ready to begin in January . 
She asked about support within the G 21 , to which [PER Soares  ] replied that in their last meeting , none had spoken against the [MISC Algerian  ] proposal . 
In an implied reference to linkages , [PER Soares  ] opined that it was important not to lose sight of the other issues on the [MISC CD  ] , s agenda , and that it was indeed possible to work on more than one issue at a time . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with [LOC Australia  ] , s Assistant Secretary for Arms Control and Counter-proliferation [PER John Sullivan  ] ( 7 May ) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Sullivan  ] began the meeting by congratulating the [LOC United States  ] on a successful [ORG PrepCom  ] and giving credit to the [LOC United States  ] for the positive atmosphere . 
He noted that nearly all delegations seemed to be showing some “restraint” this year , and there weren , t as many personal attacks as in past PrepComs . 
He added that other delegations had commented to him that even [LOC Iran  ] , s statements showed some constraint. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Sullivan  ] asked when the [ORG P5  ] 1 negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] were scheduled to commence . 
A/S [PER Gottemoeller  ] said that [LOC Washington  ] was still working out tactics and timing , but President [PER Obama  ] made it clear the [LOC Middle East  ] ( including [LOC Iran  ] ) was a priority for his [ORG Administration  ] ; the President , s selection of [PER George Mitchell  ] as the [LOC Middle East  ] envoy showed his dedication to resolving the [LOC Iran  ] issue quickly and diplomatically . 
A/S [PER Sullivan  ] said that the [ORG P5  ] should give credit to [ORG Arab League  ] partners for “reining in” [LOC Iran  ] , but had hopes that the [LOC United States  ] could lead peaceful [LOC Middle East  ] negotiations . 
He added that the new positive atmosphere of the [ORG NPT  ] community could pave the way for a [LOC Middle East  ] Nuclear Weapons Free Zone ( [ORG NWFZ  ] ) at the 2010 [ORG Review Conference  ] ( [ORG RevCon  ] ) . 
A/S [PER Gottemoeller  ] asked how the [MISC Australians  ] foresee the 2010 [ORG RevCon  ] unfolding: would it be all [LOC Middle East  ] , all the time , or would we focus on other issues ? 
[ORG A/S Sullivan  ] said that he believed the [LOC Middle East  ] issue must be resolved first before [ORG States Party  ] can make headway anywhere else . 
He noted his experience as the Ambassador to [LOC Cyprus  ] , and explained how he saw hatred passing down from generation to generation , and he believed the [LOC Middle East  ] was the same way. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Gottemoeller  ] raised the issue of [ORG Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty  ] ( [ORG FMCT  ] ) negotiations and asked what [LOC Australia  ] , s views were on Ambassador Jazairy’s non-paper . 
She said she was impressed with his ability to get consensus within the [ORG NAM  ] so quickly , although [LOC Israel  ] must be brought on board before any real action could take place on [ORG FMCT  ] negotiations . 
A/S [PER Sullivan  ] agreed with [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] , s comments , but said that [LOC Australia  ] was not clear on the [LOC US  ] plans for a way forward . 
He asked whether the [LOC US  ] plan was to move forward on negotiations without consensus , or was the plan to begin negotiations only after all [LOC States  ] agreed to commence negotiations ? 
He said [LOC Australia  ] was hesitant to make a decision on a way forward until they had clarification from the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] requested [PER Gary Larson  ] , Charge d , Affaires from the [ORG US Mission  ] to the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] ( [MISC CD  ] ) , speak to the [ORG FMCT  ] issue . 
He said that the process was progressing but the [LOC United States  ] was giving a lot of study on the best way forward . 
He noted that [LOC Australia  ] was only one Presidency away from becoming President of the [MISC CD  ] , and that that [ORG FMCT  ] negotiations may not begin until their Presidency , because of sensitivities with [LOC Israel  ] . 
[ORG A/S Sullivan  ] agreed and noted that his government had meetings scheduled with [LOC Israel  ] this week and that [ORG FMCT  ] probably would be raised . 
[ORG A/S Sullivan  ] asked whether the [LOC United States  ] believed other parties would expect quid-pro-quo verification measures , and [PER Mr. Larson  ] said one challenge for the nuclear weapons states and three [ORG non-states Party  ] to the [ORG NPT  ] would be handling expectations , including on negative security assurances ( NSAs ) . 
[ORG A/S Sullivan  ] noted that [LOC Australia  ] did not have a strong position on NSAs one way or another. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Sullivan  ] raised the issue of [LOC US  ] ratification of the [MISC CTBT  ] and asked what the [LOC US  ] position was on process and timelines . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] reiterated President [PER Obama  ] , s pledge to ratify at an early date , and noted that while the [LOC US  ] goal was to gain the [ORG Senate  ] , s advice and consent , we needed to do it carefully . 
[ORG A/S Sullivan  ] asked how post-START negotiations would be affected by [MISC CTBT  ] ratification . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] explained that START negotiations would commence earlier than [MISC CTBT  ] , but that [MISC CTBT  ] hearings would likely follow ratification of the post-START agreement . 
[ORG A/S Sullivan  ] noted that he had been struck by the [MISC South Korean  ] delegation , s remarks that [LOC US  ] ratification of the [MISC CTBT  ] would give the [LOC United States  ] a greater “moral authority” and “diplomatic legitimacy” within the nonproliferation community , and hoped that the new [ORG Administration  ] , s nonproliferation objectives would encourage or influence other countries ( i.e . 
[LOC Iran  ] ) fulfill their own nonproliferation obligations. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Sullivan  ] then raised the issue of the [MISC Russians  ] and his experience with them as Chairman of the [ORG Australia Group  ] . 
He noted that while the [MISC Russian  ] mood on post-START was positive for now , the issue with [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] could quickly sour negotiations , as it has in other fora . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with [LOC Canada  ] , s Ambassador [PER Marius Grinius  ] ( 7 May ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Grinius  ] noted his disapproval in the [MISC Russians  ] trying to link CFE and START issues , and noted the problems with [LOC PAROS  ] ; he hoped that [LOC Russia  ] would reconsider their plans for linking the two issues . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] asked [PER Grinius  ] about his take on the mood of the [ORG PrepCom  ] . 
He cited a pleasant meeting he recently had with the Ambassador from [LOC Egypt  ] , and compared it to a meeting before the [ORG PrepCom  ] in which the Ambassador was “very aggressive.” He believed most countries have much higher expectations for a positive [ORG PrepCom  ] following the positive remarks by [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] and President [PER Obama  ] , s statement in the opening remarks . 
He noted that all [LOC States  ] , [ORG Article VI  ] obligations have become much more important and he believes there will be renewed effort from all [LOC States  ] to encourage adherence to the [ORG Treaty  ] . 
He also stated that he believed the [LOC United States  ] had done a poor job highlighting their successes under [ORG Article VI  ] and hoped that the new [ORG Administration  ] would have a better public relations story than in the past. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Grinius  ] noted that during his trip to [LOC Washington  ] last week , he met with [PER John Wolfstahl  ] at the [ORG National Security Council  ] ( [ORG NSC  ] ) to discuss [MISC CTBT  ] and was encouraged by [LOC US  ] plans to submit the [ORG Treaty  ] to the [ORG Senate  ] . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] discussed the recent [MISC STRATCOM  ] conference on [MISC CTBT  ] and stockpile reliability . 
She noted that the [LOC US  ] voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing did not affect the confidence the [LOC United States  ] has in its stockpiles and the overall consensus was that acceding to the [MISC CTBT  ] probably would not put the reliability of the [LOC US  ] stockpile at risk. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Grinius  ] fully supported [LOC US  ] efforts to move quickly towards negotiations on [ORG FMCT  ] and noted that it was time for the [MISC CD  ] to “smoke out” [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Israel  ] on their positions . 
He asked how the [LOC United States  ] intended to use the [ORG US-India  ] nuclear cooperation agreement to advance nonproliferation objectives . 
[PER Adam Scheinman  ] from the [ORG NSC  ] said it was no longer considered the “US-India [LOC Deal”  ] and that the [LOC United States  ] was referring to it as the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( [ORG NSG  ] ) - [ORG India Cooperation  ] . 
[PER Grinius  ] did not think this rebranding was fair , saying that most [ORG NSG  ] members “gave up” and “joined the bandwagon” rather than fully supporting a nuclear agreement with [LOC India  ] . 
He also noted that before [LOC India  ] could enjoy open nuclear trade , it would have to do more in the form of export controls . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] agreed , stating that [LOC Washington  ] will be much harder on [LOC India  ] if they don , t strengthen export controls and nonproliferation measures. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Grinius  ] believed the [LOC Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free Zone  ] would be a dominant issue at the [MISC RevCon  ] . 
He noted [LOC Canada  ] , s pro-Israel policy and that his government was discussing ways to move forward on a [ORG NWFZ  ] before the [MISC RevCon  ] . 
[PER Grinius  ] passed a copy of the [MISC Canadian  ] paper on institutional reform , and highlighted its recommendation for a three person team , similar to the one in the [ORG BWC  ] , consisting of the past , present , and subsequent [ORG PrepCom Chairs  ] supported by the [ORG UN Office of Disarmament Affairs  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
He noted that having a three person team would allow further consultations in the lead up to the 2010 [MISC RevCon  ] and such a team could share the [PER Chairperson  ] , s responsibilities to better facilitate a [ORG Conference.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] then discussed [ORG Article X  ] and asked for [LOC Canada  ] , s position on [ORG DPRK  ] withdrawal . 
[PER Grinius  ] said he raised the same question during a meeting on the margins of the [ORG UN First Committee  ] , and everyone laughed . 
He believes that no country wants to address the question . 
He believes that [MISC States Parties  ] need to address the issue in full Plenary because the [ORG DPRK  ] fully believes that they are no longer party to the [ORG Treaty  ] . 
He suggested the [LOC United States  ] may be in a position to call for a meeting on the [ORG DPRK  ] and noted [LOC Canada  ] , s support for a formal discussion . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] asked whether he believed a smaller meeting with more like-minded states would be preferable , or if it should be a large scale meeting with all delegations . 
He noted his support for either , although he suggested that a smaller meeting would be easier to manage . 
[PER Scheinman  ] asked whether [LOC Canada  ] believed withdrawal and compliance issues could adequately be dealt with in the [ORG NPT  ] process , or if it needed to be elevated to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
[PER Grinius  ] said that [LOC Canada  ] believes it should first be handled in the [ORG NPT  ] channels and if no resolution is met , then it should be elevated . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with the Executive Secretary of the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization  ] ( [ORG CTBTO  ] ) [PER Tibor Toth  ] ( 7 May ) <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Executive Secretary [PER Toth  ] opened the meeting by thanking the [LOC United States  ] for its opening statement which was very supportive of the [ORG CTBTO  ] . 
He then asked about the [LOC US  ] strategy for gaining the [ORG Senate  ] , s advice and consent for the [MISC CTBT  ] . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] discussed the recent [MISC STRATCOM  ] conference on [MISC CTBT  ] and stockpile reliability . 
She further stated that the [ORG Administration  ] would ensure they had all the votes necessary before it formally requested the [ORG Senate  ] , s advice and consent. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Toth  ] then discussed the upcoming conference on verification , which will be held in [LOC Vienna  ] from 10-12 June 2009 . 
He explained that the intent of the meeting is to have technical level discussions on verification , and he believed it would be very helpful and fruitful if the [LOC United States  ] strongly supported the meeting and sent several technical representatives from government and national laboratories to provide presentations and serve on discussion panels . 
[PER Toth  ] then asked whether the Secretary would be willing to provide brief remarks at the [ORG Article  ] 14 Conference in [LOC New York  ] , after the [ORG UNGA  ] meeting this fall . 
He noted that the invitation would be going out soon , and [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] said she would inquire once she returned to [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] asked how the [ORG CTBTO  ] was preparing for alleged future [ORG DPRK  ] nuclear tests . 
[PER Toth  ] explained that the [ORG International Monitoring System  ] ( [ORG IMS  ] ) was monitoring the area regularly . 
[PER Toth  ] stated that the [ORG IMS  ] performed well after the 2006 [ORG DPRK  ] test , and he was confident the [ORG IMS  ] would detect any future test . 
[PER Toth  ] further stated that the [ORG IMS  ] was studying how to better prepare for the [ORG DPRK  ] vis-a-vis [LOC Iran  ] and other countries . 
He noted they were looking at additional site installations in the region and more active monitoring , but noted that the [ORG CTBTO  ] has a small budget and could only make limited increases . 
Before concluding the meeting , [PER Toth  ] asked that the [LOC United States  ] reconsider its $20M “red ink” policy towards the [ORG CTBTO  ] , noting that the [ORG Organization  ] will face extensive financial trouble in [LOC FY2010  ] . 
He said there was a $15-20M deficit in the regular budget , which will substantially affect the work of the Agency . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] asked if paying the [LOC U.S.  ] arrears would solve the [ORG CTBTO  ] , s financial problems or was their greater need . 
[PER Toth  ] replied that even after the [LOC U.S.  ] paid in full , the [ORG CTBTO  ] would still have a significant shortfall . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] said she would convey his concerns to [LOC Washington  ] . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with [LOC Egypt  ] , s Ambassador [PER Maged Abdelaziz  ] ( 7 May ) <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Abdelaziz  ] began by praising President [PER Obama  ] , s recent speech in [LOC Prague  ] and [LOC US/Russian  ] efforts to negotiate a follow-on START agreement . 
He then proceeded to ask about the new [ORG Administration  ] , s policy for the [LOC Middle East  ] in the context of the [ORG NPT  ] . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] said that policy still was evolving but that certain contours already should be clear: the President is serious about the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process and has appointed a special envoy to that end ; there is an evolving policy on [LOC Iran  ] , which includes direct diplomacy ; and the [ORG Administration  ] is advocating the quick commencement of negotiations on a verifiable FMCT . 
All of these initiatives , she argued , contribute to the kind of atmosphere that will be required to make progress on the 1995 [ORG Resolution  ] on the [LOC Middle East  ] at the 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] . 
[PER Abdelaziz  ] said he was encouraged the [LOC United States  ] finally was taking the issue seriously . 
He acknowledged that the 1995 [ORG Resolution  ] indeed was linked to the peace process , but he said this link cannot be abused . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has tried for years to foster peace in the region , and will continue to do so , but it is unwilling to wait fifty more years to see progress in implementing the 1995 [ORG Resolution  ] . 
He said a new approach to [LOC Iran  ] would be good , and that [LOC Iran  ] cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons , but the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear issue also should not prevent progress on implementing the [ORG Resolution  ] . 
The 1995 [ORG Resolution  ] was supposed to foster security and stability in the region , and for [LOC Cairo  ] the issue relates directly to national security ; statements from [MISC Israeli  ] , s Prime Minister that his state possesses nuclear weapons do not contribute to security or stability . 
[PER Abdelaziz  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] , s President soon will visit [LOC Washington  ] , and he expected all these issues to be raised with President [PER Obama  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] needs agreement on the implementation of the 1995 [ORG Resolution  ] at the 2010 [MISC RevCon  ] , and suggests a package approach to the issue that would include [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , and regional security . 
It further emphasized the need for definite timeframes for implementation . 
He said if the [LOC Middle East Resolution  ] is solved , everything else would fall into place for [LOC Egypt  ] , including [MISC CTBT  ] and [ORG CWC  ] . 
[PER Abdelaziz  ] acknowledged that the contours of policy elucidated by [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] address “big picture” goals for the region and the world , but said [LOC Egypt  ] would not sacrifice its regional security for global objectives . 
On FMCT he emphasized the need to deal with existing stocks of fissile material. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] asked about [LOC Egypt  ] , s view of the interest in nuclear energy throughout the region . 
[PER Abdelaziz  ] said it was spreading throughout the region , but states were concerned about perceived attempts to impose restrictions on civil nuclear technology . 
He said the idea of responsible vs. irresponsible states is very dangerous , and the best way to handle the growing interest in this technology was to strengthen the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
He respected [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] , s point that [ORG NPT Parties  ] have both rights and responsibilities , but warned against discriminatory approaches to civil nuclear technology. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Abdelaziz  ] said positive momentum toward the 2010 [MISC RevCon  ] has been established , especially with the decision to negotiate a follow-on START agreement , and the adoption of an agenda for the [MISC RevCon  ] . 
He said the [MISC RevCon  ] must produce a final document and progress must be made on the [LOC Middle East Resolution  ] , which would help bring all non-parties into the [ORG Treaty  ] . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] described the ways in which the [MISC US-India  ] civil nuclear cooperation agreement had brought [LOC India  ] further into the nonproliferation regime . 
[PER Abdelaziz  ] said if this were true , it would better his disposition toward the agreement . 
Finally , in an apparent attempt to portray [LOC Egypt  ] as a responsible member of the international community , [PER Abdelaziz  ] claimed that [LOC Egypt  ] had been offered nuclear scientists , materials and even weapons following the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , but [LOC Egypt  ] had refused all such offers . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] asked him how he knew this to be true , to which [PER Abdelaziz  ] replied he was in [LOC Moscow  ] at that time and had direct personal knowledge . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with [LOC Philippines  ] , Ambassador [PER Libran Cabactulan: President-designate  ] of the 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] ( 7 May ) <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Cabactulan  ] said the speeches at this year , s [ORG PrepCom  ] have been inspiring , but it remains to be seen what the ground truths are about states , goals for the [MISC RevCon  ] . 
He said expectations were high , but cautioned memories are not short , and states will remember the disappointments of 2005 . 
A couple concrete achievements before the [MISC RevCon  ] could catapult the Conference to success . 
He said he was in a listening mode and was ready to “roll-up his sleeves and hit the road.” [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] discussed the expected timetables for [LOC US  ] progress on a follow-on START agreement , the nuclear posture review , [MISC CTBT  ] , and FMCT . 
She said all of these new initiatives should set a positive atmosphere for the [MISC RevCon  ] and convince the world that the [LOC United States  ] is serious about its [ORG NPT Article VI  ] commitments ; however , she noted it would not only be the [LOC United States  ] that had heavy lifting to do . 
All [ORG NPT Parties  ] will have to work hard to make the 2010 [MISC RevCon  ] a success . 
In particular she noted the importance of dealing with the difficult problems of [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] asked about the 1995 [ORG Resolution  ] on the [LOC Middle East  ] and what role regional states like the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] might play to help achieve progress on the [ORG Resolution  ] in 2010 . 
[PER Cabactulan  ] said it was a very difficult subject that was affected by the peace process and other regional issues , but that progress must be made on the [ORG Resolution  ] , or the [MISC RevCon  ] could fall apart . 
He said progress on an FMCT and [LOC Israel  ] , s consideration of the [MISC CTBT  ] would increase the chances for progress on the [ORG Resolution  ] . 
He was unclear whether a simple reaffirmation of the [ORG Resolution  ] would satisfy [LOC Egypt  ] , but this was something he would investigate. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [PER Cabactulan  ] asked several basic questions on international fuel supply initiatives , expressing confusion about the many different proposals . 
He also asked how to mitigate concerns that such proposals reinterpret the [ORG NPT  ] , s [ORG Article IV  ] . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] and Director of Nonproliferation at the [ORG NSC  ] [PER Adam Scheinman  ] explained that the diversity of proposals in fact provided greater assurance of fuel supply and that such proposals represented ways of fulfilling the [ORG NPT  ] , s [ORG Article IV  ] in proliferation-responsible ways . 
[PER Cabactulan  ] was interested in these responses , but thought more work would need to be done to explain to the international community the benefits of such initiatives. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) Finally , [PER Cabactulan  ] said his door would always be open for discussion , and suggested he could play a moderating role within the [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] . 
( [PER COMMENT: Cabactulan  ] , though perhaps somewhat nave about the particular issues likely to confront him in his role as the President of the [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] , clearly was pleased with his appointment and determined to make the [MISC RevCon  ] a success . 
He appeared particularly receptive to consultations with the [LOC United States  ] throughout the course of preparations for the [MISC RevCon  ] . 
END COMMENT ) ( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with [LOC Japan  ] , s CD Ambassador [PER Tarui Sumio  ] ( 7 May ) <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Tarui  ] opened the meeting by observing that everyone was saying this year , s Prepcom was much different . 
He said that [LOC Japan  ] very much welcomed President [PER Obama  ] , s [LOC Prague  ] speech , and that the world had high expectations . 
[PER Tarui  ] cautioned that progress could be achieved in a step-by-step manner , but the world was expecting drastic actions . 
[PER Tarui  ] worried that if something tangible couldn , t be done quickly , there would be great disappointment . 
He offered that if negotiations could begin on FMCT , that would constitute a great breakthrough , adding that [LOC France  ] had expressed reservations on the [MISC Algerian  ] POW , but told him they expected negotiations on FMCT to begin in January . 
[PER Tarui  ] highlighted FMCT , [MISC CTBT  ] , and a follow-on to START as the three big issues that must be dealt with first . 
He added that [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] , s speech was welcomed even by [LOC Cuba  ] , and thus we must take advantage of the momentum it generated as soon as possible . 
[PER Tarui  ] asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to accept the [MISC Algerian  ] proposal , to which [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] replied affirmatively . 
[PER Tarui  ] noted that the [MISC Pakistani  ] Ambassador had told him very clearly that they were prepared to accept it as well. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] said that her list of priorities matched his and that progress on the three issues would constitute an important scene-setter for the [MISC RevCon  ] She noted that she had met with Ambassador [PER Jazairy  ] and told him she was impressed with his ability to get the [ORG NAM  ] to agree to his proposal and prepared to work with him to get FMCT negotiations started in January . 
On START follow-on , she noted that the negotiations had begun with a goal of having the treaty completed by December . 
This was a challenging goal , but she and [PER Anatoli Antonov  ] agreed that fifteen years of experience implementing START provided a good foundation from which to work . 
While optimistic of reaching the deadline , should negotiations take longer , she hoped our colleagues in the [MISC Revcon  ] would see our efforts as evidence of our sincerity . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] added that after this treaty was completed , work would begin on a subsequent treaty aimed at further reductions based on the conclusions of the [ORG Nuclear Posture Review  ] . 
ON [MISC CTBT  ] , [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] said that there was hard work ahead , but ten years experience has shown much progress on verification . 
There were a large number of new [ORG Senators  ] since the last time the Treaty was considered , and the [ORG Administration  ] would work to educate them on the issues . 
By the time of the [MISC Revcon  ] , we may have begun hearings , but the important thing was to ensure we have a successful vote. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) [PER Tarui  ] highlighted the recent speech of the [MISC Japanese  ] Foreign Minister , noting that they sought to use it to express support for President [PER Obama  ] , s speech by enunciating concrete steps that could be taken to further nuclear disarmament . 
The steps were divided into three tiers: 1 ) measures by nuclear weapons states , 2 ) measures by the world community , and 3 ) measures to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with [ORG Conference on Disarmament President  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , s Ambassador [PER Idriss Jazairy  ] ( 5 May ) <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) [PER Jazairy  ] opened the meeting expressing appreciation for the positive indications from [LOC Washington  ] for his efforts in the [MISC CD  ] . 
He noted his work with the current [MISC CD  ] presidents builds upon [MISC CD/1840  ] and that his objective was to develop a formulation in his proposal to sustain both [LOC United States  ] and [ORG NAM  ] support . 
He provided the [LOC United States  ] with a paper further explaining his proposal and noted that during his meeting with [PER Gary Samore  ] in [LOC Washington  ] earlier that week , Mr. [PER Samore  ] agreed that if the document was not tampered with , the [LOC United States  ] would support it . 
[PER Jazairy  ] was concerned that if states tampered with the document , the initiative to begin FMCT negotiations would unweave . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] indicated that the [LOC United States  ] would take counsel in [LOC Washington  ] on the matter . 
[PER Jazairy  ] noted that [LOC France  ] did not like the language on NSAs but told him that it would consider the [LOC US  ] position on the matter . 
He also noted that [PER Samore  ] was aware of the challenge presented by [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Jazairy  ] added he would gladly make himself available to the [MISC Israelis  ] as part of a P-6 presentation to [MISC CD  ] members , during which he would address their concerns directly . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] indicated the [LOC United States  ] would see what it could do concerning [LOC Israel  ] , s position .

( C ) [ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] queried [PER Jazairy  ] , s views on potential impacts of the transition to the [MISC Argentine  ] Presidency on sustaining support for his proposal and about [MISC Chinese  ] views . 
[PER Jazairy  ] did not believe the transition would be a problem and was unaware of any [MISC Chinese  ] concerns . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] noted that the [LOC US  ] was impressed with [PER Jazairy  ] , s achievement to consolidate [ORG NAM  ] support for the proposal and that the window of opportunity to launch FMCT negotiations was limited . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , s Ambassador [PER John Duncan  ] ( 5 May ) <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) [PER Duncan  ] raised three issues during the bilateral: [ORG NPT  ] , FMCT , and the [ORG Arms Trade Treaty  ] ( [ORG ATT  ] ) . 
On the [ORG NPT  ] , [PER Duncan  ] noted that a vision was lacking for the 2010 [LOC REVCON  ] and that articulating such a vision would not be achievable at this meeting . 
He noted the [ORG Acronym Institute  ] , s paper as a useful beginning to start thinking about the matter ( Comment: the AI is a [MISC UK-based  ] NGO ) . 
[PER Duncan  ] noted that difficulty with the [MISC French  ] on the [PER Agenda  ] was predictable behavior and that the [LOC United States  ] could encourage a [MISC French  ] response . 
He said that the [LOC United Kingdom  ] was ambivalent on a [MISC P-5  ] media statement . 
The [MISC Russians  ] indicated that they had ideas but did not believe excessive time should be expended trying to issue a statement as had been done at past PrepComs. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) On FMCT , [PER Duncan  ] noted that delegations were not staffed to support negotiation of an FMCT and that six months of preparation would be needed to prepare for negotiations . 
He noted that [LOC China  ] is uncomfortable with the forward momentum and had been attempting to prod the [MISC Russians  ] to press for more emphasis on [LOC PAROS  ] in the program of work . 
He noted that the [MISC CD  ] is the closest it has been to consensus in 4-5 years . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] realizes [LOC Israel  ] will be key in getting a mandate and that the [LOC United States  ] needs to engage [LOC Israel  ] . 
She also concurred with the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , s concern that tabling the [MISC Algerian  ] Proposal before it was ready could undermine the effort . 
Both delegations agreed that closing the deal probably would come under the [MISC Argentine  ] Presidency . 
[PER Duncan  ] noted the negotiations will be a long effort due to verification , though the [LOC United Kingdom  ] believes verification is possible . 
He also noted that the [LOC UK  ] has scheduled a trident test for May 18 , which has already been announced in accordance with the [ORG Hague Code of Conduct  ] , and expressed the hope that the test does not undermine [MISC CD  ] negotiations . 
He also shared the implied threat of the [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador that if the [LOC UK  ] did not stop publicly criticizing [LOC China  ] for its strategic modernization , that [LOC China  ] would make a public issue of the [MISC Trident  ] test. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the [ORG ATT  ] , [PER Duncan  ] noted that the effort was based on modern diplomacy . 
[ORG ATT  ] was neither an export control nor a disarmament mechanism . 
He noted that there currently was no framework for international arms controls and that standards needed to trickle into legislation . 
He emphasized that the goal of the [ORG ATT  ] was not to stop all military sales , but to introduce “best practices” regarding export controls . 
[ORG A/S Gottemoeller  ] has cleared this cable .
