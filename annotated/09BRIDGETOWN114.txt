[PER D. Brent Hardt  ] , f or reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Antiguan  ] PM Spencer’s February 17 announcement of March 12 as the date for parliamentary elections was almost immediately overshadowed by an announcement by the [ORG Securities and Exchange Commission  ] of action being taken against [MISC U.S.-Antiguan  ] citizen Sir [PER Allen Stanford  ] for “massive , on-going fraud.” In the run-up to these announcements , election violence involving the fire bombing of opposition offices had escalated the election rhetoric that has polarized the local populace and led the [ORG OAS  ] to warn both parties to rein in their followers . 
Local fears over [PER Stanford  ] indictment have led to a run on the [ORG Stanford Financial Group’s  ] subsidiary the [ORG Bank of Antigua  ] , with depositors lining up for an hour or more to withdrawal their money . 
The Governor of the [ORG Eastern Caribbean Central Bank  ] , seeking to stem the bank run , contacted the Embassy to seek guidance on the implications of the [ORG SEC  ] complaint for the [ORG Bank of Antigua  ] . 
In a country already burdened with headline-grabbing rising crime and a tight economy , the pre-election landscape is suddenly quite rocky and unpredictable . 
End summary. --------------------------------------- PM [PER Spencer  ] Sets March 12 elections Date --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Spencer  ] called on the Governor General to issue the writ for election for March 12 during his live televised address to the nation Tuesday evening , February 17 . 
Spencer’s address drew heavily on the run- up to the 1999 elections and the 2004 elections casting the opposition [ORG Antigua Labour Party  ] ( [ORG ALP  ] ) as corrupt and inept . 
Many still contend that the necessary preparations have not been made to hold the elections by the date set. ----------------------------------- Pre-Elections Violence on the Rise ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Just prior to the [MISC PM’s  ] announcement of the election date , the district offices of two [ORG ALP  ] candidates were set aflame early on the morning of February 16 . 
The local constituency offices of [ORG ALP  ] candidates [PER Asot Michael  ] and [PER Gail Christian  ] were both targeted with what appear to be “Molotov cocktails” in apparent acts of election violence and intimidation , according to Police Commissioner [PER Tom Bennett  ] . 
The police are investigating the matter , but it appears to be the ad hoc work of party supporters , not acts coordinated or perpetrated by one of the parties directly . 
[ORG ALP  ] Opposition Leader [PER Steadroy Benjamin  ] contended that the offices of [ORG ALP  ] candidate [PER Christian  ] were targeted because she is widely believed to hold a narrow lead in her race to unseat PM [PER Spencer  ] . 
He predicted there will be more violence before the election are over due to the unprecedented polarization among [MISC Antiguans  ] . 
The fire bombing episodes , along with earlier small-scale crowd violence at some party rallies , has prompted the [ORG OAS  ] , which is set to send an observer mission to [LOC Antigua  ] , to call on the leadership of both parties to dissuade their supporters from taking violent actions . 
[ORG OAS  ] Assistant SECGEN [PER Albert Ramdin  ] expressed hope that [MISC Antiguan  ] elections would follow the [LOC Caribbean  ] norm and be largely incident-free , fair , and democratic. -------------------------------- Fallout from [PER Stanford  ] Indictment -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) No sooner did the [MISC PM’s  ] election date announcement hit the airwaves , when news of a major [ORG SEC  ] indictment against [MISC Antigua’s  ] richest citizen , primary banker , and second largest local employer and philanthropist , Sir [PER Allen Stanford  ] , shock the small island -- with ripples extending throughout the [ORG Eastern Caribbean  ] . 
Local [MISC Antiguan  ] depositors at the [ORG Stanford Financial Group’s  ] subsidiary The [ORG Bank of Antigua  ] ( [ORG BOA  ] ) lined up on February 18 to withdraw their funds in what has been characterized as a bank run , following rumors and fears that [LOC U.S.  ] authorities would seek to seize all assets related to [PER Stanford  ] and his companies . 
Commissioner [PER Bennett  ] confirmed that there is some concern of unrest , noting that , as of the middle of the day , there were no incidents at any of the BOA’s branches . 
PM [PER Spencer  ] appealed for calm during his live national broadcast , and rebuked the [ORG ALP  ] for trying to turn the indictment into a partisan political issue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Eastern Caribbean Central Bank  ] Governor Sir [PER Dwight Venner  ] , meanwhile , phoned the Charge from his office in [LOC St. Kitts  ] seeking further clarification regarding the SEC’s proposed actions . 
He said that the [ORG ECCB  ] was flying in money to back withdrawals at the [ORG Bank of Antigua  ] for now , but that they could not do so for long . 
Prior to the [ORG SEC  ] case , he said the bank had adequate liquidity and reasonable debt-equity ratios . 
He was looking for information that would allow the [ORG ECCB  ] and the government of [LOC Antigua  ] to reassure depositors . 
He has subsequently been in touch with the [ORG SEC  ] on the matter . 
At some point soon , the [ORG ECCB  ] may be required to step in and take control of the bank to protect the interests of depositors . 
Embassy appreciates [ORG SEC  ] coordination on this issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Steadroy Benjamin  ] speculated that the PM called for elections immediately after the [PER Stanford  ] indictment due to the potential fallout should things go very badly for [PER Stanford  ] . 
[PER Benjamin  ] sought to link the announcement to the government’s “undisclosed dealings with the [PER Stanford  ] group , ” though the current opposition was in power when [PER Stanford  ] first established himself in [LOC Antigua  ] , so his ability to point fingers will be limited . 
Benjamin’s claim was disputed by former Minister of State [PER Aziz Hadeed  ] , who said he was aware of the proposed election date several days prior to the announcement. ---------------------------- Meanwhile , on the [LOC Streets...  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) These latest shockers come on the heels of another headline-grabbing spike in violent crime in [LOC Antigua  ] . 
Incidents of violent crime continue to rise against locals and tourists alike . 
However , in an economy almost wholly dependent upon tourism , high profile attacks on foreigners are particularly damaging to the local economy . 
The recent murder of an [MISC Australian  ] yacht captain made international news , driving away many of the mega yachts that regularly visit the island . 
The murder followed on the heels of the murder of a honeymoon couple from the [LOC UK  ] last summer . 
In both cases the police were able to apprehend suspects , which are now awaiting trial , [PER Bennett  ] told us , but the short-term impact on a tourism-driven economy already depressed by the global recession will not be easily mitigated by the apprehension of suspects. ------------------------------------------ Cricket Test Match Placates Masses for Now ------------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The one bright spot for the country , Commissioner [PER Bennett  ] commented , has been a cricket test match between [LOC England  ] and the [ORG West Indies  ] team being held in [LOC Antigua  ] this week . 
The high-profile event has tempered somewhat people’s concerns over the elections or the [PER Stanford  ] indictment . 
The region’s love of cricket means crowds are packed in the [ORG Antigua Recreation Grounds Stadium  ] . 
Yet even this silver lining has a touch of grey , as in what has been termed “a national embarrassment” in regional press the match could not be held at the recently constructed 20,000 person stadium named in honor of local cricket legend Sir [PER Vivian Richards  ] because of poor field conditions . 
Most blame the poor conditions on the slapdash construction done by the [MISC Chinese  ] government , which built the stadium as a gift to the [MISC Antiguan  ] government , local commentator [PER Winston Derrick  ] said . 
It has also not been lost on regional commentators that one of the biggest financial backers of the [ORG West Indies  ] cricket team , and the person who brought the more marketable 20/20 cricket format to the [LOC Caribbean  ] , is none other than Sir [PER Allen Stanford  ] -- and many are beginning to wonder how his indictment might hurt a team that is just beginning to rebound from a drubbing in the 2007 cricket World Cup. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG United Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG UPP  ] ) , once the clear favorite to return to power , now has a real fight on its hands , which few predicted just two months ago . 
Rapidly falling numbers for tourism throughout the region coupled with increasing stories of murdered tourists , the indictment of the second largest employer on the island for fraud , and a failed cricket match finds [LOC Antigua  ] in perhaps the perfect storm . 
Many worry that these issues could not only spell disaster for the [ORG UPP  ] , but for the country’s economy as a whole , leading to a severe economic depression and intolerable unemployment creating more violence and a cycle of less tourism , more unemployment and more crime . 
It is unclear if either party will try hard to use the [PER Stanford  ] indictment as an election issue -- [PER Stanford  ] amassed his fortune under an [ORG ALP  ] government , and was knighted by a [ORG UPP  ] government , so all hands are likely equally dirty . 
Of more concern for [LOC Antigua  ] is when the run of “bad luck” will stop , and whether either party is positioned to turn things around on crime and the economy .
