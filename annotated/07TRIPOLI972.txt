REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: A [LOC U.S.  ] company was recently presented with a [MISC Libyan  ] government contract containing [LOC Israel  ] boycott language . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] company refused to sign the contract and ultimately succeeded in having the language removed , facilitating completion of the deal . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) In the process of negotiating a multi-million dollar spare parts contract with [LOC U.S.  ] company [ORG Oshkosh Trucks  ] ( of [ORG Oshkosh  ] , [LOC WI  ] ) , [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Procurement Authority  ] ( [ORG NPA  ] ) presented a draft contract containing language requiring a comprehensive boycott of [LOC Israel  ] . 
The language was expansive , barring any business contact with or investment in [LOC Israel  ] , and calling on the [LOC U.S.  ] company to abide by all laws and decisions related to the [ORG Arab League  ] 's ( [LOC AL  ] 's ) boycott action . 
[ORG Oshkosh  ] representatives refused to sign the contract and walked away from the deal . 
After doing so , they contacted post and met with [PER Econoff  ] to discuss options . 
[PER Econoff  ] confirmed [ORG Oshkosh  ] 's judgment that it could not legally sign a contract containing such language , nor could it empower an agent do so on its behalf . 
[PER Econoff  ] also reminded [ORG Oshkosh  ] of its obligation to report the incident to the [ORG Department of Commerce  ] . 
3 . 
( C ) In the end , [ORG Oshkosh  ] 's hard line did not scuttle the deal . 
Just hours before they were due to depart the country , the team was called back to the bargaining table by the [ORG NPA  ] and was informed that the offensive language had been removed in its entirety . 
To reinforce the decision and avoid potential for subsequent misunderstanding , the parties agreed on and signed only an [MISC English-language  ] version of the contract ( i.e. , without a signed [MISC Arabic  ] translation ) . 
4 . 
( C ) Charge d'Affaires subsequently raised the issue with MFA Secretary for the [ORG Americas Dr.  ] [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] , stressing that such SIPDIS contract stipulations would undermine [ORG GOL  ] efforts to attract [LOC U.S.  ] business . 
( Note: Senior [ORG GOL  ] officials have repeatedly expressed disappointment that more [LOC U.S.  ] firms are not rushing to re-enter the [MISC Libyan  ] market . 
End note . 
) [PER Fituri  ] responded that the [ORG GOL  ] and private entities are compelled by [MISC Libyan  ] law stemming from the [LOC AL  ] resolution to include such language . 
Drawing a comparison between the " unilateral " [MISC American  ] imposition of sanctions on [LOC Libya  ] in the 1980 's and 1990 's , he argued that it would be " hypocritical " of the USG to insist that [ORG Arab  ] states not enforce implementation of the anti-Israel boycott . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: This is the second instance of [ORG GOL  ] boycott enforcement we have heard of in the past month . 
( The earlier case involved two [MISC German  ] firms that were reportedly asked to sign letters attesting that they were in compliance with the [LOC Israel  ] boycott as a pre-condition for securing required stamps on export documents from the [MISC Libyan  ] People 's [MISC Bureau  ] in [LOC Berlin  ] . 
) The fact that the [MISC Libyan  ] government partner in the [ORG Oshkosh  ] deal ultimately relented and removed the offensive language suggests that the [ORG GOL  ] is willing to be pragmatic when seeking products or services that it deems to be particularly important . 
Post will continue to be alert to new incidents , and will remind [LOC U.S.  ] companies of their obligations under [LOC U.S.  ] law , as well as continue to impress upon the [ORG GOL  ] the desirability of ending this practice .
