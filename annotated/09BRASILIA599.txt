( C ) SUMMARY . 
It appears that an internal turf battle between [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Defense  ] and [ORG External Relations Ministries  ] led to Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] 's refusal to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] 's request to interview a [MISC Brazilian  ] scientist over his book on nuclear weapons . 
Minister [PER Jobim  ] now recognizes that refusing [ORG IAEA  ] access to [MISC Brazilian  ] personnel and facilities risks creating an impression that the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) does not support global non-proliferation goals , and has expressed a willingness to find a way forward on the book matter. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The idea of [LOC Brazil  ] signing an [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) [MISC Additional Protocol  ] is dead for now , according to [ORG Ministry of Exterior Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) officials . 
President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] 's administration has always been a reluctant supporter of existing non-proliferation measures and remains wary of new ones . 
Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] has now emerged as the strongest voice in defense of [LOC Brazil  ] 's traditional opposition to an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
The environment is unlikely to change until a new president enters office in 2011 . 
See para 9 for Embassy suggestions on how to lay the groundwork bilaterally and multilaterally for the incoming [MISC Brazilian  ] government to engage in a constructive way on non-proliferation . 
An upcoming visit to [LOC Washington  ] by Minister [PER Jobim  ] , scheduled for May 22 , presents an excellent opportunity for high-level engagement with this key player . 
Furthermore , an informal visit by a few high-level USG non-proliferation officials in the near term could be helpful to increase our understanding of [MISC Brazilian  ] views and lay the foundation for future advances on non-proliferation . 
END SUMMARY . 
OBSTACLES TO A GOOD IDEA <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The proposal for [LOC Brazil  ] to sign an [ORG IAEA  ] Additional Protocol has been rejected by the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government . 
President [PER Lula  ] made that decision based on advice from Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] , [ORG MRE  ] 's Director of the [ORG Division for Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies  ] , Minister [PER Santiago Mourao  ] ( strictly protect ) told [ORG Post  ] 's Environment , Science and Technology , and Health ( [ORG ESTH  ] ) Counselor at a meeting on April 24 . 
[PER Mourao  ] acknowledged the recent conversation between President [PER Obama  ] and President [PER Lula  ] on nuclear non-proliferation , but this has not caused [LOC Brazil  ] to alter its position . 
In a meeting with Ambassador [PER Sobel May  ] 8 , [ORG MRE  ] Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Vera Machado  ] confirmed that [LOC Brazil  ] is not open to discussion on signing an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] , citing language in the December 2008 [ORG National Defense Strategy  ] prepared by the [ORG Ministry of Defense.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Lula Administration  ] has been a reluctant supporter of existing non-proliferation measures and remains wary of new ones . 
In his initial campaign for the [LOC Presidency  ] , [PER Lula  ] stated that if he had been President he would not have signed the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] . 
Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] has now emerged as the strongest defender of [LOC Brazil  ] 's tradition opposition to an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
According to [PER Mourao  ] , there are other ( unnamed ) supporters of this position , as well , both within the [LOC Presidency  ] and [ORG MRE  ] . 
[PER Mourao  ] has been the strongest proponent of signing , but now says that he will back off . 
He joked , " I would deserve your Medal of [LOC Honor  ] if I were to raise the issue again " in the current environment . 
In 2008 , [PER Mourao  ] and representatives of other [MISC Brazilian  ] nuclear technical bodies had concluded that there was no technical obstacle to [LOC Brazil  ] signing and complying with an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] D ) . 
In February 2009 , [PER Othon Pinheiro  ] , the Director-President of [ORG Eletrobras Termonuclear S.A.  ] , had floated his personal idea -- one that had not been raised elsewhere within the government -- of an alternative inspection arrangement that fell short of an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) , which [LOC Washington  ] rejected as an unacceptable substitute ( [ORG REFTEL  ] C ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Defense Ministry  ] 's resistance stems from concerns about possible inspections of the [ORG Navy  ] 's enrichment facility in [LOC Aramar  ] , State of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and of the propulsion unit for a planned nuclear powered submarine . 
Minister [PER Jobim  ] pointed to these concerns in a press interview in [ORG Gazeta Mercantil  ] in March . 
[PER Pinheiro  ] , a former admiral , also acknowledged the military 's sensitivity to outside inspections . 
( [ORG COMMENT: Post  ] has long noticed a sharp contrast between the openness of the civilian nuclear energy sector [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00000599 002 OF 003 and the research and enrichment work of the [MISC Brazilian  ] military . 
END COMMENT . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) An internal turf battle over who has the lead in determining [LOC Brazil  ] 's stance on multilateral nuclear obligations appears to underlie Minister [PER Jobim  ] 's decision to block efforts by the [ORG IAEA  ] to meet with a [MISC Brazilian  ] researcher ( [PER Dalton Barrosa  ] ) , who wrote a doctoral thesis and a book relating to nuclear weapons ( [ORG REFTEL  ] B ) . 
The turf battle arose because [ORG MRE  ] had seemed prepared -- without prior consultation with the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] -- to allow [ORG IAEA  ] officials to interview a [ORG Defense Ministry  ] scientist . 
[PER Jobim  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on May 3 that he would not let [ORG MRE  ] speak for the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] . 
Nonetheless , [PER Jobim  ] told the Ambassador that he is aware that the [MISC Brazilian  ] decision has now generated controversy and undermined [LOC Brazil  ] 's standing as a supporter of non-proliferation standards . 
He is now looking for a way to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] that does not undermine what he views as his authority on nuclear issues. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
Although [ORG MRE  ] insists that it has the lead on [MISC Additional Protocol  ] issues and that the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] does not play , it is our view that , after President [PER Lula  ] , Minister [PER Jobim  ] has the most clout on nuclear issues . 
As a result , although he will not agree with us on all aspects of the nuclear issues , he is the principal [ORG GOB  ] player we need to engage . 
Minister [PER Jobim  ] 's May 22 visit to [LOC Washington  ] provides an excellent opportunity to make progress toward a satisfactory resolution of the book matter . 
Post encourages meetings with him at the highest levels , in which this issue , as well as the importance of the universal application of an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] , are raised with him in a non-confrontational manner . 
END COMMENT . 
POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS FORWARD <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) With under 20 months remaining , the [ORG Lula Administration  ] appears unlikely to reconsider the issue of an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
Post believes that direct pressure to do so would not be successful and could be counterproductive as the government might react even more strongly , making it difficult for the incoming government to walk back a hardline position . 
As Under Secretary [PER Machado  ] indicated , the [ORG National Defense Strategy  ] has language that can be read to mean [LOC Brazil  ] won't accept an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] or other inspection regimes while the nuclear weapon states have not made substantial progress in disarming . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] was very late to the party on joining the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] , but eventually did so . 
We can envision a similar pattern taking place with the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
As a matter of policy , [LOC Brazil  ] wants to uphold all international obligations , particularly those from the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
This leaves the [MISC Brazilians  ] in a difficult position balancing support for non-proliferation standards with a strong domestic political constituency that believes [LOC Brazil  ] 's nuclear program should be free of any outside oversight , as articulated in the [ORG National Defense Strategy.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Post offers the following three-prong approach for laying the groundwork for [LOC Brazil  ] 's eventual acceptance of an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
The goal would be to look toward the new [MISC Brazilian  ] administration taking up the issue when it comes to power in 2011. - BILATERALLY . 
Post suggests that the [ORG USG  ] directly and through friends and allies educate [MISC Brazilians  ] likely to play key roles in the new government about the non-proliferation regime , how an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] works , and how it does not impose an unacceptable burden on a country 's nuclear program . 
These [MISC Brazilians  ] would include likely presidential candidates Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] and [ORG Civilian Household  ] ( Prime ) Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and their likely foreign affairs advisors ( [PER Sergio Amaral  ] for [PER Serra  ] and [PER Luciano Coutinhos  ] , President of [ORG BNDES  ] , in the [LOC Presidency  ] ) . 
Also , leaders in the civilian nuclear field , such as [PER Pinheiro  ] , key officials at the [ORG National Commission  ] on [ORG Nuclear Energy  ] ( [ORG CNEN  ] ) , the [ORG General Institutional Security  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) , and the electric and nuclear energy companies ( Electrobras , Electronuclear , and [ORG Industrias Nucleares Brasileiras  ] ) . 
Moreover , [ORG Navy  ] and other [ORG Defense Ministry  ] officials who are willing should be provided with opportunities to see how inspections are carried out elsewhere , so as to reduce their concerns about excessive intrusiveness . 
Finally , legislators , journalists , and [ORG NGOs  ] could be briefed and/or brought to the [LOC United States  ] to learn about the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] . 
This educational campaign would need to disarm the concerns about an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] posing a real threat to national security and to create a more positive view on an Additional Protocol. - An informal visit by a few senior [ORG USG  ] non-proliferation officials could be helpful to keep a dialogue on non-proliferation going . 
This would avoid having the current differences with the [ORG Lula Administration  ] over the [MISC Additional Protocol  ] and the release of [PER Barrosa  ] 's book ( and the subsequent denial of permission for an [ORG IAEA  ] team to interview him ) undercut the rest of our non-proliferation agenda . 
According to MRE Under Secretary [PER Vera Machado  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] is close to internal agreement on language that would allow [LOC Brazil  ] to agree on using the [ORG Argentine-Brazilian Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials  ] ( [ORG ABACC  ] ) to meet requirements in the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] . 
She thought this would be finalized in the latter half of June , making July a good date for a team to visit . 
If such a team comes to [LOC Brazil  ] we suggest that they meet with [PER Civilian Household  ] ( Prime ) Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] , Minister of [ORG Mines and Energy  ] [PER Edson Lobao  ] , Minister of Science and Technology [PER Sergio Resende  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , and [ORG MRE  ] Under Secretaries for Political Affairs [PER Machado  ] and for Energy [PER Andre Amado.  ] - MULTILATERALLY . 
[LOC Brazil  ] does not like to be isolated internationally . 
This is one of the most powerful reasons why it eventually joined the [ORG NPT  ] . 
The greater the number of other countries that sign an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] and multilateral bodies that endorse it , the greater the pressure on [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Furthermore , the more the [ORG IAEA  ] , the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] and other multilateral bodies speak positively towards universal use of [MISC Additional Protocols  ] , the more likely that [LOC Brazil  ] will eventually come around. - [LOC ARGENTINA  ] . 
[LOC Argentina  ] will play a pivotal role in moving [LOC Brazil  ] forward , and any [ORG USG  ] team that visits [LOC Brazil  ] to discuss this issue should visit [LOC Argentina  ] afterward . 
Currently , [LOC Argentina  ] has not pushed [LOC Brazil  ] very hard on signing an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] , and we should encourage it to do so . 
[LOC Argentina  ] has accepted the view that , because both [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] concluded their [MISC Quadpartite Agreement  ] with the [ORG IAEA  ] in 1997 under the umbrella of the 1991 the [ORG Argentine-Brazilian Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials  ] ( [ORG ABACC  ] ) , [LOC Argentina  ] cannot agree to an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] without [LOC Brazil  ] doing so too . 
If a way could be found for [LOC Argentina  ] to sign an [MISC Additional Protocol  ] without [LOC Brazil  ] having to do so , it would place enormous pressure on [LOC Brazil  ] to follow suit .
