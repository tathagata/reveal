PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 6 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The [LOC UK  ] plans to designate three [ORG Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( [ORG LIFG  ] ) individuals to the [ORG UN  ] 1267 committee in the next few weeks , but first requests any [ORG USG  ] information on the potential designees and whether we will support the designation . 
Once they get [LOC U.S.  ] agreement to the designation , the [LOC UK  ] will pre-notify [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , and eventually the other [MISC G-7  ] members and the [ORG EU  ] members of the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] is not currently asking the [LOC U.S.  ] to co-sponsor . 
END SUMMARY 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] plans to designate three [MISC Libyan  ] members of [ORG LIFG  ] ( Maftah [PER Mohamed ELMABRUK  ] ; Abdelrazag Elsharif ELOSTA ; and [PER Abdulbasit ABDULRAHIM  ] ) to the [ORG UN  ] 's 1267 committee soon , according to [PER Giles Cutler  ] , 1267 Expert on the [ORG Sanctions Team  ] , Foreign and [ORG Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) . 
[PER Cutler  ] supplied us with a current draft of the Statement of Case ( [ORG SOC  ] ) ( [ORG Para  ] 5 ) , which , if approved at the minister-level , will be the version given to the [ORG UN  ] , other members and the designees themselves . 
Timeline -------- 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Once the [ORG USG  ] shares our information on these individuals with the [LOC UK  ] , and assures that we support the designations , the [ORG SOC  ] will go to [ORG FCO  ] ministers for approval - which should take three to five days , according to [PER Cutler  ] . 
It is unclear if Foreign Secretary Milliband needs to approve this directly . 
Within a few days of ministerial approval , the [LOC UK  ] will pre-notify [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , which will begin the two-week clock prior to submitting names to the [ORG UN  ] . 
Later in that two-week window , the [LOC UK  ] will pre-notify the other [MISC G-7  ] countries and [ORG EU  ] members of the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] has not yet approached any other governments regarding these names , nor have they shared the [ORG SOC  ] with [LOC UK  ] embassies or their mission to the [ORG UN  ] ( which is not uncommon at this point , according to [PER Cutler  ] ) . 
The government feels , however , that any potential problems would come from [LOC Libya  ] , if at all , so will focus its efforts there . 
The [LOC UK  ] is still trying to work out its best strategy for approaching the Government of [LOC Libya  ] , whether through intelligence , diplomatic or other channels . 
The [LOC UK  ] does not want to take any action regarding other governments until hearing back from the [ORG USG  ] . 
No internal decision has been made as to whether the [LOC UK  ] will request [LOC U.S.  ] co-sponsorship , but an indication of whether we would be willing to do so if asked would be appreciated , said [PER Cutler  ] .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Draft Text of [LOC UK  ] Statement of [ORG Case: RESTRICTED/FOR  ] RELEASE TO US ONLY THREE [MISC UK-BASED  ] [ORG LIFG  ] FINANCIERS The [ORG Libyan Islamic Fighting Group  ] ( [ORG LIFG  ] ) is an [MISC Islamist  ] extremist group formed in 1990 in the [LOC Afghanistan  ] / [LOC Pakistan  ] border area .
