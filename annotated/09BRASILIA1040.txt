Reason: 1.4 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Post has recently held extensive conversations with [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities on the NPT revcon , particularly in connection with the August 5-6 visit of [ORG NSC  ] WMD coordinator [PER Samore  ] ( reported septel ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] believes that a successful revcon will be in its interest but defines success as the absence of public disunity . 
As a non-nuclear weapons state , [LOC Brazil  ] believes that the key to a harmonious revcon will be commitment on the part of the [ORG NWS  ] to disarmament and officially places a higher priority on this goal than on reinforcing nonproliferation standards against challenges from [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's secondary interest will be in protecting its nuclear power program , especially the navy-run enrichment facility , from closer international scrutiny . 
Approaches to [LOC Brazil  ] should build upon President [PER Obama  ] 's [LOC Prague  ] speech committing the [ORG USG  ] to disarmament and should be crafted to use [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire to be treated as a world power to ask it to take a leading role in the success of the revcon . 
Frequent engagement with high-level [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities can be useful . 
As [LOC Brazil  ] will begin a term as a non-permanent member of the [ORG UN Security Council  ] in January , its approach on revcon-related issues will be calculated to enhance its standing as a key [MISC UNSC  ] member . 
The [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) should be included prominently in [ORG USG  ] outreach as it controls [LOC Brazil  ] 's enrichment program and has been most resistant to engaging on noproliferation out of concern that such engagement will lead to greater restrictions on its activities . 
Answers to reftel questions appear in paragraphs 2 and 3 below. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Answers to reftel paragraph 6: -- General attitude: The [ORG GOB  ] supports all major arms control regimes . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is strongly influenced by its own decision to forego its nuclear weapons program and join the NPT . 
It views the NWS' commitment to disarmament as the core of the [ORG Treaty  ] and has conditioned further participation in international nonproliferation efforts on greater disarmament . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has reacted negatively to the decision to help [LOC India  ] 's nuclear industry , regarding this as rewarding [LOC India  ] for not joining the NPT . 
-- Position in CD and Revcon: [LOC Brazil  ] is likely to support further arms control measures ( [MISC CTBT  ] , FMCT ) and look for the revcon to place additional emphasis on disarmament . 
-- [PER Partner  ] countries: [LOC Brazil  ] coordinates its nuclear policy with [LOC Argentina  ] and should be expected to work with other [ORG NNWS  ] to tilt the revcon toward disarmament over nonproliferation . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) authorities have indicated an openness to working with the [ORG USG  ] and other [ORG NWS  ] prior to the revcon . 
While [LOC Brazil  ] 's relationship with [LOC Iran  ] does not extend to close cooperation or partnership , it is worth noting that [LOC Brazil  ] maintains a cordial commercial relationship with [LOC Iran  ] and generally refrains from direct criticism of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , preferring to blame proliferation problems on the slow pace of disarmament , regional tensions and [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear program . 
-- Key [ORG GOB  ] personnel: [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign policy is conducted by the [ORG MRE  ] . 
Under Secretary [PER Vera Machado  ] will be in the lead for the revcon and will coordinate with [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassadors in [LOC New York  ] , [LOC Vienna  ] and [LOC Geneva  ] . 
Because of its ownership of the enrichment process , the [ORG MOD  ] will also play a key role and can be expected to resist any pressure to curb member states' right to enrichment or additional scrutiny of enrichment facilities . 
-- Role in international organizations: [LOC Brazil  ] is one of the leaders of the developing world in international organizations . 
As a [ORG NNWS  ] that gave up its nuclear program , the [ORG GOB  ] believes it carries a great deal of influence among other [ORG NNWS  ] . 
-- Policy process: The [ORG MRE  ] is key in setting [LOC Brazil  ] 's nonproliferation and arms control policies . 
The [LOC Presidency  ] , [ORG MOD  ] , [ORG Government Security Office  ] and [ORG National Commission  ] on Nuclear Energy are also involved . 
[ORG MRE  ] will consult with these other agencies and prodice policies for [LOC Presidency  ] endorsement that reflect everyone 's input . 
As a result , one [ORG Ministry ,  ] in the case of nonproliferation issues usually the [ORG MOD  ] , can often effectively veto new initiatives by blocking consensus . 
-- Key policy factors: A key foreign policy concern is attaining a permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
To gain this , the [ORG GOB  ] tries to avoid taking controversial positions and track its policies with what will appeal to the largest number of [ORG UN  ] members , i.e. the [ORG NAM  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] will not be above grandstanding to the [ORG NNWS  ] by opposing the [ORG P5  ] if it believes this will build support for [LOC Brazil  ] 's cause , but will strive for consensus and the outward appearance of unity . 
-- [ORG Arms Control Personnel:  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] missions in [LOC New York  ] , [LOC Geneva  ] and [LOC Vienna  ] do not have full time employees dedicated to arms control and nonproliferation , although these issues compose a large portion of the work of these [MISC Brazilian  ] missions . 
-- Key Meetings: The [ORG MRE  ] augments its overseas missions during key meetings with staff from the [ORG Division of Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies  ] . 
-- Role of non-government entities: The nuclear power industry , academia and [ORG NGOs  ] play little or no role in the formation of [MISC Brazilian  ] policy . 
Nuclear power is seen as important for the country 's long-term energy needs , and [LOC Brazil  ] 's nuclear power program received a strong official endorsement when it was identified in the 2008 [ORG Defense Strategy  ] as vital to national security . 
Some [ORG NGOs  ] have expressed reservations about the environmental effects of nuclear power , but these have little influence. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Answers to reftel paragraph 7: -- As noted in paragraph 2 , [LOC Brazil  ] often aligns itself with other developing countries . 
There is a lingering view among many [MISC Brazilian  ] elites that [LOC Brazil  ] gave up its nuclear option too easily , a view seemingly justified by the supposedly advantageous deal [LOC India  ] received . 
This has fostered something of an inferiority complex among [MISC Brazilians  ] strengthening the view that [ORG NWS  ] disarmament has been inadequate and should be the highest NPT priority . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will align with NPT members taking this position and will be less forceful in supporting nonproliferation measures as a result , but will seek consensus on all issues rather than public divisions . 
-- [LOC Brazil  ] sees itself as a leader of developing countries and will try to shape the overall positions of its colleagues . 
As noted above , the [MISC Brazilian  ] priority for the revcon is to reach consensus and avoid dissunity that would undermine the overall effectiveness of the [ORG Treaty  ] regime . 
-- [MISC Brazilian  ] representatives will receive detailed guidance from [LOC Brasilia  ] and will have little flexibility without consulting the capital .
