End summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Deputy Prime Minister-equivalent Dr. [PER Abdulhafid Zlitni  ] hosted the first [ORG National Conference  ] on [ORG Management Development  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] October 29 . 
Experts from [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Austria  ] , [LOC Tunisia  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Libya  ] took part in the event , along with the [ORG Arab Organization for Management Development  ] and the [ORG Egyptian Central Authority  ] for [ORG Management Organization  ] . 
3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) During the first session of the conference , Dr. [PER Abubakr Bayyra  ] , a professor at [LOC Benghazi  ] 's [ORG Garyounis University  ] , presented a paper that touched on management training , modern international indicators and the way forward for the development of [MISC Libyan  ] management skills . 
His recommendations focused on the need for accountability , rule of law , transparency and the will to fight corruption . 
The paper also offered a strategy to enhance [LOC Libya  ] 's anti-corruption efforts , focusing on the civil service and reforming the laws and policies that underpin the government system . 
4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to a quasi-independent [MISC Libyan  ] website ( [MISC Libya-AlYoum  ] ) , long-time Minister of Labor-equivalent [PER Matuq Matuq  ] rose and objected vehemently to the use of international indicators to assess [MISC Libya'  ] record of management reform and anti-corruption efforts . 
He specifically rejected the findings of [ORG Transparency International  ] as " unrealistic and unreal " . 
( Note: In its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index , [ORG Transparency International  ] ranked [LOC Libya  ] 131st in the world , placing it on par with [LOC Iran  ] and slightly better than [LOC Syria  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Matuq  ] insisted that the [ORG Transparency International  ] report be ignored and called for a special transparency report on [LOC Libya  ] written by [MISC Libyans  ] , whom he said alone possess the requisite perspective to comment on the local environment . 
He closed by stating that " no consideration should be given to issues such as corruption and good management , because they are irrelevant and unimportant to [LOC Libya  ] " . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Matuq  ] 's outburst reportedly shocked the conference attendees and prompted speculation as to whether his comments represent GOL policy or only his own views . 
The highest echelons of GOL leadership , including [PER Moammar al-Qadhafi  ] ( reftel ) and his oldest son , [PER Seif al-Islam  ] , have frequently spoken publicly about the need to address corruption , albeit with little follow-up action . 
The exception in terms of follow-up has been the use of corruption charges to punish wealthy insiders who have fallen out of favor with the regime , a practice referred to locally as " the black hand " . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] public has viewed calls for anti-corruption efforts with skepticism , in part because the [PER Qadhafi  ] family and its fellow travelers are among the biggest beneficiaries of graft . 
Nonetheless , [PER Matuq  ] 's intervention at the conference and his stature as a long-time crony of the Leader suggest that at least some of [LOC Libya  ] 's " old guard " feel threatened by the reformist camp and may seek to blunt any anti-corruption efforts .
