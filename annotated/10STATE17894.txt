<code><pre>S E C R E T STATE 017894 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 02/25/2020 TAGS PREL , PGOV , PTER , MASS , IS , LE , SY SUBJECT: DEMARCHE: CONTINUED CONCERN OVER [MISC SYRIAN  ] SUPPORT TO [ORG HIZBALLAH  ] REF: A ) 2009 STATE 129636 Classified By: [ORG NEA A/S  ] [PER Jeffrey D. Feltman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph four . 
Summary ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) We previously demarched [LOC Britain  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] on our increasing concerns over Syria’s continued provision of advanced weapons to [ORG Hizballah  ] ( [MISC Ref A  ] ) . 
In [LOC London  ] , [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Ankara  ] the demarches were taken seriously and all governments pledged to raise their concern with [MISC Syrian  ] officials . 
[MISC French  ] diplomats noted that they routinely deliver the same message to the [MISC Syrians  ] , but that [LOC Damascus  ] denies involvement . 
This issue now needs to be reinforced with these governments and brought to the attention of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , and [LOC Qatar  ] . 
Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] visited [LOC Damascus  ] on February 17 and stressed [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about weapons transfers to [ORG Hizballah  ] directly with [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar Asad  ] , who bluntly stated that he knew of no new weapons systems going to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
In light of disturbing and weighty evidence to the contrary -- that [LOC Syria  ] currently provides [ORG Hizballah  ] with advanced ballistic missiles and other weaponry -- we want [LOC France  ] , [LOC Britain  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , and [LOC Qatar  ] to make a renewed push to echo our concerns with [LOC Syria  ] , given that [LOC Syria  ] continues to ignore warnings that its transfers of advanced surface-to-surface and surface-to-air weapons to [ORG Hizballah  ] could jeopardize prospects for an agreement with [LOC Israel  ] or spark a conflict significantly more destructive than the 2006 [MISC Israel-Hizballah  ] war . 
Syria’s actions clearly jeopardize regional stability and could risk drawing [LOC Damascus  ] into any future war between [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Hizballah.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The [MISC Syrian  ] leadership views military support to [ORG Hizballah  ] as integral to Syria’s security and as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with [LOC Israel  ] over the return of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] , as well as a possible stick to bring the [MISC Israelis  ] back to the table . 
While our commitment to principled engagement with [LOC Syria  ] -- as demonstrated by Under Secretary [PER Burns’  ] recent visit -- remains strong , we must enlist additional [MISC French  ] , [MISC British  ] , [MISC Turkish  ] , [MISC Saudi  ] , [MISC Jordanian  ] , and [MISC Qatari  ] support to help dissuade [LOC Syria  ] from expanding its ties to [ORG Hizballah  ] any further , especially via the transfer of additional sophisticated weaponry . 
Objectives ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/REL FRANCE  ] , [LOC BRITAIN  ] , [LOC TURKEY  ] , [LOC SAUDI ARABIA  ] , [LOC JORDAN  ] , AND [LOC QATAR  ] ) Drawing on paragraphs 2 and 3 for context , we request that Embassies in [LOC Paris  ] , [LOC London  ] , [LOC Ankara  ] , [LOC Riyadh  ] , [LOC Amman  ] , and [LOC Doha  ] pursue the following objectives with senior [MISC French  ] , [MISC British  ] , [MISC Turkish  ] , [MISC Saudi  ] , [MISC Jordanian  ] , and [MISC Qatari  ] officials at the highest appropriate levels . 
-- Highlight that Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] visited [LOC Damascus  ] on February 17 as part of our ongoing engagement with [LOC Syria  ] . 
Reiterate our commitment to sustained , principled engagement with [LOC Syria  ] . 
We plan to continue our dialogue with [LOC Syria  ] and look forward to the arrival of our new ambassador in [LOC Damascus  ] once the confirmation process is complete . 
-- Stress that in addition to discussing bilateral issues of mutual interest , Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] conveyed to President [PER Asad  ] a number of our priority concerns with [LOC Syria  ] , specifically cross-border weapons smuggling into [LOC Lebanon  ] destined for [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
-- Note that in response , [PER Asad  ] claimed that [LOC Syria  ] could not be [MISC Israel’s  ] policeman and that he knew of no new weapons systems being smuggled from [LOC Syria  ] to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
-- Underscore that , contrary to President [PER Asad’s  ] statements , we are aware of current [MISC Syrian  ] efforts to supply ballistic missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
-- We also note President Asad’s recent comments -- during a February 25 joint press conference with his [MISC Iranian  ] counterpart -- that support for [ORG Hizballah  ] was a “moral and legal duty.” -- Express deep concern that Syria’s expanding military ties to [ORG Hizballah  ] , including the supply of ballistic missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] , jeopardize regional prospects for peace and stability . 
Specifically , [MISC Syrian  ] transfers of increasingly sophisticated weaponry risk renewed conflict between [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] that may expand , unlike in 2006 , into [LOC Syria  ] . 
-- Convey that arms shipments to [ORG Hizballah  ] -- especially ballistic missiles -- increasingly undermine [MISC Israel’s  ] confidence in Syria’s willingness and ability to deliver peace and diminish the value of an eventual [MISC Syrian-Israeli  ] accord , as [ORG Hizballah  ] will not return the weapons it has already received . 
-- Underscore that the next report on [ORG Security Council  ] resolution 1701 will be discussed on March 12 . 
Full implementation of [ORG Security Council  ] resolution 1701 , including the arms embargo and weapons-free zone , remains a priority for the [LOC United States  ] . 
In light of the upcoming report , it is especially important to stress that Syria’s actions constitute serious violations of [ORG Security Council  ] resolution 1701 -- which will be taken seriously by the international community -- and belie its claims to respect Lebanon’s sovereignty . 
-- Express our appreciation for your host government’s support on the critical issue of [MISC Syrian  ] weapons transfers to [ORG Hizballah  ] and note that we hope to continue our cooperation to prevent serious miscalculations by the [MISC Syrian  ] government . 
-- Share the following [PER S/REL FRANCE  ] , [LOC BRITAIN  ] , [LOC TURKEY  ] , [LOC SAUDI ARABIA  ] , [LOC JORDAN  ] , [LOC QATAR  ] text verbatim: ( [PER Begin  ] releasable text . 
) We would like to convey to you that we have information indicating that [LOC Syria  ] is providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to [ORG Hizballah  ] , including from its own military stocks . 
For example , we assess that [LOC Syria  ] has provided or will provided guided short range ballistic missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] that could target two-thirds of [LOC Israel  ] , including [LOC Tel Aviv  ] , from launch sites north of the [LOC Litani  ] . 
Our information also indicates that [LOC Syria  ] has made advanced surface to air missile systems available to [ORG Hizballah  ] and has probably provided training on these systems to [ORG Hizballah  ] personnel . 
( End releasable text . 
) -- Urge [LOC France  ] , [LOC Britain  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , and [LOC Qatar  ] to raise these concerns once again in their dialogue with senior [MISC Syrian  ] officials . 
We do not want to undermine our collective outreach to [LOC Syria  ] . 
However , we are increasingly concerned that the [MISC Syrian  ] government is making a strategic miscalculation by incorrectly assuming that increasing [MISC Hizballah’s  ] military capability concomitantly bolsters Syria’s security and strength at the negotiating table with [LOC Israel  ] , when the opposite is more likely to be true . 
-- Syria’s desire for a deterrent against [MISC Israeli  ] military action -- presumably a motivation for the transfer of ballistic missiles to [ORG Hizballah  ] -- is not producing a stable deterrent because there are no mechanisms to prevent unanticipated escalation . 
Not having control over [MISC Hizballah’s  ] missiles increases the risk of this danger . 
-- Emphasize that Syria’s actions risk derailing our common efforts to bring peace to the region . 
-- Note that we are raising our concerns with [MISC Syrian  ] officials in [LOC Damascus  ] and with the [MISC Syrian  ] Ambassador here in [LOC Washington  ] . 
-- Also note our continuing strong commitment and support to the full implementation of resolutions 1747 and 1701 , encouraging [LOC France  ] , [LOC Britain  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] to stress their continuing support for the full implementation of resolution 1701 -- in its entirety ( including the arms embargo and weapons free zone ) -- with senior [MISC Syrian  ] officials . 
-- These are [LOC U.S.  ] concerns . 
We are not carrying somebody else’s “water” on this issue. -- ( For [LOC Turkey  ] ) Express that we greatly appreciate Turkey’s continued efforts to combat weapons smuggling . 
As conveyed by Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] when he was in [LOC Ankara  ] on February 18 , we urge [LOC Turkey  ] to use its close ties with [LOC Damascus  ] to underscore the repercussions that Syria’s continued provision of weapons to [ORG Hizballah  ] has for regional stability and the broader goal of [LOC Middle East  ] peace . 
We hope that [LOC Turkey  ] will leverage its influence with [LOC Syria  ] on this crucial issue . 
Reporting Deadline ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassies are requested to report the results of this demarche to [LOC Syria  ] desk officer [PER Andrew Abell  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] desk officer [PER John Duchak  ] by March 3 , 2010 .
