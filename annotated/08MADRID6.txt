( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: I warmly welcome Senator and Mrs. [PER Lieberman  ] to [LOC Madrid  ] . 
When you arrive , [LOC Spain  ] will be emerging from the Holidays and starting to focus on what is likely to be a very competitive March 9 general election . 
Although the media here prefers to focus on differences in the [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relationship resulting from [LOC Spain  ] 's 2004 withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] , cooperation is excellent in areas of common interests - fighting terrorism and organized crime , strengthening [ORG NATO  ] and the [MISC Transatlantic  ] security relationship , and in promoting the spread of democracy in many areas of the world . 
As the [MISC Hispanic  ] population of the [LOC United States  ] continues to grow , and as [MISC Spanish  ] increasingly becomes our second national language , [LOC Spain  ] has the potential to be an even closer [LOC U.S.  ] partner . 
End summary . 
Counter-Terrorism and [ORG Law Enforcement  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations were seriously damaged by President Zapateros 's decision soon after his reelection in 2004 to precipitously withdraw [MISC Spanish  ] forces from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
However , over the last several years both countries have made a concerted and successful effort to rebuild the relationship based on strong mutual interests in counter-terrorism , fighting narcotics trafficking and organized crime , and rapidly expanding economic ties . 
The real bilateral story is found in novel initiatives such as the [MISC HSPD-6  ] agreement we signed in September to facilitate the sharing of information between our national counter-terrorism authorities . 
[LOC Spain  ] is home to a large and growing [MISC Muslim  ] population . 
The March 11 , 2004 , train bombings were a shock to [LOC Spain  ] ( 21 of the suspects were convicted here in October ) . 
[LOC Spain  ] remains a target of [MISC Islamic  ] extremists ; al-Qaeda has called for attacks to recapture the medieval " [PER Al Andalus  ] " . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] are actively pursuing [MISC Islamic  ] extremist terrorism-related investigations and have scores of suspects in jail . 
Neither has the threat of [ORG ETA  ] terror gone away: two [MISC Spanish  ] Civil Guard officers were murdered in [LOC France  ] in early December by the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Narcotics trafficking is another area of common concern . 
[MISC Andean  ] cocaine is a serious problem here , and [MISC Colombian  ] trafficking organizations are active in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Money laundering is another serious issue . 
We are eager to find ways to increase bilateral cooperation and to encourage [LOC Spain  ] to engage more aggressively with law enforcement authorities in key [MISC Latin American  ] countries . 
Security and [ORG Diplomatic Cooperation  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] military cooperation matters . 
The bases of [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] are strategic hubs , midway between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] planes and ships account for around 5,000 flights and 250 port calls a year in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] military is pro-U.S. and pro-NATO . 
The navy employs the [MISC AEGIS  ] system in its frigates and has been working for five years to acquire the [MISC Tomahawk  ] missile system . 
[LOC Spain  ] is also interested in the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] . 
We need to keep this military-to-military relationship strong. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] has 750 troops with [ORG ISAF  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and a provincial reconstruction team in [LOC Badghis  ] province . 
They have contributed some 150 million [MISC Euros  ] in [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction funds . 
Planning is underway to allow the [MISC Spanish  ] to train and equip an [MISC Afghan  ] Army company , which we hope will be a prelude to the training and equipping of a full battalion . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Spain  ] has contributed $22 million to the [ORG Basrah Children  ] 's Hospital and a further $28 million in development funding for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] has nearly 1,100 troops with [ORG UNIFIL  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] and about 700 in [LOC Kosovo.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the diplomatic front , [LOC Spain  ] in recent years has more often been a follower than a leader , looking to stay within [ORG EU  ] consensus on issues such as [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and missile defense . 
It is more forward-leaning on the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , undoubtedly driven by FM Moratinos' long personal involvement in the issue . 
Moratinos was an eager participant in the [ORG Annapolis Conference  ] and helped ensure [LOC Spain  ] made a robust pledge of support for the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] during the recent [LOC Paris  ] donors' conference . 
Driven by the twin threats of terrorism and illegal immigration , [LOC Spain  ] is also increasing its engagement with the countries of [LOC North  ] and [LOC Western Africa.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is second only to the [LOC U.S.  ] in terms of economic and political influence in [MISC Latin America  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] MADRID 00000006 002.2 OF 004 wants strong democratic and free market institutions in the region . 
Nevertheless , we have sharp differences over [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's socialist government has opted for engagement , claiming it can encourage regime elements who want change . 
We take every opportunity to remind the [MISC Spanish  ] that the [MISC Cuban  ] regime is only interested in survival and that the [MISC Cuban  ] dissidents need and deserve the active and visible support of democracies everywhere . 
On [LOC Venezuela  ] , the socialists' early efforts at constructive engagement with [PER Chavez  ] have gone sour . 
At the most recent [ORG Iberoamerican Summit  ] , King [PER Juan Carlos  ] publicly interrupted a [PER Chavez  ] tirade about former [MISC Spanish  ] President [MISC Aznar  ] , telling the [MISC Venezuelan  ] President to " shut up . 
" The government is uncomfortably situated between [MISC Spanish  ] companies who fear [PER Chavez  ] will move against their [LOC Venezuela  ] interests and the strong public support for the King . 
Economy ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] has one of the fastest growing economies in [LOC Europe  ] . 
In fact , the economy has grown in each of the last 15 years , and per capita GDP passed [LOC Italy  ] 's in 2006 . 
In the last several years , a housing boom has contributed greatly to growth , but as elections approach , housing prices are stagnating , construction is slowing , and unemployment and inflation are staring to creep up . 
[LOC U.S.  ] investment has long been important to the economy ( more so than bilateral trade ) , but the tables have turned . 
This year , [LOC Spain  ] has been the fourth largest foreign investor in the [LOC U.S.  ] , with particular emphasis in banking , construction , and renewable energy . 
In the latter sector , [LOC Spain  ] has the world 's largest and third largest wind power firms , and [MISC Spanish  ] firms also are active in [LOC U.S.  ] solar and biofuels projects . 
Elections --------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] will hold a general election March 9 , and the campaign will just be heating up as you arrive . 
The ruling [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) candidate is President [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] . 
Despite a strong economy , a budget surplus , and a variety of social spending initiatives , the early polls indicate a close race . 
Nevertheless , the polls also suggest [MISC Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) candidate [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] has had limited success getting his message out . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] will run on the economy and its social programs . 
The [ORG PP  ] will argue the economy is softening and that the [ORG PSOE  ] has made too many concessions to [MISC Basque  ] and [MISC Catalan  ] regional governments , is weak on [ORG ETA  ] , and soft on illegal immigration . 
Foreign affairs is unlikely to be a key issue , but the [ORG PSOE  ] will remind voters it got [LOC Spain  ] out of [LOC Iraq  ] while the [ORG PP  ] will say [LOC Spain  ] 's international prestige has slipped . 
[ORG Jewish Community in Spain  ] ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Full religious freedom only returned to [LOC Spain  ] in 1978 with the establishment of a democratic constitution . 
In practice , [LOC Spain  ] is still an overwhelmingly [MISC Catholic  ] country , although Protestant and [MISC Islamic  ] believers are increasingly important demographically . 
Estimates of the size of the [MISC Jewish  ] community in [LOC Spain  ] vary from 50,000 to 100,000 faithful , primarily concentrated in urban areas including [ORG Madrid  ] and [LOC Barcelona  ] . 
The [ORG Spanish Federation of Jewish Communities  ] ( [ORG FCJE  ] ) signed an agreement with the [MISC Spanish  ] government in 1992 establishing [MISC Judaism  ] as one of the " deeply rooted faiths " of [LOC Spain  ] . 
Certain local and regional governments , among them [LOC Toledo  ] , [LOC Segovia  ] , and [LOC Sevilla  ] , have sought to capitalize on [MISC Jewish  ] tourism by publicizing the romantic aspects of the [MISC Sephardic  ] community in pre-Inquisition [LOC Spain  ] while downplaying the expulsion . 
Nevertheless , anti-Semitism remains an undercurrent in [LOC Spain  ] ; swastikas and other graffiti appear periodically on buildings and in neighborhoods associated with [MISC Judaism  ] or the pre-expulsion [MISC Sephardic  ] presence . 
[MISC Neo-Nazi  ] propagandists and ultra-rightists remain present in [LOC Spain  ] , most significantly along the [MISC Mediterranean  ] coast in [LOC Valencia  ] and [LOC Barcelona  ] , but also in all major cities . 
In [LOC Madrid  ] , skinheads , Falangists and [MISC Franco  ] supporters make their presence known through infrequent demonstrations and marches , as well as by harassing the growing immigrant population. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] is currently engaging with the [ORG GOS  ] over the 2007 exhumation of three pre-expulsion [MISC Sephardic  ] cemeteries in [LOC Andalucia  ] and [LOC Catalunya  ] . 
In each case the cemeteries were [LOC MADRID  ] 00000006 003.2 OF 004 uncovered by accident during excavation for construction or road projects , and in each instance the local authorities did not handle the graves in keeping with strict [MISC Jewish  ] dictates , more likely out of ignorance than malice . 
Based on interest from concerned [MISC Americans  ] , among them Representative [PER Edolphus Towns  ] , Chairman [PER Warren Miller  ] of the [ORG U.S. Commission  ] for the [ORG Preservation of America 's Heritage Abroad  ] , and Rabbi [PER David Niederman  ] of the [ORG United Jewish Organization  ] , I , my DCM and our Consul General in [LOC Barcelona  ] have expressed our concern to the [MISC Spanish  ] government that these culturally and religiously sensitive sites need to be protected and handled in a manner in keeping with the wishes of the [MISC Jewish  ] community in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Because each municipal government has jurisdiction in affairs dealing with cemeteries , the government has sought to place the responsibility on each local jurisdiction . 
The [ORG FCJE  ] and local [MISC Jewish  ] organizations have lobbied the national and local governments to enact a national protocol for addressing any future excavations and are hoping to secure funding to research the location and condition of other cemeteries that have been lost for centuries . 
The exhumed remains have since been re-interred in other [MISC Jewish  ] cemeteries with religious authorities present. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Critics have accused the [MISC Spanish  ] government of taking anti-Israel stances with respect to both the [LOC Middle East Peace Process  ] and the 2006 [MISC Israel-Lebanon  ] conflict , while the government has strongly refuted allegations of anti-Semitism and [LOC Israel  ] bashing . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] is a frequent visitor to the region , and he made a controversial visit to [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Beirut  ] in 2007 in which he was photographed with the number two of [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
Nevertheless , he claims to enjoy a good relationship with [MISC Israeli  ] FM [PER Livni  ] and is planning a fence-mending trip to [LOC Israel  ] in the coming months . 
[ORG Pisarro Painting Claim  ] ---------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During your conversation with Ambassador [PER Ana Salomon  ] , you may wish to mention the claim of [PER Claude Cassirer  ] , an elderly [MISC American  ] citizen , for a [PER Camille Pissarro  ] painting ( " Rue [LOC Saint Honore  ] " ) now at the [ORG Thyssen Bornemisza Museum  ] in [LOC Madrid  ] , [LOC Spain  ] 's appeal of a [LOC U.S.  ] district court ruling that [LOC U.S.  ] courts have jurisdiction is now before the 9th Circuit . 
The [MISC Nazis  ] forced Mr. [PER Cassirer  ] 's grandmother to sell the painting in 1939 . 
[PER Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza  ] acquired it in 1976 . 
In the early 1990 's , the [MISC Spanish  ] Government purchased the collection and built the current museum . 
In 1958 , Mrs. [PER Cassirer  ] received a DM 120,000 restitution payment for the disappearance and provisional dispossession of the painting , but retained full right to the painting . 
Were Mr. [PER Cassirer  ] to win his claim , he would be obliged to reimburse this amount to the [MISC German  ] authorities . 
Pursuant to the 1998 [ORG Washington Conference Principles  ] on [MISC Nazi Confiscated Art  ] , [PER Cassirer  ] 's attorneys offered to discuss the claim with the Government of [LOC Spain  ] in 2002 but the government refused . 
[LOC Spain  ] also refused to engage in a mediation process that was part of the district court proceedings . 
The [ORG Washington Conference  ] accepted the Principles by consensus , in which the [MISC Spanish  ] representative joined . 
Dealers , claimants and holders of artworks generally heed the principles . 
[LOC Spain  ] correctly points out that the principles provide for states to " act within the context of their own laws " , and notes that claimant has not filed a claim in [LOC Spain  ] . 
But the Principles also call on parties to achieve just and fair solutions on an expeditious basis and to develop and use alternative dispute resolution mechanisms . 
In December 2007 , Ambassador [PER Salomon  ] told Ambassador [PER J. Christian Kennedy  ] , the Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues , that the new [MISC Spanish  ] Minister of Culture might take a more constructive view of this claim . 
In June 2005 , the then Special Envoy raised the issue in [LOC Madrid  ] with museum and government officials , to no avail . 
Earlier correspondence between the Envoy and the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador in [LOC Washington  ] was also without result . 
We recommend you urge Ambassador [PER Salomon  ] and others as appropriate to engage with [PER Cassirer  ] to find a mutually acceptable solution . 
Conclusion ---------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Again , I am looking forward to your visit . 
While we want to avoid being an issue in the [MISC Spanish  ] elections , we do need to remind [LOC Spain  ] that the bilateral relationship is founded on strong mutual interests such as counter-terrorism and law enforcement . 
Regardless of who wins in March , terrorists , drug traffickers , and alien smugglers will [LOC MADRID  ] 00000006 004.2 OF 004 continue to see both our countries as targets . 
We have much work to do together . 
AGUIRRE</pre></code>
