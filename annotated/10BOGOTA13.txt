( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Colombian  ] High Commissioner for Peace [PER Frank Pearl  ] told the Ambassador January 5 that his office is preparing " roadmaps " for the next [PER Administration  ] on how best to pursue peace agreements with the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) and [ORG National Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG ELN  ] ) . 
[PER Pearl  ] acknowledged that the [ORG GOC  ] had communicated with both groups in order to develop the road maps and build confidence . 
Both groups have expressed minimum conditions for a peace process that is supported by the [ORG GOC  ] , the military , the private sector , and the international community . 
In the short term , [PER Pearl  ] plans to focus on the humanitarian release of [ORG FARC  ] hostages and a secret meeting between the [ORG GOC  ] and [ORG ELN  ] with an aim to revitalizing the stalled peace talks . 
Wild cards include President [PER Uribe  ] 's possible reelection , support from [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] , and the [ORG FARC  ] 's acquisition of " game-changing " weaponry such as man-portable air defense systems ( [ORG MANPADS  ] ) .

Roadmaps for Peace ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At a breakfast hosted by the Ambassador on January 5 , Peace Commissioner [PER Frank Pearl  ] disclosed that when he took office in February last year , he assessed that there was not enough time left in the [ORG Uribe Administration  ] ( which ends August 7 , 2010 ) for either the [ORG FARC  ] or [ORG ELN  ] to conclude a peace agreement with the [ORG GOC  ] . 
He said his office had instead been focused on developing communication channels and building confidence with both terrorist organizations . 
Responses from these contacts , he continued , had informed the development of " roadmaps " that define both a desired end-state and the process to get there . 
The [ORG International Organization for Migration  ] ( [ORG IOM  ] ) , supported by [ORG USAID  ] , was drafting many of the documents . 
[PER Pearl  ] planned to present these fleshed out plans to the president-elect ( or to President [PER Uribe  ] if he is reelected ) in June to help guide the next [ORG Administration.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) From the [ORG FARC  ] , [PER Pearl  ] had seen little interest in initiating peace talks . 
[ORG FARC  ] Supreme Leader [PER Alfonso Cano  ] was still consolidating his authority and proving his mettle as a military commander . 
It would have been impossible for [PER Cano  ] , he surmised , to have broached peace talks so soon after taking the reins of the [ORG FARC  ] in May 2008 . 
Still , [PER Pearl  ] noted that the deaths of three [MISC Secretariat  ] members in 2008 had resulted in replacements that were more educated , intellectual , and aware of the international context of the conflict . 
This , coupled with an analysis of recent [ORG FARC  ] communiques , suggested that the organization was open to a political solution to the conflict . 
He said other sources had signaled that the [ORG FARC  ] 's preferred end-state is the transition to a series of social networks ( presumably comprised of demobilized fronts ) that interface with a political party . 
[PER Pearl  ] admitted that such a solution was years away , but that having a notion of the other side 's goals and objectives at the outset was important. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the short term , [PER Pearl  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] would continue to pursue the humanitarian release of two military hostages and the remains of a third held by the [ORG FARC  ] . 
He said [ORG FARC  ] interlocutor [PER Piedad Cordoba  ] told him December 24 that release was imminent but on December 29 reported that the [ORG FARC  ] had rejected a facilitation role by [LOC Brazil  ] and had counter-offered with [LOC Argentina  ] or [LOC Sweden  ] . 
The Ambassador counseled that the [ORG GOC  ] cultivate the [ORG International Commission  ] of the [ORG Red Cross  ] ( [ORG ICRC  ] ) and the Catholic Church as interlocutors for the humanitarian release rather than depend solely on the Chavez-linked Senator [PER Cordoba.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pearl  ] contrasted the [ORG FARC  ] 's situation with that of the [ORG ELN  ] , which had developed a comprehensive basic framework agreement during talks that stalled in early 2008 . 
He said the [ORG ELN  ] 's [ORG Central Command  ] ( [ORG COCE  ] ) had indicated interest in reviving those talks under appropriate conditions ( ref ) . 
[PER Pearl  ] commented that the [ORG ELN  ] process had been facilitated initially by [MISC Cuban  ] government officials expert in peace talks , resulting in a substantive but incomplete peace proposal . 
The Commissioner confided that he had offered the [ORG COCE  ] a secret , one- or two-day meeting as a confidence-building exercise . 
He said the [ORG COCE  ] is considering the offer but is stuck on the meeting location: [LOC Colombia  ] ( difficult for the [ORG ELN  ] ) , [LOC Venezuela  ] ( difficult for the [ORG GOC  ] ) , or [LOC Norway  ] ( a logistical nightmare but still a possibility ) . 
If successful , [PER Pearl  ] contemplated having two or three such meetings before the end of the current [PER Uribe Administration  ] . 
The Ambassador reminded [PER Pearl  ] that the Embassy had contracted a [MISC U.S.-based  ] academic familiar with the process to consult on ways for the USG to be supportive of [ORG GOC  ] efforts with the [ORG ELN  ] . 
[PER Pearl  ] was grateful for [ORG USAID  ] assistance in drafting white papers that outlined the [ORG ELN  ] negotiating positions . 
[ORG Common Ground  ] ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pearl  ] said that both guerrilla groups had responded through sensitive channels with the same four minimum conditions for a peace agreement . 
First , the [ORG GOC  ] must be willing to give its unambiguous and unanimous support for the agreement . 
Signing a peace agreement , [PER Pearl  ] emphasized , was just the beginning of the process and the terrorist groups have , because of historical precedent , a deep distrust of the [ORG GOC  ] 's good faith . 
Second , the military must be included in the process , a reminder that the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Army  ] opposed and worked against civilian-led peace talks in the 1980s and 1990s . 
Third , both groups seek participation by the private sector , which they view as the true power behind [MISC Colombian  ] politics . 
Fourth , the [ORG ELN  ] and [ORG FARC  ] want some form of international accompaniment for the process . 
[PER Pearl  ] foresees a positive role for the international community once the process has reached a sufficient level of maturity . 
International well-wishers coming in too early , he stressed , could aggravate the delicate process . 
Regarding a [LOC U.S.  ] role , he said that both groups were interested in an agreement with the [LOC United States  ] over illegal drug cultivation , which they viewed as a social problem . 
Wild Cards: Reelection and [LOC Venezuela  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pearl  ] said there were two schools of thought about the impact of an [PER Uribe  ] third term on negotiations . 
Some believed that the third term would only exacerbate the tensions between [PER Uribe  ] and [PER Chavez  ] , which could play to the [ORG FARC  ] 's advantage . 
Others thought that the reelection would cause the [ORG FARC  ] to despair at four more years of [PER Uribe  ] 's [LOC Democratic Security  ] policy and to consider negotiations . 
Ambassador [PER Brownfield  ] added that [LOC Venezuela  ] 's political and material support to the [ORG FARC  ] could be a game-changer , especially if [LOC Venezuela  ] were to give the [ORG FARC  ] portable surface-to-air missiles ( [ORG MANPADS  ] ) . 
[PER Pearl  ] agreed that such weapons could upset the strategic balance of the conflict . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pearl  ] 's presentation was structured , logical , and rehearsed . 
He clearly wanted to control our expectations over what could be accomplished in the short run . 
That said , it is a realistic plan given that [MISC Colombians  ] will be seized with choosing ( or reelecting ) a president for much of 2010 . 
We should continue our support of the [ORG GOC  ] as it develops these initiatives , being careful not to get too far out in front . 
End comment .
