The [ORG MFA  ] has suggested draft language ( paragraph 5 ) . 
END SUMMARY . 
THE [ORG FOL AGREEMENT  ] ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [ORG FOL Agreement  ] was concluded on March 2 , 2000 to facilitate access to and use of selected airfields in the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] by authorized [LOC United States  ] armed forces and civilian personnel for counter-narcotics activities . 
This bilateral agreement allows the [ORG USG  ] access to and use of the [ORG Hato International Airport  ] in the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and the [ORG Reina Beatrix International Airport  ] in [LOC Aruba  ] as well as authorized ports and related facilities , solely in connection with aerial counter-narcotics detection and monitoring , and as appropriate , interdiction missions in the neighboring region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Recently , [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] has publicly asserted the [LOC U.S.  ] with the support of the [MISC Dutch  ] is using the [LOC Antillian/Aruba  ] airfields to support military operations in [LOC Venezuela  ] and the region in order to overthrow him . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have strongly denied [PER Chavez  ] , s assertions and protested to the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Government . 
Still , members of parliament are now questioning [LOC U.S.  ] use of the airfields under the [ORG FOL Agreement  ] . 
LETTER OF CONFIRMATION ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The [MISC Dutch  ] government strongly supports the counter-narcotic efforts and understands that all operations are conducted according to the agreement . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG MFA  ] has requested a letter from the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador stating the airfields are only being used as authorized in the [ORG FOL Agreement  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] does not intend to release the letter to the press , but only to quote from it in response to questions posed by parliament . 
The [ORG MFA  ] has suggested a letter along the following lines: [PER Begin  ] text: At the request of the [ORG Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , I can confirm that the [LOC United States  ] abides by the purposes and provisions of the [ORG FOL Agreement  ] of March 2 , <a id='par2000' href='#par2000'>¶</a>2000 . 
The facilities are used solely in connection with unarmed aerial counter-narcotics reconnaissance flights . 
End Text. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) COMMENT . 
Without a doubt , the contents from such a letter will find their way to the press . 
Still , it is to our benefit to assist the [MISC Dutch  ] Government to state explicitly that confirmation of compliance with the [ORG FOL Agreement  ] has been received from the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG MFA  ] would like to receive a letter by Jan. 12 in order to use it in response to existing parliamentary questions . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests [LOC Washington  ] authorize the Ambassador to sign a letter , with [LOC Washington  ] approved text , QAmbassador to sign a letter , with [LOC Washington  ] approved text , as the [ORG MFA  ] has requested .
