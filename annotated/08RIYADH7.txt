( S ) The Ambassador delivered the demarche contained in reftel regarding [PER Benazir  ] Bhutto’s assassination to [MISC Saudi  ] Foreign Minister [PER Prince Saud  ] al-Faisal on January 2 . 
Responding to the demarche , [PER Prince Saud  ] characterized [MISC Pakistan’s  ] current internal situation as “serious and tense , ” and described the current political environment there as “poisonous.” He emphasized the need to maintain stability , noting that the key challenge for President [PER Musharraf  ] is to maintain the unity of the [MISC Pakistani  ] armed forces . 
He voiced strong support for holding planned parliamentary elections , but also said that a limited postponement would be acceptable , given the current situation in the country . 
Postponing the elections could be “an opportunity for the [MISC Pakistanis  ] to talk things out , ” he said . 
[PER Prince Saud  ] cautioned that [LOC Pakistan  ] must be allowed to resolve its current political crisis internally , without overt , external pressure. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Commenting on the [PER Bhutto  ] assasination , [PER Prince Saud  ] observed that he had been afraid of just such an outcome ever since the former Prime Minister had decided to return to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He then cautioned that the USG must not be seen publicly to be influencing [MISC Pakistan’s  ] internal affairs , lest it inadvertently inflame matters by provoking [MISC Islamist  ] extremists to further violence. “People talk about the extremists we have here , but I think they are much worse in [LOC Pakistan  ] , ” he commented. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The Foreign Minister stated that former Prime Minister [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is a force for stability , in his opinion . 
He called [PER Sharif  ] a leader who can speak across party lines , even to religious extremists who are not usually open to dialogue . 
In Prince Saud’s view , [PER Sharif  ] can play an important role in stabiizing [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) These views stand in marked contrast to those of [MISC Saudi  ] Ambassador to the [LOC US  ] [PER Adel al-Jubeir  ] . 
In a December 31 conversation with the [ORG DCM  ] , al-Jubeir was highly critical of [PER Sharif  ] , stating in particular that [PER Sharif  ] had violated a promise made to King [PER Abdullah  ] by publicly calling for President [PER Musharraf  ] to step down . 
Accrding to al-Jubeir , prior to his return to [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Sharif  ] had promised the King to avoid questioning [MISC Musharraf’s  ] recent political decisions in public . 
Jubeir also compared [MISC Pakistan’s  ] current situation to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in 2003 , when the [LOC Kingdom  ] witnessed a violent campaign by terrorists linked to a-Qaeda . 
He explained that the SAG was able to push back and eventually quell this extremism , in large part by convincing the [ORG Kingdom’s  ] religious scholars to condemn terrorism strongly . 
Jubeir expresed the hope that a similar outcome is possible in [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) COMMENT . 
The contrast between the views of the Foreign Minister and Ambassador al-Jubeir are worth noting , since they probably indicate that the senior levels of the [MISC Saudi  ] government are still debating what the [MISC Kingdom’s  ] [LOC Pakistan  ] policy should be in the aftermath of the [PER Bhutto  ] asassination . 
It is likely that al-Jubeir’s views more closely reflect those of King [PER Abdullah  ] , his patron . 
END COMMENT .
