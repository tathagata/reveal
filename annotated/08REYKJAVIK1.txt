( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: [MISC Icelandic  ] President [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] announced in his televised [MISC New Year 's Day  ] Address that he will run for a fourth term as President of [LOC Iceland  ] in the presidential election on June 28 . 
By doing so , he has put on hold any aspirations of taking a high-level international office . 
Both politicians and the public have reacted rather positively to the news , and , in the absence of any political controversy involving [PER Grimsson  ] , he is set to win the election this summer . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Olafur Ragnar Grimsson  ] , President of [LOC Iceland  ] and Head of State but not Government , quieted any rumors in his [MISC New Year 's Day  ] address that he would not be running for the fourth term as President in this year 's election . 
If re-elected , [PER Grimsson  ] would be the third President to have served a fourth four-year term , for a total of sixteen years. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Rumors had been flying that [PER Grimsson  ] was either going to run for election again or make a career change . 
There was speculation that [PER Grimsson  ] might take a high-profile international job , for example , with the [ORG United Nations  ] . 
An [MISC English-language  ] biography , that was slated to be published before [MISC Christmas  ] , has been put on hold indefinitely . 
The biography , probably intended to raise [PER Grimsson  ] 's international profile , was widely construed as preparation for a career change. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The chairmen and spokespersons of the five major political parties said that [PER Grimsson  ] 's announcement did not come as a surprise . 
Steingrimur [PER J. Sigfusson  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] , said that he likes the idea of limiting the President 's tenure to two six-year terms . 
The chairmen and spokesmen of the other four parties do not agree with [PER Sigfusson  ] , but [PER Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir  ] , the Deputy Chairman of the [ORG Independence Party  ] , says that perhaps the constitutional role of the President should be revised. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The January 2 editorial in [LOC Morgunbladid  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] 's newspaper-of-record , said that [PER Grimsson  ] is somewhat eager to regain the trust that he lost in the 2004 presidential election . 
Voter turnout in the 2004 election was only 62.9 percent , out of which 20 percent were empty ballots , or protest votes . 
Note: In parliamentary elections the voter turnout ranges between 80 and 90 percent . 
End Note . 
The editorialist added that the 2004 election results should not have come as a surprise because [PER Grimsson  ] had taken steps to politicize the Presidency . 
Since the office has become more controversial under [PER Grimsson  ] , the editorialist said that it begs the question whether term limits should be imposed as is customary in other countries. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: There is no limit on how many times one can run for President in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER Olafur  ] [PER Ragnar Grimsson  ] has been relatively popular across the political spectrum as President and his announcement to run for the fourth time has been generally welcomed . 
An incumbent President has always won a re-election , and therefore it is almost certain that he will win the election on June 28 even if he is challenged . 
If there are no other contenders then he will win automatically . 
In the last election in 2004 more votes than ever before were empty ballots , or protest votes , which was most likely due to [PER Grimsson  ] 's controversial move not to sign a hotly contested law on media ownership . 
Barring any such contentious spectacle , [PER Grimsson  ] 's re-election is a near certainty . 
End Comment .
