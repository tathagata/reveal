<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 022174 SIPDIS SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 11/25/2016 TAGS AF , EFIN , PK , PREL , PTER , KTFN , [ORG UN SUBJECT: TERROR FINANCE: EMBASSY PRESSES  ] [MISC GOP  ] ON [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG COMMITTEE  ] CASES REF: [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 22000 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Ryan C. Crocker  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: As  ] noted in [LOC Ref A  ] , post has raised the ongoing operations of two [ORG UN  ] 1267 Committee-designated entities -- [ORG Al Rashid Trust  ] , [ORG Al Akhtar Trust  ] and [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyba/Jamaat  ] ud-Dawa ( LeT/JuD ) -- with contacts throughout the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] ( [MISC GOP  ] ) . 
While the Ambassador has pressed the issue with the Foreign Secretary and [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , emboffs have engaged the [ORG MFA’s UN Directorate  ] and the [ORG Information Ministry  ] . 
The [MISC GOP  ] has responded by reviewing its procedures to disseminate information on the prohibitions that accompany [ORG UN  ] 1267 designation to ensure that broadcasters and print media are aware that they should decline requests to purchase advertising space . 
No [MISC GOP  ] official , however , has committed to taking direct action to close the operations of these entities . 
In addition to raising the issue with [MISC GOP  ] officials , post has also shared open source reports of these entities fund-raising activities with like-minded missions in the [LOC Islamabad  ] diplomatic community , as well as with the visiting [ORG UNSC Counterterrorism Executive Directorate  ] delegation . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a November 17 meeting , the Ambassador presented Foreign Secretary [PER Riaz Khan  ] with open source material detailing [ORG Al Rashid’s  ] television solicitations for [MISC Zakat  ] donations , a website highlighting federal Minister of [ORG Information Durrani’s  ] participation in an [ORG Al Akhtar Trust Ramadan  ] event , and a press report on the declaration of the [ORG Ministry of Defense Parliamentary  ] Secretary that he was proud to be a member of LeT and that he seeks to extend support to jihadi organizations when they seek his “cooperation.” Each of these reports is disturbing in itself , the Ambassador said , as they seriously damage [ORG Pakistan’s  ] image in the international community . 
These incidents point to a more fundamental question: is the [MISC GOP  ] is committed to implementing the sanctions that follow a [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG Committee  ] designation ? <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) While the Foreign Secretary recognized the detrimental consequences of the news reports of these incidents , he cited [ORG Al Rashid’s  ] pending challenge to the [MISC GOP’s  ] implementation of 1267 sanctions ( freezing accounts , closing offices , etc . 
) as an impediment to more active government intervention . 
The Ambassador emphasized that this series of incidents could lead reasonable observers to conclude that the [MISC GOP  ] is not serious about its [ORG UN  ] 1267 obligations ; he urged the [MISC GOP  ] to take immediate and definitive steps against the designated entities . 
The Ambassador concluded by stating that without strong public action by the [MISC GOP  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] will be forced to formally bring these incidents to the attention of the [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG Committee  ] . 
( Note: In an aside , the Foreign Secretary asked the Ambassador whether the [LOC U.S  ] , has evidence linking JuD to terrorist activity . 
The Ambassador replied affirmatively , noting that the [ORG USG  ] has shared such information with [MISC GOP  ] intelligence agencies . 
The Ambassador also advised the Foreign Secretary that there is a growing concern in the [ORG USG  ] about LeT/JuD support to the insurgency in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A week later , in a November 24 meeting with [ORG National Security Advisor  ] [PER Tariq Aziz  ] , the Ambassador presented the same points , supported by copies of the open source reports . 
( Note: This package of open source material included a [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00022174 002 OF 003 November 20 report of a full page [ORG Al Akhtar  ] advertisement in a [MISC Karachi Urdu-language  ] paper solicit donations of meat for the poor during the coming [MISC Eid-al-Adha  ] holiday . 
End note . 
) The [ORG Ambassador  ] reported that he had also raised the issue with the Foreign Secretary , but was not certain that the gravity of these [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG Committee  ] violations had registered with the [ORG MFA  ] . 
The Ambassador observed that the bilateral relationship would not be helped if the [LOC U.S.  ] is forced to formally notify the [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG Committee  ] of [ORG Pakistan’s  ] lax implementation of its international obligations . 
[PER NSA Aziz  ] agreed that the [MISC GOP  ] wished to avoid a formal referral to the [ORG UN  ] 1267 committee , expressing serious concern over the broadcast and publication of the [ORG Al Akhtar  ] and [ORG Al Rashid  ] zakat solicitations and particular irritation over the remarks by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defense . 
While saying that the [MISC GOP  ] cannot close down the accounts and operations of JuD , as the entity is not yet the subject of a 1267 designation , [PER Aziz  ] agreed that there is no similar impediment to taking firm action against designees [ORG Al Akhtar  ] and [ORG Al Rashid Trusts  ] . 
[PER Aziz  ] promised the Ambassador that he would pursue the matter within the [MISC GOP  ] interagency. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Complementing the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] outreach , Public Affairs Counselor and econoff have raised the issue of 1267 designees’ published and broadcast fund-raising solicitations with the Information Secretary and with the [ORG MFA  ] Spokesperson and Director General ( [ORG UN  ] ) . 
The Information Secretary pleaded ignorance that [ORG UN  ] 1267 sanctions applied to broadcast and print media ; once the matter was brought to his attention by the Embassy , he said that he ordered the [ORG Information Ministry  ] to advise all state-affiliated media outlets that they must not/not to accept advertising or public service solicitations from any of the 1267 designees . 
( Note: According to the [ORG MFA  ] , a similar effort to reach private media outlets is said to be underway by the [ORG Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Tasneem Aslam  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] spokesperson and [ORG UN  ] Director General , reaffirmed the [MISC GOP’s  ] commitment to honoring its [ORG UN  ] obligations , but noted that a way must be found to “rehabilitate” designated entities , as their charitable and humanitarian activities are a vital part of [MISC Pakistani  ] society. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador discussed the recent spate of public reports on 1267 designee solicitations with Ambassador [PER Ruperez  ] , who led the [ORG UNSC Counterterrorism Executive Directorate  ] ( [ORG CTED  ] ) delegation on a November 17-24 mission to assess [ORG Pakistan’s  ] commitment to combat terrorism . 
PolCouns also privately briefed the senior legal advisor on [ORG USG  ] concerns over the continued operation of these entities in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
PolCouns has also shared the open source reports of the 1267-designated entities with like-minded colleagues in the diplomatic community whose [LOC Embassies’  ] also engage the [MISC GOP  ] on terror finance issues. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Post’s  ] efforts have not gone unnoticed: the November 25 edition of the [MISC English-language  ] “The [LOC Pakistan  ] Post” carried a front-page article with the headline “Banned Outfits’ Ads Annoy US.” The article said that the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] has instructed relevant government departments “to create awareness” within the press that media should not accept advertising by organization designated by the [ORG UN  ] . 
The [ORG Pakistan Post  ] says that the [ORG Interior Ministry’s  ] report notes that “our each and every paper is monitored by the [ORG U.S. State Department  ] that ( sic ) has a separate section to monitor [LOC Urdu  ] newspapers.” The [ORG Post  ] article also reviews alleged [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to include JuD in the LeT 1267 designation , a campaign the paper describes as stymied after [LOC China  ] demanded [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00022174 003 OF 003 evidence that JuD is connected to terror finance activities . 
( Note: The [ORG Post’s  ] story coincided with banner headlines describing dozens of new bilateral [MISC Pak-Chinese  ] initiatives announced during [MISC Chinese  ] President [PER Hu’s  ] November 23-26 state visit to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: Emboffs will continue to engage [MISC GOP  ] officials and contacts in the press , financial community , political parties and the diplomatic community to raise awareness and generate multiple points of pressure to demand that the [MISC GOP  ] take firm action to terminate the operations of 1267-designated entities . 
[ORG Post  ] recommends reassessing [MISC GOP  ] progress on this issue in late December , with an eye to formal notification to the [ORG UN  ] 1267 [ORG Committee  ] in early 2007 if the [MISC GOP  ] response is unsatisfactory . 
End comment .
