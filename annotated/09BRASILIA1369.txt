SECSTATE  ] 120006 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 1342 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Counselor [PER Stephen M. Liston  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) a nd ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Below is initial post response to questions posed ref A regarding [LOC Brazil  ] 's involvement in the conflict between [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
Assessments are based on a number of meetings with and public statements by senior officials over the last several weeks , as well as a meeting November 24 between [MISC PolCouns  ] and acting chief of the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [LOC MRE  ] ) [LOC South America  ] II ( [MISC Andean  ] ) Department , Counselor [PER Carla Barroso Carneiro.  ] - - - Strategy ? 
What Strategy ? - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOB  ] does not appear to have a strategy per se for reducing tensions , but is seeking opportunities to engage both countries to encourage dialogue and reduce tensions and instability . 
Citing the lack of troop movements as evidence that neither side was intent on conflict , [PER Carneiro  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] hopes for a gradual easing of tensions , as happened between [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
According to [PER Carneiro  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] stands ready to help as requested , but does not feel the need to be involved if others can mediate more successfully. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although new Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Antonio Patriota  ] told Charge November 18 that the November 26 Amazon leaders summit would provide an opporunity to discuss the conflict , [PER Carneiro  ] said there is no bilateral meeting scheduled between [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Uribe  ] , and [LOC Brazil  ] is making no effort to plan to arrange one . 
We believe it is likely , however , that President [PER Lula  ] and Presidential Foreign Policy [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] will make some effort to organize a meeting on the spot if it appears it would be productive. - - - [LOC South America  ] Should Handle Its Own Problems - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Carneiro  ] also cited the November 27 [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting in [LOC Quito  ] as another possible forum for addressing the conflict , although [MISC Brazilian  ] congressional contacts recently returned from [LOC Bogota  ] told [ORG Consulate Recife  ] that [PER Uribe  ] refused to attend . 
Asked about [LOC Brazil  ] 's view on whether the [ORG UN  ] , [ORG OAS  ] , or [ORG UNASUL  ] would be the preferred forum , [PER Carneiro  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] 's goal is to reduce instability and the [ORG GOB  ] would support efforts in any forum , but that [LOC Brazil  ] 's preference is for " [LOC South America  ] to manage its own problems " via [ORG UNASUL  ] , a consistent refrain of [ORG GOB  ] officials. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Carneiro  ] and other officials maintain that it is not [LOC Brazil  ] 's place to judge between the two sides . 
However , [LOC Brazil  ] has consistently dismissed President [PER Chavez  ] 's talk of war as inconsequential while insisting that [LOC Colombia  ] should provide assurances to the region that it will respect other nations' sovereignty. - - - [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] a Continuing Issue - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Although [PER Patriota  ] deflected responsibility onto [LOC Colombia  ] ( ref B ) , [LOC Brazil  ] continues to express both public and private concern with the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] , despite repeated [LOC U.S.  ] assurances and explanations , the publication of the text , and [PER Lula  ] 's own pronouncement during [PER Uribe  ] 's visit this month that he was satisfied with [PER Uribe  ] 's explanation . 
[ORG GOB  ] concerns have been fanned by public [ORG USG  ] documents that suggest the [LOC United States  ] has regional or extra-regional reasons to use the bases , rather than purely domestic assistance to [LOC Colombia  ] . 
While ackowledging [LOC Colombia  ] 's right to sign the accord and insisting that the issue should not harm [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations , [PER Carneiro  ] noted [LOC Brazil  ] 's continuing annoyance that it was " presented with a fait accompli " rather than being consulted before the document became public. - - - [PER Comment: Lack  ] of [ORG Trust Meets Core Security Concerns  ] - - - [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001369 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] continues to view itself in competition with the [LOC United States  ] in [LOC South America  ] and does not trust [LOC U.S.  ] intentions , in particular with regard to the Amazon , [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts at regional integration , and , more recently , [LOC Brazil  ] 's off-shore oil . 
While acknowledging the sovereign right of countries to conduct relations with the [LOC United States  ] as they see fit , the fact is that [MISC Brazilians  ] view with suspicion any [LOC U.S.  ] presence or activity in [LOC South America  ] ( to include foreign assistance , energy or infrastructure cooperation , [LOC U.S.  ] NGO activities , or [ORG USG  ] law enforcement cooperation , as well as military activities ) . 
At the same time , [LOC Brazil  ] has an almost neurotic need to be and be seen to be the equal of the [LOC United States  ] , and has taken to heart [LOC U.S.  ] messaging regarding [LOC Brazil  ] as the regional leader to which we look to manage problems in [LOC South America.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) It is these two aspects of our relations that , together , have made the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] so problematic for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
On the one hand , the [ORG GOB  ] sees the [LOC U.S.  ] presence as encroachment on its turf , a threat to its leadership and--both directly and , because of the tensions created with [LOC Venezuela  ] , indirectly--to its security . 
On the other hand , it feels betrayed by the [ORG USG  ] 's failure to acknowledge [LOC Brazil  ] 's primacy in the region by consulting in advance on our activities in [LOC South America  ] , and especially those with regional security implications. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's overriding goal in [LOC South America  ] is stability , and it sees the possibility of a war between [LOC Colombia  ] and Venezuela--or any of its other neighbors--as a direct threat to its security . 
The [ORG GOB  ] does not trust either [PER Chavez  ] or [PER Uribe  ] to act wisely , but at present sees [PER Uribe  ] as the bigger threat to stability , in part because [LOC Colombia  ] 's excursion into [LOC Ecuador  ] last year showed what it can and will do , and in part because of his [LOC U.S.  ] backing . 
Under [PER Lula  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] has preferred to use personal presidential contacts , combined with more intense minister-level contacts , to manage relations with and among its more difficult neighbors . 
This is likely to be the primary method [LOC Brazil  ] will use to lower tensions in this instance .
