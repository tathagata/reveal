MADRID DAILY REPORT 11/02/07 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B .

( C ) The strong [MISC Moroccan  ] reaction to the November 5-6 visit of the King and Queen of [LOC Spain  ] to [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] seems to have caught the [ORG Zapatero  ] government completely by surprise . 
When [LOC Morocco  ] recalled its ambassador , [MISC Spanish  ] FM [MISC Moratinos  ] and his number two , [PER Bernardino Leon  ] , were reportedly spending [ORG All Saints Day  ] ( effectively a four-day weekend for most [MISC Spaniards  ] ) out of the country . 
[ORG Moratinos  ] was on a semi-private visit to [LOC Morocco  ] to attend a cultural event and [PER Leon  ] was in [LOC Tunisia  ] for the opening of a film festival. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Zapatero  ] visited [LOC Ceuta  ] and [LOC Melilla  ] in 2006 , and criticism was more muted than now . 
Also , a visit by the Prince of [LOC Asturias  ] in 2006 aroused relatively little controversy . 
The problem this time may be the head of state aspect of the visit and its timing , which coincides with the thirty-second anniversary of [LOC Morocco  ] 's " [LOC Green March  ] " into the [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
Moreover , [LOC Morocco  ] is in a prickly mood because the activist [MISC Spanish  ] judge [PER Baltazar Garzon  ] announced October 30 he would investigate possible crimes of genocide by [MISC Moroccan  ] officials in [LOC Western Sahara.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On November 4 , a long weekend got longer for [ORG Zapatero  ] when [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] landed in [LOC Madrid  ] to return four [MISC Spanish  ] flight attendants who had been jailed in [LOC Chad  ] October 25 in a bizarre case in which a [MISC French  ] [ORG NGO  ] using a chartered [MISC Spanish  ] plane attempted to airlift to [LOC France  ] 100 " orphans , " some of whom were apparently not orphans . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] and [ORG Moratinos  ] were reduced to the role of spectators as [PER Sarkozy  ] received the embraces of the [MISC Spanish  ] women he had freed . 
The comparison between [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personal intervention and [ORG Zapatero  ] 's perceived passivity was widely noted , and [PER Sarkozy  ] 's statement that [ORG Zapatero  ] was kept informed of all of the [MISC French  ] initiatives seemed somewhat left-handed . 
The cruelest cut may have come from the generally left-leaning daily [ORG El Pais  ] , which reported that the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] had not even been able to organize a plane to go to [LOC Chad  ] to repatriate the flight attendants. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: Timing is everything . 
We suspect the [ORG Zapatero  ] government saw the royal visit four months before [LOC Spain  ] 's elections as a relatively low cost way to wave the flag and beat back criticism from conservatives who say [ORG Zapatero  ] is weak in the face of regional encroachments on the central government 's power and tepid in defense of the popular King [PER Juan Carlos  ] . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] 's foreign policy advisors may have calculated that the fallout from the King 's visit would be manageable . 
It may still prove so , but the fracas , coming on top of the public perception that [LOC Spain  ] was impotent in [LOC Chad  ] , has probably only reinforced [ORG Zapatero  ] 's image as a leader who is weak on foreign relations . 
We also doubt FM [ORG Moratinos  ] stock has risen over this .
