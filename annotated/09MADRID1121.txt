[ORG HAVANA  ] 639 Classified By: Acting DCM [PER William H. Duncan  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Per request in reftel A , Post provides the following for use in assessing whether to recommend that the President continue to suspend [ORG Title III of  ] the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Liberty  ] and [ORG Solidarity  ] ( [ORG Libertad  ] ) Act . 
The information in this message is keyed to questions posed in reftel A , paragraph 4 and updates information reported in reftel B regarding the relationship between the [MISC Cuban  ] government and the Government of [LOC Spain.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] was the highest-ranking [MISC Spanish  ] official to visit [LOC Cuba  ] during the period covered by this report . 
The visit ( refs E , F ) , the subsequent " release " of two political prisoners , and the ongoing debate about [LOC Spain  ] 's efforts to replace the [ORG EU  ] 's [MISC Common Position  ] are the key factors in evaluating [MISC Spanish  ] contributions to democratic change in [LOC Cuba  ] during this period . 
Speculation that was rife during the first half of 2009 over a possible visit to [LOC Cuba  ] by [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Zapatero  ] had all but dissipated at the end of the summer , in the wake of [LOC Cuba  ] 's expulsion in May of a team of [MISC Spanish  ] intelligence agents and as the [ORG GOS  ] anticipated changes in [LOC United States  ] policy toward [LOC Cuba  ] and toward its own [ORG EU  ] presidency in 2010 . 
Asked about an anticipated trip by President [PER Zapatero  ] to [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said October 18 that given the exigencies of the [ORG EU  ] Presidency , a [PER Zapatero  ] visit was not anticipated in the near future. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Has the host country , in Post 's opinion , worked to promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Government supports democratic objectives in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Nonetheless , its focus on building relationships and its fear of both provoking a backlash against human rights activists and jeopardizing [MISC Spanish  ] economic interests limit [LOC Spain  ] 's willingness to take tough stands against the regime . 
With the [ORG European Union  ] , [LOC Spain  ] continues to seek political and economic engagement with [LOC Cuba  ] and to play a leadership role in the [ORG EU  ] 's political and human rights dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
During the period covered by this report , [MISC Spanish  ] officials alluded to [LOC Spain  ] 's hopes for even greater [MISC EU-Cuba  ] engagement during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] presidency in the first half of 2010 . 
FM [PER Moratinos  ] has spoken increasingly of the possibility of replacing the [ORG EU  ] 's 1990 [MISC Common Position  ] toward [LOC Cuba  ] during the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
[LOC Spain  ] is expected to encourage the [MISC EU27  ] to start negotiating an alternative cooperation agreement with [LOC Cuba  ] , to include a " democratic clause " and requirements with regard to [ORG Human Rights and Rule of Law  ] , as a precursor to eliminating the [MISC Common Position  ] . 
( NOTE: A bi-partisan , non-binding roadmap for the [MISC Spanish  ] presidency agreed to November 18 makes no mention of [LOC Cuba  ] , however . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] officials claim the [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] remains committed to the spirit of the [MISC Common Position  ] but [LOC Spain  ] seeks to initiate an [ORG EU  ] process to find a new way to relate to [LOC Cuba  ] that includes a political dialogue conditioned on results . 
Though the [ORG European Commission  ] would decide among various forms of accords , the [ORG GOS  ] says a new country strategy paper with a democratic clause that puts everything on the table would be stricter than the existing [MISC Common Position  ] . 
FM [PER Moratinos  ] testified in the [ORG Senate  ] on November 17 that not a single [ORG EU  ] country had spoken against his intention to replace the [MISC Common Position  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
According to [PER Moratinos  ] , some other [MISC European  ] countries might try to make adjustments , but the [MISC Spanish  ] proposal -- to negotiate a bilateral [MISC EU-Cuba  ] agreement that would lead to greater [MISC Cuban  ] compliance with human rights and engagement on reform activities -- was not encountering any opposition. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Following [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] 's October 17-19 trip to [LOC Havana  ] , reportedly as a concession to the [ORG GOS  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] announced October 20 the release of two individuals and eased travel restrictions for two prominent dissidents seeking medical attention . 
[PER Moratinos  ] claimed publicly that the releases were proof that [LOC Spain  ] , s policy of engagement achieved positive results . 
[LOC Cuba  ] commuted the sentence ( already half completed ) of [PER Nelson Aguiar  ] , aged 64 , one of the Group of 75 condemned in 2003 . 
[MISC Spanish  ] businessman [PER Pedro Hermosilla  ] , detained several weeks earlier in [LOC Havana  ] on bribery charges , was released on bail the night of October 19 , reportedly at the request of [PER Moratinos  ] . 
[PER Lazaro Angulo  ] , another of the Group of 75 , had been granted provisional release in 2006 for health reasons but was prevented from leaving [LOC Cuba  ] . 
As of October 20 , [PER Angulo  ] was " free without conditions " ( presumably to seek medical care in [LOC Costa Rica  ] or the [LOC Untied States  ] ) . 
A fourth individual , [PER Elsa Morejon  ] , the wife of imprisoned activist Dr. [PER Oscar Biscet  ] , who already had a [MISC GOC-issued  ] health exit permit , was allowed by her handlers to travel in search of medical treatment . 
( She has been under a doctor 's care in [LOC Oviedo  ] since November 3 . 
) Post 's dissident contacts called the [PER Moratinos  ] trip and subsequent news of the releases " absurd " and " stingy " ( cochinilla ) and dismissed the lessening of restrictions on [PER Angulo  ] 's and [PER Morejon  ] 's movement , saying the [MISC Cuban  ] government had no right to prevent free people from pursuing medical care . 
Asked whether the [ORG MFA  ] felt it could take credit for the " releases " and whether [LOC Spain  ] was satisfied , Director General for [ORG IberoAmerican Affairs  ] Juan [PER Carlos Sanchez Alonso  ] conceded they were insufficient but " better than nothing . 
" [LOC Cuba  ] wanted to send a message and the [ORG GOS  ] , though it wants all the prisoners to be released , encouraged the [MISC Cuban  ] government to allow the sickest of the prisoners to leave. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Has the host country made public statements or undertaken other governmental actions , such as resolutions in national assemblies condemning human rights abuses in [LOC Cuba  ] ; or actions in support of civil society in [LOC Cuba  ] through the host country 's diplomatic missions or other fora ? 
President [PER Zapatero  ] publicly supported [LOC U.S.  ] overtures toward [LOC Cuba  ] on May 24 , saying it was up to [PER Raul Castro  ] to make the next move . 
[ORG GOS  ] officials have been generally supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] policy initiatives , sometimes suggesting the [LOC United States  ] is becoming more like [LOC Spain  ] in its approach to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Referencing the June 3 resolution to lift the 47-year-old suspension of [LOC Cuba  ] in the [ORG OAS  ] , [ORG MFA  ] State Secretary for [MISC Latin America  ] [PER Juan Pablo de Laiglesia  ] commented June 4 , " We think it is an important step for the strengthening of the inter-American system , and to overcome situations that took place under circumstances that are not the current ones . 
" Before the [ORG Senate Commission  ] for [MISC Latin American  ] Affairs on June 9 , FM [PER Moratinos  ] opined that the [LOC U.S.  ] decision to " accept [LOC Cuba  ] " ( at the [ORG OAS  ] ) was in line with what [LOC Spain  ] had always proposed: continued dialogue with [MISC Cuban  ] authorities amid mutual respect . 
[PER Moratinos  ] commented , " We do not follow [LOC Washington  ] . 
When the [LOC U.S.  ] has the same policy as the [ORG GOS  ] , we congratulate ourselves , we support it , and we go with it . 
But we don't subordinate ourselves , as the previous ( [ORG PP  ] ) government did on an issue as important to [LOC Spain  ] as [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" [PER Moratinos  ] outlined [ORG GOS  ] policy on [LOC Cuba  ] , claiming [LOC Spain  ] pressed [LOC Cuba  ] to release 12 political prisoners , engage with the international community , and open a dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] on immigration and humanitarian aid issues. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) Secretary of State for [ORG IberoAmerican Affairs de Laiglesia  ] testified June 23 before the congressional [ORG Commission  ] of Foreign Affairs that [LOC Spain  ] believed the rest of the [ORG EU  ] , [MISC Latin American  ] governments , and the [ORG Obama Administration  ] supported [ORG GOS  ] policy of " critical dialogue " with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER De Laiglesia  ] stated the [ORG GOS  ] preferred not to judge the decisions made by [MISC Latin American  ] countries and favored a policy of respect over a judgmental " policy of declarations . 
" [PER De Laiglesia  ] told the commission there were noticeable reforms under [PER Raul Castro  ] , including a reduction in the number of political prisoners and the absence of new harassment measures against the [MISC Cuban  ] opposition , directly attributable to the [ORG GOS  ] decision to re-open communications with [LOC Cuba  ] in 2004. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Coupled with [PER Moratinos  ] 's subsequent meeting in [LOC Madrid  ] with [PER Adriana Perez  ] and [PER Olga Salanueva  ] , spouses of [PER Gerardo Hernandez  ] and [PER Rene Gonzalez  ] , two of five [MISC Cuban  ] citizens sentenced in 2001 in the [LOC United States  ] for serving as unregistered agents of the [MISC Cuban  ] government , [PER Moratinos  ] 's refusal to engage with civil society while in [LOC Havana  ] drew harsh criticism from human rights activists . 
A group of 37 [MISC Cuban  ] political prisoners released a statement October 26 criticizing [LOC Spain  ] 's policy toward [LOC Cuba  ] , stating that FM [PER Moratinos  ] showed " disrespect " to the peaceful opposition by ignoring the group 's request for a meeting during his recent visit . 
The group thanked the [ORG GOS  ] for its efforts resulting in the release of political prisoner [PER Nelson Aguiar  ] , but warned that the gesture should not be taken as a " general willingness for change in general by the [MISC Cuban  ] government , and should not merit changes in the [MISC Spanish  ] and [ORG EU  ] policy toward [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" By way of response , [PER Moratinos  ] pointed out that other prisoners have thanked the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador to [LOC Cuba  ] for [ORG GOS  ] efforts and that the [ORG GOS  ] is working for improvement on the island . 
Asked October 18 why he did not meet with [MISC Cuban  ] dissidents , [PER Moratinos  ] responded that he did not come to meet with any one sector of society in particular but to strengthen bilateral relations , and he said that no one is his delegation would be meeting with the opposition or dissidents . 
MFA DG for [MISC IberoAmerican Affairs  ] [PER Sanchez Alonso  ] told POLOFF October 29 that [PER Moratinos  ] knew of [MISC Cuban  ] plans to liberate prisoners and did not want to risk their release over contentious discussions with the [MISC Cubans  ] about where he could go and who he could see . 
The [ORG GOS  ] did not make a formal offer to meet with dissidents , but [PER Sanchez Alonso  ] asserted they had unlimited access to the [MISC Spanish  ] mission in [LOC Havana  ] . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] 's political counselor talked to them ( see also ref E ) , saying perhaps that was not the level of interaction the dissidents ( none of whom had been elected and who did not represent all of [MISC Cuban  ] society ) would have preferred. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Have there been any high-level diplomatic visits between [LOC Cuba  ] and the host country in the past six months ? --Representatives of [MISC Spanish  ] autonomous community and local governments visit [LOC Cuba  ] often and maintain contacts and collaborative relationships . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] government encourages and facilitates relations with the autonomous communities , especially with the [ORG Basque Country  ] and to a lesser extent with [LOC Andalucia  ] , [LOC Galicia  ] , [LOC Castilla-La Mancha  ] , and the [LOC Canary Islands  ] . 
[MISC Catalonian  ] Vice President [PER Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira  ] , of the independence-minded [MISC Republican  ] Left of [LOC Catalonia  ] ( [ORG ERC  ] ) party , visited [LOC Havana  ] July 5-7 on a cultural trip entitled " The [MISC Catalan  ] Footprint in the [LOC Caribbean  ] , " part of a longer trip in which [PER Carod-Rovira  ] visited [MISC Catalan  ] communities in the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] and [LOC Puerto Rico  ] . 
Carod made public comments to [MISC Cubans  ] of [MISC Catalonian  ] decent , visited the [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG Parliament  ] and met the President of the [ORG Parliament  ] , [PER Ricardo Alarcon  ] . 
-- [PER Elena Valenciano  ] , [ORG PSOE International Relations  ] Secretary , announced in August she would lead a delegation to [LOC Cuba  ] in October to assess the situation , and reach out to new interlocutors in the [MISC Cuban  ] government and the [ORG Cuban Communist Party  ] . 
[PER Valenciano  ] made no promises to meet with dissidents . 
Secretary of State de [PER Laiglesia  ] stressed to the Charge in September that [PER Valenciano  ] would be traveling in a political capacity and representing the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , not/not the [ORG GOS  ] ( ref C ) . 
NOTE: The trip never took place , however . 
-- FM [PER Moratinos  ] earned the [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] title of " [PER Castro  ] , s [ORG Man  ] in [LOC Europe  ] " upon visiting the island October 17-19 . 
The trip had as stated objectives to reinforce political dialogue , promote bilateral dialogue , to inform [MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bruno Rodriguez  ] and other officials about [LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG EU  ] Presidency objectives , and to reciprocate the October 2008 visit to [LOC Madrid  ] of former [MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister [PER Perez Roque  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] saw his [MISC Cuban  ] counterpart , [PER Bruno Rodriguez  ] , for lunch October 19 . 
Following a three-hour meeting with [PER Raul Castro  ] on October 19 Half of which was devoted to human rights , according to MFA staff ) , [PER Moratinos  ] told the press that [MISC Spanish-Cuban  ] bilateral relations were " normalized " and that as of one [LOC Spain  ] 's priorities during its [ORG EU  ] Presidency , [LOC Madrid  ] would seek the elimination of the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Common Position  ] and its replacement with a mechanism that seeks to condition the normalization of relations between [LOC Member States  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] on the latter 's democratization efforts and respect for human rights , in particular civil and political rights . 
[PER Moratinos  ] declared that the international community should not seek a political gesture from [LOC Havana  ] and added it should be the [MISC Cubans  ] who decide how to carry out their political affairs . 
According to press reports subsequent to both [PER Moratinos  ] 's visit and [ORG Zapatero  ] 's October 13 meeting at the [LOC White House  ] , President [PER Obama  ] asked [LOC Spain  ] to transmit a message to the [MISC Cuban  ] government: " Tell [PER Raul  ] that if he does not take any steps , I will not be able to either . 
" [MISC Spanish  ] diplomatic sources told leading daily [ORG El Pais  ] that [PER Obama  ] said [PER Moratinos  ] should " tell the [MISC Cuban  ] authorities we understand that change can't happen overnight , but down the road , when we look back at this time , it should be clear that now is when those changes began . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) What is the nature of investments ( and names , if known ) that host country businesses have in [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
[LOC Spain  ] is believed to be the largest foreign investor in [LOC Cuba  ] , though [MISC Spanish  ] companies avoid publishing precise data out of concern that such information will be used to further [LOC U.S.  ] enforcement actions under the [ORG Libertad Act  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , Tourism , and Trade ( [ORG MITYC  ] ) reported that there was no significant investment in [LOC Cuba  ] in 2008 even though [LOC Spain  ] continues to be among the foreign countries with the largest economic presence in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Tourism is one of the main industries in [LOC Cuba  ] and [LOC Spain  ] has a dominant position in the sector . 
Most of the 54 4-and 5-star hotels managed by foreign firms are owned by [MISC Spanish  ] companies . 
[ORG Tobacco  ] is another leading [MISC Spanish  ] investment in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[ORG Imperial Tobacco  ] , which acquired [MISC Altadis  ] ( formerly [LOC Tabacalera  ] , [LOC S.A  ] . 
) in January 2008 , has a 50 percent interest in Corporacion [ORG Habanos  ] , the exclusive worldwide distributor of premium [MISC Cuban  ] cigar brands such as [ORG Bohiba  ] and [ORG Montecristo  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] is also among [LOC Spain  ] 's largest markets [MISC Latin America  ] , with [MISC Spanish  ] exports of 312.7 million euros in the first eight months of 2009 . 
During his October visit , Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] tried to secure payment of USD 300 million owed by [LOC Cuba  ] to 280 [MISC Spanish  ] businesses but blocked in [MISC Cuban  ] banks . 
[MISC Spanish  ] telecommunications giant [ORG Telefonica  ] -- currently operating in several [MISC Latin American  ] countries including [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , and [LOC Venezuela  ] -- expressed interest in entering the [MISC Cuban  ] market at a telecommunications conference in [LOC Santander  ] on September 2 . 
President for [MISC Latin America  ] Affairs [PER Jose Maria Alvarez Pallete  ] said [ORG Telefonica  ] would like to buy [ORG Telecom Italia  ] 's 27 per cent stake in state-owned [MISC Cuban  ] operator [ORG Etesca  ] . 
[PER Alvarez  ] saw good prospects in [LOC Cuba  ] , due to the low market penetration in a population of 11 million. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Are there any bilateral trade agreements or other cooperative agreements between host country and [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
There is a bilateral " [ORG Commission  ] on [ORG Economic-Industrial Cooperation  ] " between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] that is intended to promote bilateral trade and investment . 
The work of the [ORG Commission  ] has been suspended for several years due to disputes over [LOC Cuba  ] 's non-payment of debt to [MISC Spanish  ] entities . 
[LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] have bilateral cooperative agreements on air transportation , mutual customs assistance , promotion and protection of investment , double taxation and tax evasion , tourism , and scientific and technical cooperation . 
[LOC Spain  ] offered to restructure [LOC Cuba  ] 's debt of more than 1,500 euros and provide more than 100 million euros in short-term credit after the recent hurricanes. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Are there any exchange programs between host country and [LOC Cuba  ] , including but not limited to: scholarships for host country nationals to study in [LOC Cuba  ] ; [LOC Cuban-paid  ] medical travel for host country nationals ; and [MISC Cuban  ] doctors working in the host country ? 
Post is not aware of any such programs between [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] . 
However , [MISC Spanish  ] regional governments have substantial assistance programs in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Such assistance is channeled primarily through the [MISC Cuban  ] government , and to a lesser degree through multilateral aid organizations .
