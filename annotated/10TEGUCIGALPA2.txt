09 [LOC TEGUCIGALPA  ] 1310 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Hugo Llorens  ] , reason 1.4 ( B and D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The Ambassador met with President-elect [PER Porfirio  ] " Pepe " [PER Lobo  ] at the Embassy on January 4 and discussed the need for full implementation of the [ORG Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord  ] , and most importantly for de facto regime leader [PER Micheletti  ] to step aside immediately . 
[PER Lobo  ] sought the Ambassador 's counsel on building international support for his administration , and reaffirmed his desire to build his own government of national unity to foster reconciliation in [MISC Honduran  ] society and politics . 
They agreed a truth commission would aid in healing society 's wounds following months of strife . 
The Ambassador also noted the importance of showing clear civilian authority over the [MISC Honduran  ] [ORG Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG HOAF  ] ) , and in particular the negative impact on both the country and the [ORG HOAF  ] itself of appointing a Minister of Defense who was associated with the June 28 coup d'etat . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] and president-elect [PER Lobo  ] , who had just returned from a brief holiday visiting relatives in [LOC New Orleans  ] , met January 4 in the [ORG Ambassador  ] 's office . 
[PER Lobo  ] thanked the [ORG Ambassador  ] for notifying [ORG Diplomatic Security of  ] his visit , which allowed him to forego some of his [MISC Honduran  ] security package while on vacation . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he was somewhat uncomfortable with the large size and high profile of the [MISC Honduran  ] armed forces ( [ORG HOAF  ] ) security detail assigned to him immediately following his election , and the relative anonymity he enjoyed in [LOC New Orleans  ] was a relief after the pressure of the campaign and the post-election political environment . 
[PER Lobo  ] appeared tanned , rested and ready to take on the many challenges that face him. ------------------------------------------ Status of the [ORG Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador told [PER Lobo  ] that the [LOC United States  ] remained fully committed to the full implementation of the [ORG Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord  ] , noting that the [ORG USG  ] saw the status of accord implementation as a compass for re-establishing the democratic and constitutional order in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] appreciated [PER Lobo  ] 's parallel interest in resolving the political crisis following the June 2009 coup d'etat . 
The Ambassador said time was running out , and de facto regime leader [PER Micheletti  ] needed to make a decision to step down immediately to allow creation of a national unity government in advance of the January 27 inauguration . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] understood that at this late stage , a complete change in cabinet was not feasible , but that [PER Micheletti  ] 's departure well before inauguration day and the replacement of at least the Minister of Government was necessary if [LOC Honduras  ] was to draw international support for the inauguration and the normalization of relations with the [PER Lobo  ] administration. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador stated that [LOC U.S.  ] insistence on [PER Micheletti  ] 's departure was the reason for the January 5-6 visit of [ORG Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs Principal Deputy Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Craig Kelly  ] . 
He said that [LOC Washington  ] was not inclined to look favorably on [PER Micheletti  ] waiting until the last days before the inauguration to step aside ; a mid-January departure was necessary in order to give [PER Lobo  ] the space to build some international support and hope for international participation in the inauguration . 
The Ambassador explained that PDAS [PER Kelly  ] would offer positive incentives for [PER Micheletti  ] and his team to step aside , but would also make clear that if [PER Micheletti  ] continued to thumb his nose at the [LOC United States  ] and the rest of the international community , there would be repercussions . 
He said it would be very difficult for [PER Micheletti  ] and his supporters to ever get their [LOC U.S.  ] visas back , for example. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Lobo  ] responded that he was totally committed to the full implementation of the accord and immediate resignation of [PER Micheletti  ] in favor of a national unity government . 
He said that -- as the Ambassador was aware , he had met with [PER Micheletti  ] twice to press him to step aside , and had also made frequent public statements in support of the accord . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he believed [PER Micheletti  ] was looking for a way out , but his hard line supporters were making this difficult for him . 
He noted [PER Micheletti  ] is isolated , and the hard liners are constantly telling him he is a great hero , loved by the [MISC Honduran  ] public for saving democracy -- and that the [MISC Americans  ] will not restore his visa even if he does step down now . 
[PER Lobo  ] added that he supported PDAS [PER Kelly  ] 's visit , and confirmed that he and former [MISC Honduran  ] president [PER Ricardo Maduro  ] would brief [PER Kelly  ] on [PER Maduro  ] 's January 4 meeting with [MISC Salvadoran  ] [PER FM Martinez  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] said that he would follow up on [PER Kelly  ] 's visit by meeting with [PER Micheletti  ] again to press him to step down immediately. --------------------------------- Transition and Building a Cabinet --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The Ambassador said he understood [PER Lobo  ] wanted to send his senior advisors , especially his economic team to [LOC Washington  ] for consultations , but given the current efforts he thought it would be bad timing ( Ref A ) . 
He noted that both sides of the [LOC U.S.  ] political spectrum were placing pressure on the administration regarding [LOC Honduras  ] , and the [MISC Democrats  ] in [ORG Congress  ] had placed a hold on millions of dollars of assistance money for [LOC Honduras  ] . 
The Ambassador suggested [PER Lobo  ] wait and see how [PER Kelly  ] 's visit went , and [PER Lobo  ] agreed. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador praised [PER Lobo  ] for his keen commitment to creating his own national unity government . 
He said he knew that [PER Lobo  ] had made offers to the leadership of the other political parties to join in the new administration . 
[PER Lobo  ] confirmed that he had offered the Minister of Culture position to center-left [ORG Social Democratic Innovation and Unity  ] ( [ORG PINU  ] ) [ORG Party  ] presidential candidate [PER Bernard Martinez  ] and Minister of Labor to center-right [ORG Christian Democratic Party  ] presidential candidate [PER Felicito Avila  ] , and both had accepted . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he had also offered positions to senior members of [ORG Liberal Party  ] presidential candidate [PER Elvin Santos'  ] team , noting that [ORG Santos  ] himself had stated he was not prepared to take a position himself in the next government . 
[PER Lobo  ] added that he had offered a cabinet position to left-of-center , ( and anti-coup ) [ORG Democratic Unification Party  ] candidate [PER Cesar Ham  ] , but had not yet received a reply . 
[PER Lobo  ] asked the Ambassador for his help in encouraging [PER Ham  ] to accept a role in the government , noting he was aware the Ambassador had met with [PER Ham  ] in December . 
( [PER Note: Ham  ] met with the Ambassador December 17 . 
Details reported Ref [PER C. End  ] note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Lobo  ] also sought the Ambassador 's help in finding a counterbalance to his popular designee for Security Minister , [PER Oscar Alvarez  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] noted that [PER Alvarez  ] , who received the most votes of any congressional candidate in the November 2009 election , was an " empire builder , " and therefore [PER Lobo  ] wanted to find a designee for Vice Minister who would not be " [PER Alvarez  ] 's man . 
" ( [PER Note: Alvarez  ] , who was Security Minister in the [PER Maduro  ] administration , has already stated his intent to select his former Vice Minister [PER Armando Caledonio  ] . 
According to [MISC Honduran  ] law , the Vice Minister position is nominated by the Minister , subject to approval by the President . 
End note . 
) [PER Lobo  ] noted security was not his area of expertise , and he hoped the Ambassador could suggest names of some qualified , clean candidates for the position who would not be beholden to [PER Alvarez  ] . 
He said on the matter of addressing the transnational threat of crime and trafficking , sovereignty was not an issue , and he welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] inputs . 
The Ambassador said he would consult his security and law enforcement team on the matter. ----------------- [ORG Truth Commission  ] ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Lobo  ] agreed with the Ambassador 's suggestion to invite [MISC Tegucigalpa-San  ] [ORG Jose Accord Verification Commission  ] members Labor Secretary [PER Solis  ] and former [MISC Chilean  ] president [LOC Lagos  ] to come to [LOC Honduras  ] in February and join their [ORG Honduran Verification Commission  ] colleagues in launching a truth commission . 
The Ambassador stressed that a truth commission would be a critical element in achieving national reconciliation , along with a government of national unity . 
He acknowledged there was no cookie-cutter method to forming or conducting the work of a post-conflict truth commission , and that while there were certainly human rights violations committed during the political crisis that followed the June 2009 coup , [LOC Honduras  ] had not seen the levels of violence as other countries which had formed truth commissions , such as [LOC Chile  ] , [LOC Guatemala  ] or [LOC South Africa  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] agreed with the Ambassador that the truth commission should be a forum for all stories to be told surrounding the political crisis without indicting anyone , acknowledging that all sides of the political classes had failed [MISC Honduran  ] society in the political collapse of 2009 . 
They agreed that what had taken place was a failure of political leadership by President [PER Jose Manuel  ] " [PER Mel  ] " [PER Zelaya  ] in the months leading up to the June coup , as well as [PER Micheletti  ] and other institutions in supporting the coup . 
[PER Lobo  ] stated that while he believed [PER Zelaya  ] had largely created the environment that led to the coup , he also believed that what took place in June was wrong . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he felt the [ORG Organization of American States  ] ( [ORG OAS  ] ) would have a natural role to play in forming and supporting the truth commission. ----------------- The [ORG Armed Forces  ] ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said that another important element for restoring the international community 's confidence in [LOC Honduras  ] and [MISC Honduran  ] democracy was for the new administration to demonstrate clearly that the [ORG HOAF  ] was under civilian control . 
He said the [ORG HOAF  ] had taken a major step backward in its role in the coup , though in fairness , it had been the civilian political factions on both sides which had dragged the [ORG HOAF  ] into the political conflict . 
The Ambassador advised [PER Lobo  ] to take steps to establish to the international community that the [ORG HOAF  ] was under strong civilian management , and that to do so would not only help [LOC Honduras  ] , but also the [ORG HOAF  ] itself by restoring its positive image internationally . 
He noted that he had heard Chief of [LOC Defense MG  ] [PER Vasquez Velasquez  ] was lobbying hard to be appointed Minister of [LOC Defense  ] , and that this would be seen very negatively by the international community , given [PER Vasquez  ] 's role in the coup . 
The Ambassador stressed it was [PER Lobo  ] 's decision to make , but that selection of any military figure closely associated with the coup would create a serious image problem in the international perspective. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Lobo  ] acknowledged that management of the [ORG HOAF  ] would be a critical challenge for his administration . 
He said that [PER Vasquez  ] was on his short list for [LOC Defense Minister  ] , and he had not considered the international implications of such an appointment , but saw the Ambassador 's point clearly . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he would not appoint [PER Vasquez  ] to be his [LOC Defense Minister  ] . 
He noted [PER Vasquez  ] was seeking a " soft landing " in the civilian political forum , but that he would encourage [PER Vasquez  ] to stay away from government for a while and revisit his prospects in six months or so. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Despite  ] showing a clear appreciation of the serious social and economic challenges before him , [PER Lobo  ] appeared relaxed and confident during the meeting -- a far cry from the pre-election [PER Lobo  ] , who had worn the stress of the campaign heavily . 
[PER Lobo  ] also made a point that " two thirds of [LOC Honduras  ] 's international portfolio is the [LOC United States  ] " and he was eager to rebuild a strong relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] has made every indication that he fully grasps the broader implications of the [MISC Honduran  ] political crisis and is prepared to show the sort of leadership that has been sorely lacking in the persons of President [PER Zelaya  ] and de facto regime leader [PER Micheletti  ] . 
End comment .
