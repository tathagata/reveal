BERLIN 200 Classified By: [ORG DCM  ] John [PER M. Koenig  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In a February 6 discussion with [MISC German  ] Deputy National Security Adviser [PER Rolf Nikel  ] , the [ORG DCM  ] reiterated our strong concerns about the possible issuance of international arrest warrants in the al-Masri case . 
The [ORG DCM  ] noted that the reports in the [MISC German  ] media of the discussion on the issue between the Secretary and FM [ORG Steinmeier  ] in [LOC Washington  ] were not accurate , in that the media reports suggest the [ORG USG  ] was not troubled by developments in the al-Masri case . 
The [ORG DCM  ] emphasized that this was not the case and that issuance of international arrest warrants would have a negative impact on our bilateral relationship . 
He reminded [PER Nikel  ] of the repercussions to [MISC U.S.-Italian  ] bilateral relations in the wake of a similar move by [MISC Italian  ] authorities last year. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG DCM  ] pointed out that our intention was not to threaten [LOC Germany  ] , but rather to urge that the [MISC German  ] Government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] We of course recognized the independence of the [MISC German  ] judiciary , but noted that a decision to issue international arrest warrants or extradition requests would require the concurrence of the [MISC German  ] Federal Government , specifically the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( [ORG MOJ  ] ) . 
The [ORG DCM  ] said our initial indications had been that the [MISC German  ] federal authorities would not allow the warrants to be issued , but that subsequent contacts led us to believe this was not the case. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Nikel  ] also underscored the independence of the [MISC German  ] judiciary , but confirmed that the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOJ  ] would have a procedural role to play . 
He said the case was subject to political , as well as judicial , scrutiny . 
From a judicial standpoint , the facts are clear , and the [LOC Munich  ] prosecutor has acted correctly . 
Politically speaking , said [PER Nikel  ] , [LOC Germany  ] would have to examine the implications for relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] At the same time , he noted our political differences about how the global war on terrorism should be waged , for example on the appropriateness of the [LOC Guantanamo  ] facility and the alleged use of renditions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Nikel  ] also cited intense pressure from the [ORG Bundestag  ] and the [MISC German  ] media . 
The [MISC German  ] federal Government must consider the " entire political context , " said [PER Nikel  ] . 
He assured the [ORG DCM  ] that the [ORG Chancellery  ] is well aware of the bilateral political implications of the case , but added that this case " will not be easy . 
" The [ORG Chancellery  ] would nonetheless try to be as constructive as possible. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG DCM  ] pointed out that the [ORG USG  ] would likewise have a difficult time in managing domestic political implications if international arrest warrants are issued . 
He reiterated our concerns and expressed the hope that the [ORG Chancellery  ] would keep us informed of further developments in the case , so as to avoid surprises . 
[PER Nikel  ] undertook to do so , but reiterated that he could not , at this point " promise that everything will turn out well .
