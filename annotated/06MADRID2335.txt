( C/NF ) Charge paid an introductory call on MOD Secretary General for [ORG Policy Admiral  ] [PER Francisco Torrente  ] on September <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
Charge told [PER Torrente  ] that the [LOC US  ] deeply appreciates the hospitality and use of [MISC Spanish  ] bases , as well as the strong foundation that the military-military relationship provides to the overall bilateral relationship . 
[PER Torrente  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] is well aware that it is not the military equal of the [LOC US  ] and that , because the relationship is necessarily unequal , [LOC Spain  ] appreciates being acknowledged for its basing and other contributions to the defense relationship with close attention to form and public appearances. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) On the [MISC NCIS/OSI  ] issue , [PER Torrente  ] emphasized that the [ORG GOS  ] doesn't disagree with the [MISC DOD  ] concept of force protection and doesn't want to restrict [MISC NCIS/OSI  ] activities - it just wants to be involved in these activities from the start . 
He said that he believes that [MISC NCIS/OSI  ] is not carrying out illegal activities , so there would be no reason for the [ORG GOS  ] to prohibit any activity . 
[PER Torrente  ] said that [MISC NCIS/OSI  ] is a tricky issue for the [ORG GOS  ] , particularly because the press has mixed up [MISC NCIS/OSI  ] with the [ORG CIA  ] flights issues , and because radical parties that are the governing Socialist party 's legislative partners in Parliament can be hard to control . 
[PER Torrente  ] acknowledged that the [LOC US  ] may think that he is being stubborn on this issue , but they have to understand that he represents the [ORG GOS  ] position . 
He said that he is glad that the [ORG USG  ] has finally settled on an appropriate interlocutor ( NOTE: DASD [PER Dan Fata  ] recently met with [PER Torrente  ] ) and that he looks forward to seeing the small changes that OSD will propose to the current negotiating draft. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) In response to Charge 's questions about the possibility that [LOC Spain  ] could do more to support the [ORG NATO  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Torrente  ] listed a number of the projects that [LOC Spain  ] is working on in the area of its [ORG Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] , including road building , paving the runway , distributing radios and broadcasting programs to the local population , and providing medical care . 
He said that he agreed with General [PER Jones  ] that more troops are needed but said that the [ORG ISAF  ] mission can't be accomplished by eight nations alone , so other [MISC European  ] countries need to contribute . 
[PER Torrente  ] agreed with Secretary [PER Rice  ] 's call to attack drug production at its roots , noting that it would be a long-term project . 
He expects [MISC Spanish  ] troops to be in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for 15-20 years. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Similarly , [PER Torrente  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] expects to be in [LOC Lebanon  ] for a long time , and therefore other [MISC European  ] allies would need to rotate their troops in to support the [ORG UNIFIL  ] mission . 
He specifically mentioned the [MISC Poles  ] and their prior [ORG UNIFIL  ] experience . 
[PER Torrente  ] also mentioned that while UNSCR 1701 is important , it doesn't fully address the issue of [ORG Hizballah  ] , which is both a terrorist organization and part of the government . 
[PER Torrente  ] also talked about [LOC Spain  ] 's engagement with [LOC Syria  ] , with whom he said [LOC Spain  ] has good relations , and [LOC Iran  ] , with which he said that relations were better under previous President [PER Khatami  ] .
