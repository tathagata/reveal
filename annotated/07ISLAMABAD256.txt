End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Meeting Participants: [LOC U.S.  ] Assistant Secretary [PER Richard A. Boucher  ] , [ORG Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs  ] Ambassador [PER Ryan C. Crocker Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry  ] , Commander , [ORG Combined Forces Command  ] - [ORG Afghanistan Major General  ] [PER Ronald Helmly  ] , Defense Representative to [LOC Pakistan  ] Ms. [PER Caitlin Hayden  ] , [ORG Senior Advisor  ] , [ORG Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs  ] Embassy notetaker [LOC Pakistan  ] President [PER Pervez Musharraf Lieutenant General  ] [PER Hamid Javaid  ] , Chief of Staff Additional Secretary [PER Shahid Kamal  ] , [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs Major General  ] [PER Shafqaat Ahmed  ] , Deputy Chief of Staff [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- Rhetoric and [PER Bugti  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Musharraf  ] decried the heated rhetoric emanating from [MISC Afghan  ] officials over the past month . 
Public accusations that al [ORG Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] figures are operating in our border regions are perhaps understandable , [PER Musharraf  ] said , but it is completely unacceptable for [MISC Afghan  ] officials to accuse the Government of [LOC Pakistan  ] and [ORG Inter Services Intelligence  ] of collusion with the enemy . 
Warming to his topic , [PER Musharraf  ] described Prime Minister [PER Shaukat Aziz’s  ] January 4 visit to [LOC Kabul  ] as a bad meeting , saying that President [PER Karzai  ] bombarded the [MISC Pakistani  ] delegation with outlandish accusations that [LOC Pakistan  ] seeks to enslave the [MISC Afghans  ] to achieve strategic depth . 
This is nonsense , [PER Musharraf  ] concluded ; to the contrary , [LOC Pakistan  ] wants good relations with the [MISC Afghan  ] government and with all communities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC Pakistani  ] officials and diplomats are under his personnel instructions not to interfere in Afghanistan’s affairs . 
[PER Boucher  ] advised the President that [LOC U.S.  ] officials have noted the aggravated level of cross-border rhetoric and have counseled [MISC Afghan  ] interlocutors not to air their grievance in public . 
All must appreciate the need to address issues responsibly and , when appropriate , privately. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] told [PER Boucher  ] that militant [MISC Baloch  ] nationalist and fugitive [PER Brahamdagh Bugti  ] remains at large in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , enjoying freedom of movement to commute between [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Kandahar  ] , raising money and planning operations against [MISC Pakistani  ] security forces . 
[PER Boucher  ] said that he had raised [MISC Bugti’s  ] presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] with President [PER Karzai  ] , who offered assurances that nobody would be allowed to use [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a staging ground for terrorist attacks on [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] had a simple response: “That’s bullshit.” [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- [ORG Channels of Communication  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] noted the growth in channels of communication between [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Islamabad  ] , commending the exchange of information that occurs within the military [ORG Tripartite Commission  ] and in trilateral intelligence channels . 
He told his [MISC Pakistani  ] hosts that [PER Karzai  ] has agreed to support exchanges between [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] parliamentarians and encouraged the two countries to seek other opportunities to broaden their relationship . 
The President agreed , but noted that he was disappointed that the agenda for the January 10 [ORG Tripartite Commission  ] plenary session did not address the most critical common challenges facing the two countries: cross-border infiltration , repatriating [MISC Afghan  ] refugees and closing camps that have become safe havens for extremists . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] -- [ORG Better Prepared for Spring Offensive  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Lieutenant General [PER Eikenberry  ] , who was making farewell calls in [LOC Islamabad  ] before relinquishing his command on January 21 , shared his impressions of the situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] with [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] told [PER Musharraf  ] that , although the we expect the insurgents to launch a strong offensive in the spring , time is not on the Taliban’s side . 
Afghanistan’s security forces -- the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] and [ORG Afghan National Police  ] -- are growing in confidence and capacity . 
President [PER Karzai  ] is a more confident commander-in-chief and chief executive , replacing corrupt and poor-performing officials . 
Reconstruction assistance is taking root in districts throughout the country . 
[LOC U.S.  ] forces -- which will reach the highest level of strength in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in 2007 , despite the inactivation of [ORG Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan  ] -- stand ready to give [ORG NATO  ] all necessary support to achieve it mission . 
The current winter lull is the time , [PER Eikenberry  ] continued , to move forcefully to disrupt [ORG Taliban  ] command-and-control . 
A strike to the [MISC Haqqani  ] network -- which controls some [ORG Taliban  ] action from [LOC Pakistan  ] -- would deal a serious blow to both [ORG Taliban  ] operational planning and recruitment . 
Responding to Musharraf’s concern that the mil-mil [ORG Tripartite Commission  ] is not addressing issues such as refugee repatriation , [PER Eikenberry  ] offered the opinion that the [ORG Tripartite Commission  ] operates best when its participants can deal with each other soldier-to-soldier ; cross-border issues carrying significant political baggage are better addressed through other channels. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) President [PER Musharraf  ] suggested that [ORG NATO  ] forces could enhance the effort against the [ORG Taliban  ] in southern and south-eastern [LOC Afghanistan  ] by actively enlisting the support of local populations , even to the extent of arming village-level militias against [ORG Taliban  ] insurgents . 
[PER Boucher  ] described an invigorated effort to boost support for [ORG Afghan National Army  ] and [ORG Afghan National Police  ] through auxiliary police units of local residents serving under the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] . 
President [PER Karzai  ] is also responding to public frustration with poor governance and corruption by cleaning out corrupt and dishonest local officials . 
The international community is using the winter months to inject new flows of development and economic assistance out to the provinces . 
[PER Musharraf  ] applauded this effort , saying that the [ORG Taliban  ] will eventually lose popularity the more it is seen obstructing the country’s reconstruction . 
Time to Close Refugee Camps <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) President [PER Musharraf  ] advised [PER Boucher  ] that he and his senior advisors have taken several decisions in recent weeks to improve security along [ORG Pakistan’s  ] border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including closing at least one of the large camps inhabited by [MISC Afghan  ] refugees . 
These camps have become safe havens for militant elements , [PER Musharraf  ] explained . 
As extensive collateral casualties would inevitably follow any military operation to separate the militants from the civilian residents , the only solution is to begin closing the camps altogether . 
[PER Musharraf  ] has tasked his advisors with devising a camp closure plan that incorporates recommendations on where the refugees could be relocated if they choose not to return to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
These measure will then be discussed with [MISC Afghan  ] and [ORG UN  ] officials under the auspices of the refugee [ORG Tripartite Commission  ] . 
We agree with you that the camps should close , [PER Boucher  ] replied , underscoring the urgency of devising a plan and coordinating with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the [ORG UN  ] before spring . 
Stronger Border Security Measures <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Stressing that [LOC Pakistan  ] understands that it must take firm measure to gain control over its western border , [PER Musharraf  ] reviewed a range of actions already under way . 
New senior police officials appointed to posts in [LOC Balochistan  ] and [ORG North West Frontier Province  ] have been personally instructed by the President to crack down on undocumented [MISC Afghans  ] and other militant targets . 
The [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] is also in the process of lowering the number of official border crossings in [LOC Balochistan  ] from 33 to 6 . 
Enhanced immigrations procedures , including biometric crossing cards , have been introduced at the [LOC Chaman  ] border crossing , where 30,000 individuals transit daily . 
The [ORG Army  ] has been ordered to design a plan for selective fencing and mining along the border . 
[PER Musharraf  ] assured [PER Boucher  ] that [LOC Pakistan  ] has long and successful experience with mining along its eastern border , and that extraordinary measures would be implemented to prevent accidental civilian casualties or misappropriation of mines by terrorists . 
Of course , minefields will not stop terrorism , [PER Musharraf  ] said , but they can help us control the insurgents’ movements across the border . 
[PER Boucher  ] noted that deployment of land mines is a complicated issue that the [LOC U.S.  ] and other [ORG Coalition  ] partners will want to discuss with [MISC Pakistani  ] military planners . 
President [PER Musharraf  ] acknowledged that , but said that these are “unusual circumstances” and [LOC Pakistan  ] will take “unilateral measures” if needed . 
Attack on Insurgents Infiltrating from [ORG North Waziristan  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) The [MISC American  ] delegation briefed the President on the [ORG Coalition  ] assault on a massive infiltration of [ORG Taliban  ] fighters from [ORG North Waziristan  ] on January 10-11 . 
The fighters massed on the [MISC Pakistani  ] side of the border before crossing into [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where [LOC U.S.  ] forces attacked , killing up to 150 . 
[PER Musharraf  ] shared [MISC American  ] concern that the enemy could mobilize such a large force during the winter lull , and expressed some frustration that so large a force had been able to collect on [MISC Pakistani  ] territory and then cross the border unimpeded . 
He suggested that this reflected a need for greater aerial surveillance of the area or night-capable helicopter gunships to attack the enemy , indicating his willingness to coordinate with [LOC U.S.  ] forces on deploying whatever air assets are necessary to identify and destroy these enemy movements . 
( Note: The President was specific in calling for reliance on air assets , saying point blank that ground forces are not an option . 
End note . 
) Re-Assessing the [ORG North Waziristan  ] Accord <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [PER Musharraf  ] briefed [PER Boucher  ] on the government’s recent review of the September 2006 [ORG North Waziristan  ] agreement . 
Governor Orakzai convened the jirga that negotiated the agreement in December , dispatching the members to [PER Miran Shah  ] to make clear to [ORG North Waziristan’s  ] tribal leaders that they must take action to prevent cross-border infiltration in support of the [ORG Taliban  ] , eliminate foreign fighters from the [ORG Agency and  ] stop any effort to establish a parallel political administration . 
Tribal leaders were given one month to gain control of the situation or the government would consider taking military action . 
[PER Musharraf  ] refused to be disheartened , saying that it will take time for the accord to take hold . 
In the interim , the government has stepped up recruitment and training for tribal levies and has assigned a [ORG Frontier Corps  ] wing to the Political Agent . 
This will give the Political Agent the muscle he needs to enforce the writ of state , while the [ORG Army  ] will be at hand to take on [ORG Taliban  ] and [PER al Qaeda  ] targets . 
[PER Pak-Afghan Jirgas  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] commended [PER Musharraf  ] for naming strong leaders to [ORG Pakistan’s  ] [ORG Jirga Planning Commission  ] , encouraging the [ORG Commission  ] to meet soonest with its [MISC Afghan  ] counterpart to discuss each country’s vision for the process . 
Noting that he would discuss the jirgas with Interior Minister and [ORG Jirga Commission Chair  ] [PER Sherpao  ] later in the day , [PER Boucher  ] told the President that the [LOC U.S.  ] stands ready to support the process once [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] determine what assistance will be required . 
Federally Administered [ORG Tribal Areas Development Assistance  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] also spoke plans for the Federally Administered [ORG Tribal Areas Secretariat and Development Authority  ] to funnel near-term development assistance through tribal maliks , to strengthen their stature within their tribes . 
Asking maliks to identify development needs and direct resources will reinforce his authority with the local population , said [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[PER Boucher  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] hopes to offer substantial financial support for the Pakistani’s Federally Administered [ORG Tribal Areas Sustainable Development  ] Plan. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) This cable has been cleared by [ORG SCA Senior Advisor  ] [PER Caitlin Hayden  ] .
