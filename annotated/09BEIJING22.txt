<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 07 [LOC BEIJING  ] 000022 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR THE SECRETARY , DEPUTY SECRETARY , [ORG EAP A/S HILL  ] , [ORG S/P  ] , EAP/CM [ORG NSC  ] FOR DWILDER EO 12958 DECL: 01/05/2034 TAGS PREL , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC EFIN  ] , [LOC MARR  ] , [LOC MASS  ] , CH SUBJECT: LOOKING AT THE NEXT 30 YEARS OF THE U.S.-CHINA RELATIONSHIP Classified By: Ambassador [PER Clark T. Randt  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) January 1 , 2009 , marked the 30th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the [LOC United States  ] and the [LOC People’s Republic of China  ] . 
This anniversary followed the [ORG PRC  ] commemoration of roughly 30 years of [MISC China’s  ] “reform and opening” policy under [PER Deng Xiaoping  ] , which led to [MISC China’s  ] staggering economic growth. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Thirty years ago , [LOC China  ] was just emerging from the nightmare of the [MISC Cultural Revolution  ] and 30 years of fratricidal misrule . 
[MISC China’s  ] economy was crippled by years of disastrous policies like the [ORG Great Leap Forward  ] . 
The population was coming to terms with the world’s most draconian population controls enacted in 1976 after decades of [MISC Maoist  ] state-subsidies encouraging large families . 
[MISC Chinese  ] foreign relations tended to be more influenced by ideological yardsticks than economic links since [LOC China  ] had very few commercial links with the outside world . 
In 1979 , [MISC Chinese  ] urbanites on average made the equivalent of five dollars per month. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Just as no one in 1979 would have predicted that [LOC China  ] would become the [LOC United States’  ] most important relationship in thirty years , no one today can predict with certainty where our relations with [LOC Beijing  ] will be thirty years hence . 
However , given the current significance of the bilateral relationship and the risk of missing opportunities to jointly address ongoing and predictable future challenges , below we look at trends currently affecting [LOC China  ] with an eye to how those trends might affect relations . 
Several issues leap out , including [MISC China’  ] insatiable resource needs , our growing economic interdependence , [MISC China’s  ] rapid military modernization , a surge in [MISC Chinese  ] nationalism , [MISC China’s  ] demographic challenges , and the [MISC PRC’s  ] increasing influence and confidence on the world stage. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] has been plagued over the millennia by unforeseen events that devastated formerly prosperous regimes . 
[LOC Mongol  ] invasion , the [ORG Black Death  ] , uncountable peasant uprisings , warlords , tax revolts , communist dictatorship , colonialism , famine , earthquakes and other plagues were largely unforeseen by the [LOC China  ] watchers of the past . 
This report focuses generally on more optimistic projections . 
Given [MISC China’s  ] history , however , the [LOC United States  ] should also gird itself for the possibility that [LOC China  ] will fall short of today’s mostly sanguine forecasts . 
Resource Consumption -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Popular and scholarly works in recent years highlight [MISC China’s  ] growing demand for natural resources and the possible impact that [MISC China’s  ] pursuit of resources will have on its foreign policy . 
Since economic reforms began in the late 1970s , industrial and exchange rate policies have fueled investment in resource-intensive heavy industries in [MISC China’s  ] coastal region , which currently account for approximately 55 percent of the country’s total energy consumption today . 
A construction boom over the past decade has also stimulated growth in heavy industries . 
[LOC China  ] is now a leading steel producer and currently accounts for 50 percent of the world’s annual cement production . 
Reflecting [MISC China’s  ] emphasis on resource-intensive industries , [MISC China’s  ] energy utilization rate grew faster than its GDP between 2002 and 2006 . 
In 1990 , [LOC China  ] consumed 27 quadrillion [ORG British Thermal Units  ] ( BTUs ) of energy , accounting for 7.8 percent of global consumption . 
In 2006 , it consumed 68.6 quadrillion BTUs or 15.6 percent of the global total . 
According to [ORG U.S. Department of Energy statistics  ] , by 2030 [LOC China  ] will account for 145.5 quadrillion BTUs or 20.7 percent of global energy consumption. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC China’s  ] oil demand has grown substantially over the last 30 years . 
In 1980 , [LOC China  ] consumed 1.7 million barrels of oil per day , almost all of which was produced domestically . 
In 2006 , [LOC China  ] consumed 7.4 million barrels per day , second only to the [LOC United States  ] . 
According to the [ORG International Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IEA  ] ) , [MISC China’s  ] oil consumption will reach 16.5 million barrels per day in 2030 . 
More than two thirds of the increased demand will come from the [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000022 002 OF 007 transport sector as vehicle ownership rates rise . 
[LOC China  ] became a net importer of oil in 1993 , and it now relies on imports to meet a growing portion of its fossil fuel needs . 
The [ORG IEA  ] forecasts that [MISC China’s  ] oil import dependence will rise from 50 percent this year to 80 percent by 2030 , as domestic oil production peaks early in the next decade . 
To strengthen the country’s future energy security , the [MISC Chinese  ] Government has adopted a “go out” policy that encourages national oil companies ( NOCs ) to acquire equity stakes in foreign oil and gas production . 
Today , state-owned [MISC Chinese  ] oil giants [LOC CNPC/PetroChina  ] , [ORG CNOOC  ] , and [ORG Sinopec  ] can be found in [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Angola  ] , and the [MISC Caspian Basin.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] has also increased its reliance on imported minerals , and many analysts have attributed the global commodities boom of recent years in part to [MISC China’s  ] growing demand . 
Between 1980 and 2006 , [LOC China  ] became the world’s largest consumer of iron , copper and aluminum . 
[MISC Chinese  ] conglomerates are ubiquitous in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] exploiting mineral wealth there , and [MISC Chinese  ] multinationals have significant investments in [MISC Australian  ] mineral and uranium production. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC China’s  ] reliance on coal has come at an appalling environmental cost . 
This year , [LOC China  ] surpassed the [LOC United States  ] in carbon emissions , and it will soon become the world’s biggest energy consumer . 
Between now and 2030 , the [ORG IEA  ] estimates , [LOC China  ] will need to add 1,312 gigawatts of power generating capacity , more than the total current installed capacity in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Coal-fired power generation , a major source of air pollution , accounts for approximately 78 percent of [MISC China’s  ] total electricity supply , and it will likely remain the predominant fuel in electricity generation for at least the next 20 years . 
Analysts predict that domestic coal production will peak in the next 15 to 25 years . 
[LOC China  ] already became a net importer of coal in 2007 , and coal imports are expected to grow in the coming decades to meet growing demand in [MISC China’s  ] coastal provinces. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Chinese  ] Government recognizes the need to reduce dependence on coal , and it is pursuing policies to diversify its energy mix . 
[LOC China  ] is already the largest producer of renewable energy in the world , with major investments in large-scale hydro and wind power projects . 
Nuclear and natural gas power will also account for a greater proportion of energy production , but under current projections , efforts to diversify [MISC China’s  ] energy mix will not have a large enough impact to curb greenhouse gas emissions growth. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC China’s  ] energy intensive growth has also had tragic consequences for public health . 
By most measurements , at least half of the world’s most polluted major cities are in [LOC China  ] . 
Rural residents , in particular farmers , have been affected by water pollution and dwindling water supplies , which are frequently redirected for industrial use . 
Respiratory disease , water-borne illness and tainted food scares are facts of modern life in the country . 
According to a recent WHO study , diseases caused by indoor and outdoor air pollution kill 656,000 [MISC Chinese  ] citizens every year . 
Another 95,600 deaths are attributed annually to polluted drinking water. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [MISC China’s  ] increasing reliance on imported natural resources has foreign policy ramifications and provides opportunities for the [LOC United States  ] . 
A [LOC China  ] that is increasingly dependent on [LOC Middle Eastern  ] oil might be more likely to support policies that do not destabilize the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Take [LOC Iran  ] , for instance . 
We have long been frustrated that [LOC China  ] has resisted ( with [LOC Russia  ] ) tough sanctions aimed at curbing [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear program . 
In the future , a [LOC China  ] increasingly dependent on foreign energy supplies may recalculate the risk a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] would pose to the greater [LOC Persian Gulf  ] region’s capacity to export oil. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Another opportunity presented by [MISC China’s  ] increasing resource consumption is in the joint development of technological responses to reduce carbon emissions and to diminish the public health impact of industrial growth . 
Scientific publications around the world conclude that the projected rate of global energy and natural resource [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000022 003 OF 007 consumption is unsustainable . 
Experts warn that we must find alternative forms of energy in order to avert calamities posed by global climate change . 
International efforts to develop and significantly utilize renewable energy , clean up our shared global environment , and conserve our remaining raw materials will not be effective without meaningful [MISC Chinese  ] participation . 
As the world’s preeminent technological power and as a leader in multilateral energy and scientific organizations , the [LOC United States  ] is in a unique position to work with [LOC China  ] to overcome these challenges . 
Economic Interdependence and [MISC Chinese  ] Demographics --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In the next fifteen years , while [MISC China’s  ] overall population is predicted to stabilize , its urban population will likely grow to almost 1 billion , an increase ( of 300 million people ) equal to the entire current population of the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC China  ] plans to build 20,000 to 50,000 new skyscrapers over the next two decades -- as many as ten [ORG New York  ] cities . 
More than 170 [MISC Chinese  ] cities will need mass transit systems by 2025 , more than twice the number now present in all of [LOC Europe  ] . 
[LOC China  ] is now surpassing [LOC Germany  ] as the world’s third largest economy and is projected to overtake [LOC Japan  ] within the next five years . 
By the end of the next thirty years , [MISC China’s  ] economy could rival the [LOC United States  ] in overall scale ( although its per capita income will likely only be one quarter of the [LOC United States’  ] ) . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Behind these outward symbols of success will be an increasingly complicated economic picture . 
Since 1979 , by reversing the misguided economic policies of the [LOC Mao  ] era , liberalizing labor markets and prices , opening to foreign investment , and taking advantage of the [MISC West’s  ] consumer-driven policies , [LOC China  ] has maintained fast growth . 
However , the set of circumstances that allowed such impressive growth rates will no longer exist in the future. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Many speculate that [LOC China  ] has reached the limit to easy productivity gains by rationalizing the state-planned economy . 
The [ORG Economist Intelligence Unit  ] expects [MISC China’s  ] annual growth to slow from around 10 percent in the last 30 years to 4.5 percent by 2020 . 
After 2015 when the labor force peaks as a share of the population , labor costs will rise faster . 
This will increasingly make other countries like [LOC India  ] and [LOC Vietnam  ] more attractive for labor-intensive investment . 
In addition , workers will have to support a growing number of retirees . 
Early retirement ages combined with the urban one-child limits creates the so-called “4-2-1” social dilemma: each worker will have to support four grandparents , two parents and one child . 
Savings rates will start falling as the elderly draw down their retirement funds. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] will have to manage an economy increasingly dependent on domestic consumption and service industries for growth . 
Already , urbanites are buying 1,000 new cars per day , making [LOC China  ] the world’s largest [MISC Internet  ] and luxury goods market , and traveling abroad in growing numbers . 
By 2025 , [LOC China  ] will have the world’s largest middle class , and [LOC China  ] will likely have completed the transition from the majority rural population of today to a majority urban population . 
These consumers of tomorrow will likely flock to products from around the world as their [MISC North American  ] , [MISC European  ] and [MISC Japanese  ] counterparts do today , providing new opportunities for [MISC American  ] business . 
If incomes continue to grow , it is likely that the [MISC Chinese  ] middle class will react like educated urbanites in other countries by exerting pressure on the Government to improve its dismal performance on environmental protection , food and product safety . 
We are already seeing increased public activism over such issues today. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] will face a challenge in the next thirty years encouraging this urban consumption while dealing with the social equality issues inherent in a rural population where over 200 million people still live on less than a dollar a day . 
[LOC China  ] will also have to find a way to improve the lot of between 150 and 230 million migrant workers who today must leave their children and aging parents behind in their home villages to travel to the industrial centers of the [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000022 004 OF 007 relatively developed coastal regions to work in factories or on construction projects. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) With [MISC China’s  ] phenomenal growth has come increased economic interdependence . 
This will likely increase , although some of the less-balanced elements of [MISC China’s  ] economic interactions should be mitigated . 
Rising consumption rates should work to lower [MISC China’s  ] trade surplus as well as its overabundance of foreign exchange reserves . 
More assets controlled by corporations and individuals , as opposed to the government , will diversify outward investment , reducing political control by [LOC Beijing  ] , but also the utility of political suasion for [LOC U.S.  ] policymakers interested in effecting the flow of capital to international hotspots . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Nationalism and Confidence on the International Stage --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) As one of two main pillars of post-Mao [ORG Chinese Communist Party  ] rule ( the other being sustained economic growth ) , [MISC Chinese  ] nationalism is growing and should be monitored closely . 
As witnessed during the 2008 [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Olympics  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] are increasingly proud of the tremendous strides their country has made in recent years . 
More and more young people see [LOC China  ] as having “arrived” and might possess the confidence and willingness to assume the responsibilities of a major power . 
However , as was evident during protests over the 1999 mistaken bombing of the [MISC Chinese  ] Embassy in [LOC Belgrade  ] , the 2004 protests over [MISC Japanese  ] textbooks , and more recently the anti-France diatribes that followed the roughing-up of a disabled [MISC Olympic  ] torch bearer in [LOC Paris  ] by [ORG Free Tibet  ] supporters , this nationalism can also lead to jingoism . 
[MISC Chinese  ] leaders of a system with few outlets to express political sentiments are faced with trying to give vent to the occasional uprising of nationalistic anger without letting it get out of hand or allowing it to focus on the failings of the central leadership. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) With notable exceptions like [PER Zhou Enlai  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] foreign policy practitioners thirty years ago had little practical experience dealing with the [LOC West  ] . 
Since then , [MISC Chinese  ] diplomats and subject matter experts are increasingly well-educated , well-traveled and well-respected . 
[MISC Chinese  ] diplomats at international fora such as the [ORG UN  ] and the [ORG WTO  ] have become adept at using procedural rules to attain diplomatic or commercial ends . 
This trend will likely continue in the coming decades , increasing the likelihood of [MISC American  ] decision makers finding more able adversaries when we disagree on issues , but also more able partners where we can agree to jointly tackle a problem of mutual concern such as nonproliferation , alternative energy or pandemic influenza. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) While still reluctant to claim [LOC China  ] is a global leader , [MISC Chinese  ] officials are gradually gaining confidence as a regional power . 
By the end of the next 30 years , [LOC China  ] should no longer be able to portray itself as the representative of lesser developed countries . 
This does not mean that it will necessarily identify with the more developed , mainly [MISC Western  ] countries ; it well might choose to pursue some uniquely [MISC Chinese  ] path . 
In the coming 30 years , a [LOC U.S.  ] President might be involved in negotiations with a [MISC Chinese  ] leader seeking to reshape global financial institutions like the [ORG IMF  ] or the [ORG WTO  ] or establish rival institutions for non-Western countries in order to mitigate domestic [MISC Chinese  ] concerns . 
Even so , [MISC China’s  ] growing position as a nation increasingly distinct from the less-developed world may expand our common interests and make it easier for the [LOC United States  ] to convince [LOC China  ] to act like a responsible global stakeholder. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Foreign assistance coordination is another area of opportunity . 
[LOC China  ] is rapidly ramping up its global economic presence , not only via resource extraction ventures and cheap exports , but increasingly via direct investment and assistance . 
This investment and assistance are welcome in most less-developed countries , whether in [LOC Africa  ] or [LOC Southeast Asia  ] , and particularly in countries where [MISC China’s  ] longstanding policy of “no strings attached no political interference” appeals to democratically-challenged dictators [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000022 005 OF 007 and kleptocrats . 
However , [LOC China  ] is already facing blowback as a result of its more cavalier approach to issues that more scrupulous donors have wrestled with for decades . 
Scant attention paid to worker safety , job opportunities for local people , environmental protection , and political legitimacy has had negative consequences for [LOC China  ] on multiple occasions , from a tarnished international image and being used as a political whipping boy by opposition groups in democratic countries to unpaid loans , expropriated investments , and even the deaths of [MISC Chinese  ] expatriates . 
As a result , [LOC China  ] is beginning to understand the merits of international assistance standards not for altruistic reasons , but for achieving [MISC China’s  ] own bottom-line imperatives of a more secure international position and better-protected economic interests in third countries . 
This realization , coupled with [MISC China’s  ] growing economic clout on the world stage , make it quite possible that , in the next 30 years , [LOC China  ] will come to be identified by the average citizen in less developed countries not as “one of us” but as “one of them.” <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) In all likelihood , a new-found ( if still somewhat grudging ) [ORG PRC  ] interest in internationally accepted donor principles such as transparency , good governance , environmental and labor protections , and corporate social responsibility will have matured in 30 years’ time , making [LOC China  ] a reliable partner for the [LOC United States  ] , other donor countries , and international organizations in alleviating poverty , developing infrastructure , improving education and fighting infectious disease . 
And as one of the world’s premier economic powers , [LOC China  ] can be expected to have all but discarded its over-worn and outdated “non-interference” rhetoric in the face of massive [MISC Chinese  ] investment assets and other economic interests abroad. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) As evidenced by [MISC Chinese  ] policies toward pariah states like [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , [LOC Burma  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC China  ] is still willing to put its need for markets and raw materials above the need to promote internationally accepted norms of behavior . 
However , the possible secession of southern [LOC Sudan  ] ( where much of the country’s oil is found ) from the repressive [MISC Khartoum-based  ] Bashir regime , the erratic treatment of foreign economic interests in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] by [PER Robert Mugabe  ] , the dangers to regional safety and stability posed by [MISC Burma’s  ] dysfunctional military junta , and the threat to [MISC China’s  ] energy security that a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] would represent have given [LOC Beijing  ] cause to re-calibrate its previously uncritical stance toward these international outlaws . 
If [MISC China’s  ] integration into global economic and security structures continues apace , we would expect its tolerance for these sorts of disruptive players to decrease proportionately. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) [MISC China’s  ] work in the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] and the [ORG Shanghai Cooperative Organization  ] may provide guidance as to how to accelerate this trend . 
[LOC China  ] plays a leading and often responsible and constructive role in both of these multilateral groups . 
Future [LOC U.S.  ] policy-makers might usefully consider additional international mechanisms that include both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] membership such as the proposed [ORG Northeast Asia Peace and Security Mechanism  ] that may grow out of the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] themselves have suggested a [MISC Six-Party Talks-like  ] grouping to address the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue , perhaps a [MISC P5-plus-1-plus-Iran  ] . 
In the future , we may wish to consider the [LOC United States  ] joining the [ORG East Asia Summit  ] ( EAS ) . <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) Likewise , as the [MISC Chinese  ] economy takes up a larger portion of the global economy , it inevitably will become increasingly affected by the decisions of international economic and financial institutions . 
Similarly , [MISC China’s  ] economic decisions will have global implications , and its cooperation will become essential to solving global-scale problems . 
Drawing [LOC China  ] constructively into regional and global economic and environmental dialogues and institutions will be essential . 
More and more experts see the utility of establishing an [MISC Asia-Pacific  ] G-8 , to include [LOC China  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] plus [LOC India  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC Indonesia  ] , [LOC South Korea  ] and [LOC Russia  ] ; others say the time is ripe to include [LOC China  ] as a member of a [MISC G-9  ] . 
Giving [LOC China  ] a greater voice is seen as a way to encourage [LOC China  ] to assume a larger burden in [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000022 006 OF 007 supporting the international economic and financial system . 
Role of the Military -------------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) The disparate possibilities exist that in the coming decades the [ORG PLA  ] will evolve into a major competitor , maintain only a regional presence or become a partner capable of joining us and others to address peacekeeping , peace-enforcing , humanitarian relief and disaster mitigation roles around the world . 
[LOC China  ] may be content to remain only a regional power , but [PER Deng Xiaoping’s  ] maxim urging [LOC China  ] to hide its capabilities while biding its time should caution us against predicting that the PLA’s long-term objectives are modest . 
In the years to come , our defense experts will need to closely monitor [MISC China’s  ] contingency plans and we will need to use every diplomatic and strategic tool we have to prevent intimidating moves toward [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
In the coming years , [MISC Chinese  ] defense capabilities will continue to improve . 
The [ORG PLA  ] thirty years from today will likely have sophisticated anti-satellite weapons , state-of-the-art aircraft , aircraft carriers and an ability to project force into strategic sea lanes. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) Thirty years ago the [ORG PLA  ] was a bloated political organization with antiquated equipment and tactics . 
Today , the [ORG PLA  ] is leaner and is becoming a modern force . 
[MISC Chinese  ] military and paramilitary units have participated in [MISC UN-sponsored  ] peacekeeping missions in [LOC East Timor  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
In December 2008 , for the first time , the [ORG PLA  ] Navy deployed beyond the immediate waters surrounding the country to participate in anything beyond a goodwill tour to combat piracy off the [LOC Horn of Africa  ] . 
It is likely that [LOC China  ] will continue to support [MISC UN-sponsored  ] PKOs , and if the piracy expedition is successful , [LOC China  ] might follow up with expeditions to future piracy hotspots such as the [ORG Strait of Malacca  ] or elsewhere. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) Over the past thirty years , [MISC Chinese  ] officials have come to begrudgingly acknowledge the benefits to [LOC East Asia  ] resulting from the [LOC U.S.  ] military presence in the [LOC Pacific  ] , especially the extent that a [LOC U.S.  ] presence in the [LOC Pacific  ] is an alternative to a more robust [MISC Japanese  ] military presence . 
A peaceful resolution of the threat posed by [LOC North Korea  ] might cause [LOC China  ] to call for an end to the [LOC U.S.  ] base presence on the [ORG Korean Peninsula  ] . 
Perceived threats to [MISC China’s  ] security posed by [MISC Japan’s  ] participation in missile defense or by future high-tech [LOC U.S.  ] military technologies might cause tomorrow’s [MISC Chinese  ] leaders to change their assessment and to exert economic pressures on [LOC U.S.  ] allies like [LOC Thailand  ] or the [LOC Philippines  ] to choose between [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) Whatever the state of our future relations with [LOC China  ] , we will need to understand more about the [MISC Chinese  ] military . 
Multilateral training and exercises are constructive ways to promote understanding and develop joint capabilities that could be used in real-life situations . 
In the coming years , the [MISC Chinese  ] may be called upon to participate in regional peacekeeping and humanitarian relief exercises . 
Some of these could be handled under [ORG UN  ] auspices , but others could be bilateral or multilateral . 
For instance , [PER Cobra Gold  ] , which is held every year in [LOC Thailand  ] , is [MISC America’s  ] foremost military exercise in [LOC Asia  ] . 
It has a peacekeeping component and since the December 2004 tsunami in [LOC Indian Ocean  ] has included a humanitarian relief element . 
With proper buy-in by the [ORG Pentagon  ] and [ORG PACOM  ] , we could create a program to engage the [ORG PLA  ] more directly both with our military and with friendly militaries in the region . 
Modest efforts at expanding search and rescue capabilities on the high seas , developing common forensic techniques for use in mass casualty events , conducting exercises with [ORG PLA  ] units tasked with responding to civil nuclear emergencies , or table-top exercises for [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] junior officers could be steps that promote trust with little risk . 
At the same time , more frequent , regularly scheduled high-level reciprocal visits between [MISC Chinese  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] security officials might eventually lead to a constructive strategic security policy dialogue on nonproliferation , counterterrorism and other issues . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00000022 007 OF 007 [LOC Taiwan  ] and [ORG Human Rights  ] ------------------------ <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) [LOC Taiwan  ] was the most vexing issue holding up the establishment of relations 30 years ago and remains the toughest issue for [MISC U.S.-China  ] relations despite significant improvement in cross-Strait relations since the election of [LOC Taiwan  ] President [LOC Ma  ] . 
It will remain a delicate topic for the foreseeable future . 
We should continue to support [LOC Taiwan  ] and [LOC Mainland  ] efforts to reduce tension by increasing Taiwan’s “international space” and reducing the [MISC Mainland’s  ] military build-up across from [LOC Taiwan.  ] <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) Thirty years ago , the [MISC Chinese  ] state interfered in virtually every aspect of its citizens’ lives . 
An individual’s work unit provided housing , education , medical care and a burial plot . 
Reeducation sessions and thought reform were common , churches and temples were closed , and average citizens had little access to the outside world . 
Today , [MISC Chinese  ] have far greater ability to travel , read foreign media and worship . 
Nonetheless , the overall human rights situation falls well short of international norms . 
Today , [MISC China’s  ] growing cadre of well-educated urbanites generally avoids politics and seems more interested in fashion and consumerism than in ideology ; after all , outside-the-box political thinking , much less activism , remains dangerous . 
However , any number of factors in the future ranging from rising unemployment among recent college graduates , or growing discontent over the income divide separating rich urbanites from poor peasants , to discontent among the mass of migrant workers could lead to unrest and increased political activism . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Government still responds with brutal force to any social , religious , political or ideological movement it perceives as a potential threat . 
[MISC Chinese  ] political leaders’ occasional nods toward the need for political reform and increased democracy suggest a realization that the current one-party authoritarianism has its weak points , but do not promise sufficient relaxation of party control to create a more dynamically stable polity in the long term. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( C ) While the [LOC U.S.  ] model of democracy is not the only example of a tolerant open society , we should continue to push for the expansion of individual freedoms , respect for the rule of law and the establishment of a truly free and independent judiciary and press as being necessities for a thriving , modern society and , as such , in [MISC China’s  ] own interests . 
Someday , [LOC China  ] will realize political reform . 
When that day comes , we will want to be remembered by [MISC Chinese  ] for having helped [LOC China  ] to advance .
