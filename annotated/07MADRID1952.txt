( [ORG SBU  ] ) On October 9 , [ORG Foreign Ministry Deputy Director  ] for [ORG North American Affairs Fernando Prieto  ] presented a nonpaper to desk officer [PER Elaine Samson  ] and EconOff reinforcing the [MISC GOS'  ] desire to obtain broader access to the [ORG Odyssey  ] import documents into the [LOC U.S.  ] and requesting that the [LOC U.S.  ] conduct an investigation of potential violations of [LOC U.S.  ] law on the part of [ORG Odyssey Marine Exploration  ] company. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The text of the message , which was presented in [MISC English  ] , is as follows: Further to the meetings of 27 September 2007 and 3rd October 2007 with Mr. [PER Bellinger  ] , [ORG Legal Advisor  ] , [ORG U.S. Department of State  ] , here is a reply to the points raised by him on the two [MISC Spanish  ] requests included in the [ORG Non Paper  ] dated 24th September 2007 . 
Request A: That the documents presented by [ORG Odyssey Marine Exploration  ] ( [ORG OME  ] ) for entry into the [LOC U.S.  ] of certain archaeological goods be released for confidential use. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
Release of the documents is requested for confidential use in investigation of potential violations of SIPDIS application [ORG U.S. Customs  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] laws concerning the extraction and shipment of these goods , and in judicial proceedings that may arise from enforcement of the relevant [LOC United States  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] Laws. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Additionally , there is reason to believe that the materials imported by [ORG OME  ] are property of the [MISC Kingdom of Spain  ] taken from the sea and imported to the [LOC U.S.  ] in violation of [MISC Spanish  ] law . 
The importation of these materials may accordingly be subject to [ORG U.S. Customs  ] laws as materials imported contrary to relevant [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] law concerning the protection of national property , military property and historical/cultural heritage . 
In particular , available information indicates that the documents contain specific information with respect to the location from which the materials were taken and identification of the nationality and the dates of coins and other artifacts . 
This information is believed to provide confirmation that the materials in question were taken from a warship of the [ORG Royal Navy of Spain  ] that sank in battle during the early 19th Century and are property of the [ORG Royal Treasury  ] of the [MISC Kingdom of Spain  ] that was being transported by this vessel in service of the [LOC Kingdom Spain  ] . 
Release of the requested documents is necessary to investigate the application of such laws and to assist [ORG U.S. Customs  ] and such other competent [LOC U.S.  ] agencies as may be authorized to have access to the documents for purposes of potential enforcement proceedings. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The agencies of the Government of [LOC Spain  ] that have competence in the investigation of this matter and/or in judicial enforcement proceedings , and to which the documents would therefore be made available: [ORG Spanish Customs  ] , [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation , Ministry of Culture , Ministry of Justice  ] , [ORG Spanish Navy  ] . 
It is understood that the documents shall be held in confidence by authorized representatives of the competent [MISC Spanish  ] agencies and used only for investigation and/or enforcement proceedings in [LOC Spain  ] and/or the [LOC U.S.  ] Request B: That the possible violation by [ORG OME  ] of [LOC U.S.  ] customs or other rules be fully investigated and prosecuted by [LOC U.S.  ] authorities. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
[ORG U.S. Customs  ] laws [ORG OME  ] might have violated: 18 [ORG U.S.C. Section  ] 542 which prohibits the importation of materials by means of false statements ; 18 [ORG U.S.C Section  ] 545 , which prohibits the importation of goods to the [LOC U.S.  ] in violation of any law ( which may include [MISC Spanish  ] law ) ; and 19 [ORG U.S.C. Section  ] 1595a , which provides for seizure and forfeiture of goods imported in violation of relevant laws. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
The available information indicates that the importation of these materials may have occurred by means of false and/or misleading statements concerning the country of origin , ownership , value , legal status , and/or other characteristics of the imported materials . 
Additionally , as noted above , to the extent that specific information as to the location and identifying characteristics of the materials was provided in the documents , it is believed to constitute evidence of the taking and shipment to the [LOC U.S.  ] of national property of [LOC Spain  ] in violation of [MISC Spanish  ] law concerning such property and corresponding [LOC U.S.  ] laws concerning the importation of such property. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Should additional information concerning this matter be needed at this stage , it would be provided on request on a [LOC MADRID  ] 00001952 002.2 OF 002 confidential basis . 
An investigative dossier is currently SIPDIS being assembled concerning the available evidence , for which the requested documents are needed , and will be made available to the [ORG U.S. Customs  ] , the [ORG Department of State  ] and such other [LOC U.S.  ] agencies as may be deemed appropriate by the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC LLORENS</pre></code>  ]
