REASON: 1.4 ( D ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) At a June 26 lunch with poloff and econoff , businessman and lobbyist [PER Mohamad Ali Laila  ] ( protect ) shared his views on President [PER Lula  ] , the [ORG PT  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , s relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] , and the [MISC Lebanese  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] communities in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[PER Laila  ] , who is President [PER Lula  ] , s neighbor in [LOC Sao Bernardo  ] do [LOC Campo  ] and has known the president and his family well for many years , said that [PER Lula  ] , s oldest brother [PER Genival  ] ( &Vava8 ) , recently accused by the [ORG Federal Police  ] of influence peddling , is a &donkey8 who got mixed up in things he didn , t understand , a view apparently shared by [PER Lula  ] himself . 
[PER Laila  ] suggested that [PER Lula  ] , s generally acquiescent attitude towards [PER Hugo Chavez  ] is based more on personal friendship than ideological kinship and is emblematic of [PER Lula  ] , s &live and let live8 philosophy towards other leaders . 
[PER Laila  ] does not believe there is much sympathy for [PER Chavez  ] among [MISC Brazilians  ] . 
He said that [PER Lula  ] , s [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) has no viable candidate to succeed him in 2010 , and predicted that [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] will soon switch from the opposition [ORG PSDB  ] to the pro-government [ORG PMDB  ] and run for President with [PER Lula  ] , s support , though others discount this possibility . 
[PER Laila  ] has prepared a &note of protest , 8 signed by [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Christian  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] leaders , over the recent cooperation agreement between the [ORG PT  ] and the [ORG Baath Party  ] ( ref A ) , which he plans to present to [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG PT  ] , s [ORG National Directorate  ] . 
[PER Laila  ] said many [MISC Brazilian-Lebanese  ] avoid all interaction with [MISC Syrian  ] representatives and officials here , and he expressed concern about activities of the [MISC Shiite  ] community in the tri-border area . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mohamad Laila  ] ( please protect ) is a Vice-President of the [LOC Brazil  ] Future Institute , a [MISC Brazilian-Lebanese  ] organization composed of moderate [PER Sunni Muslims  ] representing the interests of the late Prime Minister [PER Rafik Hariri  ] , s family and political organization in [LOC Brazil  ] ( ref C ) . 
He is also a partner in [LOC Braven  ] , an import-export company that specializes in trade with [LOC Venezuela  ] , and in [LOC Newbrasil Assessoria  ] , a political and commercial consulting firm . 
He joked that he doesn , t call himself a lobbyist &because lobbying is illegal in [LOC Brazil  ] , 8 but intimated that he is active in advocating on behalf of clients doing business with the GoB , playing on his personal connection to [PER Lula  ] and his long association with the [ORG PT  ] . 
( Comment: Lobbying is not illegal in [LOC Brazil  ] , but there is a widespread public perception , encouraged by the media , that all lobbyists are crooks . 
[MISC Brazilians  ] cannot bring themselves to believe that government officials make decisions based on merit , and thus assume that lobbyists , success on behalf of their clients depends on their skill in making payoffs . 
For this reason , many individuals and firms use &consulting8 or &advising8 as a euphemism for their lobbying activities .

) ----------------------- [PER LULA  ] AND THE SUCCESSION ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Laila  ] did not specify his exact role in the [ORG PT  ] , noting at one point that he is &affiliated8 with the party while at the same time taking issue with many of the party , s positions , especially the ones he considers radical or leftist . 
He is clearly not a fan of the social and popular movements that make up an important part of the [ORG PT  ] , s base . 
However , he is evidently on friendly terms with a great many party leaders . 
He predicted that [PER Ricardo Berzoini  ] will be [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000601 002 OF 004 re-elected [ORG PT  ] President in internal elections later this year . 
[PER Jose Dirceu  ] , he said , still retains influence in the party , but not as much as he would like . 
Because the [ORG PT  ] , in [PER Laila  ] , s view , has no viable candidate to aspire to be [PER Lula  ] , s successor ) he said nobody wants Tourism Minister [PER Marta Suplicy  ] , and that there is no one else of sufficient stature ) [PER Lula  ] will look outside the party to someone from his governing alliance . 
He predicted with some confidence that [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] will switch from the opposition [MISC Brazilian  ] Social [ORG Democracy Party  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) to the centrist , pro-government [ORG PMDB  ] and will then receive [PER Lula  ] , s blessing for his presidential bid. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ( [ORG Note:  ] the expectation that [PER Neves  ] will desert the [ORG PSDB  ] is a favorite media theory , but one that may have little basis in reality , and it is early to make such a prediction with any seriousness . 
[ORG PSDB  ] Senator [PER Sergio Guerra  ] of [LOC Pernambuco  ] , the likely next president of the [ORG PSDB  ] , absolutely dismissed the possibility of a [PER Neves  ] defection in a conversation with [LOC Brasilia  ] poloff in late May . 
[PER Guerra  ] , a manager of [PER Geraldo Alckmin  ] , s 2006 presidential campaign , is a " neutral " in the PSDB: he is not identified with any faction in a party that is somewhat divided between " nevistas " and " serristas , " that is , supporters of [PER Neves  ] and [ORG Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] .

) -------------------- [PER LULA  ] AND HIS BROTHER -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Laila  ] disparaged [PER Lula  ] , s oldest brother , [PER Genival Inacio  ] da [PER Silva  ] ( &Vava8 ) , who was recently caught up in the [ORG Federal Police  ] , s &Operation Checkmate8 investigation into illegal slot machine operators and accused of influence peddling . 
[PER Vava  ] was allegedly trying to obtain favors or special consideration from GoB officials for friends in the gaming industry in return for cash . 
[PER Laila  ] commented that [PER Vava  ] is a &donkey8 who got involved in something he didn , t understand . 
He expressed no opinion as to whether [PER Vava  ] or [PER Lula  ] , s friend [PER Dario Morelli Filho  ] , who was implicated in the same activity , had done anything illegal or not . 
However , he noted that while [PER Lula  ] is not against bingo parlors , he does oppose slot machines on the grounds that poor people get addicted to them , and he believes that the gaming industry is used to launder money. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Laila  ] opined that Justice Minister [PER Tarso Genro  ] should have been able to deal with [PER Vava  ] , s problem in a way that would have avoided his detention and the embarrassing publicity surrounding it . 
For this reason , he said , [PER Lula  ] is now irritated with [PER Genro  ] and may replace him soon . 
[PER Laila  ] also predicted that [ORG Federal Police  ] Chief [PER Paulo Lacerda  ] will soon be replaced . 
( Comment: [PER Tarso Genro  ] is unpopular with many of his [ORG PT  ] colleagues , who consider him divisive , and [PER Lula  ] could gain points within the party by replacing him , if indeed he is disenchanted with [PER Genro  ] , s performance . 
However , he might have a harder time getting rid of [PER Lacerda  ] , given that he has cited the [ORG Federal Police  ] , s energetic investigations as a sign of his government , s effectiveness in fighting endemic corruption . 
End Comment . 
) --------------- [PER LULA  ] AND [PER CHAVEZ  ] --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Laila  ] , s company does a great deal of trade with [LOC Venezuela  ] and he apparently knows [PER Hugo Chavez  ] well . 
He has a picture in his office of himself with both [PER Lula  ] and [PER Chavez  ] and he talks about [PER Chavez  ] with familiarity , albeit not in a complimentary vein . 
He believes [PER Lula  ] , s posture towards [PER Chavez  ] is motivated largely by personal friendship . 
[PER Lula  ] does not share [PER Chavez  ] , s radical or populist ideology ) he resorts sometimes to populist rhetoric but has governed as a pragmatic centrist ) but he takes a &live and let live8 approach to leaders of other countries and expects others to [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000601 003 OF 004 do the same . 
Only when he thinks [PER Chavez  ] is directly threatening [LOC Brazil  ] , s interests will he push back , as for example with [PER Chavez  ] , s efforts to organize opposition to biofuels . 
Similarly , when [PER Chavez  ] denounced [LOC Brazil  ] , s [ORG Congress  ] after its [ORG Senate  ] passed a resolution asking the [ORG BRV  ] to reconsider its decision concerning [ORG RCTV  ] ( ref B ) , [PER Lula  ] calmed the waters by defending [MISC Brazilian  ] institutions while at the same time defending the [ORG BRV  ] , s right not to renew the broadcaster , s concession . 
[PER Laila  ] said that [PER Lula  ] , as a friend of both [PER Chavez  ] and President [PER Bush  ] , wanted to broker a truce or understanding between the two , but made no headway because [PER Chavez  ] just isn , t interested . 
Another important factor in the GoB , s reluctance to criticize the [ORG BRV  ] and its continuing support for [LOC Venezuela  ] in international fora is the influence of [PER Lula  ] , s foreign affairs advisor , [ORG PT  ] first Vice-President [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , who is personally and ideologically close to [ORG Chavez.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Laila  ] does not see any efforts under way to develop a [MISC Bolivarian  ] movement in [LOC Brazil  ] , nor any prospects for such activity . 
The ground is simply not fertile ; most [MISC Brazilians  ] are either actively opposed to [PER Chavez  ] , s &Bolivarian8 program or just not interested . 
The only [MISC Brazilians  ] who admire and follow [PER Chavez  ] , in his view , are the militants of the [ORG Landless Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) . --------------------- [PER LULA  ] AND THE [MISC LEBANESE  ] --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Lebanese  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] communities , [PER Laila  ] said , have a variety of perspectives on [MISC Brazilian  ] politics . 
No one political party or tendency enjoys their support . 
There are a few , though not many , who support the [ORG PT  ] . 
However , [PER Lula  ] has long been popular in the communities , and their support for him was enhanced by the GoB , s energetic assistance during the July-August 2006 [ORG Hizballah  ] conflict , when it facilitated delivery of emergency supplies , helped evacuate vacationing [MISC Lebanese-Brazilians  ] who were caught up in the violence , and admitted some [MISC Lebanese  ] with [MISC Brazilian  ] family ties with few questions asked. ------------------ [ORG PT  ] AND [ORG BAATH PARTY  ] ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Laila  ] brought up the recent visit to [LOC Syria  ] by two [ORG PT  ] leaders and the signing of a friendship accord between the [ORG PT  ] and the [ORG Baath Party  ] ( ref A ) . 
He gave Poloff a copy of a protest letter he had prepared . 
Leaders of the [LOC Brazil  ] Future Institute , the [ORG Islamic Federation of Brazil  ] , and the [ORG Maronite League of Brazil  ] have signed it , and he is seeking more signatures . 
The letter contrasts the democratic history of the [ORG PT  ] with the [MISC Syrian  ] dictatorship and highlights the human rights violations perpetrated by the [ORG Baath Party  ] in [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It also accuses the Baath-led [MISC Syrian  ] government of trying to destroy [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Laila  ] plans to deliver the letter to the [ORG PT  ] , s [ORG National Directorate  ] and to President [PER Lula  ] in the hope of dissolving the agreement , which he blamed on the [ORG PT  ] , s International Relations Secretary , [PER Valter Pomar  ] , who leads one of the [ORG PT  ] , s small leftist factions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The continued instability in [LOC Lebanon  ] is having a terrible effect on the economy , which depends heavily on tourism , [PER Laila  ] said . 
He blamed all the recent violence on [LOC Syria  ] and especially [LOC Iran  ] for funding [ORG Hizballah  ] and other terrorist groups . 
Most of the [PER Sunni Muslim  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] Christian communities in [LOC Brazil  ] , he said , avoid interaction with [MISC Syrian  ] government representatives and boycott official [MISC Syrian  ] events . 
[PER Laila  ] also said that when a Hizballah-affiliated [MISC Lebanese  ] former Labor Minister visited [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and [LOC Curitiba  ] , large segments of these communities boycotted the visit . 
[PER Laila  ] , who accompanied President [PER Lula  ] on his December 2003 visit to [LOC Syria  ] , doubts that President [PER Assad  ] will visit [LOC Brazil  ] , and said that if he does , the [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000601 004 OF 004 [MISC Lebanese  ] community here will use the occasion to denounce [MISC Syrian  ] human rights violations and continued interference in [MISC Lebanese  ] affairs. ----------------------- TRI-BORDER AREA CONCERN ----------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The Future Institute has opened a small chapter in [LOC Foz  ] de [LOC Iguacu  ] in the [LOC Tri-Border Area  ] , [PER Laila  ] said , and hopes to expand its presence there . 
The [MISC Sunnis  ] in [LOC Foz  ] , he said , have been receptive to the Institute , s efforts to instill moderation and mutual tolerance , but the [MISC Shiite  ] community has been less so . 
[PER Laila  ] estimated that about 80 percent of [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Foz  ] are [PER Sunni  ] and 20 percent [MISC Shiite  ] , but the numbers are reversed in [LOC Ciudad del Este  ] across the river in [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
The situation in the tri-border is serious , he said , and much work is needed to stop the [ORG Hizballah  ] funding going on there. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Comment: Post , s contacts in the [MISC Lebanese  ] community and in the [ORG PT  ] confirm that [PER Mohamad Laila  ] is well-connected in the party , a long-time friend of [PER Lula  ] , s , and extremely knowledgeable about [LOC Venezuela  ] and [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
That said , he no doubt has his own agenda and his own reasons for talking so freely with emboffs . 
Some of his comments arouse skepticism ) it appears doubtful , for instance , that [PER Lula  ] would be planning to dismiss his Justice Minister or Chief of Police ) but most of them are not only plausible but on track with what others are saying . 
Post will continue to reach out to members of the [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] communities in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] .
