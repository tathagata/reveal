[ORG REF: LONDON  ] 266 Classified By: Charge [PER Richard LeBaron  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Summary . 
Secretary Clinton’s public praise for the [MISC U.S.-UK  ] special relationship following her February 3 meeting with Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] , coming on the heels of the President’s January 26 phone call with Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] , has gone a long way to calm what has been a stronger than usual outbreak of [MISC British  ] political and media anxiety about the future of [MISC U.S.-UK  ] relations . 
The atmospherics surrounding the relationship with the [LOC United States  ] are always under intense scrutiny in [LOC Britain  ] , but [LOC UK  ] media , pundits , and parliamentarians have openly worried over the last several months that the [PER Obama  ] administration might downplay relations with the [ORG Brown Government  ] because of a “perfect storm” of factors -- the [LOC Brown Government’s  ] support for [PER Bush  ] administration foreign policies ; a [LOC UK  ] economy suffering the most severe financial downturn in [LOC Europe  ] ; a politically weak Prime Minister who must face voters in the next 15 months ; and growing [LOC U.S.  ] frustration with [LOC UK  ] military failings in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Fears about the end of the special relationship were further fueled by [MISC British  ] over-reading of the new [MISC Administration’s  ] initial statements . 
More than one HMG senior official asked embassy officers whether President [PER Obama  ] meant to send a signal in his inaugural address about [MISC U.S.-UK  ] relations by quoting [LOC Washington  ] during the [MISC Revolutionary War  ] , while the removal of the [ORG Churchill  ] bust from the [ORG Oval Office  ] consumed much [LOC UK  ] newsprint , typified by a [ORG London Times  ] story this week entitled , “Churchill Bust Casts a [MISC Shadow Over the Special Relationship.”  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Summary and comment con’t . 
[LOC Downing Street  ] and the most senior levels at [LOC Whitehall  ] never shared the level of anxiety over the future of the relationship that gripped the [MISC British  ] punditocracy , and now that high-level contacts across the [LOC Atlantic  ] are resuming , such as the visit of Special [PER Envoy Holbrooke  ] and Miliband’s meetings with Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] , any [LOC Whitehall  ] concerns about the relationship with [LOC Washington  ] will further dissipate . 
The issue still has traction as a subject for the [LOC UK  ] media and chattering class , however . 
Recent [LOC UK  ] media posturing over the [PER Binyam Mohamed  ] case ( a [LOC UK  ] resident in [LOC Guatanamo Bay  ] ) as a test of the [PER Obama  ] [MISC Administration’s  ] commitment to a “new approach” to fighting terrorism , as well as [MISC British  ] irritation about the original “buy [MISC American”  ] language in the [LOC U.S.  ] stimulus legislation , demonstrates that the [MISC British  ] public will be pressing to test the [MISC Administration’s  ] commitments and looking for signs of distance between [LOC London  ] and [LOC Washington  ] . 
Although this period of excessive [LOC UK  ] speculation about the relationship is more paranoid than usual , we agree with a senior [ORG MP  ] who told us that ultimately , “the people who really matter in all this , those who do the serious business , know that where it matters - over defense , security issues , intelligence-sharing - the relationship is deep , ongoing and abiding.” End summary . 
More Speculation than Usual --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Every [LOC U.S.  ] Presidential inauguration sets off debate at [MISC British  ] think tank seminars and on [LOC UK  ] editorial pages about the sustainability of the special relationship under a new [LOC U.S.  ] President . 
The debate this year , however , is louder than at any time since the fallout from the “passport-gate” affair sent shivers through the [LOC UK  ] chattering class about the relationship between newly-elected President [PER Clinton  ] and Prime Minister [PER John Major  ] in 1992 . 
Over the last several months much of the [MISC British  ] press predicted a weakening , if not the outright demise , of the “special relationship.” [PER Simon Tisdall  ] in the left-leaning [MISC Guardian  ] fretted that the “worrying question is whether President [PER Obama  ] believes there’s anything special about [LOC Britain  ] -- and it may all be a little less special than before.” The right-leaning [MISC Times  ] editorialized that “Gordon Brown’s phone is unlikely to be the one that rings ( when [LOC Washington  ] calls ) ... the new best friend in [LOC Washington  ] will be President [PER Sarkozy..who  ] has advertised his fondness of [LOC America  ] from his first day in office ( and is close to [PER Philip Gordon  ] , the new fluent French-speaking [LOC U.S.  ] Assistant Secretary of State for [LOC Europe  ] ) .” “He’s Just Not That [LOC Into Us”  ] --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) For many [LOC UK  ] pundits , a break in the special relationship will come because of the new [LOC U.S.  ] President’s personal history . 
Several commentators have explored President [PER Obama’s  ] life story to see what it might mean for [LOC LONDON  ] 00000348 002 OF 004 his approach to the [LOC UK  ] . 
His relative youth ( which gives him no historical experience of the [LOC WWII  ] and [MISC Cold War  ] alliance with [LOC London  ] ) , his formative years in the [LOC Pacific  ] rather than in [LOC Europe  ] , and his [MISC Kenyan  ] grandfather’s treatment at the hands of [MISC British  ] colonial forces in [LOC Kenya  ] ( where he was imprisoned ) have led many [LOC UK  ] commentators to conclude the new President has no “natural” link to the [LOC UK  ] , perhaps even an antipathy to the [LOC UK  ] , and this will weaken [MISC U.S.-UK  ] ties . 
The [MISC Times  ] correspondent in [LOC Washington  ] , summed up this view: “Mr . 
Obama...has no personal experience of our shared [MISC World War II  ] experiences and little of our [MISC Cold War  ] alliance . 
In his memoir , ‘Dreams from My Father , ’ he described his trips to drink ‘tea on the [MISC Thames’  ] before flying away from a [LOC Europe  ] that ‘just wasn’t mine’ to discuss his [MISC Kenyan  ] roots with [MISC British  ] passengers who displayed arrogant attitudes to the ‘Godforsaken countries of [MISC Africa.’ A Fearful UK Wonders What  ] It Brings to the [LOC Table  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) For more serious observers , however , and quite a few of the [MISC Embassy’s  ] official and parliamentary interlocutors , the reasons to worry about the future of the relationship are based on the [LOC UK  ] political and economic landscape that the new [ORG Administration  ] encounters as it takes office . 
As The [ORG Spectator  ] commented in an editorial this week , “a glimpse into the national psyche of [LOC Britain  ] in the winter of 2009...would find a [MISC British  ] public and leadership shaken by the extraordinarily difficult times , economic uncertainty and widespread hardship ahead.” That has clearly translated into [MISC British  ] fear that the [LOC UK  ] at this point in time has little to offer a new [ORG Administration  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[LOC UK  ] politicians and foreign policy commentators point to a “perfect storm” of factors now in play that may make the special relationship less special -- from the weakness of Prime Minister Brown’s own political standing and the crisis in the [LOC UK  ] economy , to fears that the [LOC U.S.  ] is frustrated with the [LOC UK  ] military’s perceived failures in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
There is also widespread suspicion that [LOC Washington  ] has become infatuated with [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] and his pro-American views. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Michael Fabricant  ] , a [MISC Tory  ] [ORG MP  ] and strong supporter of a close [LOC U.S.  ] alliance , summed up these fears when he told [PER Poloff  ] that the [MISC UK’s  ] economic situation reminds the [MISC British  ] that “Britain needs the [LOC U.S.  ] more than ever to work with us to get out of this , but I fear we seem more like [LOC Iceland  ] to ( the new administration ) right now than any other [MISC European  ] capital because our downturn is so bad and the [ORG Brown Government  ] so weak.” The economic downturn also means that the [LOC UK  ] may not be able to provide the financial resources -- be it for development or new peacekeeping operations ( ref ) -- that [LOC Washington  ] has often looked to [LOC London  ] to provide . 
This has sparked concern that the [LOC UK  ] will be viewed as less valuable an ally than it was when overflowing government coffers and a strong [MISC British  ] Pound allowed the [PER Blair  ] and [ORG Brown Governments  ] to lead the way in pledges of international aid and other support to global hot spots . 
And the economic weakness of the [MISC British  ] economy is matched by the domestic political weakness of the [ORG Brown Government  ] , which trails in the polls and must hold an election no later than May 2010 . 
The [LOC Chatham House Director  ] posed a question at a recent seminar that several interlocutors have also raised with embassy staff -- “do the political realities in [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC London  ] argue for the new [ORG Administration  ] building bridges to [PER Sarkozy  ] rather than relying on a weak [MISC British  ] government that may be out the door soon ? ” [LOC U.S.  ] Criticisms of [LOC UK  ] Military Sting As Well -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Also sparking concern on this side of the [LOC Atlantic  ] are perceived [LOC U.S.  ] criticisms of the value of the [LOC UK  ] military contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , especially at a time when the new [ORG Administration  ] will be looking for allies to contribute more in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Brooks Newmark  ] , a [MISC Tory  ] [ORG MP  ] who follows defense issues , told [PER Poloff  ] he fears an erosion in [LOC UK  ] public support for continued engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] because of the “criticism of our troops from [LOC U.S.  ] military commanders and others in [LOC Washington  ] , ” which [PER Newmark  ] believes will also drive a wedge between the [ORG Administration  ] and [LOC Downing Street  ] . 
This sensitivity over perceived [LOC U.S.  ] criticism of the value of the [LOC UK  ] military’s contributions reverberates in the [LOC UK  ] media , which frequently quotes unnamed [LOC U.S.  ] military officers’ dismissals of the [LOC UK  ] military’s performance in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
A leading [ORG Daily Telegraph  ] columnist wrote that President [PER Obama  ] will want the [LOC UK  ] to provide more troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] but that , “following Brown’s abandonment of his [MISC American  ] allies in [LOC Basra  ] , there is [LOC LONDON  ] 00000348 003 OF 004 a growing feeling ( in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , especially in the [ORG Pentagon  ] , that [LOC Britain  ] can’t be relied on” no matter how many additional troops it may offer . 
Looking for Signals and [ORG Reading Tea Leaves  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC British  ] media and contacts are busy over-reading perceived signals for evidence of tensions in the relationship . 
This over-reading would often be humorous , if it were not so corrosive . 
Much was made in the [MISC British  ] press -- and even by serious [ORG HMG  ] officials -- of the “fact” that the new President’s inauguration speech mentioned the [LOC UK  ] only in the context of the [MISC British  ] “enemy” harrying [PER George Washington’s  ] troops -- although some noted that was one more mention than the [LOC UK  ] got in candidate [PER Obama’s  ] 7000-word essay setting out his foreign policy intentions , which did not mention the [LOC UK  ] at all . 
And Secretary Clinton’s statement before the [ORG Senate Foreign Relations Committee  ] was similarly parsed and much was made of the fact that the [LOC UK  ] was fourth in a recitation of [LOC U.S.  ] allies ( and it was particularly painful to those [MISC British  ] tea readers that [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] were named first ) . 
Similarly , the fate of a bust of [ORG Churchill  ] in the [ORG Oval Office  ] during President Bush’s tenure has been closely monitored in the [LOC UK  ] media and by our [ORG HMG  ] contacts , very few of whom failed to a sinister meaning into the decision to remove the bust ( which was on loan to the [LOC White House  ] and removed for that reason ) . 
Even the press coverage of Foreign Secretary Miliband’s meeting with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , though positive , reflected the [MISC British  ] paranoia -- and close reading of any supposed tea leaves -- on the special relationship . 
The [MISC Guardian  ] , for example , told its readers that when a [LOC UK  ] leader visits [LOC Washington  ] , he or she must mention the special relationship “but [MISC American  ] leaders , anxious to avoid upsetting other allies , steer away from referring to ‘the’ special relationship and speak instead of ‘a’ special relationship , at least until.. . 
( Secretary [PER Clinton  ] ) showed her inexperience and in her final remarks , uttered the words ‘the special relationship’ at her press event with [PER David Miliband.”  ] Does [LOC Downing Street Share These  ] Concerns ? ----------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Downing Street  ] and senior levels in [LOC Whitehall  ] never shared this level of anxiety about the future of the relationship under an [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
The President’s January 26 phone call to Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] - in which the President told the Prime Minister he looked “forward to continuing and strengthening the special relationship” -- helped quell any concerns about London’s place in the hierarchy of [LOC U.S.  ] allies . 
The Prime Minister’s office made sure it was released to the [LOC UK  ] press that [ORG Brown  ] was the first [MISC European  ] leader to speak with the new President following his inauguration . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] officer at the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] told us that both the fact of the call and the “tone of the conversation” was reassuring and he downplayed any concern about the relationship , at least inside the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] . 
Similarly , Foreign Secretary Miliband’s February 3 meeting with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , which [LOC UK  ] media and [ORG Foreign Office  ] contacts all carefully noted was the [MISC Secretary’s  ] first meeting with a Foreign Minister , sparked positive coverage and appeared to reassure many [MISC British  ] observers --”Clinton Praises Special Relationship ; Miliband First to Meet New [LOC U.S.  ] Secretary of State” was typical of the headlines that followed the meeting. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Despite these clear signals from the new [ORG Administration  ] , the strength of the special relationship still has traction for the [LOC UK  ] media and political class . 
Some in the [LOC UK  ] used the [PER Binyam Mohamed  ] case this past week -- in which a [LOC UK  ] high court ruled against making [LOC U.S.  ] classified information available to [LOC UK  ] lawyers representing a [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detainee -- as a test of the [ORG Obama Administration’s  ] commitment to a “new approach” to fighting terrorism and to the special relationship , with a leading [MISC Tory  ] politician charging , for example , that “denying evidence to a [LOC UK  ] court of law ( in this case ) raises doubts about the existence of the so-called special relationship with Washington.” [MISC British  ] irritation with the original “buy [MISC American”  ] language in the [LOC U.S.  ] stimulus legislation -- which the [LOC UK  ] media spun as a test of the [ORG Obama Administration’s  ] commitment to free trade agreements with its [MISC European  ] allies -- is also an example of how elements in [LOC Britain  ] still look for signs of distance between [LOC London  ] and [LOC Washington  ] . 
There is also still a palpable concern among our parliamentary and [MISC FCO  ] contacts that , although there are many areas where the [LOC Brown Government’s  ] priorities track [LOC U.S.  ] policies under the new [ORG Administration  ] , the high expectations in [LOC Britain  ] about a new [LOC LONDON  ] 00000348 004 OF 004 golden age of bilateral cooperation are themselves a potential threat to the relationship . 
[PER John Spellar  ] , a senior [ORG Labour MP  ] and government whip , summed this up: “At the moment , there’s unrealistic euphoria towards the new President...MPs are forgetting that , ultimately , Presidents have to behave in a certain way . 
Some of us are destined to be disappointed by him , policy-wise...On the other hand , the people who really matter in all this , those who do the serious business , know that where it matters - over defense , security issues , intelligence-sharing - the relationship is deep , ongoing and abiding.” [MISC Comment: Those Who Know  ] the Relationship Know Its Strength --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) Though tempting to argue that keeping [ORG HMG  ] off balance about its current standing with us might make [LOC London  ] more willing to respond favorably when pressed for assistance , in the long run it is not in [LOC U.S.  ] interests to have the [LOC UK  ] public concluding the relationship is weakening , on either side . 
The [MISC UK’s  ] commitment of resources -- financial , military , diplomatic -- in support of [LOC U.S  ] global priorities remains unparalleled ; a [LOC UK  ] public confident that the USG values those contributions and our relationship matters to [LOC U.S.  ] national security . 
This is a theme Embassy [LOC London  ] stresses privately and publicly to reassure the public and [ORG HMG  ] . 
As new [ORG Administration  ] officials begin their working relationships with [LOC UK  ] counterparts , and introduce themselves to the [LOC UK  ] public through media and conference events , it is a theme we recommend they highlight as well .
