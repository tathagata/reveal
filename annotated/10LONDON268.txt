( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] Although people of [MISC Muslim  ] faith make up only 3-4 percent of the [LOC UK  ] 's population , outreach to this key audience is vital to [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy interests in the [LOC UK  ] and beyond . 
Embassy [LOC London  ] [MISC Muslim  ] engagement activities comprise a counter-radicalization strategic plan , public diplomacy programming , and Ambassadorial outreach to address diverse audiences of varied national origin . 
This is a top Mission priority . 
End summary . 
Countering Radicalization -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG Embassy  ] , s counter-radicalization multi-agency working group , established in 2007 to improve our understanding of [MISC Muslim  ] communities , the radicalization process , and [ORG HMG  ] counter-radicalization efforts , developed a strategic action plan in 2009 . 
This plan , regularly updated , outlines counter-radicalization goals and concrete steps the [ORG Embassy  ] will take to encourage [MISC Muslim  ] communities to reject violent ideologies and recruitment by extremists . 
The plan is consistent with overall [ORG USG  ] plans to counter violent extremism , but considers the particular context of radicalization in the [LOC UK.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Embassy  ] plan integrates efforts and resources across sections and agencies to ensure a coherent strategy . 
It outlines key objectives necessary to the Administration , s vision of community engagement to prevent violent extremism . 
Programs are shaped to fit particular neighborhood needs and dynamics , recognizing that the diversity of [MISC Muslim  ] communities precludes a monolithic set of responses . 
Focus is on the most at-risk [MISC Muslim  ] populations and youths , targeting engagement and community capacity-building to counter violent extremism . 
Mission efforts incorporate a close working relationship with [LOC UK  ] agencies working on the same set of issues . 
4 ) ( C ) Our objectives: A ) Empowering [MISC Muslim  ] communities to mobilize against extremism . 
Although communities frequently reject violent extremism , they lack the institutional infrastructure to actively mobilize against radicalizing influences . 
B ) Empowering [MISC Muslim  ] communities to build community resilience . 
[ORG Civil society  ] and grassroots organizations can help channel grievances , providing institutions for community-based solutions and for engaging government and other communities . 
C ) Encouraging community cohesion , respect for pluralism , and integration across ethnic and religious groups . 
Insular communities tend to be more vulnerable to radicalization , as demonstrated by statistical analysis of survey research and comparative studies of [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
D ) Increasing [MISC Muslim  ] communities , understanding of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy in [MISC Muslim  ] countries and counter-terrorism objectives ; countering the view that the [LOC West  ] is at war with [MISC Islam  ] . 
E ) Encouraging [MISC Muslim  ] communities , positive and effective relations with the [ORG Embassy  ] , fundamental to the success of our engagement programs . 
5 ) ( C ) We are currently building a network of [MISC Muslim  ] civic activists to enhance the collective skills of individuals and groups involved in counter-radicalization and to encourage collaborative initiatives . 
The network will include different kinds of activists * youth workers , civil rights organizations , business entrepreneurs , interfaith workers , and former extremists , and others * who share an interest in counter-radicalization but frequently operate in different spheres of activity , limiting opportunities to learn from one another , share expertise and resources , and collaborate . 
Public Diplomacy ---------------- 6 ) ( C ) The [ORG Counter-radicalization Strategic Plan  ] complements and in most cases includes [ORG PD  ] programs , outreach , and broad base of [MISC Muslim  ] contacts . 
We use the full range of [ORG PD  ] tools at our disposal to influence [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslim  ] perceptions of the [LOC U.S.  ] , to counter violence and ideological extremism , and to empower credible [MISC Muslim  ] voices . 
Our programs focus on [MISC Muslim  ] youth and women and potential multipliers such as youth leaders , youth program directors , mosques , and schools . 
Through interfaith dialogue , the arts , exchanges , and [MISC Muslim  ] media , we have a broad base of [MISC Muslim  ] contacts who view the [ORG Embassy  ] as a reliable and supportive partner . 
Outreach beyond [LOC London  ] is a priority . 
Areas of emphasis include interfaith dialogue the arts , and exchanges and outreach . 
7 ) ( C ) Interfaith dialogue: Our joint programs with the [MISC Chicago-based  ] Interfaith Youth Core ( [ORG IFYC  ] ) focus on high school and university level youth with the goal of reducing the risk of radicalization and promoting understanding among faiths . 
Activities have included training and exchanges of [LOC UK  ] youth workers , and small grants to seed projects on interfaith volunteerism , neighborhood-based relationship building , new media promotion of interfaith dialogue , and interfaith dialogue around environmental issues , among others . 
We also support the [MISC London-based Three  ] Faiths Forum , s high-school level outreach program , through which they talk to young people about different faiths and dispel myths and misconceptions . 
8 ) ( C ) The arts: We use elements of new media , culture , and the arts to connect with a younger audience and rising [MISC Muslim  ] artists , using the arts as a platform to demonstrate the rich diversity of [MISC Muslim  ] life in [LOC America  ] . 
The arts are also an important way to reach potentially hostile audiences . 
Programs include film screenings ( [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC America  ] , [LOC DeenTight  ] , New [MISC Muslim  ] Cool ) , support for the annual [ORG Ramadan Festival of arts  ] , and programs with [MISC American Muslim  ] writers , artists , and musicians . 
9 ) ( C ) Exchanges and outreach: People-to-people interactions and seeing [LOC America  ] first-hand have consistently been an effective way of dispelling stereotypes and prejudices about the [LOC U.S.  ] Our programs include: the [ORG Citizen Dialogues Program  ] , [ORG International Visitors Leadership Program  ] , and [ORG Voluntary Visitor  ] exchanges with [MISC Muslim  ] women community leaders . 
Our schools outreach program to secondary schools and universities has included over 20 predominantly [MISC Muslim  ] institutions in nine localities over the past year . 
These school visits were in many cases the first by an [MISC American  ] officer . 
We have built on the [ORG First Lady  ] , s hugely successful 2009 visit to a minority school ( reftel B ) with an exchange program in 2010 that will include some of the students meeting her at the [LOC White House  ] . 
Four [LOC UK  ] businesspeople will attend the President , s [ORG Entrepreneurship Summit  ] in April , 2010 . 
The Ambassador , s Outreach ------------------------- 10 ) ( C ) The Ambassador engages with [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslim  ] communities regularly . 
Beginning with an iftar in 2009 shortly after his arrival , he has spoken to [MISC Muslim  ] groups in [LOC Wales  ] and [LOC Scotland  ] , visited the [ORG London Central Mosque  ] , and hosted an interfaith breakfast at his residence , among other activities . 
Having the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador visit and listen respectfully to [MISC Muslim  ] points of view has an enormous impact on groups that often feel marginalized and ignored .
