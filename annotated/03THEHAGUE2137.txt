( C ) On August 22 , [PER Jan Huner  ] , [ORG Senior Export Control Official  ] at the [ORG Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs  ] , forwarded a message to EconOff regarding Analog-to-Digital Converters ( [MISC ADCs  ] ) . 
The message is in response to ref A and the July 15 visit of ECNP Director [PER Kessler  ] to the [ORG Hague  ] . 
[ORG Begin Text: Title: Reply  ] by the [LOC Netherlands  ] to the [LOC United States  ] note on exports of analog-to-digital converters ( [ORG ADC  ] 's ) . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] has examined the concerns expressed by the [LOC United States  ] on the possible export by [ORG Philips Electronics N.V.  ] of 14-bit [ORG ADC  ] 's to [LOC China  ] for use in base stations for a mobile telecommunications network . 
We have discussed the issue both with [ORG Philips Electronics  ] and with experts of the [ORG Royal Netherlands Air Force  ] ( [ORG RNLAF  ] ) . 
[ORG Philips  ] confirms that there is a distinct possibility that it may supply large numbers of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to [LOC China  ] for use as indicated above . 
It is aware that these converters are subject to export controls . 
No contracts have been signed as yet . 
Experts of the [ORG RNLAF  ] confirm that the 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] as produced by [ORG Philips  ] represent the most advanced [MISC ADCs  ] that are commercially available at this moment . 
They also confirm that such advanced [MISC ADCs  ] play an important role in radar systems for combat aircraft . 
However , it is not yet clear which performance requirements will apply to the [MISC ADCs  ] for the [ORG JSF  ] radar system . 
In examining a possible application license for exports of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to [LOC China  ] , the above considerations will clearly play a role . 
However , as things stand now , it is doubtful whether these considerations would provide sufficient grounds to refuse such an export license . 
There is no indication of a risk of unwarranted military application of these commercially available [MISC ADCs  ] . 
Also , it is very difficult to demonstrate that allowing exports of these [MISC ADCs  ] to [LOC China  ] would pose a risk to the effectiveness of the [ORG JSF  ] . 
We would , however , welcome an opportunity to discuss this issue with our counterparts in the [LOC U.S.  ] We would therefore like to invite a delegation of [LOC U.S.  ] experts to come to The [ORG Hague  ] to further explore the possible risks of allowing exports of 14-bit [MISC ADCs  ] to [LOC China  ] .
