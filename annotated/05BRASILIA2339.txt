( C ) Post delivered reftel demarche to [PER Gustavo Rodrigues  ] of [LOC COAF  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] 's financial intelligence unit ) , [PER Luiza Lopes  ] da [PER Silva  ] of the [ORG Ministry of External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] 's ) Office for the [ORG Combat of Illicit Transnational Activities  ] and [PER Santiago Morao  ] of the [ORG MRE  ] 's Disarmament and [ORG Sensitive Technologies Division  ] . 
[PER Rodrigues  ] responded enthusiastically to the points , noting that [LOC Brazil  ] had presented a paper in the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( [ORG NSG  ] ) context calling for the involvement of Financial Intelligence Units ( FIUs ) in tracking financial networks behind the trafficking of nuclear materials . 
The paper ( document number NSG24 dated March 29 , 2005 ) , was discussed at an [ORG NSG Oslo  ] meeting in June , according to [PER Rodrigues  ] . 
The dialogue in the [ORG NSG  ] context , [PER Rodrigues  ] said , was not extremely substantive as only two countries' delegations , [LOC Brazil  ] 's and [LOC Norway  ] 's , included representatives from their [ORG FIUs.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) While the [ORG GoB  ] strongly supports the concept of using [ORG FIU  ] 's to combat WMD proliferation , [PER Rodrigues  ] noted that [LOC Brazil  ] does not have domestic authority to freeze the assets of WMD proliferators . 
[PER Rodrigues  ] nevertheless undertook to conduct a search of [LOC COAF  ] 's own databases for transactions in the names of the proliferating entities enumerated in [LOC U.S.  ] Executive Order 13882 . 
He further undertook to coordinate with the [ORG Central Bank  ] and the [ORG Brazilian Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG ABIN  ] ) a search of their respective databases . 
The [ORG Central Bank  ] , he explained , has the capability to track the originator and destination for all foreign exchange transactions made through the formal banking system. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Rodrigues  ] acknowledged that , should these searches produce a hit , then the [ORG GoB  ] would have to grapple with how to respond . 
Econoff reiterated that [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] 1540 requires countries to combat proliferation and could form the legal basis for [ORG GoB  ] action . 
[PER Rodrigues  ] took the point , but said it would take some time to implement the [ORG UNSC  ] resolution ( usually done via presidential decree ) . 
Instead , he said , if assets were found in this case , the [ORG Gob  ] would have to find a creative solution , perhaps freezing the ( theoretical ) assets in response to a [ORG USG  ] request through law enforcement channels .
