( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key Points --Egypt 's [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MoH  ] ) has confirmed 12 human cases of [MISC H5N1  ] ( avian influenza ) in 2010 , with three fatalities. --In the wake of efforts to combat H1N1 ( swine flu ) , [ORG MoH  ] will increase its public awareness [MISC H5N1  ] influenza programs for health care providers to ensure they remain vigilant in detecting avian influenza. --MoH is exploring the possibility of testing deceased H1N1 ( swine flu ) cases for the [MISC H5N1  ] virus. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MoH  ] ) Executive Director for Disease Surveillance Dr. [PER Samir Refaey  ] told [ORG ESTH  ] officer on February 10 that [LOC Egypt  ] has confirmed 10 [MISC H5N1  ] human cases this year - four in January and six so far in for February ( two more cases were announced on February 20 , bringing the current total to 12 cases ) . 
The most recent avian influenza fatality occurred on February 10th , the third for 2010 . 
Noting the recent spate of [MISC H5N1  ] cases , he pointed out that during the same time frame in 2009 ( January and February ) , [LOC Egypt  ] reported 17 avian influenza cases and that the [ORG MoH  ] expected the increase for the winter season . 
[LOC Egypt  ] is the only country to have confirmed human [MISC H5N1  ] cases in 2010. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Refaey  ] expressed concern with the increasing amount of time taking avian influenza patients to seek treatment in hospitals after the onset of virus-like symptoms ( the majority of this year 's cases have taken more than four days from the beginning of symptoms to hospitalization ) . 
He speculated that following the intense focus on H1N1 throughout most of 2009 , many private care facilities - where [MISC H5N1  ] patients initially visit - were not screening for avian influenza . 
[ORG MoH  ] also suspects that patients have not been forthcoming in discussing their medical history , especially about their exposure to poultry - an automatic indicator to check for the avian influenza virus . 
In response to [ORG ESTH  ] officer 's inquiry about the growing number of adults contracting the virus this year ( compared to 2009 , when children 0-10 years old were the main victims ) , [PER Refaey  ] stated the [ORG MoH  ] was aware of this development but did not have any definitive answer at this point . 
[PER Refaey  ] admitted that for many health care providers , H1N1 may have supplanted [MISC H5N1  ] as the most worrisome influenza strain circulating across the country. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To respond to the growing number of [MISC H5N1  ] cases , [ORG MoH  ] plans to revitalize its public awareness programs for health care providers - doctors , nurses , technicians - to ensure they quickly identify and treat avian influenza cases . 
[PER Refaey  ] asserted that surveillance and detection programs may have grown " fatigued " from battling [MISC H1N1  ] but [ORG MoH  ] would redistribute information and lead training sessions to re-emphasize [MISC H5N1  ] 's status as a national priority . 
He also highlighted a recently announced [ORG MoH  ] plan to test all severe cases of pneumonia in rural areas - where many [MISC H5N1  ] cases emerge - for both H1N1 and [MISC H5N1  ] . 
Pneumonia is a respiratory condition that normally afflicts [MISC H5N1  ] patients . 
Increased testing for pneumonia may lead to improved detection for avian influenza cases. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] has confirmed approximately 270 H1N1 deaths since the virus first appeared last year in 2009 . 
[PER Refaey  ] stated that [ORG MoH  ] plans to begin testing all of the victims for [MISC H5N1  ] but did not provide details as to when this might begin . 
The potential intermingling of [MISC H5N1  ] and H1N1 is one of [ORG MoH  ] 's greatest health concerns .
