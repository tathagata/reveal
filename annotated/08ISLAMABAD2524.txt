Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Prime Minister [PER Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani  ] will be anxious to prove that he is committed to fighting " [LOC Pakistan  ] 's war " on terrorism and will outline the [ORG GOP  ] 's partial response to the July demands presented by [ORG CJCS Mullen/DDCIA Kappes  ] . 
[PER Gilani  ] will publicly support the coaliton 's " negotiations first " counter-terrorism strategy and defend [MISC Pakistani  ] sovereignty in the face of reported plans for unilateral [LOC U.S.  ] action . 
Privately , he will agree that force is sometimes necessary and assert he is prepared to use it . 
However , coalition strains and governance gridlock are limiting [PER Gilani  ] 's ability to coordinate either security or economic policy . 
He likely will repeat requests for " actionable intelligence " and suggest the need for increased [MISC U.S./ISAF  ] operations on the [MISC Afghan  ] side of the border . 
We should maintain pressure for specific counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) action and condition future [ORG Foreign Military Financing  ] ( [ORG FMF  ] ) assistance on [MISC Pakistani  ] agreement to training that will increase its counter-insurgency capabilities. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Summary continued . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] Muslim [ORG League-Nawaz  ] ( [ORG PML-N  ] ) leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] has used his " go [PER Musharraf  ] go " campaign to become [LOC Pakistan  ] 's most popular leader today . 
To bolster his sagging [ORG Pakistan People 's Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) popularity , PM [PER Gilani  ] may ask for quiet support of a dignified exit ( resignation ) for President [PER Musharraf  ] ; in contrast , [PER Musharraf  ] has asked that we reaffirm [LOC U.S.  ] support for him as President . 
[PER Musharraf  ] continues to debate dissolving the [ORG National Assembly  ] , a step we believe will lead to widespread unrest and increase calls for his departure. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Summary continued . 
[PER Gilani  ] likely will ask for faster delivery of [ORG Coalition Support Fund  ] ( [ORG CSF  ] ) reimbursements , endorse the Biden/Lugar bill to double economic aid to [LOC Pakistan  ] , and support passage of [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zone  ] ( [ORG ROZ  ] ) legislation . 
He will welcome offers of food security and energy assistance to help overcome rising food and fuel inflation and rolling power blackouts . 
He may ask for support to convince [LOC Riyadh  ] to agree to [LOC Pakistan  ] 's request to defer $5.9 billion in oil payments . 
[PER Gilani  ] fully supports efforts to repair strained relations with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
End Summary . 
Filling a [ORG Leadership Vacuum  ] --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Prime Minister [PER Yousuf Gilani  ] is well-meaning , pro-American and anxious to convince us that he is committed to fighting " [LOC Pakistan  ] 's war " against terrorism . 
The challenge is turning good intentions into sustainable action . 
[PER Gilani  ] presides over a fragile coalition mired in governance gridlock over the issue of President [PER Musharraf  ] 's future . 
The real centers of power -- [ORG PPP  ] Co-Chair [PER Asif Zardari  ] and [ORG PML-N  ] leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] -- sit outside government fighting for political supremacy . 
[PER Gilani  ] supports what has been improving [ORG Ministry of Interior CT  ] cooperation , but he has limited power to force the [ORG Army  ] and the intelligence services ( [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) ) to battle a growing militant insurgency . 
His visit to the [LOC White House  ] may well empower him to do more . 
With the withdrawal of [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] 's economic ministers , the coalition lacks the expertise to tackle spiraling debt , food and fuel inflation , capital flight , and rolling blackouts. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Gilani  ] will be seeking public assurances that the [LOC U.S.  ] supports [LOC Pakistan  ] 's new civilian government , but the uneasy [MISC Zardari-Nawaz  ] marriage of convenience may not last much longer . 
When the coalition breaks apart , [PER Zardari  ] will need to bolster his slim parliamentary majority with other partners . 
President [PER Musharraf  ] believes his party can be one of those partners , and we agree . 
But his " go [PER Musharraf  ] go " campaign has made [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] the most popular leader in [LOC Pakistan  ] today . 
[PER Zardari  ] and [PER Gilani  ] fear they cannot politically afford to continue working with [PER Musharraf  ] and may raise this in [LOC Washington  ] . 
In contrast , [PER Musharraf  ] has asked that the USG make it clear to [PER Gilani  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] continues to support him as President . 
Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] [PER Kayani  ] prefers to remain out of politics , if for no other reason than a reluctance to take on twin security and economic crises . 
We believe he will support [PER Musharraf  ] 's resignation with dignity , if the prospect of impeachment becomes real. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Musharraf  ] continues to debate the possibility of dissolving the [ORG National Assembly  ] and imposing a technocratic government ; we believe this scenario will provoke unrest and increase calls for [PER Musharraf  ] 's departure . 
We should support [PER Gilani  ] now and through a coalition breakup . 
[PER Nawaz  ] currently does not have the votes to bring down the coalition . 
Fulfilling Promises ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We have learned since 9/11 that [LOC Pakistan  ] responds , periodically , to [LOC U.S.  ] pressure on counter-terrorism ; we should continue to press for action on specific agenda items . 
The [ORG GOP  ] has responded to the [ORG CJCS Mullen/DDCIA Kappes  ] visit in July by arresting several [MISC Taliban  ] shura members in [LOC Quetta  ] , signed an agreement to install cellphone towers in the tribal areas ( [ORG FATA  ] ) , is initiating an [ORG Army  ] operation in [LOC North Waziristan  ] , and we expect they will allow another [MISC B-300  ] surveillance aircraft to operate . 
These steps will help disrupt cross-border attacks and improve our intelligence capabilities. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) However , the [ORG GOP  ] has not targeted [PER Siraj Haqqani  ] or his network ; nor have they arrested Commander [PER Nazir  ] or [PER Gulbaddin Hekmatyar  ] . 
These militants are responsible for much of the 40 percent increase in cross-border attacks on our troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] this year . 
The [MISC Army/ISI  ] can do the job , but they cling to " old think " -- the belief that it is better to manipulate militants through infiltration , payoffs and " divide and conquer " strategy than fight extremists on the battlefield . 
They fear military action would provoke a tribal war they cannot control , but the [ORG GOP  ] strategy has failed and the government is losing territory to extremists every day . 
While acknowledging that elements of [ORG ISI  ] may be out of control , [PER Musharraf  ] and [PER Kayani  ] remain reluctant to replace [ORG ISI  ] Director [PER Nadeem Taj  ] . 
Bolstering [ORG CT Strategy  ] ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Gilani  ] will proudly explain the [ORG GOP  ] 's three-pronged [LOC CT  ] strategy: political engagement ; economic development ; and force when needed . 
He likely will claim recent ( minimal ) [ORG Frontier Corps  ] action in the tribal areas ( [LOC Hangu  ] and [LOC Bara  ] ) and ( weak ) coalition concensus as evidence of [MISC GOP  ] resolve to execute that strategy . 
We should acknowledge [MISC Pakistani  ] sacrifices in the war on terror . 
[PER Gilani  ] believes the coalition must build popular support for military action , and General [PER Kayani  ] agrees . 
But we should stress that militants are exploiting the coalition 's " negotiations first " policy to plan and launch attacks against [MISC Pakistani  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] targets. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Gilani  ] will repeat [MISC GOP  ] requests for " actionable intelligence " and may suggest that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC ISAF  ] beef up border patrols and stop the drug trade in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that finances arms and militant operations . 
We should respond that the [ORG GOP  ] knows better than we do the location of [PER Haqqani  ] , [PER Nazir  ] and [PER Hekmatyar  ] ; most al [ORG Qaeda  ] and [MISC Taliban  ] sanctuaries are in [LOC Pakistan  ] , not [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
If [PER Gilani  ] suggests improved regional ( especially [LOC Gulf  ] ) intelligence sharing , we should welcome that initiative . 
[PER Zardari  ] has just proposed to us a September conference hosted by the UAE with [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [LOC U.K.  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , and [ORG NATO  ] observers to discuss the situation in the tribal areas and along the border . 
This idea has merit , too. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Gilani  ] will thank the [LOC U.S.  ] for its five-year $750 million [ORG FATA  ] development program and may ask for more . 
Despite security challenges , [ORG USAID  ] is implementing small projects in five of the seven [ORG FATA  ] agencies that will eventually create 120,000 short-term jobs for young [PER Pashtuns  ] who otherwise would be tempted to join the [MISC Taliban  ] . 
[ORG USAID  ] is developing a program to preposition relief packages to deliver ( in the [ORG GOP  ] 's name ) to villages after military action ; we should encourage the [ORG GOP  ] to increase its own civil-military programs to provide relief as part of its counter-insurgency ( [ORG COIN  ] ) strategy. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) Largely because of pride , the [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Army  ] remains reluctant to accept [ORG COIN  ] training for itself or the badly trained and under-equipped [ORG Frontier Corps  ] . 
We should tell [PER Gilani  ] that future [ORG FMF  ] support will be conditioned on the [ORG GOP  ] 's willingness to accept [ORG COIN  ] and close air support training . 
We should assure [PER Gilani  ] that we will continue current efforts to train and equip para-military forces like the [MISC Levies  ] and push him to accept pending training for the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] now has six military officers working in the tripartite [ORG Torkham Border Coordination Center  ] ( [ORG BCC  ] ) ; we should press for [PER Gilani  ] 's concurrence to identify two [ORG BCC  ] sites in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Gilani  ] may raise the [MISC Pakistani  ] request to use [ORG FMF  ] for [MISC F-16  ] mid-life upgrades ; we currently are seeking [ORG Congressional  ] support for this request . 
Fixing the Economy ------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) Economic growth for the current fiscal year is expected to be 5.8 percent , well below the target of 7.2 percent . 
The fiscal deficit is projected to be 7 percent of GDP versus a target of 4 percent ; [ORG GOP  ] borrowing from the [ORG State Bank of Pakistan  ] ( [ORG SBP  ] ) has reached an all-time high of [MISC USD  ] 8 billion . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's trade deficit rose to [MISC USD  ] 17 billion , up from [MISC USD  ] 11 billion last year , as lackluster export growth fell far short of increasing imports . 
Savings and foreign investment both declined . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's rupee has lost 16.8 percent of its value since January and is at record lows . 
We support approval of a pending [MISC USD  ] 500 million [ORG World Bank  ] loan for [LOC Pakistan  ] , conditioned on a coherent plan for reducing food and energy subisidies . 
[PER Gilani  ] may ask for speedier delivery of [ORG Coalition Support Fund  ] reimbursements ( approximately [MISC USD  ] 1 billion per year ) and endorse the recently introduced Biden/Lugar bill to double economic aid to [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( SBU ) Not a single megawatt of electricity has been added to the national grid since 2000 , despite population growth and economic expansion . 
Industrial production is threatened by blackouts and unemployment is rising . 
Petroleum and electricity subsidies account for the bulk of the fiscal deficit and have continued to rise with skyrocketing international oil prices . 
The [ORG GOP  ] is paying [MISC USD  ] 554 million per month for subsidies on petroleum and will attempt to reduce these subsidies despite the intense popularity of such measures . 
Energy accounts for 29.3 percent of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's imports , and growth in exports cannot cover the increases in international commodity prices . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is considering a [MISC Pakistani  ] request to defer $5.9 billion in oil payments ; [PER Gilani  ] may request help in convincing [LOC Riyadh  ] to agree . 
[ORG USAID  ] will launch a three year program to assist with energy policy issues and energy efficiency and we are offering to fund a [ORG USGS  ] mapping survey to identify commercial mineral deposits and potential energy sources . 
[PER Gilani  ] will attend in [LOC Washington  ] a [ORG World Bank  ] investment roundtable focused on developing [LOC Pakistan  ] 's [LOC Thar  ] coal field reserves. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) [PER Gilani  ] will welcome the [ORG USG  ] offer of food assistance ; he estimates that [LOC Pakistan  ] needs help obtaining 3.5 million metric tons of wheat to stave off shortages this year . 
[MISC Pakistanis  ] have suffered monthly double digit food price inflation since September 2007 . 
Over 100 million [MISC Pakistanis  ] live on less than 2 dollars per day , including 25 million living on less than one dollar per day . 
The [ORG World Food Program  ] recently identified [LOC Pakistan  ] as one of 40 countries at risk of food insecurity and recently raised its estimate of at-risk individuals from 60 to 77 million , or 48 percent of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's population . 
[ORG Repairing Regional Security  ] --------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Zardari  ] strongly supports improved ties with [LOC India  ] , irrespective of progress on [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
[PER Gilani  ] called [MISC Indian  ] PM [MISC Singh  ] this week and has agreed to meet with both [MISC Singh  ] and President [PER Karzai  ] in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] following the [LOC Washington  ] trip . 
[PER Gilani  ] has approved the list of [MISC Pakistani  ] participants to the mini-jirga with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] initiated the fifth round of their [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] in July and agreed to expand confidence building measures in [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
[PER Gilani  ] may ask for more pressure on [ORG Congress  ] for passage of [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zone  ] legislation which would benefit both [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C/NF ) However , increased allegations of ISI involvement in the July 7 bombing of the [MISC Indian  ] Embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] have undermined regional relations . 
[LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] are investigating the incident ; we are working with [LOC Kabul  ] to restart [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] economic and military meetings cancelled in the wake of the bombing . 
If asked , [PER Gilani  ] will state that [LOC Pakistan  ] will not impede approval of the [ORG India-IAEA Safeguards Agreement  ] . 
But [LOC Pakistan  ] clearly would like similar [ORG USG  ] assistance to develop its own civilian nuclear capability to meet growing energy demand . 
Negotiations continue on the proposed [MISC Iran-Pakistan-India  ] gas pipeline. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C/NF ) We were disappointed that the [ORG Islamabad High Court  ] increased personal freedoms for [MISC Pakistani  ] nuclear scientist [PER AQ Khan  ] ; if asked , [PER Gilani  ] will say that the [ORG GOP  ] continues to closely monitor [PER Khan  ] 's activities .
