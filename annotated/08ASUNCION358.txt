( S ) President-elect [PER Fernando Lugo  ] will need to rely on his diverse background to govern [LOC Paraguay  ] and hold together the varied interests in his political coalition . 
[PER Lugo  ] comes from a family of long-time [LOC Colorado  ] dissidents , particularly vocal during the [PER Stroessner  ] years . 
After distinguished national military service , [PER Lugo  ] began his own career as a teacher in 1969 but soon found his calling in the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
Ordained a bishop in 1994 , [PER Lugo  ] was assigned to the [ORG Archdiocese of San Pedro  ] for 11 years before stepping down . 
[PER Lugo  ] launched the organization [ORG Citizen Resistance  ] in March 2006 and made his political start by speaking at a massive political rally the same month , leading many to believe that he would be the only presidential candidate who could defeat the [ORG Colorados  ] in the April 2008 election . 
While [PER Lugo  ] 's quiet , affable style should help him build consensus in the next government , other aspects of his personality , such as his avoidance of confrontation , could hinder his ability to govern . 
Sensitive reporting suggests that some members of [PER Lugo  ] 's inner circle maintain ties to representatives of [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] and that [PER Lugo  ] himself has loose personal ties to members of [LOC Paraguay  ] 's [ORG Free Fatherland Party  ] ( [ORG PPL  ] ) , the all-but-defunct leftist micro-party with an armed wing . 
[PER Lugo  ] leveraged his status with the [MISC Catholic  ] Church and reputation for honesty to win the presidency ; he will need more than just a little help from " upstairs " to govern as president . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------- POLITICAL ROOTS ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President-elect [PER Fernando Armindo Lugo Mendez  ] will need his diverse background to govern [LOC Paraguay  ] and hold together the varied interests represented in his political coalition . 
[PER Lugo  ] 's political organization is the [ORG Patriotic Alliance for Change  ] ( [ORG APC  ] ) , comprised of 12 political parties and nine political movements , centered principally on the [ORG Radical Authentic Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG PLRA  ] ) , [LOC Paraguay  ] 's largest and oldest opposition political party . 
[PER Lugo  ] is a registered member of [LOC Paraguay  ] 's ( largely irrelevant ) [ORG Christian Democratic Party  ] . 
His vice president-elect , [PER Luis Federico Franco Gomez  ] , is a long-time [ORG PLRA  ] member . 
[PER Lugo  ] has thrived in the social and religious arenas by reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised , largely with populist ( though not necessarily incendiary ) principles. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Lugo  ] comes from a family of long-time [LOC Colorado  ] dissidents , particularly vocal during the [PER Stroessner  ] years . 
He was born on May 30 , 1951 , in [LOC San Pedro  ] del [LOC Parana  ] ( [ORG Itapua Department  ] ) to [PER Guillermo Lugo  ] and [PER Maximina Mendez Fleitas  ] . 
His uncle , [PER Epifanio Mendez Fleitas  ] , was a renowned dissident [LOC Colorado  ] leader and rival to dictator [PER Alfredo Stroessner  ] who fled in exile to [LOC Uruguay  ] in 1956 . 
[PER Mendez Fleitas  ] founded the [ORG Popular Colorado Movement  ] ( [ORG MOPOCO  ] ) in 1959 , a dissident [LOC Colorado  ] revolutionary group that advocated [PER Stroessner  ] 's overthrow . 
[PER Lugo  ] told DCM his father [PER Guillermo  ] was detained twenty times during [PER Stroessner  ] 's 35-year reign ; his brothers were tortured and exiled . 
( His sister Mercedes puts their father 's lifetime total arrests at 38 . 
) Their brother [PER Pompeyo  ] remains a dissident [LOC Colorado  ] ( ref A ) , another brother lives in [LOC France  ] ; their final brother died of natural causes . 
Despite his family 's strong political traditions , [PER Fernando Lugo  ] himself remained politically disengaged until he resigned from the priesthood in 2006 to pursue politics full time. --------------------- CAREER IN THE CHURCH --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) As a young man , [PER Fernando Lugo  ] finished first in his class during his obligatory military service . 
Yet [PER Lugo  ] was denied a m ilitary commission because of his family 's opposition to [PER Stroessner  ] . 
[PER Lugo  ] then began his career as a teacher in 1969 but soon found his calling in the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
He earned his undergraduate degree in religious science from the [ORG Catholic University of Asuncion  ] in 1977 , the same year the [MISC Catholic  ] Church ordained him as a priest . 
[PER Lugo  ] served as a missionary in [LOC Ecuador  ] from 1977 until 1982 , where he learned the principles of [ORG Liberation Theology  ] under [PER Leonidas Proanho  ] , the " Bishop of the Poor . 
" He returned to [LOC Paraguay  ] in 1982 and served one year as an apprentice in the Order of the [MISC Divine Word  ] . 
He studied spirituality and sociology in [LOC Italy  ] from 1983 to 1987 , earning a bachelor 's degree in sociology from [ORG Gregoriana University  ] in [LOC Rome  ] . 
( There are reports the Church sent him abroad repeatedly -- [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Peru  ] -- to protect him from [PER Stroessner  ] 's regime . 
) [PER Lugo  ] served from 1987 to 1992 as a professor at the [ORG Superior Institute of Theology  ] in [ORG Asuncion  ] , as head of the Order of the [MISC Divine Word  ] , and as vice president of the [ORG Religious Confederation of Paraguay.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Church ordained [PER Lugo  ] as a bishop in 1994 and assigned him to the [ORG Archdiocese of San Pedro  ] , one of the poorest areas in this poor country -- and one intentionally marginalized by the [ORG Colorados  ] because of a strong [ORG Liberal Party  ] presence , which occasionally manifested itself in the form of rural armed groups over the decades . 
During his 11-year tenure as bishop , [PER Lugo  ] fought for campesino rights and organized the region 's peasant movement . 
He resigned as bishop in January 2005 . 
[PER Pope John Paul  ] II accepted his resignation in January 2006 and he thus acquired the title of Bishop [PER Emeritus  ] of [LOC San Pedro  ] . 
[PER Lugo  ] submitted his petition to resign from the clergy in December 2006 to run for president ; the [LOC Vatican  ] denied his request in January 2007 . 
( [ORG NOTE: Press  ] reports in 2005 indicated that the [ORG Paraguayan Episcopal Conference  ] ( [ORG CEP  ] ) announced that it had no objections to [PER Lugo  ] 's activities as bishop and believed his actions were intended to address social injustices and poverty . 
However , other 2005 press reports indicated that the [ORG CEP  ] forced [PER Lugo  ] to resign as bishop because of his association with inciting land invasions that resulted in violence as well as a rumor that [PER Lugo  ] fathered a child . 
The Church must still decide whether to accept [PER Lugo  ] 's rsignation , provide a " temporary dispensation , " or excommunicate him after he assumes the presidency on August 15 . 
END NOTE . 
) ------------- LEFTIST TIES ? ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Sensitive reporting indicates that some members of [PER Lugo  ] 's inner circle have ties to representatives of [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] . 
These [PER Lugo  ] insiders claim that he supports [PER Chavez'  ] plans for [MISC Latin America  ] ; [PER Lugo  ] has stated publicly and privately ( to Embassy officials ) that he will not align himself with [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Lugo  ] volunteered to [ORG OAS  ] chief of electoral mission ( and former [LOC Colombia  ] Foreign Minister ) [PER Maria Emma Mejia  ] early April 21 that while [PER Chavez  ] was the first president to congratulate him April 20 , he does not know [PER Chavez  ] and was delighted that the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador was in fact the first caller to congratulate him and to offer support for his government . 
One party in [PER Lugo  ] 's coalition , the [MISC P-MAS  ] ( [ORG Paraguayan Movement  ] towards [ORG Socialism  ] ) , receives [MISC Venezuelan  ] financial support . 
When pressed publicly , [PER Lugo  ] has publicly identified himself as closest in ideology and management style to [MISC Uruguayan  ] President [PER Tabare Vazquez.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Sensitive reporting also suggests [PER Lugo  ] himself has loose ties to members of the [ORG Free Fatherland Party  ] ( [ORG PPL  ] ) -- the tiny [MISC Paraguayan  ] [MISC Marxist-Leninist  ] party which developed an armed wing in the early part of the decade , and which has roots in [LOC San Pedro  ] and [ORG Concepcion Departments  ] . 
( NOTE: The [ORG PPL  ] today is all but disbanded . 
END NOTE . 
) Several [ORG PPL  ] leaders are reportedly ex-seminarians , although [PER Lugo  ] has publicly denied having been their instructor ( which is not to say that they did not know each other in [LOC Paraguay  ] 's small circle of clergy ) . 
During the just-concluded presidential campaign , it was publicly alleged that [PER Lugo  ] assisted [ORG PPL  ] members in planning and executing the 2004 kidnapping of former president [PER Raul Cubas Grau  ] 's daughter , [PER Cecilia Cubas  ] , and to have helped [ORG PPL  ] members escape [MISC Paraguayan  ] justice . 
[PER Lugo  ] has publicly denied the same . 
[PER Lugo  ] is not known to have links to the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) ; [PER Lugo  ] told [PER Maria Emma Mejia  ] April 21 that he is inclined to publicly declare ( post-inauguration ) the [ORG FARC  ] " a terrorist organization . 
" He stressed to [PER Mejia  ] he had no problem with the use of the word terrorist to describe them since " the [ORG FARC  ] killed my friend . 
" ( NOTE: No Further Information available . 
) [PER Lugo  ] signed a petition in 2000 against [ORG USG  ] funding for [ORG Plan Colombia  ] . 
The petition , drafted by members of the [ORG PPL  ] ( which was then a legal party ) , was sent to the [ORG Foreign Affairs Ministry  ] and foreign embassies . 
[PER Lugo  ] , along with President [PER Chavez  ] and many others , also signed a 2006 manifesto opposing the [ORG Free Trade Area  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG FTAA  ] ) in [LOC Latin America.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) NOTE: [PER Lugo  ] privately told [ORG DCM  ] April 17 ( i.e. , several days before his election ) , that he was convinced that corrupt elements of the police ( if not certain [LOC Colorado  ] politicians ) had protected the [ORG PPL  ] kidnappers , whom he said were responsible for the kidnapping and ultimate killing of [PER Cecilia Cubas  ] . 
He said a police officer came to him with information as to where [PER Cubas  ] was then being held . 
( [PER Lugo  ] was still Bishop of [LOC San Pedro  ] at this time . 
) He said they jointly went to see the Interior Minister ( [PER Nelson Mora  ] ) the night of December 6-7 , 2004 , provided him the address -- and even told him that a police officer ( and possible suspect ) lived next door to the house where [PER Cubas  ] was being held . 
[PER Lugo  ] said the Minister assured them he was already aware , and that " all was being taken care of . 
" The police officer accompanying [PER Lugo  ] , however , was suddenly reassigned the next day . 
[PER Lugo  ] recalled that the Minister publicly declared " We know where you are " and gave the [ORG PPL  ] " 24 hours " to surrender -- but no action was taken . 
( COMMENT: This statement is confirmed by contemporary press reports . 
END COMMENT . 
) [LOC Cuba  ] 's body was only recovered in February 2006 , from the same house [PER Lugo  ] says they had identified to the Interior Minister in December . 
[PER Lugo  ] told [ORG DCM  ] he had recently had it confirmed to him that the [ORG PPL  ] kidnappers had even used the car owned by their policeman neighbor . 
[PER Lugo  ] told [ORG DCM  ] that though he did not have a complete understanding as to the extent of official ( or semi-official ) protection that had gone on , he was toying with the idea of a national inquiry into the case , should he become president , saying , " the people have a right to know . 
" The Interior Minister and several dozen police officials were all sacked following the discovery of [LOC Cuba  ] 's body . 
END NOTE. ------------------------------- TRANSITION INTO FORMAL POLITICS ------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Lugo  ] launched the organization [ORG Citizen Resistance  ] in March 2006 and burst onto the national political scene as a last-minute speaker at a massive political rally on March 29 , 2006 . 
[PER Lugo  ] spoke to about 35,000 people and against the decision by five members of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] to affirm [PER Duarte  ] ( contrary to the Constitution ) as president of both the government and [ORG Colorado Party  ] . 
Many began to suggest that he should run and could defeat the [ORG Colorados  ] in the 2008 presidential election . 
[PER Lugo  ] organized other marches against the [ORG Colorados  ] and supported launching the opposition political movement [LOC Tekojoja  ] in June 2006 . 
( He once pointedly corrected an embassy officer , however , who suggested he was the leader of [LOC Tekojoja  ] . 
) He subsequently formally registered as a member of the ( micro ) [ORG Christian Democratic Party  ] . 
[PER Lugo  ] won the support of the [ORG PLRA  ] in June 2007 when he agreed to accept a member of the [ORG PLRA  ] as his running mate . 
The political opposition formed the [ORG APC  ] , [PER Lugo  ] 's current alliance , in September 2007 from the remnants of the [ORG National Assembly  ] ( [ORG Concertacion Nacional  ] ) , which splintered when the [ORG National Union of Ethical Citizens Party  ] ( [ORG UNACE  ] ) and [ORG Beloved Fatherland Party  ] ( [ORG PQ  ] ) fielded their own presidential tickets. ------------------------------- PERSONALITY AND OTHER BIO NOTES ------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) While [PER Lugo  ] 's quiet , affable style should help him build consensus in the next government , other aspects of his personality , such as his avoidance of confrontation , could hinder his ability to govern . 
[PER Lugo  ] generally connects well with people ( although he is reportedly uncomfortable with women ) and has thus far been successful in attracting a diverse support base . 
He is said to be an expert in " human nature " and is a quick and accurate judge of character . 
Personally a quiet , unpretentious and serene individual , [PER Lugo  ] cares little for physical possessions . 
He typically wears sandals , because that is who he is . 
( He says he has owned two suits in his life ; one for high school graduation and another for his ordination . 
He bought his third for the May 16 [ORG Ibero-American Summit  ] in [LOC Lima  ] , [LOC Peru  ] . 
) However , his strong populist leanings -- including a reputation for detesting flaunting of wealth by the rich -- could lead to rifts with the political establishment . 
Likewise , even [PER Lugo  ] 's closest advisors worry that he will walk away from conflict within his own alliance . 
His reportedly already-strained relationship with Vice President-elect [PER Federico Franco  ] indicates that he may not be able to work effectively with influential members of his own alliance ( let alone with the [ORG Colorados  ] ) . 
But he also has demonstrated an iron will , and is not easily moved from strongly held positions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( SBU ) Given his career as a member of the [MISC Catholic  ] clergy , [PER Lugo  ] is unmarried ( although he is rumored to have fathered several illegitimate children ) . 
[PER Lugo  ] told [ORG DCM  ] April 17 that he admires [PER Nelson Mandela  ] , and particularly , how [PER Mandela  ] defied predictions of impending social strife to bring his country together and move it forward together . 
( NOTE: [PER Lugo  ] was reading a [PER Mandela  ] biography at the time , which was on his coffee table during the meeting ) . 
[PER Lugo  ] speaks [MISC Spanish  ] , [LOC Guarani  ] , [MISC Portuguese  ] , [MISC Italian  ] , and at least some [MISC German  ] . 
He has also studied [MISC English.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Lugo  ] leveraged his status with the [MISC Catholic  ] Church and reputation for honesty to win the presidency , but he will need more than just a little help from " upstairs " to govern as president . 
It is unclear whether [PER Lugo  ] has the skills needed to run [LOC Paraguay  ] ( he reportedly caused an NGO he managed for one year to fail ) , but his historic win with over 40 percent of the vote gives him strong momentum that will help him govern in the short term ( ref C ) . 
In terms of the direction [PER Lugo  ] will take , many questions remain . 
He is a leftist at heart , but given the [ORG Liberal Party  ] 's influence in his coalition and Congress' strong role in the [MISC Paraguayan  ] government , he will likely have to steer a center-left course . 
[PER Lugo  ] 's ties to [LOC Venezuela  ] and others bear monitoring , but so far , his signals to the [LOC United States  ] Embassy have been clear -- he is grateful for our offers of assistance and wants a close relationship . 
If you can't believe a priest , who can you believe ?
