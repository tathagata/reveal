[PER Netanyahu  ] listed steps the [ORG GOI  ] has taken to support [PER Abu Mazen  ] , noting that the [ORG PA  ] is " doing a good job " on security .

[PER Netanyahu  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] is vulnerable to sanctions and urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to increase the pressure on [LOC Iran  ] , with likeminded countries if [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] will not support new sanctions in the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] commented that there is broader [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC European  ] support for tough sanctions than in the past , although the [MISC Arabs  ] may not say so publicly .

[PER Netanyahu  ] said [LOC Israel  ] faces three main threats: [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , the build-up of rockets and missiles in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] , and the [LOC Goldstone Report  ] , which condemned [LOC Israel  ] for defending its civilian population from years of rocket attacks . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said [LOC Israel  ] will need to ensure that a future [MISC Palestinian  ] state cannot launch rockets at [LOC Israel  ] 's international airport or critical facilities . 
End Summary . 
Let 's Get on with Negotiations ------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) CODEL [PER Skelton  ] , consisting of [ORG House Armed Services Committee  ] Chairman [PER Ike Skelton  ] ( D , [LOC MO  ] ) and [PER Mrs. Skelton  ] , Representative [PER Steve Israel  ] ( [ORG D-NY  ] ) , Representative [PER Tim Murphy  ] ( R , [ORG PA  ] ) , [ORG Congressional  ] Staff members [PER Phil McNaughton  ] , [PER Michael Casey  ] , and [PER John Wason  ] , Military aides Colonel [PER Jeff Koch  ] and PolCouns met with Prime Minister [PER Binyamin Netanyahu  ] November <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] was joined by [ORG Deputy National Security Adviser Rear Admiral  ] ( reserve ) [PER Avriel Bar Josef  ] , media adviser [PER Mark Regev  ] , policy adviser [PER Ari Harrow  ] , and a [ORG Congressional  ] liaison officer from the [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] began the meeting by noting his appreciation for his meeting with President [PER Obama  ] at the [LOC White House  ] the previous week . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] described his conversation with the President as " the best we 've had so far . 
" He said that regarding negotiations with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , he told the President , " let 's get on with it . 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] stated that his government had removed hundreds of obstacles and roadblocks in the [LOC West Bank  ] , helping the [LOC West Bank  ] economy achieve a seven percent growth rate , adding " and we can kick it up to ten percent growth . 
" [PER Netanyahu  ] said his [ORG Bar Ilan  ] address last June had been difficult for him , but it had united [MISC Israelis  ] in support of accepting a demilitarized [MISC Palestinian  ] state . 
The current [ORG GOI  ] had also restrainted construction in settlements more than its past several predecessors. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] then contrasted his efforts with the [ORG PA  ] , which he said is maintaining a " political and economic boycott " of [LOC Israel  ] , setting preconditions for negotiations , supporting the [LOC Goldstone Report  ] in the [ORG UN  ] , and is now talking about a unilateral declaration of independence . 
[LOC Israel  ] wants to engage , but the [MISC Palestinians  ] do not . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] quoted a [MISC Palestinian  ] official as saying that the [ORG PA  ] had " exhausted the negotiating process , " then noted that the [MISC Palestinians  ] have not even started to talk to his government . 
The real difference , he pointed out , is that [PER Abu Mazen  ] is facing elections , while [LOC Israel  ] has already conducted its elections . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] also commented that the [MISC Palestinians  ] had initially expected the [LOC U.S.  ] to " deliver [LOC Israel  ] " on all of their demands , but are now realizing that this will not happen . 
President [PER Obama  ] understands , he stated , that [LOC Israel  ] is ready to move forward . 
The alternatives to negotiations are bad for everyone . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said that if [PER Abu Mazen  ] would engage , they would confront all the issues . 
The process would not be easy , but it has to get started. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said the [LOC West Bank  ] had remained quiet during [MISC Operation Cast Lead  ] because the [MISC Palestinians  ] do not [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002777 002 OF 003 want to live under [ORG Hamas'  ] rule . 
He asserted that according to recent polls , [PER Abu Mazen  ] and [ORG Fatah  ] would easily win an election , even in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] stressed that he was not pushing for the [MISC Palestinians  ] to hold elections , but was instead focused on promoting the expansion of the [LOC West Bank  ] economy by removing both physical and bureaucratic obstacles . 
He acknowledged that the [ORG PA  ] is " doing a good job " on security , though he added that [ORG PA  ] leaders are not aware of everything [LOC Israel  ] is doing to support the [ORG PA  ] 's security . 
If we could add a political process to the cooperation that currently exists , we could get security , economic development , and peace . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] warned , however , that if [LOC Iran  ] gets a nuclear bomb , the peace process would be " washed away . 
" Even [LOC Israel  ] 's peace agreements with [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] would come under enormous pressure . 
[LOC Iran  ] Sanctions -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Chairman [PER Skelton  ] noted that his [ORG Committee  ] is following [LOC Iran  ] closely . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he had advised the President to stick to the deadline on the [ORG TRR  ] offer , adding that it is also important to ask [LOC Iran  ] to stop its enrichment activities . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] commented that there is a new mood in the major [MISC European  ] capitals in support of sanctions . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] does not need to depend on the [ORG Security Council  ] , but can work with likeminded countries . 
Sanctions should focus on [LOC Iran  ] 's importation of gasoline , while also focusing on opening up the information networks . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should lead the world toward tougher sanctions , or more of the [MISC Arab  ] states will start appeasing [LOC Iran  ] , as [LOC Qatar  ] is doing . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] summed up his advice as: " stick to the deadline , be firm on the terms , and apply sanctions " if [LOC Iran  ] does not comply . 
He thought [LOC Russia  ] may be more inclined than in the past , but it would be best not to count on the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
Having set a deadline , the [ORG P5  ] 1 should stick to it . 
The [MISC Western  ] powers at least will go along . 
We should close the gap between understanding the problem and acting on it , he said . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said [LOC Israel  ] 's problems with [LOC Iran  ] are not limited to its nuclear program . 
Even without a nuclear umbrella , [LOC Iran  ] is sending hundreds of tons of weapons to [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
The ship seized November 3 by the [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Navy  ] had on board two thirds of the amount of rockets fired at [LOC Israel  ] during the 2006 [LOC Lebanon  ] War. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Representative [LOC Israel  ] asked [PER Netanyahu  ] about the timetable for [LOC Iran  ] to achieve a nuclear weapon . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] responded that [LOC Iran  ] has the capability now to make one bomb or they could wait and make several bombs in a year or two . 
It is important to bear in mind that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime was exposed as a fraud during their presidential elections . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] people detest the regime and have shown great courage in the streets . 
The exposure of the [LOC Qom  ] facility also helped convince doubters in the international community that [LOC Iran  ] has a weapons program . 
[LOC Iran  ] has a weak economy and a fractured political system , so it is vulnerable to sanctions . 
The time to act diplomatically is now , [PER Netanyahu  ] said , adding that we still have a year or two to stop the [MISC Iranian  ] program . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he thought President [PER Obama  ] understands [LOC Iran  ] perfectly . 
The [MISC Arab  ] leaders hope [LOC Iran  ] will be stopped , there is broad [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC European  ] support for " vigorous steps . 
" Chairman [PER Skelton  ] asked whether the [MISC Arabs  ] would state their support publicly . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] replied they might not , but it would not make a large difference since the [MISC Arab  ] " street " will not rise up in support of the [MISC Iranian  ] regime . 
Ready to Talk to [LOC Syria  ] ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to press [LOC Damascus  ] to stop supplying arms to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
Noting that he had stopped in [LOC Paris  ] to meet President [PER Sarkozy  ] on his way back to [LOC Israel  ] from [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] confirmed media reports that [PER Sarkozy  ] had offered to mediate between [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he would prefer direct negotiations with the [MISC Syrians  ] , but added that he would accept [LOC France  ] as a mediator . 
President [PER Asad  ] , however , still wants [LOC Turkey  ] as the mediator . 
Noting that [MISC Turkish  ] PM [MISC Erdogan  ] had recently stated that he would prefer to meet with [MISC Sudanese  ] President [PER Omar Bashir  ] than with [PER Netanyahu  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] asked how the [LOC Turks  ] could be fair mediators . 
Working Together on [LOC Missile Defense  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] said that in addition to peace with the [MISC Palestinians  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , he and the President had discussed joint [MISC U.S.-Israeli  ] efforts on missile defense . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00002777 003 OF 003 commented that he had personally visited the Juniper [MISC Cobra  ] joint military exercise . 
The program has reached a phase at which it is possible to monitor incoming missiles with a good lead-time , but it is still very expensive to intercept " crude rockets " such as those fired from [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The information shield is moving ahead nicely , but the physical shield is lagging behind . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] observed that it is very important for the [LOC U.S.  ] and its allies to be able to defend themselves against missile attack . 
Chairman [PER Skelton  ] noted that [LOC U.S.  ] personnel who briefed the [ORG CODEL  ] were very optimistic about the program . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said only the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] are currently working on missile defense . 
This cooperation sends a powerful message to [LOC Israel  ] 's enemies he noted , and thanked the [ORG CODEL  ] and the [ORG Congress  ] for their support . 
[ORG Goldstone Report  ] a [ORG Key Threat  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Netanyahu  ] commented that [LOC Israel  ] currently faces three principal threats: [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , missile proliferation and the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] . 
[ORG Goldstone  ] gave terrorists immunity to attack [LOC Israel  ] if they fire from populated areas . 
During Cast Lead the [ORG IDF  ] send thousands and flyers , text messages and phone calls to civilians , warning them to get out of the way , yet [LOC Israel  ] was accused of war crimes . 
[ORG Hamas  ] and other terrorists fired 12.000 rockets into [LOC Israel  ] from [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Netanyahu  ] said , noting that [LOC Israel  ] is the only country in the world faced with threats to annihilate it . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] asked the [ORG CODEL  ] to imagine a situation in which [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Air Force  ] pilots must consult with lawyers before they can travel abroad . 
Former PM [PER Olmert  ] , former [PER FonMin Livni  ] and [PER DefMin Barak  ] could be hauled before the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] . 
[PER Netanyahu  ] said he could not accept that [ORG IDF  ] soldiers could be charged with war crimes for protecting their country from constant attack . 
The deaths of several hundred civilians in [LOC Gaza  ] was " tragic , " [PER Netanyahu  ] said , but there was no deliberate targeting of civilians by [LOC Israel  ] . 
Deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime , but what should [LOC Israel  ] do when terrorists deliberately target [MISC Israeli  ] civilians and then hide within their civilian population ? <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [ORG CODEL  ] [PER Skelton  ] did not clear this cable .
