( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Highlights of this semi-annual [MISC U.S.-Ukraine  ] nonproliferation dialogue include: --Ukraine gave an inconsistent answer on the question of transferring [ORG HEU  ] spent fuel to [LOC Russia.  ] --Ukraine asked for additional security assurances beyond those provided in [LOC Budapest  ] in 1994 , and was interested in continued missile defense cooperation with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
-- [LOC Ukraine  ] noted that the [MISC SCUD  ] missile elimination Memorandum of Understanding had been approved by all the [LOC Ministries  ] , was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for final approval , and will soon be ready . 
-- [LOC Ukraine  ] requested [LOC U.S.  ] support for additional elimination of melange liquid rocket propellant , but the [LOC U.S.  ] said it would concentrate first on eliminating the [MISC SCUDs  ] and associated melange before discussing any further elimination of melange . 
-- [LOC Ukraine  ] requested additional [LOC U.S.  ] funding for [MISC SS-24  ] elimination , which the [LOC U.S.  ] undertook to consider and respond to . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] made a formal request for more information on Ukraine’s planned transfer of MTCR Category I items to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to allow for robust bilateral consultations on the margins of the [ORG MTCR Rio de Janeiro Plenary  ] in November on the [MISC Saudi  ] issue as well as the broader issue of Category I transfers . 
-- [LOC Ukraine  ] said it is no longer exporting weapons to [LOC Burma  ] , and claimed not to have exported T-72 tanks to [LOC South Sudan  ] despite [LOC U.S.  ] satellite photos to the contrary . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] noted it would have to consider whether to impose sanctions for the tank transfer , and that a factor in [LOC U.S.  ] deliberations would be whether the [ORG GOU  ] was being truthful . 
-- [LOC Ukraine  ] again undertook to look into specialty steel exports to [ORG Iran’s  ] missile program , while the [LOC U.S.  ] warned that if [LOC Ukraine  ] could not solve this problem on its own , the [LOC U.S.  ] may take action of its own against the entities involved . 
-- After two years of negotiations , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] signed a contract September 24 on the removal and storage of radioactive sources . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] also pressed [LOC Ukraine  ] to agree to destroy more small arms under the [ORG NATO Partnership for Peace Small Arms/Light Weapons  ] destruction project . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a one-on-one meeting prior to the formal meeting , [PER Nykonenko  ] welcomed [PER Van Diepen  ] to [LOC Kyiv  ] . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] was very familiar with [PER Van Diepen’s  ] strong nonproliferation bona fides and took this as more proof that the [LOC United States  ] had confidence [LOC Ukraine  ] could be a strong nonproliferation partner . 
The sides previewed the agenda and discussed security assurances , [ORG HEU  ] spent fuel repatriation and downblending , [ORG NATO Partnership for Peace  ] issues related to small arms and light weapons elimination , [MISC SCUD  ] missile elimination , missile defense , [MISC Ukrainian  ] specialty steel exports to [LOC Iran  ] , and [MISC Ukrainian  ] T-72 tank exports to [LOC South Sudan  ] . 
Relevant portions of the one-on-one discussion are included in the following readout of the regular meeting agenda . 
[ORG HEU  ] --- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During the one-on-one meeting , [PER Van Diepen  ] said that it was particularly urgent for [LOC Ukraine  ] to approve the shipment of the [ORG HEU  ] spent fuel from the [ORG Kyiv Institute  ] to [LOC Russia  ] by the end of September . 
He explained that if the shipment is not approved by then , it could not take place until 2011 at the earliest , and [LOC Ukraine  ] would continue to bear the costs and security risks of storing the material until then ; that the spent fuel had no commercial value , but would be valuable to terrorists ; and that , since [LOC Ukraine  ] had been invited to the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] next year , it would be important for [LOC Ukraine  ] to report progress in securing its nuclear materials . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] replied that Ukraine’s position of February 2008 had not changed , and thus we had to wait for the [ORG Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences  ] report in early 2010. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In meetings the next day , [PER Vladimir Ryabtsev  ] from [ORG Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council  ] ( [ORG NSDC  ] ) explained that all of the technical issues had been resolved , and [LOC Ukraine  ] had made the decision to ship the spent fuel . 
They had not shipped it because it had not been worked out who would pay [LOC Russia  ] $800,000 for addressing the waste associated with reprocessing the spent fuel . 
There was not enough money in [ORG Ukraine’s  ] budget to pay this expense . 
[PER Wayne Leach  ] , the [ORG DOE  ] officer assigned to Embassy [LOC Kyiv  ] , said that the [LOC U.S.  ] would send this new information back to [LOC Washington  ] and provide an answer to [LOC Ukraine  ] soon . 
( Comment: Other sources have indicated to [ORG DOE  ] separately that the decision to repatriate this spent fuel still rests with the President and the [ORG NSDC  ] and is still being addressed as a package along with the other [MISC Russian-origin  ] [ORG HEU  ] in [LOC Ukraine  ] ; in effect , that [PER Ryabtsev  ] may have been characterizing the debate somewhat inaccurately . 
The [ORG GOU  ] has long been aware that [ORG DOE’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative  ] program does not have authority to pay for waste issues associated with such repatriation . 
) Missile Defense --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) In the one-on-one meeting before the plenary , [PER Nykonenko  ] told [PER Van Diepen  ] that [LOC Ukraine  ] had read with interest the new [LOC U.S.  ] plan for missile defense in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] pointed out that [LOC Ukraine  ] had missile defense expertise and was interested in continued missile defense cooperation , which could help reconfirm [ORG Ukraine’s  ] role in the new [MISC European  ] security architecture . 
It was ‘very important’ for [LOC Ukraine  ] to receive positive signals from the [LOC U.S.  ] , he said . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] would be looking forward to discussing missile defense with [LOC Ukraine  ] the following week during the meetings in [LOC Kyiv  ] led by Assistant Secretary of Defense for [ORG International Security Affairs Vershbow  ] . 
Security Assurances ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The first item [PER Nykonenko  ] raised during the one-on-meeting was an appeal for additional security assurances for [LOC Ukraine  ] , beyond those the [LOC U.S.  ] had provided in the 1994 [ORG Budapest Declaration  ] . 
He explained that [LOC Ukraine  ] felt threatened , particularly after the [MISC Russian  ] invasion of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] needed a security anchor to fill the vacuum until it could join [ORG NATO  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] had received the August 2009 note from the [LOC U.S.  ] reaffirming [LOC Budapest  ] , but it wanted to discuss the issue in more detail . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] was hoping that , with [LOC U.S.  ] leadership , a new multilateral security assurance could be worked out . 
The [ORG GOU  ] would be grateful to begin expert-level talks on this ; the fact of such talks would send a good signal to [ORG Ukraine’s  ] public*and neighbors . 
He passed a non-paper that proposed a new security assurance . 
Legally binding assurances were best , he concluded , but he said he understood this was very difficult. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Van Diepen  ] explained that the United [ORG States’ Budapest  ] commitment endured and was not tied to the expiration of the [ORG START Treaty  ] in December . 
See paragraphs 53-54 below for additional discussions on this topic and issues related to the [LOC START Follow-on Treaty  ] . 
[MISC SCUD Missile Elimination  ] ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nykonenko  ] introduced the [MISC SCUD  ] agenda item by noting that this project is a priority for [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
[ORG Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense Economic Department Deputy  ] Director [PER Sergiy Novosyolov  ] reiterated that point and stated that we successfully completed the first stage -- the [LOC U.S.  ] team inventory of the [MISC SCUDs  ] and associated equipment in June-July 2009 , the various documents and annexes from each of the sites , and [LOC U.S.  ] agreement to eliminate a portion of the melange ( liquid propellant for [MISC SCUD  ] and other missiles ) . 
[PER Novosyolov  ] further explained that the [MISC SCUD Memorandum  ] of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) had been approved by all the [ORG Ministries  ] and was submitted to the [ORG Cabinet  ] of Ministers for final approval and will soon be ready . 
He also noted that a list of possible [MISC Ukrainian  ] contractors had been sent to the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy and stated [ORG GOU  ] readiness to discuss costs , timetables , volume of work , transporting the missiles to elimination sites , and other technical and logistical factors associated with implementation of the project. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Alexander Dotsenko  ] , from the [ORG National Security and Defense Council  ] , added that there are several legal issues for the [ORG Cabinet  ] of Ministers to consider before authorizing the [ORG MOD  ] to sign the [ORG MOU  ] . 
He stated that we should schedule an experts meeting to discuss the details of the elimination work , including the specific process for selecting the contractor , tax exemption issues , and a system to monitor the work of the contractor to ensure that all of the work is completed on time and in accordance with the other terms of the contract. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] expressed appreciation for the excellent cooperation received from the [ORG Ukraine Ministry of Defense  ] in the conduct of the June-July 2009 site inventories . 
He noted [LOC U.S.  ] interest in moving forward to the elimination phase of the project and hoped that the [ORG MOU  ] would be approved soon . 
[PER Paul Van-Son  ] , from [ORG ISN’s Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund  ] ( [ORG NDF  ] ) office , expressed agreement in principle to the [MISC Ukraine-proposed  ] technical discussions , but emphasized that the [ORG MOU  ] must be signed first . 
He also explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] understood the importance of additional melange elimination to [LOC Ukraine  ] , but noted that we would concentrate first on eliminating the [MISC SCUDs  ] and associated equipment and melange in accordance with the [ORG MOU  ] before discussing any further [LOC U.S.  ] role in the elimination of additional stocks of melange . 
Melange Elimination ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nykonenko  ] noted that [LOC Ukraine  ] had a dramatic melange problem , with over 16,000 tons of the rocket fuel and the steady deterioration of the storage containers . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] had committed to eliminating 1440 tons as part of the [MISC SCUD  ] elimination project and the [ORG OSCE  ] agreed on September 16 to eliminate 3000 tons , [LOC Ukraine  ] was interested in additional bilateral [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to dispose of the remaining fuel . 
[PER Alexander Nilov  ] , a rocket fuel expert from the [ORG MOD  ] , explained that the 3000 tons would be transported by rail to [LOC Russia  ] , where a [MISC Russian  ] contractor hired by the [ORG OSCE  ] would eliminate the fuel . 
The first shipment of melange would leave [LOC Ukraine  ] on November 1 , and the work would be completed in a year . 
This export of a military product to [LOC Russia  ] was in compliance with [ORG Ukraine’s  ] export control laws , he added. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van-Son  ] explained that [ORG NDF  ] contractors are evaluating the technical capability/costs of using the [MISC Polish  ] mobile plant that is on site at [LOC Radekhiv  ] to eliminate the 1440 tons of [MISC SCUD  ] oxidizer . 
He again emphasized that the [ORG MOU  ] on [MISC SCUD  ] elimination must be concluded before further discussions can take place on elimination of [MISC SCUD-associated  ] melange . 
He concluded that the [LOC U.S.  ] would like to evaluate the progress on the [ORG OSCE  ] melange elimination project once it commences , as well as progress on the [ORG NDF  ] [MISC SCUD  ] project , before considering any further funding for any separate melange project in [LOC Ukraine.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Dotsenko  ] reminded the [LOC U.S.  ] of his request to consider eliminating additional melange as part of the [MISC SCUD  ] project and stated that [LOC Ukraine  ] had met its obligation to eliminate half of its missiles and associated equipment by 2005 as it agreed to do in 1998 . 
( NOTE: While [LOC Ukraine  ] currently has 54 [MISC SCUD  ] TELs , [PER Dotsenko  ] maintains that [LOC Ukraine  ] possessed 117 [MISC SCUD  ] TELs when the 1998 [MISC U.S.-Ukraine Memorandum  ] of Understanding was signed . 
According to [PER Dotsenko  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] eliminated half of its [MISC SCUD  ] force prior to 2005 using its own funds , and the [LOC U.S.  ] should therefore consider eliminating more melange based on the 1998 numbers . 
) [PER Dotsenko  ] asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to consider additional melange elimination projects , pointing out that [LOC Ukraine  ] would have 13,000 tons remaining even after the [ORG OSCE  ] project is completed . 
He also requested that melange elimination be included on the agenda for the next meeting . 
Removal of [ORG SS-24 Solid Rocket Fuel  ] and Elimination of Motor Cases --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nykonenko  ] explained that , because of [ORG Ukraine’s  ] budget crisis , the water wash-out removal of [MISC SS-24  ] rocket fuel from the motor cases had been significantly delayed . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] was continuing to adhere to the “black box” elimination method , under which the [LOC USG  ] paid [LOC Ukraine  ] a given amount of money for each eliminated motor case , regardless of how [LOC Ukraine  ] removed the propellant . 
As in previous meetings , [LOC Ukraine  ] requested additional [LOC U.S.  ] funding for [MISC SS-24  ] elimination ( $250,000 per rocket motor to remove the fuel in an environmentally safe manner and an additional $15,000 per empty rocket case ) . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] highlighted a letter sent to the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] from the [MISC Ukrainian  ] [ORG Rada  ] requesting additional [LOC U.S.  ] assistance under the [ORG Cooperative Threat Reduction  ] program to perform this work. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Neil Couch  ] , from the [ORG VCI Bureau’s START Treaty  ] office , said that the [LOC U.S.  ] remains committed to economically feasible , technologically sound propellant removal and motor case elimination as part of the [ORG Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction  ] program . 
He continued that the [ORG Department of Defense  ] is committed to the [MISC SS-24  ] elimination program regardless of the end of START in December 2009 , but will not pay [LOC Ukraine  ] more than it pays [LOC Russia  ] for the elimination of the exact same missile system. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Sergei Birin  ] , from the [ORG National Space Agency of Ukraine  ] , explained that [LOC Ukraine  ] had begun this work with 10 rocket motors . 
It needed $250,000 to remove the fuel from each case plus an additional $15,000 per empty rocket case for expenses related to the operation of the facility where the motors were located . 
[PER Birin  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] needed an additional $6 million to complete this work , and [LOC Ukraine  ] was waiting for the [LOC U.S.  ] answer to its request . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] had allocated $50 million to speed up the implementation of rocket fuel wash-out , but this sum was not sufficient to continue the work*operations at the [LOC Pavlohrad  ] missile facility had been suspended . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] noted that Russia’s costs were lower because it used a method that [LOC Ukraine  ] did not regard as environmentally safe*burning the fuel out of the motors . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] cannot use this method because it is located in the center of [LOC Europe  ] and the rocket facilities where this work is done are near large population centers . 
He added the [PER U.S.-Ukraine  ] 1993 CTR Agreement stated that elimination would be completed in an environmentally safe manner. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Couch  ] recalled that [LOC Ukraine  ] had agreed after four years of intensive negotiations in the [ORG START Treaty Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission  ] ( [ORG JCIC  ] ) to cut four 80-millimeter holes in the motor cases so they could not be used again as rockets , but could be used for other commercial purposes after the fuel was eliminated . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] also could have crushed the motor cases or cut them in two . 
[PER Birin  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] had already eliminated the fuel from four of the ten rocket motor cases in the test batch it was using to refine its wash-out technique . 
In the first motor case there was some residual fuel remaining that [LOC Ukraine  ] burned out . 
This burn-out left big holes in the motor case such that there was no need to cut the smaller holes as agreed in the [ORG JCIC  ] . 
With each successive wash-out , the amount of residual fuel remaining had been less , so [LOC Ukraine  ] was confident it would come up with an effective technique to wash out the fuel. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] noted that [LOC Ukraine  ] was having detailed technical discussions on these [MISC SS-24  ] elimination issues with [ORG DTRA  ] this week . 
He said he would get a detailed debriefing from [ORG DTRA  ] and forward [ORG Ukraine’s  ] remarks to the political level , which would consider [ORG Ukraine’s  ] new requests for assistance . 
He promised to provide [LOC Ukraine  ] a response . 
[ORG Nuclear Risk Reduction Center  ] ( [ORG NRRC  ] ) ------------------------------------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Couch  ] said that for several weeks the [ORG NRRC  ] link between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] had been out of service . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] had determined that the link between [LOC Washington  ] and [MISC Kyiv  ] was ok , and that the problem was between the [ORG MOD  ] and the [LOC Ukraine  ] ground station . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] replied that [LOC Ukraine  ] appreciated [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to upgrade the link , and that [LOC Ukraine  ] had completed this work . 
He said that [MISC Ukrainian  ] engineers were working on the current problem and hoped to have the link back in service soon . 
[ORG Wassenaar Arrangement  ] --------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] had amended its list of military items subject to export control restrictions . 
In addition , it had revised the list of dual use items ; that list is awaiting interagency approval . 
Finally , [LOC Ukraine  ] is working to enhance the control of lathes and other items , including training , that are not on the [ORG Wassenaar  ] or [ORG MTCR  ] lists , but are on the [ORG EU  ] list . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] is using best practices guides for approval of exports . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] emphasized it is very important to pass national legislation to implement the export control regimes effectively . 
[ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG MTCR  ] ) ---------------------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Tetyana Vidzigovska  ] , [ORG State Service of Export Control of Ukraine  ] , stated that [LOC Ukraine  ] had implemented the changes to the [ORG MTCR Annex  ] agreed to at the 2008 [ORG Canberra Plenary  ] , noting that the [ORG GOU  ] approved these changes on September 19 , 2009 . 
She also explained that the [ORG GOU  ] is paying close attention to items not controlled by the [ORG MTCR  ] and is considering enhancing controls over training and intangible technologies , and adopting additional controls on items going to [LOC Iran  ] in accordance with the [ORG European Union  ] list . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] thanked [LOC Ukraine  ] for the update and noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] undergoes a similar interagency process in implementing changes to the [ORG MTCR Annex.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Boris Atamanenko  ] , [ORG National Space Agency of Ukraine  ] , stated that [LOC Ukraine  ] had transferred [ORG MTCR  ] Category I items to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [ORG Category II  ] items to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , the [LOC Republic of Korea  ] , [LOC China  ] , and [LOC India  ] during the past year . 
In accordance with its [ORG MTCR  ] commitments , he noted that [LOC Ukraine  ] had informed [ORG MTCR Partners  ] in April 2009 ( [ORG POC Document  ] 86 ) of the intended [PER Category  ] I transfer to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and none of the Partners had objected or made an official request for further information . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] attempted to confirm that [LOC Ukraine  ] had actually transferred [PER Category  ] I items to [LOC Saudi Arabia.  ] , not just notified its intention to transfer , but Atamanenko’s response created confusion on this point. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] then said that the [LOC United States  ] was extremely disappointed by this unwelcome news of an [ORG MTCR Category  ] I transfer to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
By definition , [ORG MTCR  ] [PER Category  ] I systems are inherently capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction , and the [ORG MTCR Guidelines  ] clearly state that such transfers should only be made on rare occasions . 
A principal purpose of the [ORG MTCR  ] is to prevent the transfer of [ORG MTCR  ] [PER Category  ] I items to non-MTCR countries . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] further noted that he understood that [LOC Ukraine  ] had previously notified [ORG MTCR Partners  ] of an [ORG MTCR Category  ] I transfer to [LOC India  ] , to which the [LOC U.S.  ] objected but [LOC Ukraine  ] transferred the items anyway . 
He stated that the [LOC India  ] case was the first time that an [ORG MTCR Partner  ] had gone ahead with a transfer when objections were made by another [ORG Partner  ] . 
If [LOC Ukraine  ] were to transfer [PER Category  ] I items to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , that would be yet another unfortunate precedent . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] added that the [LOC U.S.  ] would object to such a transfer , as it is our right to do as an [ORG MTCR Partner  ] , but he said he would reserve further commentary until we get more information on what is actually being contemplated for transfer or has been transferred to [LOC Saudi Arabia.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] should consider this discussion a formal request for more information on the [PER Category  ] I transfer to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
He also asked that this information be provided to the [LOC U.S.  ] well in advance of the [ORG MTCR Rio de Janeiro Plenary  ] in November . 
This would allow for bilateral consultations on the margins of the [ORG MTCR Plenary  ] on the [MISC Saudi  ] issue as well as the broader philosophy on [MISC MTCR  ] [PER Category  ] I transfers . 
Given the confusion over whether or not a transfer had already taken place , [PER Van Diepen  ] requested further clarification from [LOC Ukraine  ] on Day 2 of the talks. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) On Day 2 , [PER Atamanenko  ] clarified that no [ORG MTCR Category  ] I items had yet been transferred to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , but a project had been started that will result in a Category I transfer . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] will not transfer any technology that would create any missile systems . 
[PER Atamanenko  ] also noted that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( ISN Director [ORG Durham  ] ) and [LOC UK  ] had approached the [ORG GOU  ] at the [ORG MTCR  ] RPOC meeting in [LOC Paris  ] in April , that they had requested further information about the sale , and had not raised concerns about the potential transfer . 
However , [LOC Ukraine  ] had not received a formal written request from the [LOC U.S.  ] or the [LOC UK  ] for this information . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] then reiterated his ‘formal’ request for further information on the equipment/technology to be transferred in preparation for a robust discussion of this issue on the margins of the upcoming [ORG MTCR Plenary  ] . 
( Embassy [MISC Kyiv  ] subsequently followed up with a written request and raised the request in further meetings with [ORG MFA  ] . 
) [ORG Arms Trade Treaty  ] ( [ORG ATT  ] ) ----------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] had participated in the [MISC ATT’s Open-Ended Working Group  ] meetings in 2009 and was looking forward to the February 2010 meetings . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] supported the development of the [ORG ATT  ] as long as it did not restrict self-defense and the legitimate production of military items . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] was optimistic that an [ORG ATT  ] could capture countries outside of the export control regimes . 
He said that [LOC Russia  ] did not agree with [MISC Ukraine’s  ] position , so we needed a common strategy to deal with [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] added that any [PER Treaty  ] negotiated without the participation of the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC China  ] would be of limited utility. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] said that the [LOC United States  ] supports greater responsibility in arms transfers , reducing the destabilizing trade in illicit arms , and ensuring that all states have national systems and internal controls that meet the highest standards . 
In working towards these goals , we will continue to oppose lowering of international standards on the transfer of conventional arms and ensure that there is no infringement on domestic ownership of firearms . 
He continued that work on the [ORG ATT  ] must be done on a consensus basis in order to ensure these objectives are met . 
The [LOC UK  ] needs to get back tQconsensus decision-making ; the [LOC UK  ] planned to introduce a resolution during the [ORG UN First Committee*the U.S.  ] needed [MISC Ukraine’s  ] help to ensure that consensus decision-making is part of any resolution passed . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] supported the [LOC U.S.  ] position on the feasibility of an [ORG ATT  ] and that the two countries ( along with [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] ) needed to develop a common strategy . 
Transfer Cases -------------- <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] said that there are two types of cases the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to discuss on the second day of the consultations: 1 ) transfers to [LOC Burma  ] and [LOC South Sudan  ] in which there were deliberate [MISC Ukrainian  ] government actions that are contrary to [LOC U.S.  ] philosophy on exports ; and 2 ) other transfers by [MISC Ukrainian  ] entities , presumably not authorized by the [MISC Ukrainian  ] government . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] wants to work cooperatively with [LOC Ukraine  ] to stop this second category of illicit transfers . 
[LOC Burma  ] ----- <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] had received the [LOC U.S.  ] demarche and was no longer exporting weapons to [LOC Burma  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] was just wrapping up existing contracts , and had been reducing its exports to [LOC Burma  ] since 2005 . 
In 2008 [MISC Ukrainian  ] exports to [LOC Burma  ] were ‘as good as zero’ in part due to previous [LOC U.S.  ] warnings , and [LOC Ukraine  ] had not signed any new contracts with [LOC Burma  ] in the last two and one half years . 
Current exports were just spare parts . 
The remaining business was so small that the company involved had recalled all of its workers from [LOC Burma.  ] <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) ISN/CATR Deputy Director [PER Brian Bachman  ] thanked [PER Nykonenko  ] for the information . 
He said that the [LOC U.S.  ] was still concerned about the exports to [LOC Burma  ] , but was pleased to hear that [LOC Ukraine  ] was now only exporting a small number of spare parts and was no longer exported completed weapons , as reports had indicated . 
[LOC South Sudan  ] ----------- <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] recalled that when the [LOC U.S.  ] had raised with [LOC Ukraine  ] in July 2008 that an additional shipment of [MISC T-72  ] tanks , [MISC BM-1  ] GRAD armored vehicles , small arms , and other military equipment planned for a late June or early July shipment to [LOC Kenya  ] was being purchased by the [MISC Kenyan  ] Ministry of [ORG State Defense for South Sudan  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] had assured us the arms were for the Government of [LOC Kenya  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] had informed the [LOC U.S.  ] that it had received an end-user certificate from the [MISC Kenyan  ] government and receipts acknowledging the arrival of the earlier tank shipment in [LOC Kenya  ] . 
Subsequent to our discussions , the [PER M/V Faina  ] , which was carrying another weapons shipment from [LOC Ukraine  ] , was hijacked , and it became clear that cargo was also intended for [LOC South Sudan  ] . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] asked if the [ORG GOU  ] had investigated. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Valeriy Lysenko  ] , from [ORG Ukraine’s Export Control Service  ] , said that the [MISC T-72  ] tank shipment was intended for [LOC Kenya  ] . 
He said [LOC Ukraine  ] had not transferred any military equipment to [LOC South Sudan  ] . 
All of [MISC Ukraine’s  ] contracts were checked. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] gave the [MISC Ukrainian  ] side a copy of the contract that clearly lists the [LOC GOSS  ] , and asked if the [ORG GOU  ] side maintained that the export was for [LOC Kenya  ] . 
[PER Lysenko  ] held to this line , questioned the authenticity of the contract , and asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] had any better evidence . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] , regretting that the [ORG GOU  ] had forced him to do so , showed the [MISC Ukrainians  ] cleared satellite imagery of [MISC T-72  ] tanks unloaded in [LOC Kenya  ] , transferred to railyards for onward shipment , and finally in [LOC South Sudan  ] . 
This led to a commotion on the [MISC Ukrainian  ] side. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] continued that he appreciated the sides could have different export control policies , as was their sovereign right . 
But not being told the truth was something the [LOC United States  ] did not expect from a strategic partner . 
There was nothing for [LOC Ukraine  ] to gain from lying and a lot to lose , he cautioned . 
Since [LOC South Sudan  ] is on the [LOC U.S.  ] terrorism list , the [LOC U.S.  ] would have to consider whether to impose sanctions over the transfer ; a factor in [LOC U.S.  ] deliberations would be whether the [ORG GOU  ] the truth. <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Lysenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] would study the [LOC U.S.  ] information and he asserted that [LOC Ukraine  ] only had a relationship with [LOC Kenya  ] , and did not have a relationship with [LOC South Sudan  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] could not be held responsible for the actions of a third country . 
This matter was a common problem for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] to resolve . 
He said [MISC Ukraine’s  ] special agencies might need to get involved to find out what had happened . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] would study this situation in the light of a partner relationship so hat the [LOC U.S.  ] would know that [LOC Ukraine  ] is a reliable partner . 
[ORG Ukraine’s Exports of Specialty Metals for Iran’s Ballistic Missiles  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] said that , contrary to [MISC Ukraine’s  ] export control policy , [MISC Ukrainian  ] entities , including [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , were engaged in providing the [MISC Iranian  ] ballistic missile program with specialty metals and other sensitive items such as ball bearings used in liquid propellant missile systems . 
It is possible that these activities were taking place without the knowledge of the [MISC Ukrainian  ] government . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] remains deeply concerned that , given the high quality of steel that can be purchased from [MISC Ukrainian  ] manufacturers , [MISC Iran’s  ] ballistic missile program continues to seek items from [MISC Ukrainian  ] entities , including [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] continued that such steels have long been difficult for [LOC Iran  ] to produce indigenously . 
[PER Van Diepen  ] provided the following points/non-paper: -- The [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] have discussed in the past the supply by [MISC Ukrainian  ] firms of sensitive materials to [MISC Iran’s  ] ballistic missile program . 
-- Specifically , between 2002 and 2007 , we repeatedly raised concerns that Ukraine’s [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was engaged in providing the [MISC Iranian  ] ballistic missile program with specialty metals and other sensitive items such as ball bearings used in liquid propellant missile systems . 
-- In September 2004 , the [LOC United States  ] imposed sanctions against [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for transferring items controlled under the [ORG Missile Technology Control Regime  ] ( [ORG MTCR  ] ) to [LOC Iran  ] . 
-- Subsequently , in May 2006 , we advised you of [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] continued efforts to supply [MISC Iran’s  ] ballistic missile program with additional materials , including [MISC MTCR-controlled  ] 08X22HGT titanium stabilized duplex stainless steel , which is used in the production of [LOC Scud  ] and NoDong propellant tanks , as well as CR18NI10TI , a type of stainless steel that is not [MISC MTCR-controlled  ] , but is used in the production of a variety of [LOC Scud  ] engine parts . 
-- We remain deeply concerned that , given the high-quality of steel that can be purchased from [MISC Ukrainian  ] manufacturers , [MISC Iran’s  ] ballistic missile program continues to seek items from [MISC Ukrainian  ] entities , including [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
-- Such steels have long been difficult for [LOC Iran  ] to produce indigenously . 
As you will recall , in late 2006 we shared with all [ORG MTCR Partners  ] information indicating that a key choke point for [MISC Iran’s  ] missile programs is the ability to acquire advanced materials such as [ORG AISI  ] 4340 and [ORG AISI  ] 4130 steels . 
-- Both of these steels are used by [MISC Iran’s  ] solid-fueled ballistic missile program in the production of motor cases . 
-- We therefore urge you to exercise vigilance in your export control processes , and to take all appropriate measures to ensure that [MISC Ukrainian  ] firms are not acting as sources of specialty metals to [MISC Iranian  ] ballistic missile entities. <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] would look into the matter and provide detailed information to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Van Diepen  ] said that if [LOC Ukraine  ] could not solve this problem on its own , the [LOC U.S.  ] would consider taking action by sanctioning the entities involved , including the steel companies , and by taking other measures . 
[MISC Iran’s  ] missiles threatened [LOC U.S.  ] and allied troops stationed in the [LOC Middle East  ] , so for self-defense reasons , the [LOC U.S.  ] had to act to stop these exports . 
Ukraine’s steel companies have benefited from trade with the [LOC West  ] , but they could not have it both ways-- it was not in their interest to risk large profits from the [LOC West  ] for small illicit profits from rogue states like [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Ukrainian  ] Training to [ORG Iran’s Malek-Ashtar University of Technology  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] said that we recently shared with the [ORG GOU  ] information indicating that as of early 2009 , [ORG Iran’s Malek-Ashtar University of Technology  ] ( [ORG MUT  ] ) , as in years past , was continuing to sponsor international scientists , including from [LOC Ukraine  ] , to provide training in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Malek-Ashtar University of Technology  ] is subordinate to [ORG Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics  ] ( [ORG MODAFL  ] ) , and provides instruction to representatives of [ORG Iran’s Defense Industries Organization  ] ( [ORG DIO  ] ) as well as the [ORG Aerospace Industries Organization  ] ( [ORG AIO  ] ) . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] urged [LOC Ukraine  ] to ensure that [MISC Ukrainian  ] individuals and institutions are not providing sensitive technology , training , and/or other support to [ORG Malek-Ashtar University of Technology  ] or other [MISC Iranian  ] entities affiliated with [MISC Iran’s  ] missile program , and asked for the status of Ukraine’s actions . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] had recently received the [LOC U.S.  ] information and was reviewing it . 
Prohres-Pakistan ---------------- <a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] noted that we recently provided information to [LOC Ukraine  ] noting the interest in [LOC Pakistan’s National Engineering  ] and [ORG Scientific Commission  ] ( [ORG NESCOM  ] ) in procuring gyrotheodolites from Ukraine’s Prohres . 
He urged [LOC Ukraine  ] to investigate this activity and take actions to prevent any transfer of this missile-related equipment . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] had recently received the [LOC U.S.  ] information and was reviewing it . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------- <a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] said that there is a long history to this case and requested an update from [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
He also provided additional information on this case: -- We now have new information indicating that in August 2009 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was working with representatives of [ORG China’s Changda Corporation  ] to establish a partnership related to the production of gyrotheodolites with [ORG China’s Shaanxi Cangsong Machinery Plant  ] . 
-- The [ORG Shannxi Cangsong Machinery Plant  ] is subordinate to the [ORG China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation Tenth Academy  ] and manufactures inertial guidance systems for [MISC Chinese  ] ballistic missiles . 
-- Given the possible missile-related end-use of these items , as well as the identity of [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] potential [MISC Chinese  ] partner , we are concerned that this cooperation could be used to support [ORG China’s  ] MTCR Category I missile programs . 
-- We therefore strongly urge you to conduct further inquiries into [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] dealings with [MISC Chinese  ] missile-related entities , and take all appropriate measures to ensure that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is not serving as a source of goods or technologies for [ORG China’s MTCR  ] Category I programs. <a id='par41' href='#par41'>¶</a>41 . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] is still reviewing the [LOC U.S.  ] information on these matters . 
( NOTE: [LOC Ukraine  ] provide a written update on this case at the end of the talks: “XXXXXXXXXXXX did negotiate with [ORG China Great Wall  ] and received licensing approval to repair a previously provided UGT-S gyrotheodolite . 
However , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not negotiate with the [ORG China Academy  ] of [ORG Launch Vehicle Technology  ] to transfer [MISC MTCR-controlled  ] DOZ stellar sensors.” END NOTE . 
) G8 Global Partnership/Combating [MISC Nuclear Smuggling  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Viktor Ryazantsev  ] of the [ORG State Committee for Nuclear Regulation  ] , [PER Mykola Proskura  ] of the [ORG Ministry for Emergency Situations  ] , and [PER Oleksandr Panchenko  ] of the [ORG State Border Guard Service  ] provided detailed reports on the progress made on the range of anti-nuclear smuggling assistance projects developed with the [ORG GOU  ] by the [ORG U.S. Nuclear Smuggling Outreach Initiative  ] ( [ORG NSOI  ] ) in January 2006 . 
Each reported extensive progress on these projects and expressed deep appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in facilitating both project implementation and participation by other donors. <a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG NSOI  ] Coordinator [PER Mike Stafford  ] agreed with them that the two sides had made remarkable progress on these projects and added that their degree of cooperation provided a model for NSOI’s engagement with other governments . 
[PER Stafford  ] also noted that , in addition to progress on the assistance projects , it was important to monitor progress in implementing the agreed steps in the joint action plan that the sides had also agreed upon in January 2006 and whose implementation the assistance projects were designed to facilitate . 
[PER Stafford  ] noted that the [ORG USG  ] had just received from the [MISC Ukrainian  ] Embassy earlier in the week an updated matrix indicating that 27 of the 30 steps in the joint action plan were either complete or in progress . 
He congratulated the [ORG GOU  ] on this progress and secured Nykonenko’s agreement to keep the [LOC U.S.  ] side updated as implementation proceeds . 
[PER Stafford  ] also announced that [ORG NSOI  ] had allocated $935,000 from its FY09 budget to assist monitoring on [MISC Ukraine’s  ] green border with [LOC Russia  ] , proposed on behalf of the [ORG Preventing Nuclear Smuggling Program  ] a workshop to strengthen Ukraine’s ability to respond to nuclear smuggling incidents , and agreed to a [MISC Ukrainian  ] request to query the Government of [LOC Finland  ] on when a proposed mobile radiation monitoring van might be provided . 
( The [MISC Finnish  ] regulatory authority subsequently reported that they hoped to provide it in December . 
) <a id='par44' href='#par44'>¶</a>44 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On behalf of [LOC ISN/CTR  ] , [PER Stafford  ] expressed [LOC U.S.  ] appreciation for the provision of a temporary location for the [ORG Science and Technology Center Ukraine  ] ( [ORG STCU  ] ) and requested periodic updates on construction of the permanent headquarters . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] emphasized three additional assistance projects that had been suggested by [LOC Ukraine  ] at the most recent Global Partnership ( [ORG GP  ] ) Working Group meeting , and reiterated a request that contributions by [ORG GP  ] members to the [ORG Chernobyl Shelter Fund  ] not be credited against their commitments to the [ORG GP  ] . 
[PER Stafford  ] said he had investigated the latter matter after the original [MISC Ukrainian  ] request and had learned the [ORG USG  ] and several other [ORG GP  ] members were counting these contributions within their [ORG GP  ] commitments . 
The [ORG USG  ] was not inclined to change this practice and thus would not ask others to change , either , especially since how to account for assistance was a sovereign decision . 
[ORG Electron  ] -------- <a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Proskura  ] said that , after two years of negotiations , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] had signed a contract September 24 on the removal and storage of radioactive sources from the [ORG Electron Gaz Plant.and  ] the [ORG Kavetskiy Institute  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] had selected the contractor , and he saw no reason why Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory body would intervene to stop the work. <a id='par46' href='#par46'>¶</a>46 . 
( C ) [PER Leach  ] said that this contract demonstrated Ukraine’s strong commitment to nonproliferation . 
The sides would begin be securing the sources at the two facilities and then would work on removing the material beginning with one-of-a-kind sources at the [ORG Institute of Physics  ] in [LOC Kyiv  ] . 
The sides would work out a way to deal with the different sources and more difficult conditions at [ORG Electron Gaz  ] . 
The sides would need to work closely and cooperatively to resolve all of the problems as the project moved forward , he concluded . 
[ORG NATO Partnership for Peace Destruction Project  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par47' href='#par47'>¶</a>47 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) PM/WRA Deputy Director [PER Steven Costner  ] noted that the sides would have detailed technical discussions the next day on this topic , but he wanted to summarize the state of play in front of the larger group . 
While the original Phase I of the project planned for the destruction of 15,000 tons of munitions and 400,000 small arms/light weapons ( [MISC SA/LW  ] ) , revised plans by [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG USG  ] ( as Lead Nation ) was for the project to terminate when current funding ran out ( around the end of March 2010 ) , due to the [ORG GOU  ] deciding not to destroy all of the [MISC SA/LW  ] . 
This revised plan would cover 6000 tons of munitions . 
The good news was that munitions destruction finally had commenced , with approximately 600 tons destroyed to date , and that the [ORG NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency  ] had determined that an extra 2000 tons of munitions could be destroyed ( i.e. , 8000 tons total ) due to interest accrued in the account . 
The other donors would need to approve the use of the interest for this purpose , but that was expected to be a formality . 
Additionally , construction on the explosive waste incinerator would begin in October . 
As for [MISC SA/LW  ] destruction , over 134,000 had been destroyed to date , with the [ORG GOU  ] recently committing to destroy another 54,000 after over a year and a half suspension of such destruction . 
This would bring the total destroyed to approximately 190,000 [MISC SA/LW  ] , but would leave the project approximately 210,000 weapons short of the original goal. <a id='par48' href='#par48'>¶</a>48 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Costner  ] emphasized that the [ORG USG  ] had committed to engage the [ORG GOU  ] on its proposal to convert the balance of the [MISC SA/LW  ] into replicas for sale to see if this could be done in a way that would satisfy [ORG USG  ] requirements that the weapons no longer function as such . 
If agreement was reached , the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG NATO  ] would commit to continuing the destruction project and destroying the balance of the 15,000 tons of munitions as originally envisioned . 
However , he emphasized that [LOC U.S.  ] laws were stringent in this regard and that experts may not reach agreement the next day . 
In this case , the sides would be faced with two options: 1 ) [LOC Ukraine  ] would need to destroy the weapons as originally agreed ; or 2 ) the project would be shut down , as noted above. <a id='par49' href='#par49'>¶</a>49 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Nykonenko  ] expressed appreciation for the good news that the munitions total would be increased to 8000 tons , and expressed confidence that the experts would find a solution the following day that would allow destruction assistance to continue . 
( [LOC Note:  ] The following day [MISC Ukrainian  ] experts stated that they have recommended to the Cabinet of [LOC Ministers  ] that the [ORG GOU  ] agree to destroy the balance of weapons consistent with their original commitment , instead of converting them to replicas . 
If Cabinet of [LOC Ministers  ] approval is attained , this will allow the project to continue .

) [ORG Biological Threat Reduction Initiative  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par50' href='#par50'>¶</a>50 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Ludmilla Muherska  ] from the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] gave a detailed presentation on Ukraine’s efforts to upgrade 18 regional medical laboratories . 
The [ORG Ministry of Health  ] is also working with the [ORG MOD  ] and the other security services to upgrade security at the laboratories . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] would require additional assistance to reduce the biological threat and to complete all of this work <a id='par51' href='#par51'>¶</a>51 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Van Diepen  ] urged [LOC Ukraine  ] to identify expeditiously a new location for a [ORG Central Reference Laboratory  ] ( [ORG CRL  ] ) that meets DoD/CTR’s conditions and he emphasized that [LOC Ukraine  ] needs to consolidate all especially dangerous pathogens in the [ORG CRL  ] , once completed. <a id='par52' href='#par52'>¶</a>52 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Muherska  ] said that [LOC Ukraine  ] is working on this complex issue and was considering several sites for the [ORG CRL  ] . 
Some of the sites were located on MOD-owned property , so if selected , the site would need to be transferred to the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] is hoping that it would be able to select a site soon . 
Side Conversation -- Security Assurances and [LOC START Follow-On  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par53' href='#par53'>¶</a>53 . 
( S ) On the margins of the [MISC Nonproliferation  ] talks , [PER Nykonenko  ] had three conversations with [MISC VCI/SI  ] Deputy Director [PER Neil Couch  ] to clarify Ukraine’s desire to participate in the [LOC START Follow-on Treaty  ] and [MISC Kiev’s  ] security concerns . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] stated that he has been appointed as the [MISC Ukrainian  ] Representative to the [LOC START Follow-on  ] negotiations and , in that capacity , he wants to consult with the [LOC U.S.  ] negotiator . 
He added that , despite a rocky relationship with [LOC Russia  ] , he has met with Ambassador [PER Antonov  ] on four occasions and he doesn’t understand why the [LOC United States  ] has not offered similar consultations . 
He is willing to meet with [PER A/S Gottemoeller  ] at any time or place . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] reiterated his offer for [LOC Ukraine  ] to play a mediating role between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Russia  ] in [LOC START Follow-on  ] , citing past examples in which [LOC Ukraine  ] had played such a role in [LOC START  ] . 
Finally , [PER Nykonenko  ] asked that the [LOC START Follow-on Treaty  ] contain a preambular statement that singled-out Ukraine’s contribution to [MISC START  ] implementation specifically and to nuclear non-proliferation in general . 
He added that it was unfair to include [LOC Ukraine  ] in the same category as [LOC Belarus  ] and [LOC Kazakhstan  ] since they are members of the [ORG CIS  ] and only do what [LOC Russia  ] tells them to do. <a id='par54' href='#par54'>¶</a>54 . 
( S ) Couch asked [PER Nykonenko  ] to explain why [LOC Ukraine  ] needed additional , legally binding security assurances , recalling that the 1994 [LOC Budapest  ] security assurances provided by the [LOC United States  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , and the [LOC Russian Federation  ] did not expire with the [LOC START Treaty  ] in December of 2009 ; that the 2008 United States-Ukraine [ORG Charter  ] on [ORG Strategic Partnership  ] was still in force ; and that Vice President Biden’’s recent speech in [LOC Kyiv  ] had confirmed the United [MISC States’  ] commitment to [MISC Ukrainian  ] security . 
With all of these assurances , what else did [LOC Ukraine  ] need ? 
[PER Nykonenko  ] responded that [LOC Ukraine  ] had no doubts about the commitment of the [LOC United States  ] ; however , [LOC Ukraine  ] had serious concerns about [MISC Russia’s  ] commitment . 
Citing the [MISC Russian-Georgian  ] conflict and the large ethnic [MISC Russian  ] population in [LOC Ukraine  ] , [PER Nykonenko  ] explained that if the [LOC United States  ] would agree to new security assurances with [LOC Ukraine  ] , then [LOC Russia  ] would likely agree to join in the document . 
That is Ukraine’s real desire ; it views an agreement with the [LOC United States  ] as a vehicle to bring [LOC Russia  ] along . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] added that such an agreement would also satisfy the two halves of [LOC Ukraine  ] society , the westward-leaning half and the [MISC Russian-leaning  ] half , and help quell internal tension . 
He also raised the issue of the [MISC Russian  ] [LOC Black Sea  ] [LOC Navy Base  ] at [LOC Sevastopol  ] , stating that [LOC Ukraine  ] has no way of knowing how many soldiers [LOC Russia  ] had on the base and that he believed [LOC Russia  ] has exceeded its number of personnel allowed under the [LOC Navy Base  ] lease . 
This was especially urgent for [LOC Ukraine  ] given [MISC Russia’s  ] suspension of its CFE commitments . 
[PER Nykonenko  ] was clearly concerned that the [MISC Russians  ] could use the [LOC Black Sea  ] Base as jumping-off point for military action in [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
( [LOC Note: A  ] subsequent initial check with analysts at the [ORG Defense Intelligence Agency  ] indicates no visible build-up of [MISC Russian  ] forces at the [LOC Black Sea  ] [LOC Navy Base  ] . 
DIA is currently conducting a more thorough review of available information .
