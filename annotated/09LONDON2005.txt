( C/NF ) Summary . 
The [MISC UK’s  ] development assistance ministry , [ORG DFID  ] , is seeking to ramp up programs in conflict and fragile states , especially in [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] , while fulfilling its legal mandate to reduce poverty and operate within budgetary limits , [PER Martin Dinham  ] , Director General , International , told [ORG EMIN  ] and [ORG ECOUNs  ] on August 14 .

End Summary . 
Fragile States - [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Dinham  ] explained to [ORG EMIN  ] and [ORG ECOUNS  ] that [ORG HMG  ] had made a policy decision to allocate fifty percent of [MISC DFID’s GBP  ] 6.3 billion budget to conflict or fragile states . 
The definition of both is broad , and includes countries from the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of the [LOC Congo  ] to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Regarding the latter , [PER Dinham  ] said the [LOC UK  ] is concerned that [LOC Yemen  ] combines all the conditions of a potential failed state . 
[ORG DFID  ] intends to funnel more aid to [LOC Yemen  ] , with a focus on governance and justice programs . 
On a broader political level , [ORG HMG  ] sees assisting [LOC Yemen  ] as way to improve relations with the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] , he said , share the [MISC UK’s  ] concern about the fragility of [LOC Yemen  ] and its potential for greater political instability , and the prospect that a more unstable [LOC Yemen  ] would act as a contagion for the region . 
However , he noted that given the history between [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] , the [MISC Saudis  ] can not play a constructive role in promoting change in [LOC Yemen  ] , and that other donors would need to step in to fill the vacuum. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) In a separate meeting on August 19 , [PER Matt Baugh  ] , Principal Private Secretary to Development Secretary [PER Douglas Alexander  ] noted that [PER Alexander  ] had been pleased with his meetings held in [LOC Washington  ] on July 28-29 , and believed that his discussions on [LOC Afghanistan  ] were fruitful , though he came away with some uncertainty how much [LOC Washington  ] was willing to direct more aid programming in [LOC Afghanistan  ] through national and local government , as the [LOC UK  ] was advocating . 
[PER Baugh  ] said the [LOC UK  ] recognizes there is a significant problem of corruption . 
But the [LOC UK  ] believes that the government needs to be able to deliver basic services if it is ever to gain legitimacy , and therefore , the [LOC UK  ] will increase its direct assistance to the government . 
( see Ref A on [LOC UK  ] aid to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
) [PER Alexander  ] also was interested about the broader “aid review” that [LOC Washington  ] is conducting , said [PER Baugh  ] , and [ORG DFID  ] is looking for ways where the [LOC UK  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] could collaborate further . 
[PER Baugh  ] said [LOC Pakistan  ] might represent an opportunity where the two countries could combine their resources and have greater impact . 
Post-Conflict Strategies - [ORG Inter-Ministerial Cooperation  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG HMG  ] has created mechanisms to ensure coordination between the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of Defence  ] ( [ORG MoD  ] ) and [ORG DFID  ] on development strategies , particularly for conflict or fragile states . 
The [ORG Stabilization Unit  ] is jointly owned , run and financed by [ORG DFID  ] , [ORG FCO  ] and [ORG MoD  ] , and its mandate is to improve the [MISC UK’s  ] ability to support countries emerging from conflict . 
It has its own budget of [MISC GBP  ] 269 million , and is physically housed in [MISC DFID’s  ] headquarters , with staff from all three Ministries . 
This unit and other departments within [ORG DFID  ] are involved in internal [ORG HMG  ] analysis of extremism and what drives radicalization in [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] and elsewhere , commented [PER Dinham  ] . 
In [LOC Pakistan  ] , [ORG HMG  ] has identified the lack of education opportunities and the poor [LOC LONDON  ] 00002005 002 OF 003 quality of education in general as primary contributors to radicalization . 
For this reason , [ORG DFID  ] is focusing on assistance to education in [LOC Pakistan  ] , said [PER Dinham  ] . 
In a separate August 19 meeting with [PER Matt Baugh  ] , Alexander’s private secretary , stressed the importance of supporting secondary and tertiary education , as fragile states need skills . 
[PER Baugh  ] said it was important to avoid scenarios in which children leaving primary school lack secular options to further their education and are forced to rely on madrassas . 
The [LOC UK  ] sees the [LOC U.S.  ] as particularly strong in counter-insurgency , both civilian and military activity in this area , and the [LOC UK  ] is interested in working further with the [ORG USG  ] in this area . 
The [ORG Stabilization Unit  ] , said [PER Baugh  ] , is working with the [ORG UK Defense Academies  ] to develop training and curriculum for civilian and military leaders on assistance and counter-insurgency issues . 
[ORG DFID White Paper  ] ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Dinham  ] provided [ORG EMIN  ] and [ORG ECOUNS  ] with an overview of the [ORG DFID White Paper  ] , released on July 8 . 
By law , [LOC UK  ] development assistance must target poverty reduction . 
In the [ORG White Paper  ] , [ORG DFID  ] spells out its spending priorities and framework , within the context of poverty reduction . 
It reiterates HMG’s commitment to dedicate 0.7 percent of GDP to aid by 2015 ( a [ORG UN Millennium Development Goal  ] ) , that half of future [LOC UK  ] direct support will go to public services ; that education and maternal health will be key focus areas . 
Of [MISC DFID’s  ] assistance budget , 42 percent is delivered through multilateral mechanisms , 50 percent is direct bilateral aid ; the remaining amount is used for emergency projects . 
Of [MISC DFID’s  ] overall budget , 90 percent must go to low-income countries ; 10 percent for middle-income countries . 
[PER Dinham  ] noted that the decision to ramp up assistance to [LOC Iraq  ] required [ORG DFID  ] to reduce funding for other middle-income countries . 
The [ORG White Paper  ] highlighted [MISC GBP  ] 800 million that [ORG HMG  ] is making available to support climate change adaptation . 
[PER Dinham  ] commented that climate change adaptation needs in poor countries were enormous and that governments would need to establish dedicated funding for this purpose to prevent it from overwhelming aid budgets . 
The [ORG White Paper  ] states that at least fifty-percent of [MISC DFID’s  ] assistance budget of [MISC GBP  ] 6.3 billion for this fiscal year will go to conflict or fragile states , with a tripling of investment in security and justice in these countries . 
[ORG DFID  ] will also continue its focus on sustainable growth , by providing assistance to help 50 million poor through the global economic downturn , to deliver on its commitment to double agricultural research , and to invest [MISC GBP  ] one billion for [MISC African  ] regional development . 
As noted in the [ORG White Paper  ] , [ORG DFID  ] will be shifting funding away from some countries to others in the next few years , with aid to [LOC China  ] , for example , likely to be reduced ; [LOC China  ] received [MISC GBP  ] 81 million in assistance in fiscal year 2007/2008. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC DFID’s  ] engagement with other multilateral donors is also a major focus of the paper , underlining HMG’s plan to spend more money through the [ORG UN  ] system , to increase support for [ORG UN  ] emergency response funds to meet growing humanitarian demands , to push for the creation of a [ORG UN  ] agency for Women , and to press the [ORG EU  ] to create a single Commissioner for Development and re-prioritize resources to fragile states . 
[ORG DFID  ] also will focus on enhancing the effectiveness of the [ORG World Bank  ] , by pressing for governance reform , pushing environmental sustainability at the core of the [MISC Bank’s  ] work , encouraging changes in the [MISC Bank’s  ] health programs to focus on maternal and child health , and mainstreaming gender equality in all the Banks work . 
[ORG DFID  ] also supports new [ORG World Bank  ] lending instruments. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Dinham  ] explained that [ORG DFID  ] works under legal constraint ; by law , the [MISC UK’s  ] assistance must target poverty deduction . 
Anything done must fall under that rubric , so while there has been internal pressure to conduct more “hearts and minds’ programs , especially in conflict areas , [ORG DFID  ] could only do so if it can be proven that these programs directly improve the health and benefit of the population . 
The Prime Minister - Early Morning Emails on [PER Malaria  ] --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The Prime Minister is personally engaged on assistance issues , [PER Dinham  ] noted . 
It is not unusual , he said , for [ORG DFID  ] officials to receive emails sent before dawn from [LOC LONDON  ] 00002005 003 OF 003 the Prime Minister , inquiring about bed net programs to combat malaria , or sharing his latest idea on education programs . 
Assistance issues have never before enjoyed such high-level political support , and [ORG DFID  ] as an institution has benefited from this , especially in discussions with [ORG MoD  ] and [ORG FCO  ] on post-conflict strategies , said [PER Dinham  ] . 
[ORG DFID  ] has also benefited from having [PER Douglas Alexander  ] as Secretary of State of Development , commented [PER Matt Baugh  ] , since [PER Alexander  ] also is [ORG Gordon Brown’s General Election Coordinator  ] . 
He has political savvy , can work Parliament’s corridors , and shares the [MISC PM’s  ] commitment to assistance , said [PER Baugh  ] . 
Showcase Events - PM Would Like High-Level [ORG USG Participation  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Prime Minister Brown is planning to co-host an event focused on maternal and child health with [ORG World Bank  ] President [PER Robert Zoellick  ] during the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] in [LOC New York  ] , probably on September 23 in the afternoon . 
[ORG DFID  ] officials said that the [LOC UK  ] Embassy in [LOC Washington  ] had passed on the [MISC PM’s  ] request for either the President or Secretary of State to participate . 
( [PER Note: Dinham  ] noted that the wife of [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] , [PER Carla Bruni  ] , was also proposing a separate event at [LOC UNGA  ] on HIV/AIDs . 
The [LOC UK  ] is trying to de-conflict the events , possibly by combining them . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The PM also has asked for the [MISC President’s  ] participation in 1-Goal , a global education event to take place in [LOC South Africa  ] and several other sites worldwide on October 6 , supported by [ORG FIFA  ] and linked to [MISC South Africa’s  ] hosting of the 2010 [MISC Soccer World Cup  ] . 
[PER Dinham  ] shared with us the [MISC PM’s  ] joint letter with [ORG FIFA  ] President [PER Joseph Blatter  ] to the President ( which Post has shared with the desk and [ORG National Security Council  ] , Ref B ) asking the President to be involved in the event , in person , though [PER Dinham  ] said the Prime Minister would also appreciate the [MISC President’s  ] appearance by satellite . 
[ORG Conservative Party on Assistance  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) There is an all-party consensus on development assistance for the first time ever , noted [PER Dinham  ] . 
Opposition Leader [PER David Cameron  ] in a recent white paper on development said the [MISC Conservatives  ] are committed to fulfilling the [MISC UK’s  ] pledge to meet the [ORG UN  ] goal of providing 0.7 percent of GDP in development assistance . 
To do this , the [MISC Conservatives  ] would have to maintain [MISC DFID’s  ] projected budget increases from [MISC GBP  ] 6.3 billion this year to [MISC GBP  ] 8 billion in 2010 to [MISC GBP  ] 11-12 billion in 2012 . 
Publicly , [PER Cameron  ] has stated that only two ministries would not be subject to a mandatory 10 budgetary cut: [ORG DFID  ] and the [ORG National Health Service  ] . 
The [MISC Conservatives  ] are more likely , however , to be more skeptical toward combining [LOC UK  ] assistance funds with those of the [ORG EU  ] , given their natural skepticism toward [LOC Brussels  ] , said [PER Baugh  ] . 
[ORG Labour  ] and the [MISC Conservatives  ] do face the challenge of “selling” assistance to a skeptical [MISC British  ] public , said [PER Dinham  ] . 
For that reason , [ORG DFID  ] recently coined the phrase [ORG UKAID  ] and produced some effective [LOC PR  ] materials for the public that spell out the benefits of development assistance and how individuals can do their part to help .
