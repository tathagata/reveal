1 . 
Summary and comment: [MISC Bolivian  ] Counternarcotics ( [ORG CN  ] ) officials have voiced public concern over a number of negative trends , including a sharp rise in the number of cocaine laboratories seized , the [ORG GOB  ] 's inability to track the rising number of small aircraft used to transport drugs to neighboring countries , the increasing presence of foreign drug cartels , and increased coca cultivation . 
Despite positive interdiction and eradication statistics ( septel ) , local contacts believe these trends will worsen without immediate [ORG GOB  ] attention . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials recognize the problems , and the overwhelming victory of the ruling [MISC Movement Toward Socialism  ] ( [ORG MAS  ] ) party ( reftel ) will give President [PER Morales  ] additional power to shape [ORG CN  ] policy . 
Still , he will face challenges in stepping up eradication and interdiction efforts , risking the anger of coca farmers , the core of his political base . 
This is the first in a series of NAS reports on counternarcotics trends and policy in [LOC Bolivia  ] .

[ORG Proliferation Of Cocaine Laboratories  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
2 . 
The [ORG Department of Cochabamba  ] has become a center for the production of cocaine base , according to statements made by [ORG FELCN  ] commanders to [MISC Bolivian  ] press . 
[ORG FELCN Cochabamba  ] Director Colonel [PER Elvin Baptista  ] told reporters November 30 that [ORG FELCN  ] destroyed 600 cocaine factories in [LOC Cochabamba  ] during 2009 . 
[PER Baptista  ] explained that most were found in rural areas , close to rivers or other sources of water , and used [MISC Colombian  ] methods , which consist of grinding up coca using electric motors , and then mixing it with precursor chemicals in rigid plastic containers. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
3 . 
[ORG FELCN  ] director Colonel [PER Oscar Nina  ] said on November 12 that the [ORG Department of Santa Cruz  ] has become a major center for crystallization ( purification ) of cocaine that is processed in other regions of [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He explained that [ORG FELCN  ] had discovered 16 cocaine crystallization labs during recent operations , one of which had the capacity to produce 100 kilos per day of high purity cocaine . 
The cocaine is produced in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , and the drug is then exported to [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC United States  ] through ports in [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] , according to [PER Nina  ] . 
( Note: DEA estimates less than one percent of cocaine seized in the [LOC U.S.  ] can be chemically traced back to [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
End Note ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
4 . 
[ORG FELCN  ] reported that it destroyed an average of two labs per day in the [ORG Department of La Paz  ] in 2009 . 
[LOC El Alto  ] , the sprawling city of mostly poor immigrants that sits on the high plain above the city of [LOC La Paz  ] , has become a major center of lab activity . 
[ORG FELCN La Paz  ] commander Colonel [PER Fernando Amurrio  ] reported that [ORG FELCN  ] destroyed 133 factories in [LOC El Alto  ] during the first 10 months of the year . 
Many of these labs are small [MISC Colombian-style  ] labs hidden inside houses , making them difficult to detect . 
[LOC La Paz  ] is considered a transit point where coca is converted into cocaine base paste and cocaine and then shipped to [LOC Santa Cruz  ] or other areas of [LOC Bolivia  ] to be exported . 
During a series of coordinated operations in the [ORG Department of La Paz  ] November 20-26 , [ORG FELCN  ] seized 93 kilos of cocaine and five tons of marijuana , detained 17 people , and seized five vehicles. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
5 . 
[ORG FELCN  ] destroyed two large-scale cocaine factories on November 25 in the [LOC Sicaya  ] municipality in the [ORG Department of Cochabamba  ] . 
[ORG FELCN  ] estimated that during their three months of operation the factories had produced 180 kilos of cocaine base paste , and estimated that they could have produced one ton per year if they had remained in operation . 
The seizures brought the total number of seized factories in the region to 12 during the month . 
[LOC Cochabamba  ] and [ORG MAS  ] deputy [PER Edmundo Novillo  ] noted that increasing middle class involvement in coca production and ancillary activities , in [LOC Cochabamba  ] and [LOC Santa Cruz  ] , will require greater [ORG GOB  ] response. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Growing Community Involvement in Production and [ORG Trafficking  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
6 . 
The current rise in the net amount of coca grown and cocaine produced in [LOC Bolivia  ] has deepened rural community involvement in the drug trade , according to numerous NAS contacts in [ORG FELCN  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] 's Directorate of [MISC Coca Production  ] ( DIGPRO COCA ) . 
Contacts report that drug traffickers pay between $8,000 to $10,000 to small rural communities , to buy their cooperation in establishing cocaine factories , and then share profits with the community to retain acceptance and trust. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
7 . 
In a November 26 operation in the indigenous community of [LOC Machak Marca de Pocona  ] ( in [ORG Cochabamba Department  ] ) , [ORG FELCN  ] destroyed 32 [MISC Colombian-style  ] labs but was able to make only one arrest because the entire community fled when tipped off about the raid . 
( Note: Locals in such remote areas can often easily spot official vehicles from miles away , due to the lack of vegetation and building development . 
End note . 
) The local [ORG FELCN  ] commander expressed his amazement to [MISC Bolivian  ] reporters at the degree of involvement of the entire community in the production activities . 
[ORG CN Police Concerned About Trafficking Via Small Aircraft  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
8 . 
[ORG FELCN  ] Director Colonel [PER Oscar Nina  ] told reporters November 1 that [LOC Bolivia  ] CN forces lack the capacity to detect the high and rising number of small aircraft that transport drugs to neighboring countries . 
[PER Nina  ] explained that [ORG FELCN  ] lacks radar or other technological equipment to confront the problem . 
Vice Minister of Social Defense [PER Felipe Caceres  ] told reporters November 9 that the [ORG GOB  ] 's " weakness " in its war against drugs was on the country 's borders . 
[PER Caceres  ] noted that President [PER Morales  ] had instructed the Defense Minister to work on acquiring additional planes , helicopters and radars to close this gap . 
( Many of our [MISC Bolivian  ] CN contacts in the [ORG Department of Santa Cruz  ] have told us frequently that [LOC Bolivia  ] 's lack of control over its airspace results in near free rein for air trafficking . 
Sources tell us that 175 suspicious flights were tracked by [MISC Brazilian  ] government mobile radar on the border between [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] in a two-month period last fall . 
) Involvement of Foreign Drug Cartels <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
9 . 
[MISC Bolivian  ] press reported extensively on [ORG FELCN Commander  ] General [PER Oscar Nina  ] 's October 28 statement that [MISC Mexican  ] drug cartels are investing in cocaine manufacturing in [LOC Bolivia  ] to secure sufficient supply to satisfy market demand . 
[PER Nina  ] stated that [MISC Mexicans  ] employ [MISC Colombian  ] drug mafias , which in turn hire local drug gangs . 
He also stated that [MISC Colombians  ] have taken the place of [MISC Peruvians  ] , who until recently dominated the [MISC Bolivian  ] cocaine market. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
10 . 
The [ORG District Prosecutor 's Office  ] in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] recently expressed concern about the presence of foreign assassins who are hired by drug traffickers to commit murders in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[ORG Anti-corruption Special Prosecutor Alex  ] [PER Oswaldo Cespedes  ] told reporters November 16 that seven people had been killed in [LOC Santa Cruz  ] over the preceding 59 days , and that he believed foreign assassins ( " sicarios " ) bore responsibility . 
[PER Cespedes  ] said that a major increase in drug trafficking activities in the city had made conditions ripe for the creation of drug trafficking organizations . 
The commander of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's Special Anti-Crime Police Force , Colonel [PER Miguel Gonzalez  ] , said it is too early to conclude that foreign assassins were involved . 
Increase in [LOC Coca Cultivation  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
11 . 
The [ORG GOB  ] announced December 9 that coca cultivation had increased 6% in 2009 compared to the prior year , or by roughly 1,830 hectares . 
Vice Minister of Social Defense [PER Felipe Caceres  ] told NAS Director that the two main national parks have more than 2,000 hectares of illegal coca - 1,081 hectares in [LOC Isiboro-Secure  ] and 972 hectares in [LOC Carrasco  ] . 
He said the [ORG GOB  ] knows it will have to resort to forced eradication in 2010 , noting that many cocaleros do not respect the limits on cultivation set by the [ORG GOB  ] . 
Coca Union Says Much [ORG Coca Circumvents Legal Markets  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
12 . 
The [MISC Yungas Coca Producers' Association  ] ( [ORG ADEPCOCA  ] ) , the union formed by 30,000 coca growers from twelve provinces of [LOC Los Yungas  ] , released a report on November 10 that stated that of the 16,127 metric tons of coca leaf grown annually in the [LOC Yungas  ] , only 4,887 metric tons ( 30 percent ) arrives at the legal coca market in [ORG Villa Fatima  ] in [LOC La Paz  ] . 
The destination of the remaining 11,240 metric tons is unknown , according to the report . 
The [ORG ADEPCOCA  ] report also stated that of the 54,000 metric tons of coca grown nationwide each year , only 21,778 metric tons ( 40 percent ) reaches the two legally sanctioned markets -- [ORG Villa Fatima  ] in [LOC La Paz  ] and [LOC Sacaba  ] in [LOC Cochabamba  ] . 
Lobbying For A [ORG New Legal Coca Marketplace  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
13 . 
Coca growers of the [ORG Munecas Province  ] in the [ORG Department of La Paz  ] presented to [ORG Congress  ] a draft bill to create a new legal coca market in the city of [LOC El Alto  ] , next to [LOC La Paz  ] , and branches in [LOC La Paz  ] and [LOC Cochabamba  ] . 
Currently , there are two legal markets - [ORG Villa Fatima  ] in [LOC Los Yungas  ] and [LOC Sacaba  ] in [LOC Cochabamba  ] . 
[MISC Bolivians  ] Polled On [MISC Views Of Coca Situation  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
14 . 
[PER Equipos Mori  ] conducted a November poll in [LOC Bolivia  ] 's nine departments that found: * 60% of [MISC Bolivians  ] believe that coca cultivation has increased since [PER Evo Morales  ] became President ; * 75% believe coca eradication should continue ; * 61% believe that there should be additional government control over coca production ; and * 55% believe the state should control production and commercialization of coca. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
15 . 
Comment: It may not be surprising that many [MISC Bolivians  ] are concerned about coca expansion and support eradication . 
Those directly involved in coca production are a relatively small , but influential , percentage of the overall [MISC Bolivian  ] population . 
There are approximately 44,000 families in the [LOC Chapare  ] ( an average of five people per family ) that are directly involved in growing coca , and 26,000 families in the [LOC Yungas  ] ( an average of four people per family ) . 
The total [MISC Bolivian  ] population is approximately 9 million. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 .
