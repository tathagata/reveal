He assured the Ambassador that the agreement to transfer [LOC Libya  ] 's highly enriched uranium and low enriched uranium ( [ORG HEU/LEU  ] ) would be finalized by August 15 . 
[PER Kusa  ] emphasized that he and his staff were under a lot of pressure due to the extensive preparations they needed to undertake in advance of the August 31 [LOC AU Summit  ] , the 40th anniversary commemoration of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's seizure of power on September 1 , the Leader 's participation in the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] , and [LOC Libya  ] 's potential participation in the [MISC Africa-South America Summit  ] in [LOC Caracas  ] at the end of September . 
[PER Kusa  ] requested the Ambassador 's personal assistance in postponing [LOC U.S.  ] delegations - apart from the visit of the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] delegation - until after September 1.He also asked the Ambassador to ensure high-level [LOC U.S.  ] official representation at the September 1 celebration and noted the importance of setting the agenda soon for a potential [MISC POTUS-Qadhafi  ] meeting in [LOC New York  ] . 
End Summary . 
ARGUING FOR IMMEDIATE START OF [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE  ] 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During an August 5 meeting with [LOC Libya  ] 's Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] , the Ambassador ( accompanied by Pol/Econ chief ) pressed for action on time sensitive and critical issues on the bilateral agenda . 
These included launching a bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] ; signing of the [ORG HEU/LEU  ] fuel transfer agreement ; signing of the [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ; approval of the end-use monitoring agreement for military assistance ; approval of an [ORG NEC  ] site ; and resolution of [LOC Libya  ] 's payment for seven [LOC U.S.  ] properties . 
The Ambassador reviewed developments in the relationship that had led to the proposal for commencing the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] and stressed that it was essential that the [MISC Libyans  ] host the interagency delegation and launch the bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] prior to [ORG UNGA  ] . 
The commencement of the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] would help facilitate progress in other areas of the bilateral relationship . 
It would also help contribute to a more substantive and rich discussion between POTUS and Colonel [PER Qadhafi  ] , if that were able to be arranged , on the margins of [ORG UNGA  ] . 
He reminded [PER Kusa  ] that Acting NEA Assistant Secretary [PER Jeffrey Feltman  ] had presented the same points during his July 26 visit to [LOC Libya  ] ( Ref A ) . 
HEU/LEU: AUGUST 15 REAL DEADLINE 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador also reiterated that [LOC Libya  ] had to sign the [ORG HEU/LEU  ] fuel transfer agreement by August 15 . 
He emphasized that August 15 was a real deadline , given that the [ORG USG  ] had other commitments in this area and there were not enough transport materials available to allow for a [MISC Libyan  ] delay . 
If [LOC Libya  ] did not initial the agreement by that date certain , it risked being relegated to a position on the list that would allow the shipment to be completed only after a few years . 
If the [MISC Libyans  ] allowed that to happen , they would not be able to fulfill their WMD commitments . 
SEEKING PERMISSION FOR THE [ORG NEC  ] 4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On the [ORG NEC  ] , the Ambassador said that we now had one site that we were exclusively looking at and that we might need to expend a considerable sum of money to convince the landlord to take the property off the market while we did a full assessment of it . 
We therefore needed [ORG GOL  ] permission - as soon as possible - to buy the property if that was the decision we reached after the assessment . 
We did not , in any case , want to be in a position of having spent that money for the assessment and then having the [ORG GOL  ] refuse us permission to purchase it . 
[PER Kusa  ] said he would have a governmental committee look into the issue . 
The Ambassador also asked for [PER Kusa  ] 's assistance in seeking to free up the payment ( 5.2 million dollars ) for the seven [ORG USG  ] properties , which appeared to be stuck somewhere between the [ORG Land Registry Office  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] . 
5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador also reviewed for [PER Kusa  ] the planned visits of Special Envoy Gration ( since postponed ) , the [PER McCain CODEL  ] ( August 13-14 ) , and the [PER Meeks CODEL  ] ( August 29 ) , stressing that [PER Kusa  ] should make an effort to inform us as soon as possible [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000638 002.2 OF 003 whether the Leader would be available to meet any , if not all , of the delegations . 
READY TO HOST [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE DELEGATION  ] 6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] told the Ambassador that [LOC Libya  ] was ready to proceed on all of the proposals he outlined and was ready to receive the interagency [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] delegation . 
He noted that he was under several time constraints that could interfere with the [ORG GOL  ] 's ability to move quickly . 
[PER Kusa  ] expressed concern about receiving a large number of different delegations at the same time the [ORG GOL  ] was preparing for the [LOC AU Summit  ] on August 31 , the 40th anniversary of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's coming to power on September 1 , [PER Qadhafi  ] 's travel to [LOC New York  ] for [ORG UNGA  ] , and [PER Qadhafi  ] 's possible travel to [LOC Caracas  ] in September for an [MISC Africa-South America Summit  ] . 
[PER Kusa  ] emphasized that he accorded priority to the launching of the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] within the bilateral agenda and stated that the [ORG GOL  ] delegation would be ready to receive the delegation as early as next week . 
[PER Kusa  ] explained that the [MISC Libyan  ] side of the dialogue would include representatives from the [LOC Justice Ministry-equivalent  ] , the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] , and the [ORG Human Rights Department  ] within the Foreign Ministry-equivalent . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) He asked the Ambassador several times to postpone other visits , including those by the congressional delegations , until after September 1 . 
However , without any guarantees , he agreed to look into the possibility of arranging a meeting between [PER CODEL McCain  ] and the Leader , and he said he would consider receiving other delegations after hosting the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] delegation . 
[PER Kusa  ] took note of the Ambassador 's comment that congressional recess ends at the beginning of September , and therefore the chances of congressional travel after that time would be problematic . 
TABLING OTHER ISSUES 8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Regarding the [ORG HEU/LEU  ] fuel transfer agreement , the FM confirmed that the [ORG GOL  ] was in the process of moving it forward and that he was considering transferring the file to the [ORG National Security Council  ] ( i.e. , [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi ) for further development . 
The other issue areas the Ambassador addressed could be discussed at another sitting , he said , noting that the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] was the most important issue of the day . 
[PER MUSA KUSA'S  ] CONCERNS: VISAS FOR DIPLOMATS AND SEPTEMBER 1 ATTENDANCE 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] then proceeded to highlight two areas of concern: delayed visas for [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats assigned to work at [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] and Mission to the [ORG UN  ] in [LOC New York  ] ; and securing high-level [LOC U.S.  ] official attendance at the September 1 celebration . 
He asked the Ambassador to look into the status of delayed visa applications for several [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats , which he said had been pending for a month . 
He then turned to the subject of high-level invitations which had been carefully thought out and proffered by [LOC Libya  ] to the [ORG USG  ] but for various reasons had been refused . 
He said that the Leader had personally extended an invitation to POTUS to attend the July [LOC AU Summit  ] in [LOC Sirte  ] ( " but for some reason he could not come " ) and had personally invited Special Envoy [PER George Mitchell  ] to visit [ORG Tripoli  ] ( " but for some reason he could not come " ) . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that now he had invited the Secretary to attend the September 1 anniversary events ( Ref B ) . 
He expressed [LOC Libya  ] 's hopes for high-level [LOC U.S.  ] attendance , as it would be very meaningful to [LOC Libya  ] and an important signal of the [ORG USG  ] commitment to the bilateral relationship . 
He noted that several presidents of [MISC African  ] and [MISC Arab  ] nations were expected to attend , as well as some [MISC European  ] heads of state . 
[PER Kusa  ] asked the Ambassador to take personal care to ensure that a high-level [LOC U.S.  ] official is present , implying that yet another rejection would not be well-received . 
10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] concluded by asserting the need to set the agenda in the near future for a potential meeting between POTUS and [PER Qadhafi  ] on the margins of [ORG UNGA  ] . 
The Ambassador said that he would reach out to [LOC Washington  ] for guidance and discuss this and other issues with [PER Kusa  ] when he ( Ambassador ) returned from leave at the end of the month . 
[ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000638 003.2 OF 003 11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Kusa  ] 's readiness to move forward on the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] reflected his understanding that the initiative was critical on two points for [MISC Libya:  ] that it would open up other channels of cooperation and was needed if there were to be any possibility of a high-level meeting in [LOC NYC  ] . 
It is also clear that [PER Kusa  ] is under some pressure to produce high-level [ORG USG  ] representation at the September 1 festivities , especially in light of " hurt " [MISC Libyan  ] feelings over past " rejected " invites . 
We look forward to receiving guidance regarding the [ORG USG  ] position on attendance at the 40th anniversary celebration .
