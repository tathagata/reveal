[PER James B. Smith  ] for reasons 1.4 ( A ) , ( B ) AND ( D ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) While there is no open diplomacy being conducted , it appears the [MISC Saudis  ] and the [MISC Houthis  ] may be seeking to disengage from their fighting . 
Prince [PER Khalid  ] 's announcement on December 23 that major military operations had ended was followed by a [ORG Houthi  ] statement that offered withdrawal from all positions on the border in return for a cessation of [MISC Saudi  ] attacks . 
[MISC Saudi  ] Land Forces have reportedly ceased offensive activities , although significant [MISC Saudi  ] air strikes and artillery shelling have continued . 
It may be that the [MISC Saudis  ] are now starting to turn the fight over to [MISC Yemeni  ] government forces ; [MISC Yemeni  ] military sources reported today that they launched several attacks on [ORG Houthi  ] positions on December 28 ( [ORG Reuters  ] , 12/29 ) . 
End summary . 
SHRINKING MEDIA COVERAGE ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Reporting in national [MISC Saudi  ] media about the [ORG Houthi  ] fighting has decreased substantially in recent days , with news about [LOC Yemen  ] focusing mostly on the attacks against [ORG Al-Qaida  ] targets . 
[MISC Saudi  ] media reports from the battlefront say that the [MISC Saudi  ] military continues " clearing operations " and air strikes while insisting that these operations have not and will not cross into [MISC Yemeni  ] territory . 
Houthi-sourced reports claim daily air attacks by [MISC Saudi  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After Prince [PER Khalid  ] 's 12/23 announcement of [MISC Saudi  ] casualties and his 48-hour ultimatum for the [MISC Houthis  ] to withdraw from [LOC Al-Jabri  ] , the [MISC Houthis  ] released an official statement to [ORG Al-Quds Al-Arabi  ] . 
[PER Muhammad Abd-al-Salam  ] , official spokesman for the [MISC Houthis  ] , said: " There is no objection to our withdrawal from the positions in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] on the condition that the [MISC Saudis  ] stop the aggression and not allow the use of their territories against us. .. . 
The crux of the problem with the [MISC Saudi  ] regime is not the territory or the border but because we faced [MISC Yemeni  ] aggression from its territories . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) This possible olive branch offered by the [MISC Houthis  ] was apparently not accepted by the [MISC Saudis  ] , as the next day the [MISC Saudi  ] newspaper [ORG Al-Yawm  ] reported that [MISC Saudi  ] tanks , heavy artillery and planes " pounded the stronghold of the infiltrators fortified in [LOC Al-Jabri  ] inflicting heavy losses including the deaths of 340 infiltrators and the destruction of the deserted houses where the enemies were taking refuge . 
" The actual number of [ORG Houthi  ] deaths has not been confirmed , but both [ORG Al-Riyadh  ] and [ORG Al-Watan  ] reported on 12/28 that the village of [LOC Al-Jabri  ] was recaptured by [MISC Saudi  ] forces . 
For their part , the [MISC Houthis  ] say there were 31 air strikes on [LOC Al-Jabri  ] . 
[PER PRINCE KHALID'S  ] REPUTATION: ANOTHER CASUALTY OF THE WAR ? ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Embassy contacts in the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] suggest that the [MISC Saudi  ] Land Forces have largely ended offensive actions since Dec , 23 when Prince [PER Khalid  ] declared victory and an end to the main [MISC Saudi  ] military campaign . 
[PER Prince Khalid  ] 's decision to stop ground operations probably means that the [MISC Saudi  ] military has been able to clear the border area of [ORG Houthi  ] insurgents. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) We have also heard that [PER Prince Khalid  ] was pressed to stand down the ground forces because of King [PER Abdullah  ] 's growing ire over three particular issues: 1 ) why it has taken so long to expel the ragtag [ORG Houthi  ] fighters , 2 ) how there RIYADH 00001687 002.2 OF 002 could be so many [MISC Saudi  ] casualties , and 3 ) why the [MISC Saudi  ] military has not proven more capable , given the billions invested in modernization over recent decades . 
Some military officers have speculated that [PER Prince Khalid  ] may have been removed from his position by the King if not for the return and protection of his father [PER Prince Sultan  ] . 
At minimum , within the [MISC Saudi  ] leadership [PER Prince Khalid  ] 's reputation as a military leader appears to have been damaged , perhaps ruling him out as an eventual successor to his father as Defense Minister . 
COMMENT - FINGER-POINTING TIME APPROACHES ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) For the last two months , the [MISC Saudi  ] military has employed massively disproportionate force in its effort to repel and clear the lightly armed [ORG Houthi  ] guerillas from the border area . 
Day and night aerial bombardment and artillery shelling have been the main instruments of what is increasingly regarded within the [MISC Saudi  ] military as an embarrassingly long campaign that was poorly planned and executed that brought unexpectedly high [MISC Saudi  ] casualties ( exact number not known - officially 73 deaths ) , many apparently from friendly fire . 
Nonetheless , the conflict has been carefully spun as a heroic and successful struggle to protect [MISC Saudi  ] sovereignty. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) During the campaign , the [MISC Saudi  ] military turned to the [LOC U.S.  ] for emergency provision of munitions , imagery and intelligence to assist them to operate with greater precision . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] military responded with alacrity to the extent possible , primarily by flying in stocks of ammunition for small weapons and artillery . 
However , the great majority of [MISC Saudi  ] requests remain bogged down in the FMS contacting process or in interagency reviews . 
Prince [PER Khalid  ] and several senior [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Air Force  ] officers have complained that the [LOC U.S.  ] has not rallied to support [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] during its hour of greatest need . 
As the [MISC Saudi  ] military services seek to divert blame for the poor management of the [ORG Houthi  ] operations in the weeks ahead , it can be expected that such criticism of [LOC U.S.  ] support will continue , if not sharpen .
