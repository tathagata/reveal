Mulford  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: A day after the Home Minister was sacked , the impact of the [LOC Mumbai  ] tragedy continued to play out domestically and in the [MISC Indo-Pakistan  ] relationship . 
There is likely to be a shakeup in the [ORG Maharashtra  ] state government today . 
At an all-party meeting , the Prime Minister unveiled a number of steps to strengthen the capacity of the [MISC Indian  ] security agencies to combat terrorism . 
The opposition parties and allies used the meeting to bash the [ORG Congress Party  ] over the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
Most observers believe that the removal of a few political officials and announcement of new steps to combat terror will not restore the confidence of the people in the government’s ability to protect them . 
The [MISC Indian  ] public remains angry towards [LOC Pakistan  ] as it increasingly appears that a [MISC Pakistani-based  ] terrorist group was the culprit behind the attacks . 
There were no new GOI complaints or accusations over the [MISC Pakistani  ] ties of the terrorists . 
Most observers believe that bilateral ties will suffer but that the GOI will use diplomatic pressure rather than military confrontation to respond to the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The fallout of the [LOC Mumbai  ] terror attacks continued on November 30-December 1 as the Prime Minister and the [ORG Congress Party  ] tried to contain the political damage . 
The facade of all political parties coming together to present a united front to confront the tragedy lasted only a day . 
The [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) , other opposition parties and the [ORG Congress  ] Party’s own allies began to aggressively pound the [ORG Congress Party  ] for the intelligence failure that allowed the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks to occur . 
[ORG Maharashtra Shakeup  ] ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Maharashtra  ] Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister [PER R.R. Patil  ] submitted his resignation after the media vilified him for his public remarks that sought to belittle the [LOC Mumbai  ] tragedy . 
His party boss , [MISC Indian  ] Agriculture Minister and head of the [ORG Nationalist Congress Party  ] [PER Sharad Pawar  ] , asked [ORG Maharashtra  ] Chief Minister [PER Vilasrao Deshmukh  ] to accept the resignation . 
[PER Deshmukh  ] himself is under fire and unlikely to survive . 
Besides being the chief executive of the state when the attacks took place , he was accused of “disaster tourism” when he visited the [MISC Taj  ] hotel site with his actor son and a well-known filmmaker in tow . 
[ORG Congress Party  ] insiders in [LOC Delhi  ] like [PER Verappa Moily  ] and [PER Abhishek Singhvi  ] publicly criticized him for the visit . 
[PER Sandeep Puri  ] of the [ORG Congress Party  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] on December 1 that [PER Deshmukh  ] would resign that same day . 
PM Unveils New Measures ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) At a five-hour all-party meeting that lasted late into the night of November 30 , the Prime Minister announced a series of steps the GOI will take to strengthen the country’s capacity to combat terrorism: -- establishing a [ORG Federal Investigation Agency  ] ( [ORG FIA  ] ) to play a leading role in fighting terrorism ; -- enacting stronger laws to allow security agencies to more effectively fight terrorism ; -- enhancing maritime and air security by strengthening the surveillance and interdiction capabilities of the navy , the NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003031 002 OF 004 coast guard , the coastal police , the air force and the civil aviation ministry ; -- increasing the size of the [ORG National Security Guard  ] and establishing four hubs in addition the one site outside of [LOC Delhi  ] where it is currently located. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The PM came under attack from all sides at the all-party meeting . 
The two top [ORG BJP  ] leaders , [PER L.K. Advani  ] and [PER Rajnath Singh  ] , skipped the meeting and sent former Foreign Minister [PER Jaswant Singh  ] and Deputy Leader of the Opposition [PER V.K. Malhotra  ] instead . 
[PER Jaswant Singh  ] and [PER Malhotra  ] condemned the [MISC UPA’s  ] “non-serious approach” and demanded the immediate convening of Parliament . 
They said the GOI was too preoccupied with fighting fictitious “Hindu terror” to protect the country against real terror . 
The Left parties criticized the proposal to strengthen the legal framework . 
They also demanded that [ORG National Security Advisor  ] and other bureaucrats responsible for internal security be fired. “Cosmetic” and “Too Little , Too [MISC Late”  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG BJP  ] also increased its pressure publicly , demanding that the government quit over its responsibility for the [LOC Mumbai  ] tragedy . 
On the Home Minister’s sacking , [PER BJP’s Arun Jaitely  ] said , “It is too little , too late . 
The entire government should go.” [ORG BJP  ] spokesman [PER Prakash Javedkar  ] said :”We want the whole [ORG UPA  ] government to go lock , stock and barrel and let the people decide what approach the country should adopt against terrorism.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Former Ambassador [PER V.K. Grover  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] that the removal of the Home Minister was overdue. “These changes will not satisfy the people . 
They are only cosmetic . 
People want real action . 
They have lost confidence in the government . 
They see it as a weak government . 
It will get a drubbing in the elections.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that all these steps “are cosmetic.” He accused the government of not having the will to go after terrorists because of vote bank politics . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] defended [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] , saying that the resignation of the Home Minister was intended to “restore confidence among the people.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG Poloff:  ] “Mumbai attacks can be described as the last wake-up call for the [MISC Indian  ] nation-state which has been soft-pedaling the issue for long.” Public Remains Angry at [LOC Pakistan  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Although much of the attention of the [MISC Indian  ] public and media has focused on their government’s failings , anger toward [LOC Pakistan  ] has grown as it increasingly appears that [MISC Pakistani-based  ] terrorist group [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] ( LeT ) was the culprit behind the attacks . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared with [ORG Poloff  ] his dismay at what he described as the [ORG Congress  ] Party’s use of political leverage with the media to focus on and “embarrass” [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
As an example he pointed out today’s [ORG Times of India  ] which described LeT as a 100 percent-owned subsidiary of the [MISC ISI’s  ] anti-India operations . 
In [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX’s  ] view , this damaging rhetoric is prompted by the [ORG Congress Party  ] and discourages cooperation between the two countries as it offends [ORG Pakistan’s  ] government . 
Strikes Against Camps is as Far as They Go ------------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In a townhall meeting moderated by [PER Barkha Dutt  ] on NDTV , the audience broke into applause when one participant suggested that [LOC India  ] strike against the training camps where NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 00003031 003 OF 004 the terrorists were trained . 
There have been few calls for military action beyond that . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] that he did not advocate bombing [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He was in favor of a selective attack on a couple of training camps in [LOC Pakistan  ] Occupied [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
In his view , this would send the right message to the perpetrators of terror . 
Diplomatic Pressure Rather than Military Action --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG Pakistan’s High Commission  ] in [LOC Delhi  ] was hopeful that the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] would survive the the current blow to [MISC Indo-Pakistan  ] relations . 
Foreign Minister Qureshi’s meetings in [LOC Delhi  ] last week were very positive and [LOC Pakistan  ] , accoring to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] made a “quantum leap in its offers to [LOC India  ] , namely on economic cooperation.” Regarding the list of tradable goods that are allowed to move through the border , [LOC Pakistan  ] offered to move from a positive list to a negative one , which could open up trade by a substantial amount if [LOC Delhi  ] accepts the proposal . 
Joint Secretary for [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [ORG Iran Division  ] T.C.A. [PER Raghavan  ] , on 24 November - just two days before the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks - said to [MISC PolCouns  ] that political parties were keen to resume the [ORG Composite  ] [MISC Dialogue’s  ] fifth round , specifically to address the terrorism issue . 
Referring to the Joint Action Terrorism Mechanism and the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] , [PER Raghavan  ] commented on the lack of progress on resolving the terrorism issues between the two countries , saying that although the institutions to discuss these issues existed , “these groups are not set up only for discussion , they must provide results”. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) But , in the aftermath of the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks , the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] is likely to suffer . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] that although he expects bilateral tensions to increase , he does not foresee a military confrontation . 
He explained that due to upcoming elections , the mobilization of troops at the border is unlikely . 
Instead he sees [LOC India  ] exerting strong diplomatic pressure . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed , saying he did not expect this government to build up troops on the border or to take any other tough military measures . 
He anticipated diplomatic steps such as closing of trade and transit routes . 
He suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] apply pressure on [LOC Pakistan  ] to clamp down on the LeT and to bring to book criminals like [ORG Dawood.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] opined that the PM and [PER Sonia Gandhi  ] do not want to take any hasty steps against [LOC Pakistan  ] , so there is unlikely to be any troop build up along the borders . 
In [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] view , the [ORG GOI  ] would take steps such as scrapping the cricket series ( already cancelled ) and closing trade routes and then “turn it over to the [MISC Americans  ] to build up pressure on [MISC Pakistan.”  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of the [ORG Congress Party  ] said that the party was not in favor of any troop build up on the borders with [LOC Pakistan  ] but would consider some stern political message to scale up the diplomatic pressure . 
In his view , the bus service and the train service could be suspended followed by closing of transit routes and , possibly , air routes . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered the opinion that the [ORG Confidence Building Measures  ] that [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC India  ] had worked on within the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] are now in danger and the peace process will be jeopardized as a result of the attacks . 
[ORG Pakistan Mission  ] Praises [ORG GOI  ] For Restraint ------------------------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the media’s portrayal of how the events will negatively affect the bilateral relationship will fizzle out over the next few months . 
He praised the [MISC Indian  ] Government for acting “more responsibly and maturely” than it did after the bombing NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 00003031 004 OF 004 of India’s embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] , describing GOI’s reaction as impulsive and politically motivated when it immediately pinned blame on [ORG Pakistan’s Intelligence Agency  ] , the [ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( ISI ) . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Before the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks there existed a standing offer by [LOC Pakistan  ] to have the two countries’ intelligence chiefs cooperate , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] but this offer was retrieved after the media portrayed Prime Minister Singh’s offer to the ISI Chief [PER Ahmad Pasha  ] to visit [LOC Delhi  ] to cooperate on the investigation as a “summons” . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed dismay at what he described as the [ORG Congress  ] Party’s use of political leverage with the media to focus on and “embarrass” [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Comment: No Military Confrontation Anticipated  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Despite the strong diplomatic rhetoric we expect to see in the next several months , the chances of a military confrontation are being played down by most . 
The signposts of such a military conflict are absent: there has been no mobilization of troops at the border , ambassadors have not been recalled nor have there been requests by either side for a reduction in the number of diplomatic staff . 
[LOC Road  ] , rail , and airlinks are still operative . 
Comment: Not a [MISC Good Time  ] to be the [ORG Ruling Party  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) There is increasing agreement between political analysts that the sacking of the Home Minister and announcement of the new measures to beef up the country’s terror fighting capacity are not assuaging the public’s anger at the government and its perceived callousness in protecting them . 
People ask why these steps were not taken four years ago when this government assumed office . 
Rage at the government over the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks has also served as a catharsis for people to vent other long simmering grievances against government - its corruption , its pompous use of symbols of authority like security guards and vehicle sirens , its indifference to providing health and education services , and its paralysis on building infrastructure .
