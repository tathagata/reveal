( C ) SUMMARY . 
On April 16 , [PER Candido Conde Pumpido  ] , Spain’s Attorney General ( [ORG AG  ] ) , publicly stated that prosecutors will “undoubtedly” not support a criminal complaint , filed by a [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NGO  ] with the [ORG National Court  ] , to investigate six former [ORG USG  ] officials , including former [ORG AG Alberto Gonzalez  ] , for creating a legal framework that allegedly permitted torture . 
During a Q&A session of a previously scheduled public address , [PER Conde Pumpido  ] responded to a question on the issue by stating that he will not support the criminal complaint because it is “fraudulent , ” and has been filed as a political statement to attack past [ORG USG  ] policies . 
The [ORG AG  ] noted that the [ORG GOS  ] could not pursue a complaint that targeted [ORG USG  ] advisors while a similar suit against the Defense Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] ( see REF B ) had failed . 
While [PER Conde Pumpido  ] defended the [MISC GOS’s  ] investigation of universal jurisdiction cases to defend human rights , he said that the policy will not be used as a toy or a tool to force the [ORG GOS  ] into investigating the decisions of another government . 
The [ORG AG  ] added that if there is evidence of criminal activity by [ORG USG  ] officials , then a case should be filed in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Addressing next steps , the [ORG AG’s  ] press chief subsequently told the media that the Prosecutor’s office will deliver the [ORG AG’s  ] recommendation to the [ORG National Court  ] , where it will be up to investigating judge [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] - an outspoken critic of the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detention facility who has publicly stated that former President [PER Bush  ] should be tried for war crimes - to decide whether to pursue the case or not . 
As reported in REFTELs , [ORG Conde Pumpido’s  ] public announcement follows outreach to [ORG GOS  ] officials to raise [ORG USG  ] deep concerns on the implications of this case . 
END SUMMARY. //BACKGROUND ON THE CASE// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As reported in REF B , a [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NGO  ] - Association for the [MISC Dignity of Spanish Prisoners  ] - in March 2009 requested that the [ORG National Court  ] indict six former [LOC U.S.  ] officials for creating a legal framework that allegedly permitted torture . 
The six accused are: former [ORG AG Alberto Gonzales  ] ; [PER David Addington  ] , former chief of staff and legal adviser to the Vice President ; [PER William Haynes  ] , former [ORG DOD General Counsel  ] ; [PER Douglas Feith  ] , former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy ; [PER Jay Bybee  ] , former head of the [ORG DOJ Office of Legal Counsel  ] ; and [PER John Yoo  ] , a former member of [LOC Bybee’s  ] staff . 
The [ORG NGO  ] claimed that [LOC Spain  ] had a duty to open a “universal jurisdiction” case because five [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees are either [MISC Spanish  ] citizens or were/are [MISC Spanish  ] residents . 
Although he seemed displeased to have this dropped in his lap , Chief Prosecutor [PER Javier Zaragoza  ] on April 1 privately told [ORG Embassy  ] officials the complaint - at first glance - appeared well-documented and in all likelihood he would have no option but to open a case. //ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWS INTENSIVE [ORG USG  ] OUTREACH// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Following revelations by the [MISC Spanish  ] press that the complaint had been filed , the Acting DCM on March 31 and April 1 phoned FM Moratinos’ Chief of Staff [PER Agustin Santos  ] , and MOJ Director General for [ORG International Judicial Cooperation Aurora Mejia  ] about the matter . 
Both expressed their concern at the case but stressed the independence of the [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary . 
The [MISC A/DCM  ] stressed to both that this was a very serious matter for the [ORG USG  ] and asked that the [ORG Embassy  ] be kept informed of any developments . 
[PER MADRID  ] 00000392 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As reported in REF A , Senator [PER Judd Gregg  ] , accompanied by the Charge d’Affaires , raised the issue with [PER Luis Felipe Fernandez  ] de [PER la Pena  ] , Director General Policy Director for [LOC North America  ] and [LOC Europe  ] during a visit to the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MFA  ] on April 13 . 
Senator [PER Gregg  ] expressed his concern about the case . 
[PER Fernandez  ] de [PER la Pena  ] lamented this development , adding that judicial independence notwithstanding , the [ORG MFA  ] disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zaragoza  ] on April 14 called [ORG Embassy  ] Madrid’s [ORG FSN Legal Adviser  ] and informed her that a more thorough study had revealed that the complaint was targeted against legal advisors with no executive authority and that it was legally difficult to establish what type of offense the six had committed and the degree to which they participated in the alleged offenses . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said the complaint lacked details and was directed against [ORG USG  ] policy rather than a specific perpetrator . 
He said he would ask [PER Conde Pumpido  ] to review whether [LOC Spain  ] has jurisdiction in this case and indicated that he hoped the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG AG  ] would draft a clear set of rules on how and when [LOC Spain  ] should prosecute universal jurisdiction complaints. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As reported in [LOC SEPTEL  ] , Senator [PER Mel Martinez  ] , accompanied by the Charge d’Affaires , met Acting FM [PER Angel Lossada  ] during a visit to the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG MFA  ] on April 15 . 
[PER Martinez  ] and the Charge underscored that the prosecutions would not be understood or accepted in the [LOC U.S.  ] and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship . 
The Senator also asked if the [ORG GOS  ] had thoroughly considered the source of the material on which the allegations were based to ensure the charges were not based on misinformation or factually wrong statements . 
[PER Lossada  ] responded that the [ORG GOS  ] recognized all of the complications presented by universal jurisdiction , but that the independence of the judiciary and the process must be respected . 
The [ORG GOS  ] would use all appropriate legal tools in the matter . 
While it did not have much margin to operate , the [ORG GOS  ] would advise [PER Conde Pumpido  ] that the official administration position was that the [ORG GOS  ] was “not in accord with the [ORG National Court.”  ] [PER Lossada  ] reiterated to [PER Martinez  ] that the executive branch of government could not close any judicial investigation and urged that this case not affect the overall relationship , adding that our interests were much broader , and that the universal jurisdiction case should not be viewed as a reflection of the [ORG GOS  ] position. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , the [ORG Embassy  ] has been involved in [MISC DOJ-led  ] talks to have [PER Zaragoza  ] - who attended the April 16 press conference - lead a four-person team of [ORG GOS  ] officials to [LOC Washington  ] for a possible meeting with [LOC U.S.  ] Deputy AG [PER David Ogden  ] or AG [PER Eric Holder  ] during the week of May 18 . 
Zaragoza’s wife , who is [ORG Conde Pumpido’s  ] chief of staff , would reportedly be one of the four. //COMMENT// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Although not legally binding on the [ORG National Court  ] , [ORG Conde Pumpido’s  ] announcement puts pressure on crusading judge [PER Garzon  ] , who has not yet accepted the case , not to proceed with the investigation . 
As described in REF B , [PER Zaragoza  ] has indicated to Post - and reconfirmed this in his April 14 phone call in [LOC Para 3  ] - that he would argue that the case should not be assigned to [PER Garzon  ] and instead would recommend that Garzon’s colleague , Investigating Judge [PER Ismael Moreno  ] , should be assigned the case . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said the case ties in with [LOC Moreno’s  ] ongoing investigations into alleged illegal “CIA flights” that have transited [LOC Spain  ] carrying detainees to [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] acknowledges that [PER Garzon  ] has the “right of first refusal , ” but has told Post that if [PER Garzon  ] [ORG MADRID  ] 00000392 003.2 OF 003 disregards his recommendation and takes the case , the prosecutor will appeal . 
When a judge disagrees with the prosecutor on how or what to investigate , then the prosecutor has the right to appeal to a higher court , in this case the [ORG National Court’s Criminal Chamber  ] , led by [PER Javier Gomez Bermudez  ] . 
During this period in which the jurisdiction of the case is in question , [PER Garzon  ] could still proceed with the case , including preparing MLATs to question to the accused , formally naming the accused as defendants , and issuing arrest warrants against them . 
Investigating judges in [LOC Spain  ] , including and especially [PER Garzon  ] , have used this tactic frequently , particularly when these actions are popular with sizable segments of the [MISC Spanish  ] population . 
This worst-case scenario remains a possibility at this point . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] has also told us that if a proceeding regarding this matter were underway in the [LOC U.S.  ] , that would effectively bar proceedings in [LOC Spain  ] . 
We intend to further explore this option with him informally ( asking about format , timing , how much information he would need , etc . 
) while making it clear that the [ORG USG  ] has not made a decision to follow this course of action .
