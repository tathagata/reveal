( [LOC S//NF  ] ) As noted in [ORG REF  ] A , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] relationship with [LOC Cuba  ] continues to intensify . 
Thousands of personnel sent by the [MISC Cuban  ] Government are involved in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] health sector and other [ORG BRV  ] social missions . 
[MISC Cubans  ] cooperate extensively with [MISC Venezuelan  ] intelligence services . 
[MISC Cubans  ] may also participate heavily in the [ORG BRV  ] 's efforts to naturalize foreigners and provide documentation for citizens , according to various reports from Embassy contacts . 
Cubans' roles in the military are less clear but probably are also less significant. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Venezuelans' views of individual [MISC Cubans  ] are mixed . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] appears to be trying to promote the involvement of [MISC Cubans  ] in [MISC Venezuelan  ] society , although he has proceeded slowly and carefully . 
Anti-Chavez politicians have barked up the wrong tree by decrying [MISC Cuban  ] communism and sovereignty violations , issues that simply do not resonate with poor [MISC Venezuelans  ] . 
While the economic impact of [MISC Cubans  ] working in [LOC Venezuela  ] may be limited , [MISC Cuban  ] intelligence has much to offer to [LOC Venezuela  ] 's anti-U.S. intelligence services . 
End Summary. ---------------- How Many [MISC Cubans  ] ? ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Although the numbers of [MISC Cubans  ] sent by the [ORG GOC  ] to work in [LOC Venezuela  ] are significant , the exact figures are difficult to establish . 
Embassy officers have noted regular flights of [MISC Cubans--or Venezuelans  ] returning from official visits to Cuba--at [LOC Caracas  ] 's [LOC Maiquetia  ] airport . 
According to a DOD analysis of flight activity , an average of about 350 people arrive on three to five commercial or military flights from [LOC Cuba  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] per day . 
Most of these flights land at [LOC Maiquetia  ] , but [LOC Barcelona  ] and [LOC Maracaibo  ] are also common destinations . 
Post cannot determine how many [MISC Cubans  ] are on the flights or how many passengers stay in [LOC Venezuela  ] permanently . 
Airport officials spirit passengers through the building without stopping in customs or immigration . 
[LOC ONIDEX  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG National Office of Identification and Immigration  ] , reports that it naturalized only 12 [MISC Cubans  ] out of a group of 22,664 persons naturalized in December 2005 . 
Whether or not they enjoy [MISC Venezuelan  ] citizenship , however , thousands of [MISC Cubans  ] have [MISC Venezuelan  ] documentation . 
In addition to the over 20,000 [MISC Cubans  ] involved in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] health sector ( see below ) , less reliable reports indicate that thousands more are active in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] interior . 
[PER Manuel Rosales  ] , the opposition Governor of [LOC Zulia State  ] , told the [ORG DCM  ] in October 2005 that 20,000 [MISC Cubans  ] resided in [LOC Zulia  ] alone . 
Former [ORG National Assembly  ] deputy [PER Pedro Pablo Alcantara  ] ( [ORG Accion Democratica  ] ) told us in October that [PER Lara State  ] had the most [MISC Cubans  ] per capita in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He claimed more flights from [LOC Havana  ] arrived in [LOC Barquisimeto  ] , [PER Lara  ] than in [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000219 002 OF 006 [LOC Caracas  ] . 
Complicating the matter further are some 30,000 [MISC Cuban  ] exiles in [LOC Venezuela  ] , the [MISC Cuban  ] exile [PER NGO Net  ] for [LOC Cuba  ] estimates. ------ Health ------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG BRV  ] created [ORG Mision Barrio Adentro  ] ( Inside the [LOC Neighborhood Mission  ] ) to provide basic health care for disadvantaged neighborhoods in December 2003 , shortly after signing a bilateral agreement with [LOC Cuba  ] to swap oil for medical services . 
As of mid-2005 , about 21,000 [MISC Cuban  ] physicians , nurses , and support staff along with some 6,000 [MISC Venezuelan  ] personnel staffed the mission , according to the [ORG Ministry of Communication  ] . 
Mission clinics are small , two-story hexagonal structures that also house two to three doctors . 
The [ORG BRV  ] provides the clinics' equipment and reduced-cost medicines . 
Through [PER Barrio Adentro  ] , the [ORG BRV  ] identifies patients eligible for [ORG Mision Milagro  ] ( [LOC Miracle Mission  ] ) , which flies [MISC Venezuelans  ] to [LOC Havana  ] for cataract surgery . 
Anecdotal reporting suggests the care [MISC Cuban  ] doctors provide is often lacking and that many " physicians " are actually medical students . 
The [ORG BRV  ] has recently begun [ORG Mision Barrio Adentro II  ] , a network of more advanced diagnostic centers and inpatient clinics to be administered and staffed mostly by [PER Venezuelans.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding the 90,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil [LOC Venezuela  ] provides [LOC Cuba  ] per day on barter terms , [MISC Cuban  ] doctors earn relatively little . 
According to press reports , [MISC Cuban  ] doctors receive salaries of up to [ORG USD  ] 400 per month , a figure slightly lower than local averages . 
A [MISC Cuban  ] physician told Post 's medical advisor , however , that he received room , board , and toiletries but that the [MISC Cuban  ] Government was " holding " his salary until he finished his two-year tour . 
Some [MISC Cuban  ] doctors have " deserted " and fled . 
A [MISC European  ] diplomat told polcouns in mid-January 2006 that the number of [MISC Cuban  ] asylum requests received by [ORG EU  ] missions in [LOC Venezuela  ] had increased over the past few months . 
A local legislator with extensive contacts in poor neighborhoods told us in November 2005 that [MISC Cuban  ] doctors complained bitterly that the [MISC Cuban  ] regime held their families hostage while the doctors relied on local donations to survive . 
In contrast , according to [ORG REF  ] B , the [ORG GOC  ] receives from [LOC Venezuela  ] between [ORG USD  ] 1,000 to 5,000 for each [ORG Mision Milagro  ] cataract operation , which is comparable to the roughly [ORG USD  ] 3,500 that a [MISC Venezuelan  ] private clinic would charge for the procedure. ------------ Intelligence ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) Sensitive reports indicate [MISC Cuban  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] intelligence ties are so advanced that the two countries' agencies appear to be competing with each other for the [ORG BRV  ] 's attention . 
[MISC Cuban  ] intelligence officers have direct access to [PER Chavez  ] and frequently provide him with intelligence reporting unvetted by [MISC Venezuelan  ] officers . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services  ] ( [ORG DISIP  ] ) , moreover , may be taking advice from [MISC Cuban  ] intelligence on the formation of a new intelligence service ( [ORG REF  ] C ) . 
[MISC Cuban  ] intelligence officers train [MISC Venezuelans  ] both in [LOC Cuba  ] and in [LOC Venezuela  ] , providing both political indoctrination and operational [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000219 003 OF 006 instruction . 
They also may work in other [MISC Venezuelan  ] government ministries , unconfirmed sensitive reporting suggests. -------- Military -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Post has received no credible reports of extensive [MISC Cuban  ] involvement in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] military , despite the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Armed Forces' attempts to imitate [MISC Cuban  ] military doctrine and uniforms . 
According to [ORG DAO  ] reports , [MISC Cubans  ] train and advise [MISC Chavez'  ] military security detail . 
Anti-Chavez military officers have told us that [MISC Cubans  ] hold liaison and personnel exchange positions within the [MISC Venezuelan  ] military formerly held by [MISC European  ] and other [MISC Latin American  ] officers . 
Moreover , a few [MISC Venezuelan  ] military officers--along with some from the Foreign Ministry--undergo ideological training in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] has also sent a military team to [LOC Cuba  ] construct a complex of 150 houses , according to press reports. -------------- Other Sectors ? -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) [MISC Cuban  ] involvement in other agencies and missions is harder to confirm . 
[MISC Cubans  ] have been heavily involved in [LOC ONIDEX  ] , according to various unconfirmed sources . 
A local academic with a background in electoral systems told poloff that [MISC Venezuelans  ] trained in [LOC Cuba  ] helped expand the national electoral registry by over two million voters through [ORG Mision Identidad  ] ( Identity Mission ) in 2003 . 
He added that the [MISC Venezuelan  ] process to receive an identity card was a carbon copy of the [MISC Cuban  ] process . 
Anti-Chavez military officers told us in July 2005 that [MISC Cubans  ] helped run [LOC ONIDEX  ] and reported that an active duty army colonel was running an operation to print identity cards for [MISC Cubans  ] . 
According to an Embassy employee with access to secure areas of [LOC Caracas' Maiquetia  ] airport , [MISC Cubans  ] hold supervisory positions at the airport 's auxiliary terminal . 
[MISC Cubans  ] also have established and continue to service the airport 's biometrics equipment , according to sensitive reports . 
Some anecdotal sensitive reporting further suggests [MISC Cuban  ] officials had a [MISC Venezuelan  ] officer dismissed for resisting their attempts to take temporary operational control over a section of the airport during a visit of [MISC Cuban  ] leader [PER Fidel Castro.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Ruben Flores  ] , the editor of a rancher newspaper , told poloff in early 2005 that [MISC Cuban  ] involvement in the agricultural sector was second only to that in the health sector . 
Such a claim may be exaggerated , but [MISC Cubans  ] are likely involved to a great extent . 
According to the Agricultural Attache , [MISC Cuban  ] officials hold senior positions in the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] and also operate in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] interior . 
Citing technical experts in the [ORG Ministry , Flores  ] told us in January 2006 that [MISC Cuban  ] officials were helping design [LOC Venezuela  ] 's " Planting Plan 2006 , " which would prescribe the crops to be sown in each region . 
[PER Jaime Perez Branger  ] , head of the company that owns cattle ranch and nature preserve [PER Hato Pinero  ] , told us in January that [MISC Cubans  ] advised the [ORG BRV  ] on agricultural productivity and on setting up cooperatives in such missions as [PER Vuelvan Caras  ] . 
( [PER Vuelvan Caras  ] , or " About Face , " is a [ORG BRV  ] program offering six months [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000219 004 OF 006 of job training , after which participants form cooperatives , often in the agricultural sector . 
) [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC South America  ] 's only net importer of agricultural products , is also setting up [MISC Cuban  ] sugar mills in [LOC Venezuela  ] in the wake of [LOC Cuba  ] 's failing sugar industry. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Industry contacts have told the Agricultural Attache that [MISC Cubans  ] helped design and manage [PER Mision Mercal  ] , the [ORG BRV  ] 's subsidized grocery program . 
An [ORG Arthur D. Little  ] consultant told us in February 2005 that a [MISC Cuban  ] vice minister of commerce works with [PER Mercal  ] full-time . 
[PER Flores  ] told poloff in January 2006 that ALIMPORT , [LOC Cuba  ] 's agency that handles all food imports , was advising the [ORG BRV  ] on food distribution . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] finances some of its own food imports through a [LOC Havana  ] branch of the [ORG Industrial Bank of Venezuela  ] , and [MISC Chavez'  ] brother [PER Adan Chavez  ] , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] Ambassador there , may profit illicitly from the loan process , according to [ORG DAO  ] reporting ( [ORG REF  ] D ) . -------------------------- [MISC Venezuelan  ] Views of [MISC Cubans  ] -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Cuban  ] citizens' resentment of [MISC Venezuelans  ] ( [ORG REF  ] A ) is not completely mutual . 
Some [MISC Venezuelans  ] , including many who experienced the infiltration of violent [MISC Cuban  ] revolutionaries during the 1960s , do dislike [MISC Cubans  ] . 
The average [MISC Venezuelan  ] 's view of [MISC Cubans  ] , however , is more nuanced . 
Some poor [MISC Venezuelans  ] admire [MISC Cubans  ] involved in the missions for providing free services . 
Others , while disapproving of their political system , appreciate [MISC Cuban  ] culture displayed by individual [MISC Cubans  ] , especially those among the exile community. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chavez  ] appears to be trying to promote a friendly image of [MISC Cubans  ] . 
[MISC Cubans  ] have appeared increasingly on public television , including on [MISC Chavez'  ] " [PER Alo Presidente  ] " show . 
Images of crossed [MISC Cuban  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] flags have also begun to appear in [LOC Caracas  ] . 
The polling firm Datanalisis reports that [MISC Chavez'  ] recent attempts to " sell " the [MISC Cuban  ] political model may have increased [MISC Venezuelans'  ] rejection of the [MISC Cuban  ] regime from May 2005 ( 63 percent ) to October 2005 ( 81 percent ) . 
( Embassy note: Whether [MISC Chavez'  ] promotion of [LOC Cuba  ] is paying off or backfiring is unclear . 
Answers to [MISC Datanalisis'  ] question , " what do you think of [LOC Venezuela  ] taking the [MISC Cuban  ] regime as a model , " may reflect a growing sense of nationalism and uniqueness among Venezuelans--consistent with [MISC Chavez'  ] calls for a " new socialism " --rather than a rejection of [MISC Cubans  ] . 
Indeed , almost half of the [PER Chavez  ] supporters polled , who would seem least likely to oppose [LOC Cuba  ] , responded negatively . 
) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the increasing publicity , signs of [MISC Cuban-Venezuelan  ] partnership in [LOC Caracas  ] are not as ubiquitous as they apparently are in [LOC Havana  ] , and [MISC Cubans  ] generally keep a low profile . 
[MISC Chavez'  ] sense of self-importance may partly explain why [LOC Cuba  ] figures less prominently . 
The " [ORG Bolivarian Alternative for Latin America  ] " is not a synonym for [MISC Cuban-Venezuelan  ] cooperation in [LOC Venezuela  ] because [PER Chavez  ] pitches it as a movement he has launched throughout the hemisphere . 
[PER Chavez  ] features call-ins from [PER Castro  ] during his public appearances , such as a mid-January 2006 sendoff for [MISC Venezuelans  ] going to study medicine in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Nonetheless , [PER Chavez  ] does not part with the spotlight for long . 
His weekly [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000219 005 OF 006 " [PER Alo Presidente  ] " broadcasts routinely run longer than five hours. ---------------------------- The Opposition Has Failed... ---------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Some of [MISC Chavez'  ] opponents appear to be trying to inflame a prejudice against [MISC Cubans  ] that is uncommon among [MISC Venezuelans  ] . 
They rant about " [MISC Cuban  ] invaders " and " sovereignty violations " that resonate little with the [MISC Venezuelan  ] poor . 
Opposition politicians also berate [PER Chavez  ] for attempting to introduce [MISC Cuban  ] communism , although few [MISC Venezuelans  ] believe he will do so . 
Former opposition [ORG National Assembly  ] deputy [PER Carlos Casanova  ] ( [ORG Socialdemocrata  ] ) told poloff the public 's response to the opposition was " look around , this isn't communism , chico ! 
" Still , over-the-top critiques can impede focused criticism . 
Asked how the opposition could exploit opposition to [MISC Chavez'  ] oil " loans " to [LOC Cuba  ] , [ORG Accion Democratica  ] 's former international relations secretary [PER Alfredo Coronil  ] replied to poloff that [LOC Cuba  ] was SIPDIS planning to intervene in [LOC Africa  ] after [LOC Venezuela  ] , brushing aside poloff 's remark that [LOC Cuba  ] could hardly still afford adventurism on a [MISC Cold War  ] scale. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The political opposition does little to exploit alleged medical malpractice in [ORG Mision Barrio Adentro  ] or to report on returning [ORG Mision Milagro  ] patients' impressions of [LOC Cuba  ] . 
In fact , much of the opposition remains ignorant of how such missions work because it does not reach out to poor neighborhoods for the most part . 
One anti-Chavez retired military officer , however , told poloff in June 2005 that groups of [MISC Venezuelan  ] doctors had begun treating people in poor areas with the support of certain pharmacies . 
The scope of the initiative is unclear. ----------------------------------- ...But Finally Getting the Picture ? ----------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [PER Primero Justicia  ] ( [ORG PJ  ] ) has been the only political party to criticize [PER Chavez  ] consistently for his handouts to other countries . 
Promising additional programs to redistribute oil wealth , [ORG PJ  ] presidential candidate [PER Julio Borges  ] has asked the [ORG BRV  ] to explain why ordinary [MISC Venezuelans  ] are not receiving the money sent to [LOC Cuba  ] , according to press reports . 
With the closure of the [ORG Caracas-La Guaira  ] bridge , other elements of the opposition are also beginning to contrast [ORG BRV  ] gifts abroad with problems at home . 
An internet blog site has displayed the amounts spent on foreign infrastructure next to photos of the crumbling bridge . 
During its assembly in mid-January 2006 , the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG Episcopal Conference  ] criticized grants and loans the [ORG BRV  ] had awarded overseas. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The economic impact of [MISC Cubans  ] in [LOC Venezuela  ] is mixed but limited . 
( [MISC Venezuelan  ] subsidies to [LOC Cuba  ] , on the other hand , could eventually pose greater problems for the [ORG BRV  ] ( [ORG SEPTEL  ] ) . 
) By helping the [ORG BRV  ] pad its voter rolls and naturalize suspicious immigrants , [MISC Cubans  ] are doing jobs that [LOC CARACAS  ] 00000219 006 OF 006 [MISC Venezuelan  ] government personnel could and would do in their absence . 
[MISC Cuban  ] doctors , however , are treating communities mostly unreached by [MISC Venezuelan  ] health services . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] continues to purchase costly conventional weapons systems despite the influence on paper of [LOC Cuba  ] 's " asymmetric " warfare doctrine. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [LOC S//NF  ] ) The impact of [MISC Cuban  ] involvement in [MISC Venezuelan  ] intelligence could impact [LOC U.S.  ] interests directly . 
[MISC Venezuelan  ] intelligence services are among the most hostile towards the [LOC United States  ] in the hemisphere , but they lack the expertise that [MISC Cuban  ] services can provide . 
[MISC Cuban  ] intelligence routinely provides the [ORG BRV  ] intelligence reports about the activities of the [ORG USG  ] . 
[MISC Cuban  ] dissemination of ideological propaganda in [LOC Venezuela  ] is less of a threat . 
[PER Chavez  ] , the revolution 's most effective proponent , still appears to be involving [MISC Cubans  ] in public discourse and [ORG BRV  ] projects with some discretion.</pre></code>
