( S ) Several [MISC Istanbul-based  ] contacts of [ORG ConGen Istanbul  ] 's [ORG NEA Iran  ] Watcher have separately cautioned us in the past week that they been asked ( or warned ) by [MISC Iranian  ] officials to cease contact with " [MISC American  ] diplomats asking questions about [LOC Iran  ] . 
" In one case , a key contact -- XXXXXXXXXXXX-- is returning temporarily to [LOC Iran  ] to " clear everything up . 
" Comment: A number of [ORG State Iran-Watchers' Iran-based  ] contacts have suffered harassment , intimidation , and detention since the post-election crackdown . 
Reporting from [ORG IRPO Dubai  ] and others underscores the likelihood that regime pressure on [MISC Iranians  ] with [LOC U.S.  ] or western links will only worsen . 
These recent warnings to our [MISC Istanbul-based  ] contacts , however , may represent a new element in this campaign of intimidation , and reconfirms that the regime pays attention to our outreach efforts outside [LOC Iran  ] . 
In response , we will take additional steps to protect local contacts and stay vigilant against regime efforts to track our interactions with them , while redoubling efforts to expand the range of [MISC Turkey-based  ] contacts willing to share Iran-related insights . 
End comment. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In the past week , we heard separately from three valuable [MISC Istanbul-based  ] contacts that they each received recent requests or warnings from [MISC Iranian  ] officials to limit or cease contacts with [MISC American  ] diplomats in [LOC Istanbul.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) A [LOC UK  ] national who has worked as the [LOC Istanbul  ] correspondent for [LOC Iran  ] 's satellite news channel " Press TV " since summer 2007 and has been willing to share insights into Press TV and [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting  ] ( [ORG IRIB  ] ) editorial and press operations ( ref d ) , told us that her [MISC Tehran-based  ] editor warned her last week to stop having contact with " any [MISC American  ] diplomats there asking about [LOC Iran  ] . 
" She speculated that [MISC Iranian  ] consulate officials in [LOC Istanbul  ] may have seen her talking to [ORG ConGen Istanbul  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] Watcher at any number of recent functions and , as they are presumably aware of [ORG ConGen Istanbul Iran  ] Watcher 's portfolio , they may have sent word back to Press TV management to warn her off of such contacts . 
She told us her response to her editor was that as a journalist her job is to gather information from all informed sources in [LOC Istanbul  ] including diplomats , and that any contact she has with [LOC U.S.  ] or other diplomats in [LOC Istanbul  ] is strictly in support of her own reporting . 
She told us that because she is a [LOC UK  ] citizen and living in [LOC Turkey  ] , and considers herself one of Press TV 's best international correspondents , she is not afraid of pressure from Press TV management since " the worst they can do is fire me , which they won't . 
" ( Comment: In an incident that may or may not have been related , but that this contact found suspicious , her apartment was broken into on June 26 and her laptop was stolen , though her purse , jewelry , and other valuables were left alone . 
) She expressed a willingness to continue occasional contacts with us , though [LOC ISTANBUL  ] 00000352 002 OF 002 we agreed not to have contacts at conferences or other fora where [MISC Iranian  ] consulate officials might be present. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) We recently contacted the coordinator for the [ORG Turkish-Iran Business Council  ] ( ref b ) , responsible for setting up the [ORG TIBC  ] 's frequent meetings and trade fairs with [MISC Iranian  ] counterparts . 
He is a [MISC Turkish  ] national who has been a helpful contact since late 2007 . 
We contacted him to request a meeting with the [ORG TIBC  ] to discuss recent developments in [MISC Turkish-Iranian  ] commercial relations , in advance of a biannual " [ORG Turkish-Iranian Business Council Forum  ] " next month in [LOC Tehran  ] and [LOC Mashhad  ] . 
Our contact told us by email that two members of the [ORG TIBC  ] 's executive board were queried by " [MISC Iranian  ] acquaintances of theirs " ( [ORG NFI  ] ) at a [PER Ramadan Iftar  ] dinner ceremony at the [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador to [LOC Turkey  ] 's residence last week about the [ORG TIBC  ] 's contacts with the [ORG US Consulate  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] , including what specific questions we have asked the [ORG TIBC  ] about Iran-Turkey commerce . 
Our contact did not know how the [MISC Iranian  ] Embassy was aware of the [ORG TIBC  ] 's occasional meetings with us . 
( Comment: We have met about six times with [ORG TIBC  ] executive board members , including a November 2008 courtesy call on the board by [ORG NEA/IR 's Office  ] Director ; additionally , [ORG ConGen Istanbul  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] Watcher has met numerous times socially with this contact , usually for coffee at a local cafe . 
End comment . 
) He said a [ORG TIBC  ] board member told him they brushed aside the [MISC Iranian  ] queries , but they also cautioned him that the [ORG TIBC  ] needs to be more careful in ensuring that its [MISC Iranian  ] partners are not given a reason " to doubt our commitment to expanding bilateral commerce while staying out of politics . 
" This contact pledged to try to help set up a meeting for us with the [ORG TIBC  ] executive board , but declined an offer to meet socially in the near-term . 
Comment ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Comment: A number of [ORG State Department  ] " [ORG Iran Watchers  ] " and others have seen both professional contacts and friends in [LOC Iran  ] suffer harassment , intimidation and in many cases detention and worse , especially following the recent , post-election crackdown on [MISC Mousavi  ] supporters and others activists . 
Reporting from [ORG IRPO Dubai  ] and elsewhere underscores the likelihood that the regime will only intensify the crackdown against [MISC Iranians  ] who have [LOC U.S.  ] and western contacts . 
However , these recent warnings to our [MISC Istanbul-based  ] contacts may represent a new element in this campaign of intimidation . 
These examples are a clear indication that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime is aware of at least some of our [MISC Istanbul-based  ] contacts' interactions with us , and willing to use varying degrees of pressure -- even against non-Iranians over whom it has some leverage -- to try or limit to stop further contact with us . 
( Overt [MISC Iranian  ] physical intimidation against contacts in [LOC Turkey  ] , however , is unlikely , as it would cross a red-line not crossed since the GOT expelled then-Iranian Ambassador [PER Mottaki  ] -- now [LOC Iran  ] 's Foreign Minister -- in 1989 for playing a likely role in the kidnapping and/or assassination of several dozen [MISC Iranian  ] dissidents in [LOC Turkey  ] in the mid and late 1980s . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Engaging with Iran-related contacts , even in [LOC Turkey  ] , has always been a sensitive undertaking , but now it is becoming even more so . 
In response , we make every effort to try to protect our local contacts , take additional measures to ensure confidentiality in our meetings with them , and remain vigilant against [MISC Iranian  ] efforts to track our interactions with them . 
But we will also redouble efforts to maintain , and even expand , the range of contacts in [LOC Turkey  ] willing to brave such threats to share valuable insights with us .
