( C ) The [ORG CDA  ] paid a courtesy call November 18 on [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] or [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) Secretary-General ( Deputy Minister ) [PER Antonio Patriota  ] . 
[PER Patriota  ] has just taken up his duties following three years as [LOC Brazil  ] , s ambassador to [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Patriota  ] said he sees great potential for [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations to develop , but stressed the need for high-level USG visits and a comprehensive strategic bilateral mechanism in order to avoid the appearance of neglect and to minimize the negative affects on [LOC U.S.-Latin America  ] relations of the [LOC Honduras  ] situation and the [LOC U.S.-Colombia  ] bases agreement . 
[PER Patriota  ] raised concerns about a pending [ORG Tropical Forests Conservation Act  ] agreement and defended [LOC Brazil  ] , s invitation to [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ( reftel ) . 
Unlike his anti-American and obstructionist predecessor , [PER Patriota  ] is eager to engage the [LOC United States  ] . 
But he will do so on the basis of a traditional [ORG Itamaraty  ] nationalist perspective that remains cautious and often suspicious regarding [LOC U.S.  ] actions and motives . 
End summary. - - - High-Level Visits , Dialogue , Thinking Needed in Relationship - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Patriota  ] began by saying -- and repeated twice more over the course of the conversation -- how important it is for U/S [PER Bill Burns  ] to visit [LOC Brazil  ] before the end of the year , so that [LOC Brazil  ] can receive Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and President [PER Lula  ] early in 2010 . 
He noted that President [PER Lula  ] will be traveling a great deal in the first semester of 2010 , and that the second semester will be out of the question in light of [LOC Brazil  ] , s October elections . 
[PER Patriota  ] said the high-level visits are important for the tone of the relationship with [LOC Latin America  ] as a whole , and [LOC Brazil  ] in particular . 
They will allow our differences to be seen within a larger , and overall , positive context . 
Although he has been the first to stress quality of contact over quantity , he said there is a growing sense of neglect , which is made worse by disagreements over [LOC Honduras  ] and the [LOC U.S.-Colombia  ] base agreement . 
" We need new developments , " he said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG CDA  ] asked [PER Patriota  ] , s views on the prospects for the relationship . 
[PER Patriota  ] said he thought the relationship could " go very far , " but that it will require new , creative thinking on both sides . 
He identified trilateral cooperation in [LOC Africa  ] , defense , the [ORG Joint Action Plan  ] to Eliminate Racial Discrimination , [ORG UN Security Council  ] matters ( in particular , peacekeeping and post-conflict situations ) , and the [LOC Middle East  ] as areas where [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] cooperation could grow . 
The relationship needs to be more strategic , he said , which is why it is so important to create a " comprehensive mechanism " to provide our various bilateral dialogues with " strategic direction from policymakers . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Patriota  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] will not " privilege one relationship to the detriment of others . 
" But he said he has great admiration for President [PER Obama  ] as he addresses the recession and the healthcare in the [LOC United States  ] , and that our countries should " work more on what [PER Obama  ] represents to the world: an effort to unite people , rather than separate the world into 'good guys and bad guys' . 
" - - - Concerns about [MISC TFCA  ] - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In addition to raising the upcoming visit of [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ( septel ) , the [ORG CDA  ] asked about prospects for concluding a [MISC TFCA  ] agreement by [ORG Treasury  ] 's deadline of November 30 . 
( Note: The [MISC TFCA  ] agreement has been in negotiation for over two years , and had sat for months on the desk of [PER Patriota  ] , s predecessor . 
End note . 
) [PER Patriota  ] said [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001342 002 OF 002 that [ORG MRE  ] had no problems with the agreement , but " other agencies " had concerns about the agreement . 
For example , the [ORG GOB  ] did not want funds going to projects in the [LOC Amazon  ] , and wanted only [MISC Brazilian  ] NGOs and agencies to have access to the funds . 
He said that [LOC Brazil  ] would present a " counter-proposal " within a week . 
( Comment: Post has since received and sent to [ORG Treasury  ] a non-paper outlining generally the concerns . 
It is not yet clear whether these can be addressed before the deadline . 
End comment . 
) - - - [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] Bases Not Positive for [MISC U.S. Relations  ] - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG CDA  ] asked how [PER Patriota  ] saw the situation in [LOC Honduras  ] shaping up . 
[PER Patriota  ] said that the situation was " not positive for relations between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] . 
" Some sort of " fig-leaf " was required to allow [PER Zelaya  ] , s reinstatement prior to elections by a sufficient margin for all to " save face . 
" For example , the elections could be moved back , allowing [PER Zelaya  ] to resume office for " at least a couple of weeks " before they occur . 
Without such a solution , [LOC Brazil  ] would be unable to recognize the elections . 
[PER Patriota  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] does not want this issue to create difficulties between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] , and was heartened that [ORG WHA A/S Valenzuela  ] had agreed in their meeting the previous week with [LOC Brazil  ] , s view that the [LOC Micheletti  ] regime was not fulfilling the deal struck with [PER Zelaya.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG CDA  ] raised the [LOC U.S.-Colombia  ] bases agreement , saying we the text of that agreement made clear , and we had reiterated to the [ORG GOB  ] on many occasions , that our bilateral work with [LOC Colombia  ] to fight terrorism and drug trafficking was only within [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER Patriota  ] responded that the issue has more to do with [LOC Colombia  ] than the [LOC United States  ] . 
It is [LOC Colombia  ] that needs to convince its neighbors of its peaceful intentions , and [LOC Colombia  ] should agree to a [MISC South America-wide  ] agreement against military activity , as transparency on this issue would benefit [LOC Colombia  ] as well as others . 
Furthermore , [LOC Colombia  ] needs to reach out to [LOC Brazil  ] , in particular , as its inability to manage relations with [LOC Brazil  ] is making other countries wary of its intentions . 
He noted as a positive sign that President [PER Uribe  ] had agreed to attend a regional summit in [LOC Manaus  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] had called to discuss the [LOC Amazon  ] , and that this would provide an opportunity to discuss the bases issue , as well. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Patriota  ] is a definite improvement over his predecessor , the anti-American and obstructionist [PER Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , who was made Minister of [ORG Strategic Planning  ] when he hit mandatory retirement age for the diplomatic corps this month . 
Nonetheless , although [PER Patriota  ] knows the [LOC United States  ] well and is ready to engage us , he will do so not from a pro-American perspective , but on the basis of a traditional [ORG Itamaraty  ] nationalist perspective , in line with the views of FM [ORG Amorim  ] , that remains cautious and often suspicious regarding [LOC U.S.  ] actions and motives . 
Even in this brief courtesy call , [PER Patriota  ] made clear that , as [LOC Brazil  ] seeks engagement with the [LOC United States  ] , it will do so on its own terms .
