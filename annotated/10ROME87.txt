( C ) Staff Director of the [ORG House Foreign Affairs Committee  ] ( [ORG HCFA  ] ) Dr. [PER Richard Kessler  ] and [ORG HCFA  ] staff members probed senior [ORG MFA  ] and energy and gas parastatal [ORG Eni  ] officials on [LOC Italy  ] 's intentions concerning [LOC Iran  ] sanctions and prospects for effective multilateral action to curb [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
Opposition [ORG Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG PD  ] ) officials discussed [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Italy  ] 's role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [ORG MEPP  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and nonproliferation with the [ORG Staffdel  ] . 
End Summary . 
[LOC IRAN  ] DOMINATES [ORG MFA TALKS  ] ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A January 8 roundtable discussion with Dr. [PER Kessler  ] and three [ORG HCFA  ] staff members at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) included [ORG MFA  ] Director General for [ORG Multilateral Political Cooperation Stefano Ronca  ] , [PER Ronca  ] 's Deputy [PER Filippo Formica  ] , and Deputy DG for [ORG Economic Cooperation Claudio Spinedi  ] . 
Office Directors [PER Massimo Marotti  ] ( [ORG Political-Military Security  ] and [ORG NATO Affairs  ] ) ; [PER Diego Brasioli  ] ( [ORG G8 Issues  ] and Global Challenges ) ; and [PER Giovanni Pugliese  ] ( [ORG Arms Control and Nonproliferation  ] ) also participated . 
After the roundtable the [ORG Staffdel  ] had a meeting with [ORG MFA  ] Deputy SecGen and Political Director [PER Sandro De Bernardin  ] . 
Post was represented by the Charge , [PER Pol-Mil Counselor  ] and [PER Poloff  ] ( notetaker ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ronca  ] believes the deteriorating situation in [LOC Iran  ] will soon come to a head and that the [ORG UNSC  ] should convey to [LOC Iran  ] that delay tactics will not work and support this position by readiness to adopt further pressure . 
[PER Ronca  ] and [PER Spinedi  ] told the [ORG Staffdel Italy  ] is ready to explore , with its [ORG EU  ] colleagues , the possibility of further sanctions , which , however , must conform to [ORG EU  ] regulations , and not affect the legal rights of [MISC European  ] companies . 
[PER Ronca  ] suggested that the [MISC Iranian  ] financial , oil and gas , and insurance sectors ( but not the [ORG Central Bank  ] ) could be targeted and that the list sensitive products on the export ban list could be expanded. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Spinedi  ] , who ( with [PER Formica  ] ) attended the October 7 [LOC Washington  ] meeting of " [MISC Likeminded States  ] on [LOC Iran  ] , " started by briefly alluding to [LOC Italy  ] 's longstanding complaint of exclusion from P5 1 . 
[PER Spinedi  ] pointed out we needed to determine what kind of sanctions would be acceptable to [LOC China  ] and [LOC Russia  ] , adding that even at the beginning of January , [LOC China  ] 's [ORG UN  ] ambassador said that [LOC China  ] " needed more time , " which , [PER Spinedi  ] noted , was not a total rejection of tougher sanctions . 
[PER Spinedi  ] advocated strengthening what already exists and deciding where we are willing to exert additional pressure ( especially in the oil and gas sector ) . 
It would be important to determine which technologies others ( e.g. , [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] ) are willing to provide and embargo those which they cannot . 
[PER Spinedi  ] acknowledged that [LOC Italy  ] had not yet imposed legally binding sanctions , but that the [ORG GOI  ] had successfully used " moral suasion . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Spinedi  ] noted that sanctions proposed by the [LOC U.S.  ] at the October 7 [MISC Likeminded  ] meeting included targeting the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Revolutionary Guard Command  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) , but did not include an embargo of refined oil and gas products . 
[PER Spinedi  ] echoed [PER Ronca  ] in saying that in the coming months [LOC Italy  ] will need to see how the rest of the [LOC Europe  ] will approach new sanctions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] Deputy SecGen [PER Sandro De Bernardin  ] told the [ORG Staffdel  ] that [LOC Italy  ] was well aware of the danger posed by [LOC Iran  ] and supported a " firm line . 
" [PER De Bernardin  ] noted [ORG Eni  ] 's considerable investments in [LOC Iran  ] and characterized [LOC Italy  ] 's " moral suasion " efforts to wean [LOC Iran  ] away from its nuclear ambitions as a " significant success . 
" On sanctions , [PER De Bernardin  ] stated that [LOC Italy  ] was prepared to assume its " share of responsibility , " but that sanctions are a means of pressure , not a goal ; effective ones must be found . 
In [PER De Bernardin  ] 's view , U.S.domestic legislation should not negatively affect other countries and the presidential waiver has been useful in the past ; he hoped it will still figure in the future. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Kessler  ] encouraged [LOC Italy  ] to continue and reinforce [LOC ROME  ] 00000087 002.2 OF 003 their past efforts . 
[PER De Bernardin  ] agreed that if [LOC Iran  ] gets the bomb , then others will seek to acquire nuclear weapons too and that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime must realize there is a heavy price to be paid for persisting in non-compliance . 
" [PER De Bernardin  ] reiterated [LOC Italy  ] 's support for openess to dialogue in addition to pressure , or the dual-track approach , and that " putting [LOC Iran  ] in a corner " is not the same as " cutting it off " and characterized [LOC Italy  ] as a " crucial player , " essential to catalyzing consensus in [LOC Europe  ] . 
He added that , given [LOC Iran  ] 's critical domestic situation , the regime was not in a position to decide anything . 
KEY TO SUCCESS IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) With regard to the critical situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Ronca  ] acknowledged that we must strengthen the military aspect of the campaign , but that institution building and engaging President [PER Karzai  ] on fighting corruption must not be neglected . 
On the security side , [PER Ronca  ] said that [LOC Italy  ] will increase its force by 1000 men during the first half of 2010 and that its [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) training program is a first priority . 
As for civilian engagement , [LOC Italy  ] has committed 465 million euros in various civilian sectors , including health , education , and justice . 
[PER Ronca  ] and [PER Marotti  ] stressed the need for better coordination of civilian and military activities as an issue that should be on the agenda of the January 28 London [ORG NATO  ] conference . 
[PER Ronca  ] noted that reaching out to insurgents was a task that should also be pursued . 
The [MISC Italians  ] stressed the need for a long-term development strategy based on [MISC Afghan  ] priorities , but which would also include private sector involvement and the development of good governance . 
CENTER LEFT [ORG PD  ] AIRS FOREIGN POLICY POSITIONS -------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Head of the opposition [PER Partito Democratico  ] 's ( [ORG PD  ] ) [ORG Foreign Policy Department  ] [PER Piero Fassino  ] told the [ORG Staffdel  ] the [ORG PD  ] supports President [PER Obama  ] 's initiative to dialogue and build bridges with the [MISC Islamic  ] world , but is very concerned about the blocked [ORG MEPP  ] and the " new wave of terror " in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
As for [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG PD  ] supports pursuing a negotiated solution , but [PER Fassino  ] questioned whether the current leadership is in a position to negotiate credibly . 
He suggested it could be useful to change the order of priorities in [LOC Iran  ] ; that is , be more flexible on the nuclear issue , but harder on human rights . 
According to [PER Fassino  ] , the greatest risk with nuclear proliferation is that irresponsible governments like the one in [LOC Iran  ] could gain access to nuclear arms , adding that the [ORG PD  ] assessed that there was little to fear with nations such as [LOC India  ] , [LOC Britain  ] , and [LOC France  ] having nuclear weapons . 
He asked whether a democratic government in [LOC Iran  ] might not have a different position on the nuclear program. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Fassino  ] said the [ORG PD  ] supports the [ORG GOI  ] 's increased ( military ) support for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but stressed that strengthening civil and governmental institutions and economic development are equally important . 
On the [ORG MEPP  ] , [PER Fassino  ] characterized [PER Netanyahu  ] 's proposed 10-month settlement freeze " a little window of opportunity , " but questioned whether it was enough , given the [MISC Israelis'  ] refusal to discuss ( the status of ) [LOC Jerusalem  ] . 
As for [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Fassino  ] said the stabilization process must be supported ; there was no alternative . 
[ORG ENI  ] JUSTIFIES [LOC IRAN  ] ACTIVITIES ----------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Energy and gas parastatal [ORG Eni  ] ( [PER Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi  ] ) officials told the [ORG Congressional  ] delegation that it is cooperating to address [ORG USG  ] concerns over the company , s [LOC Iran  ] activities , but insisted that it will continue to fulfill its contractual obligations there . 
The company officials said that [ORG Eni  ] has understood the [ORG USG  ] message to reduce its presence in [LOC Iran  ] , and as a result it has already decreased its [LOC Iran  ] activities to a minimum level . 
The [ORG Eni  ] officials provided the [PER Staffdel  ] with a copy of the November 16 , 2009 CEO [PER Scaroni  ] letter to Ambassador [PER Thorne  ] that states the company , s position ( A copy of [ORG Eni  ] 's letter was provided to EEB in November ) . 
Referencing this letter , the officials pointed out that [ORG Eni  ] will not undertake new activities in [LOC Iran  ] , including no new activities by its subsidiaries , [ORG Saipem ROME  ] 00000087 003.2 OF 003 and [ORG Polimeri Europa  ] . 
They added that following [PER Scaroni  ] , s September 16 meetings in [LOC Washington  ] the company also gave up plans for an MOU with [LOC Iran  ] for development of the phase III of the [LOC Darquain  ] oil field . 
The officials stated that while [ORG EU  ] law prevents the [ORG Eni  ] from responding to official requests for information on its [LOC Iran  ] operations , it has been transparent in informing the [ORG USG  ] on a voluntary basis. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG Eni  ] officials stated , however , that [ORG Eni  ] intends to carry out exploration and development activities in [LOC Iran  ] that fall under its contractual obligations there . 
The officials acknowledged that this is a &gray area8 due to the differences of opinion between the company and the [ORG USG  ] over what is &new8 activity and what is &old.8 The company officials said that they hope to clarify this issue with [LOC Washington  ] during separate meetings in January with senior officials from the [ORG State Department and Department of Treasury  ] . 
Pressed for details over the company , s existing obligations , the officials said that it is under contract to meet certain targets of ( oil ) production in order to guarantee defined levels of production within a given time frame . 
They added that [ORG Eni  ] must keep a certain threshold of production in order to recover its investments in [LOC Iran  ] . 
They also explained that [ORG Eni  ] receives periodic ( possibly scheduled ) payments by [LOC Iran  ] in oil equivalent amounts that correspond to the attained target levels of production. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The [ORG Eni  ] officials admitted the frustrating difficulties of operating in [LOC Iran  ] , but stated that [ORG Eni  ] 's priority is to recover its investments there while meeting [ORG EU  ] laws . 
The officials estimated [ORG Eni  ] 's total [LOC Iran  ] investments at around $3 billion dollars , of which they said [ORG Eni  ] has already recovered already about 60 percent ( or about $1.7 billion according to one [ORG Eni  ] representative ) . 
The company officials said [ORG Eni  ] still needs to recover about $1.4 billion from its [LOC Iran  ] operations . 
They added that &if all goes as planned8 [ORG Eni  ] will recover this remainder of its investments by the end of 2013 or early in 2014 . 
They further explained that [ORG Eni  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] contracts provide the possibility of extensions if the company is not able to recover its investments within the stipulated time frame . 
The [ORG Eni  ] officials cautioned that the company may face [ORG EU  ] sanctions if it withdraws from [LOC Iran  ] due to pressure from [ORG USG  ] unilateral sanctions. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 .
