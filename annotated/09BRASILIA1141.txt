( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
The Government of [LOC Brazil  ] is interested in discussing further the proposals for nuclear fuel banks . 
In particular , it has concerns about possibly restricting a country 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and also about under what criteria a country could draw on such a fuel bank . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On September 11 , Science Counselor and Science Officer discussed the nuclear fuel bank proposals ( per [ORG REFTEL  ] ) that are before the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) with [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Acting Director of the [ORG Division for Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies  ] [PER Fabio Simao Alves  ] . 
According to [PER Alves  ] , the [ORG MRE  ] viewed the various proposals - one for a uranium reserve in [LOC Russia  ] and another for a bank to be financed by a group of countries including the [LOC United States  ] - as good ideas that needed further discussion and development. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most importantly , [PER Alves  ] stressed that the [ORG MRE  ] wanted to know in greater detail the criteria for granting access to the nuclear fuel banks . 
He said that [LOC Brazil  ] 's representative to the [ORG IAEA  ] had been raising these questions there . 
In particular , [LOC Brazil  ] was inquiring about under what circumstances could a country be cut off from all nuclear fuel suppliers , yet not be cut off by [ORG UN  ] action . 
He pointed to the cases of [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] where they would have been denied access to the fuel banks if they existed . 
In other words , what sort of behavior could warrant all the fuel suppliers cutting a country off but that the [ORG UN  ] would not do likewise . 
[PER Alves  ] commented that it looked like these banks were " designed not to work . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] does have one redline with these proposals , namely , that the proposals cannot interfere with a country 's right to develop and use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , specifically enrichment and reprocessing technology . 
[PER Alves  ] did not assert that there was necessarily a conflict between the proposals and this right , however , [LOC Brazil  ] would want that issue discussed and clarified first. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For [LOC Brazil  ] 's part as a potential fuel producer , it has a strategic goal of producing sufficient nuclear fuel to supply the two existing reactors , the one now under construction , and the proposed 4 to 8 new ones envisioned by 2030 . 
[PER Alves  ] explained that [LOC Brazil  ] after meeting this strategic goal might become a supplier to other countries , but to date that had not been set as a goal . 
He noted that [LOC Brazil  ] 's constitution and laws allowed for it to engage in selling nuclear fuel to others . 
The laws would only need to be modified if the government wanted to allow private sector participation in the field . 
Currently , all the entities involved in mining uranium , constructing nuclear facilities , and operating nuclear facilities are state owned. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has a good understanding of the nuclear fuel bank proposals . 
However , it seems to be giving greater weight to the concern that these proposals might restrict access of developing countries to nuclear technology than to the non-proliferation or other benefits . 
Still , if the [ORG USG  ] and others can address the concerns raised by [LOC Brazil  ] and clarify the criteria for when a country could have access to one of these banks , [LOC Brazil  ] might be willing not to block adoption of either of these proposals . 
END COMMENT .
