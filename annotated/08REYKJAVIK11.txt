( U ) [MISC Summary:  ] The majority coalition in the [ORG Reykjavik City Council  ] has broken down twice in the past three months , resulting in three different mayors for the largest city in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The coalition majority of the [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) and the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) split up in October over a controversial public-private merger of two energy investment companies . 
The [ORG PP  ] 's lone councilman formed a shaky coalition with the minority parties . 
This coalition terminated in January when the one of the minority parties had a change of heart and left the coalition to join forces with the [ORG IP  ] . 
[ORG Reykjavik  ] voters are outraged at the turmoil and the rapid changes have hurt the credibility of the city council . 
The newest mayor is pulling out all the stops to restore confidence . 
While some predict that the unrest at [LOC City Hall  ] will cause strains in the national [MISC IP-Social Democrat  ] governing coalition , no such faults are evident so far . 
The tumult has , however , made it less clear whether the [ORG Reykjavik  ] mayorship will retain its traditional role as a stepping stone to national office . 
End Summary . 
First Ever Majority Coalition Split ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On October 11 , 2007 the majority coalition of the [ORG Independence Party  ] and the [ORG Progressive Party  ] in the [ORG Reykjavik City Council  ] suddenly collapsed . 
The coalition had a one seat majority and [PER Bjorn Ingi Hrafnsson  ] , the sole [ORG PP  ] city councilor , split off to form a new majority with the opposition parties that have seats in the city council: the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) , the [ORG Left Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) , and the [ORG Liberal Party-Independents  ] ( [ORG LP  ] ) . 
This was the first time in the history of [LOC Reykjavik  ] that the coalition majority split mid-term . 
The cause was reportedly a disagreement between the [ORG IP  ] and the [ORG PP  ] over a public-private energy investment merger gone awry . 
In early October 2007 , [ORG Reykjavik Energy Invest  ] , the business development and investment arm of [ORG Reykjavik Energy  ] ( [ORG Note: Reykjavik Energy  ] is a publicly-owned geothermal energy company , whose largest shareholder is the City of [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
End Note . 
) , and [ORG Geysir Green Energy  ] , a private investment firm targeting the geothermal energy sector , announced their agreement to merge . 
The [ORG IP  ] was quickly mired in an internal party feud over the merger and the role of Mayor [PER Vilhjalmur Vilhjalmsson  ] , and as the negative media attention increased , Progressive rep [PER Hrafnsson  ] broke ranks with the coalition in a clear attempt to leave a sinking ship. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The new majority consisted of the [ORG SDA  ] , the [ORG LG  ] , the [ORG PP  ] , and the [ORG LP  ] , and [PER Dagur Eggertsson  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) became mayor . 
[PER Olafur Magnusson  ] , the sole [ORG LP  ] city councilor , was considered the architect of the new majority . 
He was on sick leave while being treated for depression during most of 2007 , and his alternate , [PER Margret Sverrisdottir  ] , filled his seat in the meantime . 
Both [PER Magnusson  ] and [PER Sverrisdottir  ] had left the [ORG Liberal Party  ] in early 2007 due to disagreements with the party leadership and joined a brand new political party called the [ORG Iceland Movement  ] ( reftel ) ; both remained on the city council under the [MISC Liberal Party-Independent  ] label . 
Public opinion was divided on Progressive rep [PER Hrafnsson  ] 's role in breaking up the [MISC IP-PP  ] majority coalition , but the [MISC IP  ] city councilors , including former Mayor [PER Vilhjalmsson  ] , were seen as bigger losers in the public-private merger drama . 
Majority Coalition Terminated...Again ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In a surprise move on January 21 , City Councilor [PER Magnusson  ] ( [ORG LP  ] ) and former Mayor [PER Vilhjalmsson  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) announced they had reached an agreement on forming a new majority coalition . 
[PER Magnusson  ] will be mayor for the first half of the remaining electoral term and [PER Vilhjalmsson  ] for the second half ( [ORG Note:  ] The current electoral term ends in May 2010 . 
End Note . 
) . 
The decision caught everyone off guard , including [PER Magnusson  ] 's alternate , [PER Sverrisdottir  ] , who stated that she would not support the new majority because [PER Magnusson  ] kept her out of the loop . 
Pundits have been quick to note that her ambivalence hobbles the coalition , because if Mayor [PER Magnusson  ] is ever absent from city council meetings , [PER Sverrisdottir  ] can vote with the minority. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The outgoing coalition wasted no time in voicing their complaints about the reshuffle , accusing the [ORG IP  ] and [PER Magnusson  ] of undermining city government and voters' trust in their elected officials purely for selfish reasons . 
Outraged supporters of the outgoing majority disrupted the [ORG City Council  ] meeting on January 24 , forcing a delay of several hours in [PER Magnusson  ] 's election as mayor. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , on January 23 , [PER Hrafnsson  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , who had split the coalition in October , announced his immediate resignation from the [ORG Reykjavik City Council  ] . 
In the days preceding the decision a former [ORG PP  ] member of parliament accused [PER Hrafnsson  ] of trying to rise in the ranks of the party at the expense of others , and for purportedly using party funds to buy expensive clothes for use in the election campaign for the 2006 local elections . 
( Comment: Once [PER Hrafnsson  ] was no longer keeping his party in the majority in city government , it seems the party leadership made it clear that the clothing allegations were the proverbial straw that broke the [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000011 002 OF 002 camel 's back . 
His exit has for now quashed hopes of his potential as a future leader of the [ORG PP  ] . 
) Snapshot of the New Mayor: Olafur [PER F. Magnusson  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Olafur [PER F. Magnusson  ] is a veteran at [LOC Reykjavik  ] city politics . 
Before he was elected to the [ORG City Council  ] in the 2002 local elections for the [ORG LP  ] , he served as an alternate [MISC City Councilor  ] for the [MISC IP  ] from 1990-1998 and as [LOC City Councilor  ] for the same party from 1998-2001 . 
[PER Magnusson  ] worked as a medical doctor in the 1970s and 1980s and was active in the grassroots politics of the [MISC IP  ] . 
[PER Magnusson  ] parted ways with the [MISC IP  ] in 2001 because his environmental policy views were at odds with the policy of the [MISC IP  ] . 
Subsequently he joined the [ORG Liberals  ] and was elected to the [ORG Reykjavik City Council  ] for the party in 2002 and 2006 . 
[PER Magnusson  ] now considers himself an independent in the city council , but he is a registered member of the [ORG Iceland Movement  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Despite media speculation , the changes at [LOC City Hall  ] do not seem to have raised tension between the national government 's [MISC IP-SDA  ] coalition . 
Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) and Foreign Minister ( and former [LOC Reykjavik Mayor  ] ) [PER Gisladottir  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) have been careful in their public comments , though [PER Gisladottir  ] did allow that the way the new majority came about was " an unfortunate step " for both the people of [LOC Reykjavik  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] politics in general . 
More broadly , these two swift changes in coalition majorities may herald a new era in [MISC Icelandic  ] politics . 
This era may see power-hungry politicians who are not afraid of splitting alliances in exchange for greater professional glory . 
Additionally , neither [PER Magnusson  ] nor his coalition partner Vilhjalmson of the [MISC IP  ] claim ambitions to national political office , which when added with a loss of voter confidence could mean that fewer look at the [LOC Reykjavik  ] mayorship as a traditional stepping stone to higher office. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment , cont 'd : [PER Olafur Magnusson  ] ( [ORG LP  ] ) and the [MISC IP  ] city councilors can for the moment be called the winners of the course of events on January 21 . 
However , the creation of the new majority comes at the cost of voter confidence . 
A January 24 poll shows the new majority enjoys the support of only one quarter of the electorate , and just six percent support the new mayor . 
Many have asked if [PER Magnusson  ] is capable of handling the mayoral position given his medical problems in 2007 , a line of questioning not usually seen in [MISC Icelandic  ] politics . 
[PER Magnusson  ] has gone on the offensive to answer the questions , hitting all major media outlets over his first weekend as mayor and asking to be judged " by my work , not by my illness . 
" However , with such a tenuous majority , the life of the new coalition could easily be cut short .
