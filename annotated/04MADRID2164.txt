Summary <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the Ambassador 's June 3 visit to [LOC Seville  ] , [ORG Andalusia Region  ] President [PER Manuel Chaves  ] told him that [MISC Spanish  ] President [ORG Zapatero  ] seeks " normal , strong " relations with the [LOC US  ] despite [ORG Zapatero  ] 's rapid withdrawal of [MISC Spanish  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Chaves  ] , a long-time Socialist party " boss , " stressed that the [ORG Popular Party  ] had lost the March 14 general election because of [ORG Aznar  ] 's commitment of troops to [LOC Iraq  ] , not because of the March 11 Madrid terrorist attacks . 
Looking ahead to the June 13 [ORG EU Parliament  ] elections , [PER Chaves  ] said that while the Socialists are favored to win , the public is apathetic . 
A low turnout would boost the [ORG Popular Party  ] 's chances . 
The Ambassador also met in [LOC Seville  ] with [PER Jose Antonio Viera  ] , central government delegate to [LOC Andalusia  ] . 
[PER Viera  ] expressed concerns that [MISC Islamist  ] terrorists might hide among the 2.7 million [MISC Moroccans  ] expected to travel through [LOC Andalusia  ] in July and August . 
[MISC Andalusian  ] business leaders expressed high regard for Second VP and Economy Minister [PER Solbes  ] , but were worried that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government , as a whole , might be bad for business . 
End Summary . 
Reaching out to the [MISC Regions  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador made a one-day visit June 3 to [LOC Seville  ] , the capital of [LOC Andalusia  ] , as part of his program of regular travel to [LOC Spain  ] 's 17 regions . 
[LOC Andalusia  ] has long been a Socialist stronghold , and Socialist former President [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] hails from there . 
[LOC Andalusia  ] is [LOC Spain  ] 's largest region , both geographically and in population , with over 7.4 million inhabitants . 
It is also one of [LOC Spain  ] 's poorest regions . 
Tens of thousands of rural residents live on welfare payments ( known as PER ) targeted at seasonal agricultural workers . 
The Socialist government distributes the benefits at the local level and this patronage provides them with a solid bloc of voters . 
[PER Chaves Adamant  ] on [LOC Iraq  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador began his visit to [LOC Seville  ] with a call on Socialist " [PER Baron  ] , " [PER Manuel Chaves  ] . 
[PER Chaves  ] , President of [LOC Andalusia  ] since 1990 , won re-election to a fourth term on March 14 regaining an absolute majority for the Socialists in the regional parliament . 
The Ambassador congratulated [PER Chaves  ] on his victory . 
[PER Chaves  ] responded with a commentary on [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He said the withdrawal of [MISC Spanish  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] was a political necessity for [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
[ORG Aznar  ] 's commitment of the troops went against the overwhelming sentiment of [MISC Spanish  ] society . 
The [LOC US  ] resort to force in [LOC Iraq  ] was a mistake . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] had to withdraw the troops from " [ORG Aznar  ] 's war " since they should never have been there in the first place , [PER Chaves  ] said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Chaves  ] stressed to the Ambassador that [ORG Zapatero  ] 's March 14 election victory was due not to the March 11 Madrid terrorist train attacks , but to [ORG Aznar  ] 's involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
If [ORG Aznar  ] had not committed [MISC Spanish  ] troops to [LOC Iraq  ] , the [ORG PP  ] would likely have won nationally on March 14 . 
The terrorist attacks drew attention to the [LOC Iraq  ] commitment , but the [MISC Spanish  ] public did not vote for [ORG Zapatero  ] on the basis of the terrorist attacks , [PER Chaves  ] maintained . 
What brought the [ORG PP  ] down was [ORG Aznar  ] 's decision to implicate [LOC Spain  ] in the [LOC Iraq  ] war , he reiterated. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Underlining that he holds the position of national President of the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) , [PER Chaves  ] affirmed that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government wants " normal , strong " relations with the [LOC US  ] . 
He noted that despite the differences on [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Spain  ] remains a [LOC US  ] ally . 
The transatlantic link is vital ; indeed it is the linchpin of the world order , [PER Chaves  ] stated . 
He added that both [ORG Zapatero  ] and [ORG FM Moratinos  ] are committed to forging positive relations with the [LOC US  ] and were pleased by their meeting with Secretary [PER Powell  ] in Madrid in March . 
[LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador expressed thanks for the assistance the USG receives from the [MISC Andalusian  ] government for the bases in [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] . 
[PER Chaves  ] raised the issue of the taxation of [MISC Spanish  ] worker salaries , which the [ORG GOS  ] instituted several years ago and has resulted in a substantial drop in workers' take home pay . 
[PER Chaves  ] expressed the hope that the [LOC US  ] military and the [ORG GOS  ] taxation authorities could work out " a reasonable solution that is fair to the workers . 
" Investor Concerns <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador told [PER Chaves  ] he wanted to pass along that some business leaders he had spoken with are concerned about the economic outlook under the [ORG Zapatero  ] government . 
The Ambassador noted that [LOC US  ] companies had invested over $50 billion in [LOC Spain  ] in the previous five years and that investor confidence was key to keeping that trend going . 
[PER Chaves  ] said he would pass those concerns on to VP/Economy Minister [PER Solbes  ] when they meet the next week . 
[PER Chaves  ] stressed that the [ORG Zapatero  ] government would not change the fundamental direction of [LOC Spain  ] 's recent economic policy and that there was no reason for businessmen to be concerned . 
The appointment of [PER Solbes  ] as Economy Minister was a deliberate signal of the commitment of the [ORG Zapatero  ] government to a responsible economic policy , [PER Chaves  ] said . 
June 13 [ORG EU  ] Parliament Election: Turnout Key <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding the outlook for the June 13 [ORG EU  ] parliamentary election , [PER Chaves  ] said he was uncertain . 
Voter interest in the [ORG EU  ] election is low . 
Turnout is likely to be especially low since the [ORG EU  ] vote comes only three months after the intense national elections of March 14 . 
In addition , previous [ORG EU  ] parliamentary elections had been held in conjunction with other [MISC Spanish  ] elections , while this one is stand-alone . 
[ORG Popular Party  ] voters may be more motivated than [ORG PSOE  ] voters . 
The [ORG PP  ] certainly hopes this is the case , and is working hard to turn its voters out . 
On the positive side for [ORG PSOE  ] , [PER Chaves  ] said , [ORG Zapatero  ] is enjoying a honeymoon . 
The decision to pull the troops from [LOC Iraq  ] was highly popular . 
2.7 Million [MISC Moroccans  ] Crossing the [ORG Strait This Summer  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador also met with the central government 's delegate to the [LOC Andalusia  ] , [PER Jose Antonio Viera  ] . 
( One of the delegate 's primary functions is to coordinate the activities of the national police and [PER Guardia Civil  ] in the region . 
) [PER Viera  ] , who until March was Employment and Technology Counselor in [LOC Chaves'  ] pre-March 14 government , agreed that the June 13 [ORG EU  ] parliament election would have much lower turnout than the March 14 general election . 
He added that this was unfortunate , since [ORG EU  ] issues directly affect [LOC Andalusia  ] . 
Labor costs in [LOC Andalusia  ] have been relatively low by [ORG EU  ] standards . 
However , the expansion of the [ORG EU  ] largely eliminates the cost advantage of [MISC Andalusian  ] labor and may encourage some investors to locate in [MISC Eastern Europe  ] instead . 
As a result , [MISC Andalusian  ] businessmen must now focus on [LOC Andalusia  ] becoming a higher value investment location , not just a low labor cost location. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Viera  ] also discussed [LOC Morocco  ] . 
He noted that during July and August about 2.7 million [MISC Moroccans  ] would drive through [LOC Spain  ] on their way across the [ORG Strait  ] of [LOC Gibraltar  ] to spend the summer vacation with their families . 
Many come from [LOC France  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] or elsewhere in the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Viera  ] expressed concerns about the ability of terrorists to mix among the travelers . 
He said police would step up their presence to monitor the [MISC Moroccan  ] travelers . 
He commented that [LOC Spain  ] , as [LOC Europe  ] 's frontier state with [LOC Morocco  ] , was bearing the brunt of such travel . 
[PER Viera  ] said the [ORG EU  ] must do more to reach out to the [LOC Maghreb  ] to fight organized crime , terrorism , drug running and immigrant smuggling . 
Broadening the system for legal guest workers is another goal. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding the flow of illegal immigrants across the [ORG Strait of Gibraltar  ] , [PER Viera  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] 's electronic monitoring system was highly effective and enabled [MISC Spanish  ] police to see the entire coast . 
[LOC Spain  ] will be adding more air patrols to the mix in the next few months to improve efficiency . 
This is important to cut down on the many immigrant deaths that occur in the crossing of the [ORG Strait  ] , he said . 
Businessmen: Respect for [PER Solbes  ] , But Still Concern <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador also addressed the [ORG Andalusian Business Confederation  ] . 
In the lunch that followed , the [MISC Andalusian  ] business leaders conveyed a cautious attitude toward the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's economic policy and the potential for a loss of budget discipline . 
They also expressed worries that , in the wake of the [MISC Spanish  ] pullout from [LOC Iraq  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] products might face a backlash by [LOC US  ] consumers . 
Nonetheless , they had high regard for Economy Minister [PER Solbes  ] . 
Some credited [PER Solbes  ] as being the one who started [LOC Spain  ] on the path to economic growth when he was in [PER Felipe Gonzalez  ] 's last cabinet in the mid 1990 's . 
The question , they said , is not [PER Solbes  ] , but whether [PER Solbes  ] can prevail over others in the Socialist government who do not share his philosophy. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) In addition to meetings , the Ambassador was interviewed by various regional media . 
Press coverage was favorable .
