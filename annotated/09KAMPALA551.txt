This report is not meant to provide an overarching narrative or polished analysis of the operation , but rather offers spot information gleaned in [LOC Uganda  ] only , from credible [ORG U.S. Mission  ] sources here .

( S NF ) [MISC Ugandan  ] military operations on the ground continue to make steady progress . 
The [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG Peoples Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG UPDF  ] ) are actively pursuing [ORG LRA  ] groups and has successfully laid ambushes , killing senior [ORG LRA  ] commanders . 
Between May 18 and 29 , the [ORG UPDF  ] killed 41 [ORG LRA  ] fighters , including [ORG Brigadier General  ] [PER Cesar Achellam  ] and Lt. [PER Col. Okello Okuti  ] . 
Six non-combatants were rescued during this period. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG U.N. Mission  ] in [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG MONUC  ] ) office in [LOC Kampala  ] confirmed that the [ORG World Food Program  ] ( [ORG WFP  ] ) has planned air drops of food in [MISC LRA-affected  ] areas of northeastern [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG DRC  ] ) . 
[ORG WFP  ] says that the oncoming rainy season will make it difficult for larger aircraft to deliver food into [PER Dungu  ] . 
As a result , [ORG WFP  ] had conducted several " test drops " of food by helicopter in and around [PER Dungu  ] . 
Similar operations will be conducted in [LOC Doruma  ] , [LOC Bangadi  ] , [LOC Duru  ] , and [ORG Faradje  ] . 
[ORG WFP  ] reportedly coordinated with [ORG MONUC  ] and the [ORG Congolese Armed Forces  ] . 
However , the drops were not coordinated with the [ORG UPDF  ] , which had reported it had found [ORG LRA  ] carrying donor food near [ORG Faradje  ] . 
REFCOORD met with [ORG WFP  ] on June 1 to get more details and urge [ORG WFP  ] to coordinate with the [MISC Ugandan  ] military . 
We will report out on the issue septel. - - - - - - - - - - - POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The contract of [ORG U.N.  ] Special Envoy for LRA-Affected Areas [PER Joachim Chissano  ] expires on June 30 andwill not be renewed at his request . 
[PER Nuno Tomas  ] , [PER Chissano  ] 's [LOC Kampala  ] office director , said that [ORG LRA  ] leader [PER Joseph Kony  ] shows no interest in signing the peace deal and that [PER Chissano  ] has many pressing commitments . 
[PER Chissano  ] would be available should [PER Kony  ] change his mind . 
[LOC Uganda  ] 's [ORG Minister of State for International Relations  ] [PER Henry Okello Oryem  ] told us that the [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG Government  ] accepts the move , but is concerned that northern [MISC Ugandans  ] might perceive it as an indication that there is no chance for a peaceful resolution to the conflict . 
[PER Oryem  ] said that the [ORG Government  ] would reassure northerners and remind the [ORG LRA  ] that [PER Kony  ] could call [MISC Ugandan  ] President [PER Yoweri Museveni  ] if he decides to sign the peace agreement . 
[PER Oryem  ] also said that the [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG Government  ] is concerned that [ORG Government  ] of [ORG Southern Sudan Vice  ] President [PER Riek Machar  ] might exploit [PER Chissano  ] 's departure to try to re-open the peace process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX an analyst [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] briefed the diplomatic community [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] . 
She stated that it had been " pretty clear " that the [ORG Juba Peace  ] talks had not been " going anywhere , " and that [PER Kony  ] had not bee and was not now interested in peace . 
She recommended that the military operations continue with a focus on killing the senior [ORG LRA  ] leadership and increasing efforts to protect the [MISC Congolese  ] civilian population . 
She advocated a multi-lateral discourse on planning and increased [ORG MONUC  ] capability , along with increased [ORG U.S. Government  ] support , including planning support , intelligence , and logistics . 
She explained that [MISC Congolese  ] President [PER Kabila  ] 's internal problems , including opposition to the operation from eastern [ORG DRC  ] parliamentarians , had been a problem , but that the lack of human rights abuses by the [ORG UPDF  ] coupled with continued [ORG LRA  ] depredations resulted in a positive perception of the [ORG UPDF  ] presence among [MISC Congolese  ] civilians . 
This has dissipated parliamentary opposition , according to [PER Spiegel  ] . 
( [PER Comment: Spiegel  ] , like most other non-governmental observers , publicly expresses surprise at the number of [MISC Ugandan  ] troops still in the [ORG DRC  ] and that the [MISC Ugandan  ] troop strength has not been publicly discussed . 
We note that the [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG Government  ] has deliberately ( and successfully ) kept quiet its troop strength and regular engagements with the [ORG LRA  ] in order to keep a [MISC Congolese  ] face on the operation .
