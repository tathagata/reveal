( C ) SUMMARY . 
As Operator [ORG BP  ] continues to look for the cause of the gas leak in its offshore [ORG ACG  ] oil mega-field that has resulted in slashed oil production ( reftels ) , possibilities center on either a failure in one of the wells or damage in the underlying geologic formation . 
A quick fix is unlikely in either scenario , meaning that at least for the short-term , [ORG GOAJ  ] revenues from the [ORG ACG  ] field , its major hard currency earner , will be seriously decreased . 
At least some [ORG ACG  ] partners are not pleased with BP’s handling of this incident , and [ORG GOAJ  ] displeasure with [ORG BP  ] will certainly increase if it turns out that the gas leak was due to operator error . 
END SUMMARY . 
CHAIN OF EVENTS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG ACG  ] Operator [ORG BP  ] has been exceptionally circumspect in disseminating information about the [ORG ACG  ] gas leak , both to the public and to its [ORG ACG  ] partners . 
However , after talking with [ORG BP  ] and other sources , Embassy has pieced together the following picture: - On September 17 bubbles appeared in the waters around the [ORG Central Azeri  ] ( [ORG CA  ] ) Platform , one of the major platforms in [LOC Azerbaijan’s  ] offshore [ORG ACG  ] oil mega-field and the platform’s gas detector alarm went off , signaling the presence of abnormally high levels of gas in the water around the platform ( reftel ) . - Shortly thereafter , a related gas-reinjection well ( [MISC B-17  ] ) for [ORG Central Azeri  ] had a blowout , expelling water , mud and gas. - The [ORG BP Offshore Installation Manager  ] decided to evacuate the platform , sounding the “muster” alarm at 0900 hours , evacuating the 211 workers on the [ORG CA Platform.  ] - [ORG BP  ] then shut in production at the [ORG Central Azeri  ] field and the [ORG Eastern Azeri  ] field . 
Shortly thereafter production from the [ORG Western Azeri  ] field was also shut down for putatively unrelated reasons ( problems with a generator ) , with an overall decrease in daily production from approximately 900,000 to 250,000 bpd ( overall [ORG ACG  ] production has subsequently increased to 300,000 bpd ) . - There have been no visible signs of gas noted on the water’s surface since September 19 ( which does not mean gas is no longer flowing ) . 
However , the [ORG ROV  ] has noted small holes and bubbling on the seabed floor . 
POSSIBLE CAUSES <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to Embassy interlocutors , there are three possible causes for this leak ( in order of increasing severity and longer times needed to fix ) : - Leak in a Gas Flowline: this was the least likely cause ( and the easiest to fix ) , since a flowline pressure drop would have been detected . 
[ORG BP  ] has subsequently ruled out flowline problems as the source. - Well Failure: Simply put , this is operator error , most likely a bad cement job around a well , or a split casing , causing a gas leak . 
The fact that surface bubbling was no longer noticed shortly after well production was shut down indicates that well failure might be the cause . 
If this is the cause , repair could take weeks or months , and one or some wells would have to be plugged in and subsequently re-drilled. - Formation Damage: A geologic event in the sub-seafloor around the platform , to include a sea breach of the oil/gas formation ( possibly due to the operator’s failure to maintain formation pressure above the ‘bubble point , ’ which would allow the gas trapped in the oil to change from liquid to gaseous form , and thus permeate the overlying rock formation ) , or fracturing of faulting of the undersea formation . 
Shallow gas ( i.e. gas under the subsea floor but above the geologic formation ) and/or a mud volcano could also be causes , although according to existing data the nearest [ORG BAKU  ] 00000919 002 OF 003 known mud volcano is 1.5 kilometers away from the [ORG CA Platform  ] . 
If formation damage is the leak’s cause , the length of time needed to fix the problem , if indeed it can be fixed , will be substantial . 
ACTIONS TAKEN <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) BP’s have pursued a multiprong strategy of data acquisition to determine the gas leak’s cause , to include: - Review of existing well data , to include the cement logs ( for when the cement around the well casings was poured , to see if a faulty cement job is the cause ) -Remotely Operated Vehicle ( [ORG ROV  ] ) surveys: [ORG BP  ] has done and will continue to conduct underwater [ORG ROV  ] surveys around [ORG Central Azeri.  ] - Reboard of [ORG CA Platform: Experts  ] from Boots and Coots will seek to re-board the [ORG CA Platform  ] on September 27 to , inter alia , take gas samples ( biogenic gas would indicate a shallow gas source , i.e. gas from just the under subsea floor but above the formation ; formation gas would indicate formation damage ) . 
Subsequent platform re-boards for investigative purposes will continue consist with safety procedures. - [MISC Side-scan  ] sonar , measuring up to 50 meters below the sea floor , to detect the possible presence of shallow gas . 
SHALLOW SEISMIC SURVEY ? <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) If [ORG BP  ] is not able to determine the cause by the above methods , it will have to conduct a shallow seismic survey , which measures up to one thousand meters below the sea floor , and the undertaking of which is , in the words of one source “a big deal.” . 
( Comment: The geologic formation under [ORG CA  ] is six to eleven thousand feet below the sea floor ) . 
Conducting this survey and processing the data would take at minimum until early November . 
PRODUCTION ESTIMATES <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Current [ORG ACG  ] production has plummeted from 900,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd . 
[ORG BP  ] has said that the [ORG West Azeri Platform  ] , currently shut down due to problems with its electrical generator , will be producing again on November 1 , adding another 100,000 bpd to the existing 300,000 bpd . 
Consequently at least some [ORG ACG  ] partners are being forced to seriously revise downwards production estimates for ( at least ) the remaining months of 2008 , with no one currently having any clear idea as to how long this decreased production will continue . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] CONCERNS <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] has told Embassy that it is keeping [ORG SOCAR  ] informed as to its findings , and that [ORG SOCAR  ] is seeking to “plug in” its own experts with those in [ORG BP  ] working the issue . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] Marketing VP [PER Elshad Nasirov  ] told EnergyOff on September 25 that [ORG SOCAR  ] was concerned about delivery disruptions . 
There is an approximate one month lag time between arranging for the sale of oil at [LOC Ceyhan  ] and the arrival of the vessel to pick up the oil , meaning that there are vessels steaming towards [LOC Ceyhan  ] now to pick up oil that [ORG SOCAR  ] ( who is currently responsible for marketing 80 percent of the [ORG ACG  ] gas ) cannot deliver . 
[ORG SOCAR  ] is concerned about the demurrage fines and the penalties to be charged by buyers and refineries . 
[PER Nasirov  ] said that it was his understanding that [ORG SOCAR  ] can declare force majeure only if the cause were a natural one ( such as an underwater mud volcano ) ; if the problem resulted from [ORG ACG Operator  ] error ( such as [ORG BP  ] erring when pouring concrete around the well ) , he didn’t think that [ORG SOCAR  ] would be able to declare force majeure . 
LOST INCOME <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) When asked to hazard a guess as to how much money the [ORG GOAJ  ] was losing as a result of this incident , knowledgeable Embassy interlocutors have estimated approximately [MISC USD  ] 45 million each day ( 600,000 barrels per day at approximately [MISC USD  ] 100 per barrel equals 60 million , minus Capex/Opex , times 0.80 percent , since the [ORG GOAJ  ] gets 80 percent of the profit oil ) . 
[ORG BAKU  ] 00000919 003 OF 003 COMMENT: <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG ACG  ] field is the [MISC GOAJ’s  ] main revenue-earner , and it is likely that this event is going to seriously impact its income stream in ( at best ) the short-term . 
Additionally , President [PER Aliyev  ] is likely to see this as the latest in a series of disappointments from [ORG BP  ] , at a time when he is seeking to develop [MISC ACG Deep Gas  ] and other [LOC Azerbaijan  ] hydrocarbon assets . 
At least some of BP’s [ORG ACG  ] partners are similarly upset with BP’s performance in this episode , as they claim [ORG BP  ] has sought to limit information flow about this event even to its [ORG ACG  ] partners . 
Although it is too early to ascertain the cause , if in fact this production shut-down was due to [ORG BP  ] technical error , and if it continues for months ( as seems possible ) , BP’s reputation in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] will take a serious hit . 
There have been no indications that the problems were caused by anything other than operator error or a geological problem .
