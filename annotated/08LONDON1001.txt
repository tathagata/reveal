( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Criticism and indifference from [MISC British  ] political leaders , foreign policy analysts , and media greeted the publication of [MISC HMG’s  ] first [ORG National Security Strategy  ] ( [ORG NSS  ] ) , an initial reaction echoed in many of the [ORG Whitehall  ] ministries to which the [ORG NSS  ] was directed . 
[LOC UK  ] opposition leaders and most of the [LOC UK  ] media criticized the [ORG NSS  ] as an undifferentiated “laundry list” of possible security and natural disaster threats that provided no strategic guidance on how to address these challenges or how to prioritize resources among them . 
The [ORG NSS’  ] publication was little more than a 24-hour news cycle story for the [LOC UK  ] media and produced surprisingly little op-ed comment . 
An FCO contact tells us the [ORG NSS  ] is at the moment “collecting dust” in drawers . 
In two recent high-profile speeches on [LOC UK  ] foreign policy priorities ( ref A and B ) , Foreign Secretary Miliband made no explicit reference to the [ORG NSS  ] . 
Several [ORG Whitehall  ] officials noted that their suggestions for the [ORG NSS  ] were ignored by the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] drafters and so there is little “buy-in” from [ORG Whitehall  ] ministries . 
So far , there has been no movement on implementing the [ORG NSS’  ] recommendation to create a “National Security Forum.” The other major [ORG NSS  ] recommendation for government action -- creation of 1000-strong civilian reconstruction corps -- was dismissed by the head of [MISC HMG’s  ] existing [ORG Stabilization Unit  ] as simply a pulling together of existing programs under a new name undertaken without consultation with him . 
In the end , whatever the future of the [ORG NSS’  ] specific recommendations , what is disappointing , and troubling , about the [ORG NSS’  ] indifferent reception is that the [ORG Brown Government  ] -- and [LOC UK  ] political establishment writ large -- may have missed the opportunity for a national discussion on the evolving security threats that do face the country .

End Summary . 
Released with Fanfare --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Given a high profile launch on the floor of the [ORG House of Commons  ] March 19 by Prime Minister [ORG Brown  ] himself , the [ORG NSS  ] , subtitled “Security in an Interdependent World , ” was the product of a six-month effort by a specifically tasked [ORG Cabinet  ] office team to draft [MISC HMG’s  ] first comprehensive national security strategy . 
Members of the [ORG Brown Cabinet  ] were dispatched immediately following the release of the [ORG NSS  ] to discuss the document with [MISC British  ] media ; copies of the [ORG NSS  ] were made available on government websites . 
Although members of the drafting team cited the USG’s own [ORG National Security Strategy  ] document as a model , the [ORG NSS  ] they produced has little in common with its [LOC U.S.  ] counterpart . 
The [ORG NSS  ] is a 60-page document that declares up front that national security has “broadened beyond protection of the state and its vital interests from attacks by other states” to “include threats to individual citizens and to our way of life.” For that reason the [ORG NSS  ] deals with issues such as trans-national crime , global poverty , pandemics , and flooding , as well as addressing traditional national security threats like terrorism and hostile states . 
Instead of stating a half dozen broad principles and tactics to guide the approach to countering current threats , as the [LOC U.S.  ] security strategy does , the [ORG NSS  ] lists with great specificity the range of threats facing the [LOC UK  ] and details all the various resources -- domestic and international -- to be used to counter them . 
But Greeted with [LOC Disdain  ] ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) Although one media commentator speculated that the inclusion of issues like preventing a repeat of the floods that struck the [LOC UK  ] last summer and avian flu outbreaks was meant to make the [ORG NSS  ] “more relevant and interesting to the broader [MISC British  ] public , ” the result in reality was to spark a round of criticism of the [ORG NSS  ] as nothing more than committee-drafted laundry list of the issues du jour: The [MISC Times  ] , in an editorial , summed up this vein of attack when it called the [ORG NSS  ] “a maypole dance of warnings woven together with none dominant.” The [ORG Daily Telegraph  ] agreed and said that the result was a “damp squib” that gave no guidance or sense of priority on how to counter the “Chinese menu” of threats it listed . 
[LOC LONDON  ] 00001001 002 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Opposition political leaders were willing to praise the [ORG Brown Government’s  ] effort to develop a security strategy , but echoed the charge the [ORG NSS  ] failed to outline a real strategy . 
[ORG Conservative Party  ] leader [PER David Cameron  ] , in his response in the [ORG Commons  ] , said a [ORG NSS  ] was necessary and offered the [ORG Labour Government  ] praise for taking on the “challenge of providing strategic direction , ” singling out the [ORG NSS’  ] discussions of the threats from global terrorism and nuclear proliferation as useful . 
But [PER Cameron  ] went on to charge that the [ORG NSS  ] failed to provide meaningful long-term strategic thinking on how to address the list of threats it outlined . 
[PER Cameron  ] was critical that the [ORG NSS  ] proposal to create a “National Security Forum” -- an organization to bring together representatives from local and central governments , joined by experts from parliament , academia and the private sector , to discuss emerging threats and how to address them -- merely set up “another talk shop.” [PER Cameron  ] instead called for the creation of a [LOC UK  ] body modeled on the [ORG National Security Council  ] in the [LOC United States  ] to better coordinate HMG and other governments’ work on security issues . 
[ORG Liberal Democratic Leader  ] [PER Nick Clegg  ] echoed Cameron’s remarks when he said the [ORG NSS  ] was valuable , but “failed to provide useful guidance on how to prepare long-term” to address the [MISC UK’s  ] security threats. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) A March 20 roundtable discussion on the [ORG NSS  ] , hosted by [ORG King’s College London  ] , captured well the reaction of [LOC UK  ] foreign policy commentators . 
[PER Dr. John Gearson  ] , a professor of international relations at King , s [ORG College  ] , welcomed the effort to draft a security strategy and said the [ORG NSS  ] offered a “good description of the 21st century threats” the [LOC UK  ] faces , but , he told the audience , “unfortunately , it is not a strategy” and called the [ORG NSS  ] as drafted “a lost opportunity.” [PER John Reid  ] , former [ORG Labour Home and Defense Secretary  ] , while admitting that the [ORG NSS  ] “did not do itself [MISC SIPDIS  ] justice , ” argued that it was possible to “extract some strategic guidelines” from the text . 
[PER Reid  ] welcomed the [ORG NSS  ] as an attempt to think long-term and praised it for recognizing that , because of the nature of the threat of terrorism , the [LOC UK  ] needs more national effort in crafting its response . 
[PER Reid  ] acknowledged , however , that while all of these points are mentioned in the [ORG NSS  ] , it was “a pity” that they are not more clearly enunciated . 
Echoing these comments , Sir [PER David Ormond  ] , a former Security and Intelligence Coordinator within HMG , called the [ORG NSS  ] a “necessary step , ” but added that “given its length and detail” it will take time for many to understand the big concepts that he found in the document -- the need to strengthen the ability to respond to threats from cyber attacks and national disasters , building healthy communities to resist radicalization , and developing guidelines for the responsible use of power overseas . 
[PER Ormond  ] praised the [ORG NSS  ] for posing these challenges as part of government thinking and the national debate on what security means in the 21st century , but added that the [ORG NSS  ] lacked “long-term strategic thinking on how to actually move these concepts forward.” Off the [ORG National Front Page Quickly  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU ) The [ORG NSS  ] gained little media traction and was off the front pages within a day of its release . 
It has thus far produced little op-ed or political commentary in mainstream [LOC UK  ] media or journals . 
Neither of the two leading general political magazines of the left and right in the [LOC UK  ] -- The [MISC New Statesman  ] or The Specator -- gave the [ORG NSS  ] editorial coverage . 
The opposition parties , after providing the initial responses discussed above , gave it no more public attention and it was not taken up by any of the political parties for further parliamentary discussion or debate . 
[ORG Whitehall’s Response  ] -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The indifferent political and media reaction was matched by that of the [LOC Whitehall  ] ministries at which the [ORG NSS  ] was directed . 
An [ORG FCO  ] contact in the [LOC North America Office  ] told us the [ORG NSS  ] already “is collecting dust in drawers” and would have no effect on his office’s work or its long-term planning . 
Post found this reaction in a range of [ORG FCO  ] offices and at the [ORG MOD  ] when the [ORG NSS  ] was raised ( Embassy comment . 
We caution , however , that Post has not had an opportunity to raise the [ORG NSS  ] with the domestic security ministries -- [ORG Home Office  ] or intelligence agencies -- so cannot speculate on whether the document had more effect at these offices . 
End comment . 
) Several HMG contacts described how their input to [LOC LONDON  ] 00001001 003 OF 003 the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] drafters of the [ORG NSS  ] was ignored or rejected , which accordingly produced little sense of buy-in for the document from [LOC Whitehall  ] ministries . 
Others noted that they were not consulted regarding the [ORG NSS’  ] specific recommendations for action that affected their direct responsibilities . 
[PER Richard Teutten  ] , head of [LOC HMG’s  ] existing Stabilization Unit for post-conflict reconstruction ( please protect ) , for example , told his [ORG USG  ] counterpart , Ambassador [PER John Herbst  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization , during a March 20 meeting in [LOC London  ] , that the [ORG NSS’  ] language on stabilization activities was not cleared by him . 
[PER Teutten  ] also said that the 1000-strong [ORG Civilian Stabilization Corps  ] announced in the [ORG NSS  ] was a re-hatting of existing programs . 
The [ORG Corps  ] would be military reservists , not civilians , [PER Teutten  ] claimed , and the 269 million pounds ( approx . 
540 million USD ) identified in the [ORG NSS  ] for post-conflict stabilization work was “somewhat misleading” -- the figure was for three years and was already budgeted , including through the [ORG UN.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) Shortly after the [ORG NSS’  ] public release , a senior staffer in the [ORG Foreign Secretary’s  ] office told [LOC Poloff  ] that the ideas and themes in the [ORG NSS  ] were intended to be worked into the long-term planning and thinking at the [ORG Foreign Office  ] and that the [LOC Foreign Secretary’s  ] office would be responsible for “incorporating” the [ORG NSS  ] into the [ORG Foreign Office’s  ] work . 
The [ORG FCO  ] staffer , however , could not identify any specific steps being taken to reflect the [ORG NSS  ] findings in the [ORG Foreign Office’s  ] work . 
It may be indicative of a disconnect that the [ORG Foreign Secretary  ] himself has given two major speeches on [LOC UK  ] foreign policy priorities -- one shortly before the release of the [ORG NSS  ] and one two weeks later -- that contained no explicit mention of the [ORG NSS  ] ( refs A and B ) . 
No Action Yet on Specific Recommendations ----------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) According to a member of the [ORG Cabinet Office  ] unit responsible for drafting the [ORG NSS  ] no action has been taken yet on the [ORG NSS’  ] specific recommendations for government action . 
No steps have been taken , for example , to identify participants in the [ORG National Security Forum  ] . 
According to the [ORG NSS  ] , HMG will publish an annual update of security threats and the progress made in implementing the [ORG NSS  ] strategy . 
HMG was also to begin consultations with the political parties and Parliamentary authorities about how [ORG Parliament  ] can play a role in implementation of the [ORG NSS  ] strategies , but so far there has been no publicly announced action to move these plans forward . 
Comment ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) The [ORG NSS  ] was a major initiative of the [ORG Brown Government  ] , which established a specific unit in the [ORG Cabinet  ] office to oversee the drafting and coordination of the document , and gave the finished product a high-profile launch by [ORG Brown  ] himself . 
The document’s unenthusiastic reception is as surprising as it must be frustrating to [LOC Downing Street  ] . 
It is tempting to read the [ORG NSS  ] as a reflection of the [ORG Brown  ] approach to governing -- lots of detail , ensuring all possible policy factors are identified before decisions are reached , focused on improving Government process over articulating broad new strategies , and designed to be relevant to middle [LOC Britain  ] at the risk of blurring its focus . 
It is a document that reflects the substantive strengths and communication failings of the [ORG Brown Government  ] and may have little influence in or out of government . 
Wherever the blame is placed for the [ORG NSS’  ] indifferent reception , what is troubling is that the [ORG Brown Government  ] -- and [LOC UK  ] political establishment more largely -- may have missed an opportunity for a necessary national discussion on the evolving security threats that do face the [LOC UK  ] .
