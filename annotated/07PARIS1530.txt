( C ) [PER Poloff  ] delivered Reftel points to [ORG MFA  ] Senior [LOC Iraq  ] Desk Officer [PER Bernard Chappedelaine  ] on April 16 . 
[PER Chappedelaine  ] noted that it might be difficult to secure [MISC French  ] ministerial representation at the Compact signing event due to the [MISC French  ] presidential elections ; he predicted that the [MISC French  ] would wait until shortly before the signing ceremony before finalizing their representational plans . 
( Note: [MISC French  ] ministers are curbing their foreign travel during the election period , and FM [MISC Douste-Blazy  ] is personally engaged in campaigning for [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] . 
) With respect to the EIB , [PER Chappedelaine  ] said the [ORG MFA  ] would need to consult with the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] before providing a substantive response . 
On technical assistance , [PER Chappedelaine  ] objected that [LOC France  ] has already offered to train up to 150 [MISC Iraqi  ] civil servants per year . 
[PER Poloff  ] countered that [LOC France  ] should consider expanding its training program in order to demonstrate its support for [LOC Iraq  ] and the Compact , and [PER Chappedelaine  ] reluctantly conceded that an expansion might be possible. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On a more positive note , [PER Chappedelaine  ] said [LOC France  ] may soon make a 500,000 euro donation to provide humanitarian assistance to [MISC Iraqi  ] refugees , in part so as to lessen the burden the refugees impose on neighboring states ( in particular , [LOC Jordan  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Post will also deliver reftel points at the earliest possibility to [PER Jean-Pierre Guinhut  ] , [LOC France  ] 's Inter-Ministerial Coordinator for [LOC Iraq  ] reconstruction .
