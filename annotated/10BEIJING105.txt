[LOC BEIJING  ] 86 Classified By: Economic Minister Counselor [PER Weinstein  ] for reasons: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
[ORG Google  ] 's [LOC Beijing  ] headquarters continued business " as usual " today as it still provided the [MISC China-based  ] version of its search engine . 
[ORG Google  ] emphasized its filtering of that search engine remained " unchanged " and " compliant with [MISC Chinese  ] law . 
" [ORG Google  ] has not yet engaged the [MISC Chinese  ] government in discussions about continuing its operations here . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Government provided the first official reaction to [ORG Google  ] 's January 14 announcement , with the [ORG MFA  ] spokesperson and other [ORG PRC  ] officials rejecting allegations of [MISC Chinese  ] responsibility for the recent , alleged cyber attacks on [ORG Google  ] and other companies' internet architecture . 
Local industry experts and [MISC American  ] businesspersons here almost unanimously expect [ORG Google  ] will withdraw from the market , despite its claims to still be open to resolving its problems with [LOC China  ] . 
Local media coverage included numerous business articles on [ORG Google  ] 's travails , with at least one [MISC Chinese  ] website claiming to have conducted an opinion poll showing a large majority support [LOC China  ] not making concessions to [ORG Google  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Google China  ] 's [LOC Beijing  ] HQ remained relatively quiet January 14 , with [ORG Google  ] employees continuing to work . 
Spectators , press , and well-wishers continued to visit , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained [ORG Google  ] has still not engaged with [ORG PRC  ] authorities to reach a solution to the current impasse , but noted [LOC China  ] 's [ORG State Council Information Office  ] ( [ORG SCIO  ] ) did contact [ORG Google China  ] 's government relations staff January 13 following a several-hour suspension of [PER Google.cn  ] 's search filtering mechanisms , which [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained were due to technical issues . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that [ORG SCIO  ] asked [ORG Google  ] 's government relations team if this was a deliberate modification of its filtering . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [ORG Google  ] had not disabled its filters , and [ORG SCIO  ] accepted [ORG Google  ] 's explanation . 
At present , according to a [MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG Google  ] representative , [ORG Google  ] " continues to comply with the law in [LOC China  ] and is filtering [PER Google.cn  ] as ( it ) has been . 
" The [MISC U.S.-based  ] rep did concede that [ORG Google  ] 's filter is undergoing changes , but publicly [ORG Google  ] is not " explaining the changing nature of ( its ) filter " and maintains the filtering remains in compliance with [MISC Chinese  ] law . 
GOVERNMENT REACTION COOL ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reports that the [ORG PRC  ] still has not directly addressed the firm 's announcement with [ORG Google  ] . 
However , [ORG MFA  ] spokesperson [PER Jiang Yu  ] addressed the [ORG Google  ] matter in a regular January 14 [ORG MFA  ] press briefing ( reported Ref A ) , during which reporters barraged her with questions on [ORG Google  ] . 
[PER Jiang  ] stated the [MISC Chinese  ] government has made its position clear to the [LOC U.S.  ] and asserted [MISC Chinese  ] law prohibited cyber attacks , including hacking . 
[PER Jiang  ] also said [LOC China  ] 's internet is " open and the [MISC Chinese  ] government encourages its development . 
" [ORG State Council Information Office  ] ( [ORG SCIO  ] ) Minister [PER Wang  ] posted a web statement January 13 , which , while not directly addressing [ORG Google  ] , stressed that the internet should be used to shape public opinion and should comply with state control . 
[PER Yao Jian  ] , Spokesperson for the [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] ( [ORG MOFCOM  ] ) on January 13 said only that [ORG MOFCOM  ] would follow the [ORG Google  ] matter closely . 
A [ORG MOFCOM  ] specialist on multinational investment policies was quoted in the press as arguing that the [ORG Google  ] case is unique and should not be seen as relevant to other multinational investments in [LOC China  ] . 
Officials at the [ORG Ministry of Industry and Information Technology  ] ( [ORG MIIT  ] ) declined to comment on the case , claiming that they do not have enough information . 
SPECULATION ON NEXT STEPS ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] spoke January 13 with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who opined that the [MISC Chinese  ] government was likely surprised by [ORG Google  ] 's announcement of its potential withdrawal , and the [ORG PRC  ] would be unlikely to seek out talks with [ORG Google  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] anticipates we will see a slow , perfunctory attempt to engage between [MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG Google  ] representatives and the [MISC Chinese  ] , but that , in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] opinion the [ORG PRC  ] has already likely decided [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000105 002 OF 003 that [ORG Google  ] is a company that " does not understand how to work with [LOC China  ] . 
" Only if [ORG Google  ] continues to accept [LOC China  ] 's mandates would an accommodation be possible , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also predicted that , failing an agreement , the Gmail accounts of [MISC Chinese  ] users would suffer sporadic interruptions of access , and the potential for a complete blockage of Google.com is also not out of the question. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A highly-regarded long-term local industry analyst [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , also saw [ORG Google  ] 's actions as leading quickly to its withdrawal from the [MISC Chinese  ] market . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated to [ORG Econoff  ] that [ORG Google  ] may have an extremely limited window to seek a solution , given the increasing " maniacal " posture of elements of the [MISC Chinese  ] bureaucracy with respect to information control and discriminatory policies and practices toward foreign elements . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also opined that [ORG Google  ] 's withdrawal from the market would undermine competition here and therefore innovation in [LOC China  ] 's internet industry . 
He saw [ORG Baidu  ] 's success as a direct result of competition with [ORG Google  ] and other western companies ; without that competition , [ORG Baidu  ] and other [MISC Chinese  ] companies would likely lose their competitive edge in the long run . 
Separately , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was quoted in the media as saying " there has been this received wisdom tha no one can afford not to be in [LOC China  ] , but that is being questioned now . 
" BUSINESS COMMUNITY REACTIONS ---------------------------- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] January 14 that logistics had made it impossible for its Board to clear and release a press statement January 13 [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The [ORG Committee  ] has drafted a statement on the security and free flow of information that it now hopes to clear and release within twenty-four hours . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that in seeking to remove all filters from its [MISC China-based  ] search engine , [ORG Google  ] has firmly positioned itself publicly and will not be able to back down . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes [ORG Google  ] 's [LOC China  ] exit is imminent , and would only at the margins affect information flows , IT services , and the development of competition in [LOC China  ] . 
He did hope that this matter would force the [ORG PRC  ] to use greater caution before implementing policies harmful to the business climate. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought [ORG Google  ] , however , had backe itself into a corner from which it could not likely exit , given the [MISC Chinese  ] reputation for non-compromise in such matters. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Jack Ma  ] , Chairman of [MISC Chinese  ] internet giant [ORG Alibaba  ] ( with ownership links to [LOC Yahoo China  ] , which has faced its own difficulties in [LOC China  ] ) struck an exhortatory chord in media interviews: " Giving up is the biggest failure . 
Nothing is easy . 
It is admirable if one can still do well no matter how many difficulties are on the way .
