[ORG Indicators: Transparency International: Libya  ] is ranked 130 on the [MISC Corruption Perceptions Index  ] . 
[ORG Heritage Foundation: Economic Freedom  ] Ranking: 171 [ORG World Bank Doing Business: Libya  ] is not ranked [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation: Libya  ] is not ranked OPENNESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT 2.In recent years , [LOC Libya  ] has taken a number of steps to encourage foreign direct investment , with its current initiative dating back to the mid-1990s . 
Since that time , [LOC Libya  ] enacted numerous laws and regulations intended to improve the [MISC Libyan  ] business climate and increase its attractiveness to foreign investment . 
This effort has been modestly successful ; foreign companies are returning to do business , and [LOC Libya  ] has been able to draw substantial interest from foreign investors , particularly since the lifting of [ORG UN  ] sanctions in 2003 . 
This has included billions of dollars in investment in [LOC Libya  ] 's energy sector . 
[LOC Libya  ] has also embarked on vast new development projects , including plans to spend 150 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinar ( [ORG LD  ] ) ( approximately [LOC US  ] $123.4 billion ) on public works , much of it in infrastructure and housing , over the next five years . 
3.Through [ORG Law No.  ] 5 ( 1997 ) , " [ORG Encouragement of Investment Decision  ] , " the government attempted to diversify its hydrocarbons-dependent economy , encourage technical training of [MISC Libyan  ] nationals and enhance regional development . 
Sectors targeted under this law include - but are not limited to - agriculture , industry , tourism , services and health . 
The provisions of [ORG Law No.  ] 5 attempt to lower the tax and customs fee burdens on qualifying companies . 
Under the law , imported machinery , tools , and other capital equipment are exempt from all customs duties and taxes ; any equipment , spare parts , or primary materials needed for the project operation are exempt for a period of five years ; the affected project is exempt from income tax on its activities for a period of five years from the date of the commencement of production or work ; goods directed for export are exempt from excise tax and from the fees and taxes imposed on exports ; stamp duty tax on commercial documents are exempt ; and finally , profits from a project will enjoy the same exemption if reinvested . 
A 2006 General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] ) amendment to [ORG Law No.  ] 5 lowered a 50 million [MISC Libyan  ] dinar ( approximately [LOC US  ] $41 million ) floor on investments qualifying under the law to [ORG LD  ] 5 million ( approximately [LOC US  ] $4.13 million ) ( [ORG LD  ] 2 million if 50% or more of the project is owned by [MISC Libyans  ] ) . 
4.The [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign Investment Board ( [ORG LFIB  ] ) was created as the implementing agency for [ORG Law No.  ] 5.The [ORG LFIB  ] was replaced in 2009 by a similar organization , known as the [ORG Privatization and Investment Board  ] ( [ORG PIB  ] ) . 
This organization 's mission is to oversee and regulate foreign investment in [LOC Libya  ] 's aging and obsolete industrial base , which is characterized by an absence of national industrial planning , obsolete technology , poor management , shoddy maintenance , slow restructuring and over-employment . 
The function of the [ORG PIB  ] is essentially to serve as the screening mechanism for foreign direct investment . 
While [ORG PIB  ] 's mandate theoretically includes investment-promotion , its activity is generally limited to processing foreign investment inquiries , except those related to tourism or the [ORG Misurata Free Zone  ] . 
( [ORG Note: Applications  ] for investment in those sectors should be directed to the [ORG Tourism Committee  ] and the [ORG Free Zone Authority  ] , respectively . 
End note . 
) This organization aims to be a " one-stop shop , " assisting with issues related to customs and immigration , taxes , and labor for those companies entering under [ORG Law No.  ] 5.PIB approval is required for a broad array of operational issues for projects undertaken under [ORG Law No.  ] 5 , including the disposal of imported materials , transfers of investment capital outside of [LOC Libya  ] at project completion , and employment of foreigners when qualified [MISC Libyans  ] cannot be hired . 
5.Libyan legal requirements on foreign companies present challenges with respect to operational activities . 
[MISC Non-Libyans  ] cannot , as a rule , own land . 
( [ORG Note:  ] A provision of [ORG Law No.  ] 5 does allow for foreign rental and ownership of land for project work , although this has not been widely observed in practice . 
End note . 
) " [ORG National Treatment  ] " provisions do not exist for foreign investors . 
The local content requirement is such that foreign companies must hire a number of [MISC Libyans  ] to at least match the number of expatriates on staff . 
In the oil sector , [MISC Libyans  ] put forward for employment with foreign companies often TRIPOLI 00000039 002.2 OF 010 lack formal qualifications or applicable practical experience , leaving companies to either invest a considerable amount of resources on extensive training and mentoring or to pay employees who do not contribute to the company 's productivity . 
6.The promulgation of [ORG Law  ] 443 on November 14 , 2006 , fundamentally changed the way that foreign businesses in the oil services , construction , industry , electricity , communications , transportation , agribusiness and marine sectors can structure themselves and operate in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Among other measures , new foreign entrants seeking to establish themselves in these sectors of the [MISC Libyan  ] market are required to establish joint venture companies with a [MISC Libyan  ] entity . 
[ORG Law  ] 443 liberalized the strictures of earlier regulations by allowing foreign companies to retain up to 65% ownership of these entities . 
The law does not apply to representative offices ( which do not have the right to conduct negotiations or enter into contracts ) , and to entities formed under [ORG Law  ] 5 of 1997 or [ORG Law  ] 7 of 2004 ( governing tourism projects ) . 
7.Some political screening of foreign investment takes place , and the political equities significantly influence decisions on government procurement . 
In 2007 , senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials made public statements directly linking successful foreign bids on development projects to the health of bilateral political relations . 
There is also strong evidence that large government and quasi-government tenders are awarded for political reasons , often in tacit exchange for deals perceived to demonstrate [LOC Libya  ] 's return to the international community . 
Similarly , large tenders are withheld when political relations are not perceived to be positive . 
This has a trickle-down effect on private sector business transactions , which can be made more difficult by [MISC Libyan  ] government interference . 
The [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Audit and Oversight  ] reviews all contracts involving government funding , and exercises considerable influence over the political vetting of foreign companies seeking to enter the [MISC Libyan  ] market . 
8.Foreign firms are subject to special taxation arrangements , including the [ORG Stamp Tax  ] , which places a special tax of 0.5-3 percent on the value of items procured by foreign firms in [LOC Libya  ] , and the [ORG Jihad Tax  ] , which applies a 4 percent tax on corporate profits . 
Corporate tax rates are subject to interpretation , and are often a matter of negotiation between the company and [MISC Libyan  ] tax authorities , particularly for larger companies/projects . 
[ORG Law No.  ] 5 ( 1997 ) does provide some tax benefits for companies conducting work in [LOC Libya  ] that falls under its terms , but requirements to receive these benefits are not clearly defined in the law . 
Furthermore , several standard forms of tax relief are not provided , resulting in high withholdings and income taxes . 
9.The government began a program of privatizations of 360 state-owned enterprises in 2004 , a process that is ongoing . 
Although foreign entities are allowed to participate , they must do so under local rules , which include employment protections for [MISC Libyan  ] workers and divesting shares to a wide number of individual owners ( with a preference for [MISC Libyans  ] ) . 
CONVERSION AND TRANSFER POLICIES 10.From February 1999 to December 2001 , [LOC Libya  ] maintained a dual exchange rate , with the official rate pegged to a Special Drawing Right ( [ORG SDR  ] ) at the rate of 1LD=.608 SDRs . 
State import agencies effected transactions using the official rate . 
Since 2001 , the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Dinar  ] has been unofficially pegged to the [MISC U.S. Dollar  ] ( allowed to float within a specified band ) . 
With a 50% devaluation of the official rate in 2002 , the two rates were effectively unified . 
A further 15% devaluation took place in June of 2003 . 
In June of the same year , [LOC Libya  ] agreed to the terms of [ORG IMF Article IV consultations  ] , which called for , among other things , advanced import requirements and an end to the 15% exchange tax and subsidy . 
11.Individuals with residence permits are permitted to hold foreign currency in [MISC Libyan  ] accounts . 
Non-residents working in [LOC Libya  ] may open domestic accounts in which to hold earnings . 
[ORG Central Bank  ] approval is required for all other credits to non-resident accounts . 
Per-transaction withdrawals are limited to 5,000 USD in cash and 10,000 USD in travelers' checks ( [ORG Note: Traveler  ] 's checks are not widely accepted in [LOC Libya  ] . 
End Note ) . 
12.The right to open an account in a convertible currency in a [MISC Libyan  ] commercial bank is provided for companies entering [LOC Libya  ] under [ORG Law No.5.The Libyan Banking Law  ] ( [ORG Law No.  ] 1 of 2005 ) allows any [MISC Libyan  ] person or entity to retain foreign exchange TRIPOLI 00000039 003.2 OF 010 and conduct exchanges in that currency . 
[MISC Libyan  ] commercial banks are allowed to open accounts in foreign exchange and conduct cash payments and transfers ( including abroad ) in foreign currency . 
Commercial banks operating in [LOC Libya  ] may grant credit in foreign exchange and transact in foreign exchange among themselves . 
Entities engaging in foreign exchange must be licensed by the [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
Foreign exchange facilities are available at most large hotels and airports , and ATMs are becoming more widely available . 
The importation of currency must be declared at time of entry . 
It is illegal to import or export [MISC Libyan  ] Dinars in any quantity . 
13.Most firms seeking to receive payment for services/products in [LOC Libya  ] operate using Letters of Credit ( [ORG LOCs  ] ) facilitated through foreign banks ( often based in [LOC Europe  ] ) . 
Foreign energy companies remitting large sums often make arrangements for direct transfers to accounts offshore . 
There have been reports of difficulties arranging [ORG LOCs  ] with [MISC Libyan  ] entities , owing to a range of institutional inefficiencies that slow the closure of deals , causing them to collapse as prices rise and deadlines slip . 
EXPROPRIATION AND COMPENSATION 14.The [MISC Libyan  ] government has a history of state expropriation of private property , including the assets of foreign companies . 
These actions were most prevalent during the 1980 's , taken largely for ideological reasons , and included the nationalization of whole industries with the stated purpose of greater wealth distribution among the population . 
These activities appear to have fallen out of practice as a tool of government policy , although regime rhetoric in early 2009 involving the possible nationalization of the oil sector in light of falling world oil prices has brought the issue back to the fore . 
In recent years , the [MISC Libyan  ] government has taken steps to expand the rights of [MISC Libyans  ] to operate private enterprises and buy and rent property . 
15.Several high-profile expropriations made in the energy sector have been resolved through a process of negotiations between the government and the affected companies . 
With the advent of a series of economic reforms and efforts at greater transparency since 2004 , the prospect for government appropriation appears to be in decline . 
There have been other instances of compensation by the state for expropriated property , but figures related to the terms provided are not available . 
16.With the imposition of Law 443 of 2006 , local ownership is essentially enforced for most foreign entities seeking to do business in [LOC Libya  ] , as well as many established before the law came into effect . 
While this law boosts the percentage of foreign ownership when compared with previous regulations , it requires that at least 35% of non-Libyan businesses be controlled by [MISC Libyan  ] individuals or companies . 
This law has made competent [MISC Libyan  ] partners in all sectors a highly valuable commodity for foreign investors , providing ample fuel for rent-seeking behavior in many sectors of the economy . 
DISPUTE SETTLEMENT <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] court system consists of three levels: the courts of first instance , the courts of appeal ( also known as the courts of cassation ) ; and the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , which is the final appellate level . 
The [ORG GPC  ] appoints justices to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] . 
Special " revolutionary courts " may operate outside the court system to try political offenses and crimes against the state . 
" People 's courts , " another example of extrajudicial authority , were abolished in January 2005 . 
A decree providing for state security courts was propagated in late 2007 , and security courts were established in spring 2008 . 
Matters related to personal law in [LOC Libya  ] 's justice system are nominally based on [MISC Sharia  ] law . 
Other issues , including the commercial code , are largely based on [MISC Italian  ] law , much of which dates to the 1950 's . <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
[LOC Libya  ] is not a signatory to the [ORG U.N. Convention  ] on the [MISC Recognition  ] and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards ( The " [ORG New York Convention  ] " ) . 
In the case of commercial disputes , most foreign entities currently opt to try cases before the [ORG International Chamber of Commerce  ] , the judgments of which [LOC Libya  ] has a history of respecting. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
The law governing agencies specifies cases in which a contract may be terminated by either party . 
Otherwise , local courts will rule on the legality of the termination and/or award TRIPOLI 00000039 004.2 OF 010 compensation to the injured party . 
Contracts are only exclusive if thus specified in the agency contract . 
Some agent-company disputes have reportedly been settled through direct appeal on the part of the foreign company to the General People 's [ORG Committee of Industry  ] , [ORG Economy  ] , and Trade . 
Given the relative newness of the private sector , little precedent exists in this area . 
PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND INCENTIVES <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
[LOC Libya  ] is not a member of the [ORG WTO  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's application was received by the [ORG WTO  ] on June 10 , 2004 . 
The General Council established a [ORG Working Party  ] on July 27 , 2004 , and [LOC Libya  ] is in the process of preparing its complete file for membership . 
Many of [LOC Libya  ] 's key supporting documents are in [MISC Arabic  ] ; translating these into correct , technically accurate [MISC English  ] has been a significant impediment , according to [MISC Libyan  ] trade officials. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
Under the terms of [ORG Investment Law No.  ] 5 ( 1997 ) , approved projects receive a 5 year corporate income tax holiday ( eligible for possible 3 year extension ) , exemption from corporate taxes and stamp tax on legal documents , exemption from customs duties and taxes on imports on project materials ( 5 years ) , and exemption from excise taxes for exported goods derived from the project . 
These incentives are only available for projects approved by the [ORG PIB  ] for implementation under [ORG Law No.  ] 5.They do not apply for projects disapproved by the [ORG PIB  ] , or to foreign and domestic investors implementing projects outside of [ORG Law No.  ] 5 ( joint stock companies , [MISC Libyan  ] agents , etc ) . 
Foreign firms and individuals generally have a more difficult time than [MISC Libyan  ] nationals accessing credit from [MISC Libyan  ] banks. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
Offsets are often a part of large foreign investment deals , particularly in the energy sector . 
" Corporate responsibility " and local staff training programs are common requirements for successful concession bids , and training programs in particular are generally essential to win bids on most [MISC Libyan  ] government contracts . 
These programs can range from the training of a handful of local staff up to multi-year programs exceeding [LOC US  ] $50 million for large energy companies . 
Also , some foreign firms have moved beyond these measures to bankroll much larger development projects . 
For example , following the October 2007 10-year extension of its holdings in [LOC Libya  ] , [MISC Italian  ] energy firm [ORG ENI Spa  ] announced that it had signed an MOU with the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] to provide [LOC US  ] $150 million for the building of hospitals and schools , and for the preservation of historical sites . 
Offsets of this type are very likely to remain a part of the business landscape for the foreseeable future. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
Regarding visa matters , current [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] visa policies are based on a framework of 'general reciprocity.' 
[LOC U.S.  ] citizens are usually issued single-entry visas , and frequently encounter significant delays and complications in obtaining visas . 
Visas must be obtained prior to travel to [LOC Libya  ] ; they require an invitation or sponsor , and can take up to several months to process . 
Residence permits are often difficult for foreign workers to obtain , and usually require several trips in and out of [LOC Libya  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] visitors to [LOC Libya  ] should expect to wait weeks to months for issuance . 
[MISC Libyan  ] visa practice is subject to change without notice , and can also be influenced by political factors . 
For example , in November 2007 , [LOC Libya  ] re-implemented an existing regulation requiring a stamped [MISC Arabic  ] translation in all passports . 
This requirement lacks clarity , is not applied in a uniform fashion and was implemented without prior warning . 
In December 2008 , the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Embassies  ] in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Paris  ] began to require that visa applicants appear in person and submit a lengthy list of supporting documents . 
This requirement was also imposed without prior notice , and was imposed worldwide in 2009 . 
In addition , political tensions between [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Canada  ] in 2009 resulted in [LOC Libya  ] 's withholding of visa approvals for [MISC Canadian  ] citizens . 
In the summer of 2008 , a member of the [ORG Qadhafi  ] family was arrested in [LOC Switzerland  ] , and as a result , [LOC Libya  ] detained two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen for a year and later charged them with visa violations ( as well as tax charges ) . 
As of January 2010 , they still were not permitted to leave [LOC Libya  ] and their cases were going through the [MISC Libyan  ] court system . 
Further information on visas can be found in the [LOC Country-Specific Information  ] for [LOC Libya  ] at the [ORG State Department  ] website: http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/ cis_951.html . 
RIGHT TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND ESTABLISHMENT <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
Laws and regulations on investment and property ownership allow domestic and foreign entities to establish business TRIPOLI 00000039 005.2 OF 010 enterprises and engage in remunerative activities . 
However , the regulatory and legal environment is complex , and there is a systemic bias which favors government sector companies and [MISC Libyan  ] firms over foreign entities . 
Foreign companies have several options for operating in [LOC Libya  ] , including the establishment of joint ventures/joint stock companies , representative offices or to enter [LOC Libya  ] under the terms of [ORG Law No.5  ] . 
However , foreign investors are increasingly being encouraged to form joint ventures with [MISC Libyan  ] entities in accordance with [ORG Law  ] 443 of 2006 . 
In practical terms , this has restricted the terms of foreign entry into the market. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
Since 2004 , foreign nationals and companies are allowed to lease property from private [MISC Libyan  ] citizens . 
Rights to land ownership are possible only for foreign companies entering [LOC Libya  ] under the terms of [ORG Law No.5.There  ] is considerable ambiguity in both the public and private rental markets ; many aspects of these arrangements are left to local officials . 
Market distortions exist for various supplies related to housing , including industrial and construction supplies , and there is a lack of transparency in the distribution of these materials . 
The return of foreign companies and investors to [LOC Libya  ] in 2003 has fueled a rapid increase in the price of rental housing and office space , and set off a construction boom . 
This has generated additional pressures on prices and building materials . 
PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
[MISC Libyan  ] property rights are complicated by past government policy actions and a weak regulatory environment . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] government eliminated all private property rights in March 1978 , and eliminated most private businesses later in the same year . 
The renting of property was declared illegal , and ownership of property was limited to a single dwelling per family , with all other properties being redistributed . 
Reduced rate " mortgages " were paid directly to the [MISC Libyan  ] government , but many [MISC Libyans  ] were exempted from these payments based on family income . 
This process , and the destruction of official property documents that followed several years later , has greatly complicated subsequent efforts to gain clear titles to property throughout [LOC Libya.  ] <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
Trademark violations are widespread and violators are adept at producing credible fakes . 
[LOC U.S.  ] brands are at the present time extremely vulnerable to such activity , for their presumed high quality and [LOC Libya  ] 's lack of direct experience with the " real thing . 
" The entry of several [LOC U.S.  ] firms ( most often through agents ) has served to curtail some of the worst abuses related to their product lines . 
The General Authority for [ORG Products Control  ] has established branches in seven [MISC Libyan  ] cities , but they are primarily focused on health and safety issues . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] has noted several cases in which foreign firms successfully pursued claims against trademark infringements by local ( [MISC Libyan  ] ) companies. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
While [LOC Libya  ] is in the process of applying for entry to the [ORG WTO  ] , it is not currently a member , and thus is not a party to the Agreement on [MISC Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  ] ( TRIPS ) . 
The [ORG IMF  ] has called upon [LOC Libya  ] to bring its IPR regime in line with international best practice , and the General People 's Committee for [MISC Industy  ] , Economy and Trade is reportedly making a renewed effort to deal with the problem , although clear evidence of progress is not apparent . 
TRANSPARENCY OF REGULATORY SYSTEM <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] regulatory system is not transparent ; the function and responsibilities of [LOC Libya  ] 's myriad government institutions are opaque and often contradictory . 
[ORG Transparency International  ] ranked [LOC Libya  ] 130th out of 180 countries ( " 1 " indicating least corrupt ) in its 2009 [MISC Corruption Perceptions Index  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's legal and policy frameworks are similarly difficult to navigate . 
The issuance of licenses and permits is often delayed for significant periods for unspecified reasons , and such applications often appear to be adjudicated in a subjective fashion . 
The lack of transparency and clearly delineated lines of decision-making within [MISC Libyan  ] institutions have fostered an environment in which graft and rent-seeking behavior are common. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
Accurate , current information on the [MISC Libyan  ] market and key commercial regulations is difficult to obtain . 
There are no non-governmental organizations present in [LOC Libya  ] to help facilitate regulatory transparency . 
EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT TRIPOLI 00000039 006.2 OF 010 <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's banking system is dominated by four banks , which are owned in full or in the majority by the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] ( [LOC Jamahiriya Bank  ] , which merged with [ORG Umma Bank  ] in 2008 , [LOC Wahda Bank  ] , [ORG Sahara Bank  ] , and the [ORG National Commercial Bank )  ] . 
These banks constitute almost ninety percent of [LOC Libya  ] 's banking sector assets . 
All of these banks have capital of at least 100 million [MISC Libyan  ] Dinars , and two of them ( [LOC Wahda Bank  ] and [ORG Sahara Bank  ] ) , were recently privatized . 
[LOC France  ] 's [ORG BNP Paribas  ] acquired 19% of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Sahara Bank  ] in July 2007 , and took operational control of the bank . 
The deal also included an option allowing [ORG BNP Paribas  ] to purchase additional shares of up to 51% of [LOC Sahara  ] 's capital over the next three to five years . 
In November 2007 , five foreign banks were shortlisted for the privatization of [LOC Wahda Bank  ] , including [MISC French  ] , [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC Jordanian  ] , [MISC Bahraini  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] institutions ; the [ORG Arab Bank of Jordan  ] was selected . 
The [ORG Arab Bank of Jordan  ] bid on a 19% share of [LOC Wahda Bank  ] , with the option to increase their ownership to 51% in three to five years . 
The [ORG Central  ] [PER Bank  ] announced in October 2007 that it would merge [ORG Umma  ] [PER Bank  ] and [LOC Jamahiriya Bank  ] into a single entity ; that process was completed in 2008 , although there are still branches open under the banner of each bank . 
The [ORG Central  ] [PER Bank  ] also owns the [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign [PER Bank  ] , which operates as an offshore bank , with responsibility for satisfying [LOC Libya  ] 's international banking needs ( apart from foreign investment ) . 
In addition , there are four specialized banks owned by the General People 's Committee for [ORG Finance:  ] the [ORG Agricultural Bank , Real Estate Investment Bank , Development  ] [PER Bank  ] and [ORG Reefi Bank  ] . 
There are also four substantial private banks ( [PER Bank  ] of [ORG Commerce and Development  ] , [ORG Amen Bank  ] , [ORG Al-Jimaa  ] al-Arabi [PER Bank  ] and [ORG Wafa Bank  ] ) and forty-eight smaller regional banks. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
The availability of financing on the local market is weak . 
[MISC Libyan  ] banks offer limited financial products , loans are often made on the basis of personal connections ( rather than business plans ) , and public bank managers lack clear incentives to expand their portfolios . 
Lack of financing acts as a brake on [LOC Libya  ] 's development , hampering both the completion of existing projects and the start of new ones . 
This has been particularly damaging in the housing sector , where particularly small-scale projects often languish for lack of steady funding streams. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] banking system is currently undergoing a substantial modernization program to upgrade available services/products , deal with large numbers of non-performing loans , establish a functioning national payments system , facilitate the use of non-cash payment instruments and institute new standards of accounting and training . 
While foreign banks are technically able to enter the [MISC Libyan  ] market under the Banking Law of 2005 , the [ORG Central Bank  ] has sought to delay their entry until the reform process has taken hold . 
COMPETITION FROM STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
Private enterprises are allowed to compete with public enterprises under the same terms and conditions with respect to access to markets , credit , and other business operations . 
However , since approximately 80 percent of the economy consists of public sector entities , most large companies are government-owned and therefore , are the only companies that have the required capital to form joint ventures with foreign partners . 
SOEs are active in all sectors in [LOC Libya  ] and especially in the Energy , [ORG Telecommunications  ] , and Construction sectors. <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
In terms of corporate governance , most state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) have a ten-member board of directors . 
The company 's senior management reports to this board , which in turn reports to a government Minister ( called a Secretary in [LOC Libya  ] ) . 
In reality , most important decisions are made by the high-level government officials who instruct the senior management. <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
[LOC Libya  ] has a sovereign wealth fund ( [ORG SWF  ] ) , known as the [ORG Libyan Investment Authority  ] ( [ORG LIA  ] ) , which was established in 2007 . 
The [ORG LIA  ] is ultimately overseen by the prime minister , with an 11-member board of trustees . 
According to the [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] ( [ORG IMF  ] ) , the [ORG LIA  ] invests mostly abroad although some of its investments are being channeled to the domestic [MISC Libyan  ] oil sector and to the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Development and Investment Fund  ] ( which has holdings of 16 billion [MISC Libyan  ] dinars or approximately [LOC US  ] $13 billion ) . 
This fund was established in March 2009 in partnership with the [ORG Central Bank of Libya  ] and the private sector. <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
Neither state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) nor [LOC Libya  ] 's sovereign TRIPOLI 00000039 007.2 OF 010 wealth fund ( [ORG LIA  ] ) are required by law to publish an annual report . 
The practice , however , is for SOEs to produce financial statements but not to have them independently audited . 
These companies primarily undergo internal audits and are not reviewed by independent , third-party auditors . 
[MISC CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  ] <a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38 . 
While the term " [MISC Corporate Social Responsibility  ] " is not well-known in [LOC Libya  ] , the general concept of companies helping local charities and members of the community in need does exist . 
For example , one state-owned enterprise provides office space to an organization that assists children in need of cancer treatment . 
Many foreign companies have programs with communities and officials to address needs in healthcare , road safety , and education . 
While most firms follow generally accepted [ORG CSR  ] principles , the extent to which they follow the [ORG OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises  ] is unknown . 
Firms who pursue [ORG CSR  ] are viewed favorably by the general public and by officials . 
As noted above , elements of " [MISC Corporate Social Responsibility  ] " and local staff training programs are common requirements for successful bids in the energy and construction sectors . 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE <a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39 . 
[LOC Libya  ] has experienced political violence . 
In December 2008 , demonstrators threw rocks at the [MISC Egyptian  ] Embassy in protest of [LOC Egypt  ] 's policies in connection with events in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
The [MISC Mauritanian  ] Embassy was also targeted . 
Protests in the city of [LOC Benghazi  ] in response to the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet [PER Muhammad  ] in a [MISC Danish  ] magazine on February 17 , 2006 , resulted in the deaths of at least ten people and severe damage to the [MISC Italian  ] consulate and a number of businesses . 
[LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC Libya  ] have not been targets of political violence since the reestablishment of diplomatic ties in late 2003 . 
Peaceful demonstrations , small and large , do occur periodically. <a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40 . 
The Government of [LOC Libya  ] takes active measures to maintain public security , and to prevent terrorist attacks . 
Recent worldwide terrorist alerts have stated that extremist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks against [LOC U.S.  ] interests in the [LOC Middle East  ] region , including [LOC Libya  ] . 
Visitors to [LOC Libya  ] should consult the [ORG Department of State  ] 's latest travel information on [LOC Libya  ] and the region at: http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis_ pa_tw_1168.html . 
CORRUPTION <a id='par41' href='#par41'>¶</a>41 . 
Despite high-profile campaigns designed to draw attention to the issue , corruption remains widespread in [LOC Libya  ] . 
It frequently takes the form of openly solicited or thinly veiled requests for valueless intermediation ( i.e. , rent seeking ) or outright payoffs . 
This could include approvals for basic bureaucratic processes , such as required permits and services provided only by the government . 
Given the state of bureaucratic inefficiency and low salaries for government employees in [LOC Libya  ] , these types of transactions are generally viewed as a necessary part of doing business by local operators . 
Moreover , there is a general public perception that such interventions are essential to ensure the best pricing , service , etc . 
This tendency serves to reinforce the importance of personal connections and insider knowledge in the conduct of day-to-day business operations. <a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42 . 
While there are quasi-governmental organizations in [LOC Libya  ] , non-governmental organizations ( [ORG NGOs  ] ) do not exist in practice . 
There are no international , regional or [ORG NGO  ] " watchdog " organizations present in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Several websites critical of government corruption are operated by [MISC Libyan  ] opposition groups located outside of the country . 
[LOC Libya  ] is a signatory to the [MISC UN Convention Against Corruption  ] ( [ORG UNCAC  ] ) , but there has been little evidence of its implementation. <a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43 . 
The government has established the " [MISC Administration and Oversight Board  ] " as the responsible [MISC Libyan  ] agency for the oversight of government activities for the prevention of corrupt practices . 
There has also been a public push for transparency on the part of high-ranking government officials . 
A series of speeches by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi during late 2006 set out a four-month window for all officials occupying senior government positions to declare all of their earnings and assets or risk unspecified punitive action by the state . 
In January 2007 this deadline was extended for several months , and there were reports of arrests of leading businessmen on allegations of corrupt practices . 
Out of 4,600 files of senior government officials TRIPOLI 00000039 008.2 OF 010 that were reviewed , 150 were suspected of corruption , and out of those , 20 were referred to the courts for judicial action . 
However , there was no clarity as to whether these actions were directly related to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's ultimatum . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] leader and his son , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , did address corruption in broad terms in a number of other public remarks made in 2007 and 2008 , and called for greater accountability . 
[ORG BILATERAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS  ] <a id='par44' href='#par44'>¶</a>44 . 
There are no bilateral investment agreements in force between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG USTR  ] and [LOC Libya  ] are negotiating a [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIFA  ] ) which is expected to be finalized and signed in 2010 . 
[LOC Libya  ] has also stated its interest in concluding a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45 . 
[LOC Libya  ] has concluded a number of bilateral economic cooperation agreements with [ORG EU  ] member states , and with [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Tunisia  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] , [LOC Singapore  ] and others . 
The terms of these agreements vary , ranging from MOUs with no binding aspects to more substantial agreements that grant " most favored nation " trade benefits , joint investment funds , and the abolishment of visas for [MISC Libyans  ] and the other country . 
[LOC Libya  ] has concluded a number of tax treaties , including a new agreement with the [LOC UK  ] in late 2007. <a id='par46' href='#par46'>¶</a>46 . 
[LOC Libya  ] is a member of the 1989 [ORG Arab Maghreb Union  ] ( [ORG AMU  ] ) linking [LOC Tunisia  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Mauritania  ] , and [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [ORG AMU  ] 's stated objectives include the encouragement of free movement of goods and people , revision and simplification of customs regulations , and movement towards a common currency . 
Nominally , [ORG AMU  ] mandates duty-free trade among its members . 
Disputes between [ORG AMU  ] members have prevented significant progress within the group . 
[LOC Libya  ] is also a founding member of the Community of [LOC Sahel-Saharan States  ] ( [ORG CEN-SAD  ] ) . 
[ORG CEN-SAD  ] 's [ORG Secretariat  ] and the [ORG CEN-SAD Bank for Investment and Trade  ] are both headquartered in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[ORG CEN-SAD  ] is dedicated to creating an economic union among its 23 member states , although it has not made great progress toward this goal . 
[ORG Citizens  ] of [ORG CEN-SAD  ] member countries are afforded the use of dedicated immigration stalls upon arrival at [LOC Libya  ] 's major airports. <a id='par47' href='#par47'>¶</a>47 . 
[LOC Libya  ] is a part of the [ORG Greater Arab Free Trade Area  ] ( [ORG GAFTA  ] , also called [ORG PAFTA  ] , [ORG Pan Arab Free Trade Agreement  ] ) and the [ORG Euro-Med Partnership  ] ( [ORG EMP  ] ) , also known as the " [ORG Barcelona Process  ] , " a dialogue between the [ORG European Union  ] and 12 [MISC Mediterranean  ] countries . 
The [ORG Barcelona Declaration of November  ] 27 , 1995 outlined goals of reducing political instability and increasing commercial integration . 
In 1999 , 27 [ORG EMP  ] partners agreed to admit [LOC Libya  ] contingent on [LOC Libya  ] 's accepting the [ORG Barcelona  ] acquis . 
In February 2004 , [LOC Libya  ] announced its intention to join the [ORG Barcelona  ] process in full , but no formal [MISC Libyan  ] request has been made to date . 
[ORG OPIC  ] AND [ORG OTHER INVESTMENT INSURANCE PROGRAMS  ] <a id='par48' href='#par48'>¶</a>48 . 
President [PER Bush  ] waived bans on [ORG Export-Import Bank  ] activities in [LOC Libya  ] on February 28 , 2006 , and [ORG EXIM  ] has conducted two visits to [LOC Libya  ] since that time . 
[ORG EXIM  ] offers financing assistance to [LOC US  ] export projects with [MISC Libyan  ] government-owned entities in three areas: the aviation sector , project finance ( requiring predictability and hard revenue streams ) , and projects backed by the full faith and credit of the [MISC Libyan  ] government ( i.e. , a " sovereign guarantee " ) for loan repayment. <a id='par49' href='#par49'>¶</a>49 . 
[ORG OPIC  ] does not as yet offer financing or guarantees for [LOC U.S.  ] business activity in [LOC Libya  ] . 
A senior-level [ORG OPIC  ] delegation visited [LOC Libya  ] in 2005 to discuss with [MISC Libyan  ] authorities a proposed bilateral agreement , and the Deputy Foreign Minister met with [ORG OPIC  ] officials in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] in 2007 to discuss the issue further . 
LABOR <a id='par50' href='#par50'>¶</a>50 . 
While official figures put the unemployment rate at 13% , unofficial estimates place the real rate at 30 to 40% . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's labor force numbers about 1.3 million persons , roughly 31% of whom work in industry , 27% in services , 24% in government and 18% in agriculture . 
Despite laws prohibiting moonlighting by civil service employees , many government functionaries hold multiple jobs . 
The majority of [MISC Libyan  ] women hold some form of employment outside the home . 
[MISC Libyan  ] labor law stipulates minimum wage , working hours , night shift regulations , dismissal and training . 
Laws governing dismissal are reasonably strict , and [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000039 009.2 OF 010 favor the employee. <a id='par51' href='#par51'>¶</a>51 . 
Foreign workers make up a significant percentage of the [MISC Libyan  ] labor pool , particularly in the service industries and manual labor jobs . 
During the 1980 's , the [MISC Libyan  ] government increased pressure on foreign workers and contractors , which it saw as consuming valuable foreign exchange and contributing to a growing unemployment problem . 
In 1983 , 560,000 foreigners worked in [LOC Libya  ] ; by 1986 , the number dropped to less than 200,000 . 
As oil revenues rebounded in the early 1990 's and [LOC Libya  ] increased its profile on the [MISC African  ] continent , al-Qadhafi announced an " open borders " policy , prompting a massive influx of work-seekers from [LOC Chad  ] , [LOC Ghana  ] , [LOC Niger  ] , and other [MISC Sub-Saharan African  ] states . 
Unable to find work in [LOC Libya  ] , many of these immigrants have continued northward and have contributed to the economic migrant problem in [LOC Southern Europe  ] . 
Migrants from [LOC Egypt  ] also make up a sizable portion of [LOC Libya  ] 's informal labor force . 
With mounting pressure from the [ORG EU  ] , and rising unemployment at home , [LOC Libya  ] has in the past resorted to deportation . 
In early 2007 , officials announced a series of measures to reduce the presence of illegal workers in [LOC Libya  ] . 
In late 2007 , the [MISC Egyptian  ] border was temporarily closed to migratory workers . 
The Secretary of the [ORG GPC for Manpower , Employment and Training  ] has called on all [MISC Libyan  ] and foreign employers to ensure the legality of their employees under Labor Law No. 58 , including the warning that failure to do so will result in punishment ranging from fines , to withdrawal of work permits , to imprisonment. <a id='par52' href='#par52'>¶</a>52 . 
Law No. 15 , passed in 1981 , capped government salaries at between 150 and 500 [MISC Libyan  ] Dinars ( [ORG LD  ] ) per month , depending on grade . 
There had been no cost of living adjustment from that date until 2006 , when several changes were instituted to raise minimum salaries in the public and private sectors . 
[ORG GPC Decision No.  ] 277 of 2006 established basic government salaries at the following levels: 130 dinars for persons without dependents , 180 dinars for families with two members , and 220 dinars for a family of three of more members . 
Additional [ORG GPC Decisions  ] during 2007 raised minimum salaries for other categories of employees , including those with advanced degrees and technical skills and corporations not financed by the central government , and removed a pay cap in place for many types of work outside of the public sector . 
There were also targeted pay raises for , inter alia , [MISC Libyan  ] employees of state energy companies , healthcare workers and teachers. <a id='par53' href='#par53'>¶</a>53 . 
Independent trade unions and professional associations are illegal in [LOC Libya  ] . 
While workers do not have the right to form unions , they are allowed to participate in an organization called the [ORG National Trade Unions' Federation  ] , created in 1972 . 
Collective bargaining does not exist in any meaningful sense , as labor law requires government approval for all related actions. <a id='par54' href='#par54'>¶</a>54 . 
Unemployment is a major policy concern for the [MISC Libyan  ] government , particularly in light of an expected increase in the pace of privatization , which would inevitably release large numbers of state-salaried employees into the market . 
In addition , 78,000 students graduate from [LOC Libya  ] 's state-run universities and enter the labor market each year . 
Proposals have been discussed for the creation of mechanisms such as an early retirement fund , vast re-tooling/re-training programs , and the creation of some form of social safety net . 
There have been some government actions to provide shares in public and private companies to " those [MISC Libyans  ] deprived of wealth , " as well as the announcement by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi of the institution of government-funded savings accounts for [MISC Libyans  ] born after August 2007 . 
Also , in January 2007 , the [ORG GPC  ] coupled its announcement of the liquidation of 400,000 [MISC Libyan  ] government positions over a three-year period with news that the incumbents could either draw their regular salary or take a [LOC US  ] $43,000 loan designed to finance start-up costs of a small business. <a id='par55' href='#par55'>¶</a>55 . 
The government directly intervenes in the hiring practices of foreign companies operating in [LOC Libya  ] . 
For example , a 2006 decree ordered that all foreign oil companies must hire a [MISC Libyan  ] national Deputy County Manager and Finance Manager . 
In August 2009 , the government decreed that all foreign branch companies must hire [MISC Libyan  ] general managers , but the government has inconsistently applied the rule . 
The [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] also regularly assigns both qualified and unqualified [MISC Libyan  ] workers to foreign energy companies . 
Foreign companies have generally responded to the imposition of unqualified workers in one of two ways: paying these individuals without expecting them to work , or undertaking an extensive training program to bring them up to a basic industry standard . 
Companies also receive [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000039 010.2 OF 010 lists of unemployed workers from the General People 's [ORG Committee for Manpower  ] and are requested to voluntarily find positions for them . 
FOREIGN TRADE ZONE/FREE TRADE ZONES <a id='par56' href='#par56'>¶</a>56 . 
[LOC Misurata  ] , 210 km east of [LOC Tripoli  ] , is the location of [LOC Libya  ] 's sole operating [ORG Free Trade Zone  ] ( [ORG FTZ  ] ) . 
Projects in the free zone enjoy standard " Five [MISC Freedoms  ] " privileges , including tax and customs exemptions . 
At present , the zone occupies 430 hectares , including a portion of the Port of [LOC Misurata  ] . 
As of the end of 2008 , the infrastructure for the free zone was still under development . 
[LOC Dubai  ] 's [ORG Jafza International  ] signed an agreement with the [ORG Misurata FTZ Authority  ] in October 2007 which commits both sides to explore the possibility of forming a joint venture , or granting [ORG Jafza  ] a 30-year concession of over the [ORG FTZ  ] . 
Later in the same month , [LOC Libya  ] 's General People 's [ORG Committee  ] announced plans to allocate roughly [LOC US  ] $700 million to upgrade the free zone 's facilities . 
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT STATISTICS . 
Reliable foreign direct investment statistics for [LOC Libya  ] are currently unavailable . 
Foreign energy companies have invested billions of dollars in the [MISC Libyan  ] oil and gas sectors since the lifting of [ORG UN  ] sanctions in 2003 and [LOC U.S.  ] sanctions the following year . 
[LOC Libya  ] has announced vast new development projects , including plans that it would spend 150 billion dinars ( $123.4 billion ) on public works over the next five years . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] government has embarked on an ambitious plan to upgrade its infrastructure , and construction is underway to build new roads , airports , railroads , and housing .
