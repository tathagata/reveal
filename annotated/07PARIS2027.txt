2007 AND PREVIOUS [LOC PARIS  ] 00002027 001.2 OF 007 SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- HANDLE ACCORDINGLY SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( SBU ) Intent on maintaining the momentum for reform , President [PER Sarkozy  ] moved quickly following his inauguration May 16 ( ref B ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] named his administration 's first Prime Minster , [PER Francois Fillon  ] the following day , May 17 , then immediately named the line-up of the [PER Fillon  ] government on May 18 . 
The new government includes major figures from the wing of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's own Union for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] ( [ORG UMP  ] ) party that opposed [PER Sarkozy  ] 's nomination as the party 's presidential candidate , from the opposition [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) ( Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] ) and from the centrist Union for [MISC French  ] Democracy ( [ORG UDF  ] ) party ( Defense Minister [PER Herve Morin  ] ) . 
The [PER Fillon  ] government ministerial team is the fruit of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's outreach efforts across the political spectrum in the days immediately following his election ( ref A ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] -- very confident that the [ORG UMP  ] will keep its parliamentary majority following the upcoming June 10 and 17 legislative elections -- may well be accelerating his plans to implement reforms ; the newly named government is designed to reflect multi-partisan responsibility for the upcoming reform effort , which will be actively , personally directed by [PER Sarkozy  ] himself . 
END SUMMARY . 
BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT NAMED QUICKLY ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) As expected , President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] -- after naming [PER Francois Fillon  ] on May 17 the [PER Sarkozy  ] administration 's first prime minister -- immediately also named the members of the [PER Fillon  ] government . 
On May 18 , [PER Claude Gueant  ] , the new Secretary General of the [ORG Elysee Palace  ] who served as SIPDIS [PER Sarkozy  ] 's campaign manager during the presidential race , announced the composition of the new government ( for list names and bio info see paras 7 - 32 below ) . 
This government is the result of 1 ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's early decision to name [PER Fillon PM  ] ( ref B ) , as all [ORG UMP  ] electoral projections kept indicating a very likely [PER Sarkozy  ] victory ; and 2 ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's unexpected outreach efforts across the political spectrum in the days following his May 10 election victory ( ref A ) . 
" SARKOZY'S REFORM TEAM " ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) This government is " [PER Sarkozy  ] 's reform team , " with [PER Fillon  ] in the role of executive officer . 
All indications are that the [ORG UMP  ] will keep its current majority in the [ORG National Assembly  ] in the upcoming June 10 and 17 legislative elections . 
The composition of this government -- which includes prominent members from the formerly anti-Sarkozy faction of the [ORG UMP  ] ( [PER Juppe  ] and [PER Alliot-Marie  ] ) and a member from the opposition [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) [PER Kouchner  ] ) and one from the centrist Union for [MISC French  ] Democracy ( [ORG UDF  ] ) party ( [PER Morin  ] ) -- is designed to add the " multi-partisan , unity government " card to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's already very strong hand ( a mandate-giving victory and a new parliamentary majority ) for pursuing his reform agenda . 
On the reform implementation front , all indications are that [PER Sarkozy  ] plans to keep up the pace he as set not only in naming his administration 's first government in record time , but also in naming a government that , in effect , significantly restructures [LOC France  ] 's executive branch . 
FOUR FACETS OF RESTRUCTURING ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) As promised , the number of ministries has been reduced to 15 , driving a re-structuring of functions that divides the large and un-agile mega-ministries of economy and interior each into two " new " ministries . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's restructuring also includes the creation of a " super ministry " of [ORG Ecology  ] and [ORG Sustainable Development  ] . 
It also overtly moves foreign policy direction to the [ORG Elysee  ] . 
The economy ministry has been split into a pro-active [ORG Ministry of Economy  ] , Finance and Employment under former Social Solidarity Minister [PER Jean-Louis Borloo  ] , and a more accounting-oriented [ORG Ministry of Budget  ] , Public Accounting and [ORG Civil Service  ] under [ORG UMP  ] parliamentarian [PER Eric Woerth  ] . 
The [LOC PARIS  ] 00002027 002.2 OF 007 core interior ministry security functions remain in an [ORG Interior Ministry  ] under former Defense Minister [PER Michelle Alliot-Marie  ] , as immigration and naturalization matters move to a new [ORG Ministry of Immigration , Integration  ] , [ORG National  ] Identity and Co-development under [PER Sarkozy  ] 's closest political ally , [PER Brice Hortefeux.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's re-structuring includes the creation of a [ORG Ministry of Ecology  ] , [ORG Sustainable Development  ] and [ORG Sustainable Planning  ] under former Prime Minster [PER Alain Juppe  ] . 
[PER Juppe  ] also gets the title of Minister of State , which makes him number two in the government after Prime Minister [PER Fillon  ] . 
With regard to foreign affairs , [PER Sarkozy  ] has put policy direction firmly under his personal control at the [ORG Elysee  ] through a far-reaching role for outgoing Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] , in a role similar to that of the [ORG U.S. National Security Advisor  ] . 
By naming Socialist [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] ( of Doctors Without Borders fame ) as Foreign Minster , [PER Sarkozy  ] has put an emphasis on humanitarian and human rights matters in the mission of the [MISC Quai  ] d'Orsay A GOVERNMENT OF GENDER PARITY ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Also as promised , the new government observes gender parity -- seven of the new ministers are women . 
They are [PER Michele Alliot-Marie  ] ( Minister of [ORG Interior  ] , [LOC Overseas Territories  ] and [LOC Local Governments  ] ) , [PER Rachida Dati  ] ( Minister of Justice ) , [PER Valerie Pecresse  ] ( Minister of Higher Education and [ORG Research  ] ) , [PER Roselyn Bachelot  ] ( Minister of Health , Youth and Sports ) , [PER Christine Boutin  ] ( Minister of Housing and Cities ) , [PER Christine Lagarde  ] ( Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries ) , and [PER Christine Albanel  ] ( Minister of [ORG Culture and Communication  ] , Government Spokeswoman ) . 
Incidentally , the three top officials in this new [MISC French  ] administration , President [PER Sarkozy  ] , Prime Minister [PER Fillon  ] and Minister of State [PER Juppe  ] are graduates of the [ORG U.S. Government 's International Visitor Program  ] ( [ORG IVP  ] ) ( [PER Sarkozy  ] in 1985 , [PER Fillon  ] in 1984 and [PER Juppe  ] in 1978 ) . 
It is also noteworthy that the two top officials , [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Fillon  ] , are not graduates of [LOC France  ] 's elite school for top civil-servants , the [ORG National School of Administration  ] ( [ORG ENA  ] ) . 
There follow biographical sketches of the new government 's Prime Minister ( [PER Fillon  ] ) , Foreign Minster ( [PER Kouchner  ] ) , Defense Minister ( [PER Morin  ] ) and the government 's number two ( [PER Juppe  ] ) , who is Minister of [ORG Ecology  ] , [ORG Sustainable Development  ] and [ORG Sustainable Planning  ] , and thumbnail bios of the other members of the new government . 
Prime Minister ) [PER Francois Fillon  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Francois Fillon  ] , a former Gaullist with a keen interest in social affairs and defense issues , was named Prime Minister on May 17 , 2007 . 
[PER Fillon  ] broke ranks with former President [PER Chirac  ] following the [ORG UMP  ] 's crushing electoral defeats in the regional and [MISC European  ] elections of <a id='par2004' href='#par2004'>¶</a>2004 . 
[PER Fillon  ] blamed [PER Chirac  ] 's slow pace of social reforms for that electoral defeat , and has since vowed to move quickly to implement President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's reform agenda . 
[PER Fillon  ] is best known for pushing through a controversial reform of the national pension system in 2003 -- arguably the most significant reform passed during [PER Jacques Chirac  ] 's 12-year presidency. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fillon  ] served in the [LOC Raffarin  ] government as Minister of Education from 2004-05 , and as Minister of Social Affairs , Labor , and Solidarity from 2002-04 . 
[PER Fillon  ] is given high marks for his handling of several politically sensitive labor reform measures during the 2002-04 period , including a de facto extension of the 35-hour workweek ( by allowing employees to work more overtime hours ) ; simplifying and raising the minimum wage ; and passage of a controversial pension reform bill . 
Several of [PER Fillon  ] 's proposed reforms to the education system , however , were watered down or withdrawn in an ( ultimately unsuccessful ) effort to mollify public opinion in advance of the vote on the [ORG EU Constitution.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fillon  ] served as a [ORG National Assembly  ] Deputy from the [ORG Sarthe  ] department ( in western [LOC France  ] ) between 1981-93 and 1997-2002 . 
Throughout the 1980s and 90s , he was considered a leading expert on defense-related issues and served as chairman of the [ORG Assembly  ] 's [ORG Defense Committee  ] during 1986-88 . 
He was among the few [MISC Gaullists  ] to call for greater [MISC French  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00002027 003.2 OF 007 participation in [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Fillon  ] also served as Minister for Higher Education and [ORG Research  ] during the government of [PER Edouard Balladur  ] ( 1993-95 ) , and as Deputy Minister for [ORG Posts , Telecommunications  ] , and Space during the government of [PER Alain Juppe  ] ( 1995-97 ) .

The couple has five children . 
[PER Fillon  ] has made several trips to the [LOC United States  ] , including a tour as an IV grantee in 1984 . 
Minister of Foreign and [MISC European  ] -------------------------------- Affairs ) [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a surprise move , President [PER Sarkozy  ] has appointed world renowned humanitarian [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] as Minister of Foreign and [MISC European  ] Affairs . 
[PER Kouchner  ] 's appointment to lead the [LOC Quai  ] d'Orsay represents the fulfillment of a longtime dream for the celebrated champion of humanitarian causes . 
[PER Kouchner  ] has made a career out of drawing attention to international humanitarian issues . 
His numerous efforts include projects in [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Bosnia  ] , [LOC Northern Iraq  ] , [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Ethiopia  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Considered a maverick among his [ORG Socialist Party  ] colleagues , [PER Kouchner  ] was one of the few politicians ( left or right ) to openly support the [MISC American-led  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 . 
An experienced administrator , he has held three ministerial portfolios in Socialist governments: as Junior-Minister for Health ( 1997-98 and 2001-2002 ) , as Minister of Health and [ORG Humanitarian Affairs  ] ( 1992-93 ) , and as Secretary of State for [ORG Humanitarian Affairs  ] ( 1988-92 ) . 
During 1994-97 , [PER Kouchner  ] served as a Member of the [MISC European  ] Parliament .

In this capacity he acted as a virtual governor of the province during its occupation by a [MISC NATO-led  ] peacekeeping force . 
He had the power to levy taxes , write new laws , and form a police force . 
[PER Kouchner  ] 's appointment represented a diplomatic victory for President [PER Jacques Chirac  ] , who lobbied aggressively on [PER Kouchner  ] 's behalf . 
Upon conclusion of his mandate , [PER Kouchner  ] received international praise for his competence , objectivity , and dedication . 
In recent years [PER Kouchner  ] has unsuccessfully bid on two top [ORG IO  ] positions: [ORG UN  ] High Commissioner on Refugees and head of the [ORG World Health Organization.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [PER Kouchner  ] has been active in aiding distressed populations throughout the world since the late-1960s , when he began working in [LOC Biafra  ] and [LOC Chad  ] . 
A gastroenterologist by training , [PER Kouchner  ] left his [LOC Paris  ] medical practice behind and , in 1971 , helped found &Medecins [PER Sans Frontieres8  ] ( Doctors Without [ORG Borders  ] ) , an organization of volunteer doctors dedicated to helping patients in disadvantaged countries around the world . 
Following a rift with other founding members , [PER Kouchner  ] set up Doctors of the World in <a id='par1980' href='#par1980'>¶</a>1980. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 .

They have one child . 
[PER Kouchner  ] speaks excellent [MISC English  ] . 
Minister of Defense ) [PER Herve Morin  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Herve Morin  ] has represented the rural , 3rd district of the [MISC Eure  ] department in the [ORG National Assembly  ] since 1988 . 
He is a member of the centrist [ORG Union  ] for [MISC French  ] Democracy ( [ORG UDF  ] ) party . 
[PER Morin  ] has been the leader of the [ORG UDF  ] parliamentary group in the assembly since 2002 , and was widely seen as the leader of the [ORG UDF  ] parliamentarians who [LOC PARIS  ] 00002027 004.2 OF 007 rallied to [PER Sarkozy  ] once [ORG UDF  ] leader [PER Francois Bayrou  ] was eliminated in the first round of the presidential race . 
[PER Morin  ] has been a close Embassy contact . 
Friendly and direct , he is unabashed about his affection for the [LOC U.S.  ] , often referring to his [ORG Normandy  ] roots and the grateful memories of the Liberation that he calls " our heritage . 
" The [MISC French  ] press characterizes [PER Morin  ] as among the most Atlanticist of all deputies . 
A relative newcomer on the national political stage , [PER Morin  ] worked as an administrator in the [ORG National Assembly  ] beginning in 1978 , and thus cannot be considered a neophyte in the [ORG Assembly  ] 's corridors of power . 
He was a counselor for parliamentary relations to then-Minister of Defense [PER Francois Leotard  ] ( [ORG UDF  ] ) during 1993-95 , and also served as spokesman and project coordinator for [PER Francois Bayrou  ] 's 2002 presidential campaign. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In relatively short order , [PER Morin  ] became a member of [PER Bayrou  ] 's inner circle , largely by remaining a [ORG UDF  ] loyalist while other party leaders were defecting to [PER Chirac  ] 's camp in the run-up to the 2002 presidential election . 
In [PER Bayrou  ] 's 2007 presidential bid , [PER Morin  ] filled a range of roles in the campaign: coordinator for special communication projects and point man for refuting UMP charges made against [ORG UDF  ] proposals . 
[PER Morin  ] understands some [MISC English  ] , but prefers to speak [MISC French  ] . 
Minister of [ORG Ecology and Development  ] ) [PER Alain Juppe  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former Prime Minister [PER Alain Juppe  ] , once famously described as " the best among us " by his mentor [PER Jacques Chirac  ] , has returned to the national political stage to lead a new " super ministry of ecology and economic development " formally called the [ORG Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development  ] and [ORG Planning  ] . 
[PER Juppe  ] also gets the , largely honorary , but coveted Minister of State title which places him second ( behind PM [PER Fillon  ] ) in the government 's official protocol ranking . 
[PER Juppe  ] 's high-profile appointment underlines President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's commitment to leading action on global warming . 
In his May 6 victory address to the nation , [PER Sarkozy  ] highlighted the need for the [LOC United States  ] , with [LOC France  ] , to " take the lead " in the fight against climate change. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Juppe  ] 's appointment to a senior government post represents a political comeback for the man once seen as [PER Jacques Chirac  ] 's likeliest ( and preferred ) successor . 
[PER Juppe  ] 's conviction , in 2004 , on charges relating illegally paid for political party staffers severely damaged his political career . 
[PER Juppe  ] was given a 14-month suspended sentence and one-year of ineligibility from holding public office . 
[PER Juppe  ] was forced to resign from both his seat in the [ORG National Assembly  ] and his local elective office as mayor of [LOC Bordeaux  ] . 
But more importantly , his resignation from the presidency of the UMP opened the door for [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] to take over . 
During 2005 [PER Juppe  ] taught a year-long seminar on globalization at [LOC Quebec  ] 's [ORG National School of Administration  ] . 
During his stint in [LOC North America  ] he became increasingly interested in environmental advocacy and , by his own account , was greatly influenced by the anti-global warming campaign directed by former Vice-President [PER Al Gore  ] . 
Minister of [ORG Economy  ] , Finance and -------------------------------- Employment -- [PER Jean Louis Borloo  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Jean-Louis Borloo  ] has been tapped to lead the newly revamped [ORG Ministry of Economy  ] , Finance and Employment which now includes enhanced powers over employment issues and economic strategy . 
A political maverick with a populist streak , [PER Borloo  ] previously served in the [MISC Raffarin  ] and [PER Villepin  ] governments as Minister for Employment , Labor and [MISC Social Cohesion  ] during 2004-07 . 
He was also Junior Minister for [MISC Towns  ] and [ORG Urban Renewal  ] from 2002-04 . 
In recent months [PER Borloo  ] has overseen development of [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] 's so-called " [PER Marshall Plan  ] for the [MISC Suburbs  ] , " which seeks to revive employment and education prospects in immigrant neighborhoods . 
Self-assured , frank and quick-to-action , [PER Borloo  ] remains a highly popular figure among the general public . 
Minister of [LOC Interior  ] , [LOC Overseas Territories  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00002027 005.2 OF 007 ------------------------------------------ and [LOC Local Governments  ] -- [PER Michele Alliot-Marie  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Neo-Gaullist [PER Michele Alliot-Marie  ] has been named to lead the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , [LOC Overseas Territories  ] and [LOC Local Governments  ] by President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] . 
Often referred to by her initials as " [ORG MAM  ] " in the [MISC French  ] press , [PER Alliot-Marie  ] is one of the few holdovers from the [PER Chirac  ] administration and was likely retained because of her strong support during the campaign and , at least in part , because of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's desire to maintain gender parity in his new administration . 
[PER Alliot-Marie  ] served ably as Minister of Defense from 2002-07 , becoming the first woman in [MISC French  ] history to hold that position . 
Known as a " hands-on " minister , [PER Alliot-Marie  ] was well liked and respected by [ORG French Armed Forces  ] personnel . 
During her tenure she fought successfully to prevent drastic cuts to the defense budget , and made several visits to [MISC French  ] troops stationed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Alliot-Marie  ] also demonstrated a sincere desire to maintain good [MISC U.S.-French  ] military-to-military relations , although she maintained a problematic relationship with former Defense Minister [PER Donald Rumsfeld  ] on such issues as [MISC European  ] security ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) and coordinated [MISC European  ] procurement ( [ORG EDA  ] ) . 
Minister of [ORG Immigration , Integration  ] , [ORG National  ] --------------------------------------------- - Identity and Co-Development ) [PER Brice Hortefeux  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Long-time [PER Sarkozy  ] ally [PER Brice Hortefeux  ] has been appointed to lead the newly created [ORG Ministry of Immigration , Integration  ] , [ORG National  ] Identity and Co-Development . 
During the 2007 presidential campaign [PER Sarkozy  ] said that immigration reform would be a top priority of his administration and that he wanted to create a single agency in order to consolidate the administration of immigration policy portfolio that was spread out among three different ministries . 
[PER Hortefeux  ] is one of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's oldest friends and political allies . 
He served as Junior Minister of [LOC Collective Territories  ] in the old [PER Villepin  ] government from 2005-07 . 
He was also a member of the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] from 1999 to 2005 . 
According to the press , [PER Hortefeux  ] and [PER Cecilia Sarkozy  ] , the president 's highly influential wife , often clashed during the run-up to the 2007 presidential election . 
[PER Hortefeux  ] has maintained close ties with the Embassy over the years , although in private he has been a harsh critic of President [PER George W. Bush  ] 's policy in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Minister of Justice ) [PER Rachida Dati  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] protege [PER Rachida Dati  ] has been tapped to serve as Minister of Justice ( " [MISC Garde  ] de [MISC Sceaux  ] " ) . 
A lawyer and former magistrate born to [MISC North African  ] immigrants , [PER Dati  ] joined [PER Sarkozy  ] at the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] in 2002 as an advisor on delinquency issues where she helped build up a network of contacts and supporters among the immigrant community . 
Impressed by her poise , intelligence and hard-driving work ethic , [PER Sarkozy  ] later choose [PER Dati  ] to serve as a co-spokesperson for his presidential campaign . 
Her political experience began in 1995 when she joined the staff of the [ORG Education Ministry  ] . 
From 1997-99 she worked in the justice ministry as an internal auditor , before being named a magistrate at a criminal court in a town called [LOC Peronne  ] . 
In 2001 she was named acting magistrate at the criminal court in [LOC Evry  ] , a suburb of [LOC Paris  ] , where she specialized in financial crime cases . 
[PER Dati  ] was born on November 27 , 1965 in [LOC Saint-Remy  ] , [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Dati  ] 's [MISC Moroccan  ] immigrant parents were poor ; hers is an up-from-poverty success story made possible by hard work and free public education .

Minister of [LOC Labor  ] , [ORG Social Relations  ] ------------------------------------ and [ORG Solidarity  ] ) [PER Xavier Bertrand  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] has named UMP rising star [PER Xavier Bertrand  ] to lead the newly created [ORG Ministry of Labor , Social Relations and Solidarity  ] . 
A formidable [LOC PARIS  ] 00002027 006.2 OF 007 debater , [PER Bertrand  ] served admirably as one of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's spokespersons during the 2007 presidential campaign . 
A relative newcomer on the national political scene , [PER Bertrand  ] served in the [MISC Raffarin  ] government as State Secretary for Social Security from April 2004 to June 2005 . 
During this period he was responsible for negotiating with union and employer representatives regarding the reform of [LOC France  ] 's nearly-bankrupt health insurance system . 
In recognition for his successful efforts , [PER Bertrand  ] was then promoted to Minister of Health and [ORG Solidarity  ] when [PER Dominique de Villepin  ] took over the reigns of government in 2005 . 
He resigned for the government on March 26 , 2007 in order to devote himself full-time to [PER Sarkozy  ] 's presidential campaign. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bertrand  ] is a hard-working detail-oriented administrator . 
As Health Minister , [PER Bertrand  ] worked closely with [LOC U.S.  ] officials to develop plans to cope with the emerging [ORG Bird Flu  ] threat . 
In 2006 he requested assistance from visiting [LOC U.S.  ] officials to help contain the [LOC Chikungunya  ] epidemic on [LOC Reunion Island  ] in the [LOC Indian Ocean  ] . 
[PER Bertrand  ] later praised [MISC American  ] contributions to the containment effort , saying [MISC American  ] assistance accelerated the development and distribution of an effective vaccine . 
Minister of Education ) [PER Xavier Darcos  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 .

[PER Darcos  ] served as Junior Minister for Cooperation , [ORG International Development  ] and [ORG Francophone Affairs  ] from 2004-05 , and as Junior Minister for Primary and Secondary Education from 2002-04 . 
A former senator from the [LOC Dordogne  ] region in southwestern [LOC France  ] ( 1997-2002 ) , [PER Darcos  ] was not particularly close to former President [PER Jacques Chirac  ] and hence was not kept on when the government of [PER Dominique de Villepin  ] was formed in June 2005 . 
He does not speak [MISC English  ] . 
Minister for [ORG Higher Education  ] ------------------------------ and Research ) [PER Valerie Pecresse  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG UMP  ] deputy [PER Valerie Pecresse  ] has been named Minister for [ORG Higher Education  ] and Research . 
Plucky and combative , [PER Pecresse  ] has served as spokesperson for the [ORG UMP  ] political party since 2004 and regularly appears on TV and radio political debate programs . 
She was elected to the [ORG National Assembly  ] representing [ORG Versailles-Chevreuse  ] ( [ORG Yvelines  ] ) in June 2002 , and was immediately appointed to the [ORG National Assembly  ] 's law commission . 
[PER Pecresse  ] played a prominent role in President [PER Chirac  ] 's 2002 reelection campaign , where she was in charge of dissecting the opposition 's positions and preparing rebuttals for candidate [PER Chirac  ] .
