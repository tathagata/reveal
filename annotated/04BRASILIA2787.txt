DANILOVICH  ] . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( SBU ) Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] met over dinner in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] on 5 November 2004 with [MISC Costa Rican  ] President [PER Abel Pacheco  ] and vice foreign minister [PER Vargas  ] , who were in the city for the [ORG Rio Group  ] meeting . 
[PER Pacheco  ] provided some candid and provocative observations on the following issues: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[ORG Rio Group Meeting:  ] -- ( C ) [PER Lula Gives Cuba  ] a [MISC Miss: To  ] general relief among the assembled chiefs of state , President [PER Lula da Silva  ] did not mention [LOC Cuba  ] in his formal remarks , [PER Pacheco  ] said . 
There had been fear among participants that [PER Lula  ] might repeat Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] 's recent calls in other regional fora to reach out to [LOC Cuba  ] , an appeal that has generally fallen flat among [LOC Brazil  ] 's neighbors . 
[PER Pacheco  ] said rumor in the meeting had it that the original speech draft provided to [PER Lula  ] by the foreign ministry had included a [LOC Cuba  ] section , which the presidency had , after consideration , decided to delete. -- ( C ) [PER Chavez: Pacheco  ] also noted that insulting jokes about [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] 's " buffoonery " were " rampant " throughout the course of the meeting . 
( But see para 3 below ) . 
( [PER Comment: Chavez  ] was vocal and utterly isolated in his criticism of the [ORG UN  ] mission in [LOC Haiti  ] ; the GOB effectively rallied the [ORG Rio Group  ] behind a robust statement of support for international efforts there . 
End comment . 
) -- ( C ) Apologies: [PER Pacheco  ] confided that he had quietly made the rounds of leaders at the meeting in [LOC Rio  ] , to privately apologize for the facts surrounding the recent resignation of OAS Secretary General Rodriques , who returned to [LOC Costa Rica  ] to face a corruption investigation . 
[PER Pacheco  ] noted that he had introduced language for three strong anti-corruption resolutions during the [ORG Rio  ] meeting , two of which were adopted. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Other Issues: -- ( C ) New OAS [PER SG: Pacheco  ] said that [LOC Costa Rica  ] will support [PER Paco Flores  ] for the new [ORG SG  ] . 
If that candidacy does not move ahead , [LOC Costa Rica  ] will consider backing the candidates from [LOC Trinidad  ] and [LOC Mexico.  ] -- ( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Venezuelan  ] clandestine activity: [PER Pacheco  ] told Ambassador that [LOC Costa Rica  ] 's intelligence service is surveilling the activities of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] cultural attache in [LOC San Jose  ] . 
The [ORG GOCR  ] believes the attache is an intelligence officer who is meeting secretly with labor union officials , and has brought 200,000 USD into [LOC Costa Rica  ] to pay labor activists to stage " provocations , " perhaps during the upcoming [MISC Ibero-American  ] summit in [LOC Costa Rica  ] . 
[PER Pacheco  ] requested USG intelligence assistance in the matter , and Ambassador undertook to pass the request on. -- ( C ) Corruption: [PER Pacheco  ] opined that it is shocking and embarrassing that [LOC Costa Rica  ] has two former presidents in jail for corruption , with a third on the way probably heading there soon . 
At the same time , [PER Pacheco  ] also found it constructive and salutary that [LOC Costa Rica  ] 's justice system is actively investigating and punishing corrupt officials , and that culprits are " serving real jail time , not in house arrest and their beach homes .
