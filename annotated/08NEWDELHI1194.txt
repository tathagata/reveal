The Ambassador underlined that senior leaders in the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] will likely criticize [LOC India  ] for giving a platform to the leader of a country engaged in killing [MISC American  ] soldiers in [LOC Iraq  ] , developing nuclear weapons with which to blackmail other countries , and sponsoring terrorism worldwide .

( C ) Foreign Secretary [PER Shivshankar Menon  ] related to the Ambassador May 1 that he wanted to provide a briefing of the April 29 “transit stop” in [LOC Delhi  ] by [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  ] . 
( [PER Note: Menon  ] had originally requested the meeting on the evening of April 30 , but rescheduled when the Prime Minister summoned [PER Menon  ] to his residence . 
End Note . 
) [PER Menon  ] outlined that , after landing at the airport at 16:30 , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] met the [MISC Indian  ] President for 45 minutes , followed by a meeting and dinner with the Prime Minister , in which [PER Menon  ] participated . 
During the meeting with the Prime Minister , [PER Menon  ] related , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] described a world that has improved from [LOC Iran’s  ] point of view , and would continue to shift in [LOC Iran’s  ] favor . 
[PER Menon  ] admitted that “I had not realized how ideological [PER Ahmadinejad  ] is.” He noted that while [PER Ahmadinejad  ] did not attack the [LOC U.S.  ] explicitly , he opined that the [LOC U.S.  ] has destabilized [LOC Iraq  ] and would withdraw soon . 
When asked about specifics , [PER Menon  ] continued , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] became “relatively mild.” Regarding [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] noted that there was no alternative to [PER Hamid Karzai  ] and called for strengthening the government in [LOC Kabul  ] , and regarding [LOC Iraq  ] , he called for greater law and order , but considered the [MISC Maliki  ] government good. “There was no fire and brimstone in the details , ” [PER Menon  ] observed. - - - [LOC India  ] Lays Down [ORG Criteria for Pipeline  ] - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] said that the discussion with the Prime Minister focused on the [LOC Iran-Pakistan-India  ] ( [LOC IPI  ] ) pipeline , and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] made clear that he aimed to produce an agreement in [LOC Delhi  ] . 
However , the Prime Minister laid down that [LOC India  ] required more detailed discussions to obtain three conditions that would allow [LOC India  ] to sign up to the [MISC IPI:  ] commercial and economic viability , assured supply , and security of the pipeline . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] gave his word that the pipeline would satisfy those conditions , and asked that [MISC Indian  ] leaders trust him . 
He then agreed to more detailed discussions , but to commence within a month. “We said no to artificial deadlines , ” [PER Menon  ] stressed to the Ambassador . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] later told the press that the countries have 45 days to work out an agreement , but [PER Menon  ] maintained , “I don’t know where he got that number from , but his goal in [LOC India  ] was to say that.” ( [PER Note: Menon  ] has not corrected [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] statement in public . 
End Note . 
) “We made clear that our issues are more than just the price of a transaction , ” he underlined , averred that it would take a long time to resolve the conditions set out by the [MISC Indian  ] government. - - - [LOC India  ] Pushes [LOC Iran  ] for Full Disclosure in [ORG IAEA  ] - - - NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 00001194 002 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Iran’s  ] nuclear program , [PER Menon  ] related that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] reiterated his public points that [LOC Iran  ] intended the program for peaceful use . 
[PER Menon  ] said that the Prime Minister acknowledged Iran’s right to a peaceful nuclear program , but urged [PER Ahmadinejad  ] to assure the international community of its peaceful intentions by coming clean with the [ORG IAEA  ] , which [LOC Iran  ] has not done . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] also made clear that the uranium enrichment program would continue , [PER Menon  ] added . 
India’s votes against [LOC Iran  ] in the [ORG IAEA  ] did not come up , he continued . 
[PER Menon  ] thanked the Ambassador for the April 27 briefing prior to [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] arrival , and enthusiastically remarked that he found it “very useful.” - - - [PER Ahmadinejad  ] Performed in [LOC Delhi  ] - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] puzzled about [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] “self-congratulatory , self-referential” style , which he found particularly odd during an exchange about oil prices , during which [PER Ahmadinejad  ] bragged that the cost of oil would remain high . 
[PER Ahmadinejad  ] also bad-mouthed other countries , including [LOC China  ] , which he claimed had put all its money in [LOC U.S.  ] dollars and now had nothing left . 
As a result , [PER Menon  ] judged , “we assume he speaks badly about us to other countries.” [PER Menon  ] also noted that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] refrained from direct attacks on [LOC Israel  ] , and did not bring up the [MISC Indian  ] launch of an [MISC Israeli  ] satellite nor the [MISC U.S.-India  ] relationship . 
Overall , [PER Menon  ] assessed , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] appeared to have performed in [LOC Delhi  ] for his domestic audience , showing [MISC Iranian  ] voters that he can still travel and interact with other countries. - - - Expect Senior-Level Criticism , Ambassador Warns - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador underlined that [MISC Americans  ] , particularly members of [ORG Congress  ] , will view [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] visit as [LOC India  ] providing a platform for an enemy of the [LOC U.S.  ] Members of [ORG Congress  ] and the Administration strongly believe that [PER Ahmadinejad  ] is guilty of killing [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] , developing a nuclear weapons program to blackmail the world , and sponsoring international terrorist activities , the Ambassador outlined . 
Moreover , the [LOC U.S.  ] has maintained a long-term alliance with [LOC Israel  ] , which [PER Ahmadinejad  ] has called for “wiping off the face of the earth , ” the Ambassador added . 
The average [MISC American  ] will wonder why the [LOC U.S.  ] has gone out of its way to have a nuclear cooperation initiative with [LOC India  ] , when [LOC India  ] is so friendly to [LOC Iran  ] , he warned. “I cannot predict what the effect of this visit will be , ” he cautioned , but noted that he expected the [PER Ahmadinejad  ] stop to exercise those members of [ORG Congress  ] who have gone out of their way on India’s behalf. - - - Nothing Should Upset You , [PER Menon  ] Presses - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] responded that “there is nothing in this visit that should upset you.” He emphasized that the [MISC Indian  ] government had little choice to say yes when the [MISC Iranian  ] government requested a stop in transit . 
Moreover , [PER Menon  ] explained , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Iran  ] need to talk about [LOC Afghanistan  ] and energy issues. “We can talk with him without affecting our other relationships , ” [PER Menon  ] contended , and cited the strong [MISC India-Israel  ] relationship that withstood India’s flirtation with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Menon  ] also cautioned the [LOC U.S.  ] against telling [LOC India  ] what to do , especially in public. “This government has to be seen following an independent foreign policy , not responding to dictation from the [LOC U.S.  ] , ” he stated . 
He recognized that [LOC Iran  ] presents a global problem , and the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC India  ] differ in how to fix the situation because of geography . 
For instance , [PER Menon  ] pressed , [LOC India  ] must work with [LOC Iran  ] to deal with [LOC Afghanistan.  ] - - - Ambassador Asks If [LOC India  ] Is Ready for Prime Time - - - NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 00001194 003 OF 003 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador recounted that the [LOC U.S.  ] government and [ORG Congress  ] stood up for [LOC India  ] by passing the [ORG Hyde Act  ] because they believed that as a rising power , [LOC India  ] must come into the global nonproliferation system . 
However , the Ambassador posited , those supporters will wonder if [LOC India  ] is ready for prime time since it “let the enemy in and did not stand up and say , ‘don’t do this.’” [PER Menon  ] countered that such a position sounded like what the [MISC Communists  ] have accused the [LOC U.S.  ] of doing . 
The Ambassador clarified that the [MISC Communists  ] suspect the [MISC Indian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] governments of trading foreign policies in a clandestine cabal , when in this case , the Ambassador simply wished to make the [MISC Indian  ] government aware of the possible repercussions that come from hosting the hostile Ahmadinejad. - - - Comment: [LOC India  ] and [LOC Iran  ] Relationship Needs No [LOC U.S.  ] Interference - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) By providing [PER Ahmadinejad  ] with a platform to berate the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [MISC Indian  ] government has attempted to prove that it has an independent foreign policy , as the [MISC Communist  ] critics have demanded since India’s first vote against [LOC Iran  ] in the [ORG IAEA  ] in 2005 . 
By kowtowing to political concerns , [LOC India  ] has put at risk its image of an emerging , responsible major player in the world . 
We have warned the [MISC Indian  ] government quietly about the implications , but sharp , public comments from the [LOC U.S.  ] government will only push [LOC India  ] and [LOC Iran  ] closer together .
