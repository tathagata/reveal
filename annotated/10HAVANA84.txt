( C ) SUMMARY: There is little prospect of economic reform in 2010 despite an economic crisis that is expected to get even worse for [LOC Cuba  ] in the next few years , according to key commercial specialists , economic officers and [ORG Cuba-watchers  ] in [LOC Havana  ] . 
Promised structural reforms remain on hold while the [MISC Cuban  ] government wrings its hands in indecision , fearful of the political consequences of these long-overdue changes . 
The one potentially significant reform implemented in 2009 , the leasing of idle land , has not been effective . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] government ( [ORG GOC  ] ) could be forced to speed up reforms in the event of a significant reduction of assistance from an increasingly unstable [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
Otherwise , the [ORG GOC  ] will continue to prioritize military-led control and aim for a slow , measured pace of reform focused on agriculture and import substitution . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] people have grown accustomed to tough times and will respond to future government belt tightening with similar endurance . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Pol/Econ Counselor hosted a breakfast with commercial and economic counselors from six of Cuba’s seven largest trading partners , including [LOC China  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , ( the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Italy  ] , plus key creditors [LOC France  ] and [LOC Japan  ] . 
These countries also represent most of the foreign companies investing in [LOC Cuba  ] , with the notable exception of [MISC Venezuelan  ] state-owned enterprises . 
DIPLOMATS ARE MOSTLY PESSIMISTIC -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The global financial crisis and the inability to service foreign debt will make the dire situation in [LOC Cuba  ] even worse in 2010 , according to [ORG EU  ] diplomats . 
[LOC Brazil  ] was a bit more optimistic noting that [LOC Cuba  ] can still withstand more economic hardship . 
All diplomats agreed that [LOC Cuba  ] could survive this year without substantial policy changes , but the financial situation could become fatal within 2-3 years . 
[LOC Italy  ] said [ORG GOC  ] contacts had suggested [LOC Cuba  ] would become insolvent as early as 2011 . 
TRADE AND INVESTMENT: NO ROOM FOR IMPORT REDUCTIONS --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOC  ] has responded to the crisis with calls to further reduce imports and increase domestic production . 
However , [LOC Spain  ] argued there is little more room for [LOC Cuba  ] to reduce its imports after a 37% reduction in 2009 as the increasing majority are now basic necessities like food and animal feed . 
( Note: press reports February 9 that [LOC Cuba  ] has cut rice imports from [LOC Vietnam  ] , its largest supplier , by 11 percent for 2010 . 
End Note . 
) Exports and other sources of foreign currency ( tourism and remittances ) are unlikely to increase substantially without a dramatic global turnaround , access to [LOC U.S.  ] markets or an opening to [LOC U.S.  ] tourists . 
Two-way trade with [LOC China  ] alone in 2009 fell by close to $1 billion . 
Regarding increasing production , the only significant reform in the last five years , the leasing of idle land to improve agricultural production , has little chance of succeeding as implemented . 
The diplomats noted that many of the [MISC Cubans  ] that were granted land have no farming experience , and the few farmers with experience have limited access to capital , tools and markets . 
STILL DEFAULTING ON TRADE PARTNERS ---------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Payment problems continue for all countries . 
Despite once again restructuring all of its official debt in 2009 , [LOC Japan  ] has yet to see any payments . 
Even [LOC China  ] admitted to having problems getting paid on time and complained about [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000084 002.2 OF 004 [MISC Cuban  ] requests to extend credit terms from one to four years . 
When [LOC France  ] and [LOC Canada  ] responded with “welcome to the club” , [LOC China  ] suggested [LOC Canada  ] help secure payment from a [MISC Cuban  ] joint venture that includes [MISC Canadian  ] firm [ORG Sherritt International  ] which is now reportedly receiving its share of profits . 
AN UNWELCOMING ENVIRONMENT FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Foreign investors have been treated poorly in [LOC Cuba  ] and new investors will demand additional protections and guarantees , according to the [MISC French  ] . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] complained that the [MISC GOC’s  ] insistence on keeping majority control of all joint ventures makes no sense. “No matter whether a foreign business invests $10 million or $100 million , the [MISC GOC’s  ] investment will always add up to 51% , ” China’s commercial counselor said in visible exasperation . 
He noted a joint venture to produce high-yield rice that produced a good first harvest but was not sustainable at the [MISC GOC-mandated  ] prices . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] investors are taking a longer term view on returns , however , noting some success in raising capital for the refurbishment of the port at [LOC Mariel  ] . 
MAJOR REFORMS ON HOLD --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Despite the grave analysis , none of our contacts foresee meaningful economic reform in 2010 . 
Immediate reform is neither necessary nor politically advisable since it has the potential of being too politically “destabilizing , ” said the [MISC Brazilian  ] . 
Even reforms openly supported in the official press late last year ( Ref A ) , such as the ending of the food ration system , are now on hold due to the initial negative public reaction . 
Any discussions around Chinese-style reforms , particularly regarding foreign investment , have been difficult and “a real headache” according to the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] will not act until its face is up against the wall and it runs out of options , which is not yet the case in spite of all the challenges . 
One cited example of the [MISC GOC’s  ] hesitancy is that all proposals for micro-credit programs coveted by the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Investment  ] require the [ORG Council of State’s  ] approval . 
To date , only one small project by the [MISC Spanish  ] has been approved with little success . 
AS [LOC VENEZUELA  ] GOES ----------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] see future reforms determined by two factors: 1 ) foreign pressure that is outside of the regime’s control ; and 2 ) domestic pressure developed after a consensus is reached through internal discussions . 
All our colleagues agreed that [LOC Venezuela  ] is the most important and “increasingly complicated” foreign variable . 
Without [MISC Venezuelan  ] support , the [ORG GOC  ] would have to enact significant reforms similar to those that enabled the regime to survive through the Special Period of the early 1990s ( Ref B ) , according to the [MISC Spanish  ] . 
The view from the [MISC French  ] is that [LOC Venezuela  ] “es en flames” and a source of serious concern for [LOC Cuba  ] . 
THE DOMESTIC DEBATE CONTINUES ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) If reform is driven by domestic factors it will be slow and hesitant . 
Unlike former president [PER Fidel Castro  ] , [PER Raul Castro  ] needs the “support of the machine” to make chnges , according to the [ORG Canadians.naul Castro’s National Assembly  ] speech in December ( Ref C ) made it clear that the [ORG GOC  ] is in no hurry to reform , argued the [MISC Italians  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] noted that the consensus-building process likely explains the numerous official press stories and letters to the editor in support of some sort of economic reforms , without the accompanying government measures . 
Even though this limited but noteworthy public debate is almost always framed in socialist and revolutionary rhetoric , many of the articles are highly critical of current policies and propose market-oriented reforms . 
The simple fact that space still [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000084 003.2 OF 004 exists ( and appears to be growing ) within [LOC Cuba  ] for this form of public dissent indicates that the [ORG GOC  ] has not completely given up on bigger reforms . 
SLOW , MEASURED AND MILITARY-STYLE REFORMS ----------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In lieu of structural reforms , the [ORG GOC  ] will continue to take small steps to increase domestic production and reduce imports , focusing on lifting agricultural production from its current lamentable state . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has started on a slow and steady path , according to the [ORG Canadians.  ] “Unless ( or until ) the situation becomes unstable , the government is not going to walk any faster.” An example of step-by-step reform is the pilot suburban agriculture project taking place in the third largest city in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
A [ORG Reuters  ] reporter told us that he witnessed the [ORG GOC  ] clearing land and providing resources to private , collective and state farmers working around the city of [LOC Camaguey  ] . 
As an incentive , the [ORG GOC  ] will permit farmers to sell a bit more of the production directly to consumers . 
The goal is to encourage idle workers to return to farms close to the city and produce enough food to feed the surrounding areas . 
The focus on local production will also cut down on costs associated with state-run ( and thoroughly corrupt and inefficient ) transportation and storage . 
If successful , the [ORG GOC  ] will replicate this project in other cities. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Even limited reforms could open up private sector opportunities ( e.g. permitting cooperatives to operate barber shops , restaurants or retail stores ) , but in general the military will continue to expand its influence in core economic activities . 
According to the [MISC French  ] , the [MISC Cuban  ] leadership believes it can transfer the successes of military state companies that control a good part of the tourism industry to the rest of the economy . 
Many of our contacts agreed that the military is generally better regarded in [LOC Cuba  ] than the political institutions , and reportedly intervened directly in the operation of flour mills earlier this year after bread had disappeared from markets . 
The [MISC Italians  ] noted that the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] is in the hands of the general most faithful to [PER Raul Castro  ] in [PER Ulises Rosales  ] del [PER Toro  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] argued that the military is seizing all core economic activities of the state . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] economy is increasingly run by military engineers that are capable of running the day-to-day business activities , but do not have the vision to enact reforms or lead the country out of the economic mess of centralized state planning. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As a result , several of our colleagues commented that leadership of the [MISC Cuban  ] economy is more centralized this year . 
A side effect of such control is that the economic ministries are restricting access . 
The [MISC French  ] complained that the running of the [MISC GOC’s  ] finances has shifted from the [ORG Central Bank  ] to the [ORG Ministry of Economy and Planning and  ] , with that shift , the [MISC French  ] no longer have any access to officials or information . 
A [ORG Reuters  ] reporter said that unlike in past years he was not granted any officials meetings on a recent trip to eastern [LOC Cuba  ] despite several requests . 
All agreed that decision-making circles are small and increasingly isolated . 
RELATIONS WITH THE [LOC UNITED STATES  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Many officials in the [ORG GOC  ] have reconciled themselves to the inevitability of better relations with the [LOC United States  ] , said the [MISC Brazilians  ] . 
The [MISC Cubans  ] involved in the [MISC Mariel Port  ] project have said that the project is in preparation for the day when [LOC U.S.  ] - [LOC Cuba  ] economic relations normalize . 
While the [MISC French  ] see the window for improving relations as closed after the [ORG GOC  ] could not bring itself to take the necessary steps , the [MISC Brazilians  ] argued that mixed signals from the [MISC Cuban  ] regime are a reflection of dissent in the power circles about whether to move ahead . 
Some in the [ORG GOC  ] objected to the [LOC U.S.  ] role in [LOC Honduras  ] and [LOC Haiti  ] and decided that better relations were not worth the risk . 
[ORG HAVANA  ] 00000084 004.2 OF 004 ( Comment: the “U.S. role” according to the official [MISC Cuban  ] press was to support the coup in [LOC Honduras  ] and a military occupation in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
End Comment . 
) THE [MISC CUBAN  ] PEOPLE WILL SURVIVE ----------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) In the short term , the [ORG GOC  ] will require even more belt tightening from the [MISC Cuban  ] people . 
The [MISC Italians  ] and [MISC French  ] explained that [LOC Cuba  ] cut imports before increasing production , which simply means there are fewer products available for [MISC Cubans  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] has been clear in its public statements that 2010 will be just as difficult as 2009 and further savings ( i.e. cuts ) will be necessary . 
Everyone agreed that the [MISC Cuban  ] people could withstand more hardship , although the [MISC Italians  ] questioned whether further economic tightening would end up weakening and delegitimizing the [ORG GOC  ] further . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Despite how badly [LOC Cuba  ] needs them , significant economic reforms are unlikely in 2010 , especially with the continued delay of a policy-revising [ORG Communist Party Congress  ] ( Ref C ) . 
The [MISC GOC’s  ] direction and leadership remains muddled and unclear , in great measure because its leaders are paralyzed by fear that reforms will loosen the tight grip on power that they have held for over 50 years . 
Faced with political uncertainty regarding future [MISC Cuban  ] leadership and relations with the [LOC United States  ] , the [MISC Cuban  ] people are more likely to endure a slow erosion of state-subsidies than a much-needed radical restructuring. .FARRAR</pre></code>
