COUNTRY CONDITIONS: Fraud Level: Low . 
[LOC Tripoli  ] provides the full range of [ORG American Citizen Services  ] and has been issuing the full range of non-immigrant visas since March 25 , 2009 . 
Because of [LOC Libya  ] 's longtime isolation , there are few " pull " factors from the [LOC United States  ] , as the [MISC Libyan  ] diaspora in the [LOC United States  ] is very small . 
As [LOC Libya  ] is a relatively wealthy country , " push " instigators for [MISC Libyan  ] citizens are also fairly minimal . 
Official [MISC Libyan  ] documents are generally unsophisticated and usually handwritten , featuring few , if any , security features . 
We also have heard reports that genuine documents with false information are obtainable from the authorities , possibly for a fee , but also through family connections . 
In addition , the [MISC Libyan  ] government is extremely reluctant to share or confirm information about its citizens with us , which limits our ability to conduct fraud investigations . 
Further to this , the [ORG GOL  ] requires that all law-enforcement related inquiries proceed through only one designated host government security service point of contact . 
While RSO at post is extremely supportive , our inability to develop consular law enforcement contacts limits ability to conduct anti-fraud work . 
[MISC Libyan  ] applicants in general are unfamiliar with [LOC U.S.  ] laws and processes and have proven susceptible to a number of fraudulent schemes in an effort to obtain visas or [MISC American  ] citizen services. b . 
[ORG NIV FRAUD: Post  ] only began processing visas other than A and G in the past 6 months , and to date we have seen only a few cases of conventional fraud involving presentation of false documents . 
In one such case , an H1B applicant presented documents that were clearly fake and stated that he paid a large sum for them on-line . 
He believed this to be the process to obtain a work visa in the [LOC United States  ] . 
DHS has reported two [MISC Libyan  ] applicants turned back at point of entry and admitting to lying during their interviews . 
In one case , the applicant mentioned that a known visa-fixing agency in [LOC Tripoli  ] had coached him on successful interview techniques and recommended borrowing money to enhance his bank account statement . 
In addition , we have seen cases where we suspect applicants of using their personal connections to obtain a genuine diplomatic note to get a visa for personal travel , and avoid fees and interviews . 
We have confirmed with the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) in all of these cases that the diplomatic notes are genuine , and have usually issued the visas in accordance with the request . 
We continue to follow up in these cases to ensure that the applicants in question return to [LOC Libya  ] , but have seen no new instances of overstays . 
We will continue to monitor such cases closely . 
Post has heard reports from other Embassies that [MISC Libyan  ] visa applicants sometimes procure false employment letters from friends who work at prominent international companies . 
Post has implemented a [ORG Business Visa Program  ] which allows member companies to register with us , and provide sample signatures of all employees authorized to sign job letters for visa applicants . 
All of our employment-based cases so far have involved petitions from international oil companies ; we have detected no evidence of any fraud thus far. c . 
[ORG IV FRAUD: Over  ] the past year , [LOC Tripoli  ] began to accept petitions for immigrant visas from resident [MISC American  ] citizens , but [LOC Tunis  ] continues to interview these cases . 
We have not yet seen any instances of fraud or questionable relationships . 
We do note that [MISC Libyan  ] applicants often present the " Family Book " rather than separate birth and marriage certificates . 
While this is a valid civil document , we require a birth and marriage certificate , both of which are available . 
All three documents are handwritten , and contain no security features . 
We have no exposure to employment-based [ORG IV  ] cases. d . 
[ORG DV FRAUD: Tripoli  ] does not process [ORG DV  ] applications , and has received no inquiries regarding potential [ORG DV  ] fraud from other Posts . 
We have received inquiries from [ORG DV  ] applicants and other [MISC Libyans  ] who have either seen advertisements or received e-mail from " service providers " offering assistance completing the [ORG DV  ] forms , and have placed a general warning about the use of service providers for any visa services on our website. e . 
ACS AND [LOC U.S.  ] PASSPORT FRAUD: Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] resumed full passport and ACS services in [LOC FY-2007  ] . 
Most claims are from first-time adult passport applicants , and are based upon birth in the [LOC United States  ] while a parent was attending university . 
These cases require more time to review than most , in large part due to reliance upon [MISC Libyan  ] documents to establish the identity of applicants . 
However , the vast majority of applicants are able to produce both parents' passports from the time of their birth , with visas and entry stamps confirming [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000773 002.2 OF 003 presence in the [LOC United States  ] , as well as surprisingly vast amounts of supporting documentation . 
We routinely ask for two forms of identity documents from adult passport applicants because of increasing concerns about the potential vulnerability of the [MISC Libyan  ] passport as an identity document . 
[LOC Libya  ] issues a national identity card to its citizens at age 16 , and most [MISC Libyans  ] also hold a drivers' license . 
Both of these documents include a photo , but are only in [MISC Arabic.  ] f . 
[ORG ADOPTION FRAUD: Local  ] law does not allow for the adoption of a [MISC Libyan  ] child by foreign nationals . 
Only a resident [LOC U.S.  ] citizen who is married to a [MISC Libyan  ] national or is a dual-national can adopt in this country . 
To date , Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] has received only one general inquiry regarding adoption in [LOC Libya  ] , and has not seen a case . 
A pending case involves an [MISC American  ] family in [LOC France  ] seeking to adopt an illegal TCN immigrant child in [LOC Libya  ] ; the outcome remains uncertain. g . 
USE OF [MISC DNA TESTING: Post  ] has not had any cases referred for [MISC DNA  ] testing to date. h . 
ASYLUM AND OTHER DHS BENEFITS FRAUD: Post receives infrequent reports of a lost/stolen I-551 . 
We have begun to process these cases in close coordination with DHS colleagues in [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Rome  ] . 
We have not detected any efforts at fraud or misrepresentation in this area . 
We have not processed any VISAS 92/93 cases. i.ALIEN SMUGGLING , TRAFFICKING , ORGANIZED CRIME , TERRORIST TRAVEL: While [LOC Libya  ] is a transit and destination country both for economic migrants and victims of trafficking , especially from sub-Saharan [LOC Africa  ] to [LOC Europe  ] , it is not a center for the production of false documents . 
Traffickers and smugglers operating in [LOC Libya  ] tend to focus on providing boat travel to [LOC Europe  ] for migrants , who often seek asylum on arrival . 
[LOC Libya  ] does have vast borders in the [LOC Sahara  ] which are extremely difficult to police . 
Estimates indicate that 1.5-2 million irregular ( illegal ) migrants are present in-country but live outside mainstream [MISC Libyan  ] society . 
Post knows that [MISC European  ] Embassies routinely require a [LOC U.S.  ] visa in order to issue a [MISC Schengen  ] transit visa for travel to the [LOC United States  ] , but has received no inquiries or reports regarding possible imposters or other misuse of [LOC U.S.  ] travel documents in order to reach another [MISC Western  ] country . 
In the 6 months we have been processing NIVs , we have not noted any TCN applicants who appear to be involved in smuggling or trafficking . 
Most TCN applicants are executive-level employees of international oil or construction companies. j . 
DS CRIMINAL FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS: Post 's [ORG RSO  ] served as [ORG ARSO/I  ] and [ORG FPM  ] in his last assignment while the [ORG ARSO  ] 's previous assignment was as an [MISC RSO-I  ] . 
Post has an SOP for referring fraud cases to [ORG RSO  ] . 
However , to date , we have not had any cases to refer to DS with the exception of the [MISC H1B  ] fraudster. k . 
HOST COUNTRY PASSPORT , IDENTITY DOCUMENTS , AND CIVIL REGISTRY: [MISC Libyan  ] passports and civil documents are uniformly handwritten , frequently contain errors , and have few if any security features . 
None have biometrics or machine-readable features . 
While both marriage and birth certificates are available , the document in everyday use to demonstrate relationships is the [MISC Libyan  ] " Family Book . 
" The book has a blue or green cover , and is issued to men when they get married . 
A man 's family book contains only his photo , and data about his wife and children . 
Unmarried people are in their father 's family book , except in the case of widows , who are the only women who can have their own book . 
[LOC Libya  ] issues both national identity cards and drivers licenses , handwritten in [MISC Arabic  ] only , with a photo . 
We use these as secondary evidence of identity . 
Despite how easy it would be to counterfeit [MISC Libyan  ] documents , we have not seen or heard of cases where identity is falsified . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] passport is the only official government document that has an [MISC English  ] translation , handwritten on one of the last pages . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has indicated that in the future , it plans to assign a single national ID number which will identify a person from the registration of their birth through their entire life . 
Under this plan , passport numbers would remain the same for a person 's entire life . 
It is not clear how the [ORG GOL  ] would register lost or expired passports under the scheme , or if old passports would remain valid . 
The [ORG GOL  ] is in the process of modernizing its passport ; it has provided us with a series of prospective dates for the rollout of a more modern document , some as early as last year . 
The new passport and identity documents are currently slated for release in the next few months . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has not shared an exemplar of the new passport . 
[ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000773 003.2 OF 003 The [MISC Maltese  ] Embassy , one of the busiest visa-issuing countries in [LOC Libya  ] , has identified several genuine [MISC Libyan  ] passports issued with erroneous data . 
[MISC Libyan  ] passports include a note if the passport is a replacement for an older passport . 
This notation , according to the [MISC Maltese  ] , can be " forgotten " if the prior passport would reveal inconvenient truths about the applicant 's travel history . 
This calls into question the integrity of the [MISC Libyan  ] passport as an identity document . 
Post is not aware of any trend in alteration of [MISC Libyan  ] passports . 
The passport agency and civil registry has reportedly begun a process of " correcting " the last names of [MISC Libyan  ] citizens , many of whom , as is common in the [MISC Arab  ] world , use an ancestor 's first name as their last name . 
One visa applicant told us that this practice was no longer acceptable , and that the [ORG GOL  ] was now requiring the use of " family " or clan last names instead . 
There are routinely four names in the [MISC Libyan  ] passport--the applicant 's first name , the father 's and grandfather 's first names , and then the family name . 
The handwritten [MISC English  ] translation of the passport rarely contains a full translation of these four names - more frequently , one or both of the middle names is written as an initial only . 
When changes are made , no mention of any previous passports issued in another identity is necessarily mentioned . 
We routinely use the " alias " fields in the consular applications to counteract the potential for use of alternate identities by mala fide applicants . 
Both [LOC Tunis  ] and [LOC Tripoli  ] use only the passport number on [LOC Libya  ] passports . 
In September 2008 , [LOC Tunis  ] detected numerous duplicates in their database . 
Contact with the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Passport Agency  ] indicates that in addition to the six-digit passport number , three " series " letters are used . 
The [MISC Arabic  ] letters " wow , " " ha " , and " ya , " as well as " no letter " serve to differentiate the passport series . 
These letters do not appear on the passport data page . 
Post continues to attempt to find a way to capture these letters in the consular applications without causing problems for visa holders at [LOC POE  ] , where inspectors would notice a mismatch between the visa and the passport data page. l . 
COOPERATION WITH HOST GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES: While our relationship with [LOC Libya  ] is improving , it remains complicated . 
Many routine requests must be submitted by diplomatic note , and even then , are often ignored . 
The Consular section is not permitted by the [ORG GOL  ] to have any contact with host-country law enforcement , as all such contact is required to be between [ORG RSO  ] and a designated [ORG GOL  ] liaison . 
Even with close cooperation with [ORG RSO  ] , working through this channel often requires repeated requests for the same information . 
In addition , the [ORG GOL  ] has repeatedly expressed concern about sharing its citizens' personal data with foreign governments , which will further complicate efforts to investigate identity fraud. m . 
AREAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN: We are working with other Embassy sections , and with other Embassies in [LOC Tripoli  ] to develop our understanding of how applicants here will attempt to overcome 214 ( b ) . 
Early indicators are that few unqualified applicants are presenting themselves for interviews. n . 
STAFFING AND TRAINING: The deputy section chief serves as [ORG FPM  ] . 
He has not had any specific [ORG Fraud Prevention  ] training in the past five years . 
There is no dedicated [ORG LES  ] fraud prevention position . 
All local staff is sensitized to fraud issues and understand the importance of both internal controls and our external image in relation to fraud prevention . 
When translation is needed in visa or passport cases , we use our native Arabic-speaker Consular Associate to avoid the appearance that a [MISC Libyan  ] employee has influence into the visa or passport process . 
All new staff are required to take FPP on-line training courses as part of their orientation .
