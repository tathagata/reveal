( S ) SUMMARY: Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and [MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] met on February 5 for 30 minutes in their first bilateral meeting . 
The warm and open exchange followed a one-on-one working lunch and preceded a 20-minute press conference . 
The two agreed to coordinate closely on a wide range of issues including the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , the [LOC Balkans  ] , [LOC GTMO  ] detainees and [LOC Africa  ] , especially [LOC Darfur  ] . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] emphasized the need for greater " Afghanization " and international " access " to everyday [MISC Afghan  ] people , and asked for [LOC U.S.  ] support to hold a second " Neighbors " conference to follow up on the initial December 14 , 2008 event . 
On [LOC GTMO  ] , the [MISC FM  ] indicated [LOC Europe  ] would help on a case-by-case basis , and asked the [LOC U.S.  ] for assistance with a 15-year old [MISC Canadian  ] national , [PER Omar Khadr  ] . 
The [MISC FM  ] asked for a reaction to its [ORG Transatlantic  ] paper , passed to the [LOC U.S.  ] during [LOC France  ] 's 2008 EU presidency . 
As the meeting closed , the Secretary joked that the [MISC FM  ] was " not even in her league " concerning criticism when the [MISC FM  ] mentioned a new book critical of him that might spark press questions . 
END SUMMARY. ----------- [LOC Middle East  ] ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Secretary opened the meeting by welcoming [ORG FM Kouchner  ] and expressing appreciation for [MISC French  ] leadership on a broad agenda of cooperation , which she said President [PER Obama  ] hoped to deepen . 
[PER Kouchner  ] congratulated the Secretary and said he looked forward to the pleasure of working together on a first name basis . 
The two then summarized topics discussed in their one-on-one meeting , beginning with the [ORG Middle East.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) The Secretary said she understood that the issue of the [LOC Middle East  ] was of grave concern to [LOC France  ] . 
She expressed appreciation for [MISC French  ] leadership on interdicting weapons into [LOC Gaza  ] and with the [LOC Copenhagen  ] process . 
She thanked President [PER Sarkozy  ] for his ideas and for [MISC French  ] work in providing assistance to the people of [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[ORG FM Kouchner  ] said that he had met with [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) PM [PER Abu Mazen  ] three days prior and found him completely isolated . 
There was a game being played among [MISC Arabs  ] , most of whom , [MISC Egyptians  ] excepted , did not care . 
He said " [PER Abbas  ] is lost . 
You tried , we tried but nothing has happened . 
The key , he said , was to figure out how to build up [PER Abu Mazen  ] in a government of national unity . 
[PER Salam Fayyad  ] was a fantastic PM who had ideas about how to open the [LOC Gaza  ] crossing , specifically a tax paid by a group of people who would be acceptable to both sides just to get the crossing operating . 
" It was especially important , he continued , to offer the [MISC Palestinian  ] people a sign that the crossing was open because of [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's involvement . 
He had to be seen as a leader . 
He said it would take weeks and noted that [ORG Hamas  ] does not want to talk to [PER Mazen  ] . 
Still , it was important to help convince the [MISC Israelis  ] to open the crossing . 
[PER Kouchner  ] cautioned that it would be difficult to get anything done ahead of the [MISC Israeli  ] election on February 10. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The Secretary concurred that the situation was difficult . 
She added that confidence building measures were needed so that the [MISC Israelis  ] would feel committed . 
It was important to persuade the new [MISC Israeli  ] government to participate in the peace effort and be convinced that they could work with the [ORG PA  ] . 
If [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's government of national unity is to work , [LOC Israel  ] needs to understand that it should work with him and that this development could help . 
She was encouraged by the actions that the [MISC Egyptians  ] had taken against the tunnels . 
She said there was much to coordinate and supported the role of the Quartet , but agreed that little could happen in advance of the [MISC Israeli  ] elections . 
She noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] was conducting a review based on [PER Mitchell  ] 's work. ----------- [LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The Secretary said that the [LOC U.S.  ] was working on a comprehensive strategy and thanked the [ORG FM  ] for [LOC France  ] 's contributions and cooperation . 
[PER Kouchner  ] noted that [LOC France  ] had increased its troops to 3000 from 3300 . 
He said there was progress in several areas , including civil society , but presented a mixed picture overall . 
He returned several times to problems with access to the population and suggested that this was the key . 
He also promoted Afghanization , saying it was important " for the people to take their own problems into their own hands . 
" He expressed pride in the [MISC French  ] hospital in [LOC Kabul  ] as an example of what was possible noting that [MISC Afghan  ] patients were being treated by [MISC Afghan  ] doctors , and even the [MISC Taliban  ] presented themselves for treatment . 
He said that [LOC Kabul  ] is not [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but that [LOC Kabul  ] works because it has been " Afghanized . 
" The rest of the country needs the same , but it will take years . 
He was also concerned about growing [MISC Iranian  ] influence , noting that a huge [LOC Shi'a  ] mosque had recently been built with [MISC Iranian  ] funds. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) FM [PER Kouchner  ] asked for the Secretary 's support for a follow-up event to the December 14 , 2008 " [LOC Afghanistan  ] Neighbors conference " that [PER Kouchner  ] hosted in [LOC Paris  ] . 
The [ORG FM  ] said the meeting had been very interesting , despite the [MISC Iranians  ] not showing at the last minute , and should be repeated if the [LOC U.S.  ] agreed . 
[PER Kouchner  ] put the conference in the context of a broader approach , stressing " there is no military solution in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Secretary took note of the proposal , but made no commitment on a follow-up conference . 
She said the [LOC U.S.  ] believed that there had been some success with building the [ORG Army  ] , but more problems with the police . 
Both commented on the strength of the new Minister of [LOC Interior  ] . 
The Secretary said that the Minister of the [LOC Interior  ] was an interesting person but that it might be necessary to deal with some of the more radical people whether we wanted to or not . 
On reconciliation , [PER Kouchner  ] said that there were some very bad people involved , but they were nationals of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and it was important to start negotiations , including the negotiations in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
Finally on the presidency , [PER Kouchner  ] said " [PER Karzai  ] is somebody . 
We have to talk to him , but there may be other candidates . 
" He said [PER Anwar-ul-Haq Ahadi  ] was such a person but , while interesting , he probably couldn't win against [PER Karzai  ] . 
The Secretary noted that [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] would travel to the region. ----------- GUANTANAMO ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Secretary expressed appreciation for [MISC French  ] leadership within the [ORG EU  ] on this issue . 
She said she was proud of President [PER Obama  ] 's commitment to close the facility , calling it " a cancer " the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to take care of , but would take time . 
She said this was complicated , so we were asking friends and allies to consider taking some detainees . 
[ORG FM Kouchner  ] said the [ORG EU  ] 27 had not yet reached consensus , but that they " accepted the idea , " but would consider detainees on a case-by-case basis ; [MISC Europeans  ] do not want to create legal problems for themselves . 
They were working with three categories of individuals . 
First were " the best cases . 
" Second , were those who had made individual requests for resettlement in specific countries and third without legal problems . 
There were many outstanding questions , such as whether they had refugee status , but because of the [LOC Schengen  ] visa requirements , it was necessary for the [ORG EU  ] to address this together . 
At the end of this discussion , the [ORG FM  ] handed the Secretary a paper concerning [PER Omar Khadr  ] , a 15-year old [MISC Muslim  ] of [MISC Canadian  ] origin . 
The Secretary agreed to review the case. ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The Secretary opened the discussion by alluding to the private conversation with [ORG FM Kouchner  ] and their agreement that it was important to prevent further development of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear capabilities and its missile program . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's recent space launch complicated this effort noting that the [MISC Iranians  ] had respected none of the internationally recognized requirements for a space launches specified in [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions . 
The [ORG FM  ] said he welcomed the [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to consider direct talks between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that the [MISC Iranians  ] were waiting for the [LOC U.S.  ] The launch had surprised the [MISC Russians  ] , of whom he said " they are more affected than we being 2000 kilometers closer . 
" He added that the sanctions seemed to be having some effect on the domestic population , but he ended by repeating the need for a Quartet meeting . 
He said that it was important for any approach to be done together with the [MISC Germans  ] and the [MISC Russians  ] , particularly since the [MISC Russians  ] are closer to [LOC Iran  ] and could be more easily targeted . 
[PER Kouchner  ] suggested not including the [MISC Chinese  ] because the [MISC Chinese  ] are " absolutely not useful " in this process . 
The Secretary said it was important to follow up , possibly with [LOC U.K.  ] Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] on the margins of the [LOC G-20 Summit  ] in [LOC London.  ] --------------------- Russia/Georgia/Energy --------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG FM Kouchner  ] told the Secretary that [LOC France  ] had been surprised by the [MISC Georgian  ] invasion . 
" We did stop it , but we didn't solve it . 
" He continued that the [MISC South Ossetians  ] and [MISC Abkhaz  ] are a " sort of independent people " but he worried that there is no humanitarian access to the population . 
He said that [MISC Georgian  ] PM [PER Saakashvili  ] had been " badly inspired ; he fell into the trap . 
" But the [ORG FM  ] said the [LOC Geneva  ] process should continue , though it might take months or years . 
On energy , he said the [ORG EU  ] had been united , but then [LOC Poland  ] , [LOC Romania  ] and others had been completely cut off and that both [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] had been " absolutely awful . 
" He said " a group of [MISC Europeans  ] were trying to secure a pipeline from one country to the other . 
" But he cautioned that the [LOC U.S.  ] position on [LOC Missile Defense  ] was also a factor . 
He complimented [PER Medvedev  ] as " a normal guy , at least better than [PER Putin  ] , " and credited him with what he believed to be the sound decision not to put [PER Iskander  ] missiles in [LOC Kalinigrad  ] . 
He said things were now more complicated with the [MISC Iranian  ] space launch . 
On the whole , things were frozen , which was " not bad " as a place to be for the moment. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Continuing on [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Kouchner  ] said that the main thing for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] to begin to work together . 
" Let 's talk to them , " he said . 
He said that the [MISC Russians  ] are " rough , rude , and brutal , " but we should still engage them . 
[PER Kouchner  ] said [MISC Russian  ] FM Lavrov was one of the most brutal , but was among the cleverest FMs . 
In any case , they were an important player and had to be included. ------- [LOC Balkans  ] ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) FM [PER Kouchner  ] said that [LOC Bosnia  ] remained a problem , but , it was important to simply " follow the road . 
" It was important to push the [MISC Serbian  ] government closer to the [ORG EU  ] , though he conceded this was difficult due to [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Belgian  ] objections to the failure of the [MISC Serbs  ] to hand over [PER Ratko Mladic  ] to [ORG ICTY  ] . 
Presumably referring to [LOC EULEX  ] , he said there was success on the ground in [LOC Kosovo  ] as the two sides were not killing each other and concluded that things were not in a bad place for the moment. ------ [LOC Darfur  ] ------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) FM [PER Kouchner  ] told the Secretary he thought the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) would soon issue an arrest warrant against [MISC Sudanese  ] President [PER Omar  ] al- Bashir . 
He complimented the [MISC Qataris  ] for playing a useful role with their work in [LOC Doha  ] . 
He said they were working with both sides , including the [MISC Islamists  ] . 
He said it had taken two years to build toward success . 
[ORG EUFOR  ] , a contingent of 17 nations deployed in [MISC Eastern  ] [LOC Chad  ] and northern [LOC Central African Republic  ] , was a success and he expected a resolution before March 15 when [ORG EUFOR  ] will hand over its responsibilities to the [ORG UN  ] ( [ORG MINURCAT II  ] ) . 
On the humanitarian front , he estimated that half of the displaced persons in [MISC Eastern  ] [LOC Chad  ] , mainly women , would begin coming home in [LOC Darfur  ] by March <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15. ---------------------------- Book and [ORG Transatlantic Paper  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As the meeting ended , the Secretary said there was a lot to digest and do . 
It would require cooperation . 
On a lighter note , [PER FM Kouchner  ] said that waiting journalists might raise the issue of " The [MISC World According to K  ] , " the expose published yesterday accusing him of enriching himself as a consultant in [LOC Africa  ] , tarnishing his humanitarian image . 
The Secretary dismissed the book , saying " One book ? 
I have 25 . 
You're not even in my league ! 
" He said that " the first one hurts a little more than the others . 
" The [ORG FM  ] asked the Secretary for [LOC US  ] reaction to the [ORG Transatlantic  ] paper passed to the [LOC U.S.  ] during the [MISC French  ] presidency .
