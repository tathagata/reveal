End Summary . 
Coffee with [ORG EU  ] President [PER Van Rompuy  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) As instructed ( reftel ) , I delivered the letter of congratulations from President [PER Obama  ] to new [ORG EU Council Permanent  ] President [PER Herman Van Rompuy  ] on December 23 . 
The meeting was arranged by his new Chief of Staff [PER Frans Van Daele  ] . 
I did not mean to engage in any substantive discussions nor enter into a domain better left to Ambassador [PER Kennard  ] . 
However , both [PER Van Daele  ] and [PER Van Rompuy  ] are friends of mine , and they invited me to have some coffee for about an hour . 
Given the holiday period , the [ORG EU Building  ] was virtually empty and both men seemed to have time to spare . 
We first discussed many social pleasantries: moving to new office space , the holidays , and family . 
[LOC Copenhagen  ] was a disaster for [LOC Europe  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C//NF ) [PER Van Rompuy  ] raised the recent COP 15 conference in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , calling it an “incredible disaster.” He was not angry , in the sense that he never seems angry , but he was as animated and as frustrated as I have seen him . 
He thought that [LOC Europe  ] had been “totally excluded” and was “mistreated.” He thought the only saving grace was that he was not there . 
[PER Van Rompuy  ] said , “had I been there , my Presidency would have been over before it began.” He said he was criticized for not being present in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , and added that he did not need to be there because he does not start in his new position until January 1 . 
He thought it was a wise decision not to attend the conference despite the pressure. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C//NF ) I responded by saying that I had no idea what actually happened since I was not there , but offered that from the reports I was seeing , it looked more like a chaotic meeting had occurred rather than any decision to exclude [LOC Europe  ] . 
But [PER Van Rompuy  ] did not give that explanation much credence , responding , “they could certainly have called [LOC Europe  ] and told us to come.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C//NF ) [PER Van Rompuy  ] did seem to ascribe some blame to [LOC Europe  ] . 
He said , “no one knows who to call: [LOC Merkel  ] , [LOC Barroso  ] , who knows who.” He said he planned to take control of getting [LOC Europe  ] on the same page . 
He mentioned that he had scheduled an informal [ORG EU  ] meeting in February to discuss the economy , but he was now going to use the meeting to discuss [LOC Copenhagen  ] in addition to the economy . 
He intends to get the [ORG EU  ] lined up . 
[LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] Need to [LOC Talk Climate  ] at [LOC Madrid  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C//NF ) [PER Van Rompuy  ] said he has , “given up on [LOC Mexico City  ] , ” with [PER Van Daele  ] calling the planned [ORG U.N.  ] COP 16 meeting to be held there November to December 2010 “Nightmare on [ORG Elm Street  ] 2 , ” and stating , “who wants to see that horror movie again.” [PER Van Rompuy  ] said , “multilateral meetings will not work.” He indicated that [LOC Europe  ] first had to get on the same page ; then [LOC Europe  ] had to meet with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; and finally they ( I think he meant [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) had to meet as well with [LOC China  ] . 
Rather than waiting for a failure at [LOC Mexico City  ] , he intends to address [LOC Copenhagen  ] issues with the [LOC United States  ] at [LOC Madrid  ] ; he envisioned engaging [LOC China  ] thereafter . 
In his mind , talks with the [LOC U.S.  ] would have to focus on [LOC Madrid  ] and [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000004 002 OF 002 not [LOC Mexico City  ] . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C//NF ) We talked briefly about my having opened the residence to the press to watch President [PER Obama  ] , s [LOC Afghanistan  ] speech live at 2:00 am [MISC Belgian  ] time on December 1 . 
That led [PER Van Rompuy  ] briefly to address [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said it was , “the last chance . 
[LOC Europe  ] is doing it and will go along out of deference to the [LOC United States  ] but not out of deference to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
No one believes in [LOC Afghanistan  ] any more . 
But we will give it 2010 to see results . 
If it doesn , t work , that will be it because it is the last chance . 
And if a [MISC Belgian  ] gets killed , it would be over for [LOC Belgium  ] right then.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) We parted with holiday wishes and talked about seeing an [LOC Anderlecht  ] football ( soccer ) game soon . 
I told him I was leaving him in the good hands of [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to the [ORG EU  ] [PER Bill Kennard  ] but would continue to see him socially. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C//NF ) Comment: [PER Van Rompuy’s Chief  ] of Staff [PER Frans Van Daele  ] is Belgium’s premier diplomat . 
He is a former Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] , Permanent Representative to [ORG NATO  ] , to the [ORG EU  ] , and most recently , Chief of Staff to outgoing [MISC Belgian  ] Foreign Minister , and now Prime Minister [PER Yves Leterme  ] . 
Much of what [PER Van Rompuy  ] said might be attributed to the pro-American [PER Van Daele  ] , who could have recommended that this appointment be used to deliver the messages on [LOC Copenhagen  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] .
