( C ) SUMMARY: [MISC France’s  ] new [LOC Africa  ] policy has received mixed reviews from [MISC Africans  ] uncertain as [LOC France  ] moves away from the “France-Afrique” model . 
Some [MISC Africans  ] seem to accept the outlines of the new policy , some have expressed misgivings about replacing the familiar with the unknown , and some have pushed back , with the [MISC French  ] having to make their own adjustments in both tone and substance . 
Meanwhile , the [MISC French  ] continue to refine their policy and to implement it , with a few notable stumbles along the way , such as the [PER Bockel  ] case involving [LOC Gabon  ] . 
They have tried to give fresh impetus to difficult relations with countries such as [LOC Angola  ] , [LOC Rwanda  ] , [LOC Djibouti  ] , and [LOC Madagascar  ] , with mixed results . 
In broader terms , the [MISC French  ] are also working to put in place revamped structures , particularly their military presence in [LOC Africa  ] ( [ORG Part III  ] , septel ) , to reflect the new policy . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Reftel describes “France-Afrique , ” the model that dominated [MISC France’s  ] [LOC Africa  ] policy for most of the 20th century . 
Believing that globalization , the fading of colonial and post-colonial sensibilities , and economic and political realities called for a new model , President [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] initiated change soon after taking office in May 2007 . 
He announced a new policy based on transparency , accountability , arms-length dealings , a calculation of interests , and a dialogue among equals . 
He sought to strip relations of what he viewed as sentimental and historical relics of the colonial era , which had stifled relations and fostered an unhealthy cycle of dependency and paternalism . 
Both sides would henceforth conduct relations crisply , efficiently , and openly . 
This cable discusses [MISC African  ] reactions to [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] policy and [MISC French  ] steps to implement it . 
[ORG Part III  ] ( septel ) focuses on structural changes the [MISC French  ] are making as part of the new policy , centered on [MISC France’s  ] military presence in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[ORG Pre-Election Image Problems  ] --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] new [LOC Africa  ] policy may have been a disquieting change in course for [MISC Africans  ] , yet not a surprise to them . 
Many [MISC Africans  ] were wary of [PER Sarkozy  ] before he took office . 
As Interior Minister , a job he held twice under President [PER Chirac  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] was well known for his no-nonsense law-and-order views . 
At Interior , [PER Sarkozy  ] made remarks that raised flags about his sensitivity toward [MISC France’s  ] minorities , particularly those with origins in [LOC Africa  ] , either the [LOC Maghreb  ] or [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
In June 2005 , after the killing of a young boy in a troubled [LOC Paris  ] suburb with a high number of minorities , [PER Sarkozy  ] said he would clean the area out “with a [PER Karcher  ] , ” referring to a [MISC German  ] high-pressure , water-hose cleaner . 
At the time of the November 2005 riots in [LOC France  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] described the rioters as “voyous” ( thugs ) and “racaille” ( scum , rabble ) , the latter term generating strong critical responses from [MISC France’s  ] minorities and from others worried about their Interior Minister’s ( and possible next President’s ) views on ethnic issues . 
Immigration and [LOC Africa  ] ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] compounded these concerns during a visit to [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Benin  ] in May 2006 as Interior Minister . 
Shortly before the trip , he had proposed changes in [MISC France’s  ] immigration laws , which became the focal point of his visits and prompted demonstrations against him in both countries . 
[MISC Malians  ] and Beninois perceived as anti-African his proposals for tightening the system then in place . 
During the trip , [PER Sarkozy  ] contrasted his vision of relations with [LOC Africa  ] with that of [PER Chirac  ] , and defended his immigration bill as a harbinger of a “new relationship” with [LOC Africa  ] , “cleaned up , simplified , and balanced away from the slag of the past.” In [LOC Benin  ] on May 19 , 2006 , he stated: “We must get rid of this network from another time , these officious emissaries who have no mandate other than the one they invent for [LOC PARIS  ] 00001568 002 OF 007 themselves . 
The normal functioning of institutions should prevail over the officious networks that have produced so much that is bad.” [MISC Africans  ] criticized the substance of his immigration proposals while the [MISC French  ] press noted archly that [PER Sarkozy  ] was obviously campaigning for the Presidency and saying things normally within the [MISC French  ] President’s proper domain. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Immigration remains an important sub-theme to [LOC Sarkozy’s Africa  ] policy , and is one of the hottest of hot-button issues in [LOC France  ] . 
Advocates of stricter controls fear the prospect of floods of [ORG Eastern Europeans  ] and migrants from all corners of [LOC Africa  ] , the [MISC Arab  ] world , and the [MISC Mediterranean  ] entering [LOC France  ] and then benefiting from its generous social programs and taking jobs , without assimilating and becoming “French.” [MISC Sub-Saharan Africans  ] are a visible , and to some [MISC French  ] , an unwelcome presence in [MISC France’s  ] urban areas , with much social commentary from left and right on their long-term effect and their ability to integrate and assimilate . 
Some wonder whether a [MISC French  ] national sports team can really be “French” with so many players of [MISC Arab  ] or [MISC African  ] origin ( notwithstanding the recent successes of [MISC French  ] teams of diverse origins ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Upon becoming President , [PER Sarkozy  ] installed close associate [PER Brice Hortefeux  ] as Minister of Immigration , Integration , National Identity , and Co-Development , a ministry that had never previously existed . 
Combining issues relating to immigration , integration , and , especially , “national identity” into a single executive body raised eyebrows among some observers , who believed that creating such a ministry not only indicated the priority [PER Sarkozy  ] placed on these matters but also carried overtones of the appeal [PER Sarkozy  ] made to right-wing , nationalist voters ( i.e. , [ORG Le Pen’s National Front  ] camp ) during the final stages of his campaign duel with Socialist [PER Segolene Royal.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Hortefeux  ] have emphasized the benefits that a reformed immigration policy would provide [MISC Africans  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] have concluded agreements with several [MISC African  ] countries establishing new procedures . 
One such agreement is with [LOC Gabon  ] , concluded on July 5 , 2007 , during a visit by [PER Hortefeux  ] . 
The accord ( 1 ) facilitates travel between the two countries by business persons , professionals , family members , and those with medical needs ; ( 2 ) enlarges employment possibilities for [MISC Gabonese  ] in certain professions desiring to establish themselves in [LOC France  ] ; ( 3 ) extends residency permits for [MISC French  ] in [LOC Gabon  ] to five years ; ( 4 ) prescribes procedures for treating clandestine entrants ; and ( 5 ) increases bilateral cooperation in countering fraudulent documents . 
The agreement , which on its face provides advantages to both sides , nonetheless became part of a [MISC France-Gabon  ] spat that included other issues , as described later in this message. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Some [MISC Africans  ] have disapproved of another part of [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] immigration policy -- the program to test [MISC DNA  ] to verify kinship as a basis for immigration . 
Legislation for such a program was initiated when [PER Sarkozy  ] was at Interior and has since been enacted after overcoming legal and political obstacles . 
[MISC African  ] reaction has been negative , with one article -- from [LOC Mali  ] in October 2007 -- capturing [MISC Africans  ] , dismay: “We have known , since the Second [MISC World War  ] , after the success of our ancestors , the [MISC Senegalese  ] riflemen , in the liberation of [LOC France  ] from the hands of [LOC Nazi Germany  ] , that our compatriots along with so many other [MISC Africans  ] have no longer been welcome on the banks of the [LOC Seine  ] . 
But to go so far as to examine the blood of people to control the migratory flow represents an unqualified case of cynicism and lowers [LOC France  ] to the level of nations where racism gains more and more ground.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC DNA  ] testing program appears to be going forward . 
In June 2008 , [PER Hortefeux  ] announced during a visit to [LOC Cape Verde  ] that [LOC France  ] would begin its first pilot program there in September . 
[LOC Cape Verde  ] is one of nine countries ( with [LOC Angola  ] , [LOC Bangladesh  ] , [LOC Cameroon  ] , [LOC Dominican Republic  ] , [LOC Ghana  ] , [LOC Guinea  ] , [LOC Madagascar  ] , and [LOC Pakistan  ] ) where [LOC France  ] plans to start [LOC PARIS  ] 00001568 003 OF 007 the program in the September 2008 timeframe . 
[LOC Cape Verde  ] authorities reportedly responded that they “took note of this demarche of consultation” but chose not to comment on this “unilateral [MISC French  ] decision.” [PER Hortefeux  ] said that “our new immigration policy is understood and shared by our [MISC African  ] friends.” [LOC Dakar  ] , July 2007 ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) With his stints at Interior , his provocative remarks , and the outline of this new immigration policy as backdrops , [PER Sarkozy  ] went to [LOC Dakar  ] in July 2007 . 
He had just won favorable reviews for organizing an international conference on Darfur in June , one of his first acts as President , which ostensibly demonstrated his interest in [LOC Africa  ] . 
On July 26 at the [ORG University of Dakar  ] , he delivered the first of three speeches outlining [MISC France’s  ] new [LOC Africa  ] policy . 
He did so carrying a fair amount of baggage , certain to face a skeptical , if not hostile , audience . 
Consistent with his aggressive image , he gave a hard-hitting speech , which , as noted reftel , was written by [ORG Special Advisor Henri Guaino  ] and not cleared through normal [ORG MFA  ] and Presidency channels . 
The [LOC Dakar  ] speech is worth examining because it was the public introduction to [MISC Africans  ] on their turf of both [PER Sarkozy  ] as President and of the policies he planned to pursue . 
That the speech was not vetted by GOF staff perhaps lends it an air of authenticity that would have been absent had it been sanitized. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In the [LOC Dakar  ] speech , [PER Sarkozy  ] said: “I did not come to erase the past , which can’t be erased . 
I did not come to deny either the faults or the crimes , for there were faults and crime... . 
I have come to propose , to the youth of [LOC Africa  ] , not to have you forget this tearing apart and this suffering , which cannot be forgotten , but to have you overcome and surpass them... . 
[LOC Africa  ] bears its share of responsibility for its own unhappiness . 
People have been killing each other in [LOC Africa  ] at least as much as they have in [LOC Europe...  ] . 
[MISC Europeans  ] came to [LOC Africa  ] as conquerors . 
They took the land and your ancestors . 
They banned the gods , the languages , the beliefs , the customs of your fathers . 
They told your fathers what they should think , what they should believe , what they should do . 
They cut your fathers from their past , they stripped them of their souls and roots . 
They disenchanted [MISC Africa.”  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] said that the colonist “took but I want to say with respect that he also gave . 
He constructed bridges , roads , hospitals , dispensaries , schools . 
He rendered virgin land fertile , he gave his effort , his work , his knowledge . 
I want to say here that not all the colonists were thieves , not all the colonists were exploiters... . 
Colonization is not responsible for all of [MISC Africa’s  ] current difficulties . 
It is not responsible for the bloody wars [MISC Africans  ] carry out with each other . 
It is not responsible for the genocides . 
It is not responsible for the dictators . 
It is not responsible for fanaticism . 
It is not responsible for the corruption , for the lies . 
It is not responsible for the waste and pollution... . 
The problem of [LOC Africa  ] , and permit me as a friend of [LOC Africa  ] to say it , is there . 
The challenge for [LOC Africa  ] is to enter more into history . 
It is to draw from within itself the energy , the strength , the desire , the willpower to listen to and to espouse its own history . 
The problem of [LOC Africa  ] is to stop always repeating , to stop always trotting out , to free itself from , the myth of the eternal return , to understand that the [MISC Golden Age  ] , which [LOC Africa  ] never stops longing for , will never come back because it never existed.” <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Many [MISC African  ] critics viewed the speech as condescending and paternalistic , two aspects of [PER France-Afrique Sarkozy  ] said he wanted to banish . 
Prominent [MISC Africans  ] faulted [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] ideas , including [ORG then-AU Commission  ] [PER Chairperson Konare  ] , who said: “This speech was not the kind of speech we were hoping for... . 
It reminded us of another age , especially his comment about peasants.” [PER Konare  ] was referring to a passage that critics found [LOC PARIS  ] 00001568 004 OF 007 especially demeaning: “The drama of [LOC Africa  ] is that the [MISC African  ] man has not entered enough into history . 
The [MISC African  ] peasant , for millennia , lives with the seasons , where the ideal life is to be in harmony with nature , and he knows only the eternal recycling of time marked by the rhythm of repetition without end of the same gestures and the same words . 
In this imagination , where everything always recycles , there is no place for either human adventure or for the idea of progress.” <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [LOC South Africa  ] President [PER Mbeki  ] , one of the few [MISC African  ] leaders to react favorably , reportedly wrote to [MISC Sarkozy:  ] “What you have said in [LOC Dakar  ] , Mr. President , indicates to me that we are fortunate to count on you as a citizen of [LOC Africa  ] , as a partner in the protracted struggle to achieve the renaissance of [LOC Africa  ] within the context of a [MISC European  ] renaissance and the rest of the world.” Perhaps not coincidentally , [PER Sarkozy  ] chose [LOC Cape Town  ] as the site for the third speech in his [LOC Africa  ] policy series ( to the dismay of francophone [LOC Africa  ] ) , identified [LOC South Africa  ] as a strategic partner , and , upon [MISC France’s  ] assuming the [ORG EU Presidency  ] in July 2008 , sponsored , as one of the Presidency’s initial acts , the first [LOC EU-South  ] [MISC Africa Summit  ] ( in [LOC Bordeaux  ] on July 25 ) . 
As [ORG Presidential Advisor Romain Serman  ] has observed , one of [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] operating principles is “reward the good , punish the bad.” Reining Him In and Slowing Him Down ----------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) After [LOC Dakar  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] went to [LOC Gabon  ] , where elder statesman and [MISC France-Afrique  ] supporter President [PER Bongo  ] received him with full honors . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] reportedly hesitated before going ; visiting a [MISC France-Afrique  ] stronghold , site of a [MISC French  ] military base , and source of valuable commerce ( especially petroleum ) could smack of the old-style courting and role playing he claimed he wanted to forego . 
In the end , he relented: “Omar [PER Bongo  ] is the dean of [MISC African  ] heads of state and , in [LOC Africa  ] , being the dean , that counts.” [PER Bongo  ] offered full pomp and circumstance , with festive crowds chanting “vive la [LOC France  ] , vive [PER Sarkozy  ] , vive l’amitie franco-gabonaise , ” and banners proclaiming this friendship prominently displayed . 
To some observers , the message was clear: “You say that [PER France-Afrique  ] is a thing of the past but , if [MISC Africans  ] really are equal partners , we have some say in the matter as well , and we say that [PER France-Afrique  ] is not in all respects so bad.” [PER Sarkozy  ] reportedly did not expect that kind of visit or that [PER Bongo  ] would offer a different reality. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] has in other ways shown himself to be out of step , with his bedside manner needing fine-tuning . 
[ORG Presidential Advisor Remi Marechaux  ] says that when [PER Sarkozy  ] is confident on substance or at ease with an interlocutor , he speaks freely without relying on briefing material . 
This occasionally causes problems when he strays from “official” policy , with others then steering the discussion back on course . 
When he is less familiar with an issue or with an interlocutor , he will read talking points verbatim , with little attempt to disguise what he is doing , sometimes thumbing through briefing books looking for information while his interlocutor is speaking. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] does not like to waste time and likes to get to the point , perhaps to excess . 
When President [PER Obiang  ] of [LOC Equatorial Guinea  ] met with [PER Sarkozy  ] in November 2007 , support staff on both sides were tardy in settling into place . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] did not wait and launched into his talking points as the staff filed into the meeting . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] engaged in no small talk and the meeting was over in minutes , to the bewilderment of his visitors . 
Our contacts at the Presidency indicate [PER Sarkozy  ] has since made an effort to be more “diplomatic , ” but one wonders whether he would ever dare to treat a [MISC Western  ] head of state in such a cursory manner , under any circumstances. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Flush with his early success at helping liberate [MISC Bulgarian  ] medical workers long detained in [LOC Libya  ] on dubious [LOC PARIS  ] 00001568 005 OF 007 charges , [PER Sarkozy  ] decided to intervene personally in [LOC Chad  ] after the [MISC Zoe’s Ark  ] effort to smuggle supposed Darfur orphans to [LOC France  ] was discovered and the perpetrators detained . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] went to [LOC Chad  ] early in November 2007 and negotiated the release of some of the detainees . 
After returning to [LOC Paris  ] , he thought of going there again to free those still in custody but decided against it . 
He was advised not to make a second trip as [LOC France  ] could not afford having him set a precedent by personally rushing off and responding to and managing a relatively low-level crisis . 
[LOC Chad  ] President Deby no doubt appreciated the visit [PER Sarkozy  ] did make , which probably increased [MISC Chad’s  ] leverage , as [PER Sarkozy  ] had put his own prestige in play . 
[PER Bongo Up  ] , [PER Bockel  ] Down , [PER France-Afrique  ] Still Kicking ---------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Jean-Marie Bockel  ] became State Secretary for Cooperation and [ORG Francophonie  ] ( reporting to the Foreign Minister ) when [PER Sarkozy  ] took office . 
[PER Bockel  ] , a Socialist , is a veteran politician and [ORG Mulhouse’s  ] mayor since 1989 , and was Commerce Minister 1984-1986 . 
On January 15 , 2008 , he gave an interview to [LOC Paris  ] daily [ORG Le Monde  ] , stating boldly ( and perhaps rashly ) that “I want to sign the death certificate of [MISC France-Afrique.” Asked  ] why it seemed that not much had changed despite [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] promise of a new [LOC Africa  ] policy , [PER Bockel  ] said: “France-Afrique is moribund... . 
It’s not a question of morale , but helping with development . 
For , because of the faulty governance in certain countries , our policy of cooperation , despite its many forms , doesn’t allow for progress commensurate with our effort.” <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Continuing , [PER Bockel  ] said that ineffectiveness prevailed because “bad governance , the wastage of public finds , the carelessness of certain administrative and political structures , the predation of certain leaders -- everybody knows these factors or supposes them . 
In total , of [MISC USD  ] 100 billion annually in aid for [LOC Africa  ] , [MISC USD  ] 30 billion evaporates . 
Certain countries have important petroleum resources , but their populations don’t benefit . 
Is it legitimate that our aid is distributed to countries that waste their own resources ? 
We must re-examine conditionalities , to evaluate the effectiveness of our aid.” <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) Bockel’s comments did not sit well with some [MISC Africans  ] , notably [LOC Gabon  ] President [PER Bongo  ] . 
A slow-moving [MISC French  ] judicial investigation of the holdings in [LOC France  ] of certain [MISC African  ] leaders , among them [PER Bongo  ] , was in progress even before [PER Sarkozy  ] went there in July 2007 . 
The investigation reportedly indicated that [PER Bongo  ] owned or was involved in the ownership of 33 properties in [LOC France  ] , including a [LOC Paris  ] mansion valued at 18 million euro ( currently , about [MISC USD  ] 27.15 million ) . 
The [MISC French  ] press picked up this case and did some investigating and reporting of its own . 
The [MISC Gabonese  ] took umbrage , with their [ORG MFA  ] stating its intention to “reflect” on the course of [MISC Franco-Gabonese  ] relations and mentioning a “cabal” and a “plot against [LOC Gabon  ] and its president.” <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Relations took a turn for the worse when , early in March 2008 , [LOC France  ] expelled two [MISC Gabonese  ] for apparent visa/residency problems . 
[LOC Gabon  ] immediately responded , noting that “there are many [MISC French  ] in [LOC Gabon  ] in irregular situations . 
They can be taken to the border if , during police controls , they don’t justify their presence with proper documentation.” [LOC Gabon  ] then raised the reciprocity provisions of the immigration accord signed the previous July ( para 7 , above ) . 
The noise level , mostly on Gabon’s side , increased. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) And then the noise suddenly stopped , after the March 18 announcement that [PER Bockel  ] would no longer be Secretary of State for Cooperation and [ORG Francophonie  ] , to be replaced by [PER Alain Joyandet  ] . 
Although officially denied , it was commonly accepted that [PER Bockel  ] had to go in order to make peace with figures such as [PER Bongo  ] . 
Media reports on the [MISC French  ] holdings of [MISC African  ] leaders also seemed to disappear at that time and so did the investigations . 
For his part , [LOC PARIS  ] 00001568 006 OF 007 [PER Bockel  ] issued a “no regrets about anything I said” statement , as he trundled off to his new job as Secretary of State for [MISC Veterans Affairs.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) The [PER Bockel  ] case is significant because it shows that “killing” [PER France-Afrique  ] is easier said than done ; that [PER France-Afrique  ] has a life of its own , with vested interests on the [MISC African  ] side that the [MISC French  ] perhaps underestimated when deciding on the new policy ; that [MISC African  ] leaders can manipulate [PER France-Afrique  ] for their own ends as well as the [MISC French  ] can or could ; that a clever , skillful leader like [PER Bongo  ] can fight far above Gabon’s weight and humble a [MISC French  ] politician of Bockel’s stature ; and that [LOC France  ] should take care in not trifling with [MISC Africans  ] ( which is what [PER Sarkozy  ] said in [LOC Dakar  ] that [LOC France  ] would no longer do ) . 
Bold talk of “signing [MISC France-Afrique’s  ] death certificate” ended with Bockel’s departure and has not resurfaced . 
[PER Bongo  ] made his point . 
Wins , Losses , Draws , and ? ? ? ---------------------------- <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] indicated that implementation of his new policy would take place on a clean slate , that he would not be a prisoner of the past or the problems that existed prior to his presidency . 
[PER Bongo  ] partly refuted that notion . 
The [PER Sarkozy  ] government has tried to improve problematic relations from earlier times , with only limited success . 
-- ANGOLA: Relations were long frozen because of the [LOC Falcone Affair  ] , the complex arms trafficking case that dates to the [PER Mitterrand  ] and [PER Chirac  ] eras . 
[MISC French  ] commercial activities in [LOC Angola  ] after the scandal broke have continued without much hindrance but political relations have been very limited . 
Frustrated that the [LOC Falcone  ] issue continued to influence relations and with an eye toward expanding business with resource-rich [LOC Angola  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] broke the ice with a short meeting with President [PER Dos Santos  ] during the September 2007 UNGA , and followed up with a visit to [LOC Angola  ] on May 23 , 2008 . 
One shared issue of concern is the trial in [LOC France  ] of some 42 defendants ( including high-profile figures such as [PER Jean-Christophe Mitterrand  ] , President Mitterrand’s son and a former “Mr . 
Africa” at the Presidency ) and what that trial may reveal in terms of [MISC Angolan  ] culpability in the affair . 
[MISC Angolans  ] now appear ready to handle whatever dirty laundry the trial brings to light . 
Although still at an early stage , [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] outreach to [LOC Angola  ] seems promising , and should be considered a “win” for both sides . 
-- RWANDA: Relations , precarious even before the 1994 genocide , collapsed in November 2006 when then-anti terrorism Judge Bruguiere issued an investigative report that implicated President [PER Kagame  ] and other senior [MISC Rwandans  ] in the events of 1994 . 
The [MISC Rwandans  ] immediately broke relations with [LOC France  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] have since tried to improve relations , arguing that neither side should hold the other hostage over events dating to 1994 and before . 
They stress that [MISC France’s  ] judiciary ( i.e. , a judge such as Bruguiere ) enjoys an independence that renders it immune from internal [ORG GOF  ] attempts to influence it . 
Seeking reconciliation , Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] met with President [PER Kagame  ] on January 26 , 2008 , in [LOC Kigali  ] . 
Despite [MISC French  ] optimism that the two sides can “compartmentalize” the genocide issue , [LOC Rwanda  ] is not amenable to doing so , landing another hammer blow with the August 2008 report accusing [MISC French  ] officials at the highest levels of complicity in the genocide . 
With relations getting worse and not better , [LOC Rwanda  ] must be considered a “loss.” -- DJIBOUTI: The [PER Borrel  ] Affair , involving the 1995 death of [MISC French  ] judge [PER Bernard Borrel  ] , who was working on assignment in [LOC Djibouti  ] when he committed suicide ( or was killed ) , continues to cloud relations . 
Both sides long considered his death a suicide but [PER Mrs. Borrel  ] was convinced he was murdered for having found evidence of [MISC Djiboutian  ] wrongdoing . 
She filed several legal proceedings in [LOC France  ] ; one resulted in the March 2007 conviction in absentia of two senior [MISC Djiboutian  ] figures for witness tampering . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00001568 007 OF 007 -- [LOC DJIBOUTI  ] ( cont , d ) : Despite periodic upheavals , the two sides managed to isolate the case until the convictions , which took place a few weeks before [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] inauguration . 
Soon after becoming President , [PER Sarkozy  ] met with [PER Mrs. Borrel  ] and the [ORG GOF  ] abruptly shifted position , saying that Borrel’s death was not a suicide but the result of foul play . 
It is not clear if the shift stemmed from a new evaluation of the evidence or from [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] desire to ally himself with [PER Mrs. Borrel  ] , whom the [MISC French  ] public and media have viewed sympathetically . 
[MISC Djiboutians  ] protested , countering that [PER Borrel  ] , if not a suicide , died because of involvement in a pedophile ring . 
Relations seemed destined to deteriorate but then [LOC France  ] provided important help to [LOC Djibouti  ] during its June 2008 border dispute with [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
[MISC France’s  ] military base in [LOC Djibouti  ] so far has not been a bargaining chip in the [PER Borrel  ] case . 
Relations with [LOC Djibouti  ] , while delicate , seem to be holding in place , with both sides enjoying a “draw.” That said , the [PER Borrel  ] issue remains unresolved and its unfolding will likely continue to affect relations . 
-- MADAGASCAR: To these wins , losses , and draws , one must add an abject “surrender” -- [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] agreeing to [LOC Madagascar  ] President Ravalomanana’s recent request that then-Ambassador to [LOC Madagascar  ] [PER Gildas  ] [ORG Le Lidec  ] be replaced after some six months at post . 
[PER Ravalomanana  ] reportedly thought that [ORG Le Lidec  ] was “unlucky , ” citing negative developments in other countries that coincided with [ORG Le Lidec’s  ] postings . 
One of [MISC France’s  ] most experienced diplomats , [ORG Le Lidec  ] had been ambassador in [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Cambodia  ] , [LOC C.A.R.  ] , [ORG DRC  ] , and [PER Cote  ] d , [LOC Ivoire  ] before [LOC Madagascar  ] , where he announced his departure at this year’s July 14 fete . 
When asked , most [ORG GOF  ] contacts shake their heads and sigh , making muted comments about [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] bending backward too far to placate [PER Ravalomanana  ] and ending a veteran public servant’s honorable career by humiliating him . 
Whether [ORG Le Lidec’s  ] dismissal represents a one-off or signals a new-found intention on [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] part to please [MISC African  ] leaders remains to be seen . 
One Year Later -------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) Over a year into [ORG Sarkozy’s  ] five-year term , his [LOC Africa  ] policy has yielded positive results for both [MISC French  ] and [MISC Africans  ] but has not been the clean-sweeping “out with the old , in with the new” success he was first seeking . 
In our view , he underestimated the scope of the challenge and overestimated his abilities as a relative outsider bringing his fabled dynamism to the task . 
He was tone-deaf to some of the dynamics developed over decades of [MISC France-Afrique  ] and his pace and rhythm ( let alone his policies ) did not accord with that of many [MISC African  ] counterparts . 
In saying openly that he wanted to end [MISC France-Afrique  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] inadvertently gave it a new spark of life , as [PER Bockel  ] learned the hard way. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) Nonetheless , the energy that [PER Sarkozy  ] is imparting stands in favorable contrast to the stagnation characterizing [LOC Africa  ] policy during [LOC Chirac’s  ] final years . 
[ORG Sarkozy’s  ] main shortcoming concerning [LOC Africa  ] may be that in his haste to end an admittedly shopworn policy , he launched himself into doing so without having completely integrated the lessons that were to be learned from it. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) Part III , the final segment of this series ( septel ) , will explore other aspects of [MISC France’s  ] implementation of its new [LOC Africa  ] policy , focusing on its military posture in that region .
