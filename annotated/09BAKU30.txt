<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [ORG BAKU  ] 000030 SIPDIS [ORG ANKARA  ] PLEASE PASS TO DAS BRYZA EO 12958 DECL: 01/13/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , AJ , [ORG TU  ] , [ORG ENRG SUBJECT:  ] AZERBAIJAN: [ORG BP  ] DOWNBEAT ON 2009 [MISC SHAH  ] DENIZ PHASE TWO PROGRESS REF: A ) [ORG BAKU  ] 1126 B ) [ORG BAKU  ] 1186 C ) [ORG ANKARA  ] 56 Classified By: [ORG CA Don Lu  ] , Reasons 1.2 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Acording to [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] , inability to reach agrement between [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] on the price of [MISC Shah Deniz Phase One  ] gas currently being sold toTurkey and on transit of [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] ga has delayed and will continue to delay the deveopment of the [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] project in 2009 . 
As such , [ORG SOCAR  ] might be more willing to first develop [ORG ACG  ] non-associated ( aka “deep” ) gas , as it can be developed relatively inexpensively and in increments , with the resulting gas sold to purely regional markets , including [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Iran  ] ( i.e. , no need to transit through [LOC Turkey  ] ) . 
The [MISC Central Azeri  ] Oil platform in the [ORG ACG  ] offshore oil mega-field has resumed production as of December , and the [ORG AIOC Consortium  ] expects production to reach pre-September 2008 levels within a few months . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On January 13 Charge met with [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] and [ORG UK CDA Simon Tonge  ] , to discuss recent energy issues . 
Also present were [ORG BP Azerbaijan Gas Marketing Manager  ] [PER Richard Ruddiman  ] , [ORG BP Azerbaijan Government Relations  ] VP [PER Seymour Khalilov  ] , and the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG UK Embassy Energy Officers  ] . 
[ORG SHAH DENIZ  ] DEVELOPMENT DELAYED <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In general , [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] was not optimistic on timely [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] ( [MISC SD2  ] ) development . 
As such , according to [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] , the [ORG Shah Deniz  ] ( [ORG SD  ] ) [ORG Consortium  ] will continue to slow-track [MISC SD2  ] development in 2009 , due to disputes over [MISC Shah Deniz Phase One  ] ( [LOC SD1  ] ) price and [MISC SD2  ] transit with the Government of [LOC Turkey  ] . 
In [LOC BP’s  ] opinion , an optimistic scenario is some type of agreement in 2009 , but currently the [ORG SD Consortium  ] has budgeted no more than a negligible , ‘placeholder’ amount on [MISC SD2  ] in 2009 due to lack of progress on SD1/SD2 in its talks with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] also noted that [ORG SOCAR  ] will probably also be marginally less likely to spend the large amounts needed for its share of [MISC SD2  ] investment given its vastly decreased oil-related income and that fact that the start of payback for any such [ORG SOCAR  ] investments is no earlier than 2015. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As for [LOC SD1  ] , [ORG BP  ] senses a reluctance from [ORG SOCAR  ] to go to arbitration with its [MISC Turkish  ] brother , but the two sides are still orders of magnitude apart on price for [LOC SD1  ] , with no real ‘negotiating’ occurring . 
[ORG BP  ] senses that the [ORG SD Consortium  ] would be willing to give GOT a price lower than the [MISC Gazprom/Iran  ] price ( as we have confirmed separately with [ORG SOCAR  ] ) , but Botas’s current offer is so low that “there is no real discussion going on.” [ORG ACG  ] DEEP GAS MAY MOVE FORWARD SOONER <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a related vein , [ORG BP  ] said it was seeing a continued increase of interest in [MISC Azeri Chirag  ] [ORG Guneshli  ] ( [ORG ACG  ] ) non-associated ( aka ‘deep’ ) gas from the [ORG GOAJ  ] , and thinks it possible the [ORG GOAJ  ] will seek to develop deep gas before [MISC SD2  ] , since development can be done far more cheaply and incrementally , with the resulting gas being sold to [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Georgia  ] ( i.e. , no need for [LOC Turkey  ] transit ) . 
[LOC TURKMENISTAN  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) When asked about the possibility of [MISC GOTX  ] gas being supplied to GOT , [ORG BP  ] repeated its opinion that due to the long timelines involved with gas development , there would be no [MISC GOTX  ] gas coming west earlier than 2020 . 
[MISC UKRAINE-RUSSIA  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] said that it thought that one result of the [MISC Gazprom-Ukraine  ] gas conflict , which has affected [MISC Turkish  ] gas supply , would be that the GOT would be even more focused on security of supply/supply diversification/getting as much gas as it can from [MISC SD2  ] . 
[LOC GEORGIA  ] 8 . 
( C ) According to [ORG BP  ] the [MISC Georgian  ] government is unusually quiet for this time of winter , i.e. not complaining about the lack of gas it is receiving from [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] says that [ORG SOCAR  ] is pushing as much gas to [LOC Georgia  ] as is obligated , and that [LOC Georgia  ] is also getting its full amount from [LOC SD1  ] . 
These two sources , plus the gas it is getting as transit gas , seem to be meeting the [ORG GA  ] demand , and [ORG BP  ] thinks it might be the case that [ORG GA  ] will not need any gas from [ORG Gazprom  ] this winter . 
[ORG BP  ] agreed that [ORG GA  ] could benefit from gas storage , pointing out that many countries try to have storage equal to 20 percent of its annual need . 
[MISC CENTRAL AZERI  ] GAS LEAK IDENTIFIED [ORG BAKU  ] 00000030 002 OF 002 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] has restarted oil production from [LOC CA  ] and is about to start re-injecting gas again in the [MISC Central Azeri  ] field . 
It has closed off a “few suspect wells” from which they think a bad cement job caused the leaking gas ( which is actually good news , since had it been a reservoir leak the damage would have been potentially non-repairable , whereas now all [ORG BP  ] has to do is fix the cement job around a few wells , a hard and expensive job to be sure , but preferable to losing the platform ) . 
Production is now around 700,000 bpd , and with gas injection they hope to get it back up to September levels , i.e . 
950,000 bpd. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Since this meeting , there is indication ( reftel c ) that [ORG Botas  ] has increased the price it is willing to pay for [MISC Shah Deniz Phase One  ] gas . 
Additionally , [ORG SOCAR  ] VP for Marketing [PER Elshad Nassirov  ] canceled a January 15 meeting scheduled with the [ORG Embassy  ] to fly on short-notice to [LOC Turkey  ] to meet with the [LOC Turks  ] on [MISC SD-related  ] issues . 
Embassy will be reporting on these developments septel .
