( U ) This is an action request . 
Please see paragraph 6. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Background: In October 2007 , we shared with [MISC Indian  ] officials information indicating that India’s [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had offered [MISC French-origin  ] , [MISC MTCR-controlled  ] graphite blocks to [ORG Iran’s Ward Commercial Company  ] ( [ORG Ref A  ] ) . 
[ORG Ward  ] had previously been involved in the procurement of items on behalf of the [ORG Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group  ] ( [ORG SHIG  ] - [ORG Iran’s  ] primary liquid propellant ballistic missile developer ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In November , we learned that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was working to ship additional consignments of graphite to [ORG Ward  ] , and that [MISC Indian  ] officials were holding a shipment of potentially nuclear-grade graphite blocks in the [ORG Air Cargo Complex  ] at the international airport in [LOC Mumbai  ] ( Ref B ) . 
We expressed our concerns to the [ORG GOI  ] about the possible imminent release of this graphite for onward shipment to [LOC Iran  ] , and also advised [MISC Indian  ] officials that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was readying follow-on shipments of graphite for [ORG Ward  ] . 
In response to our concerns , [MISC Indian  ] officials told us that they had begun an investigation of this matter , and that the shipment would not go forward until their investigation was complete ( [ORG Refs C & D  ] ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In December , we shared with the [ORG GOI  ] information indicating that four to five tons of graphite being readied at a [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] warehouse for shipment to [ORG Ward  ] had been moved from that location ( Ref E ) . 
This graphite - like the shipment at the [LOC Mumbai  ] airport - had been placed on hold by [MISC Indian  ] authorities , preventing its onward shipment . 
We had no information on the date of the graphite’s removal or its location , but believed that it could still be in the country , awaiting shipment to [LOC Iran  ] from another location in [LOC India  ] . 
[MISC Indian  ] authorities advised us that they had not cleared the graphite shipment for export because its investigation was not yet complete , and that they were working to locate the missing graphite ( Ref F ) . 
As of early January , the [ORG GOI  ] informed us that none of the graphite had shipped , and that [LOC India  ] was taking unspecified action on the case ( Ref G ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Objectives: We now want to follow-up with [MISC Indian  ] officials on this case , and request information concerning the status or whereabouts of the graphite ) both that which was detained at the Airport as well as the graphite that was removed from XXXXXXXXXXXX’s warehouse . 
We also want to share with [MISC Indian  ] officials new information identifying the intended end-user of the graphite as the [ORG Sahand Aluminum Parts Industrial Company  ] ( [ORG SAPICO  ] ) , a cover for [ORG Iran’s  ] primary liquid- fueled ballistic missile producer , and to advise the [ORG GOI  ] that Ward’s efforts to procure this graphite for [ORG SAPICO  ] continues. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
