End summary .

( U ) The [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] 's ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Executive Director , Dr. [PER Youssef Sawani  ] , authored a response to a recent letter from [ORG NGO Human Rights Watch  ] concerning [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi ( [ORG FAJ  ] ) , which was posted on the [ORG QDF  ] 's Arabic-language website February 6 ( informal translation below at para 6 ) . 
Main points of the letter are as follows: - Contrary to media reports and allegations by some members of [ORG FAJ  ] 's family , [ORG FAJ  ] has been held at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( not/not at a prison facility ) since his conviction ; - The [ORG QDF  ] has facilitated access to [ORG FAJ  ] for members of his family , including a visit as recently as last week by his son , [PER Mohammed  ] ; - The [ORG QDF  ] , pursuant to a personal suggestion by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , told the family [ORG FAJ  ] could be taken from the hospital to his home for treatment ; - The family has not accepted the offer , allegedly because some members of [ORG FAJ  ] 's family " ... wanted to exploit the case for political purposes " ; - The [ORG QDF  ] disputes the accuracy of [ORG HRW  ] 's report and invites the organization to verify [ORG FAJ  ] 's condition directly ( i.e. , invites them to [LOC Libya  ] to do so ) . 
3 . 
( C ) In addition to inviting [ORG HRW  ] to visit [LOC Libya  ] , [PER Sawani  ] said in a subsequent telcon with the [ORG CDA  ] February 7 that the [ORG GOL  ] was prepared to arrange a visit by [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy officers to [ORG FAJ  ] in hospital , and to facilitate a visit by an independent international medical team to assess [ORG FAJ  ] 's condition . 
He cautioned that Emboffs should not make their affiliation clear to avoid having the visit " misused " by [ORG FAJ  ] family members eager to exploit his case for political purposes . 
4 . 
( C ) [ORG Comment:  ] The [ORG QDF  ] 's invitation to [ORG HRW  ] and independent physicians to visit [ORG FAJ  ] in [LOC Libya  ] is a positive step . 
It seems that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam has concluded that addressing this case in a transparent manner is a better course of action than continued stonewalling ( which has been the [ORG GOL  ] 's response so far ) . 
[PER Saif  ] told us that he has discussed the matter with his father , and therefore he presumably has the Leader 's support . 
A successful visit by [ORG HRW  ] and/or [ORG PHR  ] would result in [ORG FAJ  ] 's return to his family with appropriate medical care . 
It would also potentially lay the foundation for future cooperation between [LOC HRW/PHR  ] and the [ORG QDF  ] on [MISC Libyan  ] human rights issues . 
On the other hand , it would be easy for [LOC HRW/PHR  ] to burn bridges here , i.e. , through strident or unsubstantiated public statements or some other action ( [PER Saif  ] 's chief of staff told [ORG CDA  ] , for instance , that when [ORG PHR  ] last visited , one of the physicians had taped a conversation with [ORG FAJ  ] that contained a political message and tried to take it out of the country ; [ORG PHR  ] , therefore , may not be the optimal choice for a medical team ) . 
Given the [ORG QDF  ] 's offer to allow [ORG HRW  ] and physicians to meet with [ORG FAJ  ] and facilitate his return to his family , we would not recommend pursuing a visit by an embassy officer at this time , which may risk further politicizing the case to [ORG FAJ  ] 's detriment . 
End comment .

( U ) Informal translation of [ORG QDF  ] letter follows: ( [PER Begin  ] text ) [ORG HR  ] groups and media outlest have published much information over thepast few days on [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi . 
The [ORG QDF  ] , to clarify , confirms that [ORG FAJ  ] has not been sentenced to prison since his trial began , but rather has been living in a house with full medical care . 
[ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000104 002 OF 002 [ORG QDF  ] notes that [ORG Physicians for Human Rights  ] and the [ORG World Federation of Health Organizations  ] have visited el-Jahmi and examined him medically . 
These groups expressed their thanks to the [ORG QDF  ] for facilitating the visits . 
After the verdict against el-Jahmi , which confirmed that he was not mentally balanced , el-Jahmi was hospitalized in the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] on court order . 
He has been there since the verdict to the present . 
The [ORG QDF  ] is committed to humanitarian principles and , owing to human rights concerns , enabled one of el-Jahmi 's sons , [PER Mohammed  ] , to visit him many times , most recently last week ; however , the [ORG QDF  ] went even further . 
The [ORG QDF  ] offered to the family that el-Jahmi return to his family home under medical treatment , but the family did not accept this suggestion , especially because some members of el-Jahmi 's family wanted to exploit the case for political purposes . 
At a time in which the [ORG QDF  ] has shown continued interest in [ORG FAJ  ] 's health and psychological condition and maintained a continuing relationship with [ORG FAJ  ] 's family , [ORG QDF  ] was surprised by the recently published [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] report ( on January 30 ) stating that [ORG FAJ  ] is seriously ill and required independent medical care . 
The [ORG QDF  ] stresses the inaccuracy of the [ORG HRW  ] report and calls on [ORG HRW  ] to verify its claims directly .
