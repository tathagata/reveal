[PER Zapatero  ] was criticized for his poor relations with the [ORG USG  ] during the [ORG Bush Administration  ] ( a result of his [LOC Iraq  ] pullout ) . 
His enthusiasm for President [PER Obama  ] and his desire for closer bilateral relations have resulted in [LOC GOS  ] willingness to send 511 more troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , pending legislative approval , and to take 5 Guantanamo detainees .
