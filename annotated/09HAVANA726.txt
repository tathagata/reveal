MADRID 1157 HAVANA 00000726 001.2 OF 003 Classified [ORG By: Principal Office Jonathan Farrar  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG COM  ] met December 2 with [MISC Spanish  ] ambassador to [LOC Cuba  ] [PER Manuel Cacho  ] at the latter , s request to discuss [LOC Spain  ] , s plans vis--vis [LOC Cuba  ] during [LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG EU  ] Presidency and the upcoming meeting between the Secretary and [MISC Spanish  ] FM [MISC Moratinos  ] . 
P/E Counselor separately met December 3 with his [MISC Spanish  ] counterpart . 
A preview of issues that [MISC Moratinos  ] may raise with the Secretary and other major points from both meetings follow . 
CONVERGING VIEWS , BUT NOT CONVERGENCE ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] stated that the [ORG USG  ] and the Government of [LOC Spain  ] ( [ORG GOS  ] ) used to differ on both strategy and objectives for [LOC Cuba  ] policy , with [LOC Spain  ] seeking engagement and gradual liberalization and the [ORG USG  ] seeking confrontation and regime change . 
[ORG COM  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] is engaging with the [ORG GOC  ] in a low-key manner on issues where we believe we can make progress , and continues to focus on improving respect for human rights . 
He agreed that there is opportunity for closer collaboration between the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC United States  ] on [LOC Cuba  ] such as the recent ( successful ) approaches to the [ORG GOC  ] to allow the travel to [LOC Spain  ] of [PER Elsa Morejon  ] , wife of prominent political prisoner [PER Oscar Biscet  ] . 
CLOSELY WATCHING [LOC U.S.  ] MOVES --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] Polcouns told his USINT counterpart that [LOC Spain  ] and all of the [ORG EU  ] countries were closely watching [LOC U.S.  ] moves in [LOC Cuba  ] , but dismissed that the [ORG EU  ] would wait for further developments in the [MISC U.S.-Cuba  ] relationship . 
" We have been traditionally ahead of you in engaging with [LOC Cuba  ] , " he said , " we can't afford to fall behind . 
" He dismissed reports of new [ORG EU  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ashton  ] 's comments on the need to wait for [MISC U.S.-Cuba  ] developments as " rookie misstatements . 
" MINIMAL CHANGE WITHIN [LOC CUBA  ] -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The ambassador and [ORG COM  ] agreed that there so far has been little political or economic reform within [LOC Cuba  ] since the passing of the [ORG GOC  ] reins from [PER Fidel  ] to [PER Raul Castro  ] . 
[ORG GOC  ] exhortations to [MISC Cubans  ] to work harder and more efficiently reflect a military mindset but are insufficient to improve in any meaningful way [LOC Cuba  ] , s economy . 
[PER Raul  ] increasingly has brought his people into high-level positions , which also has increased the role and influence of the military . 
Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] said the changes have made the [ORG GOC  ] more centralized and top-heavy , and that no outsiders have access to the small circle at the top . 
In contrast to when [PER Cacho  ] arrived a year ago , now even Cabinet ministers profess to him to have little idea of future policy directions . 
No one has stepped into the void left by the sacking of [PER Carlos Lage  ] . 
The Ambassador sees [PER Fidel  ] , s influence lately to be on the rise , and even speculated that [PER Fidel  ] might make an appearance at the upcoming [MISC ALBA  ] summit in [LOC Havana  ] . 
DO AWAY WITH THE [ORG EU  ] COMMON [ORG POSITION  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Cacho  ] said that Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] likely will raise with the Secretary [LOC Spain  ] , s interest in doing away with the [ORG Common Position  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] feels the [ORG Common Position  ] has failed to produce improvements in human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] and should be replaced by a negotiated agreement between the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] that would include human rights components . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Polcouns further added that [LOC Spain  ] and likeminded [ORG EU  ] HAVANA 00000726 002.2 OF 003 countries see the [ORG Common Position  ] as an irritant to the [ORG GOC  ] , which impedes better [MISC EU-Cuba  ] relations . 
Referring to the [ORG GOC  ] , s release and exile to [LOC Spain  ] of four political prisoners in 2007 , and the release of one prisoner following [PER Moratinos  ] , most recent visit to [LOC Cuba  ] , Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] asserted that the only human rights improvements in [LOC Cuba  ] have come through [LOC Spain  ] , s own bilateral dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Even those improvements were minimal , but the [ORG GOS  ] feels the [ORG Common Position  ] has run its course. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG COM  ] asked whether the [ORG GOS  ] believes that the entry into force of the [ORG Treaty  ] of [LOC Lisbon  ] means that unanimous consent is no longer required to do away with the [ORG Common Position  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] said this remains unclear until the [ORG Council of Europe  ] meets next April . 
In the meantime , the [ORG GOS  ] , s position is that [ORG EU  ] unity is more important than [LOC Cuba  ] policy and thus the [ORG GOS  ] would move only if there were no objections raised within the [ORG EU  ] . 
Notwithstanding this , the [MISC Spanish  ] are sounding much more resolute in their aims than they did just one months ago ( Ref A ) . 
[LOC CUBA  ] WANTS A POLITICAL CHANNEL TO THE WHITE HOUSE --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador said that [PER Moratinos  ] also is likely to raise [LOC Cuba  ] , s interest , as reportedly expressed to him by [PER Raul Castro  ] , for a &political channel8 to the [ORG USG  ] , particularly to the [LOC White House  ] . 
Only via such a &political channel8 would the [ORG GOC  ] be able to make major moves toward meeting [LOC U.S.  ] concerns ( note: [PER Cacho  ] was not in the [LOC Moratinos/Raul  ] meeting ) . 
In response , [ORG COM  ] ran through a list of specific issues on which we have engaged the [ORG GOC  ] and made advances and of other areas , such as our offer to lift the travel restrictions on our respective [MISC Interests Sections  ] , where we await concrete [ORG GOC  ] action . 
The [ORG GOC  ] should engage seriously through the existing channels . 
The [ORG COM  ] noted also that the current domestic political situation in [LOC Cuba  ] , as described above , was not conducive to grand gestures by the [ORG GOC  ] . 
In a side note , Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] asked why the [ORG GOC  ] had not accepted our offer to lift travel restrictions , which he felt would be to their advantage . 
[LOC Cuba  ] , s territory was much smaller , and the [ORG GOC  ] would control access to [ORG GOC  ] entities , which encompass much of [LOC Cuba  ] , s economy and societal institutions . 
CUBINT , s potential access would be much greater . 
[ORG COM  ] said that was a question better posited to the [ORG GOC  ] ; our offer remains on the table . 
[ORG EU  ] [MISC TROIKA  ] AND CUBA: NOT AS BAD AS IT SEEMS ------------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] said the recent [MISC Troika  ] meeting had gone reasonably well considering the difficulty the [ORG GOC  ] had in engaging with the [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency . 
[ORG COM  ] noted the harsh rhetoric directed toward the [ORG EU  ] in the [ORG GOC  ] statement issued after the talks , and asked if that masked any progress on human rights issues during the talks themselves . 
[PER Cacho  ] said no , but that the [ORG GOS  ] was hopeful of progress during its Presidency . 
In the meantime , the [ORG EU  ] internally was in agreement that there was little to gain from responding publicly to such diatribes . 
[MISC CUBAN  ] FIVE AND HUMAN RIGHTS --------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] said he had been asked that morning XXXXXXXXXXXX to demarche the [ORG GOC  ] to ask that they be allowed to visit their imprisoned relatives on [MISC Christmas Day  ] as a humanitarian gesture . 
He was prepared to do so but was skeptical he would obtain a positive response . 
The ambassador asked if [PER Perez O  ] , Conor and [PER Salanueva  ] , wives of two of the [MISC Cuban  ] Five , would receive visas to visit their husbands . 
[ORG COM  ] described the history of their ineligibilities and the differences between the two cases . 
The ambassador noted the [ORG GOC  ] , s interest in swapping the [MISC Cuban  ] FIVE for political prisoners in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[ORG COM  ] responded that the vast majority of the [LOC Damas  ] and their imprisoned relatives were opposed to any such offer . 
[LOC HAVANA  ] 00000726 003.2 OF 003 DOWNWARD ECONOMIC SPIRAL ------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The ambassador said [MISC Cuban  ] imports from [LOC Spain  ] were down 38% in August , similar to the decline from other trading partners . 
Some [MISC Spanish  ] exporters recently had been able to access and transfer funds previously frozen in their [MISC Cuban  ] bank accounts but only if they agreed to invest some of these proceeds in new exports to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
( [MISC Spanish  ] demands for payment during the [ORG International Trade Fair  ] were not well taken , and other contacts tell us that the head of the [ORG Spanish Chamber of Commerce  ] had fallen from grace with the [ORG GOC  ] after publicly criticizing [LOC Cuba  ] for letting unpaid bills pile up . 
) Ambassador [PER Cacho  ] observed that the [MISC Cuban  ] economy is in a downward spiral with no sign of when or how it might recover . 
His [ORG GOC  ] interlocutors a year ago talked of increasing opportunities for small scale enterprises ( paladares , etc . 
) and even timeshare developments , but such talk has ceased . 
COMMENT: VALUE IN COORDINATION ------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Despite differences in our views , we see value in coordinating with the [ORG GOS  ] on human rights issues in [LOC Cuba  ] both in capitals and on the ground in [LOC Havana  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] leads a substantial bloc within the [ORG EU  ] that favors engagement with the [ORG GOC  ] at almost any cost but will raise human rights-related issues privately with the [ORG GOC  ] when persuaded to do so XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
[LOC Spain  ] desires to speak for the entire [ORG EU  ] when it comes to [LOC Cuba  ] policy and is quick to reinterpret the public statements of other [ORG EU  ] interlocutors , e.g. , [MISC European  ] Commissioner for Development and [ORG Humanitarian Assistance de Gucht  ] and [ORG EU  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ashton  ] , when they don't fit the [MISC Spanish  ] line .
