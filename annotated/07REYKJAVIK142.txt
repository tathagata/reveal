( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's governing coalition hung on to a one-seat parliamentary majority in national elections on May 12 . 
However , the junior partner in the coalition is sufficiently weakened -- with its chairman and another sitting minister failing to get elected -- that the coalition 's survival is by no means a sure thing . 
While talks continue , Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] 's [ORG Independence Party  ] is putting out feelers to other possible partners . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The final results from [LOC Iceland  ] 's nationwide [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) elections on May 12 are as [ORG follows: Party Percent of votes Seats  ] ( change ) [ORG Independence  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) : 36.6 25 ( +3 ) [MISC Social Dem  ] . 
Alliance ( [ORG SDA  ] ) : 26.8 18 ( -2 ) Left-Green ( LG ) : 14.3 9 ( +4 ) Progressive ( PP ) : 11.7 7 ( -5 ) Liberal ( [ORG LP  ] ) : 7.3 4 ( 0 ) [ORG Iceland Movement  ] ( [ORG IM  ] ) : 3.3 0 Thirty-two seats are required to hold a majority in the 63-seat [ORG Althingi  ] . 
The new [ORG Iceland Movement  ] failed to win a seat as it did not cross the five percent threshold . 
Turnout was 83.6 percent , down from 87 percent in the last [ORG Althingi  ] elections in 2003. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) With these results , the governing [MISC Independence-Progressive  ] coalition holds a one-seat majority in the [ORG Althingi  ] despite coming out with less than 50 percent of the national vote . 
The [ORG IP  ] made significant gains and added three seats to its tally , helping to offset the [MISC Progressives'  ] losses . 
The results were extremely tight throughout the night of May 12-13 , with initial reports indicating that the government had lost its majority only to have that trend reversed as the night wore on . 
( Indeed , daily newspaper [ORG Frettabladid  ] wound up with a " [PER Dewey Defeats Truman  ] " moment as its first printing ran with the headline of " Government Falls After [MISC Progressives' Collapse  ] . 
" ) The fate of individual members of parliament was also very much in question , as it only became clear when the final vote tally was announced mid-morning on May 13 that Progressive Chairman and Minister of Industry [PER Jon Sigurdsson  ] had not been elected to a seat in the [ORG Althingi  ] . 
Two other Progressive ministers were also in jeopardy , with the Minister of Environment failing to retain her seat and the Minister of Health squeaking in at the last minute. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) was initially optimistic about continuing the coalition , stating that he " saw no need for immediate changes " to [MISC IP-PP  ] cooperation . 
As May 13 wore on , however , it became evident that the [MISC Progressives  ] were unsure about continuing as the ever-more-junior partner in the government . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] was noncommittal in a television appearance with other party leaders on the evening of May 13 , only allowing that " discussions are taking place " with the [MISC IP  ] and that the two parties will keep talking . 
In the meantime , [MISC IP  ] doubts have apparently grown about the reliability of the [MISC Progressives  ] as part of a one-seat majority -- an [MISC IP  ] insider noted to [MISC PolOff  ] that one newly-elected PP [ORG Althingi  ] member had " said things that [ PP Chair [PER Sigurdsson  ] ] should have told us himself in private " on a post-election talk show , raising questions about the stability of a continued [MISC IP-PP  ] partnership. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While failing to defeat the governing coalition directly , the left-leaning [ORG SDA  ] and Left-Green parties are simultaneously courting the [MISC Progressives  ] ( in the hopes of a three-member center-left coalition ) and the [ORG Independence Party  ] . 
The odds of a center-left government look slim given that the [ORG SDA  ] and LG both made industrial/environmental policy their centerpiece issues , attacking the [MISC Progressives  ] directly . 
Both leftist parties seem to believe that their chances of getting into power lie more with the [ORG Independence Party  ] , and their party leaders have been careful to keep all options open in their public statements . 
That said , leading newspaper Morgunbladid ( traditionally close to the [MISC IP  ] ) reported on May 14 that [ORG SDA  ] leader [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] had shown a fair degree of arrogance in her contacts with the [MISC IP  ] thus far , which if true would do little to soften the personal aversion that many in the [MISC IP  ] have towards her. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: By virtue of its strong performance in the elections and the public 's overwhelming confidence in PM [PER Haarde  ] , [ORG Independence  ] is largely in the driver 's seat . 
The challenge for [PER Haarde  ] will lie in finding a coalition partner that will not overly disrupt the [MISC IP  ] 's agenda while at the same time giving the coalition the strength it needs to survive . 
With an already-weakened [ORG Progressive Party  ] doing little to strengthen [MISC IP  ] confidence in the idea of a one-seat majority , prospects for an [MISC IP  ] pairing with the [MISC Social Democrats  ] or [MISC Left-Greens  ] are on the rise .
