REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: If it were not part of [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Calabria  ] would be a failed state . 
The 'Ndrangheta organized crime syndicate controls vast portions of its territory and economy , and accounts for at least three percent of [LOC Italy  ] 's GDP ( probably much more ) through drug trafficking , extortion and usury . 
Law enforcement is severely hampered by a lack of both sources and resources . 
[MISC Calabrians  ] have a reputation as a distant , difficult people , and their politicians are widely viewed as ineffective . 
Much of the region 's industry collapsed over a decade ago , leaving environmental and economic ruin . 
The region comes in last place in nearly every category of national economic assessments . 
Most of the politicians we met with on a recent visit were fatalistic , of the opinion that there was little that could be done to stop the region 's downward economic spiral or the stranglehold of the 'Ndrangheta. A few others disingenuously suggested that organized crime is no longer a problem . 
Nearly every interlocutor complained that the region lacks a civil society . 
Amid the doom and gloom , there are a few positive signs , nearly all from young people . 
This most problematical of [LOC Italy  ] 's regions will continue to be a drag on the country until the national government devotes the necessary attention and resources to solving these thorny problems . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [LOC Calabria  ] , the foot and toe of the [MISC Italian  ] boot , is beset by seemingly intractable problems . 
During a November 17-20 visit to all five provinces , virtually every interlocutor painted a picture of a region of weak and corrupt government , throttled by the iron grip of [LOC Western Europe  ] 's largest and most powerful organized crime syndicate , the 'Ndrangheta. The formal economy is in a shambles , with GDP per capita only half that of northern regions and official unemployment rates over 20 percent . 
No one believes the central government has much , if any , control of [LOC Calabria  ] , and local politicians are uniformly seen as ineffective and/or corrupt . 
If [LOC Calabria  ] were not part of [LOC Italy  ] , it would be a failed state . 
[LOC Catanzaro:  ] " We Are Used to Organized Crime " --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) We spent our first night in the bleak and chaotic regional capital of [LOC Catanzaro  ] , where , after repeatedly declining our requests for an appointment over the course of a year , the Regional President , [PER Agazio Loiero  ] , finally received us . 
[PER Loiero  ] complained about the region 's negative image and noted that organized crime , relatively inaccessible markets and poor infrastructure combine to discourage investment in the region . 
The perceived high risk of investing in [LOC Calabria  ] has also meant higher interest rates for entrepreneurs . 
However , [PER Loiero  ] was unable to offer any solution to the region 's difficulties , other than an idea to make low-interest loans available to small and medium enterprises with [ORG EU  ] structural funds . 
When the [ORG CG  ] asked how [PER Loiero  ] envisioned utilizing the nearly 14 million euros that the [ORG EU  ] has allocated for [LOC Calabria  ] , the President gave a vague reply and changed the subject . 
When the [ORG CG  ] asked whether [LOC Sicily  ] , where citizens' and industrialists' associations have joined law enforcement in actively opposing organized crime , could serve as a model for [LOC Calabria  ] , [PER Loiero  ] responded , " We are the real island . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We got an even more downbeat assessment from [LOC Catanzaro  ] 's chief prosecutor , [PER Antonio Lombardo  ] . 
[PER Lombardo  ] echoed what we had heard from other prosecutors about the difficulty of combating the 'Ndrangheta: its family-based structure and the lack of informers make it nearly impossible to penetrate . 
He bitterly complained about the lack of funding and personnel resources in a province where organized crime seems to control almost every facet of society . 
Only 12 of the 18 prosecutor positions are currently filled , and there are only five anti-Mafia prosecutors ; [PER Lombardo  ] bemoaned that few magistrates seek assignment to [LOC Calabria  ] and the central judicial authorities do not consider it a priority to fill the vacant positions . 
He added that his office does not even have the resources for an effective wiretapping program . 
Organized crime is not considered an emergency in [LOC Italy  ] , [PER Lombardo  ] observed: " It is a stable factor in our country . 
We are accustomed to losing part of our GDP to organized crime and we factor it in to our economic planning . 
" In [LOC Calabria  ] it is nearly impossible to avoid paying extortion or collaborating with the 'Ndrangheta , he went on ; " People are victims and accomplices at the same time . 
" While not denying the importance of law enforcement , [PER Lombardo  ] said that in an ideal environment it should have a marginal role . 
" We are no substitute for a clean and civil society and well-managed businesses . 
" [PER Vibo Valentia:  ] An " [ORG Indifferent Society  ] " --------------------------------------------- -- [PER NAPLES  ] 00000096 002.2 OF 004 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Prefect of [LOC Vibo Valentia  ] province , [PER Ennio Sodano  ] , has practically written [LOC Calabria  ] off . 
In his view , " the entire [MISC Calabrian  ] society is involved " in perpetuating an intractable situation . 
" Business owners pay extortion , but don't complain . 
They don't pay their taxes , " he said . 
" It 's a cultural problem , this indifferent society . 
" [PER Sodano  ] was highly critical of the lack of vision for spending the [ORG EU  ] structural funds . 
He made no bones of his desire to transfer out of [LOC Calabria  ] at the first opportunity. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The mayor of [LOC Vibo Valentia  ] apparently hoped our meeting would yield nothing more substantive than a photo op . 
He and his coterie clearly became uneasy when the [ORG CG  ] asked how the city is confronting the problem of organized crime , and he continually tried to steer the conversation to more superficial topics . 
The Provincial President was not much more communicative , never speaking above a whisper. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The regional president of the national environmental [PER NGO Legambiente  ] , [PER Nino Morabito  ] , who met us in [LOC Vibo  ] , opined that [LOC Calabria  ] has very few good politicians -- and none in leadership positions . 
Like [LOC Campania  ] , [LOC Calabria  ] has also experienced illegal dumping of toxic waste on its territory , but because the population is smaller , it often goes unnoticed . 
A lot of illegal waste comes into [LOC Calabria  ] not by land but by sea . 
One of the issues [PER Legambiente  ] is following closely is the almost ubiquitous illegal construction along the coast . 
The week before our visit , the [PER Legambiente  ] representative in [LOC Vibo Valentia  ] had his car set on fire , presumably to intimidate him from denouncing the rampant zoning and construction violations occurring in the province . 
He was able to extinguish the burning vehicle just before the fire spread to his house . 
" Now [MISC Kill Us All  ] " --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The morning of November 19 , we traveled to the town of [LOC Polistena  ] to meet with about 30 members of the group " [PER Ammazzateci Tutti  ] " -- " Now [MISC Kill Us All  ] , " so named in defiance of the 'Ndrangheta following the 2005 mob assassination of [LOC Calabria  ] regional Vice President [PER Francesco Fortugno  ] . 
The young people had traveled from all over the region to meet with us . 
Since its founding , [MISC Ammazzateci Tutti  ] has held regular demonstrations designed to pressure the [MISC Italian  ] state into taking action against the 'Ndrangheta ; in February 2007 , a protest in [LOC Reggio Calabria  ] drew thousands into the streets . 
One of the group 's organizers , law student [PER Aldo Pecora  ] , observed that organized crime and [ORG Masonic  ] societies control virtually every facet of society , including the economic and political systems . 
He asserted that the 'Ndrangheta may be viewed as the armed forces of powerful people . 
Unlike the [MISC Sicilian  ] [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] , he said , the 'Ndrangheta has close ties to [MISC Calabrian  ] government structures . 
The group formally asked the [ORG CG  ] to " save [LOC Calabria  ] . 
" " Children of [MISC Pythagoras  ] " ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Our next stop was [ORG Crotone  ] , on the [MISC Ionian  ] coast , where some 2,500 years ago [MISC Pythagoras  ] taught math at one of the premier universities of the [MISC Ancient Greek  ] world . 
Today [ORG Crotone  ] is beset by economic and environmental ruin after its three factories shut down in the 1990 's , leaving behind industrial slag and an unemployment rate of 24 percent . 
The local director of the [ORG Industrialists' Federation  ] ( [ORG Confindustria  ] ) pointed out that [ORG Crotone  ] has the lowest income per capita of any province in [LOC Italy  ] . 
The mayor and city council president told us that the city is trying to increase tourism by promoting the area 's [MISC Greek  ] heritage . 
" We are the children of [MISC Pythagoras  ] , " the city council president said proudly . 
But the officials observed that a major cleanup of the former industrial sites is a prerequisite ; contaminated with millions of tons of industrial zinc and other waste , these sites are opposite a major archeological zone . 
They expressed concern about awarding a contract for the cleanup , given the pervasive presence of organized crime . 
At our meeting with the provincial president we noted the innovative technology of the [MISC California-based  ] company , [ORG AdaptiveArc  ] , which may be the ideal solution for [ORG Crotone  ] 's environmental cleanup , and which already has attracted potential waste-to-energy contracts in [LOC Cosenza  ] and [LOC Vibo Valentia  ] . 
In the evening , the [ORG CG  ] addressed the local [ORG Rotary Club  ] , reiterating that the [LOC United States  ] is an engaged and dependable partner in a wide range of challenges from economic development to organized crime , but no one but the [MISC Calabrians  ] themselves can create a civil society in their territory . 
Business Environment [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000096 003.2 OF 004 --------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [MISC American  ] business interests are limited . 
[ORG General Electric  ] has a small plant ( producing air coolers and steam condensers ) in [LOC Vibo Valentia  ] , and the provincial president unrealistically hopes to get a second one . 
The savvy general manager of one of the best hotels in the region has spent two years and over one million euros to obtain authorizations for a five-star [ORG Marriott  ] resort on the [MISC Tyrrhenian  ] coast , but has been waiting for months for a ministry in [LOC Rome  ] to move the necessary paper . 
( Embassy [LOC Rome  ] is assisting . 
) [ORG AdaptiveArc  ] 's gasification plants are the only other potential investments on the horizon. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( SBU ) We had a useful meeting with the [LOC Calabria  ] [ORG Confindustria  ] young entrepreneurs in [LOC Catanzaro  ] , where the [ORG CG  ] explained many of the [ORG Mission  ] 's initiatives to promote innovation and growth . 
Unfortunately , an expected with regional [ORG Confindustria  ] president [PER Umberto de Rose  ] was canceled -- the third time he has missed a meeting with the [ORG CG  ] . 
The local [ORG Confindustria  ] director in [ORG Crotone  ] told us that [PER de Rose  ] has not taken a strong stand against members who pay extortion ( unlike in [LOC Sicily  ] , where [ORG Confindustria  ] expels those who do ) because he considers them to be victims who need support rather than expulsion . 
She added that law enforcement successes have not been as numerous in [LOC Calabria  ] as in [LOC Sicily  ] , and therefore business owners do not feel so bold . 
A year ago , when the [ORG CG  ] met with [ORG Confindustria  ] members in [LOC Reggio Calabria  ] , and asked whether they were prepared to follow the [LOC Sicily  ] 's lead , he received a decidedly nervous reaction. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Tourism remains one of the region 's hopes , despite inadequate infrastructure ( the [ORG Salerno-Reggio Calabria  ] highway has been under construction for decades and rail connections to and from anywhere off the [MISC Tyrrhenian  ] coast are terrible ) , environmental degradation , and organized crime . 
A year ago the [ORG CG  ] suggested that the President of the [ORG Province of Reggio Calabria  ] talk to tour operators representing the booming [LOC U.S.  ] cruise ship industry , whose thousands of customers regularly call at [MISC Sicilian  ] ports , just across the [LOC Strait of Messina  ] , about including a day in [LOC Reggio  ] to see the prized [MISC Greek  ] bronze statues and perhaps visit the archaeological site of [LOC Locri  ] . 
The President 's response was , " What 's a tour operator ? 
" When asked by [ORG Confindustria  ] 's young entrepreneurs in [LOC Catanzaro  ] how to attract [LOC U.S.  ] tourists , the [ORG CG  ] emphasized the need for the region to create a tourist identity , a brand that would set it apart from dozens of other possible destinations . 
Not Entirely Hopeless ---------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Despite the myriad difficulties facing the region , not everything is doom and gloom in [LOC Calabria  ] . 
During our November 17 stop in [LOC Cosenza  ] , the [ORG CG  ] discussed the [LOC U.S.  ] elections with a group of smart , articulate and well-prepared political science students at the [ORG University of Calabria  ] , one of the few bright spots in the region and where post has established a strong relationship ( the university is also developing an innovative technology transfer center , about which Regional President [PER Loiero  ] surprisingly seemed to know nothing ) . 
Our final stop , on November 20 in the town of [LOC San Giovanni  ] in [PER Fiore  ] , was an unexpected and welcome ray of hope . 
The town was home to [PER Gioacchino da Fiore  ] , the medieval theologian whose message of hope President-elect [PER Obama  ] repeatedly mentioned during the recent campaign , leading the town to invite him to visit . 
The remarkably upbeat , dynamic mayor had just returned from the [LOC U.S.  ] , where he negotiated a simulation training center for doctors and nurses with the [ORG University of Pittsburgh Medical Center  ] ( which already runs the highly successful ISMETT transplant center in [LOC Palermo  ] ) . 
The city of 19,000 has a small but active [MISC American  ] center , where our AmCit warden serves residents and visitors alike , and where the city offers [MISC English  ] lessons to young and old. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Comment: Throughout [LOC Calabria  ] , we heard the same laments over and over: the 'Ndrangheta calls the shots and there is little hope for the region . 
The lack of optimism has resulted in a continuous brain drain , with the best and brightest young people emigrating to the [LOC North  ] or to other countries in search of opportunity . 
As was the case during our previous visits to [LOC Calabria  ] , we were struck by the lack of vision and energy on the part of its politicians ( see refs A and D ) . 
Indeed , if [LOC Calabria  ] 's problems are going to be solved , it will take a concerted effort by the central government to reclaim the region as part of the [MISC Italian  ] state . 
While law enforcement successes ( which so far have been modest ) would no doubt contribute , there also needs to be a revolution in the way [MISC Calabrians  ] themselves view organized crime , corruption and above all civil society . 
We can help -- by encouraging the young [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000096 004.2 OF 004 members of [PER Ammazeteci Tutti  ] , by spreading our message of shared values , and by implementing USG initiatives such as [LOC Mission Italy  ] 's [ORG Partnership  ] for Growth . 
In the absence of strong government and institutions , we need to network with non-governmental interlocutors ; we productively used this trip to identify an important array of new audiences . 
But unless the central government gives greater priority to the region , [LOC Calabria  ] will continue to be a drain on the national economy and a territory in the hands of extortionists and drug smugglers .
