KIRKCONNELL FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Assistant Secretary for [MISC European  ] and [ORG Eurasian Affairs  ] [PER Phil Gordon  ] met with the 27 [ORG EU  ] Member State Political Directors in [LOC Stockholm  ] July 3 . 
He then met with the [ORG EU  ] Political Directors “troika , ” comprising [MISC Swedish  ] PolDir [PER Bjorn Lyrvall  ] , [ORG EU Council Secretariat DG Robert Cooper  ] , [ORG EU  ] External Relations Commission PolDir [PER Karel Kovanda  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] PolDir [PER Alfonso Lucini  ] , and [ORG EU Council Secretariat Policy Coordinator Helga Schmid.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER A/S Gordon  ] emphasized that post-election developments have not altered the [ORG Obama Administration’s  ] fundamental approach to the nuclear question , and [LOC UK  ] PolDir [PER Mark Lyall-Grant  ] urged the [ORG EU  ] to be in position “to move rapidly” with new sanctions at the beginning of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency in January 2010 . 
On the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , the [LOC United States  ] was focused on creating the conditions necessary for peace before proposing full-scale negotiations . 
This would require a stop to [MISC Israeli  ] settlements and efforts to build up [MISC Palestinian  ] security capacity and an end to violence and incitement . 
[MISC French  ] PolDir [PER Gerard Araud  ] raised the possibility of an [ORG EU  ] security force in support of a possible agreement . 
Regarding the [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] relationship , [PER Gordon  ] said that the [MISC Russians  ] are testing the [ORG Obama Administration  ] to see if it will compromise on its principles ; it won , t. ---- [LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Swedish  ] MFA Political Director [PER Bjorn Lyrvall  ] opened [PER A/S Gordon’s  ] discussion with the [ORG EU  ] 27 PolDirs by noting growing concern over internal developments in [LOC Iran  ] following last month’s presidential elections . 
Terming as “outrageous” regime statements blaming the unrest on foreign actors , [PER Lyrvall  ] discussed the importance of [ORG EU  ] unity in response to the detention of local employees of the [MISC British  ] embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] and noted that the [ORG EU  ] Political Directors had discussed “possible responses” to the detentions during their meetings earlier in the day . 
Asked to brief on the nuclear file , [ORG EU  ] DG for External and [ORG Politico-Military Affairs Robert Cooper  ] replied that he had little to say . 
The post-election unrest in [LOC Iran  ] seemed to entail “no new cooperation , perhaps rather less , ” and the [MISC Iranian  ] regime was now weaker and less legitimate . 
[PER Cooper  ] continued that “the prospects look difficult” for a meaningful [MISC Iranian  ] response to the [ORG P5  ] 1 offer , and that we had always seen this year as the key year for addressing this issue . 
[PER Cooper  ] concluded that , in the second half of this year , we must have “the beginning of a breakthrough.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In his introduction , [PER A/S Gordon  ] expressed the importance the [ORG Obama Administration  ] attaches to working with [LOC Europe  ] , stressing that the [LOC U.S.  ] realizes that it cannot handle matters alone and that [LOC Europe  ] is our most natural foreign policy partner . 
Concerning [MISC Iranian  ] election unrest , he said that the [MISC Administration’s  ] policy had denied the regime the opportunity to blame the [LOC U.S.  ] so now it was turning to the [LOC UK  ] . 
Asked about links between the post-election domestic situation and the negotiations on the nuclear file , [PER A/S Gordon  ] suggested that the regime might pursue one of several options . 
It might decide to engage the [ORG P5  ] 1 , which [PER A/S Gordon  ] ( and other [ORG EU  ] PolDirs ) assessed as unlikely . 
Or it could pretend to engage , while forestalling meaningful action . 
Lastly , it could refuse any dialogue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While now is not the time for the USG to increase its engagement , it is also not the time to reduce it , [PER Gordon  ] continued . 
The President’s approach would continue to highlight the path [LOC Iran  ] would need to take to address international concerns . 
But the clock was ticking as long as enrichment continued , [PER Gordon  ] added , so he urged the PolDirs to start thinking now about actions they might need to take by the end of the year to increase pressure on [LOC Tehran.  ] “Each day that passes sharpens the binary choice between accepting a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] or a military strike , either by [LOC Israel  ] or the [LOC U.S.  ] , ” [PER Gordon  ] continued . 
The successful development of a nuclear capability by [LOC Iran  ] would spell the death of the [ORG Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] , he concluded , because the international community would not be able to maintain credibility with other would-be nuclear powers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] Political Director [PER Lyall-Grant  ] agreed that the prospects for negotiations with [LOC Iran  ] were not good , but [LOC STOCKHOLM  ] 00000418 002.4 OF 006 argued that the [ORG P5  ] 1 must persevere “because the alternatives are grim.” If talks do not yield progress soon , then the [ORG EU  ] must “discreetly” think about additional sanctions even in the absence of a [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolution , which would be unlikely given the [MISC Russian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] positions . 
The [ORG EU  ] should be in position “to move rapidly” at the beginning of the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency ( in January 2010 ) with a set of sanctions that are “very substantive” in the areas of “trade , banking and possibly the hydrocarbons sector.” He also expressed gratitude for [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] solidarity with the [LOC UK  ] concerning its local embassy employees in [LOC Tehran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Iran  ] was turning into “a military dictatorship with an extremist ideology , ” stated [MISC German  ] Political Director [PER Volker Stanzel  ] . 
Therefore , the international community must not “play the game the [MISC Iranian  ] leaders want” and must not escalate in response to [MISC Iranian  ] escalations . 
Rather , engagement with the [MISC Iranian  ] opposition should continue where possible . 
Moreover , the international community should press [LOC Tehran  ] for a “yes/no” answer to the [ORG P5  ] 1 proposal by the time of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] in September . 
Efforts to keep [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] “in the boat” would be important , but even without them the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC United States  ] should “go ahead anyway” with additional autonomous sanctions. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] PolDir [PER Alfonso Lucini  ] noted “consensus that we need to prepare a [MISC Plan B  ] , ” but asked whether enhanced sanctions would “be enough” if [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] were not on board . 
Saying he preferred further [ORG UNSC  ] action on [LOC Iran  ] , [PER A/S Gordon  ] acknowledged that [LOC PRC  ] leaders’ concerns regarding [MISC China’s  ] internal stability*which requires sufficient oil imports to maintain economic growth*was a key factor in [LOC PRC  ] policy on [LOC Iran  ] . 
And while [LOC Russia  ] did not want to see a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] , it might also be motivated by a desire to ensure that the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG EU  ] do not enjoy a major foreign policy success in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Indeed , some in [LOC Moscow  ] might see advantages for [LOC Russia  ] if [LOC Israel  ] or the [LOC United States  ] used force against [LOC Iran  ] , which in their view would seriously damage [LOC U.S.  ] standing in the region , as well as dramatically increase the price of oil . 
Even if [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] refused to support a new [ORG UNSC  ] , joint [MISC U.S.-EU  ] actions would have a powerful impact on trade -- and be a powerful statement with respect to regime legitimacy . 
And if there were no new effort on sanctions , that failure to act would send a message to the rest of the world about the low risk of pursuing a nuclear program. ------------------------- [LOC MIDDLE EAST  ] PEACE PROCESS ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Turning to the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , [PER A/S Gordon  ] noted that after extensive consultations in the region , Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] had concluded the time was not ripe for full-scale negotiations between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
Rather , the conditions for successful negotiations needed to be created first . 
The [LOC United States  ] had “visibly and publicly” called for [LOC Israel  ] to halt all settlement activity , which helped create an atmosphere in which we could ask that [MISC Arabs  ] do hard things as well . 
[PER S/E Mitchell  ] has been urging [MISC Arab  ] governments to support the [MISC Palestinian Authority’s  ] security services in an effort to enhance security in the [LOC West Bank  ] and [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] saw no logic to engagement with [ORG Hamas  ] until it renounces violence and recognizes all past agreements , [PER A/S Gordon  ] continued . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] both need to remain engaged with both the [MISC Israelis  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] , there might be benefits in [LOC Washington  ] focusing its efforts on getting a stop to settlement activity while the [ORG EU  ] focused on efforts to build security in the [MISC PA-administered  ] territories. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Lyrvall  ] said the [ORG EU  ] very much welcomed the [LOC U.S.  ] approach and the President’s [LOC Cairo  ] speech . 
The gap between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] is very deep . 
[MISC Greek  ] PolDir [PER Tryphon Paraskevopoulos  ] stated that “no one in the [LOC Middle East  ] thinks [LOC Iran  ] will actually use nuclear weapons against [MISC Israel.”  ] Rather , they think [MISC Israeli  ] concerns over the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program are motivated by a desire to not lose their strategic dominance . 
He noted that whenever the international community took actions against [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iran  ] responded by firing up [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizbullah  ] to cause trouble . 
A regional approach , therefore , was needed , including improved ties with [LOC Syria  ] . 
The [MISC Greek  ] PolDir concluded elliptically that [LOC Qatar  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] needed to “stop playing with fire.” [PER A/S Gordon  ] noted that [LOC Syria  ] is the conduit for [MISC Iranian  ] arms into the region , and that [LOC U.S.  ] diplomacy is focused on weaning [LOC Syria  ] away from [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] [PER PolDir Araud  ] said that we should not get into any prolonged negotiations with the [MISC Israelis  ] on settlements ; [LOC STOCKHOLM  ] 00000418 003.2 OF 006 the core issue is negotiations between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
The [ORG Knesset  ] is unable to act . 
We already know the parameters of the peace agreement . 
If there is no strong international commitment to working this , the parties will not negotiate , he said . 
Nothing will be possible if the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [ORG EU  ] , and the [MISC Arab  ] states are not united in pressing both sides . 
He also raised the possibility of an [ORG EU  ] security force in support of a possible agreement . 
[PER A/S Gordon  ] agreed with [PER Araud  ] on settlements , but said that we need to improve the context for real negotiations by making progress on smaller issues , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] call for stopping settlements resonates with the [MISC Arabs  ] , and helps with asking them for funding for the [LOC PA  ] and reaching out to [LOC Israel.  ] -------------------- [MISC AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN  ] -------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) [PER A/S Gordon  ] outlined the significant steps the [ORG Obama Administration  ] was taking in [MISC Afghanistan:  ] 21,000 additional troops , the appointments of [PER SR Holbrooke  ] , [PER LTG McChrystal  ] , Amb . 
[PER Eikenberry  ] , as well as certain changes in strategy such as on narcotics . 
He asked that [MISC European  ] governments do more to explain to their publics that the [ORG EU  ] is not helping the [MISC Americans  ] with “an [MISC American  ] war.” [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] are global problems with serious security and humanitarian concerns for [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] agreed , pointing to ongoing discussions within the [ORG EU  ] on doing more on the civilian side , and noting that the upcoming [MISC Afghan  ] elections were crucial . 
[ORG European Commission  ] [PER PolDir Kovanda  ] stated that the [ORG EU  ] will deploy 250 observers from [LOC Member States  ] , [MISC PRTs  ] and local missions to monitor the elections along with 8,000 [MISC Afghan  ] observers , and expressed gratitude for [ORG NATO  ] , s indispensable in extremis support. ------ [LOC RUSSIA  ] ------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) At [LOC Lyrvall’s  ] request , [PER A/S Gordon  ] offered some impressions to the group on [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC Russia  ] . 
He said that we are looking to restore relations while also stressing our core principles ; e.g. , no spheres of influence , democracies have the right to choose alliances , and non-recognition of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
The [MISC Russians  ] , for their part , are exploring [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to compromise in the name of better relations , which we will not do . 
[PER A/S Gordon  ] said that with regard to the [MISC Medvedev  ] proposals , the [LOC U.S.  ] is not prepared to compromise on [MISC European  ] security . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] asked about expectations for the [ORG Moscow Summit  ] . 
[PER A/S Gordon  ] said we were not trying to overstate expectations , but we are talking seriously with the [MISC Russians  ] on arms control and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC Lithuanian  ] PolDir Eitvydas Bajarunas urged a common [MISC U.S.-EU  ] approach on [LOC Belarus  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] , and [PER A/S Gordon  ] replied that we can only interpret the Zeltser release as an expression of [LOC Belarus’s  ] interest in better relations , and that he was planning to go to [LOC Belarus  ] himself . 
He said [LOC Georgia  ] was a good example of the [LOC U.S.  ] not compromising its principles in the name of better relations with [MISC Moscow--  ] in fact , [LOC Russia  ] had been isolated on decisions regarding [ORG OSCE  ] and [ORG UNOMIG  ] ) and he noted the Vice President’s upcoming trip to [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine.  ] -------------- [ORG TROIKA MEETING  ] -------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) After his meeting with [PER EU27 PolDirs  ] , [PER Gordon  ] held a smaller meeting with the [ORG EU Political Directors  ] “troika , ” comprising [MISC Swedish  ] PolDir [PER Bjorn Lyrvall  ] , [ORG EU Council Secretariat DG Robert Cooper  ] , [ORG EU External Relations Commission  ] PolDir [PER Karel Kovanda Kovanda  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] PolDir [PER Alfonso Lucini  ] , and [ORG EU Council Secretariat Policy Coordinator  ] [PER Helga Schmid  ] . 
This smaller discussion focused on [LOC Russia  ] , the [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] region , the [MISC Western  ] [LOC Balkans  ] , and non-proliferation. ------ [LOC RUSSIA  ] ------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Gordon  ] conveyed that the [LOC U.S.  ] may be making some progress with [LOC Russia  ] on START follow-on negotiations , and may also be making progress with regard to cooperation on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We have little to no progress to report regarding [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The [MISC Russians  ] are testing the [ORG Obama Administration  ] to see if it will compromise ; it will not . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] commented that there have been no breakthroughs in [ORG EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG PCA  ] ) negotiations , and noted that the [MISC Russians  ] see the [ORG EU’s STOCKHOLM  ] 00000418 004.2 OF 006 [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] initiative through a zero-sum lens ; if it encourages closer [ORG EU  ] ties with six former-Soviet states , it must be anti-Russia . 
[PER Lucini  ] recommended engaging [LOC Russia  ] in the [ORG Eastern Partnership  ] through cooperation on concrete projects . 
[PER Helga Schmid  ] praised the [ORG OSCE  ] Ministerial in [LOC Corfu  ] for its emphasis on the indivisibility of [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] security. ------- [LOC GEORGIA  ] ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Schmid  ] commented that the [LOC Geneva  ] process is useful because it is the only venue which includes all parties to the [LOC Georgia  ] conflict . 
She encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to press [LOC Georgia  ] to work with the [ORG Abkhaz  ] ; the [ORG Abkhaz  ] have been rebuffed in their overtures to the [MISC Georgians  ] , and are left with no option but to seek Russia’s support . 
[PER Kovanda  ] similarly urged outreach to the [ORG Abkhaz  ] ; they are looking for some daylight with the [MISC Russians  ] , and we should help . 
[ORG EU  ] negotiations on visa facilitation with [LOC Georgia  ] are not going well . 
[PER Lucini  ] said we need to let [MISC Georgians  ] know we support them without giving [PER Saakashvili  ] “a blank check.” <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Gordon  ] said the [MISC Georgians  ] have shown reasonable restraint with protesters lately , marking a departure from previous behavior . 
Vice President Biden’s upcoming trip to [LOC Georgia  ] will emphasize the need to strengthen democratic institutions . 
[PER A/S Gordon  ] inquired about potential [LOC U.S.  ] participation in the EU’s [LOC Georgia  ] monitoring mission . 
An [MISC American  ] contribution*either official [ORG USG  ] or via NGOs--would showcase our commitment , and could potentially deter future [MISC Russian  ] misbehavior . 
[PER Schmid  ] noted that [LOC U.S.  ] participation would also mean opening the mission to [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] ; [LOC U.S.  ] political support might be preferable . 
[PER Cooper  ] agreed that it would be hard for the [ORG EU  ] to resist [MISC Turkish  ] participation in the [ORG EU  ] monitoring mission if the [LOC U.S.  ] participated , as [LOC Turkey  ] is an [ORG EU  ] candidate country . 
[MISC Turkish  ] participation would not necessarily be a bad thing , but it would “need some thinking about.” ------- [LOC BELARUS  ] ------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Schmid  ] said the [MISC Belarusians  ] are under huge pressure from [LOC Russia  ] to recognize [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] ; the [MISC Belarusian  ] FM told her so personally at [LOC Corfu  ] . 
[LOC Belarus  ] is bankrupt , and therefore vulnerable to [MISC Russian  ] exploitation . 
The [ORG EU  ] is looking into possible [ORG European Bank  ] for [ORG Reconstruction and Development  ] and [ORG IMF  ] support , on the order of two to three billion dollars . 
[PER Schmid  ] said “I don’t like [PER Luka  ] , but ( “ the Zeltser release was clearly intended as a signal. ------------------- [ORG EASTERN PARTNERSHIP  ] ------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Gordon  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] understands this ; we would like to associate ourselves with the [ORG EU’s Eastern Partnership  ] initiative . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] said an [MISC EU-Ukraine  ] FTA is looking increasingly unlikely due to [MISC Ukrainian  ] squabbling ; [LOC Moldova  ] is likewise “a mess.” It is difficult to anchor those countries into the [MISC European  ] integration process . 
On [LOC Armenia  ] , [PER A/S Gordon  ] said that resolving [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] is the key to unlocking [MISC Turkish-Armenian  ] relations , and consequently regional energy supplies . 
The [MISC Russians  ] have been reasonably productive on this account , but it is unclear whether they are just going through the motions or are seriously engaged , particularly as a [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] solution would facilitate a [MISC Southern Corridor  ] gas route . 
[PER Cooper  ] asserted that if the [MISC Russians  ] really wanted to resolve [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] , they would have done so already . 
On [LOC Ukraine  ] , [PER A/S Gordon  ] asserted that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not want to unconditionally bail [LOC Ukraine  ] out of its economic troubles . 
We should let IFIs ( particularly the [ORG IMF  ] ) help [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] need to urge Ukraine’s unwilling government to take difficult steps in this regard. --------------- [MISC WESTERN  ] [LOC BALKANS  ] --------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Pointing to [ORG EU  ] High Representative Solana/Vice President Biden’s and [MISC Swedish  ] FM Bildt/Deputy Secretary Steinberg’s recent joint engagement in the [LOC Balkans  ] , [PER A/S Gordon  ] said the more high-level [MISC U.S.-EU  ] cooperation we can organize in the [LOC Balkans  ] , the better . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] said that [LOC Sweden  ] wants to keep the EU’s enlargement agenda moving [ORG STOCKHOLM  ] 00000418 005.2 OF 006 during the [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency . 
Montenegro’s application is with the [ORG Commission  ] , and [LOC Macedonia  ] may receive a relatively positive [ORG EU  ] progress assessment . 
Fairly or unfairly , [LOC Macedonia  ] may have to compromise on the name issue in order to move forward on [ORG EU  ] accession . 
In [LOC Serbia  ] , implementation of the interim agreement is “deadlocked , ” and [MISC Dutch  ] FM Verhagen’s recent trip to [LOC Serbia  ] is unlikely to assuage the [LOC Netherlands’  ] concerns. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) On [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Herzegovina  ] , FM [MISC Bildt  ] and Deputy Secretary [PER Steinberg  ] planned to meet the following week to discuss the [LOC Prud  ] process . 
It is critical that [PER BiH  ] takes ownership of the 5 2 process , [PER Lyrvall  ] said . 
The [ORG EU  ] is enthusiastic about a transition in [PER BiH  ] as long as the conditions are met . 
There has to be recognition that the [ORG EUSR  ] mission would be less “intrusive” ; rather , the [ORG EU  ] would present a “pull factor” for reform , he added . 
[ORG EU  ] enlargement policy has been a successful incentive for reform elsewhere in the region . 
A significant shift in the [ORG Althea  ] mission should not take place until transition is secure on the civilian side , [PER Lyrvall  ] concluded . 
[PER Cooper  ] said there might come a point where we need to “force the issue” of state property ; if we do not resolve this before the autumn [ORG PIC  ] , then we’ll lose two years because of the [MISC Bosnian  ] elections . 
[PER Cooper  ] added that after a “miserable” [ORG PIC  ] , we should insist on conditionality . 
[PER BiH Croats  ] have gotten the message from [LOC Zagreb  ] to be productive. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Gordon  ] asked whether the [MISC Swedes  ] might invite the parties and the [LOC U.S.  ] to [LOC Stockholm  ] to resolve the state property issue . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] agrees that [ORG OHR  ] is not doing well , but we are reluctant to take away the crutch and make a leap of faith . 
He recounted a side conversation with [MISC French  ] [PER PolDir Gerard Araud  ] , who said that if we wean the [MISC Bosnians  ] off of the “drug” of [ORG OHR  ] , then the [ORG EU  ] can be the “methadone.” Furthermore , to conduct a military transition at the same time as the [ORG OHR/EU  ] transition would send the wrong signal and might invite problems . 
[PER Lucini  ] said [ORG EU  ] member states are talking to their militaries about the need to stay in [PER BiH  ] , but militaries are pushing back . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] conceded the need for “a comfort blanket.” <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) On [LOC Macedonia  ] , [PER A/S Gordon  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] is still letting [PER UNSR Nimetz  ] lead , and noted that Deputy Secretary [PER Steinberg  ] has talked to the [MISC Greeks  ] . 
While the [MISC Macedonians  ] need to “climb down” on issues such as naming their airport , they have a reasonable case on other topics such as their language , the name of their citizenship , etc . 
Some “climbing down” is needed on both sides. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) On [LOC Serbia  ] , [PER A/S Gordon  ] said that while we haven’t spoken to [ORG ICTY  ] prosecutor [PER Brammertz  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] is trying to provide further [ORG FBI  ] and forensic assistance . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is trying to determine what [MISC Serbian  ] steps are required in order to get the [MISC Dutch  ] on board with Serbia’s [ORG EU  ] accession process . 
What is the gap between “full [MISC Serbian  ] cooperation” and what the [MISC Serbs  ] are currently doing , and how can it be filled ? 
[PER Cooper  ] said we are caught in a vicious circle with [PER Brammertz  ] , who feels he cannot utter the words “full cooperation” but is trying to indicate as much in other terms. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) On [LOC Kosovo  ] , [PER Lyrvall  ] noted the sensitivities raised by the fact that five [ORG EU  ] member states do not recognize [MISC Kosovo’s  ] independence . 
However , even these recalcitrant member states would like to move forward with [MISC Kosovo’s  ] [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] noted the issue of visa liberalization in the [LOC Balkans  ] , and said the [ORG EU  ] has leverage on the [MISC Serbs  ] in this regard . 
[PER Cooper  ] stated that we have had some small successes in [LOC Kosovo  ] and some failures . 
The [MISC Battle of  ] [LOC Kosovo Polje  ] anniversary passed without incident , with the [MISC Serbian  ] royal family making some usefully anodyne speeches . 
But decentralization in [LOC Kosovo  ] will not succeed . 
[MISC Serbian  ] President [PER Tadic  ] has said that [LOC Serbia  ] cannot call on [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] to vote in [LOC Kosovo  ] , s elections . 
[ORG EUSR  ] for [LOC Kosovo  ] [PER Pieter Feith  ] thought we should think of 2011 as a deadline for bringing the [ORG ICO  ] process to an end: according to [PER Feith  ] , once a state is up and running , the international community should step back . 
The “six point” agenda is largely dead . 
A/S [PER Gordon  ] relayed that Deputy Secretary [PER Steinberg  ] told [LOC Kosovo  ] leaders that their comments on UNMIK were not helpful. ----------------- NON-PROLIFERATION ----------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [PER Lyrvall  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] was very encouraged by the [ORG Obama Administration’s  ] approach on non-proliferation . 
A/S [PER Gordon  ] said that the [ORG Administration  ] is serious about the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons , but realistic . 
If the international community hopes to promote a [ORG Fissile Material STOCKHOLM  ] 00000418 006.2 OF 006 Cut-off [PER Treaty  ] and create an international nuclear fuel bank , we must back the [ORG IAEA  ] with resources . 
The [ORG Administration  ] will try to get the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] ratified ; the prospects for ratification are uncertain , but are better now than before , in part due to improvements in scientific modeling over the past ten years . 
Regarding START talks with [LOC Russia  ] , the [ORG Administration  ] seeks a framework that permits fewer weapons than the [ORG Moscow Treaty  ] and that also includes delivery vehicles and warheads . 
Both sides want an agreement , but ratification is always a question . 
Raising [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Cooper  ] pointed out that a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] would “blow the NPT out of the water.” If we allow [LOC Iran  ] to develop the bomb , how can we credibly say “no” to the [MISC Egyptians  ] and the [MISC Saudis  ] ? <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( U ) Assistant Secretary [PER Gordon  ] has cleared this cable .
