Ford  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY . 
Three well-placed contacts in the [LOC Shia  ] holy city of [LOC Najaf  ] told us December 27 that [MISC Iranian  ] influence there is strong and that [MISC Ayatollah Muhammad  ] Said al-Hakim , whose family has ties to [LOC Iran  ] , likely will succeed the aging [PER Ayatollah Sistani  ] . 
They each opined al-Hakim could begin changing the [LOC Najaf  ] clerical establishment 's long-time opposition to the concept of clerical rule ( velayat-e faqih ) . 
One contact stated that the [LOC Najaf  ] clerics have secured permission from the [MISC Iraqi  ] government to start refusing to extend student visas for [MISC Iranians  ] studying in [LOC Najaf  ] in order to limit [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
Like many clerics here , these contacts were keenly political and they obviously dislike and fear the [ORG ISCI  ] political party . 
They asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to do more in [LOC Najaf  ] to help limit the [ORG Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq  ] ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) and [LOC Iran  ] but xxxxxxxxxxxxx was insistent this be done indirectly and with extreme caution . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------------------------ [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG ISCI  ] Spreading [LOC Velayat-e Faqih  ] in [LOC Najaf  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) PMIN and Poloffs on December 27 , 2008 discussed with contacts close to the [LOC Najaf  ] hawza ( seminary ) , [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Najaf  ] and hopes for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in combating those exposing velayat-e faqih ( clerical rule ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] decried the [MISC Iranian  ] government 's attempt to directly and indirectly spread its influence in [LOC Najaf  ] . 
During the debate in the [MISC Iraqi  ] parliament about the [ORG U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and the [ORG Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp Qods Force  ] commander [PER Qasem Soleimani  ] sent separate envoys to convince the marja'iya to speak against the agreement . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that the marja'iya responded that it would be inappropriate for them to comment on a security/political issue as a way of dodging [MISC Iranian  ] pressure . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also said [LOC Iran  ] is giving money to [MISC Iranian  ] students in the hawza , primarily through Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] 's office located in [LOC Najaf  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] generally disperses small amounts -- money for furniture or books , for example -- but recently gave a large sum to help a hawza student with his medical treatment , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that through financing [ORG Shahid  ] al-Mihrab ( Martyrs of the [MISC Pulpit  ] ) -- the [ORG Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq  ] 's ( [ORG ISCI  ] ) social and educational organization -- [LOC Iran  ] aims to spread the popularity of velayat-e faqih . 
( Note . 
[ORG Shahid  ] al-Mihrab is led by [PER Ammar al-Hakim  ] , [ORG ISCI  ] 's heir apparent . 
It is also the name [ORG ISCI  ] is using nationwide for its provincial election coalition . 
End note . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [ORG Shahid  ] al-Mihrab must be receiving [MISC Iranian  ] funding to be able to finance its wide network of offices in [LOC Iraq  ] and abroad . 
( [MISC Comment: While  ] driving through [LOC Najaf  ] , PMIN noticed the construction of a large [ORG Shahid  ] al-Mihrab complex at the 1920 [LOC Revolution Square  ] along the city 's main [MISC East-West  ] boulevard on property owned in 2003 by the now [MISC ISCI-dominated  ] provincial government . 
) ------------------------------------------ " Moderates " Unable to Compete With [MISC Iranian Money  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said in response to alleged infiltration by [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence , the hawza secured permission from the [MISC Iraqi  ] government to stand up a committee to review residence permits of non-Iraqi students at [LOC Najaf  ] 's religious schools . 
They have , he stated , allowed only the few [MISC Iranian  ] students who were present before the [LOC U.S.  ] invasion to continue their studies in [LOC Najaf  ] . 
Other [MISC Iranian  ] students are not receiving renewals on their student residence permits and are being asked to leave [LOC Najaf  ] when their permits expire. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not make a particular pitch on politics aside from warning about [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
By contrast , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] -- who also favor the " quietist " clerical tradition of [PER Sistani  ] and [PER Fayad  ] -- were pessimistic about the chances of " moderates " in the upcoming elections because [ORG ISCI  ] and [PER Da'wa  ] have been able to disperse government jobs and contracts to boost their support . 
( Note . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] is a parliamentarian from former Prime Minister [PER Ayad Allawi  ] 's party and [MISC Kalantar  ] , given the alternatives , probably also supports [PER Allawi  ] . 
End note . 
) [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000011 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] joked about [ORG ISCI  ] 's campaign slogan " With you , with you , " by rhetorically asking " with who ? 
[LOC Iran  ] ? 
" When asked about [ORG ISCI  ] 's history in [LOC Najaf  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] pointedly said [ORG ISCI  ] had zero support prior to 2003 but were able to use its [MISC Iranian-origin  ] militia , the [ORG Badr Corps  ] ( now [ORG Badr Organization  ] ) , to gain power . 
Despite switching its religious source of emulation to [PER Sistani  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed his [ORG Badr Organization  ] contacts still refer to the [MISC Iranian  ] Supreme Leader as " [PER Sayyid  ] al-Wali " ( the Master ) . ------------------------------------------ Fears of [MISC Grand Ayatollah Hakim  ] Succeeding [PER Sistani  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Our three hawza contacts fear that [LOC Iran  ] 's push in [LOC Najaf  ] coupled with [ORG ISCI  ] 's political dominance in the province are increasing the likelihood that [MISC Grand Ayatollah Muhammad  ] Said al-Hakim will succeed [PER Sistani  ] as [LOC Iraq  ] 's lead cleric . 
[PER Hakim  ] -- a nephew to [ORG ISCI  ] chairman Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim -- favors [MISC Iranian  ] velayat-e faqih , all three contacts said . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed it was telling that [PER Hakim  ] last year told his followers to celebrate the festival marking the end of [PER Ramadan  ] ( Eid al-Fitr ) on the day announced by [LOC Iran  ] 's [PER Khamenei  ] , not [PER Sistani  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was certain [PER Hakim  ] was now the probable replacement . 
[PER Rubai  ] highlighted that fellow [LOC Najaf  ] [MISC Ayatollah Bashir  ] al-Najafi al-Pakistani has begun speaking in favor of [PER Hakim  ] , something he was not doing only a couple of years ago . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] each claimed that al-Hakim and [PER Sistani  ] each give out relatively generous gifts of money to needy students and professors -- this is how one helps build influence , they observed . 
By contrast , al-Najafi and [PER Fayad  ] have few resources for such gifts , they noted. ------------------------------------- Seeking [LOC U.S.  ] Support , But [PER Carefully Done  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] bluntly told PMIN the [LOC U.S.  ] should , with a hidden hand , fund moderate hawza groups to counter [ORG ISCI  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
However , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [LOC United States  ] regularly irritates the marja'iya by , for example , clumsily -- if only briefly -- detaining important clerical figures . 
Perceived [MISC American  ] protection of the [ORG Mojahedin-e Khalq  ] ( [ORG MEK  ] ) also raises questions about [MISC American  ] judgment and intent , he claimed . 
( He didn't argue when PMIN reviewed our policy on [ORG MEK  ] but he said our position was not at all clear in [LOC Najaf  ] . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that [LOC U.S.  ] officials releasing to the media the contents of private discussions between the [ORG Coalition Provisional Authority  ] and top [LOC Najaf  ] clerics had led the clerics to decide not to speak to the [LOC U.S.  ] directly . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] advised that the [LOC U.S.  ] should not associate itself with [ORG ISCI  ] cleric [PER Jalal  ] ad-Din al-Saghir because he is hostile to the [LOC Najaf  ] hawza . 
When asked how " moderate " groups planned to compete in the provincial and national elections in 2009 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] clearly were defeatist and lacked a practical vision . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] fatalistically repeated that " there must be a ( political ) explosion " before [LOC Iraq  ] rids itself of the religious parties. -------- Comment -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) Our meetings with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] reflect a broad trend in [LOC Iraq:  ] the disenchantment and disorganization of those [ORG Shia  ] leaders who feel locked out of the political process and who feel [ORG ISCI  ] and [PER Da'wa  ] have used their positions in government to write rules favorable to themselves . 
Many [ORG Shia  ] still believe [ORG ISCI  ] is controlled by the [MISC Iranian  ] government and that the [ORG Badr Organization  ] wields power covertly in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
These [ORG Shia  ] dismiss evidence that [ORG ISCI  ] is becoming increasingly responsive to its [MISC Iraqi  ] QISCI is becoming increasingly responsive to its [MISC Iraqi  ] constituents and over the past few years have explicitly acted against [MISC Iranian  ] interest -- for example , by supporting the [ORG U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Comment continued . 
The looming passing of [MISC Grand Ayatollah  ] [PER Sistani  ] makes [LOC Najaf  ] pivotal for [LOC Iraq  ] 's ideological future . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] is a long-time contact of ours and , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is well-placed to give us insights into the top clerics' thinking . 
He was extremely nervous about being seen with PMIN and other [MISC American  ] diplomats , insisting on doing the meeting in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXxx  ] not [LOC Najaf  ] . 
His skittishness reminds of how cautious [PER Sistani  ] and the other ayatollahs are about being seen to meet with or collaborate with the [MISC Americans  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] was adamant that we should help contain [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Najaf  ] but that it had to be done indirectly by helping [MISC Iraqi  ] organizations who themselves want to limit [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
Overaggressive or direct [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in [LOC Najaf  ] 's religious scene would , according to [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000011 003 OF 003 his analysis , backfire , undercutting those pro-American [MISC Iraqis  ] walking a fine between religious purity and earthly power that could be derived from [LOC U.S.  ] support . 
If [PER XXXXXXXXXXXxx  ] analysis is correct , [MISC Iraqis  ] ( and to a lesser extent [MISC Iranians  ] ) will always be better placed than the [LOC U.S.  ] to understand and work within the nuances of [LOC Najaf  ] 's religious society .
