( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] The two detained [MISC Swiss  ] citizens , now held in [LOC Libya  ] for approximately 16 months , were each sentenced to16 months in prison by a [MISC Libyan  ] immigration court on November 30 . 
According to [MISC Swiss  ] Charge [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] , the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens , who were sentenced in absentia , most likely will not leave the embassy to attend hearings for tax-related violations , scheduled for December 5 and <a id='par6' href='#par6'>Â¶</a>6 . 
Concerned that the [MISC Libyans  ] might up the ante and declare him persona non grata , [PER Lazarotto  ] requested December 1 that the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy provide material assistance to the detained [MISC Swiss  ] if/if that were to occur . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] said he had been instructed by [LOC Bern  ] to make the request of our embassy and several [ORG EU  ] embassies in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Given other sensitive issues currently pending on the bilateral agenda , we believe a visible [LOC U.S.  ] role in assisting the [MISC Swiss  ] could be highly detrimental to our own interests . 
Department 's guidance is requested . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) [MISC Swiss  ] Charge [PER Stefano Lazarotto  ] expressed his continued concern to Pol/Econ Chief November 30 about the welfare of the two detained [MISC Swiss  ] citizens , who have not been allowed to the leave [LOC Libya  ] for over 16 months . 
Earlier the same day , an immigration judge sentenced each of the two men , in absentia , to 16 months in prison . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] related that the lawyer for the [MISC Swiss  ] appeared before the court alone November 30 , to request a formal statement of the immigration charges ; the judge refused , claiming that the [MISC Swiss  ] had appeared before his court shortly after their release from [MISC Libyan  ] custody on November 9 . 
The judge said he had heard their arguments at that time and had informed them that he would issue a sentence the following week . 
According to [PER Lazarotto  ] , the lawyer argued that to sentence the accused without a proper trial and without the presence of legal counsel , was a miscarriage of justice -- an argument that was lost on the judge . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] have asked their lawyer to file an appeal to the decision . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Lazarotto  ] said that the [MISC Swiss  ] were prepared to appear before the court on November 30 , but were advised by their lawyer not to go unless they were assured that a proper trial would take place . 
According to [PER Lazarotto  ] , three representatives of ( unspecified ) [ORG EU  ] embassies were prepared to accompany the detained citizens to the trial . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] noted that three additional [ORG EU  ] embassy officials had been " on standby . 
" [ Note: A [LOC UK  ] political officer told poloff November 25 that the [ORG EU  ] embassies had decided to send lower-level representation , if any , to the [MISC Swiss  ] hearings , but that the decision to send a representative would be made by the individual embassies . 
End note . 
] 4 . 
( C ) Given the sentence , the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens most likely will not attend hearings before the tax court , scheduled for December 5 and 6 , although they have been provided with a copy of the tax-related charges held against them . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] noted that execution of the sentence would pose a threat to other foreign business interests in [LOC Libya  ] , demonstrating that the [ORG GOL  ] was willing to exact retribution on businesspeople in response to political disagreements . 
[ Note: A few General Managers of [LOC U.S.  ] companies operating in [LOC Libya  ] recently expressed similar concerns . 
End note . 
] 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a separate meeting on December 1 , [PER Lazarotto  ] informed Pol/Econ Chief that he had been discussing with [LOC Bern  ] the various worst-case scenarios that could come now that a sentence has been issued . 
He expressed his fear that the [MISC Libyans  ] could declare him persona non grata if he did not hand the detained [MISC Swiss  ] over to [MISC Libyan  ] authorities , although he claimed that he had not been threatened in such a way . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] noted that in a meeting several weeks ago with the [ORG MFA  ] , he was told that the [ORG GOL  ] would do " anything " to make sure that the detained [MISC Swiss  ] completed their sentences once verdicts were reached . 
[PER Lazarotto  ] was accused in the same meeting of trying to help the [MISC Swiss  ] escape . 
Lazorotto continued that this hypothetical situation would remove the last [MISC Swiss  ] diplomat from the country and would effectively force the detained citizens to leave the protection of the embassy premises when their food supply ran out . 
In order to protect the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens , [PER Lazarotto  ] explained that [LOC Bern  ] had instructed him to request third-country commitments of assistance to deliver food supplies and to monitor their health and well-being . 
He confided that he did not expect a single embassy to respond positively to the request . 
Pol/Econ Chief undertook to convey the request but did not offer any promises of assistance . 
6 . 
( C ) [PER Lazarotto  ] did not believe the [MISC Libyans  ] were interested in moving forward with the bilateral relationship . 
Instead , [PER Lazarotto  ] surmised that the [ORG GOL  ] was now focused on pressuring [ORG EU  ] countries not to support the [MISC Swiss  ] , rather than achieving a [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000942 002.2 OF 002 bilateral resolution . 
He explained that the [ORG EU  ] ambassadors had been convened by the Foreign Minister November 29 to hear his complaints about [LOC Switzerland  ] 's continued use of its [LOC Schengen  ] veto on [MISC Libyan  ] visa applicants and how that would negatively affecting larger [ORG EU  ] interests . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The sentencing of the [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen without trial underscores the serious shortcomings in [LOC Libya  ] 's judicial systems and will send a chilling warning to foreign investors . 
In the wake of this escalating , high-profile dispute , the [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] political relationship continues its downward spiral . 
The recent [MISC Swiss  ] move to ban [LOC Libya  ] from the [ORG World Economic Forum  ] will not improve matters , and it is not outside of the realm of possibility that the [MISC Swiss  ] Charge could be asked to leave the country . 
If/if the [MISC Swiss  ] Charge is in fact PNG'ed , we believe that a direct [ORG USG  ] role in providing assistance to the [MISC Swiss  ] citizens could be detrimental to our own bilateral interests . 
Although we appreciate the gravity of the humanitarian situation , we believe a visible [LOC U.S.  ] role in assisting the [MISC Swiss  ] could undermine our efforts to resolve the outstanding [ORG HEU  ] shipment . 
Department 's guidance on the [MISC Swiss  ] request for support is requested .
