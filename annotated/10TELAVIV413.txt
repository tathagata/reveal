( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: In February 16-17 meetings , Senior [ORG Shin Bet  ] officials outlined for [MISC Emboffs  ] their views on recent trends in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] 's economy , including the paradoxical effect of " clean " [ORG Palestinian Monetary Authority  ] ( [ORG PMA  ] ) -regulated banks serving [ORG Hamas  ] interests , the operating dynamics of a market split between legitimate and illicit activity , and the growing economic division between [LOC Gaza  ] and the [ORG West Bank  ] . 
The legitimate market sector , anchored by the [MISC PMA-regulated  ] private banking system is mirrored by an alternative [ORG Hamas  ] financial system , both of which are linked by currency flows and trade . 
End Summary. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The [MISC PMA-regulated  ] private banking system - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC PMA-regulated  ] private banking network provides the backbone for the legitimate sector of [LOC Gaza  ] 's market . 
Salaries paid by the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , international aid , and legitimate trade finance all flow through these banks . 
New [MISC Israeli  ] Shekels ( NIS ) and [LOC U.S.  ] Dollars ( USD ) comprise the majority of hard currency transfers . 
The private banks that operate under PMA-supervision are well-regulated according to [MISC PMA-prescribed  ] Anti-Money Laundering legislation . 
According to [ORG Shin Bet  ] , suspicious activity is usually reported , and [ORG Hamas  ] has been unable to make any significant inroads in bank activities . 
The banks have maintained their independence from the [ORG Hamas  ] regime with the threat that they will close if [ORG Hamas  ] attempts infiltration . 
The banks will not let [ORG Hamas  ] operatives open bank accounts or have their salaries deposited in any existing accounts . 
[ORG Shin Bet  ] has not seen any attacks on the banks by Hamas-affiliated groups or individuals. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) However , [ORG Shin Bet  ] officials assess that [ORG Hamas  ] is significantly benefiting from the [MISC PMA-regulated  ] banks , even though they do not directly utilize them for commercial activity . 
These well-operated banks , which are " clean " of money-laundering or terror finance , provide the non-Hamas population of the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] with a key financial service that improves their quality of life . 
[ORG Shin Bet  ] believes that due to a lack of successful strategic messaging by the [ORG PA  ] and [ORG PMA  ] that makes clear how they--and not Hamas--are providing these private banks as a public service , [ORG Hamas  ] has been able to take full credit . 
[ORG Hamas  ] has led the [LOC Gaza  ] population to believe that it is their leadership which has enabled these banks to function relatively effectively and without corruption . 
As such , even though they are not under [ORG Hamas  ] control , the [MISC PMA-regulated  ] private banks support [ORG Hamas  ] because they provide a necessary financial service at no cost to the [ORG Hamas  ] regime . 
[ORG Shin Bet  ] argues that this is why the banks' threats of closure have proven effective against [ORG Hamas  ] encroachment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Shin Bet  ] also believes that the private [MISC Palestinian  ] banks operating branches in [LOC Gaza  ] would prefer to close them due to low profitability relative to risk . 
Political considerations and pressure from the [ORG PA  ] , [ORG PMA  ] , and others , are the primary reason why they remain in operation . 
While [ORG Shin Bet  ] faults the [ORG PA  ] for not getting more street credit for the [LOC Gaza  ] banking system , they agree that a pull-out by the banks would be a political and psychological blow to the [LOC PA.  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The [ORG Hamas  ] Alternative Financial System - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A [ORG Hamas  ] alternative financial system exists parallel to the [MISC PMA-regulated  ] banking system . 
[ORG Hamas  ] smuggles in large quantities of foreign currencies ( primarily USD and [MISC Euros  ] ) in order to fund its operating expenses . 
According to [ORG Shin Bet  ] , their budget consists of three major parts: 1 ) [MISC USD  ] 200 million annually for government operating expenses ; 2 ) [MISC USD  ] 50 million each year to support the [ORG Hamas  ] movement 's civilian side and organization ; and , 3 ) [MISC USD  ] 40 million annually for its military wing and security apparatus . 
Over the past several months , shortages of cash for [ORG Hamas  ] salary payments ( usually made in [LOC USD  ] ) have been reported ( see REFs A and B ) . 
[ORG Shin Bet  ] now believes that this was due primarily to [MISC Israeli  ] efforts to thwart terror funds and [MISC Egyptian  ] counter-smuggling operations , not a lack of actual funding from abroad . 
Recently , however , [ORG Hamas  ] has adapted to this [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00000413 002 OF 003 crackdown and re-rerouted its smuggling operations , bypassing [LOC Cairo  ] and heading directly through [MISC Sinai  ] , thereby more easily evading detection . 
They have also reduced the size of amounts smuggled into [LOC Gaza  ] at one time to avoid large losses after any one interdiction . 
[ORG Shin Bet  ] also notes dwindling levels of support from the [MISC Egyptians  ] in stemming this flow of funds . 
Additionally , [ORG Hamas  ] has increased tax collection , as detailed in [LOC REF A.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) With these modifications , the parallel economy has been flourishing , and the delayed salary payments are not symptomatic of a more endemic problem . 
[ORG Hamas  ] has also established a second branch of its own [ORG National Islamic Bank  ] in [LOC Khan Yunis  ] , and is attempting to initiate correspondent relations abroad . 
[ORG Shin Bet  ] reiterated the importance of a timely [LOC U.S.  ] designation of the [ORG Hamas  ] " bank " to prevent this from happening , given that it would significantly increase the ease by which [ORG Hamas  ] could receive and transfer funds . 
[ORG Hamas  ] also continues to receive funding from [LOC Iran.  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Overall [ORG Gaza Market Dynamics  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) These parallel dynamics lead to an overall [LOC Gaza  ] economy based on imports from [LOC Egypt  ] through the smuggling tunnels , paid for in foreign currency--not [MISC Israeli  ] shekels . 
There has been a steady influx of shekels -- mostly from [ORG PA  ] salary payments into [LOC Gaza  ] -- with limited outbound circulation . 
Instead , these shekels are used predominately for internal exchange . 
Under the [MISC PMA-regulated  ] private banking system , individuals are paid in NIS from the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] . 
Local merchants conduct their business with the average [MISC Gazan  ] in NIS , who in turn use NIS for most of their daily purchases . 
However , in order to procure non-Israeli imports ( through the smuggling tunnels ) , the local merchants are required to convert these NIS into USD , since the exporters from [LOC Egypt  ] and elsewhere operate primarily in [LOC USD  ] . 
This results in a large amount of outgoing foreign currency for imported goods , while an insignificant amount of shekels leave the [LOC Gaza  ] market due to the near complete lack of trade with [LOC Israel  ] ( and , to a lesser degree , the [ORG West Bank  ] ) . 
When combined with [LOC Israel  ] 's restrictions on the transfer of hard currency both into and out of [LOC Gaza  ] , this has led to a surplus of shekels and deficit in foreign currencies ( including [MISC USD  ] and [MISC Jordanian  ] Dinars ) , which has allowed speculators ( including [ORG Hamas  ] , merchants and banks ) to exploit the system and profit from arbitrage. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the long run , [ORG Shin Bet  ] assesses that these currency imbalances destabilize [LOC Gaza  ] 's economy and will lead to pendulating NIS/USD exchange rates , the result of intermittent incremental changes in currencies permitted in and out by [LOC Israel  ] , variation in the quantities and types of currencies smuggled into [LOC Gaza  ] , and incentives to exploit systemic changes through arbitrage . 
They are concerned that there will be an eventual shift from the current mixed currency system , dominated by NIS , to sole use of foreign currency ( likely [MISC USD  ] ) . 
Local merchants have already attempted to require that [MISC Gazans  ] pay for goods in [LOC USD  ] or other foreign currencies , to minimize exchange-rate losses when they are forced to exchange the shekels for dollars or other foreign currencies , whether through the banking system or through the [LOC Hawala  ] ( money-changers ) , to purchase restock imported inventories . 
Because of the current shortage of [LOC USD  ] in the banking system , [MISC Gazans  ] have been unable to oblige and the local merchants have relented , according to [ORG Shin Bet  ] analysts . 
[LOC Israel  ] 's policy , per the [MISC Paris Protocol  ] , is to maintain use of shekels in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories , and the [MISC GOI  ] worries that if the shift to a non-shekel economy in [LOC Gaza  ] takes place , it will further solidify the separation of [LOC Gaza  ] from the [ORG West Bank.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) From a counter-terrorism perspective , [ORG Shin Bet  ] sees less of a security threat from a shekel-based [LOC Gaza  ] economy than a foreign-currency-based [LOC Gaza  ] . 
It sees no direct security threat from excess shekels in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[ORG Shin Bet  ] analysts have not seen any attempts to rob banks vaults , nor are they concerned that [ORG Hamas  ] or others could use shekels to purchase any materials from abroad that could be used for terrorism ( given that they would have to be exchanged first for currently lacking foreign currencies ) . 
Given the separation between [ORG Hamas  ] and the [MISC PMA-regulated  ] private banks , [ORG Shin Bet  ] assesses there to be little connection between these banks' stability and [LOC Israel  ] 's counter-terrorism goals . 
In the short-term , security concerns from a decrease in confidence in these banks by average [MISC Gazans  ] is negligible for [ORG TEL AVIV  ] 00000413 003 OF 003 [LOC Israel  ] . 
However , in the long-run , [ORG Shin Bet  ] officials conceded that it is important to preserve these institutions as one of the few alternatives to [ORG Hamas  ] in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] , and as a foundation for economic stability in [LOC Gaza  ] .
