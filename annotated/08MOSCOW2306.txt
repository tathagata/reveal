( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Since [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] 's election to the post of president , a degree of uncertainty permeated the press as the public tried to figure out what role his wife , [PER Svetlana Medvedeva  ] , would play in the new administration . 
The role of [ORG First Ladies  ] in [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC Soviet Union  ] has often been a contentious issue . 
Some , such as [PER Raisa Gorbacheva  ] , were quite active and frequently seen in public , while others , such as [PER Lyudmila Putina  ] , were more reclusive and less involved in state affairs . 
Due to her recent involvement in the planning for the " Day of Family , [PER Love  ] , and Fidelity , " many have compared [PER Medvedeva  ] to [PER Gorbacheva  ] , but that analogy seems less apt ; instead she seems to be altogether a new type of [MISC Russian  ] [ORG First Lady  ] , one who is more active than [PER Putina  ] , but -- for now -- less flashy than [PER Gorbacheva  ] . 
Previous [ORG First Ladies  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a May 14 article , [PER Georgiy Zotov  ] of the [LOC Moscow  ] daily [ORG Argumenty i Fakty  ] attempted to compare the roles of several [MISC Russian  ] first ladies to set-up a context for [PER Medvedeva  ] 's recent activities . 
While [PER Naina Khrushcheva  ] did travel with her husband to the [LOC U.S.  ] , she was not involved in his decision making . 
[PER Viktoriya Brezhneva  ] was not involved in her husband 's public life . 
[PER Raisa Gorbacheva  ] was perhaps the most controversial ; the public saw her as being overly active and her stylish dress provoked much criticism as the [LOC Soviet Union  ] teetered economically . 
Yet [PER Zotov  ] asserted that [PER Mikhail Gorbachev  ] would not make any decisions without first consulting her . 
[PER Naina Yeltsina  ] always traveled with her husband but spent her time smoothing his increasingly erratic edges , while devoting her many energies to philanthropy . 
Then there was [PER Lyudmila Putina  ] , the least active publicly of all [ORG First Ladies  ] . 
[PER Putina  ] typically appeared at those events required by protocol and avoided making public statements . 
Over time , as rumors started over her health and the extramarital pursuits of her husband , she became increasingly remote , frumpy ( to a condescending [LOC Moscow  ] elite ) , and distant from public life . 
She even chose not to accompany her husband to [LOC Sochi  ] for his farewell meeting as president with President [PER Bush  ] . 
[PER Svetlana Medvedeva  ] as [ORG First Lady  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Svetlana Medvedeva  ] does not fit neatly into any of these roles . 
After graduating from the [ORG Leningrad Financial-Economic Institute  ] in 1987 , she worked for several years but gave up her job at the behest of her husband when their son was born in 1995 . 
Yet many have characterized her as the driving force both in the family and in [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] 's career . 
Sources close to the couple describe [PER Medvedeva  ] as charismatic , and as having opened up doors for her husband , then a non-important law school professor in the early 90 's when they lived in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] . 
Recently , she has worked almost exclusively on a variety of cultural and philanthropic initiatives and has a strong connection with the [MISC Russian  ] Orthodox Church ( [MISC ROC  ] ) . 
Some of her activities include the Festival of [MISC Russian  ] Art and the [ORG Council for the Spiritual-Moral Culture  ] of the Rising Generation of [LOC Russia  ] that was founded by [ORG Aleksey II  ] . 
Criticisms of [PER Medvedeva  ] ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Few have directly criticized [PER Medvedeva  ] in the media -- a taboo set by [PER Putin  ] as president -- most simply have noted her previous social habits . 
When the couple moved to [LOC Moscow  ] as [PER Medvedev  ] 's governmental career took off in the mid-1990 's , [PER Medvedeva  ] was known to frequent elite parties , fashion shows , and the circles of high society . 
Many have noted her penchant for high fashion , just like [PER Gorbacheva  ] , which is why the two are often compared . 
However , on becoming [ORG First Lady  ] , [PER Medvedeva  ] took a half-step back from public view , most likely once again at [PER Medvedev  ] 's behest . 
She and the [LOC Kremlin  ] seem cognizant of the attention that is being placed on her and are trying to find a balance between the reclusiveness of [PER Putina  ] and the perceived ostentatiousness of [PER Gorbacheva  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX attributed his inability to interview [PER Medvedeva  ] in person as " over cautiousness " by [PER Medvedev  ] 's handlers , fearful of inciting public opinion against an " overly ambitious " [LOC Kremlin  ] spouse. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most recently , [PER Medvedeva  ] took the national stage with planning for the new [MISC Russian  ] holiday , the " Day of Family , [PER Love  ] , and Fidelity . 
" [PER Medvedeva  ] was at the forefront of this project 's spiritual and moral realm because of her links with the [MISC ROC  ] . 
The holiday was celebrated on July 8 [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002306 002 OF 002 because , according to the Orthodox Church 's calendar , this is the holy day for the patron saints of families . 
According to a [MISC Russian  ] legend , a [LOC Ryazan  ] peasant 's daughter named Fevroniy cured a prince [PER Peter  ] from [LOC Murom  ] , who then married her against the wishes of his family . 
They lived a long and happy life together , died within hours of each other , and in 1547 , were canonized . 
While festivals have been held in [LOC Murom  ] on this date for centuries to celebrate the two saints , some political observers noted to us the irony of this childless couple being chosen to headline [LOC Russia  ] 's pro-family message . 
While discussing the holiday with the media , [PER Medvedeva  ] summed up her role in the initiative , saying " A woman should by her nature strive for humility . 
Her mission is to keep peace and love in the family . 
Of course , today 's couples are more inclined to a balanced relationship . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While there has been no direct criticism of [PER Medvedeva  ] and this recent family-based initiative , the government 's policies towards the demographic problem continue to be criticized for not effectively addressing the political , cultural , and economic causes of the problem . 
[PER Olga Vorobyeva  ] , chair of [ORG Social Statistics  ] and Demography at [ORG Russian State Social University  ] , said that initiatives addressing the demographic problem need a two-pronged approach , improving family-life values and the public mentality . 
She also cited housing problems and access to education as contributing factors . 
[PER Mikhail Nikolayev  ] , Deputy Speaker of the [ORG Federation Council  ] , said that the economic problems of families are not being adequately addressed by the government . 
[PER Nikolayev  ] also stressed the need for spiritual and moral education . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As president , [PER Medvedev  ] has said that he wants [MISC Russians  ] to be optimistic about their country 's future , and [PER Medvedeva  ] has carefully chosen to spearhead an issue that clearly conforms to his priorities . 
While she took an active role in planning the " Day of Family , [PER Love  ] , and Fidelity , " she has been careful not to attract too much attention to herself . 
Despite [PER Medvedeva  ] 's fascination with high fashion , she -- or her handlers -- has made an apparent conscious decision to avoid unflattering references to [PER Gorbacheva  ] ; instead she has chosen to chart her own path , publicly engaging in philanthropy and work with the [MISC ROC  ] , while purportedly exerting influence on [PER Medvedev  ] behind the scenes .
