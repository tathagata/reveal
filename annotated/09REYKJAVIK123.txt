( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament passed a resolution on July 16 to enable the government to start accession negotiations with the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) . 
The parliament approved the controversial legislation with a slightly larger majority than expected , and fulfills the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] 's number one campaign promise . 
The second reading of the resolution took almost a week and was at times tumultuous . 
The [ORG GOI  ] will very soon submit a formal application for [ORG EU  ] membership to [LOC Brussels  ] , after which the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] will refer the application to the [ORG EU  ] Commission . 
The process of negotiations could take up to three years . 
But before [LOC Iceland  ] joins the [ORG EU  ] , the final negotiated agreement must be approved in a national referendum , which is by no means certain at this date . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's parliament voted on July 16 to authorize the government to begin accession talks with the [ORG EU  ] . 
Members of parliament voted 33 to 27 in favor of an [ORG EU  ] application following a final round of debates that lasted for almost a week . 
The margin of victory was a bit larger than had been expected , with three MPs abstaining from the vote . 
Notably , one [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) Member of Parliament ( [ORG MP  ] ) voted in favor , and the [ORG IP  ] deputy chair abstained . 
Pundits had expected the [ORG IP  ] to present a unified opposition to the [ORG EU  ] resolution . 
The vote paves the way for an application to be sent to [LOC Brussels  ] later in July and gives PM [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] a major achievement - one which she has campaigned for vigorously since becoming PM in February . 
If the application is approved by [ORG EU  ] member states , [LOC Iceland  ] would put the question on actual [ORG EU  ] membership to voters in a referendum. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) When the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) and the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) formed a majority coalition government on May 10 , they announced in their policy statement that the Foreign Minister would submit a parliamentary resolution on [LOC Iceland  ] 's application for [ORG EU  ] membership in the first days of the new parliament , which convened for its summer session on May 15 . 
The [ORG SDA  ] had made [ORG EU  ] membership a key issue in their electoral campaign . 
The two parties agreed that if the resolution passed and accession negotiations would ensue , then the negotiated accession treaty would be put to a national referendum , possibly as early as 2010. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Soon after the Foreign Minister submitted the draft resolution in parliament , the [ORG IP  ] and the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) submitted a counterproposal on [ORG EU  ] membership , claiming that the government 's resolution presented insubstantial arguments in favor of membership . 
The [MISC IP-PP  ] resolution called for a more detailed explication of [LOC Iceland  ] 's most important interests in accession talks with the [ORG EU  ] , a road map on the arrangement of accession talks , and an explanation of what needs to be done to ratify an accession treaty . 
The parliamentary [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] discussed both resolutions and tried to merge them into one , which the parliament passed today . 
Later , the [ORG IP  ] proposed an amendment requiring a double referendum , ( i.e. , one on whether to start accession negotiations and one on the negotiated accession treaty ) , but this amendment was voted down today. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Today 's resolution had to pass two readings before the vote . 
The first reading continued for two days , but the second lasted for more than six . 
Speaking time was doubled by the Speaker of the Parliament to give everyone a chance to have their say . 
The second round of debate was chaotic , and often interrupted by the emergence of secret documents that the MPs said had to be reviewed before continuing the debate . 
When the [MISC Parliamentarians  ] took the floor , some MPs towed the party line , while others said they thought it was in [LOC Iceland  ] 's best interest to see what kind of an accession treaty could be negotiated . 
A few talked about the positive history and impact of the [ORG EU  ] , while some likened it to the [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
Several Althing members , especially from the [ORG Citizens' Movement  ] , tried to engage in horse trading by threatening not to support the resolution unless the government dropped its controversial [ORG Icesave  ] bill , which is also being debated in parliament . 
The media had a heyday speculating on how those MPs who had not yet made up their mind were going to vote. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The application for [ORG EU  ] accession will first go to the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] which will then refer the application to the [ORG EU  ] Commission , a process that will likely take up to six months . 
After that , the actual accession talks will commence and they can take up to three years . 
This time could be shortened because of [LOC Iceland  ] 's prior participation in many areas of the [ORG EU  ] through its membership in the [ORG European Economic Area  ] . 
Without a doubt , the most challenging subjects will be the fisheries sector and agriculture . 
As of now , [LOC Iceland  ] does not fulfill the Maastricht criteria for adopting the euro as its currency. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) Comment - This was a big victory for Prime Minister [PER Johanna REYKJAVIK  ] 00000123 002 OF 002 [PER Sigurdardottir  ] and her [ORG SDA  ] party - both have had difficult sledding over the last couple of weeks . 
The Prime Minister summed up the situation nicely in a radio interview immediately after the vote , " This is the result we were hoping for.. . 
It 's a great day for us . 
" [PER Sigurdardottir  ] 's enthusiasm may not be shared by a majority of Icelanders . 
Recent polls show that an accession treaty would be turned down in a national referendum if a vote were held today . 
Clearly , the economic situation in [LOC Iceland  ] in two to three years' time will have a major impact on the final decision . 
End Comment .
