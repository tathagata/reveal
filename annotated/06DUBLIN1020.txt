( C ) Summary: Although supportive of continued [LOC U.S.  ] military transits at [LOC Shannon Airport  ] , the [ORG Irish Government  ] has informally begun to place constraints on [LOC U.S.  ] operations at the facility , mainly in response to public sensitivities over [LOC U.S.  ] actions in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[ORG Shannon  ] remains a key transit point for [LOC U.S.  ] troops and materiel bound for theaters in the global war on terror , while yielding diplomatic benefits for the [ORG Irish Government  ] and significant revenues for the airport and regional economy . 
Segments of the [MISC Irish  ] public , however , see the airport as a symbol of [MISC Irish  ] complicity in perceived [LOC U.S.  ] wrongdoing in the [LOC Gulf/Middle East  ] and in regard to extraordinary renditions , a view that underpinned a recent jury decision to acquit the " [MISC Shannon Five  ] " protesters who damaged a [LOC U.S.  ] naval aircraft . 
The [ORG Irish Government  ] has repeatedly defended [LOC U.S.  ] interests in the face of public criticism , but has recently introduced more cumbersome notification requirements for equipment-related transits in the wake of the [LOC Lebanon  ] conflict . 
These requirements , which entail a more expansive interpretation of munitions of war , are designed to give the [ORG Irish Government  ] mor latitude to decide on allowable transits , accoring to a senior [ORG Department of Foreign Affairs  ] oficial . 
We suspect that the [ORG Government  ] aims with tese new constraints to dampen public criticism ahead of the 2007 general elections , and we would apreciate [ORG Department gudance  ] on a USG response , including on any next steps regarding the [MISC Shannon Five  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG Shannon: Significant Benefits and Sensitivities  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) [LOC U.S.  ] military access to [LOC Shannon Airport  ] in western [LOC Ireland  ] is among the most tangible benefits of traditionally strong [MISC U.S.-Irish  ] relations . 
For the [LOC United States  ] , geography makes [ORG Shannon  ] a key transit point for military flights and military contract flights carrying personnel and materiel to [LOC Iraq  ] and the [ORG Middle East/Gulf  ] theater in the global war on terror , as well as to [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
In 2005 , roughly 340,000 [LOC U.S.  ] troops passed through [LOC Shannon  ] on nearly 2,500 contract carrier flights ; about 450 equipment-related/distinguished-visitor transit milair flights and thousands of airspace overflights also took place . 
Approximately 220,000 troops have transited to date this year . 
For [LOC Ireland  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] military transits not only demonstrate bilateral cooperation in support of [LOC U.S.  ] objectives in the [LOC Gulf/Middle East  ] , but also generate significant revenue for [LOC Shannon Airport  ] and the regional economy . 
In 2005 , the airport turned a euro 2.9 million profit after earning roughly euro 10.3 million from services for transit flights , including landing , parking , catering , and fuel . 
The economic gains for the [LOC Shannon  ] area are less easily calculated , but would include , at a minimum , payments for hotels , food/beverages , transportation , and cultural activities that come with 8-10 overnight stops per year for roughly 200 soldiers each time . 
( Revenues may fall in 2006 , as [ORG World Airways  ] , a [MISC DOD-contract  ] carrier , has begun to transfer operations from [LOC Shannon  ] to its [LOC Leipzig  ] hub for internal logistical reasons . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) For segments of the [MISC Irish  ] public , however , the visibility of [LOC U.S.  ] troops at [LOC Shannon  ] has made the airport a symbol of [MISC Irish  ] complicity in perceived [LOC U.S.  ] wrongdoing in the [LOC Gulf/Middle East  ] . 
This popular sentiment was manifest in the July 25 jury decision to acquit the " [MISC Shannon Five  ] , " a group of anti-war protesters who damaged a [LOC U.S.  ] naval aircraft at the airport in 2003 in the belief that they would prevent loss of life in [LOC Iraq  ] ( ref A ) . 
Members of the [MISC Shannon Five  ] have subsequently called for a mass demonstration in [LOC Dublin  ] on September 23 ( capitalizing on publicity for the September 21-24 [MISC Ryder Cup  ] tournament and the return of university students ) as part of a campaign to " demilitarize " the airport . 
Although it is by no means clear that any protest will reach " mass " proportions , participation in the planned protest will likely draw from a vocal anti-war lobby that has demonstrated against [LOC U.S.  ] use of [MISC Shannon  ] from the start of the [LOC Iraq  ] War up through the recent [LOC Lebanon  ] conflict . 
[LOC DUBLIN  ] 00001020 002 OF 003 In late 2005/early 2006 , [MISC EU-wide  ] debate on extraordinary renditions similarly galvanized this lobby , and the [MISC Irish  ] public generally , to question [LOC U.S.  ] military access to the airport . 
The [ORG Irish Government  ] and [MISC Shannon  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Irish Government  ] consistently has acted to ensure continued [LOC U.S.  ] military transits at [LOC Shannon  ] in the face of public criticism . 
Since the [MISC Shannon Five  ] decision , for example , [MISC Irish  ] authorities have upgraded airport security , doubling the number of police and military personnel patrolling the facility and introducing rigorous checks at the parking lot and perimeter fence . 
( The upgrade is also partly a response to possible [MISC Islamic  ] extremist threats . 
) Moreover , despite a general [ORG Government  ] reluctance to challenge independent court decisions , Defense Minister [PER Willie O'Dea  ] and governing [ORG Fianna Fail  ] party politicians have publicly questioned the legal merits of the [MISC Shannon Five  ] jury decision . 
These public statements track with representations to the [ORG Irish Parliament  ] by [ORG Government  ] ministers over recent years and months in defense of [LOC U.S.  ] practices at [LOC Shannon  ] , including by Foreign Minister [PER Dermot Ahern  ] , who cited [LOC U.S.  ] assurances on renditions this past year to rebuff calls for random aircraft checks . 
In parliamentary debate this spring , Minister of State for [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Noel Treacy  ] , dismissed renewed calls for random inspections following the transit of a [LOC U.S.  ] military prisoner that occurred without prior notification to the [ORG Irish Government  ] ( ref B ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Notwithstanding its general support for [LOC U.S.  ] interests , the [ORG Irish Government  ] has more recently begun to place limits on certain forms of [LOC U.S.  ] transits at [LOC Shannon  ] . 
On August 15 , the [ORG Irish Department of Transport  ] informally advised Post by e-mail that all military equipment , including [MISC HMMWVs  ] and trucks , were to be considered " munitions of war , " requiring prior notification to the [ORG Transport Department  ] and exemption waivers for transshipment . 
In addition to diplomatic clearance requests for state aircraft , we have heretofore provided notification for troop transits ( with accompanying weapons ) , hazmat , and actual weapons/munitions , but not non-lethal military articles . 
The [ORG Transport Department  ] notice followed upon the [ORG Department of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG DFA  ] ) oral but definitive decision during the [LOC Lebanon  ] conflict to forbid [LOC U.S.  ] military transits carrying munitions to [LOC Israel  ] , a policy that [ORG DFA  ] did not convey to Post before informing the media . 
Indications of this trend to constrain [LOC U.S.  ] operations at [PER Shannon  ] first arose in the context of the extraordinary renditions issue . 
In late 2005 , for instance , the [ORG DFA  ] informally denied a [MISC DHS  ] deportation transit through [MISC Shannon  ] of convicted foreign nationals from the [LOC United States  ] out of apparent concern that the public would misread the transit as a rendition. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In an August 30 meeting with the [ORG DCM  ] and emboff , [ORG DFA Political  ] Director [PER Rory Montgomery  ] said that the [ORG Department of Transport  ] 's more encompassing approach to munitions of war and notification requirements reflected the [MISC Irish  ] [ORG Government  ] 's interest in knowing the full scope of military materiel transiting [LOC Ireland  ] . 
He recalled that the February shipment through [PER Shannon  ] of [LOC U.S.  ] Apache helicopters to/from [LOC Israel  ] , which the [LOC U.S.  ] contract carrier had not listed as munitions of war , elicited parliamentary criticism and highlighted the need for clarity about the nature of materiel in transit ( ref C ) . 
More expansive notification requirements that would apply to all countries would " make it easier " for the [ORG Irish Government  ] to decide on allowable shipments , while remaining predisposed to respond quickly and positively to [LOC U.S.  ] transit requests , said [PER Montgomery  ] . 
He added that the [ORG DFA  ] would recommend that the [ORG Department of Transport  ] consult with Post in the process of clarifying and publishing guidance on munitions of war . 
The [ORG DCM  ] noted Post 's intention to confer with the [ORG Transport Department  ] , and he emphasized that broader notification requirements would make it more cumbersome to process materiel shipments , with the possibility that [LOC U.S.  ] military planners would consider alternatives to [PER Shannon  ] as a transit hub . 
Comment and Action Request -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [MISC Irish  ] sensitivities generally about foreign military usage of the airport often make any inadvertent [LOC DUBLIN  ] 00001020 003 OF 003 breaches of [LOC Ireland  ] 's restrictive rules on foreign military transits more visible and problematic . 
A neutral country , [LOC Ireland  ] has no military attache system , no SOFA for [LOC U.S.  ] activities , and strict rules regarding weapons transits and the wearing of foreign military uniforms . 
Occasional and inadvertent breaches of weapons and uniform policies , like " failure " to notify transiting prisoners ( ref B ) and military equipment , are met with public and press scrutiny , but also with Government understanding . 
Any incident , however , that becomes the cause for a public debate about the [LOC U.S.  ] use of [PER Shannon  ] will likely add pressure on the Government . 
Embassy has sought to manage the policy issues , notification requirements , and the coordination of transiting flights , overflights , refuelings , crew rest overnights , and equipment failure overnights with existing [ORG DAO  ] and civilian Embassy resources on the ground . 
With the help of extra TDY support to the [ORG DAO  ] office and a TDY EUCOM presence at [LOC Shannon airport  ] ( which is three-and-a-half hours from [LOC Dublin  ] ) , we have managed the occasional problems adequately and well. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) More comment: We intend to engage other ranking [ORG DFA  ] , [ORG Transport  ] , and [ORG Irish Defense Department  ] officials , upon their return from the August holiday period , on the reasons for new constraints at [LOC Shannon  ] , particularly the novel interpretation of munitions of war and its application to other countries ( [MISC Russian  ] transits to [LOC Venezuela  ] , for instance ) . 
The [MISC Irish  ] public 's overwhelming opposition to [MISC Israeli  ] military actions in [LOC Lebanon  ] has exacerbated the governing [ORG Fianna Fail  ] party 's sensitivity to public criticism ahead of [LOC Ireland  ] 's May 2007 general elections . 
The major opposition party , [LOC Fine Gael  ] , supports continued [LOC U.S.  ] military use of [LOC Shannon  ] , but the [ORG Labour Party  ] and the [ORG Green Party  ] , [LOC Fine Gael  ] 's opposition partners , favor a review , if not reversal , of [MISC Irish  ] policy on [LOC U.S.  ] transits . 
Against this political backdrop , [LOC U.S.  ] missteps at [LOC Shannon  ] could easily become campaign grist , a [ORG Fianna Fail  ] concern that mid-level [ORG DFA  ] officials have cited in informal discussions with Post . 
Compliance with the new rules ( entailing notification for almost any [LOC U.S.  ] military equipment transiting ) , if feasible from the [LOC U.S.  ] logistical perspective , will require a higher order of coordination among [LOC TRANSCOM  ] , [ORG Air Mobility Command  ] , [ORG TACC  ] , and the contract carriers. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Action request: We would appreciate input from the [ORG Department and  ] other [ORG USG  ] agencies for our planned follow-on discussions with [MISC Irish  ] officials on [LOC Shannon  ] . 
Embassy will diplomatically pursue the most workable arrangements possible with [MISC Irish  ] officials , but we would appreciate [LOC Washington  ] 's judgment as to whether the process of notification of almost everything of a military nature ( including by contract carriers ) through [PER Shannon  ] is becoming too difficult to make the airport a preferred transit stop . 
Guidance is also requested regarding the [MISC Shannon Five  ] decision , an outcome that [ORG DFA Political  ] Director [PER Montgomery  ] described as " bizarre " and presumably not precedential . 
Our understanding is that the case , as a criminal matter , has run its course , as there is no possibility to appeal a jury decision under [MISC Irish  ] law . 
There may be an option to pursue the case as a civil matter , and Post would need authorization and funding to contact local attorneys about this possibility . 
Another option would be to present an itemized bill for aircraft damages to the [MISC Irish  ] Government , either to seek compensation outright or , at least , to convey [ORG USG  ] dissatisfaction with the [ORG Shannon Five  ] verdict .
