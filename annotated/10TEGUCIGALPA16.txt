The timing of the charges is interesting since it occurred just days before the [ORG National Congress  ] is likely to begin consideration of a decree granting political amnesty to all actors involved in the events of June 28 . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [ORG Public Ministry  ] , which prosecutes criminal cases , filed charges of abuse of authority on January 6 against the [ORG Armed Forces' Chief  ] of [ORG Staff  ] and the [ORG Joint Staff  ] . 
The case was filed against six individuals: Chief of [ORG Staff General Romeo Orlando Vasquez Velasquez  ] , [PER Venancio Cervantes Suazo  ] , [PER Carlos Antonio Cuellar Castillo  ] , [PER Luis Javier Prince Suazo  ] , [PER Miguel Angel Garcia Padget  ] , and [PER Juan Pablo Rodriguez Rodriguez  ] . 
According to press reports , the charge is that they abused their authority when on June 28 they executed the arrest warrant issued by the [ORG Supreme Court  ] against President [PER Jose Manuel  ] " [PER Mel  ] " [PER Zelaya  ] by forcing him onto a plane and flying him to [LOC Costa Rica  ] rather than arresting him and allowing him to defend himself of the charges against him in a [MISC Honduran  ] court of law . 
The case was filed by the Attorney General with the [ORG Supreme Court  ] since [ORG Article  ] 313 of the [MISC Constitution  ] provides that the [ORG Supreme Court  ] has jurisdiction in cases involving high-level government officials . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] in turn designated its Chief Magistrate and President [PER Alberto Aviles Rivera  ] to oversee the case. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The timing of the charges has raised speculation about the motive . 
However , Attorney General [PER Rubi  ] has long been critical of the military 's decision to abort his legal case against President [PER Zelaya  ] in essence by kidnapping [PER Zelaya  ] from his home and flying him out on a plane to [LOC Costa Rica  ] . 
Some say the case was ready weeks ago , but was postponed until after the November 29 general election in order to prevent any action that might negatively impact on a smooth electoral process . 
The case was filed days before the [ORG National Congress  ] is likely to consider the issue of political amnesty for all actors in the June 28 coup . 
The congressional commission drafting a decree on political amnesty has reportedly completed its work and the draft decree is finalized and ready for consideration by the [ORG National Congress  ] as early as the week of January 11 . 
Some say that the [ORG Public Ministry  ] filed the charges to ensure that the military leadership faces justice despite any political amnesty approved by the legislature . 
However , it is important to note that the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , which will hear the case , played an important role in league with the military in the coup de'tat of June 28. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On January 7 , General [PER Vasquez  ] to the Ambassador that he and his colleagues had hired a law firm to defend their interests . 
[PER Vasquez  ] also said that the military would respect the authority of the [ORG Public Ministry  ] . 
However , he expressed the hope that [ORG Congress  ] would pass political amnesty legislation that covered all of the key actors associated with the [MISC Honduran  ] political crisis and the coup .
