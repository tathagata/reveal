( C ) Although the [PER Morales  ] government states it wants good relations with the [LOC United States  ] , officials often use anti-U.S. rhetoric to distract from domestic problems , as when the [MISC Bolivian  ] government recently groundlessly accused the [LOC United States  ] of financing opposition groups . 
The key areas of concern in [LOC Bolivia  ] currently are democracy , narcotics , and protection for [LOC U.S.  ] investments . 
While [PER Garcia Linera  ] is generally seen as one of the more reasonable members of the [MISC Bolivian  ] government , and often acts as moderator for radical elements of the ruling [MISC Movement Toward Socialism  ] ( [ORG MAS  ] ) party , he has been aggressive in questioning the role and purpose of [LOC U.S.  ] aid and [LOC U.S.  ] anti-narcotics policies . 
The VP will likely push for [ORG ATPDEA  ] extension and seek [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] funding .

( C ) It has become the norm for the [PER Morales  ] government to launch verbal attacks against " [MISC American  ] imperialism " in times of domestic difficulties in order to deflect public attention . 
On multiple occasions , President [PER Morales  ] has also accused the [LOC U.S.  ] government of attempted " terrorism " , suggesting that an Amcit who bombed a [MISC Bolivian  ] hostel in 2006 was acting on USG orders . 
President [PER Morales  ] cited this supposed act of terrorism as an excuse for proposing visa requirements for [LOC U.S.  ] visitors , expected to enter into force in December . 
Concerned about a recent increase in vitriolic rhetoric , Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] reviewed the [ORG U.S.- Bolivia  ] bilateral relationship with Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] August 20 and noted recent pronouncements and actions on the part of the [MISC Bolivian  ] government that strain bilateral ties . 
The Vice President promised to look into the issues of concern and asked that the Ambassador not allow the forces that seek to distance [LOC Bolivia  ] from the [LOC U.S.  ] to prevail , emphasizing that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government is committed to improving relations ( ref b ) . 
However , not even a week later , [PER Garcia Linera  ] came out publicly accusing the [LOC U.S.  ] government of funding opposition groups in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
We called on Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs [PER Hugo Fernandez  ] on August 28 to protest these baseless accusations . 
Despite our protest , the [MISC Bolivian  ] government a day later ( August 29 ) stepped up their anti-U.S. aid rhetoric. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) With no warning , Minister of the [ORG Presidency Quintana  ] gave a lengthy presentation on state-run television accusing [ORG USAID  ] of supporting the opposition and providing what he described as evidence in support of [PER Morales  ] 's and [PER Garcia Linera  ] 's previous accusations . 
Using [ORG USAID  ] 's democracy program as an example , [PER Quintana  ] claimed that only 30 percent of the funding could be accounted for and said that the other 70 percent is programmed unilaterally . 
[PER Quintana  ] listed grants and subcontracts which have been given to [MISC Bolivian  ] organizations , highlighting organization managers who worked in previous governments as an example of the USG funding supporters of the " old way " and those against the [ORG MAS  ] program of change . 
[PER Quintana  ] praised foreign aid from other countries , stating that other countries follow [MISC Bolivian  ] laws . 
In a particularly ugly insinuation , [PER Quintana  ] called on [ORG USAID  ] 's [MISC Bolivian  ] employees to " remain loyal " and " not be traitors . 
" We would find it useful if the Deputy Secretary could repeat to [PER Garcia Linera  ] our concerns about the potential damage to the bilateral relationship if such baseless anti-U.S. attacks persist. - - - - - - - - - - Democracy in Danger - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Strengthening and supporting democracy in [LOC Bolivia  ] is our mission 's primary concern . 
Although the ruling [ORG MAS  ] party and President [PER Evo Morales  ] were elected with a clear majority in fair and open elections , their actions since assuming power have often displayed anti-democratic tendencies . 
President [PER Morales  ] is currently attempting to discredit and weaken the judicial branch of government . 
Specifically , the [MISC MAS-controlled  ] lower house of [ORG Congress  ] has sent an impeachment case against four of the five judges of the [ORG Constitutional Tribunal  ] ( the court which considers questions of constitutionality , separate from the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , which is the court of final appeal . 
) The vote on the impeachment case was a striking example of how the [ORG MAS  ] has begun to manipulate regulations in order to push the [ORG MAS  ] agenda: after fighting broke out in the [ORG Congress  ] , the [ORG MAS  ] head of the lower house convened only the [ORG MAS  ] congressmen in the offices of the Vice President , where they voted by " majority of those present " ( that is , only the [ORG MAS  ] ) to impeach the four judges . 
The [ORG MAS  ] 's aggressive actions in the [ORG Constituent Assembly  ] , which is currently attempting to draft [LOC Bolivia  ] 's new constitution , also provide an example of the [ORG MAS  ] 's growing disregard for the democratic process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During a recent visit by [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , President [PER Evo Morales  ] went so far as to declare his intention to rule by decree if laws got in his way . 
In a number of areas , [PER Evo  ] seems to be following in [PER Chavez  ] 's footsteps ( for example , the recently-published draft constitution , written by the [ORG MAS  ] and [PER Evo  ] 's [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] advisors , would allow indefinite reelection for the President and Vice President . 
) [MISC Venezuelan  ] funding is pouring into the country with no transparency or accountability , further damaging the democratic process . 
In fact , [PER La Razon  ] ( [LOC Bolivia  ] 's paper-of-record ) , recently called into question [MISC Venezuelan  ] assistance. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [PER Narcotics: Room  ] for Further Cooperation ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Counter-narcotics programs represent a chance for the [MISC Bolivian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] governments to work together , but again [MISC Bolivian  ] government rhetoric has made the task more difficult . 
President [PER Evo Morales  ] , who is the head of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's 'cocalero' coca-growing union , is a staunch supporter of coca leaf cultivation , and he publicly emphasizes a distinction between coca leaf and cocaine . 
In reality , the line between the two is far from clear: interdiction has increased under [PER Evo  ] 's tenure , but so have coca production and cocaine exports . 
The [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's policies regarding coca are often incoherent , with one ministry challenging or annulling the actions of another ministry . 
Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] was called to a meeting with Vice Foreign Minister [PER Hugo Fernandez  ] on August 22 to discuss his public comments voicing [LOC U.S.  ] concerns over the rise of coca cultivation and drug trafficking . 
The Ambassador explained that his comments reflected concerns shared by [MISC Bolivian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] drug enforcement authorities , supported by the latest [ORG United Nations  ] figures . 
[PER Evo  ] 's administration 's reaction to the Ambassador 's statements suggests that the comments struck a raw nerve . 
[PER Evo  ] is having difficulties making the case that coca cultivation is separate from cocaine production and does not want to be seen as tolerating an increase in drug trafficking. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Bolivian  ] government , however , may be starting to realize that drugs represent a growing problem domestically and therefore may become more open to greater counternarcotics cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Following a persistent effort by the Ambassador to push for a net reduction in coca cultivation , the [MISC Bolivian  ] government announced August 28 that it is working on an " [ORG Action Plan  ] " to implement the government 's strategy to reduce coca cultivation to 20,000 hectares , down from the estimated 27,500 hectares currently being cultivated ( according to [ORG UNODC  ] 's 2006 estimate ) . 
The government has plans to go even further and bring down coca cultivation to 16,000 hectares ( by an unspecified date ) . 
While we reject the government 's ongoing effort to bring " legal' cultivation to 20,000 hectares and would clearly want the government to produce a more substantial net reduction , 20,000 hectares would represent the average of what has been grown annually in [LOC Bolivia  ] over the past decade , including during the past administrations . 
There may be an opportunity here for us to start a process which will achieve net reduction . 
The Vice President has discussed with the Ambassador the possibility of working out a bilateral agreement to achieve net coca reduction ; it would be useful if the Deputy Secretary could refer to this idea and urge [PER Garcia Linera  ] to follow-up. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [LOC U.S.  ] Investments Threatened - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG MAS  ] 's draft constitution made public on August 14 includes an article that specifies that international investors would only enjoy the benefits of [MISC Bolivian  ] law and could not invoke external agreements or , by implication , international arbitration . 
A number of [PER Evo  ] 's recent actions and statements have been seen as anti-investment by the industries affected: to give only a few examples , the forced renegotiation of petroleum contracts , the nationalization of [ORG Glencore  ] 's [LOC Vinto  ] smelter , [PER Evo  ] 's stated intention to create a state energy and electricity company , the [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's desire to repatriate a controlling share in [ORG Entel  ] the [MISC Italian-owned  ] telephone company , and [PER Morales  ] 's claims that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government now controls twenty percent of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's economy and should be involved in more. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) One [LOC U.S.  ] investment which is vulnerable is [LOC San Cristobal  ] mine , which is 65 percent owned by [ORG Apex Silver  ] . 
[ORG San Cristobal  ] would be particularly hard-hit by a bill currently in [ORG Congress  ] , which would increase mining taxes . 
Although the [MISC Bolivian  ] government claims to want a fifty-fifty split of profits , the proposed tax increases actually result in , on average , a 60 percent government take of profits . 
Because [ORG Apex  ] hedged on metal prices in order to obtain financing , in aggregate proposed tax increases pose a serious threat to [LOC San Cristobal  ] mine . 
When hedge costs are factored in to the overall cost structure , [ORG Apex  ] estimates that the proposed tax regime will yield the GOB a 93 percent effective tax rate . 
If refunds on import taxes are eliminated for mines that produce concentrate instead of metal , as has been proposed by the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , the government 's take would be more than 100 percent of [LOC San Cristobal  ] 's profits . 
In his August 20 meeting with Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] , the Ambassador noted that given the [MISC USD  ] 900 million investment in [LOC San Cristobal  ] mine , he hoped that the Vice President would grant [ORG Apex Silver  ] the opportunity to present its concerns about the government 's planned tax increase directly to him . 
Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] agreed to look into the matter and promised to hear out [ORG Apex Silver  ] 's concerns once he had a potential way forward. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Still Interested in [ORG ATPDEA  ] and MCA - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Linera  ] will likely push for extension of [ORG ATPDEA  ] during your meeting . 
[ORG ATPDEA  ] is crucial to a certain segment of the [MISC Bolivian  ] economy , particularly specialty textile goods ( note: USAID has provided support to a number of small companies which , without [ORG ATPDEA  ] , would likely go bankrupt . 
) President [PER Morales  ] has made numerous statements that [ORG ATPDEA  ] should not be extended by increments but should be formalized to give [LOC Bolivia  ] permanent beneficial trade access to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Morales  ] has also stated that [ORG ATPDEA  ] is not a [LOC U.S  ] . 
" handout " but instead is [LOC Bolivia  ] 's due for its help in counternarcotics efforts. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] is likely to push for extension of [ORG ATPDEA  ] or mention a potential long-term bilateral " trade agreement " that [MISC Bolivian  ] officials have yet to define . 
We also understand that [PER Garcia Linera  ] will visit with the [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation  ] to try to accelerate efforts to negotiate a compact. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Being Firm while Keeping the Relationship on Track - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Goldberg  ] has made clear our desire for good relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
In return , Vice President [PER Garcia Linera  ] has stressed that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government also wants better relations with the [LOC United States  ] and has pleaded with us not to " surrender to the forces that want to distance our countries " and to continue to work to try to find areas of cooperation but has done little to tone down his president 's or even his own anti-U.S. rhetoric. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia Linera  ] needs to hear our concerns about [MISC Bolivian  ] democracy , the eroding investment climate , as well as our desire to continue and even expand counter-drug efforts . 
We also have to continue to urge the [PER Morales  ] government to temper its rhetoric if it is indeed interested in improved bilateral ties . 
That said , we are not optimistic that the [LOC United States  ] will be able to improve its relationship with [LOC Bolivia  ] in the short term , given [PER Morales  ] 's paranoia and [PER Chavez  ] 's continuing influence here .
