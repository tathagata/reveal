Danilovich  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) , ( C ) and ( D ) . 
1 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Ambassador hosted General [PER Jorge Armando Felix  ] , Minister for [ORG Institutional Security  ] , for lunch at the residence on 4 May 2005 . 
While General [PER Felix  ] has much less influence than his predecessor from the previous government , he is still the country 's most senior intelligence official and the rough equivalent of national security advisor to the president . 
In addition to his own staff at the [ORG Ministry for Institutional Security  ] ( [ORG GSI  ] ) , which contains representatives from the various [MISC Brazilian  ] Government security and foreign relations agencies , General [PER Felix  ] is also responsible for overseeing the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG National Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG ABIN  ] ) . 
2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Tri-Border Region:  ] The Ambassador asked General [PER Felix  ] for an assessment of the transnational crime situation in the tri-border region of [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
General [PER Felix  ] admitted that there were serious problems in the region and that the illegal movement of arms , money , drugs and the like through the region was of concern to the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government . 
[PER Felix  ] said that both [ORG ABIN  ] and the [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] ( [ORG DPF  ] ) were devoting additional personnel and resources to the problem and noted that [ORG ABIN  ] even had some joint programs with [ORG RMAS  ] that were focused on these issues . 
3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Counterterrorism: This led to a discussion on terrorism issues/operations in the tri-border region and throughout [LOC Brazil  ] . 
General [PER Felix  ] said that [ORG ABIN  ] worked closely with [ORG RMAS  ] in jointly targeting individuals of interest , and the Ambassador expressed his appreciation for this assistance . 
General [PER Felix  ] said that in addition to the joint operations that we were working together , the [MISC Brazilian  ] government was also appealing to moderate , second generation [MISC Arabs  ] , many of whom were successful businessmen in [LOC Brazil  ] , to keep a close eye on fellow [MISC Arabs  ] who may be influenced by [MISC Arab  ] extremists and/or terrorist groups . 
General [PER Felix  ] said that it was in the interest of these moderate , [MISC Arabs  ] to keep potential firebrands in line and keep the microscope off of the [MISC Arab  ] community in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
General [PER Felix  ] said that the recently murdered former prime minister of [LOC Lebanon  ] sent that same message to the [MISC Arab  ] community in [LOC Brazil  ] during a visit a few years back . 
General [PER Felix  ] said that it was important that counterterrorism operations were packaged properly so as not to negatively reflect on the proud and successful [MISC Arab  ] community in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [MISC Venezuela: Following  ] the [LOC CT  ] discussion , the Ambassador raised [LOC Venezuela  ] and its president [PER Hugo Chavez  ] and noted that [PER Chavez  ] was disrupting [LOC Brazil  ] 's efforts to play a leading role politically and economically in [LOC South America  ] . 
General [PER Felix  ] nodded his head and appeared to be very carefully measuring his response . 
He then said that he had his own personal opinions about [PER Chavez  ] ( which he did not share ) that were different from the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government ? s position . 
That being said , General [PER Felix  ] said that he preferred keeping in line with the official position ( though he did not elaborate on it either ) . 
[PER Felix  ] noted that whether one was pro- or anti-Chavez , he had become very much a part of the " [MISC Latin American  ] " reality . 
5 . 
( S ) Additional Assistance: The Ambassador asked General [PER Felix  ] if there were any areas where the [ORG USG  ] could better assist the [ORG GSI  ] and/or [ORG ABIN  ] . 
[PER Felix  ] said that he was very happy with the assistance currently being provided by the [ORG USG  ] . 
One area where he claimed that the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government was falling behind was in protecting its own classified and unclassified computer systems . 
[PER Felix  ] said that he would welcome any assistance ( courses , visitors , etc . 
) in this area . 
[PER Felix  ] also said that he was trying to beef up the [ORG GSI  ] and [ORG ABIN  ] 's SIGINT capabilities and could always use some assistance along those lines . 
6 . 
( S ) Embassy Comment: General [PER Felix  ] is an amiable , low- key individual . 
He does not appear overly ambitious and admitted that he preferred traveling for the sake of pleasure as opposed to business . 
He is not someone who will make waves , and this likely contributed to his walking carefully through the [LOC Venezuela  ] discussion . 
The above being said , General [PER Felix  ] has always been a straightforward interlocutor , and his term at [ORG GSI  ] has been highlighted by very cooperative , joint [LOC CT  ] operations between [ORG RMAS  ] and [ORG ABIN  ] . 
All in all , his continued presence at [ORG GSI  ] bodes well for [LOC U.S.  ] interests .
