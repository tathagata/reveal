[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Ambassador contacted Permanent Secretary of State at the [ORG Icelandic Ministry  ] for [ORG Foreign Affairs Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] on 28 February to query the failure to make good the FM 's pledge that [LOC Iceland  ] would recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] on February 22 ( reftel ) . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] pointed to the Foreign Minister 's statement after meeting UN Secretary General Ban in [LOC New York  ] on February 26 , in which she said SIPDIS that [LOC Iceland  ] intends to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence but a final government decision on timing has not yet been made . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] said that the MFA is releasing a press statement February 28 stating the same point . 
Although pressed hard on timing for the official recognition , he would only repeat " soon , " noting obliquely that there were " differences in the government " about the best time to announce . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] said he had been in contact with the PermSecs for the other [MISC Nordics  ] , and said that [LOC Iceland  ] would not be the last of the [MISC Nordics  ] to announce. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Though  ] no government source has directly raised this angle , we think it likely that the " differences within the government " reflect concerns that [LOC Iceland  ] 's bid for a [ORG UNSC  ] seat in 2009-10 will be jeopardized if [LOC Kosovo  ] recognition greatly irritates the [MISC Russians  ] , and the vagueness of " soon " and " won't be the last " reflects the scramble to arrive at some announcement date which the [MISC Icelanders  ] somehow hope will least irritate the [MISC Russians  ] while not overly irritating the [LOC U.S.  ] and the other [ORG Perm  ] 5 supporters of independence. van Voorst</pre></code>
