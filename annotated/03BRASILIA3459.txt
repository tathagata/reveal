Summary . 
Widespread reporting in [LOC Brazil  ] on the outcome of the [ORG FTAA  ] [ORG TNC  ] meeting in [LOC Trinidad  ] & [LOC Tobago  ] ( [LOC T&T  ] ) unleashed a hail of criticism directed at [ORG Itamaraty  ] , both on the substance of its [ORG FTAA  ] policy and its conduct in [LOC T&T  ] . 
By the end of the [ORG TNC  ] meeting , [MISC Brazilian  ] dailies were reporting that [LOC Brazil  ] , along with [LOC Argentina  ] , were isolated re their insistence on a draft [ORG FTAA Ministerial Declaration  ] based along the line of [LOC Mercosul  ] 's 3-track proposal . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's struggle during the [ORG TNC  ] to keep [LOC Uruguay  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] in the [LOC Mercosul  ] fold was viewed as particularly damaging . 
Minister of [ORG Agiculture Rodrigues  ] and Minister of Development [PER Furlan  ] joined the fray publicly charging that [ORG Itamaraty  ] had not vetted the proposal it made in [LOC T&T  ] with [LOC CAMEX  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's high-level trade decision-making body , and claiming that [ORG Itamaraty  ] intransigence is threatening the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
President [PER Lula  ] convened a lunch meeting with Ministers on October 8 in which he ordered Ministers to cease and desist the public squabble . 
Chief of [PER Staff Dirceu  ] stated publicly that President [PER Lula  ] will more actively follow the negotiations and that the proposal presented in [LOC Trinidad  ] and [LOC Tobago  ] was " not the last word . 
" Post held meetings with President [PER Lula  ] 's Chief of [LOC Staff  ] , and interlocutors in the Agriculture and [ORG Finance Ministries  ] to explore possible implications of the internal dissent on the government 's [ORG FTAA  ] policy . 
Despite widespread frustration with [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's direction and stranglehold on [ORG FTAA  ] policymaking , it is unlikely that a sufficient challenge will be mounted that could change GOB policy before the [ORG FTAA Ministerial  ] in [LOC Miami  ] at the end of November . 
End Summary . 
Casa Civil ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Chief of [MISC Staff  ] [PER Jose Dirceu  ] conveyed to Ambassador during a lunch meeting on October 10 that President [PER Lula  ] wants an [ORG FTAA  ] agreement and that [PER Lula  ] had instructed Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] to work with USTR [PER Zoellick  ] to that end when ( if ) they meet in late October . 
[PER Dirceu  ] commented that Minister [PER Amorim  ] 's position within the government is very strong given [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's foreign policy successes over the past six months , but also stressed that President [PER Lula  ] sets policy and [ORG Itamaraty  ] is charged with carrying it out . 
[PER Dirceu  ] said that he personally would be following the [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations more closely , and planned to speak directly with Ministers [ORG Rodrigues  ] and [PER Furlan  ] to better understand their concerns . 
On substance , he asked how the [ORG USG  ] could expect [LOC Brazil  ] to include sensitive issues such as IPR , services , investment and government procurement in the negotiations when it will not discuss agriculture . 
Ambassador noted that domestic support is only one aspect of agriculture and that we are actively negotiating a variety of agricultural issues , including market access . 
[PER Dirceu  ] expressed skepticism that the [LOC US  ] would be very forthcoming in an election year . 
Agriculture Ministry ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
On October 8 , econoff met with [PER Paulo Venturelli  ] , the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] 's representative at the [LOC Trinidad  ] & [LOC Tobago  ] [ORG TNC  ] meeting and General Coordinator of the Agriculture [LOC Policy Secretariat  ] in the [ORG Department of Agricultural Economy  ] to explore [ORG AGMIN  ] views following the [ORG TNC  ] , and to gain a better understanding of [ORG AGMIN  ] 's position following Minister [LOC Rodrigues'  ] public criticism of [ORG Itamaraty  ] . 
In a conversation with econoff in [LOC T&T  ] , [PER Venturelli  ] had commented that the [ORG Itamaraty  ] negotiators were " paranoid ; " he was no less frank in the October 8 meeting , claiming that [ORG Itamaraty  ] has been lying to President [PER Lula  ] regarding the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
Clearly frustrated , [PER Venturelli  ] asserted that [ORG Itamaraty  ] does not want to negotiate in any forum , [ORG FTAA  ] or [ORG WTO  ] , noting the collapse of talks in [LOC Cancun.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[PER Venturelli  ] said that top level officials of [ORG Itamaraty  ] are formulating policy based totally of 1960 's [MISC North-South  ] ideology and without real economic consideration . 
Continuing to vent , he claimed that agriculture was not the central concern underlying [ORG Itamaraty  ] trade policy , but rather was being used to shield their real interest , which is to avoid negotiation of rules in services , investment , IPR and government procurement . 
As if the substance of the position is not bad enough , [PER Venturelli  ] complained that [ORG Itamaraty  ] had not vetted the [LOC Mercosul  ] proposal for a ministerial declaration presented in [LOC T&T  ] with any of the other [LOC Ministries.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
On domestic support , he said [ORG AGMIN  ] understands the [LOC US  ] position and wants to approach the issue from the standpoint of addressing the effects of domestic support within the hemisphere ; according to him , it is not necessary to negotiate disciplines in the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
He said [ORG AGMIN  ] had developed some proposals along this line , but [ORG Itamaraty  ] has not tabled them . 
He also said [ORG AGMIN  ] doesn't have a problem with the [LOC US  ] differentiated offer , which " represents more or less the relative access that exists today . 
" According to [PER Venturelli  ] , [ORG AGMIN  ] is anxious to work on a more specific level , toward negotiation of better access for products of particular interest . 
6 . 
[PER Venturelli  ] noted that [ORG CNA  ] , the [ORG National Agriculture Confederation  ] , is opposed to [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's approach . 
He also claimed that [LOC Argentina  ] is not staunchly in the [LOC Brazil  ] camp . 
According to [PER Venturelli  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] had produced a proposal for the ministerial declaration that was much " softer " than the eventual [LOC Mercosul  ] proposal presented in [LOC T&T  ] , prompting [ORG Itamaraty  ] Secretary General , [PER Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , to go to [LOC Buenos Aires  ] a week and half before [LOC T&T  ] . 
He also insinuated that [MISC Argentine  ] Vice Minister [PER Martin Redrado  ] departed from [LOC T&T  ] early to distance himself from the [MISC Brazilian  ] position. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
On 4 1 negotiations , [PER Venturelli  ] said [PER Amorim  ] continues to claim that USTR [PER Zoellick  ] agreed to approach these bilaterally . 
[PER Venturelli  ] was present during the [MISC Mercosul-US  ] bilateral in [LOC T&T  ] and insists that despite the clear communication from the [LOC US  ] regarding the need to keep any discussion within the [ORG FTAA  ] , [ORG Itamaraty  ] keeps trying to make it into something else. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
[PER Venturelli  ] was pessimistic about a successful outcome in [LOC Miami  ] . 
He suggested the [ORG USG  ] adopt a hardline with the [ORG GOB  ] , going so far as to tell [LOC Brazil  ] to take the [ORG FTAA  ] as is , or be left behind as the [LOC US  ] and the other countries proceed to form the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
His view is that this shock may be necessary before the government will admit that [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's policy is a failed policy . 
( Comment: It is doubtful that Minister [PER Rodrigues  ] would agree with this prescription , but its mere suggestion illustrates the intensity of frustration currently within [ORG AGMIN  ] over the [ORG GOB  ] 's [ORG FTAA  ] policy . 
) [PER Venturelli  ] also advised against allowing [ORG Itamaraty  ] to define the language of the debate . 
His example was [ORG Itamaraty  ] asserting that " the [LOC U.S.  ] won't negotiate agriculture . 
" He said that [LOC U.S.  ] should say it is willing to negotiate everything -- even domestic support , his point being that there are many ways to negotiate an issue ; it doesn't have to be through disciplines . 
He also suggested increasing pressure on [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[ORG Finance Ministry  ] -------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
On October 10 , [MISC Ecouns  ] and Econoff met with [PER Arno Meyer  ] , Deputy Secretary for [LOC International Affairs  ] in the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] and the [ORG Ministry  ] 's representative to the T&T [ORG TNC  ] meeting . 
[PER Meyer  ] provided a frank and thoughtful analysis of the current state of play in the [ORG GOB  ] on the [ORG FTAA  ] and suggestions of how the [ORG USG  ] could strengthen pro-FTAA forces within the government . 
He explained that while the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] wants the [ORG FTAA  ] because of the economic benefits associated with trade liberalization , [ORG Itamaraty  ] has responsibility for trade policy . 
Other Ministries have an opportunity to interject their opinions , but he identified four perceptions that [ORG Itamaraty  ] uses to justify its policy and that the other ministers find difficult to challenge . 
Given this , the other ministers have not been able to effectively insert their constituency 's economic interests into the policy debate. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
The four perceptions he identified are: 1 ) The [LOC U.S.  ] won't negotiate agriculture . 
Unlike [PER Venturelli  ] 's view , [PER Arno  ] said that agriculture is the key issue for the [ORG GOB  ] , and the unwillingness of the [LOC U.S.  ] to negotiate domestic support in the [ORG FTAA  ] provides the main justification for [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's approach of removing other issues from the negotiation . 
While he understands the [LOC US  ] argument about the best forum in which to negotiate disciplines , if there was some way that the [LOC U.S.  ] could deal with the effects of domestic support in the region , [PER Arno  ] said this would significantly undercut one of [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's main arguments against the [LOC US  ] position . 
2 ) The [LOC U.S.  ] won't negotiate antidumping rules . 
He said the [LOC US  ] is vulnerable when it says " everything is on the table . 
" [PER Arno  ] cited [ORG Treasury Secretary Snow  ] reiterating this when he traveled to [LOC Brazil  ] a number of months ago . 
3 ) The [LOC U.S.  ] position regarding agricultural liberalization/reform has changed as a result of election year politics . 
Echoing a point [MISC Dirceu  ] raised with Ambassador , [PER Arno  ] said that [ORG Itamaraty  ] has portrayed the pre-Cancun joint [MISC U.S.-EU  ] agriculture paper as proof the [LOC U.S.  ] has changed its position and is adopting a more protectionist stance . 
He said this perception is important in terms of how it affects the overall attitude toward the [LOC US  ] and any analysis of [LOC U.S.  ] motives . 
4 ) The [LOC U.S.  ] is out to isolate [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] personalizes [LOC US  ] aggressive trade policy suggesting that [LOC US  ] CAFTA negotiations and discussions with [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , etc are aimed at " encircling " [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[MISC Ecouns  ] and econoff argued that the [LOC US  ] motivation for these trade talks is to pursue trade liberalization as quickly as possible with like-minded countries that are ready and willing ; if [LOC Brazil  ] becomes isolated it will be the result of its own decisions and trade policies , which don't coincide with those of a majority of countries in the region . 
[PER Arno  ] said he understands ; he had witnessed the isolation in [LOC T&T  ] and knows that countries there were acting out of their own economic interests , but [ORG Itamaraty  ] tries to portray it as is they have been forced by the [LOC US.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
[PER Arno  ] advised that if DUSTR Allgeier during his meetings in [LOC Brasilia  ] October 20-21 could provide information/arguments to Minister [PER Palocci  ] and others that they could use to challenge these perceptions , it would enable them to more forcefully make pro-FTAA arguments. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
Since he had identified agriculture as the [ORG GOB  ] 's key issue , we asked [PER Arno  ] whether he thought the [ORG GOB  ] would withdraw its 3-track proposal if a way around the impasse on domestic support was found . 
He was unsure , noting that Minister [PER Amorim  ] had stated publicly that week that [LOC Brazil  ] would not accept any agreement that would " tie our hands " on industrial policy . 
He added that the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] supports negotiation of rules in services and investment because [LOC Brazil  ] is relatively open in these areas and would not have difficulty negotiating a satisfactory agreement . 
The [ORG Finance Ministry  ] does not share [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's view that the country must safeguard the possibility of adopting nationalistic industrial policies in the future . 
He also noted that the [ORG Finance Ministry  ] had been very favorably disposed toward USTR [PER Zoellick  ] 's ideas about a possible baseline approach , having common rules and then allowing others that want to go beyond doing so through bilaterals or plurilaterals. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
As an aside , he opined that one positive thing to have occurred during a tumultuous week of intra-governmental squabbling was the rallying of pro-FTAA forces , in the press , private sector , academia , and government . 
He also said that personally he was very disappointed by the way the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation conducted itself in [LOC T&T  ] and did not understand why they did not use it as an opportunity to explain and sell their proposal . 
Conclusions -------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
Some key points to emerge from these meetings and the post [LOC T&T  ] public debate: -- President [PER Lula  ] 's support for Minister [PER Amorim  ] means that [ORG Itamaraty  ] will continue to retain a stranglehold on trade policy in general , [ORG FTAA  ] in particular . 
It appears increasingly that [PER Amorim  ] may not accurately portray for [PER Lula  ] the [LOC US  ] position or the situation vis-a-vis lack of regional support for the [MISC Brazilian  ] position . 
-- [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's defensive interest in avoiding disciplines in services , investment , government procurement , and [ORG IPR  ] , is at least as important , if not more so , than its offensive interests in agriculture . 
This makes it unclear if resolution of the impasse over domestic support would induce [ORG Itamaraty  ] to withdraw its 3-track proposal or its proposal in T&T of text for a ministerial declaration . 
Lack of any give by the [ORG USG  ] on negotiating antidumping rules will continue to provide [ORG Itamaraty  ] with an excuse to push for removal of issues it deems sensitive from the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
-- Criticism of [ORG Itamaraty  ] concerning [LOC Brazil  ] 's isolation on substance , and most importantly its struggle to keep [LOC Uruguay  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] Mercosul partners in line , interjected doubt about the wisdom of its approach into the policy debate . 
This opened the door for wide ranging criticism from the press , economic commentators and even other ministers . 
This undermines [PER Amorim  ] 's image as a regional foreign policy leader and introduced the idea that [LOC Brazil  ] could be acting as a spoiler . 
-- There is substantial support for an [ORG FTAA  ] within the [ORG GOB  ] . 
However , despite frustration with [ORG Itamaraty  ] over policy formulation and implementation , the other ministries are not well positioned at this time to force a significant change . 
-- There appears to be real concern that there will be a train wreck in [LOC Miami  ] . 
The fact that ministers made this a public debate indicates the seriousness with which it is being taken and perhaps was intended as a way of drawing President [PER Lula  ] 's attention to the problem . 
Comment ----------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
Although the prospect of a change in [ORG GOB  ] policy direction before the [ORG Miami Ministerial  ] is dim , pressure to change course may grow afterward as other ministers and as the [MISC Brazilian  ] private sector come to realize the costs associated with [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's minimalist approach to the [ORG FTAA  ] , whether it is isolation and being left outside an agreement , or possibly accepting major reductions in market access for lower level commitments on rules . 
Whatever construct the [ORG USG  ] decides to pursue for the negotiations in [LOC Miami  ] , it would be wise to orchestrate it in a way that amicably leaves the door open for greater participation of [LOC Brazil  ] in the future ; not only to enable the [ORG USG  ] to continue to strive for the larger goal of a totally integrated hemisphere , but also to minimize the opportunity for anti-FTAA factions within [LOC Brazil  ] to lay the blame for " failure , " or alienation of [LOC Brazil  ] , in [LOC Miami  ] at the feet of the [ORG USG  ] . 
A consistent message from other countries in the region that their interests do not coincide with [LOC Brazil  ] 's will be key to helping with the latter .
