( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] Following a four-day standoff , the [MISC Russian  ] plane scheduled to remove [LOC Libya  ] 's last remaining [ORG HEU  ] spent fuel stores departed [LOC Libya  ] without its cargo . 
Despite bilateral agreements with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] -- and intensive outreach efforts by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] Ambassadors -- [MISC Libyan  ] officials unexpectedly refused to allow the [ORG HEU  ] to leave the country . 
[ORG DOE  ] experts are deeply concerned by the safety and security risks posed by the [MISC Libyans'  ] decision . 
The seven five-ton casks , each closed with two [ORG IAEA  ] seals , remain at the lightly-guarded [ORG Tajoura Nuclear Facility  ] . 
[ORG DOE  ] experts requested that the [ORG GOL  ] disengage the loading crane and provide extra armed guards , but are not confident that the [ORG GOL  ] will take the requisite security measures . 
The [ORG DOE  ] experts will brief the [ORG IAEA  ] of their concerns , and said the [ORG IAEA  ] could provide additional seals appropriate for long-term storage and cameras. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary continued: According to the [ORG DOE  ] experts , we have one month to resolve the situation before the safety and security concerns become a crisis . 
They believe [LOC Russia  ] could provide another plane to remove the [ORG HEU  ] in late December , at which point the casks must be moved to their next location . 
If the [ORG HEU  ] is not removed from the casks within three months , its rising temperature could cause the casks to crack and to release radioactive nuclear material . 
If the [ORG HEU  ] is not sent to [LOC Russia  ] , the [MISC Russians  ] would be required to develop entirely new technology to remove the spent fuel from the casks in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Security concerns alone dictate that we must employ all of our resources to find a timely solution to this problem , and to keep any mention of it out of the press . 
End summary . 
[ORG GOL  ] UNEXPECTEDLY HALTS [ORG HEU  ] FUEL SHIPMENT <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On November 20 the [ORG GOL  ] unexpectedly ordered a team of visiting [ORG Department of Energy and  ] [MISC Russian  ] ( from [PER Rostom Kirienko  ] ) officials to halt preparations of [LOC Libya  ] 's 5.2 kilograms of highly enriched uranium ( [ORG HEU  ] ) fuel to ship to [LOC Russia  ] for treatment and disposal , in spite of the government-to-government agreement signed by [LOC Libya  ] and the [LOC United States  ] on October 28 and a parallel agreement with the [MISC Russian  ] government ( reftel ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The plane , a [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Antonov  ] 124-100 , was scheduled to arrive on November 21 , with loading to take place during the night of November 21 , for shipment on November 22 . 
Although the [MISC Russian  ] crew already had official [MISC Libyan  ] permission to land on November 21 , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the [ORG DOE  ] and [MISC Russian  ] teams , via his staff , that the [MISC Libyan  ] government did not approve the landing and asked that the plane be delayed . 
The teams delayed arrival of the plane until November 23 . 
After several days on the ground without a change in the [ORG GOL  ] 's position , the [MISC Russian  ] plane and team from [PER Rostom Kirienko  ] departed early in the morning of November 25 without the shipment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Since November 20 , the Ambassador and emboffs have engaged [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials , the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] 's ( [ORG NSA  ] ) office , the PM 's office , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's staff , and [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's staff , seeking an explanation and reversal of the [ORG GOL  ] 's last-minute decision to halt the shipment . 
[ORG Foreign Ministry  ] and [ORG NSA  ] officials pledged to communicate the problems to Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , [PER Mutassim  ] al-Qadhafi , respectively . 
The Ambassador has also maintained close communication with the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador on the situation . 
One official insisted to the Ambassador that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] had done everything " by the book " to prepare for the fuel transfer to move forward on November 21 and could not imagine what could have gone wrong . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he did not know what was holding up the program . 
SECURITY CONCERNS TRIPOLI 00000938 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On November 25 , the [ORG DOE  ] team briefed the Ambassador and emboffs on their concerns about the security of the [ORG HEU  ] in its present state and next steps . 
The 5.2 kilograms of [ORG HEU  ] are stored in seven five-ton casks , which the [ORG DOE  ] experts said are " highly transportable . 
" The casks currently are at the lightly-guarded [ORG Tajoura Nuclear Facility  ] , closed with two [ORG IAEA  ] seals that are adequate only for transportation , not storage . 
The team asked the Director of the [LOC Tajoura  ] facility to disengage the site 's loading crane , in order to prevent an intruder from using it to move the casks . 
They also asked that extra human security be added onsite , stating that the last time they were at [LOC Tajoura  ] , on November 24 , they only saw one security guard with a gun ( although they did not know if it was loaded ) . 
The team plans to brief the [ORG IAEA  ] about the situation and to express concern about the security of the fuel . 
They said it was possible that the [ORG IAEA  ] would provide additional seals and/or cameras to increase the casks' security. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to the [ORG DOE  ] experts , we have approximately one month to resolve the situation , before the safety and security concerns posed by the delayed shipment reach the level of a crisis . 
The casks in which the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG HEU  ] is stored must be moved to their next location at the end of December . 
The [ORG DOE  ] experts believe that the [MISC Russians  ] could provide another plane to transport that shipment during that timeframe . 
However , if the [MISC Libyans  ] refuse to allow the shipment to go forward , the [MISC Russian  ] experts would be required to design new technology to remove the spent fuel from the casks and put it back into the ponds at [LOC Tajoura  ] . 
[ORG DOE  ] experts stressed that this would be an unprecedented operation . 
They also stated that the spent fuel must be either shipped to [LOC Russia  ] or removed from the casks in the next three months . 
At that point , the temperature of the [ORG HEU  ] fuel , which is radioactive , could reach such a level to cause cracking on the casks and release of radioactive nuclear material . 
The team stated that their [MISC Russian  ] counterparts are deeply concerned about liability if the radioactive material leaks from the transportation casks . 
NEXT STEPS <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) If the [MISC Libyans  ] can be persuaded to allow the transfer to proceed , the [ORG DOE  ] team will work with [MISC Russian  ] counterparts to schedule another visit by the [MISC Russian  ] plane for transportation of the fuel , which the team estimated could take up to a month ( that will require the reissuance of overflight and entry permits for [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Greece  ] , and [LOC Libya  ] , as well as cancellation of other transport contracts that the plane already has scheduled ) . 
Absent [LOC Libya  ] 's agreement to allow the shipment to move forward , the [ORG DOE  ] and [MISC Russian  ] team will resort to designing and manufacturing the technology that would be necessary to unload the fuel casks remotely at the [LOC Tajoura  ] facility . 
COMMENT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Security concerns dictate that we must deploy all of our resources to find a solution to this problem . 
The Ambassador continues to seek an urgent meeting with the [MISC Libyan  ] Foreign Minister and other senior officials to press for a resolution and to obtain information about what instigated the [MISC Libyan  ] decision to halt progress on the fuel shipment . 
The [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador has also been trying to meet with any of several high-level officials , but has been ignored . 
The situation has been complicated by a state visit by the [MISC Turkish  ] PM as well as other visits , and the onset of the Eid al-Adha holiday , which began here today and extends for four days . 
The [MISC Russians  ] did manage to convey a letter from Vice FM Sultanov on November 24 , urging the [ORG GOL  ] to let the shipment take place . 
If further efforts fail over the next few days , it may be necessary to consider a senior-level official call to [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi to stress the urgency of the situation and the high degree of concern about the possibility of [LOC Libya  ] 's backtracking on its nuclear nonproliferation commitments . 
Lacking any other information , we have to assume that the [MISC Libyan  ] leader is the source of the problem at this point <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Security concerns also dictate that we handle this issue with the utmost discretion . 
Given the highly transportable nature of the [ORG HEU  ] and the shoddy security at TRIPOLI 00000938 003.2 OF 003 [LOC Tajoura  ] , any mention of this issue in the press could pose serious security concerns . 
We strongly urge that any press inquiries be addressed with a no comment -- or a more general reply along the lines of: The [LOC U.S.  ] and the international community continue to work with the Government of [LOC Libya  ] to address its WMD commitments . 
End comment .
