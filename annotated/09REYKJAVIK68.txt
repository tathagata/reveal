( C ) Summary: During the Ambassador 's farewell call , a tired looking and clearly over-worked Steingrimur [PER J. Sigfusson  ] was confident about the upcoming elections , happy with the progress with the [ORG IMF  ] , and encouraged by [LOC Iceland  ] 's negotiating position with the [LOC IceSave  ] accounts . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] 's roles as Minister of [LOC Finance  ] , Minister of [ORG Fisheries  ] and [ORG Agriculture  ] , Deputy Prime Minister , and Leader of the [ORG Left Green Party  ] generated an expansive and wide ranging conversation . 
If his party participates in the new government , [PER Sigfusson  ] said that progress with [ORG IMF  ] will continue on the new Letter of Intent , [LOC Iceland  ] will press harder for favorable loan terms from the [LOC U.K.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] on [LOC IceSave  ] , and the commercial whaling quotas will be reduced in the future . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] also said he was considering seeking bilateral loans from the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Canada  ] ( the Ambassador explained why he should not look to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) and believes that [LOC Iceland  ] is unlikely to seek [ORG E.U.  ] membership any time soon . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During the April 7 office call , [PER Sigfusson  ] confessed to the Ambassador that he is extremely busy in his multiple roles of Minister of [LOC Finance  ] , Minister of [ORG Fisheries  ] and [ORG Agriculture  ] , Head of the [ORG Left Green Party  ] and Deputy Prime Minister . 
He said that he would be surprised if there were any big changes in the polls in the last few weeks before elections , and barring some significant event , he expected the interim government to return to office. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sigfusson  ] admitted that he was never a proponent of an [ORG International Monetary Fund  ] ( [ORG IMF  ] ) loan for [LOC Iceland  ] and felt that a better option would have been to seek a [MISC Nordic-EFTA  ] package of loans . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] said he put a lot of work into that idea in November ( while he was in opposition ) but was stymied by the former government . 
He commented that a recent rise in public sentiment to abandon the [ORG IMF  ] obligations is being fueled " by the news from [LOC Latvia  ] . 
" However , as a minister , he recognized that it is very important that the [ORG IMF  ] program continue and he emphasized that the [ORG IMF  ] representatives he has met have been professional and helpful . 
He said work was being finalized now with [ORG IMF  ] in [LOC Washington  ] on a new agreement to be completed soon after Easter , which will then be presented to the [ORG IMF Board  ] for consideration . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] has missed the annual meeting deadline but hopes the board will meet in early [LOC May.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On [LOC IceSave  ] , [PER Sigfusson  ] felt the recent [LOC U.K.  ] Parliamentary report which criticized the [LOC U.K.  ] government use of terrorism finance laws against [LOC Iceland  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] banks in October 2008 puts [LOC Iceland  ] in a stronger negotiating position . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] said the report was harsh , and to his mind depicts [ORG Chancellor of the  ] Exchequer [PER Alistair Darling  ] as lying about why the terrorism act had to be invoked . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] cited the recent meeting between Foreign Minister [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] and [MISC British  ] Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] and his own recent correspondence with [MISC Dutch  ] authorities as helpful in keeping communications open . 
He said that the Icelanders are also giving the [LOC U.K.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] updated information on the overall debt situation , which looks worse than it did in October/November . 
He said at that time the [ORG IMF  ] predicted debt as 160 to 170 percent of GDP , but those figures have now been revised to 200 to 225 percent of GDP . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] said the [MISC Icelandic  ] people " are prepared to honor their obligations , " but to pay for the aggressive and speculative " behavior abroad is unjust and unfair . 
" Sigufsson stressed that the terms of the loans to cover the [LOC IceSave  ] minimum deposits are essential -- it 's very important that [LOC Iceland  ] receive low rates with a long grace period. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On whaling , [PER Sigfusson  ] reiterated that his hands were legally tied by the decision of his predecessor and that he has made it known that if the interim government returns after the election , it will work to undo future commercial whaling . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] confirmed he had received the letter from [ORG Whole Foods  ] grocery store , warning that it will find substitutes for [MISC Icelandic  ] products if whaling continues , but did not seem to take it seriously . 
He admitted that he had received a stack of similar letters but hadn't read them all . 
The impression he left was that he is looking forward to handing the [ORG Fisheries  ] portfolio to someone else in the next government. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Sigfusson  ] said he wants greater cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] He especially wants to talk with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] governments about bilateral loans to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The Ambassador clarified the lack of a mechanism or legislative authority in the [LOC U.S.  ] for such loans to advanced nations . 
He commented that the loan [LOC Russia  ] promised would probably not happen because the [MISC Russians  ] have not shown much real interest and are seeking additional information from [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] , who is an opponent of joining the [ORG E.U.  ] , gamed out for us that regardless of who wins the parliamentary elections , the [ORG Althingi  ] is likely to be largely anti-Icelandic accession to the [ORG E.U.  ] He [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000068 002 OF 002 remarked that the [ORG Independence Party  ] copied his party 's platform and they too are not pro-EU but would let the public decide the issue in a public referendum if it came to that stage . 
He thinks [ORG EU  ] accession is doubtful in the near future. van Voorst</pre></code>
