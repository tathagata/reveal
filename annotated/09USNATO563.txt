( C/NF ) This is a request for guidance by [ORG OOB Brussels  ] time on December 4 . 
See para 7. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY . 
On December 2 , the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador and [ORG NATO  ] Secretary General ( SYG ) [PER Rasmussen  ] received a demarche from The [MISC Dutch  ] PermRep to [ORG NATO  ] , [PER Frank Majoor  ] , requesting options [LOC The Hague  ] could pursue to keep a [MISC Dutch  ] presence in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Majoor  ] said that [LOC The Hague  ] would make a decision on its future role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] on December 7 and sought ideas that he could present to [LOC The Hague  ] as possible alternatives to a [MISC Dutch  ] withdrawal from [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
According to [PER Majoor  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] senior leadership was interested in maintaining a military presence as part of [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG International Security Assistance Force  ] ( [ORG ISAF  ] ) mission in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but the option to stay in [LOC Uruzgan  ] was virtually off the table . 
He described the political situation on this issue as increasingly complicated and hotly debated in [LOC The Hague  ] . 
The [ORG NATO  ] SYG thought that a reduction of a [MISC Dutch  ] presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] would counterbalance years of efforts it undertook to build good relations with local officials and acquire an understanding of the local situation . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC Uruzgan  ] Is Not An Option ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC Dutch  ] PermRep [PER Majoor  ] told the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador and [ORG NATO  ] SYG [PER Rasmussen  ] , in separate discussions , that senior [MISC Dutch  ] leadership would soon make a decision not to continue as the lead nation in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province and continuation of a [MISC Dutch  ] role in any capacity in the province was seemingly remote . 
[PER Majoor  ] also said that the continuation of the [ORG Dutch Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] ( [ORG PRT  ] ) and its development activities in the province were increasingly unlikely . 
But...We 'd Like To Stay In [LOC The South  ] -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Majoor  ] said , in light of the pending withdrawal , The [ORG Hague  ] was still interested in continuing a military presence in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He sought ideas to find a coherent military solution to an imminent decision to withdraw and asked [PER Daalder  ] and [PER Rasmussen  ] what else the [MISC Dutch  ] could do in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] to continue as part of the [ORG ISAF  ] mission . 
[PER Majoor  ] noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] Chief of [MISC Defense  ] would consult with [ORG SACEUR  ] directly on this same question . 
According to [PER Majoor  ] , if non-Uruzgan options were identified , it might be possible to garner support and incorporate them into [MISC Dutch  ] senior level discussions . 
[PER Majoor  ] said that [MISC Dutch  ] senior leadership would meet on December 7 to debate its future role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [ORG NATO  ] SYG Takes A Tough Line --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG NATO  ] SYG responded to the [MISC Dutch  ] PermRep with a stern message for The [LOC Netherlands  ] to stay and continue as the lead nation in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province . 
[PER Rasmussen  ] said he was investing lots of time and effort encouraging nations to increase their military and financial contributions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In his view , he was asking many countries to make difficult decisions and found it contrary to his efforts to help the [MISC Dutch  ] , simultaneously , reduce its forces . 
The [ORG NATO  ] SYG thought that a reduction of a [MISC Dutch  ] presence in [LOC Uruzgan  ] would counterbalance years of efforts it undertook to build good relations with local officials and acquire an understanding of the local situation . 
Separately , the SYG told us he was content to let the [MISC Dutch  ] continue to feel the political pressure from Allies than offer an exit strategy too early . 
The SYG also informed the Ambassador that he would call Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] to deliver a stern message directly . 
Will The [LOC U.S.  ] Lead When We Leave ? ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Majoor  ] asked Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] if the [LOC U.S.  ] would volunteer as the lead nation in [LOC Uruzgan  ] after the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG USNATO  ] 00000563 002 OF 002 stepped down . 
Additionally , [PER Majoor  ] asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to consider providing force protection to civilian elements of its [ORG PRT  ] , if The [ORG Hague  ] decided to continue [MISC Dutch  ] development efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province . 
Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] promised to refer the questions to [LOC Washington  ] in order to get an answer before the December 7 meeting in The [ORG Hague  ] . 
Request For Guidance ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Request for [LOC Guidance: Mission  ] requests guidance for use with the [MISC Dutch  ] senior leadership on the following questions: -- Will the [LOC U.S.  ] volunteer to be the lead nation in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province after the [MISC Dutch  ] step down from the role ? 
-- Would the [LOC U.S.  ] provide force protection to [MISC Dutch  ] civilian [ORG PRT  ] elements allowed to remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] after a drawdown of [MISC Dutch  ] military forces in the province ? 
-- Is there a coherent , military role the [MISC Dutch  ] could play within its available capacity outside of [LOC Uruzgan  ] ?
