Over 100 people participated in the police operations including members of the [ORG Reykjavik Metropolitan Police  ] ; police departments in Eastern [LOC Iceland  ] ; the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner ; the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ; the [MISC Danish  ] military ; and the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] .

End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) On April 18-19 , [MISC Icelandic  ] police and [ORG Coast Guard  ] officers coordinated in the largest narcotics seizure in the country 's history . 
The operation resulted from ongoing investigations and liaison with other [MISC European  ] police units , combined with a tip from a vigilant fishing vessel crew . 
[PER Stefan Eiriksson  ] , the Commissioner of the [ORG Metropolitan Police  ] , told a press conference that the investigations conducted by the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] and the [ORG Metropolitan Police  ] had been ongoing for some time . 
However , they acted quickly when an [MISC Icelandic  ] fishing vessel notified the police authorities of the movements of a suspicious sailboat heading towards the coast of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] media reported that on April 18 , three men piloted a rented inflatable boat with an outboard motor from [LOC Djupivogur  ] , a small town on the east coast of [LOC Iceland  ] , to pick up 240 pounds of drugs from a rented [MISC Belgian  ] sailboat south east of the [MISC Icelandic  ] coast . 
The men returned with the drugs to [LOC Djupivogur  ] , loaded them into a vehicle and headed to [LOC Reykjavik  ] . 
Later that night police stopped the car near [LOC Hofn  ] and arrested the three men. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) At the same time , the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) started pursuing the sailboat by sea . 
On April 19 , the [ORG ICG  ] 's fixed wing aircraft also joined in the search , and the aircraft located the sailboat midway between [LOC Iceland  ] and the [LOC Faroe Islands  ] . 
The crew established radio contact with the sailboat but the men aboard disregarded orders to stop . 
While the [ORG ICG  ] aircraft returned to [LOC Iceland  ] to refuel , a [MISC Danish  ] military [ORG Challenger CL604  ] airplane replaced it , keeping up the pursuit . 
Finally , late on the 19th , the [ORG ICG  ] ship caught up with the sailboat 74 nautical miles ( 85 miles ) northwest of the [LOC Faroe Islands  ] . 
Four members of the Special Unit of the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner ( the [ORG Viking Squad  ] ) , who had been transported aboard the [ORG ICG  ] vessel earlier in a helicopter , boarded the sailboat and arrested three men , two Icelanders and a [MISC Dutchman  ] . 
The [ORG ICG  ] vessel and the sailboat returned to [LOC Iceland  ] on April 21. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Over 100 people participated in the operation , including: members of the [ORG Reykjavik Metropolitan Police  ] ; police departments in Eastern [LOC Iceland  ] ; the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner ; the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ; and the [MISC Danish  ] military , which provided a [ORG Challenger CL604  ] aircraft to provide air surveillance relieving the [ORG ICG  ] 's aircraft during refueling . 
The [MISC Danish  ] contribution was coordinated through the [ORG Iceland Defense Agency  ] after the [ORG ICG  ] asked for help in finding available [ORG NATO  ] assets . 
[PER Fridrik Jonsson  ] , of the [ORG Defense Agency  ] told [ORG EmbOff  ] , " From the time the [ORG Coast Guard  ] contacted us , the process of contacting and coordinating with both [ORG NATO  ] 's [MISC Combined Air Operations Center  ] in [LOC Finderup  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , and the air forces of neighboring allies was relatively straight forward . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) About half of the 240 pounds of drugs confiscated consisted of white materials ( cocaine , amphetamines etc . 
) and the other half of hashish , marijuana , and a couple of thousand [ORG MDMA  ] ( ecstasy ) tablets . 
As the proportions of the various drugs have not been disclosed exactly , street value cannot be verified but it is clear that it amounts to millions of dollars , making this the biggest drug bust in [MISC Icelandic  ] history . 
This case is reminiscent of the 2007 [MISC Pole  ] Star case where the [MISC Icelandic  ] police authorities raided the sailboat [MISC Pole  ] Star where it was stationed at the [PER Faskrudsfjordur  ] ( a small town on the east coast of [LOC Iceland  ] ) harbor and confiscated 90 pounds of drugs . 
In that case , one defendant was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison , two others received a seven-year sentence , and a fourth defendant was sentenced to five years . 
Other defendants received lighter sentences . 
Also of note is the inclusion of marijuana in the seized shipment . 
In the last few years , smuggling of marijuana to [LOC Iceland  ] has been declining as it has increasingly been grown domestically . 
Recently the [MISC Icelandic  ] police authorities [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000082 002 OF 002 have been very active in infiltrating and stopping these domestic operations and Commissioner [PER Eiriksson  ] noted that the presence of marijuana in the confiscated drugs highlighted the police 's success ; i.e. , dealers are resorting to smuggling marijuana into the country rather than relying on domestic production. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Beyond the successful work by a variety of law enforcement agencies , the cooperation between the [ORG Iceland Defense Agency  ] and the [ORG Coast Guard  ] is remarkable as they have been fighting a bitter duel in the press over budget and areas of responsibility . 
Post is encouraged by these efforts and hopes the coordination can continue regardless of the outcome over budget issues . 
We also anticipate a rise in seizures as the summer travel season gets underway , particularly with the resumption of ferry service between eastern [LOC Iceland  ] , [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , and the [LOC Faroes.  ] van [LOC Voorst</pre></code>  ]
