<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC MADRID  ] 004054 SIPDIS E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 11/23/2015 TAGS: <a href='/tag/ETRD_0.html'>ETRD</a> <a href='/tag/ETTC_0.html'>ETTC</a> <a href='/tag/PREL_0.html'>PREL</a> <a href='/tag/CU_0.html'>CU</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: SPAIN/CUBA: [ORG TITLE III  ] OF [ORG LIBERTAD ACT REF: A. STATE  ] 207359 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC MADRID  ] 2131 [ORG Classified By: Political  ] Counselor [PER Kathy Fitzpatrick  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( B ) a nd ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) [LOC Spain  ] remains among the most important foreign investors in [LOC Cuba  ] , a position it has held since the beginning of the 1990s . 
The " [ORG Association of Spanish Companies  ] in [LOC Cuba  ] " ( [ORG AEEC  ] ) represents over 170 [MISC Spanish  ] companies that trade with or invest in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The current Socialist ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) government has continued the long-standing [MISC Spanish  ] policy of promoting trade with and investment in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
However , the [ORG AEEC  ] complains that the [ORG Zapatero  ] administration has not reinstated the provision of political risk insurance through the " [ORG Spanish Credit Insurance Company  ] " ( [MISC CESCE  ] ) for sales to and investments in [LOC Cuba  ] , suspended several years ago due to [LOC Cuba  ] 's substantial unpaid debts to [MISC CESCE  ] . 
The [ORG Zapatero  ] government has continued its policy of seeking engagement with the [MISC Cuban  ] government and reduced the [MISC Aznar  ] government 's emphasis on promoting human rights . 
[LOC Spain  ] did not invite dissidents to its October 12 national day event in [LOC Havana  ] in order to avoid conflict with the [MISC Cuban  ] government on that issue . 
[LOC Spain  ] successfully argued in [ORG EU  ] councils to delay a review of the [ORG EU  ] Restrive Measures on [LOC Cuba  ] from December 2005 until June 2006. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At our insistence , [MISC Spanish  ] officials acknowledge privately that normalized relations with the [PER Castro  ] government have not yielded significant results , but claim that more time is needed to allow their measures to bear fruit in the form of increased political space for dissidents and greater influence by [ORG EU  ] governments over [MISC Cuban  ] government human rights practices . 
In meetings with USG officials , including [LOC Cuba  ] Transition Coordinator [PER Caleb McCarry  ] , [ORG EUR A/S Dan Fried  ] , and [PER WHA PDAS  ] [PER Charles Shapiro  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] officials made clear that the [ORG GOS  ] will continue to focus on building ties to members of the current [MISC Cuban  ] regime , who they believe [LOC Spain  ] may be able to influence in the post-Castro era . 
At the same time , [MISC Spanish  ] officials assert that they have replaced the invitations to dissidents to attend national day events with a more robust " structured dialogue " between dissidents and [ORG EU  ] diplomats in [LOC Havana.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) We do not believe [LOC Spain  ] will deviate from its current policy of engagement with the [MISC Cuban  ] government , both because of the substantial investments in [LOC Cuba  ] by [MISC Spanish  ] companies and because of the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's belief that engagement will lead to increased [MISC Spanish  ] influence over [PER Castro  ] 's successors . 
However , the continued intrasigience of the [PER Castro  ] government and opposition by some [ORG EU  ] members to the suspension of [ORG EU  ] Restrictive Measures against [LOC Cuba  ] appear to have reduced for now [LOC Spain  ] 's willingness to seek a further weakening of [ORG EU  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] . 
This could change if the [MISC Cuban  ] government releases a substantial number of political prisoners ( which the [ORG GOS  ] would claim as a vindication of its policy ) . 
While the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) is highly critical of the [ORG PSOE  ] government 's diminished support for [MISC Cuban  ] human rights activists , all political groupings in [LOC Spain  ] are unified in their opposition to the [ORG Libertad Act  ] , and particularly to [ORG Title III  ] . 
Both the [ORG PSOE  ] and the [ORG PP  ] would likely seek unified [ORG EU  ] retaliatory action if [ORG Title III  ] action were taken against a [MISC Spanish  ] company. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [MISC Spanish  ] companies are well aware of the potential of [LOC U.S.  ] legal action against them under the [ORG Libertad Act  ] and take care to obscure precise information regarding their investments in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
However , we have obtained the following general information regarding the major [MISC Spanish  ] investors in [LOC Cuba:  ] -- [ORG Grupo Sol Melia: Hotel/Tourism  ] industry .
