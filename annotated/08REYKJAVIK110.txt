( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's Whaling Commissioner [PER Stefan Asmundsson  ] told post that he is pessimistic that any progress will be made in the upcoming [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] meeting in [LOC Chile  ] . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] was careful not to criticize the [ORG IWC  ] Chairman [PER Bill Hogarth  ] but is worried that the focus on consensus building will not help tackle more substantive issues . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] was positive about a small working group , provided it is small and has a good mix of members . 
Regarding the recent trade of fin whale meat with [LOC Japan  ] , [PER Asmundsson  ] said it was perfectly legal and opined the [ORG IWC  ] cannot expect a " status quo " of no whaling while discussions continue within the [ORG IWC  ] . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] also brushed aside the recent reduction of recommended minke hunt from 400 to 100 as an issue of stock distribution , not stock endangerment . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Econoff presented ref A points to [LOC Iceland  ] 's Whaling Commissioner [PER Stefan Asmundsson  ] on June 6 . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] said that his concern with [PER Bill Hogarth  ] 's chairmanship was that the strong focus on consensus and making sure that everyone around the table behaves as friends is circumventing the issue a bit . 
He hopes that the upcoming meeting in [LOC Santiago  ] will be more substantive . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] quickly said that he understood [PER Hogarth  ] 's task was tough and said " this is not a criticism of [PER Bill  ] , " but he opined that nothing will happen in [LOC Santiago  ] if the underlying politics are not addressed. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Asmundsson  ] was familiar with the small working group idea and said , " we already did miniaturization under [PER Henrik Fischer  ] " which was unsuccessful because of political reasons . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] believed that [PER Fischer  ] did get the mix of the group right -- by leaving out the extremes such as [LOC Australia  ] and [LOC Norway  ] . 
This time around [PER Asmundsson  ] believes a good mix for the small groups would be [LOC Iceland  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] , possibly [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , but definitely not [LOC Australia  ] . 
He was not concerned about " too small " a size but rather " too large . 
" [PER Asmundsson  ] said double digits were not a good idea because of the need for intimacy . 
He also went on at length about the need to include countries that are likely to build middle ground and he stressed that moderate countries need to distance themselves from the anti-whaling countries . 
He said what did not work ten years ago was that the parties did not have the political backing to finalize the solution. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding procedural improvements mentioned in the March intersessional , [PER Asmundsson  ] said [LOC Iceland  ] can go along with many of the procedures mentioned . 
He stressed however , that procedures do not address the fundamental issues and described it as " going around the issue . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When directly asked whether the recent shipment of whale meat to [LOC Japan  ] ( Ref B ) will affect this year 's negotiations , [PER Asmundsson  ] said the trade was legal and thought it would not have an effect . 
He said that [LOC Iceland  ] 's position has been clear since it resumed commercial whaling in October 2006 and that trade was implicit with that decision ( Ref D ) . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] said this just showed the problems with the [ORG IWC  ] and that action needed to happen fast if one wanted the [ORG IWC  ] to have a role . 
He continued with " you can't expect a status quo while discussions continue in the [ORG IWC  ] " and later went on to say , " unless the [ORG IWC  ] improves , things will continue outside the [ORG IWC  ] . 
It 's not what we want , but that 's what we have . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) When Econoff raised further questions regarding future trade with [LOC Japan  ] ( Ref C ) , [PER Asmundsson  ] responded that the transaction was not a government operation and the decision to trade had already been made in 2006 . 
He noted that the 2006 quota had expired , so if [PER Kristjan Loftsson  ] , the only fin whaler in [LOC Iceland  ] , wanted to hunt fins , he would have to ask for a new quota . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] did not reveal whether [PER Loftsson  ] had filed such a request , but did say " I wouldn't rule out " a new fin whale quota. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regarding the recent media reports that the [ORG Icelandic Marine Research Institute  ] revised their recommendation for a sustainable quota for minke whales from 400 animals in 2007 to 100 animals in 2008 , [PER Asmundsson  ] said it was an issue of stock distribution , not stock size . 
[PER Asmundsson  ] said there is no indication of a collapse in minke whale stock as skinny animals would have been observed . 
He noted that the commercial minke quota of 40 animals ( Ref B ) this year showed that [LOC Iceland  ] takes sustainability seriously .
