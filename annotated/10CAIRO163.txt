He noted the training would be based on international and [ORG UN  ] standards . 
He was confident the [ORG GOE  ] High Election Commission , which will administer the elections with the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , will accept [ORG NGOs  ] trained by [ORG NCHR  ] as domestic observers . 
He reiterated [ORG NCHR  ] 's position supporting international observers for the 2010 elections ( ref D ) . 
[PER Kutb  ] asserted that the [ORG GOE  ] is still considering whether to allow such observers . 
According to [PER Kutb  ] , [ORG NCHR  ] is trying to convince the [ORG GOE  ] to accept international observers by explaining that foreigners such as diplomats and journalists have observed previous elections , and will do so again . 
[PER Kutb  ] opined that the most important electoral reforms would be voter registration through national identification cards and transition to a party-list from a single-district system , but doubted the [ORG GOE  ] would enact either before the 2010 elections. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Human Rights  ] lawyer [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he expected the coming elections not to be free and fair , and urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to begin planning a public response . 
He applauded [PER A/S Posner  ] 's January 14 public comments on the [PER Naga Hamadi  ] killings , and encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to consider using a similar public tone in response to expected election violations . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to warn the [ORG GOE  ] privately of " specific consequences " if the 2010 elections are a repeat of the 2005 contests . 
Director of the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] exhorted the [LOC U.S.  ] to press for international observers ; he assessed such observers would lend credibility to the elections , and result in increased voter turnout . 
Chair of [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] doubted international observers would make a significant difference in the elections , noting she has been an international observer for [MISC Arab  ] elections that appeared to be free and fair , but the governments had pre-determined the results by manipulating the rules . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] XXXXXXXXXXXXX asserted that only a constitutional amendment restoring judicial supervision of the elections would result in higher voter turnout , but ruled out [ORG GOE  ] support for such an amendment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .

( C ) Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Wafaa Bassim  ] said the [ORG GOE  ] wants quick action , and needs to try the case under the [ORG Emergency Law  ] to underscore the issue 's " relevance to national security " and the [ORG GOE  ] 's clarity of purpose . 
Trying the case under the penal code " would take ages , " she asserted . 
[PER Bassim  ] acknowledged this action is contrary to [ORG GOE  ] assurances it uses the [ORG Emergency Law  ] only for terrorism and drug cases ( ref E ) . 
She said the Public Prosecutor 's investigation has been thorough and transparent . 
[ORG MFA  ] Deputy Assistant Minister for [ORG Human Rights Wael Aboulmagd  ] conceded the [ORG GOE  ] has favored " superficial reconciliation " efforts in the past , and did not respond " thoroughly " to sectarian violence . 
DAS Wittes expressed concern over broad [ORG GOE  ] application of the [ORG Emergency Law  ] , and urged the [ORG GOE  ] to try the case under the penal code . 
She worried that a quick trial could preclude a full investigation , and that lingering questions could erode public confidence in the government 's handling of the issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Aboulmagd  ] said the [ORG GOE  ] does not view the draft [ORG NCHR Unified Places of Worship law  ] , which would place approval for church and mosque construction and repairs under uniform [ORG GOE  ] criteria , as a solution to sectarian tensions . 
He noted MOI views that such a law would exacerbate sectarian problems , and that [MISC Muslims  ] " would call for [MISC Jihad  ] " in response to increased church construction and repairs . 
[ORG Aboulmagd  ] doubted the [ORG GOE  ] would take action on the draft law. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Mukhlis Kutb  ] said [ORG NCHR  ] sent a research team to [PER Naga Hamadi  ] , and will issue a detailed report on the killings . 
He attributed the killings to " an atmosphere of hate " spread on television and " on the streets . 
" He assessed the [ORG GOE  ] decided to try the assailants in an [ORG Emergency State Security  ] court because a regular criminal trial " would take too much time . 
" [PER Kutb  ] doubted a regular criminal court would convict [MISC Muslims  ] for murdering [MISC Copts  ] , due to " [ORG Sharia  ] law considerations and the influence of mosques . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXXX said " he feels humiliated every day as a [PER Copt  ] , " hearing anti-Christian mosque sermons in his club and reading editorials in pro-government " [ORG Al-Ahram  ] " newspaper that " the Bible is corrupt . 
" He criticized the [ORG GOE  ] for " allowing violence against [MISC Copts  ] " by not prosecuting perpetrators . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXblamed the [ORG GOE  ] for not preventing the [PER Naga Hamadi  ] killings , and for not reforming the educational system to combat anti-Coptic sentiment. ------------------------------------ [ORG U.S. Democracy Promotion  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 .

Deputy Assistant Minister for [ORG Human Rights Wael Aboulmagd  ] asserted that some [ORG NGOs  ] choose not to register under the [ORG NGO  ] law , but continue to operate . 
He claimed registered [ORG NGOs  ] believe they are " at a disadvantage " by " playing by the rules . 
" DAS Wittes pushed back , saying that the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to support the full range of [MISC Egyptian  ] civil society and the emergence of new actors , and that the [ORG GOE  ] denies or does not act on some [ORG NGO  ] applications . 
She hoped that the [ORG GOE  ] would facilitate this process and increase civil society 's role . 
Separately , human rights lawyer [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] called for public and private [LOC U.S  ] . 
" moral support " for [MISC Egyptian  ] civil society , and asserted that such support is more important than funding . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to fund only " competent " [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] , warning that many organizations are " weak . 
" DAS Wittes assured civil society activists the [LOC U.S.  ] is committed to promoting democracy and human rights , as evidenced by frequent public statements by the Secretary and other senior officials. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
