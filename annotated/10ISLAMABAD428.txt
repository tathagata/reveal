( C ) Senator [PER John Kerry  ] opened the February 16 meeting with President [PER Asif Ali Zardari  ] by referring to his recent talks with [MISC Indian  ] PM [PER Manmohan Singh  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] PM [PER Yousuf Raza Gilani  ] ( reftel ) . 
[PER Kerry  ] said [PER Singh  ] was " very open " to negotiation with [LOC Pakistan  ] , starting with the upcoming discussions between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC India  ] 's Foreign Secretaries . 
[PER Kerry  ] said that cooperation on counter terrorism with the [MISC Indians  ] could lead to [MISC Indian  ] compromises on key [MISC Pakistani  ] issues such as [LOC Kashmir  ] and water use in subsequent meetings . 
[PER Kerry  ] encouraged the GOP to come up with specific offers to which the [MISC GOI  ] could respond. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] agreed dialogue is the only way forward . 
However , he justified continued suspicion of [LOC India  ] , citing recent " confirmation " that there was [MISC Indian  ] involvement in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
He claimed [LOC India  ] had increased its military spending 30 percent this year and described this as a direct threat to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
When [PER Kerry  ] pointed out the [MISC Chinese  ] threat to [LOC India  ] , [PER Zardari  ] responded that [MISC Indian  ] tanks cannot operate in the [MISC Chinese  ] border region and could only be intended for an attack on [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC India  ] has 4,700 tanks , he explained , while [LOC Pakistan  ] has only 2,600 . 
" Capability creates a fear , " he added. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kerry  ] said [PER Zardari  ] should put his concerns on the negotiating table as there was a real opportunity for productive conversation between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] now: " You could arrive at a surprising consensus of mutual understanding . 
" [PER Zardari  ] conceded that [PER Singh  ] deserved respect , but said he was not confident about the rest of the [MISC Indian  ] government . 
[PER Zardari  ] , s Take on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Kerry  ] asked [PER Zardari  ] what affect President [PER Obama  ] 's announcement of a [LOC U.S.  ] drawdown date had had on the possibility of success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] answered that it had given a boost to those fighting against the [LOC United States  ] , but that they " live in illusion . 
" [PER Zardari  ] doubted that the [LOC U.S.  ] would actually leave [LOC Afghanistan  ] in two and a half years , adding that " no one can afford that . 
" [PER Kerry  ] asked if dialogue with the [ORG Taliban  ] was possible . 
[PER Zardari  ] gave a qualified yes: in specific regions , like [LOC Quetta  ] , dialogue might be possible , but on a larger scale it was not . 
[PER Kerry  ] asked to what degree events in [LOC Iran  ] have an impact in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] said [LOC Iran  ] needs to be engaged , and recounted his visit to [LOC Iran  ] as an emissary of the " free world .

( C ) [PER Kerry  ] noted that , with the December mosque bombing in [LOC Rawalpindi  ] , [MISC Pakistani  ] terrorism had changed . 
He asked if [LOC Pakistan  ] was going to commit to doing whatever it takes to get rid of extremism . 
[PER Zardari  ] replied that he was thinking of the future and what will win people away from extremism in ten or fifteen years . 
He added , however , that he was " fighting a war on a shoestring budget . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Kerry  ] said the GOP needed to rebuild the conflict-affected areas as soon as possible . 
He explained that new roads , power plants , and health clinics need to go in quickly or any progress made in vanquishing the militants and extremists would be lost . 
[PER Zardari  ] agreed but added that the war went beyond these areas . 
He explained that when a [LOC U.S.  ] soldier leaves [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he no longer fears for his life ; when a [MISC Pakistani  ] soldier leaves the conflict areas , however , he has to worry that militants might target him in his home in [LOC Punjab  ] or [LOC Sindh  ] . 
Trade , not Aid - - - - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] complained that [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zones  ] ( ROZs ) were too confined and requested broader trade concessions for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Kerry  ] said that , given the increase in troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the subsequent increased [LOC U.S.  ] demand on [LOC Pakistan  ] , he would see if greater trading concessions for [LOC Pakistan  ] as a whole could be included in an upcoming security package. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Kerry  ] warned , however , that his ability to push for a liberalized trade agreement between [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] was directly tied to [LOC Pakistan  ] 's democratic stability and continued cooperation in supporting [LOC Afghanistan  ] and defeating terrorists . 
Every time there is a " hiccough " in [LOC Pakistan  ] 's support , [PER Kerry  ] explained , [ORG Congress  ] waivers on giving [LOC Pakistan  ] additional concessions or aid . 
As [LOC Pakistan  ] was a new democracy , [PER Zardari  ] said there would naturally be many " hiccoughs , " but added , " message understood . 
" [PER Kerry  ] said that [LOC Pakistan  ] also needed to create trade agreements with its neighbors , which would let the [MISC Pakistani  ] public know that the GOP was committed to real economic improvement . 
[ORG Pakistan Nuclear Assistance  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) [PER Kerry  ] said that the lingering [PER A.Q. Khan  ] network remained " an albatross " around [LOC Pakistan  ] 's neck . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] 's ability to reach a new security arrangement with [LOC India  ] and the increased strength of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's democratic institutions would be necessary conditions for the [LOC U.S.  ] to consider civilian nuclear assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Something for the [ORG People of Pakistan  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] expressed his gratitude for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He opined that he was " a casualty of the world recession " and needed something to give his people , as all they had since he came to power were price increases . 
[PER Zardari  ] requested that the [ORG USG  ] weigh in with the [ORG IMF  ] against further electricity tariff increases . 
Another increase , he warned , would result in riots in the streets . 
However , [PER Zardari  ] promised to broaden the tax base and implement a Value-added Tax ( VAT ) , as required by the [ORG IMF  ] Stand-by [ORG Arrangement.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] said poverty , uncertainty , and the lack of educational and employment opportunities undermined [LOC Pakistan  ] 's potential as well as his political standing . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he needs a " deal " to show his people that he has something to offer them , and that assistance and trade concessions were prerequisites to " be able to think about [LOC India  ] .
