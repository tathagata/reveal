End Summary . 
Discussion with Justice Minister [PER Bastos  ] ----------------- --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Minister [PER Bastos  ] reiterated that the new [PER Lula  ] administration should be less ideological , saying that sometimes during the first term , some members of the administration had been ideologically still in the stone age . 
He added that the current , new generation of governors , figures such as [PER Eduardo Campos  ] of [LOC Pernambuco  ] , [PER Aecio Neves  ] of [ORG Minas Gerais  ] , and [PER Jose Serra  ] of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , is very business-minded and results-oriented . 
This all leads to a new political environment within [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Turning to bilateral issues , the Ambassador mentioned that the [ORG USG  ] would like to improve the current 3+1 ( [LOC Argentina  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] plus the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) counter-terrorism mechanism to make it more effective . 
Minister [PER Bastos  ] replied that now is an excellent time for that , as he finds that the ministers of justice in the southern cone region as well as [MISC Brazilian  ] governors are much more receptive to integration and cooperation in areas of security and justice than before. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador inquired about the Minister 's expected departure from the cabinet and who he expected would be his successor . 
[PER Bastos  ] replied that he thought President [PER Lula  ] would soon announce that Minister of [ORG Institutional Relations  ] [PER Tarso Genro  ] would be his successor . 
[PER Bastos  ] said that he would move to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , but that he intends to continue his traditional weekly one-on-one meetings with President [PER Lula  ] in an advisory capacity even after he leaves office . 
Comment: This is probably due to the fact that he is his personal attorney . 
End Comment . 
He added that the transition will likely take at least several weeks during which time [PER Bastos  ] will pass several complicated issues to [PER Genro  ] . 
[PER Bastos  ] suggested that while [PER Genro  ] is a member of the [ORG PT  ] party , he is also worldly aware and open-minded , and should be considered a good contact as well , especially in light of the growing importance of issues covered by the [ORG Ministry of Justice.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bastos  ] mentioned that he recently drafted 16 bills that could well have a significant impact on security issues . 
He had passed these measures on to President [PER Lula  ] who is currently reviewing them and should soon be making a public announcement . 
One of the bills would create 14,000 new beds in the [MISC Brazilian  ] prison system so as to increase the GOB 's capacity to keep criminals behind bars . 
The Ambassador mentioned that [ORG DEA  ] Administrator [ORG Tandy  ] would be visiting [LOC Brazil  ] at the end of March and asked [PER Bastos  ] if he would be receptive to meeting her in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ( a proposal to which the Minister agreed . 
) The Ambassador also noted that the [ORG USG  ] would like to pursue an amendment to improve the existing extradition treaty , not to try to draft a new one . 
The Minister agreed that this would be a good idea , that the [ORG MOJ  ] already has people studying this issue , and suggested that Dr. [PER Antenor Madruga  ] , who already has an ongoing relationship with the [ORG USDOJ  ] , be the point of contact for continuing discussions on this . 
Meeting with [ORG MFA U/S  ] [PER Vargas  ] --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With respect to the upcoming POTUS visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , the Ambassador and [PER Vargas  ] agreed that increasing people-to-people contact , through tourism , business , science and technology , and exchanges , would be a worthwhile topic of discussion at the summit . 
The two noted that biofuels would be another key focus of [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000396 002 OF 002 discussion . 
[PER Vargas  ] then added what he said was a wholly personal ( not discussed with others in the GOB yet ) idea about inviting 5-10 heads of state to participate in a dinner at the close of a biofuels conference to be held in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] next year . 
The Ambassador agreed that it would be good to discuss such an initiative at the summit . 
[PER Vargas  ] said he did not have specific information about which regional issues President [PER Lula  ] wished to bring up . 
He said he imagined that [PER Lula  ] would include the [ORG Doha Round  ] in the list of international issues to be discussed . 
When the Ambassador asked whether [PER Lula  ] would bring up the [LOC Middle East  ] , [PER Vargas  ] said it was more likely that FM [ORG Amorim  ] would raise it during his March 8 encounter with the Secretary , but allowed that he could not predict with certainty what [PER Lula  ] would choose to raise with the [MISC President.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador asked if the issue of climate change and deforestation could arise during the March 31 summit at [LOC Camp David  ] . 
[PER Vargas  ] noted that the GOB will be making a presentation at an international conference in [LOC Cairns  ] , [LOC Australia  ] the week of March 5 , adding that the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation had already been in contact with the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation regarding that presentation . 
He opined that [PER Lula  ] might bring up climate change and deforestation within the context of biofuels during the summit in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
For his part , the Ambassador noted the [ORG First Lady  ] 's interest in possibly addressing the theme of malaria , specifically the bed netting initiative . 
[PER Vargas  ] stated that this was a particularly important issue for the rural states of [LOC Rondonia  ] , [LOC Acre  ] , [ORG Mato Grosso  ] and [ORG Amazonas  ] . 
Meeting with [PER Lula  ] Private Secretary [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] ------------------------------ ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The conversation with [PER Carvalho  ] , a member of [PER Lula  ] 's inside circle , touched mostly upon the modalities regarding the March 8-9 POTUS visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and the return March 31 [PER Lula  ] visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Carvalho  ] noted that the GOB was considering staging a business-themed event during the latter trip , possibly in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] or [LOC New York  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] , he said , had a good story to tell with respect to the economy , adding that the President 's second term could see further opening in terms of imports regardless of the outcome of the [ORG Doha Development Round  ] . 
Other than that , [PER Carvalho  ] conceded , [PER Lula  ] staff had not focussed a great deal on the March 31 visit given that the March 8-9 trip would occur first and that was monopolizing their attention . 
[PER Lula  ] , he declared , was busy preparing for his meeting with POTUS in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and very much wanted that event to go well .
