( C ) Charge called [ORG Union Fenosa  ] Vice President and CEO [PER Honorato Lopez Isla  ] on 11/20/07 to find out whether an 11/16/07 [ORG Financial Times  ] story ( " [LOC Tehran  ] in talks with [MISC European  ] companies over big LNG project " ) reporting that an [ORG Union Fenosa  ] subsidiary , [MISC Socoin  ] , had been awarded a euros 32.5 million engineering contract for " [LOC Iran  ] LNG in August " was true . 
[PER Lopez  ] told Charge that the [ORG Financial Times  ] article was accurate , and that he was aware of the article . 
Charge pointed out that the deal was disappointing to the [LOC U.S.  ] because now was not the time for business as usual with [LOC Iran  ] 's oil and gas industry . 
[PER Lopez  ] said that [ORG Union Fenosa  ] had only recently acquired [MISC Socoin  ] and had therefore not been in a position to turn the deal off . 
Moreover the contract was not really an investment . 
The [MISC Socoin  ] contract involved a part in a much bigger study and was similar to work that the company was conducting in [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Oman  ] . 
Nonetheless , [PER Lopez  ] told Charge: " I hear you . 
" The [ORG Union Fenosa  ] CEO said that he would be on travel in the coming days , but that when he came back he wanted to meet with the Charge to discuss [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC Socoin  ] deal is obviously disppointing , but our sense is that we have an opening to influence future [ORG Union Fenosa  ] activity in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG Union Fenosa  ] , unlike other big [MISC Spanish  ] energy companies , does not have major interests in the [LOC U.S.  ] so we doubt the [LOC Iran  ] Sanctions Act would be a signficant deterrent for [ORG Union Fenosa  ] . 
However , [PER Lopez  ] was clearly aware of [LOC U.S.  ] concerns regarding [LOC Iran  ] . 
Like other [MISC Spanish  ] executives , he does not want to be on the wrong side of the [ORG USG  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] 's 2/13/07 meeting with [ORG Repsol  ] CEO [PER Antonio Brufau  ] ( ref B ) , and his breakfast with other major [MISC Spanish  ] businessmen on 5/9/07 ( ref A ) , were probably discussed in wider [MISC Spanish  ] business circles . 
The fact that the [MISC Spanish  ] and international press have reported that [ORG Repsol  ] is not likely to make a final investment decision regarding the [MISC South Pars  ] gas project until diplomatic pressure on [LOC Iran  ] eases has also probably not gone unnoticed .
