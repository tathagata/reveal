End Summary. --------------------------------- Meeting with President-elect [PER Lobo  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The Ambassador and [MISC Honduran  ] President-elect [PER Porfirio  ] " Pepe " [PER Lobo  ] met for coffee at the residence on January 23 and reviewed the latest political and diplomatic developments . 
The meeting took place in the wake of [PER Micheletti  ] 's January 20 decision to take a leave of absence and [PER Lobo  ] 's own successful diplomatic trips to the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] to meet [MISC Dominican  ] President [PER Lionel Fernandez  ] and to [LOC Guatemala  ] for a meeting with [MISC Guatemalan  ] President [PER Colom  ] . 
The following are the main elements of the discussion: <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Visit to the [LOC Dominican Republic:  ] [PER Lobo  ] said he was very pleased with the results of his January 19 visit to the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] . 
He expressed great appreciation for [LOC U.S.  ] support for the efforts by President [PER Fernandez  ] to resolve the issue of President [PER Zelaya  ] 's presence in the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] . 
He discussed the written agreement he had reached with [PER Fernandez  ] whereby [PER Fernandez  ] and [PER Colom  ] would be in [LOC Honduras  ] on January 27 to possibly attend his inauguration and then pick-up [PER Zelaya  ] at the [MISC Brazilian  ] Embassy and escort him out of the country . 
[PER Lobo  ] said that [PER Zelaya  ] would go with [PER Fernandez  ] to the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] and stay there for a time , but that his longer term plan was to settle in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he was committed to providing safe passage to [PER Zelaya  ] to leave the [ORG Embassy  ] and said he had discussed the legal aspects with Attorney General [PER Rubi  ] , since [PER Zelaya  ] faced criminal charges in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
[PER Lobo  ] noted that [PER Rubi  ] had agreed to find a constructive legal way to get this done . 
[PER Lobo  ] ( please protect ) described [PER Fernandez  ] as a " real operator " but very effective . 
He mentioned that [PER Fernandez  ] had asked him to consider rejoining [ORG ALBA  ] saying that such an action would help ease the process of [MISC Honduran  ] reintegration in the [MISC Inter-American  ] system . 
[PER Lobo  ] responded that while he would attempt to maintain the [ORG Petro Caribe  ] arrangement that provided favorable credit terms from [LOC Venezuela  ] for the purchase of hydrocarbons products , he had no intention of bringing [LOC Honduras  ] back into the [MISC Bolivarian  ] alliance. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Political [PER Amnesty: Lobo  ] said he remained committed to securing political amnesty for all of the players involved in the [MISC Honduran  ] political and constitutional crisis , including [PER Zelaya  ] , [PER Micheletti  ] , and the [MISC Honduran  ] military . 
He believed that securing political amnesty legislation provided a platform of stability that would facilitate the work of the [ORG Truth Commission  ] . 
He said approval of this legislation would [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000065 002.2 OF 003 be the first task of the act of [ORG National Party  ] controlled [ORG Congress.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Visit to Guatemala: [PER Lobo  ] said that he had just returned from a successful January 21 visit to [LOC Guatemala  ] for a meeting with President [PER Colom  ] . 
He said President [PER Colom  ] had been very friendly and eager to establish a close working relationship with his new government . 
[PER Colom  ] committed to attend the inaugural ceremony in some manner . 
[PER Colom  ] was considering arriving at the stadium and formally recognizing [PER Lobo  ] 's presidency as soon as [PER Lobo  ] had taken the oath from the new [ORG Congress  ] President [PER Juan Orlando Hernandez  ] . 
He said that [PER Colom  ] had committed himself to attempt to convince [PER Fernandez  ] and possibly Funes to also participate in the inaugural festivities in some way and not just be available to escort [PER Zelaya  ] out of the country. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Presidential [PER Appointments: Lobo  ] said he was also focused on completing the creation of his cabinet . 
He noted that former Ambassador to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( during the [ORG Maduro Administration  ] ) [PER Mario Canahuati  ] would be his foreign minister . 
He said that [PER Canahuati  ] had the experience and knowledge of the [LOC U.S.  ] to serve as his senior foreign policymaker . 
[PER Lobo  ] also said that he would be appointing technocrats [PER William Chong Wong  ] and [PER Maria Elena Mondragon  ] to serve as Minister of Finance and [ORG Central Bank  ] President , respectively . 
He noted that [PER Chong  ] and [PER Mondragon  ] had held these positions in the [ORG Maduro Administration  ] as well . 
He stressed the severity of the [MISC Honduran  ] economic downturn required a veteran team with strong executive experience . 
The Ambassador mentioned his meeting with [ORG Treasury Deputy Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Nancy Lee  ] and the importance of beginning a policy dialogue with his economic team as soon as possible . 
The Ambassador mentioned that he was aware that [PER Chong Wong  ] and [PER Mondragon  ] had already met with [PER Lee  ] in [LOC Washington  ] on January 22. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lobo  ] discussed lobbying by outgoing Defense Chief General [PER Romeo Vasquez Velasquez  ] for the minister of defense . 
Both agreed that although [PER Vasquez Velasquez  ] had been helpful in efforts to implement the [MISC Tegucigalpa-San  ] [PER Jose Accord  ] his direct links to the coup made it impossible for him to remain in the military chain of command . 
[PER Lobo  ] said he had offered the General a position in government such as the [ORG National Electric Company  ] ( [ORG ENEE  ] ) where his executive and managerial ability would be helpful . 
The Ambassador noted that appointing individuals to senior cabinet positions that had direct links to the coup would harm his government and his own efforts to restore strong ties with the international community. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Lobo  ] said he was very pleased that we had been able to convince [MISC Democratic Unification  ] leader [PER Cesar Ham  ] to join his government . 
[PER Ham  ] would be appointed as Director of the [ORG National Agrarian Institute  ] , which is a powerful government agency responsible for land tenure policy and ties to the campesino movement . 
[PER Lobo  ] said [PER Ham  ] 's participation in addition to [MISC Christian Democrat  ] presidential candidate [PER Felicito Avila  ] ( appointed Minister of Labor ) , [ORG PINU  ] standard bearer [PER Bernard Martinez  ] ( Minister of Culture ) , as well as a [ORG Liberal Party  ] member , would ensure a strong multi-party representation in his government . 
[PER Lobo  ] thanked the Ambassador for our active encouragement of [PER Ham  ] , [PER Avila  ] and [PER Martinez  ] to support the new government. ---------------------------------- Conversation with President [PER Arias:  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador spoke to President [PER Arias  ] just prior to his meeting with [PER Lobo  ] . 
[PER Arias  ] reiterated that he was somewhat disappointed with [PER Lobo  ] since he did not believe he had been forceful enough in getting regime leader [PER Micheletti  ] to resign . 
He said he had already vowed not to attend the inauguration and it would be difficult for him to change his [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000065 003.2 OF 003 position now . 
The Ambassador told [PER Arias  ] that no one had done more to seek to restore the constitutional order and to achieve a negotiated and peaceful solution to the crisis than he had . 
The Ambassador pointed out that [LOC Honduras  ] continued to need his support and guidance . 
The Ambassador said that the [LOC U.S.  ] would be sending an official delegation to the inauguration that would probably be led by Assistant Secretary [PER Arturo Valenzuela  ] . 
The Ambassador also briefed [PER Arias  ] on the [PER Fernandez  ] agreement with [PER Lobo  ] to get [PER Zelaya  ] to leave the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and travel to the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] on January 27 . 
[PER Arias  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] presence would be positive and help other countries engage at least after [PER Lobo  ] assumes office . 
[PER Arias  ] said he would take our views into account in terms of [MISC Costa Rican  ] participation in the inauguration , but would most likely ask his ambassador to attend the ceremony . 
The idea of going to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] and escorting [PER Zelaya  ] out of the country was somewhat intriguing to him , but he made no commitments . 
[PER Arias  ] made clear he intended to recognize the newly-elected government and work constructively with [PER Lobo  ] . 
He said he was thinking of inviting [PER Lobo  ] to visit [LOC Costa Rica  ] soon after he assumes office . 
( Note: While the Ambassador was speaking to [PER Arias  ] , [PER Lobo  ] came to the [ORG Residence  ] and [PER Arias  ] expressed interest in speaking directly to [PER Lobo  ] . 
The two chatted amiably for 8-10 minutes . 
[PER Lobo  ] attempted to convince [PER Arias  ] to attend his inauguration and said he intended to provide special recognition for [PER Arias  ] at the ceremony for his crucial role in seeking to resolve the crisis . 
[PER Lobo  ] said that even if he did not attend , he hoped to invite him to [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] in the near future and honor him in some way. ---------------------------------- Conversation with President [PER Zelaya:  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador called President [PER Zelaya  ] to reconfirm that the [LOC U.S.  ] would be sending an official delegation to attend the inauguration . 
The Ambassador noted that we expected [PER A/S Valenzuela  ] to lead our delegation that might also include [ORG NSC Senior  ] Director [PER Dan Restrepo Assistant  ] Secretary for Economic Affairs [PER Jose Fernandez  ] and PDAS [PER Craig Kelly  ] . 
The Ambassador told [PER Zelaya  ] that our delegation would be seeking a meeting with him probably on Tuesday . 
[PER Zelaya  ] said it would be good for the [LOC U.S.  ] to be present in [LOC Honduras  ] for the inauguration and he looked forward to the meeting with [PER Valenzuela  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation . 
He confirmed that he was fully supportive of the [MISC Fernandez-Lobo  ] pact and that he planned to leave [LOC Honduras  ] for the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] on January 27 . 
[PER Zelaya  ] claimed he had encouraged [MISC UD  ] leader [PER Cesar Ham  ] to join [PER Lobo  ] 's government of national unity , which he believed was essential to ensure peace and harmony .
