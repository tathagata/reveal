Key Points: -- ( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG GOE  ] claims to have increased its efforts against [MISC HAMAS-related  ] smuggling activity , and reports recent success in interdicting and dismantling goods and financial smuggling networks. -- ( C ) Recent heavy rains in northern [MISC Sinai  ] caused an estimated $11 million worth of damage . 
Local residents have complained about the [ORG GOE  ] 's slow response and say the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] and other [MISC Islamic  ] organizations have provided the most effective relief services . 
Rains also temporarily halted construction of a subterranean steel wall and reportedly caused damage to the vast network of smuggling tunnels under the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border. -- ( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Security concerns have temporarily suspended installation of the [MISC FMF-funded  ] border tunnel activity detection system ( [ORG BTADS  ] ) , which will delay the scheduled April 2010 completion date . 
[ORG MOD  ] has agreed in principle to accept follow-on support for the [ORG BTADS  ] project. -- ( [ORG SBU  ] ) USAID is still awaiting approval from the [ORG Ministry of International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG MIC  ] ) to begin implementing $50 million in [MISC FY2009 Supplemental  ] funding aimed at creating economic alternatives to smuggling in the [MISC Sinai  ] peninsula. ----------------- Focusing on [ORG HAMAS  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During a recent meeting with Secretary of [ORG Defense Gates  ] , the Director of the [ORG Egyptian General Intelligence Service  ] ( [ORG EGIS  ] ) [PER Omar Soliman  ] said that [LOC Egypt  ] was increasing efforts to combat [MISC HAMAS-related  ] smuggling activity , including bolstering security along the [MISC Sudanese  ] border ( ref A ) . 
He also reported increased effectiveness in tackling smuggling networks in [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , and [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] officials have separately reported recent success at interdicting and dismantling [MISC HAMAS-related  ] goods and money smuggling networks along the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border. --------------------------------- [MISC Sinai Flood Damage Localized.....  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Multiple  ] contacts in northern [MISC Sinai  ] told us that damage from the floods is severe , but localized along and in the [LOC Wadi  ] [LOC El Arish  ] riverbed . 
[PER Osama Kassas  ] , Head of the [LOC North Sinai  ] Businessmen 's Association , which is helping with the rebuilding process , stated that seven people died as a result of the floods and damages are estimated to be around 60 million [MISC Egyptian  ] pounds ( USD 11 million ) . 
He said the flood destroyed the open market , a bus station and the [MISC Olympic  ] village , which housed a branch of the [ORG Ministry of Youth  ] , because the [ORG GOE  ] built them in the riverbed . 
In addition , villages in central [MISC Sinai  ] and residential areas of [LOC El Arish  ] city along the riverbed were severely damaged including the two roads that crossed the riverbed connecting western and eastern [LOC El Arish  ] city . 
Our contacts in [MISC Sinai  ] said 27 houses and 60 businesses were completely destroyed , and 90 houses were severely damaged by water and mud . 
[PER Kassas  ] said approximately 1,200 people were directly affected by the flood. --------------------------------------------- --- But Residents Frustrated with Assistance Efforts --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kassas  ] told us that [MISC Sinai  ] residents were frustrated that the [MISC Egyptian  ] Government had taken two days to respond to the flooding and were hostile toward PM Nazif during his visit to inspect the damage . 
[PER Kassas  ] said the [ORG GoE  ] repaired the two roads and is beginning to provide assistance such as blankets , tents and food . 
However , its efforts are " random and disorganized " with assistance going to those with connections and not those who most need it . 
He stated that most [ORG NGOs  ] and private businesses in [MISC Sinai  ] either do not have the capacity to provide assistance or are focused only on publicity . 
[PER Kassas  ] said the most effective relief efforts are those connected with the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] and other [MISC Islamic  ] organizations . 
( Comment: The [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] does not have a strong organizational presence in northern [MISC Sinai  ] . 
If they are providing relief services , they would have likely deployed people from outside the [MISC Sinai  ] peninsula . 
End Comment ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On January 31 , First [PER Lady Suzanne Mubarak  ] traveled to [LOC North Sinai  ] to see the damage caused by the floods . 
She met with the [LOC North Sinai  ] Governor [PER Mowafi  ] , various ministers and local leaders . 
She said that the [ORG GoE  ] is working to resolve the crisis caused by the floods and begin a " new phase for development " for the region . 
Security forces required those people living in tents due to flood damage to remove the tents and evacuate the area during the visit . 
An 11-truck aid convoy from the [ORG Ministry of Military Production  ] arrived in [LOC El Arish  ] with refrigerators , water heaters , gas cylinders , televisions and domestic electric appliances for flood victims. ---------------------- Flooding and Smuggling ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The January 14 - 19 flooding also temporarily halted construction of a subterranean steel wall along the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border . 
Construction re-started on January 29 . 
The [MISC Egyptian  ] military also reported finding fewer tunnel openings since the rains ( ref B ) , but noted increased activity along the [MISC Palestinian  ] side of the border , which they attributed to repair work on rain-damaged tunnels ( Comment: Even small amounts of rain can cause tunnels to collapse , so a significant amount of flooding would likely cause serious damage . 
End Comment ) . ------------------- USG-Funded Programs ------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC FMF-funded  ] [ORG BTADS  ] project has been on-hold since January 2 due to security concerns ( ref C ) . 
We are currently awaiting MOD-approval to conduct a security assessment of the [LOC Rafah  ] area before redeploying the [ORG Army Corps of Engineers  ] ( [ORG ACE  ] ) . 
On January 31 , [ORG MOD  ] denied [ORG OMC  ] 's most recent request citing undisclosed " security concerns . 
" During a January 11 meeting with Field [PER Marshal Tantawi  ] , Ambassador and [ORG OMC  ] Chief stressed the importance of working together to ensure security concerns are quickly and effectively addressed so installation can resume . 
During the same meeting , Assistant Minister of [ORG Defense Major General Mohammed  ] al-Assar claimed that the project was still on track for a February 2010 completion . 
( Comment: Al-Assar is fully aware that delays will extend completion well beyond April 2010 . 
It is likely that he has not informed [PER Tantawi  ] of the delay originally caused by the Minister 's own insistence on technical modifications for the original [ORG BTADS  ] equipment . 
End Comment ) . 
On January 21 , [ORG MOD  ] did agree in principle to submit a request for follow-on support for the [ORG BTADS  ] project , which will be critical once the [ORG ACE  ] completes the installation and turns the system over entirely to the [MISC Egyptian  ] military. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG EGIS  ] is moving forward , albeit slower than originally anticipated , on a [MISC Nonproliferation  ] and [ORG Disarmament Fund  ] ( [ORG NDF  ] ) financed project to deploy 15 x-ray scanners to inspect vehicular traffic entering the [MISC Sinai for explosives  ] and arms ( ref D ) . 
Representatives from [ORG EGIS  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] are currently in the [LOC United States  ] for operator training . 
[ORG EGIS  ] anticipates that the necessary infrastructure preparations for the first site , the [PER Ahmed Hamdi  ] tunnel , will be completed by late [ORG March/early April.  ] ----------------- [ORG Sinai Development  ] ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador and [ORG AID  ] Director met with Minister of [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG MIC  ] ) [PER Fayza Aboulnaga  ] on February 3 to discuss the $50 million in FY2009 ESF Supplemental funding aimed at improving economic opportunities and employment in the [LOC North Sinai  ] governorate . 
Minister [PER Aboulnaga  ] continued to object to provisions related to project monitoring and audit plans , even though [ORG AID  ] has repeatedly modified the draft assistance agreement in consideration of the special security circumstances in [LOC North Sinai  ] and the [ORG GOE  ] 's desire to minimize the [ORG USG  ] 's profile in the governorate . 
[ORG AID  ] is making one last effort to meet [ORG MIC  ] concerns , but will not compromise on basic , legal requirements to conduct audits and monitor [MISC USG-financed  ] work . 
[ORG AID  ] Director is also scheduled to meet with the new [LOC North Sinai  ] governor to solicit his support for the program .
