( C ) Summary: [MISC Saudi  ] Foreign Ministry officials told visiting [ORG NEA A/S  ] [PER Feltman  ] that they are convinced [LOC Iran  ] intends to develop a nuclear weapon , and that the [MISC Saudi  ] Foreign Minister pressed his counterpart hard for greater [MISC Chinese  ] engagement on this threat during the [MISC Chinese  ] FM 's visit earlier in January . 
While no explicit deal was discussed , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] made it clear it was willing to address [MISC Chinese  ] concerns on energy security and trade in exchange for effective [MISC Chinese  ] support to prevent [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is also concerned about [LOC Iran  ] 's unhelpful role in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
While generally very pleased with the state of bilateral relations , [MISC Saudi  ] officials strenuously - and under instruction - complained about the continued negative effect of the recent [ORG Transportation Safety Administration  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) regulations that call for extra security screening for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] Foreign Minister will raise these concerns with the Secretary in [LOC London  ] on January 27 .

A/S [PER Feltman  ] urged [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to associate itself with the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] by January 31 . 
The [ORG MFA  ] reported that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] donated $50 million for [MISC Haitian  ] relief efforts on January 25 . 
End Summary . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Nuclear Ambitions: - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Visiting [ORG NEA A/S  ] [PER Feltman  ] discussed a wide range of issues with Deputy [MISC Saudi  ] Foreign Minister Dr. [PER Prince Torki Al-Saud Al-Kabir  ] on January 26 . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is convinced that [LOC Iran  ] intends to develop nuclear weapons , and reported that [MISC Saudi  ] Foreign Minister [PER Saud Al-Faisal  ] pressed the [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister on this issue on his January 17 visit . 
[PER Saud Al-Faisal  ] told the [MISC Chinese  ] that , for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , this is a critical security issue . 
[LOC Iran  ] , s getting nuclear weapons will open the door to the rest of the [LOC Middle East  ] pursuing nuclear weapons . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] would prefer that the [LOC Middle East  ] remain a nuclear free zone . 
When the [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister replied that [LOC China  ] will not accept [LOC Iran  ] 's development of nuclear weapons , [PER Saud Al-Faisal  ] told him that [LOC China  ] will have to work more closely with the rest of the world and the [ORG UN Security Council  ] to prevent this from happening. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Prince [PER Torki  ] agreed that it was not helpful that the [MISC Chinese  ] sent a low-level delegation to the most recent 5 1 talks . 
He also agreed it was unfortunate the delegation did not agree it was time now to increase pressure on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Al-Kabir  ] also noted that time was not in the [ORG UN Security Council  ] 's favor , but in [LOC Iran  ] 's . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was convinced the time was ripe to push [LOC China  ] on this issue . 
It would be important to demonstrate that the assurances FM [PER Al-Faisal  ] got were not just from the Foreign Minister , but represented the thinking of the whole government . 
He said that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] repeated these points to the [LOC Chinese  ] [LOC Middle East  ] special envoy , who visited a week later . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has also raised these concerns with [LOC Russia  ] , " which is closer to the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Saudi  ] positions , " and with the Deputy [MISC French  ] Foreign Minister three weeks ago . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] also agreed to work with [LOC Lebanon  ] 's [ORG UN  ] Mission , now on the [ORG Security Council  ] , where it is sure to confront the issue of [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Prince Torki  ] said that [LOC China  ] never directly raised the issue of its concerns about securing sufficient oil supplies , particularly in the event of a cutoff of [MISC Iranian  ] supplies . 
However , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] fully understands [LOC China  ] 's concerns , and in that context , is pleased that the [MISC Chinese  ] Foreign Minister had &successful8 talks with [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Aramco  ] and trade officials about specific commercial and energy issues . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] noted that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has become one of [LOC China  ] 's largest energy suppliers , and has invested billions of dollars in refineries in [LOC China  ] . 
Trade has grown from $140 million a decade ago to $75 billion now , with prospects for further increases . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] concluded by noting that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] knows what concerns [LOC China  ] , and is willing to take actions to address those concerns , but must have [MISC Chinese  ] cooperation in stopping [LOC Iran  ] , s development of nuclear weapons as a quid pro quo . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is encouraging other [LOC Gulf  ] countries to meet with [LOC China  ] to explore similar cooperation , although it expects these countries will seek the same exchange . 
Yemen: - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Prince [PER Torki  ] explained that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] also believes that [LOC Iran  ] is playing an unhelpful role in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Dismissing the need for specific evidence , he said it was hard to explain how the [ORG Houthis  ] , as a poor tribal group , managed to get so much money so quickly to obtain the heavy armaments that they have been using absent the help of some outside group . 
It is also hard , he argued , to explain the striking similarities with techniques that have been used by pro-Iranian groups in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is convinced that [LOC Iran  ] is providing money for poor tribesmen to fight , as well as payments to their families , and is facilitating contact with [LOC Somalia  ] and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said the [MISC Saudi  ] Defense Forces have been impressed how well the [ORG Houthis  ] have fought , displaying advanced training . 
( Note: in a separate meeting , [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] officials echoed many of these assessments in greater detail , septel . 
End Note ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Prince [PER Torki  ] was unequivocal in stating that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has no intention of becoming part of the current conflict between the central government and the [ORG Houthis  ] . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] felt it had to respond , however , after Houthi forces crossed its border . 
He said that it made little sense for the [ORG Houthis  ] to have attacked [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , especially since the [ORG SAG  ] had warned them previously not to . 
He concluded that [LOC Iran  ] was trying to test [MISC Saudi  ] reactions . 
[LOC Yemen  ] does not need [LOC U.S.  ] troops , but does need equipment , training and information , as well as assistance to meet its long-term development challenges . 
He also said that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is very concerned about [ORG Al Qaeda  ] 's continued presence in [LOC Yemen  ] , as it will exploit any opportunity to attack [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
Bilateral Relations: - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] agreed that our bilateral relations are quite strong in general . 
He singled out counter-terrorism as an example of the strength of cooperation , noting that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] enjoys a unique level of cooperation on security with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Prince [PER Torki  ] confirmed that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had contributed $50 million to the [LOC Haiti  ] relief effort on January 25 , which is the largest contribution to date of any [MISC Middle Eastern  ] country . 
He also welcomed greater [LOC U.S.  ] engagement in multilateral and international organizations . 
Climate Change: - - - - - - - - 8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER A/S Feltman  ] noted the importance that the President places on Climate Change , and the [ORG Copenhagen Accord  ] . 
Given that Minister of [ORG Petroleum Al-Naimi  ] was involved in crafting the final agreement , [PER A/S Feltman  ] noted the [LOC United States  ] is counting on [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to associate itself with the accord by January 31 . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was very pleased the [LOC United States  ] was more actively engaged in this issue , and said that the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] supports trying to address this issue . 
He noted that the MFA will have to consult with other involved ministries , such as the [ORG Ministry of Petroleum  ] , and promised to respond before January <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
Concern over [ORG TSA  ] Regulations: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Prince [PER Torki  ] noted he had been instructed to raise [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's significant concern about the [ORG TSA  ] regulations which had included [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] in a limited group of countries for additional airport screening . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said that this issue had caused a lot of difficulties and embarrassment for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , to the degree that Foreign Minister [PER Saud Al-Faisal  ] will raise this with the Secretary in [LOC London  ] on January 27 . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was not upset about the regulation itself , as it recognized the [LOC U.S.  ] right and obligation to protect its citizens . 
The issue , rather , was inclusion on the list with the likes of [LOC Cuba  ] , which causes [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's friends and enemies to question how strong its bilateral relationship with the [LOC United States  ] really is . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said it is very hard to explain to the [MISC Saudi  ] public why they are included on this list , despite not being the origin of the December 25 flight , while other countries that have had recent terrorist incidents on planes , like the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] , are not . 
[PER Prince Torki  ] said that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had been shocked to be included on the list . 
He noted that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had been told these provisions would only be temporary , and said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] would like to know how and when they will be amended , implying that the longer they remained in effect without any public explanation from the [ORG USG  ] , the more it was likely to prompt the [MISC Saudi  ] Government to re-evaluate areas of cooperation , including counter-terrorism cooperation . 
[PER A/S Feltman  ] promised to convey the spirit and strength of the message , and invited any specific [MISC Saudi  ] suggestions to address the security gap regarding nonmetallic explosives exploited in the December 25 incident . 
[LOC Middle East  ] Peace: - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In response to a question , [PER A/S Feltman  ] explained that the [LOC United States  ] believes that we need to get the [MISC Israelis  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] back to the negotiating table , which will be the best way to compel [LOC Israel  ] to follow through on its public statements and to overcome [MISC Palestinian  ] skepticism . 
[PER A/S Feltman  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] had referred to the 1967 lines with swaps as a way of helping encourage the [MISC Palestinians  ] to return to the table . 
Prince [PER Torki  ] welcomed this overview . 
( U ) This cable has been cleared by [PER A/S Feltman  ] .
