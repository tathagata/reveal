2006 [LOC CAIRO  ] 6600 Classified By: Minister-Counselor for [ORG Economic and Political Affairs  ] , [PER William R. Stewart  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In a recent meeting with poloff , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] parliamentarian [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] discussed presidential son [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] 's possible succession of his father , and opined that [PER Gamal  ] increasingly views Minister of Defense [PER Mohamed Hussein Tantawi  ] and [ORG EGIS  ] head [PER Omar Suleiman  ] as a threat to his presidential ambitions . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] alleged that [PER Tantawi  ] recently told him , in confidence , of his deepening frustration with [PER Gamal  ] . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- [PER GAMAL  ] ANGLING TO " GET RID " OF HIS COMPETITION --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On March 29 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted to poloff his assessment that the recently approved constitutional amendments package is largely aimed at ensuring [PER Gamal  ] [PER Mubarak  ] 's succession of his father , and " a more controllable , stable political scene when he does take the reins . 
" Opining that " [PER Gamal  ] and his clique " are becoming more confident in the inevitability of [PER Gamal  ] 's succession , and are now angling to remove potential " stumbling blocks , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that speculation among [LOC Cairo  ] 's elite is that there could be a cabinet reshuffle as soon as May or June , in which Minister of Defense [PER Tantawi  ] and/or [ORG EGIS  ] head [PER Omar Suleiman  ] would be replaced . 
" Those two are increasingly viewed as a threat by [PER Gamal  ] and those around him , " and thus [PER Gamal  ] is reportedly pushing [PER Mubarak  ] to get them out of the way , so they " could not pose any problems " in the event of a succession . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that " hitches " to a [PER Gamal  ] succession could occur if [PER Mubarak  ] died before installing his son: " [PER Gamal  ] knows this , and so wants to stack the deck in his favor as much as possible now , while [PER Mubarak  ] is firmly in control , just in case his father drops dead sooner rather than later . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had commented to him in a recent private meeting that , " he has had it 'up to here' with [PER Gamal  ] and his cronies , and the tremendous corruption they are facilitating . 
" " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told me he is having trouble sleeping at night , " he continued , " and that he cannot stand what has happened to the country , and what may yet happen to the country . 
" Disappointed by the recent constitutional amendments , and skeptical about the will of either [PER Mubarak  ] or [PER Gamal  ] to push forward meaningful political reforms , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he viewed a post-Mubarak military coup as " the best possible way out for [LOC Egypt  ] ... we are in a terrible spot , and that is the best of all the bad options available . 
" ( Note: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] provided no further details about a possible coup scenario , and appeared to simply be theorizing about the future . 
To date , we have not heard other interlocutors speculate about a possible coup option . 
End note ) . ---------------------------- CURRENT GOSSIP IN PARLIAMENT ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that parliamentarians are abuzz over rumors that , under newly amended constitutional [ORG Article  ] 136 ( which now gives the president the ability to dissolve the [ORG People 's Assembly  ] by executive decree alone , without a national referendum ) , the [ORG People , s Assembly  ] will be dissolved in roughly a year , so as to rid it of the " troublesome " 88 [ORG Muslim Brotherhood MP  ] 's . 
New elections would then be held , but " as under the new constitutional amendments , there will be no direct judicial supervision of elections to help to guard against fraud , the government can be expected to engineer the results " so that there are far fewer [ORG MB  ] MP , s in the new parliament . 
" The government is happy to deal with fairly tame and non-threatening oppositionists such as [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , Wafd , and [ORG Taggamu  ] . 
But they do not want such a powerful bloc of [ORG MB  ] MP , s to remain , particularly when they would make the most noise in the event of a [PER Gamal  ] succession . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In terms of his personal political aspirations , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told poloff he has [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , founded by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------------------- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that hisXXXXXXXXXXXX ( per ref B , a [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) , is [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] at the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , due to what [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] termed the continuing [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , MinDef [PER Tantawi  ] called him [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to ensure that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was satisfied as to how [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was being [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he engaged [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , asking him to help get [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , as he has already [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] allegedly checked with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , then replied that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cannot be [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] before he [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , as , " we are under terrible foreign pressure to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , so cannot [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , as they will then criticize us for not [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] too . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] subsequent suggestion to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] both [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] went unheeded . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] allegedly told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he had instructed [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to not undertake any procedures to divest [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of his [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ; [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] therefore believes [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] will be able to re-assume [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Comment: While [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is a useful interlocutor and a well-placed parliamentarian , we stress that he is the only Embassy contact to date who has raised with us the spectre of a post-Mubarak military coup . 
While discussion of presidential succession is a favorite parlor game in [LOC Cairo  ] salons , hypothesizing about the acutely sensitive topic of a coup is certainly not regularly undertaken in [MISC Egyptian  ] circles .
