( C ) Summary . 
Ambassador [PER Hugueney  ] of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) told Ambassador June 6 that [LOC U.S.  ] pharmaceutical companies should improve their offers on pricing and/or voluntary licenses for [MISC AIDS  ] treatment drugs so as to avoid compulsory licensing by the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( [ORG MoH  ] ) . 
[PER Hugueney  ] believed movement in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] of legislation that would deny patentability to [MISC AIDS  ] drugs was likely intended to provide greater leverage to the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] in its negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies . 
The bill 's broad political backing , he observed , makes a presidential veto unlikely should the legislation pass . 
On the [ORG WTO Doha Round of trade  ] negotiations , [PER Hugueney  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] will submit a " substantially improved " revised services offer the week of June 6 . 
[PER Hugueney  ] expects to take up the post of [LOC Brazil  ] 's Ambassador to the [ORG WTO  ] by late August or early September . 
[PER Hugueney  ] confirmed [LOC Brazil  ] 's plan to attend the June 21 to 22 [ORG US-EU International Conference  ] on [LOC Iraq  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) On June 6 , Ambassador met with [PER Clodoaldo Hugueney  ] , [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's Under Secretary for [ORG Economic  ] and [ORG Technological Affairs  ] , to discuss a number of trade issues , principally , pending legislation that would render drugs to prevent and treat [MISC AIDS  ] un-patentable , and the continuing threat of compulsory licensing facing the [LOC U.S.  ] pharmaceutical companies [ORG Gilead Sciences  ] , [ORG Abbott Laboratories  ] , and [ORG Merck  ] , [ORG Sharp & Dohme  ] for their [MISC AIDS  ] treatment drugs ( ref A ) . 
[PER Hugueney  ] was accompanied by his assistant , [PER Miguel Franco  ] , and [PER Otavio Brandelli  ] , Chief of the [ORG Ministry 's IPR Division  ] . 
Ecouns , Commoff , and Econoff accompanied Ambassador . 
[ORG AIDS Drugs  ] - Compulsory License Threat and Patent Legislation <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Hugueney  ] , who had just returned from [LOC Doha  ] negotiations in [LOC Geneva  ] , said [ORG Itamaraty  ] is following [ORG MoH  ] negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies closely and described them as boiling down to issues of pricing or voluntary license/royalty payments . 
He noted the intense pressure the GoB is under from civil society , particularly NGOs , to issue compulsory licenses . 
[PER Hugueney  ] agreed the best outcome would be to avoid compulsory licenses , but opined that to do so would require improved offers on price or voluntary licensing from the companies . 
( Upon relaying this message to the companies , the [ORG Merck  ] representative here told us his company was in the process of preparing a more detailed offer , although he did not say that it would be more forthcoming on prices . 
As for [ORG Gilead  ] and [ORG Abbott  ] , they have taken [PER Hugueney  ] 's suggestion " under advisement . 
" ) [PER Hugueney  ] further advised the companies to maintain a dialog with the [ORG MoH  ] to forestall precipitous , politically motivated action by that [ORG Ministry ,  ] and encouraged them to explain/present their proposals to a wide array of GoB interlocutors. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) When questioned by Ambassador on whether an agreement between the [ORG MoH  ] and the pharmaceutical companies would effectively kill pending legislation on patentability of [MISC AIDS  ] drugs , [PER Hugueney  ] demurred on a definitive response , but said he did see the two as linked . 
[PER Hugueney  ] recounted an interview on the [ORG O Globo  ] news the prior evening in which the bill 's author prefaced his statements by saying the legislation had been given renewed impetus in order to provide greater leverage to the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] in its negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies . 
( Note: On June 1 , the [LOC Constitution  ] and [ORG Justice Committee  ] of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] approved a previously dormant bill ( [ORG PL22/2003  ] ) which will exclude from patentability drugs used for the prevention and treatment of [MISC AIDS  ] , and the production processes for their manufacture ; the bill will now go directly to the [ORG Senate  ] unless a request to place the bill before the [ORG Chamber plenary  ] is made by 51 deputies within the next five sessions . 
The bill 's language is very general , leaving open for debate whether or not it would be retroactive , and its scope , i.e. does it cover drugs not only for treating [MISC AIDS  ] , but also for treating any type of malady afflicting [MISC AIDS  ] patients , is similarly unclear . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Although the [PER Lula  ] administration has not formally endorsed the legislation , [PER Hugueney  ] noted it had wide political backing in the [ORG Chamber  ] and warned against assuming the bill would move slowly in the [ORG Senate  ] . 
( Note: although the [LOC Planalto  ] has not endorsed the bill , the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] has publicly lobbied for its passage . 
) In [PER Hugueney  ] 's view , the companies' best hope for a satisfactory outcome would be to work toward a resolution of the licensing issue with the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] , rather than allow the legislature to set patent parameters . 
He underlined the importance of stopping the legislation within the [ORG Congress  ] , admitting that political factors would prevent a presidential veto. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Brandelli  ] reported that the [ORG National Confederation of Industries  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) was working to mobilize the necessary number of deputies to request that the bill be considered within the [ORG Chamber plenary  ] ; if successful , this would considerably slow down the approval process -- aside from a full legislative agenda the [ORG Chamber is  ] also currently seized with a number of scandals involving [MISC Brazilian  ] congressmen -- and allow for a broader debate on the bill 's demerits . 
According to [PER Brandelli  ] , [ORG CNI  ] is also willing to work directly with the [LOC U.S.  ] pharmaceutical companies to devise a strategy for dealing with the [ORG MoH  ] 's compulsory licensing threat. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In a follow-up conversation with Econoff , [PER Brandelli  ] reiterated [PER Hugueney  ] 's comments regarding the need for the companies to respond to [ORG MoH  ] pricing or voluntary licensing interests saying that investment plans are welcome , but do not address the immediate issues . 
[ORG Gilead  ] has been in close communication with [PER Brandelli  ] and he openly praised the company 's proposal , which offers substantial concessions on pricing ; he described [ORG Abbott  ] 's investment plan as great for 2007 , but containing nothing concrete for the [ORG MoH  ] today . 
[ORG Merck  ] reps have not yet requested a meeting with [PER Brandelli  ] , but did speak with Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] 's [ORG Economic Advisor Antonio Simoes  ] on May 30 as part of a [MISC Brazil-U.S  ] . 
[ORG Business Council  ] delegation . 
When Econoff suggested to [PER Brandelli  ] that no pricing plan may satisfy the [ORG MoH  ] if its overriding interest is actually licensing , he pointed out that should the companies need to pursue recourse through [MISC Brazilian  ] courts , they will have to demonstrate their good faith efforts in the negotiations to address the [ORG MoH  ] 's underlying concerns , which the ministry has identified as reliability of supply and pricing. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Brandelli  ] suggested the companies approach the Minister of Science and Technology , [PER Eduardo Campos  ] , as another possible GoB ally . 
Despite [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's advice to engage a number of GoB interlocutors , [PER Brandelli  ] admitted to Econoff that an inter-ministerial working group is being sidelined in the deliberations , which are principally between the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] and the [LOC Casa Civil  ] , i.e. , the office of the President 's Chief of Staff . 
WTO [MISC Doha  ] Negotiations <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Hugueney  ] expressed disappointment with a lack of leadership and organization in the agriculture negotiations the week of May 30 , and stressed the substantial amount of work that must be completed to formulate a " first approximation " by the end of July . 
He said the process would require sustained ministerial involvement since " high level officials " appear unable to make key decisions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador provided [PER Hugueney  ] with information pertaining to submission of the [LOC U.S.  ] revised services offer ( ref B ) . 
[PER Hugueney  ] described the [MISC Brazilian  ] revised services offer , which will be tabled later in the week , as a major improvement , including such sectors as financial , telecommunications , engineering , maritime services , among others . 
As in the past , he cautioned that [LOC Brazil  ] 's ability to be forthcoming in services and industrial products ( [ORG NAMA  ] ) negotiations will depend on advances in the agricultural talks. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hugueney  ] is slated to leave his post as [LOC Brazil  ] 's chief capital-based WTO negotiator to take up the post of [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador to the WTO . 
His nomination is tentatively scheduled to go before the [ORG Senate  ] Foreign [ORG Affairs Committee  ] the week of June 13 before being forwarded for a plenary vote . 
If all goes smoothly , Ambassador [PER Hugueney  ] plans to take up his post in [LOC Geneva  ] in late August or early September . 
U.S.-Brazil Soybean Discussions <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Due to his [ORG Senate  ] confirmation hearings , Ambassador [PER Hugueney  ] will not attend the June 16 bilateral discussions in [LOC Washington  ] on soybean support . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation will be led by [PER Elisabeth Serodio  ] , Secretary of [ORG International Affairs  ] in the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] ; other participants include [PER Flavio Damico  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty Agriculture  ] and [ORG Basic Products Division  ] ) , and representatives of [ORG ICONE ( Institute for International Trade Negotiations  ] ) as well as the private sector . 
[PER Hugueney  ] described the upcoming [LOC Washington  ] session as a great opportunity for both sides to clear the air on soybean subsidies , and appeared upbeat on the chances for success of the talks . 
[ORG Iraq Conference  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador delivered Ref C demarche on the June 21-22 [ORG US-EU International Conference  ] on [LOC Iraq  ] in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
[PER Hugueney  ] confirmed [LOC Brazil  ] 's plan to attend and assured Ambassador the [ORG GoB  ] would take into consideration the points of the demarche . 
Comment <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) We are encouraging the [LOC U.S.  ] pharmaceutical companies to explore working with [ORG CNI  ] on a strategy for better informing the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] about the potential negative consequences of both compulsory licensing and exempting [MISC AIDS  ] drugs from patent coverage . 
However , as [PER Hugueney  ] 's comments testify , the debate over patent protection for [MISC AIDS  ] drugs is highly political , complicating the [ORG GoB  ] 's ability to manage the issue as well as the [ORG Mission  ] 's ability to engage the key [ORG GoB  ] decision-makers , which appear to be in the Presidency . 
( Indeed , the [ORG Abbott  ] representative told us that according to his contacts , the impetus for licensing is coming from President [PER Lula  ] himself ; a high-level delegation from the company may seek an appointment directly with the president on this issue . 
) And notwithstanding assurances by Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Jose Dirceu  ] that he would consult with [ORG Mission  ] concerning any compulsory licensing decision ( ref D ) , Post believes that at any moment political forces could align so as to prompt precipitous action by the [ORG GoB.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Post understands that USTR is reviewing legal implications for [LOC Brazil  ] 's international obligations of both potential compulsory licensing and eventual passage of the patent legislation ; [LOC Washington  ] may want to start considering a range of potential reactions , bearing in mind that allies on this issue do exist within the [ORG GoB  ] . 
We would welcome guidance on the process/procedures the [ORG GoB  ] would have to follow should it decide to go the compulsory licensing route . 
It is ironic that this potential clash on patent rights comes just as cooperation by the [ORG GoB  ] in the area of copyright enforcement is finally showing substantial improvement .
