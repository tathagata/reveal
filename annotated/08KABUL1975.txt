SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) On July 29 , President [PER Karzai  ] gave the Ambassador a plan for negotiations with the [ORG Taliban  ] that he had received from [ORG Taliban  ] reconcilees ( SEPTEL ) . 
In a meeting arranged by the presidency at our request the next day , prominent ex-Taliban said they are well-placed to mediate reconciliation with the insurgency , but argued they are hampered from doing so by their inclusion on [ORG U.N. List  ] 1267 . 
In earlier discussions , former [ORG Taliban  ] government officials told us they reject [PER Mullah Omar’s  ] fanaticism , rigidity and alliance with [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , but that they fear the [ORG Taliban  ] are in the ascendant and becoming more extreme . 
They stressed they accept the current constitution in general , but do want amendments to make clear the primacy of [MISC Islam  ] . 
Presidency Wants to Exploit Ex-Taliban as Mediators --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On July 30 , Deputy [ORG National Security Advisor Engineer Ibrahim Spinzada  ] , who is seeking [LOC U.S.  ] support in convincing [LOC Russia  ] to allow removal of names from [ORG United Nations List  ] 1267 , responded to our earlier request to arrange a meeting for Political Officers with reconcilees from the former [ORG Taliban  ] government . 
He convoked to the meeting ex-Foreign Minister [PER Maulavi Ahmad Mutawakkil  ] , the [ORG Taliban  ] nominee for ambassador to the [ORG United Nations  ] [PER Abdul Hakim Mujadid  ] ( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG Taliban  ] regime was never accepted as sovereign by a preponderance of the world community ) , ex-Ambassador to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] [PER Habibullah Fawzi  ] , and ex-Deputy Education Minister and current [MISC Afghan  ] Senator [PER Arsala Rahmani.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The four ex-Taliban mentioned the plan for negotiations that had been given to President [PER Karzai  ] , and , without referring directly to its text , emphasized several key points: -- Force alone cannot defeat the [ORG Taliban  ] in either [LOC Afghanistan  ] or [LOC Pakistan  ] , but since the roots of [ORG Taliban  ] insurgency lie in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , resolution of conflict here would undermine [ORG Taliban  ] rebellion in the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] ; -- If the [ORG Taliban  ] are reconciled , allied opposition groups , including those led by [PER Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  ] or the [LOC Haqqanis  ] , would disappear ; -- Ex-Taliban are an unused resource for President [PER Karzai  ] and the international community , since they alone have access to both political leaders and command levels of the insurgency , and are willing to mediate in negotiations ; -- There should be no preconditions for negotiations , which could take place in the [LOC Gulf  ] or [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , or in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the presence of international forces ; -- Negotiations should be an incremental process , avoiding initially issues such as ceasefire or the prison at [LOC Guantanamo  ] , and stressing instead the cessation of [ORG Taliban  ] attacks on [ORG NGOs  ] , schools or roads , government commitment to minimize civilian casualties and good-will detainee releases ; -- Reconcilees represent a silent majority in the [ORG Taliban  ] who simply want to end the war , and had publicly accepted the constitution though they would favor amendments to enhance the constitutional role of [MISC Islam  ] ; -- Negotiations , reconciliation and restoration of security can and should be followed by elections , and some ex-Taliban would like to be candidates . 
-- Only when key moderates are removed from the 1267 List will they have the credibility needed to convince insurgents they can guarantee agreements they broker with [PER Karzai  ] or the international community . 
Ex-Taliban Moderates as an [ORG Inchoate Movement  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the weeks leading up to our July 30 meeting , we established contact with numerous senior ex-Taliban . 
We provide the paragraphs below to give a sense of what they are thinking about how to end the insurgency and how best to achieve democratic -- but [MISC Islamic  ] -- governance. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] aide [PER Waheed Mujda  ] has written a book on the [ORG Taliban  ] ( “Ahmed [PER Rashid  ] wrote from the outside , but I wrote from inside” ) . 
In the summer of 2001 , he says he went to the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in [LOC Islamabad  ] to warn that [ORG Al Qaeda  ] planned to use “massive explosives” to attack the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mujda  ] repots that immediately after 9/11 , the [ORG Taliban  ] began to fracture over the wisdom and morality of attacking civilians , over lost economic opportunities if the [ORG Taliban  ] isolated itself from the [LOC West  ] , and over dangers to be faced if the [LOC U.S.  ] occupied [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
There was also concern about growing reliance on Pakistan’s [ORG ISI  ] and deepening ties to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] . 
[PER Mujda  ] hoped at the time that the [LOC U.S.  ] would wait to attack the [ORG Taliban  ] , since he predicted there would be “within the year” a definitive split between urban intellectuals led by Foreign Minister [PER Mutawakkil  ] , and [PER Mullah Omar’s  ] village-based obscurantists . 
After the [LOC U.S.  ] “installed” [PER Karzai  ] , though , he saw moderates’ chances evaporating , while many lower-ranking [ORG Taliban  ] with little commitment to either [PER Mutawakkil  ] or [PER Mullah Omar  ] proved opportunistic , waiting simply to see if the international community and [PER Karzai  ] could govern. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mujda  ] lamented that [PER Karzai  ] named governors who harassed ex-Taliban of all ranks rather than open a dialog . 
Meanwhile , [PER Mujda  ] alleged , international forces committed atrocities , such as breaking down doors and searching women , that “even the [MISC Soviets  ] taught soldiers to avoid.” Afraid of “death or Guatanamo , ” some moderates concluded they had n alternative but to return to [PER Mullah Omar  ] . 
Wth the war ongoing , he contends , the [ORG Taliban  ] as expanded its original commitments to “sharia , security and territorial integrity , ” to enompass an international dimension including demands that the [LOC U.S.  ] leave [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
Civilian Casualties and “Hunger Suicides” ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG Taliban’s Attorney General  ] , [PER Maulavi Jalal-u-Din Shinwari  ] , agrees the [ORG Taliban  ] is growing even more militant . 
[ORG Taliban  ] ideologues have no serious doctrinal competition , he complained: the [ORG Karzai-allied Ulema Council  ] is slow and inactive , meeting “only once a year , and that’s in the presidential palace.” Since moderates have limited effective intellectual or spiritual leadership , the [ORG Taliban  ] and hardline mullahs in [LOC Pakistan  ] have commandeered the right to define jihad , and channeled the jihadi impulse into “radical and violent forms.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Shinwari  ] lambasted international forces for repeated civilian casualty incidents , which make the [ORG Taliban’s  ] recruiting and ideological tasks easier . 
These “indiscriminate attacks” enable the [ORG Taliban  ] to argue the [LOC U.S.  ] does not care about [MISC Afghans  ] or [MISC Islam  ] , and that [PER Karzai  ] is in complicity with the [LOC U.S.  ] or incapable of curbing [LOC U.S.  ] excesses . 
As if this intense anger were not enough , he sputtered , there is also the despair of deepening poverty and inequality , creating for the first time “hunger suicides , ” who kill and die either to collect a [ORG Taliban  ] payment or simply to lighten the economic burden on their families by removing one more mouth to feed . 
Not a Loose [PER Cannon  ] ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Parliamentary Deputy [PER Mullah Abdul Salaam Rocketi  ] , whose name derives from his deft touch with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher , warns that the [LOC U.S.  ] has not carefully identified its enemies . 
If the [LOC U.S.  ] continues to “fight everyone , ” including [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , [PER Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  ] and both [ORG Taliban  ] radicals and moderates , then he warns we cannot win , and that [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Iran  ] or [LOC Russia  ] will dominate [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Rocketi  ] counsels that “Karzai is lost , ” a feckless ally for the [LOC U.S.  ] whose cabinet , he argues , is driven by members’ separate and competing interests , unconcerned by the public’s needs . 
On the infrequent occasions when [PER Karzai  ] works up the courage or is forced to “fire the thieves , ” [PER Rocketi  ] mutters , “he just replaces them with new thieves.” Karzai’s failure , he concludes , is “expanding the [ORG Taliban’s  ] once narrow doors of entry into wide gates.” The [LOC U.S.  ] must identify who within the [ORG Taliban  ] is moderate or amenable to dialog , and work with them to seek peace and agree on how [LOC Afghanistan  ] is to be governed . 
Alternatives to [PER Mullah Omar  ] --------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Two figures generally recognized as heading the ex-Taliban moderates are ex-Foreign Minister [PER Mutawakkil  ] , and ex-Ambassador to [LOC Pakistan  ] [PER Abdul Salim Zaef  ] , who spent four years at [LOC Guantanamo  ] and whom some see as the stronger of the two . 
We talked to them separately in late [LOC July.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Mutawakil  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] must realize there are two kinds of reconciliation . 
One , which he calls the [LOC U.S.  ] strategy , is designed to entice insurgents into supporting [PER Karzai  ] . 
The other , he distinguished , is designed to end the war and achieve an understanding between the two warring [MISC Afghan  ] sides . 
The war is being driven by foreign allies , he explained , but the [LOC U.S.  ] on one side and [ORG Al Qaeda  ] on the other have their own priorities . 
[PER Mutawakil  ] said he had advised [PER Karzai  ] to carry out negotiations with the insurgency , but to aim for incremental progress , concentrating first on small resolvable issues . 
Further , he had told [PER Karzai  ] , any negotiations must be conducted in private , with no interfering media coverage . 
The mediators , he half-joked , can be only “those whom neither the government nor [ORG Taliban  ] want to be killed , ” and who maintain impartial contact with both warring sides . 
To make mediation possible , [PER Zaef  ] and [PER Mutawakkil  ] agree , [ORG U.N.  ] 1267 restrictions must be lifted. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Mutawakkil  ] and [PER Zaef  ] believe firmly that the international community is distancing itself irreparably from ordinary [MISC Afghans  ] . 
[PER Mutawakkil  ] argues that , as the [MISC U.S.-led  ] coalition intensifies military operations , it drives the [ORG Taliban  ] to seek self-preservation by attaching itself more closely to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] and the [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG ISI  ] . 
[PER Zaef  ] warns that the [LOC U.S.  ] lacks cultural knowledge and sensitivity necessary to run [LOC Afghanistan  ] through [PER Karzai  ] , and that given the difficulty of running legitimate and credible elections , it should allow the transfer of governing authority to a [PER Loya Jirga  ] . 
He warns that to be effective and bring peace , the members of this [PER Jirga  ] cannot be named by [PER Karzai  ] or seen to be puppets of the [LOC U.S.  ] , and that they should be named by a pre-Jirga representing tribal and religious leaders from the entire country . 
He says there should also be a jirga commission to discuss “flaws” in the current constitution. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Mutawakkil  ] elaborated on what the [MISC Afghan  ] constitution should be like . 
Democracy , he stipulated , is a means to a better and peaceful life , and is not a means in itself . 
An [MISC Islamic  ] base can be built for a better life , and the [ORG Taliban’s  ] biggest mistake was in not understanding the need to avoid meddling in private lives . 
The [ORG Department for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice  ] did not understand proportionality: it used major force and applied severe punishments for even minor violations , and in so doing lost public confidence. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The constitution , [PER Mutawakkil  ] continued , is as it stands now “a piece of paper , ” which even Karzai’s nominal allies and opponents in Parliament fail to respect . 
He thinks the constitution should be amended to garner wider respect . 
The primary article to be amended is the commitment to freedom of religion , since [MISC Islam  ] must be acknowledged as paramount . 
This would not affect the country’s [MISC Hindus  ] and [MISC Sikhs  ] ( “there are no [MISC Afghan  ] Christians and only one [MISC Jew”  ] ) , who would continue to be allowed freedom of religion . 
No [MISC Muslim  ] , though , [PER Mutawakkil  ] continued , could be allowed to abandon [MISC Islam  ] without punishment in the form of prison or banishment .
