End summary . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Deputy Secretary explained [LOC U.S.  ] objectives for the October 1 [ORG P5-plus-1 Political Directors  ] meeting with [LOC Iran.  ] xxxxx outlined actions in support of the pillars of confidence building and transparency that [LOC Iran  ] needed to undertake to establish its seriousness in addressing the nuclear issue . 
On process objectives , the Deputy Secretary noted that the nuclear issue would need to remain the primary subject in follow-up experts meetings , although other agenda topics were possible. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) xxxxx . 
Based on [MISC Chinese  ] communications with [LOC Iran  ] , xxxxx , xxxxx thought it would be difficult for [LOC Iran  ] to refuse talks , since entering into dialogue was the only way to diffuse tensions. xxxxx was less certain about the prospect of [LOC Tehran  ] giving up its nuclear program. xxxxx asserted that because the weapons program was " not quite there yet " and the facilities were all dual-use in nature , [LOC Iran  ] 's assertions that the program was for peaceful use were " 50-percent true . 
" The key , according to xxxxx , was monitoring and supervision , while establishing benchmarks that [LOC Iran  ] should not cross. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) xxxxx suggested that the first objective of the October 1 meeting with [LOC Iran  ] should be to keep the dialogue alive. xxxxx asked that the [LOC United States  ] not reject [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to broaden the conversation or create the impression that the talks were not making progress . 
Noting that President [PER Obama  ] had told President [PER Hu Jintao  ] that resolving the [LOC Iran  ] situation was a pressing [LOC U.S.  ] interest , xxxxx asked how long the [LOC United States  ] would remain patient in the face of limited progress. xxxxx expressed hope that " domestic political pressure " would not lead the [LOC United States  ] to seek new [ORG UN Security Council  ] sanctions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The Deputy Secretary stated that domestic political factors were not driving our approach to [LOC Iran  ] , but rather a [LOC Beijing  ] 00002963 002 of 002 conviction -- shared by [LOC Britain  ] and [LOC France  ] -- of the need to resolve the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear problem . 
The nuclear issue needed to be discussed up front in talks ; the process could not stay alive without [LOC Iran  ] committing to some confidence-building measures . 
Monitoring and supervision were not adequate , as the [MISC North Korean  ] case had demonstrated . 
[ORG POTUS Visit  ] ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) xxxxx asked that the upcoming [ORG POTUS  ] visit reflect the balanced , comprehensive nature of the relationship , including economic , security , cultural , economic and people-to-people ties . 
A joint statement should not be too detailed and should instead mirror the status of two of the world 's most important leaders . 
That said , the statement had to address , in a positive way , both countries' " core " interests. xxxxx expressed worry that the early-December [LOC Copenhagen  ] climate change meetings could overshadow the [ORG POTUS  ] visit , and recommended that [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] focus during the visit on our respective national commitments in the realm of climate change. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) xxxxx raised xxxxx proposal for a " humanities " [ORG MOU  ] that would cover people-to-people , cultural , and science and technology exchanges , saying xxxxx hoped to make this one of the " gems " of the visit. xxxxx suggested that the presidents sign the clean energy and environmental protection [ORG MOU  ] . 
[MISC G-20  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) xxxxx thanked President [PER Obama  ] for his leadership in institutionalizing the [MISC G-20  ] , which had created a " comfortable " platform for countries like [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] to play a larger role. xxxxx explained that there had been some domestic criticism of President [PER Hu  ] 's participation in the [LOC G8-plus-5.  ] xxxxx expressed hope that the [LOC United States  ] would coordinate closely with [LOC China  ] as we established new rules for the organization , and that it would not become an organization that duplicated the [ORG United Nations  ] or the [MISC G-8.  ] xxxxx expressed reservations about how fast the [MISC G-20  ] could expand to handle issues beyond economics and finance , but noted that if the organization was going to stay relevant for leaders it 's scope would have to grow. xxxxx specifically mentioned the need for a coordinating mechanism on global diseases and counter-terrorism . 
[LOC North Korea  ] ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) xxxxx downplayed Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] 's upcoming October 4-6 visit to [LOC Pyongyang  ] , stating " we may not like them , " but " they ( the [MISC DPRK  ] ) are a neighbor , " and the trip was part of the 60th anniversary of relations celebrations. xxxxx stated that the Premier would convey a strong message on the need to denuclearize , to come back to the [MISC Six-Party  ] talks , and to not abandon the [MISC Six-Party Talks  ] framework. xxxxx noted that [LOC North Korea  ] often tried to play [LOC China  ] off the [LOC United States  ] , refusing to convey information about [MISC U.S.-DPRK  ] bilateral conversations . 
Clearly seeking a clarification for the record , xxxxx asked if the [LOC United States  ] were prepared to accept a nuclear-armed but non-proliferating [LOC North Korea  ] . 
The Deputy Secretary stated this was not acceptable or sustainable . 
Tires ----- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) xxxxx lamented the United [MISC States'  ] recent 421 tire decision , and expressed concern that lawyers in the [LOC United States  ] were preparing additional cases on products such as textiles. xxxxx opined that [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] relied too much on " technical " negotiators. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Deputy Secretary has cleared this message .
