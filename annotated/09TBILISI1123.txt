Tefft  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
The June 22 kickoff of the [ORG U.S.-Georgia Charter Commission  ] will raise the question of the future of our military cooperation . 
[ORG Embassy Moscow  ] 's recent cable ( reftel ) has highlighted [MISC Russian  ] views and the potential impact on our attempt to reset our relations with [LOC Moscow  ] . 
There are , however , strong arguments in favor of providing [LOC Georgia  ] a modest , transparent defensive capability . 
We provide our views in this cable . 
In our assessment , the [MISC Russians  ] are effectively using propaganda based in falsehoods regarding the current state of the [MISC Georgian  ] military to ratchet up tensions , while simultaneously impressing upon the [LOC U.S.  ] that any efforts to provide military assistance to [LOC Georgia  ] will pose potential roadblocks to improving the [MISC U.S.-Russia  ] relationship . 
Accepting [MISC Russian  ] objections , however , contradicts stated [LOC U.S.  ] policies such as rejecting the notion of spheres of influence ; refusing a third party veto over [ORG NATO  ] membership ; and maintaining equal commitment to relations with both [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
It gives [MISC Russian  ] disinformation an undeserved voice in [LOC U.S.  ] policy formation. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary , continued: [ORG Embassy Tbilisi  ] believes that increased transparent military cooperation could help stabilize the situation in [LOC Georgia  ] , as [LOC Georgia  ] seeks to develop its defensive capacity -- and even decrease the size of its standing army . 
Retreating from our commitments would send a profoundly mixed signal to our partners in the region and in western [LOC Europe  ] , especially to those who are considering opening up their society , increasing transparency , and seeking increased partnership with the west . 
[LOC Russia  ] will undoubtedly object to increased military cooperation , but the answer is not to validate their concern , but to set the record straight in an organized , aggressive private and public diplomacy campaign with both [LOC Russia  ] and our broader partners . 
To do otherwise would be to reward [LOC Russia  ] 's aggression in [LOC Georgia  ] , as well as its violation of international law and commitments ; encourage a similar stance in [LOC Ukraine  ] ; and deal a body blow to our credibility in [LOC Georgia  ] , other [MISC Eurasian  ] states , our western partners -- and ultimately [LOC Russia  ] itself . 
End summary . 
THE [MISC GEORGIAN  ] ARMY HAS NOT RE-ARMED <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Russian  ] claims that [LOC Georgia  ] has more military capability now than in August 2008 , or that it has been steadily re-arming its forces , are false . 
During the August 2008 conflict , [LOC Georgia  ] lost extensive capabilities , including 30 percent of its armored vehicles , 40 percent of [MISC U.S.-produced AR-15  ] rifles , and at least 60 percent of its air defense capability . 
These have not been replaced . 
We are aware of only two deliveries of lethal military equipment since the war: Ejder armored personnel carriers from a [MISC Turkish  ] firm , based on a pre-war contract ; and 16 armored HMMWVs for the [ORG Special Forces Brigade  ] under a program begun in 2007 . 
The latter were purchased using [ORG Coalition Support Funds  ] , the case was processed before the August war , and the vehicles would be used in such coalition operations as those in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and other [ORG NATO  ] partners have moved cautiously since the war . 
Bilateral military-to-military events between [ORG NATO  ] partners and [LOC Georgia  ] have been reduced , Qevents between [ORG NATO  ] partners and [LOC Georgia  ] have been reduced , suspended , even terminated . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] in particular has yet to renew a capacity-building program begun months ago , and we have not executed a single kinetic event since August , despite [MISC Georgian  ] desires for more tactical training . 
The [ORG NATO  ] PfP Lancer/Longbow exercises , publicly used by [LOC Russia  ] against the [ORG Alliance and Georgia  ] , were planned more than a year in advance with full [MISC Russian  ] knowledge and possibility for participation . 
JOINING THE [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] COALITION <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Secretary [ORG Gates'  ] approach on security cooperation of " brains before brawn " ( B3 ) focuses on the intellectual development of the [MISC Georgian  ] armed forces and is non-kinetic in nature . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has now told [LOC Georgia  ] we accepted their offer to deploy a battalion for two years in [LOC RC-South  ] , one of the most dangerous areas of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
While it is not yet known how much training and equipping will be needed to bring [LOC Georgia  ] effectively into the coalition , it is in both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Russian  ] interests to widen the coalition in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Some lethal training will undoubtedly be involved , and we should not allow [LOC Russia  ] to twist any such cooperation in [LOC TBILISI  ] 00001123 002 OF 004 [LOC Afghanistan  ] , one of the [ORG Administration  ] 's top priorities , into a phantom threat . 
MINIMAL DEFENSIVE CAPABILITIES NEEDED FOR SURVIVAL <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Georgia  ] also wants to rebuild its native defensive capacity , which is currently insufficient to control its own airspace or hinder an invasion from any of its neighbors . 
Current [MISC Georgian  ] operational thinking is that if they can defend [LOC Tbilisi  ] from occupation for 72 hours , then international pressure will force the advance to pause . 
To achieve this extremely limited goal , [LOC Georgia  ] needs sufficient anti-armor and air defense capability to stall a ground advance , which it currently lacks . 
The development of this capacity is not solely equipment-based , but it will require the acquisition of new lethal defensive systems . 
If [LOC Georgia  ] does not procure the equipment from the [LOC U.S.  ] , it will almost surely seek to procure it elsewhere , as it has done in the past . 
[LOC U.S.  ] involvement would help ensure the transparency of the procurement process itself , as well as increase our control over the amount , type and location of the equipment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In addition , Minister [PER Sikharulidze  ] recently approved an intermediate force structure change that would reduce the [ORG Georgian Armed Forces  ] total personnel strength by 6,000 service members from the current 36,000 . 
( Current actual personnel is approximately 31,000 . 
) Without prejudging the ongoing [ORG Strategic Assessment  ] process , the Minister has confided to us that the final [MISC Georgian  ] force structure will be below 30,000 . 
The [MISC Georgians  ] have not publicized this proposed downsizing because they fear that a smaller [MISC Georgian  ] Army could encourage [MISC Russian  ] armed incursions . 
Furthermore , a recently proposed further 7 percent reduction in the defense budget will drop [LOC Georgia  ] 's total defense spending to less than half of 2008 levels. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Georgia  ] 's military plan is defensive in nature . 
As EUR Assistant Secretary [PER Gordon  ] recently noted to [MISC Georgian  ] Defense Minister [PER Sikharulidze  ] , every country has the right to defend itself - as described in [ORG Article  ] 51 of the [ORG UN Charter  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] may argue no weapon is only defensive in nature ; anti-tank and air defense systems , however , would not give [LOC Georgia  ] the capacity to launch an offensive attack . 
[LOC Russia  ] may argue that [LOC Georgia  ] is acquiring other , more offensive systems clandestinely at the same time . 
There is no evidence to support this assertion , and we would have a much greater degree of influence -- and be in a position to keep [LOC Russia  ] well informed -- if we were involved in defensive system procurement . 
Finally , [LOC Russia  ] will likely level allegations of increased [MISC Georgian  ] offensive capacity regardless of facts , just as they have done in the [LOC Geneva  ] process . 
[LOC Georgia  ] , however , provides far more transparency on its military forces than virtually any country in the world , signing MOUs between the [ORG EU Monitoring Mission  ] ( [ORG EUMM  ] ) and its Ministries of Defense and [ORG Internal Affairs  ] that give the observers unprecedented access to [MISC Georgian  ] military and law enforcement installations . 
The [ORG EUMM  ] , along with the [ORG OSCE  ] , has repeatedly affirmed that [LOC Georgia  ] has respected the limits established in those MOUs and has no offensive capability near [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] essentially ignores these statements and continues to level the same allegations , but that bluster Qand continues to level the same allegations , but that bluster does not change the fact of [LOC Georgia  ] 's continued restraint . 
As we seek to help [LOC Georgia  ] develop its defensive capacity , we could pursue smilar public and/or written commitments from the [MISC Georgians  ] on the exclusively defensive nature of the program. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) We believe that providing [LOC Georgia  ] with enhanced defensive capabilities will stabilize the situation . 
While [LOC Russia  ] , as well as the de facto regimes in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] , may argue otherwise , it is [LOC Russia  ] and its proxy regimes that have dramatically increased the militarization of [LOC Georgia  ] over the past year . 
[LOC Russia  ] has introduced at least 3,700 troops into sovereign [MISC Georgian  ] territory , as well as heavy military equipment , such as tanks , artillery and anti-aircraft systems , into the area immediately adjacent to the administrative boundaries -- in direct violation of the commitments President [PER Medvedev  ] made in the cease-fire agreement . 
It is [LOC Georgia  ] that has lost 14 police officers since the war ; kidnappings , cattle thefts , and detentions continue along the boundary , mostly on the [LOC Abkhaz  ] and [MISC South Ossetian  ] sides . 
[MISC Russian  ] helicopters make regular flights along the boundaries , sometimes crossing them , and [MISC Russian  ] forces move large numbers of troops and heavy equipment along the boundaries at will . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG EUMM  ] , [ORG OSCE  ] and UNOMIG [ORG TBILISI  ] 00001123 003 OF 004 continue to confirm [LOC Georgia  ] 's cooperative and constructive approach . 
There is little to deter [LOC Russia  ] from taking additional military action , except a legitimate defensive force opposing it . 
At the same time , such a force would not pose an offensive threat to the regions. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Retreating from military cooperation would be a step back from commitments we have made to [LOC Georgia  ] and other international partners . 
Not only will [LOC Georgia  ] be disappointed in our diminished support , and hesitant to trust us again , but other partners will draw the same conclusions . 
The [ORG Russia-Georgia  ] war has already led some countries , such as [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and the [MISC Central Asian  ] states , to question the extent of our commitment , even though we never committed to the direct military defense of [LOC Georgia  ] . 
A step back from commitments we have made would remove any doubt in our unreliability and convince countries from [LOC Belarus  ] to [LOC Kyrgyzstan  ] , even as they try to recalibrate their own relationship with [LOC Russia  ] , that the risks of continuing partnership with [LOC Russia  ] are less than those of moving toward cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
One of our specific commitments has been to [ORG NATO  ] membership for [LOC Georgia  ] , politically at the [LOC Bucharest Summit  ] , and at the operational level , with the [ORG Georgia-NATO Commission  ] and the [ORG Annual National Plan  ] . 
A key component of that process is the development of [LOC Georgia  ] 's homeland defense capacity . 
Since last August we have engaged with [LOC Georgia  ] on elements of their preparation for [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration , but the military component cannot be deferred indefinitely . 
The longer we defer action , the clearer the message will be to [LOC Georgia  ] and others that our commitment to membership has diminished. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Beyond our specific commitment to [LOC Georgia  ] , we have made broader commitments not to allow [LOC Russia  ] to impose its flawed zero-sum vision on our own strategic view of the world . 
The Secretary explicitly rejected [LOC Russia  ] 's notion of spheres of influence during her May 7 meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Lavrov  ] . 
The Vice President rejected the same notion at the February [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] . 
The President himself told President [PER Medvedev  ] the same thing in [LOC London  ] . 
All three have likewise expressed unequivocal support for [LOC Georgia  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] aspirations and territorial integrity . 
Any perceived or real retreat from these unambiguous statements -- and our special relationship with [LOC Georgia  ] makes it a test case -- will raise questions about our leadership . 
LOOKING AHEAD <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) A difficult , but crucial , element of our strategy for continuing engagement with [LOC Georgia  ] while maintaining a good relationship with [LOC Russia  ] will be an aggressive private , as well as public diplomacy campaign that is well coordinated with our western partners . 
[LOC Russia  ] will try to spin any military cooperation as negatively as possible , but we must not allow [MISC Russian  ] disinformation to go unchallenged . 
As noted above , we have already taken the first step in our engagement with the [MISC Georgian  ] military: agreeing together on the B3 approach . 
We are currently exploring the best fit for a [MISC Georgian  ] contribution to the effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Neither of these areas could be considered threatening . 
A further step , toward helping [LOC Georgia  ] improve its defensive capacity , would not be inherently threatening , and could help Qcapacity , would not be inherently threatening , and could help stabilize the situation . 
We must resist efforts to cast it any other way . 
[LOC Russia  ] will likely continue to portray [ORG NATO  ] engagement as threatening. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) More fundamentally , [LOC Russia  ] continues to characterize our differing agendas in the [MISC post-Soviet  ] space as a zero-sum , new " [LOC Great Game  ] " . 
Unlike in the 19th century , when two empires vied to establish control over the intervening territory in the exclusive pursuit of their own narrow interests , [LOC U.S.  ] policy seeks to enable independent countries to make their own choices . 
However real the perception may be among [MISC Russians  ] that the [LOC United States  ] is out to get them , we must resist all efforts to confuse that perception with our true intentions . 
[LOC Georgia  ] is seeking to choose its own partners , defend its own country , establish a market-based economy free of corruption , and further develop its young democracy -- and we are helping it do so . 
[LOC Georgia  ] poses no threat to [LOC Russia  ] ; it wants the political space to pursue its own path . 
To step back from our mission because [LOC Russia  ] mitrusts our motives is to cede to [LOC Russia  ] the terms of development in [LOC Eurasia  ] for the foreseeable future. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) There are two practical steps that we might consider [ORG TBILISI  ] 00001123 004 OF 004 pursuing to help both address the real danger of instability and blunt [LOC Russia  ] 's momentum in the public diplomacy sphere . 
First , we could encourage [LOC Georgia  ] to make public and/or written commitments about the exclusively defensive nature of its new military programs . 
Second , we could encourage [LOC Georgia  ] to offer to sign a non-use of force agreement with [LOC Russia  ] . 
[LOC Russia  ] has been pushing hard for such an agreement between [LOC Georgia  ] and its own regions , which [LOC Georgia  ] has understandably been unwilling to consider . 
If [LOC Georgia  ] were to call [LOC Russia  ] 's bluff and offer to sign such an agreement with [LOC Russia  ] itself , however , the burden would shift to [LOC Russia  ] to demonstrate the sincerity of its commitment to stability . 
It is unlikely that [LOC Russia  ] , which still maintains the fiction that it is not a party to the conflict , would accept [LOC Georgia  ] 's offer , but it would be left on the defensive . 
Meanwhile [LOC Georgia  ] could pursue its defensive development with a ready answer to any [MISC Russian  ] claims of belligerence or provocation . 
( Note: [ORG Embassy Tbilisi  ] has not explored either of these steps with [LOC Georgia  ] , so they are only ideas at this point , but experience suggests [LOC Georgia  ] would at least be willing to consider them . 
The steps [LOC Georgia  ] has already taken to provide transparency on its military and law enforcement activities suggest they would be willing to take similar steps . 
In the months after the war , senior [MISC Georgian  ] officials expressed their willingness to pursue a non-use of force agreement if [LOC Russia  ] made certain concessions . 
End note . 
) COMMENT: BALANCING RISKS <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [ORG Embassy Tbilisi  ] does not question the importance or difficulty of managing our relationship with [LOC Russia  ] , especially if we proceed with further military cooperation with [LOC Georgia  ] . 
No matter how loudly we insist on the true state of affairs , most [MISC Russians  ] at this point will either not believe us or ignore us , as [ORG Embassy Moscow  ] pointed out . 
There is indeed a risk that taking the next step with [LOC Georgia  ] will jeopardize the improvement of our relationship with [LOC Russia  ] . 
There is also a risk , however , that not taking that step will both foster further instability in [LOC Georgia  ] and jeopardize our credibility in a much broader space . 
Furthermore , as past experience has shown , there is yet another risk: that improvements in relations with [LOC Russia  ] , even if bought with compromises on other [LOC U.S.  ] interests , will not pay off with any real dividends . 
[ORG Embassy Tbilisi  ] would argue that sacrificing a relationship with a dedicated partner like [LOC Georgia  ] is the greater risk , because it will only embolden [LOC Russia  ] in the future , both to push for more concessions on our part and to reassert its perceived sphere of influence further . 
Up to this point , [LOC Russia  ] has paid no concrete penalty whatsoever for invading and occupying a neighboring country ; unilaterally recognizing two of its regions as independent states ; violating [ORG CFE  ] and cease-fire commitments by vastly increasing its military presence in those regions and not allowing humanitarian access ; corrupting the original concept of the [LOC Geneva  ] process into a forum to lend legitimacy to the regions ; blocking a status-neutral effort by the international community , through the [ORG OSCE  ] , to promote stability ; and killing the [ORG UN Observer Mission  ] in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Allowing [LOC Russia  ] to dictate the pace of [LOC QMission  ] in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Allowing [LOC Russia  ] to dictate the pace of military engagement with [LOC Georgia  ] will be seen as rewarding [LOC Russia  ] for its behavior . 
It could only be a matter of time before it takes similar actions in [LOC Ukraine  ] or elsewhere .
