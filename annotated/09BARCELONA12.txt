End Summary . 
LACK OF COMMUNICATION <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following the January 22 incident between undercover [ORG Guardia Urbana  ] agents and crewmen from the visiting [ORG USS Mt. Whitney  ] ( ref a ) , and in the face of an almost complete lack of communication from city authorities , [ORG CG  ] sent a letter to [ORG Guardia Urbana  ] director [PER F. Xavier Vilaro  ] i Camps , and copies to the Mayor 's office and the office of the regional President [PER Jose Montilla  ] denouncing the incident . 
[ORG CG  ] later spoke directly with an aide to the Mayor and the [ORG Diplomatic Advisor  ] to President [PER Montilla  ] . 
In addition , we have been in contact with the Court and a representative of the office of [LOC Civil  ] and [ORG Human Rights  ] . 
[ORG Embassy Madrid ODC Chief  ] , the President of the [ORG U.S. Section of the Joint Permanent Committee  ] that manages our bilateral Agreement on [ORG Defense Cooperation  ] , raised the incident with his [MISC Spanish  ] flag-officer counterpart January 23 . 
[ORG Embassy Madrid  ] sent a note verbal January 28 to the [ORG MFA  ] denouncing the incident and seeking an explanation . 
The Charge d'Affaires raised the incident January 29 in a meeting with the MOD Secretary General for Policy ( ref b ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After all of this , the only response we received from city authorities was a note from [PER Vilaro  ] , which stated that the matter was under internal investigation and that he was sorry for any " inconvenience " the incident may have caused . 
The [ORG CG  ] requested and received a meeting with the appropriate authorities . 
RUNNING FOR COVER <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CG  ] met with city council woman [PER Assumpta Escarp  ] i Gibert February 4 to follow up our previous communications . 
[ORG Guardia Urbana  ] director [PER Vilaro  ] and his deputy also attended . 
[ORG CG  ] told city officials that he appreciated the generally excellent relationship and cooperation with the police in [LOC Barcelona  ] , and that this was particularly important as the protection of [MISC American  ] citizens is our highest priority . 
He noted that to date we had not had a problem like this , and further reminded the officials that in his almost three years here he had received numerous appeals for more ship visits . 
[ORG CG  ] expressed [ORG USG  ] disappointment regarding this incident . 
As a result: A ) The [MISC Sixth Fleet  ] was now reluctant to return to [LOC Barcelona  ] ; B ) the incident had received attention at the highest levels in the Department ; C ) the [ORG USG  ] sent a diplomatic note to the GOS ; and D ) witness testimony that only [MISC African-American  ] males were targeted left a clear impression that race played a part in the event . 
[ORG CG  ] told the officials that the situation required an explanation and clarification . 
The [ORG USG  ] also wanted assurances that [LOC U.S.  ] military vessels would continue to be welcome to the city. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Escarp  ] assured [ORG CG  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] military vessels were , indeed , welcome in [LOC Barcelona  ] . 
She insisted that this was an isolated matter and noted that this is the first time in years that she has heard of something like this happening . 
She acknowledged [ORG CG  ] 's letter and made it clear her office had been contacted by other [MISC Spanish  ] authorities . 
[PER Escarp  ] and [PER Vilaro  ] agreed that miscommunication , both during the operation and after , was the likely cause of the problem . 
[ORG CG  ] noted that the plainclothes agents failed to identify themselves as police . 
NEXT STEPS <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CG  ] suggested a number of steps city officials might take to move past and learn from this incident . 
First , city officials need to offer an explanation to the [ORG USG  ] and make clear what they are investigating . 
Second , police officials should be directly in contact with NCIS liaison officers at [LOC Rota  ] . 
Third , that [ORG Guardia Urbana  ] have a direct line of communication with [ORG CG Barcelona  ] consular personnel . 
[PER Escarp  ] and [PER Vilaro  ] agreed , and also offered to give both [LOC Rota  ] and [MISC Sixth Fleet  ] officials information on the different types of police identification to enhance our security briefings . 
[ORG BARCELONA  ] 00000012 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Police and city officials were clearly shaken upon hearing both how far accounts of this incident had spread and a full outline of the consequences . 
We believe they are sincere in wanting to work out better lines of communication internally and with the [ORG USG  ] , and we plan to hold them to that . 
The next steps we suggested should go a long way towards strengthening a frayed relationship . 
We are going to insist on a copy of the investigation report and continue following on-going judicial procedures stemming from the formal complaints lodged by the crewmen .
