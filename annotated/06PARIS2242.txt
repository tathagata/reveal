END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After a March 1 evening arrival , on March 2 , the [PER Attorney General  ] met with [PER Pierre de Bousquet  ] de [PER Florian  ] , director of the [ORG DST  ] , [LOC France  ] 's internal security service . 
Both the [PER Attorney General  ] and de [PER Bousquet  ] complimented US- [MISC French  ] C/T cooperation , calling it " exceptional , " and recognizing that both countries were fighting a common enemy , and both had experienced losses . 
[LOC France  ] 's C/T fight was led by intelligence agencies working in concert with the judiciary , said [PER Bousquet  ] . 
Although [LOC France  ] did not pretend that its model could be applied elsewhere , it strongly believed that judiciary and police/intelligence services needed to cooperate closely in order to attack terrorist networks before they struck. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to questions from the [PER Attorney General  ] concerning the [ORG DST  ] 's view of the evolving nature of the terrorist threat , de [PER Bousquet  ] expressed a concern that democracies not compromise their essential values in combating terrorism as this could weaken the foundation of their societies . 
Most important , said [PER Bousquet  ] , was to win the battle of communication . 
Videos of [ORG USG  ] actions were a continuing source of motivation and repulsion for extremists . 
Although [ORG USG  ] communication regarding terrorism was focused on convincing its citizens , images of abuses in [LOC Iraq  ] and the messages of the [ORG USG  ] as received overseas both rebounded negatively overseas and encouraged [MISC Muslim  ] youth to join extremist movements , said [PER Bousquet.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bousquet  ] said [LOC France  ] was most concerned about the worldwide upsurge of radical [MISC Islam  ] . 
For this reason , the [ORG GOF  ] was building a " [MISC French  ] [MISC Islam  ] " a moderate [MISC Islam  ] that worked within the [MISC French  ] culture . 
All those who refuse to participate in this system would have no place in [MISC French  ] society , said [PER Bousquet  ] . 
He believed that the next generation of terrorists would be born and well-integrated into [MISC French  ] society , since well-educated and integrated [MISC French  ] Muslims were already beginning to be seen in jihadist circles . 
He called for continued close coordination between intelligence and police agencies , and asked that the Attorney General look into streamlining current procedure for passing telephone and [MISC Internet  ] communication details based in the [LOC United States  ] and needed for investigations in [LOC France.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Attorney General also met Minister of the Interior [PER Sarkozy  ] . 
Also present for the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] were [ORG Diplomatic Advisor David Martinon  ] , [ORG Legal Advisor Sylvie Smanniotto  ] , and [ORG DST  ] Director de [PER Bousquet  ] de [PER Florian  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] complained that the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] felt cooperation in terrorism matters with the [LOC United States  ] were one sided . 
He declined to give further specifics Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] stated that if [PER Sarkozy  ] had a specific complaint , he should feel free to call him directly . 
[ Note: Subsequent discussion with de [PER Bousquet  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] 's staff yielded apologies and assurances that GOF-USG CT cooperation is , and is seen as , good . 
] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] also signaled that he was under pressure to remedy the current inability of [LOC France  ] to produce biometric visas in conformity with recent [LOC U.S.  ] legislation , so as to participate in the visa waiver program . 
[ Note: Septel on recent biometric passport developments . 
] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sarkozy  ] also discussed general geopolitical issues concerning [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
He believed [LOC France  ] should not be in an adversarial posture with the [LOC U.S.  ] and should change its approach . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is an important friend and ally of [LOC France  ] , the level of [LOC PARIS  ] 00002242 002 OF 004 convergence of interest is much greater than with major non-democratic powers like [LOC Russia  ] or [LOC China  ] . 
While he was constrained by the current government 's policies , he believed the situation would change after the election . 
He indicated he would travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] to be able to tell the [MISC French  ] public what his impressions were of the [LOC U.S.  ] and that he would provide more detail on his positions as his run for the [MISC French  ] presidency advanced . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] stated that [LOC France  ] and the international community would have to help the [LOC United States  ] resolve the situation in [LOC Iraq  ] , as the [LOC U.S.  ] could not do so alone ; perhaps with international forces eventually replacing the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the morning of March 3 , Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] hosted a breakfast for the Attorney General and four key [MISC French  ] counter-terrorism officials , counter-terrorism investigative judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] , Prosecutor General of [LOC Paris  ] [PER Yves Bot  ] , Prosecutor of [LOC Paris  ] [PER Jean-Claude Marin  ] , and Director of the [ORG Criminal Division  ] of the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] [PER Jean-Marie Huet  ] . 
The Attorney General started the discussion by thanking the officials for their assistance and asked them for their assessment of the current counter- terrorism situation . 
Led by the commentaries of Judge [PER Bruguiere  ] , the officials noted the advantages they operated under , including their ability to protect the sources of intelligence information that they use in their investigations , the fact that they do not need to detail facts to the same extent as in the [LOC U.S.  ] to arrest persons , or undertake searches and seizures or wiretaps , and the fact that there was no jury system , no formal rules on admissibility of evidence and no hearsay rule . 
There followed a general legal discussion on these aspects of the [MISC French  ] system. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Judge [PER Bruguiere  ] also outlined the two general threat trends [LOC France  ] was experiencing: First , that [MISC French  ] youth were being drawn into terrorist activities to a greater extent , reflecting that the threat was moving from [LOC East  ] to [LOC West  ] . 
Second , that the new terrorists were on an increasing level of sophistication and education . 
Recent arrests had demonstrated that highly educated electronics experts had been recruited by jihadist networks for purposes of executing attacks in [LOC Europe  ] , and that they had developed highly sophisticated methods for detonating explosive charges at long distance. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Attorney General next met with [PER Ron Noble  ] , Secretary General of [ORG Interpol  ] , on March 3 . 
The discussion [ORG SIPDIS  ] commenced with the Attorney General inquiring about the recent request for [ORG Interpol  ] red notices made by [LOC Italy  ] concerning the alleged abduction of an individual from [LOC Italy  ] by [ORG USG  ] officials . 
[PER Noble  ] advised that the procedure at this stage is for [ORG Interpol  ] to review the requests to determine whether issuance of the red notices would be consistent with the [ORG Interpol  ] Constitution , which prohibits [ORG Interpol  ] from participating in political matters , or pursuing politically motivated requests. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Noble  ] also briefed the [ORG AG  ] on a number of current issues , including a push to list with [ORG Interpol  ] those al- [ORG Qaida  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] members on the [ORG UN  ] sanctions list so that [ORG Interpol  ] could generate a new kind of notice providing details on these persons to police in member states , and to facilitate wider contribution to and use of the [ORG Interpol  ] database on lost or stolen passports . 
Regarding lost/stolen passports , a pilot project conducted between [ORG Interpol  ] and the [MISC Swiss  ] government demonstrated that the [ORG Interpol  ] database could be used in real-time , leading to a marked increase in the seizures and prosecutions for those using false travel documents . 
He cited the example of one seized passport that had been in use since April 2003 , had passed through 19 countries and had successfully gone through border controls 46 times without being caught. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Noble  ] requested that the Attorney General consider detailing a legal attach/prosecutor to [ORG Interpol  ] headquarters , given the rise in legal issues in recent years . 
The Attorney General expressed concern that a [ORG DOJ  ] prosecutor might have to address cases that would conceivably work against [ORG USG  ] interests . 
[PER Noble  ] replied that the [ORG DOJ  ] prosecutor would always have the option of recusing him/herself. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Embassy [LOC Paris  ] also organized three press events for Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] on March 3: a print press [LOC PARIS  ] 00002242 003 OF 004 roundtable , an interview with [ORG Radio France Internationale  ] , and an interview with [MISC French  ] all-news channel LCI-TV . 
Major [MISC French  ] newspapers as well as wire services [ORG Agence France Presse  ] , [ORG Reuters  ] , and [ORG Associated Press  ] , attended his print press roundtable . 
The [ORG AG  ] took numerous questions on [LOC Guantanamo  ] and detainee treatment . 
He explained the differences between treatment of detainees on a battlefield and prisoners in the criminal justice system and underscored that the [LOC U.S.  ] treats detainees humanely and in accord with [LOC Geneva  ] even if they do not come under the [ORG Geneva Convention  ] since they are unlawful combatants . 
Wire reports quoted [PER AG Gonzales  ] as saying: " The relationship between [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement is outstanding , " and , " Both countries share the common objective of preventing terrorist attacks . 
" The press roundtable also triggered articles in center-left daily Libration ( circulation: 158,086 ) and Catholic daily [ORG La Croix  ] ( circulation: 102,022 ) . 
[ORG La Croix  ] highlighted that , " Four years after 9/11 , the determination of the [LOC U.S.  ] government has not faltered when it comes to fighting against terror . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) Excerpts of his interview with the [MISC French  ] worldwide broadcasting radio network [ORG Radio France Internationale  ] ( RFI-- similar to [ORG Voice of America  ] ) aired on March 3 , and the interview was aired in full in RFI 's weekly Wednesday , RFI [MISC English  ] service program " Voices . 
" In the radio interview , [PER AG Gonzales  ] was asked about the [ORG CIA  ] flights controversy , and he emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] is a nation of laws that respects its legal commitments. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The all-news television network [ORG LCI  ] featured the full interview in its " [ORG News of the World  ] " program , which was re-broadcast three times the same evening . 
The Attorney [PER General  ] was asked about his visit to [LOC Paris  ] , the use of death penalty in [LOC Texas  ] when President [PER Bush  ] was governor -- [ORG AG  ] referred to the due process of law accorded the prisoners , and the possible death penalty for [PER Zacharias Moussaoui  ] who , the [ORG AG  ] said , has pleaded guilty and his sentence will be decided by the [ORG Court.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Attorney General met with [MISC French  ] Justice Minister [PER Pascal Clement  ] on March 3 . 
The two complimented U.S.-French cooperation as " very good " on terrorism and other legal matters . 
The Attorney [PER General  ] said Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] had complained that counter-terrorism information sharing was not as robust as it could be , to which [PER Clement  ] responded that in his opinion , information sharing between [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] was good . 
They compared notes on the different [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] legal systems . 
The Attorney [PER General  ] reassured [PER Clement  ] that any information provided by [LOC France  ] for the [PER Moussaoui  ] trial would not be used to support a death penalty conviction . 
He also invited [PER Clement  ] to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Clement  ] thanked the Attorney [PER General  ] and said he would be pleased to do so when their schedules permitted. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Clement  ] hailed the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] 's mutual exchange of magistrates as a way to ward off any budding legal problems between the two countries . 
He said the lack of major problems to discuss was a fruit of this type of exchange . 
[PER Clement  ] asked the [ORG AG  ] when the [LOC U.S.  ] would ratify the [ORG Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention  ] , noting that [LOC France  ] had recently done so . 
The [ORG AG  ] stated that he hoped we would be able to overcome final [ORG Senate  ] objections soon and get the treaty ratified . 
They also discussed a number of other issues , including the sex offenses , and psychiatric testimony , child abduction cases , and growing illegal drug use . 
At the conclusion of the meeting , the ministers had a walk-out for the press , in which they delivered statements regarding the issues discussed . 
The [PER Clement  ] statement included mention of the assurance provided by the [LOC U.S.  ] that the evidence provided by [LOC France  ] in the [PER Moussaoui  ] case would not be used to obtain the death penalty. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) This visit provided a good opportunity for Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] to both meet in depth key [MISC French  ] law enforcement officials , express [LOC U.S.  ] appreciation for the strong cooperative law enforcement relationship between the two countries , as well as to explain the [MISC French  ] public through his interviews the [LOC United States  ] approach to combating terrorism . 
Ambassador [PER Stapleton  ] accompanied the Attorney General to all of his meetings . 
The Attorney General departed on March 4 , 2006 , for other meetings in the [LOC United Kingdom  ] .
