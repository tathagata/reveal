End Summary. -------------------------------------------- Criticism of the Timing of the [MISC Base Decision  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 .

Nearly all the reporters asked her about the `sudden' decision to realign the base and withdraw the fighters and search and rescue helicopters . 
She replied that this was a difficult decision was taken after long and careful analysis . 
In her interview with [LOC National TV  ] , with an audience of 50 percent of the [MISC Icelandic  ] population ) , she said: " Ambassador [PER Gadsden  ] did deliver the message of withdrawing the planes three years ago . 
Also , President [PER Bush  ] told the Foreign Minister then that the idea was under review and discussion . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
She said the decision was based primarily on the evolving global security environment and is a part of the reposturing of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces worldwide , which has resulted in the withdrawal of half a million [LOC U.S.  ] military forces from [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Asia  ] and the closing of dozens of military bases in the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Asked whether this was a slap in the face to [LOC Iceland  ] , given its generous cost-sharing offer made during the defense talks last month , the Ambassador responded: " We appreciated [LOC Iceland  ] 's generous proposal at the February defense talks , but the decision on the base realignment in the end was based on the changes in the global security environment . 
" ------------------------- Ignoring [LOC Iceland  ] 's Views ? ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Reporters also asked the Ambassador why the [LOC United States  ] was `ignoring' [LOC Iceland  ] 's views in taking this decision regarding the future of the base , and quoted some politicians as saying that this could amount to an abrogation of the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] . 
In the [LOC National TV  ] interview , Ambassador said: " We listened to their proposals very hard . 
The treaty is flexible to accommodate this change . 
Our [LOC U.S.  ] military presence has gone up and down over the years . 
The threats facing [LOC Iceland  ] need to be looked at in the present context , and we will do that in future defense talks . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
As she told the [MISC NFS-TV  ] reporter: " This is a new chapter , a different chapter in our relationship . 
There have been changes in our relationship over the past 60 years , which is longer than most Icelanders have been alive . 
It is a new step in our relationship but we will continue to abide by the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] . 
" ------------------------------------------- Planes Outmoded Response to Today 's Threats ------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
When asked by [LOC National Radio  ] about whether the planes were necessary for [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense , Ambassador answered: " We don't think that the stationing of the planes here is an appropriate use of those assets . 
We remain committed to [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense . 
Over the years , the [LOC U.S.  ] military has made great strides in achieving the rapid deployment of troops . 
We need to look ahead to the security threats of the twenty-first century , not those that were present during the [MISC Cold War  ] , and the treaty is flexible in that regard .
