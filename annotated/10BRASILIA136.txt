( [ORG SBU  ] ) Per [LOC REFTEL  ] , Science Counselor briefed [MISC Brazilian  ] Ministry of [ORG External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) [ORG Environment Division  ] Director [PER Paulino Carvalho  ] ( who has replaced [PER Fernando Coimbra  ] ) and Officer [PER Renato Leonardi  ] about the [LOC U.S.  ] proposals to the March 13-25 [ORG Fifteenth Conference  ] of the Parties ( COP-15 ) for the [ORG Convention on International Trade  ] in [ORG Endangered Species of Wild Fauna  ] and [PER Flora  ] ( CITES ) . 
Further , Science Counselor requested the support of the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) for the [LOC U.S.  ] proposals and also asked for information about who will lead the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation and the other delegation members. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Carvalho  ] and [PER Leonardi  ] were well-informed about the CITES issues in [LOC REFTEL  ] . 
They appreciated the sharing of information about the [ORG USG  ] proposals , and they inquired about the [ORG USG  ] position regarding tuna and CITES . 
The two reserved opinion about the [ORG USG  ] proposals because they wanted to wait till the [ORG GOB  ] had completed its inter-ministerial consultations . 
They expected to have the consultations completed by February 18 , when they are scheduled to meet again with the Science Counselor to go over the [ORG USG  ] proposals more definitively . 
At that time , they expect to have decided on the head of the [ORG GOB  ] delegation and the other members . 
Presumably , [PER Carvalho  ] and [PER Leonardi  ] will be part of the delegation to CITES COP-15 .
