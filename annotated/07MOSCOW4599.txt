Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The mercurial [PER Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  ] staged yet another impressive act of political theater on September 17 with the surprise announcement that the number two position on his party’s ticket would be filled by [PER Andrey Lugovoy  ] , the former [ORG FSB  ] officer accused by [ORG Scotland Yard  ] of orchestrating the murder of [PER Aleksandr Litvinenko  ] . 
The announcement made [ORG Zhirinovskiy’s  ] party , the [ORG LDPR  ] , front-page news in virtually all major [MISC Russian  ] newspapers and drew greater attention to what had been a lackluster kick-off to the party’s [ORG Duma  ] campaign . 
Opinions vary in [LOC Moscow  ] as to the reasons behind the move . 
[PER Zhirinovskiy  ] may hope that the hoopla surrounding the appointment of [PER Lugovoy  ] will revive the apparently flagging fortunes of his party . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the past months , it appeared that [ORG LDPR  ] was on the ropes , crippled by high-level defections of top party officials to other parties . 
The most recent blow was the loss of long-time [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] confederate [PER Aleksey Mitrofanov  ] , who defected to Just [LOC Russia  ] ( [ORG SR  ] ) in late August . 
[ORG LDPR  ] had fallen behind in the funding race as well , dropping to last place among the top four parties in the second quarter of 2007 , according to the [ORG Central Election Commission  ] . 
Public opinion polling , such as a mid-September survey by the [ORG Fund for Public Opinion  ] , showed the party scraping along at the seven-percent minimum required for joining the new [ORG Duma  ] . 
[PER Levada  ] polling showed [ORG LDPR  ] losing about a percentage point every month since [PER May.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One would not have believed that [ORG LDPR  ] was in trouble , though , to judge by [ORG Zhirinovskiy’s  ] swagger and bravado over the past two days . 
His stem-winding oration before his party’s congress in [LOC Moscow  ] on September 17 provided a broad overview of [ORG Zhirinovskiy’s  ] peculiar views on international relations , domestic policies , and party politics , punctuated with his usual histrionics about [MISC Western  ] interference and perfidy . 
He also boldly predicted that [ORG LDPR  ] would win a minimum 15 percent of the [ORG Duma  ] seats , and that he had hopes for twenty percent . 
( His electoral math sees [LOC United Russia  ] winning half of the seats , with 12 percent for the [ORG Communist Party  ] and 8 percent for Just [LOC Russia  ] ( [ORG SR  ] ) . 
He dismissed all other parties , including the “liberal” parties of [LOC Yabloko  ] and the [ORG Union of Right Forces  ] , out of hand . 
) Moreover , he spun the defection of [ORG LDPR  ] members to other parties as a “purge” of the party that served only to strengthen it against its rivals , particularly [ORG SR  ] , which he referred to as a party of “mercenaries.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Perhaps to set the stage for [MISC Lugovoy’s  ] debut , [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] reserved special vitriol for the role played by [LOC Great Britain  ] over the centuries and today in denying [LOC Russia  ] its “proper place” in the world , according to press reports . 
At a press conference on September 18 , he launched a diatribe against a hapless reporter from [ORG Voice of America  ] , who had asked [PER Lugovoy  ] about the need to deal with the problem of international criminal investigations . 
During his tirade , [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] blasted the [LOC United Kingdom  ] for sponsoring terrorism in [LOC Chechnya  ] ( implying as well that the [LOC U.S.  ] was behind the events of September 11 ) . 
He criticized [LOC London  ] for its campaign of “espionage and lies , ” insisting that the [MISC British  ] government was responsible for [MISC Litvinenko’s  ] death. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Throughout the press conference , [PER Lugovoy  ] appeared uncomfortable in his new role as straight man for [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] . 
It also appeared that he had been reprimanded by his new boss about the rank order in the party . 
[PER Lugovoy  ] pointedly retracted his statement of a day earlier that he had ambitions to run for President , coyly saying that every [MISC Russian  ] would want to be the leader of such a great country , before gamely insisting that [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] had the mettle to replace [PER Putin  ] . 
[PER Lugovoy  ] seemed completely surprised by a question about his plans as a deputy were he to win a [ORG Duma  ] seat , and he said something about working to be helpful to the government and the [MISC Russian  ] people . 
( [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] interrupted to say that [MISC Lugovoy’s  ] military and business experience made him an excellent candidate for the [ORG Duma  ] committees on defense and security , particularly in dealing with questions of economic security . 
) When asked , [PER Lugovoy  ] reiterated his statement of September 17 that he was not seeking a position in the [ORG Duma  ] in order to win immunity for he was protected , “like all citizens , ” by the Constitution . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Embassy interlocutors disagreed on the reasons behind [ORG Zhirinovskiy’s  ] enlistment of [PER Lugovoy  ] . 
Chief Editor of “Economy and World Relations” [PER Andrey Ryabov  ] suggested that [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00004599 002 OF 002 the [LOC Kremlin  ] had pushed [PER Lugovoy  ] onto the [ORG LDPR  ] list in order to somehow provide him with protection . 
Political technologist [PER Stanislav Belkovskiy  ] told us that it was [ORG Zhirinovskiy’s  ] idea to bring [PER Lugovoy  ] on board in order to improve [MISC LDPR’s  ] hand in the campaign . 
[PER Belkovskiy  ] thought that regional elites would see the selection of [PER Lugovoy  ] who , he said , enjoyed the personal protection of [PER Putin  ] , as a sign of [LOC Kremlin  ] favor for [PER Zhirinovskiy  ] and his party . 
It remains to be seen how Lugovoy’s new role will affect [MISC LDPR’s  ] election prospects . 
It seems odd that the [LOC Kremlin  ] , which presumably would want to see the furor over the [PER Litvinenko  ] matter end as soon as possible , has kept the matter front and center by sanctioning [MISC Lugovoy’s  ] entry into [MISC Russian  ] politics .
