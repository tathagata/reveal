( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary: The Icelandic Government  ] is sending ever-clearer messages that it wants visible progress in [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] discussions on the NATO-owned [LOC Iceland  ] Air [ORG Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) radar sites , for which [LOC U.S.  ] funding expires in August 2007 . 
In a March 30 meeting with the Ambassador , [PER Jon Egil Egilsson  ] , Head of the Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs Defense Department  ] , pressed hard for another round of bilateral [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] talks on the system -- and specifically , the possibility of [MISC U.S.-funded  ] upgrades to the system -- as soon as possible this month . 
[PER Egilsson  ] noted that February 23 talks in [LOC Brussels  ] between the two sides were a fruitful start , but argued that clarity regarding [LOC U.S.  ] intentions was necessary before [LOC Iceland  ] could properly approach [ORG NATO  ] about the future of the system ( i.e. , ask [ORG NATO  ] to foot the rest of the bill ) . 
Post is highly appreciative of [LOC Washington  ] efforts on this issue , which will be an extremely sensitive point for the host government up to and beyond the August 15 , 2007 date when current [LOC U.S.  ] obligations to fund [ORG IADS  ] expires . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Background: In October 2006 , concurrent with the closure of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] , Secretary [PER Rice  ] and [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] signed a " [MISC Joint Understanding  ] " to set the future course for [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] security cooperation ( [ORG Ref A  ] ) . 
Among other things , the agreement called for the cessation of [LOC US  ] funding for the [LOC Iceland  ] Air [ORG Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) -- a NATO-owned network of four radar sites used for air traffic control and airspace monitoring purposes -- effective 15 August 2007 . 
The [MISC Joint Understanding  ] further expressed the intent to discuss bilaterally and with [ORG NATO  ] the funding and disposition of [ORG IADS  ] and how future operations of [ORG IADS  ] might support [ORG NATO  ] requirements . 
The first bilateral discussion on the future of [ORG IADS  ] took place 23 February 2007 in [LOC Brussels  ] between a DOD-led [LOC U.S.  ] delegation and an [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation ( Ref B ) . 
Head of the Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs Defense Department  ] [PER Egilsson  ] requested a meeting with the Ambassador on 30 March to discuss the state of play and push for the next round of talks as soon as possible. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Egilsson  ] , the critical issue for the [ORG GOI  ] is upgrades to the system . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] initiated various upgrades to [ORG IADS  ] prior to the closure of [ORG NAS Keflavik  ] , but terminated these projects when the base closed on 30 September 2006 . 
[PER Egilsson  ] stated that it is [LOC Iceland  ] 's intention to maintain [ORG IADS  ] and to integrate it into the [ORG NATO Integrated Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG NATINADS  ] ) with long range support coming from [ORG NATO  ] . 
He further stated that there are certain functions that [LOC Iceland  ] cannot provide on its own , which are critical to the continued operation of [ORG IADS  ] and its interoperability with [ORG NATO  ] . 
He considers these upgrades vital to the sustainability of [ORG IADS  ] and requests feedback as to USG intent to complete the upgrades . 
[PER Egilsson  ] passed three documents to the Ambassador , which he noted were already passed to the [LOC US  ] delegation in [LOC Brussels  ] during the February discussions ( copies provided via email to [PER EUR/NB  ] and [PER OSD Hursch  ] ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Pressing the point , [PER Egilsson  ] made it clear that the [ORG GOI  ] is eager to continue discussions on [ORG IADS  ] . 
Its concern is that the 15 August 2007 cutoff date for [LOC US  ] funding is fast approaching and that in the [ORG MFA  ] 's view , many issues must be resolved bilaterally with the [LOC U.S.  ] before [ORG GOI  ] can adequately express its intentions to [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Egilsson  ] allowed , however , that not every issue arising from the February discussions needs to be resolved in order to make the next move . 
For example , he stated that the cryptographic upgrades are not an issue that would impede [ORG GOI  ] discussions with [ORG NATO  ] . 
In addition , while the [ORG GOI  ] expressed its desire for the second round of discussions to take place in [LOC Reykjavik  ] ( comment: a sure sign of the pressure [PER Egilsson  ] is under to show visible progress on [ORG IADS  ] ahead of May 's parliamentary elections ) , it did not object to another location if required to facilitate the discussion. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Egilsson  ] is reflecting the pinch the [ORG GOI  ] as a whole feels to tie up loose ends on [ORG IADS  ] , the most prominent " legacy " issue remaining from the [ORG NASKEF  ] closure last year . 
This is particularly true given comments by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in [ORG NATO  ] fora equating continued [ORG IADS  ] operations with the importance of air policing for the [MISC Baltics  ] . 
Post is deeply appreciative of [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC EUCOM  ] efforts to bring technical and policy expertise to bear in resolving this issue ( Ref C ) , which is a critical one for the [ORG GOI  ] and a recurring theme in every conversation [LOC REYKJAVIK  ] 00000099 002 OF 002 Ambassador has on security affairs here. van [MISC Voorst</pre></code>  ]
