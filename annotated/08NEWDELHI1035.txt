( [ORG C/REL UK  ] , [LOC CANADA  ] , [LOC AUSTRALIA  ] ) Summary: Hours before his April 9 departure for the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] summoned PolCouns to convey a message: please use all effective means to persuade the [LOC PRC  ] to engage in dialogue with him . 
He said recent events had left him increasingly concerned about the future of the [MISC Tibetan  ] people . 
Reaffirming his commitment to the “Middle Way” , i.e. not to seek independence as long as the [MISC Chinese  ] government respects the distinctive character of the [MISC Tibetan  ] people and permits them to enjoy genuine regional autonomy , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] stated that he sought a breakthrough with [LOC Beijing  ] . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] recalled his conversation with Ambassador [PER Mulford  ] ( reftel ) , where he had explained that the [LOC PRC  ] only respects strength , and he exhorted the [LOC U.S.  ] to take action that will “make an impact” in [LOC Beijing  ] . 
At the end of the thirty-minute meeting , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] embraced PolCouns and made a final plea: “Tibet is a dying nation . 
We need [MISC America’s  ] help.” End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/REL UK  ] , [LOC CANADA  ] , [LOC AUSTRALIA  ] ) The [PER Dalai Lama  ] related an earlier conversation with a [MISC Chinese  ] scholar that convinced him the “positive scenario” he outlined on March 28 -- where the [LOC PRC  ] agrees to dialogue and permits a degree of [MISC Tibetan  ] autonomy -- was a possibility . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] described this unnamed scholar as interpreting the regular use of the [PER Dalai Lama’s  ] name by [MISC Chinese  ] leaders and references to ‘the [MISC Dalai  ] clique’ as signs they were prepared to engage with him . 
If [LOC PRC  ] leaders ignored the [PER Dalai Lama  ] and focused instead on the [MISC Tibetan Youth Congress  ] and [MISC Tibet-based  ] leaders of the uprising , that would indicate the [LOC PRC  ] planned to bypass him , according to this scholar. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/REL UK  ] , [LOC CANADA  ] , [LOC AUSTRALIA  ] ) Immediately prior to meeting with PolCouns , the [PER Dalai Lama  ] met with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] said [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had been in touch with [MISC Chinese  ] interlocutors who convinced [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that a deal could be made: if the [PER Dalai Lama  ] supported peaceful transit of the [MISC Olympic  ] torch through [LOC Tibet  ] , then the [LOC PRC  ] would simultaneously release [MISC Tibetans  ] who had been detained since March 10 . 
Comment: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] .

( [ORG C/REL UK  ] , [LOC CANADA  ] , [LOC AUSTRALIA  ] ) The [MISC Indian  ] media continues to headline plans for the April 17 [MISC Olympic  ] torch transit through [LOC New Delhi  ] , with much speculation about which celebrities and leaders will choose to carry the torch , thereby pleasing the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
India’s first female director-general of police , [PER Kiran Bedi  ] , has declined the honor , stating that protection of the torch by [ORG China’s Special Police Force  ] guards has robbed it of its desired symbolism . 
[MISC Indian  ] football captain [PER Bhaichung Bhatia  ] has also pulled out , expressing solidarity with [MISC Tibetan  ] activists . 
[ORG China’s  ] defense attache in [LOC New Delhi  ] informed the [MISC Indian  ] Army’s director of foreign liaison that planned Army-to-Army exercises will be cancelled if [LOC New Delhi  ] fails to protect the torch during its 2.5-kilometer sprint through the capital. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/REL UK  ] , [LOC CANADA  ] , [LOC AUSTRALIA  ] ) Comment: While [MISC Indian  ] observers believe that pressure on the [LOC PRC  ] to engage with the [PER Dalai Lama  ] is growing , his candid comment that “Tibet is a dying nation” indicates increasing desperation as a result of his ability to affect events in his homeland . 
The President’s comments that dialogue provides the only way forward have resonated here , and [LOC Tibet  ] Coordinator Dobriansky’s April 24 visit to [LOC New Delhi  ] gives the [LOC U.S.  ] an opportunity to reinforce the President’s message . 
The [PER Dalai Lama  ] , who has studied [LOC China  ] for most of his 73 years , appears [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00001035 002 OF 002 to be persuaded that a united show of strength will nudge [LOC Beijing  ] in his direction , and that by vilifying him , [ORG China’s  ] leaders may have laid the ground work for engagement . 
End comment. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) ACTION REQUEST: Post emailed and pouched letters from the [PER Dalai Lama  ] to President [PER George Bush  ] , Secretary of State [PER Condoleeza Rice  ] , Speaker of the [ORG House  ] [PER Nancy Pelosi  ] and Senator [PER Harry Reid  ] requesting that the USG appeal to [LOC China  ] to end the current crackdown on [MISC Tibetans  ] immediately ; release all [MISC Tibetans  ] arrested and ensure they receive proper medical attention ; and , asked for assistance in facilitating a group of international observers and media to affected areas in the TAR to ensure compliance . 
Post requests guidance/reply on who should assume the lead coordination in the reply to the [PER Dalai Lama  ] .
