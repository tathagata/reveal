( U ) [ORG Summary: Highway Police  ] forces throughout the north and northeast and [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) forces in [LOC Baghlan  ] province are both dominated by [MISC Tajik  ] warlords and drug traffickers . 
General [PER Abdul Khalil  ] has assigned former jihadi/Hezb-i-Islami loyalists from [ORG Baghlans Andarab District  ] to the majority of positions in the e [ORG Highway Police  ] . 
Under General [PER Mustafas influence  ] , General [PER Mir Alam  ] and other [MISC Tajik  ] warlords also dominate the [ORG ANP  ] in [LOC Baghlan  ] . 
Patrons in the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] support and reinforce competing power players in [LOC Baghlan  ] without regard to corruption and drug trafficking . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------------- HIGHWAY POLICE NETWORK ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since 2003 , General [PER Abdul Khalil Andarabi  ] has been leading a government condoned drug cartel known as the [LOC North  ] and [ORG Northeast Highway Police Brigade  ] ( also known as Second Brigade ) , controlling the roads and much of the narco-trafficking from [LOC Faryab  ] to [LOC Badakhshan  ] provinces . 
[PER Khalil  ] , a former [MISC Tajik  ] jihadi from [ORG Baghlans Andarab District  ] , was a [ORG Jumbesh  ] battalion commander under the [MISC Ishmaelite  ] leader [PER Sayyed Jafar Naderi  ] . 
Khalils father , [PER Juma Khan  ] , was an eminent commander of [ORG Hezb-i-Islami  ] in the [LOC Andarab  ] area , hence the influence of his fathrs supporters in the [LOC North  ] and [ORG Northeast Highway Police  ] Department. t. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) General [PER Khalil  ] reportedly has had the support of two very influential [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( MoI ) officials: the Acting Minister of [LOC Interior  ] , Mr. [PER Zarar  ] , and a former Deputy Minister , General [PER Helaluddin  ] . 
Mr. [PER Helaluddin  ] , also a [MISC Tajik  ] from [LOC Andarab  ] , was a military pilot during Najibullahs time , and was then linked to [ORG Jumbesh  ] . 
He became Deputy Minister during the first transitional government . 
[PER Helaluddin  ] recently won a seat in the [ORG Wolesi Jirga  ] representing [ORG Baghlan Province  ] . 
General [PER Khalil  ] was allegedly an active supporter of [MISC Helaluddins  ] campaign. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since Khalils appointment , eight of the 12 ( 67 percent ) most influential positions in the [ORG Highway  ] police department have been given to the people from [LOC Andarab  ] , and a total of eight ( out of 12 ) people are the former [ORG Hezb-i Islami  ] activists and sympathizers of Khalils father . 
Khalils cronyism has resulted in an ethnic repartition of the department . 
At the highest level in the [ORG Highway Police  ] lice Department ( battalion commanders and general staff ) , 11 out of 12 are [MISC Tajik  ] , while only one person , the [ORG Deputy Highway Police  ] Chief , is a [PER Pashtun  ] . 
The latter is professional and seems to be without political affiliation . 
( Nevertheless , the [ORG Deputy Highway Police  ] Chief , Colonel [PER Nasser  ] , does not have a spotless reputation , as he , too , worked a number of months for [PER Bashir Baghlani  ] when the latter was [ORG Baghlans  ] provincial governor under the [MISC Taliban  ] regime . 
) Khalils cronyism is readily evident in the fact that two of 12 important positions , namely the Reconnaissance Officer and the Commander of the [ORG First Battalion  ] , were openly offered to Khalils uncle and to the nephew of General [PER Helaluddin  ] , respectively. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Political connections between [LOC Baghlan  ] and [LOC Kabul  ] have proven lucrative for [PER Helaluddin  ] and [PER Khalil  ] ( both from [LOC Andarab  ] ) , and to some extent Acting Minister of Interior [PER Zarar  ] . 
This political web of support has been highly influential in the narco-trafficking throughout the [LOC North  ] th and [ORG Northeast  ] regions from [LOC Badakhshan  ] ( the regions main producer of opium and heroin ) to [LOC Faryab  ] . 
However , this political network of drug traffickers faces stiff competition in [LOC Baghlan  ] and [LOC Kunduz  ] . 
General [PER Mustafa  ] is another native of [LOC Andarab  ] who , along with his group of merry men affiliated with Hezb-i-Naween ( [ORG HNA  ] ) /Jamiat , runs the competing trafficking rings in the [ORG Northeast Region  ] . 
[PER Mustafa  ] is joined in this endeavor by the native of [LOC Kunduz  ] and former commander of the 54th Division , current [LOC Baghlan  ] Chief of Police Mir [LOC Alam.  ] ------------------------- PROVINCIAL POLICE NETWORK ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) General [PER Mir Alam  ] . 
The situation in [LOC Baghlan  ] started to deteriorate after the June 2005 appointment of General [PER Mir Alam  ] as Provincial Chief of Police . 
Mir [PER Alam  ] is a [MISC Tajik  ] , former [MISC Jihadi  ] and former commander of 54th Division , affiliated to [ORG HNA  ] and still linked to various armed groups . 
Apparently , the decision to appoint Mir [PER Alam  ] as Chief of Police was taken without consulting Mr. [PER Jalali  ] , the former Minister of [LOC Interior  ] . 
Since the collapse of [MISC Taliban  ] regime , the followers of General [PER Mustafa  ] , former commander of the 20th Division , and people linked to [MISC HNA/Jamiat  ] have acted as the primary decision-making group within the provincial police headquarters . 
Mir [PER Alam  ] is but the most recent to join this brotherhood under [PER Mustafa  ] . 
Mir [PER Alam  ] is linked to [MISC Qanooni  ] and [PER Marshal Fahim  ] and is also said to share a very good relationship with Acting Minister of [ORG Interior Zarar.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With Mir Alams new police administration and the dismissal of most of the local authorities ( district and provincial ) , 12 of 16 ( 75 percent ) of the new chiefs of police in the province ( [ORG District Chiefs of Police  ] and the Provincial Chief of Police ) are the followers of [MISC HNA/Jamiat  ] . 
Of the 16 principal officers , 11 are [MISC Tajik  ] , four are [PER Pashtun  ] , and one is [MISC Uzbek.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unlike the highway police , there is more diversity among the senior officers of the [ORG ANP  ] in [LOC Baghlan:  ] two of the seven most influential authorities in this department are professional police officers , apparently without political affiliation ; three are linked to the [PER Andarabi  ] commanders ( [MISC HNA/Jamiat  ] ) ; but , most intriguing , is that two of the seven senior officers are closely linked to the Chief of [ORG Highway Police  ] , General [PER Khalil  ] . 
The ethnic breakdown for senior leadership in the [LOC Baghlan  ] Police Headquarters is 86 percent [MISC Tajik  ] and 14 percent [PER Pashtun.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The June 2005 appointment of General [PER Mir Alam  ] ( linked to Hezb-i-Naween ) , followed by the September 2005 appointment of [PER Mohammad Alam Rasekh  ] as the [LOC Baghlan  ] provincial governor ( linked to [MISC Jamiat  ] ) , has definitely reinforced the [MISC Tajik  ] dominance within the province and specifically within the police department . 
Due to the continued vacancy of the Minister of Interior position , MoI Deputies like General [PER Dawud  ] and Acting Minister [PER Zarar  ] are able to exert great influence in [LOC Baghlan  ] and reinforce [MISC HNA/Jamiat  ] control over all aspects of society , especially the riches of narco-trafficking. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PRT COMMENT: The rivalry between the [ORG ANP  ] and the highway police is becoming more and more pronounced , particularly over the control of drug trafficking and the general domination of [LOC Baghlan  ] province . 
Rather than providing stability , the police forces are among the principal destabilizing factors in the province . 
The recurrent theme in the northeast region remains Kabuls lack of political will to remove known warlords and drug traffickers from office , especially police chiefs . 
Dominant figures such as [PER Khalil  ] and [PER Mir Alam  ] continually undermine the legitimacy of the [MISC Afghan  ] central government , yet wield enough influence with powerful figures in [LOC Kabul  ] to maintain positions of authority indefinitely . 
If the security reform , [ORG DIAG  ] and counter narcotics efforts are to succeed , the police forces of [ORG Northeast Afghanistan  ] must be purged of their corrupt officers .
