( C ) SUMMARY: Opponents of a new bill before [MISC Italian  ] parliament that would further regulate the [MISC Internet  ] say it endangers free speech and is a threat to [MISC Italian  ] democracy . 
The bill also appears to favor PM [PER Berlusconi  ] 's [ORG Mediaset  ] television service while disadvantaging Sky , one of its major competitors . 
The [ORG GOI  ] says the bill is intended to implement an [ORG EU  ] directive that harmonizes media regulation and that the provisions being criticised are designed to establish greater protection of copyrighted material , to protect children from inappropriate broadcasts , and to keep consumers from paying twice by being subjected to excessive advertising on pay-TV channels . 
Opponents say the law far exceeds the scope and spirit of the [ORG EU  ] law and severely restricts free expression on the [MISC Internet  ] . 
Due to advertising and content regulation in the bill , some have read it as an effort to give [PER Berlusconi  ] greater control over communication and to drive out [ORG Mediaset  ] 's competitors . 
Implementation of the bill has been postponed from its original date of January 27 and parliament is holding hearings on the matter . 
The [ORG GOI  ] appears open to discussion of the bill 's text . 
While reaction to the bill has been strong among opposition politicians and telecom professionals , the issue has not made it to the front pages of newspapers so there has been no strong public reation . 
Despite [ORG GOI  ] protestations , the bill is troubling as it appears to have been written to give the government enough leeway to block or censor any [MISC Internet  ] content . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) According to the [ORG GOI  ] , the [PER Romani Bill  ] ( named for [PER Paolo Romani  ] , [ORG Deputy Economic Development Minister  ] , who covers communications issues ) is designed to implement [ORG EU  ] Directive 2007/65CE , which aims to harmonize media regulation in the [ORG EU  ] . 
Many telecom sector professionals , however , believe that the bill vastly exceeds the scope and spirit of the [ORG EU  ] law . 
The bill is complex , but there are three primary areas of concern: limits to uploading on the [MISC Interet  ] , television advertising ceilings , and limits to content aimed for adults , which would also restrict films judged by the [MISC Italian  ] rating system as being for those 14 and older . 
This would likely include the vast majority if not all [MISC U.S.-produced PG-13  ] movies. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - LIABILITY FOR VIDEO ON THE INTERNET - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Provisions contained in the bill would make [MISC Internet  ] service providers ( [MISC ISPs  ] ) , and hosting sites such as Blogspot and [ORG YouTube  ] , liable for content in the same way a television station is . 
In the strictest interpretation of the law , the sites and [MISC ISPs  ] would have to monitor all content on their sites , content which is uploaded by millions of individual users . 
This is widely viewed as impossible both in practical and economic terms . 
The [ORG Italian Communications Authority  ] ( [ORG AGCOM  ] ) would be responsible for oversight of the law , and some have interpreted the bill as requiring government permission before a video could be uploaded. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Antonello Busetto  ] , director of institutional relations for [ORG Confindustria Servizi Innovativi  ] e [PER Tecnologici  ] , a business association representing the interests of IT companies , said the measure would mean " the death of the [MISC Internet  ] in [LOC Italy  ] . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) [MISC Italian  ] communications commissioner [PER Nicola D'Angelo  ] was quoted in the press as saying , " [LOC Italy  ] will be the only [MISC Western  ] country in which it is necessary to have prior government permission to operate this kind of service...This aspect reveals a democratic risk , regardless of who happens to be in power . 
" Likewise , [ORG AGCOM  ] president [PER Corrado Calabro  ] has said that [LOC Italy  ] would be unique in the [LOC West  ] as imposing [MISC Internet  ] restrictions until now only imposed by authoritarian governments. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU ) The [ORG GOI  ] says the measure is aimed at protecting copyrighted material from being uploaded and downloaded [LOC ROME  ] 00000125 002 OF 003 illegally , as well as at monitoring other potentially illegal activity on the [MISC Internet  ] . 
The copyright industry has expressed some limited approval of the bill . 
[PER Enzo Mazza  ] , president of the [ORG Italian Music Federation  ] , said the music industry is generally in favor of making [MISC ISPs  ] and sites more responsible for protecting copyrighted material , though , he added that his industry 's analysis of the bill was focused on this aspect and not other implications. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( SBU ) Because this could make [MISC ISPs  ] and opinion sites liable for defamation in the way television broadcasts are , some see this as an effort to control political discourse on the [MISC Internet  ] . 
Others see a commercial angle aimed at limiting the video and TV available on the [MISC Internet  ] as [ORG Mediaset  ] moves into the [MISC Internet  ] Protocol Television ( IPTV ) market . 
[PER Alessandro Gilioli  ] , who writes a blog for the liberal weekly magazine Espresso wrote " It 's the [PER Berlusconi  ] method: Kill your potential enemies while they are small . 
That 's why anyone doing Web TV -- even from their attic at home -- must get ministerial approval and fulfill a host of other bureaucratic obligations . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( SBU ) [ORG AGCOM  ] would have the authority to enforce the law . 
Among the authority 's powers would be the ability to block traffic into [LOC Italy  ] of sites whose content did not meet the requirements of the law . 
For example , [ORG YouTube  ] could be blocked because the content was not uploaded with government approval . 
[ORG AGCOM  ] would also be able to levy fines of up to 150,000 euros against foreign companies violating the law . 
Though [ORG AGCOM  ] is theoretically an independent agency , many fear that it may not be strong enough to resist political pressure. - - - - - - - - - - - ADVERTISING CEILINGS - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The bill would place limits on advertising on pay-TV channels that exceed the [ORG EU  ] directive . 
It would reduce the [ORG EU  ] ceiling of 20% to 12% in [LOC Italy  ] by 2012 . 
The provision would penalize [ORG Sky  ] in particular . 
Some argue that the measure is designed to favor PM [PER Berlusconi  ] 's free-to-air [ORG Mediaset  ] channels , which would not be subject to the limit . 
[ORG Mediaset  ] 's pay channels would be subject to the advertising ceiling , but [ORG Mediaset  ] 's channels currently have less than 12% each hour dedicated to ads . 
In addition , reducing the overall possibility to advertise on pay-TV would push advertising towards free channels operated by [ORG Mediaset  ] and by the [MISC Italian  ] state network [ORG RAI  ] . 
[PER Busetto  ] said this would allow [PER Berlusconi  ] to earn more money and also to exercise greater control of public information. - - - - - - - - - ADULT CONTENT - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( SBU ) The bill places stringent time restrictions on broadcasting of so-called " adult content , " virtually prohibiting it between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m . 
Pay channels such as those offered by [ORG Sky  ] would be subject to the restrictions ; it appears pay-per-view content would be as well . 
Because they obtain a significant part of their income from pay adult content , pay-TV would suffer financially from this restriction . 
The bill would limit broadcast of any film rated for viewers above age 14 to after 10:30 p.m . 
One press report said this would make films such as Saturday [ORG Night Fever  ] unavailable until late-night . 
Again , some opponents worry that the objective is to hurt [ORG Mediaset  ] 's competition. - - - - - - - - [ORG EU  ] OPINION - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Opinion at the [ORG EU  ] appears to be conflicting . 
According to press reports , the [ORG EU  ] is threatening to start an infraction procedure against [LOC Italy  ] for failing to swiftly implement the media directive . 
At the same time , other press reports say the restrictions in the [MISC Italian  ] bill would likely violate the [ORG EU  ] e-commerce directive. - - - - - - - [LOC ROME  ] 00000125 003 OF 003 COMMENT - - - - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In official statements the government insists the bill is in no way intended to stifle free speech . 
Opponents are vocal and using alarmist language , but outside of telecom industries their numbers appear to be small . 
There has been no visible public outrage , and even [PER Beppe Grillo  ] , a public personality usually outspoken about government regulation , especially that involving the [MISC Internet  ] , has said very little. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) After [PER Berlusconi  ] was attacked in [LOC Milan  ] in December and a [ORG Facebook  ] fan page for his attacker quickly amassed fans , the [ORG GOI  ] expressed the need for regulation of social networking sites . 
At that time , [PER Romani  ] said the government would work with [MISC ISPs  ] and sites to develop a method of self-regulation and that there would be no attempt to legislate internet content . 
Despite [PER Romani  ] 's prior statements , this bill appears to have been written to give the government enough leeway to block or censor any [MISC Internet  ] content it deems defamatory or to be encouraging criminal activity. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) For years , the [ORG USG  ] has urged the [ORG GOI  ] to take action to protect copyrighted material on the [MISC Internet  ] , in particular encouraging the establishment of clear notice-and-takedown procedures and cooperation among rights holders and [MISC ISPs  ] to prevent illegal filesharing . 
[LOC Italy  ] has done very little . 
Now , this bill skips over collaboration , and suddenly moves directly to very stern regulation . 
In light of its reluctance to take action on this issue in the past , and also given the many commercial advantages that this law appears to give [ORG Mediaset  ] and state TV , the [ORG GOI  ] claim that [MISC Internet  ] provisions of this law are aimed at copyright protection alone are suspect. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) In all liklihood , if this bill were to become law as it is currently written , little would change immediately in the way [MISC Internet  ] sites operate in [LOC Italy  ] , and the average 11th grader uploading video to his blog would never be targeted for legal action . 
It would , however , provide a basis for legal actions against media operators that proved to be commercial or political competition for government figures . 
Over the last three years we have seen several [ORG GOI  ] efforts to exert control over the [MISC Internet  ] , including one infamous effort to require bloggers to obtain [ORG GOI  ] journalism licenses. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Advocates of [MISC Internet  ] freedom have repeatedly warned us that [LOC Italy  ] 's traditional elites -- on both sides of the political spectrum -- are very uncomfortable with the [MISC Internet  ] 's ability to bypass the traditional media that they control . 
Becasue this new bill seems to address these kinds of concerns , and because it also serves [PER Berlusconi  ] 's business interests , it is conceivable that this seemingly improbable legislation might actually come into force in [LOC Italy  ] . 
We note that officers from [ORG SKY  ] have told us that Deputy [ORG GOI  ] Minister [PER Romani  ] ( for whom the new bill is named ) has been leading efforts within the [ORG GOI  ] to help [PER Berlusconi  ] 's [ORG Mediaset  ] and to put [ORG SKY  ] at a disadvantage . 
This represents a familiar pattern: [PER Berslusoni  ] and [ORG Mediaset  ] have been using government power in this way ever since the days of Prime Minister [PER Bettino Craxi  ] . 
In addition , this bill would set precidents that nations such as china could copy or cite as justification for their own crackdowns on free speech .
