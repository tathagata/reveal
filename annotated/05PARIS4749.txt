( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Islamic/international terrorism investigating judge [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told Poloffs May 6 that his section 's open-ended investigation into potential " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] " has become their current priority . 
With two networks already discovered , [MISC French  ] authorities fear that " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] " is a growing problem not unique to [LOC France  ] , and one that will affect other [ORG EU  ] countries . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also discussed the ex-Guantanamo ( [ORG GTMO  ] ) detainees ( with the news that one detainee may be released ) , the recent announcement of a [ORG GOF  ] " white paper " on terrorism , and C/T resource issues and rivalries within the [MISC French  ] government . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- PRIORITY ON " JIHADISTS TO [LOC IRAQ  ] " INVESTIGATION --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC French  ] press reported the arrests April 24 and 25 of six people in the [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Marseilles  ] areas suspected of involvement in the recruitment and sending of potential jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
This is the second network uncovered in [LOC France  ] since an inquiry by the terrorism investigating judges into " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] " first began in September 2004 . 
In comparison to the first network ( reftel ) , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said two of the suspects recently arrested had significant , long-standing ties to [MISC Islamist  ] circles . 
One of them , Said al-Maghrebi , had in the past recruited [MISC European  ] Muslims to fight in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he believed that [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Europe  ] in general , was facing only the beginning stages of attempts to form networks to fight jihad in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
As an example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG GOF  ] investigations into this most recent network revealed that the suspects had significant ties to other [MISC Islamists  ] in [LOC England  ] . 
The open-ended " jihadists to [LOC Iraq  ] " investigation is now the priority , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , based on the premise that those going to [LOC Iraq  ] not only endanger Coalition forces and [MISC Iraqi  ] stability , but upon return to [LOC Europe  ] , might constitute a significant terrorist threat. --------------------------------------------- ----------- ONE EX-GTMO DETAINEE MAY BE RELEASED " BEFORE THE SUMMER " --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) When asked about the status of the six ex-GTMO detainees currently in pre-trial detention , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said his office was considering the release and dropping of charges against [PER Imad Kanouni  ] , one of the original four ex-GTMO detainees transferred to [MISC French  ] custody . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Kanouni  ] had never undergone military training in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and though active in extremist religious circles , they had no evidence linking him to terrorism planning . 
The continued detention of [PER Kanouni  ] could damage [ORG GOF  ] cases against the others , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He said his office depended significantly upon its reputation within the [MISC French  ] justice system , which tends to give the terrorism investigating judges the benefit of the doubt . 
( As an example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the proof against recently convicted [PER Djamel Beghal  ] and his accomplices , accused of plotting to bomb the [PER US Embassy  ] , would not normally be sufficient to convict them , but he believed his office was successful because of their reputation . 
) If they proceeded to trial with the information they currently possessed on [PER Kanouni  ] , it would be clear that the judges had been holding [PER Kanouni  ] without sufficient evidence . 
Therefore , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and fellow investigating judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] are in favor of his release . 
Although he cautioned that a formal decision had not yet been made , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Kanouni  ] may be released " before the summer . 
" Turning to the eventual trial of the ex-GTMO detainees , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he was in favor of trying them separately to avoid the spectacle of multiple defense attorneys arrayed against one prosecutor. ------------------------------------ [ORG GOF  ] TO ANALYZE C/T IN A " WHITE BOOK " ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Raffarin  ] announced on May 3 the long-rumored commencement of a [ORG GOF  ] " white paper " on internal security and terrorism . 
Specifically , the goal of the white paper will be to analyze and report on the type of terrorism [LOC France  ] might face in 2020 and the government 's potential responses . 
The report will be written by the General [ORG Secretariat for National Defense  ] ( [ORG SGDN  ] ) in conjunction with [MISC SIPDIS  ] the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , and will be given to President [PER Chirac  ] in early 2006 . 
The paper encompasses six areas , all of which are being led by different ministries and individuals . 
[PER Pierre de Bousquet de Florian  ] , head of the DST ( [LOC France  ] 's internal security service ) , will lead a group studying possible threats ; [PER Pierre Brochand  ] , head of the [ORG DGSE  ] ( [LOC France  ] 's external intelligence service ) , will study terrorist threats to world stability ; [PER Jean-Michel Hubert  ] , vice-president of the general council on information technology within the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , spearheads a group director of [ORG Criminal Affairs  ] within the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , will lead a group studying the role of the legal system in combatting terrorism ; [PER Stanislas Lefebvre  ] de [PER Laboulaye  ] , [ORG U/S for Political Affairs-equivalent  ] at the [ORG MFA  ] , will study international C/T cooperation ; and [PER Francois Heisbourg  ] , director of the [ORG Foundation for Strategic Research  ] thinktank ( an organization closely linked to the [MISC French  ] government ) will lead a group studying the involvement of citizens and public outreach to combat terrorism . 
[PER Heisbourg  ] already heads an effort by the [ORG GOF  ] to put online a publicly accessible database on terrorism . 
When asked about the " white book , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he hoped it would result in the passage of stiffer penalties for " terrorism conspiracy " charges , which currently carries with it a maximum prison sentence of ten years . 
A contact in the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] told [MISC Poloff  ] May 4 that the [ORG GOF  ] hopes its white book will be taken up for discussion by the [ORG European Union  ] , with the goal of applying many of its conclusions to the [ORG EU  ] 's counter-terrorism approach. --------------------------------- C/T RESOURCE ISSUES AND RIVALRIES --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) With the announcement in early April by Justice Minister [PER Perben  ] that additional magistrates will be assigned to counter-terrorism , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said his section in the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor 's office will likely grow from its current number of five investigating judges to seven within the next year . 
He said the investigating judges will also be given additional support staff . 
Recruiting the investigating judges has been difficult at first , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , given that he and [PER Bruguiere  ] and the other veteran judges - [PER Gilbert Thiel  ] and [PER Laurence le Vert  ] - have a distinct , more hierarchical , work environment than is usually the case in the [MISC French  ] judiciary . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also commented on recent press articles on a renewed attempt by [ORG DNAT  ] ( the [ORG National Counter-Terrorism Division  ] , a section of [LOC France  ] 's judiciary police ) to wrest away from the DST that service 's near-monopoly on [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism investigations . 
Currently , [ORG DNAT  ] focuses on [MISC Corsican  ] and [MISC Basque  ] terrorism investigations . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed that the DST would continue its primary role , given that it also is in charge of international liaison , and as such , it is the recipient of terrorism-related information from other countries , which is a key component of [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism investigations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
