Reason 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Introduction: [LOC Chechnya  ] has been less in the glare of constant international attention in recent years . 
However , the [LOC Chechnya  ] conflict remains unresolved , and the suffering of the [MISC Chechen  ] people and the threat of instability throughout the region remain . 
This message reinterprets the history of the [MISC Chechen  ] wars as a means of better understanding the current dynamics , the challenges facing [LOC Russia  ] , the way in which the [LOC Kremlin  ] perceives those challenges , and the factors limiting the Kremlin’s ability to respond . 
It draws on close observation on the ground and conversations with many participants in and observers of the conflict from the moment of [MISC Chechnya’s  ] declaration of independence in 1991 . 
We intend this message to spur thinking on new approaches to a tragedy that persists as an issue within [LOC Russia  ] and between [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Europe  ] and the [MISC Islamic  ] world . 
Summary -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Putin  ] has pursued a two-pronged strategy to extricate [LOC Russia  ] from the war in [LOC Chechnya  ] and establish a viable long-term modus vivendi preserving Moscow’s role as the ultimate arbiter of [MISC Chechen  ] affairs . 
The first prong was to gain control of the [MISC Russian  ] military deployed there , which had long operated without real central control and was intent on staying as long as its officers could profit from the war . 
The second prong was “Chechenization , ” which in effect means turning [LOC Chechnya  ] over to former nationalist separatists willing to profess loyalty to [LOC Russia  ] . 
There are two difficulties with [MISC Putin’s  ] strategy . 
First , while Chechenization has been successful in suppressing nationalist separatists within [LOC Chechnya  ] , it has not been as effective against the Jihadist militants , who have broadened their focus and are gaining strength throughout the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
Second , as long as former separatist warlords run [LOC Chechnya  ] , [MISC Russian  ] forces will have to stay in numbers sufficient to ensure that the ex-separatists remain “ex.” More broadly , the suffering of an abused and victimized population will continue , and with it the alienation that feeds the insurgency. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) To deal effectively with [LOC Chechnya  ] in the long term , [PER Putin  ] needs to increase his control over the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG Power Ministries  ] and reduce opportunities for them to profit from war corruption . 
He needs to strengthen [MISC Russian  ] civilian engagement , reinforcing the role of his Plenipotentiary Representative . 
He needs to take a broad approach to combat the spread of [LOC Jihadism  ] , and not rely primarily on suppression by force . 
In this context there is only a limited role for the [LOC U.S.  ] , but we and our allies can help by expressing our concerns to [PER Putin  ] , directing assistance to areas where our programs can slow the spread of [LOC Jihadism  ] , and working with [MISC Russia’s  ] southern neighbors to minimize the effects of instability . 
End Summary . 
The Starting [MISC Point: Problems of the  ] “Russianized” Conflict --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Chechnya  ] was only one of the conflicts that broke out in the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] at the time of the country’s collapse . 
Territorial conflicts , most of them separatist , erupted in [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] , [LOC Transnistria  ] , [LOC South Ossetia  ] , [LOC North Ossetia/Ingushetia  ] , [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] troops were involved in combat in all of those conflicts , sometimes clandestinely . 
In all except [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] , [MISC Russian  ] troops remain today as peacekeepers . 
[LOC Russia  ] doggedly insists on this presence and resists pulling its forces out . 
Its diplomatic efforts have served to keep the conflicts frozen , with [MISC Russian  ] troops remaining in place. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Why is this ? 
The charge is often made that [MISC Russia’s  ] motive for keeping the conflicts frozen is geostrategic , or “neo-imperialism , ” or fear of [ORG NATO  ] , or revenge against [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Moldova  ] , or a quest to preserve leverage . 
Indeed , the continued deployments may satisfy those [MISC Russians  ] who think in such terms , and expand the domestic consensus for sending troops throughout the [ORG CIS  ] . 
However , while one or another of those factors may have been the original impulse , each of the conflicts has gone through phases in which the conflict’s perceived uses for the [MISC Russian  ] state have changed . 
No one of these factors has been continuous over the life of any of the conflicts. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) We would propose an additional factor: the determination of [MISC Russia’s  ] senior officer corps to remain deployed in those countries to engage in lucrative activity outside their official military tasks . 
Sometimes that [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 002 OF 010 activity has been as mercenaries -- for instance , [MISC Russian  ] active-duty soldiers fought on both sides in the [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] conflict from 1991-92 . 
Sometimes it has involved narcotics smuggling , as in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
Selling arms to all sides has been a long-standing tradition . 
And sometimes it has meant collaborating with the mafias of both sides in conflict to facilitate contraband trade across the lines , as in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
The officers and their generals formed a powerful bloc in favor of all the deployments , especially under [MISC Yeltsin.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) This “military-entrepreneurial” bloc soon formed an autonomous institution , in some respects outside the government’s control . 
There are many illustrations of its autonomy . 
For instance , in 1993 [PER Yeltsin  ] reached an agreement with [LOC Georgia  ] on peacekeeping in [LOC Abkhazia  ] . 
When the [MISC Georgian  ] delegation arrived in [LOC Sochi  ] in September of that year to hammer out the details with [MISC Russia’s  ] generals , they found the deal had changed . 
When they protested that [PER Yeltsin  ] had agreed to other terms , a [MISC Russian  ] general replied , “Let the President sit in [LOC Moscow  ] , drink vodka , and chase women . 
That’s his business . 
We are here , and we have our work to do.” The [ORG Secret History of the Chechen War  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The lack of central control over the military , as well as officers’ cupidity , may have been a prime cause of the first [ORG Chechnya War  ] . 
Immediately after the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , energy prices in the “ruble zone” were 3 percent of world market prices . 
Government officials and their partners bought oil at ruble prices , diverted it abroad , and sold it on the world market . 
The military joined in this arbitrage . 
[PER Pavel Grachev  ] , then Defense Minister , reportedly diverted oil to [ORG Western Group of Forces  ] commander [ORG Burlakov  ] , who sold it in [LOC Germany.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Chechnya  ] was a major entrepot for laundering oil for this arbitrage . 
It appears to have been used both by the military ( including [PER Grachev  ] ) and the [MISC Khasbulatov-Rutskoy  ] axis in the [ORG Duma  ] . 
[PER Dudayev  ] had declared independence , but remained part of the [MISC Russian  ] elite . 
Chechnya’s independence , oilfields , refineries and pipelines made [LOC Chechnya  ] perfect for laundering oil . 
Planes , trains , buses and roads and pipelines to [LOC Chechnya  ] were functioning , allowing anyone and anything to transit -- except auditors . 
In the early 1990’s millions of tons of “Russian” oil entered [LOC Chechnya  ] and were magically transformed into “Chechen” oil to be sold on the world market at world prices . 
Some of the proceeds went to buy the [MISC Chechens  ] weaponry , most of it from the [MISC Russian  ] military , and another lucrative trade developed . 
[PER Dudayev  ] took much of his cut of the proceeds in weapons . 
The [ORG Groznyy Bazaar  ] was notorious in the early 1990s for the quantity and variety of arms for sale , including heavy weaponry. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Chechnya  ] was the home of [PER Ruslan Khasbulatov  ] and served various purposes for his faction of the [MISC Russian  ] elite . 
He took advantage of the army’s independence from Yeltsin’s control . 
An informed source believes that it was [PER Khasbulatov  ] , not the “official” [MISC Russian  ] government , who facilitated the transfer of [PER Shamil Basayev  ] and his heavily-armed fighters from [LOC Chechnya  ] into [LOC Abkhazia  ] in 1992 , and who ordered the [MISC Russian  ] air force to bomb [LOC Sukhumi  ] when [PER Shevardnadze  ] went there to take personal command of the [MISC Georgians’  ] last stand in July 1993 . 
The [PER Yeltsin  ] government always denied that it bombed [LOC Sukhumi  ] , despite [MISC Western  ] eyewitness accounts confirming the bombing and the insignia on the planes . 
Given the confusion of those years , it could well be that the order originated in the [ORG Duma  ] , not the [LOC Kremlin.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) After [PER Khasbulatov  ] and [PER Rutskoy  ] were written out of the [MISC Russian  ] equation in October 1993 , so was [PER Dudayev  ] . 
Clandestine [MISC Russian  ] support for the [MISC Chechen  ] political and military opposition to [PER Dudayev  ] began in the spring of 1994 , according to participants . 
When that proved ineffective , [MISC Russian  ] bombing was deployed . 
( One [PER Dudayev  ] opponent recounted that in 1994 a [MISC Russian  ] pilot was given a mission to fire a missile into one of the top-floor corners of Groznyy’s Presidency building at a time when [PER Dudayev  ] was scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting there . 
Not knowing [LOC Groznyy  ] , the pilot asked which building to bomb , and was told “the tallest one.” He bombed a residential apartment building . 
) When air power , too , proved ineffective , [MISC Russian  ] troops were secretly sent in to reinforce the armed opposition . 
Dudayev’s forces captured about a dozen and put them on television -- and the [MISC Russian  ] invasion began shortly thereafter. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Given the gangsterish background of the war , it is no surprise that the military conducted the war itself as a profit-making enterprise , especially after the capture of [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 003 OF 010 [LOC Groznyy  ] . 
By May 1995 an anti-Dudayev [MISC Chechen  ] could lament , “When we invited the [MISC Russian  ] army in we expected an army -- not this band of marauders.” Contraband trade in oil , weapons ( including direct sales from [MISC Russian  ] military stores to the insurgents ) , drugs , and liquor , plus “protection” for legitimate trade made military service in [LOC Chechnya  ] lucrative for those not on the front lines . 
This profitability ended only with the August 1996 defeat of [MISC Russian  ] forces in [LOC Groznyy  ] at the hands of the insurgents and the subsequent [MISC Russian  ] withdrawal -- a defeat made possible because the [MISC Russian  ] forces were hollowed out by their officers’ corruption and pursuit of economic profit. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Before they lost this “cash-cow” to their enemies , [MISC Russian  ] officers went to great lengths to keep their friends from interfering with their profits . 
On July 30 , 1995 , the [MISC Russians  ] and the [MISC Chechen  ] insurgents signed a cease-fire agreement mediated by the [ORG OSCE  ] . 
It would have meant the gradual withdrawal of [MISC Russian  ] forces . 
Enforcing the cease-fire was a [ORG Joint Observation Commission  ] ( “SNK” ) . 
The head of the [MISC SNK  ] was General [PER Anatoliy Romanov  ] , a competent and upright officer -- very much a rarity in [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
After two months at this assignment he was severely injured by a mine inside [LOC Groznyy  ] , and has been hospitalized ever since . 
Informed observers believe Romanov’s own colleagues in the [MISC Russian  ] forces carried out this murder attempt . 
The cease-fire , never enforced , broke down. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) When the second war began in September 1999 , [MISC Russian  ] forces again started profiteering from a trade in contraband oil . 
[MISC Western  ] eyewitnesses reported convoys of [MISC Russian  ] army trucks carrying oil leaving [LOC Groznyy  ] under cover of night . 
Eventually the [MISC Russian  ] forces reached an understanding with the insurgent fighters . 
Seeing one such convoy , a [MISC Western  ] reporter asked his guerrilla hosts whether the fighters ever attacked such convoys. “No , ” the leader replied. “They leave us alone and we leave them alone.” [MISC No Exit  ] for [PER Putin  ] ----------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Sometime between one and two years after [MISC Russian  ] forces were unleashed for a second time on [LOC Chechnya  ] , [PER Putin  ] appears to have realized that they were not going to deliver a neat victory . 
That failure would make [PER Putin  ] look weak at home , the human rights violations would estrange the [LOC West  ] , and the drain on the [MISC Russian  ] treasury would be punishing ( this was before the dramatic rise in energy prices ) . 
[PER Putin  ] could not negotiate a peace with [MISC Maskhadov:  ] he had already rejected that course and could not back down without appearing weak . 
The [MISC Khasavyurt  ] accords that ended the first war were the result of defeat ; a new set of accords would be seen as a new defeat . 
In any case , the history of the war ( and the fate of General [PER Romanov  ] ) made clear that negotiations without the subordination of the military were a physical impossibility. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] thus found himself without a winning strategy and had to develop one . 
He has taken a two-pronged approach . 
One prong was subordinating the military . 
The appointment of [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] as Defense Minister appears to have been aimed at subjecting the military to the control of the security services . 
A series of reassignments and firings is the surface evidence of the struggle to subordinate the military in [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
[ORG Southern Military District  ] commander [PER Troshev  ] , who led the 1999 invasion , refused outright the first orders transferring him to [LOC Siberia  ] in November 2002 , and went on television to publicize his mutiny . 
He was finally removed in February 2003 . 
Chief of the Defense [PER Staff Kvashnin  ] , who had held the [ORG Southern District  ] command during the first [MISC Chechen  ] war , hung on in a combative relationship with [PER Ivanov  ] for three years until he , too , was replaced in 2004 ( and also sent to [LOC Siberia  ] as the Presidential Representative in [LOC Novosibirsk  ] ) . 
The spring 2005 dismissal of General [PER Viktor Kazantsev  ] , [PER Putin’s Plenipotentiary  ] Representative in the [ORG Southern Federal District  ] , was reportedly the final link in the chain . 
Military corruption , and feeding at the trough of [LOC Chechnya  ] , has not ended , but the corruption has reportedly been “institutionalized” and more closely regulated in [LOC Kremlin-controlled  ] channels . 
[PER Chechenization  ] , [PER Ahmad-Haji Kadyrov  ] , and the [MISC Salafists  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The second prong of [PER Putin’s  ] strategy was to hand the fighting over to [MISC Chechens.  ] “Chechenization” differs from Vietnamization or Iraqification . 
In those strategies , a loyalist force is strengthened to the point at which it can carry on the fight itself . 
[PER Chechenization  ] , in contrast , has meant handing [LOC Chechnya  ] over to the guerrillas in exchange for their professions of loyalty , the formal retention of [LOC Chechnya  ] within the [LOC Russian Federation  ] , and an uneasy [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 004 OF 010 cooperation with [ORG Federal  ] authorities that in practice is constantly re-negotiated. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Chechenization  ] is associated with [PER Ahmad-Haji Kadyrov  ] , the insurgent commander and chief [PER Mufti  ] of separatist [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
After he defected to the [MISC Russians  ] , [PER Putin  ] put him in charge of the new [MISC Russian-installed Chechen  ] administration . 
[PER Chechenization  ] was reportedly agreed between [PER Kadyrov  ] and [PER Putin  ] personally . 
But the seeds of the policy were sown by a split in the insurgent ranks dating to the first war . 
That split that took the form of a religious dispute , though it masked a power struggle among warlords . 
The split is the direct result of the introduction of a new element: [MISC Arab  ] forces espousing a pan-Islamic Jihadist religious ideology. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) The traditional [MISC Islam  ] of [LOC Dagestan  ] , [LOC Chechnya  ] and [LOC Ingushetia  ] is based on [MISC Sufism  ] , or [MISC Islamic  ] mysticism . 
Though nominally the [MISC Sufi  ] orders were the same as those predominant in [LOC Central Asia  ] and [LOC Kurdistan  ] -- [ORG Naqshbandi  ] and [ORG Qadiri  ] -- [PER Sufism  ] in the [LOC Northeast Caucasus  ] took on a unique form in the 18th-19th century struggle against [MISC Russian  ] encroachment . 
It is usually called “muridism.” Murids were armed acolytes of a hieratic commander , the murshid . 
[PER Shaykh Shamil  ] , the [ORG Naqshbandi  ] murshid who led the mountaineers’ resistance to the [MISC Russians  ] until his capture in 1859 , was both a spiritual guide and a military commander . 
He also exercised government powers . 
The largest [MISC Sufi  ] branch ( “vird” ) in [LOC Chechnya  ] is the [MISC Kunta-Haji  ] “vird” of the [MISC Qadiris  ] , founded and led by the charismatic [MISC Chechen  ] missionary [PER Kunta-Haji Kishiyev  ] until his exile by the [MISC Russians  ] in 1864 . 
Although the historical [PER Kunta-Haji  ] died two years later , his followers believe that [PER Kunta-Haji  ] lives on in occultation , like the [MISC Shi’a Twelfth Imam.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) When [MISC Arab  ] fighters joined the [MISC Chechen  ] conflict in 1995 , they brought with them a “Salafist” doctrine that attempts to emulate the fundamental , “pure” [MISC Islam  ] of the Prophet [PER Muhammad  ] and his immediate successors , especially ‘Umar , the second [MISC Caliph  ] . 
It holds that mysticism is one of the “impurities” that crept into [MISC Islam  ] after the first four [MISC Caliphs  ] , and considers [PER Sufis  ] to be heretics and idolaters . 
The idea that [MISC Kunta-Haji  ] adepts could believe their founder is still alive -- and that they worship the grave of his mother -- is an abomination to [PER Salafis  ] , who believe that marked graves are a form of pagan ancestor worship ( Muhammad’s grave in [LOC Arabia  ] is not marked ) . <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [MISC Wahhabism-based  ] forms of [MISC Islam  ] started appearing in [LOC Chechnya  ] by 1991 , as [MISC Chechens  ] were able to travel and some went to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] for religious study . 
But the true influx of [PER Salafis  ] ( usually lumped together with [LOC Wahhabis  ] in [LOC Russia  ] ) came during the first [MISC Chechen  ] war . 
In February 1995 Fathi ‘Ali al-Shishani , a [MISC Jordanian  ] of [MISC Chechen  ] descent , arrived in [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
A veteran of the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he was now too old to be a combatant , but was a missionary for [MISC Salafism  ] . 
He recruited another [MISC Afghan  ] veteran , the [MISC Saudi  ] al-Khattab , to come to [LOC Chechnya  ] and lead a group of [MISC Arab  ] fighters. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Al-Khattab’s fighters were never a major military factor during the war , but they were the key to [LOC Gulf  ] money , which financed power struggles in the inter-war years . 
Al-Khattab forged close links with [PER Shamil Basayev  ] , the most famous [MISC Chechen  ] field commander . 
[PER Basayev  ] himself was from a [ORG Qadiri  ] family , but he was too Sovietized to view [MISC Islam  ] as anything more than part of the [MISC Chechen  ] and Caucasus identity . 
In his early interviews , [PER Basayev  ] showed himself to be motivated by [MISC Chechen  ] nationalism , not religion , though he paid lip-service -- e.g. , proclaiming [ORG Sharia  ] law in [LOC Vedeno  ] in early 1995 -- to attract [LOC Gulf  ] donors . 
Basayev’s initial interest in al-Khattab , as indeed with other jihadists starting even before the first war , was purely financial. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) After the first war , al-Khattab set up a camp in [LOC Serzhen-Yurt  ] ( “Baza Kavkaz” ) for military and religious indoctrination . 
It provided one of the few employment opportunities for demobilized [MISC Chechen  ] fighters between the wars . 
[PER Young Chechens  ] had traditionally engaged in seasonal migrant construction work throughout the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , but after the first war that was no longer open to them . 
The closed international borders also precluded smuggling -- another pre-war source of employment and income . 
The fighters had no money , no jobs , no education , no skills save with their guns , and no prospects . 
Al-Khattab’s offer of food , shelter and work was inviting . 
As a result , between the wars [MISC Salafism  ] spread quickly in [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
( Al-Khattab also invited missionaries and facilitators who set up shop in [LOC Chechnya  ] , [LOC Dagestan  ] and [PER Georgia’s Pankisi Gorge  ] , whose Kist residents are close relatives of the [MISC Chechens  ] . 
) [ORG Battle Lines  ] in Peacetime [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 005 OF 010 ------------------------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [MISC Chechen  ] society is distinguished by its propensity to unite in war and fragment in peace . 
It is based on opposing dichotomies: the Vaynakh peoples are divided into [MISC Chechens  ] and [MISC Ingush  ] ; the [MISC Chechens  ] are divided into highlanders ( “Lameroi” ) and lowlanders ( “Nokhchi” ) ; and these are further divided into tribal confederations and exogamous tribes ( “teyp” ) and their subdivisions . 
Each unit will unite with its opposite to combat a threat from outside . 
Two lowland teyps , for example , will drop quarrels and unite against an intruding highland teyp . 
But left to themselves , they will quarrel and split . 
After the Khasavyurt accords , when [LOC Russia  ] left the [MISC Chechens  ] alone , the wartime alliance between [PER Maskhadov  ] and [PER Basayev  ] split and the two became enemies . 
Other warlords lined up on one side or the other -- the [MISC Yamadayev  ] brothers of [LOC Gudermes  ] , for example , fighting a pitched battle against [PER Basayev  ] in 1999 . 
But the rise of [PER Basayev  ] and al-Khattab undermined Maskhadov’s authority and prevented him from exercising any real power. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) This power struggle took on a religious expression . 
Since [PER Basayev  ] was associated with al-Khattab and [MISC Salafism  ] , [PER Maskhadov  ] positioned himself as champion of traditional [PER Sufism  ] . 
He surrounded himself with [MISC Sufi  ] shaykhs and appointed [PER Ahmad-Haji Kadyrov  ] , a strong adherent of [PER Kunta-Haji Sufism  ] , as [PER Chechnya’s Mufti  ] . 
[PER Kadyrov  ] had spent six years in [LOC Uzbekistan  ] , allegedly at religious seminaries in [LOC Tashkent  ] and [LOC Bukhara  ] , and seems to have developed links to other enemies of [PER Basayev  ] , including the [MISC Yamadayevs.  ] <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) The religious division dictated certain policies to each side . 
The [MISC Sufi  ] tradition of [PER Maskhadov  ] and [PER Kadyrov  ] had been associated for over two centuries with nationalist resistance . 
[PER Basayev  ] , with his new-found commitment to al-Khattab’s [MISC Salafism  ] , adopted the [ORG Salafi  ] stress on a pan-Islamic community ( “umma” ) fighting a worldwide jihad , notionally without regard for ethnic or national boundaries . 
Al-Khattab and [PER Basayev  ] invaded [LOC Dagestan  ] in August 1999 , avowedly in pursuit of a [MISC Caucasus-wide  ] revolt against the [MISC Russians  ] . 
They brought on a [MISC Russian  ] invasion that threw [PER Maskhadov  ] out of [LOC Groznyy  ] . 
Chechenization Begins --------------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) The second [MISC Russian  ] invasion did not unite the [MISC Chechens  ] , as previous pressure had . 
Perhaps the influence of al-Khattab and his Salafists , as well as the devastation of the first war , had rent the fabric of [MISC Chechen  ] society too much to restore traditional unity in the face of the outside threat . 
( We should also remember that unity is relative . 
Only a small percentage of the [MISC Chechens  ] actually fought in the first war , and many supported the [MISC Russians  ] out of disgust with [PER Dudayev  ] . 
) [PER Kadyrov  ] and the [MISC Yamadayevs  ] separately broke with [PER Maskhadov  ] and defected to the [MISC Russians  ] . 
[PER Kadyrov  ] began to recruit from the insurgency non-Salafist nationalist fighters who were highly demoralized and disoriented by the disastrous retreat from [LOC Groznyy  ] in late 1999 . 
[PER Kadyrov  ] began to preach what [PER Kunta-Haji  ] had preached after the [MISC Russian  ] victory over [PER Imam Shamil  ] in 1859: to survive , the [MISC Chechens  ] needed tactically to accept [MISC Russian  ] rule . 
His message struck a chord , and fighters began to defect to his side. <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] appears to have stumbled upon [PER Kadyrov  ] , and their alliance seems to have grown out of chance as much as design . 
But they were able to forge a deal along the following lines: [PER Kadyrov  ] would declare loyalty to [LOC Russia  ] and deliver loyalty to [PER Putin  ] ; he would take over Maskhadov’s place at the head of the [MISC Russian-blessed  ] government of [LOC Chechnya  ] ; he would try to win over Maskhadov’s fighters , to whom he could promise immunity ; he would govern [LOC Chechnya  ] with full autonomy , without interference from [MISC Russian  ] officials below Putin’s level ; and he would try to exterminate [PER Basayev  ] and [PER Al-Khattab.  ] <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) If the objective of Chechenization was to win over fighters who would carry on the fight against [PER Basayev  ] and the [MISC Arab  ] successors to [PER Khattab  ] ( who was poisoned in April 2002 ) , it has to be judged a success . 
The real fighting has for several years been carried out by [MISC Chechen  ] forces who fight the war they want to fight -- not the one the [MISC Russian  ] military wants them to -- and who appear happy to kill [MISC Russians  ] when they get in the way . 
The [MISC Russian  ] military is “just trying to survive , ” as one officer put it . 
Not all the pro-Moscow [MISC Chechen  ] units are composed of former guerrillas . 
[PER Said-Magomed Kakiyev  ] , commander of the [MISC GRU-controlled  ] “West” battalion , has been fighting [PER Dudayev  ] and his successors since 1993 . 
But at the heart of the pro-Moscow effort are fighters who defected from the anti-Moscow insurgency . 
The [ORG Military Overstays Its Welcome MOSCOW  ] 00005645 006 OF 010 ---------------------------------- <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) The development of [MISC Kadyrov’s  ] fighting force , along with that of the [MISC Yamadayev  ] brothers , left the stage clear for a drawdown of [MISC Russian  ] troops , certainly by early 2004 ( leaving aside a permanent garrison presence ) . 
But those troops , still not fully responsive to FSB control , did not want to leave . 
Especially now that [MISC Chechens  ] had taken over increasing parts of the security portfolio , the [MISC Russian  ] officers were free to concentrate on their economic activities , and in particular oil smuggling. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) [PER Kadyrov  ] could not be fully autonomous until he -- not the [MISC Russians  ] -- controlled [MISC Chechnya’s  ] oil . 
He therefore demanded the creation of a [MISC Chechen  ] oil company under his jurisdiction . 
That would have severely limited the ability of federal forces to divert and smuggle oil . 
On May 9 , 2004 , [PER Kadyrov  ] was assassinated by an enormous bomb planted under his seat at the annual [MISC VE Day  ] celebration . 
The killing was officially ascribed to [MISC Chechen  ] rebels , but many believe it was the [MISC Russian  ] Army’s way of rejecting [MISC Kadyrov’s  ] demand . 
Under the circumstances , one cannot exclude that both versions are true . 
In the Reign of [PER Ramzan  ] ---------------------- <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( C ) [MISC Kadyrov’s  ] passing left power in the hands of his son [PER Ramzan  ] , who was officially made Deputy Prime Minister . 
The President , [PER Alu Alkhanov  ] , was a figurehead put in place because [PER Ramzan  ] was underage . 
The Prime Minister , [PER Sergey Abramov  ] , was tasked with interfacing between [PER Kadyrov  ] and [LOC Moscow  ] below the level of [PER Putin.  ] <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( C ) [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] has none of the religious or personal prestige that his father had . 
He is a warlord pure and simple -- one of several , like the [PER Yamadayev  ] family of warlords . 
He is lucky , however , in that his father left him a sufficient fighting force of ex-rebels . 
Though they may have been lured away from the insurgency for a variety of reasons , it is money that keeps them . 
[PER Kadyrov  ] feels little need for ideological or religious prestige , though he makes an occasional statement designed to appeal to [MISC Muslims  ] , and makes a point of supporting the pilgrimage to the tomb of [MISC Kunta-Haji’s  ] mother in [LOC Gunoy  ] , near [LOC Vedeno  ] ( though that is in part to show he is stronger than [PER Basayev  ] , whose home and power base are in the [LOC Vedeno  ] region ) . 
[PER Kadyrov  ] must only satisfy his troops , who on occasion have shown that , if offended or not given enough , they are willing to desert along with their kinsmen and return to the mountains to fight against him . 
He must also guard against the possibility , as some charge , that some of the fighters who went over to Federal forces did so under orders from guerrilla commanders for whom they are still working. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( C ) [PER Kadyrov  ] is also fortunate in that the FSB , with whom he has close ties , has by this time emasculated the military as “prong one” of Putin’s strategy . 
[PER Kadyrov  ] has slowly but surely also taken over most of the spigots of money that once fed the army , and like his father he has started agitating for overt control over [MISC Chechnya’s  ] oil ( while prudently ensuring that others take the lead on that in public ) . 
[PER Kadyrov  ] is at least as corrupt as the military , but the money he expropriates for himself from Moscow’s subsidies is accepted as his pay-off for keeping things quiet . 
And indeed [PER Kadyrov  ] and the other warlords are capable of maintaining a certain degree of security in [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
The showy “reconstruction” developments they have built in [LOC Groznyy  ] and their home towns demonstrate that the guerrillas cannot or at least do not halt construction and economic activity . 
Moreover , there is enough security to end Putin’s worries about a secessionist victory . 
That has allowed [PER Putin  ] to demonstrate a new willingness to be increasingly overt in support of separatism in other conflicts ( e.g. , [LOC Abkhazia  ] , [LOC Transnistria  ] ) when that advances [MISC Russian  ] interests. <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( C ) Despite its successes to date , however , Putin’s strategy is far from completed . 
He still needs to keep forces in the region as a constant reminder to [PER Kadyrov  ] not to backtrack on his professed loyalty to the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
Ideally , that force would be small but capable of intervening effectively in [MISC Chechen  ] internal affairs . 
That is unrealistic at present . 
The current forces , reportedly over 25,000 , are bunkered and corrupt . 
When they venture on patrol they are routinely attacked . 
One attempt to redress this is to position [MISC Russian  ] forces close but “over the horizon” in [LOC Dagestan  ] , where a major military base is under construction at [LOC Botlikh  ] . 
However , that may only add to the instability of [LOC Dagestan  ] . 
A Duma Deputy from the region told us that locals are vehemently opposed to the new military base , despite the economic opportunities it represents , on grounds that the soldiers will “corrupt the morals of their children.” [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 007 OF 010 <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( C ) Another approach is the Chechenization of the Federal forces themselves . 
Recently “North” and “South” battalions of ethnically [MISC Chechen  ] special forces -- drawn from [MISC Kadyrov’s  ] militia -- were created to supplement the “East” and “West” battalions of [PER Sulim Yamadayev  ] and [PER Said-Magomed Kakiyev  ] . 
Those formations are officially part of the [MISC Russian  ] army . 
The [LOC Kremlin  ] strategy appears to be to check [PER Kadyrov  ] by promoting warlords he cannot control , and to check the FSB from becoming too clientized by allowing the MOD to retain a sphere of influence . 
In [LOC Chechnya  ] , that is a recipe for open fighting . 
We saw one small instance of that on April 25 , when bodyguards of [PER Kadyrov  ] and [MISC Chechen  ] President [PER Alkhanov  ] got into a firefight . 
According to one insider , the clash originated in [MISC Kadyrov’s  ] desire to get rid of [PER Alkhanov  ] , who now has close ties with [PER Yamadayev  ] . 
What Can We Expect in the Future ? --------------------------------- <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
( C ) The [MISC Chechen  ] population is the great loser in this game . 
It bears an ever heavier burden in shake-downs , opportunity costs from misappropriation of reconstruction funds , and the constant trauma of victimization and abuse -- including abduction , torture , and murder -- by the armed thugs who run [LOC Chechnya  ] ( reftels ) . 
Security under those circumstances is a fragile veneer , and stability an illusion . 
The insurgency can continue indefinitely , at a low level and without prospects of success , but significant enough to serve as a pretext for the continued rule of thuggery. <a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38 . 
( C ) The insurgency will remain split between those who want to carry on Maskhadov’s non-Salafist struggle for national independence and those who follow the Salafi-influenced [PER Basayev  ] in his pursuit of a [PER Caucasus-wide Caliphate  ] . 
But the nationalists have been undercut by [PER Kadyrov  ] . 
Despite [MISC Sadullayev’s  ] efforts , the insurgency inside [LOC Chechnya  ] is not likely to meet with success and will continue to become more Salafist in tone. <a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39 . 
( C ) Prospects would be poor for the nationalists even if [PER Kadyrov  ] and/or [PER Yamadayev  ] were assassinated ( and there is much speculation that one will succeed in killing the other , goaded on by the FSB which supports [PER Kadyrov  ] and the [ORG GRU  ] which supports [PER Yamadayev  ] ) . 
The thousands of guerrillas who have joined those two militias have by now lost all ideological incentive . 
Since they already run the country , they feel themselves , not the [MISC Russians  ] , to be the masters , and are not responsive to [MISC Sadullayev’s  ] nationalist calls ; Basayev’s Salafist message has even less appeal to them . 
Even if their current leaders are eliminated , all they will need is a new warlord , easily generated from within their organizations , and they can continue on their current paths. <a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40 . 
( C ) We expect that Salafism will continue to grow . 
The insurgents even inside [LOC Chechnya  ] are reportedly becoming predominantly Salafist , as opposition on a narrowly nationalist basis offers less hope of success . 
Salafis will come both from inside [LOC Chechnya  ] , where militia excesses outrage the population , and from elsewhere in the [LOC Caucasus  ] , where radicalization is proceeding rapidly as a result of the repressive policies of [LOC Russia’s  ] regional satraps . 
There are numerous eyewitness accounts from both [LOC Dagestan  ] and [LOC Kabardino-Balkaria  ] that elite young adults and university students are joining Salafist groups . 
In one case , a terrorist killed in [LOC Dagestan  ] was found recently to have defended his doctoral dissertation at [ORG Moscow State University  ] -- on [MISC Wahhabism  ] in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
These young adults , denied economic opportunities , turn to religion as an outlet . 
They find , however , that representatives of the traditional religious establishments in these republics , long isolated under the thumb of [MISC Soviet  ] restrictions , are ill-educated and ill-prepared to deal with the sophisticated theological arguments developed by generations of Salafists in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Most of those who join fundamentalist jamaats do not , of course , become terrorists . 
But a percentage do , and with that steady source of recruits the major battlefield could shift to outside [LOC Chechnya  ] , with armed clashes in other parts of the [LOC North Caucasus  ] and a continuation of sporadic but spectacular terrorist acts in [LOC Moscow  ] and other parts of [LOC Russia.  ] <a id='par41' href='#par41'>¶</a>41 . 
( C ) Outside [LOC Chechnya  ] , the most likely venue for clashes with authorities is [LOC Dagestan  ] . 
Putin’s imposition of a “power vertical” there has upset the delicate clan and ethnic balance that offered a shaky stability since the collapse of [MISC Soviet  ] power . 
He installed a president ( the weak [PER Mukhu Aliyev  ] ) in place of a 14-member multi-ethnic presidential council . 
[PER Aliyev  ] will be unable to prevent a ruthless struggle among the elite -- the local way of elaborating a new balance of power . 
This is already happening , with assassinations of provincial chiefs since [PER Aliyev  ] took over . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 008 OF 010 In one province in the south of the republic , an uprising against the chief appointed by Aliyev’s predecessor was suppressed by gunfire . 
Four demonstrators were shot dead , initiating a cycle of blood revenge . 
In May , in two [MISC Dagestani  ] cities security force operations against “terrorists” resulted in major shootouts , with victims among the bystanders and whole apartment houses rendered uninhabitable after hits from the security forces’ heavy weaponry . 
It is not clear whether the “terrorists” were really religious activists ( “Whenever they want to eliminate someone , they call him a [MISC Wahhabi  ] , ” the MP from [LOC Makhachkala  ] told us ) . 
But the populace , seeing the deadly over-reaction of the security forces , is feeling sympathy for their victims -- so much so that [PER Aliyev  ] has had to make public condemnations of the actions of the security forces . 
If this chaos deepens , as appears likely , the Jihadist groups ( “jamaats” ) may grow , drift further in Basayev’s direction , and feel the need to respond to attacks from the local government. <a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42 . 
( C ) Local forces are unreliable in such cases , for clan and blood-feud reasons . 
Wahhabist jamaats flourished in the strategic ethnically [MISC Dargin  ] districts of [LOC Karamakhi  ] and [LOC Chabanmakhi  ] in the mid-1990s , but [MISC Dagestan’s  ] rulers left them alone because moving against them meant altering the delicate ethnic balance between [MISC Dargins  ] and Avars . 
Only when the jamaats themselves became expansive during the [MISC Basayev/Khattab  ] invasion from [LOC Chechnya  ] in the summer of 1999 did the [LOC Makhachkala  ] authorities take action , and then only with the assistance of Federal forces . 
Ultimately , if clashes break out on a wide scale in [LOC Dagestan  ] , [LOC Moscow  ] would have to send in the Federal army . 
Deploying the army to combat destabilization in [LOC Dagestan  ] , however , could jeopardize Putin’s hard-won control over it . 
Unleashing the army against a “terrorist” threat is just that: allowing the army off its new leash . 
Large-scale army deployments to [LOC Dagestan  ] would be especially attractive to the officers , since the border with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] offers lucrative opportunities for contraband trade . 
The army’s presence , in turn , would further destabilize [LOC Dagestan  ] and all but guarantee chaos. <a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43 . 
( C ) Indeed , destabilization is the most likely prospect we see when we look further down the road to the next decade . 
Chechenization allows bellicose [MISC Chechen  ] leaders to throw their weight around in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] even more than an independent [LOC Chechnya  ] would . 
A case in point is the call on April 24 by [ORG Chechen Parliament  ] Speaker [PER Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov  ] for unification of [LOC Chechnya  ] , [LOC Ingushetia  ] and [LOC Dagestan  ] , implicitly under [MISC Chechen  ] domination ( the one million [MISC Chechens  ] would constitute a plurality in the new republic of 4.5 million ) . 
The call soured slowly normalizing relations between [LOC Chechnya  ] and [LOC Ingushetia  ] , according to a [MISC Chechen  ] official in [LOC Moscow  ] , though the [MISC Dagestanis  ] treated the proposal as a joke . 
What Should [PER Putin  ] Be Doing ? --------------------------- <a id='par44' href='#par44'>¶</a>44 . 
( C ) Right now Putin’s policy towards [LOC Chechnya  ] is channeled through [PER Kadyrov  ] and [PER Yamadayev  ] . 
Putin’s Plenipotentiary Representative ( PolPred ) for the [ORG Southern Federal District  ] , [PER Dmitriy Kozak  ] , appears to have little influence . 
He was not even invited when [PER Putin  ] addressed the new [ORG Parliament  ] in [LOC Groznyy  ] last December . 
[PER Putin  ] needs to stop taking [PER Kadyrov’s  ] phone calls and start working more through his PolPred and the government’s special services . 
He also needs to increase Moscow’s civilian engagement with [ORG Chechnya.  ] <a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45 . 
( C ) [PER Putin  ] should continue to reform the military and the other [ORG Power Ministries  ] . 
Having asserted control through [PER Sergey Ivanov  ] , [PER Putin  ] has denied the military certain limited areas in which it had pursued criminal activity -- but left most of its criminal enterprises untouched . 
He has done little if anything to form the discipline of a modern army deployable to impose order in unstable regions such as the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
Recent hazing incidents show that discipline is still equated with sadism and brutality . 
The [ORG Ministry of Internal Affairs  ] ( [ORG MVD  ] ) has undergone even less reform . 
The Chechenization of the security services , despite its obvious drawbacks , has shown that locals can carry out security tasks more effectively than [MISC Russian  ] troops. <a id='par46' href='#par46'>¶</a>46 . 
( C ) Lastly , [PER Putin  ] should realize that his current policy course is not preventing the growth of militant , armed [MISC Jihadism  ] . 
Rather , every time his subordinates try to douse the flames , the fire grows hotter and spreads farther . 
[PER Putin  ] needs to check the firehose ; he may find they are spraying the fire with gasoline . 
He needs to work out a credible strategy , employing economic and cultural levers , to deal with the issue of armed [MISC Jihadism  ] . 
Some [MISC Russians  ] do “get it.” An advisor to [PER Kozak  ] gave a lecture recently that showed he understands in great detail the issues surrounding the growth [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 009 OF 010 of militant jihadism . 
[PER Kozak  ] himself made clear in a recent conversation with the Ambassador that he appreciates clearly the deep social and economic roots of [MISC Russia’s  ] problems in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] -- and the need to employ more than just security measures to solve them . 
We have not , however , seen evidence that consciousness of the true problem has yet made its way to [LOC Moscow  ] from [LOC Kozak’s  ] office in [LOC Rostov-on-Don.  ] <a id='par47' href='#par47'>¶</a>47 . 
( C ) We need also to be aware that Putin’s strategy is generating a backlash in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Ramzan Kadyrov’s  ] excesses , his Putin-given immunity from federal influence , and the special laws that apply to [LOC Chechnya  ] alone ( such as the exemption of [MISC Chechens  ] from military service elsewhere in [LOC Russia  ] ) are leading to charges by some [LOC Moscow  ] observers that [PER Putin  ] has allowed [LOC Chechnya  ] de facto to secede . 
[PER Putin  ] is strong enough to weather such criticism , but the ability of a successor to do so is less clear . 
Is There a Role for the [LOC U.S.  ] ? ----------------------------- <a id='par48' href='#par48'>¶</a>48 . 
( C ) [LOC Russia  ] does not consider the [LOC U.S.  ] a friend in the [LOC Caucasus  ] , and our capacity to influence [LOC Russia  ] , whether by pressure , persuasion or assistance , is small . 
What we can do is continue to try to push the senior tier of [MISC Russian  ] officials towards the realization that current policies are conducive to [MISC Jihadism  ] , which threatens broader stability as well ; and that shifting the responsibility for victimizing and looting the people from a corrupt , brutal military to corrupt , brutal locals is not a long-term solution. <a id='par49' href='#par49'>¶</a>49 . 
( C ) Making headway with [PER Putin  ] or his successor will require close cooperation with our [MISC European  ] allies . 
They , like the [MISC Russians  ] , tend to view the issue through a strictly counter-terrorism lens . 
The [MISC British  ] , for example , link their “dialogue with [MISC Islam”  ] closely with their counter-terrorist effort ( on which they liaise with the [MISC Russians  ] ) , reinforcing the conception of a monolithic [MISC Muslim  ] identity predisposed to terrorism . 
That reinforces the [MISC Russian  ] view that the problem of the [LOC North Caucasus  ] can be consigned to the terrorism basket , and that finding a solution means in the first instance finding a better way to kill terrorists. <a id='par50' href='#par50'>¶</a>50 . 
( C ) We and the [MISC Europeans  ] need to put our proposals of assistance to the [LOC North Caucasus  ] in a different context: one that recognizes the role of religion in [LOC North Caucasus  ] cultures , but also emphasizes our interest in and support for the non-religious aspects of [LOC North Caucasus  ] society , including civil society . 
This last will need exceptional delicacy , as the [MISC Russians  ] and the local authorities are convinced that the [LOC U.S.  ] uses civil society to foment “color revolutions” and anti-Russian regimes . 
There is a danger that our civil society partners could become what [ORG Churchill  ] called “the inopportune missionary” who , despite impeccable intentions , sets back the larger effort . 
That need not be the case. <a id='par51' href='#par51'>¶</a>51 . 
( C ) Our interests call for an understanding of the context and a positive emphasis . 
We cannot expect the [MISC Russians  ] to react well if we limit our statements to condemnations of [PER Kadyrov  ] , butcher though he may be . 
We need to find targeted areas in which we can work with the [MISC Russians  ] to get effective aid into [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
At the same time , we need to be on our guard that our efforts do not appear to constitute [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Kremlin  ] or local policies that abuse human rights . 
We must also avoid a shift that endorses the [LOC Kremlin  ] assertion that there is no longer a humanitarian crisis in [LOC Chechnya  ] , which goes hand-in-hand with the [MISC Russian  ] request that the [ORG UN  ] and its donors end humanitarian assistance to the region and increase technical and “recovery” assistance . 
We and other donors need to maintain a balance between humanitarian and recovery assistance. <a id='par52' href='#par52'>¶</a>52 . 
( C ) Aside from the political optic , a rush to cut humanitarian assistance before recovery programs are fully up and running would leave a vacuum into which jihadist influences would leap . 
The [ORG European Commission Humanitarian Organization  ] , the largest provider of aid , shows signs of rushing to stress recovery over humanitarian assistance ; we should not follow suit . 
Humanitarian assistance has been effective in relieving the plight of [MISC Chechen  ] IDPs in [LOC Ingushetia  ] . 
It has been less effective inside [LOC Chechnya  ] , where the [ORG GOR  ] and [PER Kadyrov  ] regime built temporary accommodation centers for returning IDPs , but have not passed on enough resources to secure a reasonable standard of living . 
International organizations are hampered by limited access to [LOC Chechnya  ] out of security concerns , but where they are able to operate freely they have made a great difference , e.g. , WHO’s immunization program. <a id='par53' href='#par53'>¶</a>53 . 
( C ) Resources aimed at [LOC Chechnya  ] often wind up in private pockets . 
Though international assistance has a better record [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005645 010 OF 010 than [MISC Russian  ] assistance and is more closely monitored , we must also be wary of assistance that lends itself to massive corruption and state-sponsored banditry in [LOC Chechnya:  ] too much of the money loaned in a microfinance program there , for example , would be expropriated by militias . 
[ORG Presidential Advisor Aslakhanov  ] told us last December that [PER Kadyrov  ] expropriates for himself one third off the top of all assistance . 
Therefore , while we continue well-monitored humanitarian assistance inside [LOC Chechnya  ] , we should broaden our efforts for “recovery” to other parts of the region that are threatened by jihadism: [LOC Dagestan  ] , [LOC Kabardino-Balkaria  ] , [LOC Ingushetia  ] , and possibly [LOC Karachayevo-Cherkessia  ] . 
Among these , we need to try to steer our assistance ( $11.5 million for FY 2006 ) to regional officials , such as President [PER Kanokov  ] of [LOC Kabardino-Balkaria  ] , who have shown that they are willing to introduce local reforms and get rid of the brutal security officials whose repressive acts feed the Jihadist movement. <a id='par54' href='#par54'>¶</a>54 . 
( C ) We also need to coordinate closely with [PER Kozak  ] ( or his successor ) , both to strengthen his position vis--vis the warlords and to ensure that everything we do is perceived by the [MISC Russians  ] as transparent and not aimed at challenging the [MISC GOR’s  ] hold on a troubled region . 
The present opposite perception by the [ORG GOR  ] may be behind its reluctance to cooperate with donors , the [ORG UN  ] and IFIs on long-term strategic engagement in the region . 
For example , the [ORG GOR  ] has delayed for months a 20-million-Euro TACIS program designed with [ORG GOR  ] input. <a id='par55' href='#par55'>¶</a>55 . 
( C ) The interagency paper “U.S . 
Policy in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] -- The [ORG Way Forward”  ] provides a number of important principles for positive engagement . 
We need to emphasize programs in accordance with those principles which are most practical under current and likely future conditions , and which can be most effective in targeting the most vulnerable , where federal and local governments lack the will and capacity to assist , and in combating the spread of jihadism both inside [LOC Chechnya  ] and throughout the [LOC North Caucasus  ] region . 
There are areas -- for example , health care and child welfare -- in which assistance fits neatly with [MISC Russian  ] priorities , containing both humanitarian and recovery components. <a id='par56' href='#par56'>¶</a>56 . 
( C ) We can also emphasize programs that help create jobs and job opportunities: microfinance ( where feasible ) , credit cooperatives and small business development , and educational exchanges . 
[LOC U.S.  ] sponsored training programs for credit cooperatives and government budgeting functions have been very popular . 
Exchanges , through the [ORG IVP  ] program and [MISC Community Connections  ] , are an especially effective way of exposing future leaders to the world beyond the narrow propaganda they have received , and to generate a multiplier effect in enterprise . 
In addition to the effects the programs themselves can have in providing alternatives to religious extremism , such assistance can also have a demonstration effect: showing the [MISC Russians  ] that improved governance and delivery of services can be more effective in stabilizing the region than attempts to impose order by force. <a id='par57' href='#par57'>¶</a>57 . 
( C ) Lastly , we need to look ahead in our relations with [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] to ensure that they become more active and effective players in helping to contain instability in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] . 
That will serve their own security interests as well . 
Salafis need connections to their worldwide network . 
Strengthening border forces is more important than ever . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] , especially , is well placed to trade with [LOC Dagestan  ] and [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
The ethnic [MISC Azeris  ] , Lezghis and [MISC Avars  ] living on both sides of the [MISC Azerbaijan-Dagestan  ] border and friendly relations between [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] are tools for promoting stability . 
Conclusion -------- <a id='par58' href='#par58'>¶</a>58 . 
( C ) The situation in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] is trending towards destabilization , despite the increase in security inside [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
The steps we believe [PER Putin  ] must take are those needed to reverse that trend , and the efforts we have outlined for ourselves are premised on a desire to promote a lasting stabilization built on improved governance , a more active civil society , and steps towards democratization . 
But we must be realistic about [MISC Russia’s  ] willingness and ability to take the necessary steps , with or without our assistance . 
Real stabilization remains a low probability . 
Sound policy on [LOC Chechnya  ] is likely to continue to founder in the swamp of corruption , [LOC Kremlin  ] infighting and succession politics . 
Much more probable is a new phase of instability that will be felt throughout the [LOC North Caucasus  ] and have effects beyond .
