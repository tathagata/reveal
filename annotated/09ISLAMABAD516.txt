[ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 506 [PER B. ISLAMABAD  ] 508 Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
In a last-ditch effort to reduce tensions with the [PER Sharif  ] brothers ahead of the start of the lawyers’ march on March 12 , President [PER Zardari  ] offered [ORG Pakistan Muslim League  ] ( [ORG PML  ] ) leader [PER Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain  ] the post of [ORG Senate  ] leader if [ORG PML  ] would form a government with the [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) in [LOC Punjab  ] but will do little to pacify [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] or the lawyers . 
[ORG Shujaat  ] is considering the deal , which will be sealed by the March 12 vote in the [ORG Senate  ] ; it could end governor’s rule in Punjab--if [ORG Shujaat  ] can keep the [ORG PML  ] forward block in line . 
Other compromise efforts have failed , although the [ORG UK High Commission  ] is probing for the various parties’ positions in advance of a possible HMG mediation effort . 
After seeing Interior Minister [PER Malik  ] and [ORG Awami National Party  ] leader [PER Asfundyar Wali Khan  ] , Ambassador will see [ORG Shujaat  ] March 11 and the [PER Sharifs  ] on March 12. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Amid reports of possible targeted killings and [LOC Mumbai  ] style attacks during the march , the [MISC GOP  ] began arresting [ORG Pakistan Muslim League-N  ] ( [MISC PML-N  ] ) and [ORG Jamaat-e-Islami  ] ( [ORG JI  ] ) members and some civil activists . 
Interior Minister [PER Malik  ] assured Ambassador he had no plans to arrest the [PER Sharifs  ] or key civil society leaders like [PER Aitzaz Ahsan  ] , but caveated this by saying he might have to arrest [PER Imran Khan  ] or others “who did not obey the law.” Lawyers and [ORG JI  ] activists already have begun infiltrating [LOC Islamabad  ] ; if a significant number of demonstrators cannot enter the capital , we expect protests in multiple areas , especially in [LOC Punjab  ] , beginning March 12 . 
Accordingly , we are issuing a Warden Notice March 11. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During Ambassador’s fourth meeting in a week with Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] ( [ORG COAS  ] ) General [PER Kayani  ] on March 10 , he again hinted that he might , however reluctantly , have to persuade President [PER Zardari  ] to resign if the situation sharply deteriorates . 
He mentioned [PER Asfundyar Wali Khan  ] as a possible replacement . 
This would not be a formal coup but would leave in place the [ORG PPP  ] government led by PM [PER Gilani  ] , thus avoiding elections that likely would bring [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] to power . 
We do not believe [ORG Army  ] action is imminent . 
We do believe [PER Kayani  ] was laying down a clear marker so that , if he has to act , he can say he warned the [LOC U.S.  ] in advance and gave us ample opportunities to pressure both sides to back down . 
[PER Kayani  ] is trying to leverage what he considers predominate [LOC U.S.  ] influence over [PER Zardari  ] , instead of seeking a direct confrontation that could provoke an unhelpful civil-military clash. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Two weeks ago , [PER Zardari  ] was staring at victory on all fronts ; today , he recognizes he must compromise with the [PER Sharifs  ] and might well be looking over his shoulder at the [ORG Army  ] . 
Even if the lawyers’ march fizzles--and it may--Nawaz retains the high moral ground in public opinion and can continue attacking a now weakened [PER Zardari  ] . 
We should encourage [PER Zardari  ] to continue efforts to ease tensions and ask the [MISC Saudis  ] and the UAE to weigh in with their respective allies . 
This could be a protracted process . 
End Summary . 
Mediation/Confrontation/Collapse -------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There are three political scenarios in play as tensions between President [PER Zardari  ] and the [PER Sharif  ] brothers rise ahead of the start of the lawyers’ march on March 12: mediation/accommodation , which resolves the Sharifs’ disqualification from holding public office , ends governor’s rule in [LOC Punjab  ] and addresses the judicial issue ; confrontation , which leads to violence and possible [ORG Army  ] intervention ; and a fizzled march that sets the stage for continued conflict . 
Mediation/Accommodation ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On March 11 , [ORG Awami National Party  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) leader [PER Asfundyar Wali Khan  ] described to Ambassador and [MISC Polcouns  ] his [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000516 002 OF 004 mediation efforts with [MISC Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam  ] leader [PER Fazlur Rehman  ] over the past week . 
[PER Zardari  ] , he asserted , agreed to request a review of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision disqualifying the [PER Sharifs  ] , said that after a positive outcome to that review [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] would be reinstated as Chief Minister [LOC Punjab  ] , and agreed to a conference to discuss restoring the judiciary . 
In return , [PER Nawaz  ] should delay the lawyers’ march. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Nawaz  ] reportedly agreed but then changed his mind and demanded reversal of the court decision , an end to governor’s rule in [LOC Punjab  ] and reinstatement of the former Chief Justice . 
Under pressure , [PER Nawaz  ] relented and agreed to the judicial conference idea but offered only to ask the lawyers to consider postponing the march , and said all this had to be accomplished in a day . 
[PER Asfundyar  ] noted that it was impossible to demand a immediate review of a Court decision that had not been formally issued . 
He told [PER Nawaz  ] that he would win the next election and should just be patient ; by pressing now , he threatened a political vacuum that would be filled by the [ORG Army  ] . 
This time , warned [PER Asfundyar  ] , [PER Nawaz  ] might not be sent into a comfortable exile . 
[PER Nawaz  ] refused to budge. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Asfundyar  ] said that [PER Zardari  ] was surrounded by advisors who were not politicians , so he was not being encouraged to compromise ; Nawaz’s chief advisor was [PER Chaudhry Nisar  ] who , with the [PER Sharif  ] brothers disqualified , stood the best chance of being the next [MISC PML-N  ] Prime Minister . 
[PER Nawaz  ] had provoked the Court by launching a campaign over the doctored exam scores of the Chief Justice’s daughter , and this had prompted the ruling against [PER Shahbaz  ] . 
[PER Asfundyar  ] attributed the crisis 70 percent to [PER Nawaz  ] and 30 percent to [PER Zardari  ] . 
In [LOC Asfundyar’s  ] view , there was an absence of trust on both sides , and what was needed was a cease-fire in which to conduct reasonable negotiations . 
If the march fizzled , there could be time to work out a compromise ; if the march sparked violence , there was “nothing to do but pray.” <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Asfundyar  ] welcomed the idea of [LOC UK  ] mediation but said it was the [LOC U.S.  ] view that counted most . 
He also urged that we contact the UAE to pressure [PER Zardari  ] and the [MISC Saudis  ] to pressure [PER Nawaz  ] to back off . 
[ORG ANP  ] had seen [MISC PML-N  ] members distributing cash envelopes to a stream of supporters this week ; like [PER Zardari  ] , [PER Asfundyar  ] said he believed the money was coming from the [MISC Saudis  ] . 
[PER Asfundyar  ] was open to continue mediating if asked . 
He reminded Ambassador that [PER Zardari  ] had offered him the job of Prime Minister immediately after the February 2008 elections. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In a separate meeting with Ambassador and [MISC Polcouns  ] , [LOC UK  ] High Commissioner [PER Brinkley  ] said he had received approval to approach the various sides , discern their bottom lines , and report back to [LOC London  ] . 
HMG had not yet decided whether to take on any role of mediator or guarantor . 
The [LOC UK  ] planned to make a public statement today urging the parties to resolve their differences democratically and eschew violence . 
[PER Brinkley  ] was scheduled to see PM [PER Gilani  ] and possibly [PER Zardari  ] and [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] on March 11 , and Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] General [PER Kayani  ] and [PER Asfundyar Wali Khan  ] on March 12. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Late on March 11 , the [ORG PML  ] confirmed press reports that the [ORG PPP  ] had reversed course ( Ref B ) and now had offered [PER Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain  ] the post of leader of the [ORG Senate  ] if [ORG PML  ] agreed to join [ORG PPP  ] in a coalition government in [LOC Punjab  ] . 
[PER Shujaat  ] will meet PM [PER Gilani  ] later March 11 ; on March 12 , the newly constituted [ORG Senate  ] would vote on a party leader . 
If the deal goes through , it would end governor’s rule in [LOC Punjab  ] but it is unclear if a [MISC PPP-led  ] government will reduce tensions . 
It remains unclear , however , if [PER Shujaat  ] can hold on to his 28-35 member “forward block” of [PER Nawaz  ] supporters to seal this deal . 
Without the [ORG PML  ] forward block , the [ORG PPP  ] cannot form a government . 
Confrontation ------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In a March 11 meeting with Ambassador and [MISC Polcouns  ] , Interior Minister [PER Malik  ] described his efforts to mediate with the lawyers to convince them to hold a peaceful march outside of [LOC Islamabad  ] , but he said the lawyers so far have spurned the [MISC GOP’s  ] proposals . 
[PER Malik  ] plans to block roads into [LOC Islamabad  ] [ORG ISLAMABAD  ] 00000516 003 OF 004 beginning March 13 . 
Ambassador warned that efforts to arrest the [PER Sharifs  ] or high-profile activists like [PER Aitzaz Ahsan  ] would not be well received in [LOC Washington  ] or elsewhere . 
[PER Malik  ] denied he had any intention of arresting the [PER Sharifs  ] or [PER Aitzaz  ] but qualified this by saying “unless they do not stop , but I will tell you first . 
I have to maintain law and order.” He said he might have to arrest [PER Imran Khan  ] and some [ORG JI  ] activists . 
( Note: On March 10 , [LOC Punjab  ] police began arresting 200-250 [ORG JI  ] student activists and low-level [MISC PML-N  ] workers . 
Mission contacts report many activists already are going underground . 
Neither the [PER Sharifs  ] nor [PER Aitzaz Ahsan  ] have been arrested . 
[ORG Geo TV News  ] , which the [MISC GOP  ] has criticized for being anti-government , disappeared from cable [ORG TV  ] . 
See septel for updates . 
) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Malik  ] said he had received serious threat information regarding a [LOC Mumbai  ] style attack in [LOC Karachi  ] on March 13-14 by the [MISC Jandallah  ] group that previously had attacked the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate . 
There were also reports of a proposed targeted killing , against whom was unclear . 
[ORG JI  ] leaders were giving their students “black coats” so they could look like lawyers and already were infiltrating [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
[PER Malik  ] expected crowds of at least 4,000-5,000 in the capital , even with road closures. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) In four conversations with Ambassador this week , Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] ( [ORG COAS  ] ) General [PER Kayani  ] hinted that , however reluctantly , he might have to urge [PER Zardari  ] to resign , if conditions deteriorate . 
He did not offer any red lines . 
[PER Kayani  ] indicated that [PER Asfundyar Wali Khan  ] or someone else broadly acceptable might be an appropriate replacement for [PER Zardari  ] . 
We do not believe [ORG Army  ] action is imminent , but we do believe [PER Kayani  ] was laying down a marker that , if he had to intervene , the [LOC U.S.  ] had been forewarned and given many opportunities to avoid intervention by pressuring both [PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Zardari  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] made it clear that regardless of how much he disliked [PER Zardari  ] , he distrusted [PER Nawaz  ] even more . 
The scenario [PER Kayani  ] hinted at was one in which he would pressure [PER Zardari  ] to resign ( and presumably leave the country ) . 
This would not be an official [ORG Army  ] “coup ; ” it would leave the [ORG PPP  ] government led by Prime Minister [PER Gilani  ] in place and preclude the need for elections that likely would bring [PER Nawaz  ] to power. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) [PER Kayani  ] hinted at disquiet among his corps commanders who believe [PER Zardari  ] is corrupt and has not been paying enough attention to [MISC Pakistan’s  ] economic and security challenges . 
ISI DG Pasha highlighted to Ambassador his concerns about [MISC Zardari’s  ] alleged corruption on the flight to the [LOC U.S.  ] for the strategic review , and we have multiple sources demonstrating [ORG Army  ] complaints about [PER Zardari  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] believes the [LOC U.S.  ] has the most influence over [PER Zardari  ] , and he knows we are [MISC Pakistan’s  ] most important ally , especially for increasing the capacity of the [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Army  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] told Ambassador he has talked directly to [PER Zardari  ] , but he does not appear to have conveyed the seriousness of [ORG Army  ] concerns about [PER Zardari  ] or the security situation vis a vis the march . 
( Note: [PER Kayani  ] may be seeking to avoid a confrontation that would prompt [PER Zardari  ] to make a disastrous decision to try and oust the [ORG COAS  ] . 
) A Fizzle -------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) At this point , everything appears to rest on the outcome of the lawyers’ march . 
[MISC PML-N  ] does not have a proven reputation for putting demonstrators on the streets , although [ORG JI  ] does . 
By applying the road closure/detention tactics that worked for [PER Musharraf  ] in 2007 to stop pro-Nawaz demonstrations , the government might be able to avoid a serious clash this time . 
But if a policeman fires into the crowd or a terrorist attacks protesters , all bets are off. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) There is also the likelihood that the march will not occur as scheduled . 
Blocked from [LOC Islamabad  ] , there could be multiple flash points in the [LOC Punjab  ] , early demonstrations in [LOC Islamabad  ] , and a series of confrontations with the police . 
This could be a protracted clash of wills. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Comment: Two weeks ago , [PER Zardari  ] was staring victory in the face after negotiating a [ORG PPP  ] win in [ORG Senate  ] elections , setting [PER Nawaz  ] up for an entirely legal [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000516 004 OF 004 disqualification , and looking toward successful Friends and Donors meetings that would provide the financial support needed to bolster his sagging popularity . 
By over-reaching to make a grab for [LOC Punjab  ] without doing his homework on vote counting in [LOC Punjab  ] , [PER Zardari  ] now needs to compromise with the [PER Sharifs  ] and might well be looking over his shoulder at the [ORG Army  ] . 
Even if the march fizzles , [PER Nawaz  ] retains the high moral ground in the public’s eyes and will use it to continue attacking a weakened [PER Zardari  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] needs to win back the military’s confidence .
