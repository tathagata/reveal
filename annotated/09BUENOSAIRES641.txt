Anthony Wayne  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary and introduction: [MISC Argentine  ] FM [PER Jorge Taiana  ] told the Ambassador , during the latter’s May 28 farewell call , that the [ORG GOA  ] had no intention of following [ORG Venezuela’s  ] lead on expropriations . 
[PER Taiana  ] expressed concern about the visit of a team from the [ORG FAA  ] and the prospect ( which has since receded ) of a downgrade in the rating of [LOC Argentina’s  ] civil aviation regime . 
The Ambassador updated [PER Taiana  ] on MOD efforts to find new office space for the [ORG U.S. Military Group  ] . 
[PER Taiana  ] ( protect ) said he knows that [LOC Argentina  ] , in a recent submission regarding its Antarctic claim , left out the language that was agreed with the [ORG USG  ] and other key governments in 2004 ( ref C ) , but claimed the current electoral climate in [LOC Argentina  ] had made it impossible to submit such specific language due to the [LOC Malvinas/Falklands  ] issue’s continued prominence here . 
The Ambassador complained to [PER Taiana  ] that an [MISC Argentine  ] judicial investigation was inadvertently holding up the re-exportation of cars belonging to [MISC American  ] diplomats . 
The Ambassador urged resolution of [ORG Paris Club  ] and private bondholder debts . 
Ref B reports discussion of [LOC Cuba  ] issue at the [ORG OAS General Assembly  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez  ] ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador indirectly asked if the the [MISC Argentine  ] business community’s alarm regarding the latest wave of [MISC Venezuelan  ] expropriations ( including several affecting [MISC Argentina’s Techint  ] conglomerate ) was giving the [ORG GOA  ] pause about [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Taiana  ] stressed that no one senior in the [ORG GOA  ] -- neither [MISC CFK  ] , other ministers or [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] -- wanted to follow [MISC Chavez’s  ] lead on expropriations . 
[PER Taiana  ] said [PER Peron  ] had already gone through a nationalization phase in the 1940s , and the country had learned its lesson . 
[LOC Argentina  ] may favor a larger state role in the economy than does the [LOC United States  ] , but it still values the private sector and recognizes the primacy of private property for propelling economic growth and development . 
The [ORG GOA  ] does not agree with what [PER Chavez  ] was doing , [PER Taiana  ] reiterated . 
( Comment: These comments tracked with Interior Minister Randazzo’s public comments on the week of May 25 that [MISC Chavez’s  ] expropriations were “pre-Peronist . 
End comment . 
) Civair ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Taiana  ] said he was concerned about the visit of a team from the [ORG FAA  ] and the possibility of a downgrade in [ORG Argentina’s International Aviation Safety Assessment  ] ( [ORG IASA  ] ) . 
He noted that the transition from military to civilian control of air traffic had been wrenching , with the military trying to hold on to power . 
He said he hoped the [ORG FAA  ] assessment did not blow up publicly into a divisive issue . 
The Ambassador noted that none of the FAA’s recommendations was difficult or unfeasible . 
( NOTE: An [ORG FAA  ] team was in [LOC Argentina  ] May 27-29 , completing the [ORG IASA  ] evaluation begun in March , 2009 . 
While official results have yet to be released , an informal readout from the team leader indicates that [LOC Argentina  ] will maintain its [ORG IASA  ] Category I status . 
The [ORG FAA  ] provided similar information to [ORG GoA  ] civil aviation authorities . 
) [ORG Military Group  ] -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Taiana  ] asked if the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] had offered the [ORG U.S. Military Group  ] alternate office space ( per ref A discussion ) . 
The Ambassador acknowledged the MOD had made an offer , and that one [ORG Military Group  ] component located at MOD headquarters had moved out of that building to the Embassy . 
The Ambassador explained that two other [ORG Military Group  ] components currently located at [ORG Air Force  ] and [ORG Navy  ] facilities were hoping for a temporary reprieve pending a fuller discussion of updating the 1964 agreement at joint [MISC U.S.-Argentine  ] talks in October . 
[PER Taiana  ] asked to be kept informed of developments . 
[MISC Antarctic  ] --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Taiana  ] ( protect ) said he knows that [LOC Argentina  ] , in the data it submitted to the [ORG UN Commission  ] on the Limits of the [ORG Continental Shelf  ] regarding its Antarctic claim , left out the specific language that was agreed with the [ORG USG  ] and other key governments in 2004 ( ref C ) . 
He claimed that the current electoral climate in [LOC Argentina  ] had made it impossible to submit such language with the [ORG GOA  ] data . 
Doing so would have subjected the [ORG GOA  ] to a storm of criticism for its “surrender” of [MISC Argentine  ] claims , and resulted in his removal from office. “But if you read our submission carefully , you’ll see our language respects all Antarctic [ORG Treaty  ] provisions , ” he said , quickly adding that the prime issue for [LOC Argentina  ] , of course , was not [LOC Antarctica  ] , but protecting its claim to sovereignty over the [LOC Malvinas/Falkland Islands  ] . 
POVs ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador explained to [PER Taiana  ] that an [MISC Argentine  ] judge investigating abuse by others of diplomatic importation of vehicles had seized documents , effectively holding up the export of privately owned vehicles ( POVs ) belonging to [MISC American  ] diplomats who had served in [LOC Argentina  ] and are now posted elsewhere . 
The Ambassador said [LOC Washington  ] was very concerned and looking into reciprocity measures . 
[PER Taiana  ] said he was not aware of this latest development and would look into it . 
( The Ambassador subsequently signed a letter to the investigating judge , to be transmitted through the [ORG MFA  ] , which explains our serious concerns and seeks positive action . 
) [ORG Paris Club  ] ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The Ambassador told [PER Taiana  ] that he had advised President [PER Kirchner  ] the night before ( ref B ) that resolution of [ORG Paris Club  ] and private bondholder debts is clearly in [LOC Argentina’s  ] long-term interest . 
[PER Taiana  ] agreed the [ORG GOA  ] needed to find a way to resolve the matter , and the Ambassador noted that Planning Minister [PER De Vido  ] and others in the [ORG GOA  ] seemed to be moving toward that position as well .
