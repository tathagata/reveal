DANILOVICH  ] . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Ambassador formally presented his credentials to President [PER Lula da Silva  ] in a ceremony at the [LOC Planalto Palace  ] in the afternoon of 2 September 2004 . 
As per [MISC Brazilian  ] protocol custom , Ambassador was one of three chiefs of mission presenting credentials to the president ( the [MISC Venezuelan  ] ambassador proceeded and the [MISC Hungarian  ] came after ) , with each ambassador meeting with the president separately and then , in turn , inspecting troops and hearing national anthems on the ramp of the palace 's main entrance. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) On receiving Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] and a delegation of senior mission officers , [PER Lula  ] welcomed the Ambassador to [LOC Brazil  ] and launched immediately into a friendly question and answer session on the status of the [LOC U.S.  ] presidential campaign . 
Ambassador explained the historical function of the conventions , noting that in modern times they have become pro forma " coronations , " but in the past they were actual venues for candidate selection . 
[PER Lula  ] mused that [LOC Brazil  ] 's party conventions are also pro forma , but last a maximum of a single day . 
[PER Lula  ] then asked which states would be decisive in terms of votes . 
Ambassador discussed the battlefield states and also the general importance of his home state of [LOC California  ] . 
He invited the president to visit [LOC California  ] , meet with the governor and [LOC California  ] companies with technological , agricultural and commercial interests in [LOC Brazil  ] , and address [ORG Stanford University.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Turning to the upcoming [ORG UNGA  ] and the 20 September conference in [LOC New York  ] on international hunger initiatives hosted by [LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Lula  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] is expecting over fifty heads of state to participate . 
He asked about [LOC U.S.  ] representation , and whether Secretary [PER Powell  ] would attend the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] explained that President [PER Bush  ] would be formally represented by a presidential envoy , Agriculture Secretary [PER Veneman  ] , who would be prepared to read a message from the [LOC President.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Lula  ] turned to the subject of [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy , voicing his satisfaction at the positive indicators on growth coming in over recent weeks . 
[PER Lula  ] outlined the history of boom-bust economic recovery plans in [LOC Brazil  ] over the past twenty years , and said his mission is to establish a sustained and rational growth dynamic that will be the basis for a realistic and healthy economic model for [LOC Brazil  ] over the long term. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In a pull aside with Ambassador [PER Danilovich  ] at the meeting 's conclusion , [PER Lula  ] noted that he had always been treated with respect and kindness by President [PER Bush  ] , for which [PER Lula  ] warmly expressed his gratitude. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: President [PER Lula  ] was friendly , animated and relaxed , taking 15 minutes to converse with the Ambassador in an event that often lasts only the time needed for pleasantries and handshakes . 
He used the meeting to register a message about his intention to stay the course in an economic policy he feels is being vindicated , and to make clear that he is seeking the highest possible level of USG representation at the [MISC Brazil-sponsored  ] hunger conference in [LOC New York  ] . 
It is evident that [PER Lula  ] feels strongly about the subject of the conference and also has his personal and international prestige linked to the event . 
In that sense he may be concerned about a USG presence that may appear to him as limited in the context of a heads of state meeting on [MISC American  ] soil .
