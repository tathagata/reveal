( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's new leftist government announced its policy statement on May 12 , confirming what many expected to be a move towards " traditional " [MISC Nordic  ] social and economic policy . 
Taxes and other revenue streams will need to be increased to meet the government 's goal of reduced deficits and a balanced budget by 2013 . 
The [ORG Social-Democratic  ] and [ORG Left-Green  ] coalition referred perhaps its most pressing issue -- whether or not to apply for [ORG EU  ] membership -- to the parliament , in what many here see as a concession to deep [ORG LG  ] misgivings . 
The Prime Minister 's [ORG Social Democratic  ] party may win the vote on [ORG EU  ] talks , but will likely need opposition support to do so . 
On other foreign policy fronts , the turn towards [MISC Nordic  ] cooperation is confirmed , and the [LOC U.S.  ] is no longer explicitly noted as [LOC Iceland  ] 's leading ally in security . 
As with other budget cuts , the coming battle over defense spending is likely to be bitter . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On May 12 , the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) and the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) announced the composition and policy statement for their new government formed after the April 25 elections ( reftel ) . 
It confirms expectations of a sharp left turn in government policy and states that it intends to be a " [MISC Nordic  ] welfare government in the truest sense of the word " . 
The new government presented its policy statement as well as a 100-day plan . 
A resolution authorizing the government to begin [ORG EU  ] membership talks will be presented in the upcoming summer session of the [ORG Althingi  ] which begins this coming Friday , May 15 . 
[ORG SDA  ] figures and political commentators tell Post that the summer session will likely run for six weeks before adjourning for summer holidays and reconvening in late September/early October . 
ECONOMY: BALANCED BUDGET , BUT HOW ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) On the economy , there are not a lot of specifics other than statements about the " tough work ahead " in the 17-page coalition policy agreement . 
The new government coalition says it wants to ensure economic and social stability , and to seek national unity on [LOC Iceland  ] 's path to reconstruction through a new " stability pact . 
" PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] said at the government 's first press conference that the government would begin meeting with labor unions and industry leaders to seek broad national consensus on wage cuts and other measures to minimize further job losses . 
Initial efforts at budget cutting will be announced during the summer , and the government has said initial guidelines on tax hikes and other revenue-boosting measures will be unveiled during the week of May 18 . 
This is in keeping with the government 's stated plan to achieve a balanced budget by 2013 . 
The preference ( particularly among the [MISC Left-Greens  ] ) is to raise taxes , with the government implying that it will target the upper end of the socioeconomic spectrum . 
Press reports from the first government cabinet meeting on May 12 indicate that income taxes may not be raised immediately , though other taxes on consumers and industry are possible avenues . 
The new Minister of Fisheries has already floated the idea of an export tax on unprocessed fish , both as a revenue stream and as a way of encouraging domestic job creation in fish processing. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Other policy goals ( and an effort to hold expectations at a manageable level ) are hinted at by sentiments in the policy statement press release: " Guided by the values of equality , social justice , solidarity , sustainable development , gender equality , moral reform and democracy in [LOC Iceland  ] , the government aims at creating a [MISC Nordic  ] welfare society in [LOC Iceland  ] , where collective interests take precedence over particular interests.. . 
" " Foremost among its tasks is to revive confidence in the domestic community and rebuild [LOC Iceland  ] 's international reputation... . 
" The government maintains that if its economic and fiscal plans are successfully implemented , there is a good possibility of acceptable economic growth , low inflation , a stable currency and lower unemployment by the end of its term . 
FOREIGN POLICY: LOOKING HOPEFULLY TO THE NORDICS --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The government 's policy statement says little about non-EU foreign affairs , apart from a focus on " collective international security . 
" Defense and security policy -- including the existence and responsibilities of the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] -- will be subject to further review . 
[ORG Defense Agency  ] officials tell us that they have already been told to examine opportunities for cost-saving by combining functions or assets with other government institutions , such as the [ORG Coast Guard  ] . 
Based on comments by Foreign Minister [PER Skarphedinsson  ] earlier this year , this may move rapidly from the exploratory phase into implementation . 
Also on defense , for the [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000090 002 OF 003 first time in decades , the government 's stated policy does not mention cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] as a cornerstone of [LOC Iceland  ] 's security policy , but instead refers to " allied nations " more generally . 
The new government states it will strengthen ties with the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] government and will work to promote peace and nuclear disarmament . 
The government also states its intent to declaring [LOC Iceland  ] a nuclear-free zone . 
( [PER Note: An LG-  ] and [MISC SDA-sponsored  ] bill that would have done this did not get out of committee during the spring parliamentary session . 
End Note . 
) [ORG EU  ] MEMBERSHIP: DID THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS PUNT ? --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the [ORG EU  ] , the [ORG SDA  ] appears to have been pushed back from what initially looked like a very strong negotiating position . 
Foreign Minister [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] will submit a parliamentary resolution on [LOC Iceland  ] 's application for [ORG EU  ] membership to the [ORG Althingi  ] sometime shortly after the new parliament convenes on Friday , May 15 . 
Both parties say their [MISC MPs  ] will be free to vote their consciences and not be bound by party strictures on the resolution . 
PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] emphasized the need for [LOC Iceland  ] to submit the application for membership no later than in July ( in part , many believe , to take full advantage of what [LOC Iceland  ] hopes will be a charitable view by the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency ) . 
She said that she is confident that the parliamentary resolution will be approved . 
Critics of this approach have said that if the resolution is voted down , then it could spell the end of the coalition . 
[ORG Left-Green Chair  ] [PER Sigfusson  ] said his party 's [MISC MPs  ] will be free to vote their consciences on the resolution . 
However , five [MISC LG MPs  ] have already said they will vote against the resolution . 
Even if all other [MISC LG MPs  ] vote for the resolution -- and some are hinting they may abstain -- the [ORG LG  ] " no " votes would mean the [ORG SDA  ] will need to recruit some opposition votes in order to reach a majority of 32 . 
Opposition leaders , for their part , have expressed considerable reservation about giving what they say would be a " blank check " to the [ORG SDA  ] to handle [ORG EU  ] membership talks. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several [ORG EU  ] Ambassadors in [LOC Reykjavik  ] have already noted to post their surprise and concern over the plan to refer the membership question to the [ORG Althingi  ] . 
As one put it , the [ORG SDA  ] 's need for opposition support raises the question of " how many pounds of flesh " [PER Sigurdardottir  ] will have to pay out to get the resolution through . 
Should there be too many concessions to opposition party redlines ( e.g. , on fisheries , fast-track accession to monetary union , or agriculture ) , the result could be a membership application that even the [MISC Swedes  ] will not be able to support . 
On the other hand , a defeat would be a devastating loss on the [ORG SDA  ] 's signature issue from the election campaign and a bad start for the new government . 
WHO'S WHO: STABILITY , SURPRISINGLY ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Prime Minister [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] ( [ORG SDA Chair  ] ) and Finance Minister [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] ( [ORG Left-Green Chair  ] ) retain their current positions , as does Foreign Minister [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) . 
[PER Sigfusson  ] and [PER Skarphedinsson  ] have , however , each dropped a ministry , with the [ORG LG  ] 's [PER Jon Bjarnason  ] picking up the Fisheries and Agriculture portfolio and [ORG SDA  ] rising star [PER Katrin Juliusdottir  ] heading over to run the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] . 
Also of note , the two non-political ministers -- the Minister of [ORG Justice  ] and the Minister of Economy ( formerly known as [ORG Business Affairs  ] ) -- will stay on . 
The coalition policy agreement also states plans to re-organize the ministries to have one " [ORG Ministry of Employment  ] " to oversee Fisheries , Agriculture , and Industry . 
This will be implemented in 2010 at the earliest . 
There is also the potential for a reorganization of other ministries , including the amalgamation of the [ORG Ministries of Justice and Communications  ] into a single [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] . 
PM [PER Sigurdardottir  ] has said she hopes to reduce the total number of ministries to nine by the end of 2010 . 
The government 's 12 cabinet ministers are as follows: -Prime Minister: [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) -Minister for Foreign Affairs: [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) -Minister of [LOC Finance:  ] [PER Steingrimur J. Sigfusson  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) -Minister of [ORG Health: Ogmundur Jonasson  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) -Minister of [ORG Justice  ] and Ecclesiastical Affairs: [PER Ragna Arnadottir  ] ( non-party affiliated ; [ORG MOJ Civil Servant  ] , previously Director of [ORG MOJ Office of Legal Policy  ] ) -Minister of Economic Affairs: [PER Gylfi Magnusson  ] ( non-party affiliated ; Associate Professor in Economics at University of [LOC Iceland  ] ) -Minister of [ORG Industry:  ] [PER Katrin Juliusdottir  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) -Minister of Education , Science and Culture and Minister for [MISC Nordic  ] [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000090 003 OF 003 Cooperation: [PER Katrin Jakobsdottir  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) -Minister of [ORG Social Affairs  ] and [ORG Social Security:  ] Arni [PER Pall Arnason  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) -Minister of [ORG Communications:  ] [PER Kristjan Moller  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) -Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture: [PER Jon Bjarnason  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) -Minister for the [ORG Environment: Svandis Svavarsdottir  ] ( [ORG LG  ] ) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The biggest surprise from the new coalition agreement is by far the decision to refer [ORG EU  ] membership to a parliamentary vote . 
This is a high-stakes gamble for [PER Sigurdardottir  ] . 
A win with opposition support gives her a strong hand in leading [LOC Iceland  ] towards [LOC Brussels  ] and considerable leverage over her [ORG Left-Green  ] coalition partners . 
However , a loss -- and despite the PM 's optimistic statements , this is not something we can rule out -- would be a tough blow on the [ORG SDA  ] 's signature issue from the campaign and would embolden the opposition considerably . 
Further , as other diplomats here have noted , even a resolution approving the start of talks with the [ORG EU  ] may be a poisoned chalice should it be overly loaded with preconditions and caveats. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment , cont 'd : On defense and security , one thing is certain -- there will be blood on the floor when the government 's new budget comes out . 
Some here have taken to joking that the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] spends most of its time defending itself from its own government . 
Depending on how any consolidation with the [ORG Coast Guard  ] plays out , this could be proven very true . 
End Comment .
