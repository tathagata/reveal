[PER Boucher  ] called on both [MISC Afghan  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] [PER Jirga Commissions  ] to meet as soon as possible . 
[PER Karzai  ] is doing everything he can to make the jirgas work . 
The President expressed his opposition to [MISC Pakistani  ] mining and fencing of the border and suggested that [LOC Pakistan  ] close madrassas and terrorist training camps if it was really serious about terrorism . 
[PER Karzai  ] wants to rid himself of the [MISC Bugti  ] problem but argued that the [MISC Bugtis  ] were not terrorists . 
[PER Boucher  ] briefed on requested budget funding for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He encouraged acceptance of ground spraying of poppy crops in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] was non-committal and pointed to [MISC British  ] reluctance . 
[PER Karzai  ] believes that 2007 will be a better year for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and called for better preparations to show the people that we were ready for the spring offensive . 
END SUMMARY [ORG Overseas Private Investment Corporation Projects in Afghanistan  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Karzai  ] began by noting that electricity was becoming increasingly important for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Electric power from [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s neighbors was unreliable and countries like [LOC Uzbekistan  ] were raising prices , he said . 
[PER Mosbacher  ] briefed [PER Karzai  ] on his meetings in [LOC Kabul  ] on electricity and other projects . 
He said new power capacity and building private sector development were key . 
If and when the legal structure for independent power production was established , the [ORG Investment Corporation  ] would be able to help with more financing. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to a question from [PER Karzai  ] about projects being considered , [PER Mosbacher  ] explained that industrial consumers were paying too much for electricity . 
These entities would be good customers for new electricity projects since households were not paying enough to support new investment . 
At the end of March , the utility industry would be corporatized , but a consistent set of rules will be needed to set a framework for independent power production . 
Any private power project would take 18-24 months from the time the legal framework was established . 
[PER Karzai  ] thought this was too long . 
[PER Mosbacher  ] explained that huge pieces of equipment needed to be brought in , which takes time . 
They would be run by heavy fuel oil , but natural gas was best as it was a fraction of the cost of diesel . 
In addition , laws needed to be passed before investment could begin. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mosbacher  ] explained that other [ORG Investment Corporation  ] projects included a 209-room , four-star [ORG Marriott Hotel  ] . 
The project was on track but outstanding problems on the lease needed to be resolved . 
He expected that construction could start in the spring and with an opening within 18-24 months . 
Much of the material and labor will be sourced in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The hotel will employ 400 people. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mosbacher  ] briefed that his organization was also going to be providing small and medium-sized business credits for agricultural and manufacturing facilities , through a new commercial and a non-bank lending institution . 
These two [LOC KABUL  ] 00000185 002 OF 005 projects could start in 6-9 months . 
Cross-Border Jirgas ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) President [PER Karzai  ] said that [LOC Afghanistan  ] had done everything it could on the jirgas , e.g. , providing lists and documents to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Prime Minister [PER Aziz  ] explained during his visit that a [ORG Commission  ] would soon be appointed . 
Assistant Secretary [PER Boucher  ] urged that both sides get their Commissions together as the next step , the sooner the better . 
He suggested it shouldn , t be too difficult to work out the local versus national versions of the jirgas and pledged [LOC U.S.  ] and international support . 
[PER Karzai  ] reiterated that he was doing everything he could . 
[PER Boucher  ] stated that he would nudge the [MISC Pakistanis  ] on the jirgas and hoped the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister-level meetings would continue. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] described [PER Aziz  ] as a “good man , ” someone he could talk to openly and frankly . 
[PER Aziz  ] had the intellectual capacity to talk through the issues . 
[PER Karzai  ] hoped the [LOC U.S.  ] could influence the [MISC Pakistanis  ] on the jirgas . 
[PER Boucher  ] noted that Speaker Quanooni had been invited to [LOC Pakistan  ] and [PER Karzai  ] said he would encourage him to go . 
[ORG Border Mining  ] and Fencing --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Assistant Secretary relayed press reports that [LOC Pakistan  ] may be reconsidering its proposal for selective mining and fencing of the border . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] had been encouraging [LOC Pakistan  ] to use the tripartite meetings to deal with such issues . 
[PER Karzai  ] said there was speculation that [LOC Pakistan  ] was clamping down on the [ORG Taliban  ] and the insurgency on the border as a pretext to get to the [MISC Balochi  ] refugees who were crossing the border . 
He observed that there was much domestic pressure in [LOC Pakistan  ] against mining and fencing . 
[PER Boucher  ] interpreted the move as a sign of [MISC Pakistani  ] frustration and that [LOC Pakistan  ] was taking the border problem seriously . 
[PER Karzai  ] rebutted that they could close madrassas and training centers if they were really serious about terrorism . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] just needed to check its own intelligence. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] noted that some in the [MISC Pakistani  ] media were calling for jihad against the [LOC United States  ] . 
He expected more bloodshed in 2007 . 
Assistant Secretary [PER Boucher  ] replied that the [MISC Pakistani  ] media said many things but it was important to look at the actual situation on the border . 
For example , in November , there was actually a decrease in infiltration from [LOC North Waziristan  ] , although the reason is unclear . 
[PER Karzai  ] explained that the media in the region was not like that in the [LOC West  ] , as it was easily manipulated by governments . 
Both the [MISC Pakistani  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] governments knew well how to use the media. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] told [PER Karzai  ] that the [LOC United States  ] believed that [LOC Pakistan  ] was now doing more on terrorism . 
He pointed to an increase in arrests of more [ORG Taliban  ] and the recent attack on a madrassa in the [ORG Bajaur Agency  ] . 
[PER Boucher  ] acknowledged , however , that some [MISC Pakistani  ] authorities also turned a blind eye to infiltrators . 
He said we needed to keep reminding them of their responsibilities . 
[PER Karzai  ] responded that we needed to keep reminding them to give up the [MISC Pakistani  ] dream of a larger [MISC Islamic Pakistani  ] Emirate . 
[PER Boucher  ] conveyed the [LOC United States  ] , view that both [PER Musharraf  ] and [PER Aziz  ] knew well the dangers of not cracking down on terrorism . 
He said events in [LOC North Waziristan  ] have scared them and they now fear they could lose control . 
[PER Boucher  ] agreed that we needed to see swifter action by [MISC Pakistani  ] authorities , but we should not doubt their commitment . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00000185 003 OF 005 [PER Bugti  ] ----- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Assistant Secretary [PER Boucher  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] if he knew where [PER Bugti  ] was . 
[PER Karzai  ] responded that a lot of [MISC Bugtis  ] come to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In fact , over 200 , with their sons and money , have come . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he advised them to go the [ORG United Nations  ] for asylum , but many were frightened and are in hiding . 
The [ORG United Nations  ] declined to deal with the issue , considering it too sensitive . 
[PER Karzai  ] said he was “not interested in having them in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as it was too much trouble.” <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In his meeting with [MISC Pakistani  ] Prime Minister [PER Aziz  ] , [PER Karzai  ] had said that the [MISC Bugtis  ] were not terrorists and represented nobility in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , so it would be hard to turn them over to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Boucher  ] clarified that it was the grandson that the [MISC Pakistanis  ] were after for instigating an uprising . 
[PER Karzai  ] responded that fomenting uprising does not make one a terrorist . 
The real terrorists were [PER Bin Laden  ] and [PER Mullah Omar  ] . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] needs a sign that [LOC Pakistan  ] will stop supporting these terrorists . 
[PER Boucher  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] which side should move first and queried whether [LOC Afghanistan  ] could take the grandson into custody or strike some political deal . 
[PER Karzai  ] explained that the [MISC Bugtis  ] would blame the [LOC United States  ] if [LOC Afghanistan  ] turned them in . 
There would be disgust toward both [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Boucher  ] asked [PER Karzai  ] if he could assure [LOC Pakistan  ] that the [MISC Bugtis  ] were not supporting armed struggle and that [LOC India  ] was not involved . 
[PER Karzai  ] said “yes” , though he doubted [LOC Pakistan  ] would accpet his assurances . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] would continue to think [LOC India  ] is involved . 
There is a lot of misinformation out there , [PER Karzai  ] commented . 
He said he knew [PER Bugti  ] , who was highly respected in the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Karzai  ] explained that [PER Bugti  ] had once tried to call [PER Karzai  ] but he had refused for the sake of good relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Now he cannot forgive himself for refusing . 
[PER Karzai  ] assessed that [LOC Pakistan  ] had troubles with many other tribes too , as a result of its trying to divide and conquer and turn the tribes against each other . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] needed to address the bigger picture , [PER Karzai  ] urged . 
( [PER Note: Halfway  ] through the discussion of [PER Bugti  ] , [PER Karzai  ] signaled that the issue was too sensitive and asked that notetaking be suspended . 
End Note ) New [LOC U.S.  ] Funding ---------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Boucher  ] briefed [PER Karzai  ] in broad terms on new funding for [LOC Afghanistan  ] that we expect to come from a supplemental budget .

The [LOC United States  ] will be pushing countries to commit to funding where it is needed most . 
He reported that [ORG Presidential Senior Economic Advisor Naderi  ] had agreed to attend a series of meetings to brief on where the money was most needed. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] explained that several key elements should move forward to support the new money , namely the [ORG Presidential Appointments Commission  ] , improved governance , continuation of the [ORG Policy Action Group  ] process ( which he said was working well ) , more government presence around the country such as the [ORG Presidential Policy Action Group  ] visit to [LOC Kandahar  ] , and dealing with corruption . 
[PER Karzai  ] expressed his disappointment with the [ORG Policy Action Group  ] , asking “What is [LOC KABUL  ] 00000185 004 OF 005 it doing ? ” He said that when displaced people from [LOC Kandahar  ] have been returned and when the youth in the [LOC South  ] have jobs , then he will be able to declare that the [ORG Policy Action Group  ] was working . 
16 . 
( C ) On corruption , [PER Karzai  ] called for corrupt people to be punished and to simplify the procedures for doing so . 
On governance , he believed that the situation was much better than three years ago . 
Most governors were competent and knew what was going on in their provinces . 
[PER Karzai  ] felt that the Government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] was much more in charge than three years ago . 
He said the police were better and were becoming more linked to other police in other regions . 
Organization and training had much improved. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Boucher  ] said that the supplemental budget would allow for an expanded target for police expansion and stepped up training . 
He shared that the budget would be more than the normal [ORG USD  ] 3 billion , but possibly broken up between 2007 and 2008 , with the police and military portion showing up in 2007 . 
The money would focus on more training equipment , road construction , power grids , and provincial judicial systems . 
[PER Boucher  ] said that the final figures would be out in a few weeks , possibly around the time of the [ORG State of Union Address  ] . 
Secretary Rice would make an announcement at the [ORG NATO  ] Foreign Ministers meeting . 
More details will emerge in February . 
[ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] ------------------ <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Boucher  ] apologized that scheduling programs had prevented the travel of Under Secretary [PER Burns  ] for the [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] meeting . 
With the [MISC SIPDIS  ] expected arrival of Deputy Secretary [PER Negroponte  ] , Burns’ schedule should become more flexible , he said . 
[PER Boucher  ] underlined that [PER Burns  ] was keenly interested in the [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] said it would send an important signal . 
[LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC Helmand  ] and Poppy --------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] asked if the [LOC United States  ] was “fine with the [LOC UK  ] in [LOC Helmand  ] ? 
Are they up to something ? ” [PER Boucher  ] responded that the [MISC British  ] were trying to do a good job and were focused on [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] said they need to know that [LOC Helmand  ] is part of a bigger picture . 
[PER Boucher  ] agreed and said it was important to get other countries to look at the country as a whole and to promote national authority , not just focus on the regions where they are operating. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
[PER Boucher  ] said that everyone needed to accept ground spraying of poppy in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] stated that the [LOC United Kingdom  ] would not accept it . 
[PER Boucher  ] urged [PER Karzai  ] to focus on poppy this year to show our seriousness in the most serious of places , [LOC Helmand  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] reported that [LOC Helmand  ] Governor [LOC Wafa  ] complained that the [MISC British  ] were willing to do eradication only in areas where there was government control , but that we needed to eradicate where the [ORG Taliban  ] were . 
[PER Boucher  ] urged [PER Karzai  ] to consider a pilot project in [LOC Helmand  ] and offered to approach the [MISC British  ] if necessary .
