( U ) On October 1 , the division of responsibilities within several Ministries changed as part of the ruling coalition 's effort to streamline the government . 
Plans for the changes began May 10 when the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] and the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] formed their coalition and announced intentions to reduce the number of Ministries . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament passed legislation September 3 to implement some of these ministerial changes . 
An official at the Prime Minister 's Office told [MISC EmbOff  ] that , the process is not complete. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Four ministries were renamed to reflect more accurately their new roles . 
The [ORG Ministry of Business Affairs  ] became the [ORG Ministry of Economic Policy  ] and [ORG Business Affairs  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] and [ORG Ecclesiastical Affairs  ] is now the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] and [ORG Human Rights  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry of Communications  ] is now the [ORG Ministry of Communications  ] and [ORG Municipal Affairs  ] .

It now oversees the [ORG Central Bank and Statistics Iceland  ] , which both previously came under the Prime Minister 's office . 
The [ORG Economic Department of the Ministry of Finance  ] , responsible for surveys of the economy and fiscal revenue forecasts , joined [ORG Statistics Iceland  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry of Economic Policy  ] and [ORG Business Affairs  ] also took over the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] 's responsibility for rules on auditing , bookkeeping and annual reports . 
According to an official from the Prime Minister 's office , the changes leave the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] with no policy formulation responsibility , but management of such government assets as the [ORG State Broadcasting Agency  ] and the quasi-government agency in charge of the former [ORG NATO  ] base . 
Also under the [ORG Ministry  ] 's control is the [ORG State Bank Handling Company  ] , established by legislation in August to manage the State 's shares in financial institutions . 
The [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] and [ORG Human Rights  ] assumed responsibility to administer municipal elections and real estate valuations and also now handles consumer protection , which various ministries had previously shared. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The September 3 law renaming and reallocating responsibilities among ministries , however , only implements part of the government 's planned changes . 
The coalition agreement states that the government also intends to merge all of the " occupational " ministries , presumably the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Fisheries  ] into one [ORG Ministry  ] and to merge the [ORG Ministry of Communications  ] and [ORG Municipal Affairs  ] with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] and [ORG Human Rights  ] . 
The agreement also identifies goals of strengthening the leadership role of the Prime Minister 's Office , increasing cooperation between ministries and increasing the government 's cooperation with labor market parties and other interest groups .
