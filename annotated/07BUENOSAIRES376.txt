( C ) Summary and [ORG Comment: Argentina  ] 's President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] is trying to stake out a position for himself close to [PER Chavez  ] yet still working well with the [LOC U.S.  ] on issues important to [LOC Argentina  ] . 
With domestic political advantage and 2007 elections in mind , we expect [PER Kirchner  ] to continue the balancing act . 
[PER Kirchner  ] will lash out with largely indirect criticism , he will cozy up to [PER Chavez  ] , and yet he will maintain a number of open doors to us . 
[PER Kirchner  ] recognizes the value of maintaining quiet , positive relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] -- particularly on key strategic issues , e.g. non-proliferation and counterterrorism -- but sees no value domestically in aligning himself publicly with the [LOC U.S.  ] or its policies . 
In fact , he gets a domestic boost from lashing out at perceived pressure and in striking an independent pose , a la [PER Charles de Gaulle  ] . 
[LOC Argentina  ] 's commercial and economic relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] is also of strategic importance ( refs. a , b ) , the difference being that , domestically , [PER Kirchner  ] does perceive value , in particular electorally , in publicly linking himself to [PER Chavez  ] ; he is bringing home the bacon . 
The meetings between senior [ORG GoA  ] ministers and [PER AG Gonzalez  ] and [PER U/S Burns  ] and [PER A/S Shannon  ] were uniformly positive , recognizing an important common agenda in many areas ( refs c-d and septels ) , and the press play from the visits was positive and profuse . 
In light of this dynamic , [PER Kirchner  ] 's statements in [LOC Venezuela  ] -- that [LOC Argentina  ] will " not contain [LOC Venezuela  ] " and his invitation for [PER Chavez  ] to visit in March are indicative of the [ORG GoA  ] 's desire to maintain what they see as a " balance " in relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Attorney General [PER Gonzales'  ] February 6-7 visit , and [PER U/S Nick Burns  ] and [PER A/S Shannon  ] 's February 8-9 visit to [LOC Buenos Aires  ] and meetings with senior [PER Kirchner  ] ministers served to underscore improving bilateral relations , the breadth of that relationship , as well as highlight [LOC U.S.  ] policy priorities in the region . 
[PER Kirchner  ] insiders , Cabinet Chief [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] and Planning Minister [PER Julio De Vido  ] , confirmed to [PER Burns  ] and [PER Shannon  ] the importance of the relationship to the [ORG GoA  ] , the strong working-level cooperation on counterterrorism , counternarcotics , and international support for non-proliferation . 
Together with Foreign Minister [PER Taiana  ] , they shared concerns about the situation in [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] , and the need for strengthening stability in the region , including through joint efforts in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
They also emphasized the importance they place on attracting [LOC U.S.  ] investment ( although a negative decision made public during the visit regarding a [LOC U.S.  ] investment fund seeking a share of a local energy transmitting company , indicates that the actual message to potential investors , at best , is mixed ) . 
Cabinet Chief [PER Fernandez  ] publicly characterized relations as " good " the day after Burns' visit. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [PER Kirchner  ] style from the beginning , however , has been combative in the face of real , imagined and fabricated challenges from sources as varied as the [MISC Catholic  ] church , neoliberalism and the " [LOC Washington  ] consensus , " the [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG IMF  ] , parasitic foreign multi-nationals , the press and political opponents ( whether from within or from outside the [MISC Peronist  ] party ) and -- indirectly stated -- the the [LOC U.S.  ] This style has stood him in good stead . 
As the economy boomed , buoyed by favorable external factors , his popularity ratings have soared , and have remained high , due in no small part to his pugnacious character. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kirchner  ] demonstrated again over the last two weeks his willingness to attack external institutions for domestic political gain . 
He lashed out on several occasions at the [MISC IFIs  ] and other international organizations , rejecting their latest gentle criticisms of [ORG GoA  ] economic policies and blaming them again for the 2001/2002 financial crisis and also for current high poverty levels . 
His outburst followed mildly critical comments from the [ORG World Bank  ] and [ORG World Trade Organization  ] officials about the sustainability of the [ORG GoA  ] 's economic policies . 
He was also responding to an [ORG IMF  ] spokesman 's comment to the press that an [ORG IMF  ] agreement was normally a prerequisite for [ORG Paris Club  ] debt rescheduling . 
Despite the [ORG IMF  ] 's explanation that this was a [ORG Paris Club  ] , not [ORG IMF  ] , requirement , [PER Kirchner  ] blamed the [ORG IMF  ] -- his favorite whipping boy -- for blocking a [ORG Paris Club  ] deal . 
He and his Economic Minister , [PER Felisa Miceli  ] , also used the opportunity to pander to the public 's extreme hostility towards the [ORG IMF  ] by rejecting categorically any possibility of a Fund program with [LOC Argentina.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) This dynamic helps explain the two faces of [PER Kirchner  ] we see in our bilateral relations . 
[PER Kirchner  ] is essentially pragmatic but excessively focused on domestic issues and public opinion . 
The low point in recent bilateral relations , occasioned by the [ORG GoA  ] performance at the [LOC Mar del Plata Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] in November 2005 , perhaps convinced [PER Kirchner  ] he had gone a bit too far down the populist route . 
Since then , we have seen a gradual and steady improvement in relations with an increasing willingness by senior-level officials in engaging in dialogue with us and in identifying areas where we can strengthen cooperation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) However , we do not expect to see a public embrace of the [LOC U.S.  ] or many of our policies . 
The public image of the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Argentina  ] is the lowest in the region . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's regular verbal assaults on policies and institutions linked in the public mind to the [LOC U.S.  ] , e.g. globalization and the international financial institutions , resonate very well here as long as they don't foretell a serious break ( see latest INR U.S Image paper from the Oct-Nov 2006 [MISC Latinobarometro  ] poll comparing [LOC Argentina  ] with 17 other regional publics ) . 
[PER Kirchner  ] calculates -- with at least one eye always on the next election -- that there is little up-side to being linked too closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and little down-side to occasionally " standing firm " and " protecting the people 's interests " before the hegemonic power. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The press here eggs this on , couching many issues as the ideological struggle between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] for predominance in the region . 
As a reflection of this , [ORG GoA  ] actions are either portrayed as pro-Chavez or as a rapprochement with the [LOC U.S.  ] Contacts inform us that [PER Kirchner  ] also sees himself as maintaining this balance between the two -- a la [PER Charles de Gualle  ] between the cold war powers [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC USSR  ] . 
The Embassy has seen on several occasions , when the press appears to be too caught up in portraying the improving [MISC U.S.-  ] [ORG GoA  ] relations , that [PER Kirchner  ] will find an opportunity to publicly stick a pin in that balloon . 
In the aftermath of the [MISC Gonzalez/Burns/Shannon  ] visits , [PER Kirchner  ] , while in [LOC Venezuela  ] recently to sign a number of commercial agreements , may have felt compelled to " right the balance " and demonstrate his independence with his gratuitous remark that [LOC Argentina  ] would not " contain " [PER Chavez  ] ( ref . 
A ) . 
The media here has , in fact , tied [PER Kirchner  ] 's comments in [LOC Venezuela  ] to Burns/Shannon remarks made here during their recent visit that the [LOC U.S.  ] could work well with governments like [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] but that [LOC Venezuela  ] was " another matter . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: It is clear we have foreign policy differences with the [PER Kirchner  ] administration , particularly over how we view [PER Chavez  ] and his actions in [LOC Venezuela  ] and the region . 
Press reports here say [PER Chavez  ] will be paying a return visit to [PER Kirchner  ] next week , coinciding with President [PER Bush  ] 's visit to [LOC Uruguay  ] ( septel - Senior [ORG GoA  ] contacts tell us the visit is still unconfirmed ) . 
Ambassador has expressed our strong concerns that [PER Chavez  ] will use the occasion to organize another anti-U.S. rally ( as is being reported in the press ) , and that such an act would negatively impact our bilateral relations . 
This , unfortunately , would be the type of gesture to be expected of [PER Kirchner  ] ; one focused on short-term electoral political gain , with little thought for longer-term consequences . 
We should not expect significant changes in the [ORG GOA  ] 's foreign policy or [ORG GOA  ] public statements in support of the [LOC U.S.  ] Nor is [PER Kirchner  ] likely to change many of his interventionist economic tendencies . 
All of this is especially true in an election year . 
But on most of the key bilateral and multilateral issues important to the [LOC U.S.  ] , in fact , we believe we can continue to build strong cooperation in a quiet , deliberate way .
