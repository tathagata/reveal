Representatives from [MISC Sudanese  ] rebel groups have not yet been invited to participate in side discussions , though Secretary for [MISC African  ] Affairs [PER Ali Treiki  ] has invited Special Envoy Gration for consultations in [LOC Tripoli  ] April 17-18 , perhaps a sign that [LOC Libya  ] intends to re-start its mediation in the region ahead of the regular July summit meeting for AU heads of state that al-Qadhafi hopes to host . 
End summary . 
AL-QADHAFI SEEKS MORE POWER FOR AU EXECUTIVE 2 . 
( C ) [MISC Libyan  ] officials have confirmed that the April 15-16 extraordinary meeting for [ORG African Union  ] foreign ministers will be held in Sirte and are planning a gala opening with remarks from [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
In an April 8 conversation with [PER Poloff  ] , [PER Ali Treiki  ] 's Chief of Staff [PER Mahmoud Azzabi  ] said he expected high attendance and hinted that the [MISC Tripoli-based  ] diplomatic corps would be flown en masse to observe the proceedings . 
Though specifics of the agenda have not been distributed to member states , [MISC Libyan  ] officials confirm that the main discussion item is the creation of the [ORG African Union Authority  ] - described as a step toward al-Qadhafi 's vision for the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Azzabi  ] went on to say that " several studies " would be presented to outline the legal steps necessary to transform the existing [ORG African Union Commission  ] into a more powerful executive body to be chaired by al-Qadhafi himself . 
3 . 
( C ) Diplomats from AU member states here downplayed the importance of the meeting but expect CEN-SAD members to send delegations . 
According to the [MISC Egyptian  ] Embassy , [MISC Egyptian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] will not attend and many southern [MISC African  ] states will send lower-ranking delegates if they attend at all . 
CEN-SAD will not have consultations similar to those before the AU [MISC Summit  ] in February ( ref A ) - a decision an [MISC Egyptian  ] contact described as unnecessary because [LOC Libya  ] " already knows who is with them and who is against them . 
" DARFUR MEETINGS POSSIBLE , THOUGH NO ANNOUNCEMENT YET 4 . 
( C ) Observers here have speculated that [LOC Libya  ] would use the [ORG AU  ] meeting as a platform to reassert its role in [LOC Darfur  ] mediation . 
When asked whether these talks were planned , [PER Azzabi  ] said only , " it would be customary to have these sort of talks on the margins of a meeting like that . 
" However , representatives from both the [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Equality Movement  ] ( [ORG JEM/KI  ] ) and the [MISC Sudanese  ] [ORG Liberation Army/Unity  ] faction ( SLA/Unity ) deny receiving any invitation from the [ORG GOL  ] for either Sirte or [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
SLA/Unity has not yet begun its consultations with [MISC Darfuri  ] civil society members ( ref B ) , citing logistical difficulty getting field leaders to attend . 
According to the [MISC Egyptian  ] embassy , al-Qadhafi recently encouraged President [PER Bashir  ] to begin criminal prosecutions of alleged human rights violators in [LOC Darfur  ] on the national level and to permit humanitarian aid to reach the people in an effort to quiet international criticism . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's [PER Ali Treiki  ] phoned the Ambassador on April 9 to extend an invitation for Special Envoy Gration to come to [LOC Tripoli  ] for consultations on April 17-18 , a possible opportunity to press [LOC Libya  ] to do more to open humanitarian access . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: Local diplomats are skeptical that anything more than theater will come out of the April AU meeting , with several [LOC AU  ] member state embassies reporting that it may hurt [LOC Libya  ] 's chances of hosting the July [MISC Summit  ] meeting that was to be held in [LOC Madagascar  ] . 
According to the [MISC Egyptian  ] Embassy , [LOC Libya  ] has nonetheless begun inviting some heads of state for July , an initiative that the [MISC Egyptians  ] plan to help promote .
