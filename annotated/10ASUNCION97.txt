END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----------- [PER FILIZZOLA  ] INFORMS AMBASSADOR OF NEW [MISC GOP  ] PROGRAM --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Interior Minister [PER Rafael Filizzola  ] told the Ambassador February 10 that the [MISC GOP  ] would soon be rolling out a new , expanded cell phone intercept program , which would continue to cover counternarcotics but would also include anti-kidnapping cases as the [MISC GOP  ] ratchets up efforts to capture members of the [ORG Paraguayan People 's Army  ] ( [ORG EPP  ] ) involved in the [PER Fidel Zavala  ] kidnapping . 
Since September 2009 , [ORG DEA  ] has had an active cell phone intercept program limited solely to counter-narcotics , managed by the [ORG Anti-Drug Secretariat  ] ( [ORG SENAD  ] ) ( which is independent of the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] ) . 
On several occasions since the October kidnapping of rancher [PER Zavala  ] by the [ORG EPP  ] , Minister [PER Filizzola  ] asked Ambassador [PER Ayalde  ] and/or [ORG DEA  ] to allow the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] access to the cell intercept program so that it could pursue leads in the kidnapping case . 
Embassy declined access to the system , but cooperated with the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] in order to monitor 12 lines related to the kidnapping . 
On February 10 , Minister [PER Filizzola  ] told the Ambassador that the [MISC GOP  ] had everything in place ( legal framework , equipment , etc . 
) for a broader intercept program , but he learned that his program would impact the [MISC DEA-SIU  ] program . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] procured [MISC Brazilian  ] intercept equipment for [MISC USD  ] 1.2 million but needed access to the software available via the [MISC DEA-SIU  ] program at [ORG SENAD  ] in order to make it operational . 
The Minister further said that he now understood that the technology did not permit both programs to operate independently . 
Thus the [ORG USG  ] could either authorize the [ORG Ministry  ] to link up with the [ORG DEA  ] software or the [MISC GOP  ] would procure the rest of its own system which would mean that the [ORG USG  ] program housed in [ORG SENAD  ] would be shut down . 
While acknowledging that drugs are a serious problem , the Minister stated that they are not the only security issue confronting [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
Kidnapping , arms trafficking and corruption , the Minister stated , could not be subordinated to the war on drugs . 
[PER Filizzola  ] said the [MISC GOP  ] 's top priority was capturing the [ORG EPP  ] , which had to take precedence over counternarcotics . 
He was specifically concerned about the [MISC USD  ] 550,000 the [ORG EPP  ] received during the [PER Zavala  ] kidnapping , the [ORG EPP  ] 's interest in generating instability , and the leads the [MISC GOP  ] had on some other possible kidnappings . 
" Counternarcotics are important , " he said , " but won't topple our government . 
The [ORG EEP  ] could . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Filizzola  ] assured the Ambassador that the [MISC DEA-SIU  ] cell intercept program would continue , but encouraged the Embassy to cede access to its cell intercept software to the [MISC GOP  ] or it would be rendered obsolete . 
The Minister said [ORG SENAD  ] would still be able to intercept lines , but the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] would need to utilize our software . 
[PER Filizzola  ] said President [PER Lugo  ] had approved the new program , and would speak to [ORG SENAD  ] Minister [PER Cesar Aquino  ] regarding same . 
( NOTE: As of this writing , [PER Lugo  ] had not broken the news to [PER Aquino  ] . 
END NOTE ) . 
[PER Filizzola  ] told the Ambassador that he wanted to ensure transparency with the Embassy and secure our continued cooperation . 
The Minister stressed that he had the support and legal framework from the courts , [ORG Public Ministry  ] , and the telephone regulatory agency [ORG CONATEL  ] . 
The Minister noted that since the [ORG DEA  ] already owns the connecting software ( [ORG LMNS  ] ) equipment , it would be more sensible and helpful to the [MISC GOP  ] if the [LOC U.S.  ] would authorize its use by the [ORG Ministry .  ] 
The alternative-the [MISC GOP  ] starting from scratch-- would waste precious time in the [MISC GOP  ] 's urgent effort to capture members of the [ORG EPP  ] and would render our equipment/software obsolete. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador made clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] had no interest in involving itself in the intercept program if the potential existed for it to be abused for political gain , but confirmed [LOC U.S.  ] interest in cooperating on an intercept program with safeguards , as long as it included counternarcotics . 
While noting that the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] 's current personnel are trustworthy , the Ambassador noted that others could abuse this technology in the future . 
The Minister concurred and added that both he and the President were keenly aware of the potential risks . 
The [ORG Minster  ] added that he believes there are currently three or four clandestine pieces of equipment in [LOC Paraguay  ] capable of intercepting cellular phone calls . 
This equipment was purchased by members of the previous government using questionable funding and disappeared once the [PER Lugo  ] government took over . 
Both [PER Filizzola  ] and Vice Minister [PER Caballero  ] , who was also present for the meeting , confirmed that controls are crucial . 
[PER Caballero  ] assured the Ambassador that the following judicial and procedural protections are in place: 1 ) the intercept room will be managed by [ORG Public Ministry  ] prosecutors and the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] ; 2 ) cellular phone providers will know which lines the [MISC GOP  ] is listening to and will only grant permission based on a judicial order ; 3 ) judicial orders can only be issued by three [MISC Asuncion-based  ] judges , which are the same judges authorized to issue the orders under the current [MISC DEA-SENAD  ] program ; 4 ) the [ORG Supreme Court  ] will ensure that only authorized taps are in place ; 5 ) the equipment purchased by the [MISC GOP  ] automatically tracks every action taken and its historical account cannot be altered or erased ; and 6 ) the law only permits cell phone interception for anti-kidnapping ( in this case , pursuit of the [ORG EPP  ] ) and counter-narcotics ; there are no other lawful purposes. --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----------------------- IN SPITE OF SOME QUESTIONS , THE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Despite some initial technical questions from [ORG DEA  ] , it appears that [PER Filizzola  ] 's plan is feasible given the [MISC GOP  ] 's purchase of additional technology . 
The highly technical nature of this program has lent itself to confusion about what is and is not possible . 
From [PER Filizzola  ] 's first request to use the software ( [ORG LMNS  ] ) that the Embassy installed at [ORG SENAD  ] , we had consistently indicated that [ORG DEA Washington  ] had to weigh in . 
So the Embassy arranged for a February 17 video-teleconference ( [ORG VTC  ] ) between the Minister , Vice Minister [PER Caballero  ] , and [PER Filizzola  ] 's Chief of Staff [PER Claudia Guanes  ] and [ORG DEA Washington  ] , led by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG DEA  ] 's Unit Chief Coordinator for the Science and Technology Section . 
Also present were the Ambassador and [ORG DEA Country AttachC  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During the [ORG VTC  ] , Minister [PER Filizzola  ] laid out his plans for the program in general terms , highlighting its urgency . 
He said his program would start with cell phone provider [ORG PERSONAL  ] , which is the only currently operational cell provider using the DEA-procured [ORG LMNS  ] . 
[PER Filizzola  ] asked about the status of the second [MISC DEA-  ] procured [ORG LMNS  ] for [ORG TIGO  ] , and expressed the [MISC GOP  ] 's commitment to continue the counternarcotics intercept program . 
He discussed the technical limitations with the [ORG DEA  ] experts and concluded that expansion of the intercept program was technically possible with the purchase of additional hardware and licenses . 
The Minister saw two alternatives: ( 1 ) the [ORG Ministry  ] buys additional equipment/software and replaces the [MISC DEA-purchased  ] [ORG LMNS  ] ; or ( 2 ) the [ORG Ministry  ] and [ORG SENAD  ] ( read DEA-supported program ) share the connecting software ( [ORG LMNS  ] ) . 
Both [ORG DEA  ] and the Minister asked some clarifying questions which demonstrated that the [ORG Ministry  ] had the equipment for the [ORG Monitoring Center  ] and only needed the use of the [ORG DEA  ] software currently in use at [ORG PERSONAL  ] . 
Between [ORG PERSONAL  ] and the next cell provider scheduled to come on-line , [ORG TIGO  ] , they would cover 90% of the cellular telephone market . 
[ORG DEA  ] indicated that it took them over a year to install the [ORG PERSONAL  ] system because full cooperation from the company is required . 
The Minister emphasized that this would not be an issue because they already had the decree from [ORG CONATEL  ] ( telephone industry regulator ) that forces the telephone companies to cooperate , in addition to the proper legal authorities ( based on the [MISC Constitution  ] and the anti-kidnapping law ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In light of the highly sensitive nature of this program , the Ambassador asked Minister [PER Filizzola  ] to provide the Embassy with a written request for access to the existing cell intercept software , along with copies of the laws that serve as a legal basis for the expanded program . 
Both [ORG Supreme Court  ] President [PER Fretes  ] and [ORG SENAD  ] Minister [PER Aquino  ] expressed doubts to [ORG Emboffs  ] about the legality of the expanded program . 
( NOTE: While [PER Fretes  ] told [PER Filizzola  ] that he was " on board , " it is very common for [MISC Paraguayans  ] to avoid voicing disagreement . 
[PER Aquino  ] 's concerns , in turn , may have more to do with his rivalry with Minister [PER Filizzola  ] . 
END NOTE ) . 
[ORG TIGO  ] ( [ORG Millicom  ] ) , one of [LOC Paraguay  ] 's leading cell phone providers , told the Ambassador that though they had concerns about the [MISC GOP  ] 's decision to move forward with an intercept program , they felt that [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in the program would provide them with some " cover . 
" --------------------------------------------- ---------------- COMMENT: GET ON BOARD OR GET LEFT BEHIND --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Given the political pressures on the [MISC GOP  ] to arrest the [ORG EPP  ] members responsible for the [LOC Zavala  ] kidnapping , there is no doubt that the [PER Lugo  ] government will continue intense efforts to improve its intercept capability . 
Our participation and concurrence is key to our counternarcotics-- and broader law enforcement-- goals in [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
If we are not supportive , the [MISC GOP  ] will view us as an obstacle to a key priority , which could jeopardize our broader relationship and the [ORG DEA  ] 's ability to pursue counternarcotics leads . 
Capturing the [ORG EPP  ] has become a top priority of the [MISC Paraguayan  ] government , and there is a real sense of urgency that it happen quickly . 
We now have an opportunity to help the [MISC GOP  ] and be viewed as a reliable and valuable partner , as well as to ensure that [LOC U.S.  ] interests in counternarcotics are protected . 
However , we want to limit our involvement to protecting [ORG DEA  ] 's program , as opposed to legitimizing the [MISC GOP  ] 's broader [LOC CT  ] intercept program . 
[ORG DEA  ] will send [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to [LOC Asuncion  ] in coming weeks , who will offer advice to the [MISC GOP  ] on how to best set up the program ( in order to protect our part of it ) . 
We have carefully navigated this very sensitive and politically sticky situation , and hope that we can move forward quickly in order to make the most of it . 
It appears that we have no other viable choice . 
END COMMENT .
