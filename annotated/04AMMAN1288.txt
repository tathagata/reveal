[PER Edward W. Gnehm  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b ) ( d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER FonMin Muasher  ] told the Ambassador February 18 that the [LOC Iraq  ] neighbors Foreign Ministers meeting in [LOC Kuwait  ] had been frank and productive , with the neighbors arguing strongly for guarantees of [MISC Iraqi  ] unity and the rights of [MISC Iraqi  ] minorities . 
[MISC Iraqi  ] [PER FonMin Zebari  ] responded that [MISC Kurds  ] do not want a separate state , but will seek to preserve some of the independence they have enjoyed for twelve years . 
[PER Muasher  ] complained to [PER Zebari  ] that [ORG IGC  ] member [PER Ahmed Chalabi  ] had spoiled two [MISC Jordanian  ] bank deals in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
According to [PER Muasher  ] , [MISC Syrian  ] [PER FonMin Sharaa  ] was the only negative voice at the [LOC Kuwait  ] meeting , and is increasingly an irritant in inter-Arab relations . 
END SUMMARY ----------------------------------- PRODUCTIVE FONMIN MEETING IN [LOC KUWAIT  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Foreign Minister [PER Marwan Muasher  ] described the [LOC Iraq  ] neighboring states Foreign Ministers meeting to the Ambassador and PolCouns February 18 as “a good honest discussion.” He said that for the first time , [MISC Iraqi  ] [PER FonMin Zebari  ] had fully participated in the discussions . 
For their part , the neighboring states had told [PER Zebari  ] that , without a strong [MISC Iraqi  ] commitment to unity , [MISC Iraqi  ] federalism is a regional -- not only internal -- issue that affects the interests of neighboring states . 
Similarly , the lack of protection of minority rights in [LOC Iraq  ] could cause instability and become a regional issue as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zebari  ] responded by saying that -- speaking as a [MISC Kurd  ] -- there is no possibility of the creation of a separate [LOC Kurdistan  ] , and that [MISC Kurds  ] understand there is no support for the idea in the region . 
However , [MISC Kurds  ] have been living a semi-independent existence for twelve years , and will not be willing to give up that status completely . 
Accordingly , [PER Zebari  ] reportedly argued , [MISC Kurds  ] “need to be recognized as a special case.” [PER Zebari  ] told the group that [MISC Iraqi  ] Shia want not only to rule Shia areas of [LOC Iraq  ] , but all of [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Muasher  ] said that [PER Zebari  ] had underscored the desire of the [MISC Iraqi  ] government to cooperate closely and cement good relations with [LOC Jordan  ] , “regardless of the opposition of [PER Ahmed Chalabi.”  ] [PER Muasher  ] said he told [PER Zebari  ] that [LOC Jordan  ] , too , wanted close cooperation with [LOC Iraq  ] , but blamed [PER Chalabi  ] for spoiling deals negotiated by [ORG Jordan’s Arab Bank and Export and Finance Bank  ] with [LOC Iraq  ] banks . 
[PER Muasher  ] said he would be raising this issue with senior [ORG USG  ] officials on his upcoming trip to [LOC Washington.  ] --------------------- [LOC SYRIA  ] THE ODD MAN OUT --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In this frank and productive discussion , [PER Muasher  ] commented , “the [MISC Syrians  ] stood out like a sore thumb . 
Even the [MISC Iranians  ] were positive.” For example , [PER Muasher  ] said , [MISC Syrian  ] [PER FonMin Farouq Sharaa  ] insisted that [LOC Syria  ] would not agree to any document that referred to the November 15 agreement between the CPA and [ORG IGC  ] , “since it was not approved by all members of the [ORG Governing Council.”  ] ( [PER Muasher  ] said that [PER Zebari  ] shot back that he doubted that all policies of the [MISC Syrian  ] government were approved by all segments of [MISC Syrian  ] society . 
) During the meeting , [PER Muasher  ] said that [PER Zebari  ] had asserted -- without specifics -- that terrorist leader [PER Abu Musab  ] al-Zarqawi is “moving freely back and forth between [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , ” as are other al-Qaeda operatives . 
[PER Muasher  ] had the impression that [PER Zebari  ] might have been exaggerating a bit. ------------------------ [MISC SYRIAN  ] “STARK IGNORANCE” ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Sharaa’s behavior in [LOC Kuwait  ] , [PER Muasher  ] said , simply underscores [MISC Syria’s  ] “stark ignorance” of the [LOC U.S.  ] and the rest of the outside world . 
[PER Bashar al-Asad  ] had told King [PER Abdullah  ] on his recent visit to [LOC Damascus  ] that he was not worried about who would win the [LOC U.S.  ] presidential elections , since even a [MISC Democrat  ] could choose to keep on the senior civilian officials in the current administration . 
Similarly , [PER Sharaa  ] had told the [MISC Jordanians  ] accompanying the King a tabloid-like story that showed how out of touch with reality he is: [PER Sharaa  ] told the group that [MISC British  ] Prince [PER Charles  ] would soon be implicated in a [MISC Scottish  ] judicial investigation into [MISC Princess Diana’s  ] death , and was consequently planning a trip to [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Iran  ] “to seek the support of the [MISC Muslim  ] world.” “They just don’t get it , ” [PER Muasher  ] lamented. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Muasher  ] was enthusiastic about the frank and positive tone of the [LOC Kuwait  ] neighboring states meeting . 
However , he is focusing more and more on [LOC Syria  ] -- and [PER Farouq Sharaa  ] in particular -- as the cause of friction in inter-Arab relations and an impediment to progress. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) CPA [LOC Baghdad  ] minimize considered .
