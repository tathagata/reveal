( C//NF ) SUMMARY: [MISC Spanish  ] Interior Minister [PER Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba  ] will meet senior officials from the DHS , [ORG DOJ  ] , [ORG FBI  ] , [ORG CIA  ] , [ORG ODNI  ] , [ORG NCTC  ] , and possibly the [ORG NSC  ] , during his June 23-25 visit to [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] . 
[ORG USG  ] interlocutors will find that [PER Rubalcaba  ] - who has wide-ranging responsibilities on security , law enforcement and intelligence issues - is very capable and serious but also charming . 
A career politician , [PER Rubalcaba  ] is arguably the most impressive member of [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Zapatero  ] 's cabinet and a very useful and powerful ally to have in the [ORG Zapatero Administration  ] . 
His influence exceeds the formal parameters of his [ORG Ministry .  ] 
[ORG Embassy Madrid  ] judges the bilateral law enforcement relationship to be excellent , while the bilateral [LOC CT  ] relationship is good but could be better . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] is interested in signing either several bilateral accords or ( if the accords cannot be ironed out in time ) political declarations of intent to do so in the near future . 
The Minister has an extensive agenda - including counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) , law enforcement , and intelligence issues - he wishes to discuss with [LOC US  ] officials . 
While the focus of this trip will be on discussing bilateral issues , [PER Rubalcaba  ] also will address [ORG GOS  ] interest in increased collaboration on justice and home affairs issues during [LOC Spain  ] 's upcoming stint as President of the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) during the first half of 2010 . 
END SUMMARY. //US-SPAIN RELATIONS// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C//NF ) U.S.-Spain relations are strong and based on shared global interests . 
[LOC Spain  ] is an important friend and ally and we value its cooperation against terrorism and a range of other security issues . 
Since the [LOC US  ] presidential election in November , a strong atmosphere of goodwill has emerged in [LOC Spain  ] for closer bilateral cooperation . 
As a gesture of this goodwill , the [ORG GOS  ] presently is considering accepting some of the detainees currently held at [LOC Guantanamo  ] ( [LOC GTMO  ] , see Ref A ) . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
[LOC Spain  ] also allows us the use of two military bases that are critical transit points between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Recent irritants in bilateral relations , however , are the efforts by the [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary - invoking " universal jurisdiction " - to indict former [ORG USG  ] officials for their allegedly involvement in torture at [LOC GTMO  ] . 
( See Ref C ) . //RUBALCABA AND HIS MINISTRY// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C//NF ) A member of parliament since 1996 , [PER Rubalcaba  ] is a three-time Minister who in mid-2008 also served a brief stint as acting Defense Minister . 
He is known for his intelligence , discretion , hard work , and mastery of detail , as well as his negotiating prowess . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] was the Socialist party 's longtime pointman on [LOC CT  ] issues before [PER Zapatero  ] named him Interior Minister in early 2006 . 
He is one of two or three individuals whom [ORG Zapatero  ] often consults before making big decisions , and not only on issues within [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's portfolio . 
A senior official within the [ORG MADRID  ] 00000551 002.2 OF 003 Socialist party with a reputation for getting things done , [PER Rubalcaba  ] excels at putting out fires and is a valued contact of the [ORG Embassy  ] , which finds him accessible and effective in getting things done for us despite his busy portfolio . 
This will be [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's first meeting with most of his [ORG USG  ] interlocutors , although he first met DHS Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] in [LOC Berlin  ] for the [ORG G6  ] 1 meeting on March 15 . 
The Minister speaks [MISC English  ] but prefers to have an interpreter present for some of the more technical aspects of his official meetings. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C//NF ) The [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) oversees the [ORG Spanish National Police  ] ( [ORG SNP  ] ) and the paramilitary [ORG Civil Guard  ] ( [ORG GC  ] ) . 
The [ORG MOI  ] is a key cabinet post , as [LOC Spain  ] confronts both the domestic terrorist group [ORG Basque Fatherland and Liberty  ] ( [ORG ETA  ] ) and radical [MISC Islamist  ] terrorists and sympathizers . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's 40-year battle against [ORG ETA  ] has given its security forces - and their intelligence wings - considerable [LOC CT  ] expertise , although the [ORG GOS  ] continues to adapt its methods to combating decentralized radical [MISC Islamists  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] also faces a confluence of organized crime syndicates involved in the contraband of narcotics and other drugs , human trafficking and illegal immigration , money laundering and credit card fraud , and document falsification . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG SNP  ] and [ORG GC  ] increasingly are expanding their representation overseas as attaches in [LOC Embassies  ] . 
[ORG Embassy Madrid  ] recommends that [ORG USG  ] interlocutors press [PER Rubalcaba  ] on sending [ORG GC  ] and/or [ORG SNP  ] personnel to help train security forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C//NF ) We believe [PER Rubalcaba  ] fully understands the extent of the lack of inter-agency cooperation between the [ORG SNP  ] and the [ORG GC  ] , as well as stovepipe problems between them and [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) . 
He has overhauled the [ORG MOI  ] to achieve greater inter-agency efficiencies . 
In 2006 he created an [ORG Organized Crime Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG CICO  ] ) and in 2007 he created a [ORG National Center of Critical Infrastructure Protection  ] ( [ORG CNPIC  ] ) . 
The director of [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Center  ] for [ORG Counter-Terrorism Coordination  ] ( [ORG CNCA  ] , roughly equivalent to the [ORG NCTC  ] ) reports to [PER Rubalcaba  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXXX [PER Rubalcaba  ] has overseen a very forward-leaning [LOC CT  ] strategy against both radical [MISC Islamists  ] and - following the late 2006 car-bombing of the [LOC Madrid  ] airport , which ended its unilaterally declared cease-fire - [ORG ETA  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] prides itself that its preventative justice approach , disrupting terrorist cells before they become operational , has resulted in no deaths at the hands of radical [MISC Islamists  ] since 2004 . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] realizes he needs the [ORG USG  ] on [LOC CT  ] issues and therefore he has been cooperative with [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors on that topic. //FOUR PROSPECTIVE BILATERAL ACCORDS// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C//NF ) [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's staff tells us he hopes to sign up to four accords during his visit: I ) A US-proposed agreement on Preventing and Combating Serious Crime ( [ORG PCSC  ] ) , as discussed in Ref [LOC E. II  ] ) An agreement on Cooperation in [ORG Science & Technology  ] for [ORG Homeland Security Matters  ] , using the existing [MISC US-Mexico  ] agreement as a template . 
III ) An [ORG MOU  ] formalizing ongoing cooperation on the [ORG DHS  ] 's [ORG Immigration Advisory Program  ] ( [ORG IAP  ] ) at [LOC Madrid  ] 's [LOC Barajas Airport  ] , where a successful pilot program recently was carried out . 
IV ) An [ORG MOU  ] to strengthen bilateral cooperation and reinforce efforts to locate fugitives. //PROSPECTIVE ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION PER MEETING// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C//NF ) [PER Rubalcaba  ] hopes to sign the above accords with the [ORG DHS  ] Secretary , with whom he also will discuss protecting critical infrastructure and combating counterfeit money . 
He will discuss [ORG ETA  ] , border control issues , and the [ORG CSI  ] . 
He also will suggest the creation of an alert system regarding the theft of nuclear materials by terrorists . 
Finally , he [LOC MADRID  ] 00000551 003.2 OF 003 will propose an exchange of liaison personnel to have officials present in each others' headquarters . 
On a multilateral issues , [PER Rubalcaba  ] will address [ORG GOS  ] plans to " revitalize " the [MISC US-EU  ] transatlantic partnership during [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
This may include an embryonic idea for a joint [MISC US-EU  ] declaration on the fight against terrorism to be signed in [LOC Madrid  ] on March 11 , 2010 , the sixth anniversary of the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C//NF ) With the Attorney General and [ORG FBI  ] Director , [PER Rubalcaba  ] will discuss the prospective accord on fugitives ( See above ) . 
He also wants to discuss the [LOC CODIS  ] database , cybercrime issues , cooperation regarding [ORG ETA  ] , a proposal to intensify cooperation with the [ORG DEA  ] , and efforts to fight organized crime and money laundering . 
He also will raise the [LOC GTMO  ] detainee issue . 
[PER Rubalcaba  ] will have a role in deciding the [ORG GOS  ] decision on the [LOC GTMO  ] , based on security concerns and freedom of movement issues . 
Post recommends that [PER Rubalcaba  ] would be a logical person with whom to press the message that the various universal jurisdiction cases against former [ORG USG  ] officials are not helpful. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C//NF ) [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] is sending via other channels the proposed agenda for [PER Rubalcaba  ] 's meetings with the [ORG DNI  ] , [ORG CIA  ] and [ORG NCTC.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C//NF ) The [ORG GOS  ] has asked for an appointment with the [ORG U.S. National Security Adviser  ] , with whom [PER Rubalcaba  ] would like to discuss the [MISC US-EU  ] transatlantic agenda , a declaration of [LOC CT  ] principles ( See [PER Para  ] 9 ) , and the issue of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees . 
The Minister also would like to address radical [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism in the [LOC Af/Pak  ] region and in the [LOC Sahel.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) We suggest [LOC Washington  ] interlocutors thank [PER Rubalcaba  ] for the excellent anti-organized crime and counter-narcotics relationships we enjoy in [LOC Spain  ] and urge that we work jointly to find ways to improve the already good [LOC CT  ] relationship . 
DOJ in particular will wish to thank him for [LOC Spain  ] 's assistance in extraditing arms trafficker [PER Monzer al-Kassar  ] in <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 .
