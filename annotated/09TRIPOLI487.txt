( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] Following in the takeover of quasi-independent satellite TV station al-Libia , the Government of [LOC Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) also recently nationalized the remaining assets of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam 's [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] . 
It is hard to interpret the move as anything but the end of nominally independent media in [LOC Libya  ] and a further degradation of press freedom in a country already ranked 160th out of 173 countries worldwide by [ORG Reporters Without Borders  ] . 
Perhaps more significantly , it represents another serious blow against [MISC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , who personally established the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] two years ago , and highlights the limits of the " soft power " approach he has taken in his effort to effect political-economic reform . 
His brother and reported rival , [ORG National Security Adviser  ] Muatassim al-Qadhafi , may have helped orchestrate the timing ( and perhaps more ) of the government decree nationalizing the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] with Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , who has been at daggers drawn with [MISC Saif  ] al-Islam over the latter 's proposed reforms for over a year . 
How it all plays out remains to be seen , but in this round of jockeying in what remains a very old-school state , hard power appears to have trumped soft power . 
End summary . 
OPENING SALVO .. . 
2 . 
( C ) As reported ref A , the state-owned [ORG Jamariya Arab News Agency  ] ( [ORG JANA  ] ) satellite television channel took over the quasi-independent al-Libia satellite channel on April 24 . 
Al-Libia 's manager and the former Deputy Director of the [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] , [ORG Abdelsalam  ] al-Mishri , was arrested and remains under investigation in connection with the channel 's activities and alleged financial improprieties . 
The newspaper " [MISC Quryna  ] " featured front-page articles on April 28 attributing al-Mishri 's arrest and al-Libia 's reported efforts to move its newsroom and broadcasting to [LOC London  ] to al-Libia 's reports by sensationalist [MISC Egyptian  ] reporter [PER Hamdi Kandil  ] on [LOC Egypt  ] 's role in enforcing the blockade of [LOC Gaza  ] and ties between [LOC Egypt  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
3 . 
( C ) The seizure of al-Libia coincided with a visit to [LOC Cairo  ] by Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] to discuss bilateral trade and security issues . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] Political Counselor [PER Ahmed Abdel Halim  ] recently confirmed that [PER Ahmed Qadhafadam  ] , cousin of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi and a leading [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutor on [MISC Egyptian-Libyan  ] affairs , had brokered a call between President [PER Mubarak  ] and [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi during al-Mahmoudi and [PER Kusa  ] 's visit to complain about al-Libia 's reports on [LOC Egypt.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx Shortly thereafter , state-owned [ORG Jamahiriya TV  ] began to simulcast its programming on al-Libia 's signal. .. . 
LEADS TO A BROADER BARRAGE AGAINST PRESS FREEDOM IN [LOC LIBYA  ] 4 . 
( C ) In what [ORG Reporters Without Borders  ] described as " a retrograde measure " , [LOC Libya  ] 's state-owned media announced on June 1 that it was nationalizing the remaining assets of the [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] ( also known as the " 1/09 [ORG Media Group  ] " ) , which was established in 2007 by [MISC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi ( son of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi ) . 
Opposition website [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm posted a copy of Decree 226 of 2009 , issued by [LOC Libya  ] 's General People 's [ORG Committee  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] -- [LOC Libya  ] 's Cabinet-equivalent ) , which " liquidated " the [ORG al-Ghad Media Group  ] and established a new [ORG National Center for Media Services  ] . 
The Center , to be funded by the [ORG GPC  ] , will be " under the supervision of the [ORG GPC  ] " and will " annex " all of al-Ghad 's former assets . 
The [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] comprised al-Libia TV , al-Shabibiya TV ( focused on youth programming ) , al-Libia Radio and two daily newspapers , " [MISC Oea  ] " and " [MISC Quryna  ] " . 
The newspapers were groundbreaking in the context of [LOC Libya  ] 's sterile media environment , and had quickly established credibility and a loyal readership ( they effectively became the newspapers of record ) by publishing criticism of senior officials and discussing taboo subjects such as [MISC Islamic  ] extremism and opposition elements among [LOC Libya  ] 's diaspora population . 
( Note: While forward-leaning by local standards , coverage was largely in line with state-owned media and criticism of officials was measured and , in many cases , tepid . 
End note . 
) 5 . 
( C ) Tension between [MISC Saif  ] al-Islam 's supporters and more conservative regime elements unaccustomed to and unhappy with such coverage had increased steadily during the past year. xxxxxxxxxxxx Al-Libia 's hortatory coverage of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's recent visit to [LOC Italy  ] suggests that the channel 's content has quickly been brought into line with that of the more staid [ORG JANA  ] . 
The channel devoted much less extensive coverage to al-Qadhafi 's visits to [LOC Madrid  ] , [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Moscow  ] in 2007 and 2008 . 
Al-Libia 's coverage of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam has been reduced since the nationalization as well . 
MUATASSIM - NOT HIS BROTHER'S KEEPER ? 6 . 
( C ) The xxxxxxxxxxxx told us shortly after the nationalization was announced that they had been hearing for more than a week that it was coming . 
Their information was that [MISC Libyan  ] authorities had only been " waiting for an official decree " from the [ORG GPC  ] . 
Well-informed contacts have told us that Prime Minister al-Mahmoudi orchestrated at least the timing ( and perhaps more ) of the decree nationalizing the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] with [ORG National Security Adviser  ] Muatassim al-Qadhafi , brother and reported rival of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi . 
Al-Mahmoudi and [MISC Saif  ] al-Islam have been engaged in a mostly quiet struggle over the latter 's proposed political-economic reforms for over a year . 
A contact xxxxxxxxxxxx had been told xxxxxxxxxxxx that [PER Mubarak  ] 's call to al-Qadhafi to complain about al-Libia 's reports on [LOC Egypt  ] had afforded the regime a useful pretext to do what it had intended to do for some time anyway - nationalize the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] . 
AL-LIBIA LOOKS OFFSHORE , BUT HAVING TROUBLE FINDING A VENUE 7 . 
( C ) [PER Saleh Abdulsalam Saleh  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] 's ( [ORG QDF  ] ) [ORG Human Rights Committee  ] ( and , according to [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm , the new Director of the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] ) claimed to P/E Chief on June 17 that al-Ghad had not/not been nationalized ; however , he did confirm that al-Libia was actively looking for an alternative venue in which to house its news bureau and from which to broadcast . 
Confirming reports we 'd heard previously , he said al-Libia had narrowed the choices down to [LOC London  ] , [LOC Dubai  ] and [LOC Amman  ] and were leaning toward the latter . 
( Note: We have heard from employees of al-Libia that negotiations with the company 's potential [MISC Jordanian  ] counterpart have encountered some difficulty and that it is unlikely that al-Libia will secure approval from the [MISC Jordanian  ] Government -- which is anxious to avoid angering the [ORG GOL  ] , particularly in the wake of the [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi case ( refs C , D ) -- to broadcast from [LOC Amman  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Saleh  ] did not respond when asked to explain the interruption of al-Libia 's broadcast on April 24 and reports on June 1 ( including the text of the government decree ) that the rest of the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] had been nationalized . 
8 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Informed  ] observers here agree that it is difficult to interpret the nationalization of the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] as anything but the end of nominally independent media in [LOC Libya  ] and a serious blow against [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi . 
The annexation of al-Libia and the " [MISC Oea  ] " and " [MISC Quryna  ] " newspapers represents a further degradation of press freedom in a country already ranked 160th out of 173 countries by [ORG Reporters Without Borders  ] . 
It also comes on the heels of an unwelcome ( from [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam 's pespective ) Cabinet shuffle , the failure of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] to adopt a draft constitution he shepherded , [PER Muatassim  ] 's successful visit to [LOC Washington  ] in April ( [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam had wanted to maintain primacy on the [LOC U.S.  ] account ) , [PER Muatassim  ] 's premier role at his father 's side during the recently-concluded [LOC Rome  ] visit , and threats to [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam 's confidantes and business interests . 
His longtime business partner and adviser , [PER Abdulrahman Karfakh  ] , left [LOC Tripoli  ] quickly earlier this year after having been threatened by [PER Muatassim  ] 's confederates in connection with competition for a lucrative commercial contract . 
[PER Karfakh  ] is now in [LOC Houston  ] " training " with [LOC U.S.  ] project management company [ORG AECOM  ] , but things have not yet quieted down enough for him to return to [LOC Libya  ] . 
9 . 
( C ) Comment ( continued ) : The seizure of the [ORG al-Ghad Group  ] is a significant development in the context of the ongoing struggle for primacy between [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam and [PER Muatassim  ] , and is perceived as a signal to [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam that his open criticism of conservative regime elements had gone too far . 
It is of a piece with the view that while [PER Muatassim  ] 's star is waxing at the moment , [LOC Saif  ] 's is waning . 
Despite his high-profile involvement in the regime 's most sensitive affairs ( the [MISC Bulgarian  ] nurses , the [ORG U.S.-Libya Claims Compensation Agreement  ] , negotiations to resolve the [MISC Libyan-Swiss  ] contretemps ) , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam holds no official title and has largely depended to date on " soft power " ( the media group , the quasi-governmental [ORG QDF  ] , his [ORG Youth Forum  ] ) . 
The media group was a powerful asset that ensured that he was both the single most recognized figure in [LOC Libya  ] after his father , and was seen as an agent of the reform that many [MISC Libyans  ] quietly hunger for . 
It has been admittedly something of a mixed blessing , politically , for [MISC Saif:  ] many [MISC Libyans  ] viewed him as being too enamored of his role as a media darling , particularly since that was seen as further evidence that he was too [MISC Western  ] and less authentically [MISC Libyan  ] . 
While he has taken on conservative regime elements and eschewed a formal role , [PER Muatassim  ] has taken his position as [ORG National Security Adviser  ] and quietly aggregated more traditional " hard power " , to include involvement in the [ORG Security Committee  ] ( which coordinates sensitive security issues ) and military procurement ( his primacy in the latter has not yet been definitively determined ) . 
How it all plays out remains to be seen , but in this round of jockeying in what remains a very old-school state , hard power appears to have trumped soft power .
