( C ) [PER Poloff  ] delivered reftel points to Deputy National Security Adviser [PER Maria Jesus Alonso  ] on 1/11 , following up on recent Embassy calls on [PER Alonso  ] and other [ORG GOS  ] officials to encourage [MISC Spanish  ] participation in [MISC ISAF Stage II  ] through leadership of a PRT . 
[PER Poloff  ] stressed the importance of the issue to the [ORG USG  ] and to [ORG NATO  ] of [MISC Spanish  ] participation at a substantive level . 
[PER Poloff  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] had been confused by mixed signals regarding [LOC Spain  ] 's readiness to participating in [ORG NATO  ] expansion into western [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
On the one hand , we understood from our [ORG GOS  ] interlocutors in [LOC Madrid  ] that President [PER Zapatero  ] has made no decision regarding the scope and nature of the [MISC Spanish  ] deployment in [ORG ISAF II  ] and that [LOC Spain  ] 's new requirement of " consultations " with [ORG Parliament  ] prior to new deployments presented a further political complication . 
However , in [LOC NATO/ISAF  ] councils , [MISC Spanish  ] officials indicated a readiness to proceed with new deployments , including a possible PRT . 
Specifically , [MISC Spanish  ] officials on a recent scouting mission to [LOC Afghanistan  ] seemed prepared to support a doubling of the [MISC Spanish  ] deployment to 1,000 troops and perhaps to take on a PRT in [LOC Qaleh-ye  ] and/or the [ORG Herat FSB  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] took this to mean that [LOC Spain  ] is leaning towards leading a [MISC PRT.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Alonso  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] understood its commitment to the [ORG NATO  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and would continue to participate in that mission . 
She emphasized that the composition of [MISC Spanish  ] forces would be based primarily on the recommendations of the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG MOD  ] . 
While she hadn't yet seen the recommendations of the [MISC Spanish  ] team that visited [LOC Afghanistan  ] January 7-10 , she said their input would be important in operational terms . 
[PER Alonso  ] said she did not expect the requirement for consultations with [ORG Parliament  ] to be a problem , except with respect to timing since [ORG Parliament  ] does not reconvene until the first week in February . 
She cautioned , however , that the [ORG GOS  ] had to bear in mind public skepticism of [MISC Spanish  ] involvement in virtually any military mission , which [LOC Afghanistan  ] certainly was despite the humanitarian component . 
Also , she suggested that [LOC Spain  ] 's recent deployment to support tsunami relief operations in [LOC Indonesia  ] ( 594 troops , five airplanes , two helicopters , a medical unit , and several ships ) had stretched [MISC Spanish  ] manpower and resources , which might present a problem [ORG GOS  ] planners hadn't forseen with repect to the [ORG GOS  ] contribution to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The mission in [LOC Indonesia  ] is currently expected to last two months. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Poloff  ] also delivered reftel points to [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director General for Foreign Policy [PER Felix Costales  ] and noted our confusion regarding [LOC Spain  ] 's position on leading a PRT . 
[PER Costales  ] said that a PRT would be a very new type of project for the [ORG GOS  ] and that there were ongoing internal discussions regarding the composition of a [MISC Spanish-led  ] PRT . 
Most importantly , [LOC Spain  ] did not want a primarily military PRT such as those led by the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC UK  ] , but instead wanted to emphasize the humanitarian aspect of such a mission . 
Like [PER Alonso  ] , [PER Costales  ] noted that [LOC Spain  ] 's delivery of aid and assistance to victims of the tsunami disaster presented a possible complication for [LOC Spain  ] 's contribution to [ORG ISAF Stage II.  ] //COMMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We have heavily lobbied the [ORG GOS  ] at all levels of the [ORG MOD  ] , [ORG MFA  ] , and the President 's staff to lead a PRT and/or other important missions in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
General [PER B. B. Bell  ] made a strong pitch to [MISC Spanish  ] officers on the margins of a 1/10 visit to his [ORG NATO  ] counterpart in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
While the [ORG GOS  ] military is clearly anxious to take on a larger role , their political leaders are far more cautious . 
In a recent meeting with Charge , National Security Adviser equivalent [PER Carles Casajuana  ] was adamant that no new [MISC Spanish  ] deployment could move forward without Parliamentary approval . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's contribution to tsunami relief operations is a new twist and could tempt the [ORG GOS  ] to further delay a tough decision on its participation in [ORG ISAF II  ] . 
We will continue to push the [ORG GOS  ] hard on this issue , but recognize that their strong aversion to operations that could result in military casualties is a very significant impediment . 
[PER Zapatero  ] 's officials are well aware that the popularity of his government is based mainly on his reversal of former President [PER Aznar  ] 's unpopular decision to deploy [MISC Spanish  ] forces to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] does not want to give the opposition a similar opportunity .
