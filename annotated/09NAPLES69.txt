REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: As  ] host to an important [LOC U.S.  ] Navy base , location of recently discovered gas reserves , and home to 17,000 [LOC U.S.  ] citizens , [LOC Sicily  ] 's future is clearly of interest to the [LOC United States  ] . 
For now , political feuding has replaced the war on organized crime in the headlines: Regional President [PER Raffaele Lombardo  ] dissolved the regional cabinet on May 25 after months of tensions with his coalition partner , Prime Minister [PER Berlusconi  ] 's party . 
The rocky relations between [LOC Palermo  ] and [LOC Rome  ] have resulted in [PER Berlusconi  ] 's blockage of four billion euros in [LOC EU  ] structural funds for the region . 
Political grandstanding blocked an [MISC American  ] gas drilling operation last year , and threatens to at least delay an important [LOC U.S.  ] Navy satellite communications system . 
However , the major challenge to economic development remains the Mafia , which may well be the principal beneficiary if the bridge over the [ORG Strait of Messina  ] , talked about for centuries , is eventually built . 
A variety of interlocutors in several [MISC Sicilian  ] cities told us during recent visits that the grip of organized crime has loosened through a combination of law enforcement success and civil society rebellion against the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] . 
Anti-Mafia prosecutors are optimistic they can continue to make progress against the mob , but note that ongoing budgetary and personnel constraints ( particularly the difficulty in filling magistrate positions ) hamper their effectiveness . 
The one exception we have heard to the optimistic outlook is from a journalist under police protection from the mob , who believes that most anti-Mafia measures have been superficial and have not taken root in society . 
End summary . 
Crossroads of the [MISC Mediterranean  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Sicily  ] -- the largest island in the [MISC Mediterranean  ] and [LOC Italy  ] 's fourth-most populous region -- is in some ways a world unto itself . 
At a strategic maritime crossroads , throughout history it has been conquered and occupied by virtually every [MISC Mediterranean  ] power . 
Its geographical position may have contributed to a historical sense of psychological separation from mainland [LOC Italy  ] , manifested today in a thriving local dialect and the homegrown political party that now holds the power in the regional government , the [ORG Movement for Autonomies  ] ( [ORG MPA  ] ) . 
It is also the region in our consular district that has seen the most success in battling organized crime ( reftel A ) , with numerous arrests of high-level mobsters in the last 16 years and a growing number of anti-extortion [ORG NGOs  ] making headlines . 
[LOC Sicily  ] also has the highest official unemployment rate and highest poverty rate of any [MISC Italian  ] region . 
Its importance to the [LOC United States  ] is clear: [LOC Sicily  ] hosts the [LOC U.S.  ] Navy 's [ORG Sigonella Naval Air Station  ] ( the second-busiest military air station in [LOC Europe  ] ) ; several [MISC American  ] companies have substantial direct investments there , including [ORG IBM  ] , [ORG Wyeth  ] and [ORG Exxon-Mobil  ] ; and the region hosts large natural gas deposits . 
Prosecutors Understaffed and Underfunded --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) During two recent ConGen 2009 visits to [LOC Sicily  ] , anti-Mafia prosecutors in [LOC Palermo  ] , [LOC Caltanissetta  ] and [LOC Trapani  ] -- three of the four anti-Mafia judicial districts in the region -- told us they are optimistic that they are winning the battle against organized crime . 
Without exception , they praised cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement , noting that there are still strong ties between the [MISC Sicilian  ] [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] and [MISC American  ] organized crime groups . 
[PER Antonio Ingroia  ] , a prosecutor in [LOC Palermo  ] , noted happily that [MISC Sicilian  ] schools are now conducting anti-Mafia awareness programs , and anti-extortion movements ( such as the [ORG Industrialists Confederation  ] and the [ORG NGO  ] " [PER Addio Pizzo  ] " -- see ref A ) are having a positive effect . 
Nonetheless , all is not rosy: like their colleagues in other parts of southern [LOC Italy  ] , the prosecutors complained that they are understaffed and underfunded . 
Indeed , over a quarter of the anti-Mafia magistrate positions are vacant in [LOC Palermo  ] , and only three of seven positions are filled in [LOC Caltanissetta  ] . 
[LOC Palermo  ] 's [LOC Prosecutor-in-Chief  ] , [PER Francesco Messineo  ] , told the [LOC CG  ] that 14 of 64 overall prosecutor positions ( not just anti-Mafia ) there are [ORG NAPLES  ] 00000069 002.2 OF 005 unfilled , and the understaffing is likely to continue for at least four years . 
[PER Ingroia  ] opined that his team had been a victim of its own success ; the central government , believing the [MISC Sicilian  ] Mafia to be reeling from so many arrests , has cut the budget for investigators there . 
[PER Sergio Lari  ] , the chief anti-Mafia prosecutor in [LOC Caltanissetta  ] , noted that investigators have to " beg for gasoline " for official vehicles . 
Prosecutors are also deeply concerned over GOI proposals to limit wiretapping , which they feel is one of their most important weapons in the fight against organized crime . 
Reasons to be Optimistic.... -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Sicilian  ] Mafia 's principal activities are drug trafficking , extortion , rigging of public contracts and trafficking in persons , though the mob has also invested heavily in legal enterprises in the construction and food industries , and more recently , wind energy . 
In recent years , law enforcement authorities have shifted their focus from merely arresting mobsters to also seizing their assets -- a strategy described by all our contacts as a powerful tool . 
However , local politicians complain that the average time to convert seized assets into legitimate uses is fifteen years ; last November at the opening of a rural hotel and restaurant in a former Mafia villa , Interior Minister [LOC Maroni  ] pledged to introduce legislation to streamline the process . 
The [LOC Palermo  ] anti-Mafia prosecutors group now has a special unit dedicated to investigating economic and financial crimes ; if successful , this experimental unit may be replicated in other parts of the country . 
In addition to asset seizures , investigators spend more time than ever following money-laundering trails , which used to be local but are now international . 
[ORG Palermo Chief Prosecutor  ] [PER Messineo  ] asserted that with the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] 's leadership behind bars , the organization 's economic troubles are such that it is having difficulty making support payments to family members. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A young anti-Mafia activist , [PER Andrea Cottone  ] , told us in [LOC Palermo  ] that a bolder generation is coming of age in [LOC Sicily  ] . 
The spectacular public assassinations of two anti-Mafia prosecutors in 1992 left their imprint on those who were then children and are now young adults . 
[PER Cottone  ] firmly believes that this generation will lead the societal rebellion against extortion . 
Democratic Party ( center-left ) national Senator [PER Beppe Lumia  ] , who sits on the parliamentary Anti-Mafia Committee , asserted that the state is winning the " military " war against the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] , but had to do a better job on the political and economic fronts . 
He , too , was heartened by civil society movements against organized crime . 
Chief Prosecutor [PER Messineo  ] reported that there have been no verified mob-related killings in [LOC Palermo  ] in two years , in contrast to the long-time average of 60 or 70 per year. ....But Not [MISC Over-Optimistic  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Other interlocutors cautioned against over-optimistic assessments . 
[PER Pietro Vento  ] , the director of [LOC Demopolis  ] , [LOC Sicily  ] 's best-known polling organization , reported to us that 80 percent of [MISC Sicilian  ] businesses still pay extortion , and only a handful of businesses owners are actually standing up to the Mafia . 
( He said that most businesses that do not pay do so because they are not asked for the " pizzo " not out of a brave act of refusal . 
) [ORG Trapani Chief Prosecutor  ] Giacomo [PER Bodero Maccabeo  ] told the [LOC CG  ] that the environment of " unemployment , fear and ignorance " provided ample breeding ground for organized crime . 
According to [PER Maccabeo  ] , [LOC Trapani  ] 's cement and concrete industries are dominated by the Mafia , and he had personally ordered the seizure of sixteen production plants . 
He told the [LOC CG  ] that organized crime tries to rig all public works contracts , and that the mob has a virtual monopoly on what little employment there is in the area . 
[PER Lirio Abbate  ] , a [LOC Palermo  ] journalist who has exposed mob activities and lives under police escort after authorities uncovered a plot to kill him , was even more downbeat . 
[PER Abbate  ] is convinced that the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] is not in [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000069 003.2 OF 005 decline , and asserted that the civil society rebellion is actually very small and has little effect . 
As an example , he cited the regional [ORG Industrialists Confederation  ] , which in September 2007 adopted a highly publicized policy to expel members who pay extortion . 
[PER Abbate  ] stated that , despite announcements to the contrary , the [ORG Confederation  ] has not expelled a single member , even though it has evidence that many of its members are cooperating with the Mafia . 
He added that acts of arson against non-payers are almost daily events , but receive little publicity . 
[PER Abbate  ] also railed against corruption in [MISC Sicilian  ] politics , accusing all political parties of having ties to organized crime , an observation echoed by the prosecutors in [LOC Caltanissetta  ] . 
They told us that although the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] controls a relatively small percentage of votes , it is enough to tip elections in favor of their preferred candidates in most cases . 
In January 2008 , then-regional president [PER Salvatore Cuffaro  ] was convicted of aiding the Mafia and sentenced to five years in prison ; he was also barred for life from holding public office ( ref B ) . 
[PER Cuffaro  ] promptly appealed , after a much-publicized " celebration " with a tray of cannoli , and while waiting for the decision ( still pending , a year-and-a-half later ) , won election to the national [ORG Senate  ] . 
Political Turmoil -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Cuffaro  ] 's successor is the [MISC Catania-born  ] founder of the [ORG Movement for Autonomy  ] ( [ORG MPA  ] ) , [PER Raffaele Lombardo  ] , whom several contacts described as a conventional politician who effectively doles out patronage for support . 
The [ORG MPA  ] , founded in 2005 , seeks to give [LOC Italy  ] 's regions greater autonomy , and in particular to " restore " to [LOC Sicily  ] and the [LOC South  ] their " guiding role " for the [MISC Mediterranean  ] countries . 
[PER Lombardo  ] -- who sees himself as the [LOC South  ] 's counterpart to the [MISC Northern League  ] 's [PER Umberto Bossi  ] -- allegedly wants to expand his sphere of influence by founding a new party called the [ORG Party of the South  ] ( [ORG PDS  ] ) , but is unlikely to find support from other southern regions . 
[PER Lombardo  ] came to power in coalition with the [ORG PDL  ] , but the lack of any common ideology or interests quickly led to an open breach between them . 
The [ORG MPA  ] has openly opposed [LOC Rome  ] 's anti-immigration policies ( refs C-D ) , and is currently holding up the installation of a GOI-approved [LOC U.S.  ] Navy satellite communications system near the town of [LOC Niscemi  ] . 
The latter was opposed by a group of local mayors , who have successfully used local media to spread conjectures -- unsupported even by scientists brought in by the mayors as experts -- that the installation poses grave environmental health risks to the local population . 
( Note: [LOC U.S.  ] Navy studies , which have been validated by the [MISC Italian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , make clear that the electromagnetic emissions of the proposed antennae fall well below [MISC Italian  ] and [ORG EU  ] limits . 
End note . 
) [LOC Sicily  ] 's regional minister for environment has delayed granting approval to operate pending further environmental impact analysis , but the Consulate continues to press for resolution . 
The disinformation campaign by the local mayors parallels a successful campaign a year ago to block natural gas drilling by [ORG Texas-based Panther Eureka Gas  ] in the province of [LOC Ragusa  ] , after the regional government had initially approved the environmental impact assessment and granted an exploration license . 
Local mayors blocked drilling through a series of unsubstantiated but successful court suits , alleging the drilling would damage the area 's cultural heritage ; as a result [ORG Panther  ] has all but stopped operations after the delays cost the company hundreds of thousands of euros. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Lombardo  ] 's [MISC Sicily-first  ] approach means he has little time for foreign officials ; in his previous position as President of the [ORG Province of Catania  ] he granted the [ORG CG  ] a five-minute courtesy call , and as President of the [LOC Region  ] has declined to receive either Ambassador [PER Spogli  ] or the current Charge on trips to [LOC Palermo  ] , to the chagrin of his staff . 
The feud between [PER Lombardo  ] and the [ORG PDL  ] is also fueled by personality clashes between [PER Lombardo  ] and [MISC Italian  ] [ORG Senate  ] President [PER Renato Schifani  ] , Justice Minister [PER Angelino Alfano  ] , and [ORG Regional Assembly  ] President [PER Francesco Cascio  ] ( all [ORG PDL  ] ) . 
On May 25 , two weeks before elections for the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] , [PER Lombardo  ] [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000069 004.2 OF 005 dissolved his cabinet ; according to press reports , the move came in reaction to an interview by [PER Berlusconi  ] with local [MISC Sicilian  ] television indicating that four billion euros in structural funds for the region , which have been blocked in [LOC Rome  ] for five months , would only be delivered when it is certain they will be spent for structural improvements and not current expenses . 
A concurrent strike by [LOC Palermo  ] garbage collectors added to the political turmoil ; several people were arrested in early June for setting fire to the mounds of trash piled up on the city streets , and [PER Berlusconi  ] dispatched his top emergency official to the area to try to prevent a health emergency . 
The [MISC Demopolis  ] pollster [PER Vento  ] told us that despite the bad blood between [ORG MPA  ] and [ORG PDL  ] , both parties will continue to garner strong support at the expense of the center-left . 
[PER Lombardo  ] is expected to patch up his differences with [PER Berlusconi  ] in the near future now that the elections for the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] , in which [PER Lombardo  ] 's [ORG MPA  ] ran in coalition with several minor parties. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Not all of [LOC Sicily  ] 's politicians are embroiled in controversy , and some have publicly stood up to the Mafia . 
The mayor of the mob-controlled town of [LOC Gela  ] ( and successful PD candidate for the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] ) is under police protection after Prosecutor [PER Lari  ] 's team discovered a [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] assassination plot . 
[PER Antonino Iannazzo  ] , the [ORG PDL  ] mayor of [LOC Corleone  ] , a town whose name is synonymous with the Mafia , is also working to eradicate the scourge of organized crime . 
He told us that law enforcement authorities have had tremendous success in recent years against the infamous [MISC Corleonese  ] mob , to the astonishment of older residents who had insisted that change was impossible . 
[PER Iannazzo  ] tirelessly promotes law and order in his territory , and has formed a consortium with nearby municipalities to make the best use of property confiscated from the Mafia . 
Homes formerly belonging to captured mob bosses [PER Toto Riina  ] and [PER Bernardo Provenzano  ] are being used as recreation centers for youth and disabled people , and another property is now a cooperative producing " [MISC Mafia-free  ] " wine . 
[PER Iannazzo  ] is overseeing the implementation of one of his own ideas -- the conversion of a former mob boss 's home into a " Museum of Legality , " due to open in Fall 2009 . 
He also claims to be very meticulous in excluding mafiosi or those paying extortion from bidding on public contracts . 
[MISC Catania: The Wild East  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In [LOC Sicily  ] 's second-biggest city and busiest commercial center ( as well as the city closest to the [ORG USN  ] 's [ORG Sigonella Naval Air Station  ] ) , [LOC Catania  ] , the provincial [ORG Treasury Police  ] commander , General [PER Ignazio Gibilaro  ] , told us that organized crime continues to thrive on the eastern side of the island . 
[LOC Catania  ] is a final destination for narcotics ( which , he noted , are trafficked into [LOC Italy  ] by the 'Ndrangheta across the strait in [LOC Calabria  ] and distributed in [LOC Catania  ] by the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] ) , weapons and contraband . 
General [PER Gibilaro  ] noted that the Mafia is less hierarchical in [LOC Catania  ] than in the rest of the region , and thus gang wars between different mob factions are commonplace his district , and weapons have become more potent and prevalent in recent years . 
Fraud , rigging of public contracts and money laundering are also lucrative activities in [LOC Catania  ] . 
In fact , crime has increased so much that the [ORG Treasury Police  ] decided to upgrade the rank of the provincial commander position to general from colonel ( [PER Gibilaro  ] , recently arrived , is the first general to oversee the province ) . 
The [ORG Treasury Police  ] also have a full-time dedicated task force to protect intellectual property rights ; in the past year , this group has been among the most active and most successful in southern [LOC Italy  ] in confiscating pirated and counterfeit products , a large proportion of which are [MISC American  ] brands of clothing and shoes . 
The Bridge to More Organized Crime -------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Berlusconi  ] has announced his intention to revive the long-talked-about bridge over the [ORG Strait  ] of [LOC Messina  ] as a major public works project to create jobs and improve [LOC Sicily  ] 's infrastructure . 
Although polls indicate that the project enjoys [LOC NAPLES  ] 00000069 005.2 OF 005 widespread support both in [LOC Calabria  ] and [LOC Sicily  ] , there is enormous concern that the contracts and sub-contracts will end up enriching the [MISC Mafias  ] on both sides of the [ORG Strait  ] . 
The prefect of [LOC Reggio Calabria  ] recently told the [ORG CG  ] that the bidding process would have to be " armored , " but that it could be kept perfectly clean . 
However , the prefect of [LOC Messina  ] acknowledged that the bridge , which is supposed to link " insular " [LOC Sicily  ] to the " developed " mainland , could end up having the counter-productive effect of bringing [LOC Sicily  ] , which has comparatively done a better job of tackling organized crime than [LOC Calabria  ] , physically and psychologically closer to the `Ndrangheta , [LOC Europe  ] 's most dangerous organized crime syndicate . 
Given the endless delays which have plagued construction of the [ORG Salerno-Reggio Calabria  ] highway , still unfinished after several decades , the bridge over the [ORG Strait  ] is not going to be constructed anytime soon , and will serve little purpose without massive investments in road and rail infrastructure in both [LOC Sicily  ] and [LOC Calabria  ] , both of which are substandard. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Comment: The law enforcement success in recent years against the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] has been crucial to [LOC Sicily  ] 's undeniable progress . 
Twenty years ago , politicians would never have dared stand up to the Mafia -- their chances of being assassinated would have been far greater than their chances of being elected . 
The ability of anti-Mafia activists to open " extortion-free " businesses in [LOC Sicily  ] and the existence of a public debate over how to defeat organized crime are clear signs that [MISC Sicilian  ] society is changing . 
The situation has improved , but it is evident that the [ORG Cosa Nostra  ] is far from defeated , and in places such as [ORG Trapani  ] still has a stranglehold on the local society . 
In addition to organized crime , [LOC Sicily  ] suffers from the same problems as the rest of [LOC Italy  ] 's [MISC South:  ] bad government , crooked politicians , relatively little industry , and a brain drain as university graduates leave to seek employment in greener pastures . 
[LOC Sicily  ] has made progress in many ways in recent years , but the change is plainly more of an evolution than a revolution . 
All in all , we tend to side with the optimists , and believe that it is in USG interest to actively support civil society initiatives against organized crime and to press the GOI to expand funding for anti-Mafia investigations and prosecutions .
