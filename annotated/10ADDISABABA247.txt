( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: The Government of Ethiopia  ] 's ( [ORG GoE  ] ) recent high profile land deals and shift in agricultural policy ( reftel ) have attracted additional foreign investors to the agricultural and tourism sectors . 
In January , [MISC Egyptian  ] Prime Minster Dr. [PER Ahmed Nazif  ] led a large delegation to [LOC Ethiopia  ] to announce the [ORG National Bank of Egypt  ] 's lease of 49,400 acres of land to grow cereals . 
Press reports indicated that these cereals are headed for export to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Former [MISC Nigerian  ] President [PER Olusegun Obasanjo  ] and [MISC Djiboutian  ] President [PER Ismael Omar Guelleh  ] separately leased land plots to build hotels outside of [LOC Addis Ababa  ] , while [PER Guelleh  ] already leases a 7,400 acre farm that started exporting wheat back to [LOC Djibouti  ] last year . 
Finally , the [MISC South African  ] private equity investment fund Agri-Vie invested [MISC USD  ] 3.5 million in a company that is growing and processing various fruits to manufacture juice products . 
These juice products will primarily target the [MISC European  ] and the [MISC Middle Eastern  ] markets as reported by the company to [PER Econoff  ] . 
Despite the benefits of increased foreign investment , political opposition members and international critics remain skeptical about the [ORG GoE  ] 's motives and the land policy 's affect on poor , rural [MISC Ethiopians  ] . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Egyptians Eye Investment Opportunities  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The [MISC Egyptian  ] Prime Minister , Dr. [PER Ahmed Nazif  ] , led the latest charge of foreign agricultural investment during a January visit to [LOC Ethiopia  ] . 
[PER Nazif  ] , alongside his delegation of several cabinet ministers and 26 agricultural companies , announced that the state-owned [ORG National Bank of Egypt  ] plans to invest [MISC USD  ] 40 million in the lease of 49,400 acres of land in the [LOC Afar  ] region to grow cereals . 
Press reports stated that these cereals would be exported to [LOC Egypt  ] despite the [ORG GoE  ] 's 2007 " temporary " export ban on all cereals that has never been formally lifted . 
( Note: It appears [MISC Saudi  ] , [MISC Djiboutian  ] , and now [MISC Egyptian  ] investors have somehow bypassed this ban , while other investors informed [PER Econoff  ] that they have not been allowed to export cereal grains ( reftel ) . 
End Note . 
) The bank is also poised to open an office in [LOC Ethiopia  ] to serve existing and new [MISC Egyptian  ] projects and plans to offer credit of [MISC USD  ] 14.6 million to six [MISC Ethiopian  ] banks according to local press reports . 
( Note: the domestic banking sector is closed to foreign banks ; however , other foreign banks such as [LOC Germany  ] 's [ORG Commerzbank  ] do have offices in [LOC Ethiopia  ] to facilitate relations with [MISC Ethiopian  ] banks . 
It is unclear how the [ORG National Bank of Egypt  ] could offer credit in [LOC Ethiopia  ] in evident violation of banking and financial regulations . 
End Note . 
) Beyond the focus on agriculture , [PER Nazif  ] signed a memorandum of understanding with [ORG GoE  ] Prime Minister [PER Meles Zenawi  ] to form an [ORG Ethio-Egypt Council of Commerce  ] . 
[PER Meles  ] said during the signing ceremony that relations between [LOC Ethiopia  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] had evolved from distrust towards friendly cooperation . 
Other areas of [MISC Egyptian  ] business interest included livestock , drug manufacturing , and hydroelectric power . 
Former [MISC Nigerian  ] President and [MISC Djiboutian  ] President Also Invest --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Another foreign VIP seen around town and looking for land was the former president of [LOC Nigeria  ] , [PER Olusegun Obasanjo  ] . 
[PER Obasanjo  ] recently leased about five acres of land near [LOC Debrezeit  ] , [LOC Oromia  ] region ( about 50 kilometers east of [LOC Addis Ababa  ] ) to develop a hotel and tourist destination . 
In addition , current [MISC Djiboutian  ] President [PER Ismael Omar Guelleh  ] recently acquired the right to develop about 2.5 acres of lakeside land in [LOC Debrezeit  ] to build a hotel . 
This acquisition added to the 7,400 acres of farmland [PER Guelleh  ] leased last year in [LOC Bale  ] , [LOC Oromia  ] region . 
According to post 's conversations with local agricultural business investors and press reports , this farm has already harvested wheat and other cereals for export to [LOC Djibouti  ] . 
Private Equity Fund Invests in [LOC Fruit Juice Farm  ] --------------------------------------------- -- [ORG ADDIS ABAB  ] 00000247 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [MISC South African  ] private equity fund Agri-Vie has also chosen to invest in [LOC Ethiopia  ] 's agricultural sector . 
The fund invested [MISC USD  ] 3.5 million in africaJUICE , a company already in the process of establishing fruit production and processing operations when [PER Econoff  ] visited its 3,000 acre operation last year . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC British  ] company representatives reported to [PER Econoff  ] that it plans to target the juice markets in [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
The company purchased this farm ( not the land ) from the [ORG GoE  ] and converted it to produce yellow passion fruit , mango , and papaya . 
Critics Concerned About [MISC Rural Population  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) As more reports of foreign land leases in [LOC Ethiopia  ] surface , the [ORG GoE  ] continues to insist local farmers will not be adversely affected by its land deals . 
Regarding agricultural investment , the [ORG GoE  ] views foreign investor involvement as key to the country 's move from subsistence to commercial farming ( reftel ) . 
On top of any potential damage to local farmers , international and political opposition party critics cite concerns over exporting food from a country that relies so heavily on imported food aid and the perceived low wages that foreign investors pay its employees . 
[PER Merara Gudina  ] , Chairman of the [MISC Ethiopian  ] [ORG Federal Democratic Unity Forum  ] ( a coalition of political opposition parties ) , accused the [ORG GoE  ] of using its land " giveaway " policy to hold on to power and to buy diplomatic support . 
[MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG GoE  ] opposition movement [ORG Ginbot  ] 7 stated in a January editorial that the [ORG GoE  ] needs to change its communist land policy and empower local farmers , who have the potential to produce a marketable surplus . 
The editorial further noted that any land deal that has not been agreed to by the [MISC Ethiopian  ] people will not be honored by future elected governments . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GoE  ] clearly needed to shift its agricultural policy in order to make effective use of its vast amounts of fertile land , and the agricultural policy mix being implemented is viewed by most experts as a step in the right direction . 
However , that evolving policy is a long way from proving its worth as a vehicle for achieving the [ORG GoE  ] 's stated goals of modernizing the sector , generating foreign exchange reserves , and increasing the domestic food supply .
