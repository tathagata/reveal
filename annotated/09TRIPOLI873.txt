End Summary . 
REBEL UNIFICATION: SAME CUSHION , DIFFERENT DREAMS 2 . 
( C ) In an October 8 meeting with Special Envoy [PER Gration  ] , Brigadier General [PER Abdulla Sanussi  ] ( and close [PER Qadhafi  ] confidant ) said [LOC Libya  ] had no special agenda or competitive spirit on resolving the [LOC Sudan  ] crisis , pledging [LOC Libya  ] 's continued and unlimited cooperation with the SE 's initiatives in [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[PER Sanussi  ] agreed that the international community should continue to entice factions of the [ORG Sudan Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG SLA  ] ) to seek unification in preparation for negotiations with the Government of [LOC Sudan  ] in [LOC Doha  ] and expressed appreciation for the [ORG USG  ] 's attention and seriousness in resolving the [LOC Darfur  ] conflict . 
[PER Sanussi  ] viewed unification efforts as complicated by unreasonable , intractable demands of certain rebel leaders bent on spoiling the process for personal gain . 
The leaders , he said , reminded him of a [MISC Chinese  ] proverb: though the faction leaders all slept on the same cushion , they all had different dreams . 
3 . 
( C ) While the [MISC Libyan  ] Government had facilitated travel and visas for members of the " [ORG Addis  ] group " of [ORG SLA  ] factions to come to [LOC Tripoli  ] for unification talks with the " [LOC Tripoli  ] group , " [PER Sanussi  ] complained that several leaders had no interest in [LOC Darfur  ] and knew nothing of the situation on the ground there . 
Saying [LOC Libya  ] 's chief concerns were the humanitarian and security situation for IDPs and civilians , he derided rebel leaders who " don't feel [ that ] pain " after years of being ferried from capital to capital hosted in luxury hotels as various mediators attempted to unify the factions . 
[PER Sanussi  ] urged [PER Gration  ] to listen to the demands made by the rebels and filter out the unreasonable and impractical ones . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] " FED UP " WITH REBEL SPOILERS 4 . 
( C ) [PER Sanussi  ] said [LOC Libya  ] was " fed up " after years of attempting to mediate between the various factions , particularly since the " legitimate " factions had few differences between them . 
In his view , some leaders had vested political interests in maintaining conflict in [LOC Darfur  ] . 
[PER Ahmed Abdel Shafie  ] , for example , held the rank of colonel in the [MISC Southern Sudanese  ] army and supported continued fighting in [LOC Darfur  ] as it distracted [LOC Khartoum  ] from its conflict with [PER Juba  ] . 
[PER Shafie  ] , he said , carried no weight tribally , militarily , or politically and should be cut out of the unification process to prevent him from becoming a spoiler . 
[PER Sanussi  ] called [PER Shafie  ] an untrustworthy , unreliable interlocutor who had reneged on every promise he had ever made to [PER Sanussi  ] . 
Saying , " I have helped him a lot , " [PER Sanussi  ] suggested [PER Shafie  ] was the [ORG GOSS  ] 's problem and not the international community 's . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER Sanussi  ] contended that that the [LOC South  ] had " paved the way for [LOC Darfur  ] " , with [PER John Garang  ] having visited [LOC Darfur  ] 7-10 times in the early 2000s . 
Claiming a strong relationship with [PER Garang  ] from 1985 until his death in 2005 , [PER Sanussi  ] said " I trained his troops and ferried him his equipment . 
" [PER Sanussi  ] commented that , while [LOC Libya  ] thought [LOC Southern Sudan  ] was on track to enter the world as a failed state , [LOC Libya  ] nevertheless supported the principle of self-determination and would continue to invest in [LOC Southern Sudan  ] regardless of which way the vote went . 
UNIFICATION CHALLENGES: [ORG JEM  ] , [PER SHAFIE  ] , [ORG LOCATION  ] 6 . 
( C ) In [PER Sanussi  ] 's view , unification was needed to cool the tensions in [LOC Darfur  ] and in the ongoing [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] conflict . 
[LOC Khartoum  ] was eager to find excuses to continue fighting , recently claiming [MISC Chadian  ] President [PER Idriss Deby  ] had personally overseen the movement of 286 military vehicles to the border -- a claim that both [PER Gration  ] and [PER Sanussi  ] said was debunked by their governments . 
[PER Gration  ] and [PER Sanussi  ] agreed that [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] 's [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Equality Movement  ] ( [ORG JEM  ] ) was a wildcard in [ORG SLA  ] unification efforts , with [PER Gration  ] noting that [PER Khalil  ] 's national political agenda could derail [ORG SLA  ] unification and the [LOC Doha  ] [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000873 002.2 OF 002 process . 
7 . 
( C ) Although recent signals from [LOC Khartoum  ] and [LOC N'Djamena  ] may indicate an opening that would allow for a negotiated peace between the states and the rebels , [PER Gration  ] said that opening would not remain in place long . 
Rebel unification had a good opportunity for success if it could be effected in October , prior to the resumption of the [LOC Doha  ] process . 
[PER Sanussi  ] suggested that the international community , along with [ORG UN/AU Special Mediator Bassole  ] and [MISC Qatari  ] [ORG Minister of State  ] al-Mahmoud , should tell the [ORG SLA  ] factions that only a unified group would be welcome to negotiate in [LOC Doha  ] . 
[PER Gration  ] agreed , but cautioned that mediators needed to take care not to force groups into agreements and alliances that were not supported by [ORG Darfuris  ] and commanders in the field . 
He added that the " [ORG Addis  ] group " had agreed to a roadmap whereby a unification conference would take place in the field in [LOC Darfur  ] but getting agreement in principle from the [MISC Tripoli-based  ] factions would be essential to launching the initiative as soon as possible . 
8 . 
( C ) [PER Sanussi  ] doubted that some of the assembled rebels would agree to a conference in [LOC Darfur  ] , saying " it will be easier for [MISC Jesus Christ  ] himself to come back than for [PER Abdel Shafie  ] to go to [LOC Darfur  ] . 
" [PER Sanussi  ] noted that security concerns and the fact that the true strength of certain supporter-less " movements " would be revealed in a field-based conference made such a conference virtually impossible . 
Nonetheless , [PER Sanussi  ] said he saw the reason behind the initiative and agreed that it was important to have field commanders , civil society representatives , and faction leaders all in one location . 
[PER Sanussi  ] offered [LOC Kufra  ] -- a [MISC Libyan  ] oasis town approximately 600 miles southwest of [LOC Benghazi  ] -- as an alternate site that was secure , with facilities to house the various actors , and relatively close to field commanders and civil society leaders . 
SE Gration thanked [PER Sanussi  ] for the offer and agreed to support a [LOC Kufra  ] conference if rebel leaders would accept it as an alternative .
