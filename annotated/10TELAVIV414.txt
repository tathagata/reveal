[PER Baidatz  ] explained that [ORG IDI  ] viewed completion of such a transfer as creating a “new level of concern” along [MISC Israel’s  ] northern border , and he requested that the USG demarche the [MISC Syrian  ] government in an attempt to dissuade them from transferring the missiles . 
[PER Baidatz  ] requested that any demarche be delivered prior to the February 25 arrival in [LOC Washington  ] of [MISC Israeli  ] Defense Minister [PER Ehud Barak  ] . 
[PER Baidatz  ] was concerned that a demarche following Barak’s meeting in [LOC Washington  ] would lead the [MISC Syrians  ] to believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Israel  ] collaborated to uncover and thwart the transfer. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 .
