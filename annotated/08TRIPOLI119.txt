REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( S ) Per ref A , post has been working with the General People 's Committee for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( MFA-equivalent ) to coordinate ISN DAS Mahley 's proposed visit to [LOC Libya  ] February 17-20 , in conjunction with a parallel visit by a [LOC U.K.  ] team , to discuss chemical weapons-related issues , including modification of the [LOC Rabta  ] plant conversion proposal , and missile issues related to replacement of [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC SCUD-B  ] missile force . 
2 . 
( S ) As reported ref B , post received a diplomatic note February 12 indicating the [ORG GOL  ] 's position that tri-lateral [MISC U.S.-U.K.-Libya  ] talks undertaken during the visit be restricted to chemical weapons issues and not/not include discussions of missile issues . 
[ORG MFA Americas Desk  ] Director [PER Muhammad Matari  ] subsequently called P/E Chief Feb 13 and said that MFA Secretary for [ORG European Affairs  ] [PER Abdulati Obeidi  ] had instructed that the proposed visit to the [LOC Rabta  ] site ( which was to include [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC U.K.  ] , [MISC Italian  ] , [MISC French  ] and [MISC Russian  ] representatives ) and related trilateral [MISC U.S.-U.K.-Libya  ] talks be postponed altogether . 
Conveying points from [PER Obeidi  ] , [PER Matari  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] 's initial proposal had been for a site visit to [LOC Rabta  ] ; the [ORG GOL  ] was " not ready " for discussions on other issues and preferred that DAS Mahley 's be postponed . 
Post subsequently received a diplomatic note formally conveying the [ORG GOL  ] 's points ( text below at para 5 ) . 
3 . 
( S ) [LOC U.K.  ] Ambassador Sir [PER Vincent Fean  ] told [ORG CDA  ] February 13 that in his meeting with [PER Obeidi  ] earlier the same day , [PER Obeidi  ] underscored that the [ORG GOL  ] was " keen " to facilitate a technical visit focused on the [LOC Rabta  ] facility and modification of the enclosure surrounding it . 
[PER Obeidi  ] told [PER Fean  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] then requested that the scope of the visit be broadened to include other TSCC-related issues , which the [ORG GOL  ] was not prepared to discuss at this time . 
( Note: The [LOC U.K.  ] request to the [ORG GOL  ] for trilateral meetings separate from the [LOC Rabta  ] site visit actually pre-dated our request . 
End note . 
) Pressed by [PER Fean  ] , [PER Obeidi  ] said [LOC Libya  ] was not ready to discuss [ORG WMD  ] and missiles with the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S  ] . 
" while other issues were still outstanding " . 
[PER Fean  ] interpreted [PER Obeidi  ] 's remark to be a reference to the terrorism-related legal claims against [LOC Libya  ] in the [LOC United States  ] and recent legislation ( section 1083 of the 2008 [ORG National Defense Authorization Act  ] , aka the " [PER Lautenberg  ] amendment " ) making it easier for [LOC U.S.  ] plaintiffs to seize [MISC Libyan  ] government assets in such cases . 
4 . 
( S ) Comment: The [ORG GOL  ] 's cancellation of the ISN visit and [PER Obeidi  ] 's remarks to [PER Fean  ] are a clear signal of dissatisfaction with [LOC U.S.  ] terrorism-related lawsuits against [LOC Libya  ] ( i.e. , [ORG La Belle  ] , [ORG UTA  ] , [ORG Pan Am  ] 103 ) and the passage and signing into law of the " [PER Lautenberg  ] amendment . 
" End comment . 
5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Begin text of diplomatic note: The General People 's Committee for Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] ( [ORG International Organizations Office  ] ) presents its compliments to the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in the [LOC Great Jamahiriya  ] and , referring to the [ORG Embassy  ] 's note #092/08 dated February 4 , 2008 regarding a prospective visit to [LOC Libya  ] by a U.S.-U.K. team February 17-19 , 2008 to conduct trilateral talks on the implementation of the [ORG Chemical Weapons Prohibition Convention  ] ( [ORG CWPC  ] ) and to visit the [LOC Rabta  ] plant , has the honor to inform the esteemed [ORG Embassy  ] of the postponement of this visit to a later date that will be arranged in diplomatic channels .
