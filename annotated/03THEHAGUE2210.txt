[PER Daniel Russel Reasons 1.5  ] ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Acting Economic Counselor delivered the Secretary 's message ( ref a ) and peace process section of [LOC Gymnich  ] demarche ( ref b ) to [MISC Dutch  ] Political Affairs Director [PER Werner  ] on September 2 with a request that they be conveyed to Foreign Minister [PER de Hoop Scheffer  ] in advance of the FM 's September 3 meeting with Secretary [PER Powell  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] and FM de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] are also scheduled to meet 9/2 with the Vice President and 9/3 with the President in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [PER Werner  ] reiterated [MISC Dutch  ] support for designating [ORG Hamas  ] and its fundraisers and said FM de [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] would push for this at [LOC Gymnich  ] . 
[PER Werner  ] thought the [ORG PA  ] 's freezing of [MISC Hamas-related  ] bank accounts and proactively asking for [ORG EU  ] action against [ORG Hamas  ] fundraising would make it much easier for the [ORG EU  ] to go forward with a designation . 
A/Econcouns stressed the importance of the [ORG EU  ] 's not only designating [ORG Hamas  ] but taking proactive measures to disrupt [ORG Hamas  ] fundraising , including through investigating and designating supporters and front organizations . 
A/Econcouns mentioned the [MISC Dutch  ] designation of the [ORG Al Aqsa Foundation  ] and freezing of 200,000 euro in its funds as a positive example , although more needed to be done . 
[PER Werner  ] thought the informality of the [LOC Gymnich  ] meeting would be more conducive to a [MISC French  ] change of position than would a more formal [ORG EU  ] Council meeting . 
( Note: In a separate meeting with [MISC Poloff  ] , [PER Werner  ] 's deputy noted that pressure on [LOC France  ] from other [ORG EU  ] members is heavy right now . 
) [PER Werner  ] asked whether the [ORG USG  ] had any specific information on the fifty bank accounts of [MISC Hamas-related  ] charities frozen in [LOC Gaza  ] and inquired whether the [LOC U.S.  ] planned to freeze the accounts of these institutions as well. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Werner  ] said that an [ORG EU  ] move to cut off [ORG Hamas  ] fundraising should be followed by an approach to [LOC Israel  ] to end targeted killings of [ORG Hamas  ] leaders . 
[PER Werner  ] stressed the importance and difficulty of assuring that humanitarian assistance to the [MISC Palestinians  ] continues to flow once [ORG Hamas  ] charities are cut out . 
Funneling assistance thorough the [ORG PA  ] could strengthen [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's position , say the [MISC Dutch  ] , but [ORG Hamas  ] and its supporters are thoroughly interwoven into the [MISC Palestinian  ] charitable network . 
Delivering effective assistance , the [MISC Dutch  ] note , cannot be not accomplished simply by increasing the amount of funding available to [ORG UNWRA  ] or the PA: the absorptive capability of these organizations is limited and the security situation on the ground possibly perilous . 
It is very positive , say the [MISC Dutch  ] that the [MISC Palestinian  ] Finance Minister has moved to tighten controls on [ORG PA  ] finances including parastatals . 
[PER Werner  ] noted that the [ORG EU  ] has tried to condition its provision of additional assistance to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] on the [ORG PA  ] 's behaving responsibly in the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process .
