09 [ORG ANKARA  ] 1561 ( EXDIS ) Classified By: Ambassador [PER James Jeffrey  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) INTRODUCTION/COMMENT -------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) There is much talk in chanceries and in the international media these days about [LOC Turkey  ] 's new , highly activist foreign policy , which unquestionably represents a transition not only from prior governments , but also from the [ORG AKP  ] regime before the Gaza/Davos events , and before the ascent of [PER Ahmet Davutoglu  ] as Foreign Minister in April . 
Some commentaries are upbeat , but others , including many experts and editorial writers in the [LOC US  ] , have expressed concern . 
The ruling [ORG AKP  ] foreign policy is driven by both a desire to be more independently activist , and by a more [MISC Islamic  ] orientation . 
Frankly , rational national interest , particularly trade opportunities and stability considerations , also drives [LOC Turkey  ] 's new slant . 
Major challenges with us in the coming months include the direction of [MISC Turkish-Israeli  ] relations , the fate of the Protocols with [LOC Armenia  ] , and the [MISC Turkish  ] posture vis--vis [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Does all this mean that the country is becoming more focused on the [MISC Islamist  ] world and its [MISC Muslim  ] tradition in its foreign policy ? 
Absolutely . 
Does it mean that it is " abandoning " or wants to abandon its traditional [MISC Western  ] orientation and willingness to cooperate with us ? 
Absolutely not . 
At the end of the day we will have to live with a [LOC Turkey  ] whose population is propelling much of what we see . 
This calls for a more issue-by-issue approach , and recognition that [LOC Turkey  ] will often go its own way . 
In any case , sooner or later we will no longer have to deal with the current cast of political leaders , with their special yen for destructive drama and - rhetoric . 
But we see no one better on the horizon , and [LOC Turkey  ] will remain a complicated blend of world class " [MISC Western  ] " institutions , competencies , and orientation , and [MISC Middle Eastern  ] culture and religion . 
END INTRODUCTION . 
COMPONENTS OF POLICY -------------------- " The Traditional [MISC Western  ] " <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Turkish  ] policy today is a mix of " traditional [MISC Western  ] " orientation , attitudes and interests , and two new elements , linked with new operational philosophies: " zero conflicts " and " neo-Ottomanism . 
" The traditional still represents the core of [MISC Turkish  ] foreign policy , and is centered on cooperation and integration with the [LOC West  ] . 
Its core is [ORG NATO  ] , the customs union with the [ORG EU  ] , and most significantly , the [ORG EU  ] accession effort . 
This all began with the [MISC Ottoman  ] effort to emulate the [MISC European  ] great powers , and was propelled powerfully forward by [PER Ataturk  ] . 
Nevertheless the country was on the sidelines in [MISC World War II  ] . 
It was only the threat of the [LOC USSR  ] , and the dominance ( and outstretched hand ) of the [LOC US  ] , that led to the " [LOC Turkey  ] we know " : tough combat partner in [LOC Korea  ] , major [ORG NATO  ] ally , [LOC US  ] anchor in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Much of this continues. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Europe  ] is by far [LOC Turkey  ] 's most important economic partner in terms of investment and trade . 
The [ORG EU  ] accounts for 42 percent of [LOC Turkey  ] , s total trade , while the [LOC US  ] accounts for a bit less than 5 percent . 
While the [LOC US  ] is much less important in terms of trade statistics , it remains important in various sectors ( e.g.energy , aviation , military ) , and in various ways . 
[ORG NATO  ] is essential to and much respected by [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000087 002 OF 006 [LOC Turkey  ] . 
( Note: The fact that " only " about one-third of the [MISC Turkish  ] population in one poll see [ORG NATO  ] as important to [LOC Turkey  ] 's security is actually a plus ; on any poll [LOC Turks  ] usually are overwhelmingly negative about any foreign engagement or relationship . 
But we should not be too sanguine here since support for [ORG NATO  ] has been halved over the past decade . 
End Note ) The military is armed by the [LOC US  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] recognizes that many fires in its back yard -- from [LOC Iraq  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] -- can only be solved by close cooperation with and acceptance of [LOC US  ] and [ORG NATO  ] leadership . 
Finally , even [ORG AKP  ] leaders know that much of their allure or " wasta " in the [LOC Middle East  ] and elsewhere stems from their privileged position in key [MISC Western  ] clubs . 
This traditional orientation may be shaken , or reduced , but as it has both significant buy-in by elites of all philosophies , and many concrete advantages , [LOC Turkey  ] will not abandon it . 
" [MISC Zero Problems  ] with [LOC Turkey  ] 's Neighbors " <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) But this [LOC Turkey  ] is trying to " post-modernize " itself . 
One major area of [ORG AKP  ] effort has been to resolve problems with [LOC Turkey  ] 's immediate " near abroad . 
" This effort stands in contrast with the " traditional " [MISC Turkish  ] policy of letting these frozen conflicts fester , and is much more compatible with [LOC US  ] and [MISC European  ] interests . 
The list of [MISC Turkish  ] initiatives under the [ORG AKP  ] is impressive: accepting the [ORG Annan Plan  ] in 2004 to resolve [LOC Cyprus  ] , continuing the 1999 rapprochement with [LOC Greece  ] , the opening to [LOC Armenia  ] culminating in the signing of recognition protocols , warming and productive relations with both [LOC Baghdad  ] and [PER Erbil  ] ( the latter complemented by significant reforms in [LOC Turkey  ] 's relations with its own [MISC Kurdish  ] population ) . 
The signature accomplishment of this policy is the wooing of [LOC Syria  ] . 
While this road to [LOC Damascus  ] in fact was paved by [LOC Syria  ] 's accommodation of prior [MISC Turkish  ] governments' demands ( relinquishing claims on [LOC Turkey  ] 's [LOC Hatay  ] province , expelling [MISC Ocalan  ] ) , it is touted by the [LOC Turks  ] as a game-changer . 
As noted below , they have leveraged it to tackle a number of regional problems , from [LOC Lebanon  ] to [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) While this new approach is to be applauded , there is a fly in its ointment . 
Little of true practical and final accomplishment has been achieved . 
[LOC Cyprus  ] is still split ( albeit the fault , at least in terms of the [ORG Annan  ] plan , lies more with the [MISC Greek  ] [ORG Cypriots  ] and the [ORG EU  ] ) ; tensions with [LOC Greece  ] in the [LOC Aegean  ] continue ; the Protocols with [LOC Armenia  ] have not been ratified due to [MISC Turkish  ] concerns about [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] ; [LOC Iraq  ] 's instability and the [ORG KRG  ] 's unwillingness to do more against the [ORG PKK  ] raise questions about the sustainability of [LOC Turkey  ] 's constructive [LOC Iraq  ] policy ; the rapprochement with [LOC Syria  ] has not really produced any [MISC Syrian  ] " flip " away from [LOC Iran  ] . 
Granted , [LOC Turkey  ] is dealing with some of the world 's most difficult actors , and facing stiff opposition at home to making more concessions , but the proof of this pudding is yet to be seen . 
" [PER Neo Ottomanism  ] " <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The idea of [LOC Turkey  ] using its cultural and religious links to the [LOC Middle East  ] to the advantage of both [MISC Turkish  ] interests and regional stability is not new with the [ORG AKP  ] , but has been given much more priority by it , in part because of the [MISC Islamic  ] orientation of much of the party , including leaders [ORG Erdogan  ] , [ORG Gul  ] , and [PER Davutoglu  ] . 
Moreover , the [ORG AKP  ] 's constant harping on its unique understanding of the region , and outreach to populations over the heads of conservative , pro-US governments , have led to accusations of " neo-Ottomanism . 
" Rather than deny , [PER Davutoglu  ] has embraced this accusation . 
Himself the grandson of an [MISC Ottoman  ] soldier [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000087 003 OF 006 who fought in [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Davutoglu  ] summed up the [MISC Davutoglu/AKP  ] philosophy in an extraordinary speech in [LOC Sarajevo  ] in late 2009 ( REF A ) . 
His thesis: the [LOC Balkans  ] , [LOC Caucasus  ] , and [LOC Middle East  ] were all better off when under [MISC Ottoman  ] control or influence ; peace and progress prevailed . 
Alas the region has been ravaged by division and war ever since . 
( He was too clever to explicitly blame all that on the imperialist western powers , but came close ) . 
However , now [LOC Turkey  ] is back , ready to lead -- or even unite . 
( [PER Davutoglu:  ] " We will re-establish this ( [MISC Ottoman  ] ) [LOC Balkan  ] " ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While this speech was given in the [LOC Balkans  ] , most of its impact is in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[PER Davutoglu  ] 's theory is that most of the regimes there are both undemocratic and illegitimate . 
[LOC Turkey  ] , building on the alleged admiration among [MISC Middle Eastern  ] populations for its economic success and power , and willing to stand up for the interests of the people , reaches over the regimes to the " [MISC Arab  ] street . 
" [LOC Turkey  ] 's excoriating the [MISC Israelis  ] over [LOC Gaza  ] , culminating in the insulting treatment of President [PER Peres  ] by [ORG Erdogan  ] at [LOC Davos  ] in 2009 , illustrates this trend . 
To capitalize on its rapport with the people , and supposed diplomatic expertise and [MISC Ottoman  ] experience , [LOC Turkey  ] has thrown itself into a half-dozen conflicts as a mediator . 
This has worked well , as noted above , with [LOC Iraq  ] , and was quite successful in the [MISC Syrian-Israeli  ] talks before [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] has also achieved some limited success on [LOC Lebanon  ] and in bringing [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and [LOC Syria  ] together . 
As noted below , however , this policy brings with it great frictions , not just with us and the [MISC Europeans  ] but with many supposed beneficiaries of a return to [MISC Ottoman  ] suzerainty . 
Furthermore , it has not achieved any single success of note . 
WHY THE CHANGE ? --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Various factors explain the shifts we see in [MISC Turkish  ] foreign policy beyond the personal views of the [ORG AKP  ] leadership: -- [MISC Islamization:  ] As reported REF B , religiosity has been increasing in [LOC Turkey  ] in past years , just as has been seen in many other [MISC Muslim  ] societies . 
The [ORG AKP  ] is both a beneficiary of , and a stimulus for , this phenomenon . 
However , bitter opposition within [LOC Turkey  ] against domestic " pro-Islamic " reforms ( e.g. , head scarves ) has frustrated the [ORG AKP  ] , and a more " [MISC Islamic  ] " or " [MISC Middle Eastern  ] " foreign policy offers an alternative sop for the [ORG AKP  ] 's devout base . 
-- [PER Success: Despite  ] its problems , [LOC Turkey  ] over the past 50 years has been a success story , rising to the 16th largest economy and membership in the [MISC G-20  ] . 
This , along with its extraordinary security situation compared to all other regional states , and democratic system , encourage a more active -- and more independent -- leadership role in regional and even global affairs . 
-- Economics: one secret of [MISC Turkish  ] success has been its trade and technology-led economic growth . 
This growth is in good part thanks to its customs union with the [ORG EU  ] , by far its biggest export market , and resulting investment from the [ORG EU  ] , as well as decades of technology transfer and educational assistance from the [LOC U.S.  ] Nevertheless , with exports to the [ORG EU  ] down due to the 2008-2009 crisis , [LOC Turkey  ] is looking for new markets , particularly in the hydrocarbon rich [MISC Arab  ] world , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [ORG Caucasus/Central Asia  ] . 
They have money , and strong import demand , and [LOC Turkey  ] is dependent on them for its oil and gas . 
These countries , however , ( along with [MISC China-another Turkish  ] export target ) tend much more than the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC North America  ] to mix politics and trade . 
To some [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000087 004 OF 006 degree the [LOC West  ] thus is taken for granted and economic priority is directed towards relations with the [LOC Middle East  ] and " [LOC Eurasia  ] . 
" -- [MISC Civilians  ] ascendant: [ORG Erdogan  ] 's political success - together with a number of messy scandals resulting in public investigation - has meant that the [MISC Turkish  ] General [PER Staff  ] now plays a much smaller role in defining [LOC Turkey  ] 's foreign policy . 
[LOC Turkey  ] 's support to [ORG NATO  ] is still strong , but it now lacks the suspicion of [LOC Russia  ] which the cold-war instinct of General [PER Staff  ] brought to the mix . 
-- [ORG EU  ] disillusionment: Both popular and elite [MISC Turkish  ] opinion has recently grown much more pessimistic about eventual [ORG EU  ] membership -- or even its value . 
The reasons for this are complex , but include the shifting mood in [LOC Europe  ] towards [MISC Islam  ] , the replacement of " pro-Turkey " leaders in [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] by [ORG Sarkozy  ] and [ORG Merkel  ] , both decidedly cool towards [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] membership , and a sense in [LOC Turkey  ] of distance from and lack of sympathy for [LOC Europe  ] . 
-- Relativization of the [MISC Western  ] anchor . 
An op-ed in the [ORG Financial Times  ] by [PER Gideon Rechman  ] on January 4 noted correctly the tendency of the " young giants " -- [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] -- to pursue Third Worldish policies and rhetoric even while benefitting enormously from the globalized trade and international security created and maintained by the " [LOC West  ] . 
" That certainly characterizes [LOC Turkey  ] . 
With the end of the cold war , relative success in the struggle with the [ORG PKK  ] , and the " taming " of [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and ( at least from [LOC Turkey  ] 's point of view ) [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] 's need for [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] security is reduced . 
Its dependence on [MISC Western  ] trade , investment , technology transfer and educational exchange remains critical , but is regarded as a " free good " that [LOC Turkey  ] deserves and does not have to expend effort for . 
Relations with its various new friends in the [LOC North-East-South  ] or on the other hand require effort which is facilitated by some downplaying of [LOC Turkey  ] 's [MISC Western  ] anchor . 
[ORG DAVUTOGLU DISCONTENTS  ] --------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG AKP  ] 's new approach to international affairs receives mixed reviews inside and outside [LOC Turkey  ] . 
It is not a major factor in the [ORG AKP  ] 's relative popularity , but several elements of it ( unfortunately , those we are least happy with ) do appeal to voters . 
Criticism of [LOC Israel  ] post-Gaza is overwhelmingly popular , and the relatively soft [MISC Turkish  ] position on [LOC Iran  ] -- a country about which many [LOC Turks  ] are skeptical -- is presumably helpful with a narrow , but for [ORG Erdogan  ] 's electoral fate important , group of [MISC Islamic  ] voters associated with former PM [PER Erbakan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , many in [LOC Turkey  ] 's large westernized elite see the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Outreach  ] as a complement to the alleged [ORG AKP  ] plan to [MISC Islamize Turkish  ] society , and complain bitterly about their country 's losing its western moorings . 
The [MISC Nationalist  ] segment in [LOC Turkey  ] , mobilized most by the [ORG Nationalist Action Party  ] ( [ORG MHP  ] ) , sees the [ORG AKP  ] 's compromises on [LOC Armenia  ] , the [LOC KRG  ] in northern [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Cyprus  ] , etc , as a betrayal of diaspora " [LOC Turks  ] " ( the [MISC Iraqi  ] [ORG Turkomen  ] , [LOC Azeris  ] , [MISC Turkish  ] [LOC Cypriots  ] , etc ) and charges that the [ORG AKP  ] is trying to replace the [MISC Republic  ] 's organizing principle of " [MISC Turkism  ] " with the broader [MISC Islamic  ] " [LOC Umma  ] . 
" The [ORG Republican People 's Party  ] ( [ORG CHP  ] ) , the lead opposition party , attacks [ORG AKP  ] foreign policy relatively ineffectively with a mix of [MISC MHP-like  ] nationalist rhetoric and " abandoning the west " criticism. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) But it is in the [ORG EU  ] that the [ORG Erdogan  ] foreign policy of late has run into the heaviest of sailing . 
To some degree [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000087 005 OF 006 [MISC European  ] angst at [LOC Turkey  ] 's " new direction " is viewed as an excuse to pummel [LOC Turkey  ] to score domestic points among anti-foreigner elements . 
But there is real concern in [LOC Europe  ] , made manifest by the [ORG Rasmussen NATO SecGen  ] issue last April . 
[MISC Europeans  ] were furious with [LOC Turkey  ] 's presentng itself as the " [MISC Islamic  ] " voice or conscience in [ORG NATO  ] , having consulted with [MISC Middle Eastern States  ] before talking to its [ORG NATO  ] allies . 
Extrapolating that behavior into the even more diversity-intolerant [ORG EU  ] is a nightmare . 
[ORG Erdogan  ] 's foreign ( and domestic ) policy orientation conjures up not just a clash of Christianity and [MISC Islam  ] , but the spectre of a " meld " of [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , and of [LOC Europe  ] 's secularlism with oriental religiosity . 
[PER Davutoglu  ] and others argue that [LOC Turkey  ] 's " success " as a coming [LOC Middle East  ] power makes it more attractive to the [ORG EU  ] -- giving [LOC Europe  ] a new foreign policy " market " through [LOC Turkey  ] . 
While some in [LOC Europe  ] appear interested in this idea , ironically including [LOC Turkey  ] [ORG EU  ] membership skeptic [LOC France  ] , this does not seem to carry much weight in most [MISC European  ] capitals , let alone populations. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Finally , not all of the ex-Ottomans look with fondness on their past under the [MISC Pashas  ] , or yearn for [LOC Turkey  ] 's return . 
Reaction among many in the [LOC Balkans  ] to [PER Davutoglu  ] 's [LOC Sarejevo  ] speech ( [ORG REF  ] A ) was quite strong . 
In the [LOC Middle East  ] itself , the [MISC Arab  ] street might applaud [LOC Turkey  ] 's populistic and essentially cost-free support for more radical elements , but it 's not particularly appreciated by rulers ( although [LOC Turkey  ] seems to have made some progress with [LOC Syria  ] , brokered a rapprochement between President Bashir and [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] , and has had some role in resolving the [LOC Lebanon  ] cabinet stalemate ) . 
Sooner or later , though , [LOC Turkey  ] will have to produce results , take risks , commit real resources , and take hard decisions to augment a policy now consisting mainly of popular slogans , ceaseless trips , and innumerable signatures on MOUs of little importance . 
The experience with [LOC Iran  ] , which despite significant [MISC Turkish  ] verbal support and wooing , appears uninterested in granting [LOC Turkey  ] any concessions , or agreeing to a [MISC Turkish  ] lead in mediation efforts , is telling . 
THE PROBLEM FOR THE [LOC US  ] ---------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's new foreign policy is a mixed bag for us . 
Having regional heavyweights take on burdens , thereby relieving us , has long been a desired goal of [LOC US  ] policy , but it comes with a certain loss of control . 
Nevertheless , on a whole host of key issues of supreme importance to us -- [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , cooperation in and on [LOC Iraq  ] , [ORG NATO  ] efforts ( although a leading [MISC Turkish  ] role in [LOC Missile Defense  ] will not be easy ) -- [LOC Turkey  ] is a crucial ally , and our use of [LOC Incirlik  ] , [LOC Habur  ] gate , and [MISC Turkish  ] airspace for our [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] operations is indispensible . 
Its " zero conflicts " initiatives , which have moved [LOC Turkey  ] forward on more of the key bilateral spats -- [LOC Cyprus  ] , [LOC Greece  ] , [MISC Kurds  ] , [ORG Northern Iraq  ] , [LOC Armenia  ] -- than we have seen with any other [MISC Turkish  ] government , also support [LOC U.S.  ] interests. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Nevertheless , these latter issues illustrate two problems . 
At least in [MISC Turkish  ] eyes , on this complex of issues the [LOC US  ] , especially the media , interest groups , and [ORG Congress  ] , default to a " blame [LOC Turkey  ] " posture regardless of whatever it does . 
Second , [LOC Turkey  ] has repeatedly run into trouble actually consummating these various openings -- the [MISC Armenian  ] protocols being the best example , but continued overflights of [MISC Greek  ] islands and domestic opposition to the [MISC Kurdish  ] opening are also relevant . 
What we fear is that this inability to bring to conclusion foreign policy initiatives will affect not just the above , but most [MISC Turkish  ] policy , given the over-extension of [PER Davutoglu  ] and his team , and a [ORG ANKARA  ] 00000087 006 OF 006 tendency to substitute rhetoric for long term investment of diplomatic , military , and assistance capital . 
( Fortunately , [MISC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] are the two major exceptions to this tendency . 
) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The greatest potential strategic problem for the [LOC US  ] , however , and the one that has some of the commentators howling , is the [LOC Turks  ] neo-Ottoman posturing around the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Balkans  ] . 
This " back to the past " attitude so clear in [PER Davutoglu  ] 's [LOC Sarajevo  ] speech , combined with the [LOC Turks'  ] tendency to execute it through alliances with more [MISC Islamic  ] or more worrisome local actors , constantly creates new problems . 
Part of this is structural . 
Despite their success and relative power , the [LOC Turks  ] really can't compete on equal terms with either the [LOC US  ] or regional " leaders " ( [ORG EU  ] in the [LOC Balkans  ] , [LOC Russia  ] in the [LOC Caucasus/Black Sea  ] , [MISC Saudis  ] , [MISC Egyptians  ] and even [MISC Iranians  ] in the [LOC ME  ] ) . 
With [ORG Rolls Royce  ] ambitions but Rover resources , to cut themselves in on the action the [LOC Turks  ] have to " cheat " by finding an underdog ( this also plays to [ORG Erdogan  ] 's own worldview ) , a [MISC Siladjcic  ] , [PER Mish'al  ] , or [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , who will be happy to have the [LOC Turks  ] take up his cause . 
The [LOC Turks  ] then attempt to ram through revisions to at least the reigning " [MISC Western  ] " position to the favor of their guy . 
Given , again , the questioning of [MISC Western  ] policy and motives by much of the [MISC Turkish  ] public and the [ORG AKP  ] , such an approach provides a relatively low cost and popular tool to demonstrate influence , power , and the " we're back " slogan. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) This has been , so far , manageable , if at times high maintenance , in the [LOC Balkans  ] and [LOC Mideast  ] , although the damage to [MISC Israeli-Turkish  ] relations remains serious . 
If the [LOC Turks  ] are genuine in their desire to draw [LOC Syria  ] away from [LOC Iran  ] , and if they begin achieving real success rather than telephone books worth of questionable protocols , then that will be of benefit to us all . 
But with [LOC Iran  ] itself it is a different story . 
[ORG REF  ] C describes the background to the [MISC Turkish  ] relationship with [LOC Iran  ] , one more complicated than with their ex-Ottoman [MISC Arab  ] and other subjects . 
Trade/hydrocarbon interests , [MISC Turkish  ] aversion to sanctions stemming from the first [MISC Gulf War  ] , [ORG Erdogan  ] 's vocal " third worldism " and certain domestic political considerations all push [LOC Turkey  ] in the wrong direction . 
Unlike with many of the other issues , however , [LOC Turkey  ] will have to stand and be counted on [LOC Iran  ] , in the [ORG Security Council  ] , with [LOC MD  ] , and in implementation of [ORG UN  ] or [LOC US  ] sanctions . 
This will have a profound effect on relations second only to the fate of the [MISC Armenian  ] protocols over the next year .
