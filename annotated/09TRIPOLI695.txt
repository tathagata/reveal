REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an action request ; see para 8. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: MFA A/S-equivalent [PER Fituri  ] convoked [ORG CDA  ] August 27 to formally request that [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's [ORG Ifriqiyah Airways  ] plane be granted full diplomatic clearance -- including privileges and immunities normally granted a head of state -- for [PER Qadhafi  ] 's trip to the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
[ORG CDA  ] noted that this was not the only unresolved issue surrounding the trip , and urged the [MISC Libyan  ] Government to find an appropriate solution to the [LOC Englewood  ] house controversy and to ensure that [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Megrahi  ] was not featured in the September 1 festivities . 
[PER Fituri  ] said the [ORG MFA  ] understood these issues and was working to ensure [PER Qadhafi  ] 's inner circle did as well . 
[PER Fituri  ] also briefed [ORG CDA  ] on [ORG GOL  ] plans to demonstrate its commitment to the bilateral relationship: payment for the seven [ORG USG  ] properties in [LOC Tripoli  ] ; approval of the uranium transfer agreement ; approval of the [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ; approval of the [MISC Section 505 Agreement  ] ; progress on the visas working group ; and approval of land to build a [ORG New Embassy Compound  ] . 
We have seen progress on some of these issues in recent days . 
While it is reassuring that the [ORG MFA  ] understands the negative impact of [PER Megrahi  ] 's reception and is actively working to address the damage , [PER Fituri  ] also seemed painfully aware that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's personal whims could scuttle the [ORG MFA  ] 's efforts . 
He seemed to want quick resolution of the [ORG Ifriqiyah  ] plane issue for this reason , and also emphasized that a [LOC U.S.  ] presence on September 1 would be an important sign of our continued commitment to the relationship . 
End summary . 
QADHAFI'S PLANE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MFA  ] A/S-equivalent for the [ORG Americas  ] [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] convoked [ORG CDA  ] August 27 to deliver a diplomatic note formally requesting that [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's [ORG Ifriqiyah Airways  ] plane be granted full diplomatic clearance -- including privileges and immunities -- for [PER Qadhafi  ] 's upcoming trip to [LOC New York  ] for the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
Citing [MISC Libyan  ] Ambassador [PER Aujali  ] 's August 25 meeting with [ORG Department  ] officials , [PER Fituri  ] said the [MISC Libyan  ] Government is concerned that [ORG Ifriqiyah  ] is not registered with [LOC U.S.  ] civil aviation authorities . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] Government , [PER Fituri  ] said , believes that the [ORG Ifriqiyah  ] plane needs full diplomatic privileges and immunities , and should have " the same status as any other head of state . 
" Charge promised to convey the message to [LOC Washington  ] . 
( Informal embassy translation of the note was emailed to NEA/MAG . 
) [LOC ENGLEWOOD  ] HOUSE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG CDA  ] noted that the [ORG Ifriqiyah  ] plane was not the only unresolved issue surrounding [PER Qadhafi  ] 's trip to [LOC New York  ] . 
As [ORG NEA A/S Feltman  ] had discussed with FM [PER Kusa  ] , we also hoped the [MISC Libyan  ] Government would work to manage the controversy surrounding [PER Qadhafi  ] 's plans to stay at the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Perm Rep  ] 's residence in [LOC Englewood  ] , [LOC New Jersey  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] said that [PER Kusa  ] and the [ORG MFA  ] understand the problems posed by the [LOC Englewood  ] house and are working to make sure that they also are understood by the Leader 's inner circle . 
[PER Fituri  ] thought the [ORG Perm Rep  ] 's [LOC New York  ] residence could be a good option , but also seemed to be unaware of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's requirement to stay in ground-floor accommodations , a point Protocol Chief Mismari shared with us yesterday ( reftel ) . 
REPAIRING THE DAMAGE <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Asking [ORG MFA Americas Director  ] Matari to leave the room , [PER Fituri  ] then said that he had met one-on-one with FM [PER Kusa  ] for several hours on August 26 , under orders to quickly take concrete steps that could demonstrate the [MISC Libyans'  ] desire to keep the [LOC U.S.  ] relationship moving in the right direction . 
[PER Fituri  ] pulled out a confidential briefing paper and walked [ORG CDA  ] through the following steps: - Payment for the seven [ORG USG  ] properties in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] This is a long-standing issue ; the [ORG GOL  ] had promised to provide payment earlier this year . 
MGT Officer was called to a 1:00 pm meeting with the [ORG Land Registry Office  ] and is reporting details septel . 
) - Approval and implementation of the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] transfer agreement . 
[PER Fituri  ] said Dr. Gashut and his team at the [ORG Tajura Nuclear Center  ] are fully authorized to finish the negotiations and initial the document . 
[PER Fituri  ] noted that the [MISC Libyans  ] have approved and signed the [MISC Russian  ] agreement as well , and that is now being reviewed by [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] commented that " It is [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000695 002.2 OF 002 extremely important that we get this done , particularly with the September 24 UNSC session on nonproliferation . 
" - Approval and signature of the [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIFA  ] ) . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] has transmitted the latest [MISC Libyan  ] edits to [ORG USTR  ] . 
) - Approval of the [MISC Section 505 End-user Agreement  ] . 
While [PER Fituri  ] insists that the end-user agreement has been " approved , " he acknowledged today that it is stuck in the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy . 
[PER Fituri  ] said that , following his meeting with [PER CODEL McCain  ] , [PER Muatassim Al-Qadhafi  ] had ordered the [ORG MOD  ] to gin up the necessary paperwork . 
Although the [ORG MOD  ] took prompt action , the [ORG MFA  ] was required to send the dip note back to [PER Muatassim  ] for final approval , where it has languished for at least one week. - [MISC Visas  ] working group . 
The [ORG MFA  ] has instructed its consular department to hold a meeting on visa reciprocity arrangements with the [MISC Embassy  ] as soon as possible. - Land for a [ORG New Embassy Compound  ] ( [ORG NEC  ] ) . 
Although the [ORG MFA  ] included this on the list , [PER Fituri  ] did not anticipate progress on the issue . 
[PER Fituri  ] said that when he brought up the [ORG NEC  ] with [PER Kusa  ] , [PER Kusa  ] told him: " You were in the meeting between [PER Clinton  ] and [PER Muatassim  ] , right ? 
[PER Muatassim  ] has discussed this with his father . 
" [PER Fituri  ] then commented with a shrug , " This is a father-son issue . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG CDA  ] underscored that , while we welcomed this progress and shared the [MISC Libyan  ] Government 's desire to keep the relationship moving forward , [PER Megrahi  ] 's reception in [LOC Libya  ] was a serious problem . 
It is vitally important that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government take appropriate steps to manage this issue . 
Charge reiterated that the [LOC U.S.  ] needs an appropriate resolution of the [LOC Englewood  ] house issue , and also needs to ensure that [PER Megrahi  ] will be neither a guest at nor a featured theme at the September 1 festivities . 
[ORG CDA  ] noted that the [MISC Embassy  ] had seen the banners around [LOC Green Square  ] lauding [PER Megrahi  ] as a hero and added that , even if [PER Megrahi  ] were not present for the festivities , we would object to rhetoric honoring him . 
[LOC U.S.  ] PRESENCE IMPORTANT ON SEPTEMBER 1 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Fituri  ] said he understood our views and that the [ORG MFA  ] was working to ensure the September 1 celebrations were not a problem for the bilateral relationship . 
He also said it was very important , from the [ORG MFA  ] 's perspective , to have a [LOC U.S.  ] presence at the September 1 celebration . 
" Your absence would be problematic , " [PER Fituri  ] emphasized . 
Stressing that no decisions had been made regarding [LOC U.S.  ] representation , [ORG CDA  ] countered that it would be still more problematic if the [LOC U.S.  ] had to walk out of the ceremonies during a speech praising [PER Megrahi  ] . 
[PER Fituri  ] nodded in agreement , and added that although the [ORG MFA  ] recognized that high-level representation was not likely , the presence of the [ORG CDA  ] at the September 1 event would an important sign of our commitment to the relationship . 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment and Action Request: FM [PER Kusa  ] and his like-minded colleagues at the [ORG MFA  ] clearly understand the negative impact that [PER Megrahi  ] 's warm reception in [LOC Libya  ] has had on the bilateral relationship . 
It is important that they are working to manage the impact and , if they can deliver on the agenda laid out in para 5 ( which reflects the agenda laid out in [ORG NEA A/S Feltman  ] 's July 26 meeting with [PER Kusa  ] ) , this will be a reassuring sign of the [MISC Libyan  ] Government 's commitment to maintaining our improved relationship . 
We have seen some progress on these issues in recent days . 
Yet the possibility remains that the personal whims of [LOC Libya  ] 's very unpredictable leader could scuttle the efforts of the pro-engagement camp . 
[PER Fituri  ] seemed painfully aware of this reality and extremely anxious to head off any potential new controversies through quick resolution of the [MISC Ifriqiyah  ] plane issue . 
Department 's guidance on this issue is requested .
