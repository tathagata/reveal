<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC DHAKA  ] 000482 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR H EO 12958 DECL: 05/13/2019 TAGS PTER , PGOV , PREL , HYMPSK , MARR , [LOC KPAO  ] , [LOC UK  ] , BG SUBJECT: FINDING COMMON GROUND ON COUNTERRORISM WORKING WITH THE [LOC UK  ] Classified By: Ambassador [PER James F. Moriarty  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------ SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] share common counterterrorism goals in [LOC Bangladesh  ] and we have worked together on specific issues in the past . 
Embassy [LOC Dhaka  ] and the [ORG British High Commission  ] reviewed our efforts and agreed on several areas of cooperation at an inaugural counterterrorism quarterly meeting . 
Specifically , we agreed trying to arrange a visit to [LOC London  ] and [LOC Washington  ] for senior [MISC Bangladeshi  ] officials to view both countries’ national security systems . 
The missions also agreed to work closely on human rights training for the paramilitary [ORG Rapid Action Battalion  ] ( [ORG RAB  ] ) and on promoting curriculum reform at [LOC Bangladesh’s  ] unregulated madrassas . 
The missions identified several other areas in which coordinated action could promote badly needed security sector reform in [LOC Bangladesh.  ] --------------------------------------------- - COMMON CT GOAL: PROMOTE SECURITY SECTOR REFORM --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC British  ] High Commissioner [PER Stephen Evans  ] and Ambassador [PER Moriarty  ] led an inaugural counterterrorism quarterly meeting between our two missions on May 13 . 
Although members of the two missions have met individually to discuss counterterrorism issues and work together on specific projects , this forum provided an opoprtunity to discuss broad goals and develop strategies to work collaboratively . 
Several common areas of interest quickly emerged , most prominently the desire to promote security sector reform in [LOC Bangladesh  ] . 
[PER Evans  ] said this would be the center of discussion at an inaugural [ORG Joint Working Group  ] meeting on counterterrorism between [LOC Britain  ] and [LOC Bangladesh  ] , led by [MISC British  ] Security Minister [PER Lord West  ] , in late June , and promised a quick read-out of the results to the [ORG Embassy.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Perhaps the key element of security sector reform is building a healthier civil-military relationship . 
The dysfunctional relationship dates from the numerous coups in [LOC Bangladesh’s  ] early years and was recently exacerbated by the February 25-26 border guard mutiny against army officers . 
The Ambassador detailed Post’s plans to invite senior [MISC Bangladeshi  ] officials to participate in an [ORG Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies  ] workshop in November to exchange views on civil-military relations and national security systems . 
The two missions agreed the workshop would be most effective if a [MISC Bangladeshi  ] delegation of military , government and Parliament representatives first visited the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] to learn about our national security structures . 
The missions will seek a visit in September ; Post will work with [ORG SCA  ] to ensure the [LOC Washington  ] leg includes visits to [LOC Capitol Hill  ] , the [ORG Department of Defense  ] , the [ORG State Department  ] and the [ORG National Security Council.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We agreed to jointly engage [LOC Bangladesh’s  ] newly formed [ORG National Committee  ] on [ORG Militancy Resistance and Prevention  ] , a high-level group led by [ORG Home Affairs State  ] Minister [PER Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj  ] , who has worked closely with the [ORG Embassy  ] on security issues . 
Local media has reported the committee will focus in part on anti-extremism messaging , an area in which both missions already are actively engaged and can work more cooperatively . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC United Kingdom  ] also agreed to jointly sound out the Government of [LOC Bangladesh  ] on its post-mutiny reorganization plans for the [ORG Bangladesh Rifles  ] and then work together to help make it a more effective border patrol force. ------------------------------------------- COMMON CT GOAL: PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS IN [ORG RAB  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] representatives reviewed our ongoing training to make the [ORG RAB  ] a more transparent , accountable and human-rights compliant paramilitary force . 
The [MISC British  ] have been training [ORG RAB  ] for 18 months in areas such as investigative interviewing techniques and rules of engagement . 
They said that the training had been widely disseminated within [ORG RAB  ] and that they were undertaking an assessment of its effectiveness . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] described plans [LOC DHAKA  ] 00000482 002 OF 002 to imbed two [LOC U.S.  ] marshals within [ORG RAB  ] for three months to help set up internal affairs , use of force and rules of engagement systems . 
High Commissioner [PER Evans  ] suggested the marshals stop in [LOC London  ] on the way to [LOC Bangladesh  ] to meet with [MISC British  ] police who have delivered human rights training to [ORG RAB  ] . 
He said the visit would ensure maximum coordination between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC British  ] programs ; the Ambassador enthusiastically supported the proposal. --------------------------------------------- ------- MARITIME SECURITY , POLICING , AIRPORT SAFETY AND MORE --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Evans  ] promised to send the [ORG Embassy  ] a “lessons learned” document from a just-concluded combined [MISC British-Bangladesh  ] maritime security exercise in which [ORG U.S. Department of Defense  ] personnel participated . 
He noted the [LOC U.K.  ] did not expect to have any more [ORG Royal Navy  ] ships visit [LOC Bangladesh  ] before 2011 and asked whether the [LOC United States  ] could take the lead in organizing a follow-up exercise . 
With the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Britain  ] both ramping up programs to develop community policing , we agreed to create an informal consultative group led by the [MISC British  ] that would include other international missions in [LOC Dhaka  ] with policing projects . 
The two missions also agreed to have their two development agencies , [ORG USAID  ] and the [ORG U.K. Department for International Development  ] , meet to discuss strategies for supporting Prime Minister Sheikh [PER Hasina’s  ] plan to develop standardized curriculum for thousands of unregulated [MISC Islamic  ] madrassa schools . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG Embassy  ] has submitted a 1207 proposal for a madrassa curriculum development program . 
End note ) . 
Finally , noting the horrendous safety gaps at [LOC Dhaka’s  ] international airport , the Ambassador and High Commissioner agreed to sound out contacts within their respective governments , the international airlines that serve [LOC Dhaka  ] , and the [MISC Bangladeshi  ] state airline to determine how best to improve security. ----------------------- CONCLUSION: NOW WE KNOW ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The inaugural [MISC U.S.-British  ] quarterly meeting provided each side with a much better understanding of what the other was doing to counter terrorism and extremism in [LOC Bangladesh  ] . 
Not surprisingly , our counterterrorism strategies and goals are closely aligned , allowing ample room for close coordination and , in some cases , joint programs . 
Given that Sheikh [PER Hasina’s  ] new government has made security a top priority , the chances of [MISC U.S.-British  ] joint efforts bearing fruit are high indeed .
