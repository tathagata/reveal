( C ) Summary: The [ORG GONL  ] sent a letter to the [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] on June 30 noting it will decide this summer whether to extend its [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The decision will follow an exhaustive review of all options , including staying in the mission 's current capacity , reducing its contribution or moving to another location , or even withdrawing altogether . 
Cabinet officials have stressed that " " all options are on the table , " " while public statements by Defense Minister [PER Eimert van Middelkoop  ] in favor of remaining in some capacity may have tipped the hand of the [ORG GONL  ] and temporarily unsettled the political process . 
[MISC Dutch  ] officials are cautiously optimistic that the conditions are in place to arrive at a positive extension decision , but stress that sequencing is vital: first the review of options , then consultations with [MISC Allies  ] , followed by a decision and subsequent debate with [ORG Parliament  ] . 
End summary . 
Important First Step -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Following its June 29 meeting , the [ORG Dutch Cabinet  ] sent a letter to [ORG Parliament  ] stating that the [ORG GONL  ] will decide this summer whether it will extend its [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] beyond August 2008 , and if so , in what capacity . 
The letter notes that the [ORG Cabinet  ] will investigate the " " options and desirability of continuing to make a contribution " " to [ORG ISAF  ] . 
The review will be conducted in accordance with the set criteria required for parliamentary consent prior to deploying [MISC Dutch  ] troops abroad ( " " toetsingskader " " ) . 
The letter formally begins the [ORG Article  ] 100 process -- more importantly , it means the [ORG GONL  ] can formally solicit contributions from other [ORG NATO  ] Allies to team with the [MISC Dutch  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In a July 2 meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] , [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] ( MFA Director General for Political Affairs ) confirmed that issuing the letter represents an important step toward a possible extension . 
Although , for political reasons , the [ORG GONL  ] remains restricted from expressing support for a particular option , [PER de Gooijer  ] said it " " was fair to say " " that the [ORG Cabinet  ] appears to be quietly moving in that direction . 
He stressed , however , that there is not yet a firm consensus within the [ORG Cabinet  ] , and some members are still holding out for significant concessions ( e.g. , more money for Defense , a significant mission in [LOC Africa  ] for Development ) . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] noted that the six key ministers ( the Prime Minister , two Deputy Prime Ministers , and the ministers of Foreign Affairs , Development and Defense ) will meet on July 12 to consider next steps and hopefully steer the process in a positive direction . 
One Step Beyond --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Following the June 29 [ORG Cabinet  ] meeting , [ORG Cabinet  ] ministers emphasized to the press that " " all options were currently on the table , " " and that the [ORG GONL  ] would decide whether to extend once the review of options had been fully completed . 
During one of the press interviews , however , Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] seemingly tipped the hand of the [ORG GONL  ] by noting that " " the political intention is to stay , be it in a more modest form . 
" " He explained that other Allies should take more responsibility , and that some tasks could be phased out to [MISC Allies  ] , thereby leading to a trimmed-down [MISC Dutch  ] extension . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] acknowledged that ending the mission was an option , but " " the intention is to continue in some form . 
" " <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] 's remarks prompted a firestorm of criticism from both supporters and critics of the current mission . 
Supporters lamented that van [PER Middelkoop  ] hamstrung the extension review before it started as critics will argue that any such review will be subjective in nature as the [ORG GONL  ] attempts to achieve van [PER Middelkoop  ] 's stated desire to remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Critics worried that van [PER Middelkoop  ] 's remarks might send the wrong signal to [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Washington  ] , thereby lifting them off the hook by telling them it was not necessary for military planners to initiate contingencies should the [MISC Dutch  ] opt not to extend. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Following van [PER Middelkoop  ] 's remarks , Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] clarified the [ORG GONL  ] " " official position " " -- the [MISC Dutch  ] will investigate whether to continue , and if so , " " how and in what way . 
" " But in no sense had the [ORG GONL  ] made any decision on an extension . 
He emphasized that " " matters should be done in the right order , " " and declined to acknowledge any current political intention to extend . 
[PER Balkenende  ] added that the decision should be made with careful consideration of all arguments -- " " all options remain on the table . 
" " He said the [ORG GONL  ] 's decision would be made this summer , perhaps as late as September , following a " " very intensive process . 
" " .. . 
And a Step Backwards ------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] began the July 2 parliamentary hearing on [LOC Afghanistan  ] by backtracking on his earlier comments . 
He characterized his remarks as a " " slip of the tongue , " " and emphasized that the [ORG GONL  ] would first review all options prior to making any decision to extend . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] reiterated this clarified position on July 3 in a meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] . 
He stressed that " " all options were on the table " " and that his suggestion that the [MISC Dutch  ] remain in a limited capacity was " " a mistake , " " and not a case of " " being too honest . 
" " [PER Van Middelkoop  ] said his remarks required an apology to [ORG Parliament  ] , for which he was " " beaten up for 15 minutes , " " and then the [LOC Afghanistan  ] debate continued as it had previously. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In his meeting with Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] , van [PER Middelkoop  ] commented on the [MISC Dutch  ] participation in heavy fighting around [LOC Chora  ] in the previous few weeks . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] had been " " very lucky " " that the [MISC Dutch  ] commander on the ground had made the right tactical decision to stay and fight . 
[PER Van Middelkoop  ] also praised the [MISC Afghan  ] security forces , noting that they had " " fought well . 
" " He said there was still some fighting and instability in the region , which was one of the major reasons why he was visiting [LOC Afghanistan  ] on July 5-6. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] also commented on prospects of persuading the [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] to support an extension . 
He said part of his challenge with [ORG Parliament  ] involves the position of his predecessor and current parliamentary member [PER Henk Kamp  ] , who has adamantly stated that the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Uruzgan  ] should last for two years , and " " only two years . 
" " In order to overcome [PER Kamp  ] and others , van [PER Middelkoop  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] must present sound arguments -- " " the military , political , and financial lines of reasoning all must be convincing . 
" " Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] commented that van [PER Middelkoop  ] has more flexibility on the ground than [PER Kamp  ] , to which the Defense Minister smiled. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Officially , the [ORG GONL  ] does not yet have an opinion on any particular option . 
But in private , van [PER Middelkoop  ] said the best option to extend in [LOC Afghanistan  ] probably involves a more modest contribution with the support of additional partners . 
He characterized the partnership with [LOC Australia  ] as good , but said more help was needed from other Allies in order to convince [ORG Parliament  ] . 
He said the next step was for he and Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] to travel to [ORG NATO  ] and make the case for additional assistance . 
He assessed the political situation on a possible extension as typical " " coalition politics , " " and repeated previously made remarks that " " we are still in the fog " " regarding an extension , " " but we are moving in the right direction . 
" " Parliamentary Hearing --------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In a three hour parliamentary session o July 2 , parliamentarians from both sides of thepolitical spectrum raised concerns regarding the heavy fighting around [LOC Chora  ] and subsequent civilian casualties . 
They initially lambasted van [PER Middelkoop  ] for his comments regarding the political intent to extend , but later seemed to accept his apology . 
Parliamentarians from the left , including Socialist [PER Harry van Bommel  ] and [PER Green Left Mariko Peters  ] , said van [ORG Middelkoop  ] 's comments will send [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Washington  ] the " " wrong signal , " " especially as [ORG NATO  ] is " " responsible " " for finding an Ally to replace the [LOC Netherlands  ] -- " " now [ORG NATO  ] will think that the [MISC Dutch  ] will extend and plans to replace us will not commence , " " said van [ORG Bommel.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) No new arguments were raised during the hearing . 
While all members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee raised concerns about civilian casualties , all comments made were reasoned and emotionally restrained . 
Both [PER Verhagen  ] and van [PER Middelkoop  ] noted four on-going investigations ( the [MISC Dutch  ] military , the [ORG UN  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] , and [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] ) following the fighting in [LOC Chora  ] , and promised to deliver results of the investigations as soon as they become available . 
Separately , [ORG MFA Task Force Uruzgan Coordinator  ] Pieter [PER Jan Kleiweg de Zwaan  ] told emboffs July 3 that they expect the [MISC Dutch  ] military investigation to be completed on or around July 10 . 
Privately [PER Kleiweg  ] was worried that the investigations might contradict one another , further muddling an already confusing situation. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Other concerns voiced by parliamentarians included the cost of the deployment , poppy eradication , and relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Both [PER Verhagen  ] and van [PER Middelkoop  ] said it was " " too simplistic " " to classify the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment as either a military or reconstruction mission -- both are necessary in order to be successful . 
[PER Verhagen  ] argued that intense fighting in [LOC Chora  ] did not mean that reconstruction in [LOC Uruzgan  ] was impossible . 
Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] began to lay the foundation necessary to make the argument later in the summer and fall that reconstruction was not only possible , but in fact working in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
In response to a question from [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) spokesperson [PER Angelien Eijsink  ] , van [PER Middelkoop  ] refuted claims made in the [MISC Dutch  ] periodical [ORG Elsevier  ] that the [MISC Dutch  ] military had released a senior [MISC Taliban  ] leader . 
He explained that [MISC Afghan  ] authorities had initially made the arrest , and the [MISC Dutch  ] offered to hold the individual briefly before returning him to [MISC Afghan  ] authorities . 
Government Strategy ------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) While cautiously optimistic , the working level continues to emphasize PM [PER Balkenende  ] 's message that the [ORG GONL  ] " " check all the boxes " " during its review prior to making an official extension decision . 
[PER Kleiweg  ] told emboffs July 2 that the six ministers most responsible for making a decision to extend ( [PER Balkenende  ] and [PER Verhagen  ] from the [ORG Christian Democratic Alliance  ] , Deputy Minister/Finance Minister [PER Bos  ] and [PER Koenders  ] from the [ORG Labor Party  ] , and Deputy Minister/Minister for Youth and [ORG Family Affairs  ] Rouvoet and van [PER Middelkoop  ] from the [ORG Christian Union  ] ) have already met on several occasions , and dynamics among the ministers are " " good . 
" " [PER Kleiweg  ] characterized the ministers as " " moving in the right direction , " " and deflected suggestions that Finance Minister [PER Bos  ] might be problematic . 
He said " " The Six " " will meet again on July 12 prior to the summer break to discuss various extension options. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Kleiweg  ] noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] have yet to formally solicit contributions from other [ORG NATO  ] Allies to any [MISC Dutch  ] etension in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
He said the [ORG GONL  ] first will idntify options and possible tasks that could be flled by others prior to approaching Allies . 
Kleweg acknowledged that the [MISC Dutch  ] are " " picky " " whenit comes to the question of which Allies to apprach -- any potential partner has to " " speak the sae language " " and possess a " " similar outlook " " when i comes to reconstution efforts . 
He also noteda certain reluctance on the part of the [MISC Dutch  ] miitary to incorporate elements from yet another mlitary -- but such hesitancy will need to be overome should the review determine the best chance f an extension involves teaming with another [ORG Ally.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Once tasks and partners are identified , [PER Kleiweg  ] said the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG SACEUR  ] could be helpful in persuading these Allies to team with the [MISC Dutch  ] -- provided the government opts for an extension . 
When asked about possibly teaming with [LOC U.S.  ] forces , [PER Kleiweg  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] " " have no problem " " with [LOC U.S.  ] forces under [ORG ISAF  ] command . 
He noted , however , that OEF/ISAF deconfliction continues to be a sensitive issue in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , especially as the dividing line between the two becomes more blurry. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Low public support for both the current mission and any extension continues to be a problem . 
[PER Kleiweg  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] is looking at respected " " international voices " " to enlist to try and influence public opinion . 
He noted that the [ORG GONL  ] had arranged through [ORG NATO  ] the visit of several [MISC Afghan  ] parliamentarians to the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
While the trip was a success , [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] media considered the visit " " [ORG NATO  ] propaganda , " " [PER Kleiweg  ] said . 
He noted that the individual with the most power to change [MISC Dutch  ] public opinion was [MISC Afghan  ] President [PER Karzai  ] , but acknowledged even that might have changed in recent weeks given [PER Karzai  ] 's criticism of the [MISC Dutch  ] military action in [LOC Chora  ] . 
[PER Kleiweg  ] said [PER Karzai  ] intends to visit the [LOC Netherlands  ] in December -- " " hopefully long after the [MISC Dutch  ] have made a decision on extending , " " he added . 
Uruzgan Gov. Monib might be another option , although [PER Kleiweg  ] said [ORG GONL  ] relations with [PER Monib  ] are no longer that strong as [PER Monib  ] appears more interested in events in [LOC Kabul  ] than in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , while [PER Monib  ] 's travel ban remains problematic . 
Other international respected voices might include individuals such as [ORG UN  ] SYG [PER Ban Ki-Moon  ] , [PER Kleiweg  ] said . 
Detention Policy ---------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Kleiweg  ] told emboffs July 3 that the [ORG GONL  ] has circulated a draft letter among [MISC RC-South  ] contributing nations to the [MISC Afghan  ] government requesting greater access for the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Independent Human Rights Council  ] to detainees held in [MISC Afghan  ] prisons . 
The draft letter was an action item derived from the latest [MISC RC-South  ] conference held in The [MISC Hague  ] in June <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
According to [PER Kleiweg  ] , the [ORG GONL  ] , as well as the governments of [LOC Canada  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , and [LOC Australia  ] have all approved the draft letter . 
He inquired if the [ORG USG  ] had reviewed the letter and had any comments ; emboffs said they would check with [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG Inter-Governmental Dynamics  ] --------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S//NOFORN  ] ) Working level contacts describe the relationship between [PER Verhagen  ] and [PER Koenders  ] as " " contentious but not outright hostile . 
" " Instead of direct confrontation , the two often wage battles through their staffs at the working level , said [ORG MFA Security Affairs  ] Chief [PER Robert de Groot  ] . 
That said , when the two ministers agree , the resulting decision has added weight and is often " " ironclad . 
" " [PER Van Middelkoop  ] is described as " " the third wheel , " " or the " " inexperienced junior partner " " by working level contacts . 
While substantively knowledgeable , his inexperience in the government is obvious , and he often defers to [PER Verhagen  ] and [ORG Koenders.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S//NOFORN  ] ) According to working level contacts , [PER Koenders  ] has a " " voracious apetite " " for information on [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- " " he want to know how many grains of sand are in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , " " said [PER Kleiweg  ] . 
While he has an almost equal statu to [PER Verhagen  ] on [LOC Afghanistan  ] behind closed doors , [PER Koenders  ] resents being viewed as subordinate to he other two ministers in public . 
" " He cannot stad waiting for two hours to speak during a parliaentary hearing , and then be restricted to only tn minutes of speaking time , " " said [ORG Task Force Deput Coordinator Dewi  ] van [PER de Weerde  ] . 
Working level ontacts also describe him as incapable of making decision , which could play into extension consierations . 
Comment ------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( S ) [PER Van Middelkoop  ] 's comments -- while seemingly positive from our perspective -- temporarily unsettled the political debate on extending . 
Cabinet members were reportedly incensed by van [PER Middelkoop  ] 's blunder , but his public mea culpa seems to have appeased naysayers in Parliament . 
Despite it , the [ORG GONL  ] once again appears to be on the same page in its efforts to create the conditions necessary to arrive at a positive extension decision . 
There is a process -- an exhaustive review followed by consultations -- that must be followed in order for this to work , and [ORG Balkenende  ] is shepherding it through . 
Finance Minister [PER Bos  ] could still prove problematic , but working level contacts suggest he will be reasonable . 
As the [MISC Dutch  ] are fond of saying , " " do not disturb the brooding hen " " -- which we will no doubt hear often over the course of the summer and into the fall .
