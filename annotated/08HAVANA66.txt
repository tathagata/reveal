( C ) The participants spoke of their desire for freedom and democracy as well as the [MISC Cuban  ] people 's wish for improvements in their standard of living . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described the farcical atmosphere of a meeting in his neighbourhood where government officials in the runup to the elections scheduled for January 20 instructed people that they could mark up the ballot in any way they choose and it would be counted unless they wrote something like " Down with [PER Fidel  ] " on it . 
The participants would like to have real options in a range of things from the candidates in elections to the food they can purchase. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , however , made it clear that dissidents can't speak for the entire [MISC Cuban  ] people . 
In a subsequent discussion with [ORG POL  ] officer , she elaborated that it would be a mistake to underestimate the effectiveness of [ORG GOC  ] propaganda and the support the government has especially in poor communities and with some groups of University students . 
During the conference , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described how it is clear that senior state security officials are well aware of how they are manipulating information , but many of the young security agents actually believe that dissidents are potential terrorists . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG POL  ] officer that many people , especially outside [LOC Havana  ] , are convinced that dissidents are being paid to plot terrorist acts and sabotage . 
Rodriguez [PER del Toro  ] , [PER Sanchez  ] and [PER Juan Carlos Hernandez  ] are from [LOC Santiago de Cuba  ] .

( C ) In the conference , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] responded to questions about the attitude of the [MISC Cuban  ] people toward the [LOC United States  ] . 
She stated that years ago people tended to view both the government and the people of the [LOC United States  ] as hostile towards [LOC Cuba  ] . 
However , she now feels that even those who are suspicious of the [ORG Bush Administration  ] , tend to have much more positive feelings toward the [MISC American  ] people . 
She credits this to increased contact with actual [MISC Americans  ] . 
Some participants mentioned the confusion over the role of the [ORG Committee for Assistance  ] to a Free [LOC Cuba  ] ( [LOC CAFC  ] ) . 
They alluded to the [ORG GOC  ] 's propaganda campaign and a notorious billboard that reads " [MISC Plan Bush: No More Morning Kiss  ] " with a drawing of a mother not allowed to kiss her children as they head off for school . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reiterated to [ORG Pol  ] officer that even if [ORG GOC  ] propaganda seems preposterous , it is effective with large segments of the population which have with little access to alternative information. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also stated that often university students are afraid to speak to them although there is widespread support for the petition drive organized by E [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Frontiers  ] to demand the opening of private universities . 
She said that now almost all of the organization 's contact with university students is through third parties . 
She spoke of how after widespread protests in September , university students in [LOC Santiago de Cuba  ] felt emboldened because they achieved some improvements in their living conditions . 
However , protest activity has died down because students are afraid of expulsion . 
She indicated that there is still widespread discontent on campus on account of the dilapidated dormitories , the poor food , and the presence of many unqualified professors . 
A particular sore spot is the considerably better food and lodging provided to the foreign students . 
She said that [MISC Cuban  ] students are not even allowed to visit the dormitories of foreign students . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] often points out that the regime is well aware that all of the significant revolutions in [MISC Cuban  ] history started with student movements and that the [ORG GOC  ] keeps a close watch on what happens in the universities. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that on 15 January two plainclothes agents from state security came to his [LOC Havana  ] home and said that they knew he had participated in a video conference with SECCOM and wanted the names of the other participants . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that he was told to appear in court on 21 January but will not do so unless he receives an official written citation . 
All of the other participants state that after the video conference they have not been contacted to the police or [ORG GOC  ] officials . 
Rodriguez [PER del Toro  ] said that she expects that all the members of her group will be detained as soon as they arrive back in [LOC Santiago  ] .
