( C ) [ORG NSA  ] Hadley: Mission [LOC Germany  ] looks forward to welcoming you to [LOC Berlin  ] January 31 to February 1 . 
[LOC Germany  ] is currently consumed by the aftermath of bitterly fought state elections that took place on January 27 in [LOC Hesse  ] and [LOC Lower Saxony  ] . 
They are being seen as barometers for next year 's nationwide vote . 
Although the conservative [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDU  ] ) won comfortably in [LOC Lower Saxony  ] , the [ORG CDU  ] suffered a major setback in [LOC Hesse  ] , where [ORG CDU Minister-President  ] [PER Roland Koch  ] ran a divisive election campaign that took his party from a commanding lead in early polls to a virtual tie with the [ORG Social Democratic party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) . 
The country is also digesting the significance of the unexpected political gains by the ( neo-Communist ) [ORG Left Party  ] and its entry into both [LOC Hesse  ] and [LOC Lower Saxony  ] parliaments . 
Over the next several weeks , state and national politicians will evaluate coalition options , none of which appear to please any of the major parties . 
The [ORG CDU  ] 's poor showing in [LOC Hesse  ] could energize its competitors and lead to further domestic partisanship , thereby complicating Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] 's goal of solidifying the political center in advance of the 2009 national elections . 
On the other hand , the success of [ORG CDU Minister-President  ] [PER Christian Wulff  ] 's relatively low-key , centrist re-election campaign in [LOC Lower Saxony  ] has been seen as a vindication of [PER Merkel  ] 's domestic political strategy. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The outcome of these two state elections , and that of the February 24 Hamburg elections , will likely reverberate in the day-to-day functioning of the [MISC CDU-SPD  ] coalition . 
Already , [PER Merkel  ] 's conservatives and Foreign Minister [PER Frank-Walter Steinmeier  ] 's [MISC Social Democrats  ] resemble the proverbial couple that hated each other but stayed together for the sake of the children: the lack of any other viable coalition options is what sustains the partnership between the [MISC CDU/CSU  ] and the [ORG SPD  ] at this point . 
On key priorities like [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] ( and on certain aspects of [LOC Iran  ] ) , the gap between [PER Merkel  ] and [PER Steinmeier  ] is not so wide , and cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] has not been harmed by domestic politics . 
Differences are becoming more evident on some foreign policy issues however: [PER Steinmeier  ] 's January 17 meeting with [MISC Syrian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Muallem  ] , over strong opposition from the [ORG Chancellery  ] , is just the latest example . 
Increasingly , [PER Christoph Heusgen  ] and the [ORG Chancellery  ] 's small staff are being blindsided by the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] on policy matters that are significant but outside the spotlight . 
Overall , we can expect [PER Merkel  ] 's government to be more hamstrung by partisan and interagency rivalries between now and the fall of 2009 than was the case in its first two years in office. ------------------------------------ [PER Steinmeier  ] 's Evolving Political Role ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Steinmeier  ] , who came to office with a reputation as a technocrat , is increasingly a political rival to the Chancellor . 
Like most of his predecessors , he has benefited from the visibility conferred on the Foreign Minister . 
He has become the most popular [ORG SPD  ] politician in [LOC Germany  ] and the second most popular overall , trailing only [PER Merkel  ] . 
He recently was named Vice Chancellor , was elected as one of three national deputy chairmen of the [ORG SPD  ] , and announced he will run for a federal parliament seat in 2009 . 
[PER Steinmeier  ] is regarded , both within the [ORG SPD  ] and among the general public , as an attractive possible chancellor candidate in 2009 , should [ORG SPD  ] Chairman [PER Kurt Beck  ] stumble. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) With [PER Steinmeier  ] 's evolution from technocrat to political leader , he must cultivate much greater rank-and-file support within the [ORG SPD  ] . 
This is a particular challenge for him , because on domestic issues he is seen as relatively conservative . 
He was a key architect of [PER Gerhard Schroeder  ] 's economic reforms and stood by with a studied detachment as [PER Kurt Beck  ] and the [ORG SPD  ] 's left wing began to roll them back last fall . 
This is all the more reason for [PER Steinmeier  ] to seek out foreign policy issues like arms control and disarmament on which he can strike chords that resonate with [ORG SPD  ] voters ( regardless of the shortcomings we find in these ideas ) . 
Similarly , in policy toward [LOC Russia  ] , the former [MISC Soviet  ] republics , and the [LOC Middle East  ] , [PER Steinmeier  ] misses no opportunity to evoke the legacy of [PER Willy Brandt  ] , elevating dialog and economic engagement above open expression of disagreement as tools of diplomacy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) These internal factors amplify the tendency of [PER Steinmeier  ] and his [ORG Foreign Office  ] to pursue initiatives not in harmony with the Chancellor 's instincts or policy preferences . 
[LOC Germany  ] has a weak foreign policy coordination process and the [MISC German  ] constitution grants broad autonomy to ministers . 
Therefore , the ability of the Chancellor and her staff to rein in the [ORG Foreign Office  ] is limited . 
A result is that [LOC Germany  ] does not always speak with a single , clear voice. --------------------------------------------- IRAN: Importance of [ORG International Cooperation  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Although [PER Merkel  ] and the [ORG Chancellery  ] have more consistently toed our common firm line on [LOC Iran  ] , both the [ORG Chancellery  ] and the [ORG Foreign Office  ] are firmly committed to securing a third UNSCR sanctions resolution as a basis for more biting [ORG EU  ] autonomous measures . 
MFA officials called the January 22 P5 1 Ministerial a success in demonstrating unity among the members , both by producing a new [ORG UNSC  ] resolution text and by showing a unified strategic approach in dealing with [LOC Iran  ] . 
MFA officials have told us in private that [ORG EU  ] autonomous sanctions would not be discussed at the January 28-29 GAERC . 
In conversations prior to January 22 , [MISC German  ] officials have emphasized the importance of the broadest possible international coalition , and thus highly value efforts to keep all members of the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] on board , deploying this argument when approached about either unilateral or [ORG EU  ] autonomous measures . 
However , they point to pressures from their business community ( as well as from the [ORG Finance  ] and [ORG Economics Ministries  ] ) as constraints on adopting stronger unilateral action against the [MISC Iranian  ] regime . 
Privately , senior officials in the [ORG Chancellery  ] and [ORG Foreign Office  ] have expressed frustration that the [ORG NIE  ] has complicated international diplomatic efforts . 
On December 4 , FM [PER Steinmeier  ] said the [ORG NIE  ] on [LOC Iran  ] offered the chance " inject new momentum " into the nuclear negotiations and called on all sides not to squander this opportunity . 
[PER Merkel  ] said publicly on January 15 that the [ORG NIE  ] had slowed the momentum behind further [ORG UN  ] sanctions ; she simultaneously underscored the seriousness of [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear activities and the need for international solidarity. ---------------------------------------- AFGHANISTAN: Need for Broader Deployment ---------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Encouraging greater [MISC German  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is a key priority of [LOC Mission Germany  ] ; we have made some progress , but the [MISC Germans  ] remain very reluctant about deploying combat forces outside of the [LOC North  ] . 
In advance of the April [LOC NATO Summit  ] , [LOC Germany  ] will increase its involvement in the training of the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] and will probably agree to take over responsibility for the 150-man quick reaction force ( [ORG QRF  ] ) in the north . 
We should welcome the [ORG QRF  ] decision , because it would represent the first [MISC German  ] [ORG ISAF  ] contingent deployable on short notice ( including possibly in exceptional and temporary circumstances outside the north ) , which would be a qualitatively new and significant step toward greater involvement in kinetic operations . 
Secretary [PER Gates'  ] recent written request to Defense Minister [PER Jung  ] to deploy [MISC German  ] Special Operations Forces ( [ORG SOF  ] ) under [ORG ISAF  ] in the south of [LOC Afghanistan  ] is likely to be very controversial here , but may prove acceptable in the end if , in return , we were to offer [LOC Germany  ] the option of ending its current offer of [ORG SOF  ] for [ORG OEF  ] . 
Moving the [MISC German  ] [ORG SOF  ] commitment from [ORG OEF  ] to [ORG ISAF  ] would also have the benefit of allowing us to shift the considerable diplomatic resources and attention we devoted last fall to getting the [MISC German  ] [ORG OEF  ] mandate renewed to activities that may yield more practical benefits , such as pressing [LOC Germany  ] to increase its contributions to [LOC ISAF.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) We should encourage greater [MISC German  ] leadership in the [ORG EUPOL  ] effort to train [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's civilian police force . 
[ORG EUPOL  ] is led by [MISC German  ] [PER Juergen Scholz  ] , and [LOC Germany  ] contributes more police trainers than any other [ORG EU  ] country , but the program has been slow to start and the planned ceiling of 195 [ORG EU  ] police trainers is inadequate for the job . 
Furthermore , activities are not currently planned at the district level where the need is greatest . 
[LOC Germany  ] should be urged to accelerate the deployment of [ORG EU  ] trainers to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , increase the number of trainers , and broaden the geographic range of activities. ------------------------ [ORG RUSSIA: Split Approaches  ] ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) There are significant differences between the [ORG Chancellery  ] and the [ORG Foreign Office  ] on [LOC Russia  ] , which invites [MISC Russian  ] wedge-driving . 
[PER Merkel  ] has never shied away from plain talk about disturbing trends inside [LOC Russia  ] . 
[PER Steinmeier  ] was the first foreign visitor to get a meeting with presidential candidate [PER Medvedev  ] after his nomination ( a meeting with President [PER Putin  ] was thrown in as well ) . 
Lately , the combination of [MISC Russian  ] CFE suspension , backsliding on democracy , and intransigence on [LOC Kosovo  ] has pushed even some in the [ORG SPD  ] to offer criticism . 
Still , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] will likely continue to seek an unhelpful bridging role with [LOC Russia  ] , in particular on CFE and other matters related to arms control . 
The [ORG Chancellery  ] can help constrain these impulses , but we will also need to keep up pressure among the [ORG Quad  ] partners as well as from other key allies ( e.g . 
[LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Norway  ] ) to make clear that [MISC German  ] unilateral initiatives put transatlantic solidarity at risk. ------------------------- [ORG KOSOVO: Close Cooperation  ] ------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We discern very little daylight between the Chancellor and [PER Steinmeier  ] on [LOC Kosovo  ] , and there is keen interest in working closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] to resolve status and seal the [ORG EU  ] 's leadership role . 
While the [MISC Bundestag  ] will engage in intensive debate following an anticipated coordinated declaration of independence , we expect the multiparty consensus in favor of independence and the [ORG KFOR  ] and ESDP missions to hold. ------------------------------------- [ORG COUNTERTERRORISM: Building  ] on Success ------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Your visit comes at a time when [MISC U.S.-German  ] bilateral cooperation on security issues is as close as it has ever been . 
The successful cooperation surrounding the September 4 arrests of three individuals planning large-scale attacks and the upcoming conclusion of a new bilateral agreement on fingerprint , DNA and other data sharing are the latest evidence of this trend . 
Furthermore , no [MISC German  ] senior official pushes as hard , or argues so publicly , for closer bilateral cooperation on security issues as Interior Minister [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] . 
Should the opportunity arise , you should inform [MISC German  ] officials that we are eager to build on our successful record of counterterrorism cooperation and explore how we might work together to address threats such as [MISC European  ] residents who seek terrorist training at overseas camps and become jihadists in [LOC Iraq  ] or [LOC Afghanistan.  ] ---------------------------- [ORG ECONOMICS: Commitment  ] to [ORG TEC  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Merkel  ] highly values the [MISC U.S.-EU Transatlantic Economic Council  ] ( [ORG TEC  ] ) -- a centerpiece of her 2007 [ORG EU  ] presidency -- aimed at reducing regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade and investment . 
She is concerned , however , about maintaining the momentum in the [ORG TEC  ] and fears that the [ORG European Commission  ] and future [ORG EU  ] presidencies ( including [LOC France  ] ) may lose enthusiasm for the project . 
[MISC German  ] officials also worry that a changing [ORG U.S. Administration  ] could derail what they regard as a highly successful new transatlantic economic instrument ; we should emphasize our continued commitment to the [ORG TEC  ] , and encourage the [MISC Germans  ] to maintain a leading role in it . 
The [MISC German  ] economy is expected to grow at only 1.7 percent this year . 
Previous higher estimates were lowered due to rising oil prices , the strength of the [MISC Euro  ] , slower [LOC U.S.  ] growth , and continuing turmoil in financial markets . 
[MISC German  ] economists and business leaders are also worried about the possibility of a national minimum wage as well as increased labor union demands for wage increases , both of which could affect the economy adversely . 
[PER Merkel  ] plans to highlight employment gains -- as opposed to minimum wages -- as the focus of her economic plan looking ahead to the 2009 national elections. ----------------------------------- CLIMATE CHANGE: Aggressive Measures ----------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and the rest of [LOC Germany  ] 's political leadership remain serious about pursuing aggressive international measures to meet the challenges of global warming . 
[PER Merkel  ] has made climate change a priority of her Chancellorship and enjoys the overwhelming domestic support on this . 
[PER Merkel  ] 's support for mandatory , targeted global limits on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions and an international cap-and-trade regime reflects a deep-seated belief that only drastic , concerted efforts on the part of the international community can slow -- and ultimately reverse -- the human contribution to global warming . 
If anything , [PER Steinmeier  ] supports tougher standards . 
While the [MISC Germans  ] have been willing to consider alternative solutions , such as new technologies for clean coal and renewables , fundamental differences in our approaches to the issue of climate change remain , and could lead to more public disagreement in the future . 
For example , while [LOC Germany  ] will send a delegation to the January 30 [MISC Major Economies Meeting  ] ( [ORG MEM  ] ) , the [MISC German  ] Government remains skeptical about the value that the [MISC Major Economies Process  ] ( [ORG MEP  ] ) adds to the [ORG UNFCCC  ] track . 
The [MISC Germans  ] are particularly concerned about the need to avoid duplication of effort in the various other climate change-related forums , including the [ORG UNFCCC  ] and the [MISC G-8  ] .
