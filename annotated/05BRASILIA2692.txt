End summary . 
RED SEPTEMBER ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) During the week of September 26 , approximately 15,000 members of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Landless Movement  ] ( O Movimento dos [PER Sem Terra/MST  ] ) launched " Red September , " a series of land occupations , demonstrations , and press conferences to pressure President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's government to devote more resources to agrarian reform , and to fulfill his 2002 campaign promise to settle 400,000 landless families by 2006 . 
Other [ORG MST  ] demands include greater [ORG GOB  ] funding for family farming and the creation of a special credit program for resettled families. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to the [ORG MST  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] resettled 11,000 families last year , and between January and August of this year , the [ORG GOB  ] resettled 4,000 families . 
Ministry of [ORG Agrarian Reform Executive  ] Secretary [PER Guilherme Cassel  ] disputed the [ORG MST  ] 's statistics by claiming that the [ORG GOB  ] resettled more than 50,000 families this year . 
[PER Cassel  ] admitted that the resettlement process has been slow , but blamed the delay on [ORG MST  ] families who failed to provide basic identification information , such as [MISC Brazilian  ] social security numbers , after being selected for resettlement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) During the week , the [ORG MST  ] occupied 26 [ORG National Institute for Colonization and Land Reform  ] ( [ORG INCRA  ] ) buildings , 13 [ORG Banco do Brasil  ] agencies , and seven toll bridges in 20 states . 
The [ORG MST  ] announced on September 27 that it would continue land and building occupations until the [ORG GOB  ] met the group 's demands . 
The group regularly employs the tactic of occupying farmland by hundreds of landless families until the government cedes title . 
In recent years , the [ORG MST  ] has become more belligerent and more likely to invade government buildings , farms , or land owned by multinationals . 
[ORG MST  ] INVADES AMERICAN OWNED FARM ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On September 25 , [ORG AgroReservas  ] do [LOC Brazil  ] , an American-owned farm , was invaded by 300-500 [ORG MST  ] members who moved into employees' homes , blocked access roads , cut down trees , and demanded 10,000 hectares of the property 's farmable land . 
The 70,000 hectare farm is owned by the [ORG Farm Management Company  ] in [LOC Salt Lake City  ] , [LOC Utah  ] , and employs 300 [MISC Brazilians  ] and four [MISC Americans  ] . 
Although farm employees have not been able to access the housing area since the invasion began , they have been able to feed 7,000 cattle by entering the farm through neighboring farms , the farm 's manager [PER Macedo Genevil  ] told [ORG Embassy Agricultural Attache  ] . 
According to [PER Genevil  ] , military police officials have confined the [ORG MST  ] to the housing area on the property , and farming equipment has not been damaged. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Minas Gerais  ] state government has agreed to send an undisclosed number of military police to the farm , but before the police can be mobilized , a state judge must issue an eviction order against the [ORG MST  ] . 
During the week of September 26 , the state judge decided to negotiate with [ORG MST  ] leaders before issuing an eviction order , and [LOC Minas Gerais  ] military police agreed to remain on the farm until the negotiations have concluded . 
A Police Commander told [ORG Embassy Legal Attache  ] on September 30 that the judicial process to evict the [ORG MST  ] could be lengthy , and labor union laws and inadequate staffing may require the state government to cease police protection in the near future. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Genevil  ] subsequently told [ORG Embassy Agricultural Attache  ] that the judge who wanted to negotiate with the [ORG MST  ] has been replaced by a " new , more reasonable judge . 
" [PER Genevil  ] sounded pleased with this decision and believed that an eviction order would be issued during the week of October 10 . 
According to [PER Genevil  ] , the police will remain on the property until after farm managers meet with the military police chief to request a one week extension for police protection on October 5 . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG AgroReservas  ] is one of the largest and most technically advanced farms in [LOC Brazil  ] , and the [ORG Foreign Agricultural Service  ] often takes visitors such as the [ORG American Farmers Union  ] and the [MISC American  ] Farm Bureau to the farm to show the scale of farm operations in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
This invasion marks the first time that the [ORG MST  ] has occupied an [MISC American  ] farm , and while the invasion of the farm causes concern , post does not believe that the invasion was linked to the farm 's connections to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG Embassy Agricultural Attache  ] believes that [ORG AgroReservas  ] was targeted because the farm is one of the largest and most profitable farms in the state . 
If this conflict is resolved quickly , post believes that the farm will sustain only nominal damage to homes and other items on the property . 
However , if the judicial process delays eviction of the [ORG MST  ] and police protection ceases , the farm will remain unattended , leaving the farming system and its profits in jeopardy .
