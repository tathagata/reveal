( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Greg Manuel  ] of the [ORG Department of State  ] and [PER Sarah Ladislaw  ] from the [ORG Department of Energy  ] ( [ORG DoE  ] ) , accompanied by [PER Matthew Golden  ] and [PER Morgan Perkins  ] from [LOC Mission Brazil  ] , met with the [ORG MFA  ] 's [PER U/S Patriota  ] and Minister [PER Antonio Simoes  ] , on September 5 , to discuss bilateral , biofuel cooperation . 
The meeting provided [PER Manuel  ] and [PER Ladislaw  ] an opportunity to lay out the [ORG USG  ] 's global three-tiered biofuel strategy and to present options for future high-level meetings between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GoB  ] . 
On the flip side , the meeting revealed that the [ORG MFA  ] is no longer responsible for the [ORG GoB  ] 's international biofuel policy and , moreover , that the [ORG GoB  ] is reorganizing the government 's biofuel hierarchy . 
The meeting was held on the margins of the [MISC Ethanol Forum  ] meeting on September 5 ( reported septel ) . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Manuel  ] opened the meeting by articulating the [ORG USG  ] 's plan for bilateral biofuel cooperation . 
The program is three-pronged and involves science and technology collaboration , third-market development ( to catalyze production and scale ) and the [ORG Global Ethanol Forum  ] . 
He proceeded to identify third-market development targets in the [LOC Western Hemisphere  ] , including [LOC Haiti  ] , the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] and [LOC St. Kitts  ] in the [LOC Caribbean  ] ; [LOC Guatemala  ] and [LOC El Salvador  ] in [LOC Central America  ] ; and [LOC Colombia  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] in [LOC South America  ] . 
[LOC St. Kitts  ] , he emphasized , due to the island 's size , geography and existing infrastructure make it an ideal choice to create a successful pilot on which to base other third-market interventions . 
Following on this rationale , the [ORG Department ,  ] according to [PER Manuel  ] , split the choices regionally to maintain an independent focus and to keep from pinning success on any one region or any one country . 
In closing , [PER Manuel  ] underscored the urgency of the matter for the [ORG USG  ] and noted the importance of obtaining a sense of commitment from [LOC Brazil  ] at the earliest possible opportunity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Ladislaw  ] then provided the background for the partnership 's proposed S&T element . 
She explained that the [ORG DoE  ] is one of the principal [ORG USG  ] organizations in terms of biofuel R&D , and described the [ORG USG  ] 's desire to compare how the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] approach both biofuel research and resource allocation . 
[PER Ladislaw  ] suggested utilizing the [MISC DoE-MME  ] ( [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] ) [ORG Energy Working Group  ] to begin sharing technical data and further espoused the crossover with the [MISC NIST-INMETRO  ] partnership to develop biofuel standards . 
[PER Ladislaw  ] noted that the [ORG DoE  ] had already contacted the [ORG MME  ] 's [PER Rubens Barbosa  ] to find an appropriate date for the [ORG Energy Working Group  ] to meet. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Patriota  ] responded noncommittally stating that the [ORG GoB  ] would take these ideas under consideration . 
He also noted , revealing a certain degree of caution , that the [ORG MFA  ] would have to vet the proposals through the [MISC Casa Civil  ] , which would affect the response . 
He clarified that the [ORG GoB  ] 's own interagency working group had met for the first time the previous Friday and was only just beginning to detail its list of activities . 
[PER Patriota  ] also let slip that [PER Lula  ] 's Chief of Staff , [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , is planning to reorganize the structure of the biofuel policy-making apparatus and would create a new [ORG Biofuel Council  ] ; although , the exact make-up was yet to be determined . 
Although this will affect the [ORG MFA  ] 's agenda , [PER Patriota  ] surmised that the [ORG GoB  ] agrees , at least in concept , to the [ORG USG  ] 's proposed ideas ; he emphasized the [ORG GoB  ] 's current ethanol development initiatives in [LOC Jamaica  ] and [LOC Barbados.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In terms of the countries [PER Manuel  ] identified , [PER Patriota  ] confirmed that [LOC Haiti  ] is a huge priority for the [ORG GoB  ] and , being open and frank , noted that [LOC Brazil  ] would find it much easier to cooperate in [LOC Central America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] than in [LOC South America  ] . 
He explained that the myriad of [MISC South American  ] regional integration activities and the resultant sensitivities involved would make it extremely difficult for [LOC Brazil  ] to partner with the [LOC U.S.  ] in the region . 
However , he proclaimed that [LOC Guatemala  ] and [LOC St. Kitts  ] would be well received , and believed that while [LOC El Salvador  ] was not a [ORG GoB  ] priority it was geopolitically benign . 
[PER Simoes  ] summed up that [LOC Brazil  ] , like the [LOC U.S.  ] , would need to determine the countries it was interested in geopolitically , run feasibility studies to assess individual situations and then coordinate with the [ORG USG  ] to determine what assets each country could bring to the table. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In addition to the aforementioned themes , discussions also touched on high-level meeting opportunities . 
Both sides took note of the [MISC Rice-Amorim  ] meeting scheduled for September 23 at [LOC UNGA  ] . 
[PER Manuel  ] also presented [PER U/S Shiner  ] 's desire to meet with [PER Patriota  ] sometime in October or November . 
The discussion also highlighted the need for the [ORG GoB  ] to deconflict the [MISC Ethanol Forum  ] with [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG GBEP  ] ( Global Bioenergy [ORG Partnership  ] ) . 
[PER Patriota  ] agreed that the [ORG GoB  ] and [ORG GoI  ] should work together to ensure that the [MISC Ethanol Forum  ] and [ORG GBEP  ] did not have competing agendas . 
He promised that the [ORG GoB  ] would [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001933 002.2 OF 002 raise the issue with [LOC Italy  ] at the earliest opportunity . 
( [PER Note: Earlier  ] in the day , [PER Simoes  ] stated that [LOC Brazil  ] had not been invited to join [ORG GBEP  ] ) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The meeting provided two definitive outcomes . 
It clearly illustrated the [ORG MFA  ] 's interest in pursuing a coopertive , bilateral relationship with the [ORG USG  ] to promote biofuels . 
Simultaneously , it demonstrated that [ORG Itamaraty  ] is not in charge of [LOC Brazil  ] 's domestic or international biofuel policy . 
That responsibility lies with the [MISC Casa Civil  ] and [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] . 
Future entreaties to cooperation and attempts to influence policy should include the [MISC Casa Civil  ] . 
In the interim , despite pleas for an expeditious answer , it is extremely unlikely that the [ORG GoB  ] will assent to cooperate prior to its October elections and , after these , until its biofuel policy matrix is organized .
