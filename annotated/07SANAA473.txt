( [ORG S  ] ) On March 27 , [MISC Yemeni  ] military officers discovered an unmanned USG reconnaissance aircraft ( [ORG Scan Eagle  ] ) that had washed ashore on the [LOC Arabian Sea  ] coast in the province of [LOC Hadramaut  ] . 
The President 's Office immediately protested the incident to [ORG CDA  ] and requested an explanation . 
Initially unaware of any USG operations in the area , Post learned after further inquiry that the reconnaissance aircraft belonged to the [PER U.S.S. Ashland  ] , which had been patrolling as part of [MISC CTF-150  ] , 60 nautical miles off the [MISC Yemeni  ] coast . 
The aircraft had crashed in international waters on March 17 and had not been recovered. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On March 28 , [ORG CDA  ] spoke with President [PER Saleh  ] ( who was attending the [ORG Arab League  ] summit in [LOC Riyadh  ] ) via telephone and confirmed that the aircraft belonged to the [LOC U.S.  ] Navy . 
He assured [PER Saleh  ] that the plane crashed performing routine reconnaissance near the ship and had not been operating in [MISC Yemeni  ] territory . 
[ORG CDA  ] also met separately with Interior Minister [PER Rashad Alimi  ] and [PER Ammar Saleh  ] , Deputy Director of the [ORG National Security Bureau  ] , and presented both with general information on the aircraft. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Saleh  ] expressed doubt as to the plane 's actual mission , but promised [ORG CDA  ] that the [ORG ROYG  ] would not " turn this into an international incident " and would instruct government officials not to comment . 
On March 29 , official and pro-government media sources reported that the [MISC Yemeni  ] military had shot down an [MISC Iranian  ] " spy plane " off the coast of [LOC Hadramaut  ] , after communicating with " multinational forces " in the region . 
Independent daily [MISC Al-Ayam  ] ( largest circulating independent newspaper ) , quoted an unnamed [MISC Yemeni  ] military official as confirming that the plane belonged to the [MISC American  ] government , but would not comment on whether the plane was shot down or discovered after crashing. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: President [PER Saleh  ] clearly believes the unmanned aircraft had been performing reconnaissance in [MISC Yemeni  ] territory when it crashed . 
He could have taken the opportunity to score political points by appearing tough in public against the [LOC United States  ] , but chose instead to blame [LOC Iran  ] . 
No doubt focused on the unrest in [LOC Saada  ] and our support for the transfer of excess armored personnel carriers from neighboring countries ( reftel ) , [PER Saleh  ] decided he would benefit more from painting [LOC Iran  ] as the bad guy in this case .
