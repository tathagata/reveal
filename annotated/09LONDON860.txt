( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Special Representative for [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] Ambassador [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] met April 3 with [ORG British Conservative Party  ] leader [PER David Cameron  ] and Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne  ] to offer an overview of USG policy in the region and to urge [ORG HMG  ] ( under possible future [ORG Conservative  ] leadership ) to engage more on [LOC Pakistan  ] and to use [MISC British  ] influence more effectively to help tackle corruption , underpin democratic institutions and civil society , as well as encourage greater [MISC Pakistani  ] military attention to its western border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Cameron  ] characterized the large population of [MISC British  ] Pakistanis with strong expatriate ties to their home country as not pro-Taliban but certainly radicalized by the [LOC Iraq  ] war and militant about [LOC Kashmir  ] ; he also criticized HMG’s counter-radicalization strategy with [LOC UK  ] [MISC Muslims  ] . 
[PER Cameron  ] agreed that [ORG HMG  ] needed to get [MISC UK-Pakistan  ] relations “right” and broadly agreed that any request to a [MISC Conservative-led  ] [LOC UK  ] government for [MISC British  ] troop increases in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would likely find the [MISC Conservatives  ] , in line with their current policy , receptive but seeking conditions . 
End summary . 
[LOC UK  ] Should Play a Larger Role ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Special Representative Ambassador [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] discussed [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] policy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] April 3 with [ORG Conservative Party  ] leader [PER David Cameron  ] and Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne  ] . 
Charge and [PER Poloff McNicholas  ] attended the meeting , as did Cameron’s Chief of Staff [PER Ed Llewellyn  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] gave an overview of the challenges that the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] faced in the region and stressed the need to pay more critical attention to [LOC Pakistan  ] in order for us collectively to combat terrorism and radicalization and to strengthen democratic institutions there . 
Noting the striking connections between the UK’s large [MISC Pakistani  ] community and its home country ( e.g. , the large number of flights and remittances between the two countries and abiding ties between families/communities in the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] ) and the strong influence [LOC Britain  ] continues to enjoy in [LOC Islamabad  ] , Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] urged [PER Cameron  ] to capitalize on this -- should the [MISC Conservatives  ] come into power -- and exercise a stronger role for the [LOC UK  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] had played a positive role in the recent [MISC Zardari-Sharif  ] crisis and there were more opportunities for the [LOC UK  ] to examine its relationship with [LOC Pakistan  ] and use its influence more effectively . 
One means , [PER Holbrooke  ] said , was to focus on increasing [LOC UK  ] assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] stressed that the fight against corruption in [LOC Pakistan  ] was critical as average Pakistanis considered corrupt leaders more of a concern than the [MISC Taliban.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Additionally , [PER Holbrooke  ] underscored that it was crucial for [LOC Pakistan  ] to focus troops on its western border region ; after the [LOC Mumbai  ] terrorist attack the [MISC GOP  ] had shifted 7,000 troops east to the border with [LOC India  ] and had not yet redeployed them to tackle the more serious cross-border activity on the border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He added that one objective of his and [ORG Admiral Mullen’s  ] trip was to chip away at the mistrust between the two countries . 
[LOC UK  ] [MISC Pakistani  ] Community: Not [MISC Taliban  ] , but Radicalized --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Cameron  ] , whose [ORG Conservative Party  ] currently has a significant lead in [LOC UK  ] opinion polls ( see reftel ) , indicated that his foreign affairs team was thinking constructively about [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] and preparing a [ORG Conservative  ] government policy for the region . 
He and his shadow cabinet were focused on asking “constructive” questions in [LOC Parliament  ] , and his party was keenly interested in President Obama’s strategy for the region . 
[PER Cameron  ] noted that most of the approximately one million [LOC UK  ] citizens of [MISC Pakistani  ] origin ( mostly [MISC Punjabis  ] and Kashmiris ) living in the [LOC UK  ] were not pro-Taliban but had been radicalized by the [LOC Iraq  ] war and were militant over [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
The [ORG Conservative Party  ] leader agreed that [ORG HMG  ] “must get [MISC UK-Pakistan  ] relations right” and stressed the Conservatives’ commitment to this goal should they assume power in the next election. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) On the radicalization of [MISC British  ] Pakistanis , [PER Cameron  ] said the [LOC UK  ] had “gotten it wrong domestically , ” and was critical of the [LOC UK  ] government’s “Prevent” counter-radicalization pillar ( part of HMG’s broader CONTEST counterterrorism strategy ) . 
He argued that PM Brown’s policy had been too willing to engage with radicalized but non-violent [MISC Muslim  ] groups . 
[PER Cameron  ] argued that there should be no difference and that both groups should be treated the same and sanctioned if they advocated violence. “We let in some crazies , ” [PER Cameron  ] said , “and didn’t wake up soon enough.” [PER Cameron  ] singled out XXXXXXXXXXXX as groups that the government should not be dealing with as conduits to the [MISC Muslim  ] communities . 
[MISC Conservatives  ] Would [MISC Entertain More UK Troops  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Cameron  ] said that if the [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Australians  ] were to reduce their military presence in 2011 , the [MISC Conservatives  ] ( when in government ) could be expected to fashion a policy along the lines of the questions they had been posing to PM Brown in [LOC Parliament  ] ; that is , to be responsive to requests for increased troops if other conditions were addressed , such as the provision for more helicopters and a clear strategy for continued [LOC UK  ] engagement in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] cleared this cable .
