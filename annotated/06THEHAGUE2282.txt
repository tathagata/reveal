( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bernard Bot  ] 's upcoming visit to [LOC Washington DC  ] comes just one month before national elections . 
It therefore provides an excellent opportunity to move some difficult issues forward in a way that helps ensure that the next [MISC Dutch  ] government , whatever its configuration , comes into office on a positive note with regard to the bilateral relationship . 
Although we have had , and will continue to have , differences with the [MISC Dutch  ] on a variety of issues , they remain one of our staunchest allies in continental [LOC Europe  ] , willing to put their credibility , resources , and even troops on the line again and again to support transatlantic objectives . 
[PER Bot  ] 's support was critical in the [MISC Dutch  ] decisions to deploy troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , to participate in [LOC UNIFIL  ] , and to provide significant assistance to [LOC Darfur  ] . 
He has also been an outspoken advocate of tougher measures to restrain [MISC North Korean  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear ambitions , and is a strong supporter of our goals for the 2006 [ORG NATO  ] summit. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The current government 's close ties to the [LOC U.S.  ] have not been without cost to the coalition government or to [PER Bot  ] personally . 
Parliamentary and public concerns about Guantanamo/Detainee issues , in particular , have put [PER Bot  ] in the uncomfortable position of having to defend the bilateral relationship in Parliament while carrying out explicit parliamentary instructions to criticize [LOC U.S.  ] policies at every opportunity . 
[PER John Bellinger  ] 's successful visit here October 10-11 helped shift our bilateral discussions in a more positive direction , and [PER Bot  ] has expressed strong interest in continuing the dialogue ; we need to move quickly to exploit this opening to support our broader efforts to influence [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC European  ] opinion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In addition to his meeting with you , [PER Bot  ] has meetings with Sen. [PER Chuck Hagel  ] , Deputy [PER NSA Crouch  ] , and Deputy Secretary of [LOC Defense England  ] on Oct. 23 . 
He will also give a SIPDIS press conference and attend a dinner hosted by the [ORG American Enterprise Institute  ] on transatlantic relations . 
On Oct. 24 , [PER Bot  ] will meet with Deputy [PER NSA Eliott Abrams  ] , deliver a speech at [ORG Georgetown University  ] on [ORG Saving Democracy  ] in a [MISC World of Change  ] , and attend a lunch at the [MISC Dutch  ] ambassador 's residence on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
While [LOC Afghanistan  ] , Guantanamo/Detainee issues , and the upcoming [LOC Riga  ] summit will be the main items on his agenda , [PER Bot  ] will also be interested in hearing about your recent visit to the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
This cable contains brief summaries of the current state of play of these and several other issues -- [MISC North Korea/Iran  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] , [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] , and [ORG Law Enforcement  ] cooperation -- as viewed from The [ORG Hague  ] . 
Overview -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] comes against the backdrop of the November 22 national elections , in which [PER Bot  ] 's governing [ORG Christian Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) has recently pulled from behind to run neck-in-neck with the opposition [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) . 
Regardless of which party gains the most seats in the next parliament , the next [MISC Dutch  ] government -- like all previous [MISC Dutch  ] governments -- will be a coalition , probably containing at least one of the current government 's two center-right parties ( [ORG CDA  ] and [ORG VVD  ] ) , either governing together or individually in partnership with the [ORG PvdA  ] . 
For that reason alone , it is clear that many of the current government 's policies will continue . 
In the heat of a hotly contested campaign , however , opposition candidates will continue to exploit perceived weaknesses in the [MISC Bot/Balkenende  ] foreign policy for political gain , and [PER Bot  ] will feel compelled to respond -- sometimes in ways that appear unnecessarily critical of the [LOC U.S.  ] While we enjoy excellent working relations with the [MISC Dutch  ] on a wide range of issues around the world -- including , most obviously , in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- we should not underestimate the level of public frustration with [LOC U.S.  ] policies or the current government 's hyper-sensitivity to criticism from a volatile and divided electorate. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] could retain the Foreign Minister portfolio in any future coalition government in which [ORG CDA  ] is a partner . 
Although [PER Bot  ] wants the job , however , he faces stiff competition , including from within his own party , as [ORG Maxim  ] THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00002282 002 OF 004 Verhagen , the [ORG CDA  ] 's leader in parliament , is also a prime contender . 
[PER Bot  ] is actively using visits such as this one to demonstrate his value to his party and the general electorate . 
By choosing not to stand for parliament personally , he may also hope to remain somewhat above politics in order to make himself more attractive to potential coalition partners . 
Even if it turns out to be a last hurrah , a successful visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] at this moment is important to [PER Bot  ] personally , to the [MISC Balkenende  ] government , and for the bilateral relationship in general . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite a contentious parliamentary debate last winter and low public support , the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment to [LOC Uruzgan  ] as part of [ORG NATO  ] 's [ORG ISAF III  ] mission has not emerged as a difficult election issue for the current government -- at least not yet . 
In retrospect , the lengthy debate , in which the [ORG PvdA  ] ultimately voted in favor of the deployment despite serious reservations , effectively neutralized most serious critics of the mission early and locked all the major parties into supportive positions . 
In an effort to destroy this consensus , opposition parties to the left of [ORG Labor  ] , notably GreenLeft and the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , have argued noisily that the [ORG GONL  ] has failed in its promise to maintain a clear line between [ORG ISAF  ] and OEF operations , and that the focus of the mission has shifted from reconstruction -- which the public largely supports -- to a far more controversial combat mission . 
So far , however , [ORG PvdA  ] politicians have not taken the bait , and the [ORG GONL  ] has effectively countered these charges by stressing that a secure environment is necessary for any effective reconstruction effort , and that [MISC Dutch  ] military forces are fully prepared to deal with the challenges they face. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , the [MISC Dutch  ] have performed well in the field , engaging and killing the enemy . 
That said , the [MISC Dutch  ] continue to place a higher emphasis on hearts and minds reconstruction efforts than on the hunt for terrorists -- combat missions have been largely reactive instead of proactive . 
They are set to take over regional command in the south in November . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have not suffered any casualties as a result of enemy fire -- an [MISC F-16  ] crash and apparent suicide are the only casualties thus far . 
Some speculate a high casualty count might put [LOC Afghanistan  ] back in play for the elections . 
FM Bot should be congratulated and encouraged for the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment and performance in [LOC Uruzgan  ] as they continue to punch above their weight . 
[PER Bot  ] most likely will raise increased security along the [MISC Pakistani  ] border . 
Detainees/Guantanamo -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) This is perhaps the most difficult issue in our bilateral relationship right now . 
All major parties , including the [ORG CDA  ] , condemned the recent revelations of secret prisons and continue to demand that [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] be closed -- without offering credible alternatives . 
[PER Bot  ] has been at the center of this particular storm , repeatedly called to testify before Parliament to defend the bilateral relationship in the face of the widely-shared perception that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not abiding by international law -- an especially sensitive issue for the [MISC Dutch  ] , who are proud of The [ORG Hague  ] 's traditional role as the preeminent center of international law -- and ignoring the concerns of allies . 
[PER Bot  ] has received explicit instructions from Parliament to raise detainee issues bilaterally and in international fora including the [ORG EU  ] GAERC and [ORG NATO  ] NAC ; he has done so with a vigor bordering on obsession . 
That said , a recent visit to The [ORG Hague  ] by [PER John Bellinger  ] and other senior officials appears to have made modest inroads into [PER Bot  ] 's thinking. and he now supports continuing a serious dialogue to find legally viable , long term solutions to the detainee issue , including revisiting portions of the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] . 
Since [PER Bot  ] expects to speak publicly about the issue during his visit , it would be useful to re-emphasize in your meeting with him that the [ORG Military Commissions Act  ] provides every detainee in [LOC Guantanamo  ] some means of judicial review and that the secret prisons remain subject to [ORG Congressional  ] oversight and [LOC U.S.  ] law . 
[LOC NATO/Riga Summit  ] ---------------- THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00002282 003 OF 004 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG GONL  ] for the most part agrees with our [ORG Riga Summit  ] goals , including especially the need to demonstrate progress in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have been supporters of our global partnership initiative , although they have previously expressed concern that building stronger ties with security providers might create first- and second-class partnerships at the expense of security consumers . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] strongly support a single tool box from which all interested parties might seek to enhance ties with [ORG NATO  ] . 
They are conscious of other [MISC Allied  ] concerns -- notably [LOC France  ] -- regarding the use of global terminology . 
They advise at [LOC Riga  ] an understated and fact-oriented approach to [ORG NATO  ] 's role as a global player to garner [MISC French  ] support for initiative. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] also are with us when it comes to the nuts and bolts for [LOC Riga  ] -- it 's the whither [ORG NATO  ] question that causes consternation . 
They support various military capability enhancement initiatives , including the [MISC C-17  ] consortium , the special operations center , and the [LOC Middle East  ] training center , and eventually supported [ORG Intensified Dialogue  ] ( [LOC ID  ] ) for [LOC Georgia  ] . 
That said , the [MISC Dutch  ] are concerned about the direction of [ORG NATO  ] and remain leery of enlargement plans . 
While the [ORG MFA  ] working level has been supportive of [LOC Croatia  ] 's membership aspirations , [PER Bot  ] and Political Director [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] believe the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] are expanding too quickly . 
They have called for an [MISC Allied  ] existential discussion to determine [ORG NATO  ] 's path , both at [LOC Riga  ] and at subsequent summits in 2008 and 2009 . 
Following the President 's recent announcement , [PER Bot  ] 's visit provides an excellent opportunity to make a pitch for [MISC Croatian  ] [ORG NATO  ] membership at the 2008 summit . 
[LOC Lebanon/Middle East Peace Process ---------------------------------  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] are contributing a 150-person frigate as part of the maritime component of [ORG UNIFIL  ] . 
But [ORG MFA  ] Head of [LOC Middle Eastern Affairs Henriette  ] van [LOC Lynden-Leijten  ] told Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] October 17 the [MISC Dutch  ] are taking a step-by-step approach to the [LOC Middle East  ] , especially regarding [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] , to determine where the [MISC Dutch  ] might have value added . 
This involves a review of possible options , including better cooperation with the [LOC Middle East Quartet  ] , more meetings with moderate [MISC Arab  ] states , and better definitions of end goals . 
She added , however , that [MISC Dutch  ] influence over [LOC Syria  ] has been clouded by a contentious custody case involving two [MISC Dutch-Syrian  ] children currently encamped at the [MISC Dutch  ] embassy in [LOC Damascus  ] . 
Otherwise , van [PER Lynden-Leijten  ] said [PER Bot  ] has excellent relations in the [LOC Middle East  ] , and will no doubt ask for a readout on the Secretary 's recent trip to the region . 
[PER Bot  ] should be encouraged to take a greater role , especially with regard to influencing the [ORG EU  ] . 
[ORG North Korea/Iran  ] ---------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG GONL  ] -- and [PER Bot  ] in particular -- share our deep concern over nuclear developments in [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Bot  ] publicly labeled [LOC North Korea  ] 's nuclear test irresponsibly provocative and totally senseless , and called for [LOC Pyongyang  ] to return to the six-party talks . 
He also said the use of force would be counterproductive , given the large population in nearby [LOC Seoul  ] , and suggested [LOC China  ] was crucial in getting [LOC North Korea  ] to return to the table . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] continue to push for a diplomatic resolution , they worry about the message the international community is sending to [LOC Iran  ] and its nuclear program . 
Although publicly supportive of the [ORG EU-3  ] 's efforts to engage [LOC Iran  ] , in private he has frequently expressed frustration at being left out of the process . 
Recently , he called publicly for the [ORG UN Security Council  ] to become directly involved given the apparent lack of progress on the [ORG EU  ] track . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have offered on several occasions to play a more active role on the margins of the six-party talks and in dealing with [LOC Iran  ] , suggesting that any and all diplomatic pressure would be helpful in persuading these states to abandon their current courses . 
[PER Bot  ] should be encouraged to continue to press [ORG EU  ] members to engage on [LOC North Korea  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] --------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) As [LOC Venezuela  ] 's neighbor -- the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] sit just off the [MISC Venezuelan  ] coast -- the [MISC Dutch  ] are THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00002282 004 OF 004 understandably worried about [MISC Chavez'  ] intentions , but also go to great lengths to avoid provoking him . 
For example , the [MISC Dutch  ] were unwilling to lobby on behalf of [LOC Guatemala  ] for the [ORG UN Security Council  ] or otherwise draw attention to their intention to vote against [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
They have significant interests in [LOC Venezuela  ] , including a new [ORG Shell  ] exploration concession and a major subcontract on new light frigates . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] posture toward [LOC Venezuela  ] is less forward leaning than we would like - and while [PER Bot  ] has at times made statements we consider unhelpful - the [MISC Dutch  ] have been leaders within the [ORG EU  ] on other regional issues . 
[MISC Dutch  ] participation in [MISC Colombian  ] paramilitary reintegration , coca eradication efforts , [MISC Nicaraguan  ] election monitoring , and other regional initiatives has been superb . 
On [LOC Cuba  ] and other [MISC Latin American  ] issues , they have been a useful counterbalance to traditional [MISC Spanish  ] sway within the [ORG EU  ] . 
[ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) -------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] is expected on October 24 to approve the [ORG GONL  ] 's signing of the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) Production , Sustainment , and [ORG Follow-on Development  ] ( [ORG PSFD  ] ) Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) . 
A solid majority in [ORG Parliament  ] supports the [ORG GONL  ] 's continued participation in [ORG JSF  ] , while the [MISC Dutch  ] press views [ORG MOU  ] signature as a foregone conclusion . 
The [ORG MOU  ] signing ceremony hosted by Deputy Secretary of Defense [LOC England  ] is planned for November 14 in [LOC SIPDIS  ] the [ORG Pentagon  ] . 
[ORG Dutch State  ] Secretary of Defense van der [ORG Knaap  ] and Foreign Trade Minister van [PER Gennip  ] are expected to represent the [ORG GONL  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Italian  ] governments are considering a joint signing ceremony , although this has not yet been confirmed . 
[LOC Sudan  ] ----- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] financial contributions to [LOC Sudan  ] relief , development and peacekeeping , exceed all but our own , on a per capita basis . 
We have worked extremely closely with the [ORG MFA  ] and Development Minister [PER Ardenne  ] ( [PER Bot  ] 's close colleague ) on [LOC Darfur  ] and southern [LOC Sudan  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have been close allies on several other regional initiatives , including efforts to deal with the [ORG Lords' Resistance Army  ] in [LOC Uganda  ] , promote reconciliation and intelligence cooperation in the [LOC Great Lakes  ] , train peacekeepers , and develop effective [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] programs . 
[PER Van Ardenne  ] , rather than [PER Bot  ] , takes the lead on these issues . 
[ORG Human Rights Council  ] -------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Bot  ] would like the [LOC U.S.  ] to run for the [ORG HRC  ] in 2007 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] worked very closely with our mission in [LOC Geneva  ] this fall and were among our closest [ORG EU  ] allies during the [MISC Israel/Lebanon  ] debates - this despite severe criticism at home , both of [PER Bot  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
He is committed to [ORG HRC  ] reform , and frustrated by the course of events so far , but believes like-minded nations can best protect their interests and effect change by remaining involved . 
Law Enforcement Issues ---------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] will visit The [ORG Hague  ] a few days after your meeting with [PER Bot  ] . 
[PER Gonzales  ] will open a bilateral conference on cyber crime that the Embassy is co-sponsoring with the [ORG Dutch Justice Ministry  ] . 
The conference will spur our bilateral cooperation on high-tech crime , which is emerging as a priority for the law enforcement communities in both countries . 
Law enforcement cooperation is good and getting better . 
While bureaucratic and privacy restrictions continue to hamper some direct police-to-police cooperation , we have made significant advances in the last two years . 
In particular , [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to stem the flow of ecstasy to the [LOC United States  ] have resulted in dramatic declines in the volume of [MISC Dutch-linked  ] ecstasy seized in the [LOC U.S.  ] since 2000 . 
Cooperation with [ORG DEA  ] on narcotics , and the [ORG FBI  ] on cyber crime and counter-terrorism investigations , is excellent .
