Fitzpatrick  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs'  ] chief official for [MISC Andean  ] countries informed poloff February 9 that a majority of officials at the [ORG MFA  ] are as perplexed as the [LOC U.S.  ] is at President [PER Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero  ] 's policy of building closer relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
[PER Juan Carlos Sanchez  ] ( please protect ) explained [PER Zapatero  ] 's [LOC Venezuela  ] policy is being run from [LOC Moncloa  ] and the [ORG MFA  ] is left to try to influence the policy as much as possible . 
Most [ORG MFA  ] officials , according to [PER Sanchez  ] , see no benefits and only downsides for [LOC Spain  ] in closer relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
They understand [PER Zapatero  ] 's moves do not work to promote democracy or stability in the region and will only serve to further strain relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] and other countries in the region . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Poloff met February 9 with [PER Sanchez  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] 's Deputy Director General for the [ORG Andean Community  ] ( DAS-equivalent ) to discuss [LOC Spain  ] 's policy toward [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
( [PER Sanchez  ] replaced [PER Ernesto de Zulueta  ] as the [MISC Andean  ] DDG in December 2004 ) . 
Poloff began the meeting telling [PER Sanchez  ] that in general the [LOC U.S.  ] was extremely perplexed at [LOC Spain  ] 's developing relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , and believed the [MISC Spanish  ] government was on the wrong side of the equation in terms of promoting democracy in the region and avoiding conflicts between [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a surprisingly frank reply , [PER Sanchez  ] ( please protect ) said he and " the great majority " of his colleagues in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] were " equally perplexed " at [PER Zapatero  ] 's moves to build closer relations with [PER Chavez  ] . 
He specifically noted ( again , please protect ) that more senior officials involved with [MISC Latin American  ] affairs at the [ORG MFA  ] share this view . 
[PER Sanchez  ] , who has served in [LOC Caracas  ] , explained that neither he nor many others in the [ORG MFA  ] saw any benefit accruing to [LOC Spain  ] from [PER Zapatero  ] 's policy , rather quite the opposite: [PER Zapatero  ] 's cozying up to [PER Chavez  ] will only needlessly anger the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
" We don't understand the policy or the reason for it , " remarked [PER Sanchez.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On [PER Zapatero  ] 's canceling of a planned stop in [LOC Caracas  ] during his recent visit to [LOC South America  ] , [PER Sanchez  ] said the [ORG MFA  ] strongly urged [PER Zapatero  ] not to make the stop , believing it would be a serious mistake , but in the end it was [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] 's direct intervention with [PER Zapatero  ] ( somewhat heated , according to [PER Sanchez  ] ) that ultimately led [PER Zapatero  ] to cancel the stop . 
[PER Sanchez  ] said he and his [ORG MFA  ] colleagues were at a loss to explain why [PER Zapatero  ] then " secretly " sent Minister of Defense [PER Bono  ] to [LOC Caracas  ] . 
If the purpose of the visit was to lobby [PER Chavez  ] to purchase military ships from [LOC Spain  ] 's ailing [ORG Izar  ] shipyards , the prevailing view at the [ORG MFA  ] is that placating , probably only temporarily , [ORG Izar  ] 's agitated ship workers was not worth damaging [LOC Spain  ] 's relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] and others. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Moreover , [PER Sanchez  ] emphasized , selling any kind of armaments to [LOC Venezuela  ] at this time " makes no sense at all , " particularly in light of the [PER Zapatero  ] government 's decision in 2004 to cancel the sale of " a few second or third hand tanks " to [LOC Colombia  ] , purportedly because [ORG Madrid  ] was concerned the sale could upset the military balance between [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] . 
" If [PER Bono  ] had justified canceling the sale based on the idea that tanks are not well suited to fighting an insurgency , that would be one thing , " said [PER Sanchez  ] , " but having canceled the sale supposedly to avoid tipping the military balance in the region , we at the [ORG MFA  ] understand how incongruous discussions with [LOC Venezuela  ] about purchasing armaments from [LOC Spain  ] now look . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Sanchez  ] said that [LOC Venezuela  ] policy is being run out of [LOC Moncloa  ] ( the presidency ) and that the [ORG MFA  ] is left trying to influence the policy as much as possible . 
" The [ORG MFA  ] wants relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] repaired , not further damaged by a policy of building closer relations to [PER Hugo Chavez  ] , which produces no tangible benefits for [LOC Spain  ] , " said [PER Sanchez  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] understands the [LOC U.S.  ] also strongly disagrees with [LOC Spain  ] 's [LOC Cuba  ] policy , but the [ORG MFA  ] feels it can articulate a reasonable basis for the [PER Zapatero  ] government 's position on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
" There is no reasonable basis for our [LOC Venezuela  ] policy , " said [PER Sanchez  ] . 
The [ORG MFA  ] understands [LOC Spain  ] should be on the right side of democracy and regional security , and that [LOC Venezuela  ] is going in the wrong direction . 
The [ORG MFA  ] is doing its best to persuade [LOC Moncloa  ] of this. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Poloff said the [LOC U.S.  ] strongly urges [PER Zapatero  ] not to visit [LOC Caracas  ] in March as we understand he is tentatively planning to do . 
[PER Sanchez  ] replied that the [ORG MFA  ] understands the [LOC U.S.  ] position and is seeking to postpone the visit . 
At a minimum , the [ORG MFA  ] wants to see [PER Zapatero  ] visit [LOC Bogota  ] on the same trip if [PER Zapatero  ] does go to [LOC Caracas  ] in [LOC March.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Poloff 's conversation with [PER Sanchez  ] took place before we received reftel concerning [MISC Venezuelan  ] attempts to purchase certain armaments . 
We will follow up with both the [ORG MFA  ] and [LOC Moncloa  ] on the arms question , and more generally on further developments in the [PER Zapatero  ] government 's evolving policy toward [LOC Venezuela  ] .
