MADRID 610 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
MADRID 568 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Eduardo Aguirre  ] , for reasons 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC SUMMARY: New  ] [MISC Spanish  ] Minister of Defense [PER Carme Chacon  ] , who took office April 14 but has been on maternity leave since May 19 , told Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] during a congenial one-on-one breakfast meeting June 10 that she looked forward to working with the [LOC United States  ] and would like to meet with her [LOC U.S.  ] counterpart when an opportunity presents itself . 
The two discussed the bilateral defense relationship , with special emphasis on [MISC Spanish  ] overseas deployments , especially [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Chacon  ] and the Ambassador also covered the June 3 congressional notification of the sale of [LOC Tomahawk  ] missiles to [LOC Spain  ] ; the status of [LOC Spain  ] 's request for the [ORG LAIRCM  ] aircraft protection suite ; [LOC U.S.  ] use of the [MISC Spanish  ] bases of [LOC Moron  ] and [LOC Rota  ] , including ship visits and sensitivities related to [LOC Gibraltar  ] ; [ORG NATO  ] enlargement ; and opportunities for [MISC Spanish  ] cooperation with the [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] ( [ORG AFRICOM  ] ) . 
Minister [PER Chacon  ] described herself as a friend of the [LOC United States  ] , as evidenced by her eagerness to meet with the Ambassador even before she returns to work o/a June 30 . 
The very friendly meeting lasted 90 minutes and included the presentation by the Ambassador of a stuffed animal [MISC Bald Eagle  ] chick for Minister [PER Chacon  ] 's newborn son . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Chacon  ] told the Ambassador she would like a pull-aside with Secretary of Defense [PER Gates  ] at the next [ORG NATO  ] defense ministerial opportunity . 
While interested in seeing Secretary [PER Gates  ] , [PER Chacon  ] did not foresee traveling to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Note: [MISC Spanish  ] Secretary General for Defense [PER Luis Cuesta  ] had told the DCM on May 29 that [PER MOD Chacon  ] ( because of her maternity leave ) would not be going to the June [ORG NATO  ] meeting but would attend in September , and would probably seek an appointment with [ORG SECDEF  ] at that time ( ref A ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On a number of issues , Minister [PER Chacon  ] made it clear she was pleased to discuss but not yet aware of [MISC Spanish  ] equities . 
She offered no comment , for example , when the [ORG Ambassador  ] raised [ORG NATO  ] enlargement , urging that [LOC Spain  ] support [ORG Membership Action Plans  ] ( [ORG MAP  ] ) for [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
She likewise asked the [ORG Ambassador  ] about the status of [ORG LAIRCM  ] but seemed satisfied the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy was doing all it could to help protect [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Head of State  ] and [ORG Head of Government  ] aircraft . 
While unfamiliar with [LOC U.S.  ] procedures for notifying the intent to sell [ORG TLAM  ] to [LOC Spain  ] , she was pleased with the Ambassador 's efforts to push for notification and interested in the outcome . 
On [LOC Gibraltar  ] , [PER MOD Chacon  ] was pleased to learn the [ORG U.S.-Spanish Permanent Committee  ] would hold an informational meeting June 17 , and yet expressed the [MISC Spanish  ] hope [LOC U.S.  ] ships would call at [LOC Rota  ] whenever possible. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER MOD Chacon  ] assured the Ambassador [LOC Spain  ] was considering the possible deployment of [MISC Spanish  ] police trainers . 
She noted the original request had been for [ORG Civil Guard  ] trainers . 
The [ORG Ambassador  ] explained that either [ORG Spanish National Police  ] or [ORG Civil Guard  ] expertise would be welcome , and left it up to [LOC Spain  ] to determine the most appropriate contribution . 
Minister [PER Chacon  ] assured the [ORG Ambassador  ] that [LOC Spain  ] also remained committed to [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
She went on to suggest that the [MISC Spanish  ] military , absent [ORG GOS  ] recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence , had greater credibility with [MISC Serb  ] forces and might therefore have a calming effect in the region . 
The Minister told the [ORG Ambassador  ] that [LOC Spain  ] 's parliamentary cap of 3,000 on personnel deployed overseas was real , and said she could not imagine it being raised or eliminated. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On [ORG AFRICOM  ] , the Ambassador noted the June 8-11 visit of General [PER Ward  ] was an important opportunity to exchange views on a subject of great strategic interest to both countries . 
[PER Chacon  ] was aware of the June 9-10 meetings and expressed a desire to place a [MISC Spanish  ] liaison officer in [ORG AFRICOM  ] . 
Reiterating the [ORG AFRICOM  ] Commander 's message to the [ORG CHOD  ] , the [ORG Ambassador  ] said [ORG AFRICOM  ] would be pleased to have a [MISC Spanish  ] officer , probably toward the end of 2008 once the command was better prepared to host one . 
[PER Chacon  ] noted that [MISC Spanish  ] public opinion would be critical in determining the level of [ORG GOS  ] engagement with the new command . 
While the [ORG GOS  ] was interested in being a part of efforts in [LOC Africa  ] , much work remained to be done and she asked that the USG coordinate closely with [LOC Spain  ] on next steps. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ambassador  ] referenced the June 13 extradition to the [LOC United States  ] of notorious [MISC Syrian  ] arms dealer [PER Monzer Al-Kassar  ] . 
Though Minister [PER Chacon  ] seemed to disregard media speculation of an increased threat to [MISC Spanish  ] personnel in [LOC Lebanon  ] and elsewhere , the Ambassador urged the Minister to be aware of possible repercussions and to take necessary steps to protect [MISC Spanish  ] forces participating in [LOC UNIFIL.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Chacon  ] 's cordial invitation and subsequent approach to the Ambassador , even while she is still on maternity leave , echo the cooperative tone she adopted while serving as Minister of Housing . 
The Minister 's assertion the deployment ceiling would not be raised , in apparent contradiction of Chief of Defense GEN Sanz 's statements in the context of June 5 meetings with [LOC U.S.  ] military visitors , may or may not reflect an entrenched [ORG GOS  ] position and could be more an indication that [PER Chacon  ] is technically still on leave . 
Senior members of her policy staff have told Post certain initiatives await the new Minister 's input or go-ahead ( reftels ) and the [ORG CHOD  ] indicated he planned to lobby internally to advocate eliminating the political cap . 
In anticipation of the end of [PER Chacon  ] 's maternity leave and planned June 30 return to the Ministry , on the eve of [MISC Spanish  ] summer vacations , only time will tell how [LOC Spain  ] plans to meet its international obligations . 
Adding overseas missions within current deployment ceilings will require some combination of creative accounting ( including setting aside law enforcement training personnel ) , the use of political capital to relax congressional strictures on individual missions , and the possible incorporation of [MISC Latin American  ] troop contributing countries under [MISC Spanish  ] auspices from [LOC Lebanon  ] to [LOC Afghanistan  ] .
