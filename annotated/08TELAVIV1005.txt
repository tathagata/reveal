Jones  ] , [ORG Reason  ] 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Israel  ] is preparing to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of its declaration of independence on May 8 with a characteristically [MISC Israeli  ] mix of pride in their achievements and worry about the future . 
One point that unites virtually all [MISC Israelis  ] -- except for the extreme left and right -- is their appreciation for President [PER Bush  ] 's friendship and support throughout his two terms . 
When the President arrives here next week , he will be greeted warmly as a friend not just by [LOC Israel  ] 's political and military elite , but also by the vast majority of its seven million people . 
As one average [MISC Israeli  ] who wrote to the Ambassador put it , the silent majority of [MISC Israelis  ] want to thank the President for sharing with them the celebrations marking [LOC Israel  ] 's sixtieth year . 
[MISC Israeli  ] Pride Justified ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Israelis'  ] sense of pride in their achievements is fully justified . 
The vision of a strong , democratic [MISC Jewish  ] state that would be a haven for [MISC Jews  ] everywhere started as a desperate dream , as [LOC Israel  ] 's fledgling army was bolstered by the arrival of tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors and hundreds of [MISC Jewish  ] WW II veterans who arrived just in time to help counter the invasion of the new state by the armies of [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] , not to mention the [MISC Palestinians'  ] irregular forces . 
Today , [LOC Israel  ] is very much a reality , with a vibrantly original Hebrew-speaking cultural life , a [ORG Tel Aviv  ] skyline dominated by gleaming skyscrapers , a booming high tech-based economy , and the strongest army in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] at sixty is firmly [MISC Western  ] in its values but also more diverse ethnically and culturally , less [MISC Europe-oriented  ] , and decidedly more capitalist than the [LOC Israel  ] founded largely by [LOC East European-born  ] socialists . 
For all of its problems with finding the right electoral formula to bring about stable governments , [LOC Israel  ] 's democracy is also a thriving reality . 
[LOC Israel  ] is the only [MISC Middle Eastern  ] country in which its citizens take for granted the peaceful transfer of political power via the ballot box . 
And Anxieties are Real ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Yet this year 's celebrations are also tinged with anxiety . 
The looming threat of a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] , whose leaders constantly declare their determination to wipe [LOC Israel  ] off the map , weighs heavily on the minds of [MISC Israelis  ] , who regard their country not only through the prism of the Holocaust but also as the only [ORG UN  ] member-state to be routinely threatened with annihilation . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's success in projecting power directly into the core of the [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] conflict through its ties to [LOC Syria  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] compounds the sense of threat . 
Despite the great diplomatic achievements represented by the peace treaties with [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] , [MISC Israelis  ] worry about the frayed nature of their relations with [LOC Egypt  ] and are unsure about the outlook of the [MISC Egyptian  ] leadership that will follow [PER Mubarak  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] enjoys excellent relations with the [MISC Jordanian  ] royal palace and security services , but virtually no contact with [LOC Jordan  ] 's largely [MISC Palestinian  ] civil society , most of which boycotts any connections to [LOC Israel  ] . 
[MISC Israelis  ] are watching carefully to see how the [LOC U.S.  ] manages the next few years of our involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] and whether we can succeed in stabilizing [LOC Iraq  ] in a way that avoids its becoming either an [MISC Iranian  ] client state or a source of instability that overwhelms [LOC Jordan  ] 's fragile balance . 
Changing Views on [MISC Palestinians  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Closer to home , [ORG Israelis'  ] views of their relations with their [MISC Palestinian  ] neighbors are changing as well . 
In the aftermath of the Second [MISC Intifada  ] , a solid majority of [MISC Israelis  ] has come to accept the need for a [MISC Palestinian  ] state and for [LOC Israel  ] to relinquish control of most of the [LOC West Bank  ] ( although the exact percentage is still a topic for discussion , as are the timing and circumstances under which this would occur ) . 
Gone are the days when many [MISC Israelis  ] questioned the existence of a [MISC Palestinian  ] national identity , and today only a small minority -- though still an outspoken and determined one -- continues to articulate a demand to retain control of all of the [LOC West Bank  ] for religious/historical reasons . 
Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Livni  ] , both of whom grew up and began their political careers as strong advocates of [LOC Israel  ] 's historic right to all of [LOC Jerusalem  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] , are among the leading examples of [MISC Israelis  ] who have become convinced that only a two-state solution and painful territorial compromise [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00001005 002 OF 003 will enable [LOC Israel  ] to preserve its identity as a democratic , [MISC Jewish  ] state . 
The growing assertiveness of [LOC Israel  ] 's large [MISC Arab  ] minority , now about twenty percent of the total population , is both a further source of concern and an additional impetus to create a [MISC Palestinian  ] state. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) One problem , however , is the lack of a broad-based [MISC Israeli  ] confidence in the [MISC Palestinians'  ] capacity to hold up their end of the land-for-peace bargain . 
[PER Olmert  ] publicly stresses his confidence in [PER Mahmoud Abbas'  ] determination to achieve peace , and virtually all [MISC Israeli  ] leaders tell us how much they respect [PER Salam Fayyad  ] , yet few believe that [PER Abbas  ] or [PER Fayyad  ] enjoy much popular legitimacy among [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
The public generally accepts the admonitions of Defense Minister [PER Barak  ] and those of the leaders of the [ORG IDF  ] and [LOC Israel  ] 's security services that the [ORG Palestinian Authority Security Forces  ] lack the determination to stand up to [ORG Hamas  ] if push comes to shove . 
The precedent set by [LOC Gaza  ] is one that no one wants to see repeated in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
The [ORG IDF  ] 's strategic concept is heavily rooted in the absolute need to prevent the hills of the [LOC West Bank  ] from becoming sites from which rockets could be launched at [LOC Israel  ] 's heavily populated central plain . 
Hamas' control of [LOC Gaza  ] and the daily rain of rockets from [LOC Gaza  ] on southern [LOC Israel  ] pose another kind of problem . 
The political leadership is grappling with whether an [MISC Egyptian-negotiated  ] ceasefire in [LOC Gaza  ] would calm the situation or make it worse by strengthening [ORG Hamas  ] politically and militarily while undermining [PER Abbas  ] . 
The only other options on the table involve a broader armed conflict with [ORG Hamas  ] , but [LOC Israel  ] is constrained by the potential for high casualties , international condemnation , and most of all , the lack of a good exit strategy should it decide to invade [LOC Gaza  ] to topple the [ORG Hamas  ] regime there . 
All of these calculations could be upset at any time by a rocket from [LOC Gaza  ] that strikes a busy school or hospital , thus forcing the [MISC Israeli  ] leadership to order massive retaliation . 
[LOC Israel  ] is working with us on missile defense options , but their preferred system will not be operational for two years . 
One way we could help would be by offering to provide the kinds of short-range defenses against rockets that we are using in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Inertia Favors Settlers ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Another outstanding issue is how and when to confront the settler movement and get serious about outposts and settlements . 
Inertia is on the side of the settlers . 
Even if they no longer have the sympathy of the [MISC Israeli  ] public , they have powerful allies in the bureaucracy , wealthy backers in [LOC Israel  ] and abroad who are willing to fund the settlement enterprise , and an [ORG IDF  ] that will not challenge the settlers without clear instructions from the political echelon ( and even then may drag its feet ) . 
[PER Barak  ] , Deputy PM [PER Ramon  ] , and others are engaged in discussions with the settler leadership , and after Secretary Rice 's latest visit the PM 's office leaked to the media that he has discussed with [PER Abbas  ] moving 60,000 settlers out of the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
If true , this is a dramatic development . 
[PER Olmert  ] 's need to retain the support of the [ORG Shas Party  ] and his political ups and downs have so far resulted in the settler leadership being much more determined to hold on than the GOI is to start moving them out . 
[PER Olmert  ] 's Political Woes Return ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Even as we finalize the preparations for the President 's visit , Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] is once again facing a political crisis . 
Having survived the [ORG Winograd Committee  ] 's final report and weathered four separate , interminable corruption investigations , in the past few weeks [PER Ehud Olmert  ] appeared to have regained his political footing and was openly declaring his plans to run for reelection , possibly in early 2009 . 
Then suddenly last week , the media was full of reports that the [PER Attorney General  ] had authorized the police to initiate a fifth criminal investigation of [PER Olmert  ] . 
At the same time , the [PER Attorney General  ] imposed a gag order that prevented the public from knowing the specifics of the charges and barred the Prime Minister from mobilizing a public defense against them . 
We do not know the details , though leaks in the media indicate that an [MISC American  ] investor may be involved with the PM in alleged financial misdeeds sometime before [PER Olmert  ] became Prime Minister . 
And although [PER Olmert  ] has survived the four previous investigations , informed [MISC Israelis  ] are suggesting that this time he may be in much more serious trouble. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG Labor Party  ] insider and Minister of [ORG Infrastructure Fuad  ] [PER Ben Eliezer  ] told the Ambassador May 6 that , according to [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00001005 003 OF 003 his information , the nature of the charges is such that [PER Olmert  ] may be forced to resign in the near future . 
[PER Ben Eliezer  ] echoed comments from other political analysts that if [PER Olmert  ] resigns , the most likely scenario will be for [PER Livni  ] to become interim Prime Minister and head of the [ORG Kadima Party  ] . 
If [PER Livni  ] becomes PM , [PER Ben Eliezer  ] was confident that [PER Barak  ] would keep [ORG Labor  ] inside the [ORG Coalition and  ] that elections could be delayed until some time next year . 
As [PER Ben Eliezer  ] put it , the political weakness of the constituent members of the coalition is the key to its strength , since none of them have an interest in early elections . 
At this point , we cannot predict how accurate [PER Ben Eliezer  ] 's prediction is likely to be , and no one should discount [PER Ehud Olmert  ] 's determination to hold on . 
But at a minimum , the latest charges represent an exceptionally unwelcome cloud over [PER Olmert  ] 's head as he prepares to greet the President. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the [ORG State Department  ] 's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** JONES</pre></code>
