( C/NF ) Summary . 
[ORG HMG  ] would like to establish a “marine park” or “reserve” providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the [LOC British Indian Ocean Territory  ] ( [LOC BIOT  ] ) , a senior Foreign and [ORG Commonwealth Office  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) official informed Polcouns on May 12 . 
The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park -- the world’s largest -- would in no way impinge on [ORG USG  ] use of the [LOC BIOT  ] , including [PER Diego Garcia  ] , for military purposes . 
He agreed that the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that [LOC U.S.  ] interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of [LOC BIOT  ] was upheld . 
He said that the [MISC BIOT’s  ] former inhabitants would find it difficult , if not impossible , to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire [MISC Chagos Archipelago  ] were a marine reserve . 
End Summary . 
Protecting the [LOC BIOT’s Waters  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Senior [ORG HMG  ] officials support the establishment of a “marine park” or “reserve” in the [LOC British Indian Ocean Territory  ] ( [LOC BIOT  ] ) , which includes [PER Diego Garcia  ] , [PER Colin Roberts  ] , the Foreign and [LOC Commonwealth Office’s  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] ) Director , [LOC Overseas Territories  ] , told the Political Counselor May 12 . 
Noting that the uninhabited islands of the [MISC Chagos Archipelago  ] are already protected under [MISC British  ] law from development or other environmental harm but that current [MISC British  ] law does not provide protected status for either reefs or waters , [PER Roberts  ] affirmed that the bruited proposal would only concern the “exclusive zone” around the islands . 
The resulting protected area would constitute “the largest marine reserve in the world.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Roberts  ] iterated strong [LOC UK  ] “political support” for a marine park ; “Ministers like the idea , ” he said . 
He stressed that HMG’s “timeline” for establishing the park was before the next general elections , which under [MISC British  ] law must occur no later than May 2010 . 
He suggested that the exact terms of the proposals could be defined and presented at the [MISC U.S.-UK  ] annual political-military consultations held in late summer/early fall 2009 ( exact date TBD ) . 
If the [ORG USG  ] would like to discuss the issue prior to those talks , [ORG HMG  ] would be open for discussion through other channels -- in any case , the [ORG FCO  ] would keep [ORG Embassy London  ] informed of development of the idea and next steps . 
The [LOC UK  ] would like to “move forward discussion with key international stakeholders” by the end of 2009 . 
He said that [ORG HMG  ] had noted the success of [LOC U.S.  ] marine sanctuaries in [LOC Hawaii  ] and the [ORG Marianas Trench  ] . 
( [PER Note: Roberts  ] was referring to the [ORG Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument  ] and [ORG Marianas Trench Marine National Monument  ] . 
End Note . 
) He asserted that the [ORG Pew Charitable Trust  ] , which has proposed a [LOC BIOT  ] marine reserve , is funding a public relations campaign in support of the idea . 
He noted that the trust had backed the [MISC Hawaiian  ] reserve and is well-regarded within [MISC British  ] governmental circles and the larger [MISC British  ] environmental community . 
Three Sine Qua Nons: [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Assent...  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) According to [PER Roberts  ] , three pre-conditions must be met before [ORG HMG  ] could establish a park . 
First , “we need to make sure the [LOC U.S.  ] government is comfortable with the idea . 
We would need to present this proposal very clearly to the [MISC American  ] administration...All we do should enhance base security or leave it unchanged.” Polcouns expressed appreciation for this a priori commitment , but stressed that the 1966 [MISC U.S.-UK  ] Exchange of Notes concerning the [LOC BIOT  ] would , in any event , require [LOC U.S.  ] assent to any significant change of the [MISC BIOT’s  ] status that could impact the [MISC BIOT’s  ] strategic use . 
[PER Roberts  ] stressed that the proposal “would have no impact on how [PER Diego Garcia  ] is administered as a base.” In response to a request for clarification on this point from Polcouns , [PER Roberts  ] asserted that the proposal would have absolutely no impact on the right of [LOC U.S.  ] or [MISC British  ] military vessels to use the [LOC BIOT  ] for passage , anchorage , prepositioning , or other uses . 
Polcouns rejoined that designating the [LOC BIOT  ] as a marine park could , years down the road , create public questioning about the suitability of the [LOC BIOT  ] for military purposes . 
[PER Roberts  ] responded that the terms of reference for the establishment of a marine park would clearly state that the [LOC BIOT  ] , including [PER Diego Garcia  ] , was reserved for military uses. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Ashley Smith  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Defense’s  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) International Policy and Planning Assistant Head , [ORG Asia Pacific  ] , who also participated in the meeting , affirmed that the [ORG MOD  ] “shares the same concerns as the [LOC U.S.  ] regarding security” and would ensure that security concerns were fully and properly addressed in any proposal for a marine park . 
[PER Roberts  ] agreed , stating that “the primary purpose of the [LOC BIOT  ] is security” but that [ORG HMG  ] could also address environmental concerns in its administration of the [LOC BIOT  ] . 
[PER Smith  ] added that the establishment of a marine reserve had the potential to be a “win-win situation in terms of establishing situational awareness” of the [LOC BIOT  ] . 
He stressed that [ORG HMG  ] sought “no constraints on military operations” as a result of the establishment of a marine park. ...Mauritian [MISC Assent...  ] ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Roberts  ] outlined two other prerequisites for establishment of a marine park . 
[ORG HMG  ] would seek assent from the Government of [LOC Mauritius  ] , which disputes sovereignty over the [MISC Chagos  ] archipelago , in order to avoid the [ORG GOM  ] “raising complaints with the [MISC UN.” He  ] asserted that the [ORG GOM  ] had expressed little interest in protecting the archipelago’s sensitive environment and was primarily interested in the archipelago’s economic potential as a fishery . 
[PER Roberts  ] noted that in January 2009 [ORG HMG  ] held the first-ever “formal talks” with [LOC Mauritius  ] regarding the [LOC BIOT  ] . 
The talks included the [MISC Mauritian  ] Prime Minister . 
[PER Roberts  ] said that he “cast a fly in the talks over how we could improve stewardship of the territory , ” but the [MISC Mauritian  ] participants “were not focused on environmental issues and expressed interest only in fishery control.” He said that one [MISC Mauritian  ] participant in the talks complained that the [LOC Indian Ocean  ] is “the only ocean in the world where the fish die of old age.” In HMG’s view , the marine park concept aims to “go beyond economic value and consider bio-diversity and intangible values.” ...Chagossian Assent -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Roberts  ] acknowledged that “we need to find a way to get through the various [MISC Chagossian  ] lobbies.” He admitted that [ORG HMG  ] is “under pressure” from the [MISC Chagossians  ] and their advocates to permit resettlement of the “outer islands” of the [LOC BIOT  ] . 
He noted , without providing details , that “there are proposals ( for a marine park ) that could provide the [MISC Chagossians  ] warden jobs” within the [LOC BIOT  ] . 
However , [PER Roberts  ] stated that , according to the [ORG HGM  ] , s current thinking on a reserve , there would be “no human footprints” or “Man Fridays” on the [MISC BIOT’s  ] uninhabited islands . 
He asserted that establishing a marine park would , in effect , put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago’s former residents . 
Responding to [LOC Polcouns’  ] observation that the advocates of [MISC Chagossian  ] resettlement continue to vigorously press their case , [PER Roberts  ] opined that the [MISC UK’s  ] “environmental lobby is far more powerful than the [MISC Chagossians’  ] advocates.” ( [MISC Note: One  ] group of [MISC Chagossian  ] litigants is appealing to the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] ( [ORG ECHR  ] ) the decision of [MISC Britain’s  ] highest court to deny “resettlement rights” to the islands’ former inhabitants . 
See below at paragraph 13 and reftel . 
End Note . 
) Je [MISC Ne Regrette Rien  ] ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Roberts  ] observed that [LOC BIOT  ] has “served its role very well , ” advancing shared [MISC U.S.-UK  ] strategic security objectives for the past several decades . 
The [LOC BIOT  ] “has had a great role in assuring the security of the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] -- much more than anyone foresaw” in the 1960s , [PER Roberts  ] emphasized. “We do not regret the removal of the population , ” since removal was necessary for the [LOC BIOT  ] to fulfill its strategic purpose , he said . 
Removal of the population is the reason that the [MISC BIOT’s  ] uninhabited islands and the surrounding waters are in “pristine” condition . 
[PER Roberts  ] added that [PER Diego Garcia’s  ] excellent condition reflects the responsible stewardship of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] forces using it . 
Administering a Reserve ----------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Roberts  ] acknowledged that numerous technical questions needed to be resolved regarding the establishment and administration of a marine park , although he described the governmental “act” of declaring a marine park as a relatively straightforward and rapid process . 
He noted that the establishment of a marine reserve would require permitting scientists to visit [LOC BIOT  ] , but that creating a park would help restrict access for non-scientific purposes . 
For example , he continued , the rules governing the park could strictly limit access to [LOC BIOT  ] by yachts , which [PER Roberts  ] referred to as “sea gypsies.” BIOT: More Than Just [PER Diego Garcia  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Following the meeting with [PER Roberts  ] , [PER Joanne Yeadon  ] , Head of the [ORG FCO’s Overseas Territories Directorate’s BIOT  ] and [PER Pitcairn Section  ] , who also attended the meeting with Polcouns , told [PER Poloff  ] that the marine park proposal would “not impact the base on [PER Diego Garcia  ] in any way” and would have no impact on the parameters of the [MISC U.S.-UK  ] 1966 exchange of notes since the marine park would “have no impact on defense purposes.” [PER Yeadon  ] averred that the provision of the [ORG UN Convention  ] on the Law of the [LOC Sea  ] guaranteed free passage of vessels , including military vessels , and that the presence of a marine park would not diminish that right. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Yeadon  ] stressed that the exchange of notes governed more than just the atoll of [PER Diego Garcia  ] but expressly provided that all of the [LOC BIOT  ] was “set aside for defense purposes.” ( [MISC Note: This  ] is correct . 
End Note . 
) She urged Embassy officers in discussions with advocates for the [MISC Chagossians  ] , including with members of the [ORG “All Party Parliamentary Group  ] on [LOC Chagos Islands  ] ( [ORG APPG  ] ) , ” to affirm that the USG requires the entire [LOC BIOT  ] for defense purposes . 
Making this point would be the best rejoinder to the [MISC Chagossians’  ] assertion that partial settlement of the outer islands of the [MISC Chagos Archipelago  ] would have no impact on the use of [PER Diego Garcia  ] . 
She described that assertion as essentially irrelevant if the entire [LOC BIOT  ] needed to be uninhabited for defense purposes. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Yeadon  ] dismissed the [ORG APPG  ] as a “persistent” but relatively non-influential group within parliament or with the wider public . 
She said the [ORG FCO  ] had received only a handful of public inquiries regarding the status of the [LOC BIOT  ] . 
[PER Yeadon  ] described one of the [MISC Chagossians’  ] most outspoken advocates , former [ORG HMG  ] High Commissioner to [LOC Mauritius  ] [PER David Snoxell  ] , as “entirely lacking in influence” within the [ORG FCO  ] . 
She also asserted that the [MISC Conservatives  ] , if in power after the next general election , would not support a [MISC Chagossian  ] right of return . 
She averred that many members of the [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] ( [MISC Britain’s  ] third largest party after [ORG Labour  ] and the [MISC Conservatives  ] ) supported a “right of return.” <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Yeadon  ] told [PER Poloff May  ] 12 , and in several prior meetings , that the [ORG FCO  ] will vigorously contest the [MISC Chagossians’  ] “right of return” lawsuit before the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] ( [ORG ECHR  ] ) . 
[ORG HMG  ] will argue that the [ORG ECHR  ] lacks jurisdiction over the [LOC BIOT  ] in the present case . 
[PER Roberts  ] stressed May 12 ( as has [PER Yeadon  ] on previous occasions ) that the outer islands are “essentially uninhabitable” and could only be rendered livable by modern , [MISC Western  ] standards with a massive infusion of cash . 
Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) Regardless of the outcome of the [ORG ECHR  ] case , however , the [MISC Chagossians  ] and their advocates , including the [ORG “All Party Parliamentary Group  ] on [LOC Chagos Islands  ] ( [ORG APPG  ] ) , ” will continue to press their case in the court of public opinion . 
Their strategy is to publicize what they characterize as the plight of the so-called [MISC Chagossian  ] diaspora , thereby galvanizing public opinion and , in their best case scenario , causing the government to change course and allow a “right of return.” They would point to the government’s recent retreat on the issue of [LOC Gurkha  ] veterans’ right to settle in the [LOC UK  ] as a model . 
Despite [ORG FCO  ] assurances that the marine park concept -- still in an early , conceptual phase -- would not impinge on [MISC BIOT’s  ] value as a strategic resource , we are concerned that , long-term , both the [MISC British  ] public and policy makers would come to see the existence of a marine reserve as inherently inconsistent with the military use of [LOC Diego Garcia  ] -- and the entire [LOC BIOT  ] . 
In any event , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] would need to carefully negotiate the parameters of such a marine park -- a point on which [PER Roberts  ] unequivocally agreed . 
In Embassy London’s view , these negotiations should occur among [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] experts separate from the 2009 annual Political-Military consultations , given the specific and technical legal and environmental issues that would be subject to discussion. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) Comment Continued . 
We do not doubt the current government’s resolve to prevent the resettlement of the islands’ former inhabitants , although as [ORG FCO Parliamentary Under-Secretary  ] [PER Gillian Merron  ] noted in an April parliamentary debate , “FCO will continue to organize and fund visits to the territory by the [ORG Chagossians.”  ] We are not as sanguine as the [ORG FCO’s Yeadon  ] , however , that the [MISC Conservatives  ] would oppose a right of return . 
Indeed , MP [PER Keith Simpson  ] , the Conservatives’ Shadow Minister , [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] , stated in the same April parliamentary debate in which [PER Merron  ] spoke that [ORG HMG  ] “should take into account what I suspect is the all-party view that the rights of the [MISC Chagossian  ] people should be recognized , and that there should at the very least be a timetable for the return of those people at least to the outer islands , if not the inner islands.” Establishing a marine reserve might , indeed , as the [ORG FCO’s Roberts  ] stated , be the most effective long-term way to prevent any of the [LOC Chagos Islands’  ] former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the [LOC BIOT  ] .
