Patterson  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
We look forward to your visit to begin the process of strengthening and refocusing our military to military relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] 's CJCS General [PER Majid  ] and [PER COAS Kayani  ] . 
This has become increasingly urgent because of the expanding insurgency in the tribal areas and attacks against [MISC GOP  ] targets . 
We need to bring more discipline to the [ORG Coalition Support Funds  ] ( [ORG CSF  ] ) , [ORG FMF  ] and [ORG IMET  ] programs we established in the wake of September 11 so they better support our counter-terrorism objectives . 
You may wish to follow up on the visit of the [ORG DNI  ] and the [ORG DCIA  ] to push [PER Musharraf  ] and [PER Kayani  ] on our objectives , including pressing all of them on expanded [LOC U.S.  ] training and mil-mil and intelligence cooperation If you can set the scene for needed reforms , we can follow up during the annual bilateral [ORG Consultative Defense Group  ] meeting in the spring . 
Although they are concerned about the 2009 expiration of the President 's financial commitment to [LOC Pakistan  ] , the military is reluctant to make necessary reforms . 
Your visit will help change their attitude. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At the same time , I would like to discuss with you the assignment of more [MISC American  ] officers in [LOC ODRP  ] . 
We cannot have more effective military to military relations until we have more [MISC American  ] officers on the ground . 
It will still be a long and painful struggle to improve relations , but the presence of more [MISC American  ] officers is a minimal condition . 
End Summary . 
Political Uncertainty --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A year ago , [PER Musharraf  ] 's popularity was high ; we were working together to support a smooth transition to a civilian government . 
Beginning with his decision to fire the Chief Justice in March 2007 , [PER Musharraf  ] has made repeated political blunders culminating in a state of emergency ( [ORG SOE  ] ) and temporary suspension of the constitution . 
He is increasingly isolated after firing long-time advisors who disagreed with some of these decisions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The February 18 elections are too close to call . 
No party will win enough votes to form a government alone , and the current game is one of coalition building . 
[PER Musharraf  ] 's party remains well organized in the critical [LOC Punjab  ] , but the state of emergency , [PER Bhutto  ] 's assassination , rising food prices and electricity outages have cut his job approval rating to 15% in the latest polls . 
Most analysts predict a surge in sympathy votes for [PER Bhutto  ] 's [ORG Pakistan People 's Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) , but security concerns and a [ORG PPP  ] leadership struggle could reduce turnout and undercut this surge. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) If street expectations for a [ORG PPP  ] victory are disappointed , many are predicting violence , especially in [PER Bhutto  ] 's home province of [LOC Sindh  ] . 
We can work with any of the likely candidates for Prime Minister . 
But it may take weeks or even months after the election before a new Prime Minister is chosen and [LOC Pakistan  ] again has a functional government that can focus on tackling extremism and necessary economic reform . 
Security Concerns/Army Challenges --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The January/February bombings in [LOC Lahore  ] , [LOC Karachi  ] , [LOC Peshawar  ] and [LOC Rawalpindi  ] have further raised security concerns , especially for political candidates . 
Suicide bombings were practically unheard of in [LOC Pakistan  ] two years ago ; in 2007 , over 600 people died in suicide attacks attributed to [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] and other militants . 
Militants have become increasingly emboldened , attacking police , [ORG Army  ] and intelligence targets . 
The [ORG Army  ] was called out to provide additional security during the [MISC Islamic  ] month of [LOC Muharram  ] and will be deployed in sensitive polling areas during the elections. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Neither the [ORG Army  ] nor the security services would relish the prospect of adding post-election riot control in [LOC Sindh  ] to their currently full plate . 
Military operations in Swat have been reasonably successful , but the [ORG Army  ] will likely have to maintain a significant presence there into the spring . 
In the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Area  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) , the [ORG Army  ] has been working to prevent [MISC Sunni-Shia'  ] violence , exacerbated this year by militant involvement . 
In the [MISC Waziristans  ] , the government is encouraging rival tribes to counter the influence of [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] and his [MISC Uzbek  ] recruits. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The militants continue to control the agenda ; the [ORG Army  ] 's currently limited strategy is one of containment rather than pro-active engagement . 
Since they cannot defeat ISLAMABAD 00000525 002 OF 002 [PER Mehsud  ] with military action alone , they are renewing negotiations , hoping this time to deal from a greater ground position of strength . 
Attacks on the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border are significantly lower than they have been in the past two years , but we are seeing signs that militants are moving back into [LOC Afghanistan  ] ahead of the annual spring offensive. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We are making progress on the [ORG Security Development Plan  ] ( [ORG SDP  ] ) for the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] , although [PER Musharraf  ] may complain about aid levels . 
Progress on the tripartite [ORG Border Coordination Centers  ] ( [ORG BCC  ] ) has not been quick enough . 
We will brief you on our [ORG FATA  ] development strategy and how the [ORG SDP  ] supports livelihood and other programs now being implemented in [ORG FATA  ] . 
Nuclear Weapons --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Pakistan  ] 's leadership is increasingly frustrated over media reports that its nuclear weapons are about to fall into extremist hands . 
In January , both the Foreign Secretary and General [PER Majid  ] called me in to protest [LOC U.S.  ] reports questioning the security of the [MISC GOP  ] 's nuclear weapons . 
You will meet with the Director of the [ORG Special Plans Division LtGen  ] ( ret ) [PER Kidwai  ] who , at the [ORG Embassy  ] 's urging , recently provided briefings to the diplomatic corps and the international press on the organizational structure and personnel controls that safeguard [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear weapons . 
As demonstrated by the February 1 test of its [ORG Ghauri/Hatf V  ] missile , [LOC Pakistan  ] continues development of its missile and nuclear programs as a deterrent to [LOC India  ] 's conventional force capability . 
Meeting Agendas --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Separately , we are providing briefing papers covering our proposals to bring better discipline to [LOC CSF  ] , regularize [ORG FMF  ] based on a mutual needs assessment , increase [ORG IMET  ] opportunities , and launch [ORG SOFA  ] negotiations and [ORG MOA  ] talks on improving transshipment of fuel and cargo to support [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) General [PER Majid: You  ] will find [LOC Pakistan  ] 's Joint Staff a young and weak organization , but CJCS [PER Majid  ] is an excellent interlocutor . 
The lunch he is hosting will provide an opportunity to deliver our messages on the need for [LOC CSF  ] and [ORG FMF  ] discipline. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) General [PER Kayani:  ] As expected , [PER Kayani  ] is taking slow but deliberate steps to distance the [ORG Army  ] from now civilian President [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[PER Kayani  ] announced that generals would need his permission to meet the President , issued public statements distancing the [ORG Army  ] from civilian politics and is rumored to be considering a decision to remove active duty [ORG Army  ] officers from civilian [MISC GOP  ] jobs . 
[PER Kayani  ] also has declared 2008 as the " Year of the [MISC Soldier  ] " in an attempt to improve morale . 
Privately , he has discouraged ISI interference in elections . 
With [PER Kayani  ] , you should stress the importance of accepting [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC COIN  ] training and building [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG CI  ] capabilities. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) President [PER Musharraf: You  ] will find [PER Musharraf  ] increasingly defensive and unsure of how to reverse his growing unpopularity ahead of parliamentary elections . 
In your meeting , I would recommend that you ask him to appoint a [MISC Pakistani  ] " czar " to coordinate security and development projects in the tribal areas . 
This coordination will be critical in implementing the [ORG USG  ] 's $750 million [ORG FATA  ] program and supporting [ORG DOD  ] 's strategy in the tribal areas . 
[PER Musharraf  ] and [PER Kayani  ] will likely raise slow [LOC CSF  ] reimbursement because an economic cash crunch has heightened the [MISC GOP  ] 's need for [LOC CSF  ] payments . 
The latest $282 million payment should be released in mid-February . 
He will raise slow delivery of training and equipment to the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] . 
You will want to follow up on some of the specific issues raised by the [ORG DNI  ] and the [MISC DCIA.</pre></code>  ]
