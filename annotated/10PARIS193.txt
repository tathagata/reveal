( C/NF ) SUMMARY: Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and [ORG International Security  ] [PER Ellen Tauscher  ] 's February 2 meetings with [MISC French  ] counterparts from the [LOC Elysee  ] ( presidency ) and [ORG MFA  ] included discussions of [LOC U.S.  ] disarmament priorities , the [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] ( [ORG NPT RevCon  ] ) , the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] , and missile defense . 
Meeting separately with NSA-equivalent [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] , [ORG Presidency Strategic Affairs Advisor Francois Richier  ] , and [ORG MFA Strategic Affairs  ] Director [PER Patrick Maisonnave  ] , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] reassured the [MISC French  ] that while " a world without nuclear weapons " is a sincere [ORG USG  ] ambition , the [LOC United States  ] will not move precipitously and will take allies' interests into account . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] discussed next steps on [ORG NPT RevCon  ] preparations , including thinking creatively about outcomes and minimizing the threat of disruptive [MISC Egyptian  ] behavior . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] also clarified [ORG USG  ] missile defense priorities , especially political support for territorial defense at the 2010 [MISC Lisbon NATO  ] summit . 
END SUMMARY. ----------------------------- MOVING FORWARD ON DISARMAMENT ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] stressed to [PER Levitte  ] , [PER Richier  ] , and [PER Maisonnave  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] position on disarmament is not far from that of [LOC France  ] . 
President [PER Obama  ] 's ambition for a world without nuclear weapons is sincere , but grounded in reality , and the [LOC United States  ] will not act precipitously or jeopardize core [MISC French  ] interests or our relationship . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] added that disarmament language in coming international forums , such as the [ORG April Nuclear Security Summit  ] and the [ORG May Review Conference  ] for the [ORG Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT RevCon  ] ) , is important to the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , the [LOC United States  ] also wants a strong focus on non-proliferation . 
[PER Tauscher  ] stressed that the [ORG USG  ] wanted to work with [LOC France  ] to strike the right balance between disarmament and nonproliferation . 
The [LOC United States  ] remains committed to an effective deterrent , and the President 's recent budget proposal includes a significant increase for the maintaining of [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear forces . 
Additionally , the forthcoming [ORG Nuclear Posture Review  ] ( [ORG NPR  ] ) will strengthen extended deterrence , focusing on the quality of the deterrent force rather than quantity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Expressing relief at the [ORG USG  ] commitment to coordination with [LOC France  ] , [PER Richier  ] and [PER Maisonnave  ] nevertheless both stressed the [MISC French  ] commitment to its nuclear deterrent , and [PER Richier  ] said the [MISC French  ] worry that any unwelcome changes to [LOC U.S.  ] declaratory policy in the [ORG NPR  ] could signal a [LOC U.S.  ] intention to insert the same policies into the [MISC NATO Strategic Concept  ] . 
[PER Richier  ] noted that any such attempt could impact [LOC France  ] 's ability to integrate its nuclear forces into [ORG NATO  ] . 
In such a situation they would have to declare their strategic forces totally independent . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] responded that the [MISC French  ] would not be surprised by the [ORG NPR  ] because consultation would be ongoing , adding that the [LOC United States  ] has no intention of acting unilaterally on nuclear issues in the [ORG NATO  ] context . 
[PER Richier  ] noted that [LOC France  ] was working on a paper that looks at its nuclear policy . 
As a result of their review , the [ORG GOF  ] has concluded that their criteria for use are very limited. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Levitte  ] asked when the administration was planning on pushing for ratification of the [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] ( [MISC CTBT  ] ) , as [LOC U.S.  ] ratification would be key to [MISC Chinese  ] ratification , the true [MISC French  ] goal . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] said that getting the post-START treaty ratified would be a first priority , but that discussions of [MISC CTBT  ] would start soon , including an upcoming report by the [ORG National Academy of Sciences  ] . 
[PER Levitte  ] stated that only when the [LOC U.S.  ] ratifies the [MISC CTBT  ] will it be possible to put real pressure on the [MISC Chinese  ] . 
On a fissile material cutoff treaty ( FMCT ) , [PER Richier  ] said the [MISC French  ] have " reason to believe " that [LOC China  ] has been pushing [LOC Pakistan  ] to keep up its opposition to starting negotiations at the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] , adding that [LOC Pakistan  ] does not seem to care that it is isolated. ----------------------- [ORG NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Richier  ] and [PER Maisonnave  ] both reiterated [LOC France  ] 's position that the [ORG April Nuclear Security Summit  ] in [LOC Washington  ] should address radiological threats in addition to nuclear material . 
They also expressed [ORG GOF  ] opposition to language in the draft communique calling for a " world without nuclear [LOC PARIS  ] 00000193 002 OF 003 weapons . 
" [PER U/S Tauscher  ] suggested that while the [LOC United States  ] would insist on having disarmament language in the communique , the formulation agreed to in the [ORG G8  ] statement from the July 2009 [LOC L'Aquila  ] summit may allow consensus . 
( NOTE: " We are...committed to...creating the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons , in accordance with the goals of the [ORG NPT  ] " . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Richier  ] and [PER Maisonnave  ] agreed that [LOC France  ] could accept this language . 
They did note their concern that it may be difficult for all 44 countries invited to the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] to agree to this language , since some are not [ORG NPT  ] members. ---------- [ORG NPT REVCON  ] ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Richier  ] and [PER Maisonnave  ] agreed with [PER U/S Tauscher  ] 's analysis that [MISC Egyptian  ] FM [MISC Aboul-Gheit  ] will , if unchecked , work to undermine the [ORG RevCon  ] with an aggressive posture on the [LOC Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free Zone  ] ( [ORG NWFZ  ] ) resolution . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] outlined ongoing [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to gain consensus language on the [ORG NWFZ  ] , but underlined the need to contemplate a more forward-leaning strategy . 
She suggested considering possible phone calls from Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] directly to [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] in the mid-March timeframe to sensitize the [MISC Egyptian  ] president to the importance of the [ORG RevCon  ] in strengthening the [ORG NPT  ] and the unhelpful role the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG MFA  ] is playing . 
The [MISC French  ] agreed on the likely need to elevate the issue beyond [MISC Aboul-Gheit  ] . 
In this context , [PER U/S Tauscher  ] also brainstormed with the [MISC French  ] on a final " package deal " that could be offered to the [MISC Egyptians  ] , including new consensus language on a [ORG NWFZ  ] , a conference on civilian nuclear power in the [LOC Middle East  ] , and/or pushing [LOC Israel  ] to accept [MISC CTBT  ] . 
( NOTE: The latter two were uncleared , spontaneous [MISC French  ] suggestions . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] said that , if [LOC Egypt  ] is still not willing to budge , it may be worth finding other [MISC Non-Aligned Movement  ] states that could be separated from [LOC Egypt  ] with promises of assistance that [LOC Egypt  ] would no longer receive. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Levitte  ] said that progress on [LOC Middle East  ] peace prior to the [ORG RevCon  ] would help greatly in creating a constructive atmosphere , adding that he would pursue discussions on this linkage at the February 5-7 [ORG Munich Security Conference.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Richier  ] suggested that , in the absence of an acceptable and substantive final document , it may be possible to capitalize on other events prior to the [ORG RevCon  ] , including the September [ORG UN Security Council  ] summit , the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] , and the March OECD-hosted civilian nuclear energy conference in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Richier  ] said it may be worth looking into how to repackage the positive results achieved or expected at these events in a statement or document at the [ORG RevCon  ] that acknowledges their importance in strengthening the [LOC NPT.  ] ---- [LOC IRAN  ] ---- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Levitte  ] said that the [MISC French  ] ambassador in [LOC Tehran  ] believes that there is a growing split between the population and the regime that may be irreparable . 
The [MISC Iranian  ] population thinks that action against the regime by the international community is good and [LOC France  ] believes that it is important to support publicly those protesters taking to the street . 
[PER Levitte  ] noted that he had talked to [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Mottaki  ] in [LOC Davos  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] , in an attempt to get the [MISC Iranians  ] to accept the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor Deal  ] . 
[PER Mottaki  ] stated that [LOC Iran  ] had " new ideas " but did not provide any details . 
[PER Levitte  ] stated that [LOC Iran  ] was counting on tension between [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Beijing.  ] --------------- MISSILE DEFENSE --------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Levitte  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] is in the early stages of an interagency review on missile defense ( [LOC MD  ] ) . 
According to him , the " old guard " sees [LOC MD  ] as a threat to [LOC France  ] 's nuclear deterrent , but he added that President [PER Sarkozy  ] has publicly stated that [LOC MD  ] is in fact a welcome complement to deterrence . 
[LOC France  ] has no money for a [ORG NATO  ] system , but would be happy to contribute specific capabilities . 
He added that President [PER Sarkozy  ] would not see specific proposals on the way forward for several weeks . 
[PER Richier  ] added that the more details the [LOC United States  ] can provide on its own plans , the easier it is to " arbitrate between different factions " in the [MISC French  ] [LOC PARIS  ] 00000193 003 OF 003 government . 
In the [ORG NATO  ] context , [PER Maisonnave  ] 's deputy and [ORG NATO  ] specialist [PER Muriel Domenach  ] said [LOC France  ] 's concerns about funding required for [LOC MD  ] were amplified by its judgment that the costs for programs approved for common funding inevitably seem to rise after approval is given. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER U/S Tauscher  ] and DAS [PER Frank Rose  ] clarified that the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Phased Adaptive Approach  ] ( [ORG PAA  ] ) was the [LOC U.S.  ] national contribution to a [ORG NATO  ] system , and that the [ORG USG  ] would provide all funding . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] stressed that the main [LOC U.S.  ] priority was to gain political support at the head of state level for making territorial [LOC MD  ] a [ORG NATO  ] mission at the 2010 [ORG NATO  ] summit in [LOC Lisbon  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] wants [ORG NATO  ] 's Active [ORG Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense  ] ( [ORG ALTBMD  ] ) to provide the backbone to the [MISC Phased Adaptive Approach  ] but that we would not make the [LOC Lisbon Summit  ] a donors' conference. ------------ OTHER ISSUES ------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On the [ORG Conventional Armed Forces in Europe  ] ( [ORG CFE  ] ) [ORG Treaty  ] , [PER Maisonnave  ] noted that the [MISC French  ] government believes that the [ORG Treaty  ] is dead . 
But , paradoxically , everyone believes it is a good treaty and there is no consensus on how to move forward . 
[LOC Germany  ] , for example , does not believe it is dead . 
The [MISC French  ] believe that it would be better to take a [LOC Vienna  ] [MISC Document-type  ] approach to achieve some of the objectives of the [ORG CFE Treaty.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Both [PER Richier  ] and [PER Maisonnave  ] raised the issue of the [ORG EC-151 Eurocopter  ] . 
[PER Richier  ] noted that [LOC France  ] classified it as a civilian helicopter . 
The [MISC French  ] were concerned that the [LOC U.S.  ] review on this issue continued to be postponed . 
[PER U/S Tauscher  ] agreed to look into this matter . 
She noted that a visit to the [MISC French  ] factory was to occur soon and promised to get back to the [MISC French  ] as soon as possible .
