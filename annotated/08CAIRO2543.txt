CAIRO  ] 2175 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 2141 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Margaret Scobey  ] per 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary and Introduction: General [PER Petraeus  ] , welcome to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Your visit will be , I hope , the first in a regular process of dialogue and consultation with [MISC Egyptian  ] leaders who view the [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] security partnership as the cornerstone of the bilateral relationship . 
This visit provides an opportunity for you to assess the state of our military partnership and to identify new opportunities . 
To date , the [LOC U.S.  ] investment in the [MISC Egyptian  ] Armed Forces ( over $36 billion since 1980 ) through the [ORG Foreign Military Financing  ] ( [ORG FMF  ] ) program has supported peace between [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] and assured [MISC Egyptian  ] support for extending peace to the rest of the [MISC Arab  ] world . 
In addition , the [MISC Egyptian  ] military has the potential to become interoperable with [LOC U.S.  ] forces * capable of fighting side by side as they did in the 1991 [MISC First Gulf War  ] - and continues to provide critical [LOC Suez Canal  ] and overflight access for [LOC U.S.  ] military operations and to provide peacekeepers to regional and international conflict zones. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [LOC United States  ] has sought to interest the [MISC Egyptian  ] military into expanding their mission in ways that reflect new regional and transnational security threats , such as piracy , border security , and counterterrorism . 
[LOC Egypt  ] , s aging leadership , however , has resisted our efforts and remains satisfied with continuing to do what they have done for years: train for force-on-force warfare with a premium on ground forces and armor. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) We have requested meetings with President [PER Mubarak  ] , Defense Minister [PER Field Marshal Tantawi  ] , EGIS Chief General [PER Soliman  ] , and Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] . 
The overall [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] relationship has suffered in the past few years . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] have lost confidence in [LOC U.S.  ] regional leadership . 
They believe that the [LOC U.S.  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] was an unmitigated disaster that has unleashed [MISC Iranian  ] regional ambitions and that the [LOC U.S.  ] waited far too long to engage in [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] peacemaking efforts . 
In addition , [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] differences over the pace and direction of political reform have drained the warmth from the relationship on both sides . 
We believe President [PER Mubarak  ] would be interested in an early visit to [LOC Washington  ] to consult with President [PER Obama  ] , in large part to try to begin repairing the relationship . 
End Summary. ------------------------------------------- Mil-Mil Cooperation: In Need of Renovation ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mubarak  ] and military leaders view the [ORG FMF  ] program as the cornerstone of our security relationship and believe the $1.3 billion annual grant should be viewed as " untouchable compensation " for making peace with [LOC Israel  ] . 
They complain that the parity between [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to [LOC Israel  ] and to [LOC Egypt  ] has been destroyed as [LOC U.S.  ] security assistance to [LOC Israel  ] has climbed and theirs has remained fixed . 
We have come to take the [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] security partnership for granted , but we should not underestimate its value to us and the region . 
Our partnership guarantees there can be no resumption of overt [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] war and also provides valuable [LOC US  ] military access to the [LOC Suez Canal  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] airspace . 
We would not like to contemplate complications for [LOC U.S.  ] regional interests should the [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] bond be seriously weakened . 
Nevertheless , we recognize the backward-looking nature of [LOC Egypt  ] , s military posture and believe that finding new , mutually agreed objectives could assure the continuation of our strategic ties with [LOC Egypt  ] into the future. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Seventy-seven year old [PER Field Marshall Tantawi  ] , in office since 1991 , has resisted any change to usage of [ORG FMF  ] funding and has been the chief impediment to transforming the military , s mission to meet emerging security threats . 
During his tenure , the tactical and operational readiness of the [MISC Egyptian  ] Armed Forces ( [ORG EAF  ] ) has decayed . 
But he retains [PER Mubarak  ] 's support , and could easily remain in place for years to come . 
[PER Tantawi  ] will likely express his opposition to [ORG Congress  ] conditioning military and economic assistance and will seek support in convincing [ORG Congress  ] of [LOC Egypt  ] 's strategic importance . 
He will also make a case for the release of certain military systems such as the TOW [ORG IIB  ] and [MISC F-15  ] fighter aircraft . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00002543 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) You should assure [PER Mubarak  ] and [PER Tantawi  ] that [LOC Egypt  ] remains a key [LOC U.S.  ] ally , but that we would like to find new areas of cooperation that build on existing relationships but that look to meeting new threats . 
Such a development would help us defend the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG FMF  ] program by demonstrating its ongoing value. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Threats to this partnership exist . 
Although all previous [MISC Administrations  ] and [ORG Congresses  ] since Camp [PER David  ] have reaffirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to a strategic [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] relationship , the events of the last few years have made a few cracks in the foundations . 
[ORG Congressional  ] concern about [LOC Egypt  ] , s poor human rights and democracy record prompted the imposition in 2008 of conditions upon [LOC Egypt  ] , s assistance program . 
Although the Secretary of State was given the right to waive the conditionality , the [MISC Egyptians  ] view conditionality as " unacceptable . 
" We are currently dealing with the conditionality issue for [MISC FY2009.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The potential for [ORG Congressional  ] action that could affect [MISC Egyptian  ] FMF/ESF funding , creates even greater reason for [LOC Egypt  ] to begin to orient more of its military capabilities toward unconventional threats . 
The more [MISC Egyptian  ] military cooperation can be viewed as backstopping [LOC U.S.  ] military requirements in the region , the easier it is to defend the [MISC Egyptian  ] assistance program on the [PER Hill  ] . 
Over the last year , we have engaged [ORG MOD  ] leaders on developing shared objectives to address current threats , including border security , counter terrorism , civil defense , and peace-keeping . 
Our efforts thus far have met with limited success . 
After initially strong resistance , [ORG MOD  ] supported the first phase of a $23 million FMF-funded counter-smuggling system soon to be installed on the [MISC Gaza-Egyptian  ] border ( ref A ) . 
You should encourage [PER Tantawi  ] to immediately approve the follow-on stages and stress the importance of using the knowledge gained from the seismic-acoustic equipment to destroy tunnels and break up arms smuggling rings. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) One way to demonstrate [LOC Egypt  ] 's continued strategic importance is through shifting more [ORG FMF  ] funding to address asymmetric threats like terrorism and improving border security along its long and porous borders . 
You should also stress with GOE interlocutors that our mil-mil relationship is much greater than the yearly flow of military assistance . 
[LOC Egypt  ] could play a much more active and influential role in regional security issues , including supporting and training the [MISC Iraqi  ] military , deploying more peace keeping troops to [LOC Sudan  ] , joining neighbors in combating piracy , and stemming the flow of illegal migration . 
Another such concrete display of a more forward looking security strategy would be to support [ORG CENTCOM  ] 's efforts to re-invent [ORG BRIGHT STAR  ] . 
[PER Tantawi  ] will lament the loss of large-scale [ORG BRIGHT STAR  ] . 
You should stress that [ORG BRIGHT STAR  ] continues to be an important strategic statement for the [LOC U.S.  ] and its regional allies , and solicit his input for ways to make [ORG BRIGHT STAR  ] more relevant. ---------------- Regional Efforts ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While the military remains inwardly focused , [PER Mubarak  ] and key [MISC Egyptian  ] officials remain engaged on a number of regional issues . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , although President [PER Mubarak  ] remains deeply suspicious that [ORG Nuri Al Maliki  ] answers to [LOC Tehran  ] , other GOE officials have expressed increasing confidence that [LOC Iraq  ] has turned a corner and may avoid civil war . 
Foreign Minister [PER Aboul Gheit  ] recently completed a successful trip to [LOC Baghdad  ] in October ( ref B ) and is moving forward to reopen the Embassy in [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
On the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict , GOE efforts to facilitate intra-Palestinian reconciliation under the auspices of [ORG EGIS  ] Chief General [PER Soliman  ] foundered in November due , in their view , to [MISC Iranian-Syrian  ] meddling . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] is concerned by rising [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region and has supported [ORG UN  ] sanctions , but does not have a comprehensive strategy to counter [LOC Iran  ] 's regional momentum . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] have worked with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and other [MISC Arab  ] states to support [MISC Lebanese  ] political and territorial sovereignty. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] is a steadfast ally in the [LOC GWOT  ] , and we maintain close cooperation on a broad range of counter-terrorism and law enforcement issues . 
We have a long-standing and productive relationship with [ORG EGIS  ] and [ORG SSIS  ] , the two [MISC Egyptian  ] agencies that cover internal and regional [LOC CAIRO  ] 00002543 003 OF 003 terrorism issues . 
Through the [ORG Department of State 's Anti-Terrorism Assistance  ] program , we are working with [ORG SSIS  ] to establish an anti-terror investigative unit , and also are in the beginning stages of a [MISC USG-funded  ] community policing program that will include needed human rights training. ------------------------------- Internal Politics and Economics ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Our fundamental political reform goal in [LOC Egypt  ] remains democratic transformation , including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism , respect for human rights , and a stable and legitimate transition to the post-Mubarak era . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] democracy and human rights efforts , however , are being suffocated , and [PER Mubarak  ] remains skeptical of our role in democracy promotion , lecturing us that any efforts to open up will result in empowering the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ( which currently holds 86 seats in [LOC Egypt  ] 's parliament ) . 
[PER Mubarak  ] now makes scant public pretense of advancing a vision for democratic change . 
An ongoing challenge remains balancing our security interests with our democracy promotion efforts. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mubarak  ] , who is now 80 , is in solid health , notwithstanding a hearing deficit in his left ear . 
The next presidential elections are scheduled for 2011 , and if [PER Mubarak  ] is still alive it is likely he will run again , and , inevitably , win . 
Despite incessant whispered discussions , no one in [LOC Egypt  ] has any certainty about who will eventually succeed [PER Mubarak  ] , nor how the succession will happen . 
[PER Mubarak  ] himself seems to be trusting to [PER God  ] and the inertia of the military and civilian security services to ensure an orderly transition . 
The most likely contenders for next president are presidential son [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] ( whose profile is ever-increasing at the ruling party ) , [ORG EGIS  ] chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] , dark horse [ORG Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa  ] , another old-guard regime insider , or an as-yet unknown military officer. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Economic reform has been a success story , although [LOC Egypt  ] still suffers from widespread and so far irremediable poverty affecting upwards of 35-40% of the population . 
Reforms in trade and tax policy , financial reform , privatization and increased transparency have led to 7% economic growth in the last fiscal year . 
Foreign investment increased from around $3 billion in 2005 to $11 billion in the last year , mostly in the petroleum sector . 
Despite this success , significant problems remain , including 20% inflation , high levels of poverty and unemployment , and endemic corruption . 
The effects of the global financial crisis on [LOC Egypt  ] may not be as severe as elsewhere , as [MISC Egyptian  ] banks operate very conservatively and have been spared involvement in risky financial products . 
The informal economy also provides a certain degree of resiliency to the economic picture . 
Nevertheless , as the economic crisis worsens , [LOC Egypt  ] remains vulnerable as exports , [LOC Suez  ] canal revenues , tourism , and remittances will reflect global trends. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] economic assistance will drop from $415 million in FY 2008 to $200 million annually for the next five years starting in FY 2009 . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] are not pleased with the cut and have suggested several ways of using the assistance that would be difficult to get through [ORG Congress  ] , such as debt relief . 
We would like to focus assistance on health care and education reform along with poverty alleviation . 
Negotiations are ongoing over use of future assistance funds .
