End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) Following up on [ORG CDA  ] 's request earlier in the week for [ORG Embassy  ] access to [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi , [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Executive Director [PER Youssef Sawani  ] called a meeting with P/E Chief February 20 to inform the [ORG Embassy  ] that it could have a " quick , discreet visit " with el-Jahmi later that day . 
Noting that the decision to facilitate [ORG Embassy  ] access to el-Jahmi was hotly debated within the [ORG GOL  ] , [PER Sawani  ] stressed that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , son of leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , personally intervened to argue that it would constitute an important gesture to the [ORG USG  ] . 
The visit should be interpreted as " a clear reflection " of Said al-Islam 's desire to keep [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] bilateral relations on a positive course , he said . 
MEETING WITH EL-JAHMI 3 . 
( C ) P/E Chief , together with [PER Muhammad Tarnesh  ] , Executive Director of the [ORG QDF-affiliated Human Rights Society of Libya  ] , met briefly with el-Jahmi 's treating physician , Dr. [PER Abdulrahman Mehdy  ] , and then spent nearly an hour with el-Jahmi at the [ORG Tripoli Medical Center  ] ( [ORG TMC  ] ) February 20 . 
( Note: The [ORG TMC  ] is considered one of the best hospitals in the country . 
Care at the facility , which features better-trained physicians and more diagnostic and laboratory equipment than other hospitals , is good by comparison with the relatively low standards of other medical facilities in [LOC Libya  ] . 
End note . 
) Present in the room with el-Jahmi were [PER Tarnesh  ] , [PER Mehdy  ] and an individual who was identified as his nurse , [PER Abdullah Bashir  ] . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER El-Jahmi  ] is housed alone in a clean , single-bed room that features a wash basin and private toilet facilities . 
The room was located in what appeared to be a less heavily-trafficked section of the hospital ; however , other than a lock on the room door , there were no guards or other visible indications of extra security . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] said he had been in the same room since being admitted to the [ORG TMC  ] in late July 2007 . 
Other than trips to the lab and other diagnostic centers in the [ORG TMC  ] , he has not been allowed to leave his room . 
Noting that he has not been allowed to raise the blinds in his room , he complained that he has not seen natural sunlight since his admission . 
[ORG INITIAL MEDICAL CONDITION AND TREATMENT  ] 5 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] indicated that the el-Jahmi 's condition was " severe " when he was transferred from the [LOC Abu Salim  ] prison facility on [LOC Tripoli  ] 's outskirts to the [ORG TMC  ] in late July 2007 . 
At that time , el-Jahmi was hypertensive , had congestive heart failure and severe difficulty breathing , suffered from severe edema and diabetes , and had urological complications attendant to prostitis . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] was unable to lie down because of his breathing difficulties ( he could only sleep in a sitting position ) and could not urinate because his groin had swelled so much due to edema . 
[PER Mehdy  ] stressed that he performed diagnostic exams and prescribed treatment ( catheterization to alleviate the urological problem ) immediately after el-Jahmi 's admission . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] received no further treatment until late December/early January . 
[ORG CURRENT MEDICAL CONDITION AND PROGNOSIS  ] 6 . 
( C ) [PER El-Jahmi  ] was clear-eyed , alert and lucid during the meeting . 
While clearly advanced in age and somewhat limited by his medical conditions ( his breathing was observed to be a bit labored ) , he was animated and verbose . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] said treatment at the [ORG TMC  ] , once administration of his prescribed medication commenced in late December/early January , had been very good and assessed that his condition had improved a great deal . 
Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] concurred , explaining that el-Jahmi 's breathing has improved dramatically ( he is now able to lie down ) , his edema has abated considerably ( there is still some swelling in his legs ) , his blood sugar levels have normalized , and EKG tests show his heart function has improved significantly . 
7 . 
( C ) Assessing el-Jahmi 's prognosis , Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] said another EKG will be performed in several weeks to determine whether a coronary angiography will be needed to correct diminished capacity in the left ventricle of el-Jahmi 's heart . 
He cautioned that el-Jahmi 's overall condition , particularly his heart pumping capacity , is not strong enough at present for the procedure to be performed ; at least two to three months of further treatment and recovery are needed . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] is on a restricted , low-salt and low-sugar diet to moderate the effects of his diabetes ; that condition appears to have stabilized but will require continued monitoring . 
Regarding el-Jahmi 's urological issues , Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] has twice recommended to el-Jahmi that he have surgery for his prostate condition ( once at the time of admission , and again in January ) . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] has so far refused to consent to the procedure . 
Dr. [PER Mehdy  ] clearly indicated that the [ORG TMC  ] has the resources to provide all care needed to stabilize and/or treat el-Jahmi 's conditions . 
FAMILY VISITATION LIMITED 8 . 
( C ) [PER El-Jahmi  ] said he his eldest son had visited him three times on three consecutive days in January . 
Before that , it had been more than four years since his wife , four daughters and two other sons had been able to visit him . 
He complained that he does not have access to radio , television or reading materials , either at the prison at which he was previously detained or at the [ORG TMC  ] . 
He complained that even his copy of the [MISC Koran  ] had been confiscated in late January for reasons that were unclear to him . 
LEGAL STATUS UNCERTAIN 9 . 
( C ) [PER El-Jahmi  ] said he had not been advised , formally or informally , that the [ORG GOL  ] might release him to return home for further treatment , but said he " sensed " that the [ORG GOL  ] 's attitude concerning his case might be changing . 
( Comment: The [ORG QDF  ] 's [PER Sawani  ] emphasized to the CDA February 21 that the [ORG QDF  ] has made it clear to the family that [PER Fathi  ] could be released to their care , but so far the family has not followed up on the offer , nor on the [ORG QDF  ] 's requests that they return to the hospital to visit [PER Fathi  ] . 
End comment . 
) [PER El-Jahmi  ] did not know whether the son who visited him or other family members have received any further information concerning his possible release . 
He did not know whether he would be able to travel abroad for treatment if he were released and noted that the [ORG GOL  ] holds his passport . 
[PER El-Jahmi  ] said he understands he has been convicted under a [MISC Libyan  ] law that criminalizes advocating a political position inconsistent with the 1969 revolution , and for defaming leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] . 
10 . 
( C ) Asked by P/E Chief whether -- as has been suggested by [ORG QDF  ] -- he would be willing to agree to an " understanding " that he would remain silent about his detention or any political issues in exchange for the opportunity to return to his home , [PER El-Jahmi  ] repeatedly made it clear that he is not/not prepared to agree to that stipulation , or any other condition , to secure his release . 
He described himself as " a democratic man " and said he was unwilling to sacrifice his political beliefs to gain his release . 
Saying that his principal offense had been to criticize [PER Qadhafi  ] and his regime , he said the [MISC Libyan  ] courts had ruled that he was mentally incompetent . 
Joking , he said the prevailing mentality in [LOC Libya  ] is such that to criticize [PER Qadhafi  ] was considered the act of a madman . 
COMMENT 11 . 
( C ) While we lack the expertise to comment on the adequacy of el-Jahmi 's medical treatment , [PER El-Jahmi  ] himself reported that , at least as of December 2007 , he has been receiving care that [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000142 003 OF 003 has led to an improvement in his health . 
As for his future , [PER El-Jahmi  ] , who appeared to be in full possession of his mental faculties , clearly expressed his intention to reject any deal the [ORG GOL  ] might offer to allow him to return home in exchange for his silence .
