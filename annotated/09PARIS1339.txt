( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC U.S.  ] government representatives met [MISC French  ] , [MISC British  ] , and [ORG European Union  ] officials on September 10 in [LOC Paris  ] to review efforts to address the security threat posed by terrorism in [LOC Africa  ] 's [LOC Sahel  ] and [LOC Maghreb  ] regions . 
There was broad agreement that the [ORG USG  ] , [LOC France  ] , and other third countries should identify areas of cooperation and mechanisms to coordinate and de-conflict efforts to improve multilateral and individual country capacity in the region to address immediate and long-term threats from al-Qaeda in the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) . 
The discussions focused on factors influencing the region 's ability to address the [ORG AQIM  ] threat , including the [LOC Sahel  ] countries' lack of law enforcement and military capacity ; the complexity of state relations with its nomadic populations , e.g. the [PER Tuareg  ] and Berbiche ethnic groups , the profitability of illicit trade and kidnapping networks ; the need for [LOC Algeria  ] to work more closely with its neighbors ; the importance of better donor coordination ; and undermining recruitment efforts that could expand the scope of radical [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC West  ] and [LOC Central Africa  ] . 
Participants agreed on the need to meet in the future to exchange information regarding each other 's efforts in region . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Assistant Secretary of State for [MISC African Affairs  ] [PER Johnnie Carson  ] led a high-level interagency delegation in discussions with a [MISC French  ] delegation led by Under Secretary for Political Affairs ( P ) -equivalent Policy Director [PER Jacques Audibert  ] and [ORG Africa A/S-equivalent  ] [PER Stephane Gompertz  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC French  ] delegations were joined by [MISC British  ] and [ORG European Union  ] counterparts for the afternoon session . 
The discussion began with an exchange of information on the current security and political situation in the [LOC Sahel  ] , which [PER Gompertz  ] described as [LOC France  ] 's " main area of concern " in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] and was followed by exchanges on a wide range of critical factors related to the region 's terrorist threat . 
[PER Martin Julliard  ] , [LOC France  ] 's Head of [ORG Transnational Threats Section  ] , [ORG Strategic and Security Affairs Department  ] at the [ORG MFA  ] , said that [ORG AQIM  ] 's political agenda was not well understood and was evolving over time . 
He noted that [ORG AQIM  ] is targeting westerners , but it was not clear whether it wanted to challenge the legitimacy of governments or even the states . 
Participants noted that while [ORG AQIM  ] 's northern group remains concentrated on [LOC Algeria  ] , elements of the southern group have shifted away from acting primarily as logistical support for northern operations and have increased planning and operations in the [LOC Sahel  ] . 
It was emphasized that the southern group remained linked with its northern leadership , but has made inroads in recruiting in the [LOC Sahel  ] , particularly in [LOC Mauritania  ] , and has increased the scope and sophistication of its operations in parts of the [LOC Sahel  ] during the past year . 
[ORG USG  ] and [MISC French  ] participants considered whether there were opportunities to exploit apparent divisions within [ORG AQIM  ] . 
[PER Remi Marechaux  ] , an [ORG Africa Advisor  ] to President [PER Sarkozy  ] summed up the situation succinctly , " we feel we are losing the battle between improved development in these countries and the increasing security threats in the region . 
" LACK OF CAPACITY ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There was broad agreement among the participants that the focus countries of the conference ( [LOC Mauritania  ] , [LOC Mali  ] , and [LOC Niger  ] ) lack the resources to fully control their vast territories . 
In addition , lack of governmental capacity remains a serious hindrance in terms of military/security effectiveness and developmental progress . 
The [ORG EU  ] chair noted that each country posed specific challenges for partners in addressing security threats: -- [LOC Mali  ] , where in addition to capacity constraints , there are questions about the government 's willingness to confront and engage [ORG AQIM  ] militarily , despite clear indications that [ORG AQIM  ] maintains a degree of impunity within its [ORG Northern Mali  ] " sanctuaries . 
" S/CT Coordinator [PER Daniel Benjamin  ] noted that [LOC Mali  ] is perhaps becoming more helpful , but [MISC French  ] speakers consistently referred to the [MISC Malian  ] position as " ambiguous " and " enigmatic ; " -- [LOC Mauritania  ] , which may possess greater political will for taking-on [ORG AQIM  ] , but political instability following the recent coup hampered efforts to support its [ORG CT  ] efforts ; and [LOC PARIS  ] 00001339 002 OF 005 -- [LOC Niger  ] , where recent un-democratic maneuvering by President [PER Tandja  ] makes it difficult to offer new assistance . 
[ORG NSC Senior Advisor  ] [PER Michelle Gavin  ] underscored that our [ORG CT  ] efforts cannot undercut our governance and democracy priorities in [LOC Africa  ] . 
While remarking that President [PER Tandja  ] had already " won his gamble " to secure a third term and the [MISC French  ] will focus their attention on pushing for credible elections , [PER Gompertz  ] stated that [LOC France  ] did not have a clear strategy to balance its [ORG CT  ] objectives with the urgency of promoting good governance and constitutional rule in the country . 
PROFITS FROM ILLICIT TRADE AND KIDNAPPING ----------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC France  ] 's MOD Director of [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] [PER Pascal Texeira  ] noted that [ORG AQIM  ] is commonly understood to have only about 150 fighters in the [LOC Sahel  ] , but it has significant financial resources for obtaining weapons and logistic support such as vehicles and radios from profitable illicit trafficking networks , including arms , people , drugs , and other contraband . 
Of even greater concern is [ORG AQIM  ] 's apparent success in securing large ransom sums for kidnapped westerners . 
When asked , [LOC U.K.  ] FCO Director for [MISC Africa  ] [PER Adam Wood  ] confirmed that following the January murder of [LOC U.K.  ] hostage [PER Edwin Dyer  ] , his country would play a more active role in the region , and would certainly support an AU initiative at the [ORG UN  ] to rally international opposition against ransom payments in cases of piracy and hostage-taking , which he believed was being spearheaded by [LOC Algeria  ] . 
Participants had not yet seen a draft of the resolution. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Developing a better understanding of [PER Tuareg  ] activities and motivations was seen as an important priority , especially since they develop ad-hoc agreements with [ORG AQIM  ] elements in support of trafficking and perhaps kidnapping . 
[PER Texeira  ] stated that [LOC Mali  ] views the threat of a new [PER Tuareg  ] rebellion as more dangerous than that from [ORG AQIM  ] , and neither [LOC Mali  ] nor [LOC Niger  ] could count on [PER Tuareg  ] leaders to fight against [ORG AQIM  ] . 
[MISC French  ] and [ORG USG  ] analysts also noted that breakdowns in traditional ethnic political , social and economic networks was potentially destabilizing . 
NEED TO INVOLVE [LOC ALGERIA  ] ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER A/S Carson  ] raised the importance of getting [LOC Algeria  ] involved in multi-national efforts to combat [ORG AQIM  ] , and also for [LOC Algeria  ] to work in concert directly with [LOC Mali  ] to disrupt [ORG AQIM  ] and criminal networks . 
" There can be no solution without [LOC Algeria  ] , " according to [PER Texeira  ] , who thought that [LOC Algeria  ] would work with regional partners , but did not want to be implicated with " outside players . 
" They noted that [LOC Algeria  ] engages in limited intelligence-sharing and has made inquiries about other forms of counterterrorism assistance , but remains reticent about enhanced cooperation with potential western partners . 
Participants viewed positively [LOC Algeria  ] 's plans to organize a regional security summit in the coming months , but they agreed that there was relatively little information about summit objectives or the agenda . 
TREAT OF SPREADING RADICALISM ----------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The potential spread of [ORG AQIM  ] ( or some other brand of radicalized and violent [MISC Islam  ] ) in [LOC Africa  ] was also a recurring issue . 
In particular , participants expressed deep concern that northern [LOC Nigeria  ] is at risk of such influence . 
[ORG AQIM  ] personnel or facilitators had also reportedly been identified in [LOC Niger  ] and [LOC Senegal  ] recently . 
[LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] and [LOC Guinea  ] are also at risk should [ORG AQIM  ] make greater inroads into the [MISC West African  ] narcotics trade , according to [MISC Gilles  ] de [PER Kerchove  ] , the [ORG European Union Council  ] 's Coordinator for [ORG Counter Terrorism  ] . 
Part of the problem is that disenfranchised young men from the southern parts of the [LOC Sahel  ] are moving north and joining the group . 
Participants agreed on the need for a greater understanding of how [ORG AQIM  ] successfully recruited militants/fighters/suicide bombers , especially from [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
( Note: during a lunchtime conversation , [LOC France  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Mauritania  ] explained to INR Analyst [LOC PARIS  ] 00001339 003 OF 005 [PER Bernadette Graves  ] and [ORG Embassy Paris Africa Watcher  ] that he sees no clear trend , nor does he understand the reasons for , [ORG AQIM  ] 's apparent success in recruiting young [MISC Mauritanians  ] . 
He notes that these recruits have come from a variety of backgrounds and ethnic groups and the trend does not fit the commonly held view of [LOC Mauritania  ] as a moderate , tolerant [MISC Muslim  ] country with [MISC Sufi  ] traditions . 
End note . 
) DONOR COORDINATION ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One of the goals of the conference , and a recurring theme , was to improve assistance co-ordination among donors . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC France  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] provide a range of military and security training in the region . 
Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] discussed the background and goals of the [LOC U.S.  ] interagency [ORG Trans-Saharan Counter Terrorism Partnership  ] ( [ORG TSCTP  ] ) . 
He noted that [ORG TSCTP  ] was a broad-based holistic approach to supporting regional [ORG CT  ] efforts that includes military and law enforcement capacity-building , public diplomacy/strategic communications , and support for local and national good governance . 
[ORG USAID Deputy Assistant  ] Administrator [PER Earl Gast  ] observed that development indicators in the [LOC Sahel  ] are among the worst in the world and [ORG USAID  ] involvement in [ORG USG  ] counter-extremism programming reflects that the regional vulnerability to terrorism is increased by the lack of employment opportunities for youth and poor or nonexistent governance and service delivery in large swaths of territory. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC France  ] is focused on responding to [LOC Mali  ] 's request to assist its efforts to establish four forward operating bases in its northern frontier . 
It is also exploring how to support efforts to improve [MISC Malian  ] administration and local governance in the north and improve customs and border security . 
[PER Gompertz  ] stated that [LOC France  ] has security dialogues with [LOC Niger  ] and [LOC Mali  ] and would soon initiate discussions with [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] also highlighted the urgency of assisting countries with judicial reform , training of prosecutors and magistrates , and criminal procedures. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG EU  ] completed an assessment of [LOC Mali  ] in July and will visit [LOC Mauritania  ] in October , but has postponed plans to visit [LOC Niger  ] due to the current political situation . 
Future assistance may include border surveillance and customs services , and [LOC Sweden  ] 's Ambassador for [ORG Counter Terrorism  ] [PER Carin Wall  ] highlighted the [ORG EU  ] 's desire to collaborate more closely with other actors , " not least the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) All three donors have or are considering programs in judicial processes and law-enforcement . 
[PER A/S Johnson  ] explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] will likely establish a [ORG Regional Security Training Center  ] in [LOC West Africa  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] noted that it is considering something similar: a [MISC Sahel-based  ] " multi-functional " regional training center focusing on military , law enforcement , and border control and customs capacity building . 
The [ORG EU  ] and [MISC French  ] representatives highlighted the importance of building academies and " clearinghouses " to provide training to a range of security organs. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The participants agreed to collect and share detailed information about the specific programs and projects each is pursuing or considering in the region as the first step for further consultations and coordination . 
Towards the end of the event , [PER A/S Carson  ] encouraged the participants to find the time and means to expand this type of dialog into other areas in need of greater mutual understanding and coordination in [LOC Africa  ] , including the way forward in [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , and the [LOC Great Lakes  ] , and also for transboundary issues such as demographic pressures , democracy , and development priorities . 
[PER A/S Johnson  ] added judicial reform , including best practices in corrections as another timely need . 
" LEAD FROM THE SIDE " -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The three-plus groups agreed that supporting regional [LOC CT  ] efforts in the [LOC Sahel  ] was an important immediate and long-term priority , but there was a clear consensus that external actors must ensure that they limit visibility of their activities and avoid actions that would be seen as undercutting regional leadership over the issue . 
[ORG Elysee PARIS  ] 00001339 004 OF 005 Advisor [PER Marechaux  ] noted that the [MISC French  ] had not crafted a " [LOC Sahel  ] plan " in order to avoid a potential backlash from [MISC Sahelian  ] and [LOC Maghreb  ] states suspicious of its intentions in the region . 
He noted that increasing the " profile " of the [ORG AQIM  ] problem would likely enhance the group 's Jihadist " credentials " and attract potential recruits from inside and outside the region . 
[PER A/S Carson  ] agreed: " We don , t want to become part of the problem by appearing to take the lead ; we need to lead from the side , not from out front . 
" He noted that raising the profile of external actors in the region risked alienating key [MISC Sahelian  ] interlocutors and further risked assisting [ORG AQIM  ] recruiting and resourcing efforts . 
Ambassador [PER Benjamin  ] agreed that it was vital to ensure that the counterterrorism effort had a " local face . 
" COMMENT ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This gathering will likely prove the kick-off to further discussions and closer cooperation . 
The [MISC French  ] and the [ORG EU  ] reps were willing to share their analysis of the situation , but were clearly also ready to defer to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's assessment . 
More than one [MISC French  ] participant who later joined a [MISC POL-hosted  ] reception noted how impressed they were with the high level of participation by the [LOC U.S.  ] and by [PER A/S Carson  ] 's positive role as co-Chair of the event .
