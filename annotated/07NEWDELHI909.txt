( S ) Summary: Embassy [LOC New Delhi  ] warmly welcomes the visit of Acting Coordinator for [ORG Counterterrorism Frank Urbancic  ] , and looks forward to adding dynamism to the [MISC India-U.S  ] . 
Counter-Terrorism Joint Working Group ( [ORG CTJWG  ] ) and developing an atmosphere where ideas and information are easily exchanged by both sides in an atmosphere of trust . 
Goals for the [ORG CTJWG  ] include better integration of efforts regarding bioterrorism , money laundering , terrorist financing , tracking terrorist movements , law enforcement , border security , and information sharing/operational cooperation . 
The [MISC GOI’s  ] traditional concerns over [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Pakistan  ] and longstanding distrust left over from the [MISC Cold War-era  ] between our intelligence communities have been difficult to overcome . 
However , the sustained increase in acts of violence by political and religious extremists in [LOC India  ] have demanded better cooperation on counter-terrorism . 
In a recent meeting , your counterpart , [ORG Ministry of External Affairs Additional Secretary  ] ( [ORG International Organizations  ] ) [ORG KC Singh  ] , mentioned favorably the idea of semi-annual meetings between GOI and S/CT , and he clearly sees the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC CT  ] relationship as among [MISC India’s  ] most important . 
Improving our counter-terrorism cooperation is a crucial step in building the strategic relationship President [PER Bush  ] envisions with [LOC India  ] , and your visit offers us an excellent chance to do so . 
End Summary . 
Reviving a [ORG Stalled Working Group  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Your visit comes nearly a year after the last [MISC U.S.-India  ] [ORG CTJWG  ] , which was held in [LOC Washington  ] in May 2006 . 
Although the working group was supposed to be held regularly throughout the year , it has stalled until now for two important reasons . 
The first was a scandal in [LOC New Delhi  ] in summer 2006 , in which our primary working-level [MISC CT  ] interlocutor at the [ORG Indian National Security Council  ] was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly passing information to the [LOC United States  ] . 
Although there is little truth to the espionage accusations , the scandal cast a negative shadow over the [ORG CTJWG  ] , and slowed further discussions for several months . 
In a recent discussion with the DCM , [ORG KC Singh  ] raised this scandal again , noting that it was impacting his effort to build a [MISC U.S.-India  ] dialogue on cyber terrorism . 
Second , [MISC Indian  ] officials were extremely concerned about the August 2006 agreement between [MISC Pakistani  ] officials and [MISC Waziri  ] tribesmen in the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] because of their ongoing concern about Afghanistan’s stability . 
[MISC India’s  ] criticism of our Counter-Terror cooperation with [LOC Pakistan  ] reached a new intensity after the Waziristan agreement , as [MISC Indian  ] officials bitterly accused their [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC CT  ] counterparts of failing to take [MISC India’s  ] concerns into account in allowing the agreement to go forward . 
Since then we have worked to reduce these tensions , and [PER U/S Burns’  ] visit to [LOC New Delhi  ] , accompanied by [PER Virginia Palmer  ] , in December 2006 went a long way in this regard . 
We have also worked across the inter-agency spectrum to share more information with [LOC India  ] . 
The next step is to revive the [ORG CTJWG  ] and work to expand our operational [MISC CT  ] cooperation . 
Bringing [LOC India  ] on Board to Expand our Counter-Terror Cooperation NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000909 002.2 OF 006 -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [MISC India’s  ] lingering zero-sum suspicion of [LOC U.S.  ] policies towards [LOC Pakistan  ] , its fiercely independent foreign policy stance , its traditional go-it-alone strategy toward its security , and its domestic political sensitivities over the sentiments of its large [MISC Muslim  ] population , have all contributed to [MISC India’s  ] caution in working with us on a joint counter-terrorism strategy . 
While [LOC India  ] has been very keen to receive information and technology from us to further its counter-terrorism efforts , [LOC India  ] provides little in return , despite our belief that the country should be an equal partner in this relationship . 
[LOC India  ] frequently rebuffs our offers of support for their police investigations of terrorist attacks , and our offers of training and support are often met with a stalled logistical pace . 
For example , our Legatt offered forensic and investigative support to [LOC India  ] in the wake of the [ORG Samjauta Train  ] bombings , but [LOC India  ] refused . 
One of the most important tasks we will have with [LOC India  ] at the [ORG CTJWG  ] is to reinforce that we must make this relationship reciprocal . 
We must keep in mind that it will be a slow process to build the kind of trust necessary with [LOC India  ] to achieve the relationship that we are seeking , but we must reinforce to our [MISC Indian  ] counterparts the positive direction we seek for our partnership. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Another consideration to keep in mind is that our perception of [MISC India’s  ] lack of cooperation on [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC CT  ] concerns often stems in part from [MISC India’s  ] lack of capacity to manage these issues bureaucratically . 
[LOC India  ] just this month began to stand up a [MISC Counter-Terrorism  ] [ORG Cell  ] in the MEA’s office of [ORG International Organizations  ] . 
The [ORG Cell  ] was put in place largely to manage [MISC India’s  ] new Counter-Terrorism Joint Mechanism with [LOC Pakistan  ] , including bringing [MISC India’s  ] intelligence agencies in line with the Prime Minister’s thinking on [MISC India’s  ] relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
This [ORG Cell  ] will now bring five additional people on board to manage these issues , although all of the arrangements are still being handled by just two officers . 
Additionally , [MISC India’s  ] police and security forces are overworked and hampered by bad police practices , including the wide-spread use of torture in interrogations , rampant corruption , poor training , and a general inability to conduct solid forensic investigations . 
[MISC India’s  ] most elite security forces also regularly cut corners to avoid working through [MISC India’s  ] lagging justice system , which has approximately 13 judges per million people . 
Thus [MISC Indian  ] police officials often do not respond to our requests for information about attacks or our offers of support because they are covering up poor practices , rather than rejecting our help outright. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) That said , using every opportunity available to signal our interest in learning from [LOC India  ] -- which has successfully tackled “asymmetrical” insurgencies in [LOC Punjab  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] -- will go a long way to reduce this distrust and may prompt [MISC Indian  ] officials to be more receptive to our offers of support . 
There is much [LOC India  ] could offer us of value to strengthen our counter-terrorism efforts . 
For instance , they can give us more information about the nature of the terrorist threat in [LOC India  ] and [LOC South Asia  ] , and help us develop new strategies for defeating terrorists derived from [MISC India’s  ] experience in [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
They also may have information about [MISC Bangladeshi  ] , [MISC Nepalese  ] , [MISC Sri Lankan  ] , and [MISC Pakistani  ] terrorists that they could share . 
NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000909 003.2 OF 006 Relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Your visit comes a little over a week after the horrific bombing of the [ORG Samjauta  ] ( “Friendship” ) Train between [LOC New Delhi  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC Lahore  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Most of the 68 killed in the fires that destroyed two of the train’s coaches were lower-middle class [MISC Pakistani  ] mohajirs ( emigrants from [LOC India  ] ) who came to [LOC India  ] to visit relatives after years of separation . 
While investigations continue to find the culprits , the [MISC Indian  ] press is hinting that [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] or another [MISC Pakistan-based  ] terrorist group was behind the attacks . 
If this is true , it would not be the first time that [MISC Pakistan-based  ] terrorists have killed fellow [PER Sunni Muslims  ] on [MISC Indian  ] soil . 
Police investigators tell us that all of the evidence [LOC India  ] has found in the September 2006 attacks in a [PER Sunni  ] mosque in [LOC Malegon  ] points to [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] , which , along with the [MISC Pakistan-based  ] terrorist groups such as Jaish-e-Muhammad , HUM , is trying to foment religious tension as a means of boosting recruitment and hindering [MISC Indo-Pak  ] peace efforts. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Despite bombings in [LOC Panipat  ] , [LOC Malegon  ] , [LOC Mumbai  ] , [LOC Varanassi  ] , [LOC Delhi  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] in the past year , this year marks probably the closest period of friendship between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] since their [LOC Independence  ] from [LOC Great Britain  ] in 1947 . 
The two countries are working closer to resolve their dispute over [LOC Kashmir  ] , and even amidst the tragedy of the train bombing [MISC Pakistani  ] Foreign Minister [PER Kasuri  ] traveled to [LOC New Delhi  ] on February 20th to continue the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] . 
Both sides have signaled their strong intention to continue with talks , despite the terrorists’ efforts to disrupt the peace process . 
Nonetheless , [LOC India  ] remains frustrated with [MISC Pakistan’s  ] seeming inaction against terrorist groups in [LOC Pakistan  ] , who have launched multiple attacks in [MISC India’s  ] heartland . 
Near weekly arrests of terrorists here are a constant reminder that these groups are working to establish sleeper cells in [LOC India  ] as relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] continue to improve . 
[LOC India  ] is also concerned about infiltration of [MISC Pakistani  ] terrorists through [LOC Bangladesh  ] and [LOC Nepal  ] , as well as local terrorists’ connections to [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and al-Qaida . 
[LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] are holding their first [MISC Counter-Terrorism Joint  ] Mechanism meeting on March 6th in [LOC Islamabad  ] to build better dialogue on these issues . 
This Mechanism is designed to keep talks going between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] regardless of continued terrorist attacks , and it is important that the [MISC Indian  ] press does not confuse our [MISC Counter-Terrorism Joint Working Group  ] with the [MISC India-Pakistan Counter-Terrorism Joint-Mechanism.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) Despite [MISC India’s  ] progress with [LOC Pakistan  ] , [MISC Indian  ] officials continue to advise us that our direct intervention in [MISC Indo-Pak  ] negotiations could hamper the Prime Minister’s efforts to move the process forward . 
Opposition BJP leaders charge frequently that [LOC India  ] is selling out on [LOC Kashmir  ] or soft on [LOC Pakistan  ] at the behest of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Indian  ] officials are extremely tight-lipped about the negotiations between the two countries , and they often bristle at any outside government’s attempt to push the process forward . 
Your Meeting with [ORG NSA Narayanan  ] ------------------------------- NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000909 004.2 OF 006 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) One very important meeting we are scheduling for you for Thursday , March 1st , is with [ORG National Security Advisor MK Narayanan  ] . 
As a former intelligence official , no other senior [ORG Congress Party  ] leader has more influence over [PER PM Singh  ] and party chief [PER Sonia Gandhi’s  ] decision making on national security issues than [PER Narayanan  ] . 
[PER Narayanan  ] is traditionally tough-talking , and will speak his mind about how he sees our CT cooperation progressing . 
This will be an opportunity to stress our interest in making the relationship more reciprocal , and we will provide you with a list of all of the information we have passed to the [ORG GOI  ] in recent months with a direct comparison to what we have received in return . 
You should tell [PER Narayanan  ] that we are overcoming our concerns , and we seek similar improvement of attitudes in the [MISC Indian  ] security agencies , whose paranoia remains undiminished . 
Important Points for the [ORG CTJWG  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC South Asia  ] terrorism issues: [PER KC Singh  ] is taking the lead on this session , and may use the opportunity to talk about [MISC India’s  ] concerns about [LOC Pakistan  ] even as the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] moves ahead . 
He will likely brief you on the terrorist groups operating in [LOC Pakistan  ] that are launching attacks in [LOC India  ] . 
He will also discuss [MISC India’s  ] concern about stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This may be an opportunity to discuss our strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in response to the anticipated [ORG Taliban Spring  ] offensive as well as preparations for the [MISC SAARC  ] meetings in [LOC New Delhi  ] on April 3-4 . 
You should stress that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC India  ] have common goals against terrorists in [LOC South Asia  ] , that we believe groups like [LOC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] have become a global threat , one that we all face with [LOC India  ] . 
You could also stress our efforts -- through both engagement and pressure -- to press [LOC Pakistan  ] to crack down on all of the terrorist groups operating on its soil , as well as our continued concern about infiltration through [LOC Bangladesh  ] and [LOC Nepal  ] , and the progress we have seen in [LOC Islamabad’s CT  ] cooperation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Middle East  ] terrorism issues: You are taking the lead on this session . 
[LOC India  ] is very concerned about the security situation in [LOC Iraq  ] , partially because of a concern that instability and sectarian violence between [PER Sunni  ] and [PER Shia Muslims  ] there will spill over into [LOC India  ] . 
With [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC India  ] has had some recent differences over the nuclear issue . 
Nonetheless , [LOC India  ] enjoys fairly good relations with most countries in the [LOC Middle East  ] , including [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [LOC India  ] may be a positive partner for the [LOC U.S.  ] in bringing stability to the region . 
[PER KC Singh  ] was Ambassador in [LOC Tehran  ] , and can give you superb insight on the [MISC Iranian  ] regime. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Bioterrorism: You will make a few remarks and then [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] will take over the presentation . 
We have a number of efforts in place to discuss bioterrorism issues and biosecurity , including a proposal from 2005 for a joint exercise in response to a bioterrism attack . 
Our [MISC Indian  ] counterparts have signaled their interest to press ahead with these programs. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) WMD Terrorism: You will make a few remarks on this session , and then hand the discussions off to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Our [MISC Indian  ] counterparts are likely to remain silent during this session , although they have said they will NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000909 005.2 OF 006 listen to the presentation , and [PER KC Singh  ] may respond briefly . 
These discussions could impact the ongoing negotiations over the [MISC U.S.-India  ] nuclear deal , and [MISC Indian  ] officials want to avoid any discussion of safeguarding their nuclear material . 
They will not have the permission necessary from higher-level officials to address this issue at all in response to our briefing. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG ATA Training  ] and [ORG Law Enforcement Cooperation:  ] You will begin the discussion and then our [ORG RSO  ] will continue with his briefing . 
We need more cooperation and , frankly , openness from the [ORG Ministry of Home Affairs  ] in order to achieve this program’s full potential. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The delegation will participate in informal working-level break out sessions over lunch with our [MISC Indian  ] hosts . 
This may be an opportunity to discuss any outstanding issues from the previous sessions with [PER KC Singh  ] , and raise our concerns about [MISC Indian  ] bureaucratic inertia and paranoia. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Terrorism Finance and [ORG Anti-Money Laundering  ] Legislation: [PER KC Singh  ] will lead this session , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] will provide our response . 
Discussion will be focused on prompting the [ORG GOI  ] to improve their anti-money laundering regime and compliance with international standards under the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) to combat incidents of terrorism financing . 
[ORG GOI  ] is currently participating as a [ORG FATF  ] observer for the first time at the ongoing [ORG FATF  ] Plenary meeting from February 19-23 . 
We want to use the [ORG CTJWG  ] platform to listen to GOI’s growing concerns about terrorist financing for future consideration to provide relevant technical assistance. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Biometrics and [ORG Border Security:  ] You will begin this session and then hand the discussions off to [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Airline/Airport Security  ] and [ORG Anti-Hijacking Policy:  ] [PER KC Singh  ] will lead this session . 
He may discuss some of the various threats [LOC India  ] has seen lately to its commercial airlines . 
He will likely follow up on our previous offer of assistance and anti-hijacking training , as well as [MISC India’s  ] new hijacking policy , which would affect direct flights by [LOC Delta  ] , [MISC American  ] , [ORG Continental  ] , and [MISC Northwest  ] airlines. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ideological Dimensions of Countering Terrorism: [PER KC Singh  ] will lead this session . 
He will likely discuss [MISC India’s  ] frustrations in dealing with [LOC Pakistan  ] on terrorism issues . 
He may , however , initiate a more in-depth discussion of Prime Minister Singh’s efforts on behalf of those who are disenfranchised among [MISC India’s Muslim  ] population . 
The purpose of this session is to initiate a discussion on local facilitators of terrorist attacks in [LOC India  ] by the country’s minority [MISC Muslim  ] population , and to learn from [MISC India’s  ] many decades of experience in this area . 
20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Information Sharing and [ORG Enhancing Cooperation:  ] This will be a closed-door discussion of our efforts to increase intelligence sharing . 
This may be the most crucial segment of the discussion , and [ORG ORA  ] will take the lead in the presentation . 
Our [ORG RSO  ] may also discuss our efforts to gain more information from the [ORG GOI  ] about terrorist threats to [LOC US  ] interests in [LOC India  ] and sharing of information about arrests of terrorist suspects . 
The [ORG GOI  ] will likely discuss a new NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000909 006.2 OF 006 point of contact the [ORG MEA  ] is establishing in the new [ORG CT Cell  ] to answer these questions. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The meetings will be followed by a wrap up discussion and a [MISC GOI-hosted  ] dinner . 
Summary: A Real Opportunity ---------------------------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: Overall your efforts in [LOC India  ] will be an important step toward our goal of building a strategic partnership with [LOC India  ] . 
Without a more effective [ORG CT  ] component , and if [LOC India  ] remains suspicious of our [ORG CT  ] intentions , our overall relationship will not live up to its potential . 
As you approach the meetings , the most important element will be to break down the barriers we face to building a more productive partnership with our [ORG GOI  ] counterparts , including at a working level . 
Our measure of success should be in taking steps forward , however small , toward achieving this operational goal . 
End Summary .
