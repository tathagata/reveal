01 [ORG TUNIS 2971 Classified  ] By: Ambassador [PER Robert F. Godec  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) According to [ORG Transparency International  ] 's annual survey and Embassy contacts' observations , corruption in [LOC Tunisia  ] is getting worse . 
Whether it 's cash , services , land , property , or yes , even your yacht , President [PER Ben Ali  ] 's family is rumored to covet it and reportedly gets what it wants . 
Beyond the stories of the [ORG First Family  ] 's shady dealings , [MISC Tunisians  ] report encountering low-level corruption as well in interactions with the police , customs , and a variety of government ministries . 
The economic impact is clear , with [MISC Tunisian  ] investors -- fearing the long-arm of " the Family " -- forgoing new investments , keeping domestic investment rates low and unemployment high ( Refs G , H ) . 
These persistent rumors of corruption , coupled with rising inflation and continued unemployment , have helped to fuel frustration with the [ORG GOT  ] and have contributed to recent protests in southwestern [LOC Tunisia  ] ( Ref A ) . 
With those at the top believed to be the worst offenders , and likely to remain in power , there are no checks in the system . 
End Summary. ------------------- The Sky 's the Limit ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) According to [ORG Transparency International  ] 's 2007 index , the perception is that corruption in [LOC Tunisia  ] is getting worse . 
[LOC Tunisia  ] 's ranking on the index dropped from 43 in 2005 to 61 in 2007 ( out of 179 countries ) with a score of 4.2 ( with 1 the most corrupt and 10 the least corrupt ) . 
Although corruption is hard to verify and even more difficult to quantify , our contacts all agree that the situation is headed in the wrong direction . 
When asked whether he thought corruption was better , worse , or the same , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] exclaimed in exasperation , " Of course it 's getting worse ! 
" He stated that corruption could not but increase as the culprits looked for more and more opportunities . 
Joking about [LOC Tunisia  ] 's rising inflation , he said that even the cost of bribes was up . 
" A traffic stop used to cost you 20 dinars and now it 's up to 40 or 50 ! 
" ----------------- All in the Family ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) President [PER Ben Ali  ] 's extended family is often cited as the nexus of [MISC Tunisian  ] corruption . 
Often referred to as a quasi-mafia , an oblique mention of " the Family " is enough to indicate which family you mean . 
Seemingly half of the [MISC Tunisian  ] business community can claim a [PER Ben Ali  ] connection through marriage , and many of these relations are reported to have made the most of their lineage . 
[PER Ben Ali  ] 's wife , [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] , and her extended family -- the [MISC Trabelsis  ] -- provoke the greatest ire from [MISC Tunisians  ] . 
Along with the numerous allegations of [PER Trabelsi  ] corruption are often barbs about their lack of education , low social status , and conspicuous consumption . 
While some of the complaints about the [PER Trabelsi  ] clan seem to emanate from a disdain for their nouveau riche inclinations , [MISC Tunisians  ] also argue that the [MISC Trabelsis  ] strong arm tactics and flagrant abuse of the system make them easy to hate . 
[PER Leila  ] 's brother [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] is the most notorious family member and is rumored to have been involved in a wide-range of corrupt schemes from the recent [ORG Banque de Tunisie  ] board shakeup ( Ref B ) to property expropriation and extortion of bribes . 
Leaving the question of their progenitor aside , [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] 's holdings are extensive and include an airline , several hotels , one of [LOC Tunisia  ] 's two private radio stations , car assembly plants , [ORG Ford  ] distribution , a real estate development company , and the list goes on . 
( See Ref K for a more extensive list of his holdings . 
) Yet , [PER Belhassen  ] is only one of [PER Leila  ] 's ten known siblings , each with their own children . 
Among this large extended family , [PER Leila  ] 's brother [PER Moncef  ] and nephew Imed are also particularly important economic actors. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The President is often given a pass , with many [MISC Tunisians  ] arguing that he is being used by the [PER Trabelsi  ] clan and is unaware of their shady dealings . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] a strong supporter of the government and member of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told the Ambassador that the problem is not [PER Ben Ali  ] , but " the Family " going too far and breaking the rules . 
Nevertheless , it is hard to believe [PER Ben Ali  ] is not aware , at least generally , of the growing corruption problem . 
This might also reflect the seeming geographical divisions between the [ORG Ben Ali  ] and [PER Trabelsi  ] fiefdoms , with the [ORG Ben Ali  ] clan reportedly focused on the central coastal regional and the [PER Trabelsi  ] clan operating out of the greater [ORG Tunis  ] area and therefore , generating the bulk of the gossip . 
The [ORG Ben Ali  ] side of the Family and his children and in-laws from his first marriage are also implicated in a number of stories . 
[ORG Ben Ali  ] has seven siblings , of which his late brother [PER Moncef  ] was a known drug trafficker , sentenced in absentia to 10 years prison in the [MISC French  ] courts . 
[ORG Ben Ali  ] has three children with his first wife [PER Naima Kefi: Ghaouna  ] , [PER Dorsaf  ] and [PER Cyrine  ] . 
They are married respectively to [PER Slim Zarrouk  ] , [PER Slim Chiboub  ] , and [PER Marouane Mabrouk  ] -- all significant economic powers. -------------------------------------------- This Land is Your Land , This Land is My Land -------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) With real estate development booming and land prices on the rise , owning property or land in the right location can either be a windfall or a one-way ticket to expropriation . 
In summer 2007 , [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] received a desirable tract of land in [LOC Carthage  ] for free from the [ORG GOT  ] in order to build the for-profit [ORG Carthage International School  ] ( Ref F ) . 
In addition to the land , the school received a 1.8 million dinar ( [LOC US  ] $1.5 million ) gift from the [ORG GOT  ] , and within a matter of weeks the [ORG GOT  ] had built new roads and stoplights to facilitate school access . 
It has been reported that [PER Ms. Ben Ali  ] has sold the [ORG Carthage International School  ] to [MISC Belgian  ] investors , but the [MISC Belgian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] has as yet been unable to confirm or discount the rumor . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that the school was indeed sold for a huge , but undisclosed sum . 
He noted any such sale would be pure profit since [PER Ms. Ben Ali  ] 's received land , infrastructure , and a hefty bonus at no cost. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Construction on an enormous and garish mansion has been underway next to the Ambassador 's residence for the past year . 
Multiple sources have told us that the home is that of [PER Sakhr Materi  ] , President [PER Ben Ali  ] 's son-in-law and owner of [ORG Zitouna Radio  ] . 
This prime real estate was reportedly expropriated from its owner by the [ORG GOT  ] for use by the water authority , then later granted to [PER Materi  ] for private use . 
A cafe owner recounted a similar tale to an [ORG Embassy  ] employee , reporting that [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] forced him to trade in a cafe he previously owned in a prime location for his current cafe . 
The cafe owner stated [PER Trabelsi  ] told him he could do whatever he wanted there ; if 50 dinar bribes to the police were not effective , [PER Trabelsi  ] said the owner had only to call him and he would " take care of it . 
" ------------ Yacht Wanted ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In 2006 , Imed and [PER Moaz Trabelsi  ] , [PER Ben Ali  ] 's nephews , are reported to have stolen the yacht of a well-connected [MISC French  ] businessman , [PER Bruno Roger  ] , Chairman of [ORG Lazard Paris  ] . 
The theft , widely reported in the [MISC French  ] press , came to light when the yacht , freshly painted to cover distinguishing characteristics , appeared in the [LOC Sidi Bou  ] Said harbor . 
[PER Roger  ] 's prominence in the [MISC French  ] establishment created a potential irritant in bilateral relations and according to reports , the yacht was swiftly returned . 
The stolen yacht affair resurfaced in early 2008 due to an [ORG Interpol  ] warrant for the two [MISC Trabelsis  ] . 
In May , the brothers were brought before [MISC Tunisian  ] courts , in a likely effort to satisfy international justice . 
The outcome of their case has not been reported. ------------------ [ORG Show Me Your Money  ] ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) [LOC Tunisia  ] 's financial sector remains plagued by serious allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement . 
[MISC Tunisian  ] business people joke that the most important relationship you can have is with your banker , reflecting the importance of personal connections rather than a solid business plan in securing financing . 
The legacy of relationship-based banking is a sector-wide rate of non-performing loans that is 19 percent , which remains high but is lower than a high of 25 percent in 2001 ( Ref I ) . 
Embassy contacts are quick to point out that many of these loans are held by wealthy [MISC Tunisian  ] business people who use their close ties to the regime to avoid repayment ( Ref E ) . 
Lax oversight makes the banking sector an excellent target of opportunity , with multiple stories of " First Family " schemes . 
The recent reshuffle at [ORG Banque de Tunisie  ] ( Ref B ) , with the Foreign Minister 's wife assuming the presidency and [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] named to the board , is the latest example . 
According to a representative from [ORG Credit Agricole  ] , [PER Marouane Mabrouk  ] , another of [PER Ben Ali  ] 's sons-in-law , purchased a 17 percent share of the former [ORG Banque du Sud  ] ( now [PER Attijari Bank  ] ) shares immediately prior to the bank 's privatization . 
This 17 percent share was critical to acquiring controlling interest in the bank since the privatization represented only a 35 percent share in the bank . 
The [ORG Credit Agricole  ] rep stated that [PER Mabrouk  ] shopped his shares to foreign banks with a significant premium , with the tender winner , [PER Spanish-Moroccan Santander-Attijariwafa  ] ultimately paying an off the books premium to [PER Mabrouk  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] recounted that when he was still at his bank he used to receive phone calls from panicked clients who stated that [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] had asked them for money . 
He did not indicate whether he advised them to pay. ----------------------- The [ORG Trickle Down Effect  ] ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While the stories of high-level , Family corruption are among the most flagrant and oft-repeated , [MISC Tunisians  ] report encountering low-level corruption more frequently in their daily lives . 
Speeding tickets can be ignored , passports can be expedited , and customs can be bypassed -- all for the right price . 
Donations to the [ORG GOT  ] 's 26-26 Fund for development or to the [ORG Bessma Society  ] for the Handicapped -- [PER Leila Ben Ali  ] 's favored charity -- are also believed to grease the wheels . 
[PER Hayet Louani  ] ( protect ) , a well-connected member of Parliament , faced increased pressure from the [ORG GOT  ] after refusing several " requests " to donate money to [PER Trabelsi  ] 's soccer team . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported that customs inspectors demanded 10,000 dinars to get his goods through customs ; he did not reveal whether or not he acquiesced to the demand. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Nepotism is also believed to play a significant role in awarding scholarships and offering jobs . 
Knowing the right people at the [ORG Ministry of Higher Education  ] can determine admission to the best schools or can mean a scholarship for study abroad . 
An Embassy FSN stated that the Director of [ORG International Cooperation  ] , a long-time contact , offered to give his son a scholarship to [LOC Morocco  ] on the basis of their acquaintance . 
If you do not know someone , money can also do the trick . 
There are many stories of [MISC Tunisians  ] paying clerks at the [ORG Ministry of Higher Education  ] to get their children into better schools than were merited by their test scores . 
Government jobs -- a prize in [LOC Tunisia  ] -- are also believed to be doled out on the basis of connections . 
[PER Leila Ben Ali  ] 's late mother , [PER Hajja Nana  ] , is also reported to have acted as a broker for both school admissions and government job placement , providing her facilitation services for a commission . 
Among the complaints from the protestors in the mining area of [LOC Gafsa  ] were allegations that jobs in the [ORG Gafsa Phosphate Company  ] were given on the basis of connections and bribery. --------- [PER Mob Rule  ] ? --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The numerous stories of familial corruption are certainly galling to many [MISC Tunisians  ] , but beyond the rumors of money-grabbing is a frustration that the well-connected can live outside the law . 
One [MISC Tunisian  ] lamented that [LOC Tunisia  ] was no longer a police state , it had become a state run by the mafia . 
" Even the police report to the Family ! 
" he exclaimed . 
With those at the top believed to be the worst offenders , and likely to remain in power , there are no checks in the system . 
The daughter of a former governor recounted that [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] flew into her father 's office in a rage -- even throwing an elderly office clerk to the ground -- after being asked to abide by laws requiring insurance coverage for his amusement park . 
Her father wrote a letter to President [PER Ben Ali  ] defending his decision and denouncing [PER Trabelsi  ] 's tactics . 
The letter was never answered , and he was removed from his post shortly thereafter . 
The [ORG GOT  ] 's strong censorship of the press ensures that stories of familial corruption are not published . 
The Family 's corruption remains a red line that the press cross at their own peril . 
Although the February imprisonment of comedian [PER Hedi Oula  ] Baballah was ostensibly drug-related , human rights groups speculate his arrest was punishment for a 30 minute stand-up routine spoofing the President and his in-laws ( [PER Tunis D  ] ) . 
[ORG International NGOs  ] have made the case that the harsh prison conditions faced by journalist [PER Slim Boukdhir  ] , who was arrested for failing to present his [ORG ID  ] card and insulting a police officer , are directly related to his articles criticizing government corruption . 
Corruption remains a topic relegated to hushed voices with quick glances over the shoulder. ------------------------ The Elephant in the Room ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Several [MISC Tunisian  ] economists argue that it does not matter whether corruption is actually increasing because " perception is reality . 
" The perception of increasing corruption and the persistent rumors of shady backroom dealings has a negative impact on the economy regardless of the veracity . 
Contacts tell us they afraid to invest for fear that the family will suddenly want a cut . 
" What 's the point ? 
" [PER Alaya Bettaieb  ] asked , " The best case scenario is that my investment succeeds and someone important tries to take a cut . 
" Persistently low domestic investment rates bear this out ( Ref H ) . 
Foreign bank accounts , while illegal , are reportedly commonplace . 
A recent [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] amnesty to encourage [MISC Tunisians  ] to repatriate their funds has been an abject failure . 
Bettaeib stated that he plans to incorporate his new business in [LOC Mauritania  ] or [LOC Malta  ] , citing fear of unwanted interference . 
Many economists and business people note that strong investment in real estate and land reflects the lack of confidence in the economy and an effort to keep their money safe ( Ref C ) . <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Thus far , foreign investors have been undeterred , and according to [MISC Tunisian  ] business contacts , largely unaffected . 
Foreign investment continues to flow in at a healthy rate , even excluding the privatizations and huge [LOC Gulf  ] projects which have yet to get underway . 
Foreign investors more rarely report encountering the type of extortion faced by [MISC Tunisians  ] , perhaps reflecting that foreign investors have recourse to their own embassies and governments . 
[ORG British Gas  ] representatives told the Ambassador they had not encountered any impropriety . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that several years ago [PER Belhassen Trabelsi  ] attempted to strong arm a [MISC German  ] company producing in the offshore sector , but that after the [MISC German  ] Embassy intervened [PER Trabelsi  ] was explicitly cautioned to avoid offshore companies . 
Despite pronouncements about increasing domestic investment , the [ORG GOT  ] focuses heavily on increasing FDI flows to the country , particularly in the offshore sector . 
Nevertheless , there are still several examples of foreign companies or investors being pressured into joining with the " right " partner . 
The prime example remains [PER McDonald  ] 's failed entry into [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
When [PER McDonald  ] 's chose to limit [LOC Tunisia  ] to one franchisee not of the [ORG GOT  ] 's choosing , the whole deal was scuttled by the [ORG GOT  ] 's refusal to grant the necessary authorization and [PER McDonald  ] 's unwillingness to play the game by granting a license to a franchisee with Family connections. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Although the petty corruption rankles , it is the excesses of President [PER Ben Ali  ] 's family that inspire outrage among [MISC Tunisians  ] . 
With [MISC Tunisians  ] facing rising inflation and high unemployment , the conspicuous displays of wealth and persistent rumors of corruption have added fuel to the fire . 
The recent protests in the mining region of [LOC Gafsa  ] provide a potent reminder of the discontent that remains largely beneath the surface . 
This government has based its legitimacy on its ability to deliver economic growth , but a growing number of [MISC Tunisians  ] believe those as the top are keeping the benefits for themselves. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Corruption is a problem that is at once both political and economic . 
The lack of transparency and accountability that characterize [LOC Tunisia  ] 's political system similarly plague the economy , damaging the investment climate and fueling a culture of corruption . 
For all the talk of a [MISC Tunisian  ] economic miracle and all the positive statistics , the fact that [LOC Tunisia  ] 's own investors are steering clear speaks volumes . 
Corruption is the elephant in the room ; it is the problem everyone knows about , but no one can publicly acknowledge .
