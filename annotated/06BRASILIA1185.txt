( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG VARIG  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's troubled airline with [MISC USD  ] 3.5 billion in debt , went for auction in two rounds on June 8 . 
After failing to attract any bids at the [MISC USD  ] 860 million minimum in the first round , the company received a [MISC USD  ] 449 million bid from an employees' group ( [ORG TGV  ] ) in the no-minimum-bid second round . 
The Rio judge presiding over the auction has delayed decision about acceptance of the employees' bid . 
Meanwhile , [LOC New York  ] bankruptcy court judges gave [ORG Boeing  ] the go-ahead to repossess 7 aircraft . 
[ORG VARIG  ] 's fuel payment abeyance granted by [ORG Petrobras  ] ran out on June 9 with no signs of a new agreement . 
Consequently , [ORG VARIG  ] was forced to cancel at least 63 flights ( 4 of them indefinitely ) over the period June 10-13 as the airline was unable to pay for fuel . 
Competing airlines [ORG TAM  ] and [ORG GOL  ] are the big winners from the uncertainty , with their stocks rising 12 percent and 5 percent , respectively , in the first day after the auction . 
End Summary . 
A BYZANTINE PROCESS , UNCLEAR RESULTS ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Boeing  ] executive [PER Jose Sicilla  ] explained to Econoff that , in the opinion of industry insiders , the auction , which required up-front injections of cash but offered little security for investors , was destined to fail . 
To comply with [MISC Brazilian  ] investment restrictions , a foreign investor would have to bring in a [MISC Brazilian  ] partner . 
The airline was to be sold in an open bid in which a buyer could purchase [ORG VARIG  ] 's domestic operations ( termed " [ORG VARIG Regional  ] " ) for [MISC USD  ] 700 million or the entire airline ( " [ORG VARIG Operational  ] " ) for [MISC USD  ] 860 million . 
Within , three days after the bid acceptance , the winning bidder , if any , would have had to inject [MISC USD  ] 75 million in cash for immediate operations requirements . 
Thirty ( 30 ) days after purchase , the winning bidder would have had to inject another 50 million in cash into the company . 
[PER Sicilla  ] pointed out that the minimum amount of time required to obtain all the necessary legal operational approvals from [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities is 30-60 days . 
Therefore , the winner , despite having injected up front cash into the operation , could not move quickly to make any major management decisions , for example dealing with the critical issues of downsizing the workforce , the renegotiation of leasing contracts , or achieving a collective bargaining agreement. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the event the winner of the initial round did not receive all the necessary approvals , [PER Sicilla  ] continued , then the second-place bidder would be declared the winner and would have to pay back the first bidder 's investments in the company ( [MISC USD  ] 125 million ) , but would still be required to start the approvals process with [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities from scratch . 
Moreover , if the money to be used to re-pay the first bidder were needed to cover [ORG VARIG  ] operational needs , then the funding could be diverted to that purpose instead , leaving the first bidder out [MISC USD  ] 125 million with nothing to show for its investment . 
The winner would then have to wait through a legal process to recoup its investment . 
" What business would put itself through that ? 
" [PER Sicilla  ] asked. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Initially , [ORG TAM  ] , [ORG GOL  ] , OceanAir , [PER Ceu Azul  ] and [ORG NV Participacoes  ] all paid [MISC Reals  ] 60,000 ( [MISC USD  ] 26,000 ) to access the [ORG VARIG  ] data room , giving them access to what was supposedly the most complete and accurate information on the airline . 
According to [PER Sicilla  ] , nothing could have been further from the truth . 
The data room was open for a mere 7 days , key officers lists in the company were incorrect and valuation data included assets that had been offloaded to [LOC TAP  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] 's flagship carrier . 
FINAL BID ABOUT HALF OF THE ASKING PRICE ---------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the end , only the employees' association [ORG TGV  ] ( [ORG VARIG Workers' Group  ] ) placed a [MISC Reals  ] 1.01 billion ( [MISC USD  ] 449 million ) bid on the entire airline . 
The " winning " 449 million bid came in the second round of bidding , which carried no minimum , after no bids were received in the first round . 
To be valid , the 8th Circuit Court judge in Rio has to accept the terms of the bid . 
The judge delayed his decision to accept the bid from June 9 to June 14 , giving himself the weekend to interpret the law and later placing [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001185 002 OF 003 two more conditions upon the bid . 
First [ORG TGV  ] would have to increase the cash portion of its offer from [MISC USD  ] 125 million to [MISC USD  ] 346 million ( from a 28 percent to a 77 percent cash offer ) . 
Second , the group has to prove it has the obligatory [MISC USD  ] 75 million to inject immediately into the company to pay [ORG VARIG  ] creditors . 
Upon getting the news , some members of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] expressed concern about how the employees would raise cash necessary to make the upfront payments , a detail that has not been clear . 
BIGGEST PROBLEM: UNCERTAINTY ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Many of the interested parties were unclear just what they would be getting themselves into by buying the airline . 
[PER Sicilla  ] estimates that about 46 percent of [ORG VARIG  ] 's [MISC USD  ] 3.5 billion debt is off-balance sheet ( operating leases , synthetic leases , securitizations , special purpose entities , etc . 
) and it is still unclear as to how much exposure the 'winner' leaves itself open . 
Officially , the auction did not include past due liabilities . 
However , legal experts and industry analysts disagree with this simple pronouncement . 
Nothing in [MISC Brazilian  ] law has changed that would prevent any debtor from suing the new owner of [ORG VARIG  ] in court . 
Just as unclear is whether the new owner or creditor litigants would prevail in a court battle . 
Most experts agree that , more than likely , the creditors would. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The airline 's debt to the labor union and the pension fund , taxes owed to the government , and the lack of a collective bargaining agreement mean the airline 's attractiveness to any serious bidder drops to zero , said [PER Sicilla  ] . 
The lack of a collective bargaining agreement is a particular hindrance to any potential suitor , as the new owner would be unable to fire workers to bring the workforce in line with the current minimal operational levels without being sued -- a suit the employees would more than likely win , according to [LOC Sicilla.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Another uncertainty was the question of what exactly the winning bidder would be buying . 
[PER Sicilla  ] cited as an example the failure of the data initially made public to clarify precisely what rights the purchaser of [ORG VARIG  ] regional would gain . 
Only after inquiries from some of the potential bidders was it made clear that the domestic [ORG VARIG  ] operations would not include rights to trunk routes , the domestic routes that feed into [ORG VARIG  ] 's ( relatively ) profitable international routes . 
As public property , the rights to those trunk routes would revert to [ORG ANAC  ] , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Civil Aviation Authority  ] , which would be free to assign routes and airport space as it sees fit . 
[PER Sicilla  ] stated that most of these would not be transferred to [ORG VARIG  ] 's new owner . 
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE LAZY , BUT WHAT'S OUR MOTIVATION ? --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Sicilla  ] noted that private debtors are well down the priority queue to recover their debt once [ORG VARIG  ] is at last declared bankrupt . 
The debt owed private debtors like the 19 [MISC American  ] aircraft leasing companies ( of the total of 29 aircraft lessors ) would receive very low precedence , after the labor union , the pension fund , [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG IRS  ] , [ORG Petrobras  ] and [ORG INFRAERO  ] . 
Aircraft lessors , however , can work to recover their assets , even if they have little prospect of recovering their back payments . 
Until last week , [ORG VARIG  ] had still been paying its largest aircraft lessor , [ORG ILFC  ] , even if not in full , according to [PER Sicilla  ] . 
He added that [LOC Bristol  ] , the company that repossessed its aircraft at [LOC JFK  ] two weeks ago , has 3 more craft with [ORG VARIG  ] and will process the paperwork to get those back . 
FOCUS , a company with 6 MD-11s , intends to pull out their aircraft at lease term end , at the rate of one a month through February 2007 . 
While [ORG Boeing  ] was unable to get some other lessors to agree to take collective action on repossessing their aircraft , the company was able to get the [LOC New York  ] Bankruptcy court judge to grant them the right to repossess seven of the ten aircraft it is leasing to [ORG VARIG  ] . 
[PER Sicilla  ] expects [ORG Boeing  ] to be more successful this time compared to its last abortive attempt to repossess one of its [MISC VARIG-leased  ] aircraft , when [ORG VARIG  ] cancelled a [LOC Miami  ] flight that was serviced with [ORG Boeing  ] 's plane and then switched the aircraft to a [MISC European  ] route . 
From June 10-13 , [ORG VARIG  ] cancelled 63 flights and [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001185 003 OF 003 counting . 
It has also suspended indefinitely four international flights to [LOC Miami  ] , [LOC New York  ] , [LOC Mexico City  ] and [LOC Santiago  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , all of which are served by [ORG Boeing  ] aircraft . 
AND THE WINNERS ARE: [ORG TAM  ] AND [PER GOL  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For a mere [MISC Reals  ] 60,000 , [ORG TAM  ] and [PER GOL  ] , [ORG VARIG  ] 's largest competitors , got a cheap look at just how bad off [ORG VARIG  ] was . 
After seeing what was an unattractive prospect , a [ORG TAM  ] executive offered , " after a detailed analysis of the risk/return , we opted not to make an offer on [ORG VARIG  ] . 
" [PER GOL  ] did not even bother to make an excuse . 
Now , if [ORG VARIG  ] is liquidated , [ORG TAM  ] and [PER GOL  ] will get the bulk of the airport slots and routes . 
As successful airline companies , they look like attractive partners for leasing companies who will court them . 
They are almost guaranteed [ORG VARIG  ] customers for free . 
On the news of the failed auction , [ORG TAM  ] stock jumped 12 percent and [PER GOL  ] stock rose 5 percent the day after the auction . 
May year on year , [ORG TAM  ] improved its local market share to 45.6 percent and [PER GOL  ] increased to 33.6 percent . 
On the international front , [ORG TAM  ] 's market share increased to an all-time high of 28.6 percent , exceeding many analyst expectations . 
Airline industry experts now predict an even higher market share increase by December 2006 . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) None of the proceedings of the auction come as much of a surprise , not even the Rio judge 's weaseling out of an immediate decision . 
The bankruptcy law states that immediate liquidation is required in the case of a failed auction -- and 52 percent of the asking price looks like a failure to us . 
Worse still is the judge 's final decision to place two more requirements on the TGV offer , thus merely postponing [ORG VARIG  ] 's certain death . 
There was a momentary stay of execution for the carrier as creditors waited to see how the auction went . 
Now that the result has come , creditors like [ORG Petrobras  ] -- an immediate threat to [ORG VARIG  ] operations since its agreement to supply gas on credit has not yet been renegotiated -- could pound the final nail into the [ORG VARIG  ] coffin . 
Other leasing creditors will await the results of this week 's ordered return of craft , and more than likely follow suit . 
The lack of fuel , which has already led to numerous flight cancellations , impending repossessions , and failing public confidence may make the Rio judge 's decision moot .
