( C ) Summary: On March 24 , the Ambassador met with [PER Mohammad Ali  ] al-Hweij , the recently-appointed Secretary of the General People 's [ORG Committee for Industry  ] , [ORG Economy and Trade  ] ( [ORG Economy  ] ministry-equivalent ) to discuss economic and trade issues as well as [LOC Libya  ] 's total ban on the import of [ORG Caterpillar  ] 's equipment . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] said [ORG Caterpillar  ] needed to find new agents in [LOC Libya  ] ( as the current ones were sons of government officials ) and welcomed the visit of a [ORG Caterpillar  ] representative and was confident the issue could be solved . 
He also said [LOC Libya  ] wanted [LOC U.S.  ] firms to invest in export free zones to help [LOC Libya  ] diversify its economy away from oil . 
He pledged his ministry 's help in securing [MISC Libyan  ] visas for [MISC American  ] companies . 
End summary . 
[ORG CATERPILLAR BAN:  ] SOLUTION IS MULTIPLE AGENTS AND NO RELATIVES OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Responding to the Ambassador 's urging that the [ORG Caterpillar  ] issue had to be resolved expeditiously , [PER Al-Hweij  ] said he was aware of the problem ( ref A ) , explaining that it was not acceptable for [LOC U.S.  ] companies to have exclusive agents ; rather , the [MISC Libyans  ] would prefer that [ORG Caterpillar  ] work through more than one agent and have multiple distributors throughout the country . 
They would like to see at least three agents with one each covering [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Miserata  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
He noted the current [ORG Caterpillar  ] agents were the sons of government officials , which constituted " corruption " according to the law . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] welcomed the upcoming visit of [ORG Caterpillar  ] 's regional manager , inviting him to come meet with him " anytime . 
" The Ambassador said he appreciated this approach and hoped the issue would be solved before the expected visit of [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi to the [LOC U.S.  ] so that a [ORG Trade and Investment Framework Agreement  ] ( [ORG TIFA  ] ) could be signed . 
He also welcomed [PER Al-Hweij  ] 's confirmation that he would act across the board against any commercial practices that violated existing laws against corruption . 
[LOC U.S.  ] COMPANIES ARE WELCOME TO INVEST IN FREE ZONES <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Hweij  ] said [LOC Libya  ] would like [MISC American  ] firms to invest in " industrial " zones , such as the [ORG Zwara Export Free Zone  ] ( ref B ) , and that he was ready to discuss such projects and the advantages for companies that invest . 
As for privatization , [LOC Libya  ] is processing privatizing 12 companies and expects to complete this process by the end of the year . 
The only sectors left to privatize are [ORG Healthcare  ] and Education which are still under the auspices of the government . 
He noted it would be difficult to privatize universities since the professors were considered government employees and it was not clear how they could be given " shares " in their institutions . 
[PER AL-HWEIJ  ] PLEDGES HELP ON VISAS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Ambassador informed al-Hweij that the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy 's consular section would be issuing [LOC U.S.  ] visas to the general public by the end of this month . 
[PER Al-Hweij  ] welcomed this news and said he pledged his help on securing [MISC Libyan  ] visas for [LOC U.S.  ] business travellers who want to come to [LOC Libya  ] . 
USG PROGRAMS: COMMERCIAL LAW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM , [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC TRADE  ] DELEGATION , AGRICULTURE <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Hweij  ] said the [ORG Department of Commerce  ] 's program to improve the commercial legal environment fit into the [MISC Libyan  ] government 's program of revising its laws , including commercial laws . 
He said the possible visit of a [LOC U.S.  ] lawyer with expertise in this area would be helpful in reviewing their new commercial laws . 
He encouraged more direct dialogue between businessmen and government officials , commenting there should be " no more [MISC Cold War  ] ! 
" He welcomed the visit of a high-level [ORG U.S. Department of Commerce Trade  ] delegation in November , as well as the visits of [ORG U.S. Trade and Development Agency  ] and the [ORG Foreign Agriculture Service  ] . 
He said [LOC Libya  ] welcomed any assistance that could help diversify its economy away from oil , and to increase employment opportunities for young people who constituted half the population . 
The influx of economic immigrants from [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] was another challenge for [LOC Libya  ] . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000258 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: The newly-appointed Secretary for Industry , [ORG Economy and Trade  ] appears determined to resolve the [ORG Caterpillar  ] import ban issue . 
The upcoming visit of the [ORG Caterpillar  ] representative will be a good test of whether al-Hweij , who clearly understands the connection between this issue and future commercial and economic relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , will back up his words with actions . 
His anti-corruption rhetoric is refreshing and laudable if he really intends to apply it across the board as he insisted . 
The ultimate challenge will come when he confronts the extensive commercial corruption of the political elites here , including that of the al-Qadhafi family itself .
