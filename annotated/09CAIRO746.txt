" - ( S/NF ) On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Soliman  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] was " succeeding " in preventing [LOC Iran  ] from funneling financial support to [ORG Hamas  ] through [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] hoped that the [LOC U.S.  ] could encourage [LOC Iran  ] to abandon its nuclear ambitions and stop interfering in regional affairs , but cautioned that [LOC Iran  ] " must pay a price " for its actions. - ( S/NF ) [LOC Egypt  ] is " very concerned " with stability in [LOC Sudan  ] , [PER Soliman  ] said , and was focusing efforts on convincing the [MISC Chadean  ] and [MISC Sudanese  ] presidents to stop supporting each others' insurgencies , supporting negotiations between factions in [LOC Darfur  ] , and implementing the [MISC Comprehensive Peace Agreement  ] ( [ORG CPA  ] ) . 
" [LOC Egypt  ] does not want a divided [LOC Sudan  ] , " [PER Soliman  ] stressed. ---- [LOC Gaza  ] ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S/NF ) [PER Soliman  ] said radicalism was the " backbone " of regional security threats , adding that radicalism in [LOC Gaza  ] posed a particularly serious threat to [MISC Egyptian  ] national security . 
[PER Soliman  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] must " confront " [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to smuggle arms to [LOC Gaza  ] and stop arms smuggling through [MISC Egyptian  ] territory . 
" [LOC Egypt  ] is circled by radicalism , " he continued , expressing concern over instability in [LOC Sudan  ] and [LOC Somalia  ] as well . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's own successful campaign against radicalism in the 1990s provided a useful lesson in how to counteract extremist groups by reducing their ability to operate and raise funds , in additional to educating people on the dangers of extremism . 
[PER Soliman  ] noted that only the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] remained and the [MISC Egyptian  ] government continued to " make it difficult " for them to operate. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S/NF ) " We do not want incidents like [LOC Gaza  ] to inflame public anger , " [PER Soliman  ] said , adding that the [LOC Gaza  ] conflict put " moderate ( [MISC Arab  ] ) regimes " in a corner . 
To prevent another outbreak of violence , [LOC Egypt  ] is focusing on [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation and a durable cease-fire between [ORG Hamas  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
On reconciliation , [PER Soliman  ] explained , the ultimate goal was to return the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] to [LOC Gaza  ] , as " [LOC Gaza  ] in the hands of radicals will never be calm . 
" The problem , however , is that the [LOC PA  ] cannot return to [LOC Gaza  ] without Hamas' acquiescence . 
[PER Soliman  ] said the [LOC PA  ] must return before the January 2010 [MISC Palestinian  ] elections , or else [MISC Gazans  ] would be afraid to vote for moderates. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S/NF ) Stability in [LOC Gaza  ] also depends on giving people a more " normal " life , [PER Soliman  ] continued , saying [LOC Israel  ] must be convinced to regularly open the border crossings for legitimate commercial activity . 
The current system - where [LOC Egypt  ] informs [LOC Israel  ] of a humanitarian shipment and [LOC Israel  ] waits two days before accepting or rejecting the shipment for transfer to [LOC Gaza  ] - does not adequately meet people 's needs. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/NF ) On [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation , [PER Soliman  ] said he expected the factions to return to [LOC Egypt  ] on April 26 to discuss his proposal on establishing a high committee comprised of the various factions . 
The committee would be responsible for preparing for the January 2010 elections , monitoring reconstruction , and reforming the security services in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
On reconstruction , the committee would issue licenses for companies eligible to participate on projects , but the [LOC PA  ] would decide who receives the money for private and government contracts . 
[MISC Arab  ] governments would assist with reforming the security services and could base security assistance out of [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] doubted that [ORG Hamas  ] would agree to the high committee , but said it was important [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000746 002 OF 002 to keep [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Fatah  ] talking , so they would not resort to violence. ----------------------- [LOC Iran  ] , Counter Smuggling ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) [LOC Iran  ] is " very active in [LOC Egypt  ] , " [PER Soliman  ] said .

[LOC Iran  ] has tried several times to pay the salaries for the al-Qassam Battalions , but [LOC Egypt  ] had succeeded in preventing the money from reaching [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] said the [MISC Egyptian  ] government had arrested a " big [ORG Hezbollah  ] cell , " which was [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's first attempt to stand up a cell within [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] was also trying to recruit support from the [PER Sinai Bedouins  ] , he claimed , in order to facilitate arms smuggling to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
So far , he continued , [LOC Egypt  ] had successfully stopped [ORG Hamas  ] from rearming . 
[PER Soliman  ] noted that in six months , MOD will have completed the construction of a subterranean steel wall along the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border to prevent smuggling . 
He warned , however , that people will find an alternative to the tunnels to smuggle arms , goods , people , and money . 
Admiral [PER Mullen  ] expressed appreciation for [LOC Egypt  ] 's efforts to combat smuggling , adding that he hoped [LOC Egypt  ] felt comfortable enough to ask for additional border security assistance at any time. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) [LOC Egypt  ] has " started a confrontation with [ORG Hezbollah  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , " [PER Soliman  ] stressed , and " we will not allow [LOC Iran  ] to operate in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
" [PER Soliman  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] had sent a clear message to [LOC Iran  ] that if they interfere in [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] will interfere in [LOC Iran  ] , adding that EGIS had already begun recruiting agents in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] hoped the [LOC U.S.  ] would " not walk the same track as the [MISC Europeans  ] " in regards to negotiating with [LOC Iran  ] and warned against only focusing on one issue at time , like [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons program . 
[LOC Iran  ] must " pay the price " for its actions and not be allowed to interfere in regional affairs . 
" If you want [LOC Egypt  ] to cooperate with you on [LOC Iran  ] , we will , " [PER Soliman  ] added , " it would take a big burden off our shoulders . 
" ----- [LOC Sudan  ] ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S/NF ) [LOC Egypt  ] is very concerned with stability in [LOC Sudan  ] , [PER Soliman  ] said , but asked for the [LOC U.S.  ] to be " patient " with the [MISC Sudanese  ] government and give [LOC Egypt  ] time to help the [MISC Sudanese  ] government deal with its problems . 
He applauded the appointment of Special Envoy Gration and recent [LOC U.S.  ] statements on [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] was focused on three areas for promoting stability in [LOC Sudan: 1  ] ) repairing the relationship between Chadean President Deby and [MISC Sudanese  ] President [PER Bashir  ] and stopping their support for each others' insurgencies 2 ) supporting negotiations between the various factions in [LOC Darfur  ] , and 3 ) implementing the [ORG CPA  ] . 
[PER Soliman  ] encouraged a larger role for [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] in mediating between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
He said that [LOC Southern Sudan  ] " feels no benefits from unity , " and [LOC Egypt  ] is trying to bridge the " physiological gap " between north and south itself by providing humanitarian assistance . 
" [LOC Egypt  ] does not want a divided [LOC Sudan  ] , " he stressed . 
Admiral [PER Mullen  ] replied that [LOC Egypt  ] 's leadership on [LOC Sudan  ] was critical and looked forward to increased cooperation between [LOC Egypt  ] and Special Envoy Gration. ------------------ Piracy and [LOC Somalia  ] ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S/NF ) Admiral [PER Mullen  ] stressed that piracy was an international crime that needed an international solution , especially on support for trying captured pirates . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] did not want [LOC Somalia  ] to become the next safe haven for al-Qaeda after [LOC Pakistan  ] , he stressed . 
[PER Soliman  ] replied that there were not enough ships in the region to provide adequate security against pirate attacks and recommended that the international community , through the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , focus counter piracy efforts on the [MISC Somali  ] shore. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Admiral [PER Mullen  ] did not have the opportunity to clear before his departure .
