( C ) [MISC Libyan  ] officials convoked the diplomatic corps , including [LOC France  ] 's visiting Special Envoy on [LOC Sudan  ] , on three hours' notice on January 17 to announce the merger of six [LOC Darfur  ] rebel groups at a conference in [LOC Kufra  ] ( approximately 1000 miles southeast of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) . 
Chaired by FM-equivalent [PER Musa Kusa  ] , the [MISC Libyans  ] announced that [ORG SLA/Field Command  ] ; SLA/Unity ; [PER SLA/Khamis Abdullah  ] ; the [ORG National Front for Democracy , Justice  ] , [ORG and Development  ] ( [ORG Note:  ] possibly SLA/Democracy - [PER Ali Karbino  ] . 
End note . 
) ; the [ORG National Movement for Reform and Development  ] ; and the [ORG United Revolutionary Front  ] had agreed to merge under the common leadership of [PER Tigani Seisei  ] . 
[PER Seisei  ] reportedly remained in [LOC Kufra  ] as of January 18 to continue negotiations between rebel factions and the Government of [LOC Libya  ] on the unification project . 
According to [MISC French  ] poloff , [PER Seisei  ] 's position would remain provisional until the rebels or [LOC Libya  ] could agree to provide compensation commensurate with his current job and salary at the [ORG UN  ] . 
[PER Mahjoub Hussein  ] served as the new group 's spokesperson to state media , though it is unclear if he has an official position in the new secretariat or is simply well-known to journalists here due to his long [LOC Tripoli  ] residence . 
2 . 
( C ) Comment: Both the unification and the public , [PER Musa Kusa-led  ] announcement of the same recall the short-lived March 2009 " Unity Plus " agreement . 
The hastily called rollout ( delayed an hour to allow for [MISC Libyan  ] and [MISC Sudanese  ] participants to straggle in ) may have been timed to maintain relevance given recent bilateral advances between [LOC Khartoum  ] and [LOC N'Djamena  ] . 
[MISC Libyan  ] Director of Military Intelligence [PER Abdullah Sanussi  ] was thanked by all parties but was not present at the event , a fact more likely attributed to his desire to keep a low public profile than a metric of his ongoing involvement . 
Diplomatic observers in [LOC Tripoli  ] have so far been dismissive of the [LOC Kufra  ] initiative , commenting that uniting minor groups that will have a weak negotiating position in [LOC Doha  ] is hardly the " win " [LOC Libya  ] was hoping for out of the conference . 
End comment .
